mbti,3e5lq2,deathbutton1,5,Wed Jul 22 03:21:36 2015 UTC,"This is reflective of an INTP's inferior Fe compared to an INTJ's tertiary Fi.  Both types are cold and robotic on the surface, but the way they handle feelings is very different. INTPs have a little bit of Fe, which makes them a bit warmer than an INTJ.  An INTJ has tertiary Fi, which makes them more human, but less inclined to express such feelings, making them seem colder.  Neither type is very comfortable with feelings, but the way they do so is kind of like every other INTP vs INTJ approach.  We act the same, but the impetus is distinctly different, and the end results are also similar, yet still very different.    In my experience, I have very few emotions, but can express them readily, if need be.  My INTJ girlfriend on the other hand, has way more feelings, but can't express them very readily. Emotions are more of a mystery for her and also more important.  For me, feelings have little importance, but I can express them better than she can.  This is where the dichotomy comes into play.  She is always looking for more than meets the eye when it comes to my feelings.  My response is ""oh no, there is less than meets the eye"".  To sum up, an INTP can get an understanding of their inferior Fe and learn how to be polite and pleasant and appropriate, even though it comes far from natural.  An INTJ has a harder lift with connecting to others since Fi at any level sucks at it, let alone in the tertiary position.  This is where the observation that INTPs are the warmest robots, while INTJs are the coldest humans comes from.  For INTPs, the struggle is always at the forefront as it is a struggle between Dominant and Inferior.  For INTJs, it is a struggle between the Auxiliary and Tertiary, and therefore, less important."
mbti,3e5lq2,jermofo,6,Wed Jul 22 04:16:41 2015 UTC,"An INTP says: ""I don't understand emotions and I don't consider them important"" and leaves it at that.  An INTJ says: ""Your emotions are irrational"" and attempts to argue why his are better."
mbti,3e5lq2,SquirmGirl,4,Wed Jul 22 04:32:11 2015 UTC,"The idea I think is that the intp seems to be emotionally detached and all, computing things like a robot, but they still have a warm heart, that repressed fe.   The INTJ on the other side looks at the world as a human, not only processed data but also looking at the world as a whole, but because they have a very suppressed fi it might hard for them to articulate their feelings properly, resulting in us seeing them as cold"

In the specific case I observed up close, the ESFP girlfriend required constant attention from her ENFP boyfriend. They needed to constantly be doing stupid and extravagant things all the time that costed him a bunch of money. She never had money but she was the one who wanted to do all the crazy stuff. She was constantly worried about their ""flame"" dying out, she got jealous and came to crazy conclusions every time he talked to a girl (even though she was friends with and flirted with pretty crude and disrespectful guys), and that anxiety was part of what drove him away in the end.  He just enjoyed her company, but she couldn't see that that alone was enough to make the relationship work. Again, this was one case, but I'm assuming some of the details will remain the same for other ESFPs."

It was more exhausting for me though because she was stealing my friend away and he was too engulfed in feelings to see what it was doing to him.

This level of compatibility often results in the formation of friendships. Both persons value at least half the same information elements and these similarities will be highlighted and emphasized in the interaction between them. Although the friendship will often be long-lasting, the intimacy and closeness of the relationship will be limited again by the fact that the parties do not value all the same information elements.

Just compare Monte to Krepo, who is a pretty clear cut NTP  (most likely ENTP), and you'll quickly notice there's very little similarities between them. Everything about Monte screams Te/Fi to me. His analysis doesn't strike me as Ti at all."

He also has a witty little smirk when he bites with his T. His T is really obvious and out in the open, which makes me think Te does suit him, Ti is usually more hidden away, like they have to think deeply before they answer questions.  I think Te communication is out in the open, they like to talk through their logic right? I think if he was NTP he would lead with that Ne more and be more scattered and less decisive, which doesn't seem to fit when I think about those strong (authoritative?) opinions he has. I get the sense that he is a little bit arrogant too.  I can tell he is N, he's totally about big sweeping ideas. I think when he takes sports and uses it as a viewing lens to gain insight into e.sports - that really shows his Ni. I'm pretty convinced he is XNTJ, he comes across to me as an introvert, but maybe that's what ENTJs are like? I have never really recognized ENTJs before."

mbti,3e234h,onafarawaybeach,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:46 2015 UTC,I think it's b/c in the primitive world there is barely any need for an N type. Maybe a shaman would be an N but no one else need be. It explains why progress is so slow and often must wait for a generation to die off.

mbti,3e1ivx,Spore2012,13,Tue Jul 21 06:14:21 2015 UTC,"Enneagram describes common addictions for each type. If you correlate MBTI to enneagram you can figure this out.   Enneagram 5s (INTP, INTJ, ISTP):   Addictions: Poor eating and sleeping habits due to minimizing needs. Neglecting hygiene and nutrition. Lack of physical activity. Psychotropic drugs for mental stimulation and escape, narcotics for anxiety.   Enneagram 7 (ENTP, ENFP, ESTP, ESFP):   Addictions: The type most prone to addictions: stimulants (caffeine, cocaine, and amphetamines), Ecstasy, psychotropics, narcotics, and alcohol but tend to avoid other depressants. Wear body out with effort to stay “up.” Excessive cosmetic surgery, pain killers.   Seems to me that they share the same kind of addictions, but for different reasons, 7 and 5 are fairly closely related in their motivations too as far as I know."

Under-eating for self-control: in extreme cases anorexia and bulimia. Alcohol to relieve tension.   Nutrition / health / dieting obsessive. Carb binges. Constantly feeling guilty about not eating properly, not exercising enough.

For example, he regularly cites the incident where the Mail reported that a council house resident was forced to remove the British flag from their window - ""we can't even be proud of being British any more"" - when I know that it was actually removed because it had political content on it. The political bit was either not included in the Mail's article, or else many people didn't pick it up.  It kinda baffles me that people that I otherwise respect can keep taking that stuff at face value, you know?   Interesting you made those guesses.

If somebody is going on about 'I hate benefits scroungers and immigrants' in the UK, it's not as though they have sat down and arrived at that opinion themselves by weighing up the evidence or anything like that. Rather, it's just that they think that that's what everybody else thinks because that's the impression that they've got from newspapers, so they have to kinda sorta think it too. So that's why I say that the fact he does this is not relevant at all to his type, it tells us nothing about how he thinks. There is indeed a liberal portion who would reject most of Daily Mail, but sometime I like to just ignore the existence of massive sections of the public in order to like, make my argument sound bigger.   It kinda baffles me that people that I otherwise respect can keep taking that stuff at face value, you know?   Yeah, I totally get this. Like you'll be talking to somebody and they're like this really complex and interesting person, but then they'll get onto the topic of immigrants and all of a sudden they are not themselves any more, they are saying stock arguments, all of which I have read somewhere before. It's weird.  So how I type this guy - we'll rule out all the introverted types. I also think that...   Telling people about his qualities, his point of view on things, his experiences etc.   It seems as though he's more concerned with his own immediate experience in life than anything else, and there's nothing elsewhere to suggest he has intuitive tendencies, so we'll rule out all the intuitive types as well and we are left with ESTP, ESTJ, ESFP, ESFJ.    Then realistically it could be any of those four types, but if I'm forced to pick one here is how I go about it -   I think it's unlikely he would be ESTP because he is always telling people about his this, his that, etc. - ESTPs usually have sharper social skills than talking about themselves all the time.  It's very unusual to hear anybody describe an ESTJ as 'open and kind' (look, NFPs, I'm not saying that all ESTJs are horrible, I think that most ESTJs are actually quite nice, it's just that they wouldn't normally get described that way by their peers). They also tend not to be particularly generous, believing instead that people need to work hard and earn their shit in life. Generosity is actually doing the person a disservice in their heads because it means that the other person is not helping themselves which is bad for them in the long run. ESTJs also tend not to be too generous with compliments, they are more of a 'tough love' kinda type. And Te dominants are usually perfectly comfortable spending time by themselves, a lot of them mistake themselves for introverts. Plus, the fact that he scored ENTJ on a test means nothing, because tests are terrible, so I would also rule out ESTJ.  Unusual for an ESFJ to like getting into fights and such. Sounds like the guy you describe actually kinda gets a bit of a rush out of it, which makes Se dominant massively more likely than Fe 'let's all get along' dominant.  So we're left with ESFP, and unlike all the other types there's nothing you write that would be unusual for an ESFP, so that's how I settle on that one."

I think ENTPs are less inclined to this, right? Here's a Mark Twain quote on that, in kind:  ""Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.""  I see why you rule out the intuitive types. I did the same, but I'm now thinking he might be an ENFJ, but with an underused Ni (I've read a few threads about ""loops"", lately). He keeps telling me that he likes strategising and thinking x steps ahead, but to me, a lot of his schemes seem ill-conceived or short-sighted.  He's so totally extraverted that I could believe his introverted types might be surpressed/underdeveloped (?).  I've having a look over your suggestions. Look like they're worth reading into.

mbti,3e22ei,zeemeerman2,5,Tue Jul 21 10:34:01 2015 UTC,"The temperaments (SJ, SP, NJ, NP) are based on David Keirsey's work.  Upon looking at the existing function pair groups of SF, ST, NF, and NT, he felt that SJs and SPs were more alike in those respective pairings than SFs and STs.  He compared to other four-type models:  Plato Artisan-Guardian-Idealist-Rational |  Aristotle Hedonic-Proprietary-Ethical-Dialectical |  Galen Sanguine-Melancholic-Choleric-Phlegmatic |  Paracelsus Changeable-Industrious-Inspired-Curious |  Adickes Innovative-Traditional-Doctrinaire-Skeptical |  Spranger Aesthetic-Economic-Religious-Theoretic |  Kretschmer Hypomanic-Depressive-Hyperesthetic-Anesthetic |  Fromm Exploitative-Hoarding-Receptive-Marketing |  Myers Probing-Scheduling-Friendly-Tough-minded |  Keirsey SP-SJ-NF-NT  And decided that SPs fit in with the other types of the same column, just as SJs fit theirs, and so on.  Interestingly, the MBTI manual makes mention of all kinds of letter combinations, including Keirsey's. Other than function pairs, they also look at EPs, EJs, IPs, IJs; SPs, SJs, NPs, NJs; TPs, TJs, FPs, FJs; ENs, ESs, INs, ISs; & ETs, EFs, ITs, IFs."
mbti,3e22ei,PaladinXT,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:47 2015 UTC,"That categorization is from Keirsey's typology. He uses a behavioral-empirical (not cognitive) model with four spectrum-based dichotomies that appear superficially similar and have the same naming system as MBTI, but are not the same thing. He also has a very pronounced intuitive bias and his intuitive types are without fail more interesting and desirable compared to their sensing counterparts.  There is actually no reason to adopt Keirsey's temperaments while also adhering to the cognitive types proposed by Jung, and about a million reasons to reject Keirsey's model as incompatible with Jung. If you try to use both at the same time you will probably just end up confusing yourself and/or others.  People who are fond of Keirsey temperaments are intuitive types (or at least believe they are intuitive) and are fond of descriptions of themselves as special snowflakes of either the 'rationalist' or 'idealist' variety, shining brightly among the boring masses of 'guardians' and 'artisans' that make up most of the population.  It makes no sense in spite of its popularity, so your confusion is very much understandable."

You can do it some way but then like...what do all NJ types have in common exactly for example? You can categorise the types in whatever way you like, but it seems like these four temperaments sort people into distinct groups more effectively. NTs are rationals, SPs are artisans, NFs are idealists, SJs are guardians.  I don't get why it's necessary for there to be a pattern for everything. Like people expect everything to do with the types to just work out perfectly symmetrically or whatever but there's no justification for this given how random people are."

It is generally said to include 3 skills:   Emotional awareness, including the ability to identify your own emotions and those of others; The ability to harness emotions and apply them to tasks like thinking and problems solving; The ability to manage emotions, including the ability to regulate your own emotions, and the ability to cheer up or calm down another person."

mbti,3e16gl,SkulduggeryDude,6,Tue Jul 21 04:41:41 2015 UTC,"I've taken a few silly online EQ quizzes that made me realize some people must consider it the ability to read emotions via facial expressions.

I'm always questioning people's motives and trying to understand who they are, why they behave the way they do, say the things they say, etc. But I don't rely THAT much on their facial expressions. Probably because I rock a solid poker face when I do not want anyone to understand exactly how I feel. I imagine Fe users (dominant and tertiary) are emotionally intelligent in a traditional way. They are much more in tune with others' feelings - especially in groups. Just my cents."

Channel that Ne! One way I can think of doing it is to write your frustrations down on paper. Don't question yourself as you do this; just let your thoughts go onto the paper into words. If you have somebody you can absolutely trust (preferably a Ti type or an older IxFJ), go over these issues with him/her one by one. ""Why Ti?"" you may ask; well, this function is built to deconstruct ideas -- in this case, your worries and concerns. Once you're done talking, manually shred the paper(s) with your negative thoughts to let yourself know that they don't worry you anymore. This is to reinforce the fact that you know yourself to be better and stronger than whatever fear is inside of you.   Does anyone have any advice on how to think in a more positive way or how tips on how to live in the present?   As for my personal advice as a dom Ti user: fear is perfectly natural, so there is nothing wrong with being afraid of things. Just don't let it control you into being somebody you're not. There are people out there who believe in you, just as you do for them. Do some nice little surprise favors for said people even (no, especially) if you are afraid and nervous.

Work on focusing your attention to become an active participant in the world around you. Try to become more mentally and emotionally engaged.   edit: It sounds like you are Enneagram 9 like me. I tend to drift away from reality quite much too and this is just some of the tips they have for 9. These tips come from a spiritual perspective and I believe they are based on wisdom rather than logic.  Socionics has a more logical/psychological approach. For INFP (INFj), your Super-Ego block function are Ti + Se. This is a direct result of your two primary Ego functions Fi + Ne that you use naturally in almost every situation. For every type, the Super-Ego is perceived as an area of weakness that they need to improve and they are sensitive about it, so when people tell you that you are not connected to reality (Se), you turn off your main functions and go off and patch up the leaks for a while. You eventually fall back to Fi + Ne (The Ego functions) and your natural state. Patching leaks doesn’t seem like a bad idea to me, but you won’t be able to sustain doing it for very long.  They suggest working on your Ego functions (Fi + Ne) for long term self development, sort of like what u/aNinjaWithAIDS seems to be suggesting."

He might be INTP, but this is what Ne + Fe is like, full face smile, you can see it in his eyes... I know this is probably irrelevant, but I think this idea is awesome >.>  Anyway, I'm not familiar with loops so to speak, but Fe for ENTP is like this:   Enjoy lively, animated and fun interaction with people, but tend to be unemotional when left on their own. However, he is not inclined to create this atmosphere himself but can create situations where there is a good chance that others will take the emotional initiative and create a fun and emotionally stimulating atmosphere. Failure at such attempts are met with dismay, which the individual either hides or reacts to with frustration and annoyance.   So I guess a 'loop' might involve looking for fun ideas and novelty, getting bored and then turning to their friends to entertain them until their friend let them down by being boring, which leads them back to Ti+Ne?"
mbti,3e1g8h,Poropopper,2,Tue Jul 21 09:14:46 2015 UTC,The quoted text is interesting but I wouldn't say I'm unemotional on my own. I get emotional at things and events (extroverted feeling). So it's emotional at stimuli. Could be something in an environment. If you look at INFJ writing (Dante's inferno) the feeling is infused with the environment.  People are a source of stimuli so I can largely see why the statement applies.
mbti,3e1g8h,MrJudzey,4,Tue Jul 21 10:20:58 2015 UTC,"Basically one day somebody on the internet with a terrible understanding of personality disorders literally invented the concept of 'loops' off the top of their head to kinda explain away personality disorders by saying they were caused by like, different functions or whatever, and people on the internet have been discussing these 'loops' as though they actually exist in reality ever since."
mbti,3e1g8h,CmdBelial,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:41:45 2015 UTC,"An Ne-Fe loop simply put is placing a higher than usual value on outside validation rather than trusting your own judgements.  The idea of a loop is that you can have a tendency to rely on your dom and tertiary functions since they are oriented in the same direction. It may feel good sometimes since it will further validate or feed your extroverted or introverted nature, but it is at the expense of the natural check and balance nature of your various functions.    There is a lot of debate whether or not a loop is an actual occurrence and how far to take it.  There are a lot of problems with the idea of a loop and I think there is a tendency to take it too far.  Each loop has been linked to a specific personality disorder, for example Narcissistic behavior for Ne-Fe.   This makes it sound like Narcissism can be explained by a lack of Ti judgements.  I suspect that this is putting the cart before the horse and trying to use MBTI to arrive at a cause of a psychological disorder when maybe a better approach might be to start with the disorder and use the functions to better understand its effects.    On scale less minor than a full blown personality disorder I think that being aware of loop like behavior is a good thing.  For an ENTP I think it is undoubtedly a good thing to not loose sight of your personal judgments in favor of external validation.  Ne is such a frantic, scattered explosion of energy that it really needs the judging functions to keep it from going nuts.  Loop like behavior basically losing sight of yourself for a period of time, focusing either too much on objective or subjective elements.   Here is an article that I found interesting.  It refutes the idea a Dom-Tert loop and instead describes how the other functions operate during this type of behavior.  http://personalitycafe.com/cognitive-functions/106486-cognitive-function-loops-practical-conceptual-problems.html I think it seems a little more reasonable of an explanation than just your Auxiliary has shut down completely."

I hate many, many things, but the pet industry is going to have to get in the back of the line.  I like animals. Don't get me wrong, but let's look at what is really going on here.  Animal lovers create a demand for animals. They love animals and want them readily available as a product. They shop for animals. It is like brand loyalty.  ""I want a pure-bred such and such..""   Producing products for the masses results in unintended consequences. Namely, waste. Waste equals undesired animals."
mbti,3dxo6t,XenoxOfficial,3,Mon Jul 20 11:39:46 2015 UTC,"I don't tend to like P/J dichotomies because they tend to create inaccurate representations of their respective member types, but this is a place where I agree.   My INFJ friend has already planned out where his future houses are going to be and what amenities and architectural styles they are going to have, and I venture to guess he probably has a strong idea of what they houses are going to look like. He's writing a fiction novel, and has already planned out at least every character, location, plot, and subplot for the first book in the series (he looks up to Tolkien).   That kind of specific planning can most commonly be seen in people who spend a lot of time focusing on linear progressions of ideas, versus the expansive, wacky nature of Ne. I would characterize Ne as laissez-faire and Ni as much more hands-on in terms of what they want to happen.  My band in high school actually kicked my INFJ friend out because he forced his ideas on us without the authority to do so or recognition by everyone that he was the sole creative force. Nevertheless, he tried to control every major aspect of songwriting.   I have a lot more of these examples since that pattern of action is endemic to the person. It's really fun to watch."
mbti,3dxo6t,_mildude,2,Mon Jul 20 14:38:09 2015 UTC,"Fantastic post. I like dis.  The thing about P/J dichotomies, (specifically, why they suck) is that many ""judgers"" are actually using perceiving functions as their dominant. This is evident in Si and Ni-doms, IXXJ, so these people may seem pretty relaxed on the surface, but they still prefer structure. It's just happens first and foremost in their minds rather than the external world. They probably have an organized living environment at home, but they're not looking to organize the world in the same way that Te and Fe-doms often appear to be doing (or, are actually doing)."
mbti,3dxo6t,SquirmGirl,2,Tue Jul 21 00:37:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much! This is also true. My INFJ friend has called himself a go with the flow kind of person; when he either seems to not realize he's not that easy going but likes to pretend he is, or he says that purposely to enact his master plans of ultra manipulation /s.  I think for Ni doms it could sum up this topic to say that they're easy going as long is it isn't on something that's in their vision or that they either value or hold to be universally true (either Fi vs Ti). I know it's true for me."

Haha   I think for Ni doms it could sum up this topic to say that they're easy going as long is it isn't on something that's in their vision or that they either value or hold to be universally true   Yup! And considering Ni and Fe (or Te) are our top two functions, ""going with the flow"" actually proves to be quite difficult a lot of the time. It's just that Ni naturally sees things in a big picture format, which is very much a perceptive viewpoint in itself. I would argue that because of this, Ni-doms are ""perceivers at heart."" We just happen to prefer structure and planning ;)"

First thing I do is think of a world or concept for the story, which usually comes up at random. This usually includes some characters and locations. Then I think of what values of mine I want to inject in this world. This usually includes coming up with an ending that fits in with the moral I want to say. I then come up with an opening, new characters/locations/situations that will drive the message home, and inject the existing characters i previously came up with with flaws that drive them to learn what this world is trying to teach them. After that I try connecting point A with point B and repeat until we get to the ending.    Idk I ramble, I feel like this is more a mix of both as I do have points planned out such as beginning and end but I rarely have any of the middle part planned out at all. But I still think its more of an architecture way of writing. But as I wrote this I realized that what I write about with the whole moral part sounds a lot like Fi, holding personal values close. Im not really sure. Sorry if I sound pretentious."

mbti,3dvl8o,cathat123,12,Sun Jul 19 22:06:29 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to give one specific example of INFJ behavior based on my experience. This isn't a complete summary of Ni, but a view into how it works in a practical sense.  Compare an INFJ and an ISFJ. ISFJs have Si, which they project outwards using Fe. Si has a strong connections to how bodily sensations affect the user, and Fe is about handling values/ethics/emotions in the moment or in objective ways. So, for example, an ISFJ might give you a blankie because it is a nice thing to do (and because they would want a blankie if they were cold). INFJs do the same thing with their Ni (projecting outward with Fe). INFJs are good at making other people feel powerful, important, or smart. That is because Ni perceives a person's abstract needs in the same way that Si perceives a person's concrete needs, and Fe naturally tries to provide that.  Now, look at ESFPs and ENFPs (same functions as ISFJs and INFJs respectively, but with reversed attitudes). You'll notice that ESFPs are typically pretty giving people, and that ENFPs are really great at making people feel good about themselves. The difference is that both are acting from a place of Fi instead of Fe. Fe users, when a value/ethical/emotional problem comes up, almost have to act. For example, if two people are in conflict, the Fe user feels that conflict so strongly that they have to help solve the problem. Fi users act because the want to act. Fi does good because it is the right thing to do (in conjunction with Extroverted Perception, with is action-focused), Fe does good because it is a goodness-robot (usually motivated by Introverted Perception, which has a strong affect on the user) (I'm being harsh with Fe, I love Fe, I'm just describing an aspect of it)."
mbti,3dvl8o,WhatINeverSaid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:34:27 2015 UTC,"did you forget the specific example?  also, the opposites of ISFJs and INFJs are ENTPs and ESTPs, not ESFPs and ENFPs. The former two have the same functions, not the latter."
mbti,3dvl8o,_mildude,2,Sun Jul 19 23:54:37 2015 UTC,"Haha, I guess specific was the wrong word choice.  However, you're wrong on the second point, at least from a Jungian perspective. In the original text F, N, S, and T are the functions. Whether the function is introverted or extroverted is the function's attitude (which is what I said). So for an ISFJ the ENTP is a functional opposite, the ESFP is an attitude opposite, and the INTJ is a functional and attitude opposite."

mbti,3dvl8o,WhatINeverSaid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:58:34 2015 UTC,"Fe -> Fi is an directional change in my terms.   Now, look at ESFPs and ENFPs (same functions as ISFJs and INFJs respectively, but with reversed attitudes)     Reversed attitudes... as in implying that the stacks are flipped: ISFJ(Si-Fe-Ti-Ne) - ENTP(Ne-Ti-Fe-Si), INFJ(Ni-Fe-Ti-Se) - ESTP(Se-Ti-Fe-Ni). This is where the confusion can stem from, that's why I'm nagging on ""inverted directions"""
mbti,3dvl8o,CritSrc,3,Mon Jul 20 16:24:03 2015 UTC,"Well, sorry, but your definition of attitude is wrong. ""Attitude"" is the term for the I/E divide.   The Attitudes – Extraversion and Introversion  The first pair of opposites that Jung identified was the two opposite ways in which we adapt to, or orient ourselves to, the world. These are Jung’s attitudes of Extraversion and Introversion: Extraversion – Our energy moves toward the outer world of people, places and things; the world outside of us Introversion – Our energy moves toward the inner world of thoughts and ideas; the world inside of us   So, ENFPs and INFJs are attitude opposites because the have the exact same functions in the exact same order N/F/T/S, but with the attitudes flipped. ENFPs and ISTJs are functional opposites because their functions are in an opposite order, but each function's attitude matches to other Ne/Fi/Te/Si vs Si/Te/Fi/Ne. ENFPs and ESTPs are functional-attitude opposites because their functions are in an opposite order, and every function's attitude is reversed Ne/Fi/Te/Si vs Se/Ti/Fe/Ni."

mbti,3dvl8o,Komatik,7,Mon Jul 20 09:11:36 2015 UTC,"Ni basically looks at the current/relevant trends to form a ""system"" of concepts. At its best, Ni perceives an organized, behind-the-scenes comprehension of the ethereal/intangible works at play. At its worst, its like having a maze in your own mind with 3 or more people shouting for each other at the same time. To spot Ni a bit easier, listen for metaphors and similes that simplify ideas, situations, and context or to engage others with an unusual understanding (usually through Fe or Te).   Just keep in mind that Ni is more of a focal understanding of abstract works and theories. It doesn't generate ideas or observe unapparent differences like Ne does; it compounds and simplifies them to deliver a result or weigh potential consequences."
mbti,3dvl8o,aNinjaWithAIDS,9,Sun Jul 19 22:36:25 2015 UTC,"I once read a description I like that compares the two:   When Ne is interested in something, it's like an explosion that starts at one point and scatters outward. When Ni is interested in something, it's like a giant formless nebula that condenses inward to become more solid."
mbti,3dvl8o,A_DRAWER,2,Sun Jul 19 23:05:00 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, yes. If you want an even simpler comparison, Ne is the supernova while Ni is the black hole that gets left behind."
mbti,3dvl8o,aNinjaWithAIDS,9,Sun Jul 19 23:18:20 2015 UTC,"Eh. Ok I'm INFJ with Ni primary. I've been nicknamed Rasputin for seeing things happen way in advance. I've been called a wizard, sorceror, warlock, etc. I also have been told that I have the ability to look into someone's soul.  To be perfectly honest. That time I supposedly looked into someone's soul, I was really tired after a long day of work and was mostly thinking about pudding, or pizza or pizzapudding.  So why are these people saying these things? Because I see one small thing and my subconscious processes then take it and patch it together as part of the big picture.  Examples:  Someone I worked with was starting to behave a very specific way. In my brain memory banks this behaviour was linked to secession, preparation of attack, antagonising, high probability of dangerous behaviour with negative effects for the innocent.  As the idiot that I am, I took immediate action to get this person completely removed. Everyone else didn't like this and said I was insane and I lost a lot of support. 2 weeks later the attack happens and everyone suffers. I get to return and do crisis management. Turns out there was shitloads of written proof of this guy having a sort of king or god complex. This didn't just happen once or twice. It happens a whole lot. I spot something, link it up with other observations and get a conclusion. I actively do this. Non-stop. Others do this when told. I do not. I do it automatically.  I didn't have any written proof of what this idiot was up to. All I had were a series or sets of behaviours of him and his cronies which created a high probability of danger. Then I found one thing which solidified it for me and I tried to remove him. The solid understanding I had was pretty much impossible to explain to others.  I've learned that it isn't my problem and I can't do anything about it other than put myself in a safe position for when it happens. This is not clairvoyance or pulling facts out of gaseous fumes. It's more like risk assessment. The movement in the grass sort of stuff where you prepare whether it is a lion or just the wind.  One must be extremely careful with this as I've seen other Ni primaries go on about spirituality and giftedness and being told by god and crap like that. All it is is spotting, triggering memory bank searchers and assuming, followed by making sure and more keen observation. ""Oh, what's this? Interesting, must stare at it for a while. Better write it down too.""  Another example: I notice grass is kind of wet. It had rained but this grass is wetter than other grass. Weird. There's a patch of wetness over there. It had rained, whatever. Why the fuck are there algae growing in it? Turns out some ahole had opened up a tap outside and it had been running for maybe a month. Maybe it's sensing a bit too. This example I mean.  Another example: I'm constantly looking for potential future problems. I'm also constantly doing things which prevent or cope with or jerry rig solutions for future problems. It happens in such a way that future problems tend to not happen. If I'm then taken away from that position and someone else takes over, everything goes to hell. ""It's impossible to do this."" ""But Don did it and that guy's an idiot so why can't you?""  This manifests itself in:   Me having fully equipped medical closet for emergencies. Me having to do all the medical stuff in my area ""halp I has headache"", ""halp I cut off my toe"" ""halp I have a throat ache"" ""halp there's weird rashes"" This kid had a badly bandaged wrist, obviously put on by an idiot. I took kid to hospital, turns out he needed a cast due to broken bones. Me anticipating bad planning in others and setting my deadlines at the half period (possibly a J thing) so I can deliver early (but don't actually do so, so I can sit on it and let it ferment for the remaining time) which happened a lot. Me starting every goddamn meeting e-mail with ""Failing to plan is planning to fail"" and annoying the crap out of people but putting OCD people at ease. Me focusing heavily on morale within groups if I'm in charge of the group or part of it. I carry a goddamn printout of the Sunza/Art of War. Me carrying several writing tools, several notebooks, a tablet, e-reader, audio recording device but I should elaborate on those.   I used to be more of an idiot. Like everyone else used to be an idiot and continues to be so but hopefully becoming less of an idiot over time. One way I figured to train my functions, especially Ni and especially to strengthen critical thinking skills was to write everything down. If someone doesn't take notes, that someone is probably a huge idiot. I take notes on many things, lists, etc. Why? Because I don't want to be wrong. Giving wrong information is bad. Giving information without knowing where you got it is bad. Source amnesia is a thing. I feed my brain memory banks with information so my Ni has a more robust back-end database or system for Ni-ing. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_amnesia ""There's this thing, it has several things, it was by some guy, lemme look it up"" opens notebook  I was kind of ghost-writing a book for this organisation and I whipped out my notebooks. They were confused as to why I had 4 different notebooks and how they could possibly be of use to the job. Well, I used those notebooks to support my Ni to more rapidly build a pattern and more rapidly build a consistent narrative for the book.  Ni doesn't see problems as problems. It sees them as symptoms. It can go extremely far. An observation is a symptom of another symptom of another symptom of a problem. It's multi-step thinking. This person I know who is way more into MBTI than I am tells me Ni primaries are probably good at chess. I personally hate chess but Go is kind of cool.  How to spot a Ni though? First of all, that's dangerous, thinking you can spot a Ni or anything else for that matter. MBTI lets you assess yourself. Certified MBTI people will tell you it's not to be used to assess others. They can only asses themselves and if you're lucky they'll tell you their score. This is a Ni primary telling you this. I guess that means something.  I'm guessing young untrained Nis will come up with weird stuff that will happen in the future and nobody will believe them. Trained Nis will not make their Ni apparent because too hard to explain and not worth the time I guess. Maybe someone who sucks in information and then comes up with stuff.  I've been told I make weird gestures to myself a lot when working on stuff. I'll put things in place with my hands and look super creepy because these things I place are floating in mid air and nobody else can see them. (might be Se maybe?)  I've been told I talk to myself silently or think to myself. Got bullied for that for a few days in primary school. ""You stupid self-talker ewww"" Made no sense to me that that was eww. One can apparently see me thinking or contemplating.   Oh I make walls of text. I heard that's an indicator. I hate TLDRing.  But back to those untrained Nis. You may run into them spiritual peoples and people who think they ""just know"" things. There's these communities out there who will give you a million dollars if you can go and ""just know"" things for them. I consider myself to be a trained Ni dom or at least an in-training. I realise and know that there's nothing magical about it. Instead I look for what it might be. And Kahneman's Behavioural economics help understand it, as well as other psychological and neurological things.   The ""training"" thus, in my case, is focusing on critical thinking skills and creating and maintaining this back-end database system, while learning more about the brain. The hope is that I empower my functions and euh, improve myself? I guess.  Before I euh ""trained"" it, I'd come up with ""feelings"" and be worried something would happen and then it happened. After ""training"" I'd come up with ""possible outcomes"" and plan accordingly without worry and then it happens. Before I wouldn't be able to explain. Now I am able to explain better because I'm training myself to pull subconscious patterns into the conscious through heavy meta-cognition and physical aids (notebooks) and actively molding my environment. With this last part I mean telling people that if I go quiet, it's because I'm thinking. Or I explain how I do stuff with wallotext emails and manuals on how to handle Don.  Another thing I noticed is that I become super sad when something changes. Someone leaves the job to work somewhere else. I wouldn't say it terrifies me because I'm rugged and strong but it euh, screw it I just get super sad :(   I guess it's because now the pattern or system changes and I need to recalculate and my subconscious gets worried because I have not yet calculated for new future dangers because the baseline just changed by a lot. I guess it's a cortisol boost, so stress, so need to spend time calculating new baseline for future issues.   So spotting requires a distinction between untrained and trained Nis and possibly more (let's not go false dichotomy here, there's possibly other types of Nis I'm forgetting)  I'm not sure if I should mention definitions. I like defining things. Maybe that's Ni. One needs to work with set definitions of words because if someone has a different definition, that changes the baseline and makes the future wonky.  I'm also obsessed with chaos theory and wish I had the math capabilities to figure it out. I'm learning more math for this reason.  Ima quit now due to wallotext  TLDR: niiiiiiiiiiiiiii"

Yours for example offers a lot of information to dive through and dissect out good-to-know parts.  << I'd come up with ""feelings"" and be worried something would happen and then it happened. >> This part, I believe, sums up the nice quality of Ni pretty well.

mbti,3dvl8o,rntksi,2,Mon Jul 20 04:06:01 2015 UTC,"I like keeping them secret because I've run into people who are polite in my face but talked shit about me in their language... near my face.  Had these German dudes talk English to me, then they walked off and talked in German about some stuff that might not be legal. ""Don't talk too loud!"" ""Ach, that idiot can't understand us anyway.""  Being heterozygotic results in me facing a lot of adverse reactions to my existence. I frequently have people asking me whether I have work and if I speak whatever the local language is. I used to say ""yes I speak this language"" and my shrinks thought it was weird that people ask me this out of the blue, on the street, etc. So now I say no and talk in a non-local language just to see what they'll say and it's usually nationalist Schwachsinn.  Translation: being mixed race-ish, I face racism. I troll potential racists to see if racist.  hmmmm  I don't know if this is Ni but I frequently test people. For example, someone I know asked me, back in when I was in college, who my professor was. I made up a fake name and the person said ""Hey I know that one, I used to go to his classes. He's really good you should pay attention."" Further tests showed me that this person is possibly a pathological liar. It's just lie after lie after lie to make themselves look better or knowledgeable, which apparently lots of people do.  I don't test people to find out their personality because impromptu tests say more about their day or mood than it does their beliefs or attitudes or nature.   Although... I collect fountain pens and whip them out a lot. Reactions to it are interesting. A person may say nothing, which means nothing. A person may say ""oh cool"". Maybe they'll say ""what? you still use that? That's so dumb. Look, a 20 cent pen works just fine."" That to me says confrontational, competitive, no respect for other people's hobbies, wanting others to conform to their standards, depending on whether there are people around, a need to prove themselves better than others. Possibly rigid mind (as opposed to open mind) which means possibly unable to consider abstract ideas. Possibly low intelligence without being aware of their own low intelligence therefore possible danger for a heterozygotic person like me. Note that I mentioned zero MBTI functions in my assessment of them.   A skeptical person reading this will see ""so if someone doesn't like your fountain pens, they're immediately a racist?"" To which I would say ""euh...""  The thing is that I'd not consider them racist right away but I'd keep an eye on them and stash this interaction in my brain memorybanks or my notebooks. I have a notebook dedicated to people I know. It's very possible that the person in the example is just putting it down because they think that's the cool thing to do. This has been mostly the case so far. I say ""mostly"" because racists have destroyed my pens in the past because I'm ""less than a dog"" and don't deserve certain things or whatever.  I see racism as a symptom of low intelligence which itself is a symptom of a variety of issues like poverty, generational poverty, (Symptoms don't always manifest themselves - in my usage of the word. Like having chicken pox without getting the fever that usually accompanies it. (since it is a variety of flu)) tendency for jealousy, absence of any critical thinking or thinkers in an area or language. For example, there are some languages which don't have words for ""heaven"", ""bias"", ""fallacy"", etc. The heaven example is often in languages of peoples who were cut off from the rest of the world who had religions based on gods and an afterlife. I tend to say that the lack of words for basic critical thinking terms is found in languages of people who were cut off from those who ... do critical thinking. These languages require heavy use of other languages to explain these critical thinking concepts which means that critical thinkers who live in areas that have these lacking languages, will need to learn multiple languages. Which means that those who uphold the one language to rule above all other languages nationalist ideal are going to be less likely to even be willing to learn those languages. This means they're not going to understand critical thinking very well. They'll oversimplify it and think they already think critically which is what showed them that all darkies are evil jobstealers, so it must be true!! It just leads to lower Ambiguitätstoleranz imo which is another thread for another time.  Why not just use bastard words and not learn entire languages? Because they are entire concepts that are harder to explain and are going to just be explained by their false synonyms. The definition gets bastardised and broken and it's not the same. They paraphrase into their own local language which isn't used to explaining it or can't explain it so they use a single word which doesn't mean the same. The Dutch ""vooroordeel"" or French ""préjugé"" for ""bias"" for example, which doesn't mean the same but is conveniently used as a translation anyway. I can go on about this for weeks.   Ok lemme back up a bit. I just linked languages to racism, fountain pens and critical thinking. I'm going to say this is an example of trained Ni with a heavy amount of Ti and not Ne.  I'm wallotexting again."

I made up a fake name and the person said   I did this a lot before. But, I realised afterwards, it's unfair to lie to test. I think it might be because of this one time when I did that and got caught, because the other person was (obviously) smarter than me, and saw through my testing.

Had a conversation where I likened bilingualism/multilingualism to seeing the world in colour, as opposed to the monotonic view of people with knowledge of only one language. It might be a high-and-mighty view of the world, but it turns out to be pretty encouraging for people to learn languages."

You circle the noumenon long enough, the other party can at least get a sense of what it is not and work from there.  Ti, likewise. Take the time, craft your statement, it can be done. Not always pleasant, especially for ISTPs who are not that verbally inclined, but possible.  With Fi, the reasons ""because"" just stop at some point in my experience. At some point, it stops at ""I like this""/""I feel this is right/good"" and you just can't go deeper from there. You can probably go a smidge deeper from the first surface statement, but it probably stops quite soon into something that has no apparent reason to it - in Ni's case there is reason, it is merely obfuscated.

When I am not in school I go back to being an INTP... quite a strange feeling.   I was wondering if it has more to do with learning about things I'm not interested in. When I have to force myself to pay attention to things I don't care about I adopt the Ni/Se preferences. I feel like I do this because I have convinced myself that college is more for S and J types.  I know that's not entirely true because in my reports/essays I can make some really deep introspective observations and come up with some creative ideas and theories, and my teachers always appreciate those. But when it comes to absorbing information, the INTP route of only paying attention to what you think is important won't get you through a comprehensive final at the end of the semester.  Then again, I do occasionally wonder if I am an ISTP... its weird though, sometimes I feel like an xxxP, because I can never imitate J's, I just don't understand them, lol.  **edit: I felt this testimony was relevant because it provides some insight into someone who is torn between identifying with Ne or Ni. Maybe it won't be helpful, if not, oh well :P"
mbti,3dvl8o,intprecipitation,4,Sun Jul 19 23:13:46 2015 UTC,"This ""switch"" is normal.  You don't actually switch functional preferences.  The key word here, is preferences.  A Ti user can definitely understand Te perspectives and excel in a Te dominated environment, for example.  They would just prefer different methods and probably think Te methods are a hindrance to their Ti preference of operating.  Any type can understand any function on some level even if it is more intuitively than consciously or more learned than experienced.     I think that this ""switch"" is what causes a lot of people to be confused by their typing.  Just like you said, I also appear to switch given different situations.  INTPs are said to be great at reading situations, but not people so much.  They call this the chameleon effect sometimes.  I could be confused for an INTJ at work or an ENTP at a party.  Both Ti-Fe and Te-Fi types claim to do this, but I think for Ti-Fe types the motivation is to behave appropriately and harmoniously in your given environment, while your perceiving functions give you the ""how"" to connect to others. You can play the game and do what you need to do at school since you've had umpteen years of conditioning to function in their world.  You don't change and the system doesn't change, just your response to this dynamic changes as you create a model of its behavior in your mind and learn how to manipulate to your advantage.    By the way, I don't think you should worry about whether you are Ne or Ni.  Your Ne couldn't be more obvious."

I'm always insecure about that because of friends I grew up with thought I was crazy for being so off topic in my communication, but now I realize it's likely they were just sensing types.  Also, I always felt like I was switching between types, but I see how what you're saying here is more accurate and to the point. It's a whole lot of blending into social situations, and it can be exhausting. I think the reason why I felt like I 'switched' was because sometimes after those events requiring imitation of other cognitive functions I would sometimes retain them for a while after. Like, I recently took a summer class, and almost felt like I lost myself in that environment - it was so busy, and the need to perform like an S or J was nearly insurmountable. I almost felt like I lost some INTPness. But as the days go on, it's coming back."

This is where the noise decreases when you increase the frequency of a system. In most physical systems, as you get faster, you get more friction. Clearly this wasn't straightforward and required an intuitive leap. So I went and said ""Hey, I've got an analogy. Consider a triangular block of ice at the top of a snowy hill. As you roll it faster, it becomes smoother, turning into a sphere as it rolls. So as the frequency of rotation increases, the noise decreases.""  That's a clear example of when I used my Ni."

mbti,3du7lv,Camti5,2,Sun Jul 19 15:44:58 2015 UTC,I have more or less identified myself as HSP and I think this is partly why I'm so confused. I'm new to this mbti stuff and guess I wrongly assumed that INTP and hyper sensitivity can't exist together.
mbti,3du7lv,Camti5,3,Sun Jul 19 15:55:54 2015 UTC,"It's a weird combination, but it's not impossible. Though I agree that it's more than a bit confusing since HSP makes people touchy-feely, which seems like an INFP trait more than an INTP one. Looking at your description of yourself you seem like you use Ti (INTP's first function) rather than Fi (INFP's first function) in your life.  Source: my life."
mbti,3du7lv,jermofo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:11:03 2015 UTC,Sounds like your probably right. What really through me off is that I read somewhere that intp's don't truly care about other people or the world in general which was probably a misguided post because I feel I do more than most.
mbti,3du7lv,intprecipitation,3,Sun Jul 19 16:42:06 2015 UTC,"You should look into interior Fe for an INTP.  Understanding how this works is probably the most constructive thing an INTP can achieve with MBTI.  Here is a good link that explains how it works:  http://personalitycafe.com/intp-articles/76783-recognizing-inferior-function-intp.html  About 3/4's down the page, there is an explanation of Hyper-sensitivity in relationships.  If you really are an INTP as it would appear to me, this should really resonate with you and explain why you might think you are an INFP and more importantly how to handle your emotions in a more healthy manner."
mbti,3du7lv,bezald,2,Sun Jul 19 23:08:14 2015 UTC,"I think INTPs care about humanity at large, but are not that concerned with specific people as much. Maybe when problems are presented, or the INTP can glean some sort of introspective insight from the person. But beyond that we can generally care less about most people until they have something interesting to say.  I mean, INTPs dont want to see people hurt, but they aren't going to sit and listen to someone talk nonsense to them for hours just because they feel its the right thing to do. A lot of F types will do things just because they know the emotion communicated by their action will have a positive effect. Whereas a T type will just do whats rational, especially an INTP.  A quick example, my g/f is an F type, she bought these bird pellets labeled as a 'super food' from the vet because she wants to do whats best for the bird, and also wanted to communicate to the vet she was a good pet owner. I tried to convince her to not buy them because they were just upselling her. She still thought it was a good idea for the bird, and wanted what was best for him. Too bad he didn't like them when we got home."
mbti,3du7lv,Poropopper,2,Mon Jul 20 00:04:50 2015 UTC,"the vast majority of people who ask this question are INFP. this is because INTPs are dom-Ti and have Fe last in the stack... they are naturally very emotionally detached and generally won't confuse themselves for a feeler; it's not that INTPs don't have emotions, it's that their emotions are very compartmentalized and not used for decision making (generally not to be trusted/ often inaccessible and totally bewildering), and values are a foreign thing. INTPs certainly are not 'sensitive'  or emotionally self-aware like INFPs often are, for this reason.   since INTPs are domTi-Ne, their default state is one of constantly comparing different logical systems and turning over pieces of logic in their head. while INFPs use logic like all people do, may strongly value logic (and may have developed Te), INTPs live and breathe logic; they are wizards at it. Descriptions also don't do a good job of conveying how dom-Ti-Ne is all about logical systems not just general logic. it is an incredibly specific process. INTPs are obsessed with logical precision in all that they do.  another reason why so many INFPs mistype as INTPs is because dom-Fi is so nebulous and personal to the person: some INFPs are very aware of their values and for others it's a bit murkier. and as i've said, many INFPs value logic and can be good at it (and many INFPs have more logic-oriented goals like computer programmers) but it's not the same as having Dom-Ti-Ne."
mbti,3du7lv,intprecipitation,2,Sun Jul 19 18:54:58 2015 UTC,"I remember early on as a child not being able to understand why anyone would treat another person poorly, I was described by teachers as good natured (F). When I realised that the world didn't work this way later on in my teens I more or less made a conscious effort to be more of a dick.   When I was younger, I could never ever be a dick, if I did something I didn't feel was 'right' I would feel extremely guilty and I can never forget that guilt. I still can't be a dick, if I really feel that I need to criticize someone I need to word it as tactfully as possible, I try to appeal to their feelings so that they can accept the criticism and grow.   I asked a friend the other day what they thought would happen if all people were the same person...abstract T question? Whether we'd all be able to get along (F)? Or if situational inconsistencies would just reproduce a similar situation to the world today (T).   These questions you asked are purely N, remember T/F is about decisions, it's more relevant to consider what made you want to ask those questions to your friends?   In high school a teacher got mad at me for not supporting the school by playing shot-put as I was a strong kid. My reply was that I didn't see the point of seeing how far I could toss a metal ball. Teacher now more mad. I have also always had a problem with authority which I have recognised and try to deal with to a certain extent but being told what to do just pisses me off however immature that may be.   This sounds like T, the teacher is trying to appeal to your ideals as if you were F but what you needed was a logical explanation of why you should throw a metal ball. When they wanted me to compete in sports for my school, I put my name down and did my best because I felt it was right and that I was a 'hero' for putting myself forward when nobody else wanted to, in spite of how shy I was.

So overtime I developed the ability to see the good in everyone else, and instead of criticizing all of them and finding what was wrong with them, I found what was right. Ever since I realized that I just see someone as having a different perspective than me, rather than them being stupid. Although, if I am offended or frustrated enough I go right back to who I was before these revelations and the dickdom comes out, and I don't feel bad at all.

It's more about holistic structures. I've said that it's like making a model out of tinker toys. I've heard other INTPs say it's like doing a jigsaw puzzle.   It's easy for us to spot logical inconsistencies because we can see them - we see our internal structure doing something topologically impossible.   The ""irrelevancy"" thing that other people have mentioned is like being handed a piece that won't fit or has no use in your structure. So you just toss it aside.   It's also very hard for us to communicate our ideas, because our ideas are multi-dimensional, and human speech is linear. We tend to be underappreciated because it takes a lot of effort for us to communicate our ideas, so we aren't going to talk about them with others unless we're sure it's going to be worth the effort.   And we tend to be accused of being grammar nazis, but that's because muddy language hands us malformed pieces. Different terms have different ""shapes,"" and handing us the wrong shape irritates us. It's like asking for a Phillips head screwdriver and being handed a socket wrench.  For us, the search for truth means building a mental model of a target system that is an accurate reflection of the reality of the target system. While we do enjoy seeing if our model of the target system is accurate enough to allow us to correctly manipulate the system, we're not really motivated to do anything with our model. Building that model is its own reward.  http://personalitycafe.com/intp-forum-thinkers/80144-ti-what.html"

This is gonna sound kinda crazy, but I've read that some new age thinkers believe there are more and more HSP's because of a transition the solar system is experiencing through the galactic plane of the galaxy, and the levels of electromagnetism experienced by earth dwellers is shifting. This is resulting in more people with abnormally high levels of exposure to the 'energy that shapes our brains/personalities.' I know it sounds crazy, right? Most scientists will say we haven't passed through this plane yet, but it's interesting to consider some information from ancient cultures suggests otherwise. I digress...  Anyways, I identify with what you're saying here, and have felt like every type at any given time. Well, all except J's. I feel like an INFP and INTP when I think about spirituality and where I feel my place is in the world, I feel like an INTP when I am working through problems or am alone, I feel like an ISTP in school, and feel like an ENTP around people I don't know. I seem to use Ni/Se around unfamiliar situations, as a sort of safety net. These are shadow functions for me, but people are more accepting of me when I play this role. Maybe you do this too?  Why that, what I just mentioned is important is that it's representative of an INTP at the most basic level - the inherent detached nature of the INTP, being able to step aside from his own ego and view other type's perspectives. Albeit, not as effectively - they are just imitations. As an INTP, one is capable of imitating other types by exploring their own shadow functions and recognizing the usefulness of each function, even if these shadow functions present discomfort at first. Being an HSP makes it that much easier to explore one's feelings, and recognize subtleties within each nuanced feeling or sensation. HSPs also experience a lot of anxiety, as the world around them is very active, stimulating and loud. This forces a lot of HSPs to interact with their inner demons, and either learn to control them, harmonize in a beneficial way with them, or they could just be obliterated by them. I think the INTP is a really good type to take up the task of harmonizing with all of the things that come along with being an HSP.  Shadow functions are actually the only things I've found that are convincing of me being an INTP. Sometimes looking at shadow functions can help you the most in determining type, check them out..   So at the end of the day, you might just be an HSP INTP, which in my opinion is a great thing to be."

The wing is like a flavoring mixed into your main type. Type 5 is the intellectual, scared of being incapable.  You'll act like a 6w5 INTJ most of the time but if this behavior doesn't get you what you want then you'll shift to 3w4 strategies. Type 3 is focused on success (whatever you deem success to be; it doesn't always mean career) with a fear of being worthless while 4 wishes to be unique.  Finally if neither 6w5 or 3w4 is doing it for you then you'll have to become 1w2. Type 1 is the perfectionist while type 2 is the helper.  Tritype can be pretty complicated and confusing if you're just starting out with Enneagram... I'd focus on learning about your main type first.

mbti,3dtjsy,aLiamInvader,9,Sun Jul 19 08:58:50 2015 UTC,"It is completely expected of the test results to change over time, even depending on the day. The tests are, at best, pointers to finding your stable type.  The long explanation goes something like this:  There's two main ways to assign yourself a type / get yourself a type code.  The first is assigning yourself four letters by taking a test (or doing it yourself), the second figuring out what cognitive functions (~=go-to habits for taking in, evaluating and organizing information) you use. Both give you the same kind of code because the approaches have a lot of shared history, but the meaning behind the code is different because of how it's arrived at.   Using a test or otherwise looking into the four dichotomies to get a code and then look what kind of functions you're supposed to use from that is usually a bad idea (for example, I often get IxTP results from tests - this would mean I use Ti, which I don't - I'm a very clear Te type). Despite being different, both of these approaches give you valuable information but should be kept separate because they mean very, very different things.  The tests / dichotomatic approach ranks you on four different scales that are more or less separate from each other - ie. your score on one shouldn't influence your score on the others much at all. Having only a slight preference one way or another here is normal, and actually pretty much expected. The test results tend to fluctuate a good bit as well, especially so if you have only mild preferences one way or another - mood, the day, the alignment of the stars and whether your cat clawed your eyes out in the morning all become a large influence in your responses - the consistent factor is in being the middle, not the preference to P/J or the like.  What the test letters mean, roughly: I/E = introverted/extroverted. Do you like being out and about, esp. around people. N/S = Abstract-minded or concrete person. F/T = Do you go more on sentiment and accomodate others or reason in a cold, detached way. P/J = How organized, scheduled, conscientious you are. The more P, the more disorganized and spontaneous, the more J, the more organized and planned.      Each of these scales has a bunch of subgroups, or facets that measure some different traits that get put under whatever letter heading, so you don't need to embody any one dimension fully to get a score on it.  If looking at this, it makes sense how eg. getting a job would make you seem more J - and by the test's measure, you are - and the results of the dichotomatic test actually told you something useful about yourself. But I wouldn't use them to assign yourself a functional type. The test results fluctuating also makes it kind of odd to try to assign a type code based on a 50% split on the scale, so I'd probably just take a Big 5 test - it tells you how high you score on some things but presents the results in a way that gives away that they're meant to be fluid, doesn't split the scales, measures more or less the same four things as the MBTI test does, and includes a fifth scale that measures how swingy or stable your emotional state is, which is obviously useful information.  To explain that better, let's look at the other way to get a type code: figuring out what functions you use.  The functional approach is a rough model that tries to explain how you take in, evaluate and organize information by dividing the information processing into four core processes (Thinking, Feeling, Sensing and iNtuition) each of which has two attitudes (ie. extraversion, or interest in the external world, and introversion, ie. interest in what is going on inside your head) and then figuring out which processes you use in what attitudes. They're often shortened to a function code of Core process and Attitude, ie. Sensing in the extroverted attitude = Se.  Two examples would be an inclination to use the Thinking function focusing more on personal models, their accuracy and looking for root causes (introverted Thinking, Ti) or the state of the outside world or analyzed system, exerting control over it and making the most of what you have (extroverted Thinking, Te), or using Feeling to focus more on the harmony of the group and people's expressions of sentiment (extroverted Feeling, Fe) or on being true to yourself and looking at the motivations behind expressions of sentiment (introverted Feeling, Fi).  To contrast why it's important to focus on the meaning behind the code rather than the code itself, Test/Dichotomatic ENTP v. ENTJ, for example, is basically asking whether the person is more haphazard and spontaneous or more planned, conscientious and orderly - it's directly what the tests measure and the types differ only on one scale. They're both extroverts and iNtuitive Thinkers.  In Function-land, where we look at how the person takes in, evaluates and organizes information, the meaning is different. Here we find that ENTPs and ENTJs use an entirely different set of processes:  ENTPs are primarily watchers who lead with extroverted Intuition (Ne) - it's an exploring, brainstorming kind of process that draws its inspiration from the outside world and is very interested in it, and complement that with Ti - an evaluating process that focuses on building accurate mental models of things. How the cogs turn is more important than what that turning accomplishes.  ENTJs lead with extroverted Thinking or Te - cold, detached reasoning like Ti, but focused on evaluating the properties of the outside world and exerting control over it, usually with the aim of ordering it to be more efficient. They complement this with introverted Intuition, which in contrast to Ne's curious exploration just drinks in tons of information and subconsciously finds patterns in there that it then condenses it into a holistic understanding of how something ticks that the Ni type himself often needs to work to ""map out"".  In short, they're totally different :D  Same applies to INTP vs. INFP - in test-land the difference is a slight preference to Thinking or Feeling type items in the questionnaire, but in Function-land an INTPs primary processes are Ti (dominant/compulsive) and Ne (auxiliary/habitual), while INFPs lead with Fi and use Ne as auxiliary - they share the habitual process and their dominant function is introspective, evaluative in nature so their minds are kind of similar in construction, but the compulsive, dominant process is different which is a very large change.  INTP/INTJ is another good example: Functionally, INTPs lead with Ti and use auxiliary Ne, while INTJs are a mirror of the ENTJ - they lead with Ni and support it with Te. Their whole stacks are completely different (Ti-Ne-Si-Fe vs. Ni-Te-Fi-Se), even if the overall orientation and interests often end up being similar (they're both introverted systems thinker types, after all).  tl;dr: Same code, different meaning. Keep them separate, and they will be useful to you. Try to force them to align, and you'll only confuse yourself or end up acting in a non-genuine way.  If you're interested in learning functional typology after that explanation:  Lessons on functions-based typology by Michael Pierce is easily one of the best introductions to functional typology I have ever seen, and certainly made the mess of jargon click for me when I started.  Celebritytypes has good comparison tables for the different functions - this is probably good to look at side by side with Pierce's introductory videos.

mbti,3dtjsy,Komatik,2,Sun Jul 19 09:36:49 2015 UTC,"Is this from an FAQ I missed somewhere? Very detailed and makes a lot of sense, but I'll need to read it again when I'm a little less tired. I thought I saw a pattern in your examples (J means TF takes priority, I means N/S becomes Ne/Se, but that was only true for ENTJ, oops).  I take your point here to mean that I could show up as INTJ or INTP depending on the day I'm having and thus how I see the world - the core NT doesn't change, but the way it's expressed does."
mbti,3dtjsy,Komatik,3,Sun Jul 19 10:30:42 2015 UTC,"It's a post skeleton I use to explain these things to beginners - the questions are very, very common but short answers would at worst just confuse people more.  The core point is: There's two approaches. Keep them separate. Test => Code (INTP/INTJ) => The code means ""this person is an introverted systems thinker, P/J tells whether you're more orderly and conscientious or spontaneous keep options open type"".  There is another way to get a code, ie. look at how you process information, which can get you an INTP or INTJ code, but the meaning of that code is completely unrelated because it's in a different language. To use an analogy, both Finnish and Estonian have the word ""hallitus"" in them. Problem is, in Finnish it means ""government"" and in Estonian it means ""mold"". That is the kind of difference we're dealing with here. The code ""INTP"" has a different meaning depending on the language we speak. Tests speak one language, the functions-oriented approach a different one.  Read it when you're more awake and focus on the two languages thing. If something is still unclear, ask away."
mbti,3dtjsy,MinatoCauthon,2,Sun Jul 19 12:20:12 2015 UTC,"A note that the tests work for some people a lot better than others. I managed to type 2/3 of my friends accurately using the test on www.16personalities.com (checking with cognitive functions later), but as for myself (ENTP), I keep testing as INFP, which is absolutely ridiculous from a functional standpoint.   So I'd say, take the test, check the description (does it match?), but then DEFINITELY double-check with the functions. I related to the INFP description to a large extent, but eh... I think I was self-projecting way too much. Projecting is a massive problem when reading descriptions, since you think ""this is me"" and cherry-pick everything that fits, skimming over everything that does not. So, be aware, and be cautious. First time I read the ENTP description, I already had the idea in my mind that ""this is not me"" which affected my judgement.   So, good luck. Cognitive functions are less likely to leave you with a projection problem, so I'd recommend those for sure. May take a while for you to get to grips with them though. (Took me several months to understand the difference between Ni and Ne).   Good luck!"
mbti,3dtjsy,intprecipitation,2,Sun Jul 19 10:37:12 2015 UTC,"I would look at the cognitive functions, because as you age you are going to nurture different aspects of your personality. A change in type is good, because it means you are seeing different traits as valuable, you are evolving into or on your path to recognizing your truest type. I've always felt we are the same types from a young age, but we imitate others as we grow older and learn to appreciate our shadow functions. So, I don't think the type changes, just the perception of who one is. understanding different cognitive functions helps to understand how these traits evolve.  A quick example, an INTP learning to develop his Fe might look like an INFP on tests, because in those years of developing that trait he is focusong on his feelings and trying to understand them. So he might be inclined to test towards that characteristic.  It's also helpful to recognize when cognitive functions are imitating others. I sometimes feel like my Ne is just pretending to understanding emotions, and so instead of really knowing my Fe, I just have a superficial understanding of it, that feels real."
mbti,3dtjsy,agitatedzergling,2,Mon Jul 20 00:24:09 2015 UTC,It's common for people to think they might be INTP after being typed a different way for a time because eventually most people realize that is the best personality and they want to be it.

""I am not a good enough writer to have an agenda or come up with a message and try to put it into a song. It's more like you write what comes to you... You try to reflect the mood of the songs."" ""I just have this deep kind of connection to reality of being like... in a way, I feel like a dock worker. I want to stay in connection with my dock-worker side, 'cause that's how I grew up."" ""When you're out in the desert, you can't believe the amount of stars. We've sent mechanisms out there, and they haven't found anything. They've found different colours of sand, and rings, and gasses, but nobody's shown me anything that makes me feel secure in what happens afterwards. All I really believe in is this moment, like right now.”   Won't believe anything unless he has directly experienced it himself, suggesting preference for S over N and also Se/Ni rather than Si/Ne, doesn't seem particularly interested in categorising experiences at all, seems to like raw experience itself. Likes to spend lots of time in nature, just experiencing.  2   ""Let me be as weird as I fuckin' like. It's my fuckin' life."" ""I'm not ready to be that guy who can meet with world leaders and all that. It's tremendous what Bono does. I don't know if I could do it, not the way he does. I don't think many people could. The physicality of what Bono does, the physicality of like, meeting with Mitterrand and then going and playing Sweden that night, and then more shows after that... I've told him that I was in awe of what he did, not only what he accomplished, but how he fuckin' did it, from the point of taxing his body. I told him this, and he kind of raised his eyebrows and asked for another drink.""   Both F types have strongly held values, but Fe people are more comfortable adapting to the world around them whereas Fi people have to maintain their integrity and be themselves. So for somebody like Bono (ENFJ), it's easy for them to go out and get involved in loads of tacky events and things in order to instigate change in the world. Fi types, not so much, although they care about changing the world just as much, they don't like to lead people and thus don't really want to become the figurehead for social change in the same way an Fe person like Bono would. To an Fi person this kinda diminishes their humanity and individuality and so on.  Interestingly, Thom Yorke (INFP) has the same to say about Bono -    ""The difference between me and Bono is that he's quite happy to go and flatter people to get what he wants and he's very good at it, but I just can't do it. I'd probably end up punching them in the face rather than shaking their hand, so it's best that I stay out of their way. I can't engage with that level of bullshit. Which is a shame, really, and in a way it would help if I could, but I just can't. I admire the fact that Bono can, and can walk away from it smelling of roses.""   3  I think we can just call him an introvert without discussing it. He is feeling over thinking, sensing over intuition, and Fi over Fe, so this only leaves us with ISFP. Battle with Ticketmaster, refusing to do any promotional videos etc. suggests inferior Te."

People think of infjs as being special snowflakes that wear all black and read Poe, but really they are much more concerned with blending in than you'd think.    A few more differences I've read about are that Fe users are agenda-driven, while Fi users have no agenda.  Fe users are guided by values they assume others to have, too, while Fi users typically recognize that everyone has their own set of values.  Fe users seem to usually have a stronger sense of ""right and wrong"", while Fi users believe in situational ""rights and wrongs"".  Fe users focus on collective ""group"" relationships, while Fi users focus on individual relationships.    So, an infj might seem to be very focused on ""shoulds"" of a situation.  Their morals are usually part of a collective whole for them, and they assume that their values are part of a shared, undeniable truth.  Plus, they're more likely to focus on groups of friends than individual relationships.  Infps would seem a little less judgey; they usually believe in situational judgements, and recognize their morals might not be shared.  They focus on individual friendships, and are less concerned with fitting in."
mbti,3drkr6,aint_it_strange,4,Sat Jul 18 20:29:40 2015 UTC,"Hmmm...  I wholeheartedly believe that there are underlying and absolute truths that everyone should adhere to.

mbti,3drkr6,Skryym,2,Sun Jul 19 15:11:30 2015 UTC,"You know, I think I do, too.  They're very simple truths, but I wholeheartedly believe people should be good to each other.  However, I see the buts; people should be good to each other unless it puts them in danger.  No situation is without nuances to me.  I believe the world is too complicated for absolute truths, I guess.    As far as individuality goes, infjs are often very interested in individuality, and often like individualistic types a lot.  They see themselves as an individual, like you describe, but I think the difference is that they tend to focus on how they relate to the group.  An Fi user will focus on one-on-one relationships, typically."
mbti,3drkr6,aint_it_strange,3,Sun Jul 19 16:06:28 2015 UTC,"I like to think that I'm strictly focused on one-on-one relationships...  but thinking back, I'll sacrifice ""perfect"" loyalty to one person if its for the betterment of the group.  Meaning that, while I don't like to admit it, I value group harmony over individual harmony.  This is certainly true toward myself, as I always put other people first.  I can't stand the guilt otherwise."
mbti,3drkr6,Skryym,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:12:22 2015 UTC,"haha right.  It's not that an Fe user doesn't make intimate, close friendships, it's that they feel very loyal(?) to group harmony.  Like, I've had fights with friends, and it doesn't matter if nobody else agrees.  A fight with a friend is a fight with a friend; I won't not speak my mind just because I'm the only one.  On the other hand, if the whole group is mad at one friend, I won't take their side just to appease them, you know?"

mbti,3drkr6,MrJudzey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"I'm just reiterating the literature on Fi and Fe.  It's not that they have no agenda, but that they're less agenda driven.  For example, I'm an infp and my boyfriend's an infj.  He doesn't see much of a point in not being productive; if he spends a day without exercising or working on his hobbies, it totally bums him out.  I, on the other hand, like a good leisure day once in a while.  I have no problem doing things without an agenda."
mbti,3drkr6,aint_it_strange,3,Sun Jul 19 15:59:16 2015 UTC,"I understand. In my view I would consider personal and hidden motivations to manifest much differently between Fi and Fe. An Fi user might have unknown individualistic intentions (such as a stereotypical ENTP agreeing to one thing and going off and doing his/her own thing). An Fe user might extrovert his intentions to exert control.  In your example (which is a clear example) your dominant function is introverted judging. So the judging is for it's own sake. This leads to the authenticity in so far as it is observed in Fi doms. Fe clearly is  not judging for its own sake, but for effect. So clearly the agenda is much more obvious in Fe, and in particular Fe doms.  I don't want to give you the impression that I'm senselessly contradicting or agreeing with you. Overall I agree, but I originally mistook your statement for a personal misunderstanding so I've elucidated what I meant given the new context."
mbti,3drkr6,MrJudzey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:52:38 2015 UTC,I have a big tendency to act in a certain way to get a certain outcome without being open about my intentions. So i guess that's Fe?
mbti,3drkr6,MrJudzey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:01:10 2015 UTC,"It can be a sign of an extroverted judging function (Fe/Te) but it depends on general context. I will often try to make people feel at ease, or be a bit stern if there's a sentiment I find toxic. Both of these are for effect. An Fi dom will be concerned as to whether or not it's an authentic action (or internally consistent for Ti), rather than pejoratively for effect (though if you go by socionics they're adept at this anyway but prefer not to).  Fe in Fe doms is usually for effect: ""the greater good"" -Tony Blair, ex UK prime minister. Fe in INFJs will most likely be used to show people an Ni insight or vision effectively. ENFJs will also say ""he thinks this... she thinks that"" rather than consulting an internal framework first (Ni, secondary). INFJs will consult that framework first.   The result is that an Fe dom wants to affect feeling based control and influence. An INFJ will want to communicate their vision for how things are and should be like."

mbti,3drkr6,SquirmGirl,3,Sun Jul 19 15:08:54 2015 UTC,"Everything you just described is 100% Fe. Fe values group harmony over individual harmony, but can also get down on itself for not being more ""genuine"" in how it presents itself to the world.   Ie: ""I do good deeds because that's what a good person does and it's  the right thing to do, not because I value being a good person and think it's the right thing to do."" The latter is true of Fi.  Have you identified your other three functions? INFJ and INFP actually use a different set. In order to be INFJ, you would also need to be using introverted intuition (Ni) as your dominant function, introverted thinking (Ti) as your tertiary, and extroverted sensing (Se) as your inferior. INFP uses Fi+Ne+Si+Te :)"

Well said. I know an ENFP (famous for being fierce individualists and expressing their unique personality?) who is in high school at the moment. She does all she can to fit in with her friends, and act like them, which got her in a fair amount of trouble. She often gets advised to express her difference from them, but she feels she can't because no-one would accept her then. Even so, I've heard that she wants to rebel and feel like an individual, but rarely expresses these feelings in real life. Not sure she even fully realizes them day by day.  So yeah.

mbti,3drkr6,BadgerKid96,3,Sat Jul 18 20:39:26 2015 UTC,"Introverted feelers can be very reputation conscious, especially when they fear being misunderstood. The stereotype about INFPs having quirky attire could stem from that, for example. Their combination of introverted feeling (Fi) and extroverted intuition (Ne) often results in an intentionally unique look.  The results are different, but I understand this tendency as an INTJ, too. I like to dress to the standards that my extroverted thinking (Te) sets for me, which usually means conservative attire and no bright colors. Guess I'll also add that I'm motivated to do community work because I care about what others think—looking good on paper and making sure no one can't point fingers is a priority for me. Doing something for my reputation is doing something for myself.  You're not all wrong and this stereotype I'm citing isn't always true, but it's common for introverted feelers to be especially conscious about how others perceive them. I can attest to it even as someone who isn't very emotional."

I am fascinated by their ability to play people like musical instruments, objective and curious enough to be aware of it, yet emotionally immature enough to fall under their spell very fast and hard. I can realize there is a virus in the system, but I can't do anything about it. The level and type of relationship doesn't matter. You guys are wizards, using feels like the force.

mbti,3dp1a6,DarcyRouge,4,Sat Jul 18 04:31:13 2015 UTC,"No. Secret mental advantage. The material world is always changing, choatic, and unpredictable. A perceptive disposition is indispensable to prevail against the universe's merciless flux.   The world may be constantly changing (that's what time is, anyways), but randomness only exists if you don't know the algorithm. On the contrary, you need to be able to create a flexible model that manipulates chaos to your whim using the facets of the random world generator that you are aware of.  And ENTJs are renowned for just that :)   However the world of truth and ideas is timeless and unchanging. With my inward judging ilness advantage I form the incorrigible principles and establish the intellectual closure which cause me to be the unwavering force to be reckoned you see here today.   So instead of trying to convince me I'm wrong, you're trying to convince me that I'm right by declaring yourself a user of firm objective logic and subjective intuitive perception.  Welcome, brother."
mbti,3dp1a6,cujo26,2,Sat Jul 18 04:43:23 2015 UTC,"And ENTJs are renowned for just that :)   Indeed. I work with an ENTJ right now. He comes in quite handy. He has a very particular set of skills, skills he acquired over a very long career. Skills that make him a nightmare for people with a competing vision or can't-do attitude.   This ""algorithm"" talk intrigues me, yet I remain unimpressed. The world is chiefly inhabited by social beings called homo sapien. And their social reality is notoriously difficult to predict, explain, or micro-manage. Algorithms don't work with people. Better leave those for geological models and pure mathematics.  Prove me wrong.   So instead of trying to convince me I'm wrong, you're trying to convince me that I'm right   You are not right. You are not wrong. You are out of order. You have everything going for you except a preference to apply judging outward, which ranges from impractical to dysfunctional, rather than making use of it inward, where it belongs and performs most admirably.  You're not a bad person. You're just not INTP. It's ok. I would rank #1 personality INTP obviously. But really ENTJ is at least #2 or #3. It's a toss up in my mind right now, but its definitely way up there, I mean, that is something to feel good about tho."

mbti,3dp1a6,corsetxcandy,27,Sat Jul 18 17:04:19 2015 UTC,"No INTP is best. I can easily prove it. Do you want to be introverted or extroverted? Obviously introverted. Check.

An ENTP, with discipline, can learn to reign in the distractions of Ne with a spartan, studious environment and hone his logical and analytical skills. A quiet library and a math book is a good start.   Conversely an INTP cannot as readily hone Ne because that requires you not to analyze but instead let your imagination wander very broadly (beyond opening up more browser tabs and lokking into new subreddits).  You must close the math book and get out of the library and initiate interaction with novel (and contrary) perspectives and ideas.  You are impeded in interacting socially with other people by quaternary Fe with respect to an ENTP.  I maintain it is far easier for an ENTP to learn to focus and consolidate his thoughts, than it is for an INTP to expand their imaginative capabilities and social skills.  And hence to power up the Ne + Ti potential to its fullest."

I recently started a really interesting and fulfilling job, but it is still boring and mildly tedious a lot of the time. That is why it is a job and not an amusement park.  Finally, separate joy and a rush of happiness from fundamental long-term contentment. The latter is ultimately what keeps your spirits high and gives life a sense of meaning, but it's nothing glamorous. It's not like the thrill of a rollercoaster ride or an interesting puzzle or the taste of something really delicious. It's just a simple, unexciting feeling of being fine."

mbti,3dpo6c,curiousitykilledyou,6,Sat Jul 18 06:08:06 2015 UTC,"I haven't personally noticed this, but I'll take a crack at analyzing it anyway.  Intuitive-doms (Ne and Ni) may be prone to romantic/idealistic fantasies about love more than feeling-doms (who use Fe and Fi) because these functions naturally want to explore many different possibilities and ideas. Ni is more in it's own world/imagination with this, and will often contemplate how their life would look if they were with x partner, or a different partner than who they are with currently. Hell, I'm guilty of having fantasized over people who don't even exist! I believe this to be why INFJs are prone to feeling unfulfilled in their relationships. Ne, on the other hand, is focused externally, and is likely to actually engage in many different relationships, ultimately having a hard time settling down because someone else always seems better, or more ideal.  Granted, what you're talking about may just be based on ENFPs and INFJs you've known, personally. Remember, not everyone on the internet claiming to be either of these types is necessarily those types. In reality, all the NFs, as idealists, are particularly prone to obsessing over ""fantasy"" type romance :)"
mbti,3dpo6c,SquirmGirl,3,Sat Jul 18 07:22:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think escaping reality the way you describe it is either Ne nor Ni related. Ni would be more, ""I envision myself to be with this person other than that person"", whereas Ne would be more, ""I wonder what this person I am not dating right now but seems really interesting is like? It would be very fun to try and date that person"" kind of deal."
mbti,3dpo6c,Entr0pic08,5,Sat Jul 18 09:59:51 2015 UTC,"Granted, I didn't use such specific examples, but I don't quite see how your interpretation of Ne and Ni is all that different from what I wrote.  Edit: Scratch that. I went back and reread what I wrote, and I can see where you disagreed with me. It's mostly related to how I described Ne, no?   The example I provided assumes that Ne actually engages in many relationships, rather than simply wonders about what it would be like to date that person. I have to assume that both are technically possible, but I didn't mean to imply that even the most immature of Ne-users exclusively flit recklessly from relationship to relationship and are never satisfied. I think any unhealthy type is prone to this behavior.  I'm not an Ne user. I understand enough about it that I can effectively witness it in everyday settings, but I don't consider myself the highest authority to understand how it manifests at it's core. That being said, any Ne user is free to correct me if they feel I've made any mistakes in describing its process.  Ni is indeed a very visual process, so while Ne may wonder about the many possibilities of dating different people, Ni can actually envision it. You're definitely correct there."
mbti,3dpo6c,SquirmGirl,3,Sat Jul 18 22:28:16 2015 UTC,"Well the F dominant types probably have a more nuanced view of it, so it is more good and bad, shades of grey for them. Whereas with the N dominant types they find it easier to run away with a massive story in their head about how it's this wonderful special fantastic thing.  We have obviously been meeting different ENFPs though, the ones I know aren't obsessed with love, if anything they are quite cold and closed off towards it."
mbti,3dpo6c,CmdBelial,8,Sat Jul 18 11:19:34 2015 UTC,"Don't agree.

mbti,3doi7r,TrantaLocked,8,Fri Jul 17 23:16:20 2015 UTC,"Ti users feel emotional pain (or any equivalent mental pain)   It's different. I can link it to the need of competence, because our model/scheme of the of the situation/subject has to reflect what it is in order for the user to understand it correctly, which is paramount to our usually mental flow. Breaking it means it is incorrect and has to be restructured immediately, that's why we need time to get back and reevaluate the situation. But at the same time it's also tied to perceiving which isn't correct/incorrect, it's given more leeway and freedom to abstract away for the schematic to be reformed.  Since Ti-models try to reflect reality through a subjective lens, it's like telling us a fact doesn't exist, when it totally does, you either don't see it and don't understand it. This is where the stubbornness can kick in and just be a misunderstanding, until the other party provides a convincing argument, the disagreement won't cease, and when it does, it would be ""agree to disagree"".  Now including values and juggling them... that's a whole 'nother ordeal. It's hyper emotionalism, trying to fit values in a utilitarian mind model just does.not.work, like ever. It causes a short circuit, breakdown and incessant nagging doubt that everything you knew, everything you've ever done has been false. Causes extreme anxiety and and introverted loop of amplifying negative feedback into laws. it's not about just feeling bad, it's a mental breakdown from top to bottom. Te users would lash out when they do not reach the desirable goal, while Ti users would breakdown themselves since their entire being has become a ""lie"".  That's why IXTPs are laid back and don't really engage emotionally with other's as much. Yes, we are helpful, but it's the essence of the problem that truly fascinates us.  PS: Can and ISTP chime in and offer the Ti-Se perspective? It'd be very interesting to see what doesn't overlap."
mbti,3doi7r,CritSrc,2,Fri Jul 17 23:54:42 2015 UTC,"This is a very interesting comment.    I can link it to the need of competence   This is the fundamental drive of the Enneagram 5 type, which is very common for IxTx types to have (excluding ISTJ who are more commonly type 6).   Since Ti-models try to reflect reality through a subjective lens, it's like telling us a fact doesn't exist, when it totally does, you either don't see it and don't understand it. This is where the stubbornness can kick in and just be a misunderstanding, until the other party provides a convincing argument, the disagreement won't cease, and when it does, it would be ""agree to disagree"".   Sounds to me like Ni + Te. Ni is all about subjective lenses in perceiving reality, Te assesses whether external logic is true/false, and whether something is logically consistent. INTJ can be stubborn in arguments because they think conclusively and in terms of facts. They may then withdraw later and use their Ni to re-contemplate the situation from an alternative perspective and reevaluate their standpoint. Ne is open to possibilities, Ne does not typically think in this style, everything is possible, never fully discounting a point. Ti likes to see the alternative side of an argument and try to understand how it is formed and look for the fundamental points where their viewpoints differ.   Te users would lash out when they do not reach the desirable goal, while Ti users would breakdown themselves since their entire being has become a ""lie"".   Yes I find this very true, though MBTI does not cover emotional states, in the case that someone is neurotic, this is how Ti/Te typically acts. Ti breaking themselves down and reassessing their system vs Te lashing out at illogicality."
mbti,3doi7r,Poropopper,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:08:18 2015 UTC,"This is the fundamental drive of the Enneagram 5 type   Yep, that's me. Very common for INTPs, the description I read even pointed to Jung's Ti as an analogy.   Ni is all about subjective lenses in perceiving reality   Like I said:   Ti-models try to reflect reality   Meaning it can never be done completely, but it's a way of understanding, and unlike Ni everything is defined, everything is known, it's not a recollection of elements that always flow, it's a static web of strongly defined models.   Ti likes to see the alternative side of an argument and try to understand how it is formed and look for the fundamental points where their viewpoints differ.   That's because it is built anew and if it ""makes sense"" logically to the user who has come to understand it fundamentally, seeing how the models works holistically, then the argument will be approved, implemented and adapted.   in the case that someone is neurotic   Ti trying to structure around inferior Fe really made me neurotic at moments, but hey, that's adolescent love for ya."

There are thinkers who are lazy and living on welfare and feelers who are leaders of organizations and create entertainment that makes a lot of people happy. It doesn't matter that some people make some illogical choices, what matters is #1 their contributions to society and #2 how happy they and others around them can be. The fact that Ti users are even joking about this tells me they there is a legitimate internal opinion that somehow illogical people are inherently inferior, when you can clearly see billions of feelers being productive members of society around the world. It seems like you want them dead (or at least joke about it) because...you disagree with some of the things they say to you, or some of the decisions they make aren't like what you think is logical? Bullshit.   And without strong Fe users we wouldn't have caretakers who truly care about other people. Imagine if the world were filled only with INTPs and ENTJs...it would be chaos for the human race because no one would actually care about each other besides for using each other for certain goals. And they wouldn't be as willing to do hard labor either, all thinking themselves to be superior. I know your counter to that would be ""but logical people would figure out a way to create a society that blah blah."" No, they wouldn't (at least not in a short time period), because they would still be humans and have inherent human desires, motivations and needs (like food and sleep). They would have to wait for the technology to modify themselves to the point of being perfect robots that can somehow live perfectly in a perfect society."

mbti,3doi7r,intprecipitation,4,Sun Jul 19 08:25:44 2015 UTC,"The beauty of Ti, at least when operating without much Fe influence, is that it doesn't hurt.  I assume the mileage may very depending on where it is in one's stack, but for a Ti dom like myself, being able to use logic in a detached manner is Ti's greatest strength.  If I can't have a conversation that is detached, I'd rather not have it.  The last thing that I'd want to do is participate in an /r/politcs or /r/atheism or any religious or gender-based sub, as that is good place to find people that are gleefully ignorant. I'm fine with people being wrong.  Hell, I'm wrong all the time.  I assume that most people are wrong, and that is their problem, not mine. What I can't stand is a conviction of ignorance. I will actively avoid that argument, but if you insist and make the attack personal, I will respond with all I can muster.  The short of it is I love a reasonable, respectful discussion, but if you make me ""feel"" something, you'd better buckle up because that shit don't fly with me. I wouldn't call it pain, but maybe nerd rage.     I agree that the tendency to poke logical holes is basically a compulsion.  This is what Ti does.  I couldn't explain it any easier than trying to explain why Fi does what it does.  Introverted functions and subjectivity by definition are hard to explain objectively because they are not objective.    To your last point, I don't think that it is pain that is felt when something doesn't fit our logical system, but curiosity and some self doubt or fact checking. Then again, we love that.  It is just more logic, reason, and possibilities to explore.  It isn't about being right, so much as the process of figuring things out."
mbti,3doi7r,kalg,4,Sat Jul 18 02:15:33 2015 UTC,"Yes.  It grabs my attention when people just think it's OK and there's nothing wrong with spreading misinformation(like myths and strong value judgments). It causes more harm for everyone down the road... so when people think it isn't important to learn it makes me dislike the person and feel bad for humanity. One could argue that striving for the truth is just a value judgment for me too..  But that's why I don't really assert myself too much when faced with retardation.   Also, all types feel emotion, its how you choose to process your emotions that determine if you prefer F or T"
mbti,3doi7r,meowsock,3,Sat Jul 18 06:48:10 2015 UTC,"Goes like this:  Feeler person: ""Well this and this..""  Thinker: ""Well, could it be this and this?""  Feeler: ""Well this and this..!""  Thinker: ""No no, it is actually this and this.""  Feeler: ""Well this and this, though..?!""  Thinker: "" ... /walks away""  The only pain felt, if the thinking type is a nice one and has developed their feeling side, is sympathy for the other person, understanding they are on their own life path and are guided by mechanisms that work for them. But might not necessarily make sense to the thinking type which is ok. Everything on the spectrum has value. Although, the less developed Thinking types will definitely feel frustration and angst towards illogical people.  I guess to be frank, when people are irrational, we reason it away as a phenomena, rather than feel anything by it. It just is something that happens, there's no emotion attached to it. Kind of like when I drop a pencil, gravity pulls it to the ground, and that's it. I don't feel anything by it."
mbti,3doi7r,mirwin23,2,Sat Jul 18 04:09:40 2015 UTC,"Frustration, maybe, but not pain.  Logical inconsistencies for me are like laser pointers for a cat. They immediately grab my attention and I want to get them. It's fun and satisfying when I can set something right, but if I meet with illogical resistance then it's frustrating.  Or to put it another way, I can be oblivious to the emotional lives of others if I don't put in some effort, and a mess is just a gray background, but a logical inconsistency stands out like a strobe light in a hay field. Or like a hungry cat tapping me on the head as I'm trying to sleep. It's just so obvious and difficult to ignore."

mbti,3doi7r,snowflake030,2,Fri Jul 17 23:53:07 2015 UTC,"I think I know what you mean. The feeling of disappointment that you were unable to defend your point of view.   I think it's because Ti-users (especially ENTPs) get competitive about their ""grand ideas"" in debates, and would hate to see them undermined.   Similarly then, to how Fi-users get highly defensive of their personal values.    I guess it's because the introverted judging function is what drives these two types, and determines their goals. Remove the goal, and life just got a lot less meaningful for that person.   ENTP: I WILL find a way to divide by zero!  xxTx: Explains logically why that is impossible, and leads to error and paradox.  ENTP: ... Now what? There's nothing...

mbti,3dojkn,Gandesa,5,Fri Jul 17 23:28:57 2015 UTC,"Nope.  xNxPs have probably always contributed greatly to the general discourse.  Other types have as well, I'm sure.  The difference here is that this is the information age.  You can choose what discourse you choose to follow.  When I was your age (old man, speaking here) a mere 15 years ago, we basically had 3-4 networks and the state and local newspaper.  That was it.  The state newspaper would be somewhat partisan and opinionated, but not much.  The networks (in the US at least) were only about objective reporting for the most part.  It was only in the last ten years or so that the news needed to compete and therefore add subjectivity to win over audiences.  This gave rise to Fox News and MSNBC, Vice, Brietbart, etc.    I think that popular culture still favors other types, but is slowly warming up to IP's  For example, I'll just say the word Kardashion.  I think the fact that I don't need to elaborate on that is very telling.  If I say Vox, what the hell is that?  I think of amplifiers, not the voice that dominates Millennial discourse.  I still think that this is a very SJ world here, we just figured out that other IP's exist thanks to the internet."
mbti,3dojkn,jermofo,5,Sat Jul 18 02:45:44 2015 UTC,"Really, I think it makes most MBTI stereotypes come much more alive.  NTs especially run the systems as tech wizards. Technology is literally magic to the general public. Even old NTs vecome wizards (especially if they haven't had sex in 30 years).  NFPs run a lot of radical content. It's easy to find a soapbox to stand on online. Make a blog. Post things. Be unique. Point out hypocrisy. Even so, they are usually pretty good at explaining their choices. After all, it's all symbolic anyways.  NFJs keep a pretty low profile online.  SJs post a lot of content, but mostly boring stuff, like cars, flags, and cooking tips. The Fs are nonconfrontational on their own pages, unless you offend their community's bias. ESTJ tends to be more military.  SPs post content that's much more adventurous. Skydiving. Bungee jumping. But they do not like explaining their choices.  I'd say the stereotypes for the millennial generation are mostly due to NT-FP spillover."

So I will say what's on my mind, assume that people might not like it and put a tag with it that 'I don't care what anyone else thinks' to steel myself against criticisms that I might not normally be able to handle. It's not that I don't actually care what other people think, it's that I care too much and I don't want to drown out my subjective feeling without doubts.  Personally I might not actually say 'If you don't like it, tough luck' because that's not the message I want to send, but I will be thinking it so that I can deflect criticisms that I feel are irrational or mean-spirited.

But don't conflate selfish with bad in this situation - it's best to set boundaries because that's how you have healthy social interaction that's as comfortable for you as possible.   If there are irreconcilable differences in boundaries (for example, one person needs a large amount of alone time while the other needs to socialize all the time) then those two people should realize that they are incompatible and move on."
mbti,3dnm7r,Captain_Alphabet,9,Fri Jul 17 20:21:55 2015 UTC,"Needs are different than desires. One's needs can easily be met by any other person. The problem is that desire cannot due to its nature - desire simply wants to continue desiring.  Take hunger. You are hungry. What if you had a dream while hungry. What would you likely dream? Probably of all sorts of hedonistic delights. The crux is that this wouldn't satisfy your needs at all and is overboard (and exactly what people dream about). You don't dream about simple satiation of needs.  Your needs are simple but your desires are anything but b/c they are actually borne of unsatisfied needs while maturing. You are hungry, you cry for food, you don't get exactly what you ""ordered"", you desire the lack.  The trick, to me, is that you have to make your desires convert somehow back into drives/needs instead of being stretched out into desires that have no end.  This was spotlighted in a recent post in /r/relationships. A person was taking an rx drug that made them relatively horny. Their desires had gone crazy. I said ""what you crave is orgasm, you desire all the rest"". Every time she had those intrusive sexual thoughts she could've easily just masturbated and relieved herself of the need to pursue physical men. She was very disturbed and afraid that she would ruin her marriage through infidelity. There was nothing to be afraid of b/c the desire for those men, which was not physical, could be satiated temporarily by orgasm. She simply needed to see the desire for what it was, a fantasy and not based on physical reality.  This is the main problem with marriage. We expect people to fulfill our fantasies but these very fantasies are borne out of a lack. The very fantasies are created by a lack. People that are fulfilled don't fantasize and no one is fulfilled based on the lack I described above from childhood. A mother can fulfill a child's need for food but cannot fulfill a fantasy borne out of a temporary lack of food. It's never enough or too little. I think love can only occur when you are not trying to fill in your gap with another and instead see those gaps for what they are, endemic to yourself only and not fulfill-able, and you find yourself loving them for no particular reason or quality. Love can only exist when it is irrational but doesn't this make sense. If I say ""I love you b/c"" and give reasons doesn't that just mean that I conditionally love you? I can only really love someone if I don't know why and helpless ""fall"", out of control, irrational.  This has been pointed out in art (The Finest Worksong by REM, ""what we want and what we need has been confused"") over and over."

mbti,3dnm7r,Deanz_Bitch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:54:02 2015 UTC,"This really depends on how you define ""selfish."" Technically the ultimate form of selflessness is suicide (because fuck your selfish desire for life, right?), so the idea that selfishness is bad while selflessness is good probably has more roots in self loathing, envy, and depression than most people would like to admit. I don't think it's a coincidence that selflessness is encouraged by religion, and that religion has been a primary means of controlling large groups.  So yeah, it is ""selfish"" to have self respect, standards, and boundaries, but it's also a good thing. This doesn't mean that anyone should be a dick, it means that you should be the person you want to be based on your best knowledge. If you help others, or do ""good"" things, do them because you want to do them, don't be one of those fucking weaselly people that does things they hate doing for others, so they can guilt them into favors later, or to advertise one's ""moral superiority.""  If a mother buys her child baby formula instead of getting a new purse she hasn't made a sacrifice, or been selfless, she has simply chosen to be a good mother. She has chosen to pursue a higher value. If she later tells the child that she made all sorts of sacrifices for it, then she is trying to have her cake and eat it too. She is now suggesting that she didn't really want to be a good mother and only was one so that she could use the child later. She is literally admitting that she is a shitty and unhappy person who made choices she hated making, while suggesting that this makes her a saint."

Telling people what you want and need is the opposite of selfish. It's selfless and live-giving. You're communicating clearly how you like to be treated, so they can decide if they're willing to give that behaviour to you.    That said, I'm in a predicament with my brother. I love to sing. He hates my singing. He invited me to go to a new church where there is a fair bit of singing. The first time I went I didn't sing at all out of respect for him. I enjoyed the service lots, yet I wasn't able to be myself because if I sang then he would be upset. It's tricky. Maybe we just shouldn't go to the same church or maybe I can move away from him when I sing. Anyway, despite our differences, it was very healthy for him to communicate that he didn't like my singing, and it was healthy for me to communicate how that hurt, even though I'm glad he said it. Now I don't have to wonder or piss him off with my singing. Good boundaries are never selfish. They allow other people to love you well because you're telling them how you like to be treated."

Of course,now we might come to the question ""Well,who am I to decide who's needs are more important?""  You're not.

I'm not sure types would all form a group of their own type, but maybe people would seek out people based on their type instead of character. Interesting question."
mbti,3dmrt3,musical_pioneer,11,Fri Jul 17 16:16:54 2015 UTC,"I know it sounds shallow but once I was able to see how well the system describes people I became more interested in the people I usually wouldn't care about, and even more interested in the people I already did care a lot about. Now I see every interaction as an opportunity to add more info to my understanding of different types.   For some reason I also respect all people more now. It's almost like I used to think I was the only one with a real moral compass but now I see that everyone is actually wired to think and perceive differently and that everyone actually does have good intentions, it's just some people are not aware of certain systems. Like ESTPs aren't as aware of how Fi users feel when they feel attacked, and so they're less able to gauge what things will offend certain people. They also naturally like getting reactions from people and they believe others like it when they do this and don't feel the pain others feel when they accidentally offend someone during these games.   So maybe it could end up like that. Once everyone knows each others types they will care more about each other for that strange reason."

mbti,3dmrt3,Orikon32,6,Fri Jul 17 16:53:51 2015 UTC,"Ooohhhh it would be interesting;I'd love to see that. A world in which everyone has a type,and everybody's type is publicly visible.  Discriminations based on type and functions would be inevitable,but I can imagine it would also help organize and divide our society more efficiently. People would no longer take jobs that they aren't suited for,more people would be satisfied with their overall careers,relationships and the general understanding between people would improve a lot,etc.  People would know and understand themselves better; their strengths,weaknesses,what they're good at,why are they like X or X and not like Y,how their preferences and personalities fit into their own type,why is X happening to them,etc.  And it would help people a great deal to also understand other people and the world around them.  Overall,if we could overcome the discrimination and abuse of the MBTI/Jung system (I can imagine this would be the hardest thing to do),I believe its integration in our society would ultimately result in our society becoming more harmonious,and maybe even peaceful. If anything,people would be simply happier with their lives,and the understanding and communication between different people,communities,and maybe even countries would definitely improve."

Two scenarios occur: either people are low on some kind of resource and people will split up and fight between groups. Or, you force people to cooperate for some mutual gain and everyone becomes friends.   The same thing happens without people knowing everyone else's type, but it would probably be more rigid and obvious."

When I type like this, it's always a direct stream of my conscious though, it feels much like talking. My inner voice is probably more expressive and dramatic than my real voice.   With friends, I either say exactly what's on my mind, or end up fixated on a train of thought I feel that I shouldn't say out loud, I also filter out thoughts that I don't think other people will find interesting or thoughts I feel expose myself too much.

Internal monologue consists of intertwined imagery, language tends comes into play when I am working something out.  Driving monopolizes a good portion of my visual processing so I sort of switch into autopilot. Now that I think about it I'm not really sure what's going on up there when I am driving. I listen to music while driving as well, except during my morning commute.  Really when it comes to it, my thought processes center around imagery and interconnectivity. I'm essentially geared toward organizing information and planning/dreaming.  In social situations I've been described as a good listener.  This has always been somewhat baffling to me but I assume it's because I am a good person to bounce stuff off of.    In personal relationships, particularly when it comes to how someone feels about something, I had to actually learn that context is important, and instead of trying to rationalize feelings to simply support them.  That is still a fairly alien to do for me but got a great deal of practice with a very tolerant and patient woman.  Wound a bit off topic there, woops."

When I was younger, I always thought everyone's mind worked like mine does, but I never hear or see other people describe their experience in a way that is similar to my own.  I think of it is as having multiple tracks running at the same time. My thought process typically consists of both me actively thinking about everything going on around me and a conversation that I have partially tuned out of. It is like driving a car and having a passenger that has access to your senses and your library of past thoughts and experiences and wants to discuss these with you and make plans based off of the information. It is almost like daydreaming, which I also do, but I am still aware of everything going on around me and do not need something to snap me out of it.  That said, sudden things do stop the conversational track abruptly, but that is just a matter of a shift of focus on both tracks to dealing with and moving on from whatever that situation is.  I hear people describe their inner thought process as just pictures or video, or even just words, but for me it is both. It is remembering information that has been seen, attempting to visualize information that has not been seen, and verbal thoughts/the inner conversation about that and everything going on around me.  I might be able to provide more information later as well as and type something up regarding the thought process during daily activities."

It is constantly running around all over the place, unless I'm engulfed in something that requires more focused thinking, like video games, listening to music, or watching something captivating.

I personally think it's pretty clear from his vibe that he's an Se-dom, and the hard intensity of his voice/body language in all his videos points to Ti-aux rather than Fi. I have seen people attempt to argue he's actually INFJ, which is insane and I would never believe in a million years.  In fact, I believe the way he reacted to his psychological break is even further proof of inferior Ni. I think rather than being stuck in a loop of some kind, extreme stress plummeted him straight into his weakest function, which he clearly cannot use eloquently. Even in his right mind, he still apparently believes the voices in his head are demons, and thinks he not only needs to see a psychologist, but an exorcist as well.  I mean, you could argue that it's just a personal belief, but believing the voices in your head are a clear sign of the existence of god/demons rather than a result of psychosis, or psychological disorder like schizophrenia, is just not something I can picture any high Ni user doing at his age.  Edit: I'm just now realizing I misread the last sentence of your post. He definitely needs to see a psychologist, rather than ""just lay off the whole religious stuff."" Are you kidding me?  Edit 2.0: ...not that I have any proof this is actually happening, but I keep getting downvoted for some reason, and I'm having a fun time imagining hoards of butthurt EXTJs trying desperately to defend their fallen comrade. ""I mean, he made us look like insensitive assholes, but he's totally right! Somehow! In some way! Because I would say the same thing and my inferior Fi is never wrong, damn it!"""
mbti,3dj6lp,blueligerorion,3,Thu Jul 16 20:39:36 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right. Im just as bad as he is, we're slowly getting better."
mbti,3dj6lp,Orikon32,3,Fri Jul 17 08:50:35 2015 UTC,"To be honest I wouldn't say he's an ESTP. He's in no way an INFJ,but an ESTP? I doubt it.  Obviously I don't know him in real life,but looking at his videos I would say he's an ISTP.  (This is just my theory)  He got stuck in his head.  Introverts can get lost in their heads. Once that happens, the external functions shut off because you aren’t using them, due to a kind of mental isolation from reality. And then the loop happens,in his case,that would be the Ti-Ni loop. He retreated into his own world,and due to a lack of Se,his lets call it ""craziness"" happened.  Plus,being an ESTP would also have to mean that Fe is his tert. functions,which I doubt. In an Se/Fe loop,an ESTP's can often develop visible emotions and insecurities about how others feel about them and the impersonal impacts of their actions and decisions.  In his case however,he fully backed into his own mind and started making projections about the world and that he's something he's not,all backed by his religious beliefs and thoughts on how the world and people work (look at some of his videos where he complains about the people around him,how he's just a mindless zombie,how he's surrounded by idiots,etc. -- inferior Fe)."
mbti,3dj6lp,SquirmGirl,2,Thu Jul 16 23:05:28 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, you've presented a decent argument here.   Plus,being an ESTP would also have to mean that Fe is his tert. functions,which I doubt. In an Se/Fe loop,an ESTP's can often develop visible emotions and insecurities about how others feel about them and the impersonal impacts of their actions and decisions.   Well, I never personally viewed him as being in a Se-Fe loop. I found Fe to be prominent in much of his facial expressions and body language. Not obvious enough to be in the dominant or auxiliary position, for sure, but much more so than I would imagine possible for an ISTP of the same age and maturity. From what I could gather, Fe was most likely his tertiary.   I still believe he's ESTP. Aside from a few obvious fuck-ups (typing Justin Bieber as ENFJ, for instance) the guy clearly understands the cognitive functions well enough that I trust him to have self-typed accurately. However, ISTP is certainly possible, and you've made a good case for it. Not like it's all that far off from ESTP, either :)"

mbti,3dkoc3,corsetxcandy,3,Fri Jul 17 02:04:11 2015 UTC,"I thought I was INFJ for a long time, then INFP. I can also look like an INTJ to some people. Basically I'm the quietest ENFJ ever."
mbti,3dkoc3,Valkyrian,3,Fri Jul 17 05:11:05 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Why do you reject the INFP label?   I looked through your posts and for the 4w5 AMA you said your worst flaw was your selfishness. ENFJs tend to be quite selfless - we are constantly focused on others, practically people-obsessed. The reason for this is because our identity needs other people. Being reserved is more your 5 wing than being type 4 since 4w3 tends to be extroverted (like ENFPs).   For myself I fit the ENFJ stereotype pretty well except for being religious/excessively proper. There is a self-typed ENFJ 4w5 I found on Youtube.. I'll put up a video for you to compare tomorrow. I don't mean to ask as an attack but.. an ENFJ that appears INTJ is a huge difference.  Edit: I finally accept that I'm actually 3w4, not 4w3 lol ><"
mbti,3dkoc3,corsetxcandy,2,Fri Jul 17 07:39:54 2015 UTC,"If he/she thinks he/she is selfish then that will be his/her worst flaw in his/her eyes, but to others he/she may be the most saintly, selfless person they know. The important takeaway from that statement would be that he/she will always want to be more selfless than he/she is."
mbti,3dkoc3,_mildude,3,Fri Jul 17 12:51:41 2015 UTC,"That's a good explanation but she has way more things that I question. I don't like stereotypes either but when a person pretty much matches nothing in a type description it just doesn't make sense to be that type. She mentions that she has a chronic bitchface, goes on about how cold, aloof, reserved, quiet, etc. she is. Fe-doms try to make other people feel comfortable and they tend to have animated facial expressions - smiles, probably way too much smiling :p  And an ENFJ with huge amounts of Fi? In Enneagram type 4 is very Fi-dom. That's why I kept wondering if I'm really ENFJ or actually type 3. Everyone had been telling me I was type 3 and it took me a while to finally believe it. Can ENFJ 4w5 exist? Maybe... but it is pretty weird. Mistypings are all over the place, too."
mbti,3dkoc3,corsetxcandy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"I haven't looked at anyt other context surrounding the person, so I'll take your word for it. If all that is true, then yes, being an ENFJ is unlikely."
mbti,3dkoc3,_mildude,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:59:39 2015 UTC,"I can see why you'd be skeptical. Honestly, the main reason for not being INFP is my major lack of Ne. After much research and introspection, I've come to the conclusion that what I have is definitely Ni. It's why I thought I was an INFJ for so long. I am still open to the possibility that I was initially correct and INFJ after all, but I think my Se is slightly stronger than Ti (both are quite weak though).   I am both selfish and obsessed with people even though I don't fit the ""celebrity"" stereotype. I do this thing where I'll subconsciously ""chameleon"" with  people; if the other person is quiet, I'll be more chatty/lively and try to get them to open up. If they're talkative, I'll be the listener. Keep in mind that Fe is not simply social norms (which I very much adhere to, btw) either. It is objective ethics, which means I draw emotion and a sense of right/wrong from what is outside me, not necessarily from within like Fi doms do. When it comes to resting bitchface, it's just something that happens when I'm, well...resting. When I'm engaging with others and feel emotion, I cannot hide it at all. It seems like Fi users have a much more prominent pokerface. I am incapable of that. I am also selective about who I am cold and aloof towards. It's not something I just do to everyone, though I'm more likely to appear that way if I'm tired.  To explain the type 4? Well, a 4's biggest fear is being insignificant, and I can say with honesty that this is how I feel. However, I will admit that I've been questioning my wing lately. I could possibly be 4w3.  Anyway, feel free to pm me if you have more questions."
mbti,3dkoc3,Valkyrian,3,Fri Jul 17 16:36:43 2015 UTC,"Everything you've described would fit INFJ. Any type can ""chameleon"" - it's just that ENFJs are supposedly the best at it. If you're Fe-dom your emotions are going to be pretty dramatic and especially expressive. The whole ethics thing just sounds enneagram 1, which type 4 moves toward though it could also be in your tritype.  I understand type 4s pretty well since I thought I was 4w3 before. If you're type 4, then I would look into xNFP and INFJ further. Also INFJs definitely can look like INTJs."
mbti,3dkoc3,corsetxcandy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:49:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply.  My emotions are quite expressive, that's for certain. I try to control them depending who I'm around though. I know some people don't react well to extreme emotional display, so I'll tone it down for their sake. I'll often be whatever I sense the other person wants me to be.  xNFP is not the case, that much I know; as I said, I'm not a Ne user. If I'm anything other than ENFJ, it would be INFJ. When I mentioned ethics, it isn't the same as the enneagram 1 sense of the term. Socionics (not sure if you've looked into it) uses the word ""ethics"" to describe feeling. Also, another way to look at it: Fi = values or subjective ethics, while Fe = morals or objective ethics. I fit more with the latter; even though I'm not the greatest ""people person"", I draw feeling/motivation from the outside, in other words, objectively. That's what being an extravert means. It's not about being more talkative or social. It's whether your focus projects outside or inside of you.  But, MBTI is my main forte. I'm not as well-versed in enneagram, so I'm open to the idea that I'm a 4w3 or even a 3w4."

INTJs have a higher value for authenticity than you might expect with Fi not being repressed, so I find i unlikely an INTJ would spend their time pretending to be someone else just for the purpose of stirring up trouble unless they're unhealthy, but obviously anything can happen. I associate playing a part to make people mad with NTPs because of Ti/Fe in their stack, which creates a social persona out from a cold, logical inner person.

Understanding of mechanisms is a tool for arriving at a picture of the probable end situation or understanding what actions we want to take to get where we want or to optimize our position at the probable end situation that's out of our hands. Those kinds of things. What can be accomplished is key, how the cogs turn a tool to accomplish things.  Ti is model-oriented thinking - the focus is on modeling things, figuring out how they work, root causes for why things are the way they are and making a mental representation of all that. Having a good understanding of the mechanisms of things is the prime consideration.  The state of things, or desired end point are incidental curiosities, useful data points to hone the model to be better. Having the model accurately predict what will happen or model what has happened from an input state is of interest. How the cogs turn is more important than what the turning accomplishes.  Fe explores, manipulates and reacts to sentiment and expression of it based on a common standard, ideally in an attempt to keep everyone happy and ensure their needs are met, or to convince others of something the Fe type believes is important.  Fi is concerned with defining people, what they are about, being authentic to that same definition, and pays attention to the motive behind the expression - intent and integrity before action, in a sense.

Depends on what you mean.  It views data, sees patterns and trends, asks questions and brings up past events and circumstances that are relevant to the now.  It may not present you with every idea ever, so if that's what you mean by filtering, sure, it does that.  But what I was referring to is the data generated by your perceiving function gets passed to your judging function for decision making and active filtering (another word for this process is...  judging...)   It sounds like you don't believe in perceiving functions.   It sounds to me like you're passing off the judging aspect of the judging functions and trying to shoehorn it in to the perceiving functions...   There is inherent bias, yes, which I try to rule out by comparing against ESTJ and ENFJ friends   All of which are extroverted judging dominant, and none of which use Ti as a dominant or auxiliary function, making them pretty poor comparisons for evaluating a Te/Ti bias...

If there is a significant penalty, then the Te user will act on the information they know.

Meh I dunno how else to express it, he just finds the obvious flaws and just point at it that's just Fi/Te.

mbti,3dgob8,rattlesnake30,2,Thu Jul 16 03:11:09 2015 UTC,"It's what you're anxious about that factors into your type, I would say. I think even if someone has a true anxiety disorder, the things they obsess about are going to differ than someone else with an anxiety disorder of similar severity.  Obsessing over deadlines is typically J thing, in my experience. In particular, I would say high-ranking Te users are more prone to doing this (EXTJ and IXTJ), seeing as Te most highly values personal success and efficiency. But, depending on age or the amount of stress the person is under, tertiary and inferior Te users (IXFP and EXFP) can be prone to this as well.   I find this dichotomy very difficult to deal with when trying to determine my type.   Yes, unfortunately, testing by letter preference is generally a bad way to figure out one's true type, and I can certainly imagine this is not how Jung envisioned his cognitive function theories being put to use. Everyone is prone to cognitive bias (answering in terms of how they wish they were, rather than how they actually are). These sites also rarely mention anything about cognitive functions, and how they're stacked per type.  It might help you to learn about cognitive functions if you're dissatisfied with your test results. There are tests to narrow down which functions you use, as well. Each type uses four of them, and once you narrow down your top two, it becomes clear what your type is :)  If you don't mind my asking, which type have you tested as?"

mbti,3dgob8,SquirmGirl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:31:12 2015 UTC,"In my experience, the one letter that makes the most difference between types is S and N. That being said, most people know themselves well enough to identify whether they are intuitive or sensing the first time around. Judging from your results, you can probably safely assume you are the former.  Logically, I would think that typing as an NF type more than once would indicate you're probably an intuitive feeler. I would recommend doing two things. 1.) Read the descriptions of all the idealist types (INFP, INFJ, ENFP and ENFJ), and see if there's one in particular you relate to more. 2.) Read up on the cognitive functions I linked earlier of each type, and figure out which ones you're using primarily. You will know your type for sure once you nail down your dominant and auxiliary functions.  I would also like to point out that don't think typing as a perceiver twice is indication that you necessarily are one. Functions like Si and Ni are actually perceiving functions. Because of this, Si and Ni-doms (IXFJ and IXTJ) often mistype as perceivers. Despite this, they prefer planning and structured environments, making them J-types.  Functions like Ti and Fi, on the other hand, are actually judging functions. So, Ti and Fi-doms (IXFP and IXTP) often mistype as judgers. Despite this, they are more spontaneous and go-with-the-flow people by nature, technically making them P-types.  So, as you can see, this a big flaw with MBTI theory, and one of the primary reason that people mistype so often. It's all kind of confusing at first, but I promise if you study the cognitive functions, it will make things easier. Typology is a lot of fun! :)"
mbti,3dgob8,aNinjaWithAIDS,2,Thu Jul 16 21:49:35 2015 UTC,"Now, ideally, I feel like deadlines should be flexible and not a big deal. However, my anxiety makes it so that I find them very important and I obsess over them.   It seems like you're more worried about the future consequences of deadlines (Ni-Se) rather than the deadline itself (Ne-Si).    I find this dichotomy very difficult to deal with when trying to determine my type.   It actually isn't that difficult once you study, understand, and recognize the cognitive functions and how they work together within each type. DaveSuperPowers on youtube has many informative videos that compare and contrast the types through said functions. Start with his INFJ vs INFP commentary which goes into detail on said functions.  What triggers stress in one personality type may trigger interest in another. For example, anybody with a well-developed Ti (thats anbody with TP, and sometimes older IxFJ's) would enjoy simple debates for understanding while such a situation would make the higher Fi users (that's anybody with FP) uncomfortable and constantly question him/her self.  It all boils down to the cognitive functions and how your personality type stacks/prioritizes them. I have Fe last which allows me to recognize ""proper"" social behavior, but I can easily show ineptitude whenever engaging myself in that matter."
mbti,3dgob8,Komatik,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:06:26 2015 UTC,"You're looking at how your anxiety affects your test answers rather than what the processes you use to take in, evaluate and organize information are. The test questions are pretty much meaningless, besides which as others already noted it's what you are anxious about that tends to matter more.  To clarify the long way, there's two main ways to assign yourself a type / get yourself a type code.  The first is assigning yourself four letters by taking a test (or doing it yourself), the second figuring out what cognitive functions (~=go-to habits for taking in, evaluating and organizing information) you use. Both give you the same kind of code because the approaches have a lot of shared history, but the meaning behind the code is different because of how it's arrived at.   Using a test or otherwise looking into the four dichotomies to get a code and then look what kind of functions you're supposed to use from that is usually a bad idea (for example, I often get IxTP results from tests - this would mean I use Ti, which I don't - I'm a very clear Te type). Despite being different, both of these approaches give you valuable information but should be kept separate because they mean very, very different things.  The tests / dichotomatic approach ranks you on four different scales that are more or less separate from each other - ie. your score on one shouldn't influence your score on the others much at all. Having only a slight preference one way or another here is normal, and actually pretty much expected. The test results tend to fluctuate a good bit as well, especially so if you have only mild preferences one way or another - mood, the day, the alignment of the stars and whether your cat clawed your eyes out in the morning all become a large influence in your responses.  What the test letters mean, roughly: I/E = introverted/extroverted. Do you like being out and about, esp. around people. N/S = Abstract-minded or concrete person. F/T = Do you go more on sentiment and accomodate others or reason in a cold, detached way. P/J = How organized, scheduled, conscientious you are. The more P, the more disorganized and spontaneous, the more J, the more organized and planned.      Each of these scales has a bunch of subgroups, or facets that measure some different traits that get put under whatever letter heading, so you don't need to embody any one dimension fully to get a score on it.  If looking at this, it makes sense how eg. getting a job would make you seem more J - and by the test's measure, you are - and the results of the dichotomatic test actually told you something useful about yourself. But I wouldn't use them to assign yourself a functional type. The test results fluctuating also makes it kind of odd to try to assign a type code based on a 50% split on the scale, so I'd probably just take a Big 5 test - it tells you how high you score on some things but presents the results in a way that gives away that they're meant to be fluid, measures more or less the same four things as the MBTI test does, and includes a fifth scale that measures how swingy or stable your emotional state is, which is obviously useful information.  To explain that better, let's look at the other way to get a type code: figuring out what functions you use.  The functional approach is a rough model that tries to explain how you take in, evaluate and organize information by dividing the information processing into four core processes (Thinking, Feeling, Sensing and iNtuition) each of which has two attitudes (ie. extraversion, or interest in the external world, and introversion, ie. interest in what is going on inside your head) and then figuring out which processes you use in what attitudes. They're often shortened to a function code of Core process and Attitude, ie. Sensing in the extroverted attitude = Se.  Two examples would be an inclination to use the Thinking function focusing more on personal models, their accuracy and looking for root causes (introverted Thinking, Ti) or the state of the outside world or analyzed system, exerting control over it and making the most of what you have (extroverted Thinking, Te), or using Feeling to focus more on the harmony of the group and people's expressions of sentiment (extroverted Feeling, Fe) or on being true to yourself and looking at the motivations behind expressions of sentiment (introverted Feeling, Fi).  To contrast why it's important to focus on the meaning behind the code rather than the code itself, Test/Dichotomatic ENTP v. ENTJ, for example, is basically asking whether the person is more haphazard and spontaneous or more planned, conscientious and orderly - it's directly what the tests measure and the types differ only on one scale. They're both extroverts and iNtuitive Thinkers.  In Function-land, where we look at how the person takes in, evaluates and organizes information, the meaning is different. Here we find that ENTPs and ENTJs use an entirely different set of processes:  ENTPs are primarily watchers who lead with extroverted Intuition (Ne) - it's an exploring, brainstorming kind of process that draws its inspiration from the outside world and is very interested in it, and complement that with Ti - an evaluating process that focuses on building accurate mental models of things. How the cogs turn is more important than what that turning accomplishes.  ENTJs lead with extroverted Thinking or Te - cold, detached reasoning like Ti, but focused on evaluating the properties of the outside world and exerting control over it, usually with the aim of ordering it to be more efficient. They complement this with introverted Intuition, which in contrast to Ne's curious exploration just drinks in tons of information and subconsciously finds patterns in there that it then condenses it into a holistic understanding of how something ticks that the Ni type himself often needs to work to ""map out"".  In short, they're totally different :D  Same applies to INTP vs. INFP - in test-land the difference is a slight preference to Thinking or Feeling type items in the questionnaire, but in Function-land an INTPs primary processes are Ti (dominant/compulsive) and Ne (auxiliary/habitual), while INFPs lead with Fi and use Ne as auxiliary - they share the habitual process and their dominant function is introspective, evaluative in nature so their minds are kind of similar in construction, but the compulsive, dominant process is different which is a very large change.  tl;dr: Same code, different meaning. Keep them separate, and they will be useful to you. Try to force them to align, and you'll only confuse yourself or end up acting in a non-genuine way.  If you're interested in learning functional typology after that explanation:  Lessons on functions-based typology by Michael Pierce is easily one of the best introductions to functional typology I have ever seen, and certainly made the mess of jargon click for me when I started.  Celebritytypes has good comparison tables for the different functions - this is probably good to look at side by side with Pierce's introductory videos.

The physical gestures and facial expressions allow you to physically be apart of your daydream.   Neglect basic functions   I thought that I was just inferior Se.   This doesn't seem like a problem to me. No person can ever be 100% productive with their time or 100% focused on their tasks all the time. You learn to balance daydream and reality with things called discipline and mindfulness."
mbti,3depiy,SquirmGirl,2,Wed Jul 15 21:37:54 2015 UTC,"This doesn't seem like a problem to me.    I believe the disorder (not sure if you can really call it a disorder?) only becomes a problem when the daydreaming interferes with real life. Essentially, when you're using the daydreaming as a crutch because you can't deal with reality. Or, when you literally prefer your daydream life to real life.  If you don't consider it a problem and live a productive life, despite having a tendency toward daydreaming, it probably isn't."

Just not a fan of diagnosing ""disorders"" that are results of another reason. You may daydream maladaptively, but that isn't the real problem. The real problem is dealing with what is causing it."
mbti,3depiy,SquirmGirl,2,Thu Jul 16 03:27:51 2015 UTC,"The real problem is dealing with what is causing it   I completely agree. For the record, I don't really view it as a ""disorder"" either. I just called it that for the sake of convenience. It's usually the result of a deeper issue, even if I also believe that certain people tend more towards maladaptive daydreaming than others as a coping mechanism."

My saving grace is that I don't do it when I'm interacting with other people. If I'm interacting with others, the daydreaming shuts off. When I'm not, though, it often interferes with using my brain for what I'm supposed to be doing. It feels like addictive behavior."

My daydreams (and fantasies) usually don't have much of a story line, and all of the information in the daydream content come from my senses. I might get caught up in wanting to go out into nature so I'll get caught up in how it feels (maybe it's windy but there's sun on my skin, how the rocks feel as I climb over things), how it seems (the fresh air flowing through my lungs with the smell of trees and earth), sounds, textures, tastes, colours, feelings, the people that will be there, the conversations we will branch into, sense of contentment etc etc. It's definitely not like watching a movie, like some people describe it.

That's a rather silly comment to make when philosophers such as Nietzsche and Marx are among the most quoted modern philosophers. They also tend to be unanimously rated as INTJs.

mbti,3ddkaq,Xzcouter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:39:44 2015 UTC,I disagree on how you said it's intuitive more than thinking and feeling. Its both!  We perceive the information using our perception functions which acts as a filter too then process using our judging functions.  EDIT: any perception function can also go for philosophy if you think about it. Ne like Albert Camus. Si to think about past events. Se for the now. Any function at all!
mbti,3ddkaq,virginiagunther,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:03:54 2015 UTC,"Its not ONLY Ni though. The whole premise of philosophy is logic, morality, questioning and answering. You could literally have a philosophy of the chair you are sitting on. I agree its more towards Ni but I would add Ti to it too. Ni-Ti would be the epitome of philosophy. Getting to the core of things and understanding the system and forming the system. Its also a falacy of just naming some people and saying that because they are INTJ that its Ni. I mean look at Socrates who is an ENTP, Albert Camus INFP and Descartes INTP. Te is about objectivity and data. They need the data to back up things. Using subjective knowledge is not their forte. This doesn't mean they cannot do philosophy plain out its just that their approach would be a much more objective view of things. In Philosophy there is the major question of: ""Does objectivity exist?/ What is objectivity?""  Two answers which the community is split upon:   If every experience is just a subjective experience then a collective subjective experience makes something objective. Hence nothing can be truly objective Yes things can be objective on its own. (Sorry I can't explain this one in detail)   Both are right. I think Te users would fall into that objectivity does exist cause thats how they think (I am not saying that any other can't also believe objectivity exists on its own though)  Philosophy is the study of everything so any function could be used but it favors some more than others. Ni , Ti for logic and system building. Fi and Fe (with any perceiving function) can be for morality. Te for objectivity. Etc.  Typical Philosophy favors introverted functions more than extraverted due to how we need to go indepth rather than broad.  EDIT: You haven't given a single argument mentioning why Te favors Philosophy more than Ti, Fi and Fe. I never said that these functions were the ONLY ones for philosophy. I just mentioned that these functions is much more favorable for Philosophy than Te."
mbti,3ddkaq,virginiagunther,2,Thu Jul 16 00:08:28 2015 UTC,"Its not ONLY Ni though.   To start, he clearly said ""it isn't necessarily limited to that function."" Glad you're both in agreement.   Getting to the core of things and understanding the system and forming the system.   Introverted thinking (Ti) tends to have more difficulty than extroverted thinking (Te) when it comes to expressing these ideas, hence why one is extroverted and one is introverted. Just like I, as an introverted feeler, will have more difficulty expressing my emotions than an extroverted feeler. This isn't a difficult concept.   You could literally have a philosophy of the chair you are sitting on.   Maybe this is why many people tend to enjoy philosophers that have introverted intuition instead? Just kidding, but this really doesn't help your point."
mbti,3ddkaq,virginiagunther,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:38:15 2015 UTC,Ti vs Te has nothing to do with how well you express your ideas. It's completely different from that.  Ti can be better in a way. It really depends.  Haha yes it does not help but I was just trying to say that because you could have. Philosophy about anything that any function can come into play.
mbti,3ddkaq,AttonRandd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:49:07 2015 UTC,"Ti vs. Te has nothing to do with how well you express your ideas.   I would like to see you expand on this. You couldn't apply this logic to the other functions; as I said before, Fi vs. Fe would unarguably effect how well you express your emotions to other people. Why would Te vs. Ti not effect how you express your thoughts to others?   To be blunt, introverted thinking relies on using your thoughts from within, while extroverted thinking excels at communicating thoughts to outsiders. I find it difficult to argue that the latter wouldn't be more useful for a person who wants to express and spread their ideas."
mbti,3ddkaq,AttonRandd,2,Thu Jul 16 01:13:34 2015 UTC,"Fi vs Fe in a way yes but the main idea is about judgement here right?  The core basic is Fi is about personal morality and feelings while Fe is about external feelings and morality. We presume Fe is better due to it being extraverted and handling with people more than a person with Fi.  The core of Te vs Ti is logic. Te handles with data like you said Spreadsheet and Ti is the Thinker who uses subjective logic and forms his own system. Te is presumed to be better cause he is like the CEO in a meeting. BUT a person who uses Ti with good Fe can easily do better too! It all depends.  I teach alot and I can easily say what I want to say using analogies and relating to wjat the person knows. I have a friend who is really practical, knowing how she was I taught her using practical examples alone and showed her the core base of how something works. I use this method often and I am a well known tutor in my school"
mbti,3ddkaq,jermofo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:29:19 2015 UTC,"The core basic is Fi is about personal morality and feelings while Fe is about external feelings and morality.   Yes, and personal feelings/morality greatly effect the way people express themselves. I can listen to an INFJ/INFP talk and tell the difference in how well they express their emotions to me, just as I can between an INTJ/INTP and how well they express their thoughts.  When it comes to judgement, both introverted thinking and extroverted thinking probably have equal ability to come to insightful conclusions (especially when paired with intuition). However, those conclusions won't make you a philosopher if you can't communicate them to a broad audience; that's why I'm saying extroverted thinking has an advantage in this case.   Te handles with data like you said Spreadsheet and Ti is the Thinker who uses subjective logic and forms his own system. Te is presumed to be better cause he is like the CEO in a meeting.    Using your own terms, it's easier for an audience to understand a spreadsheet than it is for a group of people to understand subjective logic that isn't their own. That might be why a CEO would prefer that method during a meeting, as they don't have the luxury of using logic or terms that only they can understand, just as philosophers don't.  I won't deny that you're probably great at presenting your ideas to individuals as you stated, mostly because subjectivity is easier to use one-on-one or in small groups and some individuals can benefit from that. However, those situations aren't applicable to the way that reknown philosophers need to express themselves.  If you want to have some fun, compare some quotes by Friedrich Nietzsche or Karl Marx (XNTJs) to that of Immanuel Kant or John Stuart Mill (XNTPs). Despite that both pairs make interesting judgements, one of them have made a broader impact because of their direct application and presentation."
mbti,3ddkaq,KCSunshine111,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:48:09 2015 UTC,"Its not ONLY Ni though.   Which is why I said:   it would probably be Ni, but it isn't necessarily limited to that function   You claimed that Te isn't proficient with philosophy. I listed some very well known INTJ philosophers. Nietzsche and Marx are among the most quoted philosophers in recent times. That alone is proof against your claim. How can Te not work well with philosophy when some of the best in the field often utilize it?       Socrates is pointless to type - how much of an individual's personality can be gathered from a man who existed over 2000 years ago? Keep in mind, most of what we know about him came from what others wrote.         My point wasn't that philosophy favors Te. I never said that. Philosophy is more in relation to one's intuition than to thinking or feeling. Maybe the type of philosophy can differ depending on thinking or feeling, but the act itself relies mostly on intuition. Ni paired with Te will foster capable philosophers who will have a better ability to express their ideas."
mbti,3ddkaq,CritSrc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:28:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry I may have came out aggressive >.<  Anyways that still is not proof. Just because some philosophers that we think are INTJ (I mean we are basing their mbti off their works and how they are said to be. We really aren't 100% sure for their motives and how they think) does not make it any more logical.   I apologize again if I came out aggressive. You used a fallacy which is the authority fallacy. Just because the philosophers are INTJ does not mean Te is major in use. This maybe proof, but if we don't have a reason as to why this works rather than ending it there right?  If Te is the function that helps than we should start asking as to 'why' rather than just end it at that 'x,y,z are INTJ' hence Te, as they could've used mostly Ni with Fi backed up with little Te. We are talking about people who we never knew in person here. Its a fallacy. So I think its better to think of a reason as to why Te is good for philosophy.  I apologize for saying that Philosophy is anything but Te. What I meant to say was the typical philosophy we think of such as the question of 'What is moral' or maybe 'What is the meaning of meaning?'"
mbti,3ddkaq,demesure,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:01:08 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, sorry for being confrontational myself. I don't even use Te as one of my functions, but I do think it is very important for philosophy.       My argument isn't exactly a fallacy though. Arguing that trained professionals commonly cite these very important philosophers as INTJs is important and relevant in this conversation.       If you want to go into the details as to why Te is good for philosophy, well, it's pretty simple. Ideas developed from introverted thinking are useless if those introverted thoughts cannot be expressed well. Have you noticed how Ti users tend to stumble around in conversation a lot compared to Te users? We also are bad as structuring our arguments on the spot."
mbti,3ddkaq,carolinecarrgould,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:18:00 2015 UTC,I agree that Ti stumbles alot but thats just because of poor social skills in some cases. I am an ENTP and I tutor alot. The one thing I found as the best teaching method is to use Ti as it is. Because of this I am known to be a well known tutor in my school. I speak in analogies and show them the way I processed things.  Te is better at handling data and all of those stuff. Ti is better at theoretical work.
mbti,3ddkaq,carolinecarrgould,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:22:54 2015 UTC,I disagree that we are bad at constructing agreements on the spot. Why else would ENTP be called devils advocate? Have you seen Richard Dawkins whos a supposed INTP?  Again it depends
mbti,3ddkaq,CritSrc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:24:10 2015 UTC,"I would disagree that Ti cannot express itself well.  The way that Ti expresses itself in a conversation is totally irrelevant in terms of philosophy, which is primarily a very careful, deliberate, written form.  This a form of expression that Ti excels at.  Besides, the functions don't exist in a vacuum.  In philosophy, I think we are usually talking about Ti-Ne and Ni-Te.  Ni isn't going to be able to express itself without Te, just as Ti isn't going to be able to express itself without Ne.  If a Ti user is competent in what they are discussing, they wont stumble much, especially is they lead with Ne.     I think that is relevant to note that Nietzsche had disdain for both Te and Ti value judgments, as well as Fi and Fe."
mbti,3ddkaq,BadgerKid96,2,Thu Jul 16 02:07:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe philosophy wouldn't fit under Te, you're right. But, honestly, I absolutely love discussing philosophy, morality, how differences of environment shift the way people think. And a billion other things too...I don't know, even if I categorized that one wrong, she can still definitely fit the ISTJ type. Or I'm not an ISTJ...but I am."
mbti,3ddkaq,CritSrc,4,Wed Jul 15 16:05:35 2015 UTC,"Te practices its philosophies, it's pretty inspiring to me when I see that."
mbti,3ddkaq,carolinecarrgould,3,Wed Jul 15 17:27:07 2015 UTC,"INFx... a lot is debatable.   She once said that if she can withdraw herself from the entire world she would   That seems very Fi-Ne way of looking at things while Ni-Fe would be more interested in understanding why the world works the way it does. Though Ni-Fe can feel that way if they're overwhelmed with their Fe.  The way you explain how she views others (people she knows, people who care for her) is also seems Fi. Her approach on talking about abstracts seems very passionate especially her value in not being into ""guys who put a show, lies and cheats. She wants a person who shows they care."" She has a lot of emphasis on people caring about her (dominant feeler trait). Fe would be more concerned with understanding why each person does those things and wouldn't make general moral statements without an explanation.  You say she appears to be extroverted, also something that Fe can do because Fe can easily get along with all types of people because Fe can gauge people very well and speak in the way that makes them feel good. Ni-Fe can also be reserved and only open up to the people close to them.  Inferior Te tends to have an interest for the sciences in a wonderstruck manner. Does she have a naive way of looking at the world that directly affects her feelings about it? If yes that is usually Fi-Ne. Or is her approach on the sciences something that she strives to understand fundamentally? Ti is very interested in how systems work and Ni tends to develop tiny theories on scientific matters based on patterns.  Planning ahead in MBTI is stereotyped as a J-type trait which is why some people might say INFJ without understanding the functions. I am INFJ and used to be insanely optimistic to which I typed as an INFP and my ISTJ friend convinced me I was INFP. It wasn't until I realized my approach on a lot of things is more rational (Ti), more empathetic (Fe), and more hollistic (Ni) did I realize I was not an innocent dream-like INFP who advocates for her own values based off how the world affects her. I'm more concerned with understanding how the world/people work rather than wanting it to work the way I think it should.  On the surface both are very similar. But you really have to understand how she approaches things."
mbti,3ddkaq,CritSrc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:59:26 2015 UTC,Oh wow. Thanks alot!  I will look into this further :).  When she wants to withdraw she thinks that something is wrong with her. Its something she likes to do but at the same time doesn't want to cause she wants to talk to people.  she wants to definitely learn science on a fundamental level. She wants to go for genetics to learn alot and understand it.

mbti,3dc7yq,MinatoCauthon,6,Wed Jul 15 03:25:06 2015 UTC,I'm an INFJ and I have a very good ISTJ friend. Though our thought processes do confuse each other.  But I don't think that thinking differently necessarily means not getting along.
mbti,3dc7yq,MakhnoYouDidnt,7,Wed Jul 15 05:26:06 2015 UTC,"First off, I just want to say that I'm really glad someone else understands why INFJ's opposite is ISTJ, rather than assuming it's ESTP...ie: the type with all opposing letters.  That being said, it's not so much that I can't get along with this type, but it's hard to find enough common ground to make much more than casual conversation, therefore a deep connection and friendship is often difficult to form. I don't currently have any close ISTJ friends that I know of.  I had a close friend growing up whom I believe was either ESTJ or ISTJ, and although we were very different, we got along for the most part. Granted, it helped that we understood each other from an environmental standpoint (we both came from dysfunctional families.)  Edit: I forgot to mention that my acupuncturist is likely an ISTJ, but I don't know him well enough to say just yet. Either way, he's a great guy. Very meticulous and patient."
mbti,3dc7yq,SquirmGirl,11,Wed Jul 15 06:18:09 2015 UTC,i don't know about 'get along' but if you don't share any functions there seem to be lots of misunderstandings.  my dad is ISTP and i love him and can get along with him but we are so fundamentally dissimilar in how we process things. it's very very difficult to understand eachother on a deep level... there's some kind of fundamental divide there

mbti,3dc7yq,owlcandle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:59:24 2015 UTC,"It may be, but the fact that we're opposites doesn't help.

mbti,3dc7yq,DamascusThief,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:08:38 2015 UTC,We're opposites when it comes to the letters but we actually have the same functions just in reverse order. So ISTP ESTP INFJ ENFJ should all get along with each other easier than someone who doesn't have any of our functions such as INFP who is your functional opposite.  As for your dad I can definitely see how that can be annoying. I guess it depends on how E and J a person is because not every ENFJ or ISTP is the same. Daffodils11 and I have an introvert side - we even thought we were INFJs before.
mbti,3dc7yq,corsetxcandy,3,Wed Jul 15 20:00:52 2015 UTC,That S/N barrier is biggest divide in my MBTI experience.  No I dont want to talk about cars and mortgage rates.  I want to talk about IDEAS! Haha :)

mbti,3dc7yq,thmsbsh,6,Wed Jul 15 06:27:49 2015 UTC,"Your opposite is actually ESFP. An ESFJ's opposite is ENTJ. In terms of cognitive functions, it's always going to be the type with the second and third letters flipped. In these pairings, not only are the functions flipped, but they're also stacked in the opposite direction. So, it's unlikely that you would even end up complimenting each other in some way. (eg: ESFP = Se+Fi+Te+Ni, while ENTP = Ne+Ti+Fe+Si)  ESFJ shares all the same functions as ENTP, just in a different order. So, it's actually not surprising that you have loads of ESFJ friends :)"
mbti,3dc7yq,SquirmGirl,2,Wed Jul 15 06:48:07 2015 UTC,"Strongly intuitive people have a very difficult time forming connections with strongly sensing people, at least in my own experience. If you as an intuitive talking to some sensing person about a grand idea you have and they cant/dont want to listen and just want to talk about the concrete, no depth of bond can form.   Within the circle of the 8 N types, the extroverts (obviously) are more diplomatic (as a population) and have an easier time putting up with people they dont completely mesh with. All my close friends are IN types, except for one who's an EN type. He loves to talk about intense topics, but he also gets a lot of enjoyment taking shots and partying with literally anyone. EN types tend to enjoy the company with anyone but do have a need for abstract discussion.  IN types are like fuckin cats. Im an INFJ, my roommate is a INTJ, and my two other closest friends are INFP and INTP. Honestly, with the exception of Zach (ENFP), we don't really have anyone close outside of the IN tribe. We rarely even date outside of the IN tribe. Chris (INFP) is pursuing another INFP girl. Nick (INTP) is dating an INFJ woman. Micheal (INTJ) is dating an ENFJ girl. I'm trying to pursue another INFJ girl.   Here's the funny thing about that. Supposedly IN types make up like 8 to 13 percent of the population depending on who you ask. INFJ's make up like 2 percent of the population but out of the 9 people I mentioned 3 are INFJ's.   We self select ourselves super hard, which extends to dating. It's so bad that I slept with micheal's girl before they ever met, and chris, myself, and nick all slept with this INFP woman, and then my INFP ex ended up sleeping with her ex boyfriend. We're kissing cousins.   Also, my friends and I clearly like our INFx girls."

Also, I don't use Ne, so I don't really ""get it"" in the same way I might understand an Se-dom/aux party. Even though hanging around lots of them feels equally, if not more exhausting for me as an inferior Se user.  Also, my boyfriend is an INTP, and I easily misunderstand him when he tries to connect with me via Ne. Sometimes, it's fine, but often I find myself saying ""woah, okay, slow down. You're making too many connections. I haven't seen all these TV shows and I've never heard of this video game and I have no idea what a ""doggo"" is and I didn't know that meme existed either and THIS JOKE IS TOO CLEVER FOR ME AND I FEEL STUPID I DON'T WANT TO PLAY ANYMORE ;___;""  Keirsey's theories don't quite add up, function wise. He says that, in general, your best match is the type where the first, third and fourth letters are opposite of your own, but the second stays the same. I can see why that may be beneficial for pairings like ENFJ-INTP and ENTJ-INFP, because the person's top function is the other's inferior, so they may be able to help each other grow and develop strengths in that way. But, for ENFP-INTJ and ENTP-INFJ, each person's top function is not in the other's stack at all. I just can't see it working as well.  Idk, I think Keirsey is a pretty bad source for these things, considering he looks at things in terms of letter dichotomy rather than cognitive functions."

mbti,3d9vt1,SquirmGirl,2,Wed Jul 15 06:09:21 2015 UTC,yep. 4w5s (and probably even more INFP 4w5s specifically) tend to be very withdrawn so dom-Ne is often very draining for its sheer force/energy. i have it in my stack but i'm primarily super sensitive so if something's very in my face i have to check out for a bit. i need peace and quiet with just enough Ne to get me going.

INFPs and ENTJs each have eachother's top functions in their stack but it doesn't seem nearly as common as ENFP-INTJ... i think intuitive-doms kind of live in the same realm but different sides of it, in a way. there generally seems to be lots of electricity there; lots of bouncing off eachother...

mbti,3d9vt1,Qaz_,7,Tue Jul 14 18:27:43 2015 UTC,"intuitives tend to make up most of the MBTI community and tend to be more interested in this system in general so obviously intuitive relationships are more talked about.   INTJ-ENFP is just an insanely common pair (obviously not all of them are crazy about eachother, but enough that you'd take notice), you only need to search their types in eachother's subs to see this ; when you look at the function stacks and how they're both intuitive-doms with the same thinking and feeling functions in the middle of the stack but flipped, it seems to make a lot of sense that there would be such a common easy understanding.  i've seen an INTJ say that they're like inverses of eachother. maybe INTJs and ENFPs can weigh in :)"

However, she never keeps quiet and it's difficult to console her when she gets caught up in her emotions. She's amazing to be with, but staying around her for too long at once will stress me out. Her extroverted intuition (Ne) is difficult to handle and her introverted feeling (Fi) too easily manipulates her.  I've had better relationships with introverted intuitives (Ni) and extroverted feelers (Fe). My significant other is an INFJ and we've had an amazing couple of years. His extroverted feeling makes it easy for him to be straightforward with his emotions, which is what I need as someone who isn't emotionally adept. The pace of conversation is always perfect since we both have the same level of introverted intuition, too.  Anyway, the problem might be that the sensors here are less vocal or that there are some mistyped intuitives. One of my friends thought he was an INTJ for years, but then took the instrument and found out he was an ISTJ. It happens all the time."

Same with INFJ-ENTP, often it's an ESTP, not an ENTP. I am craaaazy about ESTPs, but again I know that if online could meet these people, you guys'd type a lot of them as ENTPs. Whereas actual ENTPs I feel no spark with whatsoever most of the time, I just find that ENTP girls literally always have imposter syndrome, it's sad. Basically, MBTI has nothing to say about romantic relationships.

However, I think I know why.  Unlike the ESFP and the ISTJ. The INTJ and ENFP as individuals are so opposite of the scale that no one would believe in them being together in the first place. Not only that, but they both benefit each other in ways that puzzle pieces click. The INTJ gives fucking stability to the ENFP's life who we know are spontaneous motherfuckers, and the ENFP gives an INTJ an eye opening experience as well as showing them their idealism in the world. Not only that, but they are both primary NiNe functions, which create such a strong connection and synchronization. That's just my input."

He believes that that is the most important category of all because it determines how you begin to process information as well as determining how one speaks. Because comminication is so critical to a healthy relationship, Kiersey believed that N's would naturally form a strong understanding with each other the more they speak and interact with each other; while N's and S's on the other hand, would not naturally get much better at comminication the more they interacted, Unless they made it a point to learn how each person speaks!"

I don't know if it's my strength in N, but I could not be with an S.   More so the ISTJ which is where I'll start--we'd drive each other positively insane! Don't find much charm/fun in doing ways the way ""they should be done"" or keeping one's life  and feelings too private. I am simplifying a bit, but I feel an ISTJ would be super annoyed and triggered by my day dreaming, ""what-ifs"", inability to make a decision , and my overall lack of OCD-ness.    I feel an ESFP and I could get down a little better. They can be a little more spur of the moment and less routine-oriented. Where we may end up initially clicking, but ultimately hurting each other, is in our hatred of disharmony, love of pleasure and easy-goingness can lead to stifling uncomfortable feelings and eep...an eruption.   I can only speak for myself, but E/INTJ really works for me. Aaron (my husband)'s J and T really help me out.

A stereotypical ENTJ is more likely to care. So I think the current state of your post represents reality more accurately."

I haven't personally seen the film, but I've heard from many that Kutcher pulls him off flawlessly. Would that count towards any argument that he's typed correctly as ISTP?

If they're typecast (and not just as something superficial like 'Hot girl') they're probably portraying variations of their own type. If not, interviews are your best bet unless you want to speculate which types produce the best actors (I don't like to do that, though)."

If we can agree that Wozniak's an NTP, then the relevant questions are whether he is Ti or Ne dominant and whether he represses Si or Fe.

mbti,3dd0s9,scarbunkle,2,Wed Jul 15 14:19:47 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia:   Cisgender or cissexual (often abbreviated to simply cis) describes related types of gender identity perceptions, where individuals' experiences of their own gender agree with the sex they were assigned at birth. Sociologists Kristen Schilt and Laurel Westbrook define cisgender as a label for ""individuals who have a match between the gender they were assigned at birth, their bodies, and their personal identity"". They see cisgender as a complement to transgender.   Meaning it's about a person's perception of themselves.  Google's definition when googling it:   denoting or relating to a person whose self-identity conforms with the gender that corresponds to their biological sex; not transgender.   Self-perception again.  Some definitions from GLAAD:   Gender Identity: One's internal, deeply held sense of one's gender. For transgender people, their own internal gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth. Most people have a gender identity of man or woman (or boy or girl). For some people, their gender identity does not fit neatly into one of those two choices. Unlike gender expression (see below) gender identity is not visible to others.  Gender Expression: External manifestations of gender, expressed through one's name, pronouns, clothing, haircut, behavior, voice, or body characteristics. Society identifies these cues as masculine and feminine, although what is considered masculine and feminine changes over time and varies by culture. Typically, transgender people seek to make their gender expression align with their gender identity, rather than the sex they were assigned at birth.  Gender Non-Conforming: A term used to describe some people whose gender expression is different from conventional expectations of masculinity and femininity. Please note that not all gender non-conforming people identify as transgender; nor are all transgender people gender non-conforming. Many people have gender expressions that are not entirely conventional -- that fact alone does not make them transgender. Many transgender men and women have gender expressions that are conventionally masculine or feminine. Simply being transgender does not make someone gender non-conforming. The term is not a synonym for transgender or transsexual and should only be used if someone self-identifies as gender non-conforming."

mbti,3d89p5,BlondeRJ,2,Tue Jul 14 08:53:50 2015 UTC,i think ISFPs are stereotypically artisans... my ISFP friend actually went to art school for fibers and weaving
mbti,3d89p5,bezald,3,Tue Jul 14 16:38:31 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that most XSXJ artists, unsurprisingly, have a preference for creating realistic art with lots of detail. Also, that they tend to paint pretty simplistically. As in, you look at the picture and say, ""yep, that's a horse."" There's rarely any symbolism, but I am often blown away by all the intricate details they're able to produce. One of my favorite artists that I've been following for a long time on DA draws beautifully detailed pictures of fictional characters and historical figures. Mostly the latter. She appears to be a huge history buff and I personally believe her to be an Si-dom of some kind.  With XSFPs, I'm easily hypnotized by how beautiful everything is. They have a real knack for creating an atmosphere. However, I often find myself saying, ""well, this looks incredible, but...nothing is really happening?"" A good friend of mine is an ISFP director, and although his work visually is absolutely stunning, none of it makes sense to me. It's symbolic in a way that I believe only he truly understands.   I can't think of an XNFP artist off the top of my head. They seem to tend more towards creative writing/screenwriting.  XNTP art looks like this."
mbti,3d89p5,SquirmGirl,2,Tue Jul 14 21:07:31 2015 UTC,"I believe that the functions that one utilizes can affect what sort of artistic styles you like. Sensing may appreciate the more 'physical' art, where the meaning is very directly conveyed, whereas Intuition may appreciate the symbolism in the art, and the painter's intention of having the viewer analyze it themselves. I do think that what art you like reflects a part of yourself, too.  I cannot see that much correlation between Feeling/Thinking and art preference; these are methods of structuring the world, not viewing it."
mbti,3d89p5,Mr_Answer,2,Tue Jul 14 10:22:06 2015 UTC,"I always believed the xNxP's had more of an inclination towards ambiguous, abstract art and xNxJ's had more of an inclination towards symbolic, direct art. For example, Hitler (INFJ) disliked abstract art (he labeled it ""degenerate art"") and preferred classical, traditional art that highlighted German superiority. When he was a painter, he painted landscapes as they were and felt little need to distort the scene. Compare that to a Dali (ENFP) landscape. I think in general, NP's are more creative than NJ's as NJ's are drawn more towards an end goal. NP's are drawn more towards ""making art for art's sake."""
mbti,3d89p5,adameladam,2,Tue Jul 14 20:53:49 2015 UTC,"I think you're quite correct. But how can a red square next to a yellow ball inspire anything? It does not. It's a trick. It's like looking at a wall very closely, you're not seeing anything, you're blinded and all that appears is your own intuitive values. You could have had the same realisations while looking at a trash can or watching a pigeon shit. I think modern art is not only a travesti but it's also counter productive... and retarded.  I think all types have their own approach to art, it's only logical and certainly all types can learn how to art or whatever. That said you can't beat ISFPs man. Can't beat that function stack. It's possible for an ISFP to live without having any inner voice and just understanding and thinking through impressions and pictures and sounds. ISFPs think in art."
mbti,3d89p5,AplacewithAview,3,Thu Jul 16 13:09:22 2015 UTC,"I would think so.  Yes.  Sensing = details.  Intuition = symbolism.  There's so many variances, but the above is probably the stereotype."
mbti,3d89p5,BlondeRJ,3,Tue Jul 14 08:03:16 2015 UTC,"Nah, the stereotype is that only intuitives can be artists or be interested in art, no matter what sort of art it is. I think the other half of it is that SPs are clueless airheads while SJs are too busy with their Bibles/Dawkins.   (It should be obvious that I disagree, but I better make it obvious since it's reddit: I disagree with such stereotypes.)  FWIW I don't have an opinion on whether personality type plays a part in the art you like. Most SJs are likely (but not certain) to be less open-minded - but that's less open minded to what you don't understand and appreciate. If they were raised by parents who love Krsyzstof Penderecki and went to lots of metamodern gallery openings, they won't have a problem with the avant-garde (but might struggle to enjoy the classics)  edit: Accidentally so many words"

mbti,3d750z,Odditys,3,Tue Jul 14 05:54:27 2015 UTC,"forgetful, lost in their own head, getting caught up on little facts that may be missing. They dont trust their intuition as much as INTJ's due to their passive (perceiving) nature."
mbti,3d750z,lykke_lis_tears,7,Wed Jul 15 17:01:45 2015 UTC,"I have never known an INTP to be outright abusive, although they can certainly be insensitive."
mbti,3d750z,SquirmGirl,5,Tue Jul 14 07:14:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm dating one. He prefers not to be verbal and let his actions speak for himself, and can sometimes be socially oblivious, but he's very friendly and attuned to whether or not I'm comfortable with something. Not abusive in any way."
mbti,3d750z,BadgerKid96,5,Tue Jul 14 02:37:49 2015 UTC,"I've been dating one for over two years and my step dad is one. Both are in no way abusive, and are very kind and loving to those they care about.  But, this doesn't speak for every INTP out there, and I'm sure there are INTPs that are mean or abusive, but I doubt that they're the majority."
mbti,3d750z,floodimoo123,3,Tue Jul 14 03:00:28 2015 UTC,"If I may ask what type are you?  I think that it depends on how you see them. I can definitely understand how the INTP's I know could seem distant, or cold but I understand that about her personality.   That being said, they might just be an abusive person. May I ask what would have you say that?"
mbti,3d750z,Flux_n_Uck,2,Tue Jul 14 02:29:49 2015 UTC,"i am an INTP. I often act inappropriately, and I realize this. I'm just curious to see how other types perceive INTPs"

Bottom level Fe wants emotional stability, but developed Ne will absolutely snap back at continued rudeness, put downs and talking for us.   Overall, they shouldn't be anymore prone to abusing a person than other types. However, spoiled ones may have an uncalibrated sense of being wronged, so they may lash out inappropriately. I can't speak for them, but offering perspective is about the best you can do with that."
mbti,3d750z,Odditys,2,Tue Jul 14 02:32:55 2015 UTC,but developed Ne will absolutely snap back at continued rudeness   Why do you think that is Ne's doing?
mbti,3d750z,Frozen_Esper,4,Tue Jul 14 05:53:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I made it sound as though only an Ne user would do it. What I mean is that is where it's going to show.   Ne will be the breaking point of dealing with an unreasonable mate, since it is our natural ""weak point finder"" and hole-poker. Unless you have no self-esteem and truly believe you are crap, Ne will see the wrong in what they are saying/doing. It will bubble up and pop out, likely coming with holes you've found in their character as a result of being put over the flames. Ne is what powers our sharp tongues and is the only real part of us that can seem abusive.   Now this is in an unhealthy situation, as I said. We give what we get and this ""sharp tongue"" isn't an issue if things aren't ugly. Typically. (results may vary, not everyone is the same, personalities don't entirely trump experiences, blah blah)"
mbti,3d750z,TurtleSmile1,3,Tue Jul 14 06:41:24 2015 UTC,Totally an individual thing. There's no way you can say stuff like this with any kind of authority.    My brother is an INTP and is a very kind and considerate man. he's a great guy.

So you would say the whole being the center of attention, knowing the right type of humor of the people he hangs out with and being kind of popular, getting hurt when he doesn't get enough attention from wife could be interpreted to be Te/Fi as well as Fe/Ti in your opinion?"

My dad is sociable and knows how to make people laugh, wants company from mum etc - I don't think that's necessarily an Fe thing. The fact that he can be off the mark when doing stuff for you makes me think Fe isn't that strong - an ESFJ would be very good at that. My dad is also sensitive to criticism. I once told him that a top didn't match his pants, and he never wore the top again... I didn't realise until mum told me years later.  You also say that he tries to help co-working with their problems - this is very Te directed - task-solving. My dad believes that problems are really just opportunities. ESFJs love to get involved, but they don't really have that desire to micromanage. They want to get things done in order to keep people happy. Whereas ESTJs want to get things done (their way) because things just should get done."

You mentioned that he micromanaged which is an ESTJ trait, however ESfjs can micromanage as well.

I was thinking of allowing choices for your preferred perceiving function rather than which extroverted function you use since an Si dom will see things differently than a dom Ne user but decided not to in order to keep it simple. Maybe someone could suggest the best version to make, maybe adding an option for every single type to get precise results?  My original hypothesis was that users with Se will be more annoyed by aliasing than people with Ne. There may be a slight correlation but it probably isn't strong. Personally I'd prefer AA enabled, but am definitely ok with not having it on. I see a lot of people on /r/pcgaming who absolutely must have AA, and I wondered, are these people generally a certain type in MBTI who can't stand aliasing?"

They are willing to do whatever is necessary to achieve the desired goal. A readiness to break free from social and emotional boundaries, opinions, beliefs, and restrictions imposed by business and society.

mbti,3d3l5u,TrantaLocked,9,Mon Jul 13 06:26:38 2015 UTC,"Another way to look at it is that Fe users care more about how behaviors affect others around them -- regardless of if the person is trying to be creepy or not, the end effect is that people are getting creeped out. Therefore, that's what Fe users care about. Fi users might read between the lines more, and try to understand the reasoning and root of the behavior."
mbti,3d3l5u,aboose,3,Mon Jul 13 06:29:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is a good point. Fe users see something strange that could also be freaking out others, then judge. Fi users see something strange, judge internally, then find a way to not be freaked out and actually understand the other point of view, then become ok. And they want those around them to do the same. Once you learn to accept ""creepy"" or different things and see they aren't actually negatively affecting you (physically, or with your finances, or mental health), you realize the world is a lot tamer besides the serial killers/rapists.  But a well controlled Fe is really good for the world. Fe users just have to know what is and isn't actually affecting them negatively. Then, they become really good protectors and promoters of happy culture.  I've seen and read a lot of crazy stuff on the internet. My Fi is so open to ""creepy"" shit at this point that almost nothing is actually weird in my eyes...well, not weird enough to make me judge whatever it is I'm seeing. But man ESFJs, it's hilarious spooking them out with weird stuff.  I do want to see some more answers because I might be wrong about it being mainly Fe users.

I'm enneagram 4 so I love ""creepy"" things... or whatever is kind of strange, different, not easily understood, and so on. I'm incredibly open-minded. I agree completely with what you're saying that I do not really like when people call others certain negative attributes without first understanding their perspective or reasoning. It's basically making assumptions, right? But I've seen Fe-users such as INFJs along with a few ISTPs and ENFJs with type 4... I don't think we're mistyped?"
mbti,3d3l5u,corsetxcandy,3,Mon Jul 13 07:24:01 2015 UTC,"So it could be an xSFJ thing moreso.   What I noticed with xSTPs is this: ISTPs generally can like really weird shit, and ESTPs too, but the interesting thing about ESTPs is they can easily slip into a more moral Fe mode and it kind of surprises you. It's almost like this thing in that back of their head that they know they need to be paying attention to but only sometimes do, and a lot of the time you do NOT know when this side will come out. Like, something will trigger that Fe to come out of no where as if they've learned to protect that one value which was hammered into their heads by society until they finally agreed to protect it. But they mainly only complain about issues worth complaining about, which is why I usually agree with them, unless they are fucking with me which is annoying."

On the surface I seem normal, maybe even shallow :p I play the game only to survive but in my heart I am an outsider. Don't like judging people if I can help it.  Fi-users like xNFP rebel far quicker than I do. So in this sense I may see Fi-users as slightly more selfish but at the same time I truly admire you all for your courage to be yourself.

mbti,3d3l5u,SquirmGirl,3,Mon Jul 13 08:22:33 2015 UTC,"I am not easily shocked or creeped out. Si is impressionistic, so if someone appears out of the normal (out of an Si framework) it could look uncanny. Sense data that has an impact on the subject will be indicative of Si. Fe wants to impose a value based order (because feeling is extroverted onto the environment). So this may be why ESFJs will be vocal.  You won't often find me behaving like that.   My ISTJ friend gets weirded out easily. So it's not so much of a Fi/Fe based split. Fi/Fe are how feeling based value judgements are processed. So someone may get an initial impression and then process this."

Personally, it takes a lot to creep me out.

I'd say INFJ and INTJ have the worst issues while Se doms also have the issue but funnel it into healthy eating habits and fitness while inferior Se users struggle with the negative aspects way more.

I do have body image issues, and a lot of it comes from the fact that I just never really really feel in touch with my body at all. It took until just last year (I'm in my mid-twenties) for me to look in the mirror and finally, truly grasp that I was practically skin and bones. I just didn't look healthy, even though I felt fine. It makes sense, seeing as at the time, I wasn't watching what (and how much) I was eating and did not exercise. At all.  I've felt a lot better about my body since I started monitoring my food intake (I actually needed to be eating a lot more, not less) and began exercising regularly. This is indeed, something Se-doms seem to recognize automatically and begin much earlier, while inferior Se isn't very in touch with their bodily needs and may not get involved in exercise/athletics until later in life.  But then again, I'm sure there are plenty of inferior Se users who were raised by Se-doms, and developed healthy eating/exercise habits as a result of the good example set by their guardians."

Extroverts are more likely to have bulimia and binge/purge. Introverts are more likely to have anorexia and restrict intake. Most people with eating disorders have some level of perfectionism, rigid adherence to rules, and sometimes difficulty understanding or processing complex emotions. Eating disorders are of course mental illnesses and anyone with any personality type can develop them. However, there are definitely personality factors that lend themselves to enabling an eating disorder and the subsequent body dissatisfaction."
mbti,3d3c5v,littlesoubrette,2,Mon Jul 13 16:32:50 2015 UTC,"Boy. It's hard to say. I'm an INTJ and growing up I had body image issues even though I would think my type wouldn't care much about it. If I had to guess, I'd say ISFJ. They often take things personally and are usually very sensitive people. Plus, they're introverted so that often adds an opportunity to isolate yourself and not talk about your feelings.    I think all types could have body image issues, but I believe ISFJ's would be the most at-risk, if you can even say that about this sort of thing."
mbti,3d3c5v,TurtleSmile1,4,Mon Jul 13 05:01:22 2015 UTC,"Si doms tend to be very comfortable or familiar in their bodies compared to Ni doms, though. They're more natural in tune to what makes them comfortable, and thus aren't likely to overeat because that would make them uncomfortable. They would also be more in tune to hat their body is feeling in general, making them theoretically less prone to, for example, mistaking thirst for hunger (which I do all the time).   Also, while it is true that an introvert is less likely to share their feelings, the ISFJ is a feeling dominant type. They are more likely to reflect group values than types who don't use Fe, so that would also play a apart in their sense of self.  I think that the INTJ would pretend not to care about body image but secretly wish they were better because they wish they were better in all areas of life at all times, generally. I think the INTJ would also be more likely to hide feeling like that, or even to harbor them, due to tertiary use of Fi."

And despite it not generally being accepted as a scientific theory.  Models of the world are either valid or they aren't and hero worship should have nothing to do with it."
mbti,3d1r41,hawkxor,3,Sun Jul 12 20:46:20 2015 UTC,"I think, at the core, here is where I'm coming from:  I was raised Mormon, and on the first Sunday of every month members would go up to the pulpit and ""bear their testimony"" (basically, everyone in the congregation had the freedom the preach the truth of the church). Hundreds of thousands of Mormons have done so in church history, and I saw it almost every month of my life for nineteen years. These Mormons have told millions of metaphors, inspirations, and experiences that they see as supporting the truth of their church.  Where is the line? The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is not the one true church in Heaven and Earth, like most active members would claim. What separates MBTI from the LDS church, when both are scientifically invalid, both are based purely on subjective observation?  The acceptance of Jungian typology can and probably should give way to acceptance or understanding of other Jungian ideas: the mind arbitrarily divides itself into conscious and unconscious, and also arbitrarily divides reality into concrete and abstract reality. ""Concrete reality"" is the one we imply when we say ""reality."" Science is the study of concrete reality. It is really the only one we need, and as a whole it doesn't accept MBTI (because it doesn't properly explain concrete reality).  Abstract reality is different, but just as important. A huge amount of decisions we make every day are dealing directly with what is, at this point, completely unknowable. Death, art, love, fear. Science can only give us a limited understanding of these ideas, and even a scientific understanding of them doesn't actually give us control over them.  Both MBTI and Mormonism give insight into this abstract reality. I'd argue that MBTI and Jungian psychology does a better job of it, but maybe that's just because it resonates with me. They are ways to cope, they are ways to feign understanding, they are ways to face the coldness of concrete reality, they are tools for us to improve ourselves, and tools for us to connect to others. They are closer to an art than to a science."

mbti,3d1r41,hawkxor,4,Sun Jul 12 21:22:39 2015 UTC,"Big Five is the name for a set of empirical observations that facets of personality reduce well to 5 principal components.  It makes no attempt to explain why and it's not a model of personalities.  Myers Briggs says that the four basic functions have inward and outward versions that differ. Some people are Fe and some people are Fi, for example. And this is independent in a nonlinear way from the question of being T or F. It offers an explanation for why there are 16 discrete types rather than continuum because the balance of inward and outward leads to certain equilibriums. (And connects this to the 4 dichotomies by explaining why each means, for example J/P is whether your dominant outward function is a judging or perception function, which we can then understand the connection to observed traits.)  One main reason I am credulous of all this is that I can directly and reproducibly observe the difference between for example inward and outward feeling in people, and correlate it with dichotomy observations, following a pattern that is more complex and therefore more meaningful that simply correlation. I can also visualize how the whole system fits together and offer hypothetical mechanisms."

The interesting stuff is below the surface, in all the stuff they feed to the factor analysis, ie. all the things being an extrovert makes you more likely to be/do/etc. But the top level view doesn't show that, same as with the MBTI test (the axes measure similar things as Big 5, at least judging by the inventories they use)."

mbti,3d1r41,googajub,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:24:43 2015 UTC,"When you get to the cognitive functions, even if they have no scientific validity and thus no official support from much of modern psychology, they are still useful IMO. I can see the functions manifesting as predicted in every case I've observed so far, and that helps me personally. I'm personally not doing it to prevent something bad happening, but because I gain an analytical advantage and also simply because it interests me. While MBTI obviously invites a comparison to the Big Five, I don't think cognitive function theory is very comparable to either one because what it sets out to do is ultimately completely different (even if [and also because] it isn't very empirical). I don't think many people here take cognitive function theory or the briggs-meyer iteration of it scientifically. just because it isn't verified doesn't mean it isn't useful."

I don't think many people here take cognitive function theory or the briggs-meyer iteration of it scientifically   But they do take it as gospel. You can see how people become so dogmatic (I've heard someone say that ""Socionics will always take you down the wrong road!"" like someone is a bible study class talking about alcohol) about it or place it so hardcore into their identities (people who think they are NJs but aren't) just like religious fundamentalists do.   And for one final thought, just because it isn't verified doesn't mean it isn't true.   But that statement is true for every single religion in the history of the planet.  You have to separate ""truth"" from ""science"" and ""concrete truth"" from ""abstract truth."" Science does not equal all truth, science is a specific method of learning and using truth."

I just stopped trying after a while; there's only so many times you can fight people before the unnecessary aggravation that you keep inflicting upon yourself becomes absurd. But I'm glad you're bringing it up again. Some people on here are so incredibly arrogant. They'll go on making truth claims about the nature of the human brain with absolute certainty. That's a level of hubris I can't even begin to understand.  That being said, I think if we used the MBTI dichotomies as a way of representing clusters of similar traits instead of insisting that Jung nailed human cognition, first try, and with no evidence, we'd be much better off. I think merging MBTI with the FFM, in some manner, would be beneficial to both systems. It gives the FFM a way to become more accessible to laymen and a way to organize random numbers into a taxonomy. And the FFM gives MBTI a much needed empirical grounding."

The MBTI dichotomies aren't Jung's idea, they're an attempt to make a function-type assignment tool (and are a poor one at that, which is why the test is becoming more and more Big 5-ish by the day).  You don't really need to merge the MBTI test with the FFM - they're largely the same thing already, just with different terms.  Merging the functions and the FFM could be interesting, but I don't know if it's all that necessary - like function typology and Enneagram, they talk about different things and complement each other nicely."

There are two different and mutually exclusive ways of understanding MBTI. Type dynamics and the dichotomies. I choose the dichotomies for a variety of reasons that I'd rather not get into here, mostly related to the dubious nature of type dynamics.   You don't really need to merge the MBTI test with the FFM - they're largely the same thing already, just with different terms.   That's exactly why I think they could benefit each other. The FFM has the benefit of using traits instead of the rigid structure of type dynamics. If MBTI would accept that the rigid structure of type dynamics is problematic, then it would benefit from a higher degree of empiricism. I've even considered the value of turning the functions into traits. If you scratch the theory away and try to measure if a person has both Fi and Fe, for example, it would be interesting to see how valid the functions are as independent constructs (and that's how I prefer to look at them anyway). Imagine the FFM+measures of Fi, Fe, Ne, Ni, etc.. Those constructs may prove to be valid and reliable traits (I tend to think, with the exception of Ne and Ni, that they probably are). In any event, the FFM would certainly benefit from some taxonomic method. Borrowing (loosely) the idea of types is a good way to organize the undomesticated free flowing numbers that the FFM throws at people. It could make the FFM more accessible to the general public, which in turn might help fund some interesting research.   I don't know if it's all that necessary   It's certainly not necessary, but it would be interesting."

Notwithstanding a tendency towards prejudice (disliking certain types) which I consider unhealthy, there's a benefit of analyzing relationships based on typology.   For example as an INFP I generalize that I can usually cooperate with NFJs due to common ethics, but we can't communicate as efficiently due to the P/J conflict. However the case is reve rsed with and STJ because our functions are oriented the same in reverse order.  Finally, STP has a personality that bears little commonality and minimal opportunity to collaborate. I know that socionics goes into this in more detail but I'm more engrained in MBTI and interested in these type of relationships."

mbti,3d1r41,Lawtey,3,Mon Jul 13 05:30:52 2015 UTC,"It won't surprise you that I'm of the same mind, given our very lengthy conversation the other day. It was fruitful, and untangled a lot of concepts; it still did not lead to concrete or definitive answers, but just further questions and a refinement of core concepts. The nature of the system is abstract. If one holds Jung to be an INFJ it is clear why this may be.   That is not to say that abstraction is irrelevant. Mathematics works on our internal abstract framework, and is not derived from concrete reality, but translates onto it.  If we have these compass points in our minds, we may be able to translate them to describe the world around us, but when stood on the north pole, everything is south (thus the concepts break down), so there are limits to its application.   Science is also not quite as concrete as it seems. The truths generally lie in how well abstraction corresponds to concrete reality and vice versa. Take a thermometer. It doesn't measure temperature. It measures the distance travelled by an expandable liquid up a tube. We take the abstract inference from this that this will be indicative of a change in temperature because we expect heat to expand the liquid. However that still requires a lot of abstraction to explain. So concrete reality and abstract reality must be able to account for each other. If one puts a hand in front of one's face and sees atoms and mathematics whizzing about, this is no less real than noting that it has 5 fingers.  Ultimately we have to find where the limits to those concepts are. Many churches don't even attempt to do this. They even obfuscate where the limits are. That's the key difference here. (Keirsey certainly obfuscated the limits. The guy was a hack.)  The problem with MBTI is that it has so little translation onto concrete reality. The abstract concepts are mostly entangled. There's a very poor definition of most of the functions (the socionics definitions are largely entangled with someone's vision of how a person may act in a social situation; an estimation and nothing more). I keep coming back to it, simply because it's elegant, and I can't unsee it."

Jung said that the four functions are [just as arbitrary as the four points of a compass, and just as indispensable].   Such a practical dude. I like it.   That doesn't mean we can't give insight into another person's type, or have fun arguments about whether Goku is an ISFP or an ISFJ.   I don't even know who Goku is but I am utterly certain that:   He's ISFJ. Because Fi.  He is an enneagram 5 because if he was a 7 that means he has to be ENFP and we all know that would never be true. As an ISFP ISFJ wait ISFP, no J, no P, wait door number 4, P! J!

Once you really start seeing it, it only gets better. And Ni users see it too (possibly more strongly but in a different way), but they seem more likely to criticize MBTI than Ne users, especially INTJs for some reason.   MBTI describes real shit. Some guy even proved it when he looked at brain patterns of people, and saw that it is 80% likely any two people of the same type share similar brain activity. https://www.pdx.edu/sysc/sites/www.pdx.edu.sysc/files/neuro-systems.pdf, and the full talk at google (can't remember when he talks about the 80% thing but he shows the slide eventually):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGfhQTbcqmA  So he proved that INFPs and ESTPs have opposite brain activity, just as MBTI suggests.

Yes, I feel like typology is very real (though this isn't limited to N types!), but at the end of the day it exists in a realm outside of science or pseudoscience. It's a system that brings order to the abstract, murky mess of the psyche.   Nardi's work is interesting, yet problematic in the same way creationist science is. He began with a conclusion rather than a hypothesis and selected evidence to support it. Another issue is that the people who participated in his studies spent 10 days researching Myers-Briggs to determine their 'best fit' type, and I'm sure many of them ran into the beginner's problem of over-identifying with stereotypes in descriptions and/or mistyping. If you decide your 'best fit' type is INFP and learn that you're supposed to be an empathetic listener, couldn't that boost activity in the 'words of self and others' region? If you decide you're an ENFJ and learn you're supposed to have great social skills, couldn't that boost activity in the 'social feedback' region? I know that 10 days into learning about typology, I was semi-consciously 'proving' to myself that I actually was the type I was considering, and it definitely altered my behavior in the short term. The premise of Nardi's research is that type=behaviors=EEG, so if I decide I'm an INFP and act like an INFP, won't those regions light up more even though I'm an INTP?   In the end it's fun stuff but it doesn't prove that typology is scientific. It's like running EEG's on people of various faiths doing activities related to their faith. Doesn't prove their faith is empirically true."
mbti,3d1r41,TrantaLocked,3,Mon Jul 13 21:22:11 2015 UTC,"But we are talking about things we know we are already like. Things we do and are like before we learn about MBTI.

It actually isn't. Stop making bullshit comparisons that don't actually say anything. You can't control what the strongest parts of your brain are, so an ESTP trying really hard to be another type will still have similar ""ESTP"" brain activity. Pretty much everything you said here I've already thought about, and none of it disproves anything, but rather fits into the overall abstract map.  Typology is not scientific in the traditional sense, but what it describes is real and happening in the brain. The functions are simplifications of real brain differences in humans. And there is no issue with it not literally being pure science, because it's still real. The scientific aspect does lie in the observations you can make of real people. Over time you can actually see how dom Se looks like in real life, dom Fi, etc. THAT IS scientific. Real observations, and apparently some people are afraid to call MBTI legitimate just because you have to use some imagination to connect these observations together."

And I don't think it's right to decide on behalf of the single  person to sacrifice themselves.   In my opinion the individuals right to live outweighs your right to feel good about saving the other five lives.   Nobody would kill a person and use both their kidneys to save two people who need immediate live saving kidney transplants, so I don't see why anybody would do it with the train."

I could save them, but I do not feel comfortable sacrificing somebody else's life in order to do so, therefore I would not save them."

I see that you have said that you would save the five, well that's fine, I respect your decision, but quit trying to question my reasoning when you don't even offer any yourself."

What you end up doing is sacrificing 5 people for 1 instead of 1 for 5.  Were there no one on the other track you'd not hesitate to pull the lever, it's pure circumstance that one person happens to be there. You either sacrifice 1 or you sacrifice 5, you're by no means in any way more entitled to sacrifice 5 just because those 5 would die if you weren't there to pull the lever, you are there, you can pull the lever.  Just to clarify, I wouldn't pull the lever either, I just think your arguments are way off."
mbti,3d064d,platypus_soldier,2,Tue Jul 14 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"Yes but you are going on the assumption that Human lives are commodities which can be traded and compared, and therefore the best outcome is to preserve the maximum number of lives no matter what the cost. personally I beleive that humans are not commodities, you cannot compare the value of one human to another and they are therefore incomensurable.  If I were to offer you five cardboard boxes each containing a mystery object or one cardboard box containing a mystery object, which would you choose.   As the value of each box is undetetminable, there is no right or wrong answer, And this is how I also view this train problem."
mbti,3d064d,ihqhevonen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:29:43 2015 UTC,"When it's undeterminable you're just left with 5 and 1, aren't you?  In your example you present me with 5 boxes and 1, I have reasons to assume there's something fishy going on. The scenarios are completely different, you have no reason to assume the one life is of higher value than the 5 combined. All you're left with is 5 and 1.  I agree human life is practically immeasurable, but regardless of what it is you think is ""valuable"" in any form of way the 5 are more likely to reach a higher ""value"". The exception here would be if you have a value system where less humans is better.  Here's a relevant example for you: You and your friend find 6 goldmines, there is zero knowledge as to whether there is more or less in any of them, you just know there is gold in all of them. No person would let his friend pick out 5 random gold mines and keep only one for himself."

I'm not going to justify nor encourage their decision to walk down such a literally dangerous path, especially since they all knew better and had plenty of alternatives.  I don't think it's right for me to decide if these people should live or die.

By removing the trains from the previously established equation, you  completely miss the idea behind the problem.

Then how does that change the situation the OP presented? I honestly don't see the difference whether the trains come or not -- aside from a few corpses.

mbti,3d064d,ihqhevonen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:08:54 2015 UTC,"It changes that the 5 people aren't taking a stupid risk, it has been publicly announced that no trains are to run on that track that day, if they ever want to check the track out then that's the day to do it. I'm just trying to create a situation where all 6 people are there of their own free will and neither of them are guilty of being reckless.  The situation is that there is a train coming that is about to run over 5 people, or switch track and run over one. It has been specifically announced that no trains are to run on that track that day what so ever, for whatever reason that track is dead for the day, yet there's still a train there about to run 5 people over because someone somewhere fucked up miserably."
mbti,3d064d,aNinjaWithAIDS,2,Tue Jul 14 10:18:27 2015 UTC,"Still, it's common knowledge not to walk/play on railroad tracks regardless of the schedule or the circumstances. These 5 chose the risk, and therefore should be an example to everyone else how dumb that decision was.   There are plenty of ways to get where the tracks eventually lead to, so I see no worthwhile reason why they needed to follow the railroad so precisely."
mbti,3d064d,ihqhevonen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:50:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the one is being equally reckless, everyone knows there is no train to be ran at either of the tracks, still there is one and the 5 aren't being more reckless than the 1. Why not switch the tracks then? The one is being just as reckless, why is his recklessness more okay? If he wasn't there wouldn't you pull the lever to save the five then? Why not do it now?  I wouldn't switch the tracks either btw, for far more egoistic reasons, it wouldn't matter if they were all tied to the tracks or not either."

Here's the thing: I would expect any group of people to be smart enough to come together and not take the railroad tracks for any reason. Assuming these 5 were kids, then it's still their parents' fault for not being there to supervise and teach them better.   The one is being just as reckless, why is his recklessness more okay?    It isn't; the one is just as guilty. So, the 5 died in his place; and I hope that also makes him reconsider the price and stupidity of his decision that day.    If he wasn't there, wouldn't you pull the lever to save the five then? Why not do it now?   No. Like I said earlier, that would glorify their stupid decision. To do so means to become a hero among fools who simply knew better, which would feel quite insulting to me personally.   People always expect me to live with the consequences of my decisions. So, why deny these 5 the consequence of their collectively dumb decision? It's a simple case of ""addition by subtraction""; 5 fools gone is a much bigger favor for the world than 1."

Shouldn't a trained professional be operating it and threatening to arrest me for trespassing? It's illegal to tamper, too. Wouldn't I be opening up a legal can of worms?

Plus, the likelihood of someone in that group of five doing something to benefit this world if higher than the likelihood of that one person being beneficial.

If I was truly put into this situation, surely I would have at least a little bit more details to make my decision."

mbti,3d064d,jermofo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:32:00 2015 UTC,"Save the 5!  Although... The 5 have all made a choice to risk their lives walking the train tracks. That one guy that is on the track where the train isn't supposed to be headed shouldn't have to die because of the 5 others stupidity.  Although... We can't know what the lone guy is thinking, he may be just as a stupid risk taker like the other 5.  Tricky question without knowing the variables."

mbti,3d064d,Poropopper,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:33:13 2015 UTC,"ISTP, would yell at them all to move out of the way and decide from there.  But if supposedly they won't for some reason, I'd let the train run it's natural course. They're five people on train tracks, at least one of them should've been paying attention to any incoming trains.   The lone hiker I would sort of let be, considering the fact that the train wasn't supposed to go on that track anyway, so he shouldn't be getting the consequence.   Edit: Then again, this is only if I had enough time to think about it. My natural instinct would be the save the 5, but giving me five minutes to think would make me do my choice above."
mbti,3d064d,dDShocktrooper,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:57:54 2015 UTC,"Just a quick clarification question, what if they're not in range of hearing you? (I think any reasonable person would yell at them to move off the tracks if they were in yelling distance)."
mbti,3d064d,adameladam,2,Sun Jul 12 16:35:31 2015 UTC,"I would honk the horn, make a racket, throw something at them, anything to get their attention really.   But in the end, they're on the train tracks, a train barrelling down at them should be enough. If they don't notice it then I guess they'll get hit."
mbti,3d064d,hmwith,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:51:41 2015 UTC,"XXFP/XXTJ, change the direction of the tracks and head for the one person walking alone. Try to throw them off the tracks to save them, maybe dying in the process."
mbti,3d064d,Jawzper,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:05:36 2015 UTC,"I'd spend so long thinking about it that the train would strike the 5 anyway. I'd never decide properly, and whatever I'd do, I'd feel guilty afterwards."
mbti,3d064d,LoneWords,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:58:08 2015 UTC,"INTP.  Maybe I'd save the five, but I would prefer to mind my own business.  The Polish have a saying:  ""Not my circus, not my monkeys"" and I think that applies here.  I respect the guy that is also just walking along minding his own business, even though he is on a train track.  The five on the other hand, if a train can hit all five at once, it was probably meant to be.  If it wasn't this train, it would be the next.  Hanging in groups that are so blatantly oblivious to risky behavior are going to have a bad time sooner or later.  As we all know from Final Destination, Death will catch up to them no matter what."
mbti,3czav3,neiluj,15,Sun Jul 12 03:37:02 2015 UTC,"Yes. I sometimes doubt if I'm really INFJ. And I secretly hope that MBTI has horrible predictions about human behavior and psychology.  Every psychologist I come across casually, both clinical and research-oriented, I ask about MBTI. They always say, MBTI has strong reliability, which means its results are mostly consistent. It has poor validity, which means it is not really set up to measure what it measures (personality). Personality is definitely more than the 16 types.   I'm an INFJ. I'm not really sensitive. Unlike many INFJ's, I get energy from interacting with people and don't feel uncomfortable. But it could also be the environment in which I grew up, so maybe it's a trained thing? Hahaha.  Why do you ask? Fill us in on your story, too!"
mbti,3czav3,Greenbananas123,3,Sun Jul 12 04:11:25 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I doubt that I'm an ENTJ because of how quiet I am in comparison to my friends around new people and because of how much of a spaz I am when I get bored. My sense of humor is very, very odd and off the wall... Kind of Jim Carrey and Eric Andre show-esque."
mbti,3czav3,The_101st_Voyvoda,4,Sun Jul 12 04:32:36 2015 UTC,"The ENTJ stereotypes can be really inaccurate. I for example actually care about people and tend to speak very eloquently most of the time. The ""spaz when bored"" is also true, doing silly things is a great way to make time pass. It's also how I get my best ideas. Don't get caught up in stereotypes. I am yet to see a soulless megalomaniac super-alpha CEO of an ENTJ that we're all supposed to be.  P.S. Social vs functional extroversion and introversion don't overlap perfectly, especially in Ns. That's why there are many ENs that think that they are INs."
mbti,3czav3,Greenbananas123,2,Sun Jul 12 07:40:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm... The spaz you describe, I've totally seen my ENTJ friends do. Usually not at work, though. In social settings."

Extroverted feeling (Fe) would definitely give you a boost when talking with other people. You might stumble a little when you speak because that's typical of people with introverted thinking (Ti), but being receptive of others is definitely typical for INFJs according to what MBTI dictates."

mbti,3czav3,corsetxcandy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:15:38 2015 UTC,"I definitely feel like an ambivert at times. I actually read that ENFJs cannot handle alone time well. I'm fine by myself. I need time on my own here and there. If I were left alone to not talk to a single person for 2 or 3 days then yes, I'll go crazy. What about you?  Edit: I thought I was INFJ for a time but I'm too high energy."
mbti,3czav3,daffodils11,2,Sun Jul 12 18:34:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm fine by myself too. What a weird thing for someone to write! I actually really like my own company. I get lonely/flat after a while because I like to interact with others, but definitely not all the time. The internet is a wonderful place! I get homesick for alone time if I'm around people too frequently.   I thought I was INFJ, but I extrovert my feelings too easily/often."

mbti,3czav3,daffodils11,2,Mon Jul 13 20:21:22 2015 UTC,I find it interesting that you think they're more grounded. Can you expand on that?
mbti,3czav3,Greenbananas123,2,Tue Jul 14 03:02:38 2015 UTC,"Hello~ sure! I guess ""grounded"" might not be the best term. What I meant was that my ENFJ friends are visionaries, yet they know how to get the practicals down. Whether it be financial management, giving sound practical advice, etc., I've found my ENFJ friends to be very grounded in reality despite their ability to see into the future very well. I think sometimes it manifests itself as control, though, so their spouse or family might find it hard."
mbti,3czav3,corsetxcandy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:02:32 2015 UTC,Grounded sounds right to me. I try very hard to be practical although I have a very dreamy side.
mbti,3czav3,wildernessexplorer,3,Wed Jul 15 19:57:28 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I question if I'm an INFJ, because it's hard to relate to anyone on r/INFJ. It's frustrating actually, because I think most of them are from confused INFPs. I think a few people over there agree with me. Posts like, ""Does anyone else have crippling anxiety and hates that nobody understands them?"" I just can't relate..."
mbti,3czav3,_mildude,3,Sun Jul 12 13:54:21 2015 UTC,"Ni is a unique process, so I can see how many INFJs would feel like nobody understands them. Plus INFJs are supposed to have a want to instigate change in a positive direction, so when people just don't get where they're coming from they may feel like that. Anxiety isn't really necessarily correlated with type.   However, I do agree that it's likely many people in /r/INFJ and /r/INTJ are mistyped simply because they have a disproportionate amount of subscribers to other MBTI communities. that could also be partly explained by intuitors in general favoring the internet, but I don't think it explains it completely."
mbti,3czav3,wildernessexplorer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:35:12 2015 UTC,Perhaps this is a better example.
mbti,3czav3,SquirmGirl,3,Mon Jul 13 22:22:53 2015 UTC,"Many posters on r/INFJ are certainly not INFJ. There are hoards of mistyped INFPs running wild over there, which in my experience is true of almost every INFJ forum. Just another reason why I'm always quick to argue that typing by letter dichotomy alone, rather than understanding your cognitive functions, is never the right way to go."
mbti,3czav3,wildernessexplorer,2,Tue Jul 14 21:51:37 2015 UTC,"Precisely. I have never been professionally typed, so I cannot say for sure I'm an INFJ, either. However, in looking up the functions and researching the similarities in my personality with the descriptions, it is what I identify with the most. What can be very irritating for me is hearing people try to switch the letters around saying things like, ""I thought I was a P, but now I know I'm a J."" Or even, ""I thought I was an E but now I know I'm an I. I can go back and forth though..."" It just seems like it's almost impossible for me to have a conversation about functions or real personality traits that actually contribute to the INFJ personality. It becomes this circle-jerk of how much everyone can't handle humans around them all the time."
mbti,3czav3,SquirmGirl,2,Wed Jul 15 00:44:51 2015 UTC,"It becomes this circle-jerk of how much everyone can't handle humans around them all the time.    Oh god, you hit the nail on the head with that one. All the ""nobody understands the real me and I'm so depressed"" posts get old quickly, too. Don't get me wrong, I'm very sorry to hear so many members are depressed, and I can certainly relate, but it's just so excessive. I also don't think it's healthy. I've not heard of a single, truly depressed person say they feel any better after wallowing in their misery with equally depressed people. ESPECIALLY not Fe-doms and Fe-auxs...  I personally CAN'T be around other depressed people when I'm depressed. I go out of my way to hang out with my optimistic friends, or I wait for it to pass on my own."
mbti,3czav3,wildernessexplorer,2,Wed Jul 15 05:56:39 2015 UTC,"My sentiment, exactly. In order to bring yourself out of something and gain perspective you need to understand that there is something outside of your depression. Indulging in depression only furthers it's grasp on you, and who can escape a trap they have laid out for themselves, unknowingly or knowingly. I understand if you are seeking sympathy or care for your situation, but that would warrant you to give yourself a way out of it as well. In explaining away your right to feel better, all while others are perpetuating that for you, there is no way for you to actually fix your issues. This, in my opinion, is not an INFJ quality. If anything, and INFJ would most likely indulge in extroverted sensing (their shadow function), and in doing so distract themselves with other things as a coping mechanism. This is something I have definitely been guilty of in my life, and it actually helps me (at times), to get away from my issues and come back to them when my head has cleared. In feeling as if nobody understands you, it inhibits you from understanding anyone else. This could definitely be a maturity thing, of course. However, it could just as much be a mistype of your MBTI."
mbti,3czav3,SquirmGirl,2,Wed Jul 15 18:02:22 2015 UTC,"In order to bring yourself out of something and gain perspective you need to understand that there is something outside of your depression. Indulging in depression only furthers it's grasp on you, and who can escape a trap they have laid out for themselves, unknowingly or knowingly.   I agree, definitely. I also think that Fi-users are more prone to falling into this trap, seeing as they don't naturally see things outside of their own feelings. Fe is more likely not to identify with any internal feelings, seeing as feelings are more often the focus of their environment and the external world. This can make it easier for them to pull themselves out of a depressive state than Fi-users, but they're going to have a hard time identifying why they feel depressed. Especially if their depression tends to come on suddenly when they're alone, rather than being a clear result of being in a toxic environment, or surrounded by unhappy people. Fe needs to be able to A) talk out it's feelings with others, and B) engage in Ti to analyze potential reasons why they're unhappy, and come up with solutions/coping mechanisms to help themselves.  Something I just can't see a Fe-user doing is openly discussing their personal, negative feelings on an image board supposedly full of people who are easily affected by negative feelings. Fe should know intuitively that they risk bringing others down by doing this. Furthermore, I cannot see a Fe-user wallowing with said depressed users, saying things like, ""yeah, I totally know how you feel"" and revealing their entire life story with little to no regard to the OP's feelings. Fe wants to make people feel better, not worse. Fe even tends to feel guilty/selfish if they spend a lot of time talking about their feelings, rather than listening to how those around them feel.   Fi, on the other hand, is naturally attracted to people/atmospheres who give off the same vibe as their current state of emotion. This is why I'm always skeptical of depressed ""INFJs"" posting long, personal rants on /r/INFJ about how melancholic and misunderstood they feel by society. Especially if they bring their personal values into it. I am equally skeptical of other ""INFJs"" who chime in on the conversation with their own personal tales of woe, with little to no regard to the OP's personal feelings.   See, Fe says: ""I can understand how you must be feeling, because I empathize with you. I can offer you a shoulder to cry on, or x number of coping skills that I think might suit your personal needs."" Fi, on the other hand, and only if they actually relate to the person's feelings, says: ""I totally understand how you feel, because I sympathize with you, and have been through similar struggles. Here, let me tell you all about them, and/or here's some things I've done that have helped me feel better."" The internet is a great place to anonymously express your feelings, which can make it an easy target for people who have difficulty expressing themselves in the real world. Ie: Fi-users.   If anything, and INFJ would most likely indulge in extroverted sensing (their shadow function), and in doing so distract themselves with other things as a coping mechanism. This is something I have definitely been guilty of in my life, and it actually helps me (at times), to get away from my issues and come back to them when my head has cleared.    YES. OMG. I was extremely guilty of doing this growing up, and would engage in Se in extremely negative ways. Ie: eating nothing but fast food and sugar, abusing drugs/alcohol, self-harm, excessively masturbating, etc. I'm still prone to engage in Se when I'm stressed as an adult, but I've channeled it into more productive/healthy means, such as dancing or exercising. For example, last week I was feeling down and didn't know why, I forced myself out of bed and did 90 squats. That's all it took to clear my head, and realize I was feeling shitty because I was lonely. I hadn't engaged with anyone outside of work and my boyfriend for almost a week. I had a good cry, felt much better, texted a friend and made plans to go to the beach with her the next day.   In feeling as if nobody understands you, it inhibits you from understanding anyone else.    Definitely. Personally, if I feel disliked/misunderstood/abused/etc for too long, I'm not particularly inclined to wallow in my sadness of being disliked/misunderstood/abused/etc and use that as an excuse never to engage in the real world with other people. This is more related to the Fi-Si loop. Rather, I attempt to shut down my Fe entirely. I become cold, detached and almost schizoid-like. I stop being able to empathize with anyone, let alone myself. I may even delude myself into believing anything is wrong with me. I still get my Ni ""hunches"" about other people and dive right into analyzing why they feel this way in a way that's almost robotic, forgetting to empathize with them as fellow humans in the process. Emotion is completely left out. This is what I assume to be the Ni-Ti loop. I don't know enough ""actual"" INFJs to know for sure that what I'm describing is what we all go through, but I hope I'm not totally off the mark right now.  I'm rambling at this point. My point in responding to you is that A) I agree with your entire post, can definitely relate, and do not for a second doubt your INFJ-ness, and B) I'm pretty sure at least half of /r/INFJ posters are mistyped Fi users, which is why many of us often feel skeptical/uncomfortable posting over there."

mbti,3czav3,vicarious_passenger,3,Sun Jul 12 05:36:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Sometimes I doubt I'm an ENTP. Like, I went hiking with my siblings. They all fell at least twice and didn't see things they tripped on. I was completely aware of my surroundings. So sometimes I think I'm an ISTP. But other times, when I start thinking about the world and how I wish everything could be fair (even though I known it can't be) and get emotional about it, I start to think I'm an INFJ. If I ever consider changing my type because I have the ""evidence"" for it, I always come back to entp the next morning. So I just try to ignore the doubts. It's like I'm in denial but for a just cause."
mbti,3czav3,_mildude,4,Sun Jul 12 16:33:16 2015 UTC,"types with extroverted perceiving dominance should generally not have a problem with their physical environment since their first impulse to to process it, regardless of if that's sensing or intuition you're using. An Se user would obviously be the most in-tune to what's exactly there, but an Ne user also deals with his environment directly, in a way. it's just that they're making connections basically immediately upon perceiving an object instead of acting without thought. I think what may be more important in a situation like you described as far as talent goes for that sort of thing is if that the subject is Pe dominant, after all, if you are an ENTP it's not like you have Se, but you need to experience your environment somehow."

mbti,3czav3,Inaban_,2,Sun Jul 12 10:34:09 2015 UTC,"The other types I thought I was at first was INTP. I decided that I was ISTP based on the following reasons:   I'm never completely tuned out of my surroundings and I am able to tune out my thoughts and focus on what's around me. This was a big indicator for Se. I read a lot and I am able to handle theory, but all the reading I do must always be able to help me in some way in the future.    A lot of you might wonder how I thought I was an INTP, but both of these types can be nerdy and are very emotionally similar. A question to tell if you're INTP or ISTP would be to ask yourself how much you would like a discussion about: What would happen to society if every human on earth went blind and deaf right now? An ISTP might be interested in this conversation, but would most likely listen, while an INTP would probably get really into it. An ISTP would also get bored after a while and would want to start doing something else, but an INTP could talk about it for hours."

mbti,3czav3,_mildude,2,Sun Jul 12 12:08:24 2015 UTC,"just because you aren't organized doesn't mean you can't be an INTJ. That's a stereotype arising from the creation of Myers briggs that every J type is organized is every case. In fact, since the INTJ has a dominant function of Ni, it will be one of the less organized judging types along with the INFJ. I would suggest researching further into the cognitive functions to make your decision, thinking about the actual method you use to experience and process info, instead of your behaviors which result from the method."

I started to notice that I was developing stronger ideals for how I should act and generally became more attuned to my internal formation of those ideals.

I want to be a teacher for English. You are helping me a lot with creativity. English teacher to me means ENFP > ENTP.  c. People call me sweet. I suppose I am. This also seems ENFP > ENTP. Going by a stereotype here but, ENTPs like to troll and are naturally argumentative, a little far off from sweet.   Therefore, it seems likely to me that OP is an ENFP vs an ENTP. I could be wrong though but I feel like the probability is in favor of ENFP."

mbti,3cxawg,AMomentsReprieve,3,Sun Jul 12 19:28:14 2015 UTC,"Some questions :   Do you find it easier to think your thoughts through when you talk to someone vs mulling it over alone in your head? Do you tend to remember people better by their name or by characteristics/descriptions, i.e. ""sunglasses guy"", ""blonde guy""?

mbti,3cxawg,AMomentsReprieve,2,Sun Jul 12 20:13:35 2015 UTC,"Bleh hate talking with people through my thoughts. I enjoy my time alone at night because it's the only time that I'm sure to have where I can think/meditate alone with no chance of someone interrupting my train of thoughts.  I definitely remember people better by their aesthetics. Ex from GoT:   Erya (?) Stark - Cool short hair chick who has a sword called Needle. Little dude Lannister. Bitch sister Lannister. Golden hand Lannister. Bald fat dude with no gonads.   Sorry, watched all 5 seasons of GoT this past week, that's what I've got on my mind lol.   When you get really really upset, do you numb your emotions?   Hmm. When I get really upset I usually just listen to like John Mayer, Fallout Boy, Blink 182, etc. and lay in my bed. That's only when I get really sad though. Umm. I'm not sure, maybe i'm just usually content, or not in tune with my emotions; really haven't thought about it. I don't get angry really at all, just disappointed or short tempered when people slow me down. Not sure how to answer that last question, sorry!"

They are the best part of childhood that I can remember, and many of the people that I met before my homeschooling are my closest friends even today, because they knew me before I...changed(?). I was seen as very energetic, hyper, always happy and wanting others to be happy.   Now, in university, many of my friends from summercamp are attending the same university. Whenever I talk to them as I am, it's as though I'm to serious/realistic/technical/logical/systematic/etc; but if I had taken my Adderal, had caffeine recently, or even a sugar rush, my responsiveness is elevated and I am much more quick on my feet, comical and witty; functionally would look like Te + Se.

I would be saying the first thing that came into mind, not really worrying about the future, thinking that everything would work itself out; but I've become more realistic now and started trusting 'thinking my way through it' more than 'hoping for the best'.  I may value balance. I maybe usually be balanced so I don't even think about it. I don't know if this matters, but I don't like my hands to get too oily or greasy/sweaty etc. So I go about washing my hands about every hour or so. I don't like hair being on my forehead - for some reason I start to tear up when it is o.o . These may be signs of keeping balance?

By the very nature of Fi vs Fe, Fi users are more likely to talk about themselves because Fi users dwell on their own feelings vs Fe users being aware of or in tune with others.  ""Fi is all about subjectivity, and a difficulty in conveying how one feels with the restraints of language. Think IxFP here.""  Your point about Fi being about subjectivity is true, it is indeed more subjective than Fe.  ""Meanwhile, Fe is more in tune to how our culture conveys emotions, and should find taking about feelings more natural.""  Fe expresses feelings more naturally, but talking about them is a different story. I would think that Fe users, by virtue of the Fe function, have more trouble understanding their own feelings vs the feelings of others.  ""PS: Might want to eliminate that stereotype. I'll troll only if I don't like someone. Fe makes me uphold some social conscience when there's no reason to question it.""

I'll try to type you with cognitive functions   I also, especially lately, but even in 12th grade loved connecting things - I can see how everything in the world an beyond is and can be connected to everything else.   This sounds like strong Extroverted iNtuition (Ne), which links you to xNxP types [ENFP INFP ENTP INTP].    I really enjoy people – they fascinate me, but they are my biggest fear.   Would you say that you use psychology to try to understand them, since you enjoy knowing how they think? Or is it more that you want to know how to make them happy when they need it?  Do you sometimes feel very deeply offended by something that someone else says, when they may not have intended to offend you?   What do you think is the purpose of philosophy? (Take your time on this one, since that could be the key to the puzzle)  I've asked these questions to try and narrow down your type. Hopefully, I'll have enough info to conclude afterwards. :)"

I still feel that way, to understand them, but now I use it as a way of seeing what happened in my past or their past and why it is that they are who they are today. I still feel socially awkward, atleast during conversations. I'm not much for small talk, but I love asking/answering questions or sharing thoughts that will make people think. If we don't benefit by learning something new or seeing a different perspective, then what was the point?  Sure, I would say that I sometimes feel deeply offended.  What is the purpose of philosophy? That is a hard one. I would say that the purpose is to share ideas and see a large amount of different perspectives then find the few things that they all have in common and make that your philosophy.

The first bit sounds a lot like Fe, as you've spotted yourself... Trying to ""fit in"" to society, rather than over-exaggerating your moral individuality (Fi). The analysis of the past to try to understand the entire person sounds a lot like Ti... Trying to understand all the causes and effects going on in the system.   I'm not much for small talk, but I love asking/answering questions or sharing thoughts that will make people think.   Ne-Dom confirmed, pretty much. Also more evidence for Ti. ENTP then?   Sure, I would say that I sometimes feel deeply offended.   Hmm... That was my test for Fi. To rephrase the question, would you say that you feel deeply offended if someone questions your morals?    I would say that the purpose is to share ideas and see a large amount of different perspectives then find the few things that they all have in common and make that your philosophy.   That just screams Ne+Ti to me.  Yup, at this point I'm over 90% certain that you're an ENTP. You seem to have too much Fe to be an INTP (Although we can't rule it out completely), and you seem to use Ti, as opposed to Te, which rules out ENFP.   Maybe have a read over This Article, especially where it breaks down ENTP's use of Ti. See how much you relate.

mbti,3cvimi,superange128,6,Sat Jul 11 03:07:29 2015 UTC,"I can typically put someone into a grouping within meeting them and having a short interaction (assuming I'm actually thinking about it); some individuals fall stronger into one of the many categories. This person is an XSTX, this person is a socionics Alpha, this person is an EXXP, this person is an XXFP. I'm typically 99% sure of this one particular grouping. I'll usually have a guess or two from there, and then it'll take me a couple of weeks to narrow it down and really know for sure.  I'm about 80% confident in my ability to correctly type someone, though I probably stay with my opinion of the person's type (after the two weeks) 95% of the time."
mbti,3cvimi,WhatINeverSaid,2,Sat Jul 11 05:27:03 2015 UTC,"For fictional characters, it usually takes me about 15-30 minutes of their screen time to figure it out. Since actual people tend to be more complex, you'd need more personal and complete relationships to guess their types accurately.   For coworkers I feel like its harder to find out their F/T function until they talk about their personal lives and interests. I work at an office and work closely with my group and I figure out their S/N function by observing how they make decisions related to the job. Sometimes Im not really confident though.  As for friends and acquaintances outside work its a bit easier to figure out their F/T function by the way they interact or talk about their interests. However, the S/N function for me is really hard to figure out unless they are really obvious of with they way they make decisions (people with very very strong dom Se seem to be easy to pick out for me).   Here's the thing: your coworkers may be P-types in the majority (thus the introverted judging function is stronger). By contrast, your friends may be primarily J-types (whose introverted perceiving function is stronger). Your question seems to be ""How do I know what each person's introverted functions are?"" Quite simply, recognize what empowers that person's reactions as well as how and why they talk and work. What drives them personally? Of course, you're not going to notice these things immediately since they are introverted functions: the very tendencies that people prefer to keep to themselves.   However, the S/N function for me is really hard to figure out unless they are really obvious of with they way they make decisions (people with very very strong dom Se seem to be easy to pick out for me).   You seem to have Se well recognized (good for you, by the way), but you seem to want to know how to recognize Ne in a conversation. Basically, Ne is ""observation through correlation despite differences"". The NP's are going to be very good at recognizing what isn't being said or otherwise missing in a broad sense. They are going to question things according to any given theme of ideas in the current context. When Ne acts, it does so ""to spark"" different things into the situation."

Some Fi user can be fiery and obstinate, even when being playful. Te users don't have too much focus on having clear definitions and having all the answers, and are much more structured then Ti users. They just do things for what's efficient at the moment. People with Fe tend to accomodate, mediate, and make sure everyone is ok. They look at other's emotion objectively and work with that. They're more likely (I repeat ""MORE likely"" it's not like Fi user don't) to have a good wide smile. Ti users are analytical, and like to ""destroy"" incorrect assumptions, revel in correcting others and clarifying, can be nitpicking and coupled with some Fe use, they can twist words to make things look better than they seem, using ""legalese"", while still being technically correct. Ti users tend to gather intel for longer and use that information to build a solution.  This is obviously a general idea and not a definitive way to identify types."

And for some people it's just that obvious. Se-doms or Aux are easy to spot. When you spot a Se dom, you only have to guess if he's Ti/Fe or Fi/Te. and you know if it's ESTP or ESFP. I usually start by looking if I get any clue, doesn't matter if it's J v P, N v S, T v F or E v I. If zie gives an extravert vibe or an introvert vibe. Then if I can't find anything, I start identifying if they're Fe/Ti or Te/Fi axis. After talking to them for some time, you'd know if they favor inner harmony or global harmony by the way they judge situations. Then I try to start figuring out if he's a Ne/Si or Se/Ni user. Do consider that some times people of one axis display functions of the other, because all functions are present in us, so try to look for more clues. Other times, I start by Kiersey Temperaments (NF, NT, SJ, SP). Don't feel hindered to follow one single method, and don't stop at the first guess. Bias can be tricky."

Opposing force: Big problems, but rarer problems. Looking back you'll see you faced problems related to this function just a handful of times. You can usually semi-confidently use this function, and you'll be impressed by its use (unless it is used against you, then it will have a strong negative effect).  Demon: Constant, nagging problems. Like a parasite. Best metaphor would be ""Blood"" by My Chemical Romance or ""Drain You"" by Nirvana. Sometimes it will feel impossible to escape the negative influence of this function.

Furthermore, I don't think he really has a platform/marketing angle.  He couldn't even be bothered to comb his hair before he announced his presidency.

When it comes to ticks, gestures, interaction styles and other physical tells, Sanders' matches INTJs very well. These are actions. If by ""act"" you mean ""believe in,"" that's another story altogether. There are leftist/liberal INTJs; his politics don't make him Fe; his looking out for the users, people the crowd in hierarchical systems could definitely be argued due to Fi, if anything, so I don't think that's a substantive argument.  Also, what of his behavior makes you think Fe? I literally see very little interpersonal engagement whatsoever from Bernie's interviews. If we get anything, it's the rough staccato of emphasizing some statistic or a ""IT. IS. NOT. ENOUGH."" Te-Fi on steroids, imo."

mbti,3crptf,glabius,2,Fri Jul 10 13:42:13 2015 UTC,"I agree. I believe he is an INTP enneagram 2. So, why do I believe this? INTP 2s are probably quite rare (speculation of course, as I can only speak from personal experience), and I believe INTP 2s can be easily misdiagnosed with strong Fi. INTP 2s care so greatly about their causes, they can seem like ""they're just doing what they believe to be right"" due to the fervor of their convictions. The easiest way to differentiate an INTP 2 is whether or not they have devised an elaborate ""system"" to solve the problems which trouble them so deeply. Another way to differentiate them is by asking whether or not they'd be able to let go of a held belief if it did not solve the problem. I am an INTP enneagram 2, and though I believe strongly in many causes, I would gladly let go of those beliefs if they were found to be universally detrimental to society. I think Sanders has drawn information throughout his life from many sources about what works best in society, and has formed a ""system of political opinions"" from those observations. This is very indicative of introspective Ti-Si.  I believe Sanders has devised a thorough ideology which he truly believes will correct the issues before him. By using bills as physical manifestations of his ideological constructs, he attempts to implement the system he has devised (Ti-Ne). I also believe Sanders has managed to overcome typical INTP-itis, due to the high rate of follow-through on his actions. This can appear like Te, but I believe it is rather Sanders' ability to effectively regulate his Ne. Sanders has many creative ideas regarding solutions to problems, and has introduced numerous bills throughout the years (Ne). I interact with many heavy Te-users on a day to day basis (IXTJs, mostly) and that desire to generate AND implement numerous new ideas, rather than just come up with one that ""seems like it will work"" (Ni) and implement that is definitely present in him. Although Sanders believes many topics are important (Ne), he sees an overarching systemic cause controlling all of them (economic inequality)(Ti). I believe Sanders is simply a highly competent and mature INTP. I could of course be wrong, but this is what I see in Sanders."
mbti,3crptf,Astronomy1,2,Sat Jul 11 03:33:28 2015 UTC,"Now I'm torn.  You make a pretty good argument for INTP.  I was leaning towards INTJ, but older, well-rounded INTPs and INTJs can be hard to distinguish between.  The large part of my argument was a lack of Fe, but that could easily be due to INTP's inferior Fe.  I think that I'm going to look for written statements from Sanders.  I find them easier to disentangle.     Edit:  I think you are right.  I'm changing my vote to highly functioning, mature INTP. I see the Ti now."
mbti,3crptf,jermofo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reading my explanation :P. Many MBTI fans probably look at me and assume strong Fi due to my fervor regarding certain causes, but if they were to analyze the way I think rather than what I think, they'd easily see Ti-Ne. The motivations of altruistic INTPs can be really confusing with regards to identifying them as INTPs. An interesting study would be to see whether INTPs with high altruistic traits get along better with those who have Fi high in their function stack as compared to INTPs with low or average altruistic tendencies. It is my experience that my motivation enables me to have a better understanding of Fi-leading individuals. It is very easy for me to understand the thoughts of XNFPs, whereas I have more trouble relating to most XSTPs than would be expected considering they share our first function. That really might be due to my total disuse and lack of understanding of Se rather than any other factor, though. I understand Se in theory, but have never been able to put it in practice. I always drift away and start thinking of new ideas/etc about the world based on whatever observations I had been making instead of experiencing things in the moment and taking them at face value."

Marty is impulsive and avoids thinking about consequences where Rust consumes himself of his tragedies internalising them."
mbti,3co7lh,KNIGHTMARE170,3,Thu Jul 9 14:32:35 2015 UTC,"Marty could be an ESFP. He could be an ESFJ, even though ESFP seems more logical.   Rust is more complicated to type. He is INxx for sure though. There are different opinions, but I think he is an INTP. A damaged INTP.  From personalityjunkie.com   This is not to say that INTPs ignore what’s happening in the outside world (although they may be somewhat less concerned than INTJs are). Rather, they analyze it with an eye toward furthering their understanding themselves (Ti) and the human condition (Fe). Because INTPs have Fe rather than Te in their functional stack, their Ne is more drawn to exploring Fe sorts of information. This is why INTPs share much in common with INFJs (who also use Fe and Ti) and tend to be most captivated by things like philosophy, psychology, and religion. The T information INTPs do manage to collect (e.g., scientific or historical facts) is generally done in hopes of furthering their understanding of themselves and human nature.   ""I know who I am. And after all these years, there’s a victory in that."" - Rust Cohle > Self-analysis, which is more likely to be an INTP thing. EDIT :  I realized that Cohle knows he has synesthesia. He couldn't have found it without self-analysis and desire for knowledge.  He is not interested in any sort of social game, the guy has ""found himself"" and wants to be real, even if he knows how to adapt to find the answers of the investigation.  I would add that he seems to have an extraverted intuition.  Many people tend to see Cohle as an INTJ because he's a tough guy. I don't know, he doesn't strike me as an INTJ at all, perhaps an INFJ but not INTJ.  Any thoughts ?"

mbti,3co7lh,Captaindecius,0,Sat Jul 11 02:08:24 2015 UTC,"This could not be less true.  Rust has got to be one of the most obvious Ns I've ever seen.  This site totally mixes up his negative view of the big picture with him not being inclined towards big picture thinking.  Rust is disillusioned with big picture reality but also obsessed with it.  To quote Marty """"for someone who thinks existence is pointless, [he] sure do[es] fret about it an awful lot."""
mbti,3co7lh,MrJudzey,2,Wed Jul 15 04:07:37 2015 UTC,"I just think he's far too reliant on intuition to be a Ti dom. His Ni seems off-the-charts strong to me. I'm thinking INTJ or INFJ.   Edit: To elaborate a bit on Ni.. His method of analyzing crimes isn't (or doesn't seem to be) based on the type of deductive logic we typically associate with T. He relies very heavily on hunches or gut feelings. And he says mystical stuff like ""I can smell the psychosphere"". That's just not the type of language I would associate with an INTP."
mbti,3co7lh,toyouitsjustwords,2,Sun Jul 12 23:25:55 2015 UTC,"Not convinced Rust is INTJ. He's not using Te too much, and is naturally getting into the minds of the killers using visual clues at the crime scene which is a sign of subjective logic (Ti). He doesn't appear much like other INTJs whatsoever in temperament and attitude (thought this is merely initial inspection). His analysis is much more Ti; his thought is not objective, and very much his own. He uses Ni, as exampled in his poetic insights ""I don't sleep, I just dream"".   The reason why INTJ might crop up may be because the writer is likely a fan of Nietzsche and a lot of it makes it's way into the show.  I think what you're looking at is an Ni dom for rust. However I am hesitant to conclude INFJ because of a fear of only seeing what I want to see, which is what I suspect the majority of the MBTI community revel in doing. Plus, this is a character, and the writer clearly did not have Jungian functions in mind when constructing him, so whatever functions you do see are likely to come out garbled.  I think when we unconvolute Nietzsche from the mix we get INTP, with a repressed Fe. However, I would like to highlight that many INFJs also show a retraction from ""the social game"", such as: Hitler, Plato, Mohammed Attica, etc.   The environment he lets himself live in is also sign of a repressed Se (also getting intoxicated in the pilot episode).  Ultimately, this post is futile because there is so little understanding of the way the functions precipitate into reality, and the character is not written in any way that corresponds with them."

INTJs are famous for having an unhealthy set that's totally uninterested in maintaining relationships. feels like he's ""mainlining the secret truth of the universe"" which I associate with Ni and not the deliberate methodical nature of Ti.  Marty Hart: ESFJ  He says something along the lines of ""at some point it's a bad thing for a man not to have a family."" Which I associate with a general SFJ attitude. He feels sorry for Cohle after seeing his apartment and makes a lot of emotional appeals when arguing with his wife which could be Fe. I'm less confident about his type than Cohle's."

In another comment, I said why I think Cohle is in the INxP-dom, and particularly INTP, you should read it, if you want.   I think, on the contrary, that seeking the truth is a huge characteristic of many INTPs (I didn't say that INTJs don't do it, it's just rarer). The metaphor of ""mainlining the truth of the universe"" is very representative of the way Cohle wants to learn and to know everything. He reads a lot, is interested in subjects like philosophy and religion (he likes to know how people work, why do they believe, make theories.).  I think he has an introverted thinking. During his monologues, you can guess it's not improvisation (and that's the only function he does not ""improvise""). He's not expressing directly his thoughts out loud, he has learnt concepts and made theories, and when it's becoming clear in his mind, he expresses it. He uses Marty as a ""tester"" of his thoughts. I think you can find it on YouTube, but there is a deleted scene with his girlfriend Lorie (grammar ? I think we spell it like that) and his behavior is very different with her.  Being uninterested in maintaining relationships is more of an INTx thing. Also, Rust lost his daughter, his wife, lost contact with his family. I understand why he's so damaged and doesn't want to engage relationships anymore.  Nic Pizzolatto made him have synesthesia, which I think is a great exemple of extraverted intuition. Ne users tend to have creative minds, and in Cohle's case, this creativity can be expressed with synesthesia and his hallucinations. We know later in the show that he likes art and painting. He makes connections very quickly, too.  INTPs are seen as thinkers and theorizers but INTJs are seen as strategists. INTJs like to have control but INTPs like to keep their options open.  We see with the ""2012 Cohle"", that Rust isn't a strategist. He's messy, he drinks, but at the same time he still wants to know the truth about the murder cases. He keeps his ""options open"" and waits for the right opportunity to talk to Marty about his gathered together knowledge. He adapts very well but still improvises, he doesn't make plans (The 6 min scene in episode 4 is total improvisation ; he tried to make a plan but couldn't follow it.)  Thank you for the comment !"

Marty I'd say ESTP - so much Se, so much Fe.  Edit : some good points made about INTP for Rust, could certainly see it. I see his theorising as a means to an end though, very Te, so I'd be inclined to sway more towards INTJ. Definitely INXX anyway."

If you have a situation and understand the mechanics behind it, are you more drawn to thinking of how the cogs of it turn than on evaluating what you have at hand and what you can make of it?

The differences between introversion and extroversion can be quite subtle, but as we're human, once we've picked a side, we like to exaggerate the differences between ""us and them"".   It sounds like your big thing is mental/emotional personal space. So, people being noisy is irritating, because it distracts you. You don't trust people, you don't initiate friendships. Basically, you sound like a private person, which is generally associated with introversion.   However, it is really hard to say without any idea of the rest of your type. As others have said, you can't just pull out one element. You need all of it for it to make sense."
mbti,3colfu,_mildude,3,Thu Jul 9 19:46:07 2015 UTC,"I think it would be easier to focus on which specific cognitive function you use than it would be to decide if you're specifically introverted or extroverted. It would also be a far more useful descriptor to know your entire type. Myers Briggs is not the four letters at face value, they're a code for an underlying system you use to take in and process information. Thus, introversion versus extroversion tells you practically nothing compared to the information contained in knowledge of the complete system."
mbti,3colfu,onspace,2,Thu Jul 9 15:16:01 2015 UTC,"Here is an excerpt from my notes about introversion versus extroversion.    The introvert gains energy by spending time alone as he focuses more on his inner world than on the outer world. Thus, the introvert is more reserved since he doesn't require as much outside output to sort through his ideas. They could be described as reserved, silent, calm and distant.  The extrovert gains energy by spending time with others. Extroverts are commonly well known in their entourage and achieve personal satisfaction through social interactions. Unlike his introverted counterpart, the extrovert thinks out loud and needs to interact to make sense of his ideas.  They could be described as outgoing, chatty and energetic.    With that being said, I would go for Introvert. In fact, based on what you wrote, I'd go so far as to say you're an ISTP (but that is pure speculation though)."
mbti,3colfu,_mildude,3,Thu Jul 9 22:00:07 2015 UTC,"I think that it may depend on the orientation of your judging function whether or not you think out loud, to some extent. When thinking is introverted, the subject uses deductive reasoning and they only need to justify ideas in their head, so outside explanation is an afterthought regardless of whether or not it's the primary or auxiliary. When thinking is extroverted, it seeks outside verification of ideas. It doesn't need to follow a concept all the way, but only to the point where it suits the subject's intention. So, the subject may seek verification either through outside discussion or actual trial and error of ideas. I don't think I have any proof for this idea though; it's just something I've noticed occurs sometimes. I may be wrong."

mbti,3cpipw,DeadMage,6,Thu Jul 9 19:06:50 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking that you're mistaking test results for being of any stable type, and probably putting too much stake in the test results.  There's two main ways to assign yourself a type / get yourself a type code.  The first is assigning yourself four letters by taking a test (or doing it yourself), the second figuring out what cognitive functions (~=go-to habits for taking in, evaluating and organizing information) you use. Both give you the same kind of code because the approaches have a lot of shared history, but the meaning behind the code is different because of how it's arrived at.   Using a test or otherwise looking into the four dichotomies to get a code and then look what kind of functions you're supposed to use from that is usually a bad idea (for example, I often get IxTP results from tests - this would mean I use Ti, which I don't - I'm a very clear Te type). Despite being different, both of these approaches give you valuable information but should be kept separate because they mean very, very different things.  The tests / dichotomatic approach ranks you on four different scales that are more or less separate from each other - ie. your score on one shouldn't influence your score on the others much at all. Having only a slight preference one way or another here is normal, and actually pretty much expected. The test results tend to fluctuate a good bit as well, especially so if you have only mild preferences one way or another - mood, the day, the alignment of the stars and whether your cat clawed your eyes out in the morning all become a large influence in your responses.  What the test letters mean, roughly: I/E = introverted/extroverted. Do you like being out and about, esp. around people. N/S = Abstract-minded or concrete person. F/T = Do you go more on sentiment and accomodate others or reason in a cold, detached way. P/J = How organized, scheduled, conscientious you are. The more P, the more disorganized and spontaneous, the more J, the more organized and planned.      Each of these scales has a bunch of subgroups, or facets that measure some different traits that get put under whatever letter heading, so you don't need to embody any one dimension fully to get a score on it.  If looking at this, it makes sense how eg. getting a job would make you seem more J - and by the test's measure, you are - and the results of the dichotomatic test actually told you something useful about yourself. But I wouldn't use them to assign yourself a functional type. The test results fluctuating also makes it kind of odd to try to assign a type code based on a 50% split on the scale, so I'd probably just take a Big 5 test - it tells you how high you score on some things but presents the results in a way that gives away that they're meant to be fluid, measures more or less the same four things as the MBTI test does, and includes a fifth scale that measures how swingy or stable your emotional state is, which is obviously useful information.  To explain that better, let's look at the other way to get a type code: figuring out what functions you use.  The functional approach is a rough model that tries to explain how you take in, evaluate and organize information by dividing the information processing into four core processes (Thinking, Feeling, Sensing and iNtuition) each of which has two attitudes (ie. extraversion, or interest in the external world, and introversion, ie. interest in what is going on inside your head) and then figuring out which processes you use in what attitudes. They're often shortened to a function code of Core process and Attitude, ie. Sensing in the extroverted attitude = Se.  Two examples would be an inclination to use the Thinking function focusing more on personal models, their accuracy and looking for root causes (introverted Thinking, Ti) or the state of the outside world or analyzed system, exerting control over it and making the most of what you have (extroverted Thinking, Te), or using Feeling to focus more on the harmony of the group and people's expressions of sentiment (extroverted Feeling, Fe) or on being true to yourself and looking at the motivations behind expressions of sentiment (introverted Feeling, Fi).  To contrast why it's important to focus on the meaning behind the code rather than the code itself, Test/Dichotomatic ENTP v. ENTJ, for example, is basically asking whether the person is more haphazard and spontaneous or more planned, conscientious and orderly - it's directly what the tests measure and the types differ only on one scale. They're both extroverts and iNtuitive Thinkers.  In Function-land, where we look at how the person takes in, evaluates and organizes information, the meaning is different. Here we find that ENTPs and ENTJs use an entirely different set of processes:  ENTPs are primarily watchers who lead with extroverted Intuition (Ne) - it's an exploring, brainstorming kind of process that draws its inspiration from the outside world and is very interested in it, and complement that with Ti - an evaluating process that focuses on building accurate mental models of things. How the cogs turn is more important than what that turning accomplishes.  ENTJs lead with extroverted Thinking or Te - cold, detached reasoning like Ti, but focused on evaluating the properties of the outside world and exerting control over it, usually with the aim of ordering it to be more efficient. They complement this with introverted Intuition, which in contrast to Ne's curious exploration just drinks in tons of information and subconsciously finds patterns in there that it then condenses it into a holistic understanding of how something ticks that the Ni type himself often needs to work to ""map out"".  In short, they're totally different :D  Same applies to INTP vs. INFP - in test-land the difference is a slight preference to Thinking or Feeling type items in the questionnaire, but in Function-land an INTPs primary processes are Ti (dominant/compulsive) and Ne (auxiliary/habitual), while INFPs lead with Fi and use Ne as auxiliary - they share the habitual process and their dominant function is introspective, evaluative in nature so their minds are kind of similar in construction, but the compulsive, dominant process is different which is a very large change.  tl;dr: Same code, different meaning. Keep them separate, and they will be useful to you. Try to force them to align, and you'll only confuse yourself or end up acting in a non-genuine way."

mbti,3cm6c5,Orikon32,6,Thu Jul 9 00:05:41 2015 UTC,"That's almost certainly intuition (though I've seen Se/Ti users do something similar), but could be Ne or Ni.    what they're most likely capable of and what they're not capable of.   I'd lean towards Ne, ENFPs and ENTPs are amazing at seeing peoples' potentials. Ni does it too, but it is a little more vague (or super-mega-specific). Ni isn't particularly known for seeing potential, while Ne is.   though the user is aware of it happening (that,lets say,""studying"" of the person) and can even be a conscious thing.   Ni and Si are typically unconscious, the user isn't actively aware of them. Ni and Si usually act as passive flashes of insight.  So yeah, in this specific case, with just the data you've brought, I'd guess XNXP. Probably not INTP. If they aren't worried about being strange I'd lean more towards ENXP. INFPs have enough Si to be more generally aware of/care about their weirdness, a lot of them come across as really ""basic"" until you get to know them."
mbti,3cm6c5,WhatINeverSaid,3,Thu Jul 9 01:19:26 2015 UTC,I agree. This sounds pretty Ne/Ti to me. But that just to me highlights the similarity of the NTs. Often coming to the same conclusions but through different means.

mbti,3cm6c5,WhatINeverSaid,2,Fri Jul 10 00:17:18 2015 UTC,"Ni isn't particularly known for seeing potential, while Ne is   You have to be kidding...  ""If we treat people as they are, we make them worse. If we treat people as they ought to be, we help them become what they are capable of becoming"" - Goethe, ENFJ.  ""As far as men are concerned, it is not what they are that interests me but what they can become."" - Satre, INTJ.  I mean one of the key traits in the popular understanding of the INFJ is that they see straight through people, or straight into the core of people. I mean they're so often called the Psychologist or Councillor. It's pretty much the archetype of INFJ.  Ni is said to be somewhat predictive of the future, so I see no way that this cannot take into account potential of future possibilities.  Wittegenstein (INFJ) says in his Tractatus that an object is not only what it is, but all possibilities for the object.  Ni is very well known for seeing potential. Seeing potential is it's damned cornerstone, it's just a different way that it goes about it.  Considering you're an ISFJ with repressed Ne, you'll have a much better understanding of Ne and the potential it sees, than Ni. I mean I have no clue what Si does apart from that I'm told it's an internal structuring of facts and impressions -- quite literally sensation that gets introverted. So since you know (not you personally, but I didn't want to sound puffed up by saying 'one') about Ne and it's role, you could just flip that on it's head and say: ""well I have this potential seeing function, if I introvert it, I build all the potentials that the way the world could be, on the inside, which gets toyed with until it comes out in a different form. It's less spontaneous, and more of a storehouse of potential and themes, maybe like Si is with facts and impressions."""
mbti,3cm6c5,MrJudzey,3,Fri Jul 10 14:41:28 2015 UTC,"I'm really sick of arguing with people about Ni... Ne is the best function for seeing ""what they're most likely capable of and what they're not capable of.""   ENFP: Use Ne/Fi to help those they care about (Fi) see their own potential. Every ENFP I know is really amazing at making people feel really good about themselves, making them see the best in themselves.  ENTP: Use Ne/Ti to understand what people are capable of from a more practical level. I've seen ENTPs, for example, build up a large group of contacts that they can call upon when they need help.  Personal example: My boss's boss is an ESTJ who uses Si/Ne to do this exact thing. He is amazing at hiring new people, he can tell when they are going to be reliable or not, he can tell when they are going to last long in a job that has a high turnover.  I said in my post that Ni sees potential too, but it is always in the context that the people you quoted put it in. ""An object is not only what it is, but all possibilities for the object,"" that doesn't really mean anything in a practical sense. That's more of an expression of an abstract truth. While Ne users do use Ne for fun and silliness, their evaluation of potential is going to be more direct, like ""This person has a huge capacity for love,"" or ""This person will become a great programmer"" while Ni might feel like a person has potential, but not necessarily the specifics of their capabilities/incapabilities. The Ni user almost experiences the potential of others, feeling it to their bones that this person is special, but as I said, their evaluation won't be as specific as OP implied."
mbti,3cm6c5,WhatINeverSaid,3,Sat Jul 11 05:02:33 2015 UTC,"Of course the Wittgenstein quote was an abstract truth, it was Wittgenstein. However, it illustrates the generation of potential that Ni uses quite nicely. The other two you plainly didn't to address, and are salient as can be. Of course context matters, but I'm not seeing how this detracts from my point that Ni sees potential just as easily as Ne does.  You didn't address that since Ni is commonly understood to be time variant that it will see the potential of people down the line; just as concrete as the examples you gave.  You might consider Ni silliness because you don't use it. I hardly think an ENTJ would consider the potential of their company, and precisely where it's going in a crystal clear vision, a silliness. There are plenty things about Si that I consider silly sure, but I appreciate that this isn't in my personal preferences. You instead have jammed your bias onto your own conception of the theory.  As I laid out Ni is similar to Si, which may help you to understand how it operates as far as potential and possibilities go. This is just as obvious as how Si operates. It would be more accurate to say Ne is the best at generating many possibilities, than just stating it's best at generating possibilities. Since Ni acts like a storehouse of possibilities, (as Si stores facts and impressions, Ti stores logical structure, and Fi stores feeling based structure) Ni it is still creating possibilities, but fewer.  I argued what you said, that Ni isn't known for seeing potential, which it is. I gave you reasons that INFJ is known as the councillor, because Ni is seeing the potential in people to that extent. You haven't touched this either. If you have something that is contradictory, it is welcome.  I wasn't arguing what op said, and op was vague. There's no indication that he's looking for specifics. Nevertheless, I think you have only taken into account wishy washy INFJ crap, which I suspect because you've deemed it vague or super-specific (which is plainly not the case). Ultimately, these ideas of Ni are poorly conceived, so I don't blame you for supposing it. It seems to me that you've formulated your conception from these dreadful ones. In fact there's nothing to say that, since Ni stores possibilities, that an Ni dom would have seen how a myriad chain of possibilities progressed before, they may be a less superficial and more specific (not super-specific), because they can synthesise their internal intuitive framework to generate a likely chain of possible events. An INTJ wouldn't exactly be feeling it to their bones. It's held that Netwon and Tesla are Ni doms and could generate lots of plans for machines in their heads and see how they would work in their minds eye, and come out with the one that would work. They're still generating potential, but it doesn't come out straight away and it's less obvious, less spontaneous.  A shrink may see exactly how his patient will progress when he's taken off his meds if the shrink has seen that pattern of all manner of possibilities before. Since Ni is compounding possibilities, ""this person will become a great programmer"" still falls directly under the Ni scope because although Ne is more direct, Ni simply stores it and after a bit of jumbling it comes out in a more selective and often more specific form (not always).  Maybe the Ni user has a bit of a deeper understanding of the path the person will take to become a programmer, and realise that the person actually exhibits plenty of other prerequisite qualities to get this person there (which falls under the scope of op's question). I mean even saying someone could be a great programmer is vague if when you're hiring then you didn't spot the other possibilities that Ni has tied together, and as such you can spot a likely chain of events where this person is doomed to fail in the workplace. Ne will spot more possibilities sure, but they won't be as detailed and thorough. This is often attributed to Ne doms; being flighty and not following through with ideas. Ni doms are known for more formulated ideas at the cost of breadth. Saying also that Ni can be super specific isn't entirely accurate either, in the same vein as what I've stated.  So ultimately saying Ne is the best function for seeing possibilities neglects a breadth vs depth aspect. Noam Chomsky is pretty damn specific with his interpretation of events.  Also Ne users often do use it for fun (typically in secondary and tertiary). You don't. So why are you convolving the two? That's your preference. The only understanding that I can achieve here is from your own experience, which is largely coming in the form for allegory and not reasoning save for the Ne Dom case. Nevertheless I agree with the cases you've stated and consider them an accurate depiction of how Ne might be used. What I'm not seeing is the understanding that the Ne Dom often will say ""this person could be this this this this..."" generating lots of possibilities that are grounded by their own storehouse of knowledge Si (however I took this as implicit in what you said). This can be clearly seen in all the Ne users I know. Not that allegory adds weight to this.   Ne is not a particularly concrete thing, as you seem to make it out to be. Your conception of it seems to be that Ne serves only to bring into light an Si specific, thus the concreteness. Again this is your preference. However, Ne will bring up Si fact based possibilities so I wouldn't disagree there. Ne can often be vague; rather more raw than you seem to think. Ne has lots of other functions asides from possibility generation which just aren't obvious. It's intuition. It is still intuition, and liable to be just as vague as Ni because they're two sides of the same coin. They'll be vague and specific in differing respects. As Ne is vague in one way, Ni is vague in another.  I don't know how clear this was, and I do not mean to be mean spirited, neither did I mean to argue or 'win' an argument. However, the point I was getting across is that your conception of Ni seems to me to be lacking. I don't know why this is but it's likely the mystic shit that gets slung around and you have nothing else to work with. My point is that Ni is just as easily understandable as Ne because they're just a matter of how intuition is processed."
mbti,3cm6c5,MrJudzey,-1,Sat Jul 11 09:43:23 2015 UTC,"Holy shit dude, that is so much text. My understanding of Ni isn't lacking. The idea that Ne sees potential in people and situations comes straight from the socionics definition. I don't need to defend myself here or go th through every bit of your text. This stuff is textbook."
mbti,3cm6c5,WhatINeverSaid,2,Sat Jul 11 11:40:21 2015 UTC,"My apologies.  Could you describe your formulation of Ni to me if you have the time?  The Ne socionics definitions I'm familiar with, but it's always entangled with social dynamics, which lacks the individual cognitive touch. You seem to have a good grasp of Ne. This is largely because Ne renders Si and vice versa. This is not book knowledge, this is your own understanding. So I'd like to pick your brains as regards Ni, rather than read definitions.   These definitions also can be confused and muddled on occasion. I usually find it better to trust my own insight. I guess that's Ni use.  I detailed arguments, where judging by your text, your understanding of Ni may be lacking. Obviously I don't have a lot to go on, so I apologise."
mbti,3cm6c5,MrJudzey,2,Sat Jul 11 12:15:26 2015 UTC,"I was talking a bit about this yesterday, but here is Ni at its core:  Jung said that the brain arbitrarily divides reality into an abstract/concrete dichotomy. Sx functions work with the concrete world and Nx functions work with the abstract world. Xe functions focus on perception and navigation and Xi functions focus on interpretation and reflection.   Ni works to gain understanding of and give meaning to the abstract world. It's connection is through impressions, rather than literally seeing possibilities like Ne. Ni is consumed, in an almost visceral way, with the abstract. Just like an Si user might become fixated on a messy room, an Ni user might become fixated on the glory of battle. Just like an Si user might be overwhelmed by the beauty of a painting, an Ni user might be overwhelmed with their insight into another person's perspective."
mbti,3cm6c5,WhatINeverSaid,3,Sat Jul 11 12:28:42 2015 UTC,"Ok that's a workable description.   My previous text was too long to take seriously. But I argued that Ne gives breadth to a set of possibilities, whilst Ni gives depth. I agree wholeheartedly in saying that Pi functions are impressionistic.  However, I didn't agree that Ni make people feel it in their bones. An INTJ certainly does not operate like this. Even I don't, being a wishy washy INFJ. Carl Jung (INFJ) didn't just feel it, he provided rigorous analysis based off his insights into people. So whilst Ne can see various potential possibilities in people, Ni is likely to look into the core of people, consequently coming up with ideas for how people work, similar to Jung.   Freud on Celebtypes is typed as ISTJ. He had such an in-depth analysis of people and unconscious thought, primarily using Si. Though clearly he is working more concretely.    So to fine tune your original point, the breadth of how Ne sees lots of different potentials is much larger and better than Ni. So it's a breadth and depth issue. That's not to say that Ni is crap and vague at seeing potential and looking straight into the heart of people. Similarly with Se and Si but for factual analysis.  In fact you seem to be viewing Ni through the lens of Si, because Si is impressionistic. This is not quite accurate for Ni. It's internalised intuition, so a storehouse of abstraction and ideas. This gets played around with and comes out in a different form, so is good for seeing a likely chain of events, instead of a variety of different possible events. It's like how Si is an internalised storehouse of facts and impressions, both based off of sense data, which comes out differently than raw Se.   At least this is my understanding of it.  The Ni example you gave here of glory, seems to be repressed or tertiary in it's role. The second example you gave is a good example of dominant or secondary.   Tl;dr Ne: ""You have potential to do this, or this, or this, or be this...""; Ni: ""I see your potential going down this path"""
mbti,3cm6c5,MrJudzey,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:11:21 2015 UTC,If Ni sees depth and Ne sees breadth then why was Freud laser focused and stubborn on a handful of abstract ideas while Jung was trying his hand in dozens of abstract topics and open to interpretations outside of his own?
mbti,3cm6c5,WhatINeverSaid,2,Sat Jul 11 14:21:56 2015 UTC,"Well Freud did have repressed Ne. You can still see it in his defence mechanisms, all arising from different phenomena. Jung's thought had just about everything arising from the same phenomena (the same central idea (Plato's [actually Heraclitus] opposites arising out of one another, and the theory of forms; both contributed to his archetypes and typology, both are a stored framework of internal ideas).  Jung dabbled in lots of topics but that does not necessarily indicate Ne. He did not generate lots of different ideas. One can see that he absorbed the logic (Ti) and ideas (Ni) from what he dabbled in, and used them to advance his own understanding (again Ni). He did not for instance, spend time advancing those fields (Ne or Te, performing innovation and work on the fields; extroverting thought and ideas onto those fields).  Of course he was open to interpretations, Ni needs to drink them in and internalise them.  The difference between Freud and Jung is immediately multifaceted because Freud is not a Ne dom so it is difficult to draw that comparison. Also the laser focus looks like Si/Te. Compare this to Ni/Te in Newton, where he dabbles in mathematics to advance the depth of his own physics, advancing mathematics only by accident. That is a much less convoluted comparison. So he drank in the ideas from lots of different sources to output his own idea(s). These ideas are typically very few.  For a better comparison an ENTP will suffice: lots of different ideas, that Ti then evaluates. Contrast with INTJ with very few ideas that Te pushes for efficacy.  You're an ISFJ so presumably you internalise lots of facts and impressions. You'll also check these with your own framework of logic, as exhibited in your question, but you need to build that framework first by internalising logic from lots of sources.

Ne would search many possibilities, but not conclude them definitively. Ne postulates what someone's personality might be, but does not like to say 'this is their personality'."

mbti,3clmin,MinatoCauthon,4,Wed Jul 8 23:52:08 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it, there's a lot of info to take in, but the next step you're about to take will give a lot of depth and clarity to the system.  First things first, those letters are a code that tell you the function order (there is a guide in the sidebar that helps you breakdown the code). Each person has a preference for four functions, two of which are the judging functions (thinking and feeling) and the other two are the perceiving functions (sensing and intuiting). Additionally, each one of these four functions has a preference for introversion or extraversion, making 8 total functions:  Extraverted Intuition (Ne), Introverted Intuition (Ni), Extraverted Sensing (Se), Introverted Sensing (Si), Extraverted Thinking (Te), Introverted Thinking (Ti), Extraverted Feeling (Fe), and Introverted Feeling (Fi).  I'll give you an example. ENTPs preferred functions are Ne Ti Fe Si. The preference pairs would be the pair of judging functions (Ti + Fe) and the pair of perceiving functions (Ne + Si). How this works is that opposite functions are paired with each other. Ne and Si are opposites in the perceiving category, while Ti and Fe are opposites in the judging category.  Most of the tests online basically test you for E vs I and P vs J, which isn't very accurate. The best way to determine your type is to learn what these 8 functions have to offer. This chart is very handy and I used it to memorize the placements of all the functions in the different types, its also very easy to refer to. What I recommend for you is to spend some time researching the individual functions. Search past posts in this sub and the other mbti subreddits as many great questions have been asked and many great examples have been given. It took me a while to fully wrap my head around all of this, taking information from sources all over the internet to get a clear idea of what it all really means.  Here is a Youtube playlist that will explain the differences between the functions in terms of comparing each to their introverted or extraverted counterpart (ex. Fe vs Fi), but I warn you: while he is very informative, the guy's voice is incredibly boring.  Good luck with typing yourself and learning about others, remember to take it slow and keep an open mind!"

mbti,3clmin,Komatik,3,Thu Jul 9 00:24:38 2015 UTC,"Yup. There are two ""types"" (haha) of MBTI online. There are the ones you find on popular websites that give you a quiz and type you based on your social Introversion/Extroversion, your tendency towards ideas vs. your surroundings, your favouritism of cold logic or warm emotion, and your organization. This is a very superficial (and frankly inaccurate) representation of the flavour of MBTI that is used by those with a deeper understanding.   You see, there are too many superfical factors when it comes to saying ""I am an organized and rigorous person"" vs. ""I am a disorganized, open-minded person"" (J vs. P), since pretty much everyone is a mixture of both. Also, it's very likely that people will relate heavily to several types, if their ""preference"" isn't very strong.   For this reason, the more developed MBTI uses ""cognitive functions"" to help everyone have their type determined accurately and decisively. In this system, I'm an ENTP because of how I think, and NOT how I act (as would be the case in the other flavour of MBTI). How I act is too situational, but how I think, and process information, follows a recognisable pattern.   So, about these functions...  Instead of [I/E, N/S, T/F, J/P] we use 8 cognitive functions. These are based on the different ways we can take in information (Sensing and iNtuition), and the ways we can process this information (Feeling and Thinking). Each of these are either introverted functions (focused on forming ideals unique to the individual, which can then be shared with the world), or extroverted functions (focused on taking ideas from the external world, and shaping the individual's inner world). So, the functions are:    Perceiving Functions - See the ideas and concepts as they are, in raw form. Used for making new information.   Ne - Extroverted Intuition [] Deals with seeking new possibilities in the external world and making connections between concepts.   Se - Extroverted Sensing [] Deals with obtaining a large amount of sensory information from the surroundings, and forming a detailed snapshot of the surroundings.   Ni - Introverted Intuition [] This is what most of us would call ""Intuition""... It subconsciously processes information from the outside world, and gives the person a ""gut feeling"" about how something is or will be.   Si - Introverted Sensing [] Forms a detailed record of the past experiences of the person, which influence their opinions in the present.     Judging Functions - Try to process the information gained from the perceiving functions to make sense of them. Introverted Judging functions want to change the world around them to match up with their ideas, while Extroverted Judging functions want to form a union of the external world with their own inner ideas, and are more likely to have the individual embrace the opinions of others.   Te - Extroverted Thinking [] Asserts objective logic on others, mostly in the form of facts. ""Face the facts: You're wrong!""  Ti - Introverted Intuition [] Tries to form an internal logical system which encompasses all of their knowledge into systems. Tends to go for a more long-winded approach in arguments, explaining every step in the logic.   Fe - Extroverted Feeling [] Empathetic to other's feelings, and often very open in accepting other people's opinions, since the individual often doesn't know what they want... They just want everyone to get along. Tend to be very open about their feelings.   Fi - Introverted Feeling [] Sympathetic to other's feelings, but holds true to a personal value system. ""I like this"" and ""I don't like this"" tend to be far easier for a Fi-user to determine than an Fe-user.     Now to give you a case-study: Me. I've looked deeply into my functions, and understand how they work and how I use them, so I'll demonstrate.   I'm an ENTP SEE THIS DIAGRAM. From the ""E"" and ""P"" you can determine that I lead with an Extroverted function, and it's a Perceiving function. Since I'm an iNtuitive, that would be Extroverted iNtuition. This is my ""Dominant Function""... The one that comes the most naturally to me.   After every Extroverted Percieving function, we have the opposite: an Introverted Judging function... Since I'm an EN""T""P, that would make it Introverted Thinking. This is my ""Auxiliary Function""... The one which supports my dominant one by processing the information gained. Ne+Ti work by having a bunch of creative ideas (Ne), and organizing the ones which hold up to a logical inspection into a wide net of concepts, attached by logic.   Next, I have the counterpart to Introverted Thinking... Extroverted Feeling. This is my ""Teritary Function"", which means I use it a little less naturally than my Auxiliary. Fe makes me blend in with others, and obey social rules. Since it's weaker than my Ne+Ti though, if the boss decides that a rule is worth bending, Ne+Ti will take priority over Fe. So, if I decide that a rule makes no logical sense, and is too tedious to follow... I may seek an opportunity to bend it.   My fourth function is my weakest conscious function, and is the counterpart to Extroverted Intuition... ""Introverted Sensing"". It's pretty weak, which means that it takes some effort to use effectively, and I'm not a natural at using it at all. It also does a sloppy job. My memory of names, events, and even my reaction to different things often lets me down, and gets me into all sorts of awkward situations.   If you want to find your type the right way, look at the 8 functions... There are many good websites online, and I'd recommend www.celebritytypes.com for starters.   If you have any further questions or comments, I'd be glad to help. Wishing you luck in finding your type. After you understand the functions, it's only a matter of time. It took me 7 months, but that was mostly because I couldn't get my head around the concepts properly, and I didn't understand aspects of myself. If this is the case for you, you should write about it to someone like me... It's surprising how much writing about yourself makes you begin to understand yourself a lot better than just thinking about it in your head (at least for me, anyway)."

mbti,3cj7kx,Pytak,2,Wed Jul 8 15:13:57 2015 UTC,"ISTJ seems very plausible too. I never considered it until I saw its cognitive functions. They're pretty in line with my prominent ones as seen by the results.   Weird, my mom's an ISTJ too. I guess my dad was right when he said that I'm a spitting image of my mother."
mbti,3cj7kx,CritSrc,2,Wed Jul 8 19:40:50 2015 UTC,"ISTJ descriptions are usually awful, but your perseverance and hard strategic thinking will get you through life no matter what. My ISTJ dad has made my family as comfortable as can be with a rather mediocre salary. He plans ahead with what has worked, he always secures his surefire opportunities. ISTJs over prepare for the future, but that's better IMO to the underprepared INTJs dashing to seize it before realizing there is no ground to walk on."
mbti,3cj7kx,CritSrc,4,Wed Jul 8 19:54:10 2015 UTC,"My perseverance is pretty sporadic; unlike the typical J type I'm not consistently determined, hardworking or organized. I pretty much do whatever I'm interested in and I'll randomly devote uncanningly amounts of time and effort into something that really captures my interests.  I think I'm more of a P type. I have a model INTJ father and ISTJ mother who've stressed organization, future planning and hardowrk throughout my upbringing, so J qualities are deep-rooted in me. But I truly like taking these as they go and dealing with it accordingly rather than trudging through all that prep work.

mbti,3cj7kx,CritSrc,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:08:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the reason I asked was because socionics and MBTI have a funky mapping scheme. An INTj in socionics would be more similar to an INTP in MBTI and, similarly, an ISTp would be more similar to an ISTJ.   I think I agree with the other person for ISTJ. ISFP is still possible but I think that you're an introverted perceiver which makes ISTJ the better fit."
mbti,3cj7kx,forfourwon,2,Wed Jul 8 22:07:59 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't ISFP or some other P type be correct if you think I'm an introverted perceiver (which I believe so as well)? ISTJ is a judging type  Thinking about it more, I think I'm really on the fence between J/P. I think I'm naturally a perceiving type but because of the J-like upbringing I had (or rather, still have), those qualities are engraved in me."
mbti,3cj7kx,CritSrc,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:19:56 2015 UTC,"ISTJs are perceivers in the sense that their strongest function is  Introverted Sensing, a perceiving one. ISFPs are dominant judgers since their strongest function is Introverted Feeling, a judging one. The P/J in MBTI refers to whether you extrovert or ""show"" your judging or perceiving. For extroverts, it's straightforward, but with introverts, their strongest function is hidden to people on the outside.   To write all that out: ExxJ's strongest functions are Judging and that's what they show. ExxP's strongest functions are Perceiving and that's what they show. IxxJ's strongest functions are Perceiving but they buffer it and show Judging. IxxP's strongest functions are Judging but they buffer it and show Perceiving.     If your nature is primarily perceiving, that suggests that you are either an IxxJ or and ExxP but from your OP and response to my question, you sound like an introvert."
mbti,3cj7kx,INTP_Thoughts,2,Wed Jul 8 22:53:04 2015 UTC,Makes sense. I can see how those functions are judging/perceiving. And I'm most definitely an introvert; no questions about that.   What are the best ISTJ descriptions?
mbti,3cl2qd,MameTozhio,3,Wed Jul 8 19:14:26 2015 UTC,"Function tests are imprecise because the stacks they generally present simply cannot work in reality. Based on this, I'd say you're an INTP. Ti-Ne-Si-Fe are in order there, whereas an ISTP would be Ti-Se-Ni-Fe, and you've got Ni and Se in reverse order.  Some would disagree with me, but it is my personal belief that we all use every function, and that our stack simply dictates which functions we tend to prefer. Therefore, it makes perfect sense that your results from a function test would be so jumbled, but you'll notice that, like I said, the INTP functions fall perfectly in line."
mbti,3cl2qd,joethulhuz,2,Wed Jul 8 19:22:23 2015 UTC,"An ISTP would rarely test as an INFP. I think you are an INTP as a result. Also ISTP's rarely care about personality theory. Besides, you said you think you're an INTP and that carries a lot of weight."

If you are trying to figure out if you are an INTP or INFP, look at Ti and Fi. If you are new to this, I'd recommend looking at personalityjunkie.com for this.

Plus, the front page shows us that reposts can be just as popular or moreso than the original posting.  I think this would tie in better to socionics, but MBTI is a larger community and it's still relevant. Socionics, when I've read about it, has made generalizations about how how each type's body is, like how they carry themselves and what they look like. I feel like this article could maybe slightly back it up, if awareness of body signals really does play into cognition. There's also this line in the arcticle:   James’ ideas also raised an important question: if everybody has different bodily awareness, would that shape the emotions they experience?"

Your post sounds like you just saw God. Type is not revelation. To quote, Buddhist scholar D.T.

I ask about INFJ over INTJ because the question is ""which type are the most likely to feel alienated"" and not be alienated. Furthermore, when we look at the functions, the INFJ's Fe seeks social acceptance much more than its INTJ's Te counterpart."

They are more likely to seek social acceptance, but they're much more likely to receive it as well. They're more sensitive (which isn't always a good thing), but makes them easier for a lot of people to understand.  The INTJs that I've met unwillingly choose solitude because they have very high standards for those around them. I think that they do desire to be understood, but rarely is this wish granted. It's easier to say ""No, I don't have emotions, I don't care,"" than it is to admit how lonely the world can be.  My little brother is an INTJ. I watched him go from not having a lot of friends and certainly none like him, to him going to a S.T.E.M. school and having a lot of friends just like him. He's so much happier. It turns out he didn't need social acceptance so much as intellectual equals. But before he got that? He was visibly separated from a world that didn't have a place for the blunt and awkward.  That's why I say INTJ."
mbti,3ch7td,Anrikay,3,Tue Jul 7 23:54:06 2015 UTC,"I think INTJ skills and intelligence are definitely more valued after high school for sure.  I vote INFP... I feel like many INTJs really really thrive in high-paying STEM careers and their skills that get them there are highly valued. it's often an easy fit.   I don't think dom-Fi ever gets exalted in quite that way. I suppose you could say the arts is maybe a stereotypical field where Fi tends to be really appreciated, but I feel like there are more INTJs in STEM than there are successful artist INFPs, you know?  And while Fi technically isn't about sensitivity, it seems more than likely that it's linked, as i'm sure anyone who's been close to an INFP can attest."
mbti,3ch7td,bezald,4,Wed Jul 8 00:26:37 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing my point. The INTJ thinks, or convinces himself, that all he needs is a rewarding job in a field he's interested in. He neglects the fact that he does need social fulfillment. His social connections come from intellectual equality however, rather than from emotional connection. That intellectual equality is very hard to find, because even though he may find intelligent people, he needs people who fundamentally understand his thoughts (ENTPs or fellow INTJs seem best at this). It's hard to find a group like that, even in S.T.E.M. fields.  The INFJ or INFP is able to connect emotionally. They're more sensitive. They know what to say to make someone feel better. This makes them more likeable.   I have both INFJ and INFP friends. The INFJ does art on the side and is studying marine biology. The INFP is a psychology major. They both found ways to use their sensitive side to their advantage in the careers they hope to go into, despite not being in art. I think it's just about finding the right fit. Not easy, but possible."
mbti,3ch7td,Anrikay,2,Wed Jul 8 00:51:19 2015 UTC,"deleted my comment because i've decided it's more enneagram 4w5s (many/most of whom are INFPs) that tend to feel most alienated than INFP in general.  that said though, there are definitely INTJs that are 'likeable' and emotionally developed for sure! i mean, i don't think you'd see such a huge, astronomical number of ENFP-INTJ (or INFJ-INTJ!) marriages otherwise.  from what i've found, INTJs are less likely to care whether or not people have accepted them. the less developed INTJs are even likely to be like 'who cares, i'm smarter than you!' and move on, as a poster above seems to suggest."

Especially the intuitives because they actually perceive the idea of a ""social group"" (over perceiving the concrete of what's actually going on, like 'shit I'm left out of the group, but I can just go play with my yo-yo')   If by ""most vulnerable"" you mean ""most hurt by,"" it is no doubt ENTPs and ESTPs. Their Fe is in the third (puerile/child) position. You'll find that many EXTPs will get highly anxious if they ever feel like they are on the outside of a social group.

mbti,3ch7td,Lynac,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:00:16 2015 UTC,"As an ISTJ I'm tempted to say ""my type!"" It's not, however, because people have tendency to think themselves more unique than they are.  ""Which types are the most vulnerable to feeling alienated from social groups?"" Extroverts have more interest in social groups making them likely to care enough to feel alienated from them.  That leaves 6 types.  Dom. Fe users (EXFJs) are most in tune with other's feelings/adapt to them well, making them likely to feel connected with an annoying social situation instead of alienated.  Dom Te users (EXTJs) may not be in tune with those they are around, but their priorities of progress and social status/success lead them to plug into a place they fit well without feeling ""alienated"".   Dom Se users (ESXPs) are focused on their environment so much that social connects often happen naturally and they rarely stop long enough to feel alienated.  That leaves ENTPs & ENFPs; dom Ne is brilliant but doesn't help directly build relationships.  They're eccentric and few, leaving them to feel alienated from social groups.   Just a hypothesis.  Forgive me for making generalizations. Types can feels alienated for different reasons, we cannot objectively decide who feels it most; each of us have been exposed to different environments causing same types to not have the same experience with feelings of acceptance, which is itself a delicate topic."

I had some pretty fucking lonely depressing times freshman and sophomore year in college, as I was 2000 miles away from home and everyone I knew.

Slower processing speed, basically the more time you have, the better, it can almost endlessly keep tuning the solution. You give up a function slot compared to Ni though.  I don't have Ni, so I don't have access to the first person experience of it. I wonder if it's done after delivering the vision, or does if it also keeps improving the offered solution. Perhaps it does, but the accompanying judging function (Te/Fe) tends to want to go to action quickly."

The ITJ personality is also typically driven to see that things are done properly. Asking you to make your bed is thus largely a request to give the house a pleasant aesthetic.  On the cleaning front, ISTJs should be receptive to arguments of efficiency and effectiveness - don't tell him that it's useless, he probably sees value in a thorough cleaning (again, they commonly desire to do things properly), but cleaning every nook and cranny every day is hardly necessary, no? Once a week probably keeps the place exceptionally tidy with little in the way of unnecessary effort.  On the last one, they only trust what they've seen with their own eyes.

An INTJ being callous to the ones they love, an INTP forgetting to check their shirt was on the right way round, an ENTJ for being overbearing. These are stereotypes of misjudgements and character flaws. They may not be correct, but they serve as an illustration."

Intuitives and Sensors have an equal probability of being ""intelligent"", and both can do great things for the world. Intuitive bias is rather rampant. I speculate this is because intuitives are the minority IRL, and many feel out of place. So, they come here and arrogantly tout their virtues, whilst pointing out the follies of sensors to make themselves feel slightly better. Sensors are just as useful as intuitives in society.

What do I mean?  Unfortunately, there are no rules governing the difference between an extroverted function and its equivalent introverted version. I have found that there are broad-sweeping statements you can make and be mostly right, for instance, I like to think of the difference between introverted and extroverted judging functions is that Ti and Fi like to give each situation a unique consideration, where Te and Fe like to give each situation the same basic consideration.  (forgive my confusing wording)  To directly answer your question, here my understanding of the differences between the perception functions in a simple visual form.  The black dots are real data, the purple is perception of past real data, the blue dot indicates right now, the red indicates predicted data, and the pink indicates unsurety about predicted data.  I think it is very explanatory, but let me give you an example anyway:    An Si user named Sid and an Se user named Selena go to an amusement park.  They look at the crowd every day, three times a day, at the exact same times and location. (these form the black dots preceding the blue dot, which is current time, in my diagrams)  Both Sid and Selena see the past crowd levels at those exact times as truth.  This is the information that they perceive.  However, when asked to predict future crowds in the amusement park, Sid and Selena differ.  Sid predicts that at those exact times, the crowd levels will be exactly as they were before.  Selena, in contrast, predicts a possible range of levels that she has seen before, but doesn't make a solid conclusion about the trend until a huge amount of data support her conclusion.  A Ni user named Nick and a Ne user named Ned go to the same amusement park, and look at the crowd in the same fashion, day after day.  Both Nick and Ned see the past fluctuating trend of people in the park as true data, with specific levels of crowd as ""proof"", or an indication of the trend.  (The clear difference between N and S is this difference: the truth being a trend, or specific instances.) However, when asked to predict future crowds in the amusement park, Nick and Ned differ.  Nick predicts the trend of crowd levels will continue as they have been.  Ned predicts the trend will continue, but doesn't come to a specific conclusion, much like Se.  This is just my understanding, however.  PS: forgive the horrible image hosting website. Imgur is giving me trouble"
mbti,3cccny,oreus4924,4,Mon Jul 6 22:08:31 2015 UTC,"To be a bit more accurate, the functions come in four pairs of opposites: You have Te/Fi or Ti/Fe and Se/Ni or Si/Ne.

mbti,3cccny,Komatik,9,Mon Jul 6 22:06:36 2015 UTC,"Your dominant function is the one that primarily defines you. People are typically just dripping in their dominant function. I'll talk about the perceiving functions because they are the easiest to differentiate.  Se is obviously the easiest to understand. Se is about navigating and perceiving the concrete world. Are you walking right now? Se. Are you shooting aliens in a video game? Se.  Ne is about navigating and perceiving the abstract world. What does that mean? Let's do two examples:  Ne users are typically much ""better"" with money than Se/Ni users. For SJs, who have Ne in the tertiary or inferior position, Ne is typically used from a place of negativity. This means that Ne (which is navigating and perceiving the abstract world, money being a relatively abstract idea) is going out of its way to worry, to save money, to cut coupons. For NPs, who have Ne in the dominant or auxiliary position, Ne is typically used from a place of positivity. This means that Ne is understanding the user's financial position, and spending money in the most effective way. That doesn't mean that NPs aren't going to make ""bad"" purchasing decisions from a logical perspective (they might spend $200 during a Steam Sale, for example), but that NPs are probably the types least like to regret a purchasing decision. They had a full understanding of what they were buying, why they were buying it, and whether or not they had to power to purchase it.  When working on a project Ne users are all about exploring ideas until they find the right answers. For SJs that might mean a lot of listing negative or bad possibilities (you know those people who typically just list five reasons why you shouldin't do something? Probably SJs), for NPs that might mean coming up with the three best opportunities and trying them out.  Stereotype: Ne is the function of day dreams. Specifically the kind that take place where you are. ENTP friend reports planning bank robberies whenever they visit the bank. INFP frequently has violent fantasies about hurting coworkers.  Si is another function about the concrete world, but it is focusing the world through a subjective lens. This usually manifests itself as the Si-user focusing on how they are affected by their surroundings.  Examples:  ""Every time I eat wheat my stomach hurts.""  ""Wow, I can't get over how pretty that flower is!""  ""I have to clean this room, the fact that it is so messy is bothering me!""  ""This person once betrayed me, now I have a hard time even looking at them.""  The difference between Se and Si is the same difference between Ne and Ni. Ni is about focusing the abstract world through a subjective lens, meaning that NJs are primarily affected by possibilities and abstract concepts.  You'll hear a lot of bullshit about Ni, created by a mass hallucination after years and years of NJs being called out as ""special."" People will talk about ""just knowing"" and ""visions"" and all sorts of garbage. However, the best example of Ni I've ever seen comes straight out of Breaking Bad. You're probably familiar but if not, it is a TV show staring a character named Walter White, an INTJ.  I'll try to avoid spoilers, but basically White's story is a sort of ""road to hell"" deal. He is constantly doing worse and worse things throughout the series, and during one episode he talked about what has driven him to continue his life of crime.  When he was in college he started a company with his best friend, but due to personal conflict Walter ended up selling his share in the company for $5000. That company would later be worth two billion dollars.  And that is it. That's what motivated him to continue doing crime after he started (the initial motivation was a bit different). He saw an abstract possibility; a universe where he didn't leave the company and became a billionaire. And that possibility is what pushed him forward, doing terrible things, for the entire series.  That's Ni in a nutshell, that possibility had such a strong affect on him that he stole and murdered just to catch of glimpse of that reality in the concrete world (through his Se)."
mbti,3cccny,WhatINeverSaid,5,Tue Jul 7 00:17:59 2015 UTC,"While I don't disagree with your particular example of Ni (particularly maladaptive Ni), I think it misses out on some of the other aspects of Ni. I see Ni as pattern-and-mold-recognizing, where it views abstract symbols through a filter that discerns trends and patterns. It's detached from the real world (unlike Si, which is rooted in a lens of direct experience) and it can distort present information through Se by using a premade filter.   In this way, Ni synthesizes the information collected by Se and puts forth an understanding of few, singular and all-encompassing ideas. It's more restrictive than Ne, which is often freeform. I think this is the premise behind Ni-users talking about having a ""vision"" or ""idea"" for the future and that's due to its very subjective and singular nature."
mbti,3cccny,horyo,-4,Tue Jul 7 05:57:47 2015 UTC,"Don't you see how messy this is? Like, your definition doesn't really make sense. If I'm looking at people and looking for ""pattern-and-mold-recognizing"" or ""viewing abstract symbols through a filter that discerns trends and patters"" I'm not going to find anyone because what you're describing isn't the human experience. Humans want to have sex with that chick in their psych class and they love Selena Gomez. Humans hate broccoli and have a dentist appointment next week. Humans wrote bad Pokemon fanfiction when they were a kid and wish that they could live in Neuromancer. Humans have a 9-to-5 job and they sing karaoke with their coworkers at the bar down the street.  Writing a bunch of empty words doesn't help people understand themselves better, and it definitely doesn't help people type themselves or others better."
mbti,3cccny,WhatINeverSaid,7,Tue Jul 7 12:35:18 2015 UTC,For me Ni is always trying to look at things from the bigger picture. I constantly connect all the existing ideas in my head. I simplify ideas to their core because I don't like unnecessary details.  I have only a few main interests in life and I constantly push to achieve my goals which revolve around those interests. I have a habit of only taking in information that's relevant to my ideas and goals. Does this sound like an accurate description to you or is it also nonsensical?
mbti,3cccny,spacephase101,3,Tue Jul 7 16:54:12 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a more plain text way to describe Ni. However, I wouldn't say that excluding information that isn't relevant is a necessary feature, I think. Ni is known for being able to shift perspectives, which if done well would leave little that can't be relevant, in my opinion.   Connecting ideas that appear disparate like that may be more strongly in the realm of Ne though. I'd like to hear input from anyone with more to add about that."
mbti,3cccny,_mildude,3,Wed Jul 8 00:08:39 2015 UTC,"You're right, I tried to describe Ni as basically as possible since the longer and more personal explanations seem to be ""empty words"" to WhatINeverSaid. I figured a more concrete and less abstract explanation might help.   Once again, you're right. Ni is great with shifting perspectives. I should've been more clear though. For INFJs and INTJs, Ni has a habit of of picking out all the information it decides it doesn't need using Se as a filter. It doesn't mean we block out all other information all the time. It's just a lot less likely that we'll remember it since it doesn't revolve around our general interests. Eh, actually, I'm not gonna assert that as fact because now I'm talking from personal experience. Anyways, you're right about the Ne thing too. Ne connects all sorts of dots that can seemingly have nothing to do with each other. Ni singles out specific dots that all connect to one big dot (idea/goal.) That's in a nutshell what I remember reading anyway. Intuition is weird."
mbti,3cccny,spacephase101,2,Wed Jul 8 00:38:00 2015 UTC,"I tried to describe Ni as basically as possible since the longer and more personal explanations seem to be ""empty words"" to WhatINeverSaid.   I don't have a problem with personal explanations in theory, but when people describe functions using their personal experiences it is 95% no good. Even SPs describing Se doesn't usually make sense. The functions and functional definitions are abstractions of what is going on in our heads; we use functional definitions because the stuff going on in our mind is too confusing (otherwise we wouldn't even have to define cognitive functions).   Ni is great with shifting perspectives.   Totally, that is one of the best things you'll see with Ni. Dan Carlin (pretty sure he's ISTP) does a great description of it in one of his history podcasts. I wish I could cite which one, but he talks about how every once in a while, while studying history, he will flash into the perspective of different players in history. Another example, on a random MBTI channel, that I actually think is a perfect example of Ni use.  Ne and Ni are both good at looking at things from a different perspective, but because Ni isn't limited by objectivity, the Ni user can gain impressions from their projections of what other people are thinking/feeling. INFPs and INFJs are both known for reading people, but it is very different. INFPs are more analytical, Fi and Ne working together to break down a person's possible motivations and feelings. INFJs view a person's behavior (Se) and form an impression with Ni. The impression comes from years of unconsciously observing behavior (Si works in the same way). That impression is then analyzed with Fe, which mainly decides whether the INFJ should act on their impression or not."

mbti,3cccny,_mildude,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:58:03 2015 UTC,"/u/_mildude had some good insight. Let me break down your paragraph:   trying to look at things from the bigger picture   This could be Ni or Ne; Ne is more active at examining the bigger picture, Ni is more passive.   I constantly connect all the existing ideas in my head.   Personally this is a bit more indicative of Ti/Ne, at least to me. Ni/Te is more focused on the ideas in the head being used to affect the outside world.   I simplify ideas to their core because I don't like unnecessary details.   This also reminds me a bit of Ti/Ne. I was talking with /u/CritSrc and /u/Person4645 about how IPs and EJs are more likely to avoid data for the sake of ideas, while IJs and EPs are more likely to dive into new situations without proper judgement. We didn't come up with anything 100% definitive though.   I have only a few main interests in life and I constantly push to achieve my goals which revolve around those interests.   Remember that your goals are actually coming from both your judging and perceiving functions; you might say that Perception gives you the motivation and Judgement gives you the how and what. What you are saying does sound like XXTJ; having a low extroverted perceiving function usually leads to having less interests (because you don't always have the energy to seek new things).   I have a habit of only taking in information that's relevant to my ideas and goals.    Same thoughts with at discussion, on IP/EJ and IF/EP.  So, if someone asked me to type them based on just your paragraph, I'd say they were an ESTJ. Dominant judging, with a low Pe function. Enough Ne to be really good at connecting ideas.  That doesn't mean you are and ESTJ; there isn't anything that ""excludes"" INTJ.  If you could write me a three separate three sentence stream of consciousnesses on what you think of when I say, ""Music,"" ""Career,"" and ""2056,"" I'd be able to say with more confidence, show you where your Ni is or where it isn't."

I always resented not being put in the highest math in sixth grade, but I also realize that: first and less relevantly, my standardized testing strengths in general lie in verbal reasoning more than math; and second, I had a very bad problem of making tons of careless mistakes stemming from not looking at what i was writing. And just in general, I can do stupid things sometimes because I don't have the proper environment to do good Ni or it's not appropriate to do so in the first place.   looking at the words ""Music,"" ""Career,"" and ""2056"" were like looking through tunnels into worlds of associations and it made my heart jump.

It makes sense to me to be able to pick up on things. MBT is about data processing and filtering, not motivation. I think you're presuming a little too much about Ni, particularly because it doesn't seem to be one of your functions.   I'm also not sure why you describe it as not a human experience, because it's something I experience often. But again, MBT isn't an explanation for human motivation, as you seem to be convinced it is and have outlined many facets of. Everything you've outlined regards the experiences you've observed in other people (or maybe yourself) but is not indicative of Ni. It's a very Si-feature. I don't blame you for misunderstanding Ni, as it's very difficult to see from another point of view, especially by someone whose functional stack doesn't contain it at all.  You also mentioned to another commenter that they retrofitted their worldview to fit Ni. I don't agree. When I discovered the cognitive functions, it gave a context to the way I saw things that made sense to me. I didn't ""retrofit"" my worldview to fit my MBT.

That is Ni.  Smaller and have few defenses fall in line with that idea. I know I'm going to die if I don't do something is not Te. Te is I need to do something. Ni is the ""I know I'm going to die.""  Still the 25m away part is Se, which for some reason you've labeled as Nx.  I should run is an Ni feature. That is not Se. Se is ""RUN!!"" Note the differences between how I phrased it. Each of these functions work in duality, and Ni predominantly suggests that I should do something, however there are caveats to each action. Se is ""do it immediately!""  I'm going to die is both Ni and Se coming together.   Additionally, the fact that you pointed out Se so many times suggests that it's still a filter I use moreso than anything else in a stressful situation.  Edit: By the way, since you seem so vehemently attached to your misconstrued idea of Ni, I welcome you to discuss it at the /r/intj subreddit or /r/infj subreddit if you were interested in seeing NJ responses beyond mine, since you don't seem to be interested in my responses."

mbti,3cccny,WhatINeverSaid,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:58:53 2015 UTC,"Sure I missed the 25m part and which response was correlated to it, but it doesn't change the overall approach I examined and explained in my post. Your interpretation of Ni in this case is still wrong, and you're doing your best to try to find an alternative to what I know as Ni just to support your argument rather than respond to my points directly. Maybe I should break it down and revise your post so it makes more sense to you, because you're clearly not comprehending this.   There's a tiger running at me! Se, stressed, dominant function doesn't work.  Shit. Si Ni, because I know what's going to happen but it isn't premised on any prior experience.  I never met a tiger, but I know they are carnivores and hungry/desperate ones will attack people for food. Te This is most definitely NOT Te. This is Ni, at its barest. There's a sense of knowing something here that isn't necessarily grounded in fact. The tiger could be charging at me as an action of play, but my Ni has already construed this is not a common behavior in tigers and based on the details my Se is telling me that it's targeting me for food. I don't know or claim to know what an Si-user necessarily processes, but in this case my assumption is that Si/Ne would probably be more focused on what's going to hurt, what it's going to do first, which part of the attack you will die from, how much you wished you hadn't wandered into the Savannah alone. Again, I don't understand the Si/Ne duality, but this is my take.  It's still coming at me maybe 50m away. Se  I'm also smaller than they are and have few defenses. Te Again, not Te. How the hell is this Te? Te would be ""I can hit it to deter it or I can step to the side and maneuver myself."" Remember, intuition is a PERCEPTIVE function; thinking is the judgment.   I know I'm going to die if I don't do something. Nx, probably Ne I love how you mentioned ""Nx"" because you can't tell if this should be Ne or Ni, because you don't understand Ni. But calling it Ne, in your mind, defeats my point. It doesn't.   25m away. Se  I should run, but if I do it will pursue. I should hide, but if I do it will detect my scent. Ne/Te Again, Wrong. You grab at straws here. It sounds like it could be N, but you're applying what you used earlier in the discussion to link it to Te, but you're doing your very best to deny anything Ni.  0m. Se I'm going to die.  ""My ""Si-filters"" aren't limiting anything, ironically it is your Si-filters that are limiting your understanding, because you are an ISTJ in denial.""   Let me reiterate something to you. You don't understand Ni, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. But when you think you know something that you aren't attuned to and you keep finding weak arguments to try to ""defeat"" me, you're only digging yourself into a hole. You also don't seem to understand that Ni and Se work in duality. Clearly a tiger coming at me is a stressful situation that will invoke my Se while my Ni has to take a backseat. But still, I show you that in this particular example, Ni clutches on because it introduces doubts when trying to evade an inevitability. See how many times you rightfully pointed out Se?   Don't try to be too presumptuous. I don't claim to know Si and its every facet, but I can sure as hell spot it when it's masking your understanding of Ni. I don't care if you think you've ""won"" or you're superior. Gloat in it, but stop misrepresenting information to people."

mbti,3cccny,Komatik,4,Tue Jul 7 08:58:02 2015 UTC,"I really like your analysis of Ne and its abstract conception of money.  Professionally, I have been a working class fly on the walls of the most successful and wealthy people of the world.  I've been able to overhear private conversations of CEOs and people involved in all forms of big business.  The big take away that I learned about rich people is that money is an abstract concept for them.  An investor that is millions of dollars in debt is still ""richer"" than the man that has twenty bucks in his pocket.  These are examples of speculation.  The rich man is speculating that he can turn around his temporary financial troubles with his next business venture.  The poor man is speculating if he can pay his bills and afford certain luxuries, like food. I think this is a good example of Ne over Si vs Si over Ne.  Either the rich man or the poor man if they are heavier Ne users and can integrate their Si, will see their current financial situation as fleeting, but through Si maybe know from experience that they will be just fine and be able to solve the problem.  The corollary to this is the miser, either rich or poor, that leads with higher Si.  They hold on to their money and thus keep it, just in case, or like you said clip coupons.  These are the ""value of a dollar"" people rather than the ""money is a concept"" people.  The former are Si heavy, maybe born into their financial situation, good or bad, and the idea is to conserve and mitigate risks rather than the you gotta spend money to make money types.  One is expansive, the other is conservative."
mbti,3cccny,jermofo,6,Tue Jul 7 03:30:39 2015 UTC,"Ni means I am in a constant state of reading and consolidating everything in the environment into the strongest possible impression. Basically, in a crowd of people, I'm thinking less about what I'm going to do because somehow I'm preoccupied with the knowledge that by the end of the night, the two guys by the door are going to wind up fighting, and the chick by the fish tank is going to cheat on her boyfriend. It's not that I don't occupy myself by playing guitar or talking and smoking cigarettes, it just means that as ar as how my mind works, I'm basically asking ""what's going on?"". When I'm not actively trying to make real world predictions, I'm usually trying to find some kind of strange poetic or symbolic way of viewing a particular facet of reality in the way that most strongly resonates with me and provokes the greatest emotional response. While I can be proactive, it definitely takes a backseat to my need to ""figure it out"". I'm not ""in the moment"" in terms of just openly accepting the current moment on its own terms in a way that is instinctual and self-centered (not saying that I don't behave in a self centered way), but rather I'm looking at all the implicit information available in the current moment, and why whatever seems to exert the strongest pull on my attention is as it is. Sometimes it can be an abstract concept like ""commerce"" or ""authority"", or it could revolve around a particular persons likely history and future, or their driving passion, or even where this piece of furniture comes from and how it was made."

Si is your impressions of the concrete world. Ne is the exploration of the abstract world. Ni is your impressions of the abstract world.

mbti,3cbtbe,littlewarrior7410,6,Mon Jul 6 18:13:45 2015 UTC,Take a cognitive functions test and research the cognitive functions. I always tested almost right on the border of N/S but after researching more about the cognitive functions I was able to determine that I was an INTJ. If you're an ENFJ your functions will be Fe-Ni-Se-Ti or if you're an ENFP your functions will be Ne-Fi-Te-Si
mbti,3cbtbe,phoenix1245,6,Mon Jul 6 18:27:57 2015 UTC,"There's two main ways to assign yourself a type / get yourself a type code.  The first is assigning yourself four letters by taking a test (or doing it yourself), the second figuring out what cognitive functions (~=go-to habits for taking in, evaluating and organizing information) you use. Both give you the same kind of code because the approaches have a lot of shared history, but the meaning behind the code is different because of how it's arrived at.   Using a test or otherwise looking into the four dichotomies to get a code and then look what kind of functions you're supposed to use from that is usually a bad idea (for example, I often get IxTP results from tests - this would mean I use Ti, which I don't - I'm a very clear Te type). Despite being different, both of these approaches give you valuable information but should be kept separate because they mean very, very different things.  The tests / dichotomatic approach ranks you on four different scales that are more or less separate from each other - ie. your score on one shouldn't influence your score on the others much at all. Having only a slight preference here is normal, and pretty much expected. The test results tend to fluctuate a good bit as well, especially so if you have only mild preferences one way or another - mood, the day, the alignment of the stars and whether your cat clawed your eyes out in the morning all become a large influence in your responses.  What the test letters mean, roughly: I/E = introverted/extroverted. Do you like being out and about, esp. around people. N/S = Abstract-minded or concrete person. F/T = Do you reason more on sentiment and good/bad type of judgment or in a cold, detached way. The F items put a good deal of weight on being accomodating (ie. something the functions approach would term extroverted Feeling, Fe) P/J = How organized, scheduled, conscientious you are. The more P, the more disorganized and spontaneous, the more J, the more organized and planned.      If looking at this, it makes sense how eg. getting a job would make you seem more J - and by the test's measure, you are, and the results of the dichotomatic test actually told you something useful about yourself. But I wouldn't use them to assign yourself a functional type.  To explain that better, let's look at the other way to get a type code: figuring out what functions you use.  The functional approach is a rough model that tries to explain how you take in, evaluate and organize information by dividing the information processing into four core processes (Thinking, Feeling, Sensing and iNtuition) each of which has two attitudes (ie. extraversion, or interest in the external world, and introversion, ie. interest in what is going on inside your head) and then figuring out which processes you use in what attitudes. They're often shortened to a function code of Core process and Attitude, ie. Sensing in the extroverted attitude = Se.  Two examples would be an inclination to use the Thinking function focusing more on personal models, their accuracy and looking for root causes (introverted Thinking, Ti) or the state of the outside world or analyzed system, exerting control over it and making the most of what you have (extroverted Thinking, Te), or using Feeling to focus more on the harmony of the group and people's expressions of sentiment (extroverted Feeling, Fe) or on being true to yourself and looking at the motivations behind expressions of sentiment (introverted Feeling, Fi).  To contrast why it's important to focus on the meaning behind the code rather than the code itself, Test/Dichotomatic ENTP v. ENTJ, for example, is basically asking whether the person is more haphazard and spontaneous or more planned, conscientious and orderly - it's directly what the tests measure and the types differ only on one scale. They're both extroverts and iNtuitive Thinkers.  In Function-land, where we look at how the person takes in, evaluates and organizes information, the meaning is different. Here we find that ENTPs and ENTJs use an entirely different set of processes:  ENTPs are primarily watchers who lead with extroverted Intuition (Ne) - it's an exploring, brainstorming kind of process that draws its inspiration from the outside world and is very interested in it, and complement that with Ti - an evaluating process that focuses on building accurate mental models of things. How the cogs turn is more important than what that turning accomplishes.  ENTJs lead with extroverted Thinking or Te - cold, detached reasoning like Ti, but focused on evaluating the properties of the outside world and exerting control over it, usually with the aim of ordering it to be more efficient. They complement this with introverted Intuition, which in contrast to Ne's curious exploration just drinks in tons of information and subconsciously finds patterns in there that it then condenses it into a holistic understanding of how something ticks that the Ni type himself often needs to work to ""map out"".  In short, they're totally different :D  Same applies to INTP vs. INFP - in test-land the difference is a slight preference to Thinking or Feeling type items in the questionnaire, but in Function-land an INTPs primary processes are Ti (dominant/compulsive) and Ne (auxiliary/habitual), while INFPs lead with Fi and use Ne as auxiliary - they share the habitual process and their dominant function is introspective, evaluative in nature so their minds are kind of similar in construction, but the compulsive, dominant process is different which is a very large change.  tl;dr: Same code, different meaning. Keep them separate, and they will be useful to you. Try to force them to align, and you'll only confuse yourself or end up acting in a non-genuine way."
mbti,3cbtbe,Komatik,2,Mon Jul 6 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"Haha! I'm an INFP in dichotomatic terms. It would be hard to be a more different (arche)type. Those questions about ""Are you nice guy or a cold-hearted psychopathic robot?"" kinda throw me to the ""F"" side.    I honestly think they should give the two interpretations of MBTI different names, because too many people confuse them these days. I'll stick to the functional approach, thanks."

Typically Fe types are more interested in causes for the collective whole, while Fi types are drawn more to causes for individuals. For example, a stereotypical Fe type would be more drawn to teaching, while a stereotypical Fi type would be more drawn to tutoring. An Fe-dom would want to change the world for the masses, an Fi-dom would want to change someone's life."

mbti,3c89re,ccmylove,4,Sat Jul 11 08:13:26 2015 UTC,"ENTP; Personally, I've wondered about this same thing and it makes a lot of sense to me that ""guilty pleasures"" might coincide with our inferior functions. I'd go a bit further and say our tertiary is involved as well.   I love emo/screamo music. It's emotive and melodramatic at the same time. It's also a little bit cheap and/or unrefined compared to say, jazz or classical genres. For this reason, I would never own up to liking it (ha), but I think I listen to it because it stimulates my Fe. Fe is my mobilizing function and I've noticed I often pick up an old emo/screamo record when I'm in need of a boost.   As far as Si goes, it's a perceptive function, not one of judgement, so it's a bit harder for me to nail down specific examples of what might appeal to that function in myself. I suppose it manifests itself most generally in a preference for, idk, wholesomeness? In terms of aesthetics, from personal appearance to the decoration of my apartment, I tend to prefer the tried-and-true over anything too brazen or unconventional."

mbti,3c7fjl,_mildude,6,Sun Jul 5 19:02:18 2015 UTC,"First, what Si is, functionally: Subjectively-stored sensation of concrete things. It takes in the experience of what something felt like, and stores that. It associates these concrete happenings with others as they did, tending to give Si types a good memory for reconstructing how things unfolded.  Second: Anyone can do anything. A function isn't memory, a function isn't the capacity to think, or feel, or see things, or have ideas, or experiencing something. Those are raw biological (and outside world physical) stuff that our functions work with, take in, evaluate, organize.  To use Si is to put weight and value on those aspects of experiencing, just as to use Se is to put weight and value on seeing the world as close to how it is as possible given our human ""hardware"", and experiencing it as fully as possible, in the moment.  To put it another way: A function is not a tool you use to do something, functions and function stacks are a cognitive phenotype that predisposes the individual to pay attention to certain aspects of life that then result in peculiar ways of action and thinking that we notice their use from.  As an analogy, let's use flying as our action and ""wings"" to substitute for brains. We have a small bird and a bat as our two humans of different types. They both are drawn to fly in a way that is very peculiar to them and others like them. You can probably ask the bird to pay attention to how the bat flies and ask it to fly to someplace like a bat does and it might be able to do that with some concentration, but that is not its nature. It probably wouldn't be content, in the long term, if it had to fly like a bat. It can if it needs to, but if you just ask either to get you some token in a science experiment, both are going to go and do the task their way and enjoy it.  (Si users, please correct me if some of this is wrong, it is the function I currently understand least well, so feedback would be appreciated)"

mbti,3c7fjl,Komatik,6,Mon Jul 6 07:55:10 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm really bad at Si (probably not surprising as it's my second last function). Please tell me if my assessment is compatible.  I'm great at using Se, so am very perceptive while in the moment. I like noticing things and sensations etc. The more I pay attention and catalogue, the more I am able to remember little details many years into the future. I am very accurate when retelling events. I can review everything, but when I do, it's similar to a memory of a dream. I rewatch the story happen in my head as an observer. However when it comes to feelings, it's transient. My emotional memory of past events is shocking.  I don't know if other people are able to do this or not, but I am unable to relive feelings/emotions. When they're gone, they're gone and I need a new source. I can remember that I felt happy, excited, sad, angry, etc - but it's just a word. Even the feeling of love... I think that's why I constantly look for reassurance to remind me - because I actually don't remember. If I go on a date, and have a wonderful time, I'll spend the next couple of days in the afterglow, almost frantically reliving everything I remember happening to try and commit to my long term memory. I try to remember every sensory detail. But by the end of the week, the feelings have gone. The rush of adrenaline, the pumping of my heart, the butterflies in my stomach, the glow in my cheeks... they're merely words in my head. I am good at retelling the story to myself, and to an extent, my Fe is able to relive the experience through that, but it's not the same. I think it's a reason that in relationships, I can come across as needy and clingy.  My Si is also selective. In my last toxic relationship, we fought all the time, and it would make me so depressed. But wait a week or two, and I was back to being bouncy and optimistic because all the negative feelings were forgotten. It is so easy to live through Se... but having stronger Si would have saved me years of wrong choices.  I'd love others to tell me if they experience something similar, or if I just have a bad memory lol."

Seeing a black charger (car) can still make me panic as it's the kind my ex drove (although maybe anyone in an abusive relationship would have this reaction). I am scared to try new things because I have no base to compare them to, Se is more comfortable experiencing new things because they don't feel the need a base of reference.  Lol I am really bad with cognitive function explanations. It might be better to wait for someone else's  reply.  But how I relate is that I have a hard time living ""in"" the moment. Also hearing certain things can remind me of painful memories and I will feel the same way I did the first time it happened (altho less and less over time). I am bad about not letting go of things because the pain I felt can be repeated so many times, each time I'm reminded of it.   Si is also scared of change, as I said we like to have a base of reference.  Hope this helps at least somewhat... Sorry I can't be more help!"

An ISxJ will much more easily be able to remember specific sensory details compared to other people.   Also, you could say the same thing about Se. We all use our eyes to see the external world, so by your logic how could such a random thing be a function? Talk to an ESxP who knows about Se. Lookup a youtuber called EJarendee, he's an ESTP.

It is sensory perception that gets introverted and absorbed before coming out.  Introverted thinking is thinking that gets introverted, so dribs and drabs of logical arguments, rational weighing-ups, and so on... all this gets introverted and stored, it ends up being toyed around with inside before it comes out in the same or a different form.  Extroverted functions play around with what's on the outside, so it doesn't absorb. They're more spontaneous too.  So the only reason Si seems to be linked with reflecting, is because it's checking the storehouse of how something made an impression on them. For an ISTJ Si is going to store lots of facts that Te finds useful. Si deals with how the ISTJ was impacted with that fact, and if it will fit in to their framework of facts.  You need to stop reading descriptions and start compiling your own understanding."
mbti,3c7fjl,jermofo,4,Sun Jul 5 18:00:25 2015 UTC,"So the only reason Si seems to be linked with reflecting, is because it's checking the storehouse of how something made an impression on them.   This is important. Both Si and Ni store context for how a situation works - Si's tends to be more concrete and context specific (ie. it'd maybe be prone to treating different sports as different ""models"" and begins building these models readily as it experiences the new situation), Ni's more general and contextualized when needed (general vibe for how conflict works, contextualized to different confrontations).  Give either a situation without context and bad things happen - throw an Ni type into the library and chances are good they'll be ineffective at even simple tasks until they've grokked how the library works, after which the simple task has meaning and can be done.  I remember an Si type telling a story of how he usually went through the woods by a certain route, always. One night he went through it from a different direction and was insanely panicked. Made it back home safely. Determined fellow that he was, he later wanted to face his fear and went to the forest by the unusual route again. Nothing. Nothing strange happened, because his Si had context to work with.

mbti,3c7fjl,Komatik,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:45:16 2015 UTC,"I've heard a similar story of an ENTP describing their inferior Si.  They would follow the same route to work everyday, but if they had to give directions, they would have a hard time remembering what streets they took because it is so routine.  I think routine is very important to Si users, when more dominant and depending on it's relationship to Ne.  In your story, I'm guessing the user has Si higher in their stack than their Ne.  They are resistant to new things, but once they do try something new they can add that to their routine as well or have it replace their old routine entirely if they judge to be better.    In my experience as having Ne 2nd and Si 3rd in my stack, Si (or maybe in conjunction with one of my judging functions) seems to whittle down the new experiences my Ne takes in and I tend to develop a routine after having tried several other things first.  The end result is that I'll have a routine that I'll tend to follow but will like to change it up when a new possibility presents itself and there are things that I'll try to never do again based on how I perceived certain experiences.   I could be wrong too, and Si is responsible for quite a bit more than this example, but this is my understanding of it."

mbti,3c7fjl,saltath,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:57:32 2015 UTC,"That makes sense.  Since an INTP's Si isn't repressed they have better control of it, which helps reign in and focus Ne's overwhelming desire for novelty and tendency to bounce around. INTPs are therefore able to be slower and more deliberate and conservative with their perceptions, lingering on an idea longer. The INTP is able to build on their ideas and flesh them out better with Si higher up.  Maybe I'd say an INTP builds a sky scraper, while the ENTP builds a sprawling metropolis with their ideas.  I'm sure the placement of Ti has a lot to do with the differences of approach, but the nature of how Si stores information is very important too."

mbti,3c2h9t,toyouitsjustwords,2,Sat Jul 4 06:58:48 2015 UTC,"I believe the idea is to characterize each type's Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust?  That's kinda tricky (heh) because emotions and personality are two things that are hard to associate with each other.  However, the INTP must be open to these systems-associations-conceptualizations thingies so let's try.  First of all, I think emotions could arguably be attributed to certain domains of the self, instincts or processes that interact to form the nebulous whole that we call ""personality."" So I think we could extrapolate the functions to the Inside Out homunculi.   Of the five, Joy and Sadness were given more air time, so the other three weren't as fully fleshed out.  Some inferences about them could still be made, though, so I'll begin with them.     Anger is motivated by order, triggered when something goes against how one envisions it ought to go.  Thus analogous to the Thinking functions.  Te would react to external (dis)order, Ti to internal ones.   Fear is motivated by possibilities (i.e. the one who could envision what could go wrong and how), so it's kinda like iNtuitive functions, and the extraversion/introversion would once again be based on whether Fear looks more outward through the screen or inward to the islands and memories and the overall internal landscape.   Disgust is motivated by the gut reaction to things and people, and how to react.  Quite consistent with the Feeling functions.     Now on to the big two:   Joy is motivated by satisfaction.  Could be analogous to the Sensing functions.  I think Riley's Joy is Se, because she is so glued to the screen through which they watch the outside world, always eager for immediate and tangible sources of joyfulness.  An Si Joy would probably be more capable in maneuvering the inner world of memories. Sadness is... well, trickier because it doesn't fit the functions as well.  I would tentatively associate this with a variable which I believe is not taken into consideration by Jungian typology and MBTI, but is validated by the one other equally (or even more so?*) empirical system of describing the personality:  the Big Five.  The variable that is accounted for in the Big Five that is not present in the four polarities of MBTI is ""Neuroticism.""  Which (incidentally like 4 out of the 5 emotions) is termed in a rather negatively-sounding way but in actuality refers to a neutral process.  Neuroticism is more about an individual's emotional susceptibility to external influence.  Thus, poorly developed, it leads to negative reactions, like depression and so on.   And indeed, Sadness is, amongst the other emotions, the most ""emotional.""  She is the hardest to handle, being the least ""reasonable"" or ""controllable"".  So I rather think that the Neuroticism element fits Sadness best.  So. After that long-winded preamble.  To address the main issue.  Characterizing the types Inside-Out style.  ...well, that would make this already lengthy comment even more so.  Haha.  Anyway, the associations I proposed herewith would suggest that Riley is Se dominant, which I think fits.  She'd either be ESTP (hockey! goofball!) or ESFP (friendship! family!).  Interesting to note that Riley's father seems to be Thinking-dominant, probably Te.  (Forgot the mother's.)  For me, being an INTP, this means Anger is also dominant, but since he's Ti, he'd be more involved in the care of the behind-the-scenes.  And would probably be in charge with the Train of Thought, like, 24/7, and often gets mad when the delivery of Fact and Opinion crates are disorganized.  It's mostly Fear (Ne) who manages the controls (hah).  Whenever he's not too heavy-handed with the brakes, he could actually allow me to navigate the world properly.  Joy (Si) is more fascinated with the memories, and often wishes she could somehow infiltrate Long-Term and—even better—search through the disposal pit.  (Who knows what memories are still worth keeping.  More commercial jingles, maybe, and obscure information on dinosaurs.)  Joy is also a bit in love with Anger.  Disgust (Fe) is also hands-on with the controls, and is especially partial to the good-natured-snark buttons.  She sometimes messes up with the ""good-natured"" part though, much to Anger's consternation.  Lastly, my Sadness is sober.  Most of the time.  I could probably envision the Inside Out scenarios of the rest of the types, but it would perhaps be more accurate coming from those types themselves? :D"

Try to get up earlier (with an alarm) as if you're going to school at 10am and go outside for 10 minutes. You might find you're more active for the rest of the day as you've forced yourself to be active, even if that activity is just buying a mars bar from the corner shop."

mbti,3byey4,ScalSaver,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:41:08 2015 UTC,"modafinil   If caffeine => Acceleration of global metabolism : it's risky.  And compensation apply.  If any other excitant => Same. The more powerful the effect is, the worse it is in the long run.  So, cocaïne is really bad at this regard. (Duh)  Generally I have little confidence in psychoactive substances."
mbti,3byey4,jrhsk8,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:51:37 2015 UTC,"It's a dopamine agonist (definitely different from caffeine) but not in a recreational way. It just makes you feel really rested, or at least perfectly awake. It's not particularly dangerous in that it's often prescribed daily to narcoleptics, and I only use it around once a week anyway (Double shifts starting at 5am are a bitch if you're a night owl).  Though I will say I like recreational drugs, this is just functional, like caffeine. But different.  Makes ya poop though. Went to a camp that penalized you for falling asleep, took it every day. Worked fine but drained me a little when I got back. It ruined my butt though."
mbti,3byey4,ScalSaver,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:43:00 2015 UTC,"just functional, like caffeine   Saying you aren't functional without caffeine is stupid : it just means you have to adapt your nutrition.  Stop coffee and whatever makes you slow and tired. Usually gluten, I guess. Most of starches are difficult to digest, hence needs lots of energy to be metabolized.  There is other things I read on that but there is little chances they apply to you or are even true.   It ruined my butt though.   Lol.  Metabolism is a precision mechanic. Calibrated intake means calibrated output : that's what ""you are what you eat"" means.  But our chaotic lifestyles and laid back ordinary make this kind of thing painfully difficult."
mbti,3byey4,jrhsk8,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:04:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, it's not that I need it. I probably go 5 days a week without caffeine or modafinil. I just use it to keep me awake and alert for long shifts or when I haven't had enough sleep. Diet is probably important too."

mbti,3bvx2f,BeastmasterGeneral,3,Thu Jul 2 16:51:19 2015 UTC,"This is really great advice, and it's actually what helped me embrace my INTJ-ness. Two of my best friends are INTPs and I used to test as one too, but I always ended up being the uptight one -- worried about what we were gonna do next, anxious about time management and not getting home too late, generally looking for structure and being uncomfortable without it. That helped me realize that I may be disorganized and pretty loosey-goosey compared to the average, I'm still a J."
mbti,3bvx2f,NeedForAccuracy,2,Thu Jul 2 17:21:36 2015 UTC,I agree with you on those things however sometimes I can really let loose or get drunk and not care about those things as much as I usually do (even though I think I care more than my xxxP friends so that could be a good indicator but I can't say for sure).
mbti,3bvx2f,ashirviskas,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:31:07 2015 UTC,"Well, sure, that's normal for anybody who drinks or uses any intoxicant, to an extent.

Not accounting for, say, intoxication, or ADD (in my case), or social anxiety, or whatever, where do your most natural, primal inclinations lie? That answer tells you something, and if you can't figure it out, the journey to that answer will tell you even more."

mbti,3bvx2f,ashirviskas,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:36:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, I have met a few INTPs but it's hard to get to know them because well they never leave the house, but they don't seem to be very ambitious and they are very expressive sometimes however I don't think this is enough for me to be certain, for example lets say I know 3 INTPs (2 guys and a girl), one guy and the girl are not ambitious at all, the girl is rather expressive in her emotions, one guy is basically dead inside, and the other (possibly very ambitious) expresses rarely emotions and has the same music taste as me except more diverse, while the first guy has a lot of similarities as me I can't say we are the same, because a girl that use to date both of us said we were rather very different."
mbti,3bvx2f,NeedForAccuracy,3,Thu Jul 2 17:28:45 2015 UTC,"I prefer to use Jung's cognitive functions instead of MBTI. It makes more sense to me anyways. :P  I think the first problem is that, from what I've learned, you have slightly off definitions of the functions. The i's (si, fi, etc.) basically mean internal or subjective, and the e's (se, te, etc.) mean external or objective. For example, te would be using external methods for thinking about stuff. You'd place great importance on what experts say, facts and figures, concrete objective stuff in the real world (Te users are more likely to think they're right, because you can't argue facts). Your thoughts would be directed outwards and you like influencing the outside world and environment (thus the whole INTJ rule the world stereotype). Ti is internal, so subjective. Facts and stuff will still be used, but not ""for their own sake."" The main goal for ti users is to understand stuff personally. They don't take things at face value and don't have as much of a desire to affect others or the world. They're just really curious and have their own logical system that makes sense to them. They have a ""why?"" mentality. If something doesn't add up, they'll want to go sort it out while a te user kinda just wants the facts that are necessary to get things done and then moves on. Ti users will dwell on things more.   This makes sense with the other functions. None of them, in my opinion, deal with time. It's simply external or internal. With ni, your subconscious insights would appear to come out of nowhere, like they just pop up when you're not thinking about it. You just get a feeling about stuff. Ne needs external input, so you might see a startup that reminds you of another startup or something, and then you'd get your conclusion that startup A is following after startup B. Ne based conclusions can be explained, while ni can't. Because ne is externally based, it allows you to continually see possibilities for situations, people, and things. If something no longer shows potential, it's on to the next thing. That's why ENTPs are known for being so ""springy"" and experimental.   Se=objects are simply objects, 5 senses are what they are. Si=moods, vibes, ambiance are behind the 5 senses. They have a subjective impact on you that's different from what others might feel. Se user says ""this water is nice and blue,"" si user says ""this beach is so cheerful and optimistic feeling.""  Fe=you are affected by the emotions of others and absorb their moods. You don't mind being fake if it means maintaining emotional harmony with everyone. You'd rather be cooperative and inoffensive. Fi=you don't care about what others think as much and are unaffected by what everyone else is feeling. You're big on individualism and authenticity. You'd rather be blunt and say what needs to be said no matter the reaction of others.  Try again with the new function definitions now and see if you relate to the type."

mbti,3bvx2f,forfourwon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:13:07 2015 UTC,"Well I do know the functions but maybe not so in detail, but I do understand them well enough to type other people and recognize them in real life. However I am thankful because I never felt like a Si user and this I suppose cleared some stuff on it, but something still bothers me and it's the Te-Fi and Ti-Fe axis, like I suppose I relate more to the first axis but at times I feel as if I use the second one more often, like I said I have no problems DIFFERENTIATING the functions but IDENTIFYING with them is problematic. Like at some times I feel like I use one axis and the other at other times. This could be the reason why I end up typing myself as an INFJ on some sites (such as www.25quiz.com)."
mbti,3bvx2f,ashirviskas,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:16:48 2015 UTC,I thought I'd reexplain them in the hopes that the new definitions would click better. The problem is that it's hard to evaluate your own brain. Sorry I can't help much.

mbti,3bq2l0,chooseaprettyone,6,Wed Jul 1 06:02:35 2015 UTC,"The big thing to finding a stable type is looking at cognition more so than action - how you take in, evaluate and organize information rather than how you act, which the tests lean more towards (the tests measure different things than the functions do - they give the same type code because they share a common history, not because the code means the same thing).  If you want to explore the functions side of things, this is the typical information (over)dose I recommend for those getting into functional typology:  Lessons on functions-based typology by Michael Pierce is easily one of the best introductions to functional typology I have ever seen, and certainly made the mess of jargon click for me when I started.  Celebritytypes has good comparison tables for the different functions - this is probably good to look at side by side with Pierce's introductory videos.

mbti,3bq2l0,kalg,4,Wed Jul 1 12:38:35 2015 UTC,"If you're an introvert who's not using your extraverted 2nd function, you could be mistaking your two introverted functions (Ti/Si) as your top two. If that's the case, you're looking at Si>(Fe)>Ti>(Ne) or Ti>(Ne)>Si>(Fe). So... ISFJ or INTP.  You can do the same with INTJ, if that was the stressed version. Ni>(Fe)>Ti>(Se) or Ti>(Se)>Ni>(Fe) give you INFJ or ISTP as types that could look like INTJ when under chronic stress.  The other thing to look at is what your 4th function would be and compare it to how you act when you're very upset. Fe (ISTP & INTP)gets emotional and throws a tantrum, Ne (ISFJ) starts a spiral of negative posibilities (If this is ruined, then this is ruined, and this, and I'm going to die poor and hungry!), Se (INFJ & INTJ) gets overwhelmed by consequences so just ignores them becoming reckless.

mbti,3bpgik,ShimmerScroll,4,Wed Jul 1 03:24:26 2015 UTC,"I suppose since the article discussed cognitive style, I was wondering if their findings aligned at all with people that identify as dom intuitives here. Honestly, going with immediate intuitive judgements, seems a lot like how people interpret intuition (Ni anyway) in MBTI in my experience (prior to learning about functions and what not)  Beyond that, the article also discussed the possibility of it being that many of those people could have a harder time with it simply because they were raised in a particular environment with particular beliefs and rituals, which could be Si peeking out, which many people confuse for Ni.   I just wanted to see what other people thought about it. I'm always interested in the fact that people approach things differently than I do."

mbti,3boufy,Person4645,4,Tue Jun 30 23:02:21 2015 UTC,"having an extroverted function as a first function instead of a perceiving one manifests in a primary desire to interact with the outside world. With extroverted perceiving this usually manifests as a desire to be aware of/open to the outside world either by sensing or intuiting, and with extroverted judging this manifests as a desire to control to outside world, primarily using either ""thinking"" or ""feeling."" I'd prefer to call those two methods ""objective, measurable standards,"" and ""subjective, qualitative standards,"" to be a little more precise.   Someone who is introverted prefers to dwell on that which is in their own mind, and the external information/decision making comes secondary to that. Introverted perceiving is an awareness of one's perception (in a away) coupled with a desire to control the environment, while introverted judging is an effort to control one's internal presence coupled with a desire for awareness of/openness to the environment.   Someone can be an ""introverted"" extrovert, but not technically by MBTI terms. What that would usually mean is the person still is energized by and primarily works in their external environment, but for some reason they have become timid. In other words, they may be acting ""introverted"" but they still mainly use an extroverted function to interact with the world, causing them to feel ""starved"" if they go a long time without ""feeding"" their main function with interaction.   To sum it all up, the difference between introversion and extroversion in the same two-type family, xNTJ as in your example, is quite noticeable. They may use the same functions, but at least for the first portion of one's life, everything after the first function is noticeably underdeveloped. They will manifest very differently because of this. I'd venture to say that an ENTJ may in many ways appear more like the ESTJ than the INTJ when he is very young but has developed to use Te as his primary function, and the INTJ more like the INFJ.   Does that answer all your questions? I think I didn't make any mistakes in descriptions, but anyone can feel free to correct me if I'm wrong."
mbti,3boufy,_mildude,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:48:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can dig it. I have trouble understanding a cognitive function in a vacuum. It's always been a judging/perceiving pair.   To your knowledge how does it look early on with only the one perceiving/judging function being developed? Continuing off the XNTJ example, would primary Te draw their conclusions based on inaccurate, underdeveloped Ni data? And likewise primary Ni draw inaccurate conclusions because of undeveloped Te?"
mbti,3boufy,_mildude,3,Wed Jul 1 00:06:48 2015 UTC,"I'd say that you don't put children in charge of anything important for a reason, and this would probably be why. When only one of these functions has solidified itself, a child isn't really capable of complete cognition in the sense that adults employ it in everyday life.   I know it's been theorized somewhere that before a child sets in on a particular function, they ""try out"" functions at random. I would say it's possible that one's second function may not completely solidify until sometime later in childhood, leaving the child open to do the same thing as with the first.   Actually it would make more sense to say that once the child has subconsciously decided on a function they may use the two options left for their non-repressed axis (ie the second and third functions which would have not developed just yet) freely and then settle in on which auxiliary will be their go-to.    For example: say a child has begun to settle on Te for their primary function. It is the main way she sees the world, or rather the sharpest tool she has with which to do what she wants. The child noticeably is concerned with tangible proof and striving for measurable outcomes in her world. Now she may either develop Si or Ni to aid in achieving the ends of her first function. There could either be a time when she uses the two interchangeably and only later does she settle on a type, or she could move with a steady trend toward one or the other based on other, possibly unseen factors. Or, for all I know they both appear at the same time. I have no actual data to go off of. The auxiliary function and the primary function probably both develop at different and varying speeds depending on the person, and I'm sure some kids psychologically develop before others just as they do physically.   Say that however it happens, Ni starts to show up in our budding ENTJ. She starts to see long range visions to which she begins to stride, but since Ni didn't ""get there first,"" the Ni will first appear only as an assisting function to the Te. Her first desire for the first portion of her life will be to gain control over her environment via objective, logical methods, with the vision and ultimate goal an afterthought. As she ages, that vision will manifest less as an afterthought and more as an ever-present idea, something that she's more comfortable exploring to deeper levels.   So, to answer your question, I can see how this would cause a young ENTJ to rush into things without considering the importance of it in the big picture, and I can see Ni doms being so engrossed in what could be that they become afraid to or don't know how to act in the present moment. Both of these options would cause underdeveloped children to draw wildly inaccurate conclusions about the world."

I can assure you that as a T dominant rather than an N dominant, I don't have much of a plan. I just want results. There are several times where that comes back to bite.   ENTJ is quite off-the-wall, often making up answers to questions and problems that are completely off-base.   I've found this to be way more true with INTJs, but then again I know significantly more of them than other ENTJs.   They disguise their insecurities with lies   I can't even tell a lie. The closest I get is carefully-worded partial truths.   It's just that for every captain of football, chess team and class president ENTJ there is another one who slacks off, procrastinates on his work, argues with everyone, has alcoholism issues, and has a good sense of humor.   This is true of every single type out there. I have often been told that I'm way too nice to be an ENTJ.   The ENTJ has no honor   honor is an extremely subjective term...   ENTJ are trying to weasel their way to the top and put everyone else down if need be.   This is a little bit sketchy and from how I handled some personal events, I can see where you may derive this from. You mention a loyalty that we have elsewhere. This comes into play here. If you have made our good side, you won't be bulldozed. If you are not on our good side, we have likely already told you why. To me, weaseling is more back-door-ish and backstabbing...

mbti,3bnxwn,Kdog0073,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:49:21 2015 UTC,"That's true but in my post I cover why I think this is incorrect. I actually disagree with the consensus on many things regarding mbti.   For example you won't find anyone capable of even defining Si or what it is. They either stereotype incorrectly or they generalize and use fluff in place of a real definition. In fact I dare someone to try and define it here. I don't think you will find their answer anything beyond a vague and needing further expansion.   And really I don't think that a separate function does exist between the ESTJ and ENTJ users. I think some people are practical and traditional and others are not. This is mainly due to environment and personal choices.   At the end of the day I think that an ENTJ is someone who is extroverted, makes decisions and forms understanding through their own intuitive understandings. They are a thinker, and prefer logic to values or emotional gut reactions, and they are competitive and full of willpower/motivation making them J. Basically inside that broad net there can be any sort of ENTJ imaginable. NT is a self-centered combination. N motivates people to live by their own rules and T motivates people to be competitive and look out for themselves. This can manifest in any number of bad personalities not only including the dictator type. The conniving rat ENTJ is very much a thing. There is just more manipulating people involved than say an INTJ would.  When I talk about N I'm not differentiating here between Ne or Ni mind you. I think N is just N. But having a full understanding of the functions being told to ""study them"" countless times, I still use them when I need to clarify points to those who do follow that model."
mbti,3bnxwn,--treandoge--,3,Wed Jul 1 21:30:32 2015 UTC,"My understanding of Si vs Se is that Si tends to be based on your own personal experience (i.e. you make decisions based on your own past). Se in contrast is more present as a person takes in the world around them. This ends up being a huge component in why an ENTJ is hardcore result-oriented. The dominant Te and the Se extroverted combination drives us to see what is happening now and how we can get to the result we want.  But you are right in that those answers are vague. Actually, any personality study you have is vague. Whether you use MBTI, Jungian, Socionics, etc... all of them are very vague. You don't end up with a profile that is you. You end up with one that describes you A) mostly, maybe ~75-85% and B) better than the other alternatives.  The interesting part though is when you see all the different versions of people who share your same MBTI, sometimes you can see yourself in them because of the many similarities. The 15-25% difference that I assert still gives plenty of room for differences, giving you large variations between each type.  Now the reason an ENTJ seems more manipulative than an INTJ is because manipulation is more typically associated with getting results. The core difference between ENTJ and INTJ is that the ENTJs are the ones with calculated actions, while INTJs are the ones with calculated plans. INTJs typically plan around others while ENTJs typically take action on the spot. But it isn't necessarily all bad; when you think of it, manipulate is the negative version of inspire. Whether it is manipulation or inspiration is subject to the point of view of course.  I haven't read up on the subject, but I am curious if Briggs thought of the same thing when coming up with MBTI. After all, the MBTI notation implies 4 independent functions as opposed to interlocked ones. In reality though, both systems have their drawbacks and are far from comprehensive."
mbti,3bnxwn,_mildude,3,Thu Jul 2 01:29:13 2015 UTC,"If an NTJ feels the need to hide their insecurities they need to open up. Having a few people who understand you 100% is something that makes you stronger, not weaker. I'm sort of ashamed to admit that you got the honour and loyalty thing correct. I am 100% loyal to someone or don't give a fuck about them, no middle ground. I feel like I could l could lie to a lot of other people but if I found out they lied to me I'd be pissed.   I find that im pretty relaxed. When i get stressed i become more introverted, figure out what is the problem and then  fix it. Estjs are hot headed and throw tantrums like babies, in my experience. A guy I respected a lot blew his top on regularly. I disliked how he 100% had to be leader of the group I hang out with. Who feels the need to lead a group of friends? This absolute need for hierarchy is what gets me about otherwise awesome stjs. Long story short he got really angry because everyone in the group started a sort of lifting phase....we mostly just went to the gym for fun but he seemed very against it. One day he called us all 2 dimensional characters among other things. His rants reeked of narcissism. I think estjs are capable of being bad eggs as much as any type, especially if they have a less than ideal upbringing (this particular estj was from eastern Europe and moved to Ireland. He didn't exactly embrace our culture. I believe Si hindered his transition and rejected the change). Estjs have a habit of imposing their beliefs on others. An estj will take a notion (for example, moterbikes are bad, and anyone who drives them is an asshole) and be completely committed to schooling anyone who rejects that notion on why their opinion is wrong.  These are good observations. But I believe you have a few biases. All types can be good friends or assholes. I'll admit that NTJs need to work on looking out for others while it comes naturally to an esfj, but in the end, being a good or bad person comes down to decisions and experiences.  I find your thoughts on the estp taking drugs or whatever to escape the cold reality of the world interesting. It makes sense given that their dominant extraverted function is She and their dominant introverted function is Ti which also doesn't want to give things abstract meaning. But im not entirely sure how other types are ignoring this cold hard reality. Is it sort of like how enfjs are too caught up in helping others and maintaining appearances to notice?  I totally agree that estps are the most intelligent. Hands down in my experience. They excel in things such as IQ tests, maths and physics stuff that is hard to get your head around and mechanical stuff. The esfj, infj and enfp tend to have better vocal fluency and writing ability. I sort if class this as intelligence. It also has to be considered that the entj will study for months just to be better than other people (competitiveness like this is a weird insecurity, it drives you to your full potential), the stj will do their work diligently and reap the rewards....however the estp won't do shit and will walk into an exam hall and somehow manage to pull a B out of their ass because Ti is more suited to in the moment figuring shit out.  Estps learn more from exams than teacher. Imagine how they would do if they studied! Because of their habits of procrasinating and hatred of studying and estp will rarely achieve like an entj or estj in school."
mbti,3bnxwn,--treandoge--,3,Tue Jun 30 20:45:13 2015 UTC,"I think the drug-using qualities of the estp OP is referring to would be due to repressed Ni, which is what he's saying when he says they can't escape cold, hard reality.   Also I think it's specifically the PeJi combination of Se and Ti that give estps thats ability; to MacGyver shit in the moment. As in if either Ti was first or it was instead Fi then it wouldn't turn out quite the way we're discussing it."

mbti,3bnxwn,--treandoge--,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:03:50 2015 UTC,"I agree that ESTJs can be hot headed like ENTJ. Because that is essentially the Te that drives that rage due to loss of control.  The difference is that given two relatively mature, intelligent versions of ESTJ and ENTJ, the ESTJ is likely to get angry when it's socially acceptable from the perspective of society and the culture they are in. (The Dad who yells at the TV when his sports team is failing) The ENTJ, from my own personal experiences is far more likely to shock people with their immaturity and completely ""socially unacceptable"" rage. They might have a meltdown because they failed a test or something. The ESTJ in this situation would be more likely to think: ""I need to keep my composure and study harder"". Unless of course they are from a culture where scholastic achievement is everything. In that case it could possibly be the opposite whereby the ENTJ meltdown is minimal in comparison.  But if their Si says that being the ""leader"" is what they should do then you're right. But remember that not all Si is the same. It's more of a reflection of the surrounding culture and upbringing. If being calm were the cultural ideal you can expect most Si users to almost never break that frame.   So from a intuitive perspective, much of the Si behavior it looks ludicrous since tradition always involves some questionable parts. Si also doesn't hold up well in the limelight of change and progressive ideas. But when Si is based in effective facts, you can expect the efficiency of the Si user to be astounding."
mbti,3bnxwn,XOmniverse,2,Tue Jun 30 23:00:46 2015 UTC,"I can see your point with how types lose it, the ENTJ will probably be less aware (or just not see the importance of) social etiquette due to lack of Si or Fe. I also heard that Si types tend to blame themselves more, as an ENTJ I don't really lament over my mistakes for too long and have more of a ""well, it's back to the drawing board"" approach for when things go wrong.   Could Si lead an ESTJ not to be a leader if past experiences dictated that leadership isn't a good strategy for getting shit done? Or is it the dominant Te that drives the will and ability to lead people? Similarly could Si turn an ISTJ into default leadership mode if being a leader worked in the past?"

Another is my roommate and while he doesn't go around spreading lies quite as obviously as the first guy, he is absolutely the most shrewd person I have ever met. He, a 19 year old college student, has attempted to get an upperclassman in my dorm impeached from its government. He threatened to sue a lady for not providing a specific part of a service that she advertised, and was afraid he was going to be sued himself for threatening to write a bad review if she didn't (can't remember the word for that). He also got his internship by basically annoying a law firm until they let him join, and he dealt (and did) drugs in high school. I am like 99% sure he is an ENTJ because of other things and because my next roommate was an ESTP and there are some pretty big differences living with the two of them every day.   I can definitely see how many people would have thought he was an asshole, but I had the opportunity to watch how he thought and I could see the objective advantages to everything he was doing. He made a lot of people angry, but I don't think he really cared. It was very interesting.   The one ESTJ I know is not quite hard-working like you described in your write-up. He does what's expected of him and not much more, though he does good work. he also likes to go to pop-punk concerts often during the school year, and will take the risk of not performing as well on graded assignments to attend. This guy's my INFJ friend's roommate, and it's actually really funny watching the two of them interact. They value things so differently, and don't really get along well.   The one ESTP I know has consistently been the hardest workers I've known, and I've known him for over a decade now. He's quick to dismiss overarching concepts that may not be immediately evident to him, but he's also open to a discussion about it and generally not in the least bit an asshole with things like that. It can be simultaneously refreshing and irritating to talk to him about some issues because of how no-bullshit he is about it all."

Yea, there's good stuff like Broods, Animals as Leaders, Woods of Ypres, Allegeaon, BADBADNOTGOOD, Open Mike Eagle, System of a Down, Mindless Self Indulgence, Zef, Danimal Cannon, Danny Baranowsky, Purity Ring, the Intersphere, and Phantograms, but they're not the majority. In fact it bothers me greatly that the one song that Hozier has on the radio is Take Me To Church because that's a good song but the rest of the album is soooo much better!  You were probably kidding.  Still,  /rant"
mbti,3blm3t,Oldthunda,2,Wed Jul 1 00:44:21 2015 UTC,"I was half-kidding. I used to go to that sub religiously because I wholeheartedly disagree with the idea that today's music is objectively worse than older music. However, You're probably much more educated or reasonable about music than the majority of people made fun of there, which I could see from the outset.  Here's what I did to find new music that's also highly rated: first, I treated it like a cataloging mission. I made myself aware of various modern/historical genres mainly via /mu/, and then I looked them up on rateyourmusic.com. from there I went to the most recent year for music that's been cataloged already on the site (which is most music that's not strictly local). Then, I searched for the releases above around 3.5 stars and looked them up on Spotify. I made playlists for each genre and grouped them that way. From there I was free to decide ""huh, today I'm really feeling like listening to X genre,"" and then I would just decide on a random album.  Obviously that method is a little strenuous for most people. But I can tell you that it worked for me.   I think it's also the observer not seeing artists in his current time as highly rated as classic artists that would lead one to believe that modern music is inferior. Most of the bands that, years from now, will be considered ""classic"" and ""ahead of their time"" are not very highly rated when they are new. This is why it's so fun to go on your own musical journey, and venture into the unknown. You could choose to widen your taste in genres, find more artists in the vein you already enjoy, or both. There's just so much you could do with the technology we now have available to ourselves.  And that sounded a lot more heartfelt than I expected it to when I began, but I really, really care about music and others' enjoyment of it."

I'm open to talk about any artist, and I know that my contributions are only limited by my understanding.   I think I most like Indie Rock/folk and Emo as far as genres go, but I also listen to any kind of rap, drone, noise, hardcore punk, grindcore (actually that's one of my favs too for other reasons), post punk, and noise-influenced genres like noise pop/rock, etc. Post rock is great too.

mbti,3bkxgc,Norsk_Xenophile,3,Tue Jun 30 01:44:27 2015 UTC,"First ask yourself why you want to find out your type. Do you want a club membership card so you can go look at articles written off stereotypes and go ""ooh, so me""?  Do you want to be able to describe your behavior and outlooks along certain measures and be able to use those for taking stock of people?  Or do you want to know how your head and other peoples' heads tend to work so you can better understand where they're coming from and how you might want to approach things?  If it's the first, abandon the project now. The stereotypes serve little purpose but to limit your thinking and circlejerk about said stereotypes. They'll most likely be more of a hindrance than a help and mislead you on how your mind works.  If it's the second, look into what the different tests actually measure and use that as a tool for understanding people.  If it's the last one, you should study functional typology. It sounds like a lot of jargon at first, but is much easier than it seems at first. If that's where you want to go, this is the typical information (over)dose I recommend for those getting into functional typology:  Lessons on functions-based typology by Michael Pierce is easily one of the best introductions to functional typology I have ever seen, and certainly made the mess of jargon click for me when I started.  Celebritytypes has good comparison tables for the different functions - this is probably good to look at side by side with Pierce's introductory videos.  After the Lessons:  The ""after"" is bolded because this is a subject where you want a certain foundation built before you go exploring. The stuff above is the foundation, these more for exploration afterwards.  Pierce's portraits of the sixteen types in video  Pierce's portraits of the sixteen types as text  Another look at the functions by Pierce  CelebrityTypes' articles section is full of good stuff  .

mbti,3bkxgc,Komatik,5,Tue Jun 30 09:36:17 2015 UTC,"I am an INFP and come from a family of INFJs/have many INFJ friends. Here are the most concrete differences I've noticed in my personal life:  *Fe vs FI-All the INFJs I know have very noticeable extroverted feeling. Getting angry involves breaking things, yelling, throwing things, and total emotional expression. I am the exact opposite--when I am mad, I am quiet. Whenever my mom (INFJ) and I fight she always yells at me for not reacting enough.  *Absurdism (J vs. P?)-The INFPs and INFJs I know all have similar ideas of the world. I am very distressed by my total lack of control in this big, scary universe, and this distress can be totally paralyzing to me. My INFJ family members and friends actually find comfort in this lack of control, though. They are content to live their small lives amidst this chaos, while this concept causes me, and INFP, more anxiety. I think this might have to do with judging vs. perceiving.  *Confidence-The INFJs I know are more confident than the INFPs I know. They are more confident and concrete in their ideas, whereas I am unsure of everything.  *Extrovert/Introvert-The INFJs I know are occasionally mistaken as extroverts. They place a lot of value on community, whereas the INFPs I know, including myself, keep mostly to ourselves and aren't as invested in interpersonal relationships.  *""Meanness""-The INFJs I know have an easier time being mean to people they dislike, whereas the INFPs I know (including myself) seek approval and validation from everyone, even people we dislike."
mbti,3bkxgc,whitewindowpane,2,Tue Jun 30 02:40:24 2015 UTC,"Getting angry involves breaking things, yelling, throwing things, and total emotional expression   This sounds wrong to me, but I can't quite pinpoint why. To me, that sounds more like inferior Fe. Inferior Fe types don't quite express emotion ""correctly"" and it's usually connected to something else. Sad music when sad, showing anger in an obvious way (yelling, etc). Almost childlike in it's expression. A dom/aux Fe type would be more concerned about the other person in the room, reflecting the mood of the room. They are very ""chameleon"" like, in the sense that they know exactly how to act and what to say to get the responses they want. In this way they can be manipulative without the other person necessarily realizing it. So, yelling & breaking things when angry just doesn't seem very INFJ or Fe dom/aux to me. In fact, that could be more dom/aux Fi, in the sense that whatever it is that is important to the Fi-user, it's so important they need to do what they can to get their point across. They will not back down, even if at some point you logically prove them wrong."
mbti,3bkxgc,felmarah,3,Wed Jul 1 02:47:24 2015 UTC,"Nah. Fe is what makes me confrontational rather than going about my business.

mbti,3bkxgc,CrateredMoon,2,Wed Jul 1 04:29:41 2015 UTC,"But do you go about it in such an expressive/obvious/childlike manner? I didn't say dom/aux Fe users don't need to work things out right away, just the way they approach it is different. I feel like the need to work something out & engage right away is more dom/aux Se territory? What you said about Fe is what made me question actually being an INFJ and pushed me more into the definite notion that I have inferior Fe in reality."

If it's an ongoing thing, I'll developes strong animosity towards them that eventually just comes to a head... As far as I'm concerned, Fe just means that people are never ""in the background"" and easily dismissed. I'm generally amiable and conscientious, but if you rub me the wrong way I exert the same amount of energy, but it winds up being negative and confrontational... If we are cool, I'll be your guardian angel, but it doesn't mean I won't make some enemies... Maybe Ni dominance taints the workings of Fe, but I'm relatively solid on my type but it's something I've noticed... A desire to please, and some form of ""fuck you"" when it doesn't mesh and I got a million other people to consider, and I just think you suck."

I do this too, but this could just be Fe coming out to some extent. Sometimes I feel like an INFJ, but I think that's just getting older, this was just never something I attributed to ""maturing"" Fe. Just the inferior like action of it. Thanks for explaining a bit more about what you mean, I'd be interested in knowing more since it seems to be pretty subtle the difference between your aux Fe and my inf Fe.

We're both idealists, but she's got her head a bit higher in the clouds than me. For example, she's studying International Studies and wants to save the world, while I am sacrificing some of my dreams in order to achieve a stable life in the future (studying advertising instead of devoting myself to writing or art).   Another major difference is the way we see our morals. While I have very concrete, set morals and values, many with no leeway at all, many of hers are quite flexible. She's very open to new ideas, and can be easily persuaded/tricked by people with bad intentions. She thinks everyone is a good person, and can be seen as naive in that sense.  She makes friends very, very easily compared to me. Actually, I do a pretty good job of attracting potential friends, but have trouble opening up. My INFP friend often ""steals"" them and makes them her deep, personal friends (which makes us a great team, because that way I have more time to let myself open up).   The only other difference I can think of is that I am very anxious and preoccupied with future planning, while she is much more go-with-the-flow, spontaneous, whatever happens, happens. She keeps her room pretty messy, while I'm more organized.   We really balance each other very well. For 2 types that seem so similar, we're very different people, but in the best way.

An Infp will base almost all desicions on weather or not they fit their value system while an Infj will use other basises.  An Infj is also more likely to care about making people comfortable in a group setting. An Infp may also care about this, but only because it fits THEIR value system.  Infjs also tend to be more in the moment than infps and are more future oriented whole infps will look back with a great sense of nostalgia.  Ultimately, it's not a big deal what type you are. Many people, including myself who was sure of I was intp or infp, call somewhere in between. You are a beautifully complex creature.

mbti,3bitz8,TrantaLocked,5,Mon Jun 29 16:08:49 2015 UTC,"I put huge effort into putting people on 'scales' for certain qualities. For example for social intro/extraversion, which worked well, and for logical/emotional mindedness, which was terrible (they're aren't opposites, it was entirely incorrect).  MBTI is far more structured than anything I could have come up with myself."
mbti,3bitz8,apocalypsedg,2,Mon Jun 29 16:36:05 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Did you ever have actual thoughts of the possibility of there being brain types that are persistent in the gene pool as suggested by Jung and MBTI? This is the thing I would never have thought of.  And back to the scales. How did those scales line up with the types you gave individuals after learning MBTI? Did you see patterns, like ""people in the center of this scale usually ended up being this orientation of intuitive in MBTI""?"
mbti,3bitz8,apocalypsedg,3,Mon Jun 29 16:43:02 2015 UTC,"I'm obviously no neuroscientist, and have only just heard about 'Brain Typing'. Right now Brain Typing seems dubious to me.  Extending what Briggs, Myers and Jung theorised about personality to claim there exist precisely 16 distinct brain types is pseudoscience. I think MBTI works because a person's preference of Jungian cognitive functions is ordered, so everyone is forced into a certain type, i.e. you can't not have an MBTI. Now, you may have a very close to equal preference of cognitive functions so your MBTI may be less accurate, but you will have to fall into a type. Brain Typing reasons backwards, starting of with a claim there are 16 types and a brain type will exactly match one of these. It also neglects environmental influences and the fact that people with a completely different brain can have the same behaviour.  As for the scales, MBTI is far more specific so I can't really type anyone but close friends and family. There are certainly nowhere near enough people I can type to start seeing patterns!"

It's been a few years since I've been a promiscuous young laddie, but from what I recall of my many encounters, it's more about whether or not their perceiving function is introverted or extroverted.  For example, Ti Ne has extroverted perception, yet an introverted primary function and the INTPs I've dealt with are pretty much like me when it comes to doing the dirty:    it is more about sharing the experience together   Another counter-intuitive example: Fe Si would seem to be a share-y sexual partner, but my ESFJ experiences indicate the opposite.  They're pretty wrapped up in their own experience, despite Fe.  Note: I learned about the theory of intelligence as my promiscuity was waning, so my typing is in hindsight and may be wrong."

Like last night, I went on a rather impromptu late night date and towards the end got the kiss I was coveting the whole night. My happiness/excitement was peaking. There was no reason or desire to think anything about it internally except that it felt pretty fucking good. Alternatively, when I'm pleasuring someone, my focus is on pushing all the right buttons to turn them on as much as possible. If a partner isn't turned on or is unable to stay turned on then I never ever blame myself, I blame it on the partners sad inability to stay in the moment and fully enjoy it.

mbti,3bihxl,nulloid,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:18:37 2015 UTC,"I'd have to read descriptions of other types to see:   which one fits me best and  more importantly, in which context.   As far as this SE type goes, I think it describes about 50% of me. The 'fun' side of me which comes out with friends, dates, family members whose company I enjoy, and with coworkers (only during happy hour or weekend meets).  For example: I do like to ""experience physical things"" when it comes to sex since it's so utterly enjoyable physically. It's raw pleasure and yes it certainly makes me tick. But I wouldn't say experiencing physical things is the only thing that makes me tick.  I feel amazing after making a list of tasks I want to accomplish at work and then go through each one as the day progresses feeling bits of happiness upon their completion but the true source of contentment is in the realization of the entire lists existence and my continual work to execute it. I feel phenomenal after a few hours of deep cleaning even though those things are not very enjoyable physically. They make me tick because inside, I think and reflect on what I want to accomplish, setting goals, and then going out and achieving them leaving me feeling happy and fulfilled.  Example # 2: In my professional life, I'm certainly not just living in the present. Recently, I got an offer to lead a big project as project manager at one of the biggest corps in the country, but I declined it even though they were offering me 33% (a considerable hike) more than what I currently make. In the moment, it seemed like a good decision but two years down the line, it would be poor since my vision is to be a software solutions architect and those two years can be spent designing and implementing solutions as tech lead (my current position) to gain more insights into what it takes to build good software rather than learning the ins and outs of how to manage a team of socially awkward engineers (which I already know how to do thanks to my take-charge nature in social settings)."
mbti,3bihxl,faytzylox,3,Tue Jun 30 10:23:31 2015 UTC,"Huh... I might have misjudged you.  Let me try to explain them here. I don't know how accurate these are, but by trying to explain them, I can refine my own understanding about them. For the sake of accuracy, I add that if you google ""cognitive functions"", you can find lots of informations, for exampple this one. Also, their order is important, and there is one description about them here.  Redditors, who know their shit and read this, please, point out my mistakes, so I can learn from them, and fix this glossary. Thank you.  With that being said, let's get started.    NOTE: I'm taking advantage of archetypes and generalization here for the sake of making a point. Keep that in mind, and adjust your perception of things written here accordingly.  Well, what you wrote - making lists, setting goals, taking charge - are signs of extroverted Thinking (Te). It handles things like setting a goal, breaking it into steps, and measuring progress towards said goal. ENTJs (Te-Ni) and ESTJs (Te-Si) are two types that use this as their primary function. They like to take charge, ENTJs are the CEO-type of people, and ESTJs are like those with hardhats on a construction site.  Its introverted cousin, interoverted Thinking (Ti) is responsible for taking things and concepts apart mentally, analyzing its structure and working, and checking for inner consistency. ISTPs (Ti-Se) are stereotypical car engineers, for example. INTPs (Ti-Ne) are engineers of ideas - Einstein, for example.  Introverted iNtuition (Ni) is like having an orb that can tell the future. It gathers data, and condenses them into one understanding. Ni-doms like INTJs (Ni-Te) and INFJs (Ni-Fe) usually have a clear vision about a change they'd like to see in the world. If you saw Breaking Bad - Walter White is the prime example of an INTJ. Unfortunately I can't give a good example for INFJs, but they are like a warm-n-fuzzy INTJ. I would say INFJs embody the psychologist archetype.  Extroverted iNtuition (Ne) - its all about brainstorming, making connections between ideas, and seeking novelty. ENTPs (Ne-Ti) and ENFPs (Ne-Fi) use this very much. ENFPs are those dreamy social butterflies, who are always full of big ideas. ENTPs are those annoying assholes, who really like to argue just about anything. They are quick, witty, they like to invent things.  Introverted Feeling (Fi) - just like Introverted Thinking, but instead of concepts, it works with belief systems, values, and feelings. Fi-doms usually can tell if somebody is not true to themselves, like Ti-doms can tell if a concept won't work. INFPs (Fi-Ne) and ISFPs (Fi-Se) are the types who is this the most. They are usually artistic, mellow, and kind.  Extroverted Feeling (Fe) is like Extroverted Thinking, but it works on social goals. It wants to make people get along with each other. ENFJs (Fe-Ni) and ESFJs (Fe-Si) use it very much. ENFJ is like the cult leader - this type has mastered the art of emotional manipulation. ESFJs are the grandmother types, they like to make others happy.  Extroverted Sensing (Se) - we already covered this one. Sensations, hedonism, being in the moment. ESFPs (Se-Fi) are the prom queens you wanted to hook up with in high school, and ESTPs are the charismatic, ""Let's do it!""-kind of people who could always cheer you up with a beer.  Intrvoerted Sensing (Si) - it is all about memories, impressions, details. It's like a database in your head. Si-doms, like ISTJs (Si-Te) and ISFJs (Si-Fe) are good with things that require attention to details. ISTJs are the quiet and diligent office workers, while ISFJs are like mothers - they have a sense of obligation to their family or other social group they belong to."
mbti,3bihxl,nulloid,2,Tue Jun 30 18:16:54 2015 UTC,"Whoa. Thank you! That's a lot of things! Ok, so I think I have a fair idea of where I stand based on your descriptions. ESFP/ESTP when it comes to having fun, ENTJ/ISTJ when it comes to work especially organizing classes and designing sub components, and ISFJ when it comes to chores/helping ppl/decorating/cleaning et cetera cause I am absolutely anal about attention to detail. It drives my brother (housemate) crazy. That covers 5 of them. 11 more to go!"
mbti,3bihxl,faytzylox,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:18:36 2015 UTC,"Actually, this is not how it works. It's true, that everyone uses all 8 functions, however most people have a set of 4 functions serving them most of the times. 80% of their time the dominant and secondary functions take the lead. The tertiary and inferior are more problematic, and they won't develop until later in life.  So for example, an ESTJ has Te-Si-Ne-Fi. That means he is a good planner (Te), attentive to details (Si), has some capacity for brainstorming, but it doesn't compare to - say - an ENFP's talent for it (Ne-Fi-Te-Si), and usually keeps his feelings for himself. Also, an INFP (Fi-Ne-Si-Te) has Te as their last function, so a lot of them have problems with planning, thinking things through, and reasoning (breaking down a logical problem to steps), but Ne - as a secondary function - is much more developed, so an INFP easily beats an ESTJ in creativity, for example.  These four functions seldom change. Based on what you wrote, I would say you are a Si-Te user (or Te-Si), so xSTJ. But instead of guessing, I would recommend 25quiz, and if you post here the results, I can say more."
mbti,3bihxl,nulloid,0,Wed Jul 1 07:25:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not most people. My goal is to be the best at whatever I do so if I'm doing the MBTI, I wanna be all of them! I don't care if people think I can't because all that matters is if I think I can. I started taking your quiz but quit early on because of its dichotomous nature. For e.g. I think people should consider facts and figures when forming an opinion and they should consider other people's feeling when expressing that opinion. I'm not going to pick one over the other because I give both equal importance as they deserve."
mbti,3bihxl,faytzylox,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:21:09 2015 UTC,"so if I'm doing the MBTI, I wanna be all of them!   Either you don't recognize your own limits, or your brain is worthy of thorough study. My bet is on the former.   I started taking your quiz but quit early on because of its dichotomous nature.   There is a ""Skip this question"" button. Btw I found this quiz much more precise than all the other quizzes I came across.   I'm not going to pick one over the other because I give both equal importance as they deserve.   That means you have both corresponding functions developed to about the same extent. Most literatures say you can be exactly one type, with its corresponding functions - however, I think people can ""change types"" throughout the day, if they have their corresponding functional requirements met. For example, if you have Highly developed Fi and Ti, a moderately developed Ne and Si, you can act either as an INTP (Ti-Ne-Si-Fe) or an INFP (Fi-Ne-Si-Te), depending on the circumstances. This is why quizzes who say ""You are 90% I and 10% E, 45% S and 55% N"" are lame - you need to know your functions. (And I think this is the reason behind most of the ""Help me, I'm an ENTJ or an ENFJ??!?!?"" type of questions.)  Noone has enough time in their life to ""max out"" all 8 functions. One can try, but it is usually a one-way ticket to psychiatry. I wish you the best!"
mbti,3bihxl,nulloid,0,Wed Jul 1 17:03:34 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much garbage, and isn't excused by the ""note"". If you want others to correct your understanding, stop relying on the stereotypical  behavioural generalizations...especially when you're explaining ""functions""."

I don't really know how to explain it. It doesn't seem to differ with things like Fi or Fe either. I guess for an introvert their default setting is internally focused, so we have a similar relationship to physical things, people, their surroundings, etc. Same with extroverts, they're more externally focused so they would be more geared towards getting their partner out of their head."
mbti,3bihxl,Dahmer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:59:40 2015 UTC,"I've had about equal parts of both and prefer the introverts. It's like they have a better intuitive understanding (both sensors and intuitives) of me (INTP) and what I want. I sometimes speculate that it's because introverts are used to being observers and might pick and consider sexual undertones of a situation more in-depth, rather than extroverts who also pick them up but instead of processing it in their own minds just act on these bolts of tension immidiately.   I find that many extroverts, regardless of them being TJs, SPs, etc, expect the sex to be quite verbal and they want alot of encouragement and want to hear adjectives in general. Sometimes that's hard. I certainly don't like complete silence, but it's not supposed to be an episode of Rikki Lake either. ""Are you not into it?"" is a common phrase when dealing with an extrovert in bed as an introvert. Yes I am into it, but can we just relax and enjoy it both ways? I need another type of energy in me to express myself constantly. During sex my focus is on the inner sensations in both my body and mind, and trying to connect with the other person without verbal communication. IF possible."

mbti,3bhmfk,PM_your_fridge,15,Mon Jun 29 08:05:56 2015 UTC,Judger =/= Organized.  Perceiver =/= Unorganized.  An INTP technically has a judging function as their dominant function (Ti).
mbti,3bhmfk,Kafke,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:03:15 2015 UTC,"Well, even though INTPs are judging function dominants, they are still perceptive to the outside. How would you define judger and perceiver, if it has nothing to do with organization?"
mbti,3bhmfk,Kafke,10,Mon Jun 29 09:14:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's entirely irrelevant. Judging/Perceiving don't really 'mean' anything on their own.  Judging functions deal with decision making, and perceiving functions deal with information gathering and usage. You need both to function as a human being.  In terms of the discussion, the ""Judging=Organized"" stereotype usually stems from SJs, who's characteristic trait is Si: a function that typically involves tradition and routine. If you go with STJs, you then get Te/Si, which is pretty much the ultimate ""organizer"" combo, at least in terms of stereotypes. Te likes decided/deduced structure externally, and Si likes tradition/routine/same-ness, which is why these types are so commonly 'organized' and structured, in the traditional sense.  That isn't to say they can't be organized, but that's why the stereotype is what it is for those types. SJs all have something a bit similar, which nets them the 'organized people' stereotype, and then J's in particular maintain that trope. But it's worth noting many ""J"" types aren't organized, simply because that's not how their functions go, nor do they care about being organized.  Typically the Ti types (xxTP) tend to have an internalized structure (as opposed to the Te's external). that isn't to say they aren't organized, but that they view organization itself differently. Most xxTPs will tell you that ""It's an organized mess!"" because the structure of the system is internal to them, rather than externally apparent. Other types with Ti should also demonstrate this trait. Depending on what other functions you pair up, you'll get different outcomes.  Personally, as an ISTP I've always considered myself 'organized'. I just can't do ""traditional"" organization very well. But I do tend to group things together that are visually similar: my clothes are organized by type (shirts | pants | etc), for instance.  It's not so much whether or not they do organize, but how they organize.  And again, not all people may care about organization.  Ultimately I think the ""perceiver/judger"" dichotomy is stupid. It's just there to introduce stereotypes and falsities to the typing system, implying someone can or can't do something depending on their type.  As far as perceiving functions and judging functions go in the stack, types with dominant perceiving are more likely to observe before deciding, while dominant judging types are more likely to decide before observing (look before you leap vs leap before you look, really). It's a matter of priorities.  Pinning down particular actions or behaviors to a specific type is the wrong way of going about things."
mbti,3bhmfk,kalg,2,Mon Jun 29 09:41:54 2015 UTC,"So basically, what you're saying is that the functions justify the letters, and not the other way around. i.e. a person can be categorized as a perceiver even though he's organized, because it is apparent that he has Ti and not Te.    Pinning down particular actions or behaviors to a specific type is the wrong way of going about things.   Well, that's what you're doing with SJs in the second paragraph, and I do think that pinning specific actions and behaviors to specific types is necessary, if we are to make any sense of the whole system. Overblown stereotypes are obviously bad, but I think that it's necessary to set boarders that differentiate the type from one another. I agree with you that the essential difference in the J/P-dichotomy is whether you organize internally or externally, to put it in a general sense."
mbti,3bhmfk,rzwerzdsb,7,Mon Jun 29 10:08:12 2015 UTC,"Like /u/Kafke said, not all Js are organized and not all Ps are disorganized. My parents are ISTJ and INFP, but it's the INFP (dad) that needs the house clean and straightened to be happy and relaxed, while the ISTJ (mom) is much more laid-back and uncaring about it. Te/Fe organize the external world, but only where it's personally important.  Keep in mind that everyone has an extroverted Judging function. It is possible for anyone, regardless of P or J-type, to use that function to organize their world. You can't take any one behavior and extrapolate type - you need to see how that behavior fits with that person as a whole. To use my parents again, my father caring about the organization, presentation, and cleanliness of his house is a manifestation of Te, but it does not mean he is a Judger. His Te is his 4th place function, and it works with Fi to make his surroundings support an inner calm. My mother's relative disorganization similarly does not mean that she doesn't have Te. In this particular instance it is more reflective of very low Se - she really doesn't notice her physical surroundings much, so they aren't very important to her.  Back to your initial question, though. Yes, P types can become organized later in life. It will come by developing their 3rd or 4th function (Te or Fe), but it will still be guided by the more dominant functions (Fi or Ti)."
mbti,3bhmfk,kalg,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:33:17 2015 UTC,"In this particular instance it is more reflective of very low Se - she really doesn't notice her physical surroundings much, so they aren't very important to her.   this sounds really odd to me. I think she just doesn't care. I don't think this has anything to do with low Se at all.  I think the reason why an ISTJ might not care about the order of a room is because it's simply not relevant to the ISTJ. Like a room only has to fulfill a practical purpose and nothing else.  for example take a simple living room with a TV and a couch; now the only purpose this room has to fulfill is give access to the couch and TV via a path and that's it. There could be shit (not literally of course) lying around everywhere as long as it fulfills this practical purpose. It has nothing to do with having low Se.   Yes, P types can become organized later in life. It will come by developing their 3rd or 4th function (Te or Fe), but it will still be guided by the more dominant functions (Fi or Ti).   I don't think so. I think it's not necessary for a P-type to develop their 3rd or 4th function to be orderly. I think you just need to care about things being orderly which anyone can do. Like I could see an INFP being very orderly due to Fi Morals that they acquired but instead of using Te to implement their order they just use Fi+Ne as an example a Te mind would probably do cleaning up very sequential but this isn't really necessary you can also clean your house in an Ne way and jump around from one room to the next only cleaning a part and then coming back to it etc no need to do it sequential really as long as it gets all clean somehow and Fi is an organizational function after all so no reason why it couldn't order something.  TLDR; I think being orderly is based purely on morals and that's all, also I think it doesn't matter how you implement this order and I don't think you need to use any particular function to do so."
mbti,3bhmfk,Kafke,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:17:52 2015 UTC,"I think she just doesn't care.   She doesn't, much. But she also doesn't notice. The two are linked, and for this particular ISTJ, I think it's the not-noticing that fuels the not-caring more than the other way around, mostly because she is more than normally oblivious to her physical surroundings. That seems Se-related to me, though I could be wrong.  You seem to be saying that you don't need to use any particular function in order to keep a house clean. Well, okay, but something has to make you want to. It could be a self-imposed rule (Te), that having a clean house is the moral, upright thing to do. It could be because it makes your family and guests comfortable in your house and that mess makes you look bad (Fe). It could be so that you can find your stuff when you need it (Ti). Or it could be because a chaotic house make you feel an internal turmoil (Fi). Telling a Ti or Fi dom that they should have an orderly house because it's the moral thing to do won't have much of an effect on their behavior, because that argument doesn't speak to their motivations.  As for why the only neat INFP I know is so neat, it seems more like an internal need for orderliness than morals. The best I understand it is that he feels like his home is a reflection of his psyche - if it is a mess, he feels chaotic, if it is dirty, he feels worthless, and if it is ugly, he feels unimportant. The actual process of keeping things clean looks very much like Te (things have to be a certain way; it must be done like this) following the demands of Fi (""I feel shitty - fix it!"" vs ""cleaning is done on saturdays""). When he's given advice on maintaining an organized house, he's mentioned that it wasn't until into his 30s that he was able to consistently keep a routine of regular cleaning and maintenance, which is in line with developing Te with age.  While any one person of any type can be orderly or not, there are variations between the types that is clearly function-related. P-doms are more likely to keep disorganized living environments, while J-doms are more likely to be organized. Chalking that up to 'morals' seems to be missing something."
mbti,3bhmfk,Kafke,5,Wed Jul 1 03:51:40 2015 UTC,"So basically, what you're saying is that the functions justify the letters, and not the other way around.   Correct. The letters actually don't line up with any particular personality trait of the type.   i.e. a person can be categorized as a perceiver even though he's organized, because it is apparent that he has Ti and not Te.   Yup. In the strictest definition, P/J in the lettering simply means whether your perceiving or judging function is extroverted. AKA, what you 'appear' as. ISTP's extrovert Sensing, and INTPs extrovert intuition; both are perceiving functions that are extroverted.  IMO, not much can really be drawn from knowing whether someone is a ""P"" or ""J"".   Well, that's what you're doing with SJs in the second paragraph, and I do think that pinning specific actions and behaviors to specific types is necessary, if we are to make any sense of the whole system.    With the SJs I was indeed running with stereotypes. Naturally it's not necessarily the case that a particular type fit the stereotype, but stereotypes do exist for a reason. And mostly I was using it as a demonstration as well as an explanation for why ""J"" is correlated with ""organization"".  It's kind of like how ""N"" was seemingly randomly lumped with ""smart people"". Which, again, seems arbitrary (or perhaps biased) until you do some digging and realize why this stereotype became a thing."
mbti,3bhmfk,Komatik,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:31:15 2015 UTC,"All right, I think that we have come to an understanding that the functions justify the letters. Would you also agree that a person can have auxiliary Te, even though he's been disorganized in an external sense, if he has an urge to organize externally but hasn't been able to? In short, do you agree that our motivations justify our functions, instead of our previous behaviour justifying our functions. In other words, is it a question of innate character or of experiance?"

Certainly.   In short, do you agree that our motivations justify our functions, instead of our previous behaviour justifying our functions.

The problem was that it didn't describe how I was prone to think. A functional stack with Te and Fi however does.   In short, do you agree that our motivations justify our functions, instead of our previous behaviour justifying our functions. In other words, is it a question of innate character or of experiance?   It is not even about motivation. It is habits of taking in, evaluating and organizing information that functional typology is concerned with.  These tendencies of dealing with information and thinking habits are quite ingrained so yes, it is about innate character, just from an angle that isn't motivation."

One situation, theory as a guide to get to another situation.  A Ti type's focus is on that theory, on the model for how things work. The rules of how the cogs turn are more important than what the turning accomplishes."

To a point. What is actually afoot is that there are two ways to get a type code - the dichotomatic four-scale approach and the function stack approach. They measure different things, but give you the same type code because they share history.  What this means is that if you test and the test says you're, say, ENTP, the meaning of the code is different than if you figure out someone uses Ne-Ti-Fe-Si as their functions and use ENTP as shorthand for that.  The dichotomatic type is more heavily behavioristic so it's less stable. Most of the people on the subreddit prefer the functional approach because of that - it's more stable and nuanced than the dichotomatic one. If kept separate, both the four scales approach and the functional approach can tell you useful things about yourself. Just don't confuse the two.

I bring it up so you can understand what I mean when I say that I cannot bring myself to care about organizing my surroundings. I have the ability to do it, I have the time, and I think it would be a good thing for me to do, but I'll be damned if I can convince myself to bother with it.

For example, if someone were  to clean off my desk and move everything to make it what they believe is more organized I would probably freak out. I'd lose my control over the situation and inevitably have this cathartic freak out. The first thing I would do is try to locate everything and I might even endeavor to begin migrating it back to where it falls naturally.

mbti,3bf5bk,--treandoge--,2,Sun Jun 28 18:12:24 2015 UTC,Dominant function and tertiary function supposedly get caught in a feedback loop because the auxiliary function doesn't intervene. So an INTP would have a Ti+Si loop that can be broken by Ne use.

Supposedly it's easy to sink into such a state because the tertiary operates in the same space as the dominant - for an introvert, we live our lives inside our heads, it's where we're comfortable, so slipping into living only there is lucratively easy. Sadly it tends to get a person stuck in a mental rut and just not feeling well because our brains are wired to crave a diet of stuff that simulates both the dominant and the auxiliary. Tert+Inferior stuff is more akin to spices, some extra bonus nutrients and a bit of candy, not the steak, potatoes and salad. A loop would be akin to eating the steak and some candy without the salad."
mbti,3bf5bk,glabius,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:08:31 2015 UTC,"Do you think the opposite could be true as well? For example if the same INTP recognizes that they are in unhealthy rut and attempt break out of that rut, perhaps by over compensating by doing the opposite, by focusing on Ne-Fe behavior?  In my own experience, I've had periods that I'd say roughly fit into the Ti-Si loop. Usually this is not out of weakness necessarily, but due to circumstance like becoming stagnant in a situation or after a inexplicable setback, like an unexpected breakup.  The former is like a long term existential sort of rut, while the latter is more of trying to process what just happened kind of loop.  Either way Ne seems to be absent because there is either no new stimulus available or new stimulus would distract me from the task at hand, which is figuring out how this happened by searching my experience for clues that may explain how I arrived at this new situation.    In either case, I've found that I'm usually compelled to hit hard in the opposite direction with new wind in my sails.  I throw myself back out in the world.  Try new approaches to life, make major changes like moving across country or a career change, and focus more on being social than being introverted.  In other words, I will move from an INTP Domtert loop for seeking and ENTP domtert loop to over compensate. I've since learned that this back and forth isn't worth pursuing, but my question is, is this something that is expected or observed in MBTI or is this just coincidence?  A lot of MBTI and the like seem to be about balance and counter-balance, so to me this seems to make total sense, but haven't come across any discussion of the corollary to Domtert behavior, if there is such a thing.

mbti,3bdd2c,MonsieurGadfly,3,Mon Jun 29 06:58:02 2015 UTC,I dated a girl that claimed to be an intj. Never met another intj irl that i Knew of so i dont know. She didnt seem to operate the way i do at all and she had issues. I dont think ahe was actually an intj and i also dont think the type dictates your peronality. Her upbringing and childhood traumas or lack thereof do so more.

mbti,3bdd2c,seaweedmustache,2,Sun Jun 28 14:41:53 2015 UTC,easily distracted combined with a ton of emotional swings seems more ENFPish to me

mbti,3bdd2c,seaweedmustache,0,Sun Jun 28 23:34:51 2015 UTC,"sometimes enneagram (if you are familiar, and everyone should be!) can be useful for distinguishing the two: ENFPs are mainly 7s, 3s, and 4w3 and INFPs are mainly 4w5 and 9."
mbti,3bdd2c,bezald,2,Sun Jun 28 23:40:00 2015 UTC,"Hmm. This is actually interesting from the perspective that I just recently took the test and got a 7 myself. And I know that I've only really scratched the surface to understanding the enneagram system better but maybe that in and of itself is something partially lending to my possible confusion?  Either way, thanks for the tip, mate!"
mbti,3bdd2c,seaweedmustache,0,Mon Jun 29 02:15:54 2015 UTC,"oh weird, yeah, enneagram 7 is an inherently extroverted type (it even says it first off in the enneagram institute description). https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-7  if you're a 7 then you're probably/definitely an ENFP.  ENFPs sooo often (understandably) confuse themselves for INFPs because they're the most introverted extrovert, have vast inner worlds, need to recharge not infrequently etc. but yeah, dom-Fi isn't compatible with enneagram 7--the enneagram type is externally focused. ENFPs tend to be overall more energetic and idea-oriented and less one-note and melancholic all the time. ENFPs tend to change worldviews/try ideas on and seek new experiences more frequency. INFPs have more of a stagnant, grounded energy. INFPs are more likely to leave a party early.  INFPs are probably the most introverted type (very very introverted) and ENFPs are kinda ambiverts"
mbti,3bdd2c,bezald,2,Mon Jun 29 02:31:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Interesting food for thought. The only problem is that the gulf between my Fi-Te always seemed much larger than the ENFPs I knew.   then again... I also am pretty ambiverted. Need time with people and friends but also a fair amount of alone time and can sometimes go into complete recluse mode...AND then again often felt that I dealt with the dreaded Fi-Si loop of getting caught between my own value system and what I should be.  Sorry... Totally didnt mean to turn this into one of those ""type me"" posts. But you've brought up a kind of personal game changer. basically what you're suggesting is...either im actually an ENFP with some soul searching to do or an INFP with some enneagram searching to do. Hmm. Guess nows as good a time as any!"
mbti,3bdd2c,seaweedmustache,2,Mon Jun 29 02:46:39 2015 UTC,"I hope you don't mind, but just from your comment history I get a really strong Ne energy and you seem very ENFP to me. More of a scattered, exuberant, inventive energy versus an INFP grounded one.  Take a look at the 7 description. If it fits well, I think it's safe to say you're an ENFP.  Haha no worries, I like helping people type themselves :). ENFP/INFP is definitely a tricky one because of ENFP ambiversion."
mbti,3bdd2c,bezald,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:48:16 2015 UTC,"Do you enjoy partying? When you go to a party, do you often leave early or are you the last to leave?  With regard to the Fi-Te gulf, I think different ENFPs will have differently developed Te. I would mainly focus on the first two functions and how they manifest. With typing it's easy to miss the forest for the trees :)"
mbti,3bdd2c,bezald,2,Mon Jun 29 02:51:44 2015 UTC,"Hmm. If we go to someone elses house it's like 60-40 last to leave...but usually we (intj bf and I) just host the dang thing at our place.

mbti,3bdd2c,bezald,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:05:32 2015 UTC,"Not so far. I think ENFP are magnets for other ENFPs.   Over on our sub we formed a chat community (some other types have joined too) and its the most enjoyable group I've ever been in. Perfect mix of philosophical talks and lighthearted fun. Lots of us are becoming actual friends from it. I think finding other people of my type has been one of the most positive social experiences I've had, to be honest."
mbti,3bdd2c,burrit0z,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:51:48 2015 UTC,"I've met three other INTJs. I get along fine with all 3 of them. We had nothing really in common, so it doesnt take off as far as my friendships with other types. I didn't have anything in common with them, so its hard to have a good or bad experience.   What i find is that INTJs have their 'own thing' going on - you either fit in, or are neutral to them."
mbti,3bd9cj,Splinoself,3,Sun Jun 28 03:09:57 2015 UTC,"A lot of how these functions act comes across in basic communication and problem solving. Of course, each function accomplishes this differently. For example:   Te demands x problem to be solved now, but Ti needs to understand the problem at its root before committing to any solution. Ni sees a result long before it happens whenever it reads into the relevant trends while Ne is playing hopscotch with every idea, theme, and meaning it can muster.   Edit: hotlinked another article into the post and made the main entry less bulky."
mbti,3bd9cj,aNinjaWithAIDS,2,Sun Jun 28 06:44:03 2015 UTC,"The difference between the functions is more in the way they accomplish things than any specific activities like that.  Few actions are the specific domain of one function or type, and anyone can do something sometimes. Type is more about people's tendencies than anything else - what and how they tend to take in, and so on."
mbti,3bd9cj,Komatik,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:19:59 2015 UTC,"The perceiving functions are Se, Si, Ne and Ni. The extroverted perceiving functions deal with the outside world directly, while Si and Ni use a more personal touch. For example, an Se user might notice that their monitor is very bright while reading this post. An Si user would read this post and remember how their functions act in certain situations. An Ne user would go off on a tangent and question the correlation between cognitive functions and mathematical functions. An Ni user would....eh...do whatever I did. I forgot. :)  Now onto the judging functions, these are the ones that make decisions and act on them. Te would delve straight into writing a response based on what is presented to them, I was so eager that my dominant Te function didn't even bother reading the question!...sorry. Fe would want to help you understand and would probably get stuck into writing a response pretty fast. Fi would start wondering what their functions mean to them...I found myself reflecting like this while writing this. This is going to put an individual spin on their response. An Fi dominant might also use an anecdote in their response. Ti is a hard one to explain since I don't really use it. Ti would sit for a second and think about what each of the functions do before writing, a Ti dominant would go into their response with a clear plan.   I hope that helps you get a general idea of the functions."
mbti,3bd9cj,--treandoge--,2,Mon Jun 29 22:36:03 2015 UTC,"This is the most helpful thing anyone has said to me in all of my inquiries about the functions. You didn't even use vague abstract words or make ones up, which is very popular when describing the functions. Maybe that works for other people but I just don't get it.  Oh also! based on this, which makes more sense to me than anything else anyones written, I think Im definitely using Si, definitely not using Ne, which I had previously thought was what I used. I'm also definitely not Fi, and Fe is working for me, as is Te, so I think some combination of Si, Ni, Te, and Fe.   EDIT: Just realized that Si, Ni, Te, Fe is impossible. back to the drawing board I guess, Im still confused."

This is not necessarily Ti Dom.   view the world through logic   Sounds like Ti Dom or Ti Aux.   make decisions with logic   Sounds like Te Dom or Te Aux.  Taken together, this seems to be more of ""I'm a smart and rational person"" than any indication of function stack or type."
mbti,3be1xn,MakhnoYouDidnt,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:01:23 2015 UTC,"Ok, I agree that I horribly phrased that sentence regarding Ti. I try to organize my thoughts to be orderly and structured and logical, but not necessarily the outer world like a Te dom/aux. I realize that that could sound like Fe vs Fi as well, but how I feel about things and my values aren't very high on the priority list. I decided not to give the reasons for why I believe that I am a Ti dom because I'm quite sure of this. The main reason I made this post was to focus on Ne. Sorry for not making this clear. My thoughts don't seem to be as bouncy and I don't feel like I'm as creative or intellectual as I should be to be called an INTP. I was trying to ask if what I described in the later paragraphs could be called Ne. I seem to identify with some elements of Ne, but not all of them."
mbti,3be1xn,MakhnoYouDidnt,0,Sun Jun 28 17:39:09 2015 UTC,"If you are certain that your dominant function is Ti (which seems odd, as Ti would be the most likely function to question your belief of what your dominant function is), then the only question really is Ne vs Se.   Neither of these will really concern your ""thoughts""(assuming ""thoughts"" relates to forming opinions/beliefs), so a lack of ""creativity or intellect"" in your thoughts seems less significant here.   P functions are more concerned with making observations, rather than creating thoughts/feelings about observations. Pe functions specifically concern how you observe the external world.   Do you predominantly see the world through a lens of abstract exploration, or through direct sensory input?"
mbti,3be1xn,MakhnoYouDidnt,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:55:41 2015 UTC,I guess I would be an INTP then since I see the world in the form of ideas instead of what things physically are. It's much easier for me to say why I don't think that I have Se than for me to say why I think I have Ne. I don't see the world in rich detail. I tend to ignore my environment and I'm usually thinking about something that has nothing to do with where I am.

It sound like you've done a lot of research into what your second function is, but if you suspect it's Ne, that's tough. I have a lot of trouble grokking Ne/Ni.   Something that helped me solidify my self-typing was to look at the 3rd and 4th functions. When you're younger, these often manifest themselves as personality flaws because they're underdeveloped. So I suggest you start by thinking really deeply about your flaws. How do you behave when you're upset about something? What do you do that annoys your friends and family? What behavior has gotten you in trouble?   Then, I recommend reading some analyses of the 3rd/4th function and see if they sound like you. Hopefully someone else's analysis can point you in the right direction. As a starting place, I really like the functional breakdowns written by someone named SimulatedWorld (not sure of the actual affiliation). You can find them just by googling a type and the name.

mbti,3be1xn,Keppy47,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:57:25 2015 UTC,"My problem lies more in thinking of whether I am a Ti or Fi user and I am often mistyped (or correctly typed?) as INFP. Sometimes I'm pretty sure I'm an INFP and INTP at the same time. It's a complicated thing.  Would just like to add - this is based on what I have read - that Ti is a function for INTPs that makes them want to be accurate and hence Ti will make them point out inconsistencies and sometimes miss the conclusion, or the point of the matter. It's not really about viewing the world and making decisions with logic (if I'm not mistaken), that's something that someone with Te can also do. People with Te as one of their main four functions want things to be proven and like evidence.   Also, are you the kind of person to take good care of your health because you know it's good for your body, expand your knowledge and give yourself as many options as possible (Ne)?   Unlike you I do enjoy thinking about really abstract shenanigans. I feel that it's an NT and NF thing, except the kind of abstract we're talking about may differ on many levels.

When I admit I was wrong (like yesterday), they mention it to each other, like it is a big deal. (It is* a big deal.)  (Not to mention I have a T with ""Jerk 01"" on it.)

mbti,3b9pdk,Chance_S2K,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:32:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for proving my point for me :)  Because in my experience (not saying this applies to all INTJs by any means) INTJs have problems listening to what other people say. As they are exhausted and confused by human social interactions, they frequently read their own interpretations of your identity into your words to such a degree that the meaning of your words is completely distorted.  For example: someone describes themselves as having been rendered homeless by INTJs and that they feel bitter about it. Some especially unhealthy INTJs will (intentionally or accidentally) misinterpret this statement, reading much more deeply into what you said than is reasonable--accusing you of lying, or having an agenda, typically in a sarcastic or aggressive tone. This would not be so problematic if the INTJ actually had a grip on the situation, and was correctly analyzing what was going on, but an INTJ who would do this in the first place probably has trouble empathizing and understanding other people already.  This is ""jerk"" behavior on its own, but its jerkiness is further amplified by the fact that the INTJ has no reason to feel defensive, as the INTJ was not involved in the original conversation and was not identified to any degree.  However, the ultimate pinnacle of jerkiness is when the INTJ in question has apparently been stalking their ex-housemate's Reddit account to such a degree that when the ex-housemate makes a post, the INTJ can comment back within an hour.  This, Reddit, is one of many previous experiences I have had that prompted me to put INTJ under #4. But ""Jerk"" is not the first word that I would actually use to describe most INTJs. ""Lonely"" is much better."
mbti,3b9pdk,pm_me_your_molars,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:38:32 2015 UTC,"You have your head stuck so far up your own ass it's pathetic.  Have problems feeling empathy? Both myself and my mother tried to give you every opportunity to have a good place in this house as a friend or even family member, but you consistently brushed all that away. Go back and look at any Facebook messages that we shared; They're all painfully one sided coming from my direction with no responses. The same can by said about texts. Add that to the fact that you started avoiding me around the house for months and it shouldn't be a surprise that I didn't want you here anymore. Every attempt I made at doing something for you was ignored. Even petty things like the phone bill and Netflix account started to become an annoyance just because you were never even remotely thankful or mentioned it. I didn't expect or want you to kiss ass, but it was more than that. You completely ignored and avoided me for months while you skulked around the house.  You also keep throwing around the word ""homeless"" extremely loosely. I should remind you that not once have you been even close to actually being homeless; Someone has always been there to catch you and to help you, but it's as if you're letting this sad sob story become your entire identity now and simply can't give it up anymore. The only reason you high tailed it out of the house the next day after I told you to look for a new place rather than use the 4 months that I gave you is because you're living for the drama now. You cry ""wolf"" at anything that has fucking fur on it. Hell, the entire time I was hoping that you'd actually try talking to me for once and would be able to stay in the house, but you never made even the slightest attempt.  Also, you're not the only one that goes on the MBTI/INTJ boards. I've started meditation/therapy for some stress related things on my own end and have been spending a lot more time on psych related subs like this lately.   Anyway, goodbye and good luck with whatever it is you do. I used to have much higher hopes and expectations for you."
mbti,3b9pdk,Chance_S2K,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:07:55 2015 UTC,"In your opinion, which one of you is that more people have problems with?  I'm asking because based on these comments, one of you have serious problems (the kind I had a few years ago). And that problem results in no communication, because of the misinterpretation of words from both sides. My limited experience tells that in these cases, the one with the problem usually has worse relationships with their friends than the other.  When I had this problem, I blamed my so-called family (I still do), but when I finally had the chance to live apart from them, my mental state started to take wild routes. Then I had the chance to live at my grandma for a few years. I was left alone for a year by the rest of my family, so I had time to reflect on myself, and found that all the problems my family gave me because of mistreatment (didn't understand my needs and my way of thinking) are poisoning my realitonships with others, and my life. Insufficient self-esteem was the biggest of them. So I started to work on it, and in the end, I was able to get out of my depression, and now I almost look like a healthy adult (if you squeeze your eyes a little and looking at me from sufficiently far away).  I might be wrong, but it seems to be such a situation in your case, too."

mbti,3b9ngs,Ennpitsu,9,Sat Jun 27 02:59:13 2015 UTC,"As John noted above, a big initial tell is that ISP types tend to be relatively terse with their communication - if you look at the stacks (Fi-Se-Ni-Te, Ti-Se-Ni-Fe) this makes sense: Fi and Ni are hard to communicate at best, Ti is a perfectionist when it comes to communication, wanting to express its ideas as concisely as possible while still communicating everything necessary, and Se is just not given to communicating with words in the first place. In fact, Ti+Se typically likes to demonstrate its Ti understanding of things by means of action, not explanation, which is what drives ISTPs to pursue mastery of an interesting topic.  The end result is that it can be hard to get two words out of an ISP.  The second one is that Se types and Ne types have a different air to them - this is most prominent in dominant users, where Se types have an intense, physical, present feel to them while Ne types appear light, bouncy and excited. Both give off a sense of energy, but it's a very different kind of energy. You can catch some of this from an auxiliary Se user especially, but auxiliary Ne types tend to be markedly more muted than Ne dominants. You can still see hints of it sometimes. Aux Ne types, INTPs especially, tend to like entertaining different perspectives on a thing for fun."
mbti,3b9ngs,Komatik,4,Sat Jun 27 09:42:12 2015 UTC,"Most INXPs I know are very sensitive to physicality in some way. The ethos for ""HSP"" really lines up with the INFP ethos, as do the idea of ""emotional triggers."" My mom, an INFP, couldn't handle rough housing or joke fighting between my brother and I. INTPs are often the stereotypical wimpy nerd. Will drop in a fight. Oversensitive about temperature. They might not grow up out of being a picky eater. Stuff like that. I've met many XNXPs who have specific words that actively bother them, my sister hated the word ""moist"" when she was a teenager.  ISXPs are also going to be sensitive, but it is going to be harder to understand what's causing the sensitivity. ISTPs might get super pissed at you for a really weird (or apparently nonexistent) reason, because their sensitivity lies in Ni, which is, of course, more abstract than Si (and distorted because it is in the tertiary position). I knew an ISFP teen who ran into a lot of social trouble because of this sensitivity combining with her inferior-Te (which often comes out as a Mean Girls-style bitchiness). Also, ISXPs have Se which means that they are more likely to retaliate when you ""trigger"" their sensitivity."
mbti,3b9ngs,WhatINeverSaid,2,Sat Jun 27 08:49:29 2015 UTC,I really hate that emotionally sensitive people have hijacked HSP. Since the people who use it that way generally aren't actually HSP.   ISTPs might get super pissed at you for a really weird (or apparently nonexistent) reason   :\

mbti,3b9ngs,WhatINeverSaid,4,Sat Jun 27 22:27:27 2015 UTC,Self expression comes more naturally for Ne than Ni users (Not communication necessarily but just getting your ideas out).   Obviously there's more but that's the first thing that comes to mind.

With that said, INTJ ""in the grip"" behavior of inferior Se (supposedly) manifests by making them more forceful, aggressive, vocal, and ""verbally violent"" with far less patience for things they consider ""wrong"" than the stereotypical icy demeanor. This is more or less what I have experienced for a majority of my youth, and is still present to lesser extent in bouts today caused by long-term stress that still hangs around.  If I may reference enneagram: the stats say that INTJs generally score 5w4 (Investigator with Individualist) or 5w6 (Investigator with Loyalist = Safety-minded imo). ENTJs on the other hand tend to lean towards 8 (Challenger).   Enneagram's purpose is to categorize the ""social relations"", ie. the individuals ""approach to the world"". The interpersonal relations apparent in INTJs who exhibit ""in the grip"" behavior seems to correlate with the enneagram type shown by ENTJs, 8 (the Challenger, willful, and confrontational) - which is often associated with extroverted judging types.  I will let my INTP partner know of this, and she will do all the hard work of breaking down which enneagram types correspond with every other type's ""in the grip behavior"" to perhaps find some sort of pattern."

I wouldn't call it approach as much as it is how you see it. What kind of subjective bias you have. I'm an INTJ and I'm an 8. I never mistook myself for an extrovert at any given point in my life. I also don't relate much to the grip theory and I personally think it's mostly bunk, since my natural demeanor is very Se-driven.   Also, there is no pattern in such a sense, because the pattern will be unique for each person depending on their cognitive preferences and their enneagram. The enneagram is about life motivations, not behavior."

Given that information, I am merely reporting an observed pattern that seems  to correlate with other topics. I do not claim its absolute validty in all cases - merely restricted to the data set I have to work with.  There are all kinds of people on the bell curve of likelihood, and I see no place in which I could have implied anything contrary. Cases that are less common will by definition exhibit behaviors deviating from the group norm - and thus cause error in metrics designed for said norm.   With no offense intended, anecdote is kind of irrelevant here. Fringe cases of single digits percentages exist. Exceptions, especially in psychology, by no means mean something is ""bunk"".

Sure, you ""passed"", but that is only because you can't fail a personality test.  The test fails you.  Tests are hardwired to test you in terms of very nuanced ideas in a cookie-cutter fashion. Furthermore, you have the test asking you definitive, gotcha like questions, when the way most people communicate is rather abstract.  For example:  rational and logical do not mean the same thing.  One of the prolific people on this sub pointed out this error to me when I described INTJs as rational.  They are actually logical.  Thinkers in general can use ration and logic adeptly, but one group will favor rationality over logic first and vice versa.  This is one example of how the prejudices of our language corrupt the tests.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.  When you get into Feeling, for example, things get more nuanced.

This is very much a matter of debate, however, as the following link I found looking for this definition will demonstrate:  http://personalitycafe.com/articles/39435-rational-versus-logical.html. I've found many interesting perspectives from this thread.  Namely, the idea of rational=subjective=introverted=deductive,(roughly) and logical=objective=extroverted=inductive.  It poses many interesting questions, which I will have to mull over.  I can see rational being a good description of introverted functions and to a lesser extent logical to describe extroverted functions.  I think this needs to be fleshed out more, but an interesting thought experiment, none-the-less.    I think that the take away from that thread proves my argument. There are many different interpretations on what very fundamental and commonly used terms like logical and rational actually mean.  There is widespread disagreement and confusion.  This is not a unique phenomenon.  Look at words like freedom and liberty.  They are bound together, inseparably, by most.  Ask someone what the difference is between the two?  Can you have freedom without liberty? Or vice versa?  Other examples are Irony is often used to describe things that are not ironic at all.  One of the definitions of literally is figuratively, which is the exact opposite.   My point is, since there is no MBTI authority proper like there is in organized sciences, the language that amateurs like myself can use can be varied.  For example, it was by convention that many terms were adopted in a scientific community.  The scientific community uses the word hypothesis, where as the colloquial says theory.  And so and so on."

You don't know enough about MBTI to know why that is a pointless question, but I won't hold it against you.  Again, J in the context of an MBTI type represents when the type uses a higher extroverted judging function.  Je is just used to represent Fe/Te in one package. Je isn't apart of an MBTI 4-letter type, it has a separate use.  The use is literally just to have a shorthand for discussion. Fe and Te are similar in that they are both extroverted judging functions, and Jx/Px make discussion slightly more dynamic.  It's also funny you say you wouldn't be embarrassed, as if it's ok to go around acting like you are right when you haven't learned the whole system. At least that's the vibe you let off continuing to argue for your own point as if you already understood MBTI.

Also functions in the same realm: extroverted/introverted with the same nature to them perceiving/judging are very similar. Ni/Si can be confused just by being irrational Pi, Fi with more objective/logical values can be can be confused with Ti. Ne's energy can be seen like Se. Fe can be just as commanding as Te."

Here's the description of the INTJ they give.    INTJs are global thinkers with original minds. Their Lead Intuition enables them to clearly see  connections, and to understand the long-range implications of current actions and events. Ingenious and innovative, INTJs have ""a unique talent for looking at almost anything and seeing how it can be improved. This is true of the smallest product or service or can involve envisioning how best to restructure and refine whole organizational systems. But, by far, their favorite subject for improvement is themselves. INTJs are on a constant quest to increase their knowledge and, by extension, their overall competence.  Creative and imaginative, INTJs are both intellectually curious and daring, even as they may be physically hesitant to try new things. Able to quickly grasp and analyze complex issues, INTJs are excellent strategic problem solvers, with highly developed critical thinking skills that allow them to perform incisive analyses. Constantly seeking new intellectual challenges, they set very high standards for themselves, and usually reach or exceed them.  However, because their Least function is Sensing, INTJs sometimes have difficulty operating in the real world. They tend to spend so much of their time and energy in the inner world of ideas and perceptions that they may be completely unaware of, or unconcerned with, the details of their physical surroundings. This can result in small consequences -such as bumping into the furniture or wearing mismatched socks -or large ones, such as failing to realistically assess the feasibility of a project because they are unaware of the cost of necessary resources. And sometimes, because they tend to be abstract and theoretical, they have trouble communicating clearly with people who are not as technically oriented, or being patient as they try to find common ground.  And because INTJs are most comfortable operating from an intellectual level, they are sometimes unaware of the emotional reactions or states of others. They may act in ways that are insensitive and neglectful of those close to them, and may need to be reminded to take time to appreciate and actively nurture those relationships. Perfectionists who set very high standards both for themselves and others, INTJs can be condescending and/or patronizing to those who fail to live up to their expectations, and parsimonious with their praise for those who do.  Given their powers of concentration, INTJs often prefer to work alone, or with a small group of equally competent colleagues. They are especially reticent to take the time and energy to explain themselves or their work to others they perceive to be less competent. Because they are so private, they are very difficult to get to know. They especially do not like to share their ideas or work until they feel it is perfect. Hard workers capable of persevering against great odds, INTJs have enviable focus and determination, and will not be deterred from reaching their goals. Their single-mindedness may come with a price, however, since it may result in their being stubborn and inflexible. And INTJs may have particular difficulty making transitions from one project to another. Usually, all it takes is an even more fascinating challenge to recapture their attention."

Any type that is angry which is causing them to behave in dickish way, is weak in my opinion. Too weak to deal with their own lives, so they put it on other people. Somewhat ironic.

mbti,3b5hyd,mmhmmyes,5,Fri Jun 26 03:23:30 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't really trust the test in the sense of taking it as your (stable) type. To explain it the long way:  There's two main ways to assign yourself a type / get yourself a type code.  The first is assigning yourself four letters by taking a test (or doing it yourself), the second figuring out what cognitive functions (~=go-to habits for taking in, evaluating and organizing information) you use. Both give you the same kind of code because the approaches have a lot of shared history, but the meaning behind the code is different because of how it's arrived at.   Using a test or otherwise looking into the four dichotomies to get a code and then look what kind of functions you're supposed to use from that is usually a bad idea (for example, I often get IxTP results from tests - this would mean I use Ti, which I don't - I'm a very clear Te type). Despite being different, both of these approaches give you valuable information but should be kept separate because they mean very, very different things.  The tests / dichotomatic approach ranks you on four different scales that are more or less separate from each other - ie. your score on one shouldn't influence your score on the others much at all. Having only a slight preference here is normal, and pretty much expected. The test results tend to fluctuate a good bit as well, especially so if you have only mild preferences one way or another - mood, the day, the alignment of the stars and whether your cat clawed your eyes out in the morning all become a large influence in your responses.  What the test letters mean, roughly: I/E = introverted/extroverted. Do you like being out and about, esp. around people. N/S = Abstract-minded or concrete person. F/T = Do you reason more on sentiment and good/bad type of judgment or in a cold, detached way. The F items put a good deal of weight on being accomodating (ie. something the functions approach would term extroverted Feeling, Fe) P/J = How organized, scheduled, conscientious you are. The more P, the more disorganized and spontaneous, the more J, the more organized and planned.      If looking at this, it makes sense how eg. getting a job would make you seem more J - and by the test's measure, you are, and the results of the dichotomatic test actually told you something useful about yourself. But I wouldn't use them to assign yourself a functional type.  To explain that better, let's look at the other way to get a type code: figuring out what functions you use.  The functional approach is a rough model that tries to explain how you take in, evaluate and organize information by dividing the information processing into four core processes (Thinking, Feeling, Sensing and iNtuition) each of which has two attitudes (ie. extraversion, or interest in the external world, and introversion, ie. interest in what is going on inside your head) and then figuring out which processes you use in what attitudes. They're often shortened to a function code of Core process and Attitude, ie. Sensing in the extroverted attitude = Se.  Two examples would be an inclination to use the Thinking function focusing more on personal models, their accuracy and looking for root causes (introverted Thinking, Ti) or the state of the outside world or analyzed system, exerting control over it and making the most of what you have (extroverted Thinking, Te), or using Feeling to focus more on the harmony of the group and people's expressions of sentiment (extroverted Feeling, Fe) or on being true to yourself and looking at the motivations behind expressions of sentiment (introverted Feeling, Fi).  To contrast why it's important to focus on the meaning behind the code rather than the code itself, Test/Dichotomatic ENTP v. ENTJ, for example, is basically asking whether the person is more haphazard and spontaneous or more planned, conscientious and orderly - it's directly what the tests measure and the types differ only on one scale. They're both extroverts and iNtuitive Thinkers.  In Function-land, where we look at how the person takes in, evaluates and organizes information, the meaning is different. Here we find that ENTPs and ENTJs use an entirely different set of processes:  ENTPs are primarily watchers who lead with extroverted Intuition (Ne) - it's an exploring, brainstorming kind of process that draws its inspiration from the outside world and is very interested in it, and complement that with Ti - an evaluating process that focuses on building accurate mental models of things. How the cogs turn is more important than what that turning accomplishes.  ENTJs lead with extroverted Thinking or Te - cold, detached reasoning like Ti, but focused on evaluating the properties of the outside world and exerting control over it, usually with the aim of ordering it to be more efficient. They complement this with introverted Intuition, which in contrast to Ne's curious exploration just drinks in tons of information and subconsciously finds patterns in there that it then condenses it into a holistic understanding of how something ticks that the Ni type himself often needs to work to ""map out"".  In short, they're totally different :D  Same applies to INTP vs. INFP - in test-land the difference is a slight preference to Thinking or Feeling type items in the questionnaire, but in Function-land an INTPs primary processes are Ti (dominant/compulsive) and Ne (auxiliary/habitual), while INFPs lead with Fi and use Ne as auxiliary - they share the habitual process and their dominant function is introspective, evaluative in nature so their minds are kind of similar in construction, but the compulsive, dominant process is different which is a very large change.  tl;dr: Same code, different meaning. Keep them separate, and they will be useful to you. Try to force them to align, and you'll only confuse yourself or end up acting in a non-genuine way."

If I am 50% J and 50% P (is that possible?) than what is the order of my function?   Here are some points I can give to answer some of your questions. These should tide you over until good ol' reliable /u/Komatik comes in and destroys your questions (and possibly my response along with them):   MBTI stand for Myers Briggs Type Indicator, not Identifier. In other words, the test is only meant to aid someone in figuring out their type. That's why practitioners take an extra step after distributing the tests, which is to talk to the participants about their results. When tested for, the dichotomies (J/P etc) don't necessarily give you the correct functions. The dichotomies are derived from the functions, not the other way around. Because of this, online enthusiasts often don't put much trust into the dichotomies and prefer to deal with the functions themselves (though perhaps not as independent of each other.) 4-letter-codes are shorthand for specific functional stacks, which are really the heart of MBTI's theoretical basis. With tests, it's common for people to fall near the middle of a scale. All this would indicate is uncertainty of which trait inside a dichotomy predominates. So getting 55% J and 45% P really says ""you're probably a J, but there's a 45% chance you're a P."" Additionally, the theory is that a person is one type or another; there are no in-between types. However, this doesn't make people either 100% iNtuitive or 100% Sensing. Everyone is a little N, S, T, F, and so on. An unusually high score in, say, T might indicate an overuse of that function."

mbti,3b5hyd,CritSrc,2,Fri Jun 26 08:57:15 2015 UTC,"Go see functions, the letters are just shorthand for them. But even then you might confuse both types(we had an ENFP who mistyped as an ENFJ due to her influences).  But the bigger difference is that one fun to keep people happy and get closer to their ideal, but vague vision, the others see ideal possibilities and just have fun with what they see as desirable leading to quirkiness and ""jumpy"" energy in a sense. ENFJs can also be energetic, but rarely for its own sake."
mbti,3b5hyd,daffodils11,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:37:47 2015 UTC,"Being a J or a P doesn't really mean too much on it's own. It's basically telling you which axis is extroverted first. So a P would have Ne/Se in their top two functions, and a J would have Te/Fe. Therefore the other axis in the 4-letter code will be introverted. The I or E will tell you which function then comes first, ie. ISTP - P means perceiving is extroverted, so Se, therefore T must be introverted. Function order puts the introverted function first- Ti,Se,Ni,Fe - as opposed to ESTP where it'd be Se,Ti,Fe,Ni.  As an ENFJ, you are Je, Pi, Pe, Ji (Fe,Ni,Se,Ti). While I score on the border of J/P as well, ENFPs are actually very different to us. If you've spent time with either type, you'll be able to tell very quickly who you align with more.   Having strong on both may just mean you are confusing functions for each other. But maybe, it's my theory that it's healthier if your P and J test more similarly, because then it more likely means you are using both your perceiving and judging function in almost equal capacity (which is good because your first two functions are both J and P) - rather than relying more heavily on one or the other."

mbti,3b47a9,JaggedG,3,Fri Jun 26 01:53:44 2015 UTC,"It's actually super hard to come up with questions about cognitive functions (i.e. not just the basic E vs I, etc) that people taking the test answer correctly on average. They are usually just too subtle or intricate somehow. The whole reason the 4 dichotomies are a thing is that people reliably answer questions about them.  I know because I've definitely tried to -- in fact, if you could do this, it would literally prove that the Myers Briggs model is real, which has not been done to date.     Part of the problem is that it's difficult to know if you have done it successfully, assuming you want to design your test based on sample data. This is because you have to correlate the results of each question to peoples types, and the non linear relationship between the cognitive functions and the basic 4 dichotomies often means that the sum of all errors in typing people in your sample conspires against you, rather than cancelling out.  Personally, I'm the guy who wrote 25quiz.com and there's definitely some ways I'd like to improve my test (both the scoring algorithm and the questions). It all takes a really long time to get right, though, and I often have to work on other projects sadly!"

mbti,3b612f,JaggedG,3,Fri Jun 26 06:50:15 2015 UTC,"The test results don't tell you anything about a person's functions - the test measures people along four scales and tries to ascertain the strength of preference for them - you can make better predictions of someone's behavior if he has strong preferences on the test, yes, but it doesn't relate to how developed his use of his functions is, or what his functions are.  To explain it the long way, there's two main ways to assign yourself a type / get yourself a type code.  The first is assigning yourself four letters by taking a test (or doing it yourself), the second figuring out what cognitive functions (~=go-to habits for taking in, evaluating and organizing information) you use. Both give you the same kind of code because the approaches have a lot of shared history, but the meaning behind the code is different because of how it's arrived at.   Using a test or otherwise looking into the four dichotomies to get a code and then look what kind of functions you're supposed to use from that is usually a bad idea (for example, I often get IxTP results from tests - this would mean I use Ti, which I don't - I'm a very clear Te type). Despite being different, both of these approaches give you valuable information but should be kept separate because they mean very, very different things.  The tests / dichotomatic approach ranks you on four different scales that are more or less separate from each other - ie. your score on one shouldn't influence your score on the others much at all. Having only a slight preference here is normal, and pretty much expected. The test results tend to fluctuate a good bit as well, especially so if you have only mild preferences one way or another - mood, the day, the alignment of the stars and whether your cat clawed your eyes out in the morning all become a large influence in your responses.  What the test letters mean, roughly: I/E = introverted/extroverted. Do you like being out and about, esp. around people. N/S = Abstract-minded or concrete person. F/T = Do you reason more on sentiment and good/bad type of judgment or in a cold, detached way. The F items put a good deal of weight on being accomodating (ie. something the functions approach would term extroverted Feeling, Fe) P/J = How organized, scheduled, conscientious you are. The more P, the more disorganized and spontaneous, the more J, the more organized and planned.      If looking at this, it makes sense how eg. getting a job would make you seem more J - and by the test's measure, you are, and the results of the dichotomatic test actually told you something useful about yourself. But I wouldn't use them to assign yourself a functional type.  To explain that better, let's look at the other way to get a type code: figuring out what functions you use.  The functional approach is a rough model that tries to explain how you take in, evaluate and organize information by dividing the information processing into four core processes (Thinking, Feeling, Sensing and iNtuition) each of which has two attitudes (ie. extraversion, or interest in the external world, and introversion, ie. interest in what is going on inside your head) and then figuring out which processes you use in what attitudes. They're often shortened to a function code of Core process and Attitude, ie. Sensing in the extroverted attitude = Se.  Two examples would be an inclination to use the Thinking function focusing more on personal models, their accuracy and looking for root causes (introverted Thinking, Ti) or the state of the outside world or analyzed system, exerting control over it and making the most of what you have (extroverted Thinking, Te), or using Feeling to focus more on the harmony of the group and people's expressions of sentiment (extroverted Feeling, Fe) or on being true to yourself and looking at the motivations behind expressions of sentiment (introverted Feeling, Fi).  To contrast why it's important to focus on the meaning behind the code rather than the code itself, Test/Dichotomatic ENTP v. ENTJ, for example, is basically asking whether the person is more haphazard and spontaneous or more planned, conscientious and orderly - it's directly what the tests measure and the types differ only on one scale. They're both extroverts and iNtuitive Thinkers.  In Function-land, where we look at how the person takes in, evaluates and organizes information, the meaning is different. Here we find that ENTPs and ENTJs use an entirely different set of processes:  ENTPs are primarily watchers who lead with extroverted Intuition (Ne) - it's an exploring, brainstorming kind of process that draws its inspiration from the outside world and is very interested in it, and complement that with Ti - an evaluating process that focuses on building accurate mental models of things. How the cogs turn is more important than what that turning accomplishes.  ENTJs lead with extroverted Thinking or Te - cold, detached reasoning like Ti, but focused on evaluating the properties of the outside world and exerting control over it, usually with the aim of ordering it to be more efficient. They complement this with introverted Intuition, which in contrast to Ne's curious exploration just drinks in tons of information and subconsciously finds patterns in there that it then condenses it into a holistic understanding of how something ticks that the Ni type himself often needs to work to ""map out"".  In short, they're totally different :D  Same applies to INTP vs. INFP - in test-land the difference is a slight preference to Thinking or Feeling type items in the questionnaire, but in Function-land an INTPs primary processes are Ti (dominant/compulsive) and Ne (auxiliary/habitual), while INFPs lead with Fi and use Ne as auxiliary - they share the habitual process and their dominant function is introspective, evaluative in nature so their minds are kind of similar in construction, but the compulsive, dominant process is different which is a very large change.  tl;dr: Same code, different meaning. Keep them separate, and they will be useful to you. Try to force them to align, and you'll only confuse yourself or end up acting in a non-genuine way."
mbti,3b612f,Komatik,2,Fri Jun 26 09:00:07 2015 UTC,"Wow, great write-up! Super informative. But what does that say about people ""in the middle?""   My understanding is that when people ask, ""Can I be multiple types?"" or ""What if I'm an ambivert?"" then they're kind of missing the point... Which is that you use all of the cognitive functions at different times, it's just a question of preference.  But some people should be able to juggle different functions fairly fluently, while others tend to lean on certain ones harder than others... How do you deal with that? (I thought that's what the tests' percentages were for...)"
mbti,3b612f,CritSrc,3,Fri Jun 26 10:21:40 2015 UTC,"Which is that you use all of the cognitive functions at different times, it's just a question of preference.   I stick the 4 function model since it's tighter. But it's obvious that the dominant function pretty much drive 75% of someone's mind, because in that capacity the other 3 serve it, and even when it's another function doing it, the dominant's influence is still there.  Percentages in tests just show the certainty of the letter/functions, not their attitude. Or least they're supposed to when working properly."

Which is that you use all of the cognitive functions at different times, it's just a question of preference.   Yeah, they are missing the point. Everyone has all four core functions (Thinking, Feeling, iNtuition, Sensation), the differences come from what you tend to use compulsively and/or habitually vs. what's more unconscious, and the attitudes you use those functions in. That you tend to lean in different directions in different situations and contexts does not mean you change your type.  Furthermore, a function is just an ingrained pattern of thinking you tend to go to (not in a conscious way, but if you ask me and an INTP or ISTP to give a rational analysis of something we'll focus on quite different things because of the way we're drawn to do cold, detached thinking). They're a description of our tendencies, preferences, patterns, predilections, aptitudes, not spirits that possess us or tools that we need to have to do something (which tends to lead into the 8-function models in the vein of John Beebe or Socionics)."

Both are the best leaders for their niches, and can be very loyal to the cause they serve.   A major internal difference lies in scope of planning. I have a flexible, constantly updating ten year plan, but I have to consciously not neglect aspects of the day-to-day. My friend, on the other hand, is just living life one day at a time. He's going into the military and knows what he wants to do after, but that's it.  Another one is respect for authority. I respect authority and rank that I deem worthy, and that means I have to be in awe of the leader's effectiveness. I ask why. Meanwhile, my friend will accept authority he deems legitimate.

As of late, working through past issues and PTSD things, my ENTP is becoming an EN(T/F)P, with often no discernible preference. The differences are purely situational, whether I will weigh in with more of a T or F approach. I will always be a very strong N and P, though.   Also, boxing people up into 16 compartments is a little bit of a restrictive exercise on such a large population scale.

mbti,3b32mi,Komatik,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:03:12 2015 UTC,It's important that the middle functions are perceiving ones - a different judging stack in the middle (ie. IxFJ v. IxTJ or ExFP v. ExTP) does create a more starkly different feel than eg ESTJ v. ENTJ or INTP v. ISTP.
mbti,3b32mi,LogicalEmotion7,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:53:45 2015 UTC,"I think the magnitude of difference is actually the same here, but the manner is very different. A different good friend is an ISTJ and he is dating an ISFJ. They see the world in the exact same way, but their judgments differ in about the same way that my perceptions differ from my ESTJ friend.   The ISTJ is kind, firm, and honest because he believes it is right to be. The ISFJ is caring, soft, and tactful because she wants to make others happy, but will also use logic if necessary. The secret to their similarity is that both are well-developed, at least to a point.  In the same way, ENTJs and ESTJs can become radically different if they do not develop that third function."

Paraphrasing Jung, the repressed function is the one function people have the least control over, and as such, when it is expressed it is often loud and authentic."

mbti,3b1n2r,Entr0pic08,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:42:17 2015 UTC,"Take Campbell for starters - the idea of Hero of Thousand Faces is a very Ni kind of premise. It's all about perspectives, seeing the same thing in different ways and in various contexts. Even the one quote you offered is more of an Ni thing to say. Campbell was all about identifying archetypes and the monomyth is based on Jung's original archetypes as well. Derrida, I could see him as an ISTP maybe, because his idea of deconstruction is about breaking things down into parts and seeing how these parts can constitute a different version of how to see something. I am also not sure I think Johnny Depp is an INFP either. I don't think the one quote you offered actually suggests anything about Depp's preferred cognition. It only seems to say something about his particular psychological coping mechanisms but not whether he's actually oriented based on FiNe. If you want a better example of an xNFP celebrity, there's Keanu Reeves."
mbti,3b1n2r,Komatik,5,Thu Jun 25 21:48:28 2015 UTC,"my problem with this is that  you're analyzing the philosophy and not the philosopher. Kant is supposedly INTP yet he said that not all people can understand philosophy, something that isn't in line with the Ti/Fe bias/disposition. But if you know that Kant was greatly troubled my his own conclusion INTP starts to make sense.   So you describe the premise of the hero of a thousand faces (whether that premise speaks more to Ne or Ni is debatable) and you provide Derrida's philosophy as well but you don't actually address the philosopher himself."

mbti,3b1n2r,Entr0pic08,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:16:28 2015 UTC,"But their style of thinking is what implies how they actually think. I don't see what's contrary to Ti-Fe with the claim that not everyone can understand philosophy. I see that kind of claim as extremely unrelated to the functions. I also don't see how being troubled by his own conclusions is what points to INTP - rather, it is how he approached reality and how he saw it that suggests Ti. Kant wanted to define it and human experience within his own subjective framework. Philosophy in and of itself has this goal and is even as a school of thought essentially Ti, which is to say that not every philosopher is Ti, but Western philosophy is Ti in essence.   And the premise is more Ni because he is moving away from the object because he's emphasizing the connections he finds valuable. It's a very archetypal thing he's doing and Ni deals with archetypes."
mbti,3b1n2r,forfourwon,2,Fri Jun 26 18:45:08 2015 UTC,Let's disregard the Ti/Fe bit because that was just an example of the idea I wanted to demonstrate and not my main point.   I say that any type could write a book on how all the religions and stories in the world are in fact just one archetype (which is the premise that you say is Ni). Similarly you don't have to be an Se-dom to like extreme snowboarding. But Se has a disposition towards engaging with the environment and thus a disposition towards snowboarding. So typing someone by their activities (what celebritytypes would call mental contents) instead of why they do those activities and by what processes (what CT would call mental functions) is unreliable.
mbti,3b1n2r,FriendlyBatman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:18:16 2015 UTC,"I am not entirely sure wherein your disagreement lies tbh, because I am not necessarily in disagreement with that you state one shouldn't type people based on their activities as in, someone who likes snowboarding doesn't need to do it for Se reasons. That's not what I stated though. When we look at Campbell's monomyth, it implies a lot of how he structures and perceives reality though, because the data and focus that's present in the idea says something about him. I wouldn't for example say he's an introvert because he wrote a book or something like that. It's more that one is looking at his motivations, where his thinking originates from."

mbti,3azvkb,_mildude,6,Thu Jun 25 03:15:36 2015 UTC,"a lot of people think Ti = philosophizing or thinking inwardly or whatever when it's about comparing theoretical logical systems. INTPs are constantly (as a natural, inherent state) comparing systems and data in their heads without the absolute need to execute these plans in real life. theorizing the system is its own reward. that's dom-Ti. compare INTPs with INTJs who have Te, and INTJs are more focused on applied logic, aka using logic directly to build things irl. 'how can i use this information in my life/career?' is more of a Te question whereas INTPs just want to hoard 'useless' 'unusable' information because they are utterly obsessed with every bit of knowledge. every INTP i've known just wants to learn as much as they possibly can in their lifetime for its own sake, above all.  Fi is technically about values (developed from past experiences, feelings etc). what trips many of us Dom-Fi users up is that often our values aren't so obvious to us, and we don't think of ourselves as particularly value-oriented. when an INFP feels lost, perhaps nothing will feel super important and there'll be an ostensibly value-less nihilism thing going on. absence of obvious Fi values isn't Ti though. sometimes the best way to decide whether you're one or the other is if you're dom-Ti or not dom-Ti. Fi can feel more nebulous/less specific and more personalized to each INFP; different values from different INFPs will present themselves in different ways and to different degrees.   Additionally, many many INFPs are in careers where they really need to exercise their Te/generally be logical all the time, (think sys admin or web developer) so they'll get confused into thinking they have Ti. but yeah, Ti does not equal general logic usage :)  hope this helps"

We take knowledge and work with it when it's something we personally think is useful. An INTP will take it in and work with it regardless of use. Your description of Te is more like Ti-Se than it is Ni-Te. You're describing an INTJ to compare dom-Ti to Te? Why not an ENTJ who actually has dom-Te? People have a tendency to overemphasize Te in an INTJ and underemphasize their Fi.   When describing a function on it's own you can't just describe it in the way it works for intuitives and assume it works that way for all types with that function."

mbti,3azvkb,bezald,-1,Mon Jun 29 17:27:48 2015 UTC,"yeah, okay. i thought that given the context of my comment i wouldn't need to spell out everything completely.   i use INTJ as an example because there are more INTJs in this community. Sure, Ti-Se can function in a similar way, but Te takes on a more applied logic role when compared to INTP dom-Ti as well. and i wasn't focusing on ISTPs in my comment...  I can see how it sounded confusing but I think people got the gist. my main focus was comparing INFPs to INTPs anyway. my intention wasn't to compare and contrast and go through all the functions of four different types, just to do a basic comparison that would illuminate why INFPs mistype as INTPs so often."
mbti,3azvkb,bezald,2,Mon Jun 29 17:26:20 2015 UTC,"I get that your intention was to compare INTP and INFP and how both can use logic, but use it differently. However, your comment can be viewed as being a description of Ti and Te in a vacuum & generally how people mistype Fi vs Ti (which isn't only in INFPs and INTPs!) since that was the beginning context. This may lead someone who feels like they use your version of Ti or Te to think they are INTP or INTJ, rather than an STP or STJ, which is probably an even more common mistype than NFP for NTP. I know you weren't focusing in ISTPs in your comment, but to say that people think Ti = this, when Ti is actually INTP Ti, is a narrow definition. It doesn't really get at the core of how Ti works vs how Te works. I mean, I agree with the points you make about Fi being hard to pin down/why and how an INFP can be mistaken for an INTP, but I'm just trying to make sure that people are aware than intuitive functions aren't the only way things work. And again, most mistypes are probably because people only compare within intuitive types rather than consider the possibility they are actually a sensor."

Yeah, I suppose if I spent more time/energy on my comment representing every function of every type perfectly it would have been better, but whatever. I think it gave a good general overview of what I was trying to touch on. My initial comment was about INFPs being misunderstood so I don't know why you expected me to make so many distinctions and bring Se into it. Generally speaking, Ti IS about logical systems so I'd be interested to hear how you personally define it. And my distinction between Te and Ti was a totally fair one...

Just was trying to add to your comment about Ti, which sounds like INTP Ti & throw it out there that it's not all like that. I was the one trying to bring Se into it, since so many people I've come across are very not into the idea of being a sensor, even if they are one. You think your comment didn't sound like you were describing Ti in general, but the words you used had me interpret it that way & here we are continuing to misinterpret the other's intention/comments. I was just trying to point out that there are other things to consider, other viewpoints, what have you.

I've always found I could get along with them, whereas most SJ types I often have an incredibly hard time communicating with them in any circumstance and I'm like some kind of weird alien to them (and vice versa).  In fact, I find it easier to communicate and get along with STPs than I do even with NTJs — which to me means that the S/N isn't as much of a barrier to understanding as the J/P dichotomy.  I'm tempted to write something about the ways I think STPs and NTPs (especially introverts, as we have the same dominant function) are similar to each other, but I will probably never manage to be satisfied with what I write down so maybe some other time :P"

NTJs use Te-Fi, and Ni-Se, entirely unlike us.  From this, (though I haven't an iota of personal experience with this), you might expect SFJs (Si-Ne, Fe-Ti) to be easier to get along with than SFPs (Se-Ni, Fi-Te) -- again because of shared functions/ways of processing and understanding the world."

mbti,3azvkb,TrantaLocked,4,Thu Jun 25 05:18:03 2015 UTC,"Their answer is that they are usually right. The problem is that they can carry this asshole vibe with every argument they present. Even if you literally were always right, there's no need to be an asshole about it. It is amusing to me though.  The thing I noticed that I was afraid to say in the subreddit is that often an INTJ will think they are right due to the inability of the opponent to give them the exact data they want to hear to change their own mind or at least consider the other possibility. This leads them to thinking they are still right even when they have already been proven to have shaky positions, and I believe it has to do with weak extroverted perceiving and unwillingness to use Ne, or even inability to use Ne properly since it's a shadow function. They think that because their Ni is so powerful there won't ever be a need for Ne, and often their judgements are not only missing a lot but also heavily fi-backed."

mbti,3azvkb,ExplicitInformant,4,Wed Jun 24 21:43:58 2015 UTC,"I want to not fall for these stereotypes -- can I nag you for help?  If you'll indulge me: Are there any sources for ESTJ descriptions that you particularly like (e.g., Michael Pierce YouTube videos)? Any characters in shows that you identified strongly with as a potential ESTJ or SJ character? I know most of the major sites -- I am more interested in whether that question immediately triggers a ""The only exception is this really great and nuanced description at bargleflatt.com"" -- if nothing comes to mind, that's cool. :)  Another way of getting at it -- could you easily put into words what the descriptions are missing? Is it that the descriptions impose too many limitations (e.g., implying that the use of Te makes you a robot incapable of a rounded human experience), or are there unique nuances of emotion/experience of being ESTJ that are outright missing (like tertiary Ne connections and ideas)? Again, not trying to put you (or anyone) on the spot for The One Answer -- more interested in individual ESTJs' (or SJs') opinions on what could be better understood by those of us who don't have the personal experience to be able to call out bullshit in the descriptions we read, or to know what is missing/added/misrepresented!  Any SJs who read and want to answer for their own type, please do!"
mbti,3azvkb,Komatik,5,Wed Jun 24 21:48:00 2015 UTC,"I just think the uncaring robot stereotype describes a somewhat unhealthy invididual. Si can get stuck in a rules rules rules rut and Te can domineer - it has a grain of truth to it, surely, but largely describes the negative.  In addition, the descriptions typically use the word traditionalistic to describe Si types - it's not that Si naturally appreciates the traditional way, but rather that they're inclines to use a proven way. Traditional approaches can be that, but especially the young SJ usually habituates himself to things, adopts personal ways of doing things that work for him. Over time, these become ingrained in the person and today's blazing fast world can in a sense move too fast, passing the SJ by, which gives the impression of the older SJs as being ""traditionalistic"" or ""stuck in the past"".  I can't speak from personal experience, but two of the STJs I know are really admirable people - the ISTJ constantly tries new things to see what works for him, adopting what works, and as a consequence has done a lot more than I have, for example, even if it's only briefly.  The ESTJ is a happy, friendly, slightly goofy character. Likes doing things, and seemingly has an endless well of energy, positivity and excitement with which to strive onwards.  Both of them very much walk the beaten path, but both do it the way they find comfortable and interesting.  For dealing with people, I think a lot of good can come from just trying to see the good in things and stating it, even if it feels like a foregone conclusion, and keeping in mind that people often just want validation for the way they feel if they've had a bad day or the like, not a functional suggestion for how they can feel less crummy in the future - there's a time for that, but that time isn't always."

mbti,3azvkb,jermofo,6,Thu Jun 25 02:28:50 2015 UTC,"Look at the various related subs like /r/intp, /r/entp, /r/infp or this sub, for example, there are lots of people that mis-type or are confused about their types.  The INTx is particularly common when an INTP is able to be organized at work or school, but aren't at home. Or were undeveloped early on, and later actually learned some some life skills so, Voila!, personality changed! Some people claim to change twice a day.  Nonsense.    As far as relationships go, it takes an unnatural amount of patience for me and getting way outside my comfort level so much so that I'm more comfortable than those I date.  Practice doesn't make perfect, but it can make confident. Online dating has worked for me fairly well. I do very little and with a well written profile on the right site, like minded women will seek me out.  I know that I'm not most girls' cup of tea, but one in a hundred, will eat my shit up.  Seriously, most people do not expect any degree of authenticity in dating and if you can honestly be that way, you are doing well. From there, relationships take practice.  I sucked most of my life.  I'm still not that great, but I've found that my Ne skills are pretty helpful.   Overall, figuring out how to portray yourself honestly and accurately is golden.    Figure out Fi.  If you are in a relationship, you need to figure out F types, especially since we are emotional Fe midgets and understand Fi least of all. Relationships aren't that hard, as long as you don't chase rainbows.  Communication is key if you should find yourself in such a situation."
mbti,3azvkb,Odditys,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:24:38 2015 UTC,Figure out Fi.   Why that one?
mbti,3azvkb,jermofo,2,Thu Jun 25 04:32:36 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that shadow functions are given a lot of importance in this community. I haven't studied them too much, personally, but I think that idea of the opposite of your inferior being your least identified with is reasonable enough.  For us that would be Fi.  With weak Fe, understanding emotions in general isn't that easy, but unless you know that Fi users operate in a different way, misunderstandings and poor communication are more likely.    In my experience, when a conflict occurs in a relationship (which will happen from time to time) the differences between Fe and Fi are at their most relevant.  Using weak Fe, we just want to restore the harmony, maybe express our feelings, talk it over and move on.  Unless of course the disagreement violates one of our core principles, then we are less likely to kiss and make up and may choose instead to stand our ground.  If the other person is an Fi user, especially when it is more prominent, they may shut you out as their feelings are directed inward.  You are left having to guess what is wrong and how the other is feeling, making our need for restoring harmony very difficult. This can lead to a terrible cycle.  The more that we try to ""fix"" the problem, the more an Fi user might resent the attempt to ""fix"" it.  They may see it as insincere, inauthentic, as if you will do anything or say anything just to make up, and maybe don't understand why you just don't get it.   It can get worse from there and as you go around in circles, you can spiral further.   I've found that comparing Fi to our own Ti is helpful.  You know all your inner thoughts that are kind of abstract and not necessarily fleshed out or ready to be expressed?  That is kind of how Fi works.  Just like I hate it when someone is trying to read me and figure out what I'm thinking, they hate it when you do that with their feelings.  Both are very subjective and internal.  Both need more time for reflection than their extroverted counterparts. Maybe they aren't telling you what they are feeling, is because they have totally figured it out yet.  Just like with some of out thinking judgements. Understanding that and seeing the similarities between the two can be very helpful when trying to relate to someone.  Simply being able to express succinctly where you are coming from and to roughly understand where someone else's head is at is the whole MBTI thing is all about."
mbti,3azvkb,Komatik,2,Thu Jun 25 08:13:56 2015 UTC,"Another difference tends to be Fe focusing more on the expression of sentiment (=the outside-world fact, analogously to Te taking stock of what is), with Fi first looking for the motivation behind what was expressed (=find the root cause, analogously to Ti's search for it).   When stressed, that search for underlying motivation can result in some really nasty psychologizing of others, seeing malign or otherwise false motive where there is none."
mbti,3azvkb,Komatik,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:04:09 2015 UTC,"Figure out Fi.   An INTP friend thinks it's a very easy function to understand. Can be annoying to deal with when the Fi type locks up, but understanding is not really a problem."
mbti,3azvkb,jermofo,2,Fri Jun 26 12:37:20 2015 UTC,"Fi now is a very easy to understand function, but it wasn't always.  It took personal experience in relationships with a couple of Fi doms, and then only recently after studying the functions.  I doubt I ever would have figured it out on my own if it weren't for this effort and retroactively typing past exes that I knew really well.  I always just chalked it up to people are crazy or I just understand them even less than they do themselves.  Now I kind of get where their head is at.  Like you often say, it takes some heavy lifting, but I can do it if I try.    Couldn't agree more about the Fi lock up. Very annoying, but now that I understand why it happens, I'm more comfortable when it happens.  I think that there is a tendency for younger INTPs especially to take the lock up personally and go into crisis mode once their sense of harmony is broken. It isn't just annoying, but something we will dwell on until resolution occurs one way or another.  We don't like stuff we can't figure out, especially when we have to figure it out immediately."

Just because I am good at small-talk or buttering thing up, doesn't mean I enjoy it; I think it's a waste of time.   I am good at maths, and enjoy theorising about the universe/sci-fi stuff. While I prefer harmony in a group and hate emotional conflict that I'm a part of, I love and can easily hold my own with most debate topics (especially against IxTPs). I have very strong opinions about some things and enjoy proving my truth to be right. I am very competitive, and can momentarily overlook others feelings when I get caught up in winning.

Step II provides additional depth and clarification within each of the four original MBTI preference pairs, or dichotomies.  Isabel Briggs Myers had noted that people of any given type shared differences as well as similarities, and at the time of her death was developing a more in depth method to offer clues about how each person expresses and experiences their type pattern, which is called MBTI Step II. In the 1980s, Kathy Myers and Peter Myers developed a team of type experts, and a factor analysis was conducted [citation needed]. This resulted in the identification of five subscales (with corresponding pairs of facets each) for each of the four MBTI scales.  These break down the uniqueness of individuals into greater detail, by bringing to light the subtle nuances of personality type; thus avoiding the reduction of all of personality to just the 16 types.

Si is about reflecting on and being affected by the concrete.  Examples:  Si-user is taught that Jesus is holy, and they see and image of Him, they will be affected by the image in a holy way.  Si-user is more likely to be bothered by high/low temperatures or loud sounds because they are more focused on how their body/mind is receiving the heat/sound stimuli.  Si-user will spend more time thinking about their immediate concrete environment, the things they like, the things they dislike, and the things they could improve.  Side Notes:  Si isn't necessarily about the past, an SJ may or may not have a better memory than an NJ, but because Si is about experience, and we can only know our past (and current) experiences, Si can have the appearance of being the ""past function.""  Si is connected to tradition because that tradition is associated with a positive sensory experience. Opening new presents on Christmas, for example, might lead an SJ to have their children go through the same Christmas rituals to try and get the kids to have that same positive sensory experience.  Si is not about conservatism. The stereotypical SJ conservatism (political or risk-related) comes from having low Ne, leading to a harder time seeing possibilities outside of their own personal experience."

mbti,3avt4p,WhatINeverSaid,8,Wed Jul 1 12:03:35 2015 UTC,"A simple example can be how an Si type ate bad eggs which made the Si type sick. The Si type will then henceforth associate eggs with this feeling of sickness and will, whenever thinking about or conveying current experiences involving eggs, infuse the present moment with the associated feeling of sickness.   Ah, so it's Si's fault I have a mild phobia of milk now.  Knew it."
mbti,3avt4p,ayyyavalanche,3,Wed Jun 24 05:40:27 2015 UTC,"Excellent post. I was thinking a few days ago about how Si seems to be one of, if not the least understood function in the general MBTI community -- especially when you read Jung's work and see that it barely resembles the dumbed-down Si stereotype. Glad you went ahead and did such a thorough write-up."
mbti,3avt4p,acornzyall,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:35:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I agree. I am going to include this into a  book eventually, and perhaps I should mention the part of Si =! memory too since it's not memory per se, but rather the desire to reminisce on physical details that felt significant. Si tends to be nostalgic about the past though, and enjoy retelling stories or events in order to deepen their sensory experience of what happened in the past."
mbti,3awse4,MonsieurGadfly,3,Wed Jun 24 03:16:03 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the difference between Jung and MBTI is that Jung has the first function being opposite all three of the other functions:  E.g. an ENTP is Ne/Ti/Fi/Si  Myers/Briggs changed it to e.g. Ne/Ti/Fe/Si and afaik I know everybody agrees that they were right. Which is why we refer to the ""Myers Briggs theory"" and bring up Jung on occasion."
mbti,3awse4,hawkxor,2,Wed Jun 24 11:53:38 2015 UTC,"Is there a source for Jung stating that the three weaker functions are the opposite of the strongest in terms of attitude, I/E?  I ask because I could imagine the MBTI version of Ne/Ti/Fe/Si nevertheless being Ne is conscious, while Ti/Fe/Si unconscious, as Jung said the strongest function is conscious unlike the weaker functions, or in other words, the strongest function is under conscious control, unlike the 3 weaker functions."
mbti,3awse4,hotknifethrubuttah,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:03:31 2015 UTC,See my post below and http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Jung/types.htm.
mbti,3awse4,TheoryCat,2,Thu Jun 25 01:08:15 2015 UTC,"Jung never ordered the functions in the order in the way the MBTI tries to. There eight 8 types in Jung's original writings. And each person can have two function-types (dominant and auxiliary) in their consciousness (much like MBTI):   Accurate investigation of the individual case consistently reveals the fact that, in conjunction with the most differentiated function, another function of secondary importance, and therefore of inferior differentiation in consciousness, is constantly present, and is a -- relatively determining factor.    N-S and T-F are opposites so they cannot go together in the person's two main types. So, for example, if the dominant type is N then the secondary type must be T or F. Jung did not say that they have to have an introverted or extraverted orientation. Also, Jung believes that a healthy adult must have a differentiated type - he cannot have both developed S/N or T/F function-types at the same time. A person can have their unconscious function-types brought into the consciousness via the individuation process, but the once inferior functions would serve their main function-type.  Source: http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Jung/types.htm  Note that the above doesn't represent my opinion of the psyche; I am merely paraphrasing Jung's writings. Though I love Jung's works (if you haven't, I highly recommend some of his books!), I'm ambivalent about some of his claims."
mbti,3awse4,TheoryCat,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:06:51 2015 UTC,Interesting. I'm also interested in a source because I've always interpreted the parts on balancing the conscious and unconscious in the way where the tertiary is the same attitude as the dominant.
mbti,3awse4,hotknifethrubuttah,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:25:04 2015 UTC,"The only thing I really dislike about MBTI is that the J/P refers to the first function that is extroverted. For example, here's the process of understanding INFJ:   INFJ means the strongest function is I. Which is it, N or F? J refers to F/T, but does not mean that F is the strongest (most developed) function, but the first extroverted function, therefore Fe. So if F is not the strongest, then N is the strongest function. Put this together with the I, means NiFe and hence the rest, TiSe.  For years I'd never heard of J/P meaning extroverted until I came here. I'd believed J must imply the strongest function and it looked like F must be the strongest, which countered all the descriptions about the INFJ. It's much simpler to make the order of the letters mean the order of the functions from strongest (most developed) to weakest.  INFJ could be shortened to INF and would then mean, NiFeTiSe  Here's another example:  INFP would become IFN, and in more detail FiNeSiTe   Here's the logic required using MBTI. I is the strongest function, but which is it, N or F? Look at P, the perceptive. N is perceptive, so it is the first extroverted function. Ok, if N is Ne, then F must be I, and because I is the strongest, then Fi the strongest function. And only then can one figure out in order as we all now do, FiNeSiTe.  Order is clear from the start, WYSIWYG.  Another simple way to use order is to incorporate the I/E into the first letter (the 3rd column):  INFJ > INF > NiFeTiSe  INFP > IFN > FiNeSiTe  ESTP > EST > SeTiFeNi  ESTJ > ETS > TeSiNeFi  This also makes it so much easier to look at opposite types by simply reordering the functions, like a mirror image: INFJ vs ESTP becomes INF vs EST, or in more detail, NiFeTiSe vs SeTiFeNi  Even easier is if the stacks are literally stacked  I - E  N - S  F - T   or   Ni  vs Se  Fe - Ti  Ti - Fe  Se - Ni  Concomitant with the J/P problem is that it does not imply rational versus irrational. Countless times I've sensed newbies hear Judging and think of its negative connotations, or hearing Perception and leave it as just that, ""it's about perceiving the world, so what?"" But rational versus irrational points to a relationship that is crucial to understand. Rational and irrational work together, can support each other at the same time, whereas F/T cannot function at the same time, like S/N cannot either, though F or T can work with S or N. This little insight proves quite useful.  Jung's original terminology is meaningful, rich in context. Judging implies Rational, Perceiving implies Irrational, Feeling implies Value, Thinking implies Meaning, Sensation implies actual, Intuition implies Possible, and I/E are attitudes. But I do really like that MBTI clarified that the functions have an order of introverted vs extroverted in the function stack, i.e. FiNeSiTe. And that all the users have added to the general outline of personalities to help identify types and their more familiar characteristics."

But without it I'm sure discussions would be way more dull."

mbti,3avze9,_mildude,3,Thu Jun 25 11:46:35 2015 UTC,"I think what you're experiencing may be Ti and Ne working together, which when combined, act pretty similar to Ni.  EDIT: Ti + Ne isn't a direct mirror of Ni or vice-versa; they're just extremely alike in regards to certain aspects."

mbti,3avze9,ayyyavalanche,3,Thu Jun 25 04:38:53 2015 UTC,"Oh no, Ni-speak is hella different than trying to externalize Ti's raw idea structure, Ni in words tries to explain its perception in a very roundabout way that comes off as extremely vague and undefinable for something Ti can sum up in a few words. Not only are Ni description unwieldy, users would tell that language itself can't communicate the experience, while Ti can with some fleshing out of the idea, put it in a formula, coin in a few terms and really put forward the idea on paper with a schematic that reflects the rigid structure. Ni has no structure, it's just processing and assessing information internalized by the individual making the connections for whatever reason, pulling them together in something that comes to resemble reality until Je can finally say: That's it. While for Ti-Ne, it's more of a layout from the getgo and going through the ropes again and again like mental check of what is possible, diverging paths, seeking connections in between them and repeating patterns Si notices and Ne bounces off of, each one is evaluated by Ti until the most efficient one is chosen out of the ones that are deemed correct."

mbti,3avze9,ThisWontDo,8,Wed Jun 24 15:24:15 2015 UTC,"Ni is definitely much more hard to pinpoint than, let's say Fe, because it is an introverted function.  However, I think it's safe to say that many people with dominant Ni have a penchant for conversing about extremely futuristic concepts—y'know, things flung into the very, very distant future...things that probably want to make you gouge your eyeballs out because of how far away they are from present reality.  I would also like to think that Ni-dominants would be immersed in their long-winding, typically abstract ideas, but unlike Ne, Ni isn't one for spewing out such things on whim.  Sorry if this didn't really help and that it's all worded really strangely, haha...but I'd be happy to clarify anything if you need me to do so!!"
mbti,3avze9,nyctanthous,2,Wed Jun 24 03:09:37 2015 UTC,"To further your mentioning of the reluctance of Ni doms to speak their ideas near as easily as Ne doms; I forgot where I read it but I believe it was a quote from Nietzsche about how he had various images and symbols and feeling floating around in his head for a while, and then at some point everything would come together with no prompting required. Everything would just flow from his mind to his page, and once he started writing his ideas practically built upon themselves.   So I guess the difference to be gleaned here is that Ne, being an extroverted function, would spew their connections etc on a whim while Ni lets it build up, does the Ni-branded unconscious processing, and then the idea seems to explode into a physical form in whatever way of expression is deemed appropriate."
mbti,3avze9,_mildude,6,Fri Jun 26 22:02:33 2015 UTC,"For the INTJ side at least, I find a quote about Heraclitus the celebritytypes crew have in his profile a good distillation:  ""Heraclitus does not demonstrate but manifest; he does not discuss ... but weaves an image.""

""[They] do not deal with things in a logical way, going into the intellectual process of elucidation.

I almost think of it like Ni as digital speaking and Si as analog speaking.   If anyone watches Korean LCK League of Legends streams, you know of the shoutcasters MonteCristo (ENTJ) and Doa (ESTJ). Monte speaks with judgement and clarity word-by-word and is always thinking about what the team is setting up to do later in the game. Doa has a much warmer and fluid feel to his speaking, while going on more about what happened previously and how those past interactions in the game went down.

However, I'm not sure I've noticed specific slurring of words, from him or form other Si doms I know.

Full game showing the differences in what they talk about during a game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO9SoPEGBFk  I think it partially has to do with word choice.

It doesn't make sense on a theoretical level and doesn't hold any water in real life either.  Keirsey is a horrible source when it comes to typology especially with regard to Sending types, which he regards as inferior. I am constantly puzzled by how much traction Keirsey's ideas seem to have in the Jungian typology community given that he explicitly disavows Jungian ideas about cognition (i.e. no functions). Some of Keirsey's descriptions are empirically okay-ish but when you try to extend his ideas beyond that they break down completely."

mbti,3aur6p,Meljin,7,Tue Jun 23 17:49:41 2015 UTC,"TL/DR: The tests aren't very good.  Ideally, the tests shouldn't be asking which actions you'd take, but instead what your reasoning would be for the action you take.  Do you... a) tell b/c it would be inauthentic of you to hide it and you would be unable to bear such a dark secret within yourself b) not tell b/c it would wound those you hold dearest c) tell in order to prevent it from happening again d) not tell b/c there is nothing to gain from exposing it e) tell b/c violating standards and rules should have consequences f) not tell b/c it is wrong to undermine your own family g) tell b/c the secret is causing harm and only by everyone coming together can it be dealt with h) not tell b/c it would cause strife and discord  These are my very hurried examples of Fi/Ti/Te/Fe decisions, so I apologize if they're not very good. Nevertheless, you can see that either T or F can come to the exact same conclusion on what to do, but it's the reasoning behind it that matters. Another problem is that most people could relate to many of these answers, so it's hard to decide which would be most accurate. It would be better to have open questions instead of multiple choice, but that would have to be interpreted by an actual person. It's hard to have accurate tests.  *Oh, and also everyone uses both T and F, so it would be better to try to determine if a person uses the Ti/Fe axis or the Te/Fi axis as opposed to T vs F."
mbti,3aur6p,kalg,3,Tue Jun 23 20:56:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the answer, it is very interesting. In this case, why are tests still and (almost?) exclusively focusing on a Likert scale rather than this kind of system?"
mbti,3aur6p,MonsieurGadfly,4,Tue Jun 23 22:47:41 2015 UTC,"Because MBTI as we know it is actually an offshoot of Jung's system of typology. Myers and Briggs deliberately streamlined it to make it more accessible to the average person but in the process made the error of assuming behavior is an adequate measure of cognition.   As a result, the tests are based on the popular version which is usually the first interaction people have the system and where their opinions and biases are initially developed."

Recently there are a couple tests that (by a very small margin) give me INFP result, even though I am an INTP, and I think this is the reason.  Their questions dichotomized this, as if I cannot be a thinker who -- for example -- quite rationally and logically cares about keeping harmony in little things for the sake of moving forward with bigger things.  Also, I do have Fe, even though it is my inferior function, so I am sensitive to how others are feeling and not apt to disregard it entirely."

I have facial piercings, some tattoos, I used to dye my hair bright colours for years, and I have a strict dresscode: all black. To be fair, I do wear mismatched socks out of laziness everyday and that is an INTP stereotyped trait.  Other INTPs seem to be rather put off by tattoos first off, there was a thread one day and everyone said they were too permanent for them to feel comfortable. Other INTPs seem to not care as much about exactly how they look, as long as they look ""ok"". I'm not meticulous, like I don't feel I have to do my hair or makeup to go out, I just....have a gothic image that I enjoy and feel I must maintain to be authentic to myself."
mbti,3atknm,u1tr4me0w,6,Tue Jun 23 15:16:31 2015 UTC,"From what i understand, we actually like to have an aesthetic. I hear it's ENTPs who tend to look a little disheveled. Maybe the INTPs who don't care about their looks aren't in a healthy place; I know when I'm stressed out, I tend to put less effort into my appearance. That being said, we may have a preferred aesthetic, but we may not be great at pulling it off, or we may like a style of dress that isn't necessarily trendy/socially appropriate.   For me, I really like those stoner/skater tshirts you get at places like Zumies, Tilly's, PacSun, etc. I like tight jeans, but then I top it all off with hiking shoes! Or I wear a hat that doesn't quite go with everything else :P I wear clothes that please me, and if I happen to cultivate a look with my clothes, it's a happy coincidence. I also want people to think I'm cool, but I know I just come off as a stoner nerd.  As far as tattoos, I have 2. I really want more. Tattoos are self expression, and INTPs want to be authentic to themselves in general. I can see why some of us feel nervous about getting a tat that they may end up not liking later down the road - our interests change over time. We don't want to be inauthentic to our future selves. Some of us, like me, don't mind if our interests change and our tattoos no longer represent our present selves because they tell a story of our past (or at least, that's how I think of it).   TL;DR you're a normal INTP."

I formed my view based on a very limited discussion with the /r/INTP crowd, so I must have just been interacting with people who aren't feeling the best."
mbti,3atknm,u1tr4me0w,3,Tue Jun 23 20:27:25 2015 UTC,"Your comment sparked a long stream of consciousness and I'm sorry.  Ive been questioning whether or not I'm an INTP or an ENTP or and INFJ for a while now, and this may be an interesting article of evidence in favor of INTP. I've been a regular reader of fashion forums for a long time now. When I started changing how I dressed in high school is also when one of my friends followed my example, and lo and behold he's actually an INTP. Eh, statistically I'm probably not an INFJ anyway.   Another thing though is what appears to be the difference in how logical I am versus the only other confirmed INTP I know. Maybe I've learned how to turn Ti off when I need to, having grown up with a single mother ESFJ? plus my dad is an ISFJ. I think I've mostly ruled out being an Si dom however, plus I'm interested in and am not bothered by wearing clothing that makes me stand out in ways that  an ISFJ would never dare (though that may be stereotype).   I think what this comment amounts to is you watching me come to conclusions about my thought process as I write. I just realized what I've written so far would be a prime example of a small Ne rant. If I get in the right mood, it could probably be much worse than this.   Oh, one more thing just for funsies, I have a problem with getting meta in my perception of myself. I sometimes start laughing at myself randomly because I accidentally step back and look at the big picture of my situation and it's really ironic/fitting because I've done something stupid or the world is weird. Hope this didn't annoy you, but that is why I doubt my currently labeled type and am moving toward INTP in a nutshell."

I actually love structure...I just need a little freedom. No micro-management. But if I don't have structure, I won't get anything done. I also like plans and often plan ahead. I don't like when my plans get changed by anybody except myself. But because I live in the moment...I often don't follow my plans.  Example: If someone wants to hang out...I usually need 24 hours notice, possibly more. But if the plans I had only affect me...I'll get annoyed if someone else tries to get involved, but I often change my mind. (I planned to watch a movie...but I felt like playing video games instead, so I did that.)  I think it all boils down to living in the moment. Structure is nice because it keeps me from being lazy. And I like to do what I want, when I want...and if i planned on being alone, especially, it totally throws me off to change those plans.  Sorry if that doesn't make sense...I know I tend to ramble. Which I believe is another not-so-ISFP trait."

Regardless of all these points which would turn the typical person away from guessing ESTJ for themselves (99% of people I know who know MBTI would never type me as ESTJ), I use those four functions in that order, or maybe the introverted variant, without a doubt.

His work has never been empirically validated like the MBTI but I've found it to be more accurate (including the works of Myers, Von Franz, Van der Hoop, Celebritytypes) and certainly it enriches the 16 personality types of MBTI"
mbti,3aun39,toyouitsjustwords,4,Tue Jun 23 19:39:34 2015 UTC,"It's completely normal to get different results from the tests - their consistency is a tad poor, besides which they just tell you what you tell them and how you answer can depend on things like mood and varies a bit just day by day. Most people are also expected to have only mild preferences on the four dimensions so it's expected for the result to fluctuate a bit.  For some background information, there's two main ways to assign yourself a type:  The first is assigning yourself four letters by taking a test (or doing it yourself), the second figuring out what cognitive functions (~=go-to habits for taking in, evaluating and organizing information) you use. Both give you the same kind of code because the approaches have a lot of shared history, but the meaning behind the code is different because of how it's arrived at. Using a test to get a code and then look what kind of functions you're supposed to use from that is usually a bad idea (for example, I often get IxTP results from tests - this would mean I use Ti, which I don't - I'm a very clear Te type). Despite being different, both of these approaches give you valuable information but should be kept separate because they mean very, very different things.  The test ranks you on four different scales that are more or less separate from each other - ie. your score on one shouldn't influence your score on the others much at all. Having only a slight preference here is normal, and pretty much expected. The test results tend to fluctuate a good bit as well.  What the test letters mean, roughly: I/E = introverted/extroverted. Do you like being out and about, esp. around people. N/S = Abstract-minded or concrete person. F/T = Do you reason more on sentiment and good/bad type of judgment or in a cold, detached way. The F items put a good deal of weight on being accomodating (ie. something the functions approach would term extroverted Feeling, Fe) P/J = How organized, scheduled, conscientious you are. The more P, the more disorganized and spontaneous, the more J, the more organized and planned.      The other way is to figure out what functions you use.  The functional approach is a rough model that tries to explain how you take in, evaluate and organize information by dividing the information processing into four core processes (Thinking, Feeling, Sensing and iNtuition) each of which has two attitudes (ie. extraversion, or interest in the external world, and introversion, ie. interest in what is going on inside your head) and then figuring out which processes you use in what attitudes. They're often shortened to a function code of Core process and Attitude, ie. Sensing in the extroverted attitude = Se.  Two examples would be an inclination to use the Thinking function focusing more on personal models (introverted Thinking, Ti) and their accuracy or the state of the outside world or analyzed system (extroverted Thinking, Te) and exerting control over it, or using Feeling to focus more on the harmony of the group (extroverted Feeling, Fe) or being true to yourself (introverted Feeling, Fi).  Test ENTP v. ENTJ, for example, is basically asking whether the person is more haphazard and spontaneous or more planned, conscientious and orderly - it's directly what the tests measure and the types differ only on one scale.  In Function-land, where we look at how the person takes in, evaluates and organizes information, the meaning is different. Here we find that ENTPs and ENTJs use an entirely different set of processes:  ENTPs are primarily watchers who lead with extroverted Intuition (Ne) - it's an exploring, brainstorming kind of process that draws its inspiration from the outside world and is very interested in it, and complement that with Ti - an evaluating process that focuses on building accurate mental models of things. How the cogs turn is more important than what that turning accomplishes.  ENTJs lead with extroverted Thinking or Te - cold, detached reasoning like Ti, but focused on evaluating the properties of the outside world and exerting control over it, usually with the aim of ordering it to be more efficient. They complement this with introverted Intuition, which in contrast to Ne's curious exploration just drinks in tons of information and subconsciously finds patterns in there that it then condenses it into a holistic understanding of how something ticks that the Ni type himself often needs to work to ""map out"".  In short, they're totally different :D  Same applies to INTP vs. INFP - in test-land the difference is a slight preference to Thinking or Feeling type items in the questionnaire, but in Function-land an INTPs primary processes are Ti (dominant/compulsive) and Ne (auxiliary/habitual), while INFPs lead with Fi and use Ne as auxiliary - they share the habitual process and their dominant function is introspective, evaluative in nature so their minds are kind of similar in construction, but the compulsive, dominant process is different which is a very large change."

No test is going to be 100% accurate, especially when we're talking about that variances in personality because a lot of the time, the mindsets/moods you're taking the test affect the way you answer. The best way to find out which type is most accurate for you is to observe/understand how you look at things and work (which the tests may help with or guide you in a certain direction) and then understand what you don't do. It's really about self-knowledge in the end."

mbti,3auv2w,ScalSaver,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:09:14 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't really trust the test in the sense of taking it as your type. To explain it the long way:  There's two main ways to assign yourself a type.  The first is assigning yourself four letters by taking a test (or doing it yourself), the second figuring out what cognitive functions (~=go-to habits for taking in, evaluating and organizing information) you use. Both give you the same kind of code because the approaches have a lot of shared history, but the meaning behind the code is different because of how it's arrived at. Using a test to get a code and then look what kind of functions you're supposed to use from that is usually a bad idea (for example, I often get IxTP results from tests - this would mean I use Ti, which I don't - I'm a very clear Te type). Despite being different, both of these approaches give you valuable information but should be kept separate because they mean very, very different things.  The test ranks you on four different scales that are more or less separate from each other - ie. your score on one shouldn't influence your score on the others much at all. Having only a slight preference here is normal, and pretty much expected. The test results tend to fluctuate a good bit as well.  What the test letters mean, roughly: I/E = introverted/extroverted. Do you like being out and about, esp. around people. N/S = Abstract-minded or concrete person. F/T = Do you reason more on sentiment and good/bad type of judgment or in a cold, detached way. The F items put a good deal of weight on being accomodating (ie. something the functions approach would term extroverted Feeling, Fe) P/J = How organized, scheduled, conscientious you are. The more P, the more disorganized and spontaneous, the more J, the more organized and planned.      The other way is to figure out what functions you use.  The functional approach is a rough model that tries to explain how you take in, evaluate and organize information by dividing the information processing into four core processes (Thinking, Feeling, Sensing and iNtuition) each of which has two attitudes (ie. extraversion, or interest in the external world, and introversion, ie. interest in what is going on inside your head) and then figuring out which processes you use in what attitudes. They're often shortened to a function code of Core process and Attitude, ie. Sensing in the extroverted attitude = Se.  Two examples would be an inclination to use the Thinking function focusing more on personal models (introverted Thinking, Ti) and their accuracy or the state of the outside world or analyzed system (extroverted Thinking, Te) and exerting control over it, or using Feeling to focus more on the harmony of the group (extroverted Feeling, Fe) or being true to yourself (introverted Feeling, Fi).  Test ENTP v. ENTJ, for example, is basically asking whether the person is more haphazard and spontaneous or more planned, conscientious and orderly - it's directly what the tests measure and the types differ only on one scale.  In Function-land, where we look at how the person takes in, evaluates and organizes information, the meaning is different. Here we find that ENTPs and ENTJs use an entirely different set of processes:  ENTPs are primarily watchers who lead with extroverted Intuition (Ne) - it's an exploring, brainstorming kind of process that draws its inspiration from the outside world and is very interested in it, and complement that with Ti - an evaluating process that focuses on building accurate mental models of things. How the cogs turn is more important than what that turning accomplishes.  ENTJs lead with extroverted Thinking or Te - cold, detached reasoning like Ti, but focused on evaluating the properties of the outside world and exerting control over it, usually with the aim of ordering it to be more efficient. They complement this with introverted Intuition, which in contrast to Ne's curious exploration just drinks in tons of information and subconsciously finds patterns in there that it then condenses it into a holistic understanding of how something ticks that the Ni type himself often needs to work to ""map out"".  In short, they're totally different :D  Same applies to INTP vs. INFP - in test-land the difference is a slight preference to Thinking or Feeling type items in the questionnaire, but in Function-land an INTPs primary processes are Ti (dominant/compulsive) and Ne (auxiliary/habitual), while INFPs lead with Fi and use Ne as auxiliary - they share the habitual process and their dominant function is introspective, evaluative in nature so their minds are kind of similar in construction, but the compulsive, dominant process is different which is a very large change."
mbti,3auv2w,Komatik,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:16:17 2015 UTC,"There has been a lot of research on this topic and the general consensus is that personality is pretty stable but not necessarily completely unchanging.

mbti,3auv2w,TI_Pirate,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:53:42 2015 UTC,"Well,of course our personalities change over time,but your overall functions stay the same,only with more or less development throughout your life.  ""Functions"" are very abstract/complex. Its not just ""Yeah,Te does this and Si does this. If you don't do X or act like X you're not an Y."" -- when working with functions,you need to look at the mindset behind each function,and how that mindset works with other functions which also have their own mindset.  Your functions are basically how your brain works.  Dom. would be how your brain perceives the information.  Aux. would be what your brain does with the information.  Tert. would be the function that bring balance between your second and first,the one that gets you going.  And your inferior function would be your weakest spot. What (when dealing with new information) your brain/mind handles the worst.  So when you say that your personality changes over time,yes,it does,but that's just the product of your new everyday experiences,new information,new people you meet,new challenges,new rises or falls,in short - life.  And when looking at your overall personality,you need to look at the inner workings of that personality.  But your functions,aka. how your brain is wired,stays the same.

mbti,3auv2w,Komatik,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:02:47 2015 UTC,I don't know if this is accurate but I've always tended to think the outer letters were more flexible than the inner ones - as predicated by birth order and family environment.   So. Say your an extrovert but childhood trauma sent you inward and you started spending a lot of time in your room. Or you might be more naturally inclined to be a P but then you got younger siblings and responsibilities that led you to have to be more decisive and value that.   Whereas we're more born T-hinkers and F-eelers that deal with the big picture (N) or details (S) better.

But after I turned like 15 I became SO sensitive and even if you yell at me I'll cry. Also I think I'm prone to depression but never been diagnosed. I've gone to like 3 psychologists troughout my life but never really told them anything until the last one. To whom I opened up a bit more. I get months in which I'm super happy and others in which I just feel sad all the time. I think this is why I can't fit myself into one type.

I try to be optimistic and even before I found Jesus, when I used to cut myself I always thought I'd never commit suicide becuase I felt it was dumb, so was I being feeling because I cut myself but thinking because I wouldn't consider suicide?

There are plenty of Es that ""hate people"". In your quiet solitude, are you prone to doing things that feed your mind via intake of things visual, written, or thought? The extraverts I know prefer to interact with the outside world, like organizing something or talking on forums with other people.  Also, if you are an ENTP, if it began when your started high school, emotions flaring up more make sense because your Fe is starting to develop more (Ts generally become a little more aware of what they feel). I would recommend reading Lenore Thomson's descriptions (it is a lengthy read though). Additionally, Ne is prone to optimism: it looks at something and never sees just that thing, it sees what else it could be, and what else could be there, what it could fit in, etc."

Why I think so (excuse my rambling, lazy to edit):   She's always concerned about how she and Frank appears to others (what they wear and the results of their actions). She seems to think every detail matters, whereas he understands this but doesn't prioritize it. He does whatever it takes and whatever works, regardless of image (unless it has to do with his public image to citizens).  She gets personally hurt when her image is attacked whereas Frank has an easier time not giving a shit. Although as the show progresses, we see Claire becoming more like Frank in being forceful with what she wants (threatening people).  She is more of a team player in their relationship than Frank is. She's the one to point out that Frank is pushing his own goals. She always uses ""we"" and Frank slips out a few ""I""s. She postpones her own goals because it was logically optimal for their marriage - for her husband's image by taking on the wife role. She does this with less of a fight, even though inside it's not what she wants. I just don't see Frank as likely to sacrifice his own goals in this same way... She also seems to be brooding hatred for Frank underneath that calm exterior, yet she'll only expose herself at the right time. Frank would be less sensitive, more upfront in demanding/threatening what he wants from her. They both have self-interest but they go about it differently. Claire plays it harmonious up until the point she pounces on someone (leaves Frank just like that). Frank gives less of a shit about external harmony; he just wants what he wants.  Frank saids so himself that Claire knows him better than he knows himself. This is very typical of INFJs in long-term relationships. Claire is interested in understanding him, hearing him out. Frank, on the other hand, doesn't care about understanding / hearing Claire if there isn't anything actionable that can come out of it (their argument about the gay activist in Russia).  She naturally appreciates art without needing a reason (ie. Crane, Tibetan monk's creation, Adam's work). It's almost like she naturally has an artistic view of life. Her perspective isn't cut-throat straightforward, factual like Frank's, although she can be when she needs to be. I get a sense that she sees the grays, the design, the beauty in life. This part of her seems to be deprived when with Frank, yet overfilled when she is with Adam for too long. She appears to be a 50% art / 50% science type of person. She chooses science or ""disciplined structure"" (Frank) but then art oozes out of every part of her (presentation/style, how she navigates her relationships naturally and harmoniously, etc). I think this is tied to the Fe/Ti axis."

Both Jack and Ari like for the other person to know that they were defeated, they will usually force the other persons hand and both parties will know it when they win. Frank on the other hand likes to do things on an emotional level and generally the other person won't feel like they lost, at the end, they both will feel like they got what they wanted or Frank's opponent thinks he actually won."
mbti,3as7uq,trex88,3,Tue Jun 23 05:44:02 2015 UTC,"That's an excellent observation, but the ability to be emotionally manipulative does not necessarily point to Fe rather than Te. I would actually argue that someone with Fe would have a harder time being coldly manipulative because they are in touch with the people they are influencing.  ENTJs are basically known for manipulating emotions to get what they want. It requires more maturity to control well and not be 'obvious' as you pointed out, and that has to do with the development of Ni and especially Se. ENTJs are able to observe emotions without being influenced by them, and the Te is tailored to work most effectively based on others emotions.  Lord Baelish in Game of thrones is similarly considered an ENTJ and is adept at manipulating emotions.

mbti,3aslj5,thorgom,15,Tue Jun 23 04:23:50 2015 UTC,"You say your piece once, respect that they have a right to make their own decision and have survived thus far, and then you let them deal with the consequences. Because they are adults.   You really can't trump your parents on this. It's a part of ass wiping syndrome. Any one that wipes your ass once for any reason, immediately trumps you in decision making power for the rest of your life, until you wipe their ass for some reason. Then you trump them.  So if you really want to get stuff across to parents that suffer from ""I wiped your ass"" syndrome, you must make them think that it was their idea. And then be humble and let them have it with out complaint."
mbti,3aslj5,BasicBarbarian,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:40:19 2015 UTC,"You have a good point, but when they fall into financial issues, they'll ask me for a couple thousand for this or that, so I also have to live with their bad decisions…. And I would wish that the ass wiping syndrome would work for my benefit in this case, but they still believe that since I sleep in their house, then I should give up my rights. Just pushing through… I've got like a year left and I'll be out with a 100k/year job and my own place! It's just that the road to that point has been very frustrating on my part.    make them think that it was their idea   I need to put more work into implementing things like this."
mbti,3aslj5,MonsieurGadfly,14,Wed Jun 24 03:20:45 2015 UTC,"I disagree that it's a sensor/intuitor thing and is more like the brand of stubbornness /u/BasicBarbarian is describing.  My father is an ESTP who has a similar problem with not listening to the warnings that my ISTJ mother gives him but usually listens to my (ENTP) suggestions. The difference is that my mother is very commanding (""you should do this instead"") and will try to forcefully change his mind while I just make passing suggestions (""btw, you could also do this"") and leave him to figure out how he wants to tackle it.   Some people are just really stubborn and the more pressure you put on them, the more rigid they become. Sometimes you just have to let people fail and learn from the errors though. Not everyone can be helped unfortunately."
mbti,3aslj5,TurtleSmile1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:10:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that most of my family isn't very open minded, whether that is because of their MBTI or just the way they are. It's frustrating to me because I think you can't grow if you don't open your mind. Hell, if you never open your mind, you'll barely learn anything at all.  When I feel like I'm dealing with idiots, I get more short in that respect: I don't float suggestions by all nice n stuff. I get more blunt and tell them how things will be and what they need to do. Basically, once I feel like they're idiots, I have a hard time trying to discuss things on equal ground because in my mind, that's not how the playing field is at this point. It's a bad way of thinking, I'm aware of it, and I can usually keep it under control. Recently I let it slip because I'm looking at having to spot them 5 grand because of an impending stupid move they're about to commit and no one wants to drop 5 grand on their parents when they still live at home, going to college.   Some people are just really stubborn and the more pressure you put on them, the more rigid they become.    Exactly, I experience this all the time. I'll ask something like, ""Why would you do this?"" They say, ""Because we're the parents."" And I think, ""Umm… that doesn't even count as an answer besides saying, 'You won but we won't admit it.'""  I'm all for them learning from their failure, I just don't like paying the price for their stupidity! haha  Btw, an ESTP dad? That sounds like a very interesting family paradigm. My parents are ISJs and that's just what I know…."
mbti,3aslj5,TurtleSmile1,5,Wed Jun 24 03:31:09 2015 UTC,"My parents are both sensors. I think they're both ISFJ, actually. It's very difficult because they care a ton about feeling and if they don't feel like I came to them with a gentle spirit, they'll get really offended and scurry away. Anyway, I cope by not worrying about what they do. They're gonna do them, and our relationship will suffer dramatically as a result. That sucks, but I can't change them. I let them make their own stupid mistakes time and time again and try to limit my time with them. I still live with them, so it's hard, but it's doable."
mbti,3aslj5,Rixe,2,Tue Jun 23 05:59:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. Do you deal with ISTJs much? I've noticed that the ISTJs I've been around have huge Fi problems which oftentimes makes them like INFPs (with super underdeveloped Ne) which makes them just lovely to deal with.  I feel your pain: I think I'm ENTP and my family sees me as a heartless asshole. Yesterday I told my dad, ""It's like your head's buried in the sand,"" because he refused to see this trend they keep running into. He got so mad at me, shut the door on me, and refused to talk to me the whole day.    scurry away   Yep, even the ISTJs I know will do that.  My biggest issue with their financial mistakes is then they ask for money from me to help out with whatever situation they're facing. That just makes me mad because then I suffer, too, because they wouldn't listen. Otherwise I would like to just sit back and laugh as, /u/Rixe put it, ""like headless chickens"".  Do you ever try to be yourself around them then?"

However, my brother is INFP, and probably the closest person to me in my life. He's great. A fantastic human.         That's really frustrating that you are expected to help out financially after they make poor financial decisions. Yes, I have ""been myself"" around them before, and it doesn't usually go well. I've told my parents, in the context of family counselling, that I think they're distant from each other and my dad got defensive immediately.     ""It's like your head's buried in the sand""     I don't think that's a helpful thing to say to any person. I think a more helpful approach would be to state your claim as an, ""I think"" instead of an ""it's like"". It can help a lot. ""I don't think you're seeing the full picture"" or ""Is there a chance you are being short sighted in this?"" is going to be received MUCH better by your dad than telling him his head is in the sand."

He's hardly ever at home. He and I used to be best friends but he's gone through a lot and is currently in this unhealthy Fi-Si loop. He's barely the same INFP I knew growing up…. But yeah, they can be really awesome. I've known some INFPs that suck too though.  I know, I shouldn't have said it, especially in retrospect. It was more that my frustration came through. I told him about these events and how they form a pattern. He agreed with the events and admitted that have been recurring. I then asked, ""Do you see the pattern then?"" He said, ""No, you can't know that there's a pattern."" It's like I'm living with someone suffering from irrational skepticism. But yes, you couldn't be more right about this."
mbti,3aslj5,Poltron,5,Wed Jun 24 03:12:45 2015 UTC,I think the question is better asked as how do I live as a normal person in a house full of idiots.  Suggest they use Google instead of running around like headless chickens.
mbti,3aslj5,plonk519,2,Tue Jun 23 10:24:34 2015 UTC,"That's hilarious!   They will never to think of Google. My parents will go into town and buy a book or buy a book an Amazon before they consider the Google machine.   All those SJs will be upstairs, talking about something stupid (obviously), pondering something trivial. I'll hear the question, whip out my phone and have the answer within seconds. It took them years before they started to pick up on this trend – that their questions might be answered on the internet – because someone might have had the same question.  But they think I'm ridiculous! ""Why does it [philosophy] matter?"" ""Why does this it [scientific discovery/innovative technology] matter?""    I feel like I'm in prison, everyday of my life. And since I sold my shitty car, I can't drive theirs because ""it could get a scratch in the parking lot""."
mbti,3aslj5,aNinjaWithAIDS,3,Tue Jun 23 12:53:43 2015 UTC,I'm a bit annoyed that you're conflating their lack of curiosity with being an SJ.

mbti,3aslj5,aNinjaWithAIDS,3,Wed Jun 24 01:02:47 2015 UTC,"Damn, that sounds terrible :( sorry man.  I don't know if I have an SJ family myself. Ironically despite being ESTJ they think I'm weird. I know my brother definitely isn't SJ. Probably INTP.   See thing is everyone else is so emotional compared to me. Moody. I don't really know their types very well. My mum is the only one who isn't as emotional. She's tested as INFJ/P but I can't be sure of that. My dad likes to say he's logical but the volume of his voice doesn't make him more right. I'd peg him as INFP. He comes across as ESTJ but Te-dom isn't nearly as rabid and tumultuous. He has very firm convictions that he'll keep private. Because man. My sister is ISTJ. We're similar but she's a much harder worker and is much more on the straight and narrow.  Point being I've no idea what types my family are but only me, my sister and my brother can actually Google. :p"
mbti,3aslj5,fingurdar,2,Tue Jun 23 14:16:04 2015 UTC,"everyone else is so emotional compared to me   This is a problem I come across on a regular basis.

Point being I've no idea what types my family are but only me, my sister and my brother can actually Google. :p   Hahaha priceless! I'm by no means saying SJs can't use… the Google. I'm just interweaving my frustrations with SJs in with my frustrations with my family members in general... I do, however, think that unhealthily favoring Si can prevent good change in people's lives, e.g., using new technologies."
mbti,3aslj5,Odditys,5,Wed Jun 24 01:50:54 2015 UTC,"As an ISTJ, my two cents.  Explain them WHY you think this will happen ( important ), that you'll respect the decisions they make, but won't pay the price for them if they chose to not even acknowledge what you have to say. I think it's important to clearly define that ( by telling them, even writing it if you want ) before a choice is made and/or before the event occurs. They should honor their commitment if it's clearly defined before and agreed by both sides.  Also, prepare your arguments and the debate that will follow. Don't just jump from ideas to ideas and VOILA. If your decision is better, then, you must have a plan to put it in action, right ? If not, I don't see why it's better. It's an hypothetical better solution. Not a REALITY-TESTIFIED better solution. It isn't worth anything ( I'm exagerating, but you should see the point ). You also know the flaws of your plan but its advantages too. Consider doing a mix of both your decision and theirs if possible.  Try the feeling approach too. Tell them you feel like they're treating you as a baby, not even considering your opinion. If they still treat you as one, then maybe consider acting like an adult to earn their respect ( no offense intended ). If someone I know really, really is a mess, I won't even think about considering their opinion. By acting like an adult I mean, act responsibly. Take care of yourself and your professional life. Impress them by taking care of your needs as much as you can, don't rely on them.  If nothing works, it doesn't matter whether they are SJs or NPs, that's just their problem."
mbti,3aslj5,plonk519,3,Tue Jun 23 14:39:45 2015 UTC,"If someone I know really, really is a mess, I won't even think about considering their opinion.    While completely understandable in most contexts, this is still technically an ad hominem logical fallacy. What should matter is the substance and reasoning behind the advice, not the personal circumstances of the individual giving it. But I can see how that would fall under the ""do as I say, not as I do"" umbrella."
mbti,3aslj5,plonk519,2,Tue Jun 23 22:22:51 2015 UTC,A very good point and a source for my frustration. You nailed it.
mbti,3aslj5,plonk519,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:41:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I think that'll be helpful.    I won't even think about considering their opinion   That's good to know. I'm doing really well though – help out at the church, work at Lockheed Martin, finishing up a compsci degree, blah, blah, blah. It's more that they just never liked me much, growing up.   that's just their problem   That very much might be their problem…  Thanks for the advice!

mbti,3aslj5,plonk519,7,Wed Jun 24 01:40:19 2015 UTC,"And then it happens – it comes to pass: I am right! They can't even catch on to the trend of me anticipating events. I write them down and show them and they don't think much of it...   This is the big reason why I don't like dealing with SJ's in general. They can get cocky and think they're right all the time. So when something does go wrong, they refuse to admit it to keep their insecure sense of being in control when they actually aren't. Oh, but get this: if anybody else from the other temperaments gets cocky and turns out to be in the wrong, these guys have ""the perfect reason"" to look down on that someone else! SJ's at their worst tend to be walking plagues of hypocrisy who refuse to realize that they're making more problems than solutions. I'm sure you can agree with this sentiment.   My question to you guys is how do you cope with this?   In all honestly, you can't fix stupid, especially when combined with stubborn and arrogant. If they won't accept your help and advice, save yourself some stress and do not give it to them. Once they come to you for advice, that's your cue that they've finally begun to become wise; help them then with the smuggest smile you can muster. Your confidence would shoot for the stars at that point, and it will be worth the wait."

If I'm ever even slightly off, I'll get shit for it; but they're never even slightly right. Typically, they fall back on their lower Ne and can't make up their minds on what will happen in the future, if they deign to guess.   Quote from my ISTJ brother when I was predicting the future the other day: ""Well, that's so far in the future so you shouldn't worry about it. Who cares?"" Far in the future? We're talking 6-12 months from now.    insecure sense of being in control when they actually aren't   You're on fire haha. That sounds like my childhood, dealing with my parents. You're right about it all.  Any experience in arguing with SJs?  Haha okay, thanks for that, I'll try waiting it out.

mbti,3ar9ke,Lynac,8,Mon Jun 22 21:43:59 2015 UTC,I would put ISTJ for Moss just because I can't think of any other type that might try to read the UK and US Harry Potter books and check them both for spelling inconsistencies or whatever he was trying to do.

mbti,3at34v,MonsieurGadfly,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:11:38 2015 UTC,Definitely.
mbti,3at34v,SwagSea,2,Wed Jun 24 05:35:56 2015 UTC,"I think he was some type of Ni Se Te Fi.   He couldn't stick to a predetermined, set style of fighting. Instead, he took the best out of each style he knew. Taking multiple things, and fitting them together until they converge at a singularity suggests Ni. Ne wouldn't work that way. Ne would work in the opposite direction. Ne would take a specific aspect of fighting, and develop multiple styles around that.  I say he's Fi because his value judgements never depended on external factors. If you listen to his interviews, he talks about how much he hates mob mentalities, referring to them as different ""dogmas"". He'll talk about the ""dogma"" of only identifying with in martial arts style, for example. The idea that you can't make value judgements based on the outside world, and that only you, as an individual, can determine that suggests that Brice Lee was Fi."
mbti,3at34v,JellyDynomite,2,Tue Jun 23 13:37:35 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree.  I think he's Ti Se Ni Fe (ISTP).  While you said he did take the best out of each style he knew, ISTP's generally like to master their craft, hence the Ti, which was for him was Martial Arts. Ti's are also about trying to maintain and find balance internally while trying to converge it out externally, which suits his ''Be like Water'' theory which suits his Se.   Taking multiple things, and fitting them together until they converge at a singularity suggests Ni.   This I agree, and you can see he's done that with his martial arts.  He also has Fe which is suppressed. Extraverted Feeling function allows a person to adjust their behavior to the needs of others. It is the ability to relate and the desire to connect with others with warmth and consideration. It draws others out and responds to expressed or unexpressed needs.  This is evident as fuck when Jackie Chan was interviewed on how Bruce Lee hit him so hard that after the scene was shot he ran to Jackie Chan and was extremely apologetic.  Still don't agree fellow ENFP?  Here be some sources n*gga:  http://www.celebritytypes.com/istp.php https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55LmENGRd58"

mbti,3ar50f,Splinoself,10,Mon Jun 22 20:58:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm Te because I very much think out loud, and jump from idea to idea while talking.    This is wrong.  That's Ne.  Te can be like that, but it's not defined by being so.  Te is more about a desire to implement order in the external world.  Te is good at organising and doing.   For that same reason, jumping from idea to idea and not sticking to one, is why I think I'm Ne.   That's typical of Ne.   I think I'm Fe because I care more about how others are feeling than I do about how I'm feeling, and if others aren't having a good time then I won't have a good time.   That's about right for Fe.   I think I'm Si mostly because I'm not athletic, and not interested in physical type things.   This isn't really how you define Si.  It seems like you've gone ""I'm not Se, therefore I'm Si"" and it doesn't work like that.  Si is all about internal memory and recall.  Good with memory, value tradition and use past events as a basis for navigating the future.  It doesn't really have anything to do with how athletic you are.  So as it stands, we don't have enough to type you.  Assuming that Ne and Fe are right though, your options are ESFJ, ENTP, INTP & ISFJ.  However in each of those cases we only know one of your dominant or auxiliary functions, never both.  So we need more to work with.  Running with those, your next question is do you align with Ti or Si?  Are you all about understanding how things work and mental mapping, or do you have a great memory and healthy respect for tradition?  If both, which do you rely on more?"
mbti,3ar50f,cyronius,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:39:26 2015 UTC,"Wow this is really great, thank you.   This isn't really how you define Si. It seems like you've gone ""I'm not Se, therefore I'm Si""    That is exactly what I did.  I resonate with ""good with memory"" and ""use past events as a basis for navigating to future"" but not  much at all with ""value tradition""  I like understanding how things work, but often I end up just brushing it off and ignoring how it works because its something so complex that I'd have to spend hours to fully understand how it works.   I think part of that is that I'm not very smart, so while I'd like to understand how complex things work, it ends up not being worth the time and effort."
mbti,3ar50f,cyronius,3,Mon Jun 22 21:46:21 2015 UTC,"So let's say Si and Ti and that your Si is better developed than your Ti.  That leaves ISFJ and ESFJ.  So the next question is do you think your Si or your Fe is your more developed function?  Also with the tradition aspect of Si, think of it more as ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". And the traditions may be your personal traditions, or your families traditions rather than cultural ones. The point is, you're looking to the lessons of the past as a way forward.  Edit - This is all hinged on your Si being more developed than your Ti. If that's not the case, then we're picking between ENTP and INTP..."
mbti,3ar50f,MonsieurGadfly,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:02:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" is definitely true in some cases, although in others I still seek to improve.   I may be thinking about this in the wrong way, but using my computer as an example, even though it works perfectly fine, if there's something I can do to make it run faster that requires a small enough amount of effort in relation to the increase in speed (i.e. I will gladly work all day on my computer if it means that it will run twice as fast, but working all day so that it runs just a bit faster isn't worth it in my eyes) then I'll do it. So I guess if it ain't broke, I still might fix it if I have enough to gain from doing so.  I would tend to say that Fe is my more developed function, but that could easily be because I understand it better. S and T are still less concrete in my mind as to what they are and how they work, so I'll get back to you after I do more research."
mbti,3ar50f,cyronius,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:11:35 2015 UTC,Is there any method to determine which function is more developed other than just thinking about it and deciding which one you feel is more developed.
mbti,3ar50f,Komatik,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:43:45 2015 UTC,Not really. Just a lot of introspection and fleshing out the connection between your thoughts and behaviors. Emphasis on the connection part since there isn't a one to one relationship between them and it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking things like Fe require sociability and harmony or Se requires impulsiveness and aggression.
mbti,3ar50f,Komatik,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:34:03 2015 UTC,"Well, that's what the tests try and do :)  But failing that, it's reading up on them and determining which ones you align with and prefer...  It's really only the first two (maybe three) that matter..."
mbti,3ar50f,owlcandle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:38:01 2015 UTC,"Which one of your primary functions are you more conscious of? The dominant is a pattern our brains do compulsively, the auxiliary is merely habitual - we're typically much more aware of it than we are of our dominant function.  The other good angle is to figure out persistent flaws or character quirks - it's harder to erase these kinds of traits than it is to gain new strengths so they're typically more reliable for typing people, and can point to the inferior function."

The reason old Si types seem traditional is because today's fast-moving world would've essentially moved by them in a sense."
mbti,3ar50f,ThisWontDo,2,Tue Jun 23 10:53:37 2015 UTC,"I would also note that due to the interaction between Ne and Si, Si users rarely think that they are or see themselves as 'habitual', even though we are. I denied it for ages until I really sat down and took a good hard look at how I approach ideas/problems and how I spend my time in a day."

mbti,3ar50f,BadgerKid96,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:38:31 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty confident that I'm introverted. I don't like crowds, I spend time alone to recharge, all that jazz.   Somewhere else in the comments though someone said that someone can be ENTP or ESFJ and still be introverted, as in the jungian context those refer more to the functions and not whether or not you're actually introverted or extroverted."
mbti,3ar50f,ThisWontDo,6,Tue Jun 23 13:10:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm Te because I very much think out loud, and jump from idea to idea while talking   this definitely isn't Te. Actually this sounds like Ne-Ti to me. Seems like you got Fe right, but you also didn't really get Se and Si right. I'm copy and pasting these definitions from the interwebz:  Extraverted Sensing: Acts on concrete data from here and now. Trusts the present, then lets it go.  Introverted Sensing: Compares present facts and experiences to past experience. Trusts the past. Stores sensory data for future use.  I think you're an ENTP."
mbti,3ar50f,ThisWontDo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:12:45 2015 UTC,"I've been watching all of DaveSuperPowers videos, which is where I got that Te was bouncing around from idea to idea. Is he wrong, or did I just misunderstand something?   Seems like you're an ENTP to me.   I'm an introvert, can I still be an ENTP? I don't like crowds, and I recharge by spending time alone."
mbti,3ar50f,Komatik,2,Mon Jun 22 21:16:52 2015 UTC,ENTPs (and also ENFPs) are the more introverted types of the extroverted. Many identify as introverts but have dominant Ne.
mbti,3ar50f,jermofo,2,Mon Jun 22 21:21:25 2015 UTC,Good to know.
mbti,3ar50f,jermofo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:24:13 2015 UTC,"I legitimately thought I had ""well developed"" Te because sometimes I like to think out loud with my ideas and bounce them around but that's more Ne. My Te isn't so developed."
mbti,3ar50f,MrJudzey,2,Mon Jun 22 21:34:04 2015 UTC,"Hmmm yeah that's definitely not a good definition for Te. Te is more about organizing and accomplishing things in an objectively effective and efficient way. It's more fact and reality based while Ti is more subjective.   Hmmm well MBTI is about the cognitive functions, not necessarily introvert-extravert, and I know some ENTPs can be a bit introverted. It's also possible you're an INTP instead though. Are you sure you use Ne and not Ni? You might want to check out Michael Pierce's videos on YouTube. He's not all that engaging but the content is on point."
mbti,3ar50f,Komatik,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:25:21 2015 UTC,"I suppose I could be Ni. This is a /lot/ of info to absorb, so it'll probably take hours of drudging through links until I'm more sure."
mbti,3ar50f,Komatik,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:28:22 2015 UTC,"Oh also, since I was wrong about being Te, could you help me get better definitions of Te and Ti? Even just wherever you got the definitions from Se/Si would be helpful."

mbti,3ar50f,Komatik,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:32:53 2015 UTC,"A Ti type's focus is on the models, theories they build, on having those be good ones. Te thinking is state-based, their ""resting state"" is the state of things around them or of the system being used/observed. Theory is applied to see how to get from state to state. What can be done, what is is more important than the specifics of how it works.  Ti thinking is more about them having a generalized model, someone throws a state as input, machinery whirring, this is where you'll end up, roughly speaking. How it works is more important than what can be done or what is."
mbti,3ar50f,Komatik,3,Tue Jun 23 16:34:05 2015 UTC,"To answer why the combination is not possible, your functional stack is composed of a polar balance between two axes.  You will always have two introverted and two extroverted functions.  You will always have one introverted and one extroverted function for both the judging and perceiving categories.  Each judging or perceiving function has it's opposite function that always is included in your stack, i.e, Ti-Fe, Te-Fi, Ni-Se, and Ne-Si.  So if you look at it this way, to type yourself you just need to figure out which two of these four axes you possess, instead of looking at all eight individually.  Then you have to figure out the order.  It is usually the easiest to identify your first two functions and go from there.  Also looking at your last function is helpful because that will be your problem area or one that you aren't very skilled at.  It will be repressed and operate subconsciously for the most part.  My guess is also ENTP.  You seem to have Ne more prominently in your stack than Si and I'd guess your Fe is not your inferior since you seem more aware of it than an INTP would.  That is just a guess based off of a few sentences, so take it with a grain of salt."
mbti,3ar50f,Komatik,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:50:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for answering, no one else has touched on this yet. I know that the system says you'll always have two introverted and two extroverted functions, I just don't get why that is. What's stopping there from being 3 extroverted functions and 1 introverted, or some other combination other than 2-2."
mbti,3ar50f,Komatik,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:54:53 2015 UTC,"I was paraphrasing from this video from Michael Pierce:  https://youtu.be/unetLukpiV0.  I meant to link the source, but this is the video that really started to explain things in a way that made sense for me.  It helps to think of Ne-Si, for example as one thing instead of two.  The same with Ti-Fe or whatever the combination may be.  So basically you just have two things instead of four, each with introverted and and extroverted side."
mbti,3aq20y,superange128,5,Mon Jun 22 16:08:16 2015 UTC,I think it's usually fairly easy to figure out if a person is Fe or Fi.  This coupled with whether they are introverted or extroverted usually helps me with the process of elimination and at least get them narrowed down to a few possible types first.  This is my usual process of trying to figure out someone's type.
mbti,3aq20y,arsena1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:42:38 2015 UTC,How can you easily tell whether someone is an Fe or Fi user?
mbti,3aq20y,bsmac45,5,Mon Jun 22 20:54:11 2015 UTC,"Fe (extroverted feeling) is attributed to maintaining harmony, making friendly connections with people, and is generally more  collectivist in nature.  Fi (introverted feeling) is mainly attributed with a sense of self-worth, pride, identity and inner definitions of morals and values.  Introverted feeling is a bit more individualistic in nature.  EDIT:  Meant to say extroverted feeling not extroverted thinking 2nd EDIT:  Forgot another one"
mbti,3aq20y,arsena1,2,Mon Jun 22 22:34:18 2015 UTC,"Don't you mean just Introverted/Extroverted Feeling? I don't know how you managed to word the thinking functions into this answer, but it looks very strange if these aren't typos.  Granted, Ti and Fi are both individualistic; but they accomplish that trait differently from each other."

mbti,3aq20y,arsena1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:10:49 2015 UTC,I have these moments all the time; it just depends on whether or not I feel like fixing it. That's the ISTP in me.
mbti,3aq20y,aNinjaWithAIDS,4,Tue Jun 23 00:13:31 2015 UTC,"How can you easily tell whether someone is an Fe or Fi user?    Fe users generally do for others and have a very apparent effect on the atmosphere's tone wherever and whenever they are. Everyone else can feel Fe's emotional weight (and vice-versa) which can gradually or suddenly shift depending on the situation at hand. This is the cognitive function that seeks diverse, yet harmonious communities which thrive if everybody gets along well. When you look at someone with highly developed Fe, expect their faces to animate along with their emotions -- especially around the eyebrows and forehead.   Fi users pretty much hold everything inside which includes (but is not limited to) their values, instincts, motives, and triggers. Their emotional states are displayed either fully on or fully off -- never in between. You don't notice changes to their emotional state so much as ""BANG"", the cat's finally out the bag. Fi users seek very deep, personal, and specialized relationships which they will champion and cherish. Their passions are also very intense, and they will do what's right by themselves despite what other people may say and/or do. When you look at someone with Fi (especially as a well-developed function) you can pretty much see that person's highly defined soul through their eyes.   TLDR: Fe is emotionally proactive and often sparks other people; Fi is emotionally reactive and sparks itself from other people.   Edit: fixed a minor yet weird use of parentheses. Everything else is the same."
mbti,3aq20y,aNinjaWithAIDS,6,Mon Jun 22 22:49:06 2015 UTC,"I have to get a sense, meaning, I don't get too specific, because any one thing out of context, and context here means their entire personality, is insufficient for typing. Carl Jung suggested it's never obvious what type one is.   I begin with the irrational and rational functions, N/S and F/T.  For the irrational, I look for whether they tend to most often revolve around things that are actually present or could be actually present, Sensing, or things that could be possible or have potential, Intuition. Then I look for whether they are usually discussing the meaning of something, interpreting the meaning of things, events, actions, T, or the value of things, actions, etc., F. Then I try to find which is stronger, the irrational N/S or rational F/T.  It's not easy knowing from this whether they are E or I, because thoughts and feelings can nevertheless be objects of experience, E, and not necessarily subjective, I. E/I is more difficult. One has to look beyond the person's interaction with oneself, because their secondary function could be so well developed that it seems to be their primary function, but only come to the forefront because of the interaction, e.g. an INFJ may seem like an E in the midst of an interaction they are fully engaged in. But I look for who they are when not engaging with someone directly. I get the impression that an E finds facing their subjective experience something to fill with external objects of experience, whether physically external or objects of thought/feeling. An Introvert will tend to be more fixed internally, to draw them out seems to give a slight impression of pulling themselves from their inner experience, whereas an extrovert is immediately already there and able to be outside themselves.  Another important but not quite clear determinant is where they get their sense of knowledge from or social norm from. An E will easily adapt to and integrate the social norm with its ideas and morality. An Int will be less likely to adopt or adapt to social norms and morality, choosing to decide from some inner idea. Another aspect related to this is sometimes an E is simply more socially mature than an I. But this becomes more difficult to determine with someone over 35 years of age, or in other words, someone that has had time to develop their non-dominant functions."

A quick question to give you a good guess if I/E seems more obvious: I/E: In quiet time alone, do they prefer to take information in through observation or reflection, or do they take in information by directly interacting and affecting it?"
mbti,3ao9tz,TheoryCat,25,Mon Jun 22 03:45:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know any of the exact details, but this is my read based on the small amount of data here:  This has very little to do with her type; my mom is an INFP and I have the same problem as you. She's your mom, she wants to know about your life, she wants to know about the people you spend time with. When you don't share those things she probably tells you about her life/people in an unconscious hope that you reciprocate. She wants to teach you how to be a better (wo)man. She misses you. She worries about you.  I guess my advice is to indulge her on these things a little bit. (edit) Then bring up the bigger things, when she's feeling more at ease.  Like I said, I'm not there with you and your post isn't super long."
mbti,3ao9tz,WhatINeverSaid,6,Mon Jun 22 04:00:06 2015 UTC,I agree with this. You should open up to your introverted feeling a little more
mbti,3ao9tz,SkulduggeryDude,2,Mon Jun 22 04:39:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. It can be hard for me to open up sometimes and I'm not very comfortable with dealing with my feelings, especially negative feelings, so I try to either fake being positive all the time or not talk or only share happy moments."

She worries about you.   Thank you! I think you're right. When I was living with her, she was much more aware of my life. At the moment, I don't have much to share with her since my life is really bland and routine at the moment. Maybe I'm worried that I will worry her (her health isn't good) if I tell her that my life is boring so I don't share very much. It's really weird because I have no problem talking about my (boring) life with others but I just can't do it with my mom.  Edit:  Now that I think about it, I have problems showing my weaknesses in general, and that partly explains why I feel so lonely sometimes. To love is to be vulnerable, eh? You're right. I need to open up to her more even if it makes her worry about me...    To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable. - C.S. Lewis"

It calls for a bit of thinking.  Other NTs are nice companions, but I'm tired of cold logic. Same for STs. (Especially xSTJs. Brr. Sorry guys.)  Remains FPs And FJs.   INFJs disqualify all the NF. I herd of ENTPs obsession about INFJs too much, and I'm tired of it.  I dream of an ISFJ love interest. And it's sappy as fuck, so no.  ESFJs are bouncy and funny, but ESFPs bouncier and funnier. Hard to choose.  Let's say ESFPs. I don't know any in real life. And I need upbeat unrelenting optimism.  Would be so much joy in this cold and gray world."

But it means that I have to ""recuperate"" all the fun I missed by being serious, and show an unhealthy histrionic ESFP persona for some hours, pulling jokes on jokes and annoy anybody near enough.  Rendered worse by my social awkwardness and attention deficit.  I learnt to achieve some kind of balance, but the wise advices of any SF would be more than welcome."

So confident, so assertive, and their minds, their brains I can just pick through all they and I just love it but I have so much respect for their assertiveness and self-discipline, I just love it. And they can get deeply sensitive connections on my level too if I need it.  I love other ENTPs and ENFPs, we are so amazing to be around and it's really fun but seriously also dangerous because something is gonna explode and we'll both be cheering and running around trying to figure out what to do at the same time.

mbti,3aodqm,WhatINeverSaid,2,Mon Jun 22 04:35:38 2015 UTC,"I would peg my mother (that's who this is about) as an introvert so I think your assessment as an INFJ seems pretty good. I describe her as personable, but I've always interacted with her as her child, so I don't have a great feel for how others would perceive her. Thanks!"
mbti,3aodqm,Paragonight,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:08:37 2015 UTC,"A lot of this sounds identical to a woman I know who is INTJ. I guess it can be difficult to assess with a high accuracy, since cross-traits are possible. Even if you did figure out the exact type, every individual has a unique perspective on how they perceive ideas and others.   As an INFJ myself I rarely have conflicts with others, but I also do my best to understand and see things from other view points than my own. As soon as you start to exclude the possibility of your view being incorrect, then you greatly limit your ability to communicate in a sensible way. It can be difficult for many to exhibit enough composure and acknowledge the fact one may be wrong. A mistake we see all the time taking place every day between people, is that they think a disagreement or conflict has to be won, and if you lose it then your integrity can be questioned. Truthfully conflicts, arguments, etc. will only be lessened if people are willing to attempt to understand things from multiple perspectives. You don't have to be right all the time, no one sensible should think less of you. In fact, this is why conflicts are not about being won or lost, but being solved. This most certainly also seem to be what drives you to find a solution, so that you can understand her better and mend the relationship. I much encourage and approve of such an attitude. It does however take two willing parts or one will typically suffer, and unfortunately too many end up doing that.  Patience is never a bad trait for anyone to have, even if time is precious to all of us. If you don't mind elaborating, even by giving a fictive but close example, I'd be curious as to what kind of issues arise between you. It doesn't matter if they are of mild or severe nature, your conflicts are of as much importance as anyone else on this planet. Since there literally could be an endless array of reasons as to why you struggle with your mother, it would help if you look into all aspects of her life. A lot of people carry traumatic events from childhood with them into adulthood, and in worst cases they are never confronted or helped. Whatever the case may be, I do hope that you approach the situation with care and an open mind. Entering any challenge with clarity typically yields the best results."

mbti,3anpah,Famraine,3,Mon Jun 22 00:27:18 2015 UTC,"There are quite a few INFPs on this sub that are pretty active and seem pretty knowledgeable, so one of them will probably give you some good insights. In the meantime, I'll give you my two cents.  You sound very much like an INFP to me and what you are going through is not unusual as far as I know.  Some of the things that you wrote reminded me of somethings mentioned on the Personalityjunkie.com site for INFPs.  Such as:  ""Phase II INFPs are also characterized by a propensity for seeking and experimentation. In developing their auxiliary function, Extraverted Intuition (Ne), INFPs explore new ideas and open up some of their Fi judgments. They realize that some of their earlier judgments were premature, too black-and-white, or uncritically inherited artifacts from their childhood. This may compel them to embark on a journey of discovering their own truth, including obtaining a clearer understanding of themselves and their place in the world.""  Also this: ""INFPs are also inclined toward art, poetry, and other means of self-expression, whereas NTPs are more interested in conceptual pursuits than artistic ones. Of course, these lines can sometimes be blurred on account of the inferior function, which, for better or worse, often inspires INFPs to pursue Te sorts of interests."" And ""INFPs may be enticed by their inferior function, Extraverted Thinking (Te), to pursue less than ideal careers, such as computer science, mathematics, or the hard sciences.""  Values change.  That is part of progressing through life.  It doesn't mean that your type changes, just your perceptions and judgements change."
mbti,3anpah,jermofo,3,Mon Jun 22 01:37:18 2015 UTC,"Throw the type stereotypes to the trash. INFPs don't need to be artsy. Fi-dominant types are primarily and simply people who have a need to do what they find authentic and meaningful. If it allows them to express themselves somehow, all the better. But the world is full of things like that, art and writing are just a tiny sliver of the possibilities. Some find their calling in writing, some in the sword, some in theoretical physics and others in who knows what. When talking about Fi-doms, the best rule about interest choice is that there are none.  I used to be a yes man for the longest time, and didn't really feel good doing it. Went a bit overboard in the other direction and said ""No"" to too many things for a while. I've a better handle on it now.  Being able to say ""I failed at it"" is a wonderful skill to have, because it feeds a realistic evaluation of your own abilities. I've found that kind of realistic attitude to be good for mental contentment and self-confidence. I know what I can do, I know what I can't do (yet) - I don't need to aggrandize or diminish myself. One useful tool to couple with that is separating things into those that are truly hard and those that are merely foreign - some things are difficult to do simply because you're not used to them yet. Being aware of that distinction's been incredibly helpful for me."
mbti,3andh8,ThatsAllFolks42,3,Sun Jun 21 22:38:14 2015 UTC,"I would suggest familiarizing yourself with the cognitive functions (it will take a while), and the usual configuration of those in various MBTI types. Then it's simply just looking for clues of functions, trying to come up with possible types, looking at those types' descriptions and deciding which one fits best.  That, or you could make her fill a test. I'd suggest [http://25quiz.com/](25quiz.com) - I have found this as reliable and reasonably short. (Also, it doesn't think in terms of letters, but in terms of functions. All tests that say you are 75% F and 29% N and things like that are crap. Avoid them.)"

mbti,3andh8,nulloid,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:38:03 2015 UTC,Note: I believe she is a ISxx but everything I've read about types with those two letters say that either she doesn't like conflict and avoids it or her conflicts are never personal.  She is very quick to a fight and it's always very personal. That is a big part of the problem. I enjoy debating an idea without it ever becoming personal for me. But she takes even the suggestion that bacon should be chewy rather than crunchy as a personal attack. Any ideas on what that would be?

mbti,3alabd,CritSrc,5,Sun Jun 21 09:07:05 2015 UTC,I think this analysis makes sense. Fi is still kind of mystifying to me. I only know that it's not dependent on the happiness of others in the same way that Fe can sometimes be.

mbti,3alabd,SquirmGirl,5,Sun Jun 21 08:56:07 2015 UTC,"You're welcome, however...   I never saw much J in myself   That's not exactly how the theory works. There are cognitive functions at play behind everyone's type, so it's not about being more P than J, or more F than T, etc. It's about which functions you're using predominantly, and how they're stacked, that makes you that type.  The function you described, specifically, is extroverted feeling (Fe). It's a ""harmony"" function. Feelings are felt and expressed in a universal sense, which is why they often high-ranking users of this function can literally ""feel"" the emotions of those around them. Hence, why they may be more comfortable in an atmosphere where everyone is relaxed and happy. INFPs, on the other hand, use introverted feeling (Fi) as their dominant function. Their feelings are subjective, and are hardly ever dependent on how those around them feel. This is a good article which explains the differences between INFJ and INFP, using their different set of functions as examples.  I'm not an INFP, so I wouldn't know which function is at play to make one feel their happiest when those around them are happy. What you're describing may not be related to typology at all. Perhaps it's simply a sense of altruism?  Either that, or you're a Fe-user, which would make you a different type than INFP :)"
mbti,3alabd,Komatik,4,Sun Jun 21 09:10:48 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between basing type/traits on the letters and on the functions - both give you a code that looks the same but the meaning behind them is different.

mbti,3alabd,burrit0z,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:50:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's how you interpret the wording.   As an Fi user, it would not be true for me to say    I am not happy unless others around me are happy.    But it would be true to say    It makes me happy to make others around me happy.    In other words, my happiness is not dependent on the happiness of those around me, but it does make me happy if I can make others happy too.

mbti,3ais7p,mirwin23,6,Sat Jun 20 17:51:10 2015 UTC,"He can be reasoned with. His openmindness depends on how he developed his intuition.  The best is to bet on his strengths : it's the realm of things he is comfortable and competent with, and it's facts, practical ordered and goal oriented strategies.  If you display that, he would be convinced, or at least impressed by your motivation and responsible mindset.  Chances are he never been in a similar situation, than you want to go in, so he has little to no to compare. Give im practical reason that it's smart and safe, and his fear and concern will vanish, letting you free with your decision.  Be gentle and aware of his feelings : if you tell him he is wrong or controlling/manipulative, you'll annoy him, or make him angry.  ISTJs deal with theirs feelings alone, but anger make them shut down.  It will ruin all chances to convince him.  Reassure him. Facts. Responsibility. Do things in the right order, one after the other, with patience and determination.  He may value all that. It's your ticket.  He won't like it if you screw up but remember he'll be there right in time of need. He'll scold you, but I guess you are used to the ""I told you"" discourse.  Keep confidence. Make the work. Show us all we are wrong to be concerned and sceptical. Make him proud."

mbti,3ais7p,sociotronics,3,Sun Jun 21 04:51:49 2015 UTC,"What are the options? Is it go to college or not? Dorm vs apartment? Attend college away from home vs live with parents while going to school?  Assuming it's dorm vs living with parents you have a few options. Did he go to college? If so, where did he live? Ask your mom if you don't know, the answers can guide how you make your case. If he didn't, does he know people who did? Successful people, ones he respects? Try to get him to talk to them about it - chances are they didn't live with their folks. They may be able to sway his mind, or at least lend more weight to your side. If not, appeal to authority - find respected people who went away to college who have written about or talked about how that was a positive thing for them. Find written praise for leaving home to go to school somewhere, anywhere, so long as it is respected.  Dorms and meal plans, etc, can seem like a huge ripoff, so if that's really a no-go, see about getting roommates and an apartment close to campus. The more you can plan this out before talking to your father, the better. Show him the cost, have roommates in mind, have a budget, all that goodness. If it's cheaper than living on-campus, see if he'll help pay for it, maybe contingent on grades.  Ask him for his reasoning. He should have very specific points on why he wants you home. Once you know what they are, you can address them. Too expensive? Offer to pay part yourself with a summer job. He wants you close so you don't screw up? College is a pretty safe place to learn how to live independently, since you're not really on your own, and you do need to learn this. No point in living on campus? Do your research and give him proof that's wrong. Written proof, he's an istj.  If you can't work it out for freshman year, try to bargain for sophomore year. Or find a way to do it yourself. If you do end up living off campus, find ways to be there most of the time, anyway, especially freshman year. Join groups or sports, study at the library, make on-campus friends and hang out with them. Just go home to sleep and eat."
mbti,3ais7p,paralloyd,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:57:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice. This hostel does promise a lot of activities and even learning. So I think it'd be a great experience. Maybe I'll try emailing the staff for help. Nah, he didn't go to college. Main reason for disapproval is that he thinks the cost isn't worth whatever strengths living there can bring. He said what exactly can you do there that you can't without living there? I'm not great on talking practically so I showed him the website. And I'll email a staff for help."
mbti,3ais7p,MakhnoYouDidnt,2,Sun Jun 21 05:04:42 2015 UTC,"When you say ""live-in college"", are you saying what's at stake is merely whether you live in a dorm or not, or is your father saying don't go to college at all?  Living in the dorms is a bad idea generally. They overcharge, it's crowded, dorms are generally uncomfortable, you don't have privacy, and alcohol is almost always banned. Try getting an apartment near campus. More privacy, cheaper, and you have somewhere private to bring your dates.  If you're trying to get the best college experience, dorms are not the way to go."
mbti,3ais7p,chwoey,2,Sat Jun 20 18:27:41 2015 UTC,It might be that OP was planning on going to a college far away from home so living at home instead of dorms wouldn't be feasible.

mbti,3aj9f3,o_oM,8,Sat Jun 20 19:02:09 2015 UTC,"What's up here is that you're confusing the results of a test with being a type the test tells you. Thing is, it's not that simple. There's two main ways to assign yourself a type:  The first is assigning yourself four letters by taking a test (or doing it yourself), the second figuring out what cognitive functions (~=go-to habits for taking in, evaluating and organizing information) you use. Both give you the same kind of code because the approaches have a lot of shared history, but the meaning behind the code is different because of how it's arrived at. Using a test to get a code and then look what kind of functions you're supposed to use from that is usually a bad idea (for example, I often get IxTP results from tests - this would mean I use Ti, which I don't - I'm a very clear Te type). Despite being different, both of these approaches give you valuable information but should be kept separate because they mean very, very different things.  The test ranks you on four different scales that are more or less separate from each other - ie. your score on one shouldn't influence your score on the others much at all. Having only a slight preference here is normal, and pretty much expected. The test results tend to fluctuate a good bit as well.  What the test letters mean, roughly: I/E = introverted/extroverted. Do you like being out and about, esp. around people. N/S = Abstract-minded or concrete person. F/T = Do you reason more on sentiment and good/bad type of judgment or in a cold, detached way. The F items put a good deal of weight on being accomodating (ie. something the functions approach would term extroverted Feeling, Fe) P/J = How organized, scheduled, conscientious you are. The more P, the more disorganized and spontaneous, the more J, the more organized and planned.      The other way is to figure out what functions you use.  The functional approach is a rough model that tries to explain how you take in, evaluate and organize information by dividing the information processing into four core processes (Thinking, Feeling, Sensing and iNtuition) each of which has two attitudes (ie. extraversion, or interest in the external world, and introversion, ie. interest in what is going on inside your head) and then figuring out which processes you use in what attitudes. They're often shortened to a function code of Core process and Attitude, ie. Sensing in the extroverted attitude = Se.  Two examples would be an inclination to use the Thinking function focusing more on personal models (introverted Thinking, Ti) and their accuracy or the state of the outside world or analyzed system (extroverted Thinking, Te) and exerting control over it, or using Feeling to focus more on the harmony of the group (extroverted Feeling, Fe) or being true to yourself (introverted Feeling, Fi).  Test ENTP v. ENTJ, for example, is basically asking whether the person is more haphazard and spontaneous or more planned, conscientious and orderly - it's directly what the tests measure and the types differ only on one scale.  In Function-land, where we look at how the person takes in, evaluates and organizes information, the meaning is different. Here we find that ENTPs and ENTJs use an entirely different set of processes:  ENTPs are primarily watchers who lead with extroverted Intuition (Ne) - it's an exploring, brainstorming kind of process that draws its inspiration from the outside world and is very interested in it, and complement that with Ti - an evaluating process that focuses on building accurate mental models of things. How the cogs turn is more important than what that turning accomplishes.  ENTJs lead with extroverted Thinking or Te - cold, detached reasoning like Ti, but focused on evaluating the properties of the outside world and exerting control over it, usually with the aim of ordering it to be more efficient. They complement this with introverted Intuition, which in contrast to Ne's curious exploration just drinks in tons of information and subconsciously finds patterns in there that it then condenses it into a holistic understanding of how something ticks that the Ni type himself often needs to work to ""map out"".  In short, they're totally different :D  Same applies to INTP vs. INFP - in test-land the difference is a slight preference to Thinking or Feeling type items in the questionnaire, but in Function-land an INTPs primary processes are Ti (dominant/compulsive) and Ne (auxiliary/habitual), while INFPs lead with Fi and use Ne as auxiliary - they share the habitual process and their dominant function is introspective, evaluative in nature so their minds are kind of similar in construction, but the compulsive, dominant process is different which is a very large change."

I will check out the cognitive functions (I didn't even know about that approach!) ~ and I wonder if they will lead to a very different result! Also, I wonder if we should be taking this tests every now and then to record and see changes in our selfs. That be interesting to analyze.

mbti,3aj9f3,Komatik,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:29:33 2015 UTC,"One small addition I'd like to make:  A function is just a pattern of operation that's ingrained in us. A way that we're drawn to do certain things. Although they're often talked about as if they were spirits or something that possess us (because they do inform our behavior somewhat), they're not straitjackets that force you to do something, nor do you need a function to do something that's typically ascribed to users of that function - they're users of that function because it's their inclination to act that way, ie. them being users of Function Xy is just a description of that preference.   I'm bad at symbolic logic because of the way I'm drawn to think when I think in a cold, impartial manner. A Ti type naturally thinks a bit differently and that pattern is naturally better suited to the exercise and they'll find it far lighter work than I do, for example. Doesn't mean I can't do it, it just runs contrary to my first instincts on how to assess and solve things.  The same way, some people are naturally concerned about how others feel about things and that a group they're in has a good vibe. I'm not wired to pay attention to that stuff, but I can if I decide to. But it's not ingrained in me the way it is in some other people."
mbti,3aj9f3,zeroffn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:52:00 2015 UTC,"I personally I'm good at symbolic logic (one more fact that supports I am INTP, yeah!). I agree with you that one can boost up or constraint certain natural tendencies. A while ago I actually had to google how to improve empathy (there are some exercises that help, even when you are grown up -though is better to start as young as possible), because I never took other people into consideration. I find it SO difficult to understand what they might be feeling.  And only by forcing myself to be conscious of them is that I've managed to improve my friendships. It's hard work, but it's possible :D"
mbti,3aj9f3,littlesoubrette,2,Sun Jun 21 21:43:56 2015 UTC,The tests ultimately tell you what you tell them - developing your own ability to assess yourself and be critical of yourself is probably ultimately more fruitful.
mbti,3aj9f3,zeroffn,2,Sat Jun 20 21:02:49 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you just developed a logical reason for wanting to care about others more so you placed an increased value on developing your Fe. There isn't really a way your natural preferences change besides major psychological trauma, but anyone can learn to develop their functions. Your reasoning also sounds like Fe, whereas INFPs and their Fi is more of a system of morals and values for themselves. Both types can be incredibly intelligent and logical"
mbti,3aj9f3,Odditys,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:20:51 2015 UTC,"This is totally off topic and unrelated, but what role does psychological trauma play in changing personality types?

Would going through trauma therapy (and resolving the mental illness relate to the abuse) change the personality at all?"

It would definitely encourage healthy development whereas a lack of that therapy would probably hinder it.

mbti,3ad7jo,Silver_Dynamo,18,Fri Jun 19 03:58:54 2015 UTC,"INJs, no matter how accurate you think your perceptions are, please remember that they aren't universal. Do not forget that you are human and susceptible to the same flaws and blindspots as everyone else. Strive to improve but learn to accept imperfection in yourself and in others.  TJs, learn to see the value in deviations and outliers. Instead of dismissing them as inconsequential or unimportant, look at them as an opportunity to get more information and refine your theories. It's not just a TJ thing, but be careful not to fall into the trap of defining yourself by your motivations and others solely by their actions. Others have vulnerabilities and fears that they're trying to minimize too.   FPs and SJs, when you find yourself attaching strongly to something, take a moment and ask yourself why. It's one thing to enjoy and experience something purely for what it is, it's another to define yourself in relation to it. Consider the consequences if you're wrong.   TPs, I'm going to project some of my own experiences and be a bit of a hypocrite. The value and truth of something isn't dependent on whether you, as an individual, understand it. Especially for the younger ones, there will be a lot of things in life that don't make sense and seem like bullshit rituals with obsolete purposes. A lot of it is bullshit rituals with obsolete purposes but there's usually a reason why it's like that and that reason is usually ""human nature"". Learning to cooperate with it sometimes instead of subverting it from the start can save you a lot of trouble and frustration in the long run."

ENTJ: If you want to be in charge, listen, listen, listen to the people you want to lead. On the practical side, it's so much easier to weave multiple people's wants and needs towards a single goal than force everyone to want the same thing, and on the emotional side, nothing is better than when people love as well as respect you.  INTJs: If you're depressed, don't let your independence/hubris stand in your way of seeking help. All of y'all I've ever met have had huge issues in this regard, which is heartbreaking. People will love you even if you're not perfect.  INFJ: Tell someone what you're really afraid of.  ENFJ: Re-examine a deeply held belief. You don't have to change it. Just look at it with fresh eyes.  INTP: If you haven't for a while, analyze an important relationship. Make sure you're on the same page.  ENTP: Make a list of all the projects that you're halfway through, and choose whether to ax them completely or finish them. Then finish the easiest one.  INFP: The next time you need to go somewhere, try leaving 10 minutes earlier.  ENFP: Remember that you are only what you've done. You are not what people tell you you can be, or what you want to be, you are only the sum of your actions. If you're okay with that, have a kegger. If not, figure out what the person you want to be would have done, and do it.  ESTJ: How do the people you love know that you love them? You might think they know because of everything you do to help them, but double-check. Hug them and tell them that you love them.  ISTJ: Make a bucket list, if you don't already have one, and do something off it.  ESFJ: Is there a relationship in your life that is all give, no return? Is there someone who's toxic and only brings you down? You are under no obligation to put up with them. Cut them off.  ISFJ: Take a day off. Get a massage, or go to the beach, or go to the museum. But do it alone. This day is just about you.  ESFP: Ask yourself which people in your general circle of acquaintance are usually right about things and people. They are probably also right about you. You should take their advice.  ISFP: Design a flowchart for how the rest of your week will look like.  ISTP: What have you made? Whether it's tangible or intangible, tell someone about it.

Actually, this page is AMAZING for the specific advice.  https://www.personalitypage.com/html/ESTP_per.html  Somewhere in the page it's mentioned but we need to use our introverted thinking to help us take advantage of our tertiary function (Fe)."

We are two sides of the same coin.   You guys inspires me so much.... I can't even properly express in words. Your carefreeness, bluntness, opportunism, presence, and improvisation skills are just unreal. You keep me grounded in reality. Seriously, you guys are beautiful creatures.   I know it's really difficult right now :(. I'm struggling with concentrating on action (keep getting distracted by thoughts / planning / analyzing everything) probably as much as you are with thinking. We have to be patient with ourselves and keep taking baby steps. Keep poking at yourself 😂 and you will see your squishy insides one day.  And don't let negativity get the best of you :).

Yes, question different methods, but you should always judge work based on the results and effects.  INFP's, I know that I (an ISTP) can be a jerkface, and I can be hurtful without knowing it. Just let me know when I'm going too far before you go all ballistic on me. I am not always a serious person; but I am always serious about our fun and/or interesting conversations.

mbti,3ad7jo,gobigred3562,2,Sat Jun 20 15:27:23 2015 UTC,"General advice; As MBTI users, we can use our knowledge of others to our advantage to make communication easier/more efficient. If you want someone to do something, think about who you are speaking to. Thinkers are swayed by facts, reason, and logic; 2+2. Feelers are swayed by feelings, whether their own or someone elses; offended, stressed, excited. You may need to change your argument to target the other person.   xxTJ - You will always get more ants with honey than vinegar. I know you think it's stupid, but you need to be aware of others feelings. People will be more inclined to do what you want without complaint if you make them feel good. Therefore, you need to chose your words carefully. HOW you say things is just as important, if not more so, than WHAT you are saying. Be patient with the feelings of others.  xxFx - Just because you are feeling a strong emotion, does not mean that the other person is going to understand or be sympathetic. If you want to get something done (rather than just venting) and are talking to one of the above types, avoid using the words ""I'm feeling"", ""I [don't] like"", etc. Because they rely so heavily on logic, they tend to automatically disregard everything you say when they know you're basing your rationale on emotions. Do your research. Come to the table with facts. Speaking their language will get you much further and frustrate you less. If you cannot come up with step-by-step reasoning on why you want or don't want something, then maybe you need to re-evaluate your emotions."

mbti,3adie6,blakatze22,2,Fri Jun 19 06:00:41 2015 UTC,"Sounds like ISTP to me, if I had to guess. Your leading function as an ISTP will be Ti- or introverted thinking. I see this coming out as you don't want to waste time in conversation; you want things to be succinct. Also, you don't like needy people. That takes the F out of the equation for me. Your second function will be Se. I see that coming out in your artsy drawing side. Your third function is Ni - I don't have anything to add on this one with what you've given us, other than resting bitch face which could be a result of you being off in thought somewhere instead of focusing on how you appear to people. Lastly, Fe. I see that coming out in your desire to see humility in others. The ISxx part is obvious because you only type as those 4 types. The T I think is dominant because of reasons stated above and the P is dominant because of your artsy side and your desire for an open mind."

I mean, so many people test as INxx or ENxx and it's completely wrong in the end once they sit down, are honest with themselves, and work through their cognitive process using the functions. Unless you're just going by the letters.  Regardless, I see Se in this post more so than Si.    I enjoy being practical.  I am a doer   I have random spurs of the moment that makes me try different things like recipes or activities.

I also believe in empathy and try to be empathetic and understanding towards everybody. I am not sure if im an isfj because I was raised that way or possibly want to be that way. Or maybe I am an isfj thats just hanging around with too many xNTx types and getting influenced.
mbti,3adie6,TurtleSmile1,2,Fri Jun 19 06:36:08 2015 UTC,"That's a difficult distinction to make; the difference between your ideal self and your real self. I was raised in a household that was heavy F. Super heavy. So, up until a few years ago, I probably wouldn't have scored T, even though I'm an INTJ, and we care very little for the emotions of others. As you develop and grow into who you really are you'll find that you will probably fit better into a certain type category."
mbti,3adie6,Komatik,2,Fri Jun 19 07:19:19 2015 UTC,"Hm. Have you studied the function-based approach to type at all? It could clear up some confusion if you decide to get into it.  What it is is a rough model that tries to explain how you're inclined to take in, evaluate and organize information by dividing the information processing into four core processes (Thinking, Feeling, Sensing and iNtuition) each of which has two attitudes (ie. extraversion, or interest in the external world, and introversion, ie. interest in what is going on inside your head) and then figuring out which processes you use in what attitudes. They're often shortened to a function code of Core process and Attitude, ie. Sensing in the extroverted attitude = Se.  Two examples of these kinds of functions in different attitudes would be an inclination to use the Thinking function focusing more on personal models (introverted Thinking, Ti) and their accuracy or the state of the outside world or analyzed system (extroverted Thinking, Te) and exerting control over it, or using Feeling to focus more on the harmony of the group (extroverted Feeling, Fe) or being true to yourself (introverted Feeling, Fi).  In the theory, functions always come in opposite pairs - if your Sensing function is interested in the outside world, your Intuition will be driven to explore your inner world - and so come in four axes, with each person having one perceiving axis and one judging or evaluating one:  Perceiving: Se/Ni Si/Ne      Judging: Te/Fi Ti/Fe      Each of these tends to give a person a peculiar character unique to that axis.  Bear in mind these are tendencies, not straitjackets. That I'm habitually drawn to do cold, detached thinking in a certain way does not preclude me of doing eg. symbolic logic even though a Ti user's thinking habits make it much lighter work for him - this is about temperament and cognitive habits, not capability, after all. We have physicists who repress their Te function, for example.  If that piqued your interest and you want to learn more about the function-centric approach, there's two places that consistently make good functions-centric typology content with the 4 function stack model in mind and without much pollution from other systems. Michael Pierce's Youtube channel and the CelebrityTypes website.  For starting out, this playlist by Michael Pierce is probably the best introduction to typology on the 'net - it's certainly what made a sea of impossible jargon click for me the first time:  Lessons on functions-based typology by Michael Pierce  Celebritytypes has good comparison tables for the different functions - this is probably good to look at side by side with Pierce's introductory videos.  After the Lessons:  Pierce's portraits of the sixteen types in video  Pierce's portraits of the sixteen types as text  Another look at the functions by Pierce  CelebrityTypes' articles section is full of good stuff  Some longer posts I've written on Thinking, Feeling and Intuitive functions, no Sensing one yet ;__;  An explanation of what I think a function is and especially is not, using Te and Ti as examples, plus some elaboration on their nature  Observations on the differences between Fe and Fi  The difference between Ne and Ni"

Im trying to think of some examples. I know that if theres conflict within myself or with somebody close to me I would usually just want to dive into it and fix it right away. When problems linger around it really bothers me so ill usually try to resolve  it right away. When you say immense stress I think of situations like a kitchen on fire, robbery or kidnapping. Under those stressful situations, im good at putting my emotions aside to think what is the best logical step to approach this problem. I would think quick to try to stop the problem from getting worse. Im not sure if those were good examples of immense stress? Im also pretty quick to act on accidents or spills. I usually don't make big deals out of things and can accept that it has happened and move on. I usually don't like stress.. but I guess nobody else does either. But I find that I learn more in stressful situations and I really like that."
mbti,3adie6,NeedForAccuracy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:56:24 2015 UTC,"What is considered conflict?   I wanted to see what you'd say :)  Seeing how personalities react to internal/interpersonal conflict and stress help figure out type. During times of intense pressure, the ""social mask"" often drops and you get a glimpse of the base personality.  Same thing with looking at childhood experiences -- children haven't developed as many cognitive functions, so it can be easier to type a younger person.   When you say immense stress I think of situations like a kitchen on fire, robbery or kidnapping.   That's so interesting. I was thinking more about big life decisions, like moving, a career change, a wedding, a divorce. I wonder if thats a sensor/intuitive thing."
mbti,3adie6,NeedForAccuracy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:05:27 2015 UTC,I think when you mentioned immense stress I just automatically thought of situations which requires quick thinking or else the problem will prolong which is what I fear. Usually situations where I have full control over and theres no time to be emotional. I guess I never really thought of career change or divorce... situations like those to be stressfull because I like to think that things happen for a reason and that theres always something to be learned from every situation. Also I have control over those things so I normally wouldn't see a point in stressing about decisions I have personally made.
mbti,3adie6,NeedForAccuracy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:31:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not the best at this but I've been studying Jung's stuff (I like it better than MBTI) so maybe I can offer some different viewpoints. Some of these were answered in your post/comments, but I'm just stating them all for cohesiveness.  Here are a few questions (there are going to be some overlaps) but tell me whether the first or second half of each bullet reminds you of yourself the most:   Number 1, when you ""debate"" with people, do you mainly back up your claims with sources, facts, objective data, stuff you read? Do you prefer learning for the sake of using that knowledge to influence things, and only learn what's needed to complete your goal? Do you like being efficient and cutting to the chase? OR, do you attempt to explain what makes sense from your own logical standpoint? Do you enjoy learning things just because they interest you or because you want to understand things better? Do you enjoy taking your time, thoroughly exploring things from different angles that you think up?  Number 2, when you make intuitive connections and have ""aha"" moments, do they seem to come from nowhere (your subconscious) making you go, ""I have a feeling about this."" meaning you couldn't explain to someone how you came to that conclusion? OR, do you usually have to read/hear/see something and THEN say ""Aha, it all adds up!"" and you'd be able to explain to someone how you reached the conclusion? Number 3, think back to a vacation you took or memorable place you went. Do you have an easy time recalling the detailed sights, smells, objects, sounds, concrete details? In other words, you'd say you have a good photographic memory. OR, do you more easily recall how everything made you felt, the mood of it, the vibes you got, the meaning, your emotions, so not concrete details? In other words, you'd say you have an impressionistic memory. Number 4, would you say you're fine telling others how you feel, maybe even feeling relief from it? Are you sensitive to others' feelings, absorbing their moods and taking their feelings/reactions into consideration when making decisions/communicating with them? Do you not mind adjusting your behavior to others and society because you find it better than creating disharmony? OR do you prefer to keep feelings personal and don't feel the need to express them to others? Would you prefer to stay true to yourself, no matter the external influences? Does it make you feel unpleasant when you have to conform to society and others' wishes, because you prefer individualism?    Finally, if you were to order these from ""most like you"" to ""most unlike you,"" how would you do that (you can use the numbers)?"

mbti,3abi5t,Orikon32,3,Thu Jun 18 23:02:40 2015 UTC,"I can't tell you about Avoidant, but my personal experience is somewhat similar.   I have always very consistently tested as an ENTP. However, life issues, depression returning, etc during my sophomore year of college, had me diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder(with a side of depression/ADHD/bipolar, they couldn't decide)  During that time, I distinctly remember testing as an INFP.   Now that I'm recovering, I'm back to mostly ENTP, however it's been evolving lately into an ENTP/ENFP with no reliable preference, my tendencies just depend on the situation and how I woke up that morning. Sometimes I'm VERY 'T', other times my 'F' is really obvious.   So I'd say from a personal psychiatric perspective, yeah, it can change."
mbti,3abi5t,cityalien,3,Sat Jun 27 07:36:00 2015 UTC,"I can not recall where from but I remember stumbling across a piece that proposed that those with mental illness present or lingering (still in the aftermath) or those who receive medication which greatly alters the balance in chemical processing, are eliminated from the Myers Brigg.   Avoidant Personality Disorder is similar to Depression and other psychological disturbances which pertain to physicality. The second part, is that they are related to self esteem (not as much Depression). So if an individual who was at such a low level, gained a regular self esteem and were deemed cured- they could retake the test but have to watch the result of it switching.  If the result kept switching, its an indication that they are out of touch with themselves and their disturbance is still present thus eliminating them again. If they underwent a serious trauma (illness), they can be classified as another. Maturity can also change another.  Going back to the original inquiry, I do not know of any conclusive study however the question should not be whether they can be successfully typed as another but who they were to begin with. Take their old description and new description and compare to the time before they had illness present."
mbti,3abi5t,Northerncrafts,2,Sun Jun 28 23:48:20 2015 UTC,don't think avoidant personality disorder would affect cognition much.

It's also interesting that there is, at least according to celebrity types, a correlation between type and certain mental disorders.   Does the disorder bring about the type manifestations, or are certain types more susceptible to certain disorders?"

mbti,3aaotw,iburnedparadise,4,Thu Jun 18 16:27:23 2015 UTC,I think culture does have an affect on MBTI types especially since specific cultures cultivate a specific worldview.

mbti,3aaotw,Entr0pic08,9,Sat Jun 20 17:30:20 2015 UTC,"Seriously though, what this thread essentially will amount of doing is to create prejudicial stereotypes of people from different societies and cultures where people are reduced into a caricature based on how they are perceived to be like and how that fits a certain type archetype. That is not productive or sound on any level whatsoever, nor does it suggest that people understand how type works, which is that it is a set of cognitive preferences of how you take in information and reason about the world, which is very different from the cultural values that you would hold."
mbti,3aaotw,jermofo,2,Fri Jun 19 02:52:17 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely right, however, maybe the thread can be redirected so that it does just the opposite.  Certain cultures may ""seem"" like it is related to a certain function on the surface (i.e. Las Vegas as the epitome of Se or maybe conservative areas being more prone to Si, or more broadly an American can be perceived as more Fe like than people in many other cultures).  Instead of trying to find a pattern of types that fit into a preconceived notion of where they might be marginally expected, identifying areas where the cultural dynamics might be confused with the cognitive functions of the individual may help to differentiate what belongs to the individual as a preference and what belongs to the society as a norm in which they come from.  In other words, stripping the nurture from the nature."
mbti,3aaotw,Entr0pic08,5,Sat Jun 20 17:26:09 2015 UTC,"Not my point at all nor was that my question. I just wanted to know if anyone already knew of any existing statistics Like how in the US  the breakdown looks like this:  11-14%ISTJ  -  9-14% ISFJ  -  1-3% INFJ  -  2-4% INTJ  4-6% ISTP  -  5-9% ISFP  -  4-5% INFP  -  3-5% INTP  4-5% ESTP  -  4-9% ESFP  -  6-8% ENFP  -  2-5% ENTP  8-12% ESTJ  -  9-13% ESFJ  -  2-5% ENFJ  -  2-5%ENTJ  So how would it look in Europe or Africa or Brazil or Russia or anywhere and what could that tell us about the impact of culture on someones personality.

You didn't ask for demographic spreads, but you seem to imply causal relationships between types and cultural upbringing, which, if you check the other responses in this thread, is how others interpreted it as well. If you wanted to be clear about what you were asking for, you should have phrased it that you were interested in the demographic distribution of types in different societies."

""into the"": about  ""effects"": power to bring about a result  ""of culture"": a way of thinking, behaving, or working that exists in a place  ""on the"": pertaining to the subject of  ""distribution of"": the way that something is divided or spread out  ""mbti types"": Myers-Briggs Type Indicator classifications  A simple 'yes' or 'no' would suffice to answer the question and so far all I have gotten is a bunch of no's, even from you. But to suggest that I was trying to  ""create prejudicial stereotypes of people from different societies and cultures""  could not be farther from the truth.  I can not be held accountable for other users who read that question and feel the need to tell be about their nationality and what type their parents are.   Yes my post did have two parts and yes the second part is potentially misleading. But i was merely trying to give examples of patterns that we might windup seeing once some of the data was collected.

And I don't think being unafraid to tell it like it is is necessarily something that decides that he's ExTJ. Anyone could become that way.  Mango's Se is all over the place. In an interview, he described his play style as a kind of in-the-moment thing, reacting to every move as though he were in a real fight lol. Definitely not wasting his time thinking of all the possible ways he could approach like a typical Ne would.  His use of Se in Melee is also why he doesn't need to dissect the game and still be the GOAT.  Playing with an Se approach in Melee is probably the most efficient way of playing."
mbti,3aai40,Eerie_Xavi,2,Thu Jun 18 18:15:08 2015 UTC,Also mango's in the moment attitude could probably be attributed to his P. ENTPs are extroverts focused on things and mechanics much like ENFPS are focused on people and society. Both live in the moment all the time though
mbti,3aai40,Komatik,0,Thu Jun 18 18:36:26 2015 UTC,"Ne doms are not necessarily focused on what is, but what is possible. Mango seems to be using a method of playing that's more towards what is, Se. He's reacting to what is happening, not playing off of what could be happening."
mbti,3aai40,Eerie_Xavi,2,Fri Jun 19 00:56:30 2015 UTC,"Have you ever seen one of his analysis videos? He is completely an Ne Dom. Yes, he sees the game at a different rate, but that's from experience and what most players call micro/macro situations, things like choosing the best option depending on the Di or reacting on the soonest frame possible to make the best of the situation. These kinds of reactions come naturally from experience, and I think any top player would tell you that. Anyways, if you were to see one of his match analysis videos you would see that mango actually chooses his options from some crazy mango memory bank depending on these micro/macro situations. Everything is examined, chosen, and executed so quickly for him. He's just good at the game.   Not to mention his Fe. He thrives off of others people's emotions and comes through when everyone wants him to. He's said it himself, he does it for the fans. ENTPs are known for being egotistical.."
mbti,3aai40,Eerie_Xavi,-1,Fri Jun 19 08:16:01 2015 UTC,"The fact that he chooses his options from some crazy mango memory bank is a clear indication of Ni instead of Ne, because to him, there's only a set amount of options, Ni. An Ne user, especially a dominant one, would consider more and more options and would more likely be slower to react because that thinking process can't possibly keep up with the fast pace of the game. Thriving off of other people's emotions and coming through when people want him to happen to Fi users too... and mostly to them. See Isai. lol"
mbti,3aai40,waysofbk,4,Fri Jun 19 09:54:09 2015 UTC,"Ne and Se are the fast perception functions - they deal more directly with the observation. Si and Ni are what need to let the observation ""simmer"" in the mind a bit before taking stock of it. They need a bit of time."

And no, Ni/Se looks to choose one specific option because it is believed that in that specific action will work, disregarding other options, as they would see it in theres heads without a second thought (I'm an intj). They over look the details, unlike how mango explains his approach to the game. I subscribed to him about six months ago and on that night I asked if he would take the test online and he took it in from of his whole stream. After he finished he resulted as an ENTP. Not sure how much more evidence, or maybe you don't believe it, regardless I'll go on. As far as reactions, the mbti isn't indicative of any physical traits. Yes it often reveals that an esfp might be better at athletics than say an entp, but it's more the fact that an esfp would RATHER be an athlete, as it appeals to their preferred function, and will strive to feed that. Being an esfp doesn't slow down time for you... I would say that any professional player can see and play the game at this high of a pace, how else would they even compete? It's silly to assume that because he ""reacts"" so quickly he is expectedly an Se Dom. See one of his match analysis, he doesn't really react that much. He pretty much always knows what his opponents can do in most situations and all the different options and what they will lead to. He constantly goes into tangents about how he could have picked one option and what that would have lead to and what THAT option lead to, always referring to melee as the matrix because it could go in infinite directions, pretty Ne/Si. I don't think you've done too much research into what mango really thinks like. His play style could give off that esfp persona but hes just that talented. He wouldn't be the goat for nothing.   The Fi will get this sense of duty because they feel it, not because other want it and they feel like they have to do it for them. Mango draws his inspiration through his following, less through his own personal pursuit. He wins, his fans love him, he slows down his game because he gets so full of himself, people start ""sleeping"" on him, his fans start to feel let down, and this is when Mango begins to feel bad and start trying again. This can be shown all throughout 2014 and into 2015 as he has had a rough start and people have started hating on him. He can't stand letting his people down or even being looked down on. He really is the most empathetic player in the world."
mbti,3aai40,afrikaharold,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:34:57 2015 UTC,"When I said visual typing, I meant like... this. And forget the play style, it probably doesn't matter as much as what he does unconciously with his face.  Edit: I admit that I pretty much made a huge error in my replies analyzing playstyle. But... ESFP, man. Not convinced that he's ENTP."
mbti,3aai40,Komatik,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:49:42 2015 UTC,"Notice that he's talking about what it would lead to, not as much what it could lead to. His ability to know what will happen seems to be characteristic of Ni. And meh, there's gotta be more evidence of auxiliary Ti for me to be convinced. Fi users can totally do things because others might want them to."
mbti,3aai40,Komatik,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:10:58 2015 UTC,"Yikes, perhaps you should do some more research into the mbti as well. Ni provides a more direct route where as Ne provides a variety to choose from. Ne dominant types are also quick to produce an option. And using words like ""would"" and ""could"" in order to distinguish Ni and Ne doesn't make a lot of sense. I could see how you could mistaken this sense of knowing for Ni. Though, this man has been playing for years. He already knows all of the moves, matchups, situations, JUST LIKE ALL TOP PLAYERS, regardless of their type. They know what to expect from other players. I've heard of other top players talk about how it only takes mango a few games to figure you out and beat you. He watches you play and takes in the details of your playstyle, like where you go to on the map, your rolling tendencies, ect. This is very Si. How do you think he reads the crap out of people so easily? He's seen their habits, remembers them, and exploits them in such a unique way, due to his Ne. His Ne is probably what makes this feature about him the scariest. He can see an infinite amount of ways to punish your tendencies and chooses whichever he pleases in a second. Ne types are always quick to react, that's the point of Ne, to generate at a high rate. Listening to him talk about how he plays the game definitely does not point to Ni. He never chooses an option directly. It's not like one popped into his head and he just went with it. He chooses his options from many like an Ne would, rather than spontaneously throwing one out because the Ni sees it.   Ti is difficult to prove since it's an introverted function and its easier to point out people extraverted functions, but the fact that he is able to think of many possible alternative sets of plays while playing with ease is probably due to his Ti. It's a framework that he's created in his head that lets him know that it is guaranteed to work. In his head, A will lead to B which will produce C.. And so on. Honestly, maybe pay a little attention to his approach to the game before coming to such a conclusion."
mbti,3aai40,Komatik,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:12:03 2015 UTC,I feel ppmd has to be An INTJ. His whole play style is playing the player not the character through the way he sees the game via his Ni and his Fi. He Plays off of others mistakes which may seem like a trait of Fe but the more logical and introspective  determination in his choices lead to him being Fi

Thanks guys!  Also, while it's nice that you guys are requesting a sticky or something, wouldn't this override with the already posted big guide to MBTI?"
mbti,3a7o5v,MrJudzey,5,Thu Jun 18 04:56:01 2015 UTC,"Fe is feeling that is extroverted onto the external world. In your post you seemed to only touch the surface: cultural norms. In fact Fe is much more fundamental. An Fe type may objectify their feeling onto objects, events, and actions (in the case of strong S preference); or externalise it in the form of ideas (in the N case).   Since you're an ISFJ, it's clear why you so heavily emphasised about cultural norms, but for me this isn't the case.   Fe requires ordering and organising, rather than internalizing, structuring, refining, evaluating (typical introverted function traits). So as an ISFJ your ordering is in cultural norms. I care much more about the dynamics and ideas in a society.  I can have negative reactions to my own (and others') feelings. This is because I need that ordering. An Fi type may let their feelings roam wild, to whichever corner, constantly refining, redefining. This is much like the Te/Ti contrast. One is ordering for actions and external effects, and the other is for evaluation and analysis.   Put simply, feeling is not merely people focused. It's very much more fundamental. It makes decisions like ""should I spend today playing games or reading books?"" which requires value based analysis (Fi ""how is it that books make me happy?""; here is just as rational in analysis as Ti) or organisation (Fe, ""I'll get the most enjoyment from games then books, so books it is!""; thus is as rational as Te)"
mbti,3a7o5v,MrJudzey,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:52:21 2015 UTC,Thank you for this.   I'll edit the Fe section to (try) make it more objectively relevant to both NFJ and SFJ.  EDIT: I just edited Fe to make it a bit more objective for both Ni and Si. What do you think?

We work in an IT company, and he's very good at very organized about setting up requirements for a project and discussing/organizing for the team members in a very objective fashion. He'll call out someone if he thinks they are wrong about something relating to his requirements or questioning the design that someone else made but doesn't go about it an a really-asshole-y way, he stays very professional about it.  So basically he's very organized, and good at being objective at making decisions without letting emotions get in the way, good at giving guidelines that are efficient but easy to understand but he's also not an asshole about it.  It's basically a type that I think is good for his position at this company (Business Analyst with some QA)."

Like I said before, quite sarcastically, it's as if some people are overreacting to an argument which really hits home and they don't know how to prove themselves."
mbti,3a6za8,kalg,4,Wed Jun 17 19:14:04 2015 UTC,Yes. My guess is the ESTJ that many people complain about are the ones that get on power trips or are just overly cocky/arrogant (which is possibly for almost any type).  The arrogant ESTJ ones are the ones that stick out more since their negative qualities stick out more than their positives.  I also feel like since this sub has a bit more bias towards Ns and have a slight bias against SJs in general but that just might be me..
mbti,3a6za8,superange128,3,Wed Jun 17 19:23:05 2015 UTC,"That explains it fairly well...  It seems as though people don't enjoy being told what to do, regardless of their personality, while ESTJs are the type typically associated with wanting to control things and having ""power-trips"". It's logical why we'd be blamed for that, it's just stupid otherwise.  Also, the lack of SJs in the Reddit community probably isn't helping either..."
mbti,3a6za8,Komatik,2,Wed Jun 17 19:32:26 2015 UTC,"The arrogant ESTJ ones are the ones that stick out more since their negative qualities stick out more than their positives.   I think it matters that when Te goes bad it affects the people around them a great deal. Te under stress can come out as controlling and blaming others - the others notice!  I also think that Te is closely associated with its negative qualities, while its positive side is more nebulous. The only ESTJ I know doesn't seem much like an ESTJ when she's happy; the characteristics are there, but they're more subtle. But when she's stressed, holy shit, there's no doubt. I think this can lead people to think the ESTJ is only the stressed-out, immature version, and overlook ESTJs who are more mature and well-balanced."
mbti,3a6za8,Mouon,2,Thu Jun 18 15:34:28 2015 UTC,"This is a good analysis, many people only look at Te's negative qualities (potential to be overly controlling, tendency to say things/make decisons that hurts/ignores others' feelings) while ignoring the positive qualities (very organized, can think objectively when needed, has great drive to do what needs to be done)"
mbti,3a6za8,azurestratos,2,Thu Jun 18 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"Te types have a tendency to be blunt - ETJs whose brains compulsively do cold, detached thinking especially so, and just evaluate things from that perspective.

mbti,3a6za8,Pendit76,3,Wed Jun 17 22:27:16 2015 UTC,"Its your dominant Te.  Dominant thinking types have a tendency to be hardheaded. Where Ti tend to be more self stubborn at worst, Te tend to be more dictatorial.  The difference is Ti (ex.INTP, ISTP) stubbornness doesn't usually affect a lot of people. And being Perceivers, they are more open to let others in their group more freedom to do what they want/think is right.  The Te (ENTJ, ESTJ) however, they tend to exert their stubbornness towards outside world, mainly people. So I'd wager your types have more ""fans"" than other types.  ENTJs I've seen are cool and seems to embrace that ""indeed, we are a**holes, fear us, lmao"". However they have Ni + Se, and are willing to consider opinions/methods of others.   ESTJs, I haven't met much of you lot. But you seemed to defend yourselves passionately (Fi maybe?). ""This is how I honestly feel and am,"". With Si, you may be less agreeable to opinions/methods of others.   But consider this,   ""A**holes"" is a descriptive term, that's flexible in the sense its not set in stone. Its a feedback from a related event/action. Also depends on legitimacy of the claim. Sometimes being one is necessary, but most case you have the choice not to.  ESTJs can be as nice and respected as any other types. Those who observe work ethics of professionalism, efficiency, honor and humility.

He only likes gun/gangster/unemotional movies. Nuts I tell you. He is insane about tidiness - but doesn't understand my need for cleanliness. He thinks germs aren't real - just because I say they are real. He doesn't live in the moment. He doesn't like nice things like savouring a good meal or deep discussions.   BUT - this is what he does right:   He doesn't focus on minor details. He forgives and moves on. He organises trips months in advance.  He is hilarious. His friends are amazing people, he attracts wonderful friends. He doesn't get upset over perceived failures in me or himself. He's very confident. We always have a good time when things are going well.  He doesn't get depressed, he just keeps moving.   He's taken A LOT of getting used to :)"

By this I mean that you have Ni/Si since you've told us that you're introverted and I have no reason to doubt your judgement. Judging from the information you've given, you could then be these types: ISTJ/ISFJ/INTJ/INFJ. Since you've assessed that you stay more or less dormant until a viable vision of action appears, this indicates you're likely an Ni dom. From here distinguishing INFJ/INTJ is difficult. Using fine clues such as saying you ""feel like"" wouldn't be enough to sway it either way because that's a manner of speech. One clue is that the confusion between INTP and INTJ leads me to believe that you're engaging Ni and Ti. This could indicate that you're a fellow INFJ. However I am cautious that this could be due to me only seeing what I'm familiar with in your thought pattern, and possibly neglecting other processes involved.  Let me know what you think."

I usually don't usually tell people this as i know how much it affects how people see and treat you.  Anyway, i thought i'd provide you some more information and se if you could provide any useful information based on it.  I have times when i think ""no stupid personality test can define me"" but fifteen minutes later im back on the internet researching again  Though i hate to admit it theres alot of emotions attatched to this project. Im struggling to separate what type i want to be and being objective with the facts to figure out the truth. From what I've heard INTP are always very objective with the facts, and though i would never ever use emotional arguments there's often some sort of emotion attatchment when im argumenting for something.  I have times when im acting emotional but afterwards i feel a bit disgusted by my own feelings and consider them lame.  Im quite image concious, i have a specific picture in my head if who i want to be and how i want others to percieve me.  Nothing is for nothing with me, im manipulating my enviroment to get the desired outcome. For example ill often make sure to space out my text as it makes it more likely for people to read it and therefore it will be more likely that they'll reply to my posts and therefore more likely for me to get some useful information.

I think this is natural because Fe wants to impose an order on emotions (whereas Fi seeks to develop feeling in internal strucutres, Fe will want to give an order to the feeling), this is often when I can feel that my emotions are being misguiding. This vision and picture in your head seems to be Ni.  The manner in which you're exerting influence and control over your environment indicates a strong extraverted feeling. I'll safely conclude that you're an INFJ.  I hope this Ni/Fe talk doesn't seem like gibberish. I would encourage you to look at the cognitive functions.

Unlike his illiterate characters, who tend to be terse and crude, he speaks with an amused, ironic manner. His involved syntax has a relaxed elegance, as if he had easy control over the direction and agreement of his thoughts.  [Last par, Page 2]: McCarthy's silence about himself has spawned a host of legends about his background and whereabouts.  ""I was not what they had in mind,"" McCarthy says of childhood discord with his parents. ""I felt early on I wasn't going to be a respectable citizen. I hated school from the day I set foot in it."" Pressed to explain his sense of alienation, he has an odd moment of heated reflection. ""I remember in grammar school the teacher asked if anyone had any hobbies. I was the only one with any hobbies, and I had every hobby there was. There was no hobby I didn't have, name anything, no matter how esoteric, I had found it and dabbled in it. I could have given everyone a hobby and still had 40 or 50 to take home."" WRITING AND READING seem to be the only interests that the teen-age McCarthy never considered. Not until he was about 23, during his second quarrel with schooling, did he discover literature. To kill the tedium of the Air Force, which sent him to Alaska, he began reading in the barracks. ""I read a lot of books very quickly,"" he says, vague about his self-administered syllabus.   ""The great thing about Cormac is that he's in no rush,"" Pearce says. ""He is absolutely at peace with his own rhythms and has complete confidence in his own powers.""  ""Everything's interesting,"" McCarthy says. ""I don't think I've been bored in 50 years. I've forgotten what it was like."""

All I can focus on is where I went wrong, or things I could've done differently to prevent that outcome.  Even once I'm past the stage of being unable to function, I still just can't let go.

I would say the fatal flaw for INTPs in relationships it not a failure to understand others worldviews, but rather our distrustful and emotionally distant nature. Even when we like someone, it can be next to impossible to really open up about emotions, especially any that may cause confrontation. Also I think we INTPs tend to over-analyze relationships, and in the end decide that since it's an emotional pursuit it's inherently not meant for us/outside of our abilities/outside of our desires, but in the end we still want it and then struggle with what we feel we want versus what we ""know"" is ""right""."

mbti,3a0rdu,Gandesa,8,Tue Jun 16 10:54:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'd say that's generally speaking true. Ti is very slow and therefore unreliable in interaction. Most INTPs I know go with more or less Ne rambling in conversation, like a crappy ENTP version since ENTPs have Ne and Fe higher up in their stack and utilize it better.  We might pause and reference back to our Ti at some point, but that's more of a quick Ne search of the landscape, not actually having Ti form what to say, that shit is way too slow and just comes out as rambling horse shit anyhow."
mbti,3a0rdu,ihqhevonen,2,Tue Jun 16 11:04:24 2015 UTC,This really depends on the kind of conversation and the situation of it. A quiet small group setting hashing something out is much different to a party or just being in public.
mbti,3a0rdu,Komatik,4,Tue Jun 16 11:38:18 2015 UTC,You're probably not going to get an INTP to talk much in a none private setting though. If it isn't a 1on1 conversation or a group of close friends the INTP will usually fall back on being an observer with very little to no input.

mbti,3a0rdu,Mouon,6,Tue Jun 16 12:27:29 2015 UTC,"That's probably because you have all your thoughts on the topics well thought out and organized, having had many debates on the topics previously, so you're confident in your expression of your opinions on said topics.   One of the reasons INTPs are usually silent is because we don't trust ourselves to just throw out Ne-Fe arguments without having them well processed by Ti, by the time Ti has evaluated it the conversation has already moved on. If you however have already had many conversations on the topic and already had Ti evaluate all your arguments it's much easier to speak up."
mbti,3a0rdu,ihqhevonen,4,Tue Jun 16 12:34:27 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons INTPs are usually silent is because we don't trust ourselves to just throw out Ne-Fe arguments without having them well processed by Ti, by the time Ti has evaluated it the conversation has already moved on.   Yeah, thats why I'm terrible at verbal debates."
mbti,3a0rdu,Mouon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:47:27 2015 UTC,"Ti itself is pretty slow indeed, but its constantly working.

mbti,3a0rdu,CentaurHecarim,4,Sun Jun 28 08:46:53 2015 UTC,I heard in another thread that INTPs that use extraverted thinking    Don't you mean extroverted intuition? Or do you mean Introverted thinking?

mbti,39zk38,toyouitsjustwords,3,Tue Jun 16 01:41:41 2015 UTC,"Many people associate the Se/Ni axis with an intense singular perspective and the Ne/Si axis with a flighty non-commital multifaceted perspective. I'd argue that this is somewhat erroneous. I think in Ni and Ne lies the difference in perspective   I think this'd be better put if you took stock of the four perceiving functions individually, and then their interactions as an axis, much like, say, Fi is individualistic and idealistic and Te a bulldozer - you see Fi types being averse to a sense of hierarchy, while Te doms do rank people, they do so in a very matter-of-fact manner. It takes the axis being unrepressed with Te on top to produce a more virulent stance towards ""lesser men"" like some INTJs highlight.  In the same way, Se and Ne both seek the new if they are at the top of the stack, Si tends to be drawn to the familiar and Ni goes around in circles exploring a concept. That is, it's better to focus on whether the person's primary perceiving function is an introverted or an extroverted one, and whether it is dominant or auxiliary - you see the same focus difference in focus in NTPs - ENTPs are flighty, bouncing around taking light interest in many things, while INTPs are more focused, owing to unrepressed Si reinforcing Ti.   And so with the repression of Fe and Ni's difficulty expressing itself the ISTP developes a stoic silence   I'd say this is a characteristic of both ISxP stacks - Ti+Se and Fi+Se are not necessarily inclined to express themselves verbally, and opening up Ni ideas to something comprehensible takes a lot of words. The result is both types not speaking much."
mbti,39zk38,Komatik,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:43:16 2015 UTC,I totally agree that this silence is characteristic of both ISP types. In the ISTP I chalk it up to repressed Fe and in the ISFP I chalk it up to Fi's tendency to be reticent. Of course there's the Tertiary Ni contributing as well.
mbti,39zk38,Komatik,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:39:20 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's more Ti+Se - the ISTP is driven to understand how things work and then demonstrate that understanding in the real world. No words necessary for that, and Ti's standards for quality communication being what they are, much easier too."

mbti,39zk38,Komatik,2,Tue Jun 16 02:29:26 2015 UTC,"People say that Ni/Se relates to attaching to one intense perspective. But Sasha Grey is an ESTP (so she has Se/Ni) and yet she said  ""If I only concentrated on one thing, I would limit myself in life."" But this makes sense if you consider that it isn't the axis as a whole that leads itself to singularity but Ni itself since Ni would be repressed in an ESTP like Sasha.   I was contrasting how the INTP repression of Fe leads to a schizotypal personality style (the descriptors of which I got from millon.net) but in the ISTP it leads to a no-bullshit attitude."

Sorry, if I'm very confused here and I can't get million.net to load on my computer.  The site seems to be down for me, so I can't check the context. I was actually curious if ISTP's have a better control of their inferior Fe than INTPs do, because as far as I know, we all have our faults.  My interpretation of your post was that their inferior Fe works out better for them than their INTP counterparts. If that is so, then I'd like to know why and how, etc.   I was only thinking that similar faults should be similar to similar types, such as INTP/ISTP. Understanding the actual differences between related types is something that I value."
mbti,39xv9x,NeedForAccuracy,5,Mon Jun 15 18:07:47 2015 UTC,I suck at teaching. Unless you are good at learning just by watching.
mbti,39xv9x,Pentosin,2,Mon Jun 15 23:30:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly, then that's how you'd teach effectively; by showing. Hands on activities require hands on learning."
mbti,39xv9x,felmarah,13,Tue Jun 16 00:23:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't peg certain types to be good teachers at all to begin with and many of these just perpetuate the stereotypes for each MBTI. Or maybe I just have a different definition of what makes a good teacher. Subject matter knowledge can be obtained and mastered well enough by any type, but it's making that information understandable to the audience that makes them good. Plenty of people lecture all day about a topic, but they don't necessarily explain it well or make it understandable. Many teachers aren't good simply because they don't give a crap about the students, just that they get paid.   ESTP = sports, ISTP=woodworking, ISFP=artist... I mean it's like they pulled that straight out of the stereotype, intuitive-biased personality descriptions. Maybe if I have time after work I'll sit down and write out what I think works better."
mbti,39xv9x,felmarah,3,Mon Jun 15 18:52:03 2015 UTC,"Sure, I agree. I'm not putting this article up with the intention of saying, ""Here's what your type is good at. Go use this as concrete information now."" I think what it's saying is, ""Here is where you would most likely thrive best in terms of teaching style, natural abilities, and thinking methods."" Mainly what I found interesting is seeing the functions ""in action.""  I was also hoping that it might add to the information pool for people. It could lead to solidifying or re evaluating people's own type or others' types. It is a bit simplified, but I appreciate the descriptions.  If not any of that, it's at least fun to read. ;)"
mbti,39xv9x,felmarah,2,Mon Jun 15 19:59:08 2015 UTC,"It could lead to solidifying or re evaluating people's own type or others' types.   But this is where it becomes dangerous -- if a person thinks they are a particular type due to the stereotypes (Oh my friend is definitely ESTP because he's such a sports freak adrenaline junkie! And that quiet person painting in the corner is probably ISFP!) they can get their type wrong. Which I guess isn't so bad, it happens all the time and it's not like it's truly detrimental to a person. Sure the descriptions are fun and I love reading this type of stuff for giggles, but I can't say they ever help me solidify my type. I have never tested as ISTP or related to the personality descriptions, but my information processing works that way functionally. And dammit I relate to a ton of posts in /r/istp more than the INFJ I tested as or related to from descriptions.   ""Here is where you would most likely thrive best in terms of teaching style, natural abilities, and thinking methods."" Mainly what I found interesting is seeing the functions ""in action.""   The descriptions that had functions in action weren't all that great though. Sure, if a person were interested in and knew about programming and were also an INTP then    they know how programming languages work, they know the complex syntax of programming with Ne/Ti   but it's not because of Ne/Ti. It's because they sat down and learned it. ISTPs, ENTPs, ISTJs, and INTJs are often found in these fields too and it isn't because of Ne/Ti, it's because they had an interest and were able to pick it up before feeling defeated. Defeat often results from poor teaching & catering to an audience that thinks the same way you do or can learn just by reading, but that's just my personal soap box.... I'm not really that great at MBTI to be honest, I'm still working things out and learning, but if we do a simple rundown of how each type would actually teach because of the way they process information, you probably would see that each type would go about it somewhat differently, each with their own flaws and advantages & sure some cater better to the arts or sciences, but really it boils down to this: yes you love this subject & understand it very well in your own way. Now how do you get other people to understand it? Simple analogies? Demos? Stories? Textbooks? Something that is all the rage in higher education right now is the flipped classroom which uses hands on activity in class to apply what students have read to foster a better & deeper understanding of the material. This is probably very much in the territory of higher Se users, but I think NFs see that the method works and are concerned more with what is best for the individual. The NTs and STJs seem to be slightly more against this mode of teaching in favor of the traditional lecture model (in my experience so far anyway).   Sorry if I sound confrontational, I just want to explain my thoughts. I do enjoy reading these for fun, but can't help trying to discuss it seriously anyway :P"
mbti,39xv9x,bezald,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:24:27 2015 UTC,"I agree, which is why I didn't say something as concrete as ""will solidify."" I can't look into someone's brain and see how they literally think, so typing people is hard even though I've studied the functions and anything else I can get my hands on. I feel like we all have to resort to ""stereotype-ish"" observations and behaviors. Of course, if you have your own tips for typing people, I'd be interested in hearing them.   I agree, but I read it as INTPs having a better affinity for programming than maybe the other types, not literally knowing programming right off the bat. The writer should've instead said something like, ""they're naturally good at dealing with processes that involve programming"" or something. I have no idea how extensively the author studied the functions though. You made me think of something. Perhaps an ISFP could become really good at programming, but it would require approaching it a different way. They would then have a powerful advantage over others, because they would be able to do different things with programming. That's all fine and dandy until they decide to become a teacher though, which is when they hope the class isn't filled with INTPs who won't understand a word they say. That's where this article comes into play.   I like to pick things apart too so don't worry, I don't think you sound confrontational ha. :P  So now I'm wondering, which types do you relate to the most in the article?"
mbti,39xv9x,bezald,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:21:45 2015 UTC,"I can't say I relate to any in particular. I have teaching experience and will likely end up teaching in the long run. My interests are teaching quantitative and computational skills to biologists/bench scientists.    That's all fine and dandy until they decide to become a teacher though, which is when they hope the class isn't filled with INTPs who won't understand a word they say.    Which is precisely the problem. An INTP teaching a room full of NTPs is going to have no complaints. But toss in some sensors or NJs and all of a sudden you get students that are ""lazy"" or ""incompetent"" because they didn't get the material right away the way you are teaching it. If only INTPs go into programming and teaching programming we are narrowing that field and school of thought so very much when the tools are very much applicable to many fields. With everyone thinking the same way, progress and creativity can stall. There is a HUGE disconnect between bench scientists and engineers for this very reason! The engineers/programmers only focus on their field and don't understand the biology/physics/whatever and vice versa. When coming together for collaboration there can be a lot of frustration and miscommunication as a result. I've seen this first hand. And at the very least working toward integrating the subjects and teaching student to think in ways they didn't before requires multiple approaches that take into account the fact that some students learn with hands-on activity and others through theory. A good teacher will take their students' successes and failures, learn from them, and adjust their teaching to fit. As far as subjects I've taught... I've done basic physics, astronomy, and bioinformatics/basic scientific programming. And let me tell you, these rooms are filled with all types & the ones that need the most help & the ones you need to cater to aren't the ones that are going into the field. And since the field is filled with NTPs and NTJs (physics & CS seem to be anyhow), the classes seem catered toward them and push out the others because they are speaking the same language. Those types seem to be fine with the material through reading and theory regardless of teaching ability anyway. I'm not the type of person that teaches to teach brilliant and talented students that will get the material and be interested in the subject regardless. I want the challenge of convincing someone the subjects I teach are not only interesting, but that they can also learn it/become good at it. I don't want someone to give up because they feel stupid for not getting it right away."
mbti,39xv9x,kirils1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:40:33 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Cool that you're into teaching!   I had this problem in high school. I just wasn't getting it--->required me to do wayyy more work than the others--->me getting burnt out and not trying anymore--->almost failing and feeling like I sucked at life. Lol. It actually made me question my intelligence and caused me to feel inadequate. The teachers were patient, but they just weren't my style. College was a completely different story and made me realize that maybe I wasn't dumb, just different (although I could still very well be dumb, lol).    That does seem like a big problem. Perhaps each type of scientist could be made aware of the others' methods of thinking, rather than trying to understand it themselves. I imagine it as preparation, like how the MBTI could prepare certain types for other types. I'm not going to be able to force myself to think like an ENFP, but I can be told things like, ""Here's how they'll probably approach this. Here's how you can communicate best with them."" Perhaps that awareness would be enough. From there, each type of scientist could leave the work up to the other group and trust in them, but at least know what's going on and why they're doing it. People need an overview and explanation of things so they can see how it all fits together. I'm sure you know all this, but that's my outside view based on little information. I actually have quite a few misunderstandings with my boss, but after he explains the why behind it, I don't doubt it anymore and I go with it.   Being a teacher sounds challenging. I don't even know how 1 teacher would teach several different styles at once, not to mention the textbook is also written in a certain style and can't really be flexible. That's why I liked college. You got to pick your teacher and even try them out/drop the class if you wanted. I'm a big fan of customization and ""try before you buy"" lol. I think it's great that you observe the students and adjust accordingly. :)"

When she visited Edinburgh, people tended to be much friendlier and she let loose more.  But as for fundamentally changing your type, nah. At least not in MBTI/Jungian terms"

Factors such as introversion/extroversion and neurotisicm are, IMO, more likely able to be linked to genetic inheritance of things such as  neurotransmitter receptors, and fluctuations in different hormone axes.  These types of things most certainly could be affected by nationality/race, especially in more genetically homogeneous cultures (think diabetes rates and cancer risks, also linked to genetics, that can vary widely between different cultures/races)  Now, the other personality traits such as usage of values versus logic (feeling vs. thinking) are probably more difficult to pinpoint where they originate during personality formation which would make it much more difficult to associate those particular traits with a particular nationality."

mbti,39w8g1,TooGayy,2,Tue Jun 16 12:10:44 2015 UTC,do you have issues asking for help?   I think this is common of high Fe users in general. We're so used to doing things for other people that we forget our own needs :p
mbti,39w8g1,sconsey_cider,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:35:30 2015 UTC,I also have issues asking for help. But I think that's more of the feeling that I should be the one with my shit together not having to ask for help.  I had to ask for help alot through a period in my life. I didn't like it.
mbti,39w8g1,sconsey_cider,2,Mon Jun 15 22:50:47 2015 UTC,I notice that ESFJs have incredibly expressive eyes... even when they aren't doing anything. I like it. They're approachable and very kind to me. ヽ(⌒∇⌒)ﾉ

mbti,39vr86,ThatsAllFolks42,5,Mon Jun 15 04:57:33 2015 UTC,"There's two ways to get yourself a type code. Assign yourself four letters by taking a test (or doing it manually), or figure out what cognitive functions (~=go-to habits for taking in, evaluating and organizing information) you use. Both give you a same kind of code because of shared history, but the meaning behind the code is different. Using a test to get a code and then look what kind of functions you're supposed to use from that is usually a bad idea (for example, I often get IxTP results from tests - this would mean I use Ti, which I don't - I'm a very clear Te type).  The test ranks you on four different scales that are more or less separate from each other - ie. your score on one shouldn't influence your score on the others much at all.  What the test letters mean, roughly: I/E = introverted/extroverted. Do you like being out and about, esp. around people. N/S = Abstract-minded or concrete person. F/T = Do you reason more on sentiment and good/bad type of judgment or in a cold, detached way. P/J = How organized, scheduled, conscientious you are. The more P, the more disorganized and spontaneous, the more J, the more organized and planned.      The other way is to figure out what functions you use.  The functional approach is a rough a model that tries to explain how you take in, evaluate and organize information by dividing the information processing into four core processes (Thinking, Feeling, Sensing and iNtuition) each of which has two attitudes (ie. extraversion, or interest in the external world, and introversion, ie. interest in what is going on inside your head) and then figuring out which processes you use in what attitudes. They're often shortened to a function code of Core process and Attitude, ie. Sensing in the extroverted attitude = Se.  Two examples would be an inclination to use the Thinking function focusing more on personal models (introverted Thinking, Ti) and their accuracy or the state of the outside world or analyzed system (extroverted Thinking, Te) and exerting control over it, or using Feeling to focus more on the harmony of the group (extroverted Feeling, Fe) or being true to yourself (introverted Feeling, Fi).  In the theory, functions always come in opposite pairs: If your Sensing function is interested in the outside world, your Intuition will be driven to explore your inner world - they come in four axes:  Perceiving: Se/Ni Si/Ne      Judging: Te/Fi Ti/Fe      Each of these tends to give a person a peculiar character unique to that axis.  Bear in mind these are tendencies, not straitjackets. That I tend to do cold, detached thinking in a certain way does not preclude me of doing eg. symbolic logic even though a Ti user's thinking habits make it much lighter work for him - this is about temperament and cognitive habits, not capability, after all. We have physicists who repress their Te function, for example.  Once you know your function-attitudes, you order them into a stack, so that you have the functions going PJJP or JPPJ (P=Perceiving function, ie. Sensing or Intuition, J= Judging or evaluating function, ie. Thinking and Feeling) and attitudes go IEIE or EIEI.  A rough guide:  Dominant: What you compulsively do, often to the point you're unaware of it. Easily capable of nuanced handling of things.      Auxiliary: What you habitually do, strength you're more conscious of. Capable of nuanced handling of things.      Tertiary: Usable tool, often unconscious until brought up. Can be strong, but isn't as capable of nuance as the primary functions - this can result in it just being off in its conclusions, or having a naive quality to it.  Inferior: Unconscious, ideal to strive for, point of weakness. Prone to related addict-like behavior. Conclusions drawn from the inferior tend to be starkly black and white.  Some more about stack order: http://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/37fuei/letters_to_functions/  There's two places that consistently make good functions-centric typology content with the 4 function stack model in mind and without much pollution from other systems. Michael Pierce's Youtube channel and the CelebrityTypes website.  For starting out, this playlist by Michael Pierce is probably the best introduction to typology on the 'net - it's certainly what made a sea of impossible jargon click for me the first time:  Lessons on functions-based typology by Michael Pierce  Celebritytypes has good comparison tables for the different functions - this is probably good to look at side by side with Pierce's introductory videos.  After the Lessons:  Pierce's portraits of the sixteen types in video  Pierce's portraits of the sixteen types as text  Another look at the functions by Pierce  CelebrityTypes' articles section is full of good stuff  Some longer posts I've written on Thinking, Feeling and Intuitive functions, no Sensing one yet ;__;  An explanation of what I think a function is and especially is not, using Te and Ti as examples, plus some elaboration on their nature  Observations on the differences between Fe and Fi  The difference between Ne and Ni"

mbti,39vr86,nulloid,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:13:19 2015 UTC,"These are my understandings of the cognitive functions, provided they are dominant ones. Inferior functions manifest in crazy ways.  Perceiving:  Ni: Merging ideas into one meta-idea, having a firm idea on how the future will be, having a vision  Ne: Exploring ideas, seeing connections between different concepts, brainstorming  Si: Recalling memories, recognizing what is customary, having a sense of tradition  Se: Exploring physical stimuli, living in the moment, feeling the whole-body sensations, reading visible cues  Judging:  Ti: Categorizing, analyzing for internal consistency, spotting logical errors in a concept  Te: Planning, having step-by-step instructions of how to make and measure progress  Fi: Assessing a value / belief system / person for moral consistency (how true a person is to themself)  Fe: Creating harmony between people / values / beliefs  So to look at it in a more abstract way:  Introverted functions are concerned about the internals of a thing  Extroverted functions are concerned about the relationships of things  Judging functions are all about checking and implementing concepts  Perceiving functions are all about synthesizing and creating concepts"
mbti,39vr86,CrateredMoon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:10:16 2015 UTC,"If you are a ""P"" your first extroverted function is a perceiving function (S,N). If you are a ""J"" your first extroverted function is a judging function (T,F). Jung places introversion/extroversion first over any of the functions, and in this case extroversion and introversion isn't necessarily based on activity levels or sociability, but rather whether or not your focus lies in the extroverted ""what is that?"", or the introverted ""what am I."", although the issue can be muddled based on personal experience... But you should have a pretty good handle on whether or not your primary concern is on objective reality (E), or subjective experience(I).  That said, in mbti, you would probably be better suited in determining your lead function, but I think the that the I/E distinction is a good start...  The next step would be to determine whether you are a perciever or judger... This is more or less a matter of ""J"" wanting to exert will and utility onto the world, or ""P"" aiming to see the world in its raw form (while this may seem in contradiction to the first paragraph, you want it simplified and if something about the distinction between I/E and P/J seems unclear, feel free to ask follow up questions or wait for others to chime in).  I'm going start with percievers as you have yourself pegged as ENXP, and so when we determine the difference between intuitives and sensors, what is most crucial is whether or not perception is largely viewed in terms of detailed, real-time physical happenings (S), or abstraction of sense data into abstract principals... While it can be dangerous to paint in broad strokes, if you appreciate brevity, it would be enlightening to say that S prefers concrete data, while N is more speculative in trying to make the data intelligible and useful... A great example would be language, where one could concentrate ate on the actual sounds being produced (S) versus the approximations inherent and the ideas that they represent (N).  DISCLAIMER: Heuristics are more readily employed with increased experience, skewing towards an ""N"" bias. The past is to be honestly examined with special attention to prevailing trends when faced with perception of the unfamiliar.  Bringing us to T and F, which, being a judging function, would best be determined regarding utility. Introverted F (Fi), would carry a compulsion towards acting on ones own values and motives, whereas Fe would focus on an awareness of external values and motives (those that come from society, seperate individuals and what have you). Te would be more concerned with objective verification of thought process and empirical validity (thing ""logic"" and ""facts""), while Ti would likely be somewhat vague and nebulous, more concerned with coming to conclusions not rather than verifying the validity of said conclusions...  While there could be questions as to whether Ne or Te is higher in your stack, I'm kind of picking up both, and so my guess would be ENFP with an intellectual bent or of ESTJ  with a  psychological backlash or a trained awareness set on employing the inferior function....  Shit, you could be ENTP, I GUESS ILL JUST LET MY COMMENTS STAND FOR THE MOMENT."
mbti,39vr86,kalg,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:13:42 2015 UTC,"If you are an ENxP, then your primary function is Extraverted Intuition (Ne). Your secondary function will either be Introverted Thinking (Ti) or Introverted Feeling (Fi), depending on whether you're an ENTP or an ENFP. Your tertiary function, a weaker, but still helpful dude, will be the opposite of your secondary - so if Ti is 2nd, then Extraverted Feeling (Fe) is third; if Fi is 2nd, Extraverted Thinking (Te) is third. Your inferior function is the opposite of your primary function. This fellow develops later in life and generally comes out uncontrolled and in stressful situations. Since your primary is Ne, your inferior is Introvered Sensing (Si).  An ENTP is then Ne > Ti > Fe > Si. An ENFP is Ne > Fi > Te > Si.  As you can see the biggest difference between the two is the middle two functions. Ti and Te are not the same; Ti strives for internally consistent thought processes, while Te strives to organize the outside world. Same with Fi and Fe; Fi wants an authentic sense of self, while Fe wants harmony with others. What you'll want to look into is if you use Ti/Fe or Fi/Te to support your dominant Ne.  And since you asked, all SJs are Si dominant or secondary (SiTe, SiFe, TeSi, FeSi) and all SPs are Se dominant or secondary (SeTi, SeFi, TiSe, FiSe), but NFs (NeFi, NiFe, FiNe, FeNi) and NTs (NeTi, NiTe, TiNe, TeNi) are not grouped based on dominant functions."
mbti,39vr86,aNinjaWithAIDS,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:51:11 2015 UTC,"While This video is more about comparing/contrasting INFJ vs INFP, it goes through the functions with stupidly simple outlines edited into the video itself. The uploader commentates on the functions a lot in many of his videos, so I suggest looking into his other type comparisons. Also, this site has excellent summaries on each of the functions.  The temperament groups (SJ, SP, NF, and NT) are really about these many types' having similar thoughts, goals, and lifestyles to each other despite having other differences. Sure, an ESFP is going to drain the hell away from an ISTP like me, but we both have that hands-on and heads-up approach to the physical world around us (Se) that we aren't exactly too separate in what we are looking for in life.   When it comes to the NF's and the NT's, they may have different approaches to how they accomplish their goals, but said goals and reasons are usually very similar to their respectively kindred personalities."
mbti,39uxnu,yzb3,10,Mon Jun 15 00:23:45 2015 UTC,I fully believe Tyler is an ESTP. Half his philosophy is about living in the here and now
mbti,39uxnu,zeroffn,2,Mon Jun 15 02:27:15 2015 UTC,"Tyler while giving off the vibe of an ESTP, I do think is an ENTP. He has thought it all out to well for an ESTP in my opinion which is very much an ENTP thing. He fucks with the narrator's head in a very intricate way that honestly I think an ENTP would be able to pull of but not an ESTP.   I am not saying that ESTPs could not do what he did but he is too big picture for an ESTP, having a few ESTP friends I know from experience that only one of them has any idea what is going on in the world by political or even just basic news facts and are all in no way thinking about the ""greater good"" but more what is better for themselves or those around them that is directly affecting their environment. Unlike Tyler who VERY much looks at the big wide world and not his little world around him.  It is a difficult one though due to him being made up in the narrator's mind but it is still one of the most influential films I have ever watched and genuinely changed my outlook on life which no other film had ever done."
mbti,39uxnu,that_one_entp,2,Fri Jun 19 22:39:42 2015 UTC,"Hm, I find your argument interesting. Mostly I go with the thought that alot of people mistype ESTPs that don't quite fit the stereotype. ""Oh, smart and can look at the big picture? He must be an ENTP!"" And I have a freaking brilliant ESTP friend, who Tyler reminded me of more than of myself, it fits more to me.  But I just noticed, alot of people who argue for ENTP primarily use project mayhem Tyler as an example, while I feel like early film Tyler is completely and inarguably an Se-dom. Which I also feel like justifies that typing by looking at inferior Ni, because he starts out trying things like drinking and fighting and the way he is to try and help all the miserable guys around him and it never really changed the fact that there are always gonna be miserable people, so his Ni tells him that ""you've been trying this and this and it hasn't worked so far so it's never gonna work like that!"" Then he starts looking around and figures out it's just modern society making people miserable so he goes to change it.  An ENTP would've started with something like project mayhem"
mbti,39uxnu,zeroffn,2,Fri Jun 19 23:00:14 2015 UTC,"But maybe he's just playing with the narrator's head, maybe he had it all thought out. We don't know because we can't see in his head. The argument for him being ENTP is that he starts project mayhem and has a global outlook rather than a personal one. While the start of the film does point to ESTP, it is possible it was all an act to get the narrator on his side.   The narrator would never have agreed to go straight into project mayhem and maybe tyler knew that so realised he had to ease him into it. By that fact the way of getting what he wants he has to look like he does not know what he wants. From the outside looks like ESTP but manifests itself as ENTP.   I think he is an ENTP just due to the fact that I don't think it is possible for him to just fall from one situation to another which then ends up with him starting project mayhem. It is to well done, well thought out and fundamentally required a great deal of foresight. He knew the world around him and he knew what it needed and he knew how to build it and from that he started from the bottom and built it from the ground up rather than just going straight to project mayhem."
mbti,39uxnu,that_one_entp,2,Fri Jun 19 23:14:51 2015 UTC,"it is possible it was all an act to get the narrator on his side.   While not necessarily agreeing, I think that's the best argument for the N I've ever heard. Hm, I give equal weight to my theory and yours for now. Just for now. You're on thin ice, buddy"
mbti,39uxnu,zeroffn,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:28:46 2015 UTC,"I will take that as a win for both of us. You now see that both sides are possible, ESTP or ENTP, and I got to spout about how much of a fight club nerd I am."

mbti,39uxnu,zeroffn,3,Sat Jun 20 00:55:10 2015 UTC,"I disagree, overall his goals are mostly big picture. He has intricate clever plans for every situation and reacts very well under pressure. Also the constant self-help philosophies point way more towards ENTP than ESTP."
mbti,39uxnu,Osetic,12,Mon Jun 15 02:38:51 2015 UTC,Don't be ridiculous. Do you honestly believe those things are strictly an N thing?   He has intricate clever plans for every situation and reacts very well under pressure   Even by your own description he's an ESTP.
mbti,39uxnu,sconsey_cider,3,Mon Jun 15 05:11:29 2015 UTC,"I don't have a type in mind for Tyler Durden, but based on any ESTP I've ever met, or hell any Se dom, I'd say he's more likely an ISTP."

mbti,39usuy,districtly,4,Sun Jun 14 23:38:55 2015 UTC,"They make some good points.   Interested in what you folks think. I'm pretty into personal development stuff.  /r/mbti talk begins around 21 minutes 30 seconds.  (But you should listen to the first 20 minutes to get the full explanation of the model.)  Their main point is basically that it's not meaningful enough just to be a subject matter expert in MBTI. What really matters is using that knowledge to help people. From their perspective, the Personality Hackers feel they see a lot of one-upmanship and argument in the various online MBTI communities.  I can't say I disagree entirely, but there are definitely some amazing people and gems of wisdom around here, and IMO my time browsing the MBTI subreddits has been beneficial to my development. (That might not always hold true, but it's working for me right now.)"
mbti,39usuy,bezald,7,Sun Jun 14 23:49:05 2015 UTC,"Friction and oneupmanish just seem to be a reality of all large online communities. It's the nature of different people trying to understand things to the depth and breadth they themselves like--their own subjective approaches. I think there's room for all of it, or rather, just one approach/attitude probably won't suffice for everyone.   PersonalityHacker has a very specific self-help mission as a company, which is admirable, but it doesn't mean that everyone needs to go about things in the same exact way. People can learn all kinds of things just for the sake of knowledge/indirect awareness of things, and I think that's okay too. my 2 cents"
mbti,39usuy,TK4442,3,Mon Jun 15 00:42:15 2015 UTC,"I can't do podcasts very easily, so I appreciate this text description.   What really matters is using that knowledge to help people. From their perspective, the Personality Hackers feel they see a lot of one-upmanship and argument in the various online MBTI communities.   I don't know what that means to them, but it seems like it might partially converge with some of what I don't like about what's happened to r/mbti. Like, it seems to get way too theoretical and nitpicky and ungrounded, and thus encourages proliferating-weed-like participation from individuals who act like experts to get some sort of benefit for their egos or whatever, but are mostly internet creations/personas with little actual experience in using this material in good and helpful ways in their actual non-internet/three-dimensional life.   I don't know if that's what they're saying, though."
mbti,39usuy,redearth,3,Mon Jun 15 03:40:04 2015 UTC,"The ego-driven desire to be an expert and to one-up oneself overlaps with what they said. The theoretical vs. practical experience part doesn't... well, not exactly.   They were suggesting that our understanding of MBTI is always conceptual rather than empirical, and that in the absence of a clear, objective ""truth"", we tend to want to validate what we already believe and compete with other opinions that challenge our own concepts.  But their main point was that this happens because online MBTI communities don't really have a cohesive goal, so people put more energy into satisfying their own egos than toward advancing the group. In a nutshell, ""I"" instead of ""we""."

mbti,39usuy,TK4442,0,Mon Jun 15 19:44:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that expanded summary!  That's some interesting stuff.   Thinking out loud. This turned out really long and only tangentially related to what they were actually saying (as you so helpfully expanded on).   They were suggesting that our understanding of MBTI is always conceptual rather than empirical, and that in the absence of a clear, objective ""truth"", we tend to want to validate what we already believe and compete with other opinions that challenge our own concepts.   IMO There's nothing wrong with conceptual understanding, as long as the concepts have practical value in everyday life. I've never understood the whole ""I need this to be clear empirical truth"" thing. In my case, it's like: ""Wow, this actually maps to - and is useful in - my actual non-internet-forum life in a way that has had and continues to have a really positive impact.""  I don't care if it's objective truth in any empirical way, just as I don't care if anyone empirically validates the use of a physical tool that I have been successfully using for a long time with clear practical results.   I keep thinking the disembodied and somewhat fake nature of screennames on the internet may be related somehow. Seems to me that as things have fallen apart with r/mbti, the people who thrive best in this environment are unfortunately the fake ones. Meaning, the ones who use the tools of the reddit context to build and project a false identity/persona that is different and disconnected from how they live their actual day to day lives. So there is no way to really deal with concepts having practical value in actual life"" for participants in that space. Everything is two-dimensional and fake - a made-up story.   In other words: From that space, the whole world, the whole field of interaction, is made up of the internet discussion. The only thing that happens in that two-dimensional world are theoretical discussions. because concepts can't be grounded as practical tools in the awesome complexity of non-created (not based on a two-dimensional created persona) real life because of the hard-core disconnect between that life and the internet persona.  So places like r/mbti end up feeling dead and supporting a sort of deadness. And in that kind of void, where there is no actual link to that rich, complex, vivid and not under your control"" world of actual life (as opposed to two-dimensional false stories designed to stroke and protect an ego) life, if somehow being right or seeming like an expert - protecting an appearance in any case, because it's all appearance and no real lived substance -  becomes really important. I would guess that there are different motivation depending on the persona created and the specific void it fills for those who create the disconnected-from-actual-life personas.   But their main point was that this happens because online MBTI communities don't really have a cohesive goal, so people put more energy into satisfying their own egos than toward advancing the group. In a nutshell, ""I"" instead of ""we"".   As someone who was involved for quite some time with organizations and movements seeking to make social change, I'm just going to say: While that a goal may sound impressive or whatever on paper ... even if it's do-able in this context (which it isn't), such endeavors aren't ever as magnificent and lofty as the words imply they are. There are plenty of egos in those situations. Just often more hidden."

mbti,39smv9,BadgerKid96,5,Sun Jun 14 14:53:50 2015 UTC,Rick is so ENTP it hurts. After some quick Googling I'd go with INFP for Morty.

Everyone listed below the reasons why his personality looks like ISFJ, but there is also the fact that Rick says Morty has ""complimentary brain waves"" to his own which lends credence to the fact that Morty would be an opposite type to his own."

mbti,39saps,maresayshi,6,Sun Jun 14 07:17:20 2015 UTC,"I haven't smoked weed in a couple of years. But when I did, I was amazed by how significant this experience was to me. The other people I was doing it with wasn't getting the same sort of high it seemed. They felt it more in their body and wasn't talking of it the way I was.  When I took it, it felt like I entered the heavens. Music became graphic images swirling by, a bit of chocolate a ship sailing on the stormy sea of my tongue. The feelings I got were those of deep nostalgia, strongly significant to me. Like the sort of feeling you associate with some distant, dear memory.  Back then I was like 17-18 or something. It started getting less and less significant and eventually I stopped, as it didn't really give me anything in the end. That period of my life I really cared a lot about childhood nostalgia and I could sort of conjure the same feelings I had felt, especially on weed.  Nowadays I don't care too much about nostalgia. I think some people (maybe INFP's?) can get into these kind of feelings as they transition into adulthood. Now, in my mid-twenties, I think I would react similarly to how my friends did back then, just laughter and body-high."
mbti,39saps,eoom,2,Sun Jun 14 09:45:39 2015 UTC,"Marijuana is less addictive than tobacco, but I wonder what damage it does. It would seem more significant since it affects the senses of the user, but it's definitely less harmful in some respect since nicotine is cancerogenic.  PS: Nvm, it's similar to tobacco smoke, so chemically it does have carcinogens, it's a psychoactive substance, so it depends on the psychological state of the user. Only heavy, long term use is harmful, and since it's not addictive like tobacco, that's less of an occurrence."
mbti,39saps,CritSrc,2,Sun Jun 14 10:58:00 2015 UTC,"Just fyi, there isn't sufficient evidence that nicotine is carcinogenic. It does have negative effects on the cardiovascular system though."

mbti,39saps,bezald,3,Mon Jun 15 01:40:00 2015 UTC,"I agree on the alcohol one, and I really enjoy the boost it gives my Ne.  Weed, nicotine, and caffeine all send my Si into hyperdrive, which for me is disturbing because it's my inferior function, so I get stuck in negative thought loops and feel very anxious even though I know that what I'm fixating on doesn't matter.  It's interesting you mention Ti with adderall.. I was on adderall all through middle school and maybe that was why I feel like I was weirdly INTP then for someone who definitely acts Ne/Fi now.  I've been wanting to try mushies and LSD since I don't like how weed makes me feel. Or, who knows, maybe I was just taking too much before. More experimentation is needed, once I stop having to be drug tested."

mbti,39pb1s,skepticismismynature,5,Sat Jun 13 12:58:29 2015 UTC,"Smells like ENTP.  That said, the point of typing yourself is not to get a club membership card, but to figure out the processes your brain is drawn to use when taking in, evaluating and organizing information so you can play the hand you've been dealt with well.  For starting out on that path, this playlist by Michael Pierce is probably the best introduction to typology on the 'net - it's certainly what made a sea of impossible jargon click for me the first time:  Lessons on functions-based typology by Michael Pierce  Celebritytypes has good comparison tables for the different functions - this is probably good to look at side by side with Pierce's introductory videos.

mbti,39pb1s,Komatik,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:45:20 2015 UTC,Oh I know. I have been learning MBTI for a year now. I know that Youtube channel. The guy is pretty awesome.  I setup this thread as I need to figure out my type. I tend to get way too skeptic if I type myself so hence this post :)
mbti,39pb1s,INTPenetrator,5,Sat Jun 13 23:58:22 2015 UTC,"I have a deep passionate desire to learn. To me the universe is there to be understood. I cannot just follow anything that is not logical or simple requires faith to be followed. I am highly critical and tend to have this itch to fix people's mistake and I love to get into debates for the sake of questioning the idea, testing out its integrity and proving a point.   Ti   I also love to take up multiple hobbies and love to be busy (although it could be physically tiring). I love to go and do many things and have a large list of things to do. I love to read, make art, go out with people, teach, learn new stuff (ranging from learning a harmonica to learning philosophy), try out new things, 'debate and discuss ideas' etc.! It excites me!   _N_P  traits   Although I also love to push people into being a better person of who they are. I know how hard it is to do things and I can easily understand people and empathize. I want to motivate and inspire people. I want to help and treat people the best I could.   Fe   I love to analyze concepts and ideas and find a fault in them. This is the reason why I left religion but am still very open to it as I do think that existence of a God is logical and possible BUT just as possible as there being no God, but I do find religion to have way too many logical errors and fallacies to consider to be from a 'God'. This is part of me trying to understand the universe as IF there is a God then that is the best way to understand BUT I do find it highly unlikely so I want to become a Quantum Physicist.   Ti   I love to question, research and study the unknown. I basically love to have a large collection of things I know :3   Si   I don't hate authority but once they get controlling, annoying or unobjective (not subjective but rather loses focus on what they have to do) that's when I get pissed.   Hmmm  Ti?  (valuing autonomy)   I am extremely skeptic and would love a full detailed explanation rather than a vague explanation with too many questions to be asked...   Ti, and something else, can't quite put my finger on it.  From that I would conclude either ENTP or INTP.  Now you mentioned your Enneagram type being 6.  Let's see for which type 6 is more common. If it's a huge difference that might be indicative.  I'm looking at a little chart, but I see there's too much overlap. There are about equally as many type 6 INTPs as ENTPs (percentage wise). INTPs tend to most often be type 5, and ENTPs tend to most often be type 3 or 7. But for type 6 they are about equal.  Let's examine your Inferior function. They are different for INTP and ENTP, and it drastically changes how you react under stress.  INTP: Ti Ne Si Fe  ENTP: Ne Ti Fe Si  Looking up some descriptions, but I'm suddenly overcome with laziness! Doh! Lol.  BUT, I got an idea.  Just look at these and tell us which is more like you:  https://www.opp.com/~/media/Images/Content-images/MBTI%20stress%20heads/ENTPstresshead.jpg  or  https://www.opp.com/~/media/Images/Content-images/MBTI%20stress%20heads/INTPstresshead.jpg  You're welcome :)"
mbti,39pb1s,jermofo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:24:59 2015 UTC,"Hmm I relate to both stressors.  ENTP: I can be stressed out by inefficiency, too many details , my analysis being dismissed and to some degree if my competence is not respected, but I am not really stressed by Isolation infact I like it!  INTP: Everything except socializing, and to some degree challenging my competence. Everything else can stress me out.  Thank you for the analysis , it did made me confident in my initial thoughts of my type but I have some questions.  What is the difference between inferior Fe and tertiary Fe?  In all honesty I think my Fe is somewhat strong but does not overcome my Ti that's for sure.  Give me a scenario where Fe vs Ti comes into play. Thanks again."
mbti,39pb1s,jermofo,2,Sat Jun 13 23:55:40 2015 UTC,"So you are definitely either an INTP or ENTP.  Usually Ne is the most easily identifiable function for me, however it is only slightly perceptible in your post.  Ti is by far the strongest function in what you wrote.  This would lead me to believe that you are an INTP. However, other pieces of your post makes me think your Fe is not inferior, and therefore, an ENTP.    As far as tertiary or inferior Fe, I'd say that if you have inferior Fe, your emotions are your Achilles Heel.  Do your emotions appear and disappear from out of nowhere and otherwise don't affect your life? I think of this like a storm cloud on an otherwise typical day.  INTP.  Are you more socially adept yet flighty? ENTP.    More horoscope like differences are INTPs are very simple or unaware of the way they dress, but spartan. We would rather blend in, than stand out. ENTPs will be unaware of how they should dress, but do so bombastically.  INTPs will dress in a way to not stand out, where as ENTPs will be comfortable being outwardly eccentric, like wearing purple, funky glasses, or basically stand out in this little way.  INTPs are inwardly eccentric."
mbti,39pb1s,jermofo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:07:34 2015 UTC,"Sorry for this late response but if Emotions are the achilles heel of INTP then what is it for the ENTP?  A person brought up that I maybe an INFJ/ENFJ thoughts about it as I would like to consider it as a possibilty.   ENFJ or INFJ? Since you're no S, you have to be either Ne or Ni. You said you like to have a large collection of things you know. This sounds like you're dominant or auxiliary Ni. It likes to collect data and predict the future. The whole religion paragraph sounds Ti. It seems like others see ENTP, but... do you think you have dominant Ne? Edit: You hate too many details, but you like to have a large collection of things you know. The hate for details prob comes from Si being a shadow function. If you were an ENTP, you could at least tolerate it as it would be your inferior function making it not completely unbearable. Ni confirmed. You said you also don't mind isolation... so it's likely that you are an INFJ."
mbti,39pb1s,TooGayy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:23:35 2015 UTC,"I kind of overlooked a detail when mentioning Inferior functions.  It has been often suggested that the inferior doesn't start to develop until your late teens roughly and since you are 17, you may not be conscious of it just yet or it is only just starting to surface.  That said, here is what I could piece together for Inferior Si:  A lot of it has to do with poor memory like loosing your keys, forgetting where you parked, remembering birthdays, what you had for breakfast yesterday,etc.  This is because it is the corollary to Ne, which gathers information compulsively, where as Si stores and recalls it.    Si also relates to inner body awareness.  When inferior, it is being disconnected with what is going on inside of you, like hypochondria.    Another aspect that kind of highlights the tug of war nature of the Dominant vs the Inferior has to do with the ritual nature of Si.  Ne leads you to explore and take your own path in life, especially in conjunction with Ti, it is very individualistic.  Inferior Si is that second guessing to play it safe and follow the rules or take the safe way in life.  For example, say your parents to want you to be a doctor, since they were both doctors and could really pave the road for you to succeed in that direction or maybe they want you to take over the family business.  It is not uncommon for any type want to do there own thing in life, but an ENTP may really feel compelled to blaze their own trail, but maybe second guess at time if the road less traveled is worth it at the expense of the easy road.  As I looked all this up and wrote it out, I found that I can identify with a lot of this myself, as an INTP.  The difference though is that since it isn't my Achilles Heel, I've been able to find work arounds to minimize problems.  They are much less pronounced. This is something I am much less able to do with my Fe.  Keep in mind that INTPs and ENTPs are almost the same type, with just a different order of preferences.  It may be hard to figure out exactly what your type is immediately, but you can learn a lot from both types. Hope this helps, and of course take this with a grain of salt as my amateur opinion and check things out for yourself."

mbti,39lm0r,JellyDynomite,5,Fri Jun 12 16:22:06 2015 UTC,"I think the grouping that I feel most comfortable with is the NP group. That's the only one where I look at the other three and think, yeah, I relate to those guys (INFP, INTP, ENTP) Probably because it's other Ne users and Ne is how I approach the world. I like how Personality Hacker calls Ne ""exploration"", and I definitely think of NPs as explorers.   Maybe I'm not as concerned with being grouped with other Fi users since I don't lead with it, so maybe an INFP would have a different opinion. Maybe xNTPs feel they relate more to other Ti users than other Ne users. I'm not sure since I'm biased toward the exploration function. Thoughts?"
mbti,39lm0r,burrit0z,3,Fri Jun 12 16:56:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe xNTPs feel they relate more to other Ti users than other Ne users. I'm not sure since I'm biased toward the exploration function. Thoughts?   I defiitely feel closest to the ENFP type and then the rest in the group, and I also think that this grouping is a better one for the ENTP type. I mean we're not ""rationalists"" that sort of implies rationality is a priority, while it's really more about like ""let's see what happens"".    I don't fully agree with the ""Explorer"" name, it has to be a little more crazy than that.  One thing I remember noticing about the ""NP"" group, is some article I randomly found online that was talking about how managers in the West are usually ""SJ"" but in Japan ""NP"". Idk if it's true, but generally with all that Japanese weird shit I think they are culturally being ""NP"" and all, at least some of the later generations."

And I say no for the more selfish reason that being 'motivational/inspirational/whatever' is one of the main things that ENFP descriptions talk about but it feels like more of a consolation prize in comparison to the other descriptions who actually do something cool (except ISTJs. I feel sorry for you guys - ""Duty-fulfillers"" make your best trait sound painfully boring).    NP: (ENTP, ENFP, INTP, INFP) Explorers   I think this is an excellent description.  I feel like this would be better if it were:   TJ: (ESTJ, ENTJ, INTJ, ISTJ) FJ: (ESFJ, ENFJ, INFJ, ISFJ) SP: (ESFP, ESTP, ISTP, ISFP) NP: (ENTP, ENFP, INTP, INFP) Explorers   This way, the judgers' judging functions are emphasised and the perceivers' perceiving functions are also emphasised. Obviously, I'm aware that the Ixxxs have perceiving functions as their first functions but I get the impression that they are more defined by the fact that MBTI classifies them as Judgers.

Types most likely to do this, therefore, are Fe-doms. ESFJ and ENFJ.  However, there are exceptions. An ENTP or ESTP stuck in a loop, for example, will be skimming over their Ti in favor of Fe, and will appear more attention-seeking and needy of acceptance than usual. If stuck like that for long enough, they could actually be mistaken for Fe-doms."
mbti,39j17y,SquirmGirl,2,Fri Jun 12 03:19:57 2015 UTC,Aren't ENFJ's very dominant though? (I would imagine do to Se and competitiveness)  As in they actively want to be the leader of the group.   Or is it more a matter of a socially skilled ENFJ having power thrust upon them because they're universally liked?
mbti,39j17y,SquirmGirl,6,Fri Jun 12 04:34:43 2015 UTC,"As in they actively want to be the leader of the group.    Often, yes, but they're more likely to get to the top by charming the group, appealing to their emotions, promising to get everyone's needs met, etc. ENTJs are more likely to become leader via dominance, ie: ""Okay, here's what's going on, here's what we need to do to accomplish change. The plan is x, and I need all of you to do y"" etc.   Or is it more a matter of a socially skilled ENFJ having power thrust upon them because they're universally liked?

Parasyte isn't a movie but it's recently made into an anime and it's ridiculously fi from episode one, constantly delivering some fi message or nugget of truth whenever possible."

mbti,39jpsz,-Leonhart,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:04:05 2015 UTC,Couldn't you argue though that it functions in more of an Ne manner? It's more in line with getting somewhere and seeing the possibility from there rather than having a focused vision. The movie makes use of rewinds when it hits a dead end in much the same way Ti would have to revise it's own entire logical construct upon failure. The elaborate network of imagination created is more suited to the architect personal on an INTP.   I dunno maybe I'm wrong. The movie just really spoke to me in that manner.
mbti,39jpsz,TrumanB-12,2,Sun Jun 14 01:09:15 2015 UTC,"Not really. I don't see anything Ne about the movie. I don't see it being interested in external exploration and connections as much as it is about finding one possible and plausible vision based on several possibilities present. It's the narrow and singular focus that suggests Ni over Ne. Ne stories are all driven by fantasy and world-building, because Ne stories are interested to see how far you can drive a certain possibility home e.g. Harry Potter, Neil Gaiman's works, Lord of the Rings etc.   The movie is very Fi as well, emphasizing personal sympathies and relationships and attachments. The answer to Nemo's inquiry was a very FiSe one - find what you appreciate in the present moment and then you know what you want and thus also, what future you want. It is also Ni because of how it explicitly deals with the future and future visions like that. Also, imagination isn't the same as Ti, nor do I see anything ""architectural"" about the plot either. It's not based on logic and internal consistency."

For instance, I love Pulp Fiction because of the dialog, and it was fun to finally 'get' all the references to it in shows like The Simpsons. But I also love The Men Who Stare at Goats, because I'm a fan of the occult, myth, wacky military projects which actually existed, Star Wars, and seeing someone lecture Ewan MacGregor on how to be a 'Jedi' tickles me."

mbti,39hre3,mistalsa,2,Thu Jun 11 21:21:12 2015 UTC,"If I understand correctly, the additional alignments (social, moral, rebel, impure) are supposed to represent the ""in between"" of the normal 9. Social means you follow the laws, but don't because you wholeheartedly believe in them, but because it's expected of you as a member of society. Moral is you do good not because it's ""right"", but because it will help someone out- you see a direct impact. Impure is the opposite- you don't want to harm people or cause destruction, but you are in it for you and you'll let the chips fall where they may. Rebel means you don't agree with the rules and will break them readily, but you don't want complete chaos. The characters are related to the alignments with varying degrees of accuracy.  Or that's how I interpreted it anyways. YMMV. I personally I'm  Rebel Moral."

Judging from the few interviews I've seen of her, I would only disagree that she is an extrovert. ISTJ seems likely, but I'm probably not a big enough fan to say that for sure.  As for Kanye West, I can more easily see him being an ISFJ than I can see 50 Cent being an ISFJ. Granted, I would listen/read any argument anyone could come up with for why he's that type, but that decision really baffled me.  I've heard a lot of people propose that Obama is an ENFJ rather than ENTP, but I've never heard a good argument for it. Seems like kind of a silly, stereotypical assumption that anyone who is a charismatic public speaker is automatically a Fe-dom.  Personally, I can't for the life of me see how they came to the conclusion that Victoria Beckham is an ESFJ. Friggin' ice bitch Posh Spice is an ESFJ? Give me a break. Look at this interview tell me that's an ESFJ. Hell, the very first remark Ellen makes about her is that she's a ""very private person."""

mbti,39fzep,Entr0pic08,2,Thu Jun 11 15:07:38 2015 UTC,"No, I don't have it wrong. Give one definition of fi that says that fi is defined by how much you can relate to other people. I will tell you right now that you won't find anything of the sort. The closest thing is how you relate to your own values, because fi operates on subjectively deciding based on like/dislike. Being fi actually means that one accepts one cannot actually relate to everyone or every person or situation, because fi recognizes the individual situation and that every person and their experiences are unique to them so what's true for one isn't true for another. That's lenore Thomson's fi in a nutshell almost quoted verbatim right there."
mbti,39fzep,Entr0pic08,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:52:57 2015 UTC,"You just come across as a troll. Being emotionally sensitive has nothing to do with cognitive functions. Being able to experience empathy got nothing to do with the functions either.   You could choose to listen and realize that Fi as a cognitive process, that is, how we take in information and reason about the world, is a very distinct and different quality compared to ability to relate to other people or experience empathy. It has absolutely no impact on you as a person and how you behave in the world more than you chose to classify yourself based on reasons that are actually not grounded in the theory as it is known and defined. You as a person remain the same, but the terminology that we'd use to explain how you operate would plausibly change. Therein lies the difference. We do not always relate to people who are the same type we are, because people are also incredibly diverse and despite sharing commonalities will also in many ways be extremely different. I don't relate to every INTJ I come across. So you also got my type wrong.   And please explain to me how a song like Stan is repressed Fe. Everything about the song Stan and that is just one example really, fits high quality Fi. I'll give you an example of repressed Fe in an ISTP: Robert Stjärnström, lead singer, songwriter and guitarist of the band Machinae Supremacy. Songs like these are exemplary of weak Fe in Ti types:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8CsM96SEtM  ""All eyes on me, gather all who believe. So far apart, united by heart.""  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF8ghssEMdo  It treats feeling as being out there, an object that we are oriented towards and affects us. I don't see that in Eminem's songs. Instead what I see are qualities of Fi as defined by Lenore Thomson, recognizing the life essence in other people and how their unique and independent needs as individuals clash."

mbti,39fzep,hephestust,5,Fri Jun 12 06:54:04 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with Kanye West being typed as an ISFJ. Si doesn't manifest the same in creative artists. As for Fe, he acts protectively towards his entourage, writes songs and albums to his mother or admiration to Jay Z (""Big Brother""). Writes an album about the crushing pressure of being a role model (Yeezus). He is extremely focused and hard-working. He sure doesn't represent traditional values, but it could be due to rap culture standards and models."
mbti,39fzep,sosplatano,6,Fri Jun 12 11:58:31 2015 UTC,"I think Fi is definitetly what he uses   The start of his career was him being told by pretty much every label he went to, that he should stick to being a producer. But he relented because he wanted complete creative control over everything he does.   First and foremost in his songs especially in the Graduation album, there is a strong message about how he is his own drive, not to mention that many of his songs are deeply introspective like with ""Runaway"" There's nothing more Fi than these two things outside selfishness."

Sorry, but I completely disagree. The way that the type descriptions are written these days like to try and lump each type into a stereotypical list of traits, which for many reasons, not everyone will identify with despite being that type. These type descriptions are also often biased towards sensors, being that the majority of MBTI enthusiasts/writers are intuitives. Sensors are often unfairly typed as being ""too grounded,"" unintelligent and uncreative. I can't tell you the number of times I've seen people deny their true  type because they don't like their type description. They'd rather identify, for example, with the ""endless witty, outstandingly creative and super duper smart"" ENFP. Thankfully, most of these people don't go on to immerse themselves too deeply in the theory...   Apparently Diana upon reading a description of an INFP became excited and giddy at how accurately it described her. Personally I had a very similar experience at reading an INFP description and I'm certain I'm not the only one.   You're certainly not the only one. I myself had the exact same thing happen to me when I first read the INFP type description. And the ENFP type description. And the INFJ type description. And the ENFJ description. Because these are all idealist types and I'm a friggin' idealist. Go figure.   Ultimately there currently isn't a perfect way to type, most tests are awful and highly unreliable with low test retest consistency.   Because they type by letter preference rather than cognitive functions.. There's thousands of explanations you can find online as to why these tests are often inaccurate. I personally explained some of the reasons here in this post.  Yes, there is no ""perfect way"" to type, because we're talking about personality theory. It's not an exact science, but aside from being tested by a professional, understanding the cognitive functions and how they're stacked per type tends to be agreed upon by most enthusiasts as the best way of determining one's type.   I'm inclined to trust someone to type themselves (particularly if they are very confident in their choice) as ultimately the individual is the best authority on their own cognition.   Oh god...dat Fi-dominance...it's blinding...  Ahem, anyway...  Look, when an individual vehemently denies truths about themselves which can only be revealed through identification of their cognitive functions, (which an unfortunately large amount of people in the MBTI community do) no, they are not the best authority of their type from a technical standpoint. I don't deny that you personally know your type best, nor do I deny that you are an INFP, but you need to understand that not everybody is as self-aware (or lucky?) as you. Personality theory may only be a theory, but there are still rules, and more efficient ways of testing. People who want to pick and choose which aspects of the theory suits their individual needs best, rather than put any effort towards understanding the functions at work behind their special type, might as well just dismiss the theory as a whole and pick up a new hobby.  /end rant"

mbti,39h0ix,ElDoRado1239,9,Thu Jun 11 17:36:36 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily trust the tests that much.  The way the tests measure it, they have four scales or dimensions they measure you on by your answers and list your preferences on those scales as your type code. Being near the middle is completely expected, and just measures the strength of your preference along those scales. Having no clear preference is just that, and completely normal.  The functional approach to type that is preferred on this subreddit is different - everyone is a Thinker and a Feeler, a Sensor and iNtuitive.  The functional approach is a rough a model that tries to explain how you take in, evaluate and organize information by dividing the information processing into four core processes (Thinking, Feeling, Sensing and Intuition) each of which has two attitudes (ie. extraversion, or interest in the external world, and introversion, ie. interest in what is going on inside your head) and then figuring out which processes you use in what attitudes. They're often shortened to a function code of Core process and Attitude, ie. Sensing in the extroverted attitude = Se.  Two examples would be using the Thinking function focusing more on personal models (introverted Thinking, Ti) or the state of the outside world or analyzed system (extroverted Thinking, Te), or using Feeling to focus more on the harmony of the group (extroverted Feeling, Fe) or being true to yourself (introverted Feeling, Fi).    Using your test scores to assign yourself a functional type is probably a bad idea: The tests measure what they measure, and the functions approach looks at something a bit different. They share history, so they use the same code, but the meaning behind the code is different.  Test ENTP v. ENTJ, for example, is basically whether the person is more haphazard and spontaneous or more planned, conscientious and orderly - it's directly what they measure.  In Function-land, where we look at how the person takes in, evaluates and organizes information, ENTPs and ENTJs use an entirely different set of processes:  ENTPs are primarily watchers who lead with extroverted Intuition (Ne) - it's an exploring, brainstorming kind of process that draws its inspiration from the outside world and is very interested in it, and complement that with Ti - an evaluating process that focuses on building accurate mental models of things. How the cogs turn is more important than what that turning accomplishes.  ENTJs lead with extroverted Thinking or Te - cold, detached reasoning like Ti, but focused on evaluating the properties of the outside world and exerting control over it, usually with the aim of ordering it to be more efficient. They complement this with introverted Intuition, which in contrast to Ne's curious exploration just drinks in tons of information and subconsciously finds patterns in there that it then condenses it into a holistic understanding of how something ticks that the Ni type himself often needs to work to ""map out"".  In short, they're totally different :D   Same applies to INTP vs. INFP - in test-land the difference is a slight preference to Thinking or Feeling, but in Function-land an INTPs primary processes are Ti (dominant) and Ne (auxiliary), while INFPs lead with Fi and use Ne as auxiliary - their compulsive, dominant process is different, which is a large change.    If that sounds like hebrew to you, I have good news. The good news is that functions are not that hard.  A function is just a pattern of operation that's ingrained in us, that we're drawn to, a way we do certain things, take in, process, organize information. Although they're often talked about as if they were spirits or something that possess us (because they do inform our behavior somewhat), they're not straitjackets that force you to do something, nor do you need a function to do something. I'm bad at symbolic logic because of the way I'm drawn to think when I think in a cold, impartial manner - someone else's ingrained pattern can be naturally suited to the exercise and they'll find it far lighter work than I do, for example.  The same way, some people are naturally concerned about how others feel about things and that a group they're in has a good vibe. I'm not wired to pay attention to that stuff, but I can if I decide to. But it's not an ingrained in me the way it is in some others.  A second strength of the functional approach is one I mentioned before. It is that it tells it like it is - everyone is a Thinker, a Feeler, a Sensor, everyone is iNtuitive. The functional approach says ""Everyone is a Thinker and a Feeler, but what kind of Thinker and Feeler?"", ie. focuses on the how instead of trying to say someone is one or the other.   There's two places that consistently make good functions-centric typology content with the 4 function stack model in mind and without much pollution from other systems. Michael Pierce's Youtube channel and the CelebrityTypes website.  For starting out, this playlist by Michael Pierce is probably the best introduction to typology on the 'net - it's certainly what made a sea of impossible jargon click for me the first time:  Lessons on functions-based typology by Michael Pierce  Celebritytypes has good comparison tables for the different functions - this is probably good to look at side by side with Pierce's introductory videos.  After the Lessons:  Pierce's portraits of the sixteen types in video  Pierce's portraits of the sixteen types as text  Another look at the functions by Pierce  CelebrityTypes' articles section is full of good stuff"

I love solving complex logical problems and I really enjoy trying to understand people from within their own perspective as well. I tend to be a perfectionist but I allow myself to ""be human"" too. Right now, I am working as a game designer and I would be very happy with this career as my final one. Other options I considered the most are psychiatrist, writer or scientist, probably in theoretical physics.  By the way, I plan to work mostly alone with someone to supply me with graphics and music, as those two areas are something I haven't invested enough time to master and I am fully aware those are hard things that need a lot of effort, practice and probably even a gifted person in the first place. Other than that, I enjoy planning the game, coding the game, crafting the story and thinking about how will others feel when playing it.  Think of Final Fantasy like game on a smaller scale.

Going by the functions - that is to say, looking at the ways that you tend to take in, evaluate and organize information - is typically far more fruitful, if also requiring a lot of honesty.  On IxFPs, INFPs don't need to be writers, ISFPs need to be performing artists, they certainly don't need to be ""daydreamy"" - both Fi-dominant types are primarily and simply people who have a need to do what they find authentic and meaningful. If it allows them to express themselves somehow, all the better. But the world is full of things like that, art and writing are just a tiny sliver of the possibilities. Some find their calling in writing, some in the sword, and others in who knows what. When talking about Fi-doms, the best rule about interest choice is that there are none."
mbti,39h0ix,Komatik,3,Thu Jun 11 19:01:46 2015 UTC,"k. no true INTP would describe themselves as 'very emotional.' very occasional emotional outbursts after repressing /ignoring primitive Fe for awhile? sure. but INTPs describe themselves as emotionally neutral 99% of the time, even well-developed ones, for the most part. when you have a dom-Ti brain, there isn't all this focus on emotions and being inside emotions a lot of the time. emotionally aware after more development? sure. but not 'very emotional.'   this alone should let you know that you aren't one. also the fact that you want to creat a video game with a 'fair bit of emotions' and you want it to impact people's lives... that's far more of an Fi thing.   you could very well be an INFP with the enneagram 5w4---a more logically-oriented kind of INFP. these people can often feel like hybrids."
mbti,39h0ix,toyouitsjustwords,7,Thu Jun 11 21:03:13 2015 UTC,no true INTP would describe themselves as 'very emotional.'   Most will probably shudder at the very idea.
mbti,39h0ix,CritSrc,2,Thu Jun 11 21:26:19 2015 UTC,Yeah sounds like INFP. INFP portraits tend to emphasize their emotion while leaving out the intellectual side. I think that may be one reason you're stuck between types.
mbti,39h0ix,bezald,2,Thu Jun 11 18:48:44 2015 UTC,"But that's the thing - I emphasize both sides pretty much the same. I believe I really balance between emotions and logic rather well. Is INFP supposed to spend hours optimizing his code to create the most effective algorithm? Sometimes, I even apply coder's approach to handling other people or myself, think about animals' behaviour as AI routines and such. Also, following Bezald's comment, I took a cognitive function test and my result was INTP, other similar test resulted in INFJ.  By the way, I ask this more out of curiousity. I wondered why doesn't this system allow hybrids since there must be more people like me who would fit such a category rather than a single type."
mbti,39h0ix,dante76,3,Thu Jun 11 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"Is INFP supposed to spend hours optimizing his code to create the most effective algorithm?    Well yes, it is your work after all. I would do it to look good in front of the others while noting the jumps I can make next time. I don't particularly care for it, I just want a clean equation showing my understanding for my own convenience.

mbti,39eu0m,mistalsa,12,Thu Jun 11 06:39:52 2015 UTC,"At least for introverts, we're comfortable living inside of our own heads. So sometimes it happens that we skip the auxiliary, extroverted process that's interested in the outside world and start using the dominant and the tertiary function solely, which is dangerous because it lessens our connection to the outside world and because our minds need ""food"" for the two primary functions especially. In not feeding the auxiliary, you're essentially practicing severe mental malnutrition.  Another reason it is dangerous is because it is initially comfortable, and you easily get stuck in a rut where it's hard to get out.  Every (introverted, at least) type is prone to a dom-tert loop. What the loop looks like depends on the type - an INTP could get stuck with Ti-Si, treading and refining old ground again and again, entrenching themselves in a certain mindset, when a good part of their needs is Ne, which yearns for the new more than probably any other function.  Don't know if extroverted types suffer from it, but it's not hard to imagine forgetting to pay any attention to yourself and just get ""lost"" in the world - an ENTJ (Te-Ni-Se-Fi) skipping Ni for Te-Se just doing doing doing doing without stopping to think, and so on."
mbti,39eu0m,Komatik,6,Thu Jun 11 08:05:19 2015 UTC,"Extroverts in a comparable fashion.  Extroverted dom-tert loop leads to inquisitive, controlling and relentless behaviors.  Ex : ENTP's Ne-Fe loop is linked to Narcisistic personality disorder.  Fe don't do it's job to keep Ne dom from being alienating because of it's inquisitive nature. In fact it begins to fuel it.  Whereas introverts tend to be avoidant, depressed or simply overwhelmed by their thoughts.  Dom aux function in loops too but is balanced."
mbti,39eu0m,ScalSaver,5,Thu Jun 11 10:18:02 2015 UTC,"I need to comment on this because the loop is really unverified theory mostly spread as a thing in online typology communities meant to explain certain mental illnesses and neuroses. However, this goes contrary to Jung's original teachings where the common interpretation of the auxiliary is that it should take the same orientation of the dominant, so if the dominant is introverted so is the auxiliary. According to this interpretation, the favored development for an introvert should be XiXiXiXe.  Mental health problems only occur when one is too entrenched with the dominant and it is the auxiliary that actually brings a more realistic grounding outside of the perspective of the dominant.   Furthermore, I also think that the idea that it's bad being too introverted or extroverted belies a fundamental misunderstanding of what introversion and extroversion actually means. Being introverted doesn't per se mean living in your head as much as it means that you prefer subjective understanding over objective in the philosophical sense. It's very different from the idea of living in one's head.   I'm an INTJ who is very NiFi, but I have never run into the kinds of problems stated to exist for this supposed loop.  Furthermore, the creator of the theory is DaveSuperPowers afaik, and it's his own unverified idea.   Edit  The creator is SimulatedWorld, not that it matters. This is not actually a thing and actually goes contrary to Jung's teachings and how cognition really works."
mbti,39eu0m,Entr0pic08,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:11:05 2015 UTC,"According to this interpretation, the favored development for an introvert should be XiXiXiXe.   Interesting. So why is it that the normal model uses Xi Xe Xi Xe or vice versa?"
mbti,39eu0m,Entr0pic08,-1,Thu Jun 11 20:39:15 2015 UTC,"Not sure outside that this is how Myers interpreted the differentiation of the function order based on what Jung wrote. For what it's worth, so did Augusta. The point, regardless of that, is that Jung thought it is the auxiliary that brings realism to the dominant perspective and this is because it helps to navigate by providing additional input either because it creates structure so a person isn't entirely focused on perception or allowing the individual be caught up in logical structure only and consider new forms of data.   I am also of the idea that the auxiliary should be extroverted and I also don't think there's something bad preferring all introverted functions because all that means is that one is primarily oriented and considers one's own perception and judgements over what objectively exists, and that doesn't necessarily impinge on an individual's ability to operate in society or function as a healthy individual.   It should be noted that being a cognitive type is actually a neurosis itself because it suggests an over-reliance on certain perspectives at the expense of others which can develop into unhealthy and reality-removed perception like the Ni dom woman not being aware that she's living in a brothel. So being introverted or extroverted isn't the problem, or being in a loop isn't a problem either, but it is a problem being a type at all and by that I mean a pure type of the kind he writes about in Psychological Types. Jung used the function theory solely as a backdrop to explain why his patients suffered from different neuroses."

T/F is just shorthand for the underlying cognitive functions.  for instance, the cognitive functions for INTP: Ti Ne Si Fe                                                     . for INFP: Fi Ne Si Te  you'll wanna research the cognitive functions to figure out your type.  any type is capable of introspection and philosophizing but i imagine most types like INTJs/INTPs would never used the term 'definite truth.' i'd bet that you're INFP: artistic gratification, 'love and empathy,' analogy of a fish in the sea... i get that vibe.  you can see if this resonates: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BpPVeP6FUI  and don't make the mistake of thinking that INFPs don't use logic. we/they absolutely do and INFPs differ a lot in what we value. there are a lot of INFPs with degrees in comp sci and whatnot, so don't think it's exclusively an INTX domain."
mbti,39gga3,Komatik,3,Thu Jun 11 16:15:03 2015 UTC,"A big difference between INTP and an Fi type's thinking (and it definitely is thinking, not solely ""muh feels"" type stuff - the latter happens, but moreso when a handful of really really important things are at stake) is that an Fi type's thinking is more partial, invested, and more readily evaluates a thing as good or bad. A Ti type would want criteria of desirability first, I find."

mbti,39gga3,aint_it_strange,3,Thu Jun 11 19:26:01 2015 UTC,"From what I learned recently here, it's more important to decide first whether you're Fe or Fi, and whether you're Te or Ti.  The same goes for Ne/Ni and Se/Si.  Once you know this, it's a lot easier to apply which order your functions go in :)    u/Komatik told me:   The stack order isn't a raw ranking of strength, but if you think your Te and Fi are strong, for example, that'd indicate ENFP (Ne Fi Te Si) or ISTJ (Si Te Fi Ne). It's important to note that how outgoing you are etc. has little to do with what your dominant function is.  Also, the dominant is what you do compulsively, so you typically just don't think of them a lot. Even Ti dominant people - a function that's pretty plain to see usually - don't often realize that not all people's brains work like that. You're all too often blind to your dominant function until you get to contrast yourself to others. If I had to put it somehow:  Dominant: What you compulsively do, often to the point you're unaware of it. Easily capable of nuanced handling of things. Auxiliary: What you habitually do, strength you're more conscious of. Capable of nuanced handling of things. Tertiary: Usable tool, often unconscious until brought up. Can be strong, but isn't as capable of nuance as the primary functions - this can result in it just being off in its conclusions, or having a naive quality to it. Inferior: Unconscious, ideal to strive for, point of weakness. Prone to related addict-like behavior. Conclusions drawn from the inferior tend to be starkly black and white.  These are just guidelines, though: When learning something it's best to take the attitude that you don't know how much you don't know to keep yourself away from Dunning-Kruger[1] . That and stark honesty with yourself will take you far."
mbti,39gga3,kalg,2,Thu Jun 11 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"Sometimes when you're stuck, one of these can be quite obvious and make the rest of the process easier.  I've actually had the argument of ""do what makes the group most comfortable"" vs ""do what makes me most comfortable"" repeatedly with another person. Realizing this is a key difference between Fe and Fi explained why neither one of us was impressed with the other's reasoning and also made it crystal clear which functions we use. I, as an INTP, was obviously calling on Fe. I've now changed my approach in these situations, since I have a clear understanding of why the old way wasn't working.  I do decently, I think, at recognizing Te b/c it drives me crazy!, though not Ti. And Se/Si is such a glaring difference to me if I can see any evidence either way."

I know a site or two that just gives a pretty black and white picture of each function, and it was really helpful to be able to go ""Ne sounds more like me than Ni"", rather than going ""well, I think I'm a feeling type, but I'm actually very good at academics and I like proof and statistics, so maybe I'm a thinking type"".    I guess different strokes for different folks, but I personally love looking at the functions, considering it seems to mater more how the letters play off one another :)"
mbti,39gga3,bezald,2,Thu Jun 11 17:21:55 2015 UTC,"It does resonate with me. Actually I am familiar with the functions, so feel free describing my behavior using that terminology.  With definite truth, I mean irrefutable truth. Like 2+2=4 when everything is defined within a closed system. I am attracted to that kind of truth. I find it soothing, because there is no wiggle-room. So T-types wouldn't mention that? They wouldn't call it definite truth? Just truth perhaps?  INFP is definitely a type I consider so it is nice to hear that I get some outside confirmation."
mbti,39gga3,bezald,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:53:50 2015 UTC,"well, idk. i don't know if they would describe it as 'definite truth' exactly. seems like you're just interested in sciences and whatnot, which isn't really exclusive to any type.  INFPs in the sciences often can get really confused about their type because there's a stereotype that only NTs are interested in these disciplines.  are you an organized person? are you kinda spacey and daydreamy? do you need plans to be set in advance or do you like to go with the flow more?"

Well, I don't think about my immediate environment, so in that sense I am more in the clouds. I guess all ""intuitive's"" do this. But what are my daydreams about? It varies, but I don't imagine made-up characters that I hear INFPs do.  I might think, what if I showed this totally crazed-out music to Mozart. How would he react? Or, how can I find the optimal situation for a certain scenario. I tend to come up with better versions each time, version 2 is better than version 1.

I wonder how many of these also think that sensors are dumb or view all feelers as completely irrational and incapable of using logic, especially those INFPs.  The great thing about this kind of thinking is that for anyone who doesn't fit the stereotype, one can simply conclude that they must actually be a different type altogether.

If twitch can successfully play Pokemon, the random actions of a fish could theoretically allow for the successful actions of a sports team. And with only one entity chaotically making the tough decisions to be implemented, things would be far more organized.  Given that a pro-sports team is already well trained in the sport, they can likely be trusted to override any awful suggestions by the fish. This actually fosters a degree of independent thought in the players, increasing their self-confidence and ability to function only on the level of players and not entirely rely on the coach. Still, the fishcoach is there to provide a guideline if they ever need it.  Additionally, sports teams have enough money and publicity to keep trying to play if it goes poorly. At the very least, it will attract the public, an oddity with the potential and a high likelihood of going viral. ""Come see the team coached by a fish"" they would say. Tourism, merchandising, an increase in dedicated fans would all yield a substantial monetary gain for the team. In this sense the fish doubles as a mascot. Being a fish, it does not require any pay check, only needs minimal maintenance, and would never lose its public image, a problem many suddenly empowered individuals face. Corruption will never befall fishcoach.  At this point, fishcoach has demonstrated coaching potential with added benefits above, but possibly achievable by a human coach. Now this is where fishcoach demonstrates its clear dominance. The ability to ""fly"", or jump really high out of the water. A spectacle for the audience to see. Being a fish, it or any other actions of the fish are not reasonably accused of breaking any rules. It's just the fish's nature. This means, without any opposition, the fish is allowed to instruct a team with gestures in a large, three-dimensional space. Sure, a coach could hold up a few fingers or whatever, up high, or down by his waist, for different basic tips and instructions. But can his ability to gesture and instruct is limited to about an arm's height above his head. Fishcoach can do so much more, with far more freedom of mobility. Based on the fish's location, different instructions would be implied. Multiple sets of rules could be written and kept among the team. And this means more possibilities to help out the team in their most stressful moments. More plays to run. The team would be far more unpredictable, and far more challenging to figure out and overcome than any other.  It DOES make perfect sense that flying fish can obviously be better coaches of pro sports teams. Fishcoach. Hell yeah."

Flying fish have to know a thing or two about group coordination and teamwork to function effectively.  It's probably the thing they do best.

Fish of this family are known as flying fish. About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera. Flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defense mechanism to evade predators.  The oldest known fossil of a flying or gliding fish, Potanichthys xingyiensis, dates back to the Middle Triassic, 235–242 million years ago. However, this fossil is not related to modern flying fish, which evolved independently about 66 million years ago.

Like for the dead squirrel - you can be either mournful, because it received a lot of pain (just like any other living thing with a sufficiently developed nervous system), or you can be thankful, because now the creature is not subject to any more pain.  I sense a little imbalance between your functions. It seems you are over-relying on Fi, but what about the rest? Especially Ne and Si - do you consider the various causes and implications of any experience (Ne) and then compare it to those situations you have already experienced (Si), be it a dead squirrel, hitting someone with a car, or trees' feelings? Also, do you make any steps to avoid negative outcomes (Te)?  For example, about hitting a person with a car:  Do you always abide rules of driving (sorry, I don't know how it is called in english)? If you would hit someone, would you do the necessary steps to minimize the negative effects (calling 911, driving them to a hospital, etc..)? Would you know, what are the necessary steps? How many times did you hit someone so far? What are the chances? If you would hit someone, would you able to recognize whose fault was that? (If you abide all rules, then it is surely the other person.)  The above part included Si (recalling facts and similar experiences), Ne (hypothesizing different scenarios, brainstorming) and Te (taking the necessary steps to reach a goal, in this case ""not hitting anyone""). People of reddit: if I made a mistake, please, point it out. I wanna learn from them.  Also, keep in mind: you can't avoid bad things to happen. Sometimes shit just hits the fan. What you can do, however, is:   Balance out your functions Find somebody to talk to, who is able to comfort you, or point out why your worries are without any basis. (I think the first type (comforting) would work better.)     If ghosts can go through walls, they act just like neutrinos, or gravity fields.

They can be pretty mysterious. Some of the things he does and says seem kinda INFJ but I think he is INFP.  Have you studied the cognitive functions much? Usually if you are unsure of your type it can help to understand the inferior functions of the types you think you might be and see which you relate to most (if that made sense). Understanding inferior function is surely the most useful part of mbti for self improvement/etc. as well...  And I stopped watching bb the last few days but I remember thinking more recently that Harry does seem an introvert. Through all the show she puts on and front she tries to give off, she is a really awkward person. That's not the only reason that made me think introvert though. Btw, why do you think Nick likes Harry I don't understand their relationship/attraction?  Maybe ISTP for Harry then.

I just don't see an ISTP having the motivation to write as much as you did...lol  Also, in terms of cognitive functions, ISTPs use Ti Se Ni Fe, while INTJs use Ni Te Fi Se. I see plenty of Fi in your post, and almost no Fe. Especially here:   Things that bother most people don't bother me. People complain about the weather, or stubbing their toe, or that class was out an hour later and I'm indifferent towards it all. You really need to complain about the weather? Its going to change by tomorrow. You stubbed your toe really bad this morning and your still talking about it? Who cares that class was running late? When people complain about these mundane things I fake compassion and can have the conversation with them, but in my head is, ""who the hell cares""   See, I don't personally care about a lot of these things either, but Fe is my auxiliary (second) function, so I use it all the time. Fe is very outwardly concerned with group harmony, it feels what the group feels, and automatically empathizes with others. I can pretty easily put myself in other's shoes and understand why these things might matter to certain people. If a person told me they stubbed their toe, for instance, I immediately cringe, because I can easily imagine the pain they must have felt. So much so that I can almost feel it. That shit hurts, man!  Fi, on the other hand, is inwardly focused. A Fi user can easily identify their own feelings, and is very in touch with their personal value system. It may be able to sympathize with the feelings of others which it doesn't personally identify with, but it's not going to understand why the person feels that way, or feel what they feel (empathy).  Do you know about cognitive functions? Learning about them and figuring out which you identify with most may help you nail your type if you're still unconvinced :)"

Part of the reason I lean more towards INTJ is the way she explained how things that bother other people don't bother her. It's like, the notion of these things being issues for other people so foreign to her that she can't help but be somewhat critical of them. To me it came across in a bit of a ""why are you talking about this? That's not a problem. Don't be stupid"" tone, which is more typical of high-ranking Te than repressed Fe.  In my experience, IXTPs seem a bit more relaxed about things that bother other people not bothering them. They almost seem to find it cool that they're so in control of their emotional responses to things, so they're less likely to be annoyed/critical of others expressing emotional distress. They're generally capable of at least pretending to empathize, all the while thinking to themselves ""wow, I totally don't actually care about this thing that everyone else is going apeshit over.

I believe this to be indicative of Ne. However, you're very analytical in your prose. Curious, yet subjective, asking a lot of questions, ""why is it like this?"" ""it should be like this, right?"" etc. Indicative of strong Ti.  In your social interactions, it sounds like you have no issue dominating a conversation, which leads me to believe that although you may need some downtime, you're an extrovert at heart. Hence, why I'm going with ENTP instead of INTP.  ENTP's tiertery function is Fe, which because it's not as developed, can come across as unhealthy or attention-seeking. This also has to do with an individual's experiences. It sounds like you were picked on when you were younger, which is where your excessive need for admiration and success may come from. Hence, the narcissistic traits I'm picking up. These are things you could stand to work on, but I apologize if I was a bit too blunt in my initial response. Having narcissistic qualities doesn't actually make someone a narcissist, it just means they have self-esteem/identity issues (which we all do!)  I think it might help you further to read up on cognitive functions a little more, and see which you identify with most. The ones I'm detecting the most from your post are Fe, Ti and Ne.  ENTP's weakest function is Si. This means they aren't very ""detail oriented"" and struggle when it comes to tasks that require this skill. Does that sound like you?  Hope I've helped!"
mbti,39cx7w,SquirmGirl,3,Wed Jun 10 23:41:16 2015 UTC,"It's okay, the messaging is weird for me too.   it's more likely that you're ENTP   Okay wow, that's a big change from INFJ! But do you have any idea why I was so attracted to art and music when I was a teenager and then moved to science? I get so tired when I have to use thinking in school for classes like physics or calculus, but I can do music all day like it's nothing.   I really agree with all you said about Fe. It's the only function I can say, without doubt, that I possess and use regularly. I never thought that my rhetorical questions were Ti. That is kind of how I navigate in my head. I would say it is definitely more logical than what I find with Fi-users.    I'm going with ENTP instead of INTP   Thanks, I never related to INTPs that much.    ENTP's tiertery function is Fe, which because it's not as developed, can come across as unhealthy or attention-seeking.   Yeah, I can see that; but I am pretty damn good at reading the room, far better than ISFJs and ESFJs I know (not to mention Fi-users). Does that say anything?   reads a lot like a train of thought   It actually was me typing my thoughts up at work and I thought that maybe I should make some changes and make a post on Reddit. That's usually how I talk/write though. You're really good at reduction by the way.    sounds like you were picked on when you were younger   You nailed it... Home schooling until high school = socially awkward teenager -> constant embarrassment -> teasing -> depression. But now I'm all good. It's in the past, and I'm doing really well now except for a few problems, e.g., some narcissistic qualities, shyness, repressed memories, weird Fe, etc. Don't feel bad: being blunt isn't bad. It's just not something I hear everyday so I was like, ""Damn, she's right; that sucks."" I can only improve if I know, so thanks!   read up on cognitive functions a little more   I don't really understand the perception functions (N and S functions). I read about them sometimes but I hear the same things. They don't seem to help me in understanding myself. I hear all the general descriptions like, ""Ni is depth; Ne is breadth,"" ""Ni is convergent; Ne is divergent."" While I understand very well what the differences with these descriptors are, applying them to my thoughts and/or actions doesn't seem to yield any results.   Here's some weird things that have happened to me that might show Ni or Ne...  • The other day I was at work and I randomly got hungry. I thought, ""Wow, Chipotle sounds so good right now."" It's strange because I never go there. It's been about a year. Then I think, ""No, because I'll see Blah-blah-blah there with his sister."" Blah-blah-blah has been wanting me to talk to his sister. I haven't actually spoken to him in months :/ This was a completely random thought! There was nothing tying Chipotle to Blah-blah-blah or his sister. It was so random! I think to myself, ""Well, now I have to go get a burrito and see if I'm right--just for fun."" I go there and sure enough, he's there with his whole family. Super weird.  • About a year ago I was biking home from college and I had this random thought that someone at 7 Eleven wanted a hotdog. Wtf, right? That'd require me to take the long way home (which I never take). Out of curiosity, I biked in that direction. I was riding by it and there was a homeless lady outside the 7 Eleven, just sitting there. I sat there and we were looking at each other. I say, ""Are you hungry?"" She replies, ""I could really use a hotdog."" I was mind fucked. I got her a hotdog and was friends with her until I moved.   • I also tend to get random ideas about business ideas, products, etc. My mind will wander a bit and then I'll have to stop and think, ""Okay, is this even worth thinking about?""  • More examples exist... I'm hungry so my examples had to do with food. But I'm not lying to you, I promise.   ENTP's weakest function is Si. This means they aren't very ""detail oriented"" and struggle when it comes to tasks that require this skill. Does that sound like you?   I am bad with details and think they're mundane. That's just a not sensor answer, though, right? I can see I'm probably not a sensor but I have trouble differentiating Si and Se in my life...   Also, I don't know if you have the answer for this but I wouldn't say my thoughts are completely scattered but they are less orderly than my external world. I grew up with judgers so… is that why I act like one or am I actually one? Because I don't think I appear like I'm a perceiver; not to say I couldn't be one.   And you have helped a lot, thanks! I can rule out ones like INTJ and ENFP haha."
mbti,39cx7w,throwaway13472801,2,Thu Jun 11 00:27:15 2015 UTC,Your flashes of insight sound very Ni to me.  I think you're ENTJ.
mbti,39cx7w,throwaway13472801,2,Thu Jun 11 11:39:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but where is everyone getting the Te from? I've never identified with Te/Fi in reading about the functions."
mbti,39cx7w,Komatik,2,Thu Jun 11 12:14:47 2015 UTC,"A lot of times, it's easier to tell the dominant function by looking at the inferior.  The dominant function is such a core part of your personality that you probably don't think about it much, and may have even forgotten to talk about it. The inferior function is usually obvious to you, and serves as an area that you think needs improvement."
mbti,39cx7w,bezald,2,Thu Jun 11 12:21:42 2015 UTC,"Hmm.... improvement.....  The question is what function needs improvement. Obviously I need improvement in various areas of my life.   I've been sitting here, thinking for a while and I can't figure out which function represents areas where I need improving. Can I list stuff for you and maybe you can throw a function label on it?"
mbti,39cx7w,throwaway13472801,3,Thu Jun 11 12:43:50 2015 UTC,"The question isn't quite what function needs improvement. Just generally what persistent flaws or character quirks you have.   Can I list stuff for you and maybe you can throw a function label on it?   Absolutely, it's the best way, even. Needs brutal honesty, though."
mbti,39cx7w,throwaway13472801,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:54:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean for this to be so long but I just kind of talk so I apologize.  Quirks... so like weird things about me? Well, I think of quirk and I think about how girls always make note of my smirk that I make on a regular basis, that asymmetrical smile that I do. It's only when I'm laughing out loud that I smile with both sides of my mouth. It's really hard to think of anything, not because I think that I don't have them: it's more that I'm having trouble identifying them. (Several minutes later.) HA! I thought of some. Okay, well I'm not sure if this completely falls under ""quirks"" but it might be worth noting that I never know what to do with my hands. I seem to always be doing something with them. At my two jobs I'll always be messing around with my badges. I feel strange with my hands by my side: I usually cross my arms as to do something with them. Sometimes I'll use pockets but I think that sometimes doesn't display the image I'm trying to present. Sometimes I just copy what other people are doing because I'm always analyzing them. My fingers aren't calm either, haha, I struggle to not bite my nails or scrape them apart with other nails or my teeth. Is that just a perfectionist thing? I'm kind of a perfectionist... but I'm willing to sacrifice perfectionism in the present for perfectionism in the future. I also say weird shit to people. Like the other day, someone wanted Sweet-n-Low in their coffee and I was like, ""Wow, I hope you aren't Native American!"" They said, ""Umm... why?"" I answered, ""You know, because some Native Americans believed that they were descendants of their gods who looked like ants and lived in the ground. Sweet-n-Low is made with aspertane and is used in ant-killer so Sweet-n-Low could kill you if you were Native American."" It was so fun making that joking connection. I loved it. I was called weird again, but at least I made them laugh. That's all that matters: if people are happy, I'm happy, and vice versa. I sometimes say weird stuff like that to people so maybe that's a quirk. Sorry if this is irrelevant though.  Character flaws... okay, so that's hard because I don't see my flaws as consistent, at least from my perspective they aren't. Here's a list I came up with:  - So much of my life seems to be one extreme or the other, almost binary: drinking (drink every night or never), wealth (not care about money or work for Google, making a shit load), girls & marriage (date/marry the perfect woman or bang hot girls I'd never want to be seen with), meaning in life (leave my mark on the Earth or believe in a philosophy like existentialism where your life doesn't really mean anything). You probably get the picture haha.  - I hate being around babies because I don't know how to treat them. Do I treat them like stupid people, puppies, or like normal people? I just hate it; I end up going with ""normal people"" and then people complain that I'm bad with kids. Love cute animals though, I seriously melt. - I sometimes can't lose, especially if it's a power struggle. I end up going too far and being cut-throat and I'll be so pleased for about an hour and then I feel shitty inside. This is pretty rare though and only when I'm not doing well.  - I can't stand when people are inconsiderate. This is pretty common for me. I usually get angry at someone for being selfish. I hate that so much.   Now it's all verbose talking...  As you guys are well aware of, I'm very conscious of what others think of me. I think that's definitely a flaw. I have so many facades, it's very difficult to act myself because who the hell is that? I honestly don't know who I really am, how I really act. I know how I want to act in a given moment or situation but I'm just a projection of what I want to be, at all times. Caring what others think of me permiates my everyday life. The ability to be honest is very hard for me. I have floan under the Christian radar of my family for many years without them even becoming suspicious; but just for fun, I make sure I don't lie directly. Acting in real life is extremely rewarding and entertaining. I even work at a church now as a non-Christian, just to heighten the suspense and appease the family. Everything has been played out like the ending of a movie with a crazy twist (think The Sixth Sense) where you look back and see that all the events coincide with truth. Integrity doesn't mean much a lot of the time, especially if it hurts no one. I've kind of cheated on tests or quizzes in the past where I found the particular coursework to be irrelevant, seeing that it won't affect my ability to perform at my job. My grades are so-so: I really don't care as long as it doesn't affect my getting a job out of college. Despite that, I'm very good at everything I do. I can't stand being bad at real-life things that I value. If I decide I want to play a sport, I'll make sure I'm better than everyone I know. Same with most things. The difference lies in the event where I'm with friends and we're playing a game or something where the objective is to have fun. I'm not always competitive. I can turn it off pretty easily, and I don't like when people can't calm the fuck down and just have fun. Reading this through, it sounds like I'm really intense, but I'm really laid-back and not usually stressed. I know since some of you are saying I'm ENTJ, I promise I'm not a dick! I'm nicer and more conscentious of other's feelings than most T's and Fi-users I know. So I didn't list flaws all nice like you guys probably would have appreciated but I think the flaws are definitely interwolven into this paragraph. Oh, another character flaw is I despise people who act like ESTJs. I want them to burn. Just calm down and have fun. Stop making people do things you find important. Stop being bossy and just loosen up. Another flaw is that I will say harsh things that aren't intended as harsh (most of the time) and people will sometimes think it's offensive. Like I said to someone the other day that so-and-so needs to eat dick and die, and they laughed but with a lot of surprise. They couldn't believe I said that. They thought it was funny though, and since that was the intent, my deed was done. Sometimes around my mom I'll say offensive things and she'll get after me but she's too sensitive to worry about. People are usually surprised by my blunt comments that I use for humor. When people want the truth about my opinions, etc. you get this.... a super long paragraph with verbose garbage. Sorry, trying to keep on track here. I think that a possible flaw would be me repressing emotions in general. Years ago, I discovered I could literally feel other people's emotions. I almost felt like I could then fuck with them in my mind and I got interesting results. I know, I know: there aren't any facts or evidence on any of this so I might as well shut up--but we're talking about MY flaws, so there's a good one for ya! Basically I learned to repress those readings because they just messed with my head. I got tired of constantly doing things to make other people happy. It was a never-ending task; now days, I help but I don't go to extremes for helping others. I didn't like screwing with my feelings either as I was really depressed as a teenager for normal teenager-like reason. Oh, here's another juicy character flaw I don't tell anyone besides all these secrets.... when I was a teenager, part of my depression was due to the fact that I always felt like there were unseen entities around me, especially in my room. I didn't know if they were demons, ghosts, spirits, hyper-dimensional aliens (LOL but seriously), or what. But I knew they were there. I could feel the space they occupied and they would move from time to time. They were all different in their own ways like they had character, and my fear of them made me sleep about 3-5 hours a night for most of high school. It really fucked with me. All this stuff--feeling things around me--literally feeling the emotions of others, etc. has been long repressed and now I just use those traits as a tool to get what I want in life. Once in a while, I'll get the feeling something is around me in the house and I'll repress it and go do something to get my mind off it. I hope that's helpful.   There's the hallway leading to my hidden room I talked about. Have fun... no one else ever knew this hallway existed. But there's your honesty."
mbti,39cx7w,Komatik,2,Thu Jun 11 16:46:53 2015 UTC,"wow, this description is so different from your OP haha. you definitely seem way more ENTP here.  can you compare these descriptions and see which resonates more? remember, there's no right answer. it's not better to be one or the other  http://www.personalitypage.com/ENTJ.html  http://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality"

I also saw a video by this guy Michael Pierce. That plus what you said makes me think I'm definitely an Ni user.   Maybe you could help me with the judging functions then because I'm hearing Ti and Te. Personally, I haven't ever identified with Te/Fi unless I'm under stress. I've had some jobs where I was under constant stress and anxiety. I started acting like a total NTJ and was extremely cut-throat, but even more patient than anything. Apart from that bad experience, I'm pretty relaxed and friendly so I'm not sure what that means..."
mbti,39a6q9,twigstix,6,Wed Jun 10 10:43:07 2015 UTC,So do you think that personality is largely genetic? And so conforms to natural selection?
mbti,39a6q9,MinatoCauthon,2,Wed Jun 10 12:32:41 2015 UTC,separated twin studies have shown that genes seem to have more of a say on personality than a persons upbringing.  Not accounting for life altering traumatic experiences and stuff of course.

There seems to be somewhat limited hard, quantifiable data on the subject.    But I would imagine artifically creating the conditions for an experiment to evaluate the similarities between twins separated at birth would be a bit unethical, or at least hard to come by naturally.    But what limited data there is seems to support the fact that twins separated at birth and raised in entirely different environments still ended up developing a lot of the same tastes, habits, interests, and other personality traits.  Maybe not conclusive data but still pretty interesting."

The forums will have a higher amount of introverted intuitives because those types are just more likely to be interested in MBTI and to be found on the internet. But if you were to take a survey of the entire country's population, our subset would be very rare."
mbti,39a6q9,floodimoo123,3,Wed Jun 10 11:22:34 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with society.  Si users tend to make their decisions off of what they know from their past or what they have been taught, while Ni and Ne users tend to do the opposite. Since every society has rules for how you should behave, Si users are more likely to internalize that and enforce it on themselves. This trait made people from the more ""strict"" societies of the past more desirable as a life partner, since they were less likely to rebel against the rules, and therefore made them more likely to have kids and pass on the gene.  Also, on another note, I just want to say that as an INFJ, I can tell very easily if I'm going to get sick or not a day or two before I get sick. I think it comes from experience since I was sick like two or three times a month growing up."

I generally know I'm going to get sick within 24 hours if I wake up with a sore throat, no matter how mild, but that comes entirely from experience.

mbti,39a6q9,santasmic,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:00:12 2015 UTC,"Trying to reach back to my college years to remember my ecology training. Forgive me if I recall incorrectly.  I think of it like this: http://www.ecologydictionary.org/NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION  The more prevalent types, whatever they are (e.g.  ISFJ, ESFJ, and ISTJ) are able to adapt pretty well to almost any situation in society, so they flourish.  However there are some ""ecological"" niches where the ""common"" types can't flourish. For whatever reason, they can't take advantage of specific environmental resources.   This is where the weirdos (INFJs, INTJs, ENTJs) come in-- they are able to capitalize on the leftover resources. But the leftovers are scarce, there are not enough of them to sustain a very large weirdo population.  Of course I don't really mean ""resources"" in the common sense of the word. I don't mean food or water. More like .... societal opportunities.  Our society needs a LOT of people to run the day to day stuff.... hence lots of ""opportunities"" for ISTJs and the like to be successful.  However we do not need a lot of visionary weirdos. If everyone was a visionary, nothing would actually get done. We do need SOME of these people though.  This sounds like intuitive-bias bullshit.

XD  I would say this is Ni, but perhaps in the sense that it's appreciating/admiring Se in all it's boldness? From the way you describe it, this sounds like something an INXJ would do. This is exactly why I, personally, could appreciate what is otherwise considered a ""bad"" movie by the vast majority.  I think all types can appreciate something for ""what it is"" despite popular opinion, but for different reasons. Ie: an IXFP might appreciate a bad movie because of how uniquely bad it is."

mbti,39890k,cyronius,2,Wed Jun 10 00:40:54 2015 UTC,"I would either guess ESTJ, ENTJ, or maybe ESTP.  How does she argue? Does she think more big picture or is she more down to earth? Does she have grand plans or does she do things efficiently as they come?"
mbti,39890k,santasmic,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:02:17 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, I wouldn't have even thought of ESTP. Those all seem like good guesses. I have a hard time typing her because on one hand, she is so focused and in tune with her environment, and so unsentimental, that I might see her as a sensor.   On the other hand, I'm an INTP and although we're really different she can ""speak my language."" She doesn't care for philosophy, but she does understand it. She's interested in talking about evolutionary biology or thought experiments for say five minutes, or going to a museum (learning + moving constantly). She has implemented big picture items like her degree later in life, and got a 4.0 in school.   When it comes to arguing... she just doesn't argue. She pulls the ""we're just going to do things my way. Ok? Ok"" and everyone goes along with it. She actually doesn't like confrontation because she's very affected by how others see her deep down. Even though she's unemotional, she's mostly interested in social engineering. She does take things as they come. They way she composes music is making it up as she goes and not writing anything down, usually. I'm really not sure."
mbti,39890k,santasmic,3,Wed Jun 10 00:34:15 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing about MBTI is that you can attribute one action to multiple types, all for different reasons. An INFJ is a dreamer, an INFP is also a dreamer, an ENTJ is a dreamer... they're just dreaming of different things because ""dreamer"" is a broad term.   The one thing that made me think ESTP was the part about constantly needing attention - that's a very ESTP trait. I was also trying to explore additional possibilities in case you had bias in wanting to be right thinking she is a ExxJ because the way you worded things made ENTJ a natural choice ;).   Anyway, my best guess is ENTJ. Everything fits, pretty much, besides the avoiding confrontation part. But it's not like types are cookie-cutter. I can see an ENTJ not wanting to argue because she thoroughly believes her way of doing things is correct and it would be a waste of time to discuss it, but in my experience, the ENTJ loves to talk about why their way of doing things is so much better than yours. However, you did mention she'd tell people why religion is meaningless, which definitely fits that trope.   Do you know about the functions aspect of MBTI? Start here (I just googled 8 functions, this looked good). The functions of an ENTJ are Te>Ni>Se>Fi.  I would read on the functions and see if they fit her. What's more revealing is a type's downfalls - read about suppressed Fi and other downfalls of an ENTJ and see if those sound familiar.   Typing other people is especially annoying and difficult, and it takes a long time to read and understand all the material necessary for it. My best guess is ENTJ but I could be absolutely wrong and wouldn't be surprised if I am. Best of luck!  Edit: Oh, and ESTJ is definitely a high possibility. I'm not 100% on all the differences between the two, it's for you to decide. Read on Si (not Se, my bad) and read on Te, decide which she uses more. Si means ESTJ, Te means ENTJ."
mbti,39890k,BadgerKid96,3,Wed Jun 10 00:52:39 2015 UTC,"ESTJ's don't use Se, while ENTJ's use both Se and Te. I don't see any Si usage here in the mother (unsentimental), so I think she's ENTJ."

mbti,396tz2,sifir,5,Tue Jun 9 23:31:52 2015 UTC,"I've given the test to over a dozen people. All of them had correct results (even matching their functions).  Even if its not the most accurate MBTI test,its hands down the best one on the internet.  Regarding your type....alright,if the test gave you an INTP and you think you're an ENTJ. Then you're probably not an ENTJ.  They are two completely different types,with completely different functions. Usually the ""traits and qualities"" are just stereotypes,so just because you're ""efficient and organised"" doesn't automatically mean you might be an ENTJ."
mbti,396tz2,Orikon32,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:41:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know the traits are stereotypes sometimes, but I feel like ENTJ describes my personality a lot better than INTP, I think being a ambivert throws the results off because the test labels you as a introvert or extrovert with no option for being in between."
mbti,396tz2,Orikon32,3,Tue Jun 9 19:24:48 2015 UTC,"Technically there's no such thing as an ""ambivert"". Yes,you could be in between,but that only means that your extroverted/introverted aux. function is very well developed.  Have you tried looking at the functions?"
mbti,396tz2,camelConsulting,2,Tue Jun 9 20:27:11 2015 UTC,"Function Stacks    ENTJ INTP    Te Ti   Ni Ne   Se Si   Fi Fe    As you can see, ENTJs and INTPs are opposites in terms of function stacks. 16personalities is easily the most accurate test on the internet, and it's unlikely it typed you wrong.  It may be that you are correct and are actually an ENTJ. However, it is also possible that you just identify with an ENTJ because it seems to be how you act contextually or would like to be perceived. When I was originally typed ENTJ, I went into denial and declared myself an ENFP, which was how I liked to portray myself. It finally took a strong friend showing me the function stack and asserting that I was actually an ENTJ to make me see the truth.  So long story short, study the functions and study the INTP in depth and try to think of yourself in a pure, non-contextual state. Don't think of specific instances of where you might be an ENTJ or not be an INTP, think instead of overall patterns in how you think.  Best of luck, hope you find your type! It's a great way to improve yourself and make interactions with others better!"
mbti,396tz2,SquirmGirl,2,Tue Jun 9 21:32:24 2015 UTC,"/u/camelConsulting /u/Orikon32  I did take a look at the functions and now I'm 95% sure I took the test wrong or misunderstood some of the questions. After looking up a bunch of stuff, I think I'm Te instead of Ti. Ne vs Ni is closer, but judging by my creative process(I'm a writer), Ni resembles me closer.  For Se vs Si it's obvious to me that I'm more Se, but I have some traits from Si also because I do have a good memory and sometimes compare things to past experiences.  I took another test too that said I'm ENTJ, and now I think I just took the 16 personalities test wrong."
mbti,396tz2,santasmic,2,Tue Jun 9 22:22:13 2015 UTC,"Like others are saying, I too believe that the 16 Personalities test is the best one you can find on the internet. However, it's still an internet test. It's not administered by a professional, and it types you according to letter preference rather than by cognitive functions, so no, it's not always going to be accurate, and there is definitely a good chance that you are not the type it gave you.  In my opinion, it's better to understand and identify your cognitive functions, first. There are many reasons why people may not test accurately, mainly being that not everyone knows themselves as well as they might like. Personally, I have struggled with identity issues for most of my life. When I was first getting into MBTI, I tested either INFP or ENFP for over a year because during that time, the stereotypes of these two types seem to fit better than my true type of INFJ. Once I investigated the cognitive functions and how they work, I pretty quickly realized that I use Ni and Fe, primarily, and that I hardly use Ne at all. Logically, this would make me an ENFJ or INFJ. I have always been very introverted by nature, so I must be an INFJ.  And you know what? I'm still not a very typical INFJ! I've had to suppress my Fe for years due to chronic mistreatment from others, so I don't often come off as warm and inviting when you first meet me. In fact, I've been accused of being cold and aloof on many occasions. There are many reasons why a person may not act like their stereotype, and that's okay. However, this is why I believe it's more important for people to focus on functions rather than testing by letter preference. The less an individual understands themselves, and the less they fall under the stereotype of their true type, the more likely they are to get inaccurate results.  The author this blog does a pretty good job at identifying cognitive functions in fictional characters, and a good job at explaining how they work overall :)"

mbti,3953oo,Ennpitsu,3,Tue Jun 9 09:09:24 2015 UTC,"Why is Introverted Intuition the only function that works subconciously?   It is not. It is peculiar in that most of the processing work happens unconsciously and mostly the results get brought to consciousness (vs. the highly conscious Thinking functions for example, that can damn well tell you why and how they got where they are), but all perceiving functions have a good deal of unconscious functioning to them. Feeling, likewise. I usually say that Ni is the most unconscious because of this, but it certainly isn't the only one.   Take Ne. It stops the process earlier than Ni and pops a lot of stuff into the mind without paring them down but I'll be damned if I can explain how they make half the connections they do. But the hops are shorter, so the overall path is easier to trace.  Try to explain why something feels Fi-right. At some point, you'll hit a brick wall of ""but it just is like that"" that's harder to get through than untangling any Ni vision of a thing could ever be.  Se's kinesthetic and Fe's social intelligence and awareness are pretty intuitive and ""going with the vibe"" type as well.  Very few things in typology are the exclusive domain of a function or type - it's usually a matter of degree, style and direction more than anything else.   And how does it work as a dominant function when an INxJ can't really use it deliberately?   It works by being a compulsive operation, being ""on"" all the time, which means it gets a crapton of practice and spits out accurate enough stuff, as well as typically being able to handle more nuance and scope than ie. ISxP's Ni can. It's still your brain doing the work, you just don't see it as much, and practice makes perfect.  Same thing as practicing math a lot and you just start doing harder stuff with less and less concentration because you get good at it."
mbti,3953oo,Komatik,6,Tue Jun 9 10:42:14 2015 UTC,"What makes you say it's the only one? I'm pretty sure all introverted functions work subconsciously in at least 70% of their design... people are consciously aware of some parts of Ni just like they are with Si. If you're going to say they function subconsciously then you are at least aware of them coming through another judging/extraverted function and into conscious thought in some form.  I fucking love the smell of ozone- Like after it rains on asphalt after a hot as fuck day? Love it. Do I know why? No fricking idea. But I smell it on a walk and god damn does it put me in a good mood. Must it remind me of something from sometime somewhere? Sure. No clue what though.  Not so with other things. I can smell a woman's perfume and at first have a subconscious 'oh, that's familiar...' and nearly immediately go 'that was grandma's perfume'.   There are many times when Ni-doms that I know don't know how they know what they know (lol) but when asked they can certainly pull some (usually Se-related) reasoning as to why out of their butt. I imagine that's the same thing."
mbti,3953oo,owlcandle,3,Tue Jun 9 10:10:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah!  I find myself coming to conclusions a lot, and when asked why or wondering why, then I think about it and pick out all the supporting details.

Also, as I think about my reasoning after having a  thought basically every time, I'm pretty good about catching the flaws in my intuition and dismissing wrong ideas.  (I think)."

Right now the BMW 7 Series can park itself without a driver even in the car. The Tesla will soon be able to drive itself without driver input for highway drives. Mercedes has a concept right now that is a preview of the far future that is autonomous, with only vestigial pedals and a wheel. Seeing this autonomous future is exciting for me as most people don't care about driving and see it as a means to an end. For a lot of people, cars are just transportation. Thus, the transition to autonomy will be welcomed-just imagine what you could devote your morning commute to productivity rather than poorly piloting a heavy metal missile at speeds unheard of by our ancestors. As a sports car enthusiast who loves his car, I will miss driving. I will miss the feelings and sounds of the car. I love my BMW E46 to death and many more enthusiasts feel the same about their sports cars. There is something to be said about the man-machine connection. I have driven a 65 Tesla on a corporate test drive event from one of their stores and it felt too damn sanitary. The steering isn't as involved as I like. I drove my old neighbors P85+ and loved the acceleration, but the steering still felt too disconnected even in the stiff setting.

If I had the choice, I would have gotten a newer Honda Accord, Civic or a Fit model. Instead, I'm driving 2007 Dodge Caliber and it gets me from A to B just fine, but god, I hate how slowly it accelerates and the visibility is absolute crap.  (for the record, I have no idea if/how my car preferences relate to my type. I mostly just wanted the excuse to bitch about my Caliber)"
mbti,394tuw,JellyDynomite,4,Tue Jun 9 07:06:14 2015 UTC,"Fi. Her awareness of gender as identity sounds a lot like how Te types learn to recognize Fi content, as Lenore Thomson describes:   Proposed definition #2 Introverted Feeling (Fi) is the attitude of judging things good or bad based on how they harmonize or clash with a living being's inner essence. That inner essence or soul, and how things in the environment get along with it or conflict with it, is knowable only first-hand--ultimately, only by that soul. It is known by attending to one's own emotions in response to things. What you like is good--for you, not necessarily good for others. What you don't like is bad--for you, not necessarily bad for others. Anything outside your own soul is irrelevant to evaluating anything or choosing your course in life.   Also, she seems dismissive of Ti. She at some point mentions how she feels that it feels like gender identities becomes something akin to a linguistic game, and she doesn't have any real interest in participating in that even though she could. Fi > Ti. Ti very much cares for such linguistic games. Most of the Ti types I've run into who dabble with gender approach gender from the prespective of definition, how do we define gender? Especially strong Ti tends tend to adhere to a logical principle e.g. gender is your biological sex so if you are born male, you are a man because these definitions are consistent with each other. She's not saying this at all.   Another thing that really points towards Fi here, but weak Fi, is stuff like where she says it would feel disingenuous to say that she's a woman. It wouldn't feel honest or truthful to how she really feels. It's not a proper factual representation of her inner feeling state.   Then there's the last but not least part that really points towards Fi, is that she is sharing not for the sake of eliciting emotions in us, but she is sharing to share a personal anecdote or story, a learning experience that we can use in order to improve ourselves. Fe doesn't work this way. Fe expresses emotions for the sake of expressing them. Take this video for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms2klX-puUU  The above video is Fi, because again, it's about recognizing the ""life forces"" or ""essences"" of other objects around us that Lenore points out, and how our individual needs clash each other, and it's about that when we learn to recognize this we can learn to respect others as well. We may never be able to understand, but we can learn to respect and there's a story to take from it, a moral of the story. Fe types don't tend to share stories for the sake of there being a ulterior morality. It shares for the sake of eliciting emotions (tears, laughter, smiles, what have you).   I don't see Fe at all, but I see Fi probably in a Te dom."
mbti,394tuw,Entr0pic08,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:20:12 2015 UTC,"Good analysis. I don't know if it's correct, but it sounds plausible."
mbti,394tuw,redearth,2,Tue Jun 9 13:42:18 2015 UTC,"I would say definitely Fi. You can tell right off the bat by how she is openly complaining and has deep feelings regarding the issue. She is passionate when she talks. Fi=more likely to express yourself, Fe=more likely to not express yourself. Fi, from what I understand, is assuming others feel the same way as you, not Fe.   Fi users are going to be much more opinionated sounding and controversial. Fe users, however, are better at ""holding back."" Fi users will be less likely to naturally know social norms, like that walking into a house with shoes on is probably rude. They figure since it's no big deal for them, it shouldn't bother the house owner either and so it doesn't even phase them to consider that as an option. They will naturally default to making what they think known, but Fe users will naturally default to being more diplomatic, polite, and considerate.   Fi users are supposedly better at being able to tell when someone is being fake or if they're generally a good or bad person (although I wonder about my judgements sometimes lol). They are also very empathetic. Fe will be able to outwardly comfort you better than Fi users, but they won't actually feel it inside as much."
mbti,394tuw,xoHighTech,2,Tue Jun 9 15:40:22 2015 UTC,Fi types are as understanding of what's rude and appropriate as Fe types are. This is a misconception in the MBTI that Fi types cannot understand social norms or codes of conduct.
mbti,394tuw,Entr0pic08,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:08:24 2015 UTC,Can you tell me how you would differentiate Fi and Fe?
mbti,394tuw,xoHighTech,2,Tue Jun 16 23:49:20 2015 UTC,"Fi=drawing ethical conclusions based on a subjective/personal idea of good/bad, right/wrong, like/dislike. Sees feelings as innate or intrinsic to the individual. Fe considers the feelings outside of the self, does not see feelings as a part of people but something that people contribute to via emotional expression. Draws ethical conclusions based on the overall feeling tone rather than a subjective one."
mbti,394tuw,Entr0pic08,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:25:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly one of the first things I gauge whenever I talk to someone is their level of sincerity. If they're being sincere, I'm gonna hear them out. However, if they're not and I can find evidence that they're lying, I'll be reluctant to trust them and probably disengage myself from them. It's somewhat of a defense mechanism to how naive I used to be with this sort of thing."
mbti,394tuw,BadgerKid96,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:06:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting! Kinda unrelated but since you have a very high Fi, can you explain how you ""just know"" when someone's not being genuine? Is it usually right or are you bad at first impressions? I know there are functions you have that I don't, but yah. :P"
mbti,394tuw,xoHighTech,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:59:09 2015 UTC,"Completely off topic but, you're an INTJ again? What made you change your mind?"
mbti,394tuw,ihqhevonen,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:03:59 2015 UTC,"Ha, don't worry about it. Multiple things. More things started clicking, basically. I'm still not 100%, but I'm narrowing it down. It's now down to ISFP or INTJ. Both share the same functions. I'm a perfectionist and score highly on turbulent, which has been skewing things I think. I've tested INTJ most of the time (including my first test which was done completely honestly) and never have gotten ISFP. After understanding the functions more and seeing them in context, I became more confident with which ones described me. After watching videos of an INTJ girl and an ISFP girl, I related a lot more to the INTJ (and others see me that way too). There are still some moments I don't fit in completely to the INTJ subreddit, but I think that's because of those skewing factors I mentioned. I've settled on a fairly well rounded turbulent INTJ."
mbti,394tuw,xoHighTech,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:13:05 2015 UTC,"I pay attention more to how someone says something, rather than what it is they actually say. You see, anyone can say anything, but the trick is to examine in what way they deliver their speech. I'm not really sure how to explain it quite well. I don't normally go off level of eye contact, as many people I talk to are pretty shy as it is and it's hard for them to maintain eye contact. It's actually the people who maintain eye contact for too long that make me feel weary, because it shows a really unsettling level of intensity and over confidence.   I also go by experience a lot too, as in if I've seen the same cues before in someone honest or someone disingenuous. I'll also look for discrepancies in facts, so let's say they keep changing their story, not just adding to it (which I end up doing because my mind has a lot of jumps and lapses so that's different), but completely going back over what they just said. It has to add up, it has to be consistent."
mbti,394tuw,BadgerKid96,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. I like the whole concept of ""actions speak louder than words."" Nice, looks like your Si greatly helps with noticing inconsistencies. Thanks for your insight!"
mbti,394tuw,xoHighTech,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:22:58 2015 UTC,"That's actually a lesson I learned very recently, due to my current boyfriend. In the past, most of my communication has been textual/over the internet so it was kind of detrimental to the whole actions part. I'm beginning to pick up on it, though. Especially after someone ended up lying to me for near 2 years. My boyfriend and I don't text too much, just for basic communication like when we will meet up, or when we're thinking of each other. It's a lot different than what I'm used to, but it's been really helpful."
mbti,394tuw,BadgerKid96,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:45:52 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, it's harder with text. Wow, 2 years? I have actually fallen into that trap too with some master manipulators. I could kinda sense that something was sketchy and they had tons of red flags in general, but I misinterpreted their actual motives because their execution was unflawed.   I'll give you a strategy that you can try using over text. What it usually takes for me to confidently decide someone's lying is when they say something that makes me say, ""this doesn't add up."" For example, if someone says something like, ""So and so is immature because they did this and this."" I will think, 'Hey wait a minute, I told you the other day that I do those things, so that means you actually think I'm immature after all.' They don't notice: thing they're insulting=thing I am.   This could also happen with comparing their actions; they could use (insert coping method here) very rarely and when asked about it, they say, ""Don't worry, I won't ever resort to ___ to calm down."" but then you notice they do a lot of other similar things to calm down and it's only a matter of time until they use ___ to calm down in the same manner.   Anyways, I hope my ramblings help lol."
mbti,394tuw,xoHighTech,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:54:36 2015 UTC,I think I already do all that stuff subconsciously. What's even better is when I have hardcore evidence that someone has/had been lying to me.
mbti,394tuw,BadgerKid96,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:01:26 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go with Fi here. It's basically her own take on the topic of stuff others believe in. Quite forward though, I'm not sure I'd be able to pull this off. I'm a bit soft spoken for that."

mbti,394bqr,TrantaLocked,4,Tue Jun 9 04:06:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I think I tend to come off as ISTJ too. But my Si isn't developed in the same way as a true ISTJ. It's more nostalgic and child like.
mbti,394bqr,BadgerKid96,3,Tue Jun 9 04:08:48 2015 UTC,"Some people think I'm an IxFP because I use Fi a lot and mistake the overall use with proficiency of use, though the people who think I am an Fi dom are also bad at Fi themselves, so they likely don't understand the difference in nuanced Fi use between tertiary and dom."
mbti,394bqr,Entr0pic08,2,Tue Jun 9 07:28:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get that a fair bit too. Last year, I discovered that a friend of a friend is a certified MBTI practitioner. I asked her what type she thought I was, and she pegged me for an STJ for sure... though to her credit, I think the official MBTI training discourages you from learning how to type people by observation because they want people to pay for the test.  I can do a good ISTJ impression when I'm trying to solve a problem that lends itself to Si/Te, or when I just feel like being meticulous or anal retentive. But I'm not as consistent in working toward my long-term goals as my ISTJ friends are."
mbti,394bqr,redearth,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:30:00 2015 UTC,"I probably do that a bit too.  Partially due to the fact that my roommate/best friend/ex is an ISTJ, and partially due to the fact of the kinds of jobs I've been applying for."
mbti,394bqr,iongantas,0,Tue Jun 9 08:15:58 2015 UTC,"That doesn't equal to Se, though, or what it means being an ESFP."
mbti,394bqr,Entr0pic08,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:50:25 2015 UTC,Did you type them like that because they act like that or did you arrive at that conclusion because it's a property they happened to share outside of their types?
mbti,394bqr,Entr0pic08,-2,Tue Jun 9 07:27:46 2015 UTC,Not really. Se as a cognitive function is about seeing and taking in the actual objective qualities of the object world exactly as it is. The traits you associate with the type are unrelated and any type can possess them.
mbti,394bqr,Entr0pic08,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:40:55 2015 UTC,"None of the ESFPs I know are interested in celebrity gossip or pop music. Maybe you're just shallow, but don't assume it's because of Se."
mbti,394bqr,Lakebreak,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:38:47 2015 UTC,"Most videos on /r/esfpmusic have been posted by a single user, you cannot make a generalization on ESFPs musical tastes out of that subreddit. I didn't make an assumption, you're the one who specifically mentioned pop music and associated it with Se."
mbti,394bqr,Lakebreak,2,Tue Jun 9 20:49:28 2015 UTC,"I think you're conflating Se and ESFPs with enneatype 7 characteristics. Se is basically taking information from your external environment in a raw form, with no interference. A lot of the things you mentioned as ESFPs traits can be seen in other ExxP types.  Notably these:    keeping up with the latest trends  I am always up for a good time - always want to have fun and laugh. I joke around a lot and sometimes people end up taking me seriously ><  anything thrilling, exciting, and new.  I am focused on having fun in the moment.   making sure everyone has a fun time   could apply to a lot of ENFPs. It's mostly the result of having a Pe dominant function and (often) being a type 7.  This:   I am into feeling a certain texture, color, etc. I am noticing the way things smell, feel, sound, and so on.   is more Se. Although I think strong Si users are also attuned to these things, but I'm not sure, I just don't understand Si :(  An additional note, my close ESFP friends would be very offended to be associated with the singers you mentioned. Not that they're into philosophy, but they have ""finer"" tastes (and are probably more intelligent too, but let's not go into this topic)."
mbti,393jt7,silverlinedeyes,5,Tue Jun 9 00:24:57 2015 UTC,"It's not uncommon. I'm INTJ and my brother is an INFP. We get along great. I wouldn't change anything about him. Actually, my ideal mate would be an INFP."
mbti,393jt7,TurtleSmile1,3,Tue Jun 9 03:58:10 2015 UTC,Honestly and I find INTJ attractive because they are deep thinkers and they balance my emotions in a mellow sort of way.
mbti,393jt7,bezald,7,Tue Jun 9 15:22:44 2015 UTC,"there are quite a few INFPs in relationships and friendships with INTJs. it's not uncommon from what i've seen. definitely search in the INFP sub for lots of threads on the pairing  we share thinking and feeling functions (fi and Te), so even if we seem outwardly very different we kinda share a foundation of understanding in how we process the world.  i have a good INTJ friend. she lives far away and we're kinda in our own worlds + don't talk much, but when we do it's always good and no pressure. we can totally be ourselves around eachother. she's a lot more blunt and harsh than me + i imagine it might be trickier in an intimate relationship but we're pretty close"
mbti,393jt7,Entr0pic08,3,Tue Jun 9 00:41:46 2015 UTC,"I feel like I can throw any topic at an INTJ and we can talk about it for hours. I love how thoughtful and chill they are. Like you said, there's no pressure. Just a stream of endless thoughts."
mbti,393jt7,sconsey_cider,4,Tue Jun 9 02:00:23 2015 UTC,"I think INTJ-INFP is a fairly common pairing, both romantically and platonically. The problem is that both types are introverted and may expect a bit more intiative from the other, so the relationship can easily run out in the sand in the long run, because no one is as willing to take action to make things happen."
mbti,393jt7,bezald,2,Tue Jun 9 06:34:10 2015 UTC,I definitely agree with the introversion thing. Both my sister and I tend to not reach out to people all the time not necessarily because we don't love them or need them. We just need to recharge and we don't need to be constantly babysat.
mbti,393jt7,sconsey_cider,2,Tue Jun 9 15:24:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't notice how many differences me (INTJ) and my ENFP brother had until I came across MBTI. We're really similar and balance each other out very well. Because of that, I didn't turn out a stereotypical INTJ and he's not a stereotypical ENFP.  We almost never fight, and when we do its the same thing. We get over it quickly or one of us says something funny and the other can't help but respond with a joke. Wouldn't trade him either."
mbti,393jt7,districtly,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:35:34 2015 UTC,"yeah, INTJ-ENFP is very complementary and it seems like 90% of married INTJs are with ENFPs or something... definitely more common than INFP-INTJ"
mbti,393jt7,SquirmGirl,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:06:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah them being extraverted definitely helps things along and brings me out of my shell. Would recommend.  It all depends on the specific person, but there was this one INFP I dated and she would get pretty annoying when she felt insulted. If I was busy and my texts came out blunt and emotionless, she would immediately copy me and start being dry in her messages. I saw things like that as her being petty and childish even though it was more of an emotional response. She was also always trying to prove herself as better than me, that was extremely annoying because I just wanted someone to relax with. Obviously I'm not generalizing on all INFPs, but those patterns of deep insecurity aren't a good match for me."

mbti,393jt7,bezald,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:13:23 2015 UTC,"Pairings in which both users have matching first and second letters, and opposing third and fourth letters, seem to be incredibly common for introverts. For instance, there's a ton of INFJs claiming to be in successful relationships with INTPs over on the INFJ sub (I'm in one myself). I also know of quite a few ISFJ-ISTP relationships IRL.   Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Either way, it's clear that these people are very compatible!  I think the main drawback in these relationships is that one of you inevitably is forced to be the ""dominant extrovert"" in certain situations. Ie: in social settings, initiating sex, etc. Also, it's very easy to get sick of each other, seeing as neither of you ever wants to leave the house :p  I'm not sure if it's the same for extroverts. Any ENTPs in relationships with ENFJs? ENFPs in relationships with ENTJs? Etc?"
mbti,393jt7,SquirmGirl,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:44:01 2015 UTC,"i think all types benefit from having a partner who shares the same thinking and feeling functions more than anything else. same goes for extroverts, i've found. one of a few exceptions to this would be INTJ-INFJ (which is very common) where dom-Ni is shared.   INTJ-ENFP is way more common than INFP-INTJ and generally seems easier and naturally, almost effortlessly complementary, from all the stuff people in those relationships have said... INTJs and ENFPs are both intuitive doms with the feeling and functions in the middle stack but flipped, which seems to create a kind of synchronicity and understanding. INFP-INTJ can work well, but there's more of a disconnect because INFPs are judging doms (dom-Fi) so we kind of live in a different world than INTJs... a world of feeling/values versus intuitive perceiving.  haha anyway, sorry for this rant, i just find MBTI compatibility super interesting because there definitely are strong trends."
mbti,393jt7,bezald,2,Wed Jun 10 20:52:17 2015 UTC,"i think all types benefit from having a partner who shares the same thinking and feeling functions more than anything else   I completely agree.   one exception to this would be INTJ-INFJ (which is very common) where dom-Ni is shared.

INTJ-ENFP is way more common than INFP-INTJ and generally seems easier and naturally, almost effortlessly complementary   Oh yes, I know all about Keirsey's theories on type compatibility, and although I don't disagree with it, I haven't actually experienced it for myself. That being, I've never been ""wooed"" by an ENTP. To be honest, I've only ever been acquainted with one ""known"" ENTP, and although we were certainly compatible in many ways, I wasn't romantically attracted to him. In fact, he had a tendency to exhaust me. There were many times I made up excuses in the middle of conversations to leave, because he just would not shut up.  I know there are likely ""better"" ENTPs out there for me, and I wouldn't disregard the possibility of dating one, but for now, I'm perfectly content in my relationship with my INTP :)"
mbti,393jt7,SquirmGirl,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:03:55 2015 UTC,"well i think it's a bit different with INFJ-INTP because INTPs are super geniuses at Ti and the INFJs i know always want to get better at Ti. INFJ-INTP seems ideal for INFJs who get easily exhausted by people (oh, and fwiw i feel like they're most common when INFJ is the female and INTP the male)... INFJ-ENTP doesn't seem quite as strong a trend as INTJ-ENFP from what i've observed, actually. i feel like i see most INFJs in happy relationships with INTJs or INTPs, then maybe ENTP and ENFP (which seems most fulfilling as a friendship, generally speaking... although there seems to be a bunch of INFJ male-ENFP female ones).  dom-Fi is kinda shat upon a little bit (and in practice maybe less helpful? valued in this world?) , so i think INTJs tend to not be as fascinated as INFPs as INFJs are with INTPs. this is just what i've observed in various MBTI communities and irl :)"

Fi-doms seem to do better in relationships with Fe-doms, who are not only more likely to be sensitive and appreciative of their unique value systems, but also good at getting them to open up and share their feelings. INFP-ENFJ seems extremely common around here. I know of two IRL examples of this as well. Also, my father and sister, both INFPs, are in relationships with ISFJs, and from what I can tell, they couldn't be happier :)  (Edit: Correction...sister's bf is much more likely an ENFJ)"
mbti,393jt7,bezald,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:15:18 2015 UTC,"interesting! yeah, i definitely think it comes down to enneagram with INFPs, in part.   all the INFP 4w5s (i am one; met about 12 in the following situation) i've come across in LTRs/marriages are with INTJ 5w6s, interestingly enough. we're both withdrawn misfits, INTJs understand Fi but aren't absorbed by it, and they can provide stability for volatile emotions. all that said, INTJs (who are all mainly 5w6s) are overwhelmingly more fascinated with ENFPs... guess i have to find one that can't deal with extroversion!  i haven't seen any INFP 4w5s in a successful LTR with ENFJs or ISFJs or anything. most ENFJs are enneagram 2s, and 2s and 4s tend to have a hard time with eachother in intimate relationships. 4s are so withdrawn, quirky and self-absorbed i think it's tricky to be with such a selfless type, as resentment builds.  i think INFP 9s, 6s and 5s (basically the rest of INFPs) are more versatile: i see them with ENTJs, ISTJs, ENFPs, ESTJs, ESFJs, ISFJs, ESFJs, ENFJs... depending on how cerebral they are and whatnot (5s and 6s tend to be with intuitives, i've noticed). i have also noticed that most INFP-ENFJ relationships seem to not work because there's such a divide in energy, and no shared functions make things difficult. it definitely happens though, and having functions in the same order can create synchronicity. there are a lot of fledgling INFP-ENFJ relationships, but they seem to not hold up super longterm  all enneagrams included, INFPs tend to end up with: XXTJs (INFP-ISTJ + INTJ is suuuper common), ENFP, ENFJ, just about in that order.  haha, just vomited all this INFP information you probably don't care about... i'm too interested in this stuff :)"
mbti,393jt7,bezald,2,Wed Jun 10 21:21:49 2015 UTC,No worries! I had fun reading about all this INFP information :) especially since I'm not well-versed in how enneagram works in conjunction with personality type.  I do know that my bf and I are both enneagram 5's. I'm definitely 5w4; not sure if he's 4 or 6. I've never known if that's a good/bad/unique thing in terms of our compatibility...lol
mbti,393jt7,SquirmGirl,2,Wed Jun 10 21:33:07 2015 UTC,and i think MBTI is kind of the umbrella for compatibility and then enneagram is just a bit more specific. INTP-INFJ seems to work well regardless of the enneagram :)

INFJs are much more varied in their enneatypes, apparently: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9  supposedly there are some enneagram 9 INTPs but those might just be one of the numerous INFP/INTP mistypes (since INFPs are commonly 9 or 4)"

mbti,395p6a,noyos,3,Tue Jun 9 13:06:39 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I don't know how much research you've done on the cognitive functions (links in the side bar) but I'm going to use them to try and type you. The 4 letters in MBTI represent a certain stack of ""functions"" that determine your type. So an INTP and an INTJ are one letter off but they have none of the functions the same so the types are very different. Anyway,   I'm usually quite social and I have many friends (but very few close friends), but I don't really need social interaction. Nor I feel drained by social interaction: it doesn't really affect me.   This makes me lean towards extravert.    I am by nature very practical and seek a practical approach in everything: I like exploring new ideas but I quickly abandon them if I can't put them into practice.   To me, this screams Te.    It is easy for me to get in sync physically with other people (for example, while dancing), but, as I wrote before, it's hard for me to get in sync with them emotionally   Se-Fi, not thinking you have any Fe.    and get harsh and impatient towards others when they are too slow or indecisive or they quarrel without reaching a conclusion. In fact, indecisiveness bothers me greatly because I seek to get things settled as soon as possible.   Hmmm also makes me think Te.   I'm leaning towards ExTJ but it's also possible you could be an ESTP, especially if you're on the younger side.   Okay, a few questions. How is your focus on details? Do you have a tendency to look for and memorize details or discard details in lieu of the big picture?   Also, how much do you care what people think of you? I know you say you can be a bit awkward because you're not all that great at emotionally connecting with people, but how aware are you of what other people are thinking about you? Do you often ""sense"" disapproval or feel an urge to try and fit in?  In terms of your direction in life (heheh I know, bear with me), do you have a tendency to get get focused on a specific direction/plan for yourself, have a hard time sticking to something because you see many possible options for yourself, or do you not really think about things like that and just go with the flow?"

mbti,393dol,superange128,7,Mon Jun 8 23:37:05 2015 UTC,"1/2 You interact with the person and see what functions you can spot, and work from there. The tertiary and inferior are important as well, because the flavour the tertiary gives to the two primary functions and the distinctive behaviors stemming from the inferior function can give really good clues to things. You often determine the person's type more by the inferior function and that tertiary vibe than the uppermost two functions' ""strength"".  3. J/P does not affect the order of the functions, it affects the attitudes. N/S T/F tell you the two primary root functions, J/P tells you the attitudes. E/I is what finally orders them. The last three letters determine the stack.  ie: xNTx => Nx Tx primary, Sx Fx lesser xNTP => perceiving extroverted, so Ne Ti primary, Si Fe lesser ENTP => dom extrovrted, so Ne Ti Fe Si as final order.  4. Not really, social extroversion/introversion doesn't go hand in hand with cognitive extroversion/introversion. They often correlate, but it's dangerous to use social I/E as more than circumstantial evidence. Just try to spot whatever functions you can - just knowing they use a function is a huge help in communication.  5. Because the lesser functions also influence a person's cognition and understanding how people take in, evaluate and organize information is the point of typology. There's a lot to a person that can't be explained with the functions, let alone just the two primary ones.  6. Si does not mean you are necessarily traditionalistic. It means you habituate things over time and are likely to have rich, vivid, visceral memories of things that you use to guide your decisionmaking. The ""traditionalist"" trope is born of the fast pace of current society essentially leaving older Si types behind, them having ingrained a different kind of worldview in themselves when they were younger.  If I had to put it somehow:  Dominant: What you compulsively do, often to the point you're unaware of it. Easily capable of nuanced handling of things.      Auxiliary: What you habitually do, strength you're more conscious of. Capable of nuanced handling of things.      Tertiary: Usable tool, often unconscious until brought up. Can be strong, but isn't as capable of nuance as the primary functions - this can result in it just being off in its conclusions, or having a naive quality to it.  Inferior: Unconscious, ideal to strive for, point of weakness. Prone to related addict-like behavior. Conclusions drawn from the inferior tend to be starkly black and white."

mbti,393dol,Entr0pic08,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:00:53 2015 UTC,"1.When attempting to type out another person, you would do it through interaction and observation of how they interact/act and aim to mostly figure out what their dom/auxiliary functions are?   Seems about right.   2.If dom and auxiliary are supposed to be the main ones a person would show.. what if you are not sure which one is more pronounced? Is there are a way to figure out if one is actually introverted vs extroverted through just more observation of which happens to be more pronounced or perhaps going to the Tertiary function?   It may be useful to look for the inferior function, rather than tertiary.    3.This is more of a confirmation question but the reason Judging/Perceiving helps determine order of functions is because:   It can help but only for extroverts. It works the opposite way for introverts.    6.When figuring out how the functions ""work with each other"", is this something that just comes through time by typing someone and understanding why the functions work with each other and how it all adds up to the 4 letters?   Pretty much.   7.What exactly does the _w_s or whatever mean. How is it/can be used to help type and how does it relate to functions?   It's enneagram lingo and if you want to understand how that works, I'd recommend picking up the system. It's too exhaustive to go into here."

I must be a negative INFP because I am much more cynical than I think most INFPs are. Also the fact that the nickname is ""the dreamer""  isn't completely me. I guess I do day dream and fantasize a lot, but its not like I'm completely aloof while doing it and I don't really get lost in crazy fantasies or anything. I sort of imagine myself in various situations or different futures or in like a parallel reality that is better than my current life.

mbti,390co3,Jakobeisawesome,4,Mon Jun 8 09:18:32 2015 UTC,"The way the tests measure it, they have four scales or dimensions they measure you on by your answers and list your preferences on those scales as your type code. Being near the middle is completely expected, and just measures the strength of your preference along those scales. Having no clear preference is just that, and completely normal.  The functional approach to type that is preferred on this subreddit is different - everyone is a Thinker and a Feeler, just as everyone is Sensing and has iNtuition.  The functional approach is a rough a model that tries to explain how you take in, evaluate and organize information by dividing the information processing into four core processes (Thinking, Feeling, Sensing and Intuition) each of which has two attitudes (ie. extraversion, or interest in the external world, and introversion, ie. interest in what is going on inside your head) and then figuring out which processes you use in what attitudes. They're often shortened to a function code of Core process and Attitude, ie. Sensing in the extroverted attitude = Se.  Two examples would be using the Thinking function focusing more on personal models (introverted Thinking, Ti) or the state of the outside world or analyzed system (extroverted Thinking, Te), or using Feeling to focus more on the harmony of the group (extroverted Feeling, Fe)  Using your test scores to assign yourself a functional type is probably a bad idea: The tests measure what they measure, and the functions approach looks at something a bit different. They share history, so they use the same code, but the meaning behind the code is different.  Test ENTP v. ENTJ, for example, is basically whether the person is more haphazard and spontaneous or more planned, conscientious and orderly - it's directly what they measure.  In Function-land, where we look at how the person takes in, evaluates and organizes information, ENTPs and ENTJs use an entirely different set of processes:  ENTPs are primarily watchers who lead with extroverted Intuition (Ne) - it's an exploring, brainstorming kind of process that draws its inspiration from the outside world and is very interested in it, and complement that with Ti - an evaluating process that focuses on building accurate mental models of things. How the cogs turn is more important than what that turning accomplishes.  ENTJs lead with extroverted Thinking or Te - cold, detached reasoning like Ti, but focused on evaluating the properties of the outside world and exerting control over it, usually with the aim of ordering it to be more efficient. They complement this with introverted Intuition, which in contrast to Ne's curious exploration just drinks in tons of information and subconsciously finds patterns in there that it then condenses it into a holistic understanding of how something ticks that the Ni type himself often needs to work to ""map out"".  In short, they're totally different :D Same applies to INTP vs. INFP - in test-land the difference is a slight preference to Thinking or Feeling, but in Function-land an INTPs primary processes are Ti (dominant) and Ne (auxiliary), while INFPs lead with Fi and use Ne as auxiliary - their compulsive, dominant process is different, which is a large change.  If that sounds like hebrew to you, I have good news. The good news is that functions are not that hard.  A function is just a pattern of operation that's ingrained in us, that we're drawn to, a way we do certain things, take in, process, organize information. Although they're often talked about as if they were spirits or something that possess us (because they do inform our behavior somewhat), they're not straitjackets that force you to do something, nor do you need a function to do something. I'm bad at symbolic logic because of the way I'm drawn to think when I think in a cold, impartial manner - someone else's ingrained pattern can be naturally suited to the exercise and they'll find it far lighter work than I do, for example.  The same way, some people are naturally concerned about how others feel about things and that a group they're in has a good vibe. I'm not wired to pay attention to that stuff, but I can if I decide to. But it's not an ingrained in me the way it is in some others.  A second strength of the functional approach is that it tells it like it is - everyone is a Thinker, a Feeler, a Sensor, everyone has at least a bit of iNtuition in them. The functional approach says ""Everyone is a Thinker and a Feeler, but what kind of Thinker and Feeler?"", ie. focuses on the how instead of trying to say someone is one or the other.   There's two places that consistently make good functions-centric typology content with the 4 function stack model in mind and without much pollution from other systems. Michael Pierce's Youtube channel and the CelebrityTypes website.  For starting out, this playlist by Michael Pierce is probably the best introduction to typology on the 'net - it's certainly what made a sea of impossible jargon click for me the first time:  Lessons on functions-based typology by Michael Pierce  Celebritytypes has good comparison tables for the different functions - this is probably good to look at side by side with Pierce's introductory videos.  After the Lessons:  Pierce's portraits of the sixteen types in video  Pierce's portraits of the sixteen types as text  Another look at the functions by Pierce  CelebrityTypes' articles section is full of good stuff"

I like how Pierce describes the functions as being opposite ends of the same axis. and therefore, essentially one function instead of two (i.e. Ni/Se & Si/Ne) and the only difference is which direction of the same road you are traveling on. Assuming that Pierce is correct here, does that mean that the S end of the axis can compensate better for a larger imbalance with N development than say vice versa, or with a similar T/F imbalance?  Or maybe it tends to do so more often, but not necessarily better? I can see that it might be the most abstract function and maybe someone can function on their sensory perception almost entirely, but could that not also be said of feeling or any function for that matter?  You seem to be pretty knowledgeable here, so I appreciate any insight you might want to share."
mbti,390co3,noodlewith0butter,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:26:12 2015 UTC,"No, I mean that everyone uses the four base functions - Thinking, Feeling, Sensing, iNtuition in some capacity (ie. you could read it as everyone is an iNtuitor and catch the meaning I was going for) - everyone has both ends of both poles, they just prefer one end more.  It's not about compensation, people are just wired to work in different ways and that makes them prone to develop different strengths and weaknesses.  Ranking functions like that just feels like an odd idea to me, honestly."

Ti versus Fi can be very confusing because the descriptions don't really make this clear.  i would watch Michael Pierce's videos on INTP and then INFP to get a more holistic sense of the types. also, research the functions for each and look at general descriptions too."

Functions exist in two opposing pairs.  Your results can only cause confusion because they are contradictory. Take one of the better MBTI type tests like on celebritytypes.com or personalityjunkie.com.  Use that as a baseline. It only takes ten minutes.  It might be spot on the first time or might not.  Question the results with studying the functions independently. Studying the functions is definitely the way to go if you want to have a true understanding of MBTI, but the profiles do have some merit.  For me, learning the functions is like taking something apart and understanding the core. Profiles are like what it looks like when it is assembled.  For me it is like I have to take apart each type and put it back together again to understand what is really going on.  The functions are the puzzle pieces, where as the picture on the box is what it is supposed to look like, kind of like the profiles."
mbti,38z2vq,jermofo,3,Mon Jun 8 04:00:16 2015 UTC,"It was actually kind of interesting in hindsight.  I took the one on celebritytypes, and I got infj or intj which is funny because I've been typing myself as an infp, which are said to sometimes wear an ""intj mask"" I believe :)    I really think my functions are infp or enfp, but I'm not 100% sure how to tell other than reading about each type to make sure.  I definitely think I identify more as an infp (which is what I've actually been typed as on most tests), but it's definitely hard to feel confident when there are so many types and I really don't identify with the infp subreddit at all!"
mbti,38z2vq,bezald,3,Mon Jun 8 04:10:51 2015 UTC,"just curious, would you describe yourself as a more energetic person who needs to share ideas a LOT? i've found that many many ENFPs will mistype themselves as introverts but put ENFPs and INFPs next to eachother and the difference in energy levels is pretty clear.   ENFPs are the most introverted extroverts apparently, so it can be confusing"
mbti,38z2vq,bezald,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:31:17 2015 UTC,"I feel that all I want to do is share ideas!  I can talk about, say, womens studies or the idea of the death penalty for hours, and then still want to talk about it the next day.  I thrive on class discussions because I learn through talking.    Being bubbly may not be the way to describe it, but I need to be able to share my ideas"
mbti,38z2vq,bezald,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:31:54 2015 UTC,hmm could be dom-Ne! would people describe you as energetic? do you go crazy if you spend too much time cooped up? do you NEED to go out and experience the world?
mbti,38z2vq,bezald,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:17:45 2015 UTC,"huh I don't know.  I think I'm a lot less content to be home all day than I used to be, and I get pretty restless and lonely if I'm home alone for a long time."
mbti,38z2vq,jermofo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:22:49 2015 UTC,could you be described as soft-spoken?
mbti,38z2vq,Komatik,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:25:04 2015 UTC,hmm I guess?  I have a pretty gentle voice in general
mbti,38z2vq,bezald,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:22:22 2015 UTC,it might be helpful to ask your closest friend(s) to describe you! i've found that ENFPs often think they're quieter and more introverted-seeming than they really are  would you say you're more inside your head or trying to engage with the outside world and explore outside of yourself and with other people?
mbti,38z2vq,Komatik,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:39:11 2015 UTC,"Well I've always considered myself to be a more outgoing infp, actually.  I'm very much in my own head a lot of the time, but I think I have a need to share that with people, since I learn a lot from actually talking.  Most of my thinking is actually more in the form of an imagined conversation"
mbti,38z2vq,Wanderall,2,Tue Jun 9 15:31:45 2015 UTC,"I'd check out personalityjunkie.com then.  His descriptions are a good blend of functions and real life observations.  If you are torn between INFP and INTJ, what really resonates with me is Ne.  Ne is scatter brained, but in a good way.  If you write a paper or start a conversation, do you know exactly where you are going with it (Ni) or do you figure it out as you go along or forget what you were talking about(Ne)?  Ne takes one thing and sees a thousand connections.  Ni, looks to understand the hidden meanings and motives behind everything that they already kind of know somehow.  Ne is the easiest for me to spot."
mbti,38z2vq,iongantas,2,Mon Jun 8 04:21:52 2015 UTC,"Small correction here - an INTJ would probably figure it out as he goes as well, but in a different way. Ni is peculiar in that all the pattern recognition stuff tends to happen unconsciously, and the result gets brought to consciousness, if that. The result is that an INTJ often knows the destination he's heading for, but not the path there. That path has to be retraced in the conscious mind, which often involves as-you-go Te use (Te operation being more think out loud and structure your ideas as you go, which results in frequent corrections, clarifications and small asides - this is something you can see in Nietzsche's writing (at least if the university translations are reasonably faithful) and in the way Dario Nardi speaks in his Authors@Google talk).  The key difference is knowing where you're headed vs. going about and seeing where the path takes you."
mbti,38z2vq,iongantas,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:56:47 2015 UTC,I think I'm definitely Ne; the more I talk about it the more easy it is to trust my judgement over a test.  I guess it's better to know how you behave and type based on that  rather than going off of questions about your opinions.    I'm more torn between infp and enfp
mbti,38z2vq,Komatik,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:39:26 2015 UTC,fwiw i originally took the humanmetrics mbti test and got the proper result. can't confirm how accurate it is for most tho
mbti,38z2vq,Komatik,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:36:34 2015 UTC,"Yup, INFPs and INTJs can be very similar in some respects - fierce individualism and a monomaniac obsession about certain interests being common shared traits.  As far as INFP/ENFP, are you more bouncy, energetic, springy, perhaps a bit scatterbrained, or more calm and collected? Dominant Ne is far more energetic than auxiliary Ne on average."
mbti,38z2vq,LeapingLemonz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:51:38 2015 UTC,"I think of myself as pretty scatterbrained; I have a pretty amazing memory for what people say or things I've learned/done (anything that is important to me, really), but I'll forget where something is or that I saw which parent picked up their kid or somebody's name or anything like that almost instantly.    I'm very hot and cold on an energy level.  I can be around people/kids for hours and run around and be entertaining and genuinely have fun doing it, and then come home and go out to eat with my boyfriend and talk and joke for another few hours, and then all of a sudden I want to be alone and get stressed out by the thought of doing anything together."
mbti,38z2vq,Komatik,3,Tue Jun 9 15:37:17 2015 UTC,Short answer
mbti,38z2vq,autowikibot,2,Mon Jun 8 08:22:34 2015 UTC,I like the way you think
mbti,38z2vq,LeapingLemonz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:37:29 2015 UTC,"You should take several different tests, but then also read various literature to learn about functions and preferences (which are two different angles of looking at the same thing, though the function model seems to be preferred).  Ignore function stack models, they aren't especially accurate.  Type ultimately only indicates what your best function is, and then what the better of two optional complementary functions is.  So if your function stack from greatest to least turns out Ne Te Si Fe Fi Se Ni Ti, then you would be an ENFP, because your top function is Ne (an Extroverted Perceiving function, and the higher complementary is Fi, even though you have other, more well developed/preferred functions. But!  If your Ne and Te were very close, you might be an ESTJ instead.  To be sure, the function stack I listed was totally random and might be a very unlikely result."
mbti,38z2vq,LeapingLemonz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:16:35 2015 UTC,"Oh that's really helpful!  I've tested as an infp a lot, but I sometimes wonder if we test as how we want to be or how we are.  Testing closer to infj or intj was really weird for me, but now I'm wondering if that's because I try to balance myself out by being mire like that"
mbti,38yrte,Omariuscp,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:01:19 2015 UTC,"ENTJ.  Agressive, empire building psychopath."
mbti,38yrte,vanillamasala,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:14:56 2015 UTC,Yeah i can see that actually.
mbti,38xh6b,Xaluar,8,Sun Jun 7 17:58:22 2015 UTC,"I'm INFJ - I'm pretty sure that our types are supposed to be attracted to each other. I do have an ENFP friend that I'm very close with and I understand what would make our types ""click"" (but I'd never date her for other reasons).  But the thing about MBTI is that it makes lots of sweeping generalizations, and in my opinion, saying certain types attract is a generalization on a generalization. Any type can be spontaneous in their own way, etc."
mbti,38xh6b,santasmic,5,Sun Jun 7 18:37:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, even compared to my other enfp friends I am very different. Myers briggs doesn't factor in absolutely everything about your personality anyway."
mbti,38xh6b,Draco309,2,Sun Jun 7 18:57:03 2015 UTC,"ENFP/INFJ is, in my opinion, the second best pairing for ENFPs,coming in  right after ENFP/INTJ.   I think it's not so much that MBTI makes sweeping generalizations as much as people who read about it do. I find the biggest contributor that isn't accounted for in MBTI(For good reason, since it's very, very varied) is the nurture aspect of how we act.   It's not just who raised you though, it has a lot to do with other things in your environment;  position in the family(youngest, oldest, middle, only), the common beliefs of the time (modern day ENFPs would probably be quite different from ones from the 1950s) and religion(I'm not going to put more here because I think it would start a debate. :P)."
mbti,38xh6b,santasmic,3,Sun Jun 7 19:01:51 2015 UTC,"I agree. For example, when I say I wouldn't date my friend, it's because of a few things that can't really be attributed to enfps. She's more of a sister. But if I met an enfp that was just a little different, I can definitely see how the pairing works."
mbti,38xh6b,Entr0pic08,0,Sun Jun 7 19:14:15 2015 UTC,I have really no idea why this is down voted.
mbti,38xh6b,Draco309,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:26:43 2015 UTC,"I find Infj's easier to deal with than Intjs for sure, in everyday life at least! However I had a thing with an Infj once (he identifies as an Intj but he is definitely an Infj) and the main problem was that he was a little too overemotional. I am very outwardly emotional too and we clashed, also I am quite careless and didn't realise that I was hurting his feelings. He was too shy to properly explain to me, and blamed himself. Eventually when everything came out, we had a massive full blown argument which was very heated and once we fell out, we never made up."
mbti,38xh6b,bezald,2,Sun Jun 7 19:09:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I'm just making a guess, but that sounds like an INFP, rather than an INFJ. They lead with Fi, which would explain why he was more emotional(INFJs lead with Ni, followed by Fe). In my experience, INFPs tend to do the sort of thing you just said too.   If you haven't read aboutthe functions, I highly suggest you do. I find it helps clear up the issue of not being sure what someone's type is (especially if you aren't sure on the J/P.)  EDIT: Whoops, thought you were the above INFJ. Let me fix some things. Most of the post still applies, because ENFPs lead with Ne followed by Fi, so it would still explain why said INFP is very emotional."

mbti,38xh6b,NotWearingPantsObv,2,Mon Jun 8 11:03:26 2015 UTC,"i've found that INFJ-ENFP seems to be most successful as a 'pal' pairing although it does happen as a romantic one. if you look at /r/infj, INFJs tend to prefer INTP, ENTP and INTJ for longterm romantic relationships... helps strengthen the Ti + i think many INFJs feel more emotionally grounded by having a more dominant thinking partner. might be more complementary for some."
mbti,38xh6b,TK4442,3,Sun Jun 7 21:36:49 2015 UTC,"opposites may attract but i've found that complementary opposites often stay together: types that share thinking and feeling functions in the entirely reverse order or just share the same thinking and feeling functions.   INFP + ESTJ? functions in a totally opposite order. seemingly completely opposite individuals. commonly occurring longterm relationship pairing.  INFP + ESTP? no functions in common and almost unheard of as a longterm pairing.  of course, in practice anything can work, but trend-wise this all seems to have truth to it  one exception seems to be with dom-Ni, where INTJs and INFJs seem to have a deep understanding based on a rare function connection"
mbti,38xh6b,kairisika,3,Sun Jun 7 21:35:02 2015 UTC,"exactly this.  ESTPs and INFJs might look like opposites, but I relate to them on a level I never could with INFPs."
mbti,38xh6b,TK4442,4,Mon Jun 8 09:57:35 2015 UTC,"I wish threads like this could somehow note and color-code contributions from people who've never actually had a romantic relationship in actual life, yet have lots to say on the topic."
mbti,38xh6b,kairisika,3,Mon Jun 8 03:44:51 2015 UTC,"I'd filter that further by people who have never had a romantic relationship over the age of 18.    I understand you may feel wise, but I'm really not interested in the 'dating' experience of a 16-year-old, no matter how extensive."
mbti,38xh6b,atmosking,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:56:45 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I don't know. I'm in my 40s with some relatively substantial serious relationship experience, and I don't know if I agree or not.   Mainly my focus is on ungrounded theory versus experience. I think there's way too much of the former and way too little of the latter in discussions on this sub. I think that encourages a certain amount of shallowness and fake-ness masquerading as expertise, and that is likely part of why this sub is dying/dead-ish. Given that context, qualitative differences of dating experience aren't as interesting to me, I guess. But that's just me."
mbti,38xh6b,CritSrc,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:39:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know many people over the age of 20 who consider their junior-high ""dating"" experience to be indicative of anything that carried much past junior high."

Oh, ENFPs... eh, they're fine, they're fun, wish I was. But nothing romantic, keep being friends giving each other a shoulder and some advice. One thing to understand is that INTPs can provide understanding and that's the extent of emotional support you should expect, because anything further would require them seeking emotional support from breaking down."
mbti,38xh6b,CritSrc,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:33:53 2015 UTC,"My INTP boyfriend is totally different haha with regards to his preferences! We definitely work romantically. He is great because we both enjoy doing the same things, have exactly the same sense of humour and can talk about things for hours on end. I am not too insecure and so don't demand emotional support from him too much anyway. Our only major difference is my optimism and his pessimism especially with regards to deeper events as opposed to superficial problems, like he will get very upset if he thinks he's let his family down by getting a bad mark in a test, whereas I won't care at all. But in every day life he is so spontaneous and fun, and very laid back. INTPs I find are the only type who seem to work both as best friends and soulmates (though they would never believe in soulmates). My flatmate is an Esfj and my boyfriend can't stand her, lol. She is very controlling and way too intense when in a relationship. I guess we're all different though as MBTi is pretty subjective anyway! I think that was the whole point of this discussion."

She is very controlling and way too intense when in a relationship.   Well, that's unhealthy.   MBTI is pretty subjective anyway!   It does, after all, just give you a skeleton of mental patterns, and nothing else, personality is up to the individual."

mbti,38xh6b,corsetxcandy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:57:06 2015 UTC,haha yeah. some pairings overall seem to have more communication/fundamental misunderstandings than others though. Ti + Fe versus Fi + Te can be a tricky divide for longterm closeness.

I can see the conflicts between opposites but I am very, very accommodating and flexible for those that I really like. It helps that my divide between E/I and J/P scores are really weak.

mbti,38xh6b,Dahmer,2,Mon Jun 8 02:38:03 2015 UTC,"I think ENFJ-ENTJ pairings are definitely a power couple type. Most ENxJs tend to be enneagram 3 (or 8 for ENTJ) or they at least have the wing, so this makes a lot of sense. Even without taking enneagram into consideration, both types tend to be very ambitious and efficient. I am really into the idea of being a ""power couple."" I imagine ENFJ-ENTJ to be amazing. Oh yeah, ENTJs are immensely attractive :p"

mbti,38xh6b,SwagSea,2,Mon Jun 8 03:00:58 2015 UTC,"I think everyone looks for something different in a relationship, which is what makes the MBTI ""perfect pairing"" compatibility kind of difficult. I'm a female INTJ and I have a few ENFP friends, some of who are male. We have amazing friend chemistry but it's always been strictly platonic. I guess I'm attracted to some similarities as well as some differences, just as you are with your SO, while my INTJ male friend tends to have a thing for other INTJs (no thanks). The only real pattern that I've noticed for myself is that I tend to be attracted to ExTxs. ENTPs and INTJs is an interesting one, since we have pretty good chemistry but according to socionics it's a very bad match. I think MBTI can provide a good basis when it comes to interpersonal relationships, but generally they are just far too complicated for MBTI to predict everything."
mbti,38xh6b,Draco309,2,Sun Jun 7 22:31:27 2015 UTC,"INTP female dating an INTJ male for about 2 years. I can definitley see him (INTJ) being initially attracted to ENFPs (isn't everyone?). They can keep a conversation going and are quirky, open, and fun. Even if the INTJ seems reclusive and doesn't share as much as you do as an ENFP, they actually do appreciate chatterboxes. TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. However, INTJs are notoriously stubborn and self righteous. These qualities do give them a stern confidence that draws flaky personalities like ENFPs in, but it also means that they will judge you ruthlessly once you become closer. They will point out flaws in your logical thinking at any given time and they will be annoyed at someone who cannot 'keep up' with their thinking and views. This will cause the ENFP to feel hurt as they don't take criticism well and obsess about it for ages. ENFPs do possess that intellectual quality that INTJs appreciate, but it differs alot from their own Ni/Te-driven mechanisms and conversation and reasoning might chafe.   ENFPs can also get sentimental and are in an emotional state every day, which is hard for the INTJ to handle. INTJs rarely look to the past and are always envisioning the future instead, and what goals he/she would like to achieve and how they are going to do that. ENFPs want to go out, party, sit in cafes, go to flea markets (don't pretend you don't like that shit).... all things that INTJs loathe.   ENFJs however have some sort of magic spell over INTJs. I don't know what it is, but they are lost almost instantly. That one is a very, very, dangerous game though. I've seen it and it was ugly."
mbti,38xh6b,Draco309,2,Mon Jun 8 08:35:31 2015 UTC,"Also, my ex was an ESTJ (yeah... I know). We actually got along very well initially, they're active and driven which I admire. He would always take me out on alot of activities, which I enjoyed, and was super attentive with stuff like birthdays and other celebrations. Always made sure I was feeling safe and appreciated (which INTJs are far worse at). But they relationship ultimately fell apart because we were so different at the chore. He was traditional and at times very narrow minded, had a bad temper and would always push me to 'get things in order' like a parent would which drove me (INTP) insane as I am very laid back and like to take things as they come. Obviously the whole 'go with the flow'-vibe doesn't sit well with an ESTJ at all and even seemingly minor stuff may very well become a dealbreaker, such as ignoring a phone call or failing to call back at some point.  In the end him and I just argued every conversation we had. He thought I was a shitty girlfriend and that I didn't care about anything, including him, and I was sick of being pressured and treated like a child constantly. Before we started a romantic relationship we had been friends for some time and looking back, our friendship is what I liked the most. I think the polar opposite thingo might not be entirely true, but if there was some truth to it I think it's more in regards to friendship rather than lasting romantic relationships. Ultimately I think most people wan't someone that effortlessly understand them so that you don't have to spend the first few months (or years even) working to extinct that friction that is between two opposing types."

I wonder if the fact that ""opposites"" having their functions basically flipped is the only basis for the whole ""opposite pairs are ideal"" hypothesis. Apparently they're supposed to complement each other and create a whole from two pairs like Yin and Yang or something."

mbti,38xh6b,kairisika,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:04:36 2015 UTC,"ENFP here. Out of curiosity, have you looked into the functions? I don't have a whole lot of info to go off of, but they way you described your SO sounded kind of INTJish. The functions explain the tendencies you see between 2 very different types. This is really just my gut instinct though, and obviously you know better than I do.   I've been best friends with an INTP for many many years, and I find our conversations are usually deep, but about more sallow things. is your SO pretty open with you? I know my buddy tends to only talk about his feelings on a rare occasions.   Final note, I've heard the perfect match is when you have the same middle 2 functions, but they are reversed, and the other side of the other's first and last function. To give an example, ENFPs are Ne/Fi/Te/Si/, and INTJs are Ni/Te/Fi/Se  Oh! The simple answer to your question? I do believe opposites attract, but if they are exact opposites it will only work out decently."

mbti,38xh6b,LogicalEmotion7,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:36:29 2015 UTC,Well occasionally I get a weird arousal when an attractive woman yell at me  but most SJ women I know hate my existence and I try to avoid them.
mbti,38xh6b,LogicalEmotion7,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:48:37 2015 UTC,"Me too. I find SJ's very difficult to keep as friends. My flatmate was an SJ and sometimes I would accidentally make noise at night time cause I'm a bit clumsy and my door was quite heavy. She used to barge into my room at night and scream at me, and eventually stuck a sponge on my door to stop it slamming. Another time I broke one of her glasses by accident, I apologised and she flew home for 2 weeks without telling me that was why she was angry. I was desperately trying to message her because I was scared she was sick or something. I just don't understand their reactions! My mum is an SJ too and sometimes she also reacts 'oddly' in arguments and gets angry for no reason."

mbti,38ytkz,RosalindaG,2,Mon Jun 8 00:14:41 2015 UTC,"My brother and I had this discussion a couple weeks ago, although I'm not sure we came to a definitive conclusion. I'd say he's ISTJ if I had to guess. The thinking feeling one is difficult to pinpoint. On the one hand, he asks pressing questions and seems to be not very affectionate or caring, but on the other, he's quite tactful and presents his arguments well. What are your thoughts?"
mbti,38ytkz,TurtleSmile1,2,Mon Jun 8 06:57:55 2015 UTC,"I think an F could ask pressing questions that disregard feelings of others if they felt it was for a social justice cause.   I think for Fi users especially, our tertiary Te will kick in when we go into social warrior mode and we'll start taking names and laying down the law. I don't know that he's an Fi, but it's worth noting."
mbti,38ytkz,burrit0z,2,Mon Jun 8 13:37:59 2015 UTC,"My best guess is ENFJ. He doesn't seem like an introvert to me. He seems pretty intuitive and has a very good control over guiding people's feelings, very Fe. I can't be sure, though. Based on the ISTJs i've met, I don't think he fits that."
