I applaud anyone using them to quit smoking, but it's becoming a ridiculous fad. When kids who have never even smoked a cigarette come at me with some uneducated diatribe about using them to quit, then proceed to talk about ""blowing clouds bro"", it becomes unbearable.   Not to say that's every user, just the majority I encounter."
reversegif,381qgw,giantfuckingbears,2,Mon Jun 1 16:09:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and lots of people spout ""it's not bad for you!"" Anything in your lungs other than air is probably bad for you. We know it's bad for you, we just have yet to quantify it. Sure, it's probably better than cigarettes, but there's no way in hell it's good for you. In my experience there are a lot of people who vape that don't really talk about it. I think a lot of the reason you hear it so much from those bro-types is because they're more vocal about it. Most other people just smoke them at home or on their smoke breaks and don't say a word about it."
reversegif,381qgw,PowerMonkey500,2,Mon Jun 1 16:14:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I use a vaporizor, but I know it is not good for me.   Commonly hear, ""Its just water vapor"" well no, unless I misunderstand the science. What you are doing is vaporizing either propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin.  Both are diuretics, and will dry out the mouth, lungs, throat, sinuses and nostrils, none of which can be healthy.  We also don't have a full understanding of the effects of what absorbing such chemicals have when absorbed through the lungs.  That is before we even add in the flavorings, which I am almost 100% are not healthy when absorbed through the lungs.  Im planning to quit them quickly because I found out they are the likely cause of my recent sinusitis, leading to fatigue, muscle tightness, dizzy spells and vertigo, the latter two of which in turn leads to anxiety attacks.   While I will agree they get a bad wrap in the media, I am not delusional enough to think they are healthy beyond being unquantifiably better than smoking. I personally believe they should be classed as cessation aids rather than a smoking alternatives."

reversegif,2ok53i,DJGreenHill,10,Sun Dec 7 21:48:07 2014 UTC,this implies you are not on mobile. Mobiles don't care about the link arguments.

reversegif,2nlp7t,tbird412,7,Fri Nov 28 04:41:04 2014 UTC,Gfycat has a rewind button that reverses the gif. I just happened to reverse it before posting.
reversegif,2nlp7t,tbird412,5,Fri Nov 28 04:48:31 2014 UTC,"LOL, well that was un-fulfilling as I still cannot figure out what in the world that cat was trying to do"
reversegif,2nlp7t,PokeZim,2,Fri Nov 28 13:43:36 2014 UTC,It was most likely spooked. Cats have a weird reflex to just jump backwards and flip to run away.
reversegif,2nlp7t,phamily_man,6,Fri Nov 28 14:57:28 2014 UTC,"you can see something fly straight up and never come down at the end of the reversed video.   Someone threw a toy and the cat jumps to get it, landing on the nightstand instead of bed and freaks out."
reversegif,2nlp7t,phamily_man,2,Fri Nov 28 15:22:10 2014 UTC,"You're totally right, you can even see the shadow approach just before the cat jumps at it. Good catch.   That makes the original so much better. Taking it frame by frame (man I love gfycat's interface), you can see how honed in on it the cat was."
