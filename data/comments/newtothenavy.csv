newtothenavy,3e50mt,Interfaithe,5,Wed Jul 22 00:28:16 2015 UTC,"Im very confused by this post, youre joining as a reservist? Active? Looked over your past posts and looks like youre looking into reserves. If you go to CT a school youre going to have to be in the rate sometime before they let you just cross rate, and even then comes down to manning and availability, and by nurse Im assuming you mean hm. Also navy enlistments to my knowledge are all at least 4 years active, confused honestly what youre looking into getting out of the navy."
newtothenavy,3e50mt,eskudo12791,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:38:54 2015 UTC,"My apologies, I will be joining as a reservist! I'm not looking to get out anything from the navy, except valuable work experience applicable to many different areas of life, as well as life experience. Also, I'm not verse in the Navy lingo, so I don't know what 'rate' or 'cross rate' or 'hm' means. Could you please elaborate? Thank you!"
newtothenavy,3e50mt,LuciusPotens,2,Wed Jul 22 00:58:17 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand your motives. If your priorities all lie in your nursing career path, I don't get why you're thinking if joining. Even though reserves will give you the chance to follow that path you've laid out, it wouldn't be that easy or straightforward.   Granted I know less about how the reserves work but I agree with everyone else saying that it would be hard to cross rate from CT to HM. I say this for two reasons. First, CT is a technical rate and requires a fair amount of training. And second, HM is historically overmanned.    I feel like you should look at options where the navy would pay for nursing school and then you'd owe them a few years. Afterwards, you can get out and go to the other school and continue your nursing career."
newtothenavy,3e50mt,eskudo12791,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:15:26 2015 UTC,"So rate would be your job, as you saying youre interested in 'CT'. HM refers to Navy Hospital Corpsman.  Like the other post said it may be tough to cross rate, change rates from CT to HM."
newtothenavy,3e50mt,TRVPlaw,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:02:03 2015 UTC,"A rate is your job in the Navy. Cross rate would be to change jobs (some jobs would be impossible to change to or from). HM stands for corpseman (enlisted side ""nurse""). All jobs in the Navy have abbreviations for the job such as CT (cryptological technician).    Also if you are a reservist you would only dedicate a weekend every month to the Navy. There would be no ""full time"" unless you decided to deploy."
newtothenavy,3e50mt,LuciusPotens,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:05:33 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Often times, people looking at joining talk about cross rating as if it's really easy to do. The process itself isn't easy and to get a specific rate almost completely depends on manning and availability of not only the rate you want to move to but also the rate you're currently in."
newtothenavy,3e50mt,willamsweave,2,Wed Jul 22 05:19:03 2015 UTC,"If you're joining as Active Duty, you probably won't have time for nursing school until you finish your contact.  If you're going for reservist, then cool for you. You'll more than likely be fine, but Nursing school is very challenging and you will come to hate giving up one sacred weekend a month for the Navy.   Working as a nurse in the Navy for just two years is probably not going to happen, they want you to make a CAREER out of it. And plus, the minimum is more likely to end up being three or more years.  If you are planning on trying to get them to pay for nursing school AND get a Navy nursing positiion, it might work out--but it is HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, even for prior service people.   Don't lose hope, just stay focused!   Source: I am a nursing student that is in the throes of trying to get a military position."

The slang term is ""kicker,"" as in ""I got a kicker for reupping for four more years.""  The Navy won't give you a single red cent until you've fulfilled your half of the bargain--going to bout camp, graduating your required schooling, reenlisting etc.   You can certainly ask about enlistment bonuses but a majority of rates do not qualify for them.   If you are in a place of financial hardship, once you are active duty, you can sit down with your command's financial specialist or a volunteer at the Navy Marine Corps Relief Society and they will help you wrote a budget. The NMCRS will also allow you an interest free loan that is taken out of your paycheck. It is essentially a payday loan in that they will recoup it from your paycheck, but it is not predatory lending because there is 0% interest.  AFAIK there's nothing like that available for potential recruits though."

Docs may be different.  The Navy bends over backwards to get professionals like docs/nurses/lawyers to join up, so maybe for you they can give some support?  Either way, if you do join you can always get a career starter loan from USAA which is....$25k at a super low interest rate?  Never took it myself, but from what I hear it was quite nice.  training - yeah, you go to ODS.  You show up commissioned to get scolded at by chiefs.  You were the subject of OCS sneers, mostly because you get a much better deal than we get.  Afterwards, you go down to P-cola for flight doc training.  Afterwards you get to go to SERE at some point (yay....) and get attached to a squadron or wing....with the occasional flight/cross country.  It's a pretty damn good deal for the most part. Talk to an officer recruiter for the nitty-gritty details.  3rd point - All of that will be evaluated before going to Rhode Island.  After ODS, if you fail out then you'll either be retained to do something else medical side or let go.  That's typically at the discretion of the Navy.  Yes, the uncertainty sucks, but welcome to Naval aviation training.  You'll have people get accepted as naval aviators only to be medically declined and separated from the navy all in the span of a few months.  You'll be at the whim of NAMI (medically speaking, which will be the dragon you'll continually fight your entire time as a flight doc) and the P-cola training command.  living situation - in Newport, you'll live at ODS.  It's an old building where the walls have decades worth of despair and depression soaked into them.  They were built at a time where ""powerful"" concrete structures spoke towards power (cold war), but now just look as depressing as that entire time period.  Down in P-cola you'll live wherever the hell you want in town or on base, and make BAH while living there.

I think the blurriness started to go away after 2 weeks. I was down to 20/20 about 7 weeks after the surgery. My eyes were dry for 5 or 6 months so I was constantly using eye drops. The preservative free single use ones are worth the extra money. Make sure you keep up on the medicated drops the doc gives you. Overall I think it was around $4k for both eyes.

With that being said, you would have to get the surgery, then wait 6 months before they can process any paperwork. You have to provide a 1, 3, and 6 month optometrist report saying your vision is stable.  Good luck. You need to have a good friend or family member for the first 2-3 days of PRK.

I would not be able to get into MEPS until January 10th of the following year. During the between time I can take the ASTB and that's about it.

I don't think you should wait, go talk to your local recruiter and he'll guide you with anything you'd need to get done to enlist.

newtothenavy,3e0qxo,ShaneWegner,2,Tue Jul 21 08:16:17 2015 UTC,"IL does not exempt the military from the two days thing.  If his A school is located anywhere else but Great Lakes, there will be no time to marry PIR weekend.  They fly them out early on Saturday, and they must board that bus to the airport from RTC, no wandering off to see a JoP.    If his A school is in Great Lakes, marrying PIR weekend can be done, but you have to plan it to the minute.  The county clerk is open late Fridays, and judges are available early Saturday.  That said, he signs a page 13 agreeing to follow all the liberty regulations ... and for PIR liberty, that includes not getting married.  While I haven't heard of anyone being punished for getting married, it certainly is within the Navy's authority to punish him for violating the liberty rules.  Not a great way to start a Navy career.  Marrying in A school tends to be wait until he is in phase 2 or 3, he has to put in a special request chit, maybe take a class on finances and responsibility of having a dependent, fly you out to where he is, then marry according to local laws.  Only school I've seen be a bitch over it is the language school in Monterrey.  I'm guessing that has to do with clearances.    I never tell anyone not to marry, but it is true that the early days of a stint in the Navy can be incredibly hard on a new marriage. YOU are not a priority, the Navy is, his training is, and you have to get used to being a second fiddle.  That's why young marriages fall apart, the bonding period is given over to the military.  That's why there is so much advice about waiting."

Enginemen handled the Emergency Diesel Generators and were included in Reactor Department as part of Reactor Auxiliary Division. They racked in the same berthing with the Reactor Propulsion division which was made up of nuke MM's and non-nuke MM on my boat. They handled the propulsion, water and electricity generation, and what not. I was in that division.     There was also an all non-nuke machinist mate division that was not in reactor department. They were part of engineering. I usually ran into them while coordinating with Damage Control or if there was a refrigeration issue in the plant and I needed a spare part.   Torpedosman are usually on subs. I obviously know little of their lifestyle.   Aviation MM's where topside. Since I could neither swim, stand heights, or tolerate skiddles, I never went up there. I imagine they work on planes. When the boat pulls in to home port, they follow the planes to a mystery place where the planes are grown or something...I never really thought about it.

The interesting thing, I helped a kid cross rate from the catapults (he hated that job) to yeoman. As a fluke, he ended up in the reactor office.   He was shocked how different it was and that most of my nuke stories were not bullshit. We do a LOT of stuff that the rest of the navy doesn't do...like require khaki to actually stand watch, leave isn't a given, and that pretty much everyone, despite rank in the department, was required to carry their weight.
