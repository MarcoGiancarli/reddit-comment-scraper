WikiLeaks,3e20qi,cageyp94,13,Tue Jul 21 10:11:02 2015 UTC,Whomever is stupid enough to think Facebook is democratic deserves their consequences.
WikiLeaks,3e20qi,acusticthoughts,7,Tue Jul 21 11:40:07 2015 UTC,Was coming here to say the same thing. Wherever did anyone get the idea that a private platform is democratic?
WikiLeaks,3e20qi,decemberwolf,2,Tue Jul 21 15:51:28 2015 UTC,Facebook is the scum of the earth.
WikiLeaks,3drgmt,Walker-DBenjamin3_,4,Sat Jul 18 19:14:02 2015 UTC,Korean here. Indeed the shitstorm is brewing quite nicely at the moment.

WikiLeaks,3dinwe,samueledwardsknight,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:08:08 2015 UTC,What are the positives and negatives to this deal?
WikiLeaks,3dinwe,yanks43215,2,Thu Jul 16 20:25:29 2015 UTC,"It allows Iran to have a nuclear energy program which will be monitored at every step, which allows everyone to quickly know if they were going to build a bomb. The negative of this is that after the test express that would have the infrastructure to make a bomb.  They greatly reduce their number of centrifuges and reduces the level of enrichment they can have. On the downside they will still have a few, but their production would be monitored.  They would also have to get rid of some of their uranium, so they would probably sell it to Russia. On the plus side they have less uranium, on the down side they get a bunch of money."
WikiLeaks,3dinwe,bearswarm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:03:31 2015 UTC,Why does Iran need nuclear power? Are they not sitting on a load of oil that they have trouble exporting? Plus you haven't really heard much lobbying for the environment coming from their leadership.   It still seems disingenuous to say that using nuclear power for their people is the reason for this.
WikiLeaks,3dinwe,W31RD0,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:02:15 2015 UTC,You're completely right. At this point it seems the strategy is to get at nuke at 10+ years as opposed to <1 year. Maybe they figure that would get indefinite sanctions if they did. No clue.
WikiLeaks,3dinwe,bearswarm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:16:24 2015 UTC,"Well, a reasonable idea would be to sell the oil and natural gas Iran is sitting on instead of consuming it domestically. Develop and invest heavily in nuclear energy for domestic consumption. This would certainly benefit the regime in the long run."
WikiLeaks,3dinwe,TheMarraMan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:28:40 2015 UTC,But with sanctions on Iran the only real choice is to consume domestically.
WikiLeaks,3dinwe,W31RD0,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:38:11 2015 UTC,Which is why Iran wants the sanctions lifted. As well as a nuclear program.
WikiLeaks,3ddvsw,samueledwardsknight,3,Wed Jul 15 14:37:17 2015 UTC,"On Tuesday, shortly after details of the deal were released, Republicans attacked the President by claiming he left Moscow and Beijing with the ability to derail inspections...   The only reason to derail inspections would be to promote nuclear proliferation and incite a war. Quite frankly, it isn't China or Russia that I hear clamoring for another war these days."
WikiLeaks,3cyq2z,neapo,4,Sun Jul 12 00:07:02 2015 UTC,Got any links for it? Just wanted to show to family and friends still there.

WikiLeaks,3cluyt,samueledwardsknight,6,Wed Jul 8 22:35:36 2015 UTC,Don't worry - there is plenty of time to change the law.
WikiLeaks,3cluyt,elgraf,5,Thu Jul 9 07:11:34 2015 UTC,This is obviously a mistake. Obama promised us the most transparent administration ever.
WikiLeaks,3cluyt,SouthShoreBum,3,Thu Jul 9 12:11:36 2015 UTC,You know if we just assume the opposite of what all these traitors are saying it's a much more accurate picture.
WikiLeaks,3cng4b,rek2gnulinux,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:07:07 2015 UTC,Tbh we're way more likely to call them Mexican than Spanish.   Also don't generalize all Anglos. That's as racist as what you are describing.
WikiLeaks,3c5u72,Slobe_Global,7,Sun Jul 5 02:37:44 2015 UTC,"No justice for those that fight the power structure of this planet. One day assange will be viewed as a hero. I know he's a hero, no one is fighting for the people as he is. Keep giving the people the information they desearve to know, for this is suppose to be a free and open democratic society."
WikiLeaks,3c5u72,Rhader,3,Sun Jul 5 09:22:45 2015 UTC,Apparently no cares that it isn't. Or rather they just bitch instead of doing anything about it.
WikiLeaks,3c5u72,jpastore,3,Sun Jul 5 13:51:01 2015 UTC,"our society suffers from Stockholm syndrome, we are allowed to have toys to keep our attentions occupied/ distracted. take the toys away then all hell breaks loose"
