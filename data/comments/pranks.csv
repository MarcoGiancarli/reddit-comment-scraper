Watch her reaction on the second clip of sitting on the couch.  He is nearly in her peripheral vision and, besides still being afraid(?) of the clipper sound, she flings her head backwards to hit the wall.  The 4th clip, where she is cleaning under the table, with her head conveniently underneath the table, and she lightly bangs it while rubbing a washcloth over the same clean spot (bonus points for booty zoom out, though).  In the last clip, we see that she has had it, she is fed up, she is tired of the shenanigans, and (great idea) has to chase her man after still being scared of a gentle buzzing noise out of a phone.

pranks,36ertw,Obrysi,16,Mon May 18 20:41:44 2015 UTC,"They claim it is a prank and justify it by saying it raises awareness for this potential online dating risk. They further justify it by quoting 'fouseyTUBE', another YouTuber who pulled a similar stunt with the use of a fake gun.   Firstly, the victim in the video is clearly a man of low self-esteem. He has probably had no experience with a woman in his life as he arrives nervous, wearing what appears to be a cheap suit. He sees that the woman is very attractive and tells her he is a lawyer.  This is possibly his first match on Tinder, he is excited and has hopes of getting to know this seemingly nice girl.   He suspects something is wrong when she appears to undress him and have her way with him. When the 'boyfriend' enters, he is already trembling, terrified. The boyfriend makes it worse with threats, he then proceeds to rob him. He is extremely terrified.  This experience will surely hinder his ability to approach women in the future, as if it wasn't hard enough for him already.  Moreover, the stunt pulled by fouseyTUBE was most likely staged. If Trollsation wanted to promote awareness to 'honey trapping', they should have just made a sketch about how this could happen and not scar the mind of a poor, shop assistant.  Plus, they failed to blur the name of his employer out so no doubt this man named Jose will be located and mocked by people that know him. The humiliation these so called 'pranksters' put him through was excruciatingly cruel and evil."

My critique I have is to film the victims reactions as they are happening. The best part of pranks is seeing the reactions from people. Your video had none of that and instead focused on the actors.  When the teacher brings out a sex doll, show me how the couple reacts (not in interview), show their reactions at bad advice, or whether they question the techniques.  I would keep up with the pranks, you have potential."
pranks,34urda,uwill1der,1 point,Mon May 4 18:58:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback, man! Love the line about not getting beat up in the hood, haha.   I completely and 100% agree! As I was editing this, I was like ""damn, they didn't get any reactions at all!"", and I think it was because the camera operator on the mount was afraid of getting in frame of the one on a tripod getting that wider shot. So yeah, I do agree with you! Definitely something that bugs me.   That being said, we've got a new prank coming out tomorrow, very similar concept, and I'm pleased to tell you that before we shot it, I did tell the camera operator not to worry about getting in frame. We also positioned the room so that more faces could be seen.  Was the echo a problem for you? I haven't had anyone mention it, so maybe I'm just being picky on my end. Either way, we changed locations for tomorrow's video, and the new location had great acoustics.  Thank you again for the nice words and helpful feedback :) Definitely keeping it up! Hope you enjoy the new one!"

pranks,31z840,Volkodavy,4,Thu Apr 9 08:44:13 2015 UTC,"That is NOT a real piece of cat shit.  This is a prank I played on april fools on a roommate. The original prank was to make a cat hairball and make it look like one of my cats puked on his pillow, but I decided to just go a step more disgusting and make it look like cat shit.  What I did was I brushed one of my cats until I had a really good sized ball of hair. I rolled it in between my hands until it was in a sausage shape (the hair rolls up really tight the more you roll it and shape it). I decided that making a good hairball wasn't good enough, so I came up with the idea to make two smaller balls to look like pieces of shit. I took brown paper towel and wrapped it around the hair, and then wet it so it stuck to the ""hairballs"" and looked darker. Then I placed it in the bed.  It worked seamlessly, and he was so mad, thinking that he was going to have to wash all his sheets. I laughed my ass off, saved the ""shit"" and pulled the prank on my brother as well, it also worked seamlessly.  Give it a try lol"

pranks,313zti,ctothel,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:54:04 2015 UTC,"Apologies, I've been informed that this was not the clearest.   So I went to the dollar store the day before the 1st of April and was going to buy packing peanuts to stick in my roomie's purse, instead I bought two dog dishes, a dog toy, and tootsie rolls as I was inspired when I walked past them.   When I got home (roomie was out), I immediately took to Youtube and Reddit to try to find a recording of a dog scratching at a door and whining. Thankfully a user on /r/audioengineering chat helped me out big time and made me a recording to use.  I then found a 15 minutes completely silent Youtube video and put that on a track with the dog noises.   I hid the bowls, candy (now unwrapped and put into bowl to look like dog food and to act as an apology treat for an early wake up prank), and toy in my drawer and went to sleep.  Now in the morning, around 6AM, I set up dog stuff then I had to put my laptop and speakers in our storage closet and I woke her up with my fumbling. Luckily I managed to hide what I was doing with some bull story about finding something I had packed away and she went back to bed.  I then pressed play on my track and used the 15 minutes of silence to drive away to work where I would later receive a text from said roomie along the lines of, 'I hate you and hope you get pranked.' To which I replied, 'love you too.'  Eh voila! She later told me she didn't know where the dog noises were coming from initially and it took her awhile to find my laptop (which I had put a note on saying Happy April Fools'). Heheh."

And it looked very suspicious, since the dude has never even seen the girl before, and she's gonna ask a cop out?  Of all the people everywhere there.  I'd be like wtf is up with this girl."
pranks,2uggvc,Anitor,5,Mon Feb 2 14:37:43 2015 UTC,"The officers should be reported. It is not illegal to record police officers, it's a constitutional right."
pranks,2uggvc,wrathofkhat,3,Sun Feb 1 23:45:12 2015 UTC,It's also not illegal for officers to lie to people.
pranks,2uggvc,Anitor,1 point,Mon Feb 2 06:26:17 2015 UTC,"Correct, but they stated they were being detained. You can not be detained unless you commit a crime."
pranks,2uggvc,wrathofkhat,5,Mon Feb 2 07:10:54 2015 UTC,"Sure you can. What do you think leads up to arrest? A traffic stop is a great example. If they suspect you're driving drunk, they detain you, whether you actually did it or not. The detainment, aka traffic stop, is where they determine whether or not you actually did commit a crime. They can detain pretty much whoever they damn well please if they have any reason whatsoever. Detainment just means they've stopped you so they can ask you some questions."
pranks,2uggvc,Anitor,2,Mon Feb 2 16:22:56 2015 UTC,"yes, but to be detained they have to suspect that you committed a crime. The crime they are accusing them of is recording them."
pranks,2uggvc,wrathofkhat,2,Mon Feb 2 18:24:17 2015 UTC,"That doesn't necessarily have to be what they'd put down ""on the record"" as their reason for detaining, though. They can stretch almost anything at all to be a reason for detainment. They could simply say they suspected the people were up to no good (in more police-y terms, of course) and then once they had them detained they confronted them about the recording. Would this happen in an ideal, totally ethical world? No, but there's no way these cops would realistically face any punishment for this."
pranks,2uggvc,Anitor,1 point,Mon Feb 2 21:05:17 2015 UTC,It's not about punishing them. Just cause it's something small doesn't mean that you should just let it slide.
pranks,2uggvc,wrathofkhat,1 point,Mon Feb 2 22:16:10 2015 UTC,"Let me rephrase: there's no way these cops would be found to be guilty of wrongdoing in any formal proceedings, so saying ""these cops should be reported"" is kind of silly."
