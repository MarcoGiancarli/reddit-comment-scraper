Dota2Modding,3e0otr,Tramp_CN,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:35:46 2015 UTC,speaking of launch options is there a way for us to see what all the possible launch options are?
Dota2Modding,3dzptd,contrasttx,2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:43 2015 UTC,"While I don't know if or how they work with DotA 2, there are two triggers for this: 'trigger_changelevel' and 'trigger_transition'.  Hope this helps a bit"

Dota2Modding,3dzptd,Rubician,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:37:11 2015 UTC,You mean like forcing all players to go to a loading screen to spawn them on a newly loaded map?

Dota2Modding,3dvkyo,Putnam3145,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:04:10 2015 UTC,"The fetching of the numbers for display purposes is done on the client side. You're setting fields on the ability object in lua and returning them later. However, OnCreated is only run on the server side, not on the client side. Thus, on the client, these fields are nil and thus the client will not display the bonuses.  (This is also why OnIntervalThink is running twice for you; once on server, once on client. The client has access to much less stuff. Use IsServer() to differentiate the two.)"
