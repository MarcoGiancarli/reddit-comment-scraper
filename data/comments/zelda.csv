zelda,3duknt,ZobmieRules,65,Sun Jul 19 17:52:36 2015 UTC,"As others have said, I think the two shields was because I saved and quit in the fishing area, when I restarted I was in the temple of time with the two shields.   But I actually had a double layer glitch going on. I think it started because my son sprayed me with a hose while I was playing on my porch and a little water got into where the cartridge goes. I think that put my game into a weird state where the B button wouldn't work. I noticed this when I went into the fishing area and found I couldn't cast at all, and the b button display on the bottom screen was greyed out.  I saved and quit right then, thinking a restart would fix it. Restarted put me into the two shields state which had me even more confused. Restarting again removed the two shields, but left me in a state where the B button wouldn't work for the master sword. I could do other things, like shoot the bow from the horse with B, but I couldn't in any way pull out the master sword.  After playing around with different things trying to fix it I found that I could use the kokiri sword as a child, but nothing I did would allow me to use the master sword. My last ditch effort was to work my way through the biggoron quest hoping that having a second sword to switch to on the gear screen would do something. All of this happened after I had beaten the forest temple but nothing else, so I had to work my way through the ice cavern enough to get blue fire. That was a fun exercise in using the bow and hookshot to fight things I've never thought to fight that way before :p   Happily, switching to the biggoron sword cleared up whatever weird state my save was in and now I can use both swords fine. But it was an exciting evening working through that wondering if my save would inevitably be toast :)  Sadly there wasn't really anything visually interesting about the locked sword, so I just posted the picture of the double shield."

It is a glitch that allows you to write to specific memory addresses while the game is running, effectively adding or removing inventory items, including spiritual stones, medallions, bomb bag, quiver, strength upgrades, and pieces of heart.  The glitch centers around getting a Bottle on B. One of the ways this can be accomplished involved stealing the fishing rod (through another glitch) though I do not know if that particular method of RBA is still possible or even effective on the 3ds version.

I struggled quite a bit with Zelda 1 as well, but Zelda 2 certainly was infuriatingly difficult.  If you don't want to include those, I'm not sure what the hardest for me was.

For example, the first event in the entire timeline is the creation of the world, which is touched on by Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess, and A Link to the Past. But the first game in the timeline doesn't mention the creation of the world at all.  On top of that, the guy in charge of the Zelda series has said that he really likes it when fans try to figure out the timeline for themselves, so you probably shouldn't tie yourself to a preconception of the timeline. You should play the games as they become available to you and figure out how it fits together based on your playthroughs. Many of the games mention different events that take place in the timeline in-between the various games, and it's up to you to figure out how they fit in with the games.  Personally, I think Ocarina of Time is probably the best starting place because, as I mentioned previously, it does touch on the very beginning of the timeline with the creation of the world, it's one of the most traditional 3-D Zelda games, so it'll give you a good idea of what's to come in later 3-D Zelda games, and Ocarina of Time is the game that more games refer back to than any other in the series, so it's good to play it relatively early on."

zelda,3dt7ei,RennyMisaki,2,Sun Jul 19 05:38:54 2015 UTC,"Alright here me out. The reason why the gods flooded Hyrule (as compared to any number of ways that they could have sealed Ganon) was because Nayru was jealous of the other goddesses. Let me elaborate. In Ocarina of Time we have 6 Temples, at least 4 of which look like they might actually be used for worship. The temples are themed for elements as opposed to specific gods, and it's easy to see how multiple gods could be worshipped at each temple. In the Wind Waker, however, we see that at some point between Ocarina and the Great Flood, the Master Sword was imbued with power at exactly two temples - the Earth Temple and the Wind Temple. The people began praying at only these two temples. The Wind God(dess) is quite obviously Farore. The warp spell in Ocarina is Farore's Wind, the Ocarina Forest Temple was originally a Wind Temple, the forest being characterized as green along with Farore, and Fado is a Kokiri. In the cutscene where you get the Kokiri Emerald, the Deku Tree says that Din created the ""red earth"" and had ""flaming arms""; furthermore, the fire spell is Din's Fire. The Fire Temple is on Death Mountain, which is, of course, rocky - fire and earth elements are often combined in Zelda. From this we can conclude that Din is the Earth God (as for Laruto being a Zora, I postulate that they took over the role of Din's patron race at the same time that they moved to Death Mountain, possibly at the same time that the Gorons died out. In either case it must have been before the Flood, otherwise the Zora would have simply died in the salt water). This means that Nayru was, for whatever reason, not worshipped. It's only fitting, therefore, that she punished the world with water. For more evidence, Skyward Sword is set in a world where the people live above the monsters, after the world inhabited by monsters was sealed away by the gods - so why would they seperate the world with the sky one time and water another?  EDIT: If this isn't obvious already, Nayru is obviously the patron diety of water. The design on her pearl is exactly the same as the Zora symbol. While the Ruto, who worship the Sky Spirit, Valoo, in the Wind Waker, also use this same symbol - I propose that they kept it and passed it that way, while Jabu Jabu, the ancestor of Jabun, who has Nayru's Pearl, passed the design HIS way as well, him being the protector of the Zora and all."

zelda,3dt7ei,raazurin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:30:15 2015 UTC,"One theory I've been thinking about is the placement of Zelda wii u,  on the timeline.  I only care about this because of where I think it stands and then what we can pull game play wise and story wise from it.   In every thing we have seen about ""link""  is that he is wearing a blue tunic instead of his standard green. Is this because he's being chased but the robots we see in the first trailer? I doubt it, they still find him a mile away and I doubt he would change his iconic outfit for that.  Maybe it doesn't exist yet.. What if this games appears before the events of skyward sword, where the tunic came to be.  Also more proof for this, the sail cloth, when you recieved it from zelda, she tells you it's made to look like the one a hero of the pervious world used. In the trailer we see an identical one being used. Plus it was almost the only item shown, why not the hookshot? Why not a fire rod? Why not anythung far more iconic? I'll address this later.   Now I wanna talk about the fact that one of the game designers said ""no one said this is link"".  Could it be because it's not? Could it be links ""demise""? Could it be the original hero links soul came from? In a similar manner to how demise reincarnated himself many times as Gannon and not himself directly.  My thoughts are the gods reincarnated this man's soul after his actions in this game over snd over to be the hero of courage who watches over the world for them. It was said that the link from skyward sword was the first link, so maybe this isn't link..   I wanna talk about the lands we see in both videos, this will be a short topic with an almost definite prediction. The land we see has lots of tall cliffs and hills, there looks to be a huge focus on z axis movement, like the player will spend much of their time scaling and jumping off cliffs.   Now that we talked a little about these points let's try and figure out a few more things from this.    this game could be the earliest in the time line.  This could be the first hero.  Sail cloth.    Possible Answers    If the game is the earliest in the timeline then this could mean anything, from the creation of the shekiah or even the triforce,  we could see anything when it comes to story.  We will have to wait for more for this sadly. If this is the first hero he probably won't have much help from the royal family, or sheikah.  He will have to prove himself accordingly to any and all factions having no lineage of hero's before him.  The player will have a huge focus on scaling and decending the cliffs and hills and mountain. The player will probably will have to use the sail cloth to reach secret and hidden areas on cliffs, there will probably be at least one heart piece on the side of a cliff that you will need the sail cloth to obtain.    That's all I have for now, please expand on my thoughts.  I'd love to see what you guys think."

So people are crucified(again, not literaly), even when they don't hate on Oot, but just like Majora's Mask, or any other game, more than OoT.  And nothing, not even the amount of stuff OoT brought to gaming, gives people the right to act like this to people who just like another game more."
zelda,3du25j,malaroo,3,Sun Jul 19 19:39:40 2015 UTC,"You'll find the same with any popular game, though.  It isn't just OoT, but OoT happens to be one of the most popular and acclaimed games ever.  It isn't just games, either.  Go to a forum/sub about cars, and try to say you like the 2015 Mustang more than the '67.  It's just how overly defensive people treat their opinions, and you'll find a lot of it when talking about something immensely popular."

zelda,3du25j,malaroo,2,Sun Jul 19 19:49:51 2015 UTC,"School is a lot smaller of a sample group than the internet.  Go on a Football forum, and say you hate someone popular pertaining to it.  The same will happen.  'Sides, people are less likely to talk shit if you're not interested in the medium to begin with.  Someone who doesn't care for games will probably be met with the same lack-of-caring about their opinion.  However if you say you're a huge football fan, and then hate on something universally loved in football, you'll probably catch some heat."
zelda,3du25j,LostDeku,-2,Sun Jul 19 19:55:29 2015 UTC,"But going to a football forum and saying I hate football is NOT the same situation as here.  Because I like Legend of Zelda, just not OoT. What are you gonna do about it? Take my fan membership away? Oh wait. That shit doesn't exist.  This fandom needs to learn to accept other opinions, because not liking OoT seems to be the equivalent of murder, but of gaming."
zelda,3du25j,malaroo,2,Sun Jul 19 19:57:38 2015 UTC,"But going to a football forum and saying I hate football is NOT the same situation as here.   That's not what I said.  I said that you'll catch heat if you say you're a football fan (like you are a Zelda fan) and then hate on something popular about it (like Ocarina of Time).  But if you say ""I don't really care about football"" people probably won't care that you don't care, as there would be no point, because you don't care in the first place.  Not caring about a general form of entertainment is different from talking down to something specific about it; something popular.   This fandom needs to learn to accept other opinions,   All fandoms are like that.  It's not specific to Zelda, or games in general.  Most people aren't mature enough accept an opinion that they don't agree with.  It's just how people are.  Worrying about it will gain you nothing, because people are never going to change."

Being a fan of something isn't like a job. I don't have to do a college and understand certain things to be a fan. No. Get a game, press play, and if you like it: Bam. Fan.  OoT's situation is getting even worse than Genwunners, and that's saying something."

My side: ""We are allowed to have a different opinion""  It's not the same thing. I just want the right to have an opinion, which doesn't seem to be a thing here."

For most people, Ocarina of Time is the goal to reach. From most people's perspective (and I'm not on a high horse, its mine too) if you don't like this top Zelda game, can you really call yourself a Zelda fan?"

Wind Waker and Twilight Princess are newer, and also very good, but they come from a time when Zelda was trying to change itself up, so maybe save them for later if you're looking to start from a reasonable ""beginning"" area.

zelda,3dq6yl,YerrytheYanitor,5,Sat Jul 18 18:24:57 2015 UTC,My personal opinion is either Ocarina of Time or Twilight Princess. I've never played Link to the Past but apparently people like it. When I think of The Zelda franchise I think of those two games the most.
zelda,3dq6yl,Ugybug1900,3,Sat Jul 18 20:00:44 2015 UTC,"Oracle of seasons and oracle of ages both are fun, good handheld games. If you have a 3ds (or access to the Nintendo store on a DS) you can buy me for about $4 or $5 each.  Of course Ocarina of Time is a must! So that game first and then the others.  I love Minish cap too!"
zelda,3dq6yl,LazyTits127,4,Sat Jul 18 16:24:42 2015 UTC,"Many people call Ocarina of Time not just the best Zelda game, but one of the best games ever made. It's a perfect starting point for getting into the series."
zelda,3dq6yl,lapis-lazuli,6,Sat Jul 18 20:04:36 2015 UTC,"I'd say if you were going to play a Zelda game for the first time, The Wind Waker is a great starting point. It's artstyle and dialogue, as well as puzzles and combat, make for a great game.  If I had to suggest a 2D Zelda my personal favorite and go-to Zelda game is A Link Between Worlds. Both of these games are on Nintendo's current systems and are great games"
zelda,3dq6yl,CarsThatDrive,3,Sat Jul 18 15:20:17 2015 UTC,"I think you can appreciate Wind Waker more after playing OoT first, but that probably works both ways."
zelda,3dq6yl,Jrodkin,3,Sat Jul 18 15:31:41 2015 UTC,"Ocarina of Time is my personal favorite.   Its cool to play Link as child and adult.  Story is quite typical for Zelda game but it has nice nuances, Zelda has quite active role on it and many more interesting characters are presented.  Story doesn't present Link and Zelda as ""perfect people"", but they make mistakes, even fatal ones. I won't spoil it but this in my opinion added good layer of depth to their characters.  Link is cute. Sorry."
zelda,3dq6yl,Xinotine,3,Sat Jul 18 18:39:40 2015 UTC,General rule of thumb with people's opinions seems to be:  If you want to play in a 3D space? Ocarina of time If you want 2D? Link to the past  In terms of games you can skip? Probably phantom hourglass and Spirit tracks.
zelda,3dq6yl,Snobolt,3,Sat Jul 18 23:02:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly the cool thing about Zelda is you can jump in just about anywhere. I'd recommend picking whatever looks interesting and is on a platform you have. Some prefer the whimsical world of Wind Waker (alliteration!). Others prefer the quirkiness and underlying melancholy of Link's Awakening, or the unsettling Majora's Mask. It's really up to you.   However, a few games are best played after others. Don't play Majora until you've played Ocarina. Don't play the NES games until you've played at least one other 2D Zelda. You can jump into Skyward Sword or the DS games right away, but they're kind of different and not always representative of Zelda games in general, so that's up to you.   If you want a recent game that encapsulates everything great about the series, you can't go wrong with A Link Between Worlds."
zelda,3dq6yl,octobutts,3,Sat Jul 18 23:41:49 2015 UTC,"I'll run through the list real fast, including what systems they're on. VC = Virtual Console  The Legend of Zelda (NES, GBA, Wii VC, 3DS VC, Wii U VC): Classic, but very hard to go back to as a new player. Almost no story whatsoever; can be skipped.  Zelda II (NES, GBA, Wii/3DS/WiiU VC): Pretty much the same as above.  A Link to the Past (SNES, GBA, Wii/WiiU VC): The first great timeless Zelda game. Highly recommended, good starting point.  Link's Awakening (GB, GBC, 3DS VC): A great game, heavily inspired by A Link to the Past. Technically skippable though, since it's a side story with no impact on the universe.  Ocarina of Time (N64, GameCube, Wii VC, 3DS): Usually cited as THE Zelda game. If you only play one Zelda game ever, I feel like it should be this one. Great story, great gameplay, and has a huge impact on every game that follows it. Can't be skipped whatsoever.  Story note: takes place before all other previous Zelda games to this point.  Technical Note: the N64 and Wii VC versions are identical, but the GameCube port runs at a higher resolution, and the 3DS version is a graphically overhauled version that runs at a lower res. My personal favorite is the GameCube port, but a lot of people say the 3DS version is the new standard.  Majora's Mask (N64, GameCube, Wii VC, 3DS): A very different, very bizarre Zelda game. Frustrated many fans but others love it. While it is a home console Zelda game and a chronological sequel to Ocarina, it is a skippable side story.  Note: like Ocarina, the N64 and VC versions are the same, but Majora's GameCube port has a sound glitch, and the 3DS version is a more full remake that fixes some problems in the N64 release as well as looking prettier. The 3DS is definitely the best version here.  Oracle of Ages & Oracle of Seasons (GBC, 3DS VC): Good stuff along the lines of Link's Awakening, but can be skipped.  The Wind Waker (GameCube, Wii U): One of the best Zelda games, up there with A Link to the Past and Ocarina. Don't let the art style fool you; this is as serious and amazing as Zelda gets. A must-play, but be sure you play Ocarina first, as it sets up TWW's entire backstory.  Note: Wii U version is an HD upgrade with a different visual style and some slight gameplay enhancements  Twilight Princess (GameCube, Wii): The first main Zelda game that was considered by many to be a disappointment. Not nearly as good as the previous console Zeldas, but still good, and still definitely recommended.  Note: the GameCube version is the ""original"" version of the game, while the Wii version is a port that uses motion controls and mirrors the entire game world from left to right so that Link is seen holding his sword in his right hand. The Wii version runs in widescreen, however, so it's perhaps a little prettier. I still vastly prefer the GameCube version overall, however.  The Minish Cap (GBA, Wii U VC): Skippable side story. Good, though.  Phantom Hourglass (DS): A direct sequel to The Wind Waker, which is neat. Frustrating touch-screen-only controls, however. There's a good game in there somewhere, but it's hard to find. Skippable.  Spirit Tracks (DS): A gameplay sequel to Phantom Hourglass, but not a story sequel, really. Still has touch screen controls. Skippable.  Skyward Sword (Wii): A mainline Zelda game that goes back to the beginning and sets up the entire Zelda universe as we know it. From a story perspective, it's absolutely a must-play. The gameplay is less good. Stiff, outdated gameplay and motion controls that don't always work as they should. Also almost completely throws aside the overworld exploration aspect of Zelda. It is pretty gorgeous, though, and the orchestrated music is fantastic. Recommended as a must-play with the qualifier that it can get a little frustrating at times.  A Link Between Worlds (3DS): A sequel to A Link to the Past. Absolutely fantastic. Tons of fun and plays with Zelda gameplay conventions in really interesting ways. Skippable, but I'd highly recommend it anyway.  TL;DR:  Start with either A Link to the Past or Ocarina of Time, then after Ocarina, go ahead and play The Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword in order to get the larger story. (come back here and ask questions if the timeline gets confusing) Play any of the other games along the way if they strike your fancy as well."

It tries to be the most epic Zelda game of all time, but has a lot of really repetitive, unimaginative, and frustratingly boring aspects that make it fall short. Even the game's creators said they failed to do what they were trying to do with TP. I bought it on launch day in 2006 and was more than a little bit disappointed."
zelda,3dq6yl,Supernintendolover,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:50:50 2015 UTC,Ah i see. Is the gane still worth getting? I have seen gameplay and i really like the look of it so far.
zelda,3dq6yl,EchoLeader1,2,Mon Jul 20 22:21:29 2015 UTC,"If you're a big Zelda fan then yes, absolutely. I still count it as a must-play for Zelda fans; it's way too important not to play. Try and get the GameCube version if you can, but the Wii one will suffice if need be."
zelda,3dq6yl,Supernintendolover,2,Tue Jul 21 00:50:30 2015 UTC,Great! I'll definitely give it a go!
zelda,3dq6yl,ilovecosmo,5,Tue Jul 21 10:22:23 2015 UTC,"A Link Between Worlds is, in my opinion, the best top-down Zelda. It's a very very good game. I think that A Link to the Past is pretty overrated. I don't really want to spoil anything, but ALBW controls better, is truly open-world (unlike ALttP where you mostly have to do things in a set order), has much more memorable characters, much better looking and sounding, ugh just all-in-all I love it <3  For a 3D Zelda, Majora's Mask is amazing but definitely not easy to get into for a new-comer. I would probably recommend Ocarina of Time. Wind Waker is also great, but Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword are not very good games.."

zelda,3dq6yl,vonDriessen,2,Sun Jul 19 21:10:32 2015 UTC,"It really just depends on how far back you're willing to go and what system you want to play on.  But to answer the question of which ones do you really need to play, ocarina of time is widely considered to be one of the greatest games of all time.  It would be an excellent starting point."
zelda,3dq6yl,killthealias,2,Sat Jul 18 20:42:04 2015 UTC,"Zelda games don't have any order they're meant to be played in, none of the previous games are needed to understand the new ones. The best one to start with is whichever one interests you the most. A lot of people say Ocarina of Time is the best, my favourite is The Wind Waker. It's up to you which one you start with."
zelda,3dq6yl,bardicfury,2,Sat Jul 18 23:46:08 2015 UTC,"My first Zelda game was Spirit Tracks, I only started playing Zelda midway through last year.  My second was Ocarina of Time.  Twilight Princess was my third and it was also really good.  Itching to play Windwaker. I really like them all so far! I think all Zelda games are pretty good. Just choose one that appeals to you.  Spirit Tracks for example has a reputation for being a bad zelda game. To me it was awesome, really fun design, cool puzzles, fun boss fights, a real nice DS game.  I really want to play A Link Between Worlds though, the point and click style of spirit tracks isn't bad at all but I prefer using 3DS controls."
zelda,3dq6yl,BebesPC,2,Sun Jul 19 08:36:14 2015 UTC,"I would definitely pick up Ocarina of Time 3DS as I feel it is the definitive version and it also includes Master Quest. If you want a longer game I would choose Twilight Princess but it can drag on a little in the beginning. I would say play Minish Cap if you have a handheld as even though its short it improves on a lot of things from the Oracle Games.   Majora's Mask is my favourite but it can be very hard to get into and as it's a sequel to Ocarina I would play it after that. Wind Waker (HD)  should be played before both Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks as they are both sequels to that game and I would buy both Oracle games so you can link them up (Seasons first, then Ages.)  I don't really think you should avoid any Zelda game except the CDI games, but Zelda 2: Adventure of Link is very different and very very hard and I gave up after the first dungeon. Unless you have friends I would also avoid the GBA version of Four Swords as you need other copies of the game to play it.  I hope you enjoy playing them!"

Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask are significantly improved on 3DS (mostly graphically).  Wind Waker HD on Wii U is definitly the best. I can't really think of an instance where the Latest version is not best.  Other than the games that were remade (OoT, MM, WW) it's all really about availability. I will not list the ones with only one release.  Regarding Twilight Princess, nothing is wrong with the Wii version and you will save yourself a lot of money by going for that one instead of the Gamecube one."
zelda,3dqc5u,Mr_Olivar,3,Sat Jul 18 14:07:36 2015 UTC,"I would also say that, because the motion controls are annoying and the whole map is flipped, the Gamecube version of Twilight Princess is better."
zelda,3dqc5u,LostDeku,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:16:08 2015 UTC,"that comes down to opinion really. Map flipping does not matter for a new player, flicking your wrist to swing your sword is not a problem for a lot of people, and widescreen and point aiming is great.  So opinions opinions"

zelda,3dqc5u,Fonethree,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:15:11 2015 UTC,"This is just my opinion, but I can't stand to play classic games on HD screens. Something just feels off about it. The colors and textures just don't ""blend"" right like they would on a tube tv. I've been trying to replay a ton of classic games, so I think I'm gonna buy the oldest, blurriest tv I can."
zelda,3dqc5u,Nunbarsheguna,5,Sun Jul 19 07:05:02 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to the people who tell you that you have to get the Gamecube version of Twilight Princess. The GC version is pretty rare and will likely cost you a lot of money, and the Wii version is at least as good, perhaps even a little better thanks to the wiimote aiming for the bow/hookshot.  Just remember that there's no need to stand up and swing the wiimote around like you're playing tennis, lol. Little flicks will do!"
zelda,3dqc5u,infidelirium,6,Sat Jul 18 13:40:59 2015 UTC,"I have a couple concerns with the Wii version, and yes, the controls are a significant factor to me. The game was built around GameCube controls and late in development the Wii controls were tacked on top. Combat is awkward by comparison, which is SO SAD, because combat in TP was the most satisfying in the series until SS. Speaking of SS - clearly motion controls can be done right with enough precision, but the TP controls did not have Wii Motion+. This means that simple gestures are simply in-place substitutions for button presses. It's unsatisfying and unnecessary.  The other issue is the complete flipping of the game world. It might not bother me so much if it weren't for such an unneeded change (as the combat wasn't improved on, and was in fact hindered, by using the Wii remote to sword fight). But even still, the GC version is the definitive version because of the map. The Wii version disagrees with the established overall topography of Hyrule.  There's also more minor issues that I don't bring up usually because I'm unsure of how strongly they're influenced by my own familiarity with the GameCube version. I feel as though the layout of the dungeons and corridors and such feel more intentional in the GameCube version. The eye is directed toward important features and navigation feels more natural. But again, that could easily be because of my history with the GameCube."
zelda,3dqc5u,Fonethree,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:10:36 2015 UTC,"I've been reading about this argument about the Wii vs GameCube version for a long time now, and I always thought it was just subjective. I've never seen or played the GC version, but I played it on the Wii. I'm just throwing this out there about the map flip. Everyrime is be in the hyrile overworld I would get so disoriented with where I was going. I wonder if it has anything to do with the maP flip"
zelda,3dqc5u,Nunbarsheguna,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:11:13 2015 UTC,"pluses with the Wii version: fantastic aiming, widescreen support, slightly better graphics (very sligtly).  The map flip and the sword slashing is really down to opinion, there is no correct answer wether which are better or worse, but if you come straight out of Super Mario Galaxy, and are used to slight flicks on the controller as a replacement for a button press, it is not big deal at all, it's basically the same then.  Also, i would like to know these minor issues you talk about, and the dungeon orientation thing you said makes no sense to me since mirroring does not change what is one screen, it only changes if it is in the left direction, or the right direction."
zelda,3dqc5u,Mr_Olivar,2,Sat Jul 18 14:39:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I disagree about the map. I can see how someone might not be hindered by sword slashing being a wrist flick instead of a button press, but I don't see how an inversion of the game world is really that opinion-based. There's a correct orientation, and then there's the one they had to use for the Wii.  I'm really not sure what it is about the dungeons and corridors. As I said, it's possibly just my pre-existing knowledge conflicting with the Wii world, causing me to run into walls, etc. But I constantly have that issue when I try to play the Wii version. Everything feels out of place."
zelda,3dqc5u,Fonethree,0,Sat Jul 18 18:38:15 2015 UTC,"i personally could not give two shits about which direction map is, i mean, i'm used to the Wii map, so i'm biased towards it when playing. But if i was to pick one without experience, it would not matter.  When talking about lore stuff and doing stuff that would require the use of the TP map outside of actually playing the game, i use the GC one ofc."

zelda,3dqc5u,TheMetaMoss,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:56:38 2015 UTC,Read the post. OP's looking for the best version of each Zelda.
zelda,3dqc5u,TheMetaMoss,0,Tue Jul 21 07:17:40 2015 UTC,"I can address the console games. Not a fan of the mobile ones so I'm unfamiliar with remakes / versions for those.  LoZ - My favorite is probably the version included in the Collector's Edition for GCN, because of the ability to use a normal controller. Emulator might edge it out.  AoL - Same answer as LoZ  LttP - I enjoy bringing out the SNES for this one. Emulator is also a good choice.  EDIT - Virtual Console is a very good choice for the above three titles.  OoT - Either of the GCN releases (Collector's Edition or Master Quest - definitely MQ if you think you'll like the challenge though). Updated graphics make a big difference IMO. Not quite worth the trouble of emulating in some cases, but that's up to your computer / legal worries / etc. If you want it mobile, OoT 3D has its benefits, but I'm a purist personally.  MM - Again, probably Collector's Edition or emulator. Not that there's anything wrong with the N64 version if that's more accessible. Same deal with 3D as OoT.  WW - Definitely choose WWHD for WiiU if you have access. Minor changes but so worth it. Honestly native widescreen support might be worth it in itself, but it also changes gameplay elements to just make a better game overall.  TP - No question. Gamecube. Do not get the Wii version. Blech. EDIT - I had no idea the GCN version was so expensive. If you can borrow it, I'd do so, but the changes probably aren't super important to someone new to the series.  SS - Only one version, Wii."
zelda,3dqc5u,Fonethree,2,Tue Jul 21 16:25:13 2015 UTC,"Lemme add a reminder and say that the Collector's Edition version of MM on GCN is a little buggy. It's prone to crashing which can get very infuriating since the game's save system is a little odd. I'd recommend either the Virtual Console releases or the 3DS version (assuming one is lacking an N64.) Especially the 3DS version for someone who is new, the game is much more streamlined and accessible (the save system/time travel mechanic is easier to deal with.) Though hey, the first time I beat MM was with the Collector's Edition, just gotta waft  through the crashes (eventually they just stopped for me.)"
zelda,3dqc5u,urmom8mydog,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:05:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah the collectors edition of MM is the only version I would not recommend. The crashing with that games save system makes it basically unplayable.  I'd recommend 3ds but the n64 one is decent too, but you need the expansion pack, and the game might be really expensive i forget  The wii TP is totally fine too"

RNG is used in code to determine certain things in games, like after you kill an enemy which way will the coins come out and how far will they fly out? If you're collecting coins, this RNG affects you. A very common example is where an AI will move. If they move towards you you'll be able to kill them sooner.   Sometimes runners talk about the horrible RNG they're having. It's a popular term in the community."

Everything is mirrored (Link is right handed, overworld map and other areas are flipped, etc) as I'm sure you know, but the dungeons are different too. It feels like a completely different, exactly the same, game. (If that makes sense.)   I'm only at Jabu-Jabu right now and I've noticed some more minor changes to each of the first three child dungeons, but my friend beat it and said that the Fire Temple is entirely different and was as frustrating as OG Water Temple, whereas the Water Temple was made to be much simpler as a bit of a laugh for veteran players. It really is a great design and I can't wait to push to finish it. I've been limited by grad school work which finally ends this week so I finally have some of that mysterious hidden treasure the kids call ""free time""."

zelda,3di5rx,Ayesuku,99,Fri Jul 17 01:07:07 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, man.  As much as other games have improved other areas in the series, in my opinion none have done atmosphere better than Ocarina of Time (and MM).  While Wind Waker's final sequence is my actual favorite (when it comes to gameplay and writing) nothing tops the mood in OoT's final showdown.  It's just like you said.  I remember thinking as a kid how amazing the castle collapsing on itself looked haha."
zelda,3di5rx,malaroo,19,Thu Jul 16 13:57:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the writing of tWW's final sequence, but not the gameplay. To this very day, I don't know the strategy to beating Ganondorf, even though I've beaten the game at least half a dozen times: I just make a bunch of blind slashes, and hope one of them connects, and of course I use a parry when the prompt appears. And I have enough fairies, etc with me at that point that I never die before beating him. I feel like I'm brute-forcing the fight each time and winning without knowing how, and that just isn't very fun to me, personally."
zelda,3di5rx,xwatchmanx,14,Thu Jul 16 17:18:59 2015 UTC,"There is a strategy, but you can also brute-force it if you want.  Depending on whatever stance he's making, and how far you've progressed into the fight, attacking him will cause him to react differently.  IIRC, the first part is just a one-on-one basic sword fight.  Then, after he starts guarding your attacks, you have to just keep him distracted and angle him so that Zelda can hit him in the back/sides with the light arrows.  Once he knocks out Zelda, he will guard every attack you try, unless you just keep attacking him constantly which coaxes him to try and counter-attack, at which point you can evade and move in for some swings, or use the parry.  I can usually beat him without getting hit nowadays.  Wind Waker has some pretty cool combos if you put a small amount of time in to practice them.  For example, if you do the instant-spin attack (circle with the analog stick and then press B) while you're mid-air from a jump attack (Z target and A), Link will immediately use the spin attack upon touching the ground, essentially combining the two attacks.  If you throw a few basic B swings between these, you can get a combo going that's so good even Orca won't have a chance to attack back.  I managed to get 999 hits on him without getting hit myself using that combo.  I hope combat like that returns in Zelda U, but with maybe a bit more depth and less 'cartoon' flashiness.  The parry-roll often looked pretty silly with how big of a circle Link made while rolling around the enemies."
zelda,3di5rx,malaroo,6,Thu Jul 16 17:50:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I wasn't clear: I understand the strategy involving the light arrows, etc.: It's the raw swordfighting sequences of the fight that I have trouble figuring out.  Anyway, thanks for the explanation. And those combos sound super cool. I never knew you could do that. I'll put that to the test next time I decide to play tWW HD on hero mode without deaths (I still haven't done that yet)."
zelda,3di5rx,xwatchmanx,3,Thu Jul 16 17:54:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, my bad.  The sword fighting is mostly just reactionary combat aside from the few tricks pertaining to how Ganondorf reacts to certain things.  I'd have to start up the game and pay attention to his animations to get really specific, but it's mostly just what I said before.  Definitely try out those combos.  The jump attack/spin attack combo is definitely the hardest-hitting thing in the game, aside from possibly the Skull Hammer, but I haven't tested them against each other.  I'd wager that the combo has a chance to do more damage, especially considering how fast it can be done.  Also, because they run off of essentially the same engine, that combo also works in Twilight Princess.  However it's much less useful and more difficult to consistently pull of, due to TP's slower attack animations."
zelda,3di5rx,malaroo,2,Thu Jul 16 18:04:41 2015 UTC,I managed to get 999 hits on him without getting hit myself using that combo.   What.  WHAT.  Are you telling me that my hours of frustration as a child fighting Orca could've been avoided with this technique?
zelda,3di5rx,Enraric,8,Thu Jul 16 23:40:39 2015 UTC,"unfortunately, it is pretty easy to just mash your way through that fight. but the correct timing and strategy do exist, it just takes a little patience to figure it out. my last few playthroughs, i've finished he last fight without getting hit once. correct blocking is the key."

They weren't afraid to just show the place flat out dead once you arrive. A ruined tower, dead trees, redeads in Hyrule Town.   They wanted you to know that Ganondorf meant business, and it shows from how his influence spread across the land. Frozen Zora, Goron's locked away to be eaten by a dragon, it wasn't in your face ""I'm so evil"" through dialogue or blatant violent acts and gore shoved in the players face, but subtle ways in showing how Ganondorf really makes Hyrule a terrible place in the future."
zelda,3di5rx,Butter_Is_Life,15,Thu Jul 16 17:47:05 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, except I never used light arrows. It was annoying because I'd always run out of magic and not be able to get more so I'd just roll between his legs and hit the tail like that."

zelda,3di5rx,aheadwarp9,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:11:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but when I was younger and playing this game I wasn't very good at it, so Ganon would destroy all the pillars and I'd still hadn't killed him.

I've found that using the light arrows, at least in my memory, stuns him for a pretty long time... not like a ridiculous amount, but certainly enough for you to quickly move behind him and start attacking the tail.  If you miss your first couple attacks though, then you will probably run out of stun time.  All this talk is making me want to go back and replay OOT again now :P"

zelda,3di5rx,DNolc,7,Thu Jul 16 18:11:12 2015 UTC,"My sentiments are pretty similar for OOT's final fight, but for slightly different reasons.  I actually disliked most of OOT as there were many parts where I felt it punished you for lack of exploration rather than reward for taking the time for said exploration. There were multiple times where I felt ""wtf do I do now?"" and no matter of looking actually helped me and I had to google it. That being said most of boss fights in this game are great and where it really shines to me.  Final boss. Ganondorf. Do the sword deflect magic game. Finally get him. Grab Zelda and run out the building. This is the first time in any game I've played where they put something behind ""you saved the princess. grat jorb"" and you actually had to get out of there. Then the sequence you mentioned. Zelda steps up. Gives you the light arrows. Then helps you defeat Ganon.  Not some ""Save me!"" Damsel in Distress moment. She actually steps to the plate with you. That said a lot to me. Instantly made her my favorite game lady.  Yeah, Midna helps, but she is kind of thrust into that situation.  Yeah, Samus is a badass, but she is from the get-go. You expect and control that yourself.  None of those things really applied to Zelda. Even as Sheik, she was really just hiding out while Ganondorf was basically destroying Hyrule. It really took her magic and your courage to take him down. No other game I've played has something like that."
zelda,3di5rx,compacta_d,14,Thu Jul 16 18:28:38 2015 UTC,Ocarina is absolutely my favorite entry into the series. I was 14 at the time and I am sure alot of factors contributed to my love for this game but my god was it just laid out in a way that I was thoroughly engrossed by its story.

zelda,3di5rx,TurboChadwick,7,Fri Jul 17 02:46:46 2015 UTC,"When Ganondorf seized the Triforce, it was split into three pieces.  He received the piece that most represented what was in his heart - the Triforce of Power.  The other two pieces sought out the people who most strongly embodied those virtues.  Princess Zelda received the Triforce of Wisdom, and you received the Triforce of Courage.  And together, in the final battle, you face Ganon.  But what use are your courage and wisdom here?  There are no puzzles to solve.  No labyrinths to explore.  No mysteries to face.  No journey to undertake.  There's just a flat, emtpy battlefield.  You're trapped inside.  Zelda is trapped outside.  The music is telling you: this is an absolutely hopeless battle.  You've already lost.  You're facing the wielder of the Triforce of Power in a one-on-one, head-on battle, with no gimmicks, no backup, no options.  And you're unarmed.  There are no options.  There's no path to victory.  There's no weak point.  The sword of evil's bane has failed.  What can you possibly do?  Didn't I already tell you?  You're the embodiment of courage.  You have no chance.  You have no hope.  Fight anyway."

zelda,3di5rx,supersaying,7,Thu Jul 16 19:15:25 2015 UTC,"One of my favourite final boss fights is the final boss of Dark Souls. I always joke that Dark Souls is Zelda for big kids, just because there are a lot of similarities between the games.  :SPOILERS AHEAD:  The final boss of Dark Souls is Gwyn, Lord of Cinder, who is sort of like the leader of the ""Gods"" of Lordran. As you go into the fight, you have no indication of who it would be until you enter the arena, but knowing it's the final boss, you expect it to be some sort of massive demon or some kind of monster, but it's just him, not much larger than a normal man, with a burning greatsword, and he is visibly hollowed and mad. Then the music starts playing, and it's just a piano boss music. He is a god who has sacrificed everything, even his own soul and sanity, to try to keep the age of light lasting as long as he can, but he's failing, and there's nothing you can do but to kill him. It's an incredible way to end the game, and it's stayed as one of my favourite final bosses in gaming. Video"
zelda,3di5rx,bellagio67,3,Thu Jul 16 17:04:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, the final boss in DS is fantastic. Instead of being insanely powerful, he is as strong as you. It's a fantastic ""end"" to the game, definitely."
zelda,3di5rx,rigbymad12,8,Thu Jul 16 17:44:42 2015 UTC,"That's a great way to put it. The final boss fight didn't necessarily feel ominous or dangerous. But empty (but in a good way). It was the void like atmosphere that gave you that do-or-die feeling. Either I save Hyrule now, or its all over.   Especially with how they were able to lure you into that false sense of security as you're running out of a crumbling tower with Zelda at your side.

The use of atmosphere is more than just feeling mysterious or quirky or spooky. The atmosphere communicates genuine emotions. Sadness, joy, loneliness, longing, dread, peace. It's shows a level of control through music and visuals that few other works can muster."

zelda,3di5rx,xKempesx,2,Thu Jul 16 19:37:39 2015 UTC,"The OoT incarnation of Ganon is really interesting to me, because it sets up this sort of balance that subsequent (and previous, game-release-wise) Ganons fall from.  In OoT, the final battle is a sort of mixture of him throwing magic around at you as Ganondorf, and then just ungodly strength with the twin-swords as Ganon.  He doesn't truly treat you as a threat for the first half, preferring to just smite you from afar while floating just out of reach; it's only when you bring his entire castle crashing down around his ears that he loses his cool and really goes all out against you.  These two styles of fighting, the egotistical magic-user and the raging swordsman, and the balance between the two, show up in the various timelines spawned from OoT;  each branch (hero defeated, sealed as child, and sealed as adult) reflects the outcome in how Ganon appears and fights.  In the ""hero defeated"" line, he tends to be a caster (teleportation in LoZ, summoning fireballs and casting spells to cause darkness in LttP), which makes sense since he defeated the hero presumably using that tactic.  In the ""sealed as a child"" route, we see more of a mix, especially in TP where he has the same strategy of magic for the first half of the fight and ruthless combat for the second.  Given that he never faced an actual enemy in this timeline, it makes sense that he'd act essentially the same.  Most interestingly to me, in the ""sealed as adult"" timeline, he's deadly serious the entire time he's dealing with Link.  If it hadn't been for Valoo and the Rito postmaster, he'd probably have crushed Link the first time they met.  When he faces the hero at the final battle, he foregoes all the rage that you see in the OoT fight as Ganon, instead opting for a cold and stoic battle stance that doesn't for a second underestimate Link's skill.  Personally, his tragic backstory and attitude in WW makes that probably my favorite incarnation of Ganon, but that's affected in no small part by how pivotal the OoT final battle is in my mind.  It shapes the way all future incarnations of Ganon are treated, and I guess you can't ask for much more than that in a boss battle."
zelda,3di5rx,badpath,2,Thu Jul 16 20:16:06 2015 UTC,"I also love how everything echoes so much during that fight. It really makes you feel like there's nothing else left, nothing in the world except this final showdown.  Also, can we take a moment to appreciate the fucking amazing use of timpani on the OoT soundtrack!? What other game music has a fucking timpani solo in its boss battle music?"
zelda,3di5rx,gowronatemybaby7,2,Thu Jul 16 22:08:43 2015 UTC,"This is a bit off topic but isnt it weird yellow walls always spawn exactly so that Zelda cannot help Link on fight but she is just stupidly watching outside, happens in OOT and Twiligt Princess final bosses.  THAT is one piece of criticism I have agaisnt this fight. If they don't want Zelda there they can write the story so that she isnt there, and if she is there she should help Link to fight evil. Zelda is such a noble person that I cannot imagine she would just watch and do nothing if not because of the wall.   Plus there are three most powerful beings of Hyrule, Zelda has piece of Triforce too. I think her being there added a lot depth to fight compared to if it would have been just Link and Ganon.   Its an epic and great fight indeed, I love OOT story, and that's its finale.  Especially when you think youve beaten him and then castle starts to crumble."

Light Arrows came in before the Master Sword was used for anything at first. It felt a little too Deus Ex Machina, but it was still enjoyable.  My ideal fight would've been:  Phase 1 Sword/Shield Fight (Reflecting ranged attacks with the shield + hitting weak spots with the sword).  Phase 2 Mirror Shield and other items.  Phase 3 Master Sword gets knocked out of reach. Light Arrows must be utilized here.  Phase 4 Sword/Shield Fight 2. The Boss is defeated in this phase."

zelda,3di5rx,RockLee456,11,Thu Jul 16 14:14:54 2015 UTC,"The atmosphere is just plain for a final boss.   I think you're absolutely nuts in this regard.  You're on an island floating above a massive pool of lava, upon the smoking ruins of the dark castle that was just brought down, surrounded by a ring of magical fire, at night, during a thunderstorm, face to face and swordless (well Master Swordless) against a mad sorcerer king transformed into a monstrosity by channeling his hatred though a stolen divine artifact, with the whole scene only illuminated by flashes of lightning, accompanied by an amazing boss theme.  I'm actually unimpressed with the fight itself (roll between legs, slap tail, win), but the atmosphere they created for the fight is one of the absolute masterpieces of gaming history.  I'm furious that the 3DS version made it so well lit.  I loved that in the original, Ganon was this towering silhouette with his glowing eyes, only revealed fully by the occasional lightning strike.    Up until this point he's been this eloquent, arrogant, in-control chessmaster but now he's just absolutely fucking done with you.  He tried to kill you by bringing his castle down on you, and when that fails he doesn't have anything left to say, he just loses control and comes at you as this monstrosity of pure hatred and desperation after all his plans have crumbled around him.  And I love how the game doesn't even bother with a title, it's just ""GANON"" while it pulls the camera to a shot of him towering above you with his two huge swords.  The pure rage is such a great contrast against Ganondorf's calculated, magic style, and it's a great representation of how far you've pushed him and the madness burning beneath his intelligent front waiting to boil over.  This is one of the few scenes in gaming history that I will absolutely go full fanboy over."

zelda,3di5rx,Anggul,3,Fri Jul 17 02:38:34 2015 UTC,"I did very much like the Wind Waker one, but I think the point in the OoT one is that it's meant to be relatively plain but with a feeling of inevitable dread.  It's also worth mentioning that while it seems cliche to us now, it was many years ago when we first played it and was very impressive at the time.  I'm of the opinion that the Ganondorf part was extremely disappointing. It was just a repeat of the second half of Phantom Ganon and pretty much the entire fight against Twinrova. There was no impressive fight utilising your skills and gear, just another game of magic pong."
zelda,3di5rx,fatmikey42,3,Thu Jul 16 16:42:48 2015 UTC,"what makes it different, and is supposed to make it much harder, is that you can't z target him for the pong, which makes the next step of hitting him with a light arrow much harder, since you only have a second or two. it's like the phantom ganon fight, but much faster paced. and it's nothing like the twinrova fight. playing pong with your sword is very different in practice than collecting and redirecting twinrovas attack with a shield."
zelda,3di5rx,Anggul,0,Thu Jul 16 17:49:59 2015 UTC,"It's still the same deal, barely different and rather easy.  It's hardly the impressive showdown it should be, certainly not when compared to Wind Waker."

In Ocarina, you're battling Ganon's beast form, which is cool and all, but I feel like... I dunno, he's all big and beastly to the point that it's almost like battling a giant. I mean - the strategy is to roll between his legs. He's literally so big that you can move through him. Furthermore, you can't block his attacks, only dodge them. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I've always liked how TP and WW end up with a straight-up duel. You block each others attacks and fight on even footing. I dunno. That's just my opinion."

zelda,3di5rx,Fbulol,0,Sat Jul 18 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"I loved the atmosphere and music, but I think Ocarina of Time's final boss suffered from the same problem that Twilight Princess' did (although maybe not quite as bad as TP):  It's pathetically easy.  The previous battle against Ganondorf isn't exactly intense in terms of difficulty, but it's challenging to keep the timing consistent, as well as the handicap of being unable to target him. Ganon, on the other hand, is a complete pushover- just roll between the legs and you win every time. The only way I've found to make this challenging was to do it in a 3-heart run, since once hit kills you (and even then I did it on my second try). Not as absurd as TP's stupidly easy final battle against Ganondorf, but still not great.  That's why Wind Waker will forever be my favorite final boss in a 3D Zelda- it's both atmospheric and genuinely challenging (not that hard if you have 20 heart containers, but then again nothing is)."

I'm hoping the get it together before the end.  If you think about it, Skyward took 5 years to develop and the game was a little on the smaller side."

zelda,3do0em,bardicfury,2,Sat Jul 18 10:54:30 2015 UTC,"He said ""Skyward"" as in Skyward Sword, not Skyrim.   The only reason I could see Nintendo having difficulty here is that they've never made a game of that technical scale and depth.  Ocarina of Time was a technical masterpiece for its time, but that's pretty much where Nintendo stopped working on the 'cutting edge' of gaming.  Since then, they've played it relatively safe and simple, until Zelda U which is (assumingly) neither of those things.  I could see them running into trouble because of this, but they've always made it work in their past attempts.  Back on Skyrim, though, I'd really like to see them do better than that.  Much like with OoT, Oblivion was the last game that Bethesda tried anything truly ground-breaking, with Skyrim just following the mold.  I wanna see Nintendo 're-invent' open-world gameplay, again.  What we have going now has gotten pretty stale, y'know?  Run around, grab a quest, follow the beacon, grab the thing and return to complete the quest.  That's pretty much what it all comes down to now.  My hopes are that they're trying to break that mold and push further once more, like they did in 1998."
zelda,3do0em,malaroo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:05:36 2015 UTC,"I know he said Skyward.  What I'm saying is if the Skyrim team can make a game on similar scale and style to what Zelda Wii U is going for, and they did it 2 years ago, why can't Nintendo and the Zelda team get Zelda Wii U done?"
zelda,3do0em,bardicfury,2,Sat Jul 18 11:08:06 2015 UTC,"Well, because Skyrim's team already had a tried-and-true engine in place, with loads of developers who made multiple games just like that before, and they're able to design their games with modern hardware in mind, unlike a Wii U game.  That kind of game is Bethesda's strong suit, but Nintendo has never attempted anything like it.  They've been using N64-style design, well, since the N64.  Graphics and things have obviously been improved, but at a fundamental level, Twilight Princes for example isn't a huge stretch away from Ocarina of Time.  This will be the first Nintendo game ever that attempts to make use of 'modern' open world design and all of the technology behind what makes it all work.  They don't have any experience with it, so it could be rocky at first.  I'm sure it will meet most of its expectations, though."
zelda,3do0em,malaroo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:15:16 2015 UTC,I hope they do a good job! They are Nintendo and making a Zelda title so it will be a great game.
zelda,3do0em,bardicfury,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:16:24 2015 UTC,"I'm confident that they will, but also (only slightly) wary that they will goof parts of it.  Nintendo consistently makes nearly perfect games, but they're also not shy about handling certain aspects of those games in a less-than-perfect way.  Many, many times have they had amazing ideas that had to be cut down or scrapped in the final product.  Consider that Ocarina of Time was originally intended to work with the N64 Disc Drive, and thus was meant to be a much bigger, more grand game.   However, despite those plans falling through, Ocarina of Time was still revolutionary.  I feel like it's possible that things about Zelda U might follow that same pattern, but in the end it will still end up being great."

zelda,3do0em,TheMissingLinkYT,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:57:51 2015 UTC,"Yup, and most other Zeldas have stayed with that design as well. Twilight Princess, while obviously graphically superior, functions incredibly similar to OoT as well.  Skyward Sword, minus the motion controls, is pretty similar too; maybe even slightly simplified when it comes to the world.  Wind Waker attempted something slightly new, with the seamless overworld, but it was just empty space and islands.  Zelda U however is a big step forward, much like Ocarina of Time was a big step forward when compared to A Link to the Past before it.  My point was that it's been 17 years since we saw a step forward like that, and it's pretty awesome to be on the verge of that again."

zelda,3dm491,RandUser_,8,Fri Jul 17 11:26:12 2015 UTC,"It's amazing how divisive the controls were in this game. I love them, and barely ever had a problem playing. The only thing I had an issue with was the target system."
zelda,3dm491,CerealWarrior,2,Fri Jul 17 14:47:42 2015 UTC,"I also find this amazing. I think some people just don't like the IDEA of motion controls and won't give them a good chance. If you look at it objectively, they work very nicely in SS.  For example, a lot of people complain about not being able to execute the sword thrust, which requires you move the control forward. If you move the control a bit sideways then link swings the sword and you can get annoyed. But I don't see this as the game's fault. You just have to do it right and it really isn't hard."
zelda,3dm491,deeplife,0,Fri Jul 17 23:42:06 2015 UTC,"But I don't see this as the game's fault. You just have to do it right and it really isn't hard.   That's like saying it's the player's fault that their half-broken B button only works right if you press it in just the right way, and they have trouble doing that.  By definition, this is the opposite of intuitive.  Pressing up on an analog stick is supposed to make you move forward, not slightly to the left. You shouldn't have to compensate for it by tilting slightly to the right. If you do, something about how it works is wrong. Why is it any different in this case?  These are simple, basic commands.  You shouldn't have to be 'master' the technique of pressing B so that it actually does what it's supposed to.  It should just do what it's supposed to."
zelda,3dm491,malaroo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:32:57 2015 UTC,"Like I said, it isn't hard, so yeah you don't have to be a ""master"".   If you move the controller forward, Link thrusts his sword. I don't see what's so hard about moving the damn controller forward. Want to swing right? Swing the controller right. Seriously, the sword control works very nicely, I never had an issue in my entire play through."
zelda,3dm491,deeplife,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:12:50 2015 UTC,"I don't see what's so hard about moving the damn controller forward.   Nothing is.  That's why it should work in pretty much all cases.  You say here that it's simple, and it is, so how could anyone actually fuck it up?  What even is there to do 'wrong'?  Pretty much nothing; It's like pressing B, except the 'B button' in this case doesn't always register.   I never had an issue   I'm not going through this again."
zelda,3dm491,malaroo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:19:21 2015 UTC,"As we have both stated, moving the controller forward to sword thrust is easy. Yet, people complain. Can't you see that some people simply don't want to perform simple motions with a liiittle bit of thought put into them? It's like they want to play as in TP, where a simple waggle works. No, in SS you have to be a bit more conscious about what you're doing, at least at the beginning. It comes naturally in no time. That is of course, if you are not too stubborn that you want the game to guess what kind of sword motion you want to do. Some people just don't want to do ANY effort at all and want to be fully served and have the game do it for them. With just a TINY bit effort, the thing works VERY well. I am not a fanboy simply defending my favorite franchise or whatever; when SS came out I was genuinely surprised at how good its motion controls work.   I guess I have nothing else to say..."

Seriously, the only thing you've said here is varied versions of ""It worked for me"" and ""you suck because it didn't for you"".  The idea that everyone is too stupid or inept to get on your level and use basic inputs is a silly-ass cop-out.  There is nothing about it to get good at it; it's simple, basic, easy for anyone to perform.  It's got nothing to do with any kind of 'effort' and once again - even if it did - the most basic commands should not require any real amount of attentive focus simply to be executed and detected properly.  Complicated, skill-based stuff?  Sure, that should take some learning.  But holding your sword in the air?  How can you possibly get that wrong?  There is only one way to do that, and it's absolutely as simple as could be, but that doesn't mean it will work.  It worked well for you; that's as far as your argument goes.  That doesn't mean anything for anyone else, and to assume otherwise nothing other than (multiple kinds of) logical fallacy."

The biggest key is to NOT just waggle like Twilight Princess. You need to carefully position your Wii Remote BEFORE you strike. The angle you hold the Wii Remote at before you attack is much more important than how you move it for the strike.   The game TRIES to train you for this early on, but just doesn't do a very good job of it. Stick with it - it really does start to feel better. Or at least did for me."

A button press is a button press; no room to go wrong.  Skyward Sword's motion controls are inaccurate, entirely inconsistent and frustrating.  ""But they worked fine for me!"" yes, and they didn't work for the endless amount of people you see complaining every time the game is mentioned anywhere, because they're inconsistent.  Me?  They worked fine for everything except stabs and skyward strikes.  ""You're not using them right!"", right?  That's what people always say but I don't see how you can really point the Wiimote up in a 'wrong' way.  Never had these issues with analog sticks or extra buttons.  They always did exactly what you pressed."

It made a lot of the boss battles (such as Demise and Ghirahim) nearly impossible and incredibly aggravating. It was a shame because it distracted so much from what could have been a very good addition to the series with some pivotal plot points.

If the controller is losing or having issues with its connection, it typically pauses the game and says ""please reconnect the wiimote"" or something along those lines.  The issues he had look like the exact issues that everyone else does.   I've played through this game twice, there's absolutely nothing wrong with the controls.   Refer to:   ...if you're not able to grasp that what works for you might not work for everyone else in all cases.

Consider that pretty much all E3 presentations are wireless, and very few ever struggle with interference like that. I think it'd be just a bit too big of a coincidence that the game with hugely complained about control issues is only showing them on stage because of chance interference.   Miyamoto probably doesn't know how to play his own game.   Yes, and thousands of others, including me who's been playing Zelda for almost 30 years, and Wii games since it launched.  You can stick with that fallacy based logic if you want, but I'm gonna go ahead and stay with the actual logic that sometimes products have issues."

For some reason you just can't grasp how to properly swing the sword. I don't know why? A flaw in your ability to learn how to do things that require slight dexterity maybe?

A flaw in your ability to learn how to do things that require slight dexterity maybe?   There's a term used a lot in game design. It's called ""intuitive"". If the controls don't work correctly for everyone at least most of the time, the controls aren't intuitive and maybe should've been fixed (or replaced with a button press). When this many people consistently complain about the controls not working, I don't give a shit if they worked for you, they're broken and that's a fair criticism to give. Regardless of why the controls don't work, they don't work for a huge amount of people, therefore they're a problem.  Mind you, Sonic '06 is absolutely playable if you know how navigate around the bugs in the game. Does that mean the game is fine and everyone who has issues is just ""retarded"" as you say? Of course not. The same principle applies to Skyward Sword. Furthermore...   I like how you say it's a bug too, as if this bug would be present in some copies of the game and not others.   It may not be an issue with the game itself, but it's been established that the setup in different people's homes actually have had a large effect on how accurate the controls are.

To suggest that I simply can't 'figure out' what I've been using perfectly fine for almost 10 years is just silly.   I like how you say it's a bug too, as if this bug would be present in some copies of the game and not others.   Uh, what?  Bugs are a part of most games, but not everyone experiences every single one.  I've never had a game-breaking bug in a Bethesda game (for example) but look around and you'll find that they exist in overwhelming amounts.  In Skyward Sword's case, it's a common complaint much in the same way that it is with a Bethesda game, because the controls are handled by relatively new and somewhat unrefined technology.  Nintendo has even admitted that at one point, they were having so many issues with it, that they almost considered going back to TP's version of motion controls and dropping the idea.  So it happened to work for you; the personal source of your entire argument.  You're fortunate, yes, but not everyone is.  Just like I'm fortunate never to have a broken Bethesda game, it doesn't mean that everybody else had my luck.  This is all basic logic, I shouldn't even have to type it all out."

We decided to make a thing of it, bought chips, dip, and beer...lots of beer.  I think the funniest scene in the whole show was when Ganon ambushes Zelda and Link and manages to swipe the triforce from them and proceeds to jog away, leaving his goons to fight them.  I don't remember what exactly happens next but one of the goons gets flung into the air and lands in front of Ganon who then stops and says,""No you fool, get them like this!""  He starts to mimic a boxer and laughs maniacally while doing so.  All of us lost our shit from that scene."

I own it myself and I enjoyed every last second of it when I first bought it.  It's definitely not something I'll watch time and again. It's not amazing, breathtaking, or ever competent. It ranges from good to mediocre until the last couple of episodes that are pretty bad. But it still has a charm to it.  Watch it. Have fun with it. Grab some buddies around and have fun. Display it proudly next to the rest of your Zelda collection or your Shout! collection.  And furthermore, you did not get ripped off. You got it for an amazingly good deal, so great job!  Edit: By the way, Captain N has like two episodes revolving around The Legend of Zelda, with a more grown up Link and Zelda (based off the ones in this show). It takes heavy inspiration from Zelda II as well, if I remember correctly."

He still kidnaps a bunch of girls, and he still obliterates Greatfish Isle, killing everyone there. Then there's the havoc he wreaked on Hyrule before the Goddesses themselves were practically forced to intervene, which says a lot, because it's not like they're very involved with Hyrule at any point after they first created it.  Ultimately, I think he still has the same goals he always had, but by the final battle he's gone mad from the fact that no matter what, something always stops him. Even when there's no hero, he's still stopped by the Goddesses, and trapped all over again. I do think some part of him wants to finally die, to have it all be over, and that's cemented after the King of Hyrule touches the Triforce before he gets the chance to do so himself. But even then he still wants to take Link and Zelda with him.  So even if he's somewhat pitiable, even if his heart isn't in it 100% at the end, that doesn't even come close to making him a good guy."

But in WW he's mature, but more than that it's like he doesn't want anything to be his. He's just an old, sorrowful, ancient man that wants his home back now, regardless of the fact that it was his actions that made the gods flood it, he still genuinely grieves for its loss. I actually wish the theme of duality was present in the rest of the game, rather than just Ganon and Daphne, it's present very well in them, but never explored in the game. For coming up so late in the game, and not getting any actual spot light it is an incredible piece of the game, even more so since it is almost entirely driven by the knowledge of OoT Ganon contrasted against WW Ganon, but nothing from King Daphne apart from him being the one willing to let go."

zelda,3dgqef,Funky_Billiards,3,Thu Jul 16 03:41:48 2015 UTC,Thanks my friend! That CD case is the MM soundtrack that I got from Club Nintendo a while back! It's still sealed..I can't get myself to open it.

zelda,3dilxx,rsimpleton,2,Thu Jul 16 15:53:59 2015 UTC,"Afaik, they both have the same number of heart containers. When you link a game from the 1st to the 2nd, you gain a heart container. That sounds like what you're talking about."
zelda,3dilxx,BithTree,2,Thu Jul 16 16:56:18 2015 UTC,I found this.. http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/472313-the-legend-of-zelda-oracle-of-ages/66339301  Looks like ages is the one with a missing container
zelda,3dilxx,Rynelan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link!  After going through the thread (and a few others), it looks like whatever game you start with will have a missing heart container in the initial save file. BUT, because I am planning on playing each game twice, I -should- end up with a complete file for each with the second playthrough...  I'm just going to give it a go and hope it works out."
zelda,3dilxx,SuperGanondorf,2,Thu Jul 16 17:36:51 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter which one you start with; you can't get 100% on your first playthrough. This is because when you complete one, you get a password to enter into the other, which gives you an extra heart container and unlocks several hidden sidequests and items in the other game. Then you can 100% the second game. Once you complete the second game, you will get a password to enter into the first game which will allow you to start a new file, again with the extra container and sidequests, etc. You can then 100% it on your new file.  TL;DR Whichever one you start first, if you want to 100% it you have to play twice."
zelda,3dilxx,SuperGanondorf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:39:31 2015 UTC,"That's what I'd concluded, but thanks for confirming! I just hope it won't be overkill to play both games twice, back to back."
zelda,3dilxx,llall12,2,Thu Jul 16 18:57:59 2015 UTC,"I've played them both several times, and definitely think they're worth playing again- I think they're by far the most underrated games in the series.   Luckily, though, you'll only have to play one of them twice; whichever one you play second, you will be able to 100% on your first go since you'll have the code from the first game."
zelda,3dgwnr,SalomonG18,3,Thu Jul 16 04:28:32 2015 UTC,Link looks depressed in that pic   tfw no pots to break

zelda,3ddjy2,Ryksnout,29,Wed Jul 15 12:51:48 2015 UTC,"It's nice and all, but I have a feeling If this goes much farther with the KS, then Nintendo will come in with a C&D."
zelda,3ddjy2,OSUTechie,12,Wed Jul 15 16:34:44 2015 UTC,"It's an absolute certainty.  This already happened with a Metroid movie plan on KS.  Owning the intellectual property you're trying to merchandise is step one, and funding anything without that is beyond dumb."
zelda,3ddjy2,workingclassmustache,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:19:31 2015 UTC,Couldn't the producers just claim fair use? Its not like they're gaining profit off it.
zelda,3ddjy2,Woahtheredudex,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:35:11 2015 UTC,"Obviously not. From the youtube link, as of today:   ""The Zeldamotion project is canceled. Thanks for your support.""   What are the odds that the instant this thing gets some attention it gets shutdown?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4vIBijzg4w"
zelda,3ddjy2,workingclassmustache,38,Thu Jul 16 19:37:45 2015 UTC,"I'd welcome an animated series more readily than a live-action interpretation. That said, this looks like it has potential.  I just hope they work on the visuals. I'm all for keeping them in line with the game and the manga, but it needs more polish if they want it to appeal to people who haven't played the game, as well. Fans will gloss over the roughness, out of nostalgia and love for the franchise, but someone new to it will just think it's sloppy. Can't judge just from one pre-release episode though.  The music's in the bag, hard to go wrong with classic zelda soundtracks.  Voice acting's a big one that will really define whether it feels fan-made or professional. A good voice actor will make or break Link as a character, I think. The lineup looks pretty experienced though, so I'm sure it'll be fine.  The story and pacing's already there, as well, which is good. No filler or fan theories working their way in there, which you might get with a fan-written story.  I'm definitely backing it, and I really hope it does well. It might even inspire an official anime from Nintendo, one day, maybe.  edit: Also, can't really picture Vic Mignogna as Agahnim, unless they pitch him as a kind of campy, stereotypical, moustache-twirling type of antagonist. I haven't read the manga, so someone will have to tell me if that's how he's written or not.  Edit: Welp, it's cancelled. Hopefully we'll see a similar project in the future, that'll have more success."
zelda,3ddjy2,TwinkleToes333,6,Wed Jul 15 15:52:39 2015 UTC,"The animation is definitely rough in some spots, especially the water when it loops. The other one that really stood out was them walking back to the farm, their walking was very robotic."
zelda,3ddjy2,DegeneratePaladin,2,Wed Jul 15 19:10:29 2015 UTC,I agree its easier but I was always hopeful someone would actually make this.
zelda,3ddjy2,bananenkonig,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:34:49 2015 UTC,"Out of all the live action Zelda stuff I've seen, this looked like one of the better ones."
zelda,3ddjy2,MathewKinetix,2,Wed Jul 15 20:40:22 2015 UTC,Yep early 00's me was excited until I realized it was April 1st.
zelda,3ddjy2,bananenkonig,17,Wed Jul 15 20:52:32 2015 UTC,Link sounds like Edward Elric. I couldn't think of a better voice actor.
zelda,3ddjy2,Santahousecommune,12,Wed Jul 15 15:43:40 2015 UTC,Actually he's Natsu from Fairy Tail but coincidentally Vic Mignogna is playing Agahnim.
zelda,3ddjy2,saintjimmy64,4,Wed Jul 15 16:44:42 2015 UTC,Oh! I always thought Natsu and Edward were played by the same guy. They sound similar. Cool :) either way good choice.
zelda,3ddjy2,Santahousecommune,7,Wed Jul 15 18:19:26 2015 UTC,IIRC Natsu and Ling have the same VA

zelda,3ddjy2,Pokefight-club,7,Wed Jul 15 15:35:09 2015 UTC,Incoming Nintendo C&D
zelda,3ddjy2,Jammintk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:22:39 2015 UTC,"Already shut down. I get it, protecting trademarks and such, but its still a shame. Nintendo really needs to jump on this kind of stuff. Many of there iconic franchises could make some killer motion pictures. And we all know that fans would shell out money just for the pure nostalgia."
zelda,3ddjy2,Noob_tuba23,9,Thu Jul 16 15:50:04 2015 UTC,"Animation needs some work, and I'm not digging the Link voice personally.    Either way... how are they holding a kickstarter for this? They can't really make money for this, not even paying people out for work expenses cause it would be earning money from Nintendo's IP... This will be shot down by Nintendo if they do something like that.     edit : Just want to point out : at 5:20, Uncle is stabbed by a curved dagger, blood drips from a straight knife. Also, that fight scene feels VERY slow/sluggish and awkward."
zelda,3ddjy2,henryuuk,5,Wed Jul 15 16:30:06 2015 UTC,I think it's possible if all of the money goes towards software and equipment. And everything else goes towards paying for the resulting court case where they try to keep the project afloat.
zelda,3ddjy2,nomenMei,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:38:29 2015 UTC,"Under the US Parody act, all they'd have to do to prevent a C&D is throw some humour in there."
zelda,3ddjy2,CaptainNigel,2,Wed Jul 15 18:51:20 2015 UTC,"It's not quite that simple...  They could try a parody claim, but, like ""Fair Use"", there's no blanket rules that define what is a parody and each individual work would be judged on its own merit.  It's why something like Riff Trax, even though a very obvious parody work, is seaperate from the video."
zelda,3ddjy2,TheUncleBob,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:12:36 2015 UTC,"Actually that's where it depends on whether it's for profit or not. Riff tracks was merchandise, it was created with the intent of making money, and included the entirety of someone else's intellectual property. If the creators of this series are not looking to sell it, that's a big difference, and the fact that all content they're displaying is their own is a HUGE difference. The real issue is the music- that is the property of Koji Kondo and Nintendo."
zelda,3ddjy2,CaptainNigel,2,Wed Jul 15 19:17:20 2015 UTC,"The moment they put it on Kickstarter and asked for donations, they started making money on it - regardless of what those donations are used for.  And without seeing the video (at work) is all of the content they're displaying actually their own?  Are they using names and likenesses of characters and concepts created and owned by Nintendo?  I'm not saying it can't be done - look at Legend of Neil - amazingly funny and well done (aside from some aspects of season 3....) and they've actually sold merchandise from it (I own a DVD!)."
zelda,3ddjy2,TheUncleBob,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:29:53 2015 UTC,"What I mean by all of the content is that, unlike MSTK and Riff Trax, they're not actually using content generated by others, even if theirs uses the likenesses and names of the original game, that's exactly what parody law covers.The problem is that they're also planning to follow the story, unlike LoN, which makes it an adaptation, not a parody, so they really have to tread lightly. In all honesty, it probably can't be done."
zelda,3ddjy2,CaptainNigel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:47:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Not saying it's impossible, but it's unlikely a true adaptation would survive a Nintendo legal smackdown.  Just pointing out that adding in some humor (even more so for a series that's been littered with lighthearted humor) probably wouldn't go their way.  They's need to go all-in similar to LoN..."
zelda,3ddjy2,TheUncleBob,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:52:37 2015 UTC,"I noticed that too (the dagger), I came on here to see if anyone else mentioned it. As well as that, the scene at the start where Link and his uncle walk into the sunset has really rough animation, more so than the rest of the clip, which could all use some serious polish. I'm also very curious why a LttP  cartoon would have certain colourings more relevant to other games in the series, ie. Link's hair being blond instead of brown, or the shield being burgundy instead of blue."
zelda,3ddjy2,CaptainNigel,3,Wed Jul 15 18:50:23 2015 UTC,That was actually pretty captivating. Is there more?
zelda,3ddjy2,zincessprelda,2,Wed Jul 15 15:39:16 2015 UTC,"I think it might just be me, but after watching episode 1, I really feel like this is something I'd see on Newgrounds. Here's hoping the Kickstarter succeeds and we get some A+ work!"
zelda,3ddjy2,StreetlightTones,2,Wed Jul 15 16:28:37 2015 UTC,"Link sounds like DBZ abridged 's Goku, and that's kind of ruining it for me lol."

zelda,3ddjy2,heart-station,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:53:05 2015 UTC,The opening animation was great. I thought it would be a simple fan animation until I heard the voice actors.
zelda,3ddjy2,CrashLove37,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:56:50 2015 UTC,That was truly amazing for a fan made anime. The voice acting was really good. Of course the animation is lacking but the potential is there.

zelda,3dj5xr,MousquetaireDuRoi,2,Thu Jul 16 22:38:13 2015 UTC,"It's usually not that these things were cut, it's that they were changed.  For example, the 'Wind Temple' is just the early version of the Forest Temple, so including both would just have you playing through two variations on the same dungeon.  Stuff gets changed for a reason, usually because the thing they change it to ends up being more fun and generally works better than the earlier stuff.    I get where you're coming from, though.  I love looking through old Zelda stuff that never actually came to be.  A good example of this is Twilight Princess' first trailer, in which almost nothing you see actually made it into the game."

Alas, it was not to be. Personally, I think it'd be cool, but it also probably would take a lot of time from developing 100% new Zelda games, so overall I don't think it's worth the trade-off.
