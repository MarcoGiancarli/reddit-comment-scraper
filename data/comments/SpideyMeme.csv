SpideyMeme,3e4exm,LonelyNixon,5,Wed Jul 22 02:48:20 2015 UTC,I closed the other night and a customer comes in literally a minute before we close to return his shit.   I was so pissed off. He kept on telling me to return everything individually and why he was returning it. He left 20min later and then I was stuck there during lock down almost a whole hour later. Fuck these types of customers.

I heard someone fucking with some rugs. She had them all laid out on the floor and looking at them to see which ones she liked better.   Then she asked for my advice.  ""I like that one. Look, ma'am, we are closing, and you need to go check out.""  Then she just stood there looking at them. I had to call my manager to keep the registers and doors open for her.   Who the hell even comes out to shop at 10:30 at night?"
