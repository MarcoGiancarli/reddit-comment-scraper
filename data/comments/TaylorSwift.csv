TaylorSwift,3e2y69,Huubidi,13,Tue Jul 21 15:36:51 2015 UTC,"I think ""Blank Space"" is a far better (and more original) video and should be nominated for video of the year instead of ""Bad Blood"".  ""Bad Blood"" comes off as a heavily derivative action movie trailer for a movie we have all seen before."
TaylorSwift,3e2y69,Dark_Fiber,3,Tue Jul 21 18:47:09 2015 UTC,"Bad Blood seems to be nominated for Video of the Year, but Blank Space is nominated for Best Female Video and Best Pop Video.  Not sure why. It might have been MTV's call or Taylors."
TaylorSwift,3e2y69,McBawse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:18:59 2015 UTC,"I could not agree more with this! I wish I could just be really happy for her, but I don't think ""Bad Blood"" is even her best video of the year, let alone a contender for best video, period. ""Blank Space"" deserved that nomination.  I think ""Bad Blood"" is a mediocre music video that is even less impressive given how hyped up it was. It also features the worst song on her album. It's fun, sure, but it's essentially just based on others' work (ripping scenes from action movies), there is no discernible story and the plethora of ""characters"" see no development, just taking up screen time from elements that perhaps could have added depth or story that never materializes.  ""Blank Space,"" on the other hand, is a creative, original, clever video AND song. It's also beautiful visually speaking, and entertaining to watch and rewatch. I saw ""Bad Blood"" once and was uninterested. I've only rewatched it since to catch things I miss or as part of learning more about it/critiquing it. I bought and love to watch ""Blank Space"" because it's still fun but also tells a clever story and makes a smart commentary on the portrayal of Taylor and other women in tabloids and gossip magazines. ""Bad Blood"" is one big fight... that's about it."
TaylorSwift,3e2y69,MissyBee37,21,Tue Jul 21 22:09:51 2015 UTC,Am I the only one not impressed with it? It feels like one big opening credits scene and nothing ends up happening.
TaylorSwift,3e2y69,drewdle,7,Tue Jul 21 18:25:10 2015 UTC,It felt like a trailer. I also wasn't a huge fan. But I loooovedddd blank space!
TaylorSwift,3e2y69,WingZeroType,4,Tue Jul 21 18:26:29 2015 UTC,"it was really the only time I was ""Disappointed"" with the quality of content TS put out :( Its just a video about cameos... But not only that the special effects on it are pretty cringe-bad at some points. Adding the rapper to the song for the music video was the last straw that needed to be pulled for me to admit that I did not like it."
TaylorSwift,3e2y69,You_Goombus,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:08 2015 UTC,I don't care for the rapping either! I stick to the album version.

TaylorSwift,3e2y69,Robertxtrem,7,Tue Jul 21 19:55:44 2015 UTC,The video for Bad Blood really hurt my perception of Taylor as a creative force. For a video that had been hyped up so much it was more or less a homemade tribute to the last two decades of action films. She could have done a lot better than ripping of Tron and Sin City. Blank Space on the other hand (or Style) both match Taylor's atmosphere perfectly.

TaylorSwift,3e3tdb,SafeLinks,11,Tue Jul 21 19:10:55 2015 UTC,"We have taylorswift breast leg armpits and thighs. We don't need to see all that here. Even taylorswift pictures has rules against overly sexualized posts. I get it, she's hot. Beautiful gorgeous and cute. But she's so much more than just a body. The last thing I want to see is the sub turn into /r/arianagrande. I get that everybody isn't here for her music, I can even sympathize, but that's why we have those other subs I listed."
TaylorSwift,3e3tdb,The_Shreckoning,9,Tue Jul 21 19:16:56 2015 UTC,"My main issue is the almost daily post saying 'I'm an 18+ year old guy and I love Taylor! Is that weird?' And the 'I'm an 18+ year old guy and I'm going to see her show next month! Is anyone going to judge me?'. Nobody is going to judge you, she's the biggest popstar in the world right now, and you think you're the only adult male that likes her music?  And no, it's not weird if you're going to her show alone, nobody there will even notice you're alone. Go and check the show's thread and see to meetup with any other solo's."
TaylorSwift,3e3tdb,TARS-CASE,5,Tue Jul 21 20:41:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, you weren't kidding about r/arianagrande (first time checking out that sub too)  I'm personally okay with the state of the sub as is, but I do echo some of the other redditors here.  Covers are okay, but not when they are a blatant grab for views.  I wouldn't mind some moderation when it comes to the pics (tbh, not really here for that anways).  I just love coming here because everyone here is pretty much so awesome and welcoming and we all share the same love for T-Swizzle and her music!! <3"
TaylorSwift,3e3tdb,zealouszealot87,5,Tue Jul 21 20:17:12 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, this is one of the most respectful celebrity subreddits! And I love the fact that there's a community of Taylor appreciators that doesn't have an age average of 15 and younger."
TaylorSwift,3e3tdb,superr_rad,2,Tue Jul 21 20:51:50 2015 UTC,"It is one of the more respectful celebrity subreddits, however whenever the front page of reddit has a post about Taylor, this sub will be linked, bringing an influx of users who may not be as respectful, possibly assuming it's a subreddit similar to /r/ArianaGrande     A post like this is a good idea as it'll keep everyone on the same page. It's not as respectful as it used to be due to more people subscribing more recently and maintaining a high standard should be a goal to aim for."
TaylorSwift,3e3tdb,McBawse,9,Tue Jul 21 21:01:46 2015 UTC,"I've been happy with the moderators' response to the creepy comments I've flagged. They're quick and their judgment seems decent. For the most part comments just about how she's attractive seem to stay, while more detailed stuff gets deleted. My own standards lean toward more, rather than less, deletion of this stuff, but I think the current state of affairs is fairly representative of where the community is.  Going forward, if we start seeing more of this stuff, I'd be 100% on board with banning repeat offenders, and deleting more stuff. This should be a sub focused on Taylor and her music, rather than a bunch of dudes creepily talking about how they want to bang her. I think the current rule (No creepy comments) is sufficient, but if people find it too vague, it might be worth strengthening it to be clearer. As I said, I'd be in favor of being over rather underinclusive when it comes to defining creepiness. No one's heartfelt post about how much ""Enchanted"" means to them is likely to get deleted as creepy and if we lose some borderline comments about how pretty she is, I think that's a fair trade off for keeping the community focused."
TaylorSwift,3e3tdb,Bulgaroktonos,6,Tue Jul 21 20:04:12 2015 UTC,"I know this isn't something you brought up, but can we have a rule about not posting covers on here? I think remixes and mashups are fine, but I have an issue with covers. I completely understand that some of the people performing those covers are people who are definitely huge fans of Taylor Swift. That being said, there is a large portion of people that are just covering TSwift because they know it will get them a ton of views due to the fact that the song itself is already popular, and don't care that it's Taylor Swift at all. It just seems that everyone is trying to be ""the next big internet sensation"" by posting covers of popular songs to YouTube and are trying to become famous by using songs that are already written. I'm saying that mashups and remixes are ""okay"" because I think that they do require a lot of skill and talent to pull off. Yes, I do get that a lot of people post mashups to YouTube to get views the same way the people I mentioned above post covers, but I think that the people who take time to work out a mashup of Taylor Swift songs, have to enjoy her music even just a little bit. Just something to think about.  In regards to the other stuff, I hate that people sexualize Taylor the way that post you linked did. Generally, I hate when people sexualize women at all. Taylor Swift is a wonderful role model and I hate to see her reputation tainted with posts like that. I think people who are repeat offenders should be banned from the sub, solely because they seem to have more interest in her sexuality or body than her music and character. I think she's insanely beautiful as I'm sure those people who post that stuff do, and she's bound to be sexualized and flaunted somewhere, but there are already other subs where people can post that kind of stuff and I'd really prefer not to see it here.   EDIT: I actually really love this sub, I check it everyday and I really like that (mostly) everyone on here is so nice and welcoming, especially the mods. I love discussing her music and her personality and whatnot, and I'm thrilled this is a place where I can do it and not be made fun of. So overall, I'm very happy with the state of /r/TaylorSwift, I just thought I'd throw my two cents in on some stuff that had been bothering me."
TaylorSwift,3e3tdb,WhoseRiverIsItAnyway,3,Tue Jul 21 19:39:53 2015 UTC,"There's a subreddit for nearly every part of Taylor's body, as creepy and unnecessary as they are. However, if you want to ogle pictures, go to any of those subs or look elsewhere. This sub is a place for discussion and for other Swifties to just freely talk about one of their favorite artists.   New pictures that get released (photo shoots, tour photos, social media etc.) are fine. Reposting the same content just to sexualize her aren't welcome."
TaylorSwift,3e3tdb,SavoyRoad,5,Tue Jul 21 21:44:51 2015 UTC,"There's a fine line that's very, very hard to govern. When does a post become sexual and/or over-sexual?  I'm all for firm moderation. Really, given the way things are going (and given the size of the subreddit now), I'm in favor of the type of moderation that kenbw2 was suggesting months ago. The real concern there is just making sure it doesn't go full-on fascist, because of just how fuzzy the line is.  As-is, I lean more towards discussion and news than pictures. I have /r/TaylorSwiftPictures for that."
TaylorSwift,3e3tdb,alkanshel,2,Tue Jul 21 19:31:05 2015 UTC,"I am in agreement with what you've said. I'd also like to add that as responsible redditors we should be able to be a little more self-policing.  I generally don't like to downvote (because who am I to judge?!), but in this sub, I'm going to start using the downvote button on content posted without the intent of generating reasonably interesting discussion (ie: blatant reposts, paparazzi shots where Taylor has asked them to stop, or overly sexual pictures with obvious wink, wink headlines). This is all a personal choice, but maybe we can help by contributing our up/downvotes more consistently."
TaylorSwift,3e3tdb,MaenadsWish,4,Tue Jul 21 20:05:24 2015 UTC,"This sub, in my opinion, should be mostly used for discussions, news, music, articles relating to Taylor, social media posts, some pictures and videos, fan creations, and possibly funny posts relating to Taylor. (If anyone has any other ideas, please contribute)    Pictures for the most part should be posted to the dedicated pictures subreddit. However I feel there should be exceptions to this. New pictures are relevant and may be worth discussing in comments. This could be at events (Like this), photoshoots (like this), casual photos (like this).    I don't really think posting random pictures from Taylor during the Red Tour adds much to the subreddit, and should possibly be only allowed on Throwback Thursdays. (Thoughts on this? Agree/disagree?)  Sexuality in pictures is somewhat up to interpretation, in these cases the outfit and context should be looked at. For example, at the Victoria Secret show, this was a ""sexual"" outfit and context, which should be allowed. The one in the OP was at a gig and she was bending over because she was singing, which is clearly a non-sexual situation. (The Rolling Stone shoot is another example of sexuality which is okay because it's an official shoot. Pictures focusing on her butt while hillwalking should not be posted.)    A rule of thumb could be something like post as if Taylor is Taylurking here.    I'm not sure how easy it would be, or how much of a difference it would make but maybe a topic flair system could be implemented to tag Fanworks, discussions, news etc."
TaylorSwift,3e3tdb,McBawse,2,Tue Jul 21 20:56:37 2015 UTC,I definitely like your flair idea!
TaylorSwift,3e3tdb,WhoseRiverIsItAnyway,0,Tue Jul 21 21:55:42 2015 UTC,I guess while we're here I just wanted to bring up that i've seen plenty complaints and downvote wastelands in posts of covers and mashups. I am not bothered by them and I make mashups so I don't want them removed myself but I just wanted to say this might be the time to speak up if you're one of those that downvotes every comment in a mashup thread.
TaylorSwift,3e2nun,TheHarrisonKaye,11,Tue Jul 21 14:17:47 2015 UTC,"Let's get one thing straight. Wonderland is probably my favorite song from 1989, barely beating out clean.   Having said that, it doesn't even come close to beating All Too Well or Enchanted lol but yes wonderland is probably the best song on 1989 by far"
TaylorSwift,3e2nun,The_Shreckoning,2,Tue Jul 21 14:21:04 2015 UTC,"As far as well-written songs go, I don't think anything can compete with All Too Well or Enchanted. Those are in a league of their own. But Wonderland. Something about the way the song just is makes it my favorite. Maybe it's because the song perfectly describes my life at the moment because every single line hits home with me. Either way, it's definitely my favorite sounding song she's ever done."
TaylorSwift,3e2nun,zma924,0,Tue Jul 21 20:25:07 2015 UTC,Yeah its crazy. It's almost as if people have different tastes and preferences in music. Oh and making an alternative so noticeable to your real one is poor form.
TaylorSwift,3e2nun,The_Shreckoning,7,Tue Jul 21 17:08:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go as far as saying it's in my top three, but Wonderland is definitely up there as one of my favorites, and easily a stand-out on the album.    It's kind of sad it won't ever get much attention outside of other Swifties, but it makes it nice in that it'll be one of the album gems that not everyone hears, yet will blow them away when they finally do."
TaylorSwift,3e2nun,SavoyRoad,2,Tue Jul 21 17:25:03 2015 UTC,It's the one song she doesn't perform on tour though :/

Not my favourite song on 1989 (that'd go to Style or New Romantics) and definitely not my favourite song by her (I'd maybe,  maybe give that to Fifteen). I just find the song quite generic, with the heavy bass drop and stuff. I'm just into it.  But as you say, to each to their own."
TaylorSwift,3e2nun,i4NDR3W,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:28 2015 UTC,"I think Wonderland is a good song, but I would probably skip it if it came on shuffle. My favourites are probably Style, New Romantics, and Clean."

TaylorSwift,3dz5jy,lady_clover,2,Mon Jul 20 18:39:13 2015 UTC,"It's possible. She has ended up extending every headlining tour she's ever done. Generally, it's mostly US cities but she has added a couple international dates in the past, as well. I mean, I wouldn't get too excited because she might not return near you but there's a chance."
TaylorSwift,3dz5jy,YouVersusTheSea,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:30:12 2015 UTC,Thanks! If she doesn't then I'll be looking forward to the tour DVD at least :) I'm actually contemplating trying to get tickets at a show in the US or Aus but it would cost a bomb and I'm a student so probably not my best idea haha.
TaylorSwift,3dz5jy,SerGeorge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:08:18 2015 UTC,I am in exactly the same situation. I was lucky enough to get tickets to see her at Radio One's Big Weekend. But I was going to glastonbury so going to Hyde Park wasn't an option. I am seriously considering going to Toronto to see her which is even more likely as one of my favourite bands Chvrches are in Toronto two days after her. But it would cost around £1500 at least depending on how long I stay.  I just wish she had done a non clashing with glastonbury date. I would pretty much travel to any European country if she added more dates.

I went to her 1989 concert in Jersey last weekend and I loved it. It was an amazing experience, I'm so glad I went. I knew I'd regret it if I didn't go. I had never been to a Taylor concert before and I wanted to be part of the 1989 experience since I missed out on the earlier tours.  So yes, go!

Taylors mom does most of the choosing and they choose from the entire venue. The best way to be chosen is to really stand out. However, I don't think large groups will have a good chance to get in because they only allow 30-35 people in. A 5 person group should be fine, I've seen pictures of groups that size in the loft.  I don't know how your seats being separate will affect you being able to get in but I have seen that pairs get chosen more often than single or groups of 3 plus.  Best of luck meeting her"

I supposed I could have asked for clarification on who 'senior staff' exactly entails (is Andrea, someone else haha) - but that's my understanding.  If you have stuff to give Taylor, obviously still go to TN so you can give it to Kevin/Sierra, and they can get it to her. I saw quite a few letters, books, and recipes. All really great stuff.

TaylorSwift,3dc7do,rubberduck1330,2,Wed Jul 15 20:50:53 2015 UTC,TN   What is TN? (If you dont mind me asking)
TaylorSwift,3dc7do,happy_nothlit,2,Wed Jul 15 16:02:38 2015 UTC,I think she means Taylor Nation
TaylorSwift,3dc7do,SergeantJezza,3,Wed Jul 15 16:04:46 2015 UTC,"TN is also a type of panel used in monitors, though largely obsolete in modern times due to the superior IPS."
TaylorSwift,3dc7do,Credskiz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:28:07 2015 UTC,"Obsolete? Not even close. These are the most common monitors to be produced due to the fact that IPS screens are harder and more expensive to produce for the gaming community since it doesn't support 144hz as easily as a TN monitor does. The TN monitor is by no means obsolete and if you ask me, won't be so in quite some time.   I would agree that it's superior in a day-to-day non-gaming persons life, but mostly because of the thin panel it gives. Had there only been IPS screens with 144hz frequencies on the market for a reasonable price, it would definitely have been superior.  EDIT: Typo and  What I'm saying, is that the gaming community of the world makes up for so many people that the TN monitor is not obsolete."
TaylorSwift,3dc7do,SergeantJezza,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:09:13 2015 UTC,"I'm sitting here viewing your comment on a reasonably priced 144hz IPS monitor myself, the Acer Predator.  It's also 1440p, and has g-sync. You might argue that £556 isn't reasonably priced, but for someone who uses a computer for several hours every day, I'd certainly say it is. There's also a 1080p version for £375.  TN is a niche product, especially since a TN version of my monitor is a mere £13 less, with all the same specs apart from panel type."
TaylorSwift,3dc7do,Credskiz,2,Thu Jul 16 13:15:52 2015 UTC,"I guess the term reasonable is very subjective, then. Seeing how my not over-the-top but still-can-run-most-of-games computer is just a little above the price of your main monitor. Anyways, the point of my comment was to say that the TN monitors were not obsolete. For just an example, the e-sports tournaments doing world-wide tourneys for at least CSGO use TN monitors. Haven't checked any League of Legends tournament in quite some time but they used TN monitors at least last I checked. Can't speak for now, though."
TaylorSwift,3dc7do,SergeantJezza,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:42:08 2015 UTC,"Yep, my full setup is somewhere around £2500. Here's a (bad) picture if you're interested.  The way I see it, I use the computer for at least 4 hours a day on weekdays, and at least 10 hours a day on weekends. So that's 5.71 hours per day on average. I'll probably keep this computer for at least 2 years, so that's 4168 hours in total. That's 1.67 hours per pound, or £0.60 per hour.  I can't think of any other form of entertainment that costs so little. Let's compare it to, say, going to the cinema. Let's say it costs you £15 to see a movie, and the movie is 100 minutes long - both of these estimates are generous, IMO.  That's £0.15 per minute, or £9 per hour - which is 1400% more than my estimate for gaming.  Of course, I didn't factor in the cost of games, but with many excellent F2P games on PC, as well as abundant Steam sales, it's negligible."

If you know Taylor Swift as a person at all, and when I say that I don't mean having met her I mean simply knowing her personality and the things she says and does you would know that she is not one to go about dissing or making anyone feel shitty..especially her fans. Infact she does quite the opposite, and encourages high self esteem, confidence and sense of worth in everyone who listens to her music.   It's just a song lyric that she thought would work, and it wasn't even written about any individual in particular at the time either. Even if she did have more interest in taller individuals can you blame her? She herself is taller than most guys."

It may not be my top favorite off of Speak Now, but I think it perfectly encapsulates the sound of the album.

TaylorSwift,3dbzx5,Salo06,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:49:53 2015 UTC,"One of my favourite parts of the song, the part that initially got me hooked on it, is that way that she sings the word ""pastel"" in the line: ""I sneak in and see your friends, and her snotty little family all dressed in pastel"". I love the way she sings that.  I also really like the prechorus: ""This is surely not what you thought it would be""  I think her voice in this song is so soft and perfectly suited to the feel, the instrumentation, and the lyrics. It all melds perfectly together to create a beautifully written and composed song.  Her entire Speak Now album is just incredible, I had never listened to Taylor Swift before two weeks ago but I have listened to nothing but her since then and I'm well and truly hooked on her music. She's brilliant. Her voice in the live version of Speak Now is so on point and powerful in every song that it gives me chills. It's genuinely a perfect album and an even better Live album."
TaylorSwift,3dcyfx,TaylorSwiftfannnn,2,Wed Jul 15 08:11:45 2015 UTC,I'm happy that she thinks that the Netherlands is an important market and that she had a concert here even though the venue is so small compared to her US stadium venues. The movable stage was just as long and went as high as the venue!
TaylorSwift,3dcyfx,LiftSkywards,0,Thu Jul 16 04:25:05 2015 UTC,"Genuine question, why does she do these advertisements? She doesn't need the money or the publicity, and it's a Dutch station so she's not trying to promote her favourite station.  Any ideas?"
TaylorSwift,3dcyfx,kenbw2,11,Wed Jul 15 08:30:17 2015 UTC,"Her international sales figures are pretty light in comparison to US sales. She doesn't need the publicity in the US but she definitely could use it in Europe.      For example, the Dutch Top 40 charts show that all 4 of her singles from 1989 have charted in the Netherlands: ""Shake It Off"" - 13 wks in Top 40, peak position #5 ""Blank Space"" - 12 wks in Top 40, peak position #17 ""Style"" - 7 wks in Top 40, peak position #22 ""Bad Blood"" - 3 wks in Top 40, peak position #33      But compare those numbers to her USA numbers for the same singles: ""Shake It Off"" - 33 wks in Top 40, peak position #1 ""Blank Space"" - 23 wks in Top 40, peak position #1 ""Style"" - 17 wks in Top 40, peak position #6 ""Bad Blood"" - 7 wks in Top 40, peak position #1       Now, the higher USA numbers make sense because America is the largest music market in the world and she's an American artist. However, the Netherlands is still the 11th largest music market in the world. It's the 4th largest music market in Europe. In 2014, the Netherlands saw an increase in album sales of 2.1%, compared to 2013. The USA also had a 2.1% increase in 2014. Germany's (largest EU market) bump was 1.9%. The UK (2nd largest EU market) lost 2.8%. France (3rd largest EU market) lost 3.4%. Italy (5th largest EU market) lost 4.1%. Basically, the Netherlands had the highest growth rate in album sales for the top 5 European music markets last year. For further context, consider that the USA population is 319m people and the Netherlands population is 17m people... and both countries saw album sales growth at the same rate in 2014. It makes sense for her to want to do some promo in that region to help boost her profile, considering industry growth over the last year and how much room she still has to improve her numbers there.      Also, Amsterdam is only like an hour long flight from Norwich, which is where that Radio 1 Big Weekend festival was in May. She likely recorded a bunch of these bumpers/promos for radio stations in Europe to be played in the lead up to that show because it helps promote her as an artist.      It's just one more piece to the marketing plan for the album and tour. It doesn't matter if it's her ""favorite station"" or not. Generally, an artist will go into a studio for a day and just kick out a ton of these things in one go and then they're done with it for the year. They just get a list of Top 40 call signs for certain markets and crank out several of these ads in the studio at once and then her label sends them out to the appropriate stations. She honestly may have never listened to this station in her entire life... It doesn't matter whatsoever. They don't get paid to do them directly, but name recognition helps get more airplay and more airplay helps sell more albums and concert tickets. If you're in a top market, especially one that saw an increase in album sales last year, you're going to want to exploit that region for all you can and these stupid things help do that."

We had won tickets that day in the pit, but were hanging out on the outside having a drink before we went in since they didn't allow food/drinks in there.  They were telling us about how they have gotten the upgrade tickets and were heading back up to talk to y'all since they had given you and your daughter the other tickets.  They were SO excited to be able to give y'all the tickets.  So neat to find this story!  It made me feel good about kids these days.  Everyone seems them as entitled, selfish, etc., but these girls were truly the opposite of that.  They told us that Monday night was the first time they had met in person.  They had just been online friends through Tumblr for 2 years prior, and their moms worked it out for them to meet and come to the concert together.  Such a wild story.  So glad that you and your daughter had a great time at the show!  I wish I knew of a way to get the article to the girls!"

To put it into perspective, my last three concerts were Bob Dylan, Pearl Jam and Sigur Ros. But I also straight up love 1989 more than maybe any album of the 2010s.  So, I put a thing on Facebook saying, ""Serious:  Who wants to go see Taylor Swift with me in a couple months? I'm going by myself if I have to"" I got a couple ""lol really why?"" type replies but I also got a few ""I'll go"" replies. Made some plans with the first person who wanted to go. So, if it's possible to get tickets still, try that.  If not, go there and have fun anyway. I've been to a couple concerts by myself and people don't pay too much attention to anyone else anyway. I would assume a bunch of people our age are going with kids and people will assume you're just a parent.  If they have a problem, screw them."
TaylorSwift,3dckdb,Boofpatrol,7,Wed Jul 15 07:05:37 2015 UTC,Go for it! Wear a swiftie shirt and sing loud and proud to the songs. Maybe see if another one of your friends is remotely into Taylor and bring them along. There are lots of parents there so it probably won't be too difficult to make new friends at the show though. Have fun and don't be afraid to dance and sing your heart out!

Second, I came down from NYC for the DC show, and the only street level city picture Taylor put on the big screen (during a song) showed the building where I live. I couldn't believe it. The street's not famous at all but there it was, the exact place I'd just left."

So when she want on it for one of the songs (I Know Places iirc) and it wasn't rising/extending like it was supposed to. Then Taylor said to the audience ""I asked if it was kinda broken or fully broken...and it's fully broken! We'll just have to recoreograph the show from up here!"" And ""I can assure you this isn't planned. And I'm not going to pretend like it is 'cuz it's not"".  Then the stage people finally got it to lower. She wasnt able to get up on it again so she couldn't fly over the stage but it was still a great show!"

In Cleveland, at one point, I could see her motion to the guy who controls the catwalk to take it down. And then in Pittsburgh, at the end of the surprise performance with Little Big Town, Taylor had to motion and mouth ""take us down"" to the guy. I blame the Decepticons. The computer that controls the catwalk has the Optimus Prime logo on it when not being used. Clearly the Decepticons sabotaged the computer out of spite."

She did this in both Detroit and Cleveland. A group of 8 or 9 year old girls marching around the concourse in Cleveland chanting ""Taylor Swift rocks!"" In Cleveland Vance Joy covered Sam Smith's ""Stay With Me"" and prefaced by saying he had just learned it and wasn't sure he could hit every note so he encouraged the crowd to sing along. Sure enough, his voice cracked at one point. The crowd sang the rest of the line for him. Two people on the floor in Cleveland wore complete fox costumes. I saw people dressed as pegacorns at all three shows. After Taylor finished singing ""Clean"" in Cleveland, she kind of laughed and said (paraphrasing) ""that's a sad song, but you guys have been so loud I couldn't stop smiling the whole time!"" Her concert in Cleveland was the day before the NBA Finals started, which the Cleveland Cavaliers were in. The big slogan for the Cavs has been ""All In"" all season. Several times during the concert, Taylor asked the crowd ""are you all in Cleveland?"" Then at the end of the show, her guitarist, a Cleveland area native, came out in a LeBron James jersey. In Pittsburgh, while introducing the Enchanted/Wildest Dreams performance, smoke from the smoke machines kept wafting right in front of her. She make a joke about it then waited a couple seconds for the smoke to die down. The stadium in Pittsburgh is on a river. The light up wristbands could be seen from across the river. During the surprise performance with Little Big Town in Pittsburgh, a crew member came out and tossed a couple beachballs into the crowd on the floor. Also, her dancers had bathing suits and paddles. Before the concert in PIttsburgh, one of her dancers came over to the B-Stage pit and took a quick Snapchat video with us."

TaylorSwift,3d76ih,adambakkam,14,Tue Jul 14 01:30:31 2015 UTC,"Freaking amazing. Seriously one of the best concerts I've been to. It's an immersive experience, really easy to get into it. Experiencing a crowd of 50k people singing the same song, is pretty freaking awesome. Also the wristbands, oh my goodness the wristbands make the experience 10 times better because you want to interact with the music as it lights up. If I could financially I'd go to every show even though they don't vary much. The special guests are excellent, and the stories Taylor tells as she goes from one section of the set to another help create a story. Also the catwalk is pretty sweet."

I could totally see him coming on stage to rap his verses during the song. That would be insane!  It would be awesome to see Kanye West too just because of the history they have, and how they're friends now. You can tell they respect each other now. However, I don't really know what song Kanye and Taylor would sing together. Maybe FourFiveSeconds?

TaylorSwift,3czzy9,terp02andrew,3,Sun Jul 12 19:22:33 2015 UTC,"If you aren't planning on using it 24/7 you can keep the little plastic tag that disconnects the battery. I put it back in after the show, and just pull it out whenever I'm a bit bored.  EDIT: Oops, I read it wrong, it seems like you already went to the concert. Maybe you could find a bit of plastic that slides into the slot? That would at least increase the time you can use it."

TaylorSwift,3czzy9,edwinhai,2,Sun Jul 12 13:41:28 2015 UTC,Now I know why you would want to keep them.
TaylorSwift,3czzy9,AceMeepsm,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:46:32 2015 UTC,well during the concert they go into a certain mode which doesn't end untill the concert is over(they send a signal to end it I assume) if you leave the concert early it will forever be in the concert mode and you can't manually make it light up :/

Look at photos later on the internet taken by professionals. Even photos will suck unless you are the first in the line, and even then the angle will be too low to capture anything significant. If you're in the middle or towards the end, unless you have the 41MP Lumia 1020, you won't be able to see much because it will be to far therefore too small.

I actually still watch my Speak Now tour videos - I shot a great video of ""Last Kiss"" on the B-stage at Verizon Center in 2011. This is with a consumer 'travel-zoom' with a tiny 1/2.3"" sensor haha.

Yes, MMP sucks as a venue. But what we get depends on not what Taylor wants or even approves, but how good a job her tour promoters do. In her case she is working with the best company in the business, and they apparently could not get NRG Stadium for any dates that worked. I trust you know that there is a chance if the Astros make the playoffs that Ms. Swift may not even be able to play at MMP. It is clear that Taylor does not want to play multiple nights at small venues. She still does that in LA, but this tour skips New York and Madison Square Garden, for example. Toyota Center in Houston is tiny compared to the latest big arenas. For the Red Tour the capacity was only 12,467, and the set for the 1989 Tour appears to be even larger. MMP gets her nearly three times that many seats. Its a very tricky business that depends very little on what you and I want..."

For 1989, I'll be seeing her at the Georgia Dome which has a capacity upwards of 80,000 so I'm expecting it to be way different from the previous shows I saw.  But it does seem like a baseball stadium would be an odd setup and a lot of people would have a terrible perspective compared to tickets they would have for the same price at a basketball or football arena."
TaylorSwift,3cz3xq,C-Jammin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:35:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw Speak Now and Red in a basketball arena (Verizon Center) - that wasn't bad at all.  The move to Nationals Park just seemed like a dilution of the experience for greater crowd capacity. And because of it, far fewer will have good seats now. At Verizon Center, if you were in the lower bowl, your view was generally pretty good. And indoor arena seating scales very well vertically - which is key if you aren't 6'6+ (and can see over crowds) and don't want to be standing the whole time."

TaylorSwift,3cz4tt,Tuvok-,10,Sun Jul 12 02:34:14 2015 UTC,"I hope they do a DVD/Blu-Ray for the 1989 tour, still bummed they didn't do one for the Red tour. Maybe videos will be allowed once the tour comes to an end?"
TaylorSwift,3cz4tt,lastwordspoken,4,Sun Jul 12 02:56:29 2015 UTC,"I'm also still so bummed there's no ""Red"" DVD :( Tickets for that tour went on sale and sold out so quickly I never got a chance to go, but I would have LOVED to see the show. It's still my favorite Taylor album. So, while I hope there's a 1989 DVD/Blu-Ray, I almost hope more that ""Red"" still materializes, somehow."
TaylorSwift,3cz4tt,MissyBee37,4,Sun Jul 12 06:53:12 2015 UTC,"YouTube red tour Newark NJ. Excellent quality, whole concert split up by song (they're numbered)"
TaylorSwift,3cz4tt,sloth2,2,Sun Jul 12 08:29:39 2015 UTC,She played in Newark? I thought only Metlife?
TaylorSwift,3cz4tt,pimorules,2,Sun Jul 12 09:13:43 2015 UTC,I'm referring to Red tour where she played at both :) this tour was just metlife
TaylorSwift,3cz4tt,sloth2,2,Sun Jul 12 15:19:23 2015 UTC,I didn't know she played Prudential for Red Tour. I only went to the Metlife show :P
TaylorSwift,3cz4tt,pimorules,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:25:06 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah she did! I didn't go, not from that area, but I did notice she did Prudential in March (one of the first few shows) and then Metlife in the summer."
TaylorSwift,3cz4tt,sloth2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:58:44 2015 UTC,1989 is even more successful and popular than Red.  1989's the album that got people who hated Taylor to like her and those who were already fans love her even more.  From a business standpoint it would be incredibly dumb not to do a tour dvd/blu ray.
TaylorSwift,3cz4tt,MissyBee37,6,Sun Jul 12 03:01:31 2015 UTC,"I don't blame you for being frustrated. Personally I am avoiding tour material this time around because I do have tickets to see it in September and I want to be surprised, but I think it's sad for people who will never get to go that this is the case. I'm not surprised, though, given her views on Spotify and how quickly things like audio videos and lyric videos are taken down, as well.   I can certainly understand her principles to a degree, but I do think the money argument is a little bogus. No one who was going to pay money to see the tour was ever going to watch it on YouTube anyway; online videos are a way for fans who would not have a chance to see the tour to enjoy a glimpse of it — OR, like you said, to see unique parts of other locations. Experiencing the tour live is an entirely different, well, experience than simply watching it online. I think it's ridiculous to think having access to fans' low-quality YouTube videos would be enough to discourage someone from going if that person was going to attend the tour otherwise. I wish, for your sake and all others who won't get to go, that there could be videos online for you :( I was heartbroken I didn't get to see ""Red,"" and I appreciate the online videos as they're the only way I have to see any of it."
TaylorSwift,3cz4tt,SergeantJezza,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:59:22 2015 UTC,"In addition to what you said, there is the legal argument that they don't really own a video someone took of the tour, at least if it took place in a public area. This only applies in Europe though, I don't know about elsewhere."
TaylorSwift,3cz4tt,ramblingasian,3,Sun Jul 12 11:21:40 2015 UTC,Unfortunately the legal argument falls short since she's only played in one public area so far this tour.
TaylorSwift,3cz4tt,fifteen13,2,Sun Jul 12 11:54:46 2015 UTC,Nope lol.

TaylorSwift,3cul63,noel-13,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:55:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that's the cause of her being top charts internationally too, because her lyrics are relatable and easy enough for many people to understand.   I also wanted to say that while it's true she writes to/for her swifties,  some of her best songs (IMO of course) are those ones that feel written with a lot of feelings, for her and by her, like Enchanted."
TaylorSwift,3cuuyn,CMDR_Squashface,8,Fri Jul 10 23:32:56 2015 UTC,"I'd say definitely, I'm a guy and a big Taylor Swift fan. Obviously gender doesn't matter at all. I saw her little over 2 weeks ago when she played her UK show in Manchester and I thought it was fantastic. The atmosphere was amazing, the crowd were amazing and me and buddy got talking to some really nice fans. I'm a huge fan of metal and have never in my life paid to see a ""mainstream artist"". I'm the dude who goes to local shows to support local bands and all that good stuff. But trust me if you go in with a mindset that you'll enjoy it then you shall!"
TaylorSwift,3cuuyn,Heyferg,4,Fri Jul 10 23:56:30 2015 UTC,"As a person who has been to a lot of metal shows and underground dive bars. It's likely to be one of the most over the top productions you've ever seen. It's not a concert, its an event. You're not going to find yourself bored.  Please come back after the show we'd love to hear your experience!"
TaylorSwift,3cuuyn,rootchino,2,Sat Jul 11 00:53:50 2015 UTC,She puts on a good shows. Engages with the audience. And has good music. You will enjoy.
TaylorSwift,3cuuyn,iJeffwuh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:31:31 2015 UTC,"I'm into old school and some new punk mostly and though I'm not what you'd call a fan, I find her to be good at what she does and think she's a wonderful person. But I'm worried whether it'll be fun for me and going I won't be a downer to my wife who is practically exploding with excitement. We have seats right in front of the B stage. Is she entertaining for non fans?"
TaylorSwift,3cuuyn,KittenKingSwift,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:35:07 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say she would put on the best show for an outsider. her bands instrumentals will be basically non existent this show and 70% of the fans will be singing every song - even if she sings off key (she has gotten better in each show I've been to since fearless) you won't be able to hear it that well. oh well
TaylorSwift,3cuuyn,lastwordspoken,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:47:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am mostly into punk/indie/pop-punk/rock.. but I am a huge Taylor Swift fan and did both nights in Philly. Even if you're not into the music, there is still quite a bit of the entertainment factor."
TaylorSwift,3cuuyn,cantofunebre,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:54:22 2015 UTC,"If you're familiar with her songs at all (which you probably are by this point), you'll have fun. I normally listen to stuff like la dispute, letlive, devil wears prada, touche amore, between the buried and me, and the fearless and red tours were two of the most fun nights I've had out at shows."
TaylorSwift,3cuuyn,bada-dada,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:12:01 2015 UTC,"I've brought a few people with me to her shows over the years, and my mom asked to see the last one. It's not quite the same as being a punk fan, but as someone who isn't generally Taylor's target demographic it's similar.   The one thing she had to say after the show was that she is an entertainer at heart. Aside from a great set list, she knows how to engage and work the audience, put on a multifaceted show, and I guarantee you won't be bored. Also, the atmosphere is always insane."
TaylorSwift,3cuuyn,taylorgrande,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:09:55 2015 UTC,yes. her show is so entertaining. she goes all out. think: pyrotechnics and fireworks.

TaylorSwift,3cvxqh,i4NDR3W,0,Sun Jul 12 20:15:03 2015 UTC,"In a way, yes. The lyrical topic drew me in, the optimistic music and the lyrics somewhat contrast the action.  Plus, it was the perfect beat, so I didn't have to edit the trailers too much."
TaylorSwift,3cvxqh,i4NDR3W,3,Sun Jul 12 20:36:13 2015 UTC,I just don't think the upbeat feel goes well in the Mad Max universe.

TaylorSwift,3cstvi,GoldenGateKeeper,3,Fri Jul 10 16:49:48 2015 UTC,"Really?! Oh my goodness I hadn't even heard of that. I'll have to search for it.

There's a point when you get so wealthy that you'll never be able to spend that money even if you tried. So sharing with the less fortunate is amazing."
TaylorSwift,3cstvi,DonGeronimo,3,Fri Jul 10 17:41:35 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you really tried, you could. Her net worth should be around 200M.

Just saying ""because he's Kanye West"" is like saying ""because I said so""  lol I really isn't a valid reason. I don't care for him because he is in the media so much and seems to be full of himself however I have no opinion of him musically because I honestly only know like two of his songs."

TaylorSwift,3cno43,BilingualBeatdown,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:23:28 2015 UTC,"Especially when the music market has changed so much in those ten years.   To be fair, she did withdraw from those changes, which will have boosted her album sales"
TaylorSwift,3cno43,kenbw2,3,Thu Jul 9 18:50:29 2015 UTC,"She's one of only a handful of artists with the pull to make that work for her.  The great majority have very little choice to leave Spotify.  So few people buy albums anymore, there's no other way to monetize the music other than performances & streaming services."
TaylorSwift,3cno43,TommBomBadil,3,Thu Jul 9 20:48:33 2015 UTC,"And in fairness, Taylor has always been very good at the business side of things, and to reach that level, you either have to be, or hire people who are."

TaylorSwift,3cno43,sir_dr,10,Sun Jul 12 03:51:46 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely. She is the premiere song writer of the generation. I don't think anyone with such an impact will disappear in just 20 years. 20 years ago was 1995 and it's not exactly hard to name acts from then, not to mention artists generally have longer staying power now because of social media etc."
TaylorSwift,3cno43,McBawse,-4,Thu Jul 9 16:57:09 2015 UTC,"There are a great many big acts from the 90's which are not on the radio very often if at all anymore.   They stopped making new music and their old stuff has lost its shine as people move on to newer artists.  I think Taylor Swift is a great talent, but she's not a Beatles or Michael Jackson - level songwriter.  Her songs seem a bit formulaic & not really timeless.  I think some of them wouldn't be big hits if it weren't for her amazing singing talents.    Just IMHO."
TaylorSwift,3cno43,TommBomBadil,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:24:39 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, but early Beatles music was some of the most formulaic stuff, ever. Yeah, it was innovative, but from a lyrical standpoint, it was quite banal.  I think Taylor's skill is genuine appeal to the audience and the way she connects to her fans. Her songwriting skills are definitely great, but her personality enables to do as well as she does."

I don't listen to a lot of modern pop but I love Justin Timberlake, Beyonce, Lorde and Kanye West, and other pop artists/songs here and there.

You’re my friend and mentor, and I will always feel an unwavering loyalty to you for that reason.   Love this. Being a fan of Taylor Swift means being unapologetically yourself.

Also go to their website for the write in contests. I cannot afford 400$ for tix for me and my gf. As I am only 20 and have bills and rent...

TaylorSwift,3caah1,coscorrodrift,8,Mon Jul 6 09:38:53 2015 UTC,"I don't have a playlist, but I do have some suggestions! There's a mixture of both ""sad"" songs and ""happy"" songs here, so I hope you don't mind. I'd go for 'Style' (late-night driving, headlights, midnight, an obvious choice), 'This Love' (soft and ambient, melancholy at dusk, more for when you're driving on your own than when you're with company.. or at least I think so. It's more enjoyable that way.) 'Breathe', for times when you're driving away from something you had to let go, and you need a song that sounds like coming home. 'New Romantics', 'Holy Ground', 'Fearless', 'Sparks Fly', 'Stay Stay Stay', 'How You Get The Girl' -- for feel-good greatness and days where you're driving your friends to the beach or you're feeling upbeat and you need songs to match your mood.  Also, I would include some of my personal favourites like Treacherous (ahhh the bridge where it's like Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will get you, get you alone-- like damn Taylor's songs are so perfect for driving) Safe and Sound, and Last Kiss. I hope this gave you some ideas! :)"
TaylorSwift,3caah1,urdeadcool,5,Mon Jul 6 10:47:42 2015 UTC,"Those are some great suggestions! A few other ones that could work would include State of Grace, The Story Of Us, Bad Blood (album version), or Girl At Home."

TaylorSwift,3caah1,batmanifesto,2,Mon Jul 6 22:26:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I listen to 22 at least 2 times a day. It's my ""relax and freedom"" song. Also ""We Are Never Ever Going Back Together"" when I think about school."
TaylorSwift,3caah1,MissyBee37,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:42:43 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought about full albums, but it actually makes more sense. Put the CD in and hit play. Red is a good driving album, and 1989 is too."
TaylorSwift,3caah1,lastwordspoken,2,Mon Jul 6 23:01:39 2015 UTC,"I prefer Taylor's slower and/or angrier songs for driving. I like her songs that make me think or carry my mind away while I'm driving — bonus points if I can scream/sing along i.e. the angrier ones! ""Mean"" and ""Dear John"" are therefore two of my absolute favorites for driving because I love to put them on repeat and sing along as loud as I can. They serve as a great distraction for a long drive!   Along the slower vein, I love ""All Too Well"" and ""Wildest Dreams"" like you mentioned, as well as ""State of Grace"" (I prefer the slow, bonus disc version for driving), ""Treacherous,"" ""I Almost Do,"" ""Never Grow Up,"" ""Last Kiss"" and ""A Place in this World."" I like the way these songs tell a story or set a particular mood that's so immersive that I can get lost in the music and not be bored with a long drive.  My favorite happier/upbeat Taylor Swift songs when I'm driving are ""Fearless,"" ""Sparks Fly,"" ""Red,"" ""Holy Ground,"" ""Blank Space"" and ""Shake It Off."" I'm not sure why for these except they're just fun; they make me want to dance while I'm driving.  ""Style"" is maybe, though, her best driving song, just because of the driving references and the way the guitar drives the song!"
TaylorSwift,3caah1,Swift_Elephant,2,Mon Jul 6 20:55:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed! Great list you made there. I like her storytelling songs too because it feels like a sung radio show, pretty immersive.  And Style is getting consensus, so it must be because of something."

In Philly Night 1 she sang Cool Kids with Echosmith, and Night 2 she sang Fight Song with Rachel Platten.  She sings the album version of Bad Blood, not the Kendrick version. Since you said one week I assume you're going to MetLife Stadium, I would be surprised if she doesn't have a guest but it will be a later concert because Haim is also opening for her."

She said different things Friday in Philly than she did in Saturday. Sure it may have been the same idea but it isn't exactly the same and that's so cool to me. Especially after seeing some artists year after year and it's still the exact same schitck. For example, Green Day.

TaylorSwift,3br3s8,redlipstick1989,11,Wed Jul 1 20:03:21 2015 UTC,How the hell are they creepy as shit? There are much creepier comments on here. All I said was that I heard she smelled nice and that I'll like to know what she smells like. That is all.

TaylorSwift,3br3s8,WolfofAnarchy,26,Wed Jul 1 21:07:16 2015 UTC,What's so creepy about recognizing that she smells good?   Don't you all act like you would not take a good sniff of Taylor Swift.
TaylorSwift,3br3s8,iJeffwuh,4,Wed Jul 1 15:29:19 2015 UTC,I know people are obsessing over that remark about her smell. Goodness. I personally have never given any thought to her scent but to each his/her own.
TaylorSwift,3br3s8,mrmerrbs,-1,Wed Jul 1 19:02:50 2015 UTC,"It's the fact that normal people don't really notice how someone smells unless it's in some way bad or very strong.  Or if it's perfume, they should comment on her choice of perfume.  This is because you have to get very close to someone in order to smell them, often invading their personal space.  That is why it's creepy. Honestly the only people I would not feel the least bit creeped out about commenting on my scent would be the girls I've slept with/dated. I just find it weird to say that even after hugging a friend, but slightly less weird if there's flirting involved."
TaylorSwift,3br3s8,trebory6,3,Wed Jul 1 22:21:27 2015 UTC,"He was taking a picture with her. That's plenty close to smell her. Now if he said that to her at the time that she smelled nice, that would be a little creepy. A unique scent is very memorable. You're taking in a lot when in a situation like meeting a celebrity. There is nothing weird about making that comment."
TaylorSwift,3br3s8,iJeffwuh,10,Thu Jul 2 00:37:20 2015 UTC,"LOL @ all the people calling out his 'smelled amazing' comment. Soooo many people on Tumblr who got into Loft 89 talked about the way Taylor smelled. Geeze, give the guy a break, he could've said a lot weirder/creepier things."
TaylorSwift,3br3s8,holyshitnuggets,12,Thu Jul 2 01:24:27 2015 UTC,"I've read numerous personal accounts of people meeting her from both genders that also comment on how she smells. I'm assuming people are saying it's creepy since he's a guy, but I've seen plenty of girls say the same thing. If you smell good, you smell good. Not sure why a compliment is being criticized so much but I for one would appreciate it if someone made that comment to me. People don't usually put on perfumes and colognes for themselves, so to have someone recognize that bit of effort you put in in the morning seems pretty damn awesome in my book."
TaylorSwift,3br3s8,tempestorion,-1,Thu Jul 2 01:22:00 2015 UTC,No it's creepy from both sexes.

I simply noticed that she smelled very good when standing next to her and hugging her, much like you would notice your significant other smelling like good perfume if you were hugging him/her...or much like a creepy uncle smelling like whiskey and/or cheese puffs when he hugs you."
TaylorSwift,3br3s8,Sleela17,3,Thu Jul 2 21:38:12 2015 UTC,"I really think people are overreacting. Honestly almost every loft 89 story I've read mentioned that she smells good and this is the first time I've seen anyone freaking out about it. It's not a weird thing to notice about a person or to comment on, IMO."
TaylorSwift,3br3s8,redlipstick1989,-12,Thu Jul 2 00:06:41 2015 UTC,"It's not a normal compliment to make publicly about someone you met for a minute during a meet and greet.

TaylorSwift,3btqy4,Darthvire,4,Thu Jul 2 02:04:24 2015 UTC,"T comes before DD, as the letters start repeating. T would be closer to the front. The only way DD would be better would be if it was closer to the catwalk via seat placement. So if seats went left to right 1-40, and they were to the left of the stage, DD40 would probably be better than T1 if it got you physically closer to the catwalk."
TaylorSwift,3btqy4,kpattzbaby,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:04:45 2015 UTC,Thanks! Do you know if the seats start at 1 on either side of the catwalk?
TaylorSwift,3btqy4,kpattzbaby,2,Thu Jul 2 12:32:33 2015 UTC,"I can't be positive (so don't take my word as fact) but I would assume it's left to right and the numbering starts over for the two sides of the catwalk.

It will be an amazing experience and you will enjoy it, even though you're alone. I'm going to a concert alone in December and I will feel a bit weird when I arrive alone, but I would never want to miss the concert. You will have an amazing time and the only down part is that you don't have someone that you know to share the experience with right there. But you don't have time or a chance to talk during the concert anyway so after the concert, just come back to this subreddit and share your experience with us! And honestly, I don't think people will be freaked out by you, I think they'll will admire your courage and think you're awesome."

I've been wearing my ""TAYLOR SWIFT OR DIE"" shirt to shows lately, and I've met a few people that are going to be at the ATL date!

TaylorSwift,3bo4kl,heyitsme06,2,Tue Jun 30 19:51:24 2015 UTC,I would think that would be entirely dependent on the venue.
TaylorSwift,3bo4kl,jrobinson3k1,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:49:54 2015 UTC,Can you supply pics of where each would be? Generally pit though.
TaylorSwift,3bo4kl,sloth2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:26:04 2015 UTC,"I was in the B-Stage pit in Pittsburgh. The floor seats right on either side of the catwalk seemed better. You have a guaranteed seat, you don't have to get there early, and if you're right along the catwalk, you'll end up closer to her than you would in the B-Stage pit. There's actually a gap between the B-stage and B-Stage pit area."
TaylorSwift,3bo4kl,LLCoolD,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:37:36 2015 UTC,"While I haven't seen her in this tour, I was in the pit for the Red tour, and it seemed like it would be much cooler to be near the front stage. She didn't spend that much time on the other stage, and there's a lot going on on the main stage to look at that's really cool - professional dancers and all the props and stuff. I personally wouldn't swap if I were you."
TaylorSwift,3bo4kl,dontforgetpants,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:00:43 2015 UTC,GO WITH B-STAGE! B-stage pit has such a good view! I know plenty of people who have enjoyed it! I would've bought pit but it was just soooo expensive!
TaylorSwift,3bo4kl,suprstar16,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:14:23 2015 UTC,I'm thinking that I will. The only qualm I have is that if you leave the pit (which I know I will have to) then you lose your spot.

TaylorSwift,3bli1v,Dark_Fiber,0,Tue Jun 30 07:01:52 2015 UTC,"Yep. Since that lanyard is exclusive to the VIP ticket holders, eBay is probably your only chance of finding one. It's not surprising that Taylor Swift merchandise for guys is extremely limited. The majority of her fans are female and of the male fans that she has aren't very likely to buy an wear Taylor Swift shirts or other merch."
TaylorSwift,3bli1v,suprstar16,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:01:30 2015 UTC,Do you know if the red tour lanyard was exclusive because I see on her merch site it's up on sale there. Sorta hoping it becomes available after some time at this point I guess
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,cinnemazeia,19,Mon Jun 29 17:15:51 2015 UTC,I know places would make a pretty cool music video. It would be neat to have one of the 3 demos to be a single. It would found since they are on an album.
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,harmonyunoxx,2,Mon Jun 29 23:23:45 2015 UTC,Blank Space had a demo and it was the second single.
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,CassyCollins,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:38:39 2015 UTC,I meant as an the actually demo being the offical single. That would be neat to see it happen.

TaylorSwift,3bj35z,josh112233,32,Tue Jun 30 14:00:04 2015 UTC,"New Romantics - catchy, has commercial appeal, a 'bonus track' so has appeal in that it is still relatively unfamiliar perhaps to some fans who might be less inclined to be excited about a standard edition album track by now"
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,coscorrodrift,8,Mon Jun 29 17:17:28 2015 UTC,"This or Wonderland are my go-tos.  See this comment I made with a more in-depth opinion, it's not really well explained though."
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,bi-cycle,5,Mon Jun 29 18:12:57 2015 UTC,I think a video for wonderland pretty much writes itself.
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,pianoplayer98,3,Tue Jun 30 02:13:21 2015 UTC,Especially compelling because of its position on the setlist (not written to avoid spoiler)
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,alisonstone,2,Mon Jun 29 23:23:54 2015 UTC,"Also, I wonder if New Romantics will be on Apple Music. I know 1989 will be, but New Romantics is a bonus track. If it isn't, then releasing New Romantics would not interfere with single sales."
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,kagarcia,2,Mon Jun 29 19:44:54 2015 UTC,I would imagine it would be - all the deluxe tracks are available on iTunes.
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,liamsshaw,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:11:25 2015 UTC,Completely Agree! These are my two Favourite tracks on the Album!!!
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,w1ckizer,16,Wed Jul 8 18:20:53 2015 UTC,All you had to do was stay. Love that song
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,WhoseRiverIsItAnyway,10,Mon Jun 29 18:36:48 2015 UTC,LOVE this song. And IWYW. Two songs people don't seem to like on this sub.
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,wagswag,2,Mon Jun 29 19:52:54 2015 UTC,Easily the song that gets stuck in my head consistently.  Love love love that song.
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,wasubi1,14,Tue Jun 30 18:33:31 2015 UTC,Out of the Woods - an amazing and powerful song. Has potential for an aesthetically amazing video. Nice emotional/ballad-y contrast to Bad Blood.
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,WhoseRiverIsItAnyway,8,Mon Jun 29 17:19:16 2015 UTC,Already released as promotional single. :( But I still want it to be one of the next singles.
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,wasubi1,9,Mon Jun 29 18:51:40 2015 UTC,Being released as a promotional single doesn't indicate that it won't be released as a single. I Knew You Were Trouble was released as a promotional single for Red and incidentally became one of the biggest singles off that album.  But I do remember that she mentioned she didn't plan on releasing OOTW as a single for whatever reason.

TaylorSwift,3bj35z,suprstar16,3,Tue Jun 30 01:50:37 2015 UTC,I really hope it's wildest dreams honestly. And I seem to be the only one with that opinion. I think it would make an incredible music video. I think it would be precious.
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,adambakkam,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:41:13 2015 UTC,yeah the wildest dreams music video would be pretty cool
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,TBoy8498,10,Fri Jul 3 00:15:59 2015 UTC,New Romantics will most likely fetch her another no 1 single.  I think most of the ppl who already have the album might not have this song and buy it as an single. And it's one of the top 3 best song in the album.
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,holyshitnuggets,2,Mon Jun 29 18:34:11 2015 UTC,I think it should be either wonderland or new romantics.
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,1SkyPilot,2,Tue Jun 30 04:16:04 2015 UTC,"New Romantics or How You Get the Girl.   I may be biased because I don't particularly like Wonderland, but I definitely don't see it being on the radio."
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,rainbowsauce1,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:59:31 2015 UTC,"What exactly counts as a ""single""? - just a song that gets turned into a music video and becomes a radio hit? I see this term thrown around and I've never been exactly sure.   My next favorites are Out of the woods, I know places, and Wonderland. Maybe a remix of Out of the woods and I know places? They sort of go together.....foxes and woods :p."
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,taylor-swift13,2,Mon Jun 29 21:15:21 2015 UTC,a single is a song that is highly promoted and ends up on the radio. singles will usually have music videos made for them.
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,C-Jammin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:36:19 2015 UTC,"As already stated New Romantics would be a great single, but I also like How You Get the Girl it is super catchy and has that radio type appeal"
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,RawhlTahhyde,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:22:02 2015 UTC,"Wildest Dreams is probably my favorite song on the album, but I'm not sure it could be a hit pop song.  I think New Romantics or Wonderland would work really well for pop radio.  Maybe I Know Places, too."
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,Bucketofdreams,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:25:04 2015 UTC,Anything but New Romantics. I want it to be a secret. Also the songs seem sped up on the radio. I'd say How you get the girl feels very singley
TaylorSwift,3bj35z,suprstar16,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:00:16 2015 UTC,I'd vote Wildest Dreams /Enchanted remix. It was unbelievable at the live show

TaylorSwift,3bca41,Jerlko,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:05:25 2015 UTC,I wonder if those dudes behind them knew who they were...
TaylorSwift,3bca41,shy247er,3,Sat Jun 27 22:17:40 2015 UTC,They're not MF DOOM and Madlib. They're two of the most well known people in their fields.   Although I'd totally freak out if I saw MF DOOM.
TaylorSwift,3bca41,RollTide137,2,Sat Jun 27 22:26:43 2015 UTC,"They announced them in the arena and were on jumbotron several times, so yeah, it's safe to say that they knew."

No, they don't look like her, and it's a bit creepy. These women should find a hobby or something else to gain them attention."

TaylorSwift,3bc8d1,ashmagic487,2,Sat Jun 27 22:44:03 2015 UTC,No idea she was friends with Serena Williams.   Gunna be hard to top this group at any other show.

TaylorSwift,3bcnue,i4NDR3W,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:41:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily call it pretentious but I do agree that it was kind of weird. But knowing how much she cares about her fans, friends, band, and family, she probably likes to be around them during tour and stuff. Plus they are all models and celebrities that the fans may not have other opportunities to see them in person so maybe Taylor was thinking that she was offering one of the best concerts for her fans."

TaylorSwift,3b7olc,frostfromfire,8,Fri Jun 26 21:53:25 2015 UTC,This one took about 15 hours start to finish... Including the shopping for it & my little 1989 TS stick. My one for the red tour took about 20 hours
TaylorSwift,3b7olc,ACatWithThumbs,3,Fri Jun 26 22:14:44 2015 UTC,"Amazing job!  Given the amount of time you put into your costume, did you sew all of the sequins onto the coat individually?"
TaylorSwift,3b7olc,MidgetStomper10,6,Sat Jun 27 00:44:34 2015 UTC,no! Entirely made with a hot glue gun... (hot & heavy)
TaylorSwift,3b7olc,letsmakeart,3,Sat Jun 27 00:52:48 2015 UTC,"Haha!  Okay, that makes a lot more sense.  Individually sewing through every sequin hole probably would have taken more than 15 hours...though I honestly couldn't guess how long."

TaylorSwift,3b8n7u,HollowImage,14,Sat Jun 27 06:00:59 2015 UTC,"I am a huge sports fan and I hate the Super Bowl half time show with a fiery passion.   Every other game of the year has a set halftime length. Changing the length of halftime changes the flow of the game, can halt momentum, etc. Now you change the nature of the game itself on the SINGLE most important game of the year to revive aging careers and convince people Black Eyed Peas have talent but mostly to sell Pepsi and beer.   Taylor is just fantastic so I would make an exception."

TaylorSwift,3b8n7u,TheFearAndLoathing,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:33:01 2015 UTC,I'm pretty much just indifferent to the halftime show. I don't get why people make such a big deal and get so worked up over who's performing and how they did.
TaylorSwift,3b8n7u,m-torr,-3,Sat Jun 27 07:10:58 2015 UTC,I hate it from a sporting perspective. I also think that it is tacky and below Taylor!

And thats just the USA and not the entire world that will be screening the event.  Promoting your self, your music and your album to 114 million people domestically is not bellow anyone!"
TaylorSwift,3b8n7u,ShakeItOff1989,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:11:56 2015 UTC,They make a good point though in that the Halftime show isn't for the football fans. They're already there to watch the game. It's for the families of the football fans who would rather see a pop star for 15 minutes than an entire football game.   This is the perfect stage for her. She's one of the biggest names right now and it's the 50th anniversary of the Super Bowl.  I wouldn't mind seeing her perform
TaylorSwift,3b8n7u,HangLooseBro,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:54:57 2015 UTC,I love pop stars performing. I'd take Taylor or Katy or Beyonce over the geriatric Who or Rolling Stones or Madonna any day of the week.

TaylorSwift,3b8n7u,jaxx2009,2,Tue Jun 30 00:12:34 2015 UTC,Probably the only way to top last years show. Taylor Swift > Katy Perry.
TaylorSwift,3b8n7u,serenadingsirens,-11,Sat Jun 27 04:00:33 2015 UTC,Eh I've never seen a halftime show that I liked so I dunno if it'd like this.
TaylorSwift,3b8n7u,hannahjmcg,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:59:14 2015 UTC,Agreed. The halftime show is waay below Taylor. The show makes me lose respect for performers.   Then again I simply hate the halftime show as a football fan. It changes the flow of the most important game of the year and makes a general mockery of sporting in my very opinionated opinion.

It also aims to ""raise awareness about the prevalence and consequences of anti-LGBTQ bias and behaviour in America’s schools.""  As LGBTQ people have become more accepted in the mainstream culture more studies have confirmed that they are one of the most targeted groups for harassment and bullying. An ""analysis of 14 years of hate crime data"" by the FBI found that gays and lesbians, or those perceived to be gay, ""are far more likely to be victims of a violent hate crime than any other minority group in the United States"".   “As Americans become more accepting of LGBT people, the most extreme elements of the anti-gay movement are digging in their heels and continuing to defame gays and lesbians with falsehoods that grow more incendiary by the day,” said Mark Potok, editor of the Intelligence Report. “The leaders of this movement may deny it, but it seems clear that their demonization of gays and lesbians plays a role in fomenting the violence, hatred and bullying we’re seeing.”  Because of their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression, nearly half of LGBTQ students have been physically assaulted at school.   The campaign takes positive steps to counteract hateful and anti-gay speech that LGBTQ students experience in their daily lives in hopes to de-escalate the cycle of hate speech/harassment/bullying/physical threats and violence.

TaylorSwift,3b2zju,TweetPoster,16,Thu Jun 25 15:32:19 2015 UTC,It annoys me that streaming gets such bad press and no one seems to care that the labels are the largest problem with the music industry.
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,fuckqwop,-8,Thu Jun 25 21:36:18 2015 UTC,You're free to create your own label.
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,ltcxmr,5,Thu Jun 25 22:21:00 2015 UTC,I don't understand what you're trying to insinuate here.
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,fuckqwop,-12,Thu Jun 25 22:26:26 2015 UTC,You're placing blame on labels. Artists are free to create their own label or go without a label if they don't like what they are getting.
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,ltcxmr,9,Thu Jun 25 22:34:24 2015 UTC,"Good luck getting any decent publicity without the financial support of a label behind you without getting incredibly lucky, especially if you want to make it as a top 40 artist. My point with streaming is, the label is taking most of revenue earned by the artist from streaming. A lot of the contracts that artists are under did not take into account streaming when they were written, therefore artists don't see any of the money. Then the blame is placed on the streaming services rather than the main culprit which is the label."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,fuckqwop,5,Thu Jun 25 23:16:57 2015 UTC,"Good luck getting any decent publicity without the financial support of a label behind you without getting incredibly lucky, especially if you want to make it as a top 40 artist.    That's the whole point and reason why you pay the label so much. You either pay for their resources or try to reach the top on your own which as you said isn't easily done. Don't know why you are giving the labels such a hard time for succeeding at what the are paid to do. These artists choose to sign with these labels and know what they are getting into. Don't label them the bad guy when so many labels have done so much for artists."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,ltcxmr,2,Thu Jun 25 23:39:58 2015 UTC,Labels negotiate from a position of superiority. Labels have many artists who want to sign with them but the individual artist needs to label to compete.  Labels use this leverage to fuck over artists in their contracts.
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,Luminarii,0,Fri Jun 26 02:48:23 2015 UTC,Artists can choose not to sign with the label. How are you not understanding this? The major labels only exist because artists keep signing with them.    but the individual artist needs to label to compete.   Is the ability to compete an inherent quality of any artist?
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,ltcxmr,2,Fri Jun 26 03:11:53 2015 UTC,"The biggest labels can give them the best promotion etc which will allow them to compete. The label's promotion of an artist is a huge factor in their success. And artists continue to sign with the major labels because the biggest labels give them the best shot at becoming big even though the contracts they sign screw them over. They don't really have a choice. It's either sign with small label and likely not get anywhere, or take a pretty terrible contract with a big label and have a higher chance of becoming famous."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,Luminarii,-1,Fri Jun 26 03:24:41 2015 UTC,"It's still a choice though. No artist is simply entitled to their fame. They either have to have some luck or get some help. Those that want help with that choose to trade current profits for the help of a major label. Nothing wrong with that. If you make it big and get major publicity, then you create more avenues for profit after that instead of just selling albums. To say a label is ""fucking over"" artists by helping them achieve their goals and dreams is absurd. Yes, it's big business, but it's no different than other big business so we shouldn't expect them to not try and maximize their profits like everyone else is doing. Point still being that artists can say fuck you and walk away any time, so there's no reason to feel sorry for them."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,ltcxmr,0,Fri Jun 26 03:35:50 2015 UTC,"This was directed at the major labels. They're cheating artists streaming revenue because it's not in they're contracts, because when their contracts were written streaming wasn't a major platform. Instead of addressing this they point the finger at the streaming companies. This is stealing. I'm not saying all labels are like this, but it happens and it is an issue. Pretending this does not exist and placing the whole blame on streaming services will not help the situation."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,fuckqwop,0,Fri Jun 26 00:00:07 2015 UTC,"Yep. Labels tend to take ~90% of the money on average from streaming services.  They are ripping artists off here.  If a song gets 100,000 listens, an artist would be lucky to get 100$, while a label would typically pocket 5-600$  In a fair world it would be reversed."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,JTibbs,6,Fri Jun 26 14:56:56 2015 UTC,"In context with this announcement, is it not curious that 1989 is still not on Tidal?   http://www.inquisitr.com/2195008/why-taylor-swifts-1989-is-still-not-available-on-tidal/  http://nextshark.com/apple-is-under-investigation-for-allegedly-pressuring-taylor-swift-to-leave-spotify/  The Inquisitr piece links to NextShark...which then reveals that investigator were looking for that connection - but doesn't state that something was conclusively found.  Hmmm."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,terp02andrew,9,Thu Jun 25 15:48:09 2015 UTC,"As for why 1989 is not on Tidal, there could be business reasons. We don't know the terms of the contracts and exactly how much Apple is paying and how much Tidal is paying. They publish their payout ratios, but not the exact formula (more popular artists may get paid more, newer music may get paid more, etc). Also, Taylor could have gotten a special deal from Apple that nobody else knows about where she gets bigger payments. From an advertising standpoint, it would make a lot of sense for Apple to pay up. Also, 1989 has been out for a while now and album sales have dwindled down to the point where it may make sense to start streaming. Most of the people who would buy the album already has it.  We don't know that 1989 won't be on Tidal. Maybe Taylor will put it on all the paid streaming services at the same time. Apple Music is coming out in a week and she doesn't want to give another service a head start just to be nice to Apple (after all, they were nice to her in changing their mind).  I think at the end of the day, Taylor just saw that Apple is an good business partner. Apple has a pretty good history of being good business partners. They don't go out of their way to try to steal their partner's profits like some other companies do. In this case, it's obvious that Apple is not trying to get their cut of money from the music industry, they just want to funnel more people into the Apple ecosystem. Apple has more to lose by backstabbing the music industry for millions of dollars when the company is a $700+ billion company. They don't want the musicians to rally behind Google or another competitor because lost iPhone sales can hurt Apple while paying out a fair slice of the Apple Music revenue is irrelevant. This was never obvious with the other streaming services because the other services needed to make money. Apple can run Apple Music at break even or a loss and they'll still come out ahead via increased iPhone sales."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,alisonstone,3,Thu Jun 25 17:13:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I actually just checked Tidal for 1989, right when this story went live. Considering the recent departure of the interim CEO Tonstad (former Aspiro exec) this past Tuesday, Tidal is still in a formulation phase.  As for Apple music, I looked at the published numbers: http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6605845/apple-music-indie-publishers-contract   Apple's about-face offer to pay $0.002 per stream during the trial subscription, publishers, who had previously been expected to offer their songs rights for free, now anticipate being paid $0.00047 per stream based on figures giving labels 58 percent of revenue, versus publishers' 13.5 percent.   I don't have personal or professional knowledge of the industry, so I'm learning as this news develops. But that 2,128 streams to make $1. I have to wonder if this is really much of an improvement over what Spotify or Tidal or whoever is paying musicians these days :p  Anyway, seems this story is still continuing/developing.  I've written about this in the past, and I'm rather patient when it comes to drawing conclusions or making declaration on these developments. I interact with a tumblr account called AnalyzingTaylor - you might have heard of them haha."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,terp02andrew,2,Thu Jun 25 17:46:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's hard to see how this works out in the long run $1 for 2,128 streams during the trial period sounds like nothing, but Apple does have something like 800 millions user accounts (might be close to a billion by now) and most of them have active credit cards on file. Depending on how well Apple Music catches on, a very popular artist like Taylor could be looking at a billion streams within the first few days as a lot of the users would likely try it out during the free trial."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,alisonstone,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:38:34 2015 UTC,"Also, Taylor could have gotten a special deal from Apple that nobody else knows about where she gets bigger payments.   https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/614093248961847296   In case you're wondering if this is some exclusive deal like you've seen Apple do with other artists, it's not."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,CompteJetable3,2,Mon Jun 29 14:49:50 2015 UTC,"Apple probably wants to be the only service to have Taylor, just like The Beatles were exclusive to iTunes for a while."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,ltcxmr,11,Thu Jun 25 22:49:56 2015 UTC,So what was the issue with Spotify again? They don't pay artists enough for plays of their music? Does Apple pay significantly more?
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,Keith,26,Thu Jun 25 18:09:29 2015 UTC,"I think its because Apple Music is a paid service, I'd heard that she wanted 1989 to be available only on Spotify Premium and pulled her music when they wouldn't allow that."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,greenpm33,14,Thu Jun 25 19:18:04 2015 UTC,"I think this is it. She's not in favor of services with free tiers, because she doesn't believe ad revenue alone is enough to fairly compensate the artists involved (also, people block ads - so she has a point.)"
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,OhHiAndie,13,Thu Jun 25 19:47:18 2015 UTC,"Spotify runs independant of your browser, so as far as I know, you can't block ads."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,OhHey_BigZam,9,Thu Jun 25 22:20:02 2015 UTC,If you use play.spotify.com you can use the web version which has the ads blocked.
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,McBawse,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:31:08 2015 UTC,"Blocking ads is easy, even outside a web browser. There are many applications to do so with Spotify, or just write one yourself."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,SergeantJezza,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:53:09 2015 UTC,A simple Google search will show you many ways you can block ads. Lifehacker even has an article on it.
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,TSwizzle_13,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:34:56 2015 UTC,Which doesn't make sense to me. She allows her music to be played on terrestrial radio.
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,jrobinson3k1,9,Thu Jun 25 22:20:15 2015 UTC,You can listen to her full albums whenever you want on the radio? Or just her singles and only when they happen to come on and are also made available on Youtube anyway? Not to mention she does get royalties as well as a large amount of exposure to people who may not already be fans.
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,ltcxmr,2,Thu Jun 25 22:27:55 2015 UTC,"Yes it's different than the radio, but it's the exact same revenue model. Free content backed by ads. Which seems to be what she's complaining about. Her music is also on Youtube which you can stream on-demand, and is on Pandora. So, I just don't understand what her actual beef is with Spotify in particular."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,jrobinson3k1,4,Thu Jun 25 22:38:54 2015 UTC,"Withholding your songs from streaming won't stop you from topping the charts and getting #1 singles, withholding your songs from radio will prevent you from that. The benefits aren't comparable. Also, it's not at all a substitution for buying the album like streaming can be."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,ltcxmr,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:42:57 2015 UTC,You can't listen to a song whenever you want on the radio.  You have to wait for your favorite songs when they decide to play it or at the very most call in to make a request.  On Spotify you can listen to anything as many times as you want and the artist will get almost nothing.  Also radio is free publicity.  A radio station decides what they play and Taylor knows radio helped boost her career.  It gets you exposure.
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,Rockworm503,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:09:30 2015 UTC,"Youtube is on-demand, and Taylor has a music presence there. If it's just ""Spotify crosses the line because it's the full album, not just singles"", then I can understand that argument, though you as an artist are in control of what is put on Spotify so she could only put her singles on there."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,jrobinson3k1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:44:09 2015 UTC,I honestly don't even know what the argument is here.  Are you against Taylor taking her music off Spotify because she's on the radio?  I just don't even know what this is.  Spotify pays like .00000000003 parts of a cent for every time a song is streamed.  Thats like barely a dollar for 2 million streams.  You as an artist are jacked on there period.  Taylor did not take her music off Spotify for herself.  She did it for all the small artists who don't have a voice or a chance to be heard.  Thought this Apple thing was proof of that.  She's thinking about the little guys when she decides to put her music on these streaming things.  Having your music on the radio doesn't hurt you nearly as much as Spotify does.  Unlike Apple Spotify wont listen and pretend their fine with what?  8 billion dollars or something?  Its great for us poor music lovers but for the poor starving indie artists out there its terrible.
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,Rockworm503,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:27:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not against her doing anything, I'm just confused on her line of reasoning when there seems to be contradictions.  I guess you're just pulling numbers out of your ass, because Spotify actually pays artists $0.007 per play, which is $14,000 for 2 million streams. Compared to YouTube, which is $.002 per view, Spotify pays their artists 3.5x more (The number for YouTube actually varies wildly based on ads that are clicked rather than views, so I took the highest estimate I could find from Googling). I don't see her pulling out of YouTube to protect the ""little guys"", which is one reason I perceive a contradiction.  Furthermore, Apple Music is paying their artists $0.002 per play during the trial period, which is again 3.5x less than what Spotify pays, making her reasoning more suspect. Money can't be the only reason Taylor doesn't want to play on Spotify when there's other services that she does play on that pay substantially less.  She has said before that things of worth shouldn't be free, insinuating people shouldn't be able to play music without forking over some dough. But that still doesn't explain why her music is on YouTube or why she's now seemingly okay with Apple Music being free for 3 months, or why she's okay with Apple Music paying less than Spotify during their trial period."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,jrobinson3k1,0,Fri Jun 26 17:52:41 2015 UTC,"I think YouTube pays far more than anything else because of the format. People are looking at the screen so they can see the ads rather than just hear it, and they are on a computer so they can click the ad. People might hear about an interesting product on a Spotify ad while they are jogging, but they are not going to stop jogging and open the ad on their phone. YouTube ads are just more effective, so they probably pay more. I don't know how much money is made per stream on YouTube, but there are some online personalities that make a very good living posting viral videos and vlogs. That is their full time job and apparently they can make pretty high income doing it from what I hear (somewhere in the six figures). The good YouTube personalities can get maybe 100 million hits a year. Blank Space will likely hit a billion hits in about 8 months. Bad Blood might even do it at a faster pace. So if the incomes of the YouTube personalities are any indication, there is quite a bit of money in the YouTube music videos. Also, note that Google owns YouTube so they have data-mined everything about the users and their ads have several times more value than random ads. Also, some music videos have product placements in the video itself.  I think at the end of the day, Taylor sees the future of music and it is going to involve streaming music. The key is picking the winner. A lot of people say she is being greedy, I disagree. She has captured something like 90% of the revenue from her album already, that usually happens in the first few months. She'll probably earn more in one week from her 1989 World Tour than she will from the remainder of the album. Billboard showed that Taylor grossed $15M in one week from her tour, while 5SOS, the next highest grossing act, needed 6 weeks and something like 24 shows to gross $10M. If Taylor is ""greedy"" for more money, she can just play one more show and make up the difference. She actually wants to pick the right model for the future and she has enough influence to make a difference.  Some people say ""But she's just one artist! I don't even listen to Taylor Swift! I don't care!"". But the thing is, Taylor Swift commands a ridiculous amount of profit share. It's like the Android vs iPhone debate. Android has a ton of market share, Apple has almost all of the profit share. Android users spend very little on the Google Play store while iPhone users spend far more. Taylor Swift fans make up a huge slice of the total profit in the entire music industry (as evidence by how her tour makes almost 10x more than the #2 act, who makes far more than anybody below them). Because Taylor commands so much profit share, who she backs will have much improved odds of winning at the end of the day.  Taylor wants Apple to win the streaming wars because they don't have a free tier. Since only 25% of Spotify's users pay (as compared to 100% of Apple's users after the free trial), Apple's royalties are expected to be 4x higher that Spotify. Apple is a better business partner than Spotify because they are going to run the business at zero profit or even as a loss-leader to bring users into the Apple ecosystem where Apple will make money from iPhones. Spotify needs to make money at some point or go out of business (they don't make money now, they just raised another $500M from investors a few months ago), so artists will likely be squeezed even more in the future if Spotify is the norm. Her ""beef"" with Spotify is simply that she wants the higher paying business model in Apple Music to win because that is better for artists, including herself, going forward.  Her letter to Apple is simply because she recognized that it is likely that Apple will pay up and she is doing it both for herself and for others. It's a rounding error to her, as she can make far more simply by booking an extra show on her tour, but Taylor is a good business partner. She is not going to screw her record label and the other stake holders in her album by dropping the revenue to zero for the next 3 months. Now she can back Apple, which I think she was always going to do, and she makes sure her people gets paid. It's not about the money, but about the industry support. Everybody in the industry loves her because she is nice to them. We can call it ""greedy"" or ""selfish"", but it is not mutually exclusive from being nice. She didn't get to her position today by not watching out for her partners. Other people are going to have her back if they are ever in the position to help her."

TaylorSwift,3b2zju,SergeantJezza,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:48:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they have ads running on their videos, but YouTube already has a few ""premium"" channels, as well as the ability for selected content providers to provide things like movies and TV shows on demand that require a small rental fee.  Personally, though, what I like best about YouTube is that it's free. Free to create. Free to watch. With the ads, you don't have to feel guilty about it being free either. Also a lot of YouTubers are doing these Patreon style things that you can typically get early access or special bonus stuff for a small fee every month, and you get to pick who you're a patron of, it's not like your $10 a month would be partially financing a channel in Sweden that you never watch, but apparently is the top gaming channel in the world while the guys that you watch in LA that have a great morning talk show and the musicians in Florida you like barely get any."

Unsigned artists/labels would bear production/manuf/marking costs out of their cut Signed means artist on indie/major label and of course that labels/services/artists negotiate their rates - some may be higher or lower; chart is based on industry average."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,alisonstone,4,Thu Jun 25 21:29:33 2015 UTC,"Only 25% of Spotify's users are paying users, the rest are on the free tier. After the trial period, 100% of Apple Music's users will be paying users. Apple is expected to pay out about 4x more per stream because both of them pay out about the same percentage of their revenue (about 70%). If Spotify loses some of their paying subscribers to Apple Music, that ratio gets even worse."
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,Rockworm503,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:21:52 2015 UTC,On Spotify artists get like .0000003 of a cent each time one of their songs is streamed.  Which is like less than a dollar for a million streams.  Apple is going to do a free 3 months for new users and weren't going to pay artists during those 3 months so thats 3 months of nothing for starving artists.  Spotify has not changed one bit and Apple did in less than a day after Taylor spoke up about it.

But if its anything like Spotify you can put local files into it and add the music from there.  Buy her music anywhere else or go get the CDs and rip them to your computer and put it on there.  If it doesn't let you do that than I don't know what to tell you.
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,stoppetite,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:13:20 2015 UTC,You pay I think $14.99 a month and can basically listen to anything and it has premade playlists as well for certain activities or certain genres. I love it. I assume Spotify is somewhat similar.
TaylorSwift,3b2zju,Rockworm503,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:43:04 2015 UTC,Spotify has a free version and premium which is 9.99 a month and thats ad free able to go offline and put it on any of your devices.  Since all I have is a PC and dirt poor free is all I can do.  You can make any playlist as big as you want.  I made one giant one for all my music and several with different stuff that I feel like.  One with Taylor and Ed Sheeran and so forth.  Plus you can do radio stations based on certain artists or bands.  So if you don't know what you feel like listening to it can be like Pandora.

TaylorSwift,3b0hx5,justessforall,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:00:59 2015 UTC,"What do you think this song is about? Just curious. This is my favorite song EVER (I actually just saw Train last week!) and my next tattoo is going to have lyrics to this song. But, what did you think it was, and what do you think it means when TS sings it?"
TaylorSwift,3b0hx5,yesidoagree,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:16:05 2015 UTC,"Hmm well I guess I never really thought about the song too much, i would just sing to it haha.   But I would say before I thought of it as meeting someone who traveled the world and had all these cool experiences.  As to when Taylor sang it, I automatically felt like she was singing about an ex-love that left to ""find  themselves"" but then came back when they realized they made a mistake. I don't know if anyone else hears that, but when I interpreted the song that way it made me have much more of an emotional connection to the song so that's what I'm sticking with haha!"
TaylorSwift,3b0hx5,justessforall,2,Sun Jun 28 15:18:58 2015 UTC,"Well, the singer Pat MOnahan wrote this song when his mom died and while this was always my favorite song, I never understood how this was about death.   Until I saw him perform it live.   This song, is about the death of a loved one. Now, everyone  has their own interpretation, but I just wanted to tell you mine.   I am a spirtual person to an extent. I believe in spirits watching you. I believe this song is about his mom being a spirit in this world.   ""Now that shes back in the atmospher, with the drops of jupiter in her hair""   Now that she has passed, and her spirit is all around us, she is in our atmosphere, and while her soul traveled, bits of jupiter stuck with her.   ""She acts like summer and walks like rain Reminds me that there's a time to change""  The passing of this person made them realize that things can change, and they are the only ones that can change anything.   ""Since the return from her stay on the moon, she listens like spring and she talks like june""   Now that this person has passed, she may not be able to actually listen or talk, but its something you feel. You can still talk to her, and she listens to you, and you can feel her, but you miss talking to her.   But tell me, did you sail across the sun? Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded And that heaven is overrated?""  This is probably one of the two lines that make me cry. He is wondering Where his mother was in this world? THey say that when someone dies, they become a star. He wondered where in the galaxy she was, and did she make it to heaven safely, and if she did, did she realize that it was overrated and she should be back on earth with him.   ""Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star–  One without a permanent scar?  And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there""  He wants to know if his mother wasn't suffering in heaven, and fell in love all over again, and while she was happy, and not suffering anymore, he just wonders if he misses her.   ""Now that shes back from that soul vacation, tracing her way through the constellations.""  Since she had her fun, is she going through the sky looking for him?   ""She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo  Reminds me that there's room to grow""  While his mother is off and doing peaceful things that take away the pain she suffered, hes remebering to learn from her death, and he can change his ways.   ""Now that she's back in the atmosphere  I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane  Told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land""  This was always a line I didn't understand until I saw his performance, and it clicked. Since his mother was now in his spirit and soul, hes afraid that she will learn he was never as strong as she thought, and might get disappointed that he never was the strong man she thought he was. Though, I am sure his mother was still proud of him, I know sometimes I think my grandmother realizes I am not the person she thought I was and that does break my heart.   ""But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?  Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day  And head back to the Milky Way?""  This is more of the spirtual connection, and when she passed, did the wind sweep you off your feet, and did you get to do all these things that people say when you die? Did you get to see the stars, and the moon? etc etc.   ""Tell me, did venus blow your mind, was it everything you wanted to find, and did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there""   The whole metaphor of this song is about passing and where do you go when you pass, and assume that your soul reaches that stars. While in outter space, did she get to look at venus and all things that were beautiful, and was it as incredible as you hoped it would be when you left. He wants to know that while she looks at all these things, and she is happy, does she miss him? Was it worth leaving?   ""Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken?  Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong""  This line to me was confusing to me until, agian, I saw it live. Since the person has passed, she wont get to have all these things. The singer was his mothers best friend, and used to stick up for him when he was wrong, and she always loved him. (this hit me a little hard because my mom is my best friend, and she does this for me, luckily she is still alive,)   ""Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance, five-hour phone conversation?  The best soy latte that you ever had and me""   This is the other line that made me cry. This lyric made me feel devastated. The line continues from the past, and reminding her why she should stay on earth instead of die. The last line gets me, the best soy latte that you ever had and me. Because he is saying all these things he couldnt imagine living without, and then he just says ""and me"" and Never in my life had I felt so emotional over two words.   The rest of the song repeats a few lines here and there, and you can interpret it any way you want, I just have never felt an experience like this. It's crazy what hearing a song can do to you.   Like I said, I ALWAYS liked this song, and as a kid I just thought it was  a cool song but as i get older, it makes so much more sense, and I think is the best written song every (even better than All Too Well, and THAT is saying something.)"

TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,kenbw2,17,Wed Jun 24 13:57:40 2015 UTC,"To expand on a previous comment her back uncatalogued is on every service that doesn't have a free tier. Pandora, Rdio, Tidal, Rhapsody, probably few others. They never left, she's been completely consistent.   No deals would have to be renegotiated, just the timeline moved up.  And Apple's payouts were widely known. They issued a release saying how their payouts were higher and that was part of the reason the first 3 months they weren't going to pay.  Not trying to be an ass, but pretty much everything you wrote was either false or public knowledge that you didn't know."
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,vlarek,7,Wed Jun 24 15:51:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, I've been enlightened about Apple's payouts elsewhere in this thread. And I wasn't aware of these other services either.  It has raised the question though of why 1989 isn't on these other services. Her argument for withholding it from Apple is their 3 month no royalties policy - by which logic it should be available on Tidal et al."
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,vlarek,5,Wed Jun 24 15:56:51 2015 UTC,"Because why would she put 1989 on a streaming service? It's been Top 5 almost every week since it's release(I think it's missed twice), lately it's been #2. By Friday each week she goes back to #1 on iTunes.   For artists who sell it's completely normal not to be on streaming for a while. Red wasn't on streaming for a year, Beyonce didn't put her album on for 11 months, Adele was year+, Coldplay 6 months etc.."
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,vlarek,2,Wed Jun 24 16:15:29 2015 UTC,"Ah right, so it is pretty consistent then as a way to boost album sales.  I accept that her withholding of 1989 isn't consistent with what I'm putting forward in the OP.  Although she did present unfair payments as her reason on her Tumblr post. She kind of has to put 1989 on Apple Music now"
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,vlarek,4,Wed Jun 24 16:18:47 2015 UTC,"I agree it'll look bad if 1989 isn't on Apple after her tumblr post. HDD says it'll be on, but there's no definite word yet."
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,alittlepunchy,2,Wed Jun 24 16:27:46 2015 UTC,"HDD?  It seems a bit mixed messages now I think about it (this isn't me supporting the OP, it's a separate thought). She's said she's withholding 1989 because unfair royalties. But it sounds like she would have withheld 1989 anyway because album sales.  She is human though so I'm not going to hold up for a bit of inconsistency"
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,alisonstone,3,Wed Jun 24 16:31:47 2015 UTC,"http://hitsdailydouble.com Pretty much the best source for music news.  It's not inconsistent at all, you make it seem like it's a bad thing she wants her album to sell."
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,gm33,2,Wed Jun 24 17:05:46 2015 UTC,"No I don't bemoan her wanting to sell albums (it's kind of what she does), but her core reason for withholding it from Apple was because of their payment policy"
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,kagarcia,3,Wed Jun 24 17:26:18 2015 UTC,"an issue she'd never approached before but now suddenly became very vocal on.   To be fair, Taylor is actually being more vocal on a LOT of things now. In the past, she seemed scared of asserting/publishing opinions or taking a firm stance on things. I think she has decided ""to hell with it"" and is becoming more vocal on everything, not just the streaming topic."
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,ltcxmr,2,Wed Jun 24 21:22:32 2015 UTC,"I doubt there was any collaboration. Apple dropped the ball on Apple Music (at least, compared to Apple standards). Most analysts thought that the Apple Music presentation was terrible. I mean, they brought Drake out as a special guest and he was pretty much just rambling on about nothing (not really his fault, he probably didn't really know much about Apple Music). I wonder if the Apple executives even listen to music or if it was just the B-team working on the marketing for Apple Music. Steve Jobs would have done a much better job because he is actually a fan of music. He hyped up the Beatles songs being available on iTunes a few years back and got a lot of good press for Apple. It was also not Apple-like to release Apple Music a month after the presentation ended. Normally they release their product right afterwards (or for hardware, make it available for pre-order). What is the point of having a huge event that was hyped up by the press even before it happened, and not use that momentum to get people buying into it? It's not just my opinion, but this is what a lot of the journalists and analysts that cover Apple have said.  If Apple is really partnering with Taylor Swift, they should have just paid her enough money for her to put 1989 on Apple Music from the beginning. I think sales are down to about 40k albums per week down (that's how bad the music industry has gotten, it's still enough to top the charts). Taylor would probably agree to stream it if Apple just paid a few million dollars to make up for some of the lost album sales. That is probably far less than the amount they just agreed to pay over the free trial period and definitely far less than they spend on most of their advertising/marketing campaigns. They should have just gotten Taylor to talk on stage instead of Drake. Maybe even get her to perform. It wouldn't be the first time Taylor went corporate, she performed at Walmart's shareholder meeting in the past.  I think if Apple and Taylor collaborated, they would have done a better job at promoting Apple Music. Right now Taylor is the only one that looks like the big winner because of the positive press she is getting. I think Apple Music would have gotten more traction if Taylor spoke during the WWDC presentation and Apple Music launched immediately afterwards.  I love the idea of a marvelous corporate conspiracy where Apple and Taylor intentionally arranged this, but odds are someone at Apple is just dumb, trying to save less than a rounding error compared to their iPhone profits (the point of Apple Music is to get more people into the Apple ecosystem and buy iPhones, the profits from all the record labels combined is tiny compared to the profit Apple makes), and Taylor called them out on it."
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,ltcxmr,4,Thu Jun 25 03:17:17 2015 UTC,"obviously a lot of people will be wondering if Taylor will be extending her Streaming blockade to this new, powerful service. To everyone's surprise her entire back catalogue is there. Obviously that's very inconsistent with her previous stance.   I wouldn't say she has a streaming blockade. Her entire catalog (sans 1989) is streaming on Rhapsody, one of the best streaming platforms available. I think her catalog is only pulled from services that do not provide fair compensation."
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,ltcxmr,3,Wed Jun 24 14:30:29 2015 UTC,"Her entire discography (including live albums and singles) with the exception of 1989 is also streaming on Tidal because of fair artist compensation. There is also no free-tier to Tidal, just a $10 tier and a $20 high fidelity tier."
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,ltcxmr,3,Wed Jun 24 15:13:21 2015 UTC,Raises the question of why she's withholding 1989 from a fair paying service
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,kirklennon,3,Wed Jun 24 15:47:41 2015 UTC,It's fucking obvious....album sales numbers are an important thing to her.
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,kirklennon,2,Wed Jun 24 17:09:56 2015 UTC,"She presented it on her Tumblr post as being a protest against the no-royalties-for-3-months policy, not to boost album sales"
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,kirklennon,2,Wed Jun 24 17:24:59 2015 UTC,"It's both. She want royalties for her back catalog and other artists as well as to hold up the numbers for her new album.   Also, what's the point of this post? Even if they did collaborate.....so what? What are you getting at? Does something change? Good for Apple and Taylor I say (if it were even true, which it's most likely not)."
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,GNLSD,2,Wed Jun 24 17:31:53 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine then that she now allows 1989 onto Apple Music despite its effect on her album sales. Apple have pretty much called her bluff on that (or she puts herself in a very difficult position if she maintains her withdrawal of 1989).  It does dilute her ""I'm doing this for the smaller artists"" message a bit.  The point of the post is to discuss the thought I described in the OP. I'd hope I'd be able to discuss things here.  Yes if it's a business decision on both their parts then all power to them. I just wanted other people's perspectives. Which I've got."
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,YouVersusTheSea,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:40:48 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine then that she now allows 1989 onto Apple Music despite its effect on her album sales.   I wouldn't be so sure of that, despite what she may have seemed to insinuate. Someone as huge as Taylor isn't going to just trade her albums sales records just because another company showed a nice gesture on their service for artists. I'm not expecting it to be on Apple Streaming until after her tour is over."
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,alkanshel,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:45:56 2015 UTC,Makes sense. I feel like it's going to be difficult for her politically though. Her Tumblr post was pretty clear that Apple's non payment is the reason she withheld 1989. Apple have now done their part in effecting the change Taylor wanted. If she maintains her withdrawal of 1989 it could seem a bit one sided.
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,alkanshel,2,Wed Jun 24 17:50:52 2015 UTC,"It's not like she clearly stated 1989 would be for release immediately following an Apple policy change. You could essentially read it as her withholding her album forever and not just for the 3 months time because of the ignorant policy. In this scenario, even if Apple reversed the policy, she could still decide she would just release it to Apple at a much later date and she would still be holding true to her word.  Regardless, I'm sure a few people will probably be pissed just like with anything but any negative sides to it will ultimately be overshadowed by how she is responsible for so many artists getting paid for three months.... I could be wrong and 1989 will come to streaming sooner than later, but I wouldn't put my money on it."
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:01:38 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware that it was available on Rhapsody.  Do we have any indication though that Rhapsody's payments are higher than the competition? (The same applies to Apple)  Edit: if Rhapsody is fair, why is she withholding 1989?"
TaylorSwift,3ayaj8,RawhlTahhyde,4,Wed Jun 24 14:36:58 2015 UTC,"My best guess is that Apple's per-user payout will be about four times higher than Spotify's due to not having a free tier. As-supported users on Spotify are basically worthless, bringing down total royalty payouts to pathetic levels. It's no surprise why a big-name artist would pull her music from it when she knows her fans will pay full price to buy her album. There's no conspiracy here."

TaylorSwift,3aynkz,squibblefox,2,Wed Jun 24 15:41:13 2015 UTC,Hey there :)!  I went to the Glasgow show which was phenomenal btw. The items I remember were the programmes (15 pounds) T shirts 25 pounds Caps 15 pounds Sunglasses 15 pounds I think Some hoodies and such for 30 and 40 pounds  That's all I recall ^ They do also sell the album but duno who sells that there.  Something I didn't see which I was disappointed about was no guitar picks! Red tour had em and I've loved using them but not this time

Reddit is also anonymous basically.  So guys come and discuss her where they're accepted.  That being said, I'm 20, male, straight, and I'm always tweeting her lyrics and about the upcoming show I'll be attending.  I don't really get any backlash or care if anyone else cares.  Sure I may listen to Taylor ""aka girl music"" but I also listen to hard rock, metal, and even some hip hop.  Music is music.  I would argue that a large portion of males would like her if there wasn't some social stigma attached to it."

She's leaving for Africa on July 15 for two months to help fight malaria. It's a huge opportunity for her to advance her medical career, but it's delaying us getting a place together. We both just finished college so it would be amazing to treat ourselves to something we couldn't really afford before she leaves and the drive is only about an hour so gas wouldn't cost too much. We're huge fans and neither of us have ever seen her live so we'd love a chance to go!  Edit: I just wanna say all of your support means so much to me!

I've been a HUGE taylor swift fan ever since my freshman year, when one of my friends introduced me to her amazing music for the first time. Although being a male high schooler obsessed with taylor inevitably resulted in some name calling or disapproval from others, I didn't care and all my friends knew just how obsessed I was (I even named my steam acc and league of legends character after her). During Secret Santa every year, my friends have given me a taylor swift calendar, her wonderstruck perfume (which i have still yet to wear), and a taylor swift shirt! Inspired by taylor, I asked for an acoustic guitar for christmas and did a cover of Untouchable with a choir friend!   I've never been to one of her concerts and desperately wished to go to her Red Tour, but her concert date conflicted with my Advanced Placement exams and there was nothing I could do about it ): I'm heading off to university in the fall and will be a poor college student (carnegie mellon tuition is over 65k a year), so I can't really afford to go to her 1989 tour.  If you could make a fellow diehard Swifty's dreams come true, it would truly mean the world to me!"

Taylor swifts music motivates me to love.  I am truly happy with or withour a so. Being single is fun and weird at the same time. I would love the extra ticket to perhaps ask taylor swift to marry me and void me of my lonliness. I also just think it would be a blast rocking to tswift that close. I might be lucky and put you on mu shoulders, then we can go out for shakeshack afterwards sense it will be my bday week(7/14).  We will chat about our lives and how fun the concert was. I would promise to call you back and I do. We will end up going on our first real date to the zoo because you havent gone. We would call this our first official date. =). Then we will become cuddle buddies for life and eventually we will grow old together"

I recently moved away from home and realized that all of my ""friends"" back at home don't really seem to notice or care that I left. Since leaving I met this kid Daniel who I instantly connected with and he's become easily one of my best friends.  No, I'm not gay, it was just really comforting to realize that I do have positive qualities that make people want to be around me. He showed me that in worth something, and it all started with us, both adobe in a bar singing shake it off, while wasted.   I'd love to take Daniel to this and show him how much his friendship really means to me.   P.S. What you're doing is awesome, I did the same thing with 3 day passes to riotfest Chicago last summer. the guy I gave them to didn't send me any photos of him enjoying his time there at all. So I can promise, if I get the tickets, I'll be sure to make a post about how awesome you are,  with an album of images from the show."
TaylorSwift,3au8hn,RabidOpossum,2,Tue Jun 23 21:57:00 2015 UTC,I did the same thing with 3 day passes to riotfest Chicago last year   He did!  We should help Karma kick back around for this guy.
TaylorSwift,3au8hn,air_force222,2,Tue Jun 23 22:27:10 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend and I met at school (W&M) two years ago. I live out in Fairfax, but she's from LA (no idea how she wound up in Williamsburg). We've never been able to spend a summer together, until this year when she got an internship in DC. I just graduated from school and am moving away for grad school in the fall, but she has another year left, so this summer could very well be our last together.  Anyway, she's actually the one who turned me on to Taylor Swift. I hadn't really paid her much attention until her latest album, and now I play her music literally every time I go for a run. Whenever I'm in the car with my girlfriend and my phone shuffles to Blank Space, we spend the next four minutes screaming the lyrics to each other. Point is, this concert would be an awesome thing for us to do together during the summer in DC that I've been dying to share with her since we started dating.  You're doing a really awesome thing here man. I'm sure whoever gets these tickets will be wholly deserving of them."
TaylorSwift,3au8hn,monkifiery,2,Tue Jun 23 16:20:01 2015 UTC,"Hi, so I needed to post on this sub reddit account finally to get on this thread. I browse this sub almost daily but never really wanted to say anything of significance. But now, Everything has Changed.  I don’t really have a special Love Story to explain why I deserve these tickets, but I’m a huge Swifty and not in my Wildest Dreams could I even imagine getting to see her live. I’m a 22 year old male from NJ, and I would take my girlfriend as this would be an opportunity of a lifetime. Taking her to see Taylor would probably mean she would be Mine forever. We’ve been dating for a little more than 6 months now, and she fills the Blank Space in my heart, and would be the perfect place to tell her “You Belong with Me, forever” as I am Enchanted  every time I go Back to December when I first asked her out. I Know Places that may be more romantic to tell her I love her, but since both of us adore Taylor so much, this would be more than perfect.   I Wish You Would  give me these tickets, because if I don’t win, there will probably be Tear Drops on My Guitar (I don’t really play the guitar, lol) but even if you decide someone else is more deserving, and these tickets aren’t Ours,  I’ll just Shake It Off. There will be no Bad Blood, and I won’t seek revenge, cause you seem like an awesome guy for giving these tickets away in Style, and being happy for the winner is Better than Revenge.  Long Live Taylor!  Wow, I feel like a Fifteen year old fan girl writing this, and I know I missed a couple songs, but there was no way to include them in this. I tried. Lol. Thanks  again efunsky!"
TaylorSwift,3au8hn,pitts36,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:18:04 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's really admirable for you to give away the tickets to another taylor swift fan! My story may just be starting but I hope i can continue it. I recently just graduated high school and am going to college in August. My girlfriend of 2 years is also going to college in August as well. The thing is I'm going to college in Pittsburgh and she's going to college in Los Angeles, pretty far away :( Being able to attend a Taylor swift concert with her before she leaves would be the perfect way for us to get even closer before we have to part for months at a time. Whomever you give the tickets to will definitely deserve them!"
TaylorSwift,3au8hn,Astone1996,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:48:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm sure that I am not anymore deserving of these tickets than anyone else on this thread, but I am a 19 male and I have loved Taylor Swift ever since I've been 12 years old when I saw her in concert while she was touring with Rascal Flatts, and I immediately fell in love. At the concert, I got a shirt, her first album, and any other Taylor Swift memorabilia that I could get my hands on, and you can bet that I listened to that album everyday while trying to decipher the messages in the songbook. I also wore that shirt so frequently that my teachers started referring to it as my uniform. I can look back at any point over the past 7 years, and chances are is that Taylor Swift's music was at least the backdrop for events that were happening in my life, and to be able to see an artist live that had such an impact during a very impressionable time of my life would be such a special experience for me and one of my friends."

TaylorSwift,3apm3v,JustGreg,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:59:16 2015 UTC,"That is really heartbreaking but just reaffirms exactly why you should purchase them directly from the main official source (whatever that was for this show).   The article cites that tickets were ""often priced upwards of £100."" Of course that's still a decent amount but doesn't come close to the amounts that the secondary market start at, VIP, and even for standard tickets from Ticketmaster for a US Show. So, right there some red flags should have been going for getting tickets that cheaply. Secondly, this sounds like this site was recently started. Sadly, there are SO MANY ticket scammers you have to make sure you're buying from reputable places on the secondary market. I would only really trust Stubhub since they're the only secondary market seller that offers ""fan protection"" if there's a problem. There are plenty of other sites and deals to be had but we live in a day and age where you simply can't trust a ticket company without some reliable reviews.   This makes me very sad for the people who trusted the site and spent their money and looked forward to seeing Taylor in concert."
TaylorSwift,3apm3v,Brysun,2,Mon Jun 22 17:29:22 2015 UTC,I've had good luck on stubhub... and mostly day of or day before the concert.  But yes I agree scalping is shitty.  Yet ticketmaster doesn't really care since the ticket is sold on their end.  Oh yeah we have plenty of VIP $400 packages that come with a LED necklace.  Ugh.

Unless you are in a fan club with early access and there are restrictions on 1 per person.. even then I saw a documentary on ticket seller viagogo showing how they get all of their staff to buy the 'stock' in their and their families names to get around this.  Ticketmaster runs a secondary selling site called 'getmein' which is the one I used, which has 'fanguard' so if you don't get tickets you get a refund, but there are horror stories about this site too. I feel lucky my ticket arrived, hologram and all so seems legit.  The tickets for this show in the secondary market were at around £130, so £100 is cheap but not alarmingly so."

TaylorSwift,3ao9kc,iandrewc,36,Mon Jun 22 03:42:23 2015 UTC,"This somehow ended up working out better for both Taylor and Apple, because now it is all over the news. This actually worked out extremely well for Apple because now if you want to support the smaller artists, it would make more sense to stream on Apple Music during the free trial period (even if you don't intend to subscribe) than using Spotify or the other streaming services because everybody is on the subscription tier in Apple Music while the vast majority of Spotify users are on the free tier.  Apple is also calling bluff too. I'm not sure if Taylor / her label would want to put 1989 on Apple Music even if the free trial period was paid, because it is still one of the top selling albums on iTunes. After writing that letter and Apple responding so positively, she kinda has to put the album on there now I think."

TaylorSwift,3ao9kc,DaytonaZ33,8,Mon Jun 22 03:54:50 2015 UTC,"My guess is they had started to consider what changing that would mean for them, and Taylor speaking out against it was the final nail, and as soon as they saw her post they quickly started moving to change it."
TaylorSwift,3ao9kc,acrossthestarss,3,Mon Jun 22 03:59:21 2015 UTC,"Quite the opposite really. If anything the Feds are going to be more interested now in Apple using it's massive cash reserves to create an advantage over opposing services by doing something most (if not all) of it's competitors can't, which is give 3 months of royalties to all these artists without accepting a single cent in return."
TaylorSwift,3ao9kc,taylor-swift13,8,Mon Jun 22 16:32:39 2015 UTC,Glad Apple reversed it's decision. Kinda messed up to pay nothing to the artists for 3 months.... even if they do get exposure. Now I hope Taylor does actually allow for 1989 to be streamed even if its free for the first 3 months (to consumers).

TaylorSwift,3algz6,TweetsInCommentsBot,23,Mon Jun 22 03:41:46 2015 UTC,"She does make a valid point about how Apple should be paying artists their share even though it's a free trial from the user's standpoint.  This is a company with over $100B in cash and a $700B+ market cap; surely they can afford to pay artists their fair share for three moments. Yes, it would probably cost them millions, but that's truly pocket change for a company like Apple.  And that cost would mainly be in the first three months, when everyone using the service will still be on the free trial. A few years from now, when most people have used up their trial, I'm guessing they won't be losing nearly as much money paying artists during the trial."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,rpungello,3,Sun Jun 21 13:36:36 2015 UTC,"I know they're not against it in principle because, doesn't Apple already splurge tons of money on occasional free songs for itunes users? They have a thing where they promote some free song of the week or month or something, and they pay for the licencing out of their own pocket so the song owners still get payed."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,Svviftie,3,Sun Jun 21 23:34:12 2015 UTC,"Its a very stupid move. The overmedicatedturtle is very sad that there is not a single mention of how this FREE promotion will, at the end of the day, actually benefit up and coming artists. How? Because the more accessible music is>the more people listen > the more fans will show up at shows. Which is where struggling/ up and coming artists make almost all of their money. Not through record sales. Shows. Sure, maybe if  you're an artist that can sell 1 million records in a week you can make some significant money. But that's not the case. This letter does not reflect the views of smaller artists. And if you don't want to sound like a ""spoiled, petulant child"" don't make the claim "" this is not the whatever of a spoiled, petulant child"". There would be no need to say it if there wasn't some truth. And Tidal? Decent idea. Amazingly bad execution. If you want to support small artists/musicians how about having a have some up and coming artist as your spoke person. Not you or kanye west. Whatever intention there is „ it comes off petulant whiney and from the mouths of spoiled children.   sincerely- the overmedicatedturtle.  Edit: and seriously.

TaylorSwift,3algz6,My_Cat_Is_A_Bitch,2,Sun Jun 21 20:20:53 2015 UTC,The fact that it will benefit artists and the industry down the line isn't an excuse for using work for 3 months and not paying for it.
TaylorSwift,3algz6,My_Cat_Is_A_Bitch,-2,Sun Jun 21 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"....the ovemedicatedturtle doesn't know how to even comprehend the idiocy of that statement. Prolonging gratification is a pretty well known and accepted concept. Three months of free promotion is far far far better than three months of sales on iTunes/records  sales/whatever. Those are how record companies make money. Not musicians who don't  even have record deals and almost solely rely on shows to survive. ( not succeed, survive, as in have food and a place to sleep). Only those who already have money will benefit from this kind of thing."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,My_Cat_Is_A_Bitch,4,Sun Jun 21 21:53:52 2015 UTC,"The ""promotion"" (people having access to the music?) would be exactly the same, except the artist would get paid for the song listens.   The argument isn't that there shouldn't be a free trial. The argument is that if Apple is going to offer a free trial to customers (which is a good idea), they should pay the artists while doing so (like when I have a month free of Hulu, Hulu still pays for the rights to the TV shows during that month)"

Is Apple somehow pushing newer artists more than Youtube or Spotify or the radio or any other way people listen to music?   If so, I can see a tradeoff although I still think they have the right to royalties just like any radio station pays when they play music.  But I don't think there's really any sort of ""promotion"" here other than them being on the service... in the same way they're on Spotify, Youtube, etc. So it wouldn't change anything.

Taylor herself is pretty much a brand, Her music in general is her company.  If losses are bad for any company, Then why would she loose money on apple streaming her music for free?  Edit: I Understand your point. But you have to understand hers as well.."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,My_Cat_Is_A_Bitch,3,Mon Jun 22 00:55:18 2015 UTC,"The difference being Apple has shareholders and investors they have to please. The only person that Taylor has to please is herself.   So she should take the hit because she's the only shareholder?  Look, the bottom line is that they both have a stake in this:  Taylor is the creator of the music and she doesn't want to lose sales for those three months in order to promote the platform / possibly get more sales on the back end of it once people are ""hooked"" after the free trial. If I had a super well selling album, there's no way I'd want to give it away for three months while I'm still releasing singles and promoting it on a tour.  It's horrible timing for her.  Apple is providing the platform and they've decided that it makes financial sense to lose on the bandwidth / server costs for 3 months in order to promote the platform.  Taylor is presumably looking out for her bottom line and doesn't think it's fair to use her (and other musicians') music to promote the platform.    Apple thinks that the bandwidth/servers for that 3 months are a good investment.  Taylor obviously felt strongly enough about that perceived unfairness to call Apple out on it, and she probably wants to explain to her fans why they won't find her new album on there when they sign up for a trial.  tl;dr It's a business decision on both sides. Neither side is really ""wrong"".  It's just that this promo helps promote Apple Music over the long term where Taylor is more concerned with selling her super popular album right now while it's still atop the charts."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,fightintxag13,3,Sun Jun 21 20:35:24 2015 UTC,"It's not that Taylor is in the wrong for pulling her music, it's that Apple isn't in the wrong for handling the free trial the way they are. Both parties can be doing the right thing. The issue isn't Taylor pulling her music so much as the open letter itself."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,StraightTalkExpress,4,Sun Jun 21 21:06:19 2015 UTC,"When Hulu or Netflix have a free trial, they're still paying the licensing fees and royalties and whatever else for the TV shows.   If I want to promote my hat business by giving away a free pair of socks with each hat I sell for a couple months, I'm still paying for the socks."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,fightintxag13,2,Sun Jun 21 21:45:14 2015 UTC,"If Hulu or Netflix don't pay the licensing fees, the content gets pulled. Obviously that's the case with Taylor, but she's the exception, not the rule in the music industry.  Most of the up-and-comers that she's defending need their music to be streamed for exposure purposes. They can't afford to pull their music."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,StraightTalkExpress,2,Sun Jun 21 21:52:41 2015 UTC,"The issue isn't Taylor pulling her music so much as the open letter itself.   Look at it as an explanation to anyone interested as to why they won't find her new album on Apple Music.  It would be odd if she just pulled it and didn't explain, wouldn't it?"
TaylorSwift,3algz6,fightintxag13,4,Sun Jun 21 21:55:28 2015 UTC,"Except the explanation isn't a very good one. The up-and-comers that she is defending need the exposure regardless. It sucks for them that they won't get compensation for three months, but if it would be beneficial for them to pull their music, they would.   It means one of two things:  1) She doesn't understand what she's talking about.  or  2) She's making the smart business decision from her side and using the 'defending the new artists' angle to make herself look better.  Don't get me wrong, I love Taylor, but would it really be so bad if she just came out and said, ""I'm doing this because it makes the most business sense for me?"""
TaylorSwift,3algz6,alisonstone,2,Sun Jun 21 22:15:47 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I love Taylor, but would it really be so bad if she just came out and said, ""I'm doing this because it makes the most business sense for me?""   Judging by the comments on the /r/music thread trashing her for this decision while talking about how much money she makes and showing pictures of her house, there's a lot of resentment towards a multi-millionaire wanting to make more money.  At any rate, she may just see it differently than you and disagree with your conclusion that:   the explanation isn't a very good one."

She signed a contract with her record label and she has to make them money too. She is not going to backstab her business partners. They invested in her when she was young and they deserve some of the payoff too. The label has private investors/shareholders and employees too.

TaylorSwift,3algz6,i4NDR3W,21,Sun Jun 21 23:19:21 2015 UTC,"Well, isn't that exactly what she's doing? This post is just explaining why. But holding 1989 back sends a bigger message. I think she makes a lot of great points here to justify her choice in an intelligent, informed and committed way."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,TristanN47,40,Mon Jun 22 20:22:21 2015 UTC,"Fully agree with Taylor.  The multi billion dollar corporation that is Apple wants to use artists music for free as the sole mechanism to draw users to their own streaming platform. Three months is an insane amount of time for a trial. Instead of this ridiculous policy they could have eaten the $0.0007 per song cost to please both artists and consumers, but that's not how Apple does business.  Apple bluntly said 'Your latest album will be streamed to everyone and anyone for three months and you won't see a cent."" & Taylor rightfully said ""No"""
TaylorSwift,3algz6,sloth2,4,Sun Jun 21 14:41:58 2015 UTC,"While I completely understand why she said what she said, I can't help but think that her point of view isn't very good for the consumer. As I said in my comment, it'll keep pirating around."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,i4NDR3W,35,Sun Jun 21 15:14:35 2015 UTC,"So unless the consumer can get something for free, pirating is the only reasonable option?   This won't deter the pirates."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,My_Cat_Is_A_Bitch,6,Sun Jun 21 11:57:36 2015 UTC,I believe it's something like if 1 in 1000 buy her album it's a worthwhile decision to withhold her music.
TaylorSwift,3algz6,i4NDR3W,3,Sun Jun 21 12:13:56 2015 UTC,"No, no, not at all. It's only free for the first three months. After that you have to pay. I'm saying that if 1989 is on the service, that should cut how many people actually pirate it, since it would easily accessible  on Apple Music."

TaylorSwift,3algz6,i4NDR3W,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:28:46 2015 UTC,"We do know that Apple are paying more. Check this article. While the artists won't be paid during the trial, they will be paid more afterwards."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,gm33,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:35:51 2015 UTC,The consumer can afford to spend hundreds of dollars on new phones and tablets. They can spare a few pennies for the artists who make the music they love. We are not talking about the 90s when CDs would sell for 25 dollars new and 19 bucks on sale. With inflation consumers have been able to buy more albums or songs then they ever had the ability to buy before in recent history.
TaylorSwift,3algz6,i4NDR3W,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:42:18 2015 UTC,"Yes but if the music we want is on streaming services, there is no need to buy anything. It's more convenient to have everything on the streaming service."

TaylorSwift,3algz6,i4NDR3W,4,Sun Jun 21 18:03:03 2015 UTC,"Doesn't really matter to me one way or another.  I get her point and understand what her goal is.  I don't think she is being selfish. I think she really does want to fight for smaller artists and have them be able to profit off their music as much as they can.  That being said, I think a lot of people don't mind streaming their music because they know it means increased exposure which is really important to a new artist.  Even Ed Sheeran has talked about how Spotify has played a big part in his success.  In the end, I think people can do what they want with their music and shouldn't receive criticism either way.  It's their art, they should be able to decide what happens to it and their brand.  I can understand catching criticism for seeming disingenuous, and I'm sure people think Taylor isn't sincere when she says she is fighting for new artists.  I choose to believe that she is, so good for her, and if some artists think she's wrong, more power to them."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,EorEquis,15,Mon Jun 22 04:32:58 2015 UTC,"I find it really ironic how people call the artists who take their music down from the services greedy but don't say anything about the million dollar (in Apple's case, billion dollar) streaming services and other businesses that refuse to pay artists.  My take on it, if you don't like a business practice and want to be compensated for your work then you have the right to take your work down."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,RockDrill,19,Mon Jun 22 05:31:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think Apple will receive any money in those first three months either.   There are two types of artists she talks about in her post, the big name artists and the small indie artists. If you're a small indie artist, I don't think a music streaming service is right for you, since you won't make much money. But it is a great way to get your name out there.   If you're a big name artists, then why the hell not let Apple stream your music for free for a few months? Yes, they won't be paid in these months but if I were one of them, I'd want my music to be listened to by as many people as possible, and if that means that for three months people get to try Apple Music then so be it. A lot of people will likely start paying for the service there on after. In the long term I think it's a good thing. Look at Dave Grohl's point of view when it comes to these things, he has got it right. He wants people to listen to his music and make them happy.   Let's face it Taylor, if 1989 isn't on Apple Music people probably won't buy it. If anything people are going to pirate more."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,groverAlthouse,28,Sun Jun 21 21:08:38 2015 UTC,"The entire argument comes down to this simple question :   If you're a big name artists, then why the hell not let Apple stream your music for free for a few months?   And her very simple answer :   it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,shy247er,3,Sun Jun 21 16:50:15 2015 UTC,"She just doesn't see it as a good deal. Presenting someone with a deal isn't unfair. She can turn down the deal, and she has.  The way Apple sees it is clear: the service will need a critical mass of users to be successful and giving it away for free for 3 months will hopefully accomplish this, to the benefit of Apple and musicians. So they see it as a win-win, and Taylor does not. I think rightly so, since if Apple believed in their service they could wholly fund it themselves."

While 1989 has already reached lower than 40k weekly sales, 21 managed to never go lower than 70k in its first year of release.

Apple can afford those few months, and so can Taylor, but as she explicitly stated a few times in her letter, smaller artists can't. You can't just always run on wanting people to be happy from your music, Dave Grohl is rich as shit too. Some people legitimately need that money now, not three months from now."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,i4NDR3W,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:30:26 2015 UTC,"I wasn't using it as a justification, I was just stating something. I personally think that the trial is too long. If it was maybe 14 days, it would be much more acceptable.    You can't just always run on wanting people to be happy from your music Some people legitimately need that money now, not three months from now.   That's why I mentioned the smaller artists. People buying their albums is probably the best option for them when it comes to making money.   Dave Grohl is rich as shit too   Yup, this is true.

TaylorSwift,3algz6,RPFighter,6,Sun Jun 21 17:32:41 2015 UTC,"Well, obviously, smaller artists want people to buy their record but you can't just force them to do that. In a perfect world, artists would use streaming and they'd get new fans from that and get paid in the process. But new artists not getting paid for literally months really puts a damper in that. They can't afford  to boycott this like Taylor is, though, and even if they did they'd barely make a difference. That's why Taylor's doing this, that's why any privileged person ever has taken a stand against a policy that barely even affects them.

Don't make up this bullshit narrative in your head about the 'little people' when they wouldn't even be trying to use the service anyways if they were planning on getting paid per play.   The thing is too is that eventually these artists are just going to have to face the music. Comparing giving away her music for free to something like an giving away an apple device is absolutely hilarious.  You can't pirate an iphone.

TaylorSwift,3algz6,Sleela17,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:30:05 2015 UTC,"Funny how people in the music business are overwhelmingly agreeing with her, while the consumers are the ones complaining. I think that speaks volumes."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,kj01a,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:22:01 2015 UTC,"Yes it does, but the consumers are misinformed, too. Consumers will always want something for free. edit: fixed typo"

TaylorSwift,3algz6,kenbw2,3,Sun Jun 21 12:37:16 2015 UTC,How long until she takes her music off the radio?
TaylorSwift,3algz6,BeastPredator,15,Sun Jun 21 17:21:04 2015 UTC,You realize radio stations pay royalties for all the music they play. And most are actually better than what the streaming services pay.

TaylorSwift,3algz6,BeastPredator,3,Sun Jun 21 16:26:21 2015 UTC,Youtube/most other streaming sites have partnerships with people that draw a lot of viewers. More views = more money.
TaylorSwift,3algz6,alisonstone,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:19:31 2015 UTC,How do their payments compare with Spotify's?
TaylorSwift,3algz6,XlPoLaR04,3,Mon Jun 22 15:25:17 2015 UTC,"Through some web research, it depends on how much of your viewership is mobile, where it's coming from, how much advertisement, etc. but I've seen $1.15-$2 per thousand views. Substantially larger than Spotify from what we've seen."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,Svviftie,2,Mon Jun 22 17:44:01 2015 UTC,"1989 is still one of the top selling albums on iTunes and having it for free on Apple Music would almost certainly cut sales down to near zero on iTunes for the next 3 months. It doesn't make sense for any artist that has a current top 10 album to put it on there for free and I bet most of them won't (it's just that everybody is only talking about Taylor). In 3 months, when the artists get paid, they'll put their new stuff on."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,squirtle787,2,Mon Jun 22 18:14:11 2015 UTC,"She's not on Spotify and She's not on Apple music and honestly it makes no difference to me. I buy her albums and listen to them that way. I can import the songs onto a spotify playlist if i would like to, but i bought the album. The issue is going to be with driving new people to listen to her with their service. Now for full disclosure i hope apple music fails miserably because I despise the company and their overpriced and under powered electronics, but she did the same thing to spotify and they are hitting record numbers if i remember correctly so I don't think anyone will be too bothered."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,PrincessSparkle87,2,Sun Jun 21 13:10:42 2015 UTC,"I've always felt spoiled by these streaming services. I love Spotify, LOVE IT (despite the still horrible desktop client, whatever).   But It's not profitable as it stands, and that makes me worried about the future. All the freeloaders need to get a grip and start paying, the 10-15$ a month the streaming services charge is nothing for what you get.   Kids who don't have that kind of money can always use YouTube, which they do."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,i4NDR3W,2,Sun Jun 21 18:15:00 2015 UTC,"Sorry I love Taylor but this seems like a big whinge on her part, we all know it's about the money. It's the same deal as to why she pulled her music from spotify."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,wimplewinch,-1,Sun Jun 21 13:56:26 2015 UTC,"Well, I personally can't stand Apple, they think they're it and anyone who doesn't own an Apple device is unworthy so I like that Taylor is getting in their way.  I adore Taylor, but this after her pulling her music from Spotify as well.... It's easy to think she's being greedy but I love her and would like to think she has more genuine reasons than that. 3 months is a long time for a trial though, and as someone who doesn't use streaming services (except YouTube I guess if that counts) I don't really care... I just think this will make a lot of media headlines about Taylor being horrible and spoilt which really sucks."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,FolieAJew,9,Sun Jun 21 20:58:09 2015 UTC,"they think they're it and anyone who doesn't own an Apple device is unworthy   Apple Music will be available on Android as well, so they do care somewhat about people who don't have Apple devices."

TaylorSwift,3algz6,FolieAJew,-4,Sun Jun 21 22:18:29 2015 UTC,"I'm a phootographer who has applied to photograph her in Hyde Park this saturday, I'll get my approval/deniel on Wednesday, after which I will have to sign a form saying I can use them, providing I don't make money from it, for the publication I'm shooting for, once.  We can never repost the pics, I can't use them on my personal online portfolio, I can't sell prints or shirts, I can publish those photographs, unpaid, once, and that's it, forever  So, converse to Taylor;s statement, Apple may not give you free iPhones, and that's a good reason to not give them free music, but you don't give the photographers free music, so why should we give you free photographs and publicity? and there is no three mnth rule here, this is all time, I'd take three months without pay over no pay at all ever at any time, wouldn't you?  I love Taylor, but her ridiculous photo contract and this statement are very hypocritical, which is a shame, regardless, I'll sign the 'Travel 120 miles and work for free all day to photograph me fore ten minutes' (Taylor only allows second and third songs) agreement, and I'll be excited, IF they approve us, that is :P"
TaylorSwift,3algz6,Mi-ner-va,8,Sun Jun 21 14:41:48 2015 UTC,"I'm confused.   providing I don't make money from it, for the publication I'm shooting for, once.   Why isn't the publication you're shooting for paying you for your time?"
TaylorSwift,3algz6,maxim380,-3,Sun Jun 21 23:08:02 2015 UTC,"they do, but they or I cannot sell the photographs, so it's like being paid to paint a picture for a friend, but not being able to sell it, and neither can the friend, BUT you have a painting you got paid for!! Swings and roundabouts :)"
TaylorSwift,3algz6,FolieAJew,2,Sun Jun 21 23:30:43 2015 UTC,"(Taylor only allows second and third songs)   I'm not sure I understood this, can you elaborate. She only let's people take photos during 2nd and 3rd song? Why?"
TaylorSwift,3algz6,My_Cat_Is_A_Bitch,5,Sun Jun 21 23:35:50 2015 UTC,"This isn't just at Taylor's concerts. During most concerts I've been to photographers had to go after a few songs, personally I think it's because they ruin the view for people at the front. Yesterday evening during the Amsterdam concert the photographers had to go into the crowd, instead of between the barriers and the stage. One of them pushed me away with his lense a few times to get a few shots, so I'm glad they have to go after a few songs."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,FolieAJew,-1,Sun Jun 21 12:46:23 2015 UTC,"It's how you said, only for the second and third song, with most 'bigger' bands sit's the first three, and then after that they are 'relaxed' as it were, so as they sweat or whatever and the makeup comes off they don't need to worry about a not so nice picture of them getting out, so first three songs only is plenty of time for the photographers, and short enough to be dealt with by the act, Taylor has two and three onlly mainly bc she can, but maybe because the start of the how often has like a story between the first and second song, so the photographers will get like loads of extra time, and another reason is not to oversaturate the market by having like millions of photos out there iin all the costumes changes etc :)"
TaylorSwift,3algz6,FolieAJew,2,Sun Jun 21 12:57:37 2015 UTC,"Taylor DOES pay photographers to take her picture. When it's something she wants. She's not going to pay you for taking fan pictures, why should she?"
TaylorSwift,3algz6,FolieAJew,-1,Mon Jun 22 03:51:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not taking fan pictures, it's a proper, photo pass into the pit affairm we get nothing but we get to publish the photos! -- and see the gig, of course :)"

Idiot  Please try to have an opinion that isn't blinded by holding Miss Swift up above everything else, I like her as much as anyone else, but the photog is right honey  EDIT: also, I'm gonna be closer to taylor Swift than the people who bought the highest tier tickets, as well as the chance to interview her, I'm not a victim, the industry is."
TaylorSwift,3algz6,FolieAJew,0,Sun Jun 21 21:58:36 2015 UTC,"I'll assume you're trolling at this point, please see my other response to you regarding the power of photographs and photography, especially in media, please stop replying as you're making yourself look incredibly silly and this is all getting a bit embarrassing - literally think about every single photo you've seen of Taylor, someone has paid thousands of dollars for gear and travelled a long way and waited a ling time for that, and as we established, they do it for free  and you're calling them 'not special' and 'nobody cares what they think'  you're arguing about not getting paid for creating art, in response to an article written about someone complaining for not getting paid for creating art, ggwp  EDIT, I've just seen your saga with /u/ValKilmersHair and you simply need to stop being a fanatic jealous child."

You're the most entitled pretentious cunt I've ever seen on reddit and that says a fucking lot. Hope you fucking grow up one day or you are going to have a very difficult life.

Also, the point of the photog is that what TAYLOR says can be flipped on her, so you're literally hating on Tay's own 'pathetic, entitled logic' being used against her, ok.  I'll continue being a joke photographing Taylor Swift while you cry at people on Reddit thanks, have fun & happy ragewanks, please stop being so mean to everyone on the sub"
TaylorSwift,3algz6,FolieAJew,-1,Mon Jun 22 22:55:22 2015 UTC,"Why do photographers, travelling, in my case, hundreds of miles, to photograph and publicise our images and review to our readership of just under a million people not deserve money? it's clear you have no industry experience and are possibly pretty youn so i'll just ignore it, but it's a 'you scratch my back I'll scratch yours' industry, we get to see shows we love, and meet people we love, and the get the publicity, but you're saying that neither of us provides a service to the other, like photographers are just not needed, when you go out tomorrow, or even if you stay in, count the amount of photographs you see in that day, and tell me why we don't deserve to be paid."

I haven't read Taylor's book about how much she haaaaates singing  I'm sure she loves it, why us she getting paid?  Your days on this sub are numbered lmao, I'm not worried  Also, you're simply not a brand owner, and if you aren't it's not a successful one, do you not use ANY photographs? do you not pay for them? I'm a minor and I understand this industry - and the rest of the world's point of view - more than you do, and looking at your account (nice comment karma btw) you simply have no idea how to interact with people that don't share the same robotic love with her that you do, we're all here because we love Taylor, but all you seem to be doing is picking fights.
