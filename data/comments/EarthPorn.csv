EarthPorn,3dwcvf,ElContador67,9,Mon Jul 20 08:12:51 2015 UTC,"It's a whole different vibe than their recorded stuff. Still awesome, maybe better.  They do less of the fancy sound-texturing stuff and are more of a jam band, so it's much more upbeat and dance-y"
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,prettybunnys,7,Mon Jul 20 13:48:01 2015 UTC,"They are absolutely fantastic live, if you get the chance you need to see them.   I've seen a lot of acts over the years and they easily rank in the top 5, if not the best. In terms of showmanship and the way they get the crowd going."

EarthPorn,3dwcvf,AssGagger,4,Mon Jul 20 11:45:08 2015 UTC,"You can also go to U Street music hall or Flash.  These two clubs have the most amazing sound systems for a smaller club.  U street has been written about as having the best in the country.  Flash is newer, a bit smaller and arguably has an even better system than U hall.  They're in walking distance of each other.  Between them is the 9:30 club, always in the top 10 of places to see a show in the USA.  DC is a great place for live music."

EarthPorn,3dwcvf,Sardonnicus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:47:19 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, and I could be wrong, but FKF and Thunderball are not DC acts but are acts signed to Thievery Corps record label which is called ""ESL Music.""  That label is based out of their lounge, called ""18th Street Lounge.""  Hence, the name ESL Music."
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,xanax_anaxa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:16:02 2015 UTC,"Wikipedia lists FKF as being ""DC based"".    Oddly, the Thunderball wikipedia page now redirects to Fort Knox Five.

EarthPorn,3dwcvf,Sardonnicus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:54:42 2015 UTC,"They had an app for it at one time.  24 hour streaming ESL radio.  It was sweet.  FKF maybe local, but I never hear anyone talk about them, or see anything from them advertised.  ""The Archives"" is an amazing local reggae act that was formed by ESL Music.  I have never seen them play or heard any of their shows talked about, but cats on the street know them and seem to know where you can find their members playing in various pickup groups around the City.

EarthPorn,3dwcvf,snapbackchinos,17,Mon Jul 20 03:05:28 2015 UTC,"Nice gear but what is star tracker (it helps with star movement but what is it, software or hardware or a tripod mechanism)?  Nevermind I found your answer below :)"
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,zbufferz,3,Mon Jul 20 05:15:39 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, how is the foreground so well lit? It looks like a flash but that's so crazy unreasonable with the amount of area covered. Is it the light coming from the concert behind you?"
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,snapbackchinos,2,Mon Jul 20 12:33:45 2015 UTC,The image was a combination of four 286-second exposures. 286 seconds is over four-and-a-half minutes.  Notice the grasses are blurry.
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,zbufferz,2,Mon Jul 20 12:49:36 2015 UTC,Wow I totally misread the exposures. I think I skimmed and just saw 1/280.
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,Phayze87,5,Mon Jul 20 12:56:48 2015 UTC,"The reason he needs at least two exposures is because both the sky and the ground are in focus.  The sky is in focus because he used a star tracker (a thingy that moves the camera in sync with the rotation of the earth so the stars stay in focus).  But a star tracker would cause the ground to go blurry, so he needed a separate shot that had the ground focused (but which would have had a blurry sky.  He composites the at least two exposures together to keep the sharp sky and the sharp ground."
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,kylem683,3,Mon Jul 20 13:09:31 2015 UTC,"Stunning photo, my lord. I recently embarked down the path of photography and astro/star-scapes have always been an interest of mine, but I am still so new I haven't been able to achieve anything even remotely this beautiful.  I'm running a crop sensor camera, my wide angle kit lens (18-55mm) starts like f4 or f5.6 or something. Do you need anything else besides a tripod and star tracker thing to get started with super long exposures like this? (PS: I'd love to see a pic of the camera attached to the star tracker cause I still have no idea how it works.)"
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,ChrisLW,2,Mon Jul 20 11:36:10 2015 UTC,You may want to invest in a wider aperture lens. Being able to open up a lens to f2 or so will allow you to lower your iso and reduce the noise of your image.
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,jmart1375,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:27:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not the OP, but can give you a few pointers.  Most important will be to use something other than your 18-55 kit lens.  The focal length isn't bad, but you'll get better results with a faster lens.  The OP is using a Samyang/Rokinon manual focus lens with a fast (2.8) aperture.  By going with a manual focus, the lens doesn't cost nearly as much (and doing astrophotography, you don't need autofocus anyway.)  You could also see about renting a fast lens from a local camera store, and experimenting with 30 second or so exposures before dropping the coin on a dedicated lens and astro-mount (30 seconds with a short focal length being about the max you can pull off before the stars make trails in your photo).  That's what I did to nab this shot at Copper Breaks State Park in Texas earlier this year.  I'll likely try again later this summer to get some shots of the Milky Way, like the OP did.  Good luck!"

EarthPorn,3dwcvf,Andy1_1,4,Mon Jul 20 05:51:50 2015 UTC,"You have to if you're a fan. I've seen them at festivals, clubs and they even did a live set on KCRW. Every show was spot on perfect and most of what you hear on the album is performed live — percussion, brass, vocalists, fucking sitars. In my opinion THAT is how you play 'electronic' live. You don't want to miss the opportunity if you have a chance to go."

EarthPorn,3dwcvf,f1del1us,9,Mon Jul 20 03:03:53 2015 UTC,Fantastic. What is star tracker?
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,ObecalpEffect,27,Mon Jul 20 03:19:51 2015 UTC,"A star tracker is a device that (very slowly) turns your camera to match the rotation of the earth so that you don't get star trails when taking extremely long exposures.  Normally you'd be limited to 20-30 seconds of exposure before star trailing appears (that's a loose generalization, the max time is actually based on your focal length, see the Rule of 500 )."
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,ObecalpEffect,7,Mon Jul 20 03:25:15 2015 UTC,Does it have to be precisely calibrated based on your location?
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,lil-rap,12,Mon Jul 20 03:54:34 2015 UTC,"Yes. For an Equatorial mount like the one I use, there is a scope that needs to be aligned with Polaris (or in the Southern hemishpere, Sigma Octantis).   There are also mounts that actually measure and follow the movement of night-sky objects using a sensor, but those are generally bigger, heavier, and much more expensive."
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,redhedhempgal,6,Mon Jul 20 04:08:48 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to wrap my head around how the camera is rotating with the stars, so they don't streak, but why then aren't the trees blurred?  Did you take some static shots of just the trees and then merge them with the star shots?  Did you light the trees some how?  They look quite nice."
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,midnightsmith,44,Mon Jul 20 04:29:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, you've got it exactly right.  I take the same shot with the tracker on and off, no other settings are changed, then I combine them in post.  Here's an example of what that looks like from a previous shoot:  http://i.imgur.com/J6j1yLg.jpg"
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,ParadiseForParasites,5,Mon Jul 20 04:42:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Just out of curiosity, and sorry if you mentioned it already, which star tracker are you using?  Is it something like this?  http://www.firstlightoptics.com/blog/vixen-polarie-star-tracker-mount-review.html"
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,midnightsmith,8,Mon Jul 20 04:45:39 2015 UTC,"I have an iOptron, but it's almost exactly like that Vixen Polarie (and a little bit cheaper I believe)."
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,midnightsmith,6,Mon Jul 20 04:46:59 2015 UTC,"I also have the iOptron and love it, but I have yet to do any composite images with it.

EarthPorn,3dwcvf,your_message_here,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:27:04 2015 UTC,Very nice examples! So do you cut out the stars and overlay on the non blurry trees and such? If so that seems like a long process considering all the small details of trees and bushes you have to work around. Do you use a vector mask of some sort? Kinda mid level photoshop skills here and would love to experiment.
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,coding_is_fun,4,Mon Jul 20 08:01:27 2015 UTC,"You could easily use a layer mask to paint over the blurred areas from one picture or use the pen tool to do the same thing essentially, if that makes sense."

These exposures were over 4 minutes long, which allows the camera to gather a lot more light than what you see with the naked eye.  But yes, you can see the entire arch of the milky quite clearly with the naked eye once your eyes adjust!""  I was thinking the same thing you were, I think that explains it pretty well."

EarthPorn,3dwcvf,mprhusker,2,Mon Jul 20 16:50:41 2015 UTC,"Well that depends who you talk to, historians can't even seem to agree.   In her article “Reclaiming the word ‘Squaw’ in the Name of the Ancestors,” Dr. Bruchac wrote the following excerpt about the meaning of squaw.  “The word has been interpreted by modern activists as a slanderous assault against Native American women. But traditional Algonkian speakers, in both Indian and English, still say words like ‘nidobaskwa’=a female friend, ‘manigebeskwa’=woman of the woods, or ‘Squaw Sachem’=female chief. When Abenaki people sing the Birth Song, they address ‘nuncksquassis’=‘little woman baby’.”  “I understand the concern of Indian women who feel insulted by this word, but I respectfully suggest that we reclaim our language rather than let it be taken over,” wrote Bruchac."

EarthPorn,3dwcvf,Oldenough33,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:43:37 2015 UTC,I know nothing about photography so bear with me. Why do the hills and trees appear to be illuminated by something as bright as the sun but the night sky looks so radiant? I can't wrap my head around it.
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,DogeMcDogeyDoge,4,Mon Jul 20 04:48:07 2015 UTC,"No need to apologize.  It's not a natural phenomenon, although similar can be achieved when there is a very small sliver of a moon (which is actually what I was hoping to get, but my timing was off by a few days. TONIGHT would be a good night to do the same with the moon before it sets around 10:40). In this case, the hill is illuminated by ""light pollution"" from the concert and whatnot going on a half mile down the hill behind the camera."
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,Rob_63,2,Mon Jul 20 04:52:32 2015 UTC,That's interesting. It makes the picture look amazing.
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,geoffsbeer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:33:01 2015 UTC,i tried shooting my first night sky photography when i was camping. i completely failed and i didn't see any stars in my photos. :(
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,iilluzisuicidellii,3,Mon Jul 20 04:53:03 2015 UTC,"I shot my second photo last night in a light polluted area and it came out fantastic! Here are some tips from what I have learnt:  Make sure it is a clear dark night (around midnight is good) and you can see a few stars with the naked eye. Try to avoid shooting if there is a full moon as this will cause light pollution. Either use a tripod if you have one, or just find a flat stable surface to lay your camera on (facing up). Set camera to use a 2 sec timer (so camera doesn't shake when it opens the shutter) Set image format to RAW (if you can for the most detail).  Zoom in and point towards the brightest star you can see, manually focus the camera on this star. Start with a low ISO (100-400) and try a shutter speed of 10-15 seconds. You can get away with higher exposures without a tracking mount but it depends on your focal length. I usually stick to 10-20 seconds or you start to see star trails. You normally want your aperture as high as you can get it so your lens takes in the most light (my lens only goes to f3.5). Point the camera at the sky and take a test photo.  Check your results, can you see any more stars? Are they sharp? Is the sky still dark enough? (not too important but you don't want a really pale blue or you won't see anything either.  Now just play with your shutter speed, ISO and focus until you get a decent shot with sharp stars. This is do-able in light polluted areas.  I took this last night (it was stacked in deep sky stacker to make it more detailed though!).  http://postimg.org/image/tzjed0bdh/ 10 x 13 sec exposures, 800 ISO, f3.5."
