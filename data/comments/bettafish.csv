bettafish,3e5gwy,tippytoegirl,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:11:28 2015 UTC,"I've had him for about 12 hours, I took some pictures right after I finished drip acclimating him. In terms of age, I'm not sure. He came from my really great LFS, it was tough to choose since they really all looked so healthy and active. I wouldn't be surprised if his colors change a little in the next few weeks."
bettafish,3e3dus,ImTurtle,7,Tue Jul 21 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, that ""hut"" you have, I had to remove mine from the tank. After about 2 mths the green began to come off and then it started to turn the water very cloudy"
bettafish,3e3dus,onebat4u,3,Tue Jul 21 17:56:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up! I appreciate it!  I'll keep a look out for it or find a replacement decoration :)

bettafish,3e3dus,onebat4u,2,Wed Jul 22 00:46:43 2015 UTC,"About two mths ago, I looked it up and it has a lot of good reviews, I think I found one person who said the green came off, but nothing about it clouding the water. And one other person said it came apart. Mine is coming apart at the bottom section. Might be a fluke or there is a bad batch out there."

bettafish,3e3dus,tippytoegirl,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:51:29 2015 UTC,Oh wow. I've had that hut since I first got my betta two years ago. He loves it! He hangs out in both the top and bottom parts :D And I haven't had any issues except for when I don't clean my filter/water long enough and some algae grows.   My question is what round-plant thing is that? I should get him one! Oh and are those (edit: all) real plants? Do you have a filter on top or is it just a tank? Would you mind sharing the brand?
bettafish,3e3dus,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:02:28 2015 UTC,the round thing is a Marimo ball haha I thought it was cool so I bought one at the store :). all the plants are real!  the filter is at the top and that guy is correct. It is the fluval spec 3 and it's 2.8 gallons. My fish just started making a bubble nest and I'm so excited!  I know they need a 5 gallon I was planning on upgrading in the future :(   but for now he seems happy!

My bad!"
bettafish,3e4vd4,maxkats,4,Tue Jul 21 23:45:18 2015 UTC,Your tetras would be fine with a male (most the time). A male and female betta together is a bad idea.  They will kill each other.  They don't pair up for life.  They just don't kill each other for a few minutes.  That's why I cringe with the National Geographic betta tanks that hint at betta breeding.
bettafish,3e4vd4,MerfishAWAY,3,Wed Jul 22 00:07:07 2015 UTC,"Your tetras will be fine with a female betta. It really depends on her personality. As your acclimating the tetras, watch how she reacts to them. If she doesn't act aggressive, then you should be fine! :)"
bettafish,3e4vd4,ZeldaMusic113,3,Tue Jul 21 23:51:20 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone who works at a pet store: don't listen to the employees. Find some piece of knowledge that requires some basic research, but isn't known by people not interested in aquariums, and use it as a test. Not foolproof, but a better way to get an idea of the employee's knowledge.   In general, anything compatible with a betta is compatible with a betta, regardless of gender. Betta fish have wildly varying personalities, though, so you never know for sure until you try something. Just be careful and responsible.   That said, tetras should be compatible with most betta fish. If the tetras are too nippy, you may not have a large enough school. Sometimes, though, it just won't work out. And putting any betta with another betta is a recipe for disaster (even a sorority maintained by a skilled aquarist meeting all the requirements can fail, often spectacularly). Even people who breed bettas can have a hard time getting the fish to not kill each other."

After the pecking order, they get along like puppies. Everything I've read advises against putting anything with a male betta, depending on his personality. But they get along just fine with my bettas, none of them have even nipped at my tetras, they just ignore them."
bettafish,3e4vd4,dogmanbirdgirl,3,Wed Jul 22 01:37:18 2015 UTC,Do NOT put your male and female together! They will KILL eachother or one will kill the other. Even if they do somehow breed. You are probably not prepared for the number of babies you will have.

bettafish,3e2sk9,Caine_Virgil,2,Tue Jul 21 14:55:14 2015 UTC,"The fin type you're thinking of is crowntail, and your boy is not one of them. I suppose it could be fin rot, but it doesn't look like it. More likely, he bit his fins. Betta do that for a variety of reasons: boredom, stress, fins are too cumbersome. Either way, the best thing to do is to keep warm, clean water and keep and eye on it. If the edges start looking bloody or black, it's gotten infected, and the first step there is to treat with aquarium salt. If it keeps getting worse, you can try an antibacterial. It's most likely fin nipping, though."

For a super delta, this is between 120° and 160°. Anything less than 120° is a delta tail.  As for the colour type, a uniformly coloured body with white on the fins is called a butterfly (though some argue that it only applies to translucent white)."

bettafish,3dz3du,thepsychesrapture,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:24:57 2015 UTC,Start by checking out the care sheet. It's full of all the information you'll need to care for your new friend properly.  The basic things you need to know are that a betta needs at least a 2.5 gallon tank. Bettas are tropical fish and require a heater to keep them at a stable temperature around 76-81 degrees. A filter is the third requirement. You'll want to read up on the nitrogen cycle.  I know it's a lot to read and absorb but your fish will be better off for it. I'm more than happy to answer absolutely any question you've got.
bettafish,3dz3dd,wwoodrum,4,Mon Jul 20 18:24:08 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest looking for a 5 gallon aquarium that comes with a lid, a filter, lighting (LED preferred) and heater. I can't suggest one in particular, but one with good reviews might be a good place to start.  You'll want to stop by petco to pick up decorations unless you want to reuse the ones you have. Be sure to have a hiding area for your betta, like a log or cave without sharp edges and something like a leaf near the surface of the water so they can sleep on it.   Once you have everything set up, let the tank heat up and run for 24 hours minimum and then slowly introduce the betta to the tank by either floating it in a cup slightly submerged in water or putting him in a bag and letting it float (with water from your old tank of course). Gradually add water from the new tank to help him acclimate. You're trying to ease the transition into the new tank because he won't appreciate being put into a different temperature like that immediately. The process will take a few hours.  Your next endeavor will be to learn how to cycle your tank and understanding what your tank's ecosystem is. http://www.wikihow.com/Cycle-a-Fish-Tank this site gives an overview of what you'll be doing. You're going to be doing a fish-in cycle and you'll be managing the ammonia/nitrate levels by doing frequent water changes. You'll want to get a water test kit, preferably not the strips since they're not cost effective. You can probably put that off for a week or so since it takes a bit for your tank to start producing good bacteria. I'm also going to suggest not putting in additional fish or invertebrates until your tank is fully cycled. Bettas typically don't get along with other animals so you might want to keep your tank a betta only tank permanently.  I'm sorry if this sounds like a ton of stuff to do but once you get it set up, you won't have to do much other than water changes. Your betta will definitely appreciate the new tank!"

bettafish,3dz3dd,le_nguyen349,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:11 2015 UTC,Yes it's in store only.
bettafish,3dz3dd,spazticcat,2,Tue Jul 21 19:43:25 2015 UTC,"Also a lid, since bettas can jump. And a decent light if you want plants. (You don't need anything fancy for the beginner low light plants like anubias and java fern.)"
bettafish,3dz3dd,oddmeister,2,Mon Jul 20 20:56:26 2015 UTC,"This kit is probably the best bang for your buck.  Low iron, high clarity rimless glass tank.  The filter needs some mods to make it really shine, but it's easy to do (Just look up Azoo Palm mods on youtube).  You just need a Fluval Edge Recharge kit, Fluval Edge Prefilter sponge, and a small zip-tie.  And the light is better than what you'd find on most starter kits.  Just add a heater, and you're set."
bettafish,3dz3dd,oddmeister,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:50 2015 UTC,I keep reading horror stories of bettas fins getting caught in the filters. would this one risk that?
bettafish,3dz3dd,violetfield,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:48 2015 UTC,"Not with the pre-filter sponge installed.  This is how it would look like installed (sorry about the potato quality pic).  If it's safe enough for baby shrimp, it's more than safe enough for bettas.  Plus, there's tons of surface area for BB to colonize because of the filter sponge, biomax media, and the pre-filter sponge."
bettafish,3dz3dd,violetfield,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:02:17 2015 UTC,"Look into the Marineland Portrait 5g, around your price point and comes with an integrated filter, but you'll have to add a heater onto it. For a little more, the Fluval Spec V is an even better option.   If you aren't too stuck on using your Amazon card, go for the $1/gallon sale at Petco or PetSmart and put together something on your own! If you're not a DIY-er, go for PetSmart's 5.5g kit. It's only $27 and you'll wanna add a heater onto it as well and you might also want to do a sponge filter instead of the power filter that comes with it, but that's personal preference."
bettafish,3dz3dd,violetfield,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:58:28 2015 UTC,with the filters would i still need to maintain water changes?
bettafish,3dz3dd,violetfield,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:57:12 2015 UTC,Yes. Water changes are 100% essential to the health of any tank. Check out the sidebar for information on cycling!

Frozen foods (bloodworms, daphnia, etc.) would be a good choice to feed him a little teeny bit of after fasting. It's also generally recommended to feed bettas pellets (usually no more than 6/day, but I'd recommend starting with 2-3 if he's still bloated), rather than flakes, and some people recommend soaking them in a bit of aquarium water first."
bettafish,3dw3nz,bookdragoness,7,Mon Jul 20 00:46:15 2015 UTC,"I bought a small pack of ""plastic canvas"" (look in sewing goods) for about $2 and only used a small portion of it. It floats, so no extra flotation is needed.   Cut a rectangle out that looked like a good size for the betta + fins to swim through Sand the edges and mesh with high-grit sandpaper to make sure there are no sharp parts to catch delicate fins Use monofilament fishing line to sew the tube together Pull tight and tie off the fishing line to prevent entanglement BONUS: Use fishing line to tie moss or plants to the bottom for decoration Put in tank and enjoy!   Mr. Fish swam up and immediately began investigating it. He's started hanging out in there fairly often.  I used a small loop of fishing line to hook it to the outside magnet portion of my thermometer so the perch wouldn't drift into the filter outflow."

bettafish,3durt5,EverythingIsQueer,6,Sun Jul 19 17:57:21 2015 UTC,"Looks great! I have the same tank as you, as for the filter I'd suggest buying a different one (like a sponge filter), or at least doing something to soften the flow. I wrapped a stretched panty hose piece around the intake because it was too strong for my guy and sucked his tail in. Also, bettas don't like lots of surface movement, so that will help with that. As a final thing about the filter, watch it carefully. Why I say buy a different one (other than the flow being too strong) is because mine screwed up, ended up putting all the bad shit back in the water, and killing my betta. It could've just been a defected one, but I'd still watch closely. Good luck!   Edit: Also, consider putting in a mug or a decorative piece like a tube or cave, as well as some sort of fake plant. They like to swim in and out, have hiding spots, and explore. Just make sure any holes in any decorations are all larger than a quarter otherwise they'll get stuck, and that any fake plants you put in are made of silk, not  hard plastic. Those will rip his fins if they get caught. Again, good luck!"

It was on sale at PetsSmart for a very reasonable price. This is my very first attempt to make a fish tank and I thoroughly enjoyed the set up although I may have gone a bit overboard with some of the decorations, ended up buys more than I needed but I figure I can change it up every now and then. I applied the water treatment products, heating unit and thermometer strip. From this view I'm standing at my kitchen sink looking at the front door. It has maintained a temp of 82 degrees for that past 5 hours, not sure if that's good or not."
bettafish,3dvu5s,Mister_Po,2,Sun Jul 19 23:22:57 2015 UTC,"82 is definitely within the appropriate temperature range for Bettas, so it if maintains that it will be perfect. My philosophy with Betta keeping is that you can never have too many decorations. Bettas love to squeeze behind and wind between decorations looking for things to eat and places to hide. I frequently find mine wedged behind plants staring back at me like it's normal."
bettafish,3dvu5s,Kiberz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:09:00 2015 UTC,That kind of behavior is exactly what I was hoping for. That's why I got a lot of fan/sword type live plants and a lot of different lush soft plastic plants.

bettafish,3dvf04,AllOfTimeAndSpace,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:14:00 2015 UTC,"For most fin rot, the best thing to do is keep clean, warm water (salt is optional) and it will clear up by itself. Sometimes, however, an antibiotic is necessary. I would keep an eye on it- if it gets worse, it may be time to try actual meds.   Worth noting, too, is that some bettas bite their tails. It's more common with the fish that have heavier fins, but some veiltails do it too."
bettafish,3dvf04,spazticcat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:39:04 2015 UTC,"I actually thought it might be tail biting.  Thought maybe the fin regrowth was itchy like when cats fur or stubble grows back...but it looks like his little fins (caudal fins?) that are on either side of his body up by his head are a little tattered too.  So, because of that I'm pretty sure its fin rot, but tail biting is still in my head to look out for.   Will the fact that I am doing a fish-in cycle at the moment effect his recovery? Should I attempt to keep him in his quarantine tank while that is going on or will the stress of being in his quarantine tank and having the constant full changes in there be worse for him?  He gets very depressed in there and it is almost impossible to keep the water parameters acceptable."
bettafish,3dvf04,spazticcat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"It does seem more likely to be fin rot if his pelvic/ventral (caudal is tail) fins are affected, too. I wouldn't medicate yet, but keep a close eye on it because you might need to later.   While a fish-in cycle can be stressful, I am of the opinion that it's still better than being in a cup or quarantine tank that basically needs daily 100% water changes."
bettafish,3dvf04,saint_maria,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:49:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yeah, I was thinking that the quarantine tank would be more stressful for him.  Especially since he really hates it.  He's so funny.  He gets legit mad at me when I have him in there.  In his big tank he always comes up and flirts with me when I talk to him.  He watches me and has all his fins up happily.  But, when he's in his quarantine tank and I have to change the water, when he goes back in his comes up to the front to look at me and flares his gills and gets all huffy.  He hates it.   I just really want him to get better.  I know it can take a while, but it was just so stressful to see that it looked like he was getting better and then all of a sudden all the progress seems to have disappeared.  The not knowing why is extra annoying.  If I knew why and it was something I could fix I would definitely do that, but the not knowing is killing me."
bettafish,3dvevg,motoman247,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:12:53 2015 UTC,"It does look to me more like Gibbs has a growth of some sort rather than being bloated, but I could be wrong. I don't know what to do for tumors, sorry. I would perhaps give him a salt bath as my first reaction?  The picture of Uncle Sam doesn't really tell me anything, but generally white patches are ich (which look more like grains of salt), fungal infections, or columnaris. I would research the latter two and see if they look like the patch. If not, perhaps it's an issue with his slime coat."

If it does, search for treatments for it. If not, keep and eye on it and be sure to keep his water spotless and a steady temp."
bettafish,3du1et,Moog226,2,Sun Jul 19 13:41:37 2015 UTC,"Yikes, that tattered melty look on his tail is a sure sign of chronic poor water condition. In order to help him heal you will need to heat his tank to 78-80° and make sure you are doing regular water changes. The smaller the tank the more water changes per week you do."
bettafish,3du1et,betta-believe-it,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:52:46 2015 UTC,"In the last picture, I see what looks like a spot of redness on the tip of his tail. That's usually a telltale sign of fin rot, but it's not always the case. Try putting a heater in the tank, and see if there is any improvement. If you already have a heater and his fins are getting worse, I recommend a salt bath treatment. If that doesn't work, he may be biting his own tail. There isn't a cute for that, unfortunately.

One day he was at the bottom of the tank, barely moving and I was told he had fin rot but no one has gotten him medicine. So, I researched and bought him drops so he could heal. I couldn't stop thinking about him and kept reading up on Bettas and realized he was living in pretty awful conditions because he was in a 1 gallon, unfiltered and unheated tank.   I asked if I could take him to try and nurse him back to health and they let me. I bought him a 3 gallon tank, a heater, filter, floating log, leaf hammock and some pretty plants and medicine. I decided then and there that he wasn't going back to the gym and they were cool with it   With the new tank and medicine, he perked up, the fin rot improved but he had this white growth that didn't improve with any meds. It didn't look like fungus so maybe it was a tumor. A few days ago, he couldn't swim right and kept sinking to the bottom of his tank. I thought maybe he got SBD and kept his water clean with Epsom salts but he didn't improve. I feel so bad because I think maybe all the water changes were too much and stressed him out. I really, really hope I didn't contribute to his suffering by trying to help.   Anyway, I never post on Reddit but my boyfriend and I just got back from burying Puppy at the park and I thought I'd share with people who would understand.

The rest is pretty much the same as with any other tank in terms of cycling and maintenance.   Good luck! Naturally planted tanks are awesome!"
bettafish,3drwuk,Astilaroth,4,Sat Jul 18 21:51:17 2015 UTC,"I think planted tanks really ""unlock"" the fun part about keeping an aquarium. Before I upgraded to a planted 10g, my aquarium was just there as a necessity for the fish. Now it's a mix of having a hobby and having a pet."

bettafish,3drwuk,Shills_for_fun,3,Sat Jul 18 22:12:10 2015 UTC,"Eh, I wouldn't house ghost shrimp with them. With a sorority there's a good chance at least 1 betta is going to figure out that they're edible. When they do figure that out, they will eat every one they find. Some people have success, others do not. It depends on the individual betta... and you have 5.  Ghost shrimp mostly work because they are quick swimmers who can hide very well.   My personal experience: I added two ghosties. He was fine with them for two weeks, even laying next to them. I figured that they were fine. Then one day, I left for two hours, and he ate one. While I was watching the aquarium, he swam up behind the other one and started flaring at it so I evacuated the last ghost shrimp and put him in a Tupperware container for like 2 weeks.  I upgraded my betta's tank and let the other shrimp return to the 5.5g. So if you're a softy like me you might end up with an accidental shrimp tank.  TL;DR You have 5 bettas. It's a coin flip for a single betta whether or not they will live with shrimp. They can change their minds at any time and have a sashimi buffet while you're gone."

bettafish,3drwuk,Shills_for_fun,2,Sun Jul 19 00:09:57 2015 UTC,"Nerite snails are pretty cute and they eat algae like champs. Corys or otos might work too.  You might want to wait and see if algae is actually a problem. Algae eaters aren't really great to have if you don't have much algae for them to eat, IMO. If you're worried about algae, you can combat most of it by not having too much light and not having too many nutrients."

bettafish,3drwuk,betta-believe-it,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:26:08 2015 UTC,"Well, I might not be the best to ask.   See, I only pick low light, hardy plants for my tanks.  In my betta tank, I have a piece of driftwood with christmas moss and anubias attached to it. I have some aponogeton which serve as my tall, leafy plants that my betta can swim around/enjoy. They get way too big for my aquarium, but the leaves end up kind of making a canopy over a small portion of the tank to filter the light. (Before someone chimes in, it's maybe 10% of the surface of the water. He can get air)  My shrimp tank has driftwood with java moss and java ferns. I have some anacharis in there as well but my shrimp like the other stuff way more.  All of these plants are fairly hardy and need only a modest amount of light and care. I don't need to worry about shutting the lights off, because frankly these plants don't require much of it.   So yeah, if you want a list of betta-approved plants, I'd say:   Java moss and Christmas moss. Tie to rocks or driftwood. Java ferns. Tie to rocks or driftwood. Anubias.  Tie to rocks or driftwood. Aponogeton - stupidly cheap and gets to be tall and leafy. Can grow in gravel with nutrients.   If you want some stuff that grows on the floor, you can try some wisteria, which is another durable plant. I don't have it solely because I'd need to put some soil down just for one plant."

bettafish,3draqm,bettaquestion,4,Sat Jul 18 18:23:53 2015 UTC,"There is a sticky top post with a care sheet that you could use as a starting point.  Would you be willing to spend some money on it? What might really work with a kid is to show him 'whooaah awesome fish tanks' online, something that resonates with him and then go out and get him a bigger tank and sneak in the stuff that he needs to take proper care of the fish too.   Personally I'm a fan of very naturally planted tanks, but since we're talking a kid here maybe try aquarium-decoration like skulls, pirate-treasure, sponge bob, even TMNT (how cool would that look between some plants!)... stuff like that.   If you are getting a bigger tank, try to use the things that are in the old filter for the new one. No matter how crap and uncared the tank currently is, in the old filter will be bacteria living that help with the nitrogen cycle (converting harmful stuff to less harmful stuff). You'll see it as a brownish muddy gunk.   If you're interested in this hobby yourself, you could also get an awesome tank of your own and either make him envious (kids are big on mimicking!) or just eventually put his fish in there.

Having a heated tank does give them extra comfort/energy which he can use right now. Since heating up a 1 gal isn't all that easy the best thing you can do is float that quarantine tank in your regular heated tank (assuming you have it). Obviously make sure it doesn't sink, he needs to be able to get to the surface.  I have a rescue as well which looked at least as bad as yours, he made it and is doing great now.

bettafish,3dng90,HalcyonEndures,3,Fri Jul 17 18:20:05 2015 UTC,"Betta fish, Betta splendens, need a filtered, heated, properly maintained aquarium (with a lid) just like any other tropical fish. The minimum size recommendations vary, but most people say either 2.5, 3, or 5 gallons is the absolute minimum tank size. The bigger you get, the better! Read up on the aquarium nitrogen cycle. Larger tanks are easier to maintain. Bettas are carnivores, so their food should reflect that. Feeding a varied diet is best- primarily pellets or flakes, but adding treats like frozen bloodworms, too. Hidey holes and plants are needed, too- a bare tank can stress bettas. They enjoy sitting on and swimming between plants. Be careful with decorations, though- if they'd tear pantyhose, they'll tear your betta's fins."
bettafish,3dng90,spazticcat,4,Fri Jul 17 18:39:14 2015 UTC,"My advice? Set aside $150.  $40 10g kit (includes filter and heater) $5 gravel $15 decoration $5 water treatment supplement $7 bottled bacteria $4 fish food $2 thermometer $25 API Water Test Kit. You need this. $8 siphon for water changes $5 a couple of buckets    The other ~$30 is basically unexpected shit you need for your tank. lol Edit:  oh, and cycle the tank before you add fish to it. Read up on ways to cycle. It's not cheap to start up a tank. Maintenance in a 10g is another story. Once you're ""settled"" you'll only occasionally buy a plant or maybe some medicine if needed. In a 10g, water treatment stuff is going to last you forever."

bettafish,3dng90,Mister_Po,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:01:48 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it is a low estimate. That's what I consider the bare minimum. You can make air pump/sponge filters for pretty cheap but honestly  I don't think doing it piecemeal is cheaper at all. What you do get is customizability. Like an Eheim heater, a sponge filter, etc.  If you want a planted tank, the cost goes up. Low tech plants? Sure, $30 should cover your decorations cost. Medium? Oh, you need subtrate now. And flourish/excel. Maybe even a CO2 system. Needy plants? Need ""intermittent"" supplements like Trace.  Plants aren't exactly necessary so I left most of that out. I am totally with you on the ""occasionally"" buying plants thing. You come across an interesting piece of driftwood and suddenly you are spending your evening tying plants to it."
bettafish,3dng90,Shills_for_fun,2,Fri Jul 17 23:07:25 2015 UTC,"Betta essential includes but not limited to:   5+ gallon tank (i'll discuss this below) filter: this is for cycling the tank (read up on fish less cycle). It's basically mean establishing a healthy amount of beneficial bacterias in the filter media that breaks down fish waste, using household ammonia instead of waste from the betta. This is important because fish in cycle (using fish to cycle) can easily leads to casualty. Also, in my experience a tank below 5 gallon would be too small for a filter, thus pushing the betta around. heater: bettas are tropical fish, and will be lethargic if temp is too low, below 78F. A heater not only make sure high temp, but also keep the temperature constant. A fluctuate temp can stress the fish and lower its immune system. You can get a adjustable heater, as automatic ones are just a pain, dangerous and waste you money. API master test kit: helps you read water parameters. Absolutely essential for beginners, especially while cycling. Buy the liquid test instead of paper test, since its more accurate and save you money.   Once the tank is done cycling (read up on it), you can then get the betta, real plants (low tech ones like java fern, java moss, anubias), and decoration (driftwood or rock)."
bettafish,3dng90,le_nguyen349,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:48:39 2015 UTC,Live plants are perfectly fine to add prior to cycling. I actually prefer to plant early because it gives the plants plenty of time to become established before a fish comes along and tries to pull them out of the substrate. Decor also will house at least a small amount of bacteria and are fine to add pre cycle.
bettafish,3dollk,onebat4u,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:46:20 2015 UTC,"Plexiglass is clear, so the betta might stress each other out and jump the divider. Search up online for a DIY divider that is made of plastic mesh canvas from Walmart. Also be sure to cycle the tank beforehand!"

I have attached sponge to both sections with success. Does your filter have a valve to strengthen or lessen the output? Another thing you can do along with the sponge is plant a bunch of live or silk plants around the output.

bettafish,3dl7uq,spazticcat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:02:48 2015 UTC,"You could try Jungle's Fungus Clear (Walmart) or API Fungus Cure (LFS). I don't know a whole lot about what chemicals are used for what for treating fish, but both of those say they treat fungal and bacterial infections. If the first one doesn't work, check the active ingredient on the second. If it's different, try it next, if not, get a different type of antibacterial. Avoid melafix/pimafix/Bettafix as these can all harm your fish's labyrinth organ and kill him."
bettafish,3dlafd,Donnie373,2,Fri Jul 17 04:45:46 2015 UTC,"Uh, purely speculative, but...  I think wheat flower is there to keep all the other shit together. You can't just pound dried fish/shrimp guts into a ball I guess.  Bettas can eat a lot of things, actually. They're carnivores and need meat-based things, but my betta used to eat algae wafers  that were totally not meant for him and gave him zero nutritional benefits (wtf, Alpha?)  So yeah, if I had to guess, it's there to help bind the ingredients into a little pellet, and it's okay for the betta to eat it (even if wheat doesn't do anything for them)."
bettafish,3dlafd,Shills_for_fun,2,Fri Jul 17 04:54:42 2015 UTC,"garlic is used pretty often to make the pallets more appetizing, so it's not as weird as it seems. Wheat can be used as a filler or binder (gluten), it's not ideal and the food should be avoided if wheat one of the main ingredients.    Most pellets do expand a bit in water (I can't feed one of my bettas pellets for this reason), but not nearly as much as bread does. Furthermore, bettas are carnivores and do better on a high protein high fat diet, compared to a high carbohydrate diet."
bettafish,3dlafd,how_fedorable,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:55:21 2015 UTC,"Curious as to why you can't feed pellets due to expansion? I purposefully presoak my pellets, then feed. That way the pellet doesn't swell inside the fish :)"
bettafish,3dlafd,sexytimespanda,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:31:30 2015 UTC,"That particular betta was apparently very sensitive, he got swimbladder issues whenever I fed him pellets. Presoaking didn't seem to help much, so I switched him to frozen food, never had the same issue again. My other bettas are just fine with the pellets, so maybe he's just weird."
bettafish,3dlafd,how_fedorable,2,Fri Jul 17 19:43:28 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, bread is really not a good for any animal. I don't think it's bad, just not good. I think the flour in betta pellets is either used as a filler or a binder. Maybe? Bread also has other ingredients, and maybe some of them are bad for bettas. I do know that the pellets expand, so some people recommend floating them in some aquarium water prior to feeding your fish. I don't think it's the flour that causes them to expand, but rather the way they're made.   I am no expert, so I could be talking out my ass, but I feel like I'm not too far from the truth... Maybe not the same state, but hopefully at least the right country."

I treated him with Maracyn and aquarium salt, but I think I discovered it too late. I had to do several water changes before I was comfortable getting a new fish.  This little guy is a blast to watch. He seems to have a much easier time getting around than long-finned bettas; he almost never stops darting around the tank. His colors have actually gotten even more vibrant in the past few days since I snapped this photo.  I got him at Old Town Aquarium in Chicago. Unfortunately, one of his buddies was not so lucky, being sold along with an unheated fishbowl to a guy looking for a pet for his kid. I really wish they wouldn't sell fishbowls since it is a pretty serious aquarium shop... pretty disappointed in them for that. That betta is going to have a hard time making it through a Chicago winter in an unheated bowl."

PetCo for sure sells a kit for this, I don't know what the UK equivalent would be-- airline tubing and two suction cups will do. Basically extend a line from the tank water into a bucket and let it DRIP into the bucket for 2-3 hours or until the bucket is pretty full. Leave him alone in the tank for a full day, besides giving a little food. Cover the tank with a towel so the light doesn't make a reflection inside the glass he could stress out over. Uncover at night, so he can 'wake up' with the dawn instead of just sudden light. Don't mess with him for the sake of pictures! Just let him figure things out. If you have another free tank, I might let him chill in that for a week or so. The scent of the other fish in your divided tank might be a stressor, methinks."

When the fish arrived it was alive, but in a few days it developed dropsy and died. Luckily I had taken screenshots of the shipping delays and pictures of the water tests from the bag the fish arrived in (8ppm+ ammonia and 5ppm+ nitrite :c ) and I was able to get a full refund.

Your fish will fall asleep and your want to keep adding clove oil to overdose him. You don't have to do this next bit, but I did, just to make certain cloud was gone: scoop your fish into the little container (if he fits) and put him in the freezer. Make sure you don't take him out of the treated water, otherwise he may wake up if you didn't use enough clove oil. Merely sticking a fish in the freezer is not a good way to euthanize him, but if he's in the treated water, he'll be unconcious."

bettafish,3dieow,perhapsso,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:26:38 2015 UTC,"1 galon tank with a air stone, the temp is ok i think (i live in a tropical place)... and  I cant stop feeding him, how long he can go without eating?"
bettafish,3dieow,perhapsso,4,Thu Jul 16 15:36:09 2015 UTC,"Bettas can go weeks without food. Over feeding can cause bloat and even death. Their stomich is the size of their eye. How much are you feeding a day? Flakes or pellets? If he is bloated you have to stop feeding for it to get better. I'd say fast him for a 5-7 days and see if he improves. He will not starve.  Keeping the temperature stable is more important than keeping it accurate. You are shooting for 76-81 fahrenheit or 24-27 celsius.   Bettas also need more space than a one gallon tank provides. Most people around here suggest 2.5 gallons as a minimum. He also doesn't need an air stone because they breath air from the surface though their labyrinth organ. You should however be running a filter.  Have you checked your water parameters? Ammonia, nitrite, nitrate?"
bettafish,3dieow,Shills_for_fun,3,Thu Jul 16 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"A betta can easily go 4-5 days without food. Sometimes much longer, but I don't think it's healthy to starve them for more than a week. Regarding the actual feeding, ignore the directions on the package. They're wrong and they'll kill your fish.  If you haven't fasted him, try it for a day or two. I usually fast him one day/week just to ""clean him out.""  Like /u/perhapsso said, I'd consider upgrading your tank. Your water quality is going to be terrible in a 1g and it is considerably easier to keep a healthy tank (Read: healthy fish) when it's bigger (I personally recommend a 5.5 or 10g). It's not just about ""happiness of the fish"", it's about your happiness, too.  I don't think you enjoy doing water changes every day in that 1g.  Edit: Oh, welcome to /r/bettafish. The advice might seem a little pushy at times but it's all with the best intentions. I understand if you don't want to buy new tanks or don't have the means to, but the fish's health depends on a lot of that kind of stuff so in an unfiltered 1g (especially if you don't do daily massive water changes), you're assuming a good bit of risk on the fish's health."
bettafish,3dieow,Clarinut,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:45:14 2015 UTC,"If he is having trouble with water depth regulation (floating or sinking), that points to a problem with his swim bladder. This can be caused by a) injury, in which case it's hard to fix but shouldn't impact your betta's life too much, b) constipation, which is fairly common and will resolve itself in a week if you don't feed him, or c) infection, which is also possible if you are keeping him in a small tank without a lot of water qualities.   So let's rule out the possibilities! Starting with infection, if you don't know already here's a brief overview of the aquarium nitrogen cycle: Fish will produce waste in the form of ammonia, which is toxic for fish at any level. In established tanks (takes around a month for a small tank to become established), that ammonia will foster growth of beneficial bacteria, which convert the ammonia into nitrite, which is unfortunately still toxic. The cycle happens again, and more bacteria grow which converts nitrite into nitrate. Nitrate is OK in small quantities, and at the end of the cycle you should only have some nitrate in the water (because all the ammonia and nitrite are getting converted by the bacteria). When you do weekly water changes, this is what you are filtering out. If you want to get a water quality test kit ($5-$25 online or at your pet store) that would help. 0.25ppm ammonia or nitrite is toxic (the lowest reading on the test), but nitrate is okay up to around 60ppm.   So think about when the last time you changed your water was. Live plants will also help filter out the ammonia and keep your water quality good.   Actually, now that I think about it, this is way more information than you need. Here's what I'd do:   Do a 100% water change and make sure to condition the new water and allow it to settle to the same temperature (~78 deg F). Acclimate the betta. Buy some aquarium salt. This is very cheap and you can probably get a lifetime supply for $4 at your local pet store. Add in a bit, following the instructions on the package. The salt is a mild but effective treatment for any infections and worked wonders for one of my bettas who had the same problem.  Monitor the betta and change 50% of the water every week.    Shills_for_fun has good points but is exaggerating a bit. Your 1 gallon unfiltered tank is FINE for the betta. You could spoil him some and put him in a bigger tank, but it is really not a huge deal as long as you keep up with water changes. You don't even need an air stone really, but there's not much harm. Actually, in a small tank it's better not to have a filter, because current can damage the betta's delicate fins. Just make sure to do 100% water changes every week and you will be fine.  source: I've had betta fish for years, I did a high school project on the fish cycle and ammonia does not build up significantly in a 1 gallon tank with 1 betta fish, and I've worked with the professional fish veterinarian at NC State Veterinary school, Dr. Lewbart.  Another note-- You should check how much your feeding your betta. It's very easy to overfeed. Feeding a bit once a day is fine-- don't feed more than he can eat in 2 minutes and remember that his stomach is the size of his eye. If you want to be extra careful, you can even soak the food before feeding him so the dryness doesn't cause constipation.   Let me know if you have questions or want more details!"
bettafish,3djnun,shemp117,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:29:06 2015 UTC,"I don't have personal experience with that filter, but once it's cycled, you can put the betta in to see if the current bothers him. If it does, you can look up ways to baffle the filter, which will reduce the current."

There are a lot of plants that require very little maintenance and no CO2 like anacharis, hortwort, java ferns, java moss, and anubias.  Anubias, java ferns, and java moss are my favorite because you can tie them to pieces of driftwood (no special floor substrate needed, you can keep your gravel) and it looks really nice. You can get pre-soaked driftwood at Petco for a little as $5 and plant deals on ebay for under $15.   Just read up on ""quarantining"" it for a couple days because a lot of people keep their plants with snails and fish. Just a precaution, easy peasy."

bettafish,3dh0fc,Shills_for_fun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:36:27 2015 UTC,"Ebay has been good to me. Mostly. Of course, it's kind of a gamble on the quality unless you go to your LFS. You'll never see the exact plant you're buying. Spending a few extra bucks for a top seller's plants is highly advisable. I received a packet of plants which took me a month to re-grow because they were 90% dead on arrival. Not worth the $2 I saved!  I also got a packet of mosses and java ferns/anubia from Malaysia and they are very healthy.  If you go the ebay route, get a highly decorated seller. That might be the difference between you receiving green java moss and brown java moss.  Watch out for Petsmart and Petco ""tube"" plants. Not all of those plants are actually submersible water plants lol. However, if you want to guarantee yourself a super healthy anubia nana, you can get them from Petsmart for like $7. Just take a look at the leaves and make sure they're not browning. The packaging is pretty neat; they come rooted in gel packs which serve as water which you just wash off prior to putting them on your rocks/driftwood.  As far as Petsmart and Petco tank plants are concerned, I'd avoid it due to the fact that they're almost always with various fish.  Bettas enjoy tall, leafy plants. Java ferns might work for that purpose if you tie them to the top of a piece of driftwood or something.  I also have some aponogeton in my tank but these plants get super big.  I am new to planted tanks but it's a fun part of the hobby. Regarding where you should ideally get them, I think the only real difference is that in person (at a LFS that isn't a Petsmart/Petco), you can check out the tank. You can see if they grow them with fish or shrimp, or snails, and if things are sickly or dead in the tank. Granted, I never had a single problem on Ebay. Most of the big sellers farm the plants as their business so they do take care of them well."

bettafish,3dl3b8,COWBOYDYL,21,Fri Jul 17 03:35:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to make you feel bad, and I'm trying to be tactful here, but that... tank is just way too small for even a single fish. Ask anyone who is actually knowledgeable about bettas, and they will either recommend 2.5, 3, or 5 gallons minimum for a betta. As with any fish, they need proper space to swim and a filter. Since bettas are tropical, they also need a heater. I would strongly recommend you get two filtered and heated 3 gallon tanks, or divide a 5 or 10 gallon. You don't have to buy a whole starter kit- sponge filters work great for bettas, and are, from what I understand, cheap and easy to make. The more room your fish has to move around, the more of a personality you get to see! You have two pretty boys, I hate to see them living in such conditions."

We need tank size, if the tank is filtered and heated, who your betta shares the tank with (if any), how long its been up and running, and your tanks water parameters - ammonia, nitrate, nitrite"
bettafish,3dfl6f,cheese_on_rye,2,Thu Jul 16 00:12:06 2015 UTC,"10 gallon tank, no heater, only him in the tank. He is still very active and seems happy.  Tried using the filter but it caused to many waves on the top of the water.  We he had been in the tank for a month and a half before this developed.  We change our full water once every two weeks and half once a week.  I put basic water conditioner.. That's all I know..."
bettafish,3dfl6f,SkepticJoker,16,Thu Jul 16 00:25:28 2015 UTC,"Wait... so, no heater, or filter?  Welp, there's your problem. Stagnant water develops mold, and gets gross. Not to mention, the nitrifying bacteria can't stay alive. You need that bacteria to turn toxic ammonia into less harmful nitrates. It needs oxygen, and oxygenation means water movement is needed.  You should get a sponge filter, as other said. Also, a heater. You can get all of that for not even 30 bucks.   And stop doing full water changes. That's way too much. Fish need stability. Do 50%, or so, once every two weeks. Preferably, a little less, a little more often.  I don't mean to sound harsh, but I realise this kind of comes across that way. It tends to happen in this subreddit, at times, but it comes from a place of kindness. It's also usually due to pet store salesmen either way under-educating their customers, or straight up lying about proper care."
bettafish,3dfl6f,cheese_on_rye,7,Thu Jul 16 01:05:58 2015 UTC,"hmm.. at first glance it looks like a fungus, but they are usually white, not brown. very strange! Can you get another picture or maybe a video?  Just a Side Note: Theres a great little filter you can find on amazon that has an adjustable flow. I have three and even bought one for my brother‘s betta tank.   I also recommend getting a small heater if you can- they not only heat the tank, they also keep the temperature of the water stable. The temperature of the water fluctuates with the temperature of your home/its surroundings. Fluctuating temperatures can stress your fish and lower their immune system."
bettafish,3dfl6f,zNOMbie,3,Thu Jul 16 00:40:04 2015 UTC,"Should put the filter back in, but you can purchase filter sponge to stuff a little in the intake to reduce the flow. Heater is also beneficial and actually quite necessary.   Water changes should be 15-30% once a week, every week."

bettafish,3db5qv,xtremetuffguy,5,Tue Jul 14 22:25:54 2015 UTC,Have you checked out a sponge filter with an air pump?
bettafish,3db5qv,perhapsso,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:50:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'm gonna look into it"
bettafish,3db5qv,Shills_for_fun,2,Wed Jul 15 10:46:07 2015 UTC,"There are lids built for filters that sit on the top of the tank.   You can look into buying a new sponge filter like /u/perhapsso said, or you can just build a baffle for your strong filter.  If you want to go the cheap route, buy a bottle of water, unflavored. cut off both ends of the bottle, then cut a seam across the side so you have  a sheet that curls inward. Hook that around the water source and boom, you fix your current problem.  Sponge filters are highly recommended here. I've considered making the switch but I just bought a new bio media as well as a bag of Purigen so....  I guess that doesn't help you too much if you truly want something inside the tank and not on the edge, but if the current and the lid are your big concerns, this is another idea."
bettafish,3db5qv,Mister_Po,2,Wed Jul 15 00:49:34 2015 UTC,"There are many lids that have punchout sections for filters to fit, and if you are little handy you can make a lid yourself. There are a lot of ways to baffle power filters, from ziptying on sponges or making a baffle yourself like /u/Shills_for_fun says.   I prefer power filters to sponge, just because of the mechanical/chemical filtration benefit. They are easy enough to baffle if you take the time. A baffled 10 gallon filter would be just fine in a 5 gallon. I run a 30 gallon on mine, and never had an issue, though I tend to overfilter on all my tanks."

bettafish,3db0qn,scarab1066,6,Tue Jul 14 21:49:11 2015 UTC,What is your temperature? Bettas can be lethargic if the water is too cool.
bettafish,3db0qn,Oolonger,6,Tue Jul 14 23:56:10 2015 UTC,Perhaps he doesn't like his tankmates? Sometimes bettas can get stressed if there's too much going on in their tank.
bettafish,3db0qn,ZeldaMusic113,2,Wed Jul 15 00:31:14 2015 UTC,What kind of shrimp? Ghost shrimp are small and wimpy. Amano shrimp might be intimidating to your betta.
bettafish,3db0qn,Shills_for_fun,2,Wed Jul 15 04:20:31 2015 UTC,Ghost / cherry shrimp but I suspect one is an amino from its size. Temp is 80c. I thought it could be tank mates but why the slow decline? If he was unhappy with them surely he would have been miserable sooner?
bettafish,3db0qn,Shills_for_fun,2,Wed Jul 15 05:30:46 2015 UTC,"Bettas don't really have a stimulus-response type of behavior. My betta was perfectly okay with my ghost shrimp. He'd even lay next to them. One random week, he decided to eat the smaller one, and would flare at the bigger one when he came across him (I now have a 5.5g for one shrimp...yay). It might be a territory thing, who knows...  I'm not saying it's absolutely your shrimp, but tank mates introduce a dynamic with territory sometimes.   I assume you mean 80F because 80C is 20C away from boiling. 80F is a good temperature."
bettafish,3db0qn,Howlibu,2,Wed Jul 15 05:40:29 2015 UTC,Yes 80f sorry. So how can I test territory? Move him out or segregate him in some way. He is not flaring at all at anything. Just propping against either plants or the wood.
bettafish,3db0qn,Shills_for_fun,2,Wed Jul 15 05:54:24 2015 UTC,"It might even be too warm. I had 2 bettas in the same tank (separated) and kept it at 80F. The halfmoon loved it, the veil tail was much happier around 76-78. It's weird, but bettas in my experience are some of the most personable fish out there."
bettafish,3db0qn,Oolonger,0,Wed Jul 15 17:30:46 2015 UTC,"You can't really test territory other than watching how they interact with one another. One thing you can try to do is rearrange the decorations which will make them hunt out ""new"" spots. I don't know why your betta is being so shy, usually they're the asshole in the tank lol."

bettafish,3daniw,antaios256,2,Tue Jul 14 20:17:13 2015 UTC,"Don't use a bubble nest as a sign of happiness. It's a sign of him wanting to mate.

bettafish,3daniw,ZeldaMusic113,2,Tue Jul 14 21:47:16 2015 UTC,"that's why I said he could be horny, that said his tail fin when not bitten off is longer than his body"
bettafish,3daniw,Howlibu,2,Wed Jul 15 17:51:48 2015 UTC,"Try rearranging or adding plants to his tank, give him new spaces to explore! I think it's good to do this once in a while, keeps things new. Curiosity and the energy to explore are healthy signs!   Also make sure the flow isn't too high on your filter, that can cause a lot of stress. Wouldn't hurt to get your parameters checked too and rule out any chemical causes of stress (too much ammonia, etc)"

bettafish,3d5d6g,slidewithme,3,Mon Jul 13 22:07:52 2015 UTC,I was waiting until I felt confident he was getting better. This second week was the hardest. He had constant stress lines and was very lethargic. The last two days or so he's perked back up and looks to be doing better! :)
bettafish,3d5d6g,2cookieparties,3,Mon Jul 13 22:18:08 2015 UTC,"Good work! My mom also successfully treated her betta for dropsy by literally scooping him out of the water and using a soft paintbrush to apply diluted tea tree oil directly onto his body, then putting him back.   I'm not sure if this is recommended, but her fish got better."
bettafish,3d5d6g,sutekhxaos,2,Mon Jul 13 22:16:24 2015 UTC,"Oh wow. I just treated him with API general cure in case it was caused by parasites, then did a couple of large water changes (of course not all in one day). Then I treated him with an antibacterial medicine in case it was caused by bacteria then did several large water changes afterward. Of course adding in AQ salt with the medication to help."
bettafish,3d5d6g,2cookieparties,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:02:55 2015 UTC,woa. that's full on!  he didn't flap around?
bettafish,3d5d6g,sutekhxaos,2,Tue Jul 14 05:04:53 2015 UTC,I'm sure he wasn't 100% cooperative.

bettafish,3d4rjt,dandelionesss,11,Mon Jul 13 14:52:30 2015 UTC,"This subreddit is a little overzealous when it comes to care for bettas, since we love them so much and we want the best for them, but you can do okay with setups that are substandard by our criteria.   I would upgrade to a larger bowl. I've seen bowls up to 3 gallons fairly inexpensively. Or consider a large size ""Critter Keeper"" for a tank. Then add in a bubble filter and keep the tank in a warm area and you will do okay. Adding a heater is a bit more tricky, but there are heaters out there designed to work on plastic aquariums, and they would work fine in a critter keeper."

bettafish,3d4rjt,a_guile,4,Mon Jul 13 23:40:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm, maybe see if you can find some 2-3 gallon containers. This is still a small tank for a betta but it is much better than 1 gallon containers. 5 Gallons would be ideal.  Also look into finding some live plants for the tanks. Java moss and Java ferns are fast growing and will help control the ammonia and nitrates in the tanks."
bettafish,3d4rjt,whipped_honey,3,Mon Jul 13 15:38:23 2015 UTC,"Hm okay, the plants sound like a good idea. Thank you."
bettafish,3d4rjt,whipped_honey,3,Mon Jul 13 15:53:53 2015 UTC,"Also marimo moss balls, they are like plants but almost unkillable. They will help process ammonia, but require much less work to keep alive, and are thus less likely to die and decompose, adding even MORE ammonia to the tank like plants often do in a newbie's tank."
bettafish,3d4rjt,whipped_honey,2,Mon Jul 13 17:09:15 2015 UTC,That does sound like a much better option for me.

Can I move Levi before I switch filters? Should I use the one it has or just go without for a day?  How do I switch him from unheated to heated?"
bettafish,3d4rjt,violetfield,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:40:11 2015 UTC,"Tell me more about what filter you have, it may well be fine if you baffle it, and you may not need to order another. Yes, you can move him before you switch filters, and when you do switch filters, just make sure his water conditions change slowly. So I'd move some of his existing water into the new empty tank, and move him over, then I'd slowly fill the tank with clean water that has set out long enough that it is the same temperature as the water in the tank (like you are doing a water change). Then put the heater in and set it a couple degrees above current temperature. Keep raising it slowly until you are at the temperature you want it to be. Or if it is not a settable heater, just add it in a couple hours after doing the water change.   The big important thing is to make sure all changes go slowly. If you take a fish out of terrible conditions and move it instantly to perfect ones, the shock of the change can actually kill the fish.   Edit: And honestly, if you are going to be switching filters, don't even put the first one in at all, they really don't do much good for the first several days you have them."

My space is limited so I bought a 5 gallon tank and made a barrier between it to house both betta fish with the minimum 2.5 gallons. The fins on this one seem a little uneven and I was unsure if this is fin rot or not. How should I go about treating it and should I put him in a separate tank from the other betta while treating him? I only have the half gallon tank though and currently cannot afford another one. In the next month or two I hope to get another 3-5 gallon tank so they can each have their own, just unsure of what to do until then.

So start by doing a large waterchange (50% or more) now and keep up with regular changes from now on (probably a couple of times per week). Adding stress coat as a conditioner can also help him regrow his fins faster.  Since it sounds like you didn't cycle the tank (leave it running with ammonia/fishfood for a month), you are now doing a fish-in cycle, I suggest you pick up a liquid test kit (the api master test kit is good), test the water often and do a waterchange everytime ammonia or nitrite is more than 0 ppm."

bettafish,3d0vsj,Sizzboom,4,Sun Jul 12 16:15:27 2015 UTC,Long story short a friend of mine had this betta in MAYBE a .5 gallon tank and I made him give it up to try to save its life. Is this tail rot? It has a hard time swimming :(   Was thinking about adding a little bit of salt to help it. Currently it's in a 5.5gallon tank
bettafish,3d0vsj,spazticcat,4,Sun Jul 12 16:16:33 2015 UTC,"It looks like fin rot. Warm, clean water to prevent spread/infection is a good starting point (a little aquarium salt is okay, too). If it gets worse, try an antibiotic from the pet/fish store."

You will need an airline control like this to adjust the amount of air going into your filter. I think that is a fine amount of bubbles, but see how he reacts.   I haven't seen that filter before. Carbon needs to be replaced monthly which may be difficult, and I don't see any bio-media in there. The carbon won't hurt, but your tank may not cycle without media. Look up nitrogen cycle.   Fill up the tank!! and get a lid. Bettas need the air they breath at the surface to be the same temp as the tank.   Your tank should be between 76 and 80 degrees F. Get a heater. And a test kit."
bettafish,3d2n33,sterlingthecatdoesit,2,Mon Jul 13 03:30:21 2015 UTC,"It looks a little strong in my opinion. You may want to swap out that filter for just a standard sponge filter.

Heat is of most importance at this stage!"

Here's a picture of Puppy in his cup while I changed his water: http://imgur.com/AvDdcCU  I should add that he came from an unheated, unfiltered 1g tank with infrequent water changes. I fishnapped him and he's now in a heated, 3g tank.   It's currently not filtered or cycled due to the medication but it's something I plan on doing once he's better. I've read fish in cycling is hard on them so I'm a bit scared to stress him out even more. Are those bottles of cycling bacteria any good? I'd like to add real plants as well. So many plans but first I need this little guy feeling better. I'm so attached to him now!  Edit: I just noticed that he looks bloated in that photo. I got him some Daphnia and that helped a lot.

bettafish,3d0f4w,chrisracer24,3,Sun Jul 12 13:19:39 2015 UTC,"20g or more tank, I say feed them same as the male unless they're significantly tiny. Do research. Odd numbers are best, 3, 5, 7, or 9 fish for your sorority, no even numbers. Give them many many hiding places to escape/cover to break eyesight should they get bullied. Introduce them at the same time if possible so nobody has already claimed territory. They will fight to establish the dominant female, and flare or bluff each other constantly. It may take a while for them to figure it out, they may nip holes in their fins. Have fin healing medicine on hand. If one is just way too aggressive they may be better off as a solitary fish, as they are very territorial.  I have 3 half moon plakat girls of my own (one tiny, one normal sized, one monster) and the tiniest one is the most aggressive. When I feed (a couple pellets more for the monster as she's substantially larger), they crowd wherever my hand is and compete for the closest spot. Be careful, I've had 2 jumpouts while feeding too close to the edge, though no harm done since there was a carpet. Now I feed in the middle of the tank, in three different spots so I can see how much they're all eating individually and they don't steal quite as much food from each other. They will always compete forever so just try to feed them away from each other. It's not much different from feeding your male.   They have so much personality. Someday soon I'll post a pic of my setup, they are quite extraordinary, spirited and exotically colored females :)"

You need to get one, a test kit, and read up on fish in cycling.  What you're doing is not good for your betta - you should not be doing full water changes in that big of a tank, and you certainly shouldn't be without a filter.  He's very likely experiencing a lot of spikes that are causing him problems, along with the underfeeding."

bettafish,3cxw3i,chiwowapowa,8,Sat Jul 11 19:36:22 2015 UTC,Are there open holes in your lid? Your betta could have very well jumped out and is lying somewhere near his tank. Check the entire tank throughly then check the surround area throughly.   edit: autocorrect hates me
bettafish,3cxw3i,ZeldaMusic113,5,Sat Jul 11 22:10:24 2015 UTC,"There would still be the body if he died, THEN the ghost shrimp eat him (little chance the shrimps actually hunt him down and eat him, they only eat dead fish).

bettafish,3cxs3c,20CharacterUsernames,2,Sat Jul 11 19:01:51 2015 UTC,"You can get healthy fish at Petco or Petsmart. At my local big box stores, I'd say 80% are fairly healthy. Some LFS will put them in 1g jars but will sell them for $20+. TBH Unless you're looking for something very particular, a big box store fish is fine.   A piece of advice that I'm going to hand over is don't always follow instructions on the packaging unless its chemical treatment of water or medicine. Fish food companies intentionally make you over-feed, and filter cartridges are not something you need to constantly replace.  Edit: Your filter does need some maintenance, so make sure you google that."
bettafish,3cxs3c,Shills_for_fun,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:44:43 2015 UTC,"I live in a big city so we have local fish stores (LFS) that have bettas kept in big aerated and heated displays. It costs a couple bucks more but most of their fish available were super healthy. I have bought bettas from chain pet stores and it's been fine, they lived a normal life expectancy, except I had to take some extra time to rehabilitate them to get them healthy after purchasing them. That being said petcosmart still had better care than a small local store I went into one time.   You can also look on aquabid or r/aquaswap. Aquabid led me to a local store that sells only bettas shipped from Thailand, and there are some expensive and fancy fish there.   My other advice is get a heater and a filter! A lot of betta care says they're fine without but your fish will flourish with room to swim, heat and moving aerated water.   Bettas also enjoy live plants! You don't need  a fancy get up to have plants, just do some research on low light plants!"
bettafish,3cxs3c,DarkDefenderDaxter,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:17:43 2015 UTC,"Read up on cycling first. As for healthy bettas, some retailers take good care of their animals, others ar abysmal. Breeders (aquabid.com or ebay) usually have beautiful and healthy fish, but they cost way more and often have to be shipped."
bettafish,3cxs3c,how_fedorable,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:13:27 2015 UTC,"If it's your first betta, I would probably stick with getting one at your local fish store or big box store (Petsmart or Petco, don't go with Walmart). Having a betta shipped to you as your very first betta seems a little excessive especially if you're not totally sure the fish thing is going to suit you! I do work at PetSmart so I may seem biased, but most of our bettas are pretty healthy given the conditions they live in prior to sale. Every store is supposed to do water changes on their entire betta stock 2 times a week, but care differs from store to store just like some local fish retailers are great while others are junk. Really just depends on your area. If you go into a store (big box or local) and all of the fish seem dead or dying, that's a big red flag that either their care is lacking or they had a bad shipment. It happens to us sometimes where just about every betta we get in is in poor shape, but it's pretty rare. Basically, while you're cycling, shop around. BUT ONLY WINDOW SHOP!! No matter where you choose to buy from, give the betta you're interested in a good once over in the store. Make sure you avoid a betta with clamped fins, horizontal (stress) striping, unusual fin tears, blackness around fin edges, etc. If anything seems ""off"" don't go for it. Most stores offer a health guarantee, so ask about it! At PetSmart, you're given 14 days from the time of purchase to return the fish if anything seems wrong or if it should die. My local fish store only offers as 24 hour guarantee and they only offer exchanges, not simply refunds, so definitely ask about that.   What you're describing in terms of color sounds like maybe cellophane or pastel!"
bettafish,3cx1ut,cujiine,2,Sat Jul 11 15:09:01 2015 UTC,What is your water change schedule? What percentage how often? What water dechlorinator are you using?  What medicines did you try?
bettafish,3cx1ut,ErrantWhimsy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:26:54 2015 UTC,"Before the big change from split, to all the tank for him, I was changing the water roughly once a week and it was between 10-20% depending on what the water tested at as far as ammonia, nitrates, and nitrites. I was using prime and stress coat as well as leaf zone and AQ salt for a bit of fin rot that happened first.  I tried Epsom salt for the one with a tumor because at the onset, it just looked like he was constipated, but that was in a QT tank and the currently stressed/sick boy didn't get it. Same thing with API General Cure, Tetracycline, and just an increase in small water changes.  None of the meds were introduced into the shared tank other than any that was still on my VT when he was done in the QT tank."
bettafish,3cx1ut,Astilaroth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:37:05 2015 UTC,"Did your tanks ever test positive for ammonia or nitrite, since you mention them?  Could you have cross contaminated a possible illness by using things in both tanks, like the stuff you use for water changes?"
bettafish,3cx1ut,Astilaroth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:45:53 2015 UTC,"It hasn't tested positive for ammonia since I got it cycled about 8months ago or so. I was concerned about it because I did a massive water change in order to deep clean the gravel, and almost expected a cycle crash. I did keep my filter media in some of the old cycled tank water so I don't expect it to take as long to cycle again.  I don't think I cross contaminated mostly because I had a vac for the 10 gal and then had to scoop water out of the QT because it's only about two gallons. The water bucket I would use was rinsed with hot water several times between tanks, and I always do my 10gal before the QT. Plus, I don't know that either fish is really sick. The VT is mostly the same besides the large lump on one side and he's dropped from a total of 8-10 pellets a day to 6-8 split between two feedings. The DT is eating fine but goes back to laying on the ground.  My boyfriend offered up that he may just not know what to do with the more open space? When it was just him in ~5 gallons, it looked more densely planted. With the divider out, as well as some of the dead plants, its a bit more open. I do plan on picking up some more plants when Petco has their 30% off sale soon."
bettafish,3cy6aj,Thatguyispimp,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:06:25 2015 UTC,"it sounds like you did overfeed him, the 2 minute rule doesn't really work for betta fish. It does make them a little slow, the high temperature probably doesn't help either. Keep in mind that their stomach is approx. the size of one of their eyes. This site can help you see whether you are overfeeding. You can fast him until his belly is normal again (should take a day or two tops).  You are doing a fish in cycle though, which means constant testing and changing the water. I advise you to get a liquid test kit (like the [API master test kit](www.amazon.com/API-Freshwater-Master-Test-Kit/dp/B000255NCI)), if you don't have one already.  You want the ammonia and nitrite to be 0 ppm, nitrate should be below 20 ppm. Here is more information on cycling in general, and here is a guide for fishless cycling."

How long will the fish in cycling take and I will start work again in a few days working 12 hour days, will that be an issue?"
bettafish,3cy6aj,how_fedorable,2,Sat Jul 11 21:32:32 2015 UTC,"The cycling process usually takes 4-8 weeks (though it depends on a lot of factors, so don't be alarmed if you finished earlier, or later). As long as you have enought time to test the water and do waterchanges (daily or every other day, depending on the water parameters), your workhours shouldn't be an issue."
bettafish,3cy6aj,Shills_for_fun,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:42:41 2015 UTC,Ok great to hear thanks. For some personal advice how do you do water changes? I really don't have any large tubs or anything just cooking ware. I put in conditioner every time right? Do I also add bacteria supplement as well?
bettafish,3cy6aj,Shills_for_fun,2,Sat Jul 11 21:58:37 2015 UTC,"Get yourself a siphon for like $8 and have a couple buckets. You can get a bucket for like $2 at the grocery store, just do it. One bucket for dirty water, one for clean water. I usually use conditioner in the clean bucket and let it sit for a few minutes before I dump it in.  Big advice on water changes: consistent temperature. Make sure you're in the ballpark of the current tank water temperature (you can do it just by feeling the water), because big fluctuations can stress out the fish.  The bacteria supplement depends on what you're using. Follow the directions on the package. For Microbe-Lift, it's 15 mL the first week and 10mL/week for like 5 weeks, then 5mL every other week.  Speaking of reading packages, don't completely change out your filters per the directions. All of this work you're doing on the bacteria supplements will be all for naught if you do. Give it a google."
bettafish,3cyl02,nattylife,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:19:35 2015 UTC,"That certainly looks like fungus from here. You should put him in a quarantine tank and do a large water change on that one, to discourage it from spreading to your other fish.   I've never heard of Betta Revive, and if it doesn't mention fungus specifically, I'd avoid it in favor of a medicine made specifically to treat fungal infections. If you have a pet store close to you, they should have some meds there that should work. Avoid Melafix/Bettafix."

The guy at petsmart told me to use API bettafix, but I'm nervous to use that since I'm not sure what's in it other than ""herbal remedies"". He doesn't look bloated or lethargic to me, so it wouldn't be an early symptom of dropsy, right?   What would be my best option to treat the popeye?

Keep a close watch on him, and don't treat with salt for more than 10 days.  If it seems like the salt isn't doing the trick, then I would say try a broad spectrum antibiotic, either tetracycline or a combo of Maracyn I + Maracyn II (one treats for gram positive bacteria, the other gram negative).

Spoke with the managers a bunch of times and stated each time that I had taken pictures and would be going to the SPCA about it. Showing any kind of compassion is better than showing none at all. Besides, the SPCA act here has a vague interpretation of marine life so I was able to argue a case for them, they investigated a ful report as far as I can tell."

If you do get ghost shrimp, get a ton of live plants for them to hide in. Not plastic plants, live ones.

Make sure your tank is water tight (doesn't leak) and check that your heater keeps the water around 74-78 degrees.

bettafish,3cqhih,AllOfTimeAndSpace,3,Thu Jul 9 23:26:35 2015 UTC,"I went through a ridiculous bout of fin rot with my betta, so i feel your pain!  To answer some of your questions:  Yes, still use water conditioner with the salt - gotta remove that chloramine and heavy metals. It won't affect your salt treatment.   You can do an in-tank salt treatment, in his actual house. As long as he's the only living resident, it shouldn't be an issue. How big is the big tank? If its several gallons, like 5, you wouldn't necessarily need to do a 100% water/salt change every day, just say 50% with the corresponding amount of salt re-added. However, as clean water is a huge factor in clearing up fin rot, you may find it easier to do it in a smaller tank. Just make sure to dissolve the salt FIRST before adding it into his tank! Otherwise it can burn the fish. Also make sure it is AQ or sea salt - no iodine!   I left my silk plant in when I did salt treatments. I'm not sure if it mattered or not.   In the end, I actually had to turn to antibiotics to cure my case because it didn't respond to anything else I did. Be cautious before using drugs though, as they can cause resistant strains of bacteria.   Some questions for you: Is your tank cycled? Having an established cycle can help big time with many issues. If cycled, what are your water params? Good levels?  If it's not cycled, what is your water change schedule like? As I mentioned, clean water is one of the best things you can do for fin rot. Clean water and warm water. Do you have a heater? If so, turn it up a bit, to 80, 82 degrees. That may help too."
bettafish,3cqhih,sexytimespanda,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:54:35 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for responding!   My tank is 5.5 gallons.  It's about a week old (same exact tank as before but the last one broke when we moved houses) and has had a 50% change once.  It is filtered and heated to 79 degrees. I'm torn about moving him to his smaller tank because he seems to hate it, but it would definitely be easier to deal with until this clears up. And I have Aquarium Salt and it says its safe for fish.  I will definitely make sure to dissolve it first  though.  Thanks! :)   I'm glad to hear that I can leave his plant in.  He gets so depressed and listless when his tank has nothing in it (discovered that when we moved and he was in just a basic bowl with nothing to do until we got his tank set up).  I'd hate for him to be more stressed when I'm trying to get him better.   My tank is not cycled.  This is kind of a shameful moment for me lol, but when I read the tank set-up instructions and it said to cycle for 24 hours I just thought they meant to turn it on with the filter on for 24 hours.  It wasn't until I found this site that I realized cycling meant something different.  I'm still not entirely sure what it is or how to do it.    I don't have an at home kit yet to test water parameters.  I brought in a sample to PetSmart and the guy tested it and he said everything was fine.  I asked him about the ammonia levels and he said it was good, but he didn't tell me actual numbers.   As for water change schedule, typically he gets a 50% change once a week (Saturday), and every fourth Saturday he gets moved to his small tank and I do a full water change and clean of the plants and gravel and everything else that he has in his tank. This is a new tank so it was filled up, conditioned, and then he got put in a few hours later.  Since then it has had one 50% change."
bettafish,3cqhih,sexytimespanda,0,Fri Jul 10 00:28:46 2015 UTC,"Ok, 5.5 is a good size for a betta. However, a 50% change once per week, with a 100% thrown in, is probably why you ae having fin rot issues. That's not really enough changes since your tank is uncycled. Even a single betta can raise ammonia to unsafe levels pretty quickly. While pet stores can test water, a lot of them are under the impression that bettas are fine in some levels of ammonia, when in reality the goal is always 0 ammonia.  Once you get your fin rot fixed, and I would put him in the small tank to make it easier, up your water changes on the 5.5g and read into cycling. Since you already have the fish, you'll be doing a fish-in cycle. Not the preferred way, but doable. Absolutely buy a bottle of Seachem Prime water conditioner. It not only removes chlorine/chloramine, but it detoxifies ammonia for up to 48 hours. Great product. There's all kinds of info on here about cycling, or you can message me if you have anymore questions :)"

I've got 4 cardinal tetras right now, and it seems like 1 swims by himself every now and then and I chalk that up to having an even number (I plan to get another when I get home from vacation).

That does seem like a little too much food during the week to me (just my feeling), but if he fasted for a week and didn't improve that's probably not the issue.  At this point, because you've treated him with salt and API, I would say the best course of action at this point is to leave his tank be for now.  I know that's hard, but by doing so many large water changes/etc, the cycle has probably been interrupted and needs time to build up again.  That process by itself can be stressful.  If this were me and my little dude, I'd leave it alone and just keep a close eye on water parameters for now.  I'd try the boiled pea method, too, if I hadn't seen him poop or evidence of such lately.  I know it's really hard to not do anything, but treating him too much/often trying to figure out the issue might have the opposite effect that you're looking for. :/"

As of my water test last night, his cycle seems perfectly fine. The ammonia was 0ppm, the nitrites were 0ppm, nitrate were ~.5ppm and the PH was around 6.  He actually poops quite normally. The reason I feed him daphnia once a week is to help him with that. He had an issue a month or so ago where he was getting a little constipated and daphnia acts as a fishy laxative so I worked it into his diet to prevent that from happening again."

Most likely she will be fine, obviously over a long period of time it would be a problem but you're not letting that happen."
bettafish,3cg7xx,Mirarii,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:21:46 2015 UTC,"Did you by any chance clean your filter while doing tank maintenance?   It coukd also be that your tank was cycled,  but on very little ammonia so the bacteria culture was there, but small. With adding a fish, especially one that 'eats like a pig', you suddenly introduced way more ammonia so maybe the bacteria just couldn't keep up with that ... yet.  Do a very large water change, do not touch your filter and ease a bit on the feeding, little bits at a time and easily fast once or twice a week.  It'll be ok :)"
bettafish,3cg7xx,Astilaroth,2,Tue Jul 7 18:11:06 2015 UTC,"No, not really. I heard it was bad if you did that too often.   She wasn't added to the tank, she's been living there for about 2-3 months now and the filter has been established for longer (though living in a dorm and moving around can't be good for bacteria, but the cycle has been reestablished for a while now) They only thing that was added recently were plants. She gets 3 pellets once a day with fast days on Sundays.  Edit: Clarification: Filter was in a different tank and moved to this one once the other tank was upgraded to sponge filters"
bettafish,3cg7xx,Astilaroth,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:23:00 2015 UTC,Hm odd. Did the other tank have a similar bioload? Can it be that the filter got dry or that it was without waterflow for more than a couple of hours?
bettafish,3chlji,Ghostwoif123,2,Tue Jul 7 23:41:05 2015 UTC,"Filters usually are maxed at their listed capacity. I'd actually recommend purchasing a filter with higher capacity like a 50 gallon for your 29. I have Aquaclear 30s on both of my ten gallons and they handle it fantastically (very adjustable current, pretty Betta friendly, especially in a large tank). I'm sure he would be very happy in a 29 gallon. I don't know much about Plecos, but I bet a school of Cories would do great in a planted 29g."

bettafish,3chlji,Mister_Po,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:40:17 2015 UTC,"Common plecos get enormous. A 29 gallon tank is too small for the ""common"" breed.  There are smaller pleco breeds that are more appropriate, but you'll need driftwood in there to help the plecos digest. With driftwood often comes yellowing/tea-colored water from tannins, but you can clear that up with a good filter or by boiling the everloving shit out of the wood until it's a manageable amount.  If you decide on getting shrimp, try ghosts first. They're $0.30/ea and your betta will probably try to eat them when he finds them. With shrimp, you're going to want lots of real plants in the tank for hiding."

bettafish,3cdvtq,FreeThinkk,5,Tue Jul 7 03:42:50 2015 UTC,My fiancé' hair dresser had this poor little guy living in a skull vodka bottle for the last two years. We finally convicted her to give him to us. He's suffering some sever fin rot.   Any advice would help.   We've got him in a small 1g hospital bowl at the moment. Dosed him with a little bit of salt. Getting my spare 5 gal up and running for long term care. We've got some leftover melafix from our old beta. I'm thinking that might shock his system in the condition he's in.   I've seen the posts. I know you guys can work wonders. Help me save this little dude.
bettafish,3cdvtq,how_fedorable,5,Tue Jul 7 03:48:57 2015 UTC,"Don't add the melafix, it's harder to dose in a 1g and bettas (and other labyrinth fish) are more sensitive to one of the active ingredients. Get the 5g up asap and keep his water super clean, he'll probably recover on his own. stresscoat can also help his fins regrow."
bettafish,3cdvtq,le_nguyen349,3,Tue Jul 7 04:21:56 2015 UTC,Do you have a heater in your 1g? I would assume no since its so small. If that's so then i would imagine the heated 5 gallon is better. High and constant temperature can do wonder. And no dont add melafix. It seriously messed with my betta's swimming bladder and he died. Dosing with salt is better

bettafish,3cbbcd,maxkats,5,Mon Jul 6 16:01:42 2015 UTC,"I strongly recommend against a sorority. I say this every time someone asks about a 10g sorority, but they are still bettas, 'fighting fish' and therefor deserve their own space. The smallest I would do for a sorority is a 20g long.   Also for a sorority remember tons of plants, odd numbers, and no less than 5 to make it as happy as possible. :)"
bettafish,3cbbcd,blazingbeauty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:30:53 2015 UTC,Agreed. I have a sorority with 7 girls in a 20L and even now after 3 months they still nip at each other every once an a while
bettafish,3cbbcd,Gfunk98,2,Tue Jul 7 06:41:40 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest moving your female betta fish to the bigger tank as they tend to be less hostile, increasing your chances of whatever fish you decide to accompany her getting along.   10g is the minimum size requirement for a 5 female betta community but remember, you'll want it to be heavily planted and as its the minimum, there's no guarantee your community will live together peacefully but you do have that 3g tank if one of them is too hostile. You also have the option to have 1 betta plus a group of smaller fish in the tank."
bettafish,3cbbcd,Crompee01,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:41:46 2015 UTC,"Would a 3 female betta sorority be okay? And if one of them is hostile, are you suggesting putting it in the .5g tank or with the male betta? I'm sure you mean the former, I wouldn't put anybody with the big guy."
bettafish,3cbbcd,Crompee01,2,Mon Jul 6 17:40:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about 3 females. You need an odd number and I remember reading 5 females is the minimum to spread out any aggression between them.   I meant, if one shows too much aggression, you can stick that one in the old tank your using for your female betta now. Males should never be in a tank with any other bettas. Sorority's are a tricky thing and may not always work out, you could just do a 10gal tank with 1 betta them a group of small  schooling fish."
bettafish,3cbbcd,ZeldaMusic113,2,Mon Jul 6 17:46:43 2015 UTC,"Usually the minimum people suggest for a sorority is 5. There's less chance of aggression that way. You'd need at least a 20g for that though. Depending on your female's temperament you could get her a few tank mates like snails, shrimp (she may try to eat them), coryadoras, or neon tetras. You could do some further research into what would fit in a 10g. Good luck! :)"
bettafish,3cbbcd,seirianstar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:09:42 2015 UTC,"You could get a small school of peaceful community fish to live with the female in the 10 gallon. Something like tetras might be nice. Whatever fish you get, if you go this route, make sure they aren't fin nippers so your betta is ok. Also, make sure the fish don't have fancy fins(like guppies) or else the betta will nip their fins."
bettafish,3cbbcd,alphie33,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:23:47 2015 UTC,"Move your female up to the 10g for sure. Start cycling it now; grab yourself a sponge filter (really easy to make) and heater for it asap :) That .5g is teeny tiny and she'd appreciate the bigger tank. Read up on the fish in cycle, and I wouldn't add any more fish right away. Get it cycled with her in it first, and perhaps then think about it. I wouldn't do a sorority in a 10g tank because (imo) it seems too small. I know some people do it, but I'd be constantly worried about something going wrong. Also, your female is used to being by herself and adding in some more random girls would probably piss her off and there's just a bigger chance of aggression.   If you really want another fish, you can always get a divider and another female to put on the other side. Just make sure you put the female in the divided side right away (as opposed to dividing it later) so she understands that these are her quarters and territory to patrol. As tempting as it is, don't put a male on the other side. They can ""smell"" each other and will try to get at each other to breed. Keep same sexes in divided tanks.  You can try to add a school of peaceful, nonflashy fish, but only after the tank has cycled, but keep in mind a back up plan in case it doesn't work out (and it shouldn't be putting that girl back in her tiny first home. Not fair to spoil her then take it all away). Less chance of fishy causalities due to bad gunk in the water once it's fully cycled.  Regardless, 10g will need lots of silk, leafy plants and hidey holes so who ever goes in doesn't get stressed out by the big amount of space. Old coffee mugs and terracotta pots (with the holes plugged) make for good, cheap solutions as opposed to expensive caves from LPS/LFS."
bettafish,3ccx3d,ChokolateThundah,2,Mon Jul 6 22:55:30 2015 UTC,Hydor's 25watt heater would probably be a better choice. It has a dial to adjust the temperature and can sense the water temp and regulate it. I just recently bought it and I'm in love. It's the best little heater I've ever had.

bettafish,3ccx3d,le_nguyen349,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:55:27 2015 UTC,"You should read up on tank cycle. Basically a tank need to have an established beneficial bacteria colony, that can break down fish waste and old rotten food. New tanks do not have enough of these yet until 3-4 weeks in, so ammonia will build up a lot and could kill the fish. I highly recommend you purchasing an API Master Test Kit on Amazon ($25) to test for the water parameters, testing everyday and change water accordingly. It's pretty much a one-time purchase so it's definitely worth it. In the mean time, you should change water, at least 50% EVERY other day."

A better quality heater will probably be better, but as long as you don't let the ambient temperature in the room get too low you will be okay with something. Also keep on top of water quality early on. It will take a while for the water to fully cycle and become safe for the fish."

As I was acclimating the snail he was acting very aggressively towards it and would not stop. I had to rehome the little snail.

bettafish,3c6f1m,pelzasaurusrex,6,Sun Jul 5 07:21:50 2015 UTC,"So no water change for two weeks and a huge amount of food?  Do a very large water change right away, like 80% and keep a very close eye on the water parameters the next couple of days.   He can go without food fine for a couple of days but he's probably suffering from some nasty water conditions, hope he makes it.  All those holiday-foods and automatic feeding systems are disastrous for aquaria, so many bad stories about it from  so many people. Get someone to feed him a few times a week next time."
bettafish,3c40qm,diarrhea_pocket,4,Sat Jul 4 15:44:41 2015 UTC,He's beautiful and seems to be loving his gorgeous new home! Can I ask what that lovely floating plant is that seems so happy?  I've been trying to figure out one for my betta's 5g as I know he would love it.  Water wisteria doesn't want to grow enough and won't stay in one spot.  The filter blows the little plants all over the tank even though it's not much of a current.
bettafish,3c40qm,cookiedoughcreations,2,Sat Jul 4 17:48:31 2015 UTC,"It's hornwort! I actually got a really good start of it from another tank, and it's gone crazy in there. It's so fun to watch him in a more natural habitat, nipping at plants (and snails) and laying on leaves. It's an aqueon 3 gallon tank with a whisper filter, which is a super gentle current. Thanks for the compliments!"

Then when you go to put him back into the tank, you can just dunk the glass down and ""pour"" him out.  I'm assuming that getting jostled around when the water is poured back into the tank freaks him out a little, so perhaps pouring it onto a plant, rock, or fixture that he isn't near to break the fall of the water would help? Maybe pour the water back into the tank a glass at a time, slowly?"
bettafish,3c5lab,Azusanga,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:10:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  I used to put him in his travel cup when I did water changes, but he'd get way more stressed out sitting in his cup while I did the change so I just started leaving him in there. I got that advice from this sub. I pour the new water in very slowly as to not jostle him, but the little dork always manages to swim into it!"
bettafish,3c5lab,Azusanga,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:20:07 2015 UTC,Lil noodle. Maybe he's playing in it! You said he attacks the gravel vacuum? Maybe that's the thing thats wigging him out.

bettafish,3c3irt,ZeldaMusic113,8,Sat Jul 4 12:46:00 2015 UTC,"There's no way. The fish would produce more waste than the pants could filter through. Get a sponge filter. They're super easy to set up and maintain. Plus they're very betta safe. First you find the right sponge filter for your tank, then you'll need an air pump and air tubing. I recommend the tetra whisper air pumps. Then one you've got it all set up, adjust the air flow so there's not too much water movement. Bettas dislike a strong current as they find it difficult to swim.   If you go through with a proper setup, be sure to keep us updated or feel free to ask questions. Good luck! :)"

bettafish,3c3irt,cookiedoughcreations,3,Sat Jul 4 13:53:06 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but it;s more work than having a filter. You can basically turn the entire tank into a filter. you need a LOT of plants to create surface area for the bacteria. You also need water movement from an air stone. see this guys video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9vkHe84xKk  so you need a air pump and a good light. You're better off just using an air pump with a sponge or box filter. I prefer box filters.  If you're interested in self regulating tanks. I have a tank that creates food for the betta. It also has enough plants to not need a filter, but I still use one. https://www.reddit.com/r/bettafish/comments/3bwqui/ricardo_hunting_for_live_food_in_his_ten_gallon/  Edit: The reason it's more work is you're going to need to buy and use several test kits to make sure it's actually cycling"
bettafish,3c3irt,Mirarii,3,Sat Jul 4 15:30:08 2015 UTC,"To piggyback this: box filters are incredibly easy to make.

bettafish,3c1ohv,LilacsInOctober,2,Fri Jul 3 23:04:49 2015 UTC,"You can cycle the tank with him in there, you'll just have to be very proactive about checking your water. I cycled my tank with my fish in there. Basically your fish is the source of ammonia for the good bacteria to start forming. You'll need to be diligent about water changes. Don't let the ammonia go above .25ppm. If it's at .25, do a 25% water change. If it's a .5, do a 50% change. It'll take a little longer than cycling a tank without a fish, but it's doable! Mine took about 6 weeks to fully cycle."
bettafish,3c1ohv,ZeldaMusic113,2,Fri Jul 3 23:47:18 2015 UTC,"Bettas are hardy, just keep a close eye on your chemistry levels and maybe look into a bacteria supplement such as API's Stress Zyme or Tetra's Aquasafe. Bacteria can naturally occur but it usually takes 4-6 weeks for an adequate colony to procreate, so a bacteria supplement can speed that along. Your tank water might get cloudy for a few days after you introduce bacteria, but don't worry, this is very likely a bacteria bloom (very common in new tanks) and will go away in a few days. It took about a week for the cloudiness to dissipate in my 5.5gal.    You're not going to avoid a cycle per se unless you crash the cycle somehow, usually changing more than 60% of the water in an established tank(which yours is not yet, so don't do more than 20% at a time for now unless your ammonia is ridiculously high) or removing the biomedia (including if the biomedia becomes dry, the bacteria cannot survive unless submerged) If you need to clean the biomedia, take a cup of tank water (not tap, chlorine can kill off this bacteria) and swish it around until it's free of debris.   Don't fret as long as your betta is eating and acting healthy. Keep up with weekly 10-15% water changes, and increase to twice a week if ammonia levels become too high. Most local fish shops (LFS) will test your water for free. If you decide to get a bacteria supplement, you can supplement the bacteria every time you do a water change."
bettafish,3c1ohv,Howlibu,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:51:34 2015 UTC,"Look up fish in cycles. Most tanks, assuming you aren't doing constant 100% water changes, will cycle on their own with fish in them. Just make sure you test your water frequently and keep up with water changes."
bettafish,3c1ohv,Mister_Po,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:09:11 2015 UTC,"I'm doing the same thing right now. I highly suggest getting some Seachem Prime. You'll still have to do regular water changes, but Prime makes it easier as it detoxifies ammonia. I was doing like two water changes a day until I had had enough. Prime allows me to go two days at a time, with ammonia (detoxed) still present in the tank for the bacteria to eat."
bettafish,3c1l9i,Zmens,2,Fri Jul 3 22:36:35 2015 UTC,"It'll take you a while to find your betta's eating habits, but you'll get there. just watch for signs of overfeeding (bloated stomach, constipation) or under feeding (skinny, sad fish). I feed my betta twice a day, 3 in the morning and 2 in the evening. I also feed frozen bloodworms and daphnia. This seems to be a good balance for him.   Try presoaking the pellets in some tank water before feeding, allowing the food to swell with water outside the fish, rather than inside it (potentially causing constipation or whatnot). And you can see that pellets get much bigger so you'll be able to judge better on how many to feed :)"
bettafish,3c1l9i,sexytimespanda,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:46:39 2015 UTC,Something I would add would be the amount give to the fish depends on the size of the pellet. Some brands of pellets are larger than others.

bettafish,3bwqui,Astilaroth,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:46:50 2015 UTC,"I will. the funny thing is most of the food stays at the bottom of the tank, hiding in the substrate. So Ricardo has to bottom feed. He also picks copepods off the walls. He hunts a little too much so I installed a mirror to distract him."
bettafish,3bwqui,boberticus,4,Fri Jul 3 14:39:37 2015 UTC,"Too small a footprint of available space for a group of corys, even dwarf/pygmy. Make the refugium smaller."
bettafish,3bwqui,PriceZombie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:52:38 2015 UTC,"I like cories because they are bottom feeders with small mouths. they won't be able to eat the large scuds so there will always be food for the betta. Ideally I would have a 20 gallon long with the same sized refugium. My other option is other betta friendly tank mates like minnows, small tetras, rasboas, etc. Right now I am letting him over eat then isolating him until he poops and release him again. I'm hoping he brings down the food population and the stasis can support him. changes take a long time to take effect. I'm scared to move the wall because a lot of the food animals will find their way over to the other side in the process."
bettafish,3bwqui,littlemissdisaster,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:58:04 2015 UTC,Ideally I would have a 20 gallon long with the same sized refugium.   That sounds awesome and would be a proper home for other tankmates as well... I'd love to see how that works out and what it looks like!

One fish over eating the same amount of food many fish would eat produces the same amount of ammonia. When I first asked for advice about this tank many internet people explained to me why it wouldn't work based on the rules they knew. As it turns out it worked. It's important to understand where the rules come from in the first place. Do the fish need more space to feel safe or do they need more water to hold their waste?"

Including gravel and any decorations he will probably end up with only 1 gallon. Not much better that what he's in now. A ten gallon is only $10 at petco now.   Don't forget a thermometer. And monitor the temp very closely as in such a small tank the water can change rapidly.   Look for a test kit, and read up on the nitrogen cycle. And don't forget a filter."
bettafish,3bxbsl,sterlingthecatdoesit,4,Fri Jul 3 01:59:40 2015 UTC,"The tank is $10. The hood is $20-30, the filter is ~$15-20, and the heater can be anywhere from $10 to $30. A 10g kit is only $40 though.  I highly recommend 10g tanks but it's not as cheap as you're kind of implying here."
bettafish,3bxbsl,Shills_for_fun,2,Fri Jul 3 05:22:00 2015 UTC,"You are right. There are always more and more costs to think about. Decorations, gravel, test kit, meds, plants. An aquarium is really like a sinkhole. And the sale is only like $4 off the tank. But a glass lid, $10 heater from amazon and a sponge filter is about the same as the kit.   It may sound mean, but an empty ten gallon tank for a month is still better than a half gallon for his life, or being flushed. Save up, search around for cheap equipment, and u/slimstebow can figure it out as they go."
bettafish,3bxbsl,sterlingthecatdoesit,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:24:34 2015 UTC,I would hit up craigslist first.. Sometimes you can find entire 10G set ups for like $20
bettafish,3bxbsl,AGervenson,3,Fri Jul 3 20:46:24 2015 UTC,I'd highly recommend getting a different tank. The bare minimum for bettas is 2.5g while 5g is more highly recommended. There's a dollar per gallon sale going on at Petco right now so you could get yourself a nice 10g! :)
bettafish,3bxbsl,ZeldaMusic113,2,Fri Jul 3 01:16:00 2015 UTC,I'm realizing now that I should have asked yall before purchasing a tank. It had a good rating and said it was suitable for bettas and came with the filter so I just went with it. I'll upgrade as soon as possible.
bettafish,3bxbsl,ZeldaMusic113,2,Fri Jul 3 03:29:46 2015 UTC,"Good! And many people don't realize how to properly house bettas, so they buy things like that. If you want a nice 5g, I have this aquarium for my boy. It's a great tank that comes with a filter, but I'd recommend replacing it with a sponge filter. You'll also need nice talk silk or real plants too as the aquarium is rather tall for a 5g."
bettafish,3bxbsl,ZeldaMusic113,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:45:10 2015 UTC,"I will consider it my top choice moving forward. This whole thing just sprung up all the sudden and my immediate reaction was ""man I need to get a tank for this poor guy"" and I just went on Amazon and ordered the first one that came up. Basically this lady rented out space at my work for a reception and she used these vases with Betta in them as center pieces on the tables but then after the event she just wanted to flush them all down the toilets. My boss stepped in and said ""Oh Hell No!"" And took them all home and began finding homes for them and he asked me to take at least one... So I did!"
bettafish,3bxbsl,Shills_for_fun,2,Fri Jul 3 05:08:08 2015 UTC,"That's horrible! :( Once you've been subbed to /r/bettafish for awhile, you'll notice quite a few posts that pop up about people in your same exact situation. They're either at a wedding or something of that sort and bettas are being used as decorations. The kind OP rescues them to give them a better home and posts here for advice.   I honestly hate this trend of using bettas for decoration. Yes, they're beautiful fish, but they're living creatures too. They all deserve a chance at the best life possible. This is why  promised myself I will always rescue my bettas. Maybe one day I'll buy myself a fancy one from Thailand, but as long as bettas keep being advertised as decorations or fish that are supposed to live in 1g bowls I will always rescue them."
bettafish,3bxbsl,Mister_Po,2,Fri Jul 3 15:05:13 2015 UTC,"The real reason people recommend you get a 5g is it is easier to maintain than a 2.5g. With the tank you ordered, you're going to be doing water changes multiple times/week, and 50-100% changes at that. With a cycled 5g? 20%. Once a week.  You're going to find that having a pet is one thing, but an aquarium turns into a hobby. I had a 5.5g for my betta but I discovered that I couldn't do much in terms of live plants (my betta gets really pissed when I remove his little Cambodian temple thing).  So I upgraded to a 10g. You might be thinking ""10 gallons for one damn fish?""  However, if you get lots of live plants, you can also add a tankmate or two like ghost shrimp (which are basically doomed in a 5.5g).  Anyway, if you upgrade, don't upgrade to 5g. Upgrade to 10g."
bettafish,3bxbsl,JellybettaFish,2,Fri Jul 3 05:15:41 2015 UTC,"Do you have the container that he was probably sold in from the store or anything similar? Very well rinsed (no soap) tupperware might also work in a pinch. When you get the new tank filled with treated tap water that is roughly the same temperature of the water he is currently in, transfer him and a few cups of his old water into a floatable container (betta cup, tupperware, thin plastic container, anything well rinsed and untouched by soap) and float that in the new tank for at least 15-20 minutes (more is better).   After 20 or so minutes he should be acclimated to the temperature of the water and can be transferred from his floating container to the new tank; ideally by netting him and releasing him without transferring any old water, but if you have no other options just pour the whole cup in.  As for his current conditions, I can't really help. If he is in good health he should be fine for a few more days. If he's been in the vase for more than a few days I would supplement some of the water with distilled water from the store.   Definitely less than an ideal situation and it might call for less than ideal solutions. If worst comes to worst just make sure your new tank has treated water that is as close to the same temperature as his old water and get him in it however you need to. The heater should slowly bring the water up to a healthier temperature and the filter will start doing it's job. Best of luck and drop back in for an update if you can.  ninja edit: 1.5 gallons will be fine if that is what you have ordered. The most important thing is that you get your new fish into a heated and filtered environment. Tank upgrades can come later."
bettafish,3bxbsl,MrsTokHaar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:57:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I will definitely give an update as long as I'm able to get him happily transferred and I'll look into getting a bigger tank. I should have asked before buying.
bettafish,3bxbsl,JellybettaFish,2,Fri Jul 3 03:31:25 2015 UTC,"You need to put the water conditioners in 15+ minutes before the fish. That's how long they take to neutralize the chlorine and other harmful things that might be in the tap water.   What you'll want to do when your tank finally comes is set it up with water and water conditioner, and wait until the tank is the same temperature as the room before transferring him into the aquarium. Then, turn the heater on and slowly raise the temperature as carefully as you can with the heater you bought. That way, he doesn't go through a sudden rise in temperature and get sick."

bettafish,3bwppy,cheese_on_rye,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:50:06 2015 UTC,"Driftwood decor works because of the tannins, which will turn your water yellowish. It's not bad for the fish but some people find the clear water more desirable.  Unless you boil your driftwood, in which case I have no idea how it affects PH  (tannins are released but in small numbers)."
bettafish,3bwppy,Turdsworth,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:26:13 2015 UTC,From what I understand Bettas actually prefer tannins and placing oak leaves and Indian Almond leaves in tanks can also add them.
bettafish,3bv23t,amburrdawn,6,Thu Jul 2 11:35:50 2015 UTC,Your fish is still being poisoned quite badly. Water changes and a binding agent like Prime for the ammonia will help. You need to get it as close to 0 PPM ammonia.

If only you knew how many fish I list when I first started fish keeping. Its a really hard, demanding, expensive, and at times frustrating hobby. But having gorgeous happy and healthy fish is totally worth it.  Consider a hospital tank. You can buy a small 2 gallon, heater, filter, and bubble stone cheap at petco or PETsMART or even WalMart. I have 3 for my bettas. You can quarantine him in there so hey can relax by himself without extra ammonia from the pleco (I think they actually grow to need a lot larger than 10g tanks).  Use some aquarium salt to help with the healing. As for the bloated belly, its possible you overfed? I usually go a day or two a week when I don't feed mine, they can actually go much longer than that without eating!  Good luck. A tiny hospital tank is a godsend and if you keep fish it can help save lives.   PS- if you do get a hospital tank make sure to put him in a cup and drip acclimate him! If you just throw him in there he could die of shock"
bettafish,3bvxvy,alphie33,7,Thu Jul 2 16:20:58 2015 UTC,"I used to be very stressed out about my fish when I first started owning bettas. I just had to remind myself to calm down and take each day as they come. Yes, sometimes horrible things happen. For example, right now I'm fighting dropsy with my boy. I know there's a very slim chance he'll make it, but I'm keeping myself positive for his sake.   I guess what I'm trying to say is don't worry about the future. Focus on the present and the good times you have with your fish now. Yes, one day something bad might happen to him, but you'll at least know that you gave him the best life you could.   Edit: spelling"

The other dreams usually involve taking care of tanks that are hundreds of gallons large, usually spanning a whole wall or even an entire room.

bettafish,3bvxvy,RealPatriot1776,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:53:15 2015 UTC,"Adding on to this, fish are much more resilient than we imagine. I'm not saying you can keep a goldfish in a 10 gallon, but don't go crazy if you miss a day of feeding either. With a large volume of water and adequate filtration, I've never run into a problem that I can't easily fix with some extra aquarium salt or a few days of increased water changes. The more water you have in your tank, the more of a buffer you have incase your fish does get sick or something does go wrong."

One thing you should keep in mind, and a lot of people seem to forget this fact, but Bettas are tough fish. The fact that they can survive in those horrible conditions advocated by betta bowl manufacturers is testament to that.   That said, they're not genetically perfect. Some will die and you can only try to care for them when it happens. Give them a good life as long as you can, the best you can, and I guarantee you will have provided a much better life than half of the people buying bettas for stupid shit like wedding decorations or as an ornament in a vase ""ecosystem.""

bettafish,3bvukq,Astilaroth,3,Thu Jul 2 17:09:28 2015 UTC,"Okay here we go. You seem to know a bit about cycling already even though you say you don't... but I'll break it down for you just in case.  Waste (poop, uneaten food, rotting plant bits) is basically ammonia. Which is harmful for fish. Luckily for us (yeay!) there are bacteria that live on ammonia and make it into nitrite. Nitrite is also potentially lethal, but hey there are other bacteria that live on nitrite and turn it into nitrate. Nitrate is far less harmful but it is an 'end' product. The only way to get rid of nitrate is by either having a lot of plants that soak this up (floating plants usually do a great job) and the water changes we do ourselves.  This process is called the nitrogen cycle. The bacteria need a place to live. They do not live in the water itself... the water is their food source. The live partially in the substrate, but mostly in the filtermaterial. This is why filtermaterial has a lot of surface (sponges with tons of holes or little ceramic tube things for instance), it provides a nice comfy home. If you have a well established tank and you look at the filter, you'll see it's all gunky. That's the good stuff right there.  This also means that you should never ever clean your filter to be spick and span, because that basically kills/removes the bacteria and resets your cycle. It also means that if the water flow is off for long (a power outage for example), they won't have their steady flow of tank water (aka food) and might die as well. If the filter has been off for a long time (3+ hours is when I start to get nervous) you need to really keep an eye on things.  So for now... get a filter, any filter. Put it in, turn it on, leave it alone. If you're very lucky, you have a friend with an established tank and you can use his filter material to 'seed' yours. Basically squish them together so there is gunk on yours, then keep it wet until you're home and put it in asap.  You can leave the food in. As long as it's rotting it's probably producing ammonia, which you want.   Nifty picture of the nitrogen cycle in an aquarium.  It can take up to three weeks before a new tank is fully cycled. As soon as you start measuring nitrate but no more ammonia or nitrite, you can assume it is cycled properly. Do not trust pet stores that test your water and say it is 'good', because if it is plain tap water they will most likely say the same thing (because a fish will survive in it), but it is not the same as your whole tank being well cycled.   If you have any questions feel free to ask!!"

You're a great pet owner and I applaud your efforts.  I hope you won't give up on having pets in the future.  You surely have the love to give.  Take care & I hope you find some peace."

I was told by numerous people that I should have euthanized him and the female, but I refused to give up on them. I really did try everything possible. :/ I'm just upset that I couldn't do more. And what kills me is knowing they suffered for so long, even though I made my best attempt to heal them. I just hope they both weren't in pain during their last moments. It would make it that much harder.  What's worse is today, I woke up and by habit, I always go to turn on his light to say hi to him. Only to remember that he was gone... :( So I just have the tanks light off completely. I don't know if I'll fill it again any time soon. It's honestly just too hard to even think about ""replacing"" him. :/"

I broke down in front of my girlfriend when I walked into my flat to see him laying lifeless on the bottom of his tank. I can relate to the horrible guilt and depression that soon followed. Just thinking about him makes me tear up still. He was such a calm and beautiful boy, and I will always love him. However, I will love other fish and want to give them a better shot at a long and happy life so I continue this hobby.

I even taught little Drogo to do tricks, like jump up in the air, go through a hood, swim in my hand... he was just such a neat fish. Up until his decline, he would always wait my students while they played (his tank was in the room I teach violin) and he'd literally just sit there until they left. It's as if he was fascinated by them. And then some of the kids would sit down and watch him, and he'd just do his happy wiggle dance and chase their fingers. It was too cute. :/   I think what just upsets me the most is knowing how much time and money I spent just into his tank for him. When I saw him online, I knew I had to have him. I spent probably close to $150-200 or more to set up a natural, planted, beautiful 8 gallon tank for him. It was like Christmas morning for me when he arrived at my doorstep. I haven't been that excited in a while, since he was my first betta ever. He was gorgeous. I just wish I knew what I could have done differently with him so he (and Dany) would've lived a full life. ;("

I'd hate to tear down a tank that I put so much work into, but I'm just so afraid of going through this again. If I come across a betta that I just can't say no to, then maybe I'll adopt one. That helped a lot when I lost my female a month ago. Her tank is right beside my bed, so it was just so depressing to not have a little buddy to greet me in the morning. I found a beautiful halfmoon betta and Petco that was just gorgeous, and it just felt like he was the one. His name is Lewis, and he's a sweetheart. :) I think I'll need more time with this one, since Drogo was my first betta, but I think you're right. Maybe taking another little guy in will help."

Also see if you can come up with some water test results (if you don't have a kit your local store will do it for you... just take them a water sample; make sure you get numbers from them though rather than just good/bad); ideally temperature, ammonia/nitrite/nitrate and possibly pH and hardness."
bettafish,3brbyw,Astilaroth,3,Wed Jul 1 17:15:58 2015 UTC,"After the awesome bubble nest we thought we were doing so well.  His water numbers were great after having  nitrate, ammonia and brown algae issues after we first got him until the tank settled down.  I bought what I thought was a cool feeder thing so his flakes wouldn't  blow around the tank at feeding time but after a couple days noticed the stagnant food was going moldy in the ring.  Fishy was hanging around the bottom of the tank really lethargic.  No coming over to see us when we walked in the room.  Numbers still good on the dip strips.  Did a 100% water change for the first time and cleaned everything this morning.  Hope that was the right decision.  http://www.amazon.com/Nutrafin-Max-Feeding-Ring-Suction/dp/B0002DI0TI#"
bettafish,3brbyw,Cranky_Hippy,6,Wed Jul 1 15:07:44 2015 UTC,"If your tank is not cycled you can expect ammonia and nitrite surges for weeks, adding feeding issues to that will make it even worse. Make sure you do large water changes every other day (50% at least). Don't do 100% unless absolutely necessary, since that will add stress for the fish.  If you read clear values on a test strip that doesn't mean your tank is cycled, you'll measure it in a fresh glass of water just the same. Please read up on cycling, in your case life/live cycling and the nitrogen cycle.  Also, most automated feeding system are notorious for causing trouble one way or the other, often leading to the death of fish. Just feed by hand, small amounts and fast him once or twice a week."
bettafish,3brbyw,AddictivePotential,3,Wed Jul 1 17:50:30 2015 UTC,"He looks bloated to me. Has he been making enough poop? (Crude question, I know, I am sorry.)  My best guess would be he is constipated."
bettafish,3brbyw,PriceZombie,3,Wed Jul 1 22:51:29 2015 UTC,I think you may be right.  I never really noticed the poop situation but after reading some other posts I've been overfeeding and not fasting him at all.  Here's how he looks tonight...a little fiestier and not sitting at the bottom.  I'm going to fast him for a couple days and then try the pea thing if that sounds right to you all.  http://imgur.com/poLu1Gw
bettafish,3brbyw,Scalare,3,Thu Jul 2 00:33:48 2015 UTC,"Pea method isn't a great idea, lots of differing opinions on that.  I'm also betting the temp isn't warm enough. Water temp is always lower than the ambient temp. Should be 78. You'll have to get a heater eventually anyways.  Betta fish stomachs are right below their gills and none of the pics you have show that area, so not sure if he's constipated. Feed good quality betta pellets, not flakes. Flakes = potato chips. Can't just toss a bunch in. Have to feed 3-4 pellets 2x a day and make sure he eats them. Then when you vacuum the gravel and find little brown things, you'll know it's poop.  Beginner guide is a sticky at the top of the subreddit submissions, and the blue nav at the top of the subreddit has additional links.   Pic does show holes in his fins though, and that is due to poor water quality. You read up on cycling?  Don't clean everything unless you mean vacuuming up poop from the gravel. Wiping things down and especially washing/changing your filter foam is gonna kill all the beneficial bacteria that help change the bad chemicals from poop (ammonia, nitrite) into less bad chemicals (nitrate). Very important.  Good on you with the set-up and care so far, nice tank and you've obviously taken time to read on the importance of water quality, etc. Don't listen to pet store employees, keep up on water changes, any problems you can ask us. Hope everything works out for Police Robot."

bettafish,3brbyw,airplaneq,3,Wed Jul 1 18:45:23 2015 UTC,Hmmm... don't see anything too out of place there. Ammonia posioning can cause problems later on though; so it might be related to that. Although: what is 'normal ranges' in terms of your water parameters? Usually I ask for numbers rather than the interpretation. You didn't make any mention of temperature in there either. Heating is probably not an issue at the moment (although... do you have a heater? A lot of kits don't come with one; occasionally people will be told that one isn't necassary); but it might be too hot (depending on where you live... I've got a bit of a heat wave going on where I am).
bettafish,3bsy9a,MediumSizedDipper,2,Wed Jul 1 22:01:40 2015 UTC,"From the picture, it looks like bad fin clamping maybe. Do you know your water params exactly? Having numbers may help in figuring out what's wrong."
bettafish,3bsy9a,sexytimespanda,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:22:11 2015 UTC,"ok so I've been testing regularly(0 across the board ammonia nitrites and nitrates), but I tested pH on a whim just now and it was REALLY REALLY HIGH. I didn't even think to test for that, I just thought it'd stay within regular range for some reason... That is strange. Maybe that ornament I had in there made the pH spike somehow?"
bettafish,3bsy9a,AddictivePotential,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:53:38 2015 UTC,"It's not bad clamping. Clamping is simply the fish keeping it's fins tucked in because it's not feeling well. Like humans when we are sick and cross our arms, hunch over, and shuffle across the kitchen to get more tissues. Twisted fins is something more serious. Look for it on the bettafish.com forums, diseases/emergencies section. It's definitely bad. I want to say some kinda parasites but I'm not sure. What is your pH? Do you mean this is the 1st time you've tested? Or you've tested it before and now it's much higher? Softer water does that. Do research on it."
bettafish,3bt7yd,KingAcorn85,3,Wed Jul 1 23:17:38 2015 UTC,"The ammonia is way to high in your tank. .25ppm is very stressful for fish, but .5ppm for an extended period of time can kill your fish. With a 5.5g tank, you should be doing water changed 25% at least every 5 days. Not twice a month. Was/is your tank fully cycled? Even with the cycle, you still need to clean the waste and uneaten food from the gravel in your tank, or that can cause large ammonia spikes and a whole bunch more problems besides ammonia poisoning.  I suggest you do a 75% water change now, and clean it as best you can. Then check the ammonia level about a half hour after to see if it has gone down. If it's not quite zero, do maybe a 25% change the next day or the day after. Hopefully this helps, and your fish will start to perk up and feel better. Dosing him with a bit of aquarium salt should help him too. Good luck!"

Wingless fruit flies are also easy. As far as feeding too much, no food is good enough by itself, so you always need to rotate."
bettafish,3bqwe7,duggreen,3,Wed Jul 1 14:42:18 2015 UTC,"When I was breeding bettas one of the foods I gave them was brine shrimp.  They are super healthy but you want to suppliment with flakes or pellets.  It's hard to overfeed with live food because a lot of the mass is water. As long as there aren't any leftovers, it's cool.  Be careful about introducing excess salt to the tank.  I scoop up the shrimp in a net, rinse in fresh water, then dump in betta tank.    The main problem with brine shrimp is they take a long time to get big enough for the betta to be interested.  If you're having fun raising them, then totally do it.   You should also look into Daphnia.  They're super easy.  I take dirty water from waterchanges and stick it in the sun then introduce daphnia.  The daphnia eat the algae that feeds on fish poop.  Because they live in fresh water, uneaten daphnia in the tank aren't going to rot and cause a problem."
bettafish,3bqwe7,BaylisAscaris,3,Wed Jul 1 17:23:44 2015 UTC,I too used to hatch my own brine shrimp while breeding.  I used a little eye dropper to suck the brine shrimp up and then put them in the tank near the betta to eat.  It always worked out really well.

bettafish,3bpcho,nudayz,2,Wed Jul 1 02:49:54 2015 UTC,"if he actually is constipated he wont be pooping. has he been pooping? if not, fast him for 1-2 days and if he hasnt shown improvement, try offering him the inside of a thawed pea, a piece about the size of his eye. since he is with other fish that need to eat, you could quarantine him or fast your tetras and frogs with him. also in the future, try doing a %25 water change every week rather than every 2 weeks. this will make the water quality alot better and will help him recover from whatever is troubling him. hope this helps :)"

bettafish,3bon83,le_nguyen349,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:10:39 2015 UTC,I'm new to having a tank and haven't looked into or know where to start with getting into the water parameters.
bettafish,3bon83,le_nguyen349,3,Tue Jun 30 22:16:17 2015 UTC,"Then I'm assuming you're not familiar with tank cycling, yes? It is important to establish an adequate beneficial bacteria colony in a new tank(aka cycling) before adding any fish. These bacteria help break down the waste that your fish produce. Without this bacteria, old food and waste will quickly rot in the tank and cause ammonia levels to rise, which can poison your fish.  Usually fishless cycle is recommend by using household ammonia or fish food, but you can still do a fish-in cycle. However, the thing about fish-in cycle is that you need to keep an eye on water parameters using one of this API Freshwater Master Test Kit, and change water when water parameters get too high. Once the tank is done cycling, then you can afford so slack back on water changing a bit more. Here's some link to read up on tank cycle  FIshless cycle Fish-in cycle"
bettafish,3bon83,le_nguyen349,3,Tue Jun 30 22:39:26 2015 UTC,"Well I apparently misunderstood what ""cycling"" meant. lol Thank you for the detailed response and links to further read. I guess I have some studying to do.   Stupid question coming... I like to understand why, so don't kill me people.  Is it not enough doing the same thing I was doing in the bowl but now in a bigger tank with a filter or is there more to bigger tanks? He always came across happy in his bowl and never had any issues. I thought that would continue but in a larger tank. I thought the filter was to aerate the water and make it to where I don't have to change as much water out.   Ugh, don't hate me. I really want to get it."
bettafish,3bon83,le_nguyen349,3,Tue Jun 30 23:48:37 2015 UTC,"I perfectly understand whAt you mean. Bettas are hardy fish, so ammonia building up in a bowl would not kill him very fast, but WILL kill them eventually. Bettas can live for a long time, up to 3-4 years, but many dies in months living in a bowl, since there's no where for bacteria to live on, and no oxygen from flowing water. That's why we need beneficial bacteria to convert ammonia -> nitrite -> nitrate (less toxic, and plants eat them). Technically a bigger tank means less work, since the ammonia spread out to more water volume, so less concentrated. Many people who don'tknow about cycling do ""accidental"" fish-in cycle: the tank is cycled in the end, but the risks of fish dying is high. So it's usually recommended for beginners AND veterans to always have a test kit handy to change water once the water parameter spikes to avoid fish loss."

bettafish,3bon83,doablysad,2,Tue Jun 30 22:13:16 2015 UTC,"fin nipping in bettas (especially halfmoons with large tails) is pretty common and unfortunately not much you can do. Fish with excessive finnage sometimes bite their own tails to lighten up the weight of having to swim around with such large tails. There isn't much you can do but most importantly is keeping the water parameters clean so when he does bite his tail he is healthy enough to prevent infection and the water is clean so he doesn't develop fin rot. Does he have a heater in the tank? Bettas do well in warm water 80+ degrees and it can help speed up the healing process. Also if you are doing a fish in cycle I HEAVILY recommend purchasing the api freshwater liquid test kit to make sure ammonia and nitrite don't spike too high. You will still need to be doing frequent water changes to keep the ammonia and nitrite at a non-toxic level until all your parameters are at 0. You can also bring in a sample of your water to a local fish store and ask them to test it for you so you can see where you stand. Bettas also make bubble nests in any condition its just a breeding behaviour, so a betta in a tiny bowl will make nests the same amount/size as one in a heated and filtered 10 gallon."
bettafish,3bon83,doablysad,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:00:39 2015 UTC,I could see how he might be doing it to lighten up his weight but I hope he stops pretty soon. His tail was so beautiful!   I do have a heater in his tank. I had it set at 79 degrees but then dropped it a little because it's been pretty hot in the house and the thermometer was showing a little over 80 degrees. I just didn't want to cook him. Will he be okay if I put it back at 80?  I just purchased the API Freshwater test Kit /u/le_nguyen349 recommended and should receive that on Monday.   Thank you for the detailed response!
bettafish,3bo8iz,lurkingn00b,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:19:56 2015 UTC,"How are your params? Sluggishness and laying on the bottom can be signs of ammonia poisoning.  If levels are ok, I've heard that bent spines can be associated with swim bladder issues (I think), which could also account for him laying around weirdly."
bettafish,3bkwdo,le_nguyen349,11,Tue Jun 30 01:35:08 2015 UTC,"I may not be the popular opinion here. It could have maybe been the flakes, but maybe he just genetically had something wrong. I mean, 99% of the problems on this subreddit are owner error, but we're also dealing with a breed of fish that is often inbred for color and kept in subpar conditions prior to purchase. There's going to be some out there with problems that we just can't fix. This is coming from someone about to lose one to cancer and just lost another to the same thing.  It could have been something you did, sure. I at first thought it could be stress from the tank mates, but that would have gotten better in the hospital tank. It might have been the food, but usually you're going to see much more in the way of bloating symptoms. You might never know. Don't beat yourself up over it too much."
bettafish,3bkwdo,runaround66,3,Tue Jun 30 05:25:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely. The flakes probably bloated his stomach. I read once that they take in air when they eat it and it causes their stomach to bloat up.   I'm very sorry for the loss of your fish (yours too, OP). Losing your bettas to such a horrible disease is the worst thing I could imagine. The inbreeding and terrible shipping and housing conditions at pet stores needs to stop. I myself own a betta with a birth defect probably due to poor breeding. He has a bad gill that makes it hard for him to breathe. He gets on ok, but he rests a lot which is understandable."
bettafish,3bkwdo,ZeldaMusic113,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:14:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the two I got that have gotten growths are from the same breeder. The one that I had to put down got a growth behind his dorsal fin that grew downward internally. The other one has a growth that started in front of his tail that has now grown to most of the end of his body. Not pretty, but he's still moving and eating."
bettafish,3bkwdo,runaround66,2,Wed Jul 1 02:10:43 2015 UTC,"It could've been some internal infection, starts with lethargy and no eating and can go downhill fast. How are the cories doing? any sign of stress or illness? if so immediatly treat the tank with some fish antibiotic treatment (you may have to take the shrimp out first)."
bettafish,3bkwdo,how_fedorable,3,Tue Jun 30 06:18:56 2015 UTC,The cories seems to be fine. Or at least for now. I'll have to observe them over the next few days
bettafish,3bkwdo,Hamilton5M,-20,Tue Jun 30 06:33:37 2015 UTC,"Fish have no hands or money to buy medicine.  It is your responsibility as caretaker for that tiny life to have medicine before it's needed.   Bettas should be alone. Maybe a snail, maybe a shrimp. If you want a variety of fish, don't buy a betta. Flakes are not good for them, you need a high quality pellet, and soak it before feeding so it doesn't swell up inside them. Cheap foods like flakes have a high content of garbage that is not digestible, or is plant and not protein. Never use plastic plants, they will tear the fins. Use the cotton test, if the cotton snags, it will rip the fin.   Odds are he had some sort of internal problem and got weaker and weaker. Usually disease is a lot longer process. Sudden death could be from food, or attacks from other fish while it slept. Loss of blood, or shock.  I would recommend you just convert the tank to tropical fish, and get more tetras, etc.   And for the love of jobe keep medicine at hand?"
bettafish,3bkwdo,breshecl,11,Tue Jun 30 03:36:53 2015 UTC,"Cories and shrimp are common tankmates for a betta. Flakes aren't necessarily the culprit, but yeah, pellets are agreed to be better.  Depending on the plant and the edges, some are fine, some are not.  Doesn't sound like medicine would have helped. It's easy to give the wrong medicine and just screw over the rest of the fish,  or give medicine that turns out to be harmful. If it's a pre-existing disease (I do agree there),  how the hell would random medicine have helped?  Converting the tank from betta to tetra doesn't resolve shit and doesn't help OP realize their dream of a happy and healthy betta-centric tank. How do I know OP wants this? Because they posted here looking for help and solutions so it won't happen again. Not to be treated as a sub-class human. Everyone loses fish eventually. One loss is not a valid reason to never try to keep the same kind of fish again."
bettafish,3bkwdo,Hamilton5M,-13,Tue Jun 30 04:29:23 2015 UTC,"What if they add a new betta and it's very aggressive? Then they need another tank to move the other fish to, or let the betta kill all the fish."
bettafish,3bkwdo,breshecl,11,Tue Jun 30 04:52:40 2015 UTC,"So you watch it closely for the first few hours and days, and if the betta is an issue, exchange it for a more peaceful one. The possibility that one betta might be aggressive shouldn't mean they can't try it out. Every betta I've ever had has been chill with tank mates. If I ever get one that causes issues, it'll be rehomed."
bettafish,3bloci,Uzzii,4,Tue Jun 30 05:54:54 2015 UTC,"That's a really cool looking tank! Can I ask where you got it?   Also you're going to want to take that bamboo out of your tank, it will slowly start to die as spike your ammonia if the leaves are submerged"
bettafish,3bloci,Gfunk98,2,Tue Jun 30 08:03:08 2015 UTC,"Yup, this is what happened to me as a newbie, and it stressed the heck out of my poor little guy! I was able to stabilize the tank, thankfully, but he lost a lot of his beautiful fins in the process and it took ages to help him grow it all back."
bettafish,3bloci,TheBlackPetunia,2,Tue Jun 30 15:59:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah i took it off after a few people told me. Thanks :)  I got it from petco, called fluval spec. Amazon has it as well"

bettafish,3blq3e,lady_cardamom,2,Tue Jun 30 06:14:15 2015 UTC,"Looks like he is just patrolling. how long has he been in the tank for? There is a chance he could see his reflection. Also, because he is a plakat he doesn't have that massive finnage to carry around and may just be more active."
bettafish,3blq3e,perhapsso,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:42:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe two weeks, three weeks? But all the live plants and that substrate are new, I just put it in over the weekend."
bettafish,3blq3e,ZeldaMusic113,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:41:46 2015 UTC,"As someone else mentioned, it could be that he's seeing his reflection, or that his short fins are giving him an extra speed boost. I had my lazy crown tail boy for five months before rescuing my veil tail girl. She loves to zip around her tank. Like you, I thought something was wrong, but after awhile I just realized she has shorter fins than my boy that let her swim faster.   Your boy is beautiful, btw! :)"
bettafish,3blq3e,snarry_shipper,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:02:49 2015 UTC,"I hope it isn't his reflection. I have 75% of the tank covered already to attempt reflection dampening; these tanks are so damn shiny. (He's doing it again this morning, btw.... back and forth...) Maybe he is just a zippy little dude.  And thank you!! I'd never seen one with his colouring before -- I got him at this random aquarium store in our chinatown. He's so intense. He's starting to realize when i stick my fingers in the water it means food, and he also seems to think he's a sea monster because tries to bite them off. The first time he did it it scared me to death, but now I think it's funny."

bettafish,3bj75u,ZeldaMusic113,2,Mon Jun 29 17:44:40 2015 UTC,"He looks fine to me, but that's not a great picture to be able to see any pineconing.  Would need a better picture or a video.  I will say that his fins don't look clamped to me, though.  If you're really convinced it could be dropsy, I would go ahead and treat his tank, as early detection is really the only way to cure dropsy.  Please make sure you stay away from any medications with tea tree oil in them, like PimaFix or MelaFix.    Dropsy  Symptoms: Your betta will have a bloated belly and raised scales. They will look like a pine cone. This is usually a fatal disease caused by an internal bacterial infection resulting in internal organ failure but many have had success bringing fish back when treated quickly. Early Symptoms: Swollen eyes (important), Gray belly (important), Clamped fins, Lethargy. If your fish has swollen eyes and a gray belly, I suggest that you treat it for Dropsy.  Treatment: If you spot the early signs of Dropsy then treat him/her with ES at 1-2tsp/gal and Jungle’s Anti-Parasite pellets while performing 100% daily water changes. It helps to increase the temperature to 84*F.  If he/she has begun Pineconing then do the full course as described below:   Performing daily 100% water changes Increase the temperature to 84*F Add 1-2 tsp/gal Epsom Salt Use API General Cure OR API Erythromycin OR Maracyn II and/or Maracyn for best results Feed something containing Metronidazole, for example, Jungle’s Anti-Parasite pellets   If caught early, Dropsy is curable.     SOURCE    Edited to add: if you start doing 100% water changes, please be sure to do them carefully to cause the least amount of stress to your fish as possible.   Do not net the fish and take it out of the tank unless absolutely necessary; rather, submerge a cup or other container to scoop it up with water while they're near the surface. Put a lid on whatever your fish is in while you're doing a water change! Unless you're treating a parasite infestation, it's best not to rinse the filter media or aquarium decor. This will cause the least amount of disruption to your cycle as possible Be sure the new water is as close to the water your fish is sitting in (in the cup) before putting them back"
bettafish,3bj75u,slidewithme,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:52:16 2015 UTC,"I've actually already gone out and gotten meds. I got API general cure and Epsom salt. I'd rather be safe then sorry! I could find the anti parasitic food, though. And yeah sorry for the horrible picture. He scales are slightly raised so I'm going to treat him. Do I have to treat his whole tank? I have a QT tank I was going to put him in to make treatment easier."
bettafish,3bj75u,slidewithme,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:26:41 2015 UTC,"Is he alone in his 5.5 gallon?  If he is, I say do it there to cause less stress.  If he's not, especially if you have any inverts in with him like snails, use the QT tank.  Keep us updated about your dude, I hope he's doing okay today."

bettafish,3bj75u,how_fedorable,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"I can't really tell from the picture, but does his belly look gray? it's another sign of dropsy, so maybe that can help you diagnose it.   Dropsy is most often caused by a bacterial infection, so if you're sure it's dropsy treat him with antibiotics (e.g. API Erythromycin, Maracyn Kanacyn, Neomycin, or tetracycline drugs).   I've also heard of people succesfully treating dropsy with medicated baths with methylene blue and Epsom salt (a couple of times a day IIRC, but you'd have to look that up I'm afraid).  I hope he'll recover!"

I put him in my tank after three hours of letting him get used to the water temp + periodically drip acclimating. He only chased a shrimp or two before giving up (he is much too slow for them!!).

bettafish,3bfw2z,sexytimespanda,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:34:02 2015 UTC,"See the clear tube. It sucks oxygen in and makes bubbles in your tank. Makes a nice little noise. That part that it connects to goes to the pump and to the outlet.   Anyway, any attempts to slow down the flow from the outlet will force water up that tube. So i suggest when tinkering you place a jug under that so as you dont get water everywhere.  Short of opening the filter up and tampering with it mechanically you can slow the flow by partially blocking the outlet, however, as i said the water will come out of the clear tube. On the bright side water coming out of the clear tube will be slow and could simpy be aimed at the tank.  You can also put ornaments and planets in front of the flow. That said the flow will generally push plants around so ornaments will be better."

bettafish,3bdgc4,hamilted,2,Sun Jun 28 05:43:12 2015 UTC,"Even though there is a larger volume, the amount of ammonia produced doesn't change. Soif you use the old filter and media (without rinsing them etc.), then yes, you will keep it cycled. However, a significant tankupgrade will require a larger filter (and maybe more substrate), which will have to be cycled."
bettafish,3bdgc4,how_fedorable,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:53:32 2015 UTC,"Ideally you shouldn't treat it like it's cycled but you can. To play it safe don't add new fish immediately, the fish in there that are used to the levels in that system should be fine though.

Fish in cycle are fine, but you have to remember to pay attention to the water parameters and change water when it gets high to ensure fish safety :D"
bettafish,3bc4ot,le_nguyen349,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:27:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I've known many who have spent plenty more than myself so I don't feel crazy just yet.  The filter is a fluval 206 that I was using on Dewo's 10 gallon for the past few months and is cycled. I also brought a few of the rocks and a little bit of substrate out of the tank to bring the bacteria over. I'm hoping with the increased bio-load that it'll spread quickly and get these guys squared away within a few days, then presuming all goes well I'll clean the filter and recharge the purigen in another week or so. I'll be watching for spikes during this time as well so we should be okay."
bettafish,3bcnfr,1200somewhere,2,Sat Jun 27 23:22:41 2015 UTC,"leave the food in (and maybe add some more once the ammonia levels go down), the bacteria need their food!   waterchanges will only slow down the cycling process, so you don't need to do them (this doesn't apply to fish-in cycling, obviously)."
bettafish,3bcnfr,how_fedorable,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:17:16 2015 UTC,"Yup leave the food in... in fact make sure there is a steady supply of ammonia otherwise the bacteria culture will come to a halt or decline and struggle accordingly once you add a fish that produces waste! Not sure if you're planning on keeping tank mates but don't add a lot of fish at once for this reason, give the tank time to acclimatise to the influx of ammonia.  Oh if you feel realllly adventurous with your cycling experimentation, try using pee. Home made ammonia right there! ;)"

bettafish,3b7urg,FeralHousewife,7,Fri Jun 26 20:37:44 2015 UTC,"I would like to think it went down like this:  Axeliah ruled every inch of the 10g and inspected it daily for trespassers. Mr. And Mrs. Guppy had paid their dues this week but El Tigre, that sneaky little Snail with his glossy black shell stripped with parallel orange spots the betta  knew was a tally of the weeks he'd gotten away with payment, was nowhere in sight.  Axeliah darted through long leaves of the Swords that swayed with the current, turning this way and that to no avail. The Snail wasn't here either. But unbeknownst to our dearly departed hero the harden criminal lay in wait until-  BAM!  A move quicker than the human eye could comprehend, El Tigre gave Axeliah a one, two punch that would lead to his demise. Our hero flared and fought the good fight but was no match.

I recently made a switch from pellets to flake food and they got noticeably fatter.  they're now fasting. he made a huge poop and looks more relieved. swimming normally and not sinking or gasping.  do his scales look ok?   I also saw a small clump of clear slime(?). is this his coat or is this clear poop or something else? I noticed the same thing with my other betta.  I can't get a clear picture of this."

bettafish,3b7rad,Mister_Po,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:44:27 2015 UTC,I would feed your betta flakes. When they eat them it can cause them to take in too much air and become bloated. Omega One has betta pellets that are really great. I feed them to my girl and she loves them!
bettafish,3b7rad,ZeldaMusic113,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:07:29 2015 UTC,He always spits out pellets.
bettafish,3b7rad,Mister_Po,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:50:58 2015 UTC,"I've personally never had a problem with flakes. Having use both them and pellets, I can say that Bettas take in roughly as much air eating both. If you are overly concerned you can do like I do and just grab a little piece of flake in feeding tongs and dangle it underwater in front of him. My fish loves eating that way and it prevents her from consuming any air with her food."
bettafish,3b7rad,Shills_for_fun,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:27:29 2015 UTC,Did you try soaking the pellets for like 5 minutes? He might be spitting it out because it's too crunchy.

bettafish,3b7ols,Situis,2,Fri Jun 26 17:09:57 2015 UTC,"How big is the tank you're looking to upgrade to? I've had success with African Dwarf frogs, and I'm fond of nerite snails. I've also heard that bottom-feeders like catfish and shrimp are good choices too, given the tank is large enough. Bettas can be aggressive, so a good sum up is anything that can swim faster than he can, or has a shell, would be an option."

bettafish,3b7ols,le_nguyen349,3,Fri Jun 26 17:24:48 2015 UTC,"For a 6 gallon there's not many options: only shrimp and snail. Catfish and tetras would need a school, which wouldn't fit in a 6 gallon (Maybe 3-4 of the the smaller catfish, like pygmy cory). Have you try Aqadvisor? It's a website where you put in your tank (gallon), fish you have (or fish you want), and it will show you what % stocking you are at and some info on the fish.  Aqadvisor  I entered for you an example: 6g"
bettafish,3b7ols,Astilaroth,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:02:20 2015 UTC,I'm thinking a small school of rasboras maybe
bettafish,3b7ols,Astilaroth,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:52:24 2015 UTC,"I'd advice against it. I think for a betta and a school of fish to live in the same tank, it'd have to be 10+ gallon with a lot of hiding place, since betta and schooling fish swim in the same area (middle and top of the tank). Even though the betta might not react at first, it would probably snap one day in such a small tank. Small catfish, snail and shrimp are usually what's safe for a 6 gallon (25 liters).  It's a different story if you decided to upgrade to a 10 gallon though. It's a little bit bigger, but have plenty of space for a small school, a betta, some catfish, shrimp and snails :) If you live in the US, Petco dollar per gallon sale starts this Sunday. You can get a 10 gallon for $10 there."
bettafish,3b7ols,Thesladenator97,-2,Fri Jun 26 20:18:51 2015 UTC,I'm in the UK. I think I'd be okay with this tank as it's got a very large footprint and Mr. Bubbles isn't exactly a speedy swimmer
bettafish,3b5kqy,alphie33,5,Fri Jun 26 03:50:14 2015 UTC,Definitely get gravel then. Sand substrate are VERY annoying to move and clean.
bettafish,3b5kqy,le_nguyen349,4,Fri Jun 26 04:25:26 2015 UTC,"I have had white sand and I have had natural brown gravel. I must say that I prefer the gravel for a couple of reasons:   The sand got brown/green and always looked dirty.   Fish poo sits on top of sand and crates a nasty brown layer. In gravel it can sink down and eventually build up, but it is easier to vacuum it away without losing some substrate.  I prefer the natural look of the gravel.  If you want to add plants, I think gravel is easier to plant in. On top of that, gravel makes it easier for fish poo (fertilizer) to reach the plant's roots.  Here is my 20g tank when it had sand  Here is my 10g with natural gravel  You can see what I mean about the sand looking dirty. It wouldn't be a problem with black sand though. Both tanks have a layer of soil under the gravel/sand (this is called the Walstad style), so that contributes to the dirty look too. The gravel does have some algae, but I am not that bothered by it any more.  BTW: If you are interested in doing a planted tank, check out /r/PlantedTank for inspiration, advice, and answers."
bettafish,3b5kqy,purple_cats,2,Fri Jun 26 04:26:35 2015 UTC,"I have two tanks currently, a 29 gallon for Twitch, and a 10 gallon (just set up today, WEE!) for Stella. Both have gravel. The reason for this is my husband has roughly 20ish 50 gallons, and has sand in one of them. Only one now, because the sand seems to work into filters and destroy them (and he uses really expensive filters) as well as not look very pretty unless it is cleaned all the time, and so hard to put water in it without disturbing the surface of it.  I don't have anything in my tank that could possibly be destroyed by sand, but it just doesn't seem practical. :)"

bettafish,3b5kqy,isseidoki,2,Fri Jun 26 10:11:57 2015 UTC,"I've had sand (yellow, not white) for ages because I have fish that like to dig in it. Sand is pretty cool, but you have to be careful how you suck up the poo that lands on it or you'll just suck up the sand. It's easier to clean (thick) gravel when it comes to that. Sand also can have the tendency to become really dense (and possibly start rotting or suffocate roots of plants) because of the small grains and the water pressure, but because of the digging fish and the fact that I run my fingers through it before a water change it's never really been a problem for me.   With gravel you mostly have benefits really, just yeah, when you plan to have kuhli loaches or corydoras catfish I'd really want to recommend sand, the buggers love love love digging.   I see you have a 10 gal, that would be too small for corydoras though (at the very least a 15 gal long)... so yeah just go for gravel. Far more options with sizes and colors too so you can totally go nuts with that. Have fun! Decorating an aquarium is awesome."
bettafish,3b5kqy,Astilaroth,2,Fri Jun 26 10:34:29 2015 UTC,"Gravel, I tried both in a dorm setting, and sand is a PAIN to keep clean. I'd only invest in sand if you're thinking about getting live plants and want to use soil with sand."

That way he will have the clean water from the bigger tank, make sure that the breeder box is made of material that will allow the water to pass through it. Due to the smaller size of the box and the fact that it hangs from the tank it won't be such a large distance to the surface. It might help him to breath from the surface more and it won't be such an effort to eat the floating food either."

Live brine shrimp are also an option that betta fish like that may entice him a bit more than the aqueon betta food. One more thing, whats the temperature of the tank? Bettas like to be in nice warm water, so if the water is super cold he's not going to move around very much. The ideal temperature for a betta is 78-80 degrees. Do you have a filter for the five gallon? That will help with water quality too. Can you post a pic of the tank? There might be something else that we could help you out with.

In general, these types of tanks aren't the best, very little horizontal swimming space.  I also wouldn't add a betta to your 29, bettas won't drown, but they do like access to the surface. They also really hate strong currents."
bettafish,3b5eex,how_fedorable,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:02:00 2015 UTC,A 29 high would be fine for a betta. I had a sorority in a 2 foot deep tank and everyone was just fine. The only way your betta would drown is if it got stuck and couldn't reach the surface or became too sick to swim to the surface. But it's a bad idea to mix bettas with swords and gourami. The swords look too much like a betta and for the gourami labyrinth fish shouldn't be kept together.  If I have learned anything it's that there is always room for another tank. What kinda room are you working with at the moment?
bettafish,3b2zvg,how_fedorable,2,Thu Jun 25 15:34:23 2015 UTC,"Is he a plakat? It might just be me, but he looks like a she."

bettafish,3b2zvg,ZeldaMusic113,2,Thu Jun 25 18:11:04 2015 UTC,"Well, sometimes females blow nests and can have small beards. My girl blew a couple of nests in the while that I've had her. The telltale sign is an egg spot."
bettafish,3b2zvg,ZeldaMusic113,2,Thu Jun 25 18:28:19 2015 UTC,"I'm 90% certain it's  a male, he has all the characteristics, including longer verntral fins, beard+flaring, and regular bubblenests. The coloring is also very similar (identical?) to that of male wildtypes. Younger males can also have something that resembles an eggspot, so it's always a guess to some extend."
bettafish,3b2zvg,crazy-fishlady,2,Thu Jun 25 19:14:05 2015 UTC,Wild type is another name for plakat. It just means that the fins are shorter. You betta does seem to have shorter ones. Your fish's shape/body type are practically identical to my female. That's why I'm pretty convinced you have a girl. Here is a pic for comparison.
bettafish,3b2zvg,readysetderp,2,Thu Jun 25 20:49:18 2015 UTC,"Wild type in this case refers to the colors :) Like I said, this one has all the characteristics of a male, apart from the long fins (though his anal fin is much larger than regular female fins), and the body type is much closer to a standard male (not particularly round, he had dinner right before this picture was taken) than to the standard female.  I appreciate your concern, but I am fairly certain it's a male."
bettafish,3b2zvg,Mirarii,2,Thu Jun 25 21:08:01 2015 UTC,"My female/male betta Daisy is the exact same, I bought her as a female, but she looks identical to yours.

But apparently not.  And her very masculine beard.  I guess it's a little disappointing, but it makes sense. She's always been extremely aggressive, and a prolific bubble nest maker."

bettafish,3b4fnk,new_world_chaos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:53:25 2015 UTC,"Do you have a heater for the tank? Bettas are tropical fish and really need a heater with water at 75-80F. Also, hopefully you are familiar with aquarium cycle, and had cycled the tank beforehand. It is important to establish an adequate beneficial bacteria colony in a new tank(aka cycling) before adding any fish. These bacteria help break down the waste that your fish produce. Without this bacteria, old food and waste will quickly rot in the tank and cause ammonia levels to rise, which can poison your fish.  However, if you haven't cycled the tank yet, then you can still do a fish-in cycle; betta are hardy fish and they can handle it, just don't add anymore fish just yet. You will need do buy one of these API Master test kit to keep track of the water parameter, and change water whenever ammonia of nitrites get too high until tank is fully cycled. Read up on this beginner betta guide and educate yourself on tank cyclying :)  Betta care sheet  Fishless cycle  Fish in cycle"
bettafish,3b4fnk,le_nguyen349,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:13:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I have a heater in the filter compartment. I got the thermometer to make sure that it was evenly heating it from that spot (It's at 79f). I had the tank for about a month before I could get a fish and cycled it during that time. That master kit looks cool and I'll probably pick that up. I got one that only came with 4 test strips and it was pretty expensive just for those 4 (It did the same stuff but had 2 types of hardness as well).
bettafish,3b2izp,Takumon,7,Thu Jun 25 13:17:55 2015 UTC,1.5g would not be suitable for a betta.
bettafish,3b2izp,Bad_lol_player,-1,Thu Jun 25 13:32:00 2015 UTC,How so?
bettafish,3b2izp,ZeldaMusic113,5,Thu Jun 25 13:42:02 2015 UTC,"It's way too small for any fish to be reasonably comfortable. If you want your fish to be happy, get them each a 5g. If you really wanted to, you could divide a single 5g do they each get 2.5. Heck, you could even get a10g and divide it. 2.5g is considered the bare minimum for bettas. If you want to have happy fish don't give then less than the bare minimum."
bettafish,3b2izp,ShadowRancher,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"Alright I understand. I don't have a choice to keep any tank bigger than 8g, cuz I live in an apartment and have to keep these tanks in my room. Well, too bad. Maybe when I save more money I can get a 7g and split it. Thanks for your input!"
bettafish,3b2izp,how_fedorable,3,Thu Jun 25 17:44:14 2015 UTC,Its too small...2.5 gal is the absolute minimum for a healthy betta with 5 being more suitable.

It has taken him 7 months, but he just learned that when I drop something new and unusual in the water, I probably want a new trick. Instead of me having to lure him, he'll now start making stuff up and see if he'll get a reward.  Dropped a green twist tie in the water, and he drifts in a circle around it. (head stays pointed toward it, body stays straight, makes a circle. It looks really cool.)  I wanted him to pick the twist tie up and carry it to a target, but what the heck! I'll just find something else for him to carry. :)"

bettafish,3az79a,Takumon,2,Wed Jun 24 18:58:19 2015 UTC,"Cool! Just wondering, how did you train him to defecate in the cup?"
bettafish,3az79a,8Erinyes8,6,Wed Jun 24 20:10:48 2015 UTC,"Haha, you made me look at my own video twice! Those are bloodworm ""treats"" he gets as a reward. In reality he is just swimming into, and out of the cup. He hates to be netted or chased in any way, so when I need to move him I have him swim into the cup, and out where ever he needs to go. Since this was just a demonstration he didn't go anywhere this time. :) I'm working on a water bridge so he can swim between this tank and another tank, but that's another video!"
bettafish,3az79a,8Erinyes8,2,Wed Jun 24 20:29:16 2015 UTC,Is he comfortable with you holding him? I had to move my betta recently. He loves humans so I was surprised when I put my hand under him and he laid against me while I picked him up and moved him into the temporary home.
bettafish,3az79a,Takumon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:17:59 2015 UTC,"I've never tried. He's very uncomfortable with being moved. I used to train him in a bowl (distraction free environment) and move him back when he was done. He started refusing to swim into the cup when I made that a regular thing. It took me weeks to get him to start going into and out of the cup again. Now I only move him if I absolutely have to, and he's far more willing to go in and out.  I haven't actually done a lot of hand interaction, I should try it and see what happens. :)"
bettafish,3az79a,Takumon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:47:41 2015 UTC,I may have to ask you for advice when I want to start training Merlin. He really loves humans and interacting with me so I think tricks would be great for him.

I nodded my head just like anyone else would, and carried on with life, and then I realized I don't actually have any proof to point at.  Dogs are brilliant animals. It has been proven that they can feel emotions, the most well tested dog has learned over 1,000 words. (Average is around 150)  Fish aren't so well tested. They lack vocal cords and thus can't verbally communicate with us, and since verbal communication is so much of our language, there is a big gap between us.  It'd be interesting to figure out ways of testing betta intelligence and seeing just how far they can go. Anyone interested in giving a few fishy intelligence tests a try?"
bettafish,3az79a,Confidence_Trickster,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:58:02 2015 UTC,"That's true. Good point. Maybe I'll do some tests and let all of you know if I find anything interesting. If you have some tests you know of, link them to me bro."

bettafish,3b12t1,Kitty_party,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:25:15 2015 UTC,"though I haven't moved fish that far (max for me was 4 hours),  this worked just fine for me.   Use a watertight container (or bag), don't feed him the day before moving.  Make sure there is plenty of air in the bag, but also ensure that there is no way the fish can accidentally get out of the water.  Keep the bag in some towels to keep the water from cooling down too fast."
bettafish,3b12t1,how_fedorable,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:44:32 2015 UTC,"This would work if you open/reclose the bag for a fresh air supply every 2-3 hours. A cup or tupperware is easier, imo."

bettafish,3awnol,Quio,4,Wed Jun 24 02:34:55 2015 UTC,"Bettas are much happier in larger tanks, this subreddit recommends 2.5 gallons, but other places recommend 5 gallons and up for a single betta. The water may have been to warm, a 25 watt seems to be better for 5 gallons than 1. Also you may need to change water more in a 1 gallon tank."
bettafish,3awnol,Bubblegumdoge,3,Wed Jun 24 02:50:38 2015 UTC,"OP, just FWIW, I have a 5.5 gallon tank and I feel it's too small. It may seem insane for a single fish but they really swim everywhere and explore everything. You'll want lots of non-betta stuff in the tank like plants.  Go with a 10 gallon. It seems crazy for one fish but trust me, you'll regret going with a smaller tank. I wish I could upgrade but I'm not particularly eager to cycle another tank. Do it right the first time."
bettafish,3awnol,Shills_for_fun,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:12:30 2015 UTC,"It helps just as much to have interesting decor (lacey plants, caves/small pots, etc) to explore as much as space. This goes for any pet. Mine is very happy and active in his 5.5gal and I'm always changing his plants around. I'm hoping to teach him how to jump a little for his food like my last betta."
bettafish,3awnol,Howlibu,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:25:03 2015 UTC,"If you bring the filter over you won't need to cycle again. Or if you want to also upgrade the filter, just put the filter media from the 5.5g filter into the new filter and you'll be good to go."
bettafish,3awnol,Bad_lol_player,5,Wed Jun 24 08:54:35 2015 UTC,"71-78F is too big a range; as others have said here, he may not have been that healthy to begin with. The stress of moving to a new home as well as the big temperature swings could have been too much for an already weak fish. There may not have been much you could have done at that point.   Air pumps help add oxygen to tank water by causing commotion. But bettas prefer still water and perhaps more importantly they don't clean the water, so it's not very helpful in this case. I'd recommend this filter but instead of the given filters, toss them out and use biomedia and sponge filter (brand doesn't matter). I have this on my 5gal and it's very quiet. We have one on a little half gallon at work, and it does just fine. Sponge filters are also a good option.   Educate yourself on the aquarium cycle. In short, beneficial bacteria help break down the waste that your fish produce. Without this bacteria, old food and waste will quickly rot in the tank and cause ammonia levels to rise, which can poison your fish. This is why it is so important to establish an adequate bacteria colony in a new tank(aka cycling) before adding any fish, otherwise there will not be enough bacteria to handle added fish. When traveling from the store to your home, they are stressed, and when they are stressed, they put out ammonia. If there is not enough bacteria in your new tank ammonia levels will quickly rise and can poison your fish, especially in a small tank. This is also why big tanks are less maintenance than smaller ones, since you have that much more of a supply of bacteria to keep the tank chemistry stable.   The bacteria break down ammonia into safer chemicals, which are then taken out when you do water changes. It's better to do frequent smaller weekly water changes than a big monthly one. ~15% once a week should be fine ONLY IF you have a filter on it. That bacteria is mostly in the filter(that's what the biomedia is for, to give surface area for bacteria to grow) and without it your water is simply going stagnant. Hence why unfiltered tanks need to be changed nearly every day to keep the water clean and fresh.  TL; DR Get a filter (links above), will make life much easier for your fish (literally). See if the store will let you exchange the nutrients for bacteria supplement instead to get a cycle started. A cycled, filtered tank is far less maintenance than an unfiltered one. Air pumps do not clean the water."
bettafish,3awnol,Howlibu,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:14:02 2015 UTC,This :)
bettafish,3awnol,le_nguyen349,2,Wed Jun 24 22:51:49 2015 UTC,"It seems like you are on the right track, and the other advice is spot on (bigger tank most important). One note, you don't need an air pump or airstone for a Betta. They are labyrinth breathers which means they go to the surface and breathe rather than using oxygen from the water through their gills. What you will want is a small filter, but one that doesn't cause too much water current, they generally prefer still water.  That being said, do it because you want a really cool fish buddy (you do) not because you want to make those purchases worthwhile. You'll be spending lots more money for more/better stuff on him over time."
bettafish,3awnol,fuci,2,Wed Jun 24 04:27:08 2015 UTC,"There's a practical reason why you should start cycling a bigger tank: less maintenance.  It may seem counter-intuitive, but if you have a big tank, you don't need to change the water all the time (one/week, and only 20% of the water).  In your one gallon bowl, you'll have to change that every day, 100% of the water. Not only does this make you unhappy, it makes your fish unhappy, and he doesn't have any room for activities.  Petco has a sale coming up (I think). Get yourself a big tank and start cycling it. Not only will your betta appreciate it, you'll actually have the time to just enjoy having an aquarium rather than it being a daily burden."

bettafish,3awnol,komse,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:50:25 2015 UTC,"The water nutrients aren't necessary, that's for live plants. You don't want the temperature varying so much.

bettafish,3awnol,Bad_lol_player,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:27:45 2015 UTC,Why was there such a wide range of temperatures? A properly functional heater should hold it pretty steady.

bettafish,3awnol,mmmichelle,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:52:01 2015 UTC,There was such a range because I was getting different opinions from different people online as well have friends who work with pets...
bettafish,3awnol,JellybettaFish,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:00:39 2015 UTC,"The smaller the tank, the more sensitive it is to the ambient room temperature, too. In some climates, with a 1 gallon, you'd need a stay-at-home-fish-mom to keep the temperature stable."
bettafish,3awnol,Howlibu,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:40:56 2015 UTC,"What you want is a consistent warm temperature. 78-80F is the recommended temp range around here, and will be warmer than most people keep their houses. Standing water tends to be cooler than ambient room temps. Bettas (along with other kinds of fish!) are small, cold blooded creatures, and they depend on their environment for correct amount of heat in order to digest their food and boost their immune systems. And being small, cold-blooded creatures, it's hard on them when ambient temps are all over the place.   Source: work in an aquatics shop and have worked with pets for years"
bettafish,3awnol,ComelyChatoyant,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:57:55 2015 UTC,"Please up the size of your tank to at least a 5 gal (a lot of people say a 2.5 min, but that's still pretty small). It will be less maintenance, look cooler, and lead to a happier active fish! I have a 10 gallon for Sasha and his snail friend that is a great size. You'll want some decorations for your fish so (s)he can hide and explore, a filter (and you can make an easy baffle if it creates too much current), a thermometer, some aquarium salt, and a hood for the tank. Be absolutly positive that anything in the tank (including gravel) has never been washed with soap, it will leach into the water and poison your fish. The tank should stay just under 80 degrees farenheit. Mine is usually at 78. Lastly, make sure the food you have for him is a high quality pellet. Feed  two pellets soaked in tank water for 10 minutes twice a day and adjust your feedings to the size of your fish. You can give treats like frozen (not freezedried) blood worm, beef heart, etc.   Good luck and enjoy this rewarding hobby!"
bettafish,3atepg,aoideos,4,Tue Jun 23 10:45:33 2015 UTC,"He is beautiful. If I am wrong then please ignore me, but it looks like he is fighting a strong water current to swim. If so, it would be in his best interest to slow down the current a bit. I had the same issue in my community tank and my betta nearly died from exhaustion. After a few days in a breeder box he recovered and is happy in his tank. I put a bunch of Java moss hanging out of the filter to slow the water flow."
bettafish,3atepg,Arod162,2,Tue Jun 23 17:05:07 2015 UTC,"Ive been a bit concerned about that too. I changed filters to a tetra whisper 20i for my 29 gal since there was a pretty strong current before. He seems to be okay now, active and not hiding in the plants or ornaments like he did the first couple days. But Ive been rearranging the decorations to see if I can cut down on the current even more but just in case I have his cup in the corner for him to hide out in.   This is basically my first betta (I had one as a kid but he was in a bowl) so advice is always welcome :)"
bettafish,3atepg,Paxalon,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:01:10 2015 UTC,You may want to look into rigging up a baffle.  Some people do it with pop bottles.
bettafish,3atepg,Wetpocket,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:59:01 2015 UTC,I was trying to avoid it since it doesnt look as nice and I think it would be difficult on the current filter since theres no lid on it. But I'm prepared to rig it up if he starts hiding a lot or struggling.  There are definitely spots for him to rest since its pretty well planted in the back and the statue is hollow. Plus he has the cup I mentioned (tho its not in this picture) in the back left corner. But I am thinking the bubbler may not be the best idea and might take it out.  But he has been eating well and actively exploring the tank quite a bit. He hangs out in his cup or the statue sometimes but never for long. Theres been a little flaring at the tetras when they get too curious but otherwise he seems pretty content.

bettafish,3awv5t,Andrewrox96,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:56:05 2015 UTC,The airpump is just weak or the valve is in the wronge direction (probably not though). Either get a better pump or put the air pump hanging above the tank's water line and remove the check valve.

bettafish,3autuf,Astilaroth,2,Tue Jun 23 18:31:25 2015 UTC,"Get a nice transporter bag like /u/Astilaroth said, fast him for a day and do a large waterchange before the car ride. Wrap his bag in some towels so his water doesn't get too cold too fast."

bettafish,3aumy5,TheLegendofSandwich,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:20:23 2015 UTC,Maybe its a decoration? If you have any plastic stuff try taking them out and looking for sharp edges.
bettafish,3aumy5,yolibobchris,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:20:41 2015 UTC,I made sure none of the decorations had sharp edges when I put them in there. Perhaps I missed a spot. I'll search and see! That's the only explanation I have for it as well.
bettafish,3aumy5,yolibobchris,2,Tue Jun 23 18:24:39 2015 UTC,"Do you have anything that you can bend then it will stay in place? Maybe a wire got exposed. If your water starts turning yellow thats probably what it is. But yes, check decorations. The best you can do is see if it will heal itself. Im not great at actual treatment though so maybe someone else can help with that ;)"
bettafish,3aumy5,oddmeister,2,Tue Jun 23 18:27:14 2015 UTC,You'd be surprised by what they can rip their fins on.  One of mine ripped his tail fin on a crypt wendtii leaf.  I facepalmed when I saw that happen because it looked like he was doing it on purpose.

bettafish,3asy5o,TommyDGT,2,Tue Jun 23 06:48:25 2015 UTC,Turn it to its lowest setting. If that fails restrict the flow. Use plants and or ornaments to slow the water.
bettafish,3asy5o,Ottoshik,2,Tue Jun 23 07:04:34 2015 UTC,"Hello! Yes the Bettas don't need a high filter flow, keep it at a very low setting.  I have a filter that you can change the flow and keep it very low for my little guy.  If yours doesn't have this setting I'd probably invest in one to slow down the flow.  As for the lights, I'd turn them off.  They need/have sleep cycles just like us and needs their dark times to rest.    Hope this helps!"

When I set up the tank the flow was way too strong, so I made a baffle using a plastic container- you could use a plastic water or soda bottle.  I just cut the bottom off and then cut it lengthwise and put it over the outflow.  Slows the current right down.

Sponge Filters are used for babies, if you don't mind the air pump vibrating noises.  You can get a timer for your lights so they turn on and off automatically. I got the $10 ones at walmart, myself. One ended up breaking, but that's what I get for buying from Walmart.  Also make sure that your tank is about 75-80 degrees F. You might need a larger heater than you had in your .5g. Here are thermometers, but you can buy one of these at Walmart too. Petsmart's brand is like $2 or something."

bettafish,3asy5o,Wetpocket,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:02:07 2015 UTC,I use the Marina power filter that has an adjustable flow built in. It hangs on the back of the tank and the pump is internal so you don't have to hear it buzzing away.

bettafish,3asy5o,MadameInternet,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:31:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, turn the lights off at night. Any animal will need a sense of day and night. Also algae will grow if the lights are left on all the time.  See if there are DIY bafflers for your type of filter. Here's instructions for making one out of an empty water bottle for a power filter."
bettafish,3asn2o,irreama,5,Tue Jun 23 04:39:20 2015 UTC,"I was looking at that Thermo yesterday, it is apparently iffy. Just get a glass thermometer, they're much more reliable.  Definitely consider NOT buying those plants and going with real plants instead. They're surprisingly easy to keep; an Amazon Sword will thrive with just root tab. Water Wisteria is terrifyingly fast at reproducing, and makes a good amount of cover for your fishy. My Anubia Nana is doing fine with nothing extra being added.   Real plants also have the added benefit of sucking Nitrate out of the water - the end product of the Ammonia->Nitrite->Nitrate cycle, which can really help with keeping your tank healthy. Also consider using a Walstad setup to encourage plant growth.   Finally, I feel live plants are better for Bettas as you don't need to worry about any sharp edges or points snagging a Betta's fins and tearing them. And they just look so much nicer, imho. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me or head over to r/plantedtank.  EDIT: Your tank also comes with a filter, so check how the flow is on that filter first - you might be able to use it as well/instead."

bettafish,3asn2o,le_nguyen349,2,Tue Jun 23 04:41:40 2015 UTC,"I love the setup! Here's a few things in my opinion:   Definitely get an Elephant ears (personal favorite) as i find they are usually very docile, which means you can add all sorts of tank mates like red cherry shrimps, cory cats, tetras and snails! I dont think you need to waste money on buying a complete tank set; just a simple 10 gal tank will do fine as you are also buying all the other components separately. Black gravel (or all colored gravel) in my experience loses its color (they dye it i think), so normal brown gravel is recommended. Or black or white sand is also nice! Definitely get some tall (a bit taller than the tank) plants because bettas like to sit on them. Also real plants is always better than fakes. You can get cheap, low tech beginner plants like java fern, java moss, anubias, anarcharis, etc. which requires (almost) no CO2, fertilizers, and to actually be planted in the gravel. Also Get a real, good looking piece of driftwood instead of the betta log!"
bettafish,3asn2o,le_nguyen349,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:49:37 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about getting some bronze cories as well, but I wasn't sure if 10 gallons would be big enough or not.  If I do end up going that route, should I get the cories first and then the betta? Let them get situated and then introduce the betta so as not to piss him off?"
bettafish,3asn2o,sinkshipss,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:14:17 2015 UTC,"For a 10 gallon, i'd recommend smaller types of cories like panda cory so you can get 4 of them (they're social). Then you can introduce the betta i think :) Also at the fish store, choose the bettas that are active but DONT flare that much, for better chance of introducing him into a community tank. And as i mention GET REAL (low tech) PLANTS. Its a definite must that can help maintain your first tank much better."
bettafish,3asn2o,sinkshipss,2,Tue Jun 23 17:26:05 2015 UTC,I just bought the Marina 5 gallon and it's awesome!   It comes with a filter already that has an adjustable flow and an internal pump.   All you need is gravel and a heater to complete! Also maybe buying a fluorescent lightbulb to replace the light it comes with.

Yu probably don't have to do many waterchanges at first, you want the ammonia to be relatively high.
