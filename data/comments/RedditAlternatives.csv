Currently we do not take a cut from the transactions, it’s rude when we’re starting up. I ran BitPixr.com which allowed users to earn dogecoin per view (this went up in flames when people f5f5f5f5’d). I took a 10% cut there, and realized the model just won’t work. Here at BitVoat, I want people to use BTC, LTC, DOGE with out fees. Its your money, earn it, spend it. That being said, I may have to take 0.5% or 2% in the future. I see the day where people create alt accounts and tip huge amounts of coin back and forth to buff their stats. Introducing a ‘tax’ will mean the users are wasting money. This is similar to the BTC / LTC / DOGE transaction fee, and it prevents spam. Even still, I plan to use these coins to put back in to the community for give aways. If BitVoat is going to be successful, EVERY ONE needs to have some coins. This tax mechanism is a great way to raise coins to give away. The taxes may end up going to the subvoat moderators, who will be responsible for giveaway events in their sub. Or they can keep it as payment for their work."

The incessant banning was one thing. I wouldn't have had a problem if they just banned those but they didn't. Any new ones that popped up, even satirically, were banned. On top of that, many subreddits which broke the rules they put forth were left standing. On top of that, the majority of the default subs went dark complaining, which detracted a lot. The moderators are relatively useless as is, but complain for more power and tools. Then Ellen leaves and they hire a guy who's going to end up doing things worse to reddit than she did.  The site isn't what it was a year ago. They're going against things they stood for. That and just generally the site has gotten far too big, bloated, and filled with nonsensical bullshit. I want something for good conversation not this constant circlejerk. I'm sick of seeing the same 3 names on the top of absolutely everything.

I don't think there is a term for this but I'll call it 'new age' -- everything seems new age, from the landing page design to the .io domain etc. Like all the hip startups are doing. Something that feels new age instantly has a lot of credibility with me. I guess it would be possible to fake it but I haven't seen that.   That's also not something I have seen much of in the alternative space. Voat is decidedly not new age, for example. I could elaborate about what that tells me about those operating in the space right now but I'll let you connect the dots.   So...good first impression with me.   P.S. we give alternative creators special flair in this sub (I'm a mod). Not sure if you want to use a personal account in the future or this one (most people use personal accounts, not accounts for the alternative itself)."

I think reddit style system is really cool so I based it on it.  The main difference between reddit will be that admins would be the owner of subs and they run their own rules and get 50% on any token(gold) giving that happened to their sub and probably 50% of ads if they enable it. They have the option to pay out their mods or do whatever they want with it.  Currently token doesn't do anything but it probably be used for enabling site features or maybe subs can sell physical products or something."

RedditAlternatives,3dim3l,justinguest1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:26:45 2015 UTC,It's gonna depend on how it's coded. It can always be optimized to make it cheaper. The most I paid on app engine is few cents for a week when one of my android API was hitting 300k+ hits. But that one is very simple API. I deploy all my projects on app engine it's been good so far.

RedditAlternatives,3dfnga,zshall,3,Thu Jul 16 13:24:03 2015 UTC,"I remember being interested in doing a similar sort of thing for my university when they shut down our old forum software. I always thought newsgroups were perfect for forum discussion and that the clearly defined NNTP protocol would make it easy to have good reader clients. There aren't a lot of Newsgroup server daemons out there, and most of what exists is to integrate with an upstream provider. What I looked at was DNEWS which runs on Windows and Linux, and seems to be pretty robust though rather old and costs money. Another idea I encountered was using the Twisted Python framework and their Twisted News NNTP server. I'm not sure how well supported it is but NNTP is designed to scale well already (like IRC) and if you use text-only boards it could be quite nice!  I know of some free Usenet providers out there that are pretty good as well, though I don't think they let you make your own groups. Eternal September is a nice text-only provider, for instance.  It may well not be practical at this point to find enough people to get on board with Usenet, but I feel like getting a good NNTP client on Android / iOS in the style of Alien Blue and a good web gateway would help gain users. Perhaps using NNTP servers as a backend and a reader that would jump to the first link in a post as a submitted link like reddit and replies would be treated as comments. I'd be all for it!  Edit: Found and dusted off my old Twisted News wrapper. I've removed university-specific code and reduced it to a single file. This server stands alone, though I'm sure one can write a variant that takes articles from another server pretty easily, as that is one of the protocol's strengths. You can take a look at the server code here. You'll need Python 2.7 and the ""twisted"" pip package. Run with a user account that can open ports or it will error out."

RedditAlternatives,3dfnga,fenrisx,0,Thu Jul 16 12:13:34 2015 UTC,"Reddit is not free. Reddit appears to be free, but they sell your data to advertisers and will continue to look for monetization options.  https://www.reddit.com/wiki/privacypolicy  The wording here is great. Your posts and activity is not private, even on private subreddits or ""not readily accessible to the public,"" so ""involved parties"" are free to use it as that party sees fit. Yet they say they'll never sell your personal information, but they may use the subreddit topic or IP address to target ads. That is selling your personal information, even if it's not every single bit of analytics data in some packaged bundle third parties can use for analysis. And if they think ad companies aren't building implicit profiles cross-site where possible, they don't know how ads work.  Also, I wonder if ""emergency circumstances"" can include, but is not limited to, ""our investors want money and we'll shut down otherwise.""  We can hope they are honorable and stick to the spirit of a lot of this privacy policy, but the wording is appropriately vague to allow them lots of wiggle room.  Personally, if there were a much less painful way, like Subbable, to pay for site subscriptions via one account that allows you to manage those subscriptions, pay a small flat fee per month or by usage, and bundle content together, I think we could kick this advertising habit. The other solution is self hosting like Aether, but that's harder to do well with good performance. Servers, certs, registration, and your time cost money. It's not free."

RedditAlternatives,3d3k4s,tehdang,4,Tue Jul 14 10:17:52 2015 UTC,I had a look at Voat. Not impressed. The whole CCP and SCP restrictions make it feel very elitist and unwelcoming.
RedditAlternatives,3d3k4s,Meth-Damon,17,Sun Jul 19 00:29:57 2015 UTC,"Hardly. They're put in place to stop spammers, alt accounts from downvoting, as well as to promote discussion. It demands that a user be part of the discussion, which is why it's superior. It's not just a link aggregate, it's a forum.   And the 'restrictions' are pathetically low and can be wiped out in less than an hour. If you think they're elitest and unwelcoming, then you didn't try."
RedditAlternatives,3d3k4s,tehdang,7,Sun Jul 19 08:03:05 2015 UTC,"It demands that a user be part of the discussion   If you have to 'demand' anything from the user, then you automatically make it less open.  And you're right, I didn't try. I don't have to on Reddit. I can just create an account and start to upvote and downvote as I please. As you say, they probably put those barriers in place to stop spammeres and alt-accounts but it doesn't make it feel any less restrictive.  Here I can reply to your post because I want to have a conversation with you. On Voat, when I comment, I'm not thinking ""I want to have a conversation"", I'm thinking ""How do phrase my comments so I can get more voats and earn the right to downvoat too""."
RedditAlternatives,3d3k4s,Meth-Damon,-4,Mon Jul 13 08:51:29 2015 UTC,"Here I can reply to your post because I want to have a conversation with you.

Once again, the limits are so pathetically low that in 2 or 3 random comments you'll get upvoted. But you're too whiny to actually bother. Probably for the best you're not an active member if you're just bitching all the time without trying anything. Have fun with that mentality."
RedditAlternatives,3d3k4s,tehdang,5,Mon Jul 13 09:19:42 2015 UTC,"But you're too whiny to actually bother.   Woah, personal attacks? I thought we were discussing why I thought voat was exclusionary and elitsts. Downvote me if you want but calling me names was unwarranted.  Ok, lets put it in some context. Look at your Reddit profile. From what I can see you have 7061 link karma, 43818 comment karma and your account is 1-2 years old. Whereas I have 15 link karma, 8670 comment karma and my account is 3-4 years old. Clearly you are far more active than I am on Reddit. But if my voting ability is based on how active I am, then clearly I shouldn't be allowed to downvote here as well. In fact, I probably wouldn't have bothered to make an account here in the first place.  My issue with voat isn't that the limits are 'pathetically low', it's that it's there in the first place. By having them there, it feels exclusionary and less open than Reddit by its very existence.  But sure, you go climb on your high horse and look down on us ""whiny"" people (which probably makes up the majority of casual Reddit users) if that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  Also, sorry about the edit you quoted. I was trying to make that statement a bit clearer."

RedditAlternatives,3d3k4s,tehdang,2,Sat Jul 18 07:21:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm, good point. I don't really care about using it, but it's about knowing I have the ability even if I don't actually want to use it. Remember that Reddit just feels more open because a new user has the same voting rights as one who is a veteran active member.  That also brings up another point. Ultimately in Reddit the points are meaningless. They're good for bragging rights and nothing more, they don't actually affect what you can or can't do. In Voat the points actually do matter, because they directly affect what you can do (downvoat) and how many times you can do it (10 upvoats per 24hrs). Whether these rules lead to a better forum is moot, doesn't change it's restrictive nature."
RedditAlternatives,3d3k4s,SisterPhister,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:49:27 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, I think being required to contribute to the conversation before you can down vote isn't all that bad. Typically you should contribute if you disagree, and only downvote spammers or awfully misleading/wrong information comments. This forces people to use words instead of just try to hide an opinion they don't agree with."
RedditAlternatives,3d3k4s,tehdang,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:57:03 2015 UTC,"I actually agree that from the standpoint of preventing brigading and forcing users to contribute that using such a system probably makes sense. And time may show that the quality of conversation posts in Voat may end up being superior than in Reddit. But I think that with such a restriction that Voat may never grow to the size that Reddit is today (short of Reddit making another catastrophic blunder) simply by virtue that the vast majority will go towards the path of least resistance. With Reddit, that means basically no restrictions at all and I for one prefer that system, trolls and shitty posts and all."
RedditAlternatives,3d3k4s,SisterPhister,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:57:37 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people will just upvoat and not comment. There are a ton of people who don't contribute to conversation on reddit, so why would that barrier bother them?  I do see your point, but I don't think it's as big of a barrier as you currently believe. There just aren't that many people who would be annoyed or discouraged by such a limitation when you think about the entire reddit userbase."
RedditAlternatives,3d3k4s,tehdang,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:10:27 2015 UTC,"Prehaps I'm overstating the problem. I admit that my first reaction when I first created an account on voat was ""I can't downvoat? Damn that's annoying. Wait, I can only upvoat 10 times per hour? Well bugger this!""  Only time will tell. I'd be interested to see how Voat goes in six months time."
RedditAlternatives,3d3k4s,btcprox,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:30:43 2015 UTC,"Interestingly I already can see certain side-effects of the feature restrictions pegged to your scores on Voat. There's been more than a few instances of users starting upvote party threads in order to gain downvoting ability, prompting discussion on how best to deal with these users trying to game the restriction system."
RedditAlternatives,3d3k4s,frankenmine,0,Wed Jul 15 23:35:41 2015 UTC,"Points are unfortunately not meaningless on reddit. Any comment pushed below -4 is invisible/hidden by default, and a coordinated downvote brigade by a handful of people or even one person using a bunch of botted accounts can easily change the tone of a thread by attacking certain viewpoints. Voat makes such attacks more difficult."
RedditAlternatives,3d3k4s,SisterPhister,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:59:24 2015 UTC,You're correct. I also think reddit has a post timer that is based on your karma. I might be wrong about that.
RedditAlternatives,3d3k4s,frankenmine,0,Fri Jul 17 18:23:33 2015 UTC,It's a bit more nuanced than that. It's subreddit-based. If you go beyond a certain downvotes/upvotes ratio or a downvotes/unit time ratio (not sure of the exact metric) your posts and comments in that subreddit are timed. This has no impact on any other subreddit.

You'll also run into a Catch 22 where people won't contribute till you can pay and you can't pay until you get a ton of people to contribute, get a ton of traffic.  And to that end, you haven't outlined a single reason why anyone should use the site, what it will do better than the hoard of ""me too"" discussion sites out there.

I thought this was an interesting segment:   I believe the best business model for community platforms like Reddit are those that offer moderators and the platform revenue-sharing opportunities. This is a third path to supporting communities being pioneered by companies like Teespring, Eventbrite and even GitHub. These new models reinforce the core values of a community like Reddit, and put the moderators at the center of the money-making engine.   Moderators do so much work for free, they deserve some reward for the success of their community."
RedditAlternatives,3d0tb4,18andover,8,Sun Jul 12 15:55:56 2015 UTC,"they deserve some reward for the success of their community.   They do if you look at it from the top down but from the bottom up it would create a lot of problems. In other words, people would be motivated to start and grow communities for financial gain and they'd be motivated to run them to maximize their profit.   Here are two problems that come quickly to mind:  Right now it's generally fine to link your sub in comments in other subs, to promote it. It's also generally fine to put 'x-post' in a title and submit to another sub. These would both almost certainly be seen as spam if mods got paid as they would be overused and people would view them as somebody trying to make money.  The second is that there would be a strong disincentive to add new mods, as you'd have to share the money. This would lead to worse moderation. It would also lead to mod coups where people would get culled so their money could get shared by the others etc.  So many more potential problems..."

When Digg went down, Reddit was already very large and well-established. So it was much easier to skip over to them.  There's more alternatives now, but none of such a scale, and none that are already that well-established.  Voat, probably the most promising in terms of how known it is, is still not all that well known, and has huge trouble keeping up with even the little bit of traffic it was sent.  While many say there was a mass-exodus of users to voat, in reality it was just a tiny percentage.  That said, if Reddit continues down their path of ignoring users, eventually it's not going to matter and people will simply abandon the site based upon it no longer being usable."

RedditAlternatives,3d2mkg,turkey_berzerky,2,Tue Jul 14 08:12:59 2015 UTC,"That's certainly the goal, but I think we've got a ways to go before releasing what I would consider a complete package.  While we've put a lot of work into the 'Reddit alternative' functionality, Qetzl is being developed as an alternative to other social networking and media sites that have had leadership, policy, or privacy issues.  The obvious part is the reddit alternative, but also an alternative to Yelp.  The way they push advertising and manipulate ratings is unacceptable in my views and wanted to provide something more honest.  So our poorly branded /places provides the opportunity to 'up vote' categories (currently food service only) and we provide a score based on the votes (the current functionality of this is terrible, but I'll be pushing out a new rating algorithm this week, already done in dev) and doesn't rely on someone's mood on the day they visited.  For example, there is a great sushi / teppanyaki place in my town that got a 1 star rating on yelp from someone only because their favorite manager wasn't working that day.    The final piece would be a facebook like function that keeps you as anonymous as you would like while being able to share these other features with people you connected with through the site.    Sure, this is a lofty goal and may never realize the tiniest fraction of users as reddit, yelp or facebook, but it's a great exercise to go through to sharpen my skills for other projects I'm working with."

I hadn't heard about Voat before the AMAgeddon, and now I know at least other 3 alternative sites and a new distributed iniciative based on the experimental Aether P2P.  (Just imagine if a group of competitors agree to form a redditlike network with shared subs, where messages censored by one site will still be posted in another. Even if they all agree to the same policies, competition will ensure they won't censor beyond reasonable limits).

My general thought is downvotes just give someone more options. Essentially without downvotes you have two: inaction and upvote. With downvotes you have three.

And it's an important conversation, as cyberbullying, doxxing, SWATting, online harassment, and all kinds of other bad behavior becomes just a fact of life in the digital age. But it's just not a conversation that a lot of people want to have, as evidenced by the massive backlashes on Reddit.  Reddit itself isn't the point: As we've already seen, many of the worst of the worst are moving to sites like Voat,  where they find a more permissive experience. Nothing about Reddit's site or technology is special; it's the community that gives it life, and communities can move elsewhere at will.  Incredibly he makes the story about death threats to Ellen Pao (didn't paste that because its an image between the paragraphs).  Death threats and mean people existed long before the internet.

And the subs I lurk in have so much useful information and engaging discussions.   I completely agree. I was lucky and was able to join Snapzu but that doesn't mean it will be my replacement. Reddit, for the most part, is a community I hope to be with for a while.   I feel Reddit would not have received the bulk of the hate if they had imposed a 3 strikes system or something instead of just blanket ban.   But no one knows the real specifics in regards to how this was all handled internally. What is known is that real-life people were harassed and some with death threat. The admin's response was justified and that they destroyed something that was vile and toxic. The problem lies in that people thought they could just make another sub and just keep going, but the admins needed to make a point and most of reddit agrees that it is not okay to have a mass organization of doxxing people.   My major contention with the company is the lack of transparency and the seemingly lack of communication with their users.   Which I find fascinating because I didn't know the reddit admins were a ""thing"" until a year after I joined. I would dare say most of reddit doesn't see their posts or for that matter cares. Since Reddit is a private company it leaves to be desired what they need to be transparent about. There are some things they are legally not allowed to show or talk about. Others are in gray areas and it is best served if you just do not go down that road.   I'm not a mod of any subreddit but I can empathize with the feeling of having a resource taken away from you abruptly with no transition period or anything and I'd have to put it on my top list of most frustrating things in the world.   I am a mod for 4 subreddits. This seriously only impacted the major ones. And it was not such a action that broke reddit itself. One subreddit stops working as designed due to this; however, the others are just gimped but can still do their day-to-day operations.  People are way~~ over reacting to this. While I understand the frustration from a certain stance, I also understand that people get complacent and think they are owed something."

I'm not exactly a fan of hate speech, but that label tends to turn into ""anything I don't like"".  e.g. I could see a subs like /r/ImGoingToHellForThis or /r/ShitRedditSays getting immediately shut down on Snapzu, regardless of whether or not they're hurting anyone."

RedditAlternatives,3cpd6h,joethebob,8,Fri Jul 10 04:34:01 2015 UTC,Snapzu is probably the best of the reddit alternatives so far.

RedditAlternatives,3cpd6h,PuffinTheMuffin,2,Fri Jul 10 23:56:34 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to find NSFW / Niche Content on that Site. They try to group things into Categories and only display what they want, you have no means of knowing if a Tribe that isn't displayed on those categories exist besides trying the name on the url.   This makes it really shit for those who use Reddit for Niche things like Manga / Anime / Unknown Games / Niche Communities and NSFW things.  It's search function is also terrible.  In other words, they censor / hide / make it difficult to find what they don't want to show, it's a even worse ""safe place"" than Reddit after Ellen Pao. Also because they only give attention to what is ""mainstream"" it becomes a website where you can't identify yourself with simply because it is too bland."
RedditAlternatives,3cpd6h,otarU,3,Fri Jul 10 02:16:28 2015 UTC,"I wasn't really aware that Manga and anime were niche things.   You don't have to use the categories, you can just view your tribes as a feed, pretty much in the same way I've been viewing reddit.  If there's any kind of content discovery tools on Reddit I guess I've just never seen it. So I can't really help there. I've either just searched for subs, or found them linked from another.   The reddit search function is also pretty terrible though.    I'm not really worried about places being a safe place or not."
RedditAlternatives,3cpd6h,otarU,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:30:47 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't like censorship, so I am against ""safe places"".  Manga might be niche, Anime not so much because it's so Mainstream lately.  But the communities of manga genres or a manga world or even less popular games / technologies are very niche.   Like for example /r/touhou or /r/kancolle or /r/TowerofGod /r/SteamVR /r/Gensokyo /r/JRPG /r/Dredmor   It might be a problem that Snapzu is not very popular right now, but it would be hard to find their tribes because there is no way to know that they exist besides using Search or trying to name a Tribe on the address bar.  For example on Reddit. I can click on ""My Subreddits"", then after that click on ""View All"" and it will show All Subreddits in order of activity. So I can know what Subreddits are the most active and then join whatever subreddit has what I like. So it is a very good discovery tool.  https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/  Also I see 0 NSFW content on Snapzu Frontpage, some time ago if you went on Reddit and browsed r/all you would see lots of NSFW posts on the frontpage simply because it attracts users and viewers. There has been a reduction on NSFW posts on /r/all , probably those NSFW subreddits opted out of appearing on All or Reddit Admins tried to make it a ""safer place"" by suggesting them to use the option of not appearing on all.   Anyways, when I tried Snapzu like 1 year ago, the thing that marked me the most was the lack of NSFW content on that Site. I saw some NSFW Tribes being created recently so I guess that could change, but it really feels different from Reddit and not like an alternative."

The referral plan is for growing your individual community. Yes, you get a share of 'credits' purchased when the credit system is launched, but it is not even clear yet what these will even be used for. If I was that desperate to earn a couple of dollars, there are far easier, quicker ways.   I don't really see how it's selling anyone out. If someone wants to join, they have ability to. There are absolutely no adverse effects of being referred by someone else (in fact, you can't join without being invited). The invites system also meant that the site did not suffer the same downtime issues as voat in the last week or so.  I use the site every day, so it's not like I'm just handing people over to some corporate entity and making off with the proceeds (on a side point, the admins all still have full-time jobs).

RedditAlternatives,3cq7gh,seanmadhavan,2,Fri Jul 10 11:38:43 2015 UTC,"It's pretty rad, but two main things bother me:   I don't get the navigation. I don't know what the significance of moving up, down, or to the sides mean, or why I can't keep moving in one direction after a while. Am I browsing a grid? Do different rows mean something? (I'll figure it out, I'm sure, but that kind of thing should be either explained or intuitive) The keyboard navigation is a good idea, but if my right hand is on a mouse, the arrow keys, or a cup of coffee, alphanumeric entries all need to be made with the left. C, E, N, and L are all over the keyboard on different rows. I would rather see one cluster on the left side.   For example: E, R, T, and D. Endorse, Read, Talk, Delay. The first three are actions to take on the content right now, and the fourth one is a different type of function (read later) and is on a different row. But they're all in one cluster, immediately above the little bump on your F key.  Or even A, S, D, F. Approve, Save, Discuss, and Fuck if I know dude, it's your website :)  Overall, love the aesthetic and that it's not a reddit clone. I like the idea of kind of flipping through a magazine and picking a bunch of articles to read, since that's kind of what I do on reddit anyway-- scroll down the front page and open a bunch of tabs.

RedditAlternatives,3cjhzg,mukt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:21:56 2015 UTC,I think you missed my point. Downvoting discourages unpopular views. That creates a hivemind. Mods don't have to do anything for that to happen.

The issues with reddit go far deeper than mods or administration, its a structural issue in which power is centralized between mods and admins (mods subjectively enforce rules and admins subjectively remove the free speech platform/enforce rules). One sole moderator controls one subreddit (top listed mod) but can control other subreddits as well, there is no power within the users of the subreddit to keep the same subreddit and get rid of shitty mods, etc. The list of issues is massive, and ellen pao is just one.  Voat already has all of these issues. It will not last nearly as long as reddit if it doesnt change."

RedditAlternatives,3cjhzg,BICEP2,5,Wed Jul 8 19:22:58 2015 UTC,They massively missed a huge opportunity here and its probably too late for Voat to grow into something bigger than reddit no matter what happens.  They had all the marketing and attention a small website could ever dream of and they buckled under the traffic. Sure they gained a few people but they will never get another oportunity as good as the last one.  By the time they have the website working reliably most people will have mostly forgotten about why they are mad at reddit and just not bother leaving.  This should be an important lesson to all the companies trying to compete against Facebook etc. Other than Google+ which is just another company selling out your privacy what good platform/website exists today that people could go to as a replacement?   If Facebook messed up and pissed a bunch of people off nobody would be in a position to capitalize on the exodus.
RedditAlternatives,3cjhzg,BICEP2,2,Wed Jul 8 16:25:07 2015 UTC,You think that will be the last time reddit pisses off its users? I wouldn't be so sure...
RedditAlternatives,3cjhzg,turkey_berzerky,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:37:23 2015 UTC,It made mainstream news as popular defaults went private for a day. They would have to mess up really really bad for that to happen again.

I agree it's not a 1:1 reddit alternative, but I don't think requiring donations is why, i think that's part of the ""something different"" in the sidebar.

RedditAlternatives,3cnxuj,Adam24,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:59:05 2015 UTC,"No one is going to join your site cause of the random donation model.  If one donates to a charity, they probably know and trust the charity they're donating to.  By making someone submit to a charity they haven't established trust with, they are more likely to go somewhere that cares more about free and open discussion than asking them to donate to have the ""honor"" of participating in a community.  Communities are open to anyone.  Yours is open to those that are ok with giving their hard earned money to a total stranger and there are not a lot of those types of people out there. I'm just warning you about the inevitable failure that will happen by going down this road.  Thanks."
RedditAlternatives,3cn8c6,teamli,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:35:24 2015 UTC,"From the FAQs.  Q: How does it work?  A: Every post is anonymous in the beginning. But if it gets enough likes, you can see who wrote it.   Q: How do I post?  A: Just click on the Big Plus Sign in the top right hand corner of the screen to create a new post. If you want to reply to a post, just click on the Reply button on that post.   Q: Why is there a little question mark below my post?  A: Any post that is anonymous has a question mark where the author should be. When the author is revealed, the author will replace the question mark.   Q: What is my Reveal Score?  A: Your Reveal Score tells you how often you are revealed. An author whose posts are revealed more often will have a higher score.   Q: Why did you make SaidWho?  A: We made SaidWho to make it easier to say things.    Listen to what is being said, not who is saying it  If you're shy, people will only know its you if they like what you say!"

It would be cool to entirely self-host, but I don't know that its practical to do so.  Obviously, this is just an outline with a lot of vagueness involved, but I'd like to get some feedback to refine the ideas behind the system before I start building anything.  The wampum paper definitely leaves a lot to be desired. It was originally conceived with a centralized system in mind, so it will probably have to be entirely rethought to work as a cryptocurrency.    I apologize for the ugly-ass website. I haven't managed to get around to any of the UI/UX work quite yet."

RedditAlternatives,3chvwa,raisin_reason,4,Wed Jul 8 01:06:05 2015 UTC,"I generally agree, but I had a slightly more negative take on it.  Pros:   Most of the features we've come to expect on Reddit (configurable frontpage, sub-topic pages, nested/collapsible comments, notifications, etc). Clean design, generally nicer to look at than Reddit. They could tighten up the spacing and make the text a little smaller though.   Cons:    Bitcoin stuff seems pointless and annoying. I don't care that I my comment earned me 1/10000000000000000th of a cent. Even if I were the most popular user on the site, in a 100 years I might earn $3. It's not even clear how I would ""cash"" that in as they don't expose the Bitcoin account info associated with that. Way too many notifications. Their equivalent of ""orangered"" shows you notifications for not just comments but votes as well and by who, and there doesn't seem to be any way to disable it. Even now, when the site's still small, those notifications get overwhelming. And since they're only shown with a lame Javascript-overlay, without a link or standalone page, it's difficult to browse through them. Not open source. Say what you will about Reddit, but all its code is open source, so you can start your own clone, as several people have. For all its talk about democracy and community, Empeopled is not only privately owned and operated, just like Reddit, but closed source as well. More restrictions on ""topics"" and moderation. The site will only cover a ""topic"" if it gets 400 upvotes, and even then the topic will be managed by moderators chosen by the site admins, not the users. So it's like Reddit if Reddit admins moderated everything, and didn't let you even create your own subreddits. That seems like a terrible idea. Reddit became popular by letting people do things themselves, not by curating a narrow subset of topics. Frontpage links don't link directly to the article, forcing you to click into the comments first. I'm not sure I like the idea of weighted votes combined with no ability to create your own topics. That sounds a recipe to re-create the Digg disaster, where a select few people become ""power-users"" who control the entire site. It's still early, and there's hardly anyone on the site yet to see how this will play out, but it seems like a mistake to me."
RedditAlternatives,3chvwa,TooSunny,3,Wed Jul 8 03:13:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you for replying. While I agree with some of your points, I would also like to point out a few things.   -Bitcoin. I think that the feature to cash it out is planned to come out sometime in the future. Plus, at the current price of Bitcoin, I have already earned somewhere around 15 cents in the past three days, being a fairly active member (hopefully my math isn't too off). I'm not sure if they will end up keeping the Bitcoin because I can see how it's possible to exploit it, but it doesn't seem like too terrible of an idea to me. We'll see.  -I completely agree with the notifications part. The biggest chunk, ""x and x users also commented on this post"", should be gone in the next couple of days according to the Vote Poll and to Aris, and the settings toggle mode is also promised to be released. Now, I have no clue if they will follow up on that, but they do seem to push out updated fairly quickly and regularly.  -I agree that Empeopled is not open source, and that's not something I like, but Reddit is not fully open source either. They have the bare bones open and some key parts (like the vote fuzzing mechanism) missing. You can't simply build your own Reddit which will look and behave the same with what is open. If you don't believe me, look  into it or correct me if I'm wrong, that also happens quite often.   -Topics. I'm actually not sure where I stand on this issue, because on one hand I think that we should avoid ""dead"" topics or subs being squatted, but on the other hand it does create a certain dependency on the administration. Frankly, I think I agree with you more than I disagree, and I hope that this will be something for the Empeopled community to vote upon and decide together.  -Frontpage links bother me too. I think I saw a post raising this same issue, not sure if there is a vote for it. It doesn't bother me too much though, more of a minor point."

RedditAlternatives,3chvwa,turkey_berzerky,2,Wed Jul 8 03:53:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think of all ""traditional"" alternatives, Voat is the only one that's also open source. The decentralized Aether and Frizbee are also open source, but they're currently unusable IMHO."
RedditAlternatives,3chvwa,TooSunny,2,Wed Jul 8 04:06:05 2015 UTC,The only part of Frizbee that's open source is the peer code. The central server code is not.

RedditAlternatives,3ck8o1,demirb,2,Wed Jul 8 15:45:49 2015 UTC,"Facebook advertises, for one. It is older & more established, for two. For three, the budgets that back FB or twitter are phenomenal, as is their staff strength. Voat, the biggest reddit alternative AFAIK, has only three contributors (can't even call them staff - no salaries on card yet)!    Can you imagine what kind of outages voat is hving with two weeks of non-stop DDoS attacks and only three programmers handling it day and night? Couple that with sudden influx of half a million users (they had only 7000 users 3 months back) and you get the picture - reddit alternatives are minnows and do not stand competition with mainstream networks like FB."
RedditAlternatives,3ck8o1,mukt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:14:43 2015 UTC,Half a million? Who said they have that many!?
RedditAlternatives,3ck8o1,kiwikku,2,Wed Jul 8 22:21:52 2015 UTC,its actually 700k LOL
RedditAlternatives,3ck8o1,Anonman9,2,Wed Jul 8 23:12:56 2015 UTC,"part of the problem is that developers are having a hard time making a product that is feature packed, but also easy to use.   reddit is so easy to use. just start typing and hit reply. making an account takes 10 seconds and doesnt even require verification. that alone hooks a lot of otherwise computer illiterate people in.   however, reddit is limited to posting text and links...granted, that is all most people need, but there is a lot of benefit to other features...those features may be complex to use, or may have intricate settings that have to be configured.   the trick is blending these two together. either by making a great UI to make complex things simple, or by having a basic user/power user mode that offers the best of both to everyone."

RedditAlternatives,3ci8on,capn_krunk,0,Wed Jul 8 14:37:54 2015 UTC,I do know the devs behind Commentum recently just made a huge upgrade to their servers and said they're ready for some serious traffic.
RedditAlternatives,3ci8on,kiwikku,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:38:55 2015 UTC,"Bheda, thanks for sticking up for us new kids on the block. People aren't realizing or remembering that Voat has been around for a while, and that we've been writing and hosting our site for only one week yesterday.  I'm absolutely certain Voat is getting hit harder than we are, and while we've run some load tests and feel confident that we could handle an influx of a pretty good amount of users, we really don't know if we could handle Voat's traffic.Like the other guy says, we simply can't know, because we don't know those kinds of things about them.  You are correct that we did upgrade our servers quite heavily during our first influx of users. Anyway, I just wanted to clarify. We're working really hard at improving our platform and we are ready for a decent amount of traffic."
RedditAlternatives,3ci8on,capn_krunk,2,Wed Jul 8 14:26:23 2015 UTC,I really feel that we need a RAA- reddit alternative alliance. Too many people are creating too many splinter communities instead of working together to create a single great experience. https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAlternatives/comments/3c4jr7/we_need_a_raa_reddit_alternative_alliance_heres/
RedditAlternatives,3ci8on,kiwikku,2,Wed Jul 8 22:31:55 2015 UTC,"I think that's a nice idea -- the big issue you're going to have there is that it's too late. As you said, there are already a lot of splinter communities. People aren't just going to scrap their work to start over on some new idealistic vision, even if that may be the right way to go.  The other issue is that people have different ideas and different implementations. Doing what you speak of is by no means impossible, and if someone does it, more power to them! I'm just trying to say that organizing, coordinating, and delivering such a thing is going to be a monumental challenge. It's not all cake.  We, as 3 developers who get along quite well, even have disagreements from time to time. Imagine 30, or 300.  Again, it's a nice idea, and by no means impossible. It's just unlikely that such a project will succeed, in my opinion.  EDIT: Not to mention, no one can deliver a single, great experience, because everybody's opinion on that is going to be different. We don't plan to please everyone (though we'd love to), we just want to offer what we and our community think will be a great experience. Take it or leave it, that's really all we can do."
RedditAlternatives,3ci8on,capn_krunk,0,Thu Jul 9 00:04:54 2015 UTC,"That's very true.. Which is why the other idea was a way where you could use your login in one alternative to sign into all the others, and kind of ""connect"" your accounts."

This is one of the three devs from Commentum. We're working very hard to improve our platform and to release new features and functionality.  As for the ""emptiness"" of the site -- well, again, we're only a week old.  If you have some real criticism with some level of constructiveness, we're all ears."
RedditAlternatives,3ci8on,capn_krunk,2,Wed Jul 8 14:29:25 2015 UTC,Get a few bots to repost content from reddit.
RedditAlternatives,3ci8on,kiwikku,2,Wed Jul 8 22:29:53 2015 UTC,"We're more focused on finishing the core functionality. The site is lacking a few more very important features at this point. We already have a loyal following and many people like what they see. Google Analytics shows this in the amount of people who are returning day after day (also evident just by being around in our community).  So, we'd rather be concentrating on finishing the core functionality, making it all function very well. We plan to have this done by next week.  I think the community will fill itself up as time goes on (it's already begun doing this, and we're only a week old). Once the core functionality is done, we have lots of plans for features that not a single other platform out there currently implements in any way.  Within 2-3 weeks, I think that the site itself will have much more to offer than any other alternative. I think the community itself will do its part on its own, especially once given the proper tools and features.  Although we are a Reddit alternative, I'd also like to take this chance to state that we don't intend or plan to replace Reddit, Voat, or any other platform. We're simply an alternative. Some people will like us, some will not. Either way, we plan to continue our efforts and to keep on working with our community to create the best possible experience for everybody involved.  Thank you for the reply!"

I'd imagine you could get something functioning for in the ballpark of $500-2000. But you're always going to want changes and updates and those will add up to a lot over time. Really the right person to build an alternative is one who can do it themselves. Or a team of people where (at least) one can do the coding.

I would rather see users have the ability to filter their own content, or at least have the option to subscribe to moderation, perhaps with different moderation choices available. for example, imagine if a major sub didnt have just one list of moderators...but if users could simply choose to moderate the content, without needing permission from a sub owner,...and then users could just check and uncheck which moderators they wanted to have their mod actions applied to their feed. also moderation needs to be transparant...again because of abuse."

A ""reddit alternative"" is a very broad concept because reddit itself is a very broad thing. The site is more than just subreddits and upvotes and downvotes. You could say that the meta-reddit is extraordinarily large. So you will find people here looking for subreddit systems, voting, content aggregation, similar communities, etc. And I think they all have a place because there is more to reddit than just its core functions. People want to find sites that share the things that makes/made reddit great for them."

RedditAlternatives,3c9ot6,PuffinTheMuffin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:03:57 2015 UTC,"I would only do three things, and that's it.    Decrease the post size to at least fit 5-6 posts on a page at once. They can keep the current size for mobile with media queries.  Fix the text size.  Get rid of the bold styled text.    Now that I look at it, the bold text is the biggest problem I can see. Bold text isn't for titles or even for something important. The only purpose for bold text is to direct the eye. Bold text says, ""Look here!"". When you have too much of it everything just looks angry and overwhelming.   I can understand that maybe the creators are using it because the titles to posts are important. But the main content on the front page is the titles, so it's really pointless. That reminds me of another rule, when everything is important, nothing is.  [edit] A good example of a good interface is Reddit right here. This is how a good interface is made, it's all about usability. I believe whether they know it or not Reddit made use of subtraction in their design. They removed everything that wasn't 100% necessary, and the benefit is that everyone just gets it. Too often young designers try to make something that looks cool and forget that the whole point is for people to use it and understand it."

RedditAlternatives,3c7z0q,xuqz,2,Sun Jul 5 19:48:37 2015 UTC,How does this compare to http://getaether.net/?
RedditAlternatives,3c7z0q,UnibannedY,3,Sun Jul 5 22:28:25 2015 UTC,"This project aims to have cryptographic authentication. AFAIK, Aether does not support certificates. Additionally:   In addition to the basic ruleset, Aether does not at all have privileged users such as moderators or admins to allow for manual moderation, therefore all judgment you face comes expressly from your peers. This is what “community moderated” means.   Moderation has been an important part of reddit. A ""community moderated"" board might as well become an unmoderated board, where trolls and vote brigaders can ruin a site in little to no time. (Take the incidents in /r/atheism a couple of years ago, for example, where the sub got unmoderated after a rogue mod was put in place, and chaos ensued).  Anonymity vs. Pseudonymity:  In Aether:   Moreover, even Alex, who directly receives the message from Rachel, does not know whether Rachel is the source of posts with the pseudonym “Rachel.” Rachel might have taken that post from someone else, also using the same pseudonym. In fact, anyone can change their pseudonym to Rachel, post something, and switch back. Only Rachel knows if she has written that post or not, but even she cannot prove she indeed has. More importantly, neither can anyone else.   (If you allow me to get a bit more pedantic, I'd note that in cryptography matters, one should use the names ""Alice"" (A) and ""Bob"" (B); if a third participant is there, it should be named ""Charles"" (C). An Eavesdropper should be named ""Eve"", and so on. See the wikipedia page on ""Alice and Bob"" for more details.)  Secondly, I don't think anonymous forums is what we want in here. If you doubt me, you can go to 4chan and browse /v/ for a while. My goal is to use pseudonymity, where you can have a fictitious name, but that ficticious name has a reputation to keep. That's what karma points, trophies and flairs are all about. You can't really know if the Alice that posts today is the same Alice that posted yesterday, unless you know Alice's original Public Key Certificate (a.k.a. ID).  When you upvote a person, you're not only upvoting their posts/replies, you're also upvoting their online persona.  Since Aether has no pseudonymity, you can't keep track of the long-term record of a user. I'm planning for this.  Controlled Anonymity (with plausible deniability): My protocol will have limited throwaway tokens granted by the moderator to the subscribers. A token would be nothing but a temporary public key certificate which the subscriber can use to post anonymous replies on a certain post.  Let's say we have a moderator. There's no convention for moderators that we know of, so let's call him ""Moe"". Moe has signed mid-term certificates for his subscribers, and later, signs long-term certificates for them to ensure their trust.  1) Alice, a long time user of Moe's forum, signs a certificate request for a throwaway. Additionally, she attaches (non-signed) the request for the name ""Annie"" (for Anonymous).  2) Moe (or his forum software, automatedly) receives the request, and grants the token to Alice, both public and private keys, and signs it with his moderator authority. Thus, Annie is born, and will probably disappear in a few days, depending on the expiration date of the certificate.  3) ""Annie"", now certified by Moe to be a participant of the forum, decides to post a rather rude comment, which Alice would never do.  From here, two things can happen: 4.A) Annie's comment turns out to be quite insightful, so her comment gets upvoted and earns lots of sweet karma. So alice decides to break anonymity, and so she certificates Annie's public key, and then certifies this packet with Annie's private key (the exact mechanism might be a bit different, but this is more or less the gist of it). This ties the two identities, and from now on, all replies posted by Annie have Alice as their verified author.  4.B) Annie's comment turns out to be hideous, and gets downvoted to oblivion. Alice decides to get rid of Annie's private certificate, and so, deletes it. Nobody can know that Annie was Alice all along (except Moe).  5) Let's suppose Alice has posted bad comment after bad comment. Moe checks using his authority, and decides that Alice is a persona non-grata. So he has two different routes to take:  5.A) he issues a revocation certificate against Alice, declaring her as ""Banned"".   6.A) The Servers receive both Alice's further posts and replies, and also, Moe's revocation certificate against Alice. Then, they attach the banning certificate and attach it to every further post made by Alice.   7.A) The Clients decide to ignore banned users, so they only download posts not marked as ""banned"".  OR:  5.B) Moe decides Alice is a bad anonymous user. So he stops issuing throwaway tokens to her. Alice is forced to use her public identity for further comments. Comments whose reputation will follow Alice until she gets rid of her public ID.  So what happens if Moe outs Alice as Annie? He can't. Alice never acknowledged receiving the token from Moe. So all we can know is that he handed out ONE throwaway token, but not to whom. Since the request for the name ""Annie"" was never signed by her, Moe can't prove a thing. Furthermore, people will cut ties with Moe for outing Alice, and probably FORK (another feature I have planned) his forum. Moe will be left alone, while everybody else goes to the new forum."

The work could be distributed by breaking up the data sets, distributing the processing, or using different technology (as you are apparently alluding, I believe).

MySQL is famous for not having most data integrity features at all (at least until they made InnoDB the default table type).  All of the robust, mature SQL databases provide extensive tuning options. They may not be easy to tune to satisfaction for a layperson, but for a professional DBA there is very little limit in the kind of performance that can be delivered. In corporate usage, some of the largest databases in the world run on Oracle or better SQL engines. Performance is not a limitation they suffer, although the extensive knowledge required to achieve it sometimes can be a significant flaw. And not one that's likely to be fixed anytime soon.  Non-relational databases are much better at that, by operating at a lower abstraction level and taking away a lot of the shortcuts you can take, they ironically make some of the performance decisions that need to be made a lot clearer and more obvious. Kind of like hand-coded assembly vs C. But that's not the limiting factor. Relational databases provide you all the tools you need to create a high performance database, you just need to know what you're doing."

Java 1.5 projects compile just fine using the 1.8 JDK, but not so with .net.  The language itself (C#)  is very nice, I'm just not a fan of how Microsoft handles the whole .net platform sometimes.  It negatively affects maintainability.  But given the choice, independent of other considerations, I'd rather develop in c# than anything else."

RedditAlternatives,3c5652,TheHobbitsGiblets,5,Sun Jul 5 02:12:22 2015 UTC,"Well, if you intend to run a highly trafficked website a la Reddit, you need ongoing money for servers and staff.  An initial Kickstarter might generate enough funds to get up and running in the beginning but after than you're going to need more to keep going.  So the choices are:   Keep it free and sell advertising Ask for donations and hope that enough comes in to cover all your costs Make it a monthly $$ subscription model or some variation thereof   Regardless you're gonna need the green"
RedditAlternatives,3c5652,lynxz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:13:27 2015 UTC,"I launched a new site a few months ago to add another option for generating funds. It's a twist on the donation model and brings in accountability to the company to make improvements.  The basic idea is that the users say ""We want this"" (e.g. Voat - we want to have a contest mode that hides scores and randomizes comment order) and promise money towards it. If the company likes the idea, they can set a target and people can start paying. If enough is raised, they (contractually) have to follow through and they don't get paid until it's implemented and approved by the people who funded it.  This allows for ongoing crowdfunded donations that isn't just people throwing money into a hole, but actually getting updates wanted by the community implemented as well."

RedditAlternatives,3c5652,beyond1,2,Sun Jul 5 02:15:33 2015 UTC,Venture capitalists want return on their investments. No money = no support. So voat would just be in the same situation as reddit is now.

RedditAlternatives,3c8bg4,jhayes88,3,Mon Jul 6 03:07:21 2015 UTC,I'm one of the two developers for the site and thanks for the compliments! The site is Ruby on Rails+Javascript with a Postgres DB all hosted on  cloud based infrastructure that we can dynamically scale.(edited: cause words are hard)
RedditAlternatives,3c8bg4,Shuma665,2,Mon Jul 6 03:23:43 2015 UTC,"No problem. And that's awesome. I'm a PHP/MySQL dev myself. Tried learning Ruby a few years ago. I think had I not learned PHP, it would have been easier for me. Your site is exactly what I was thinking about building. I already have the functionality down(temporary url/name and temporary theme http://shreddit.ninja/ ). I'm on the boder as to whether I should continue on it or give up. Your site makes me want to give up. Your theme closely resembles Reddit but not too closely(which is a good thing), and it offers a great modern style almost similar to snapzu.com. If your site was written in PHP i'd be putting in a developer application to you lol. A lot of people really seem to like the dark theme integrated with RES and Voat(if you log into Voat when its opened, you can change it to dark). Do you have any plans to make a dark theme? Also, I seen an interesting suggestion a couple days ago about integrating an IRC web chat feature into each subreddit/topic/group/WhateverYouCallIt. Would that be something you guys might consider in the future? Also, one more thing about your site. I run a decently fast computer on a 120mbps internet line, using Google chrome, and the site seems to load slow for me. From a developer point of view, it seems like it's being caused by the AJAX loading functionality. Not 100% sure though. When I load a page, half of it will load and it will sit for 3-6 seconds to wait for the rest of the content to appear. I feel as if that's the biggest drawback on your site. Also have you thought about creating an option to allow users to expand the site a little wider? And also reducing the header size a little? The header size is too large in my opinion. Such as this(quick concept I created in dev tools in 1min)  http://imgur.com/a/XmxKb"
RedditAlternatives,3c8bg4,jhayes88,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:43:01 2015 UTC,If you sign up there is no header and you can actually build a taste profile and be given a personalized feed.   If you just lurk the front page is ok but you're really missing out on what makes it not a clone.   To answer some of your other questions. * Themes are planned but other features are higher in priority.  * Ruby is a great language and rails is a great frameworks for doing web applications.  My co-developer also came from a PHP backgrounds. * The delay on large monitors is due to pagination basically your high res allowed you to load one full page and then another.  So effectively you have two pages loaded.   3-6 seconds is pretty bad though I'll check our logs and see how through put is doing sounds like we might need to scale up another web dyno or missing an index on the db.
RedditAlternatives,3c8bg4,Shuma665,2,Mon Jul 6 21:24:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the reply. And i'll definitely look more into it. That makes sense. Thanks for clarifying.

RedditAlternatives,3c8bg4,jhayes88,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:15:49 2015 UTC,You know what I also live in a dark theme in my IDE so i can't argue your logic there.  I'll get it higher up on the todo list!   BTW check out the unauthenticated front page.  I think i'll like the size of the header now ;)

RedditAlternatives,3c6nrq,leetnewb,4,Sun Jul 5 10:01:30 2015 UTC,"The problem is that even if someone launches a viable reddit alternative that eventually gains traction, and even if the owner(s) say they will never give in to VC or other commercial interests, it becomes pretty hard to stick to that promise when your bandwidth and hosting bills are coming in at $20k a month and your users are deserting you because your website has scalability problems.   The only way to break the cycle in my opinion is to have a Wikipedia -> Wikimedia Foundation-style setup where it's registered as a non-profit organisation, or to raise funds via kickstarter/direct donations rather than on-page advertising. Or maybe some sort of 'charter' to never sell, which is legally ratified. Whether that will work or not, I don't know."

RedditAlternatives,3c3od6,kiwikku,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:40:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If they were hosting purely static content, it would be that simple. But their site is not static. Synchronizing all those posts and comments across a data store that's used by dozens, or even hundreds, of servers is no trivial feat."
RedditAlternatives,3c3od6,jtansley,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:54:42 2015 UTC,Try 3tags.They have scalable server structures and stand 500k visitors already in the past. (as an article got viral)

RedditAlternatives,3c3mgh,walt_ua,0,Sat Jul 4 17:02:29 2015 UTC,same.  You can't just go there and create a new Topic.  On snapzu you can.
RedditAlternatives,3c3mgh,walt_ua,5,Sat Jul 4 18:43:14 2015 UTC,"What's putting me off of Snapzu is that it's invite only at the moment.

RedditAlternatives,3c3mgh,walt_ua,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:18:53 2015 UTC,"I think it looks pretty but that's the only good thing I can really think of saying about it. I've not really bothered to really explore the site to the fullest because I really dislike waiting to get invited to something that I can't get a decent feel of unless I have an account.   So far, I'm leaning towards a mix of Hubski (no upvote system seems cool, tags seems like a good idea, looks nice) and Empeopled (looks nice, really like the democratic way they're doing things, bitcoin incentive seems like a fun idea despite me thinking it won't really amount to anything but it suffers from severe clutter at the moment)."

RedditAlternatives,3c3mgh,walt_ua,2,Sat Jul 4 20:20:35 2015 UTC,"As far as I know you're mostly right about Hubski (not trying to knock down the site, its system is just different). About Empeopled, like I said in another comment, the site definitely does have a subreddit-like system called ""topics"", even though it may not be so evident at first. The difference is that you have to get them voted on and approved, which is, actually, proving quite effective at maintaining some degree of quality content and activity on the site."
RedditAlternatives,3c3mgh,WorrywartSpoonguy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:33:32 2015 UTC,"Right, but there are no designated users, like mods of sorts, who take care of what's being posted under these banners.  I just feel more comfortable with the 'classic' subreddit system."

We will vote on all major issues and even vote on moderators, topics (subreddits) and how the funds for the site are spent! How cool is that? How many sites actually let the users drive the community, rather than telling them what they can and cannot do."

RedditAlternatives,3c3mgh,lynxz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:11:50 2015 UTC,I'm loving snapzu immensely.  The whole site kinda reminds me of truereddit but in a good way.  I've got a good number of invites if anyone's interested.
RedditAlternatives,3c3mgh,Auutumnal,8,Sun Jul 5 00:29:52 2015 UTC,"I'm using Snapzu for discussion and media, with Newsvine as a backup for, well, news. Empeopled seems cool, too, though I'm not sure how much time I'll spend there. I may also give Linkibl and Stacksity a shot."
RedditAlternatives,3c3mgh,blue_arrow_comment,19,Sun Jul 5 00:28:59 2015 UTC,"I voted for Empeopled. I'm still getting the hang of the place (haven't even registered yet) so please excuse some errors or misinformation.  Pros:   For me, its biggest draw is the fact that you can vote on changes to the site (like, for example, changes to rules, to how moderation works, etc. You can check out the ones voted on so far here), which means you have a significant role in defining the direction the site takes. The creator is also very active and says that he is not afraid of experimenting and failing, which, coupled with the point above, can only be beneficial to shaping the site into something potentially better. At least it helps to throw ideas around, implementing them and see what works and what doesn't. The community is, from what I gather, made up mostly of redditors and is actually pretty laid-back and engaged. Expect some silliness and joking around (and some dank memes) but not the ridiculously stupid pun-threads that permeated the default subs. But since everything is fairly new, everyone seems to be very interested in actively participating in every aspect of the site. The layout is great and one of the best out of all the alternatives I've tried. It's not flashy, it's fairly simple to navigate since the threads on the frontpage are displayed in a list-type layout, and you have a menu with options on the top-left side of the screen. The size of the fonts are quite big (I suppose the reason is so the site doesn't feel too empty and with too much white space), though, but this is more of a nit-pick anyway, as you'll get the hang of it fairly fast.   These aren't exactly cons but rather things that were a bit more hard to understand and get behind (I'm also planning on asking about these when I eventually register there):   The upvote/downvote system involves bitcoin in the sense that, when you upvote someone's comment or post that person gets 1 sBTC (or you if someone does the same to your post and/or comments). Now, a sBTC unit is a negligible amount of money (as seen here but if the site grows there's a possibility it can be abused. But right now, I guess it serves more of a draw towards the site and an incentive to keep participating which makes sense but it needs to be addressed if it gets more popular. I'm not sure how this works but the more upvotes you get on a thread, the more power you have on that thread, meaning that, for example, your upvotes are worth 2x more than a regular upvote (more here under the sections ""What are 'Decibel Levels'? How do they work?"" and ""What happens when I gain a Decibel Level?""), which can be (potentially) abused. Then again, you can vote to remove it or change it, I guess. Another thing that makes sense considering the size of the userbase but can be problematic if you want to create communities devoted to specific, if not very popular, interests - which is one of the main advantages, for me, of reddit - is the fact that, IIRC, you need a ""subreddit"" (or topic as it's called there) to get voted on and approved by the userbase. According to the creator it's to prevent the proliferation of inactive or barely-active topics so it could be changed at some point in the future.   Can't remember any other particular problems or benefits over reddit and other alternatives floating around. But still, out of the alternatives, I feel it's the one with the biggest potential to grow as it's unique enough to stand on its own and it tries to give more power to its users in an interesting and often-thought-but-almost-never-executed kind of way.  TL;DR: Users vote on major changes, interesting experiment in quasi self-governance. Try it out at least. If it doesn't work out you won't lose anything anyway.  EDIT: Some resources you'll probably find useful:   The FAQ Some tips and tricks General guide Since some people assumed there was no subdreddit-like system, there is and it's here Also to those who were taking issue with the layout here are some themes: Empeopled Slim - A Stylish theme. It's a userstyle so it needs the Stylish add-on to work. As does Empeopled Night Mode. Links to each userstyle page are here and here. The creator of the last one is also working on a Chrome extension (which will then probably ported to Firefox).   EDIT 2: Regarding comments:   There is a restriction on the amount of comments you can post and this restriction is directly tied to your user level. The higher it is, the more you can post. I'm not sure about the concrete numbers but they're probably going to change it to something less aggressive (words from the developer ""I think we should tweak the algorithm a little bit, it seems to be too aggressive."". Unfortunately, it doesn't allow me to link directly to comments so you'll have to search in there). With that said, don't be discouraged from visiting the site. I, for one, never had any problems with that. And again, they'll be making some changes to comply with the users will. Also, check out the AmA (yeah, I know, not very original) thread that one of the founders held and is currently holding, intermittently."

Originally they had it so anyone could make a topic, but the site was flooded with topics that lead to a lot of inactive communities rather than a big active one. With reddit's userbase it makes sense to have r/hiking, r/outdoors, r/naturepics, etc. but on Empeopled there are few enough people that niche things don't get burried, and just /t/outdoors is plenty. When there are more users it will probably become possible to make a topic whenever you want."

Anyway, you can disable the sound effects and animations on your account settings. As for the user level points, I'm not 100% sure, but they are actually important for voting on topics' approval or proposals related to the site and community because the more you have, the more votes you'll get.

But, again, I don't know much about it and your best bet will be to either ask there or read faq, namely the ""What is Empeopled?"", ""How does Empeopled work?"" , ""How much is each up-vote worth?"" and ""How do commissions work?"" sections.

RedditAlternatives,3c3mgh,shoutwire2007,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:48:02 2015 UTC,"First: beware self-selecting polls. They're useful for gathering options. They're not a substitute for random sampling to judge actual interest and use.  I have to admit I'm not familiar with most of the options shown, though I've heard of Voat.  While it's not all that similar to reddit in general structure, I've been impressed with Ello on the following points:   Management's stated goals and structuring of the firm as a B Corp are both novel and quite encouraging. The basic framework of the site as I've been able to see it is generally encouraging. No, I'm not the biggest fan of the styling myself, but the HTML and CSS are both really clean, and suggest that other mechanics are similarly well-engineered. That's encouraging. The site is trivially skinnable and stylable. Data may be exported via JSON file. htts://ello.co/yourusername.json provides a dump not only of all your posts, but comments and other metadata. (I'd have to check about images). This means you've got data liberation at all times. Liberal NSFW tolerance party. The support pages are ""WTF"", as in, what the fuck. The management and engineering teams have been quite receptive to feedback from users, and are implementing and tweaking the site in a way that shows a very flexible and open approach. I've made a number of long (and occasionally ranty) posts. They've frequently been responded to. A surprising number of features have been, or are scheduled to be, implemented. Really good Notifications system. Ubiquitous HTTPS. ""Communities"" as accounts to which curated submissions may be offered. Existing / recent/ upcoming features of interest: Markdown support, native image support, ubiquitous embeds (video, audio, codepen, bandcamp, ...), iOS app (exists), Android (forthcoming), API (forthcoming), syndication, inbound and outbound (forthcoming).   It's not perfect:   There's limited spam controls. Not a big problem to date, though I've found a couple of large spam profile networks on the site. No threaded comments. Comment order is last-first. No private messages. No initegrated wiki. No RSS/Atom support (though I've heard encouraging noises). Limited privacy and abuse controls.   Not a perfect match, but interesting, particularly for those interested in longer-form posts.  My Ello profile FWIW: https://ello.co/dredmorbius"

RedditAlternatives,3c3mgh,turkey_berzerky,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:59:23 2015 UTC,"That's definitely how it's been positioned by a lot of third-party sources. My own view is that Ello is what you make it, and it's at an early enough stage of development that it could go a bunch of ways.  That said, the general support for long-form informed posts (Markdown really changes a forum's capabilities) makes it something more. @mooses at Ello has sugested media hub as a description rather than ""social network"".  What I'm looking for, and what my Lair of the Id here is, isn't really stock Reddit either. But somewhere between blog, aggregator, social site, and Wiki is what I've been looking for. Reddit's hit a lot of those points, some better than others. But the whole Pao situation is making me question my time here.  The fact that my own ownership of my subreddit (which is pretty explicitly just me) isn't recognized by Reddit's policies, and that I cannot readily extract my content, weigh on me too."

RedditAlternatives,3c3mgh,lynxz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:03:43 2015 UTC,"I think moving to voat.co will end up just the same as reddit with sub reddits having moderator cliques and political beliefs being pushed on people that don't conform.  I've already experienced voat admin cliques.  Really I just want a place to talk with people where I'm not going to be banned, or shadow banned, censored, voted down so I have to post on a timer, and where most people are rational enough to accept differing opinions. Oh ya and I can shit post without having to suffer through 4chan's child porn threads deleting crap and Something Awful's SJW lean.  Personally I choose www.tribalwar.com/forums It's a good backup and supplement to Reddit. It used to be one of the largest forums on the internet, uses a bulletin board style board, is no censorship unless it's illegal or unlinked and tagged pornography, is pro free speech with little moderation, and is 15 years old. There isn't a big political, philosophical, etc, governing bias and you can say, agree, disagree, argue, fight, or troll whoever you want.  These guys put goat.se on CNN.com for 2 hours when CNN hot linked an image of TW's in a news article.  Here's their wikipedia entry if you've never heard of them before. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TribalWar  Unless other websites and the consumer take the same pro democratic approach to discussion forums as Tribalwar.com's instead of just being news aggregate sites with comments or biased group thinks then there really won't be anything to move on to anyway."

RedditAlternatives,3c2xsw,DrPepper_1885,13,Sat Jul 4 06:51:35 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that people forget about Usenet as that they forget why it died.[1]  First off: I'm an old fart. Not as old as some, but I've been on the Internet since the mid-1980s. Including old-school Usenet. I've also been kicking around concepts for online discussions for quite some time (including helping design and working on a number of online forums and communities). I've been poking at a few of the major Usenet old-timers for details and stats as well.  A few key points...  There has been a Usnet 2.0, or rather, Usenet II  The principle crew were the steering committee (Todd McComb, Russell Nelson, Odd Einar Aurbakken, Peter da Silva, Ron Echeverri, and Russ Allbery), most of whom are still active in various tech circles (I know da Silva from his G+ profile, and we've disussed this a few times, and the czars.  The Wikipedia Usenet II article has a brief synopsis.  Among other elements, the proposal banned all non-text formats. Including HTML.  Though the service remains nominally operational, its' seen little use.  The original Usenet was small and had very limited access  Hard numbers are all but impossible to find. I traded some emails with Gene Spafford a few months back where we both felt that 50k-500k users was probably a reasonable approximation. And they were largely limited to selective universities and colleges, a few major tech firms, selected government departments, and research centers. While it wasn't impossible for the general public to gain access, you really had to want to. Intentionality, to borrow a more recently popular term, was high. More on stats here. Notably:   The 1995 top 40 newgroups stats estimated 623,532 readers worldwide in the largest newsgroup, news.announce.newusers   TLSoft via Internet Archive.  Peter da Silva notes (at the G+ link):   The user base in 1990 was low enough that one month (August I think) I was the #1 poster on Usenet... and I was also the #3 poster under another account.   Usenet had little to no archival, filtering, or spam protections  In some ways it was Twitter, based on topics, with longer posts. There were ample spam countermeasures put in place over time, but they were only marginally useful. ""Usenet kook"" and ""Usenet flame war"" are terms that exist for reasons...  The temporality of Usenet meant that those with _ access to archives, or searchable feeds, and those who _had were either notable or raised concerns. James ""Kibo"" Parry was one of the first people in the world with a username-mention-notification capacity, which all but spawned a religion, kibology. Dejanews, now Google Groups, was among the first public searchable Usenet archives. The idea that random 4am ramblings might be preserved for all time, raised concerns over privacy.  The ultimate sanction was the Usenet Death Penalty, but, with ready access to new hosts and userids, enforcing that was limited for a dedicated attacker. It was more successful against major consumer providers: UUNET, CompuServe, and Excite@Home.  Also hellbanning, a precursor to today's shadowbanning.  Usenet had many useful features   Client independence. Multiple front-ends. Decentralized service. Threaded discussions. Standardized message format and metadata. Moderated newsgroups User-implementable filtering capabilities: ""killfiles"".   ...and failings   Message composition and quoting style were enforced only by tradition and convention. Usenet quoting in particular was highly contentious. No inherent security model. Spoofing of users, content, and other factors was possible. While GPG-signed content could be used, there was no formal support. Limited (though not impossible) anonymity. Messages contained a full path to the Usenet peer from which it was provided. The ability to post anonymously was both somewhat complex (much as current VPN or Tor access is) and yet, not so hard to configure that spammers or abusers couldn't make use of it. Behavioral issues. If it exists on Web-based services, it existed on Usenet. Highly limited message formatting capabilities. With a strong preference for ASCII-formatted messages, neither advanced typography nor internationalization and language support were reliable. Yes, uuencoded binaries could be attached, but that was at best a hack.   Eternal September  The final nail, though it was a slow death, was the Eternal September. Usenet's reliance on culture, especially netiquette, simply couldn't keep pace with the flood of new users, most especially from AOL. The ""September effect"" referred to the annual influx of new users at the start of the academic year, but its scale relative to established users was such that social mechanisms: FAQs, LARTs, admonishments, and leading by example, were sufficient to assimilate new users. The problem remains a significant one.  I've kicked around ideas for a modern federated content system  See: ""What would be required for an SNML/SNTP federated content system?.  There are a number of elements I see as varying levels of esential or highly desirable:   A decentralized system Client independence A defined basic object set: users, posts, dates, events, messages, lists. Possibly more. Content and objects have metadata. Standardized, simple, extensible markup. Markdown or other lightweight markup languages. For scientific and technical discussions, some form of LaTeX support, at least to the extent of equations. A store-and-forward distribution model. Integrated crypto and authentication. Search, discovery (content, people, discussions), and promotion. Curation. Expiry Effective spam and abuse mitigation. Collaborative / federated content modertion. The ability to rate quality on multiple axes, and to give weight to specific users' ratings (getting around various ""popular but wrong"" issues).   And more (see the link).  Related: Content rating, moderation, and ranking systems: some non-brief thoughts.  Usenet is a useful model and reference, but not a solution  There's definitely a lot to be learned from Usenet, and it's quite instructive.  Of itself, however, Usenet isn't a workable model for today's Internet, either on the basis of scale or capabilities. Even its suggested successors are wanting.    Notes   Yes, Usenet still exists, technically. In terms of active use, outside a very few limited newsgroups (mostly peers of technical mailing lists), it's dead to today's Internet users."

RedditAlternatives,3bzm5p,ifiasco,22,Fri Jul 3 18:20:54 2015 UTC,"You really need to decide now if you will implement a real names policy or not.  For the people that really need pseudonyms the worst thing that can happen to them is using a site/service for a while and then getting doxxed later.  In my opinion, real name policies are bad.  There are plenty of bullies and trolls more than happy to do it under their real name already so insisting on names isn't a real solution anyway.  It also can't scale, not even Facebook and Google are able to ensure that people use their real names; nor is it even possible to do basic validation: some people really have 12 names, or punctuation and numbers as their legal name.  The only thing they actually accomplish is drive a certain subset of users away, most of which tend to be articulate and reasonably polite online.  It's your site/service, you don't have to cater to anyone.  But if it was mine, instead of real names I would provide blocks and filters (a.k.a. shadowbans/killfiles) and some kind of reputation system.  A name would just be a single text field with no need for complicated (and wrong) validation rules.  Clay Shirky has a good piece covering lots of the social landscape.  Regarding names he says:   1.) If you were going to build a piece of social software to support large and long-lived groups, what would you design for? The first thing you would design for is handles the user can invest in.  Now, I say ""handles,"" because I don't want to say ""identity,"" because identity has suddenly become one of those ideas where, when you pull on the little thread you want, this big bag of stuff comes along with it. Identity is such a hot-button issue now, but for the lightweight stuff required for social software, its really just a handle that matters.  It's pretty widely understood that anonymity doesn't work well in group settings, because ""who said what when"" is the minimum requirement for having a conversation. What's less well understood is that weak pseudonymity doesn't work well, either. Because I need to associate who's saying something to me now with previous conversations.  The world's best reputation management system is right here, in the brain. And actually, it's right here, in the back, in the emotional part of the brain. Almost all the work being done on reputation systems today is either trivial or useless or both, because reputations aren't linearizable, and they're not portable.  .... If you want a good reputation system, just let me remember who you are. And if you do me a favor, I'll remember it. And I won't store it in the front of my brain, I'll store it here, in the back. I'll just get a good feeling next time I get email from you; I won't even remember why. And if you do me a disservice and I get email from you, my temples will start to throb, and I won't even remember why. If you give users a way of remembering one another, reputation will happen, and that requires nothing more than simple and somewhat persistent handles.  Users have to be able to identify themselves and there has to be a penalty for switching handles. The penalty for switching doesn't have to be total. But if I change my handle on the system, I have to lose some kind of reputation or some kind of context. This keeps the system functioning.  ... Now a number of people point to [the Kaycee Nicole story] and say ""See, I told you about that identity thing!"" But the Kaycee Nicole story is this: changing your identity is really weird. And when the community understands that you've been doing it and you're faking, that is seen as a huge and violent transgression. And they will expend an astonishing amount of energy to find you and punish you. So identity is much less slippery than the early literature would lead us to believe.   And there it is: communities will naturally try to weed out the sockpuppets, trolls, and other bad actors for you.  They don't need a real name for it, just a persistent handle.  Regardless of your decision as a team, good luck with it."

It's a collaborative space where they come up with cool topics, comment and vote on them, then someone knowledgeable grabs and writes an in-depth piece about it. Somewhat explained here.  What's quite mental about it is that even at the final stages of publish, users help each other to revise the post and publish together.  The best way I could describe it is like a space for intellectuals of each art form, think /r/truefilm or similar but completely independent from reddit (it's not a clone).

The first migration from the BBS, meta filter, the death of digg, the somnolence of /., this possible reddit implosion.  I've seen it so often, and read about it enough to know, finally, that technology cannot save us. And if any technology were made to do the tasks that are implied by a ""well managed community"", we would have crowned a people emperor, and handed them the keys to our thoughts. Yeah that's overly wordy.  You want a good community? Be a good citizen, volunteer, work incessantly, and make sure people are getting real world work done when they interact. Hold yourself and others to a standard of friendliness and assistance."
RedditAlternatives,3c082r,darkneo86,18,Fri Jul 3 22:46:06 2015 UTC,"Well, if you read the comments related to today's drama (AMA catastrophe) it seems that what people want is Reddit with a few tweaks in regards to transparency, administrative tools, and less authoritative censorship.  Censorship by the community (votes) is OK. Censorship by mysterious ""admins"" is not.  What you've put together certainly looks nice but if Reddit users were into appearances and graphics we'd flock to Pinterest. Instead we're all about communities. Features that encourage communities would seem to be paramount and making content disappear should be reserved to that which is severe as opposed to things one simply doesn't care for."
RedditAlternatives,3c082r,Mostly_Lucid,9,Sat Jul 4 14:13:58 2015 UTC,That's a fair assessment.
RedditAlternatives,3c082r,darkneo86,5,Fri Jul 3 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"I love that you're all over this thread and responding quickly.   To be honest, I was all gung-ho about your pitch, but then read the comments and completely agree. I would say maybe a limit on posts if you 'downvote'/'censor' a post, and you can still view comments. So, maybe, if you downvote a post, you get 3 comments in it, 1 to state why maybe, 2 more to defend your position. If enough people (don't know the #) downvote your comments, you're relegated to simply viewing the thread, but no commenting.  Although, to be fair, that would eliminate some of the fun of current subs like /r/subredditdrama, which I love.  edit: /u/Mostly_Lucid, I just saw said my first part. I think it should be expanded to not just simply viewing, but a chance to state your view. If people agree, and you get 'credit', you then are able to continue responding until you lose enough 'credit' (some kind of ratio), that you are limited to only 2 more responses. Or something. That's going along with my above comment, where this happens only if you de-credit a post."
RedditAlternatives,3c082r,Mostly_Lucid,4,Fri Jul 3 18:38:28 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying!

RedditAlternatives,3c082r,talkb1nary,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:47:00 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I'm thinking. Kind of gives it a more strategical kind of back and forth, versus just having down vote trolls. I LOVE reading a good debate and discussion. But I hate reading a back and forth between someone downvoted into the 100s and someone up voted into the 60s. People have to vote if they want a discussion to continue."
RedditAlternatives,3c082r,jedimasterlenny,3,Fri Jul 3 18:57:37 2015 UTC,"People have to vote if they want a discussion to continue.      Ohh, ohh, yeah, THAT makes sense!!  Also, maybe you've been downvoted, say, 50 times, and the person who responds to you has been upvoted 50 times, you lose your option to continue posting in that thread - you get shut down.  At that point, nothing you say is forwarding the conversation anyway - you're either trying to preach to the wrong audience, or you're a troll.  In fact, a system like that has the potential to weed out troll accounts - if you are ""shut down"", say, 10 times, or 3 times in 30 days or something, your account, or maybe your IP, automatically gets shadowbanned, and nobody can see your comments again for, like, 30 days.    On the other hand, if you're just preaching to the wrong crowd, then this system saves you from doubling down on your already unpopular opinion by posting more crap in that same thread.  Also, nobody should be able to downvote from profile pages - keeps the downvote fairies at bay."

Reddit's biggest problem, in my personal opinion, is that it's a massive filter bubble for its users. The circlejerk is real, is massive, and it's disgusting. It's why I would never admit to my friends to be part of the reddit community. Slashdot has often been criticised for its ""slashdot groupthink"", but even that was never anywhere near as bad as what reddit has going. Even the current ""rebellion"" is nothing but a circlejerk gone off the rails. The only good part about that is that, apparently, the admins cannot control it. (Yet. They might just learn how, some time in the future, because this is possible if you know what you're doing.)"

RedditAlternatives,3c082r,AshleyVakarian,5,Sat Jul 4 05:02:58 2015 UTC,"Regarding the downvote alternative you're looking to implement:  I really like the idea, on principle. But, after some consideration, I feel like it might not be the best possible solution in practice.  There are times here on reddit where I see a debate taking place about a subject matter that I'm passionate about. Now, consider that, very often, the large debates in the comments are spurred on by someone saying something ridiculous and deserving of a downvote. Now, even though it was spawned from a trash comment, the topics that users delve into are often completely valid and enjoyable to discuss.   But, if we move the same situation to your system, I would be unable to participate in or even see that debate if I was to downvote that first comment.  But what is a solution here?  Well, as one user stated earlier in this thread, one possible route to take is to make a downvote result in your loss of participation, but still allow you to retain your ability to see the content. this would allow you to change your mind if some new piece of information convinced was unearthed, convincing you that you were wrong.  I do like this, but it's not a perfect solution, since it still removes the ability for users to state why they felt a post was worthy of a downvote, something that often leads to great discussion.    But I have another idea...  What if there were two separate features, one for agree/disagree and one for credit/remove. The agree/disagree score would be visible on the post, but would have no effect whatsoever on the position of that post. The credit/remove feature would still work as described initially (where removing a post hides it from you completely and lowers its credit score).   By having an agree/disagree option that has no effect besides a visible score, users are able to express their opinion, without that opinion changing the format of the post in question. Posts that users disagree with could have a negative opinion score, but still be at the top of the discussion, because it is relevant and inspires useful discussion.  What do you think?"

Were the site to gain real traction, I can't imagine you keeping up with the tide of people/bots shitposting to gain influence, only to sell that influence to the highest bidder. This refines the hivemind into a sort of self sustaining censorship.  I absolutely love your design. Looks awesome and I would be all over this. I just can't stress how much I oppose the vote system.

RedditAlternatives,3c082r,oalsaker,2,Fri Jul 3 20:18:13 2015 UTC,Very interesting! My favorite concept out of all the alternatives here.. I have very minimal knowledge in coding (but I could always learn). If you guys need any help with feedback though I'd be more than happy to join in!
RedditAlternatives,3c082r,GreenTeaBitch,2,Fri Jul 3 18:00:22 2015 UTC,"These points have a purpose, you can give credit to other users, posts, and comments to help boost them up their respective channels (and the front page). This incentivizes quality participation, because the more people interact with you, the more credit you get, the more power you have to shape what gets featured. There are limits on how much credit you can give at a time, to prevent abuse.   How is this different from what killed Digg?"
RedditAlternatives,3c082r,Celti,4,Fri Jul 3 23:50:23 2015 UTC,"Digg was killed for many reasons, mostly for features going away and the auto publishing of third party news.   You can read more about it here"
RedditAlternatives,3c082r,Spiffywatercolour,3,Sat Jul 4 04:03:01 2015 UTC,"Right, but it was also plagued by its creation of power users, whose influence over what was featured on the site resulted in little front-page diversity, with the power users simply putting their own stuff at the top.  On top of all of this, many power users were also paid by marketing firms to post their stuff. It sounds like Knoot is going to have this exact same problem, and judging by the reactions of much of reddit to the rumor that admins wanted more monetized AMAs, you may want to rethink this concept."
RedditAlternatives,3c082r,Ripdog,2,Fri Jul 3 18:03:52 2015 UTC,Like I mentioned there would be limit on how much credit you could give. I think a max of 50 points would be reasonable to properly reward power users without giving them undue influence but in practice maybe 10-25 would make more sense
RedditAlternatives,3c082r,jayl265,3,Fri Jul 3 18:12:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, look at politics in the US. Giving somebody 10 or 25 times the power of a base user is way too influential. Look at people like /u/Gallowboob who can generate karma/credit incredibly quickly. Giving away even 100 points would be a drop in the bucket. I seriously think 5 is a good amount. On reddit, comments begun to be hidden at -5, so that would be enough to bring something up to 0. Seems perfect for me."
RedditAlternatives,3c082r,holliniv,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:17:06 2015 UTC,This should also have a delayed effect when you use something like this. You don't want to have one person capable of downvoting something into oblivion before others even see it. Maybe like a 1 hour delay if you're using 5 credits.

Did you use the open source code Reddit is based on, or something else? Does it have an API like Reddit?  It wouldn't let me register (I guess that's what you meant by pre-alpha).  Once you get it to alpha or beta stability, it might be interesting to clone some of Reddit's content. For example, create a copy of every subreddit with at least 1000 subscribers, then copy the top 5% of posts (starting as far back as possible) and the top 10% of comments (with context).

The things which are vitally important to include right now are:   What platform is it for? (Android, web browser, desktop application etc) Descriptions (ideally only a couple of sentences, no one wants to read a full mission statement. I would say this is the top priotity right now as it's currently pretty bare) More alternatives (a shit ton have been mentioned recently which arent currently on the wiki, we should change that) Whether the alternative is under heavy server stress, running normally, down completely or currently unreliable (voat, for example, has been down for a couple of days and although it's not their fault at all, it was annoying to hear it's a good alternative but I can't check it out or play around with it)"
RedditAlternatives,3c3fuc,zants,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:33:25 2015 UTC,Alphabetical seems fair until you remember that the largest and most popular alternative starts with V.

RedditAlternatives,3c1504,schlichtm,31,Fri Jul 3 20:25:58 2015 UTC,It looks pretty cool but I'm still not sold on the idea of non-anonymity. I don't doubt having to use your real name increases politeness but surely it leads to self-censorship and excludes a large number of people because of potential real-world consequences?
RedditAlternatives,3c1504,BasedRafiki,5,Fri Jul 3 20:56:11 2015 UTC,Totally agree. We started with real world identities but we definitely see the benefit of being anonymous.
RedditAlternatives,3c1504,USThunder,7,Fri Jul 3 21:21:39 2015 UTC,I prefer not to use anything social media with real identity attached. As a matter of point I won't use it. People can still make fake accounts which makes it even more annoying when someone trolls.
RedditAlternatives,3c1504,JadeFrogs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:08:17 2015 UTC,"Sweet, sweet delicious personal data...   Totally agree    Rubbish. I speculate that the social media login only, real identity, design choice was a key plank of your business plan you pitched to the VCs, from day one."
RedditAlternatives,3c1504,KirilGantchev,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:44:43 2015 UTC,"I would imagine that the thing he pitched was Bitcoin, not ""real identity."" How many ""real identity"" networks are out there? Hundreds? :) I don't think any VC will buy into yet another real identity social network these days. The entire design seems to be centered around micro-payments, i.e. The Holy Grail of the Internets.  Maybe I'm wrong about this, but what if OP simply made the Facebook/Twitter login because 99% of the users don't want to maintain separate passwords/IDs!? Whoa, no conspiracy to screw with the privacy of users, just lazy like the rest of us programmers?! :) :)"
RedditAlternatives,3c1504,JadeFrogs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:44:19 2015 UTC,"It is not a conspiracy :).   I used to make third party Facebook apps. The 'social media only' login, is a specific design choice. Your users are much more valuable because social media accounts leak data like crazy :).

RedditAlternatives,3c1504,KirilGantchev,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:18:27 2015 UTC,"From the looks of it, micro-payments are the only thing that distinguish ZapChain from other social network. Again, I doubt any VC would be jumping at the chance to invest their money in yet another social network."

RedditAlternatives,3c1504,KirilGantchev,2,Sat Jul 4 14:02:07 2015 UTC,"Ditto, I appreciate the chat.  It's rarely a technical reason that gets a startup to dominate a market, unless that's the only thing that differentiates two competitors. And don't get me wrong, technical execution is very important, but it's just a part of a very complex recipe.  BTW, you don't need a green card to get funded. I went through the Boost VC accelerator, about half the founders were on visas. There was even a 17-year-old french kid who was also accepted into the accelerator. My co-founder and our entire team were on visas. It's the same with YC, 500, Techstars, etc. If you truly believe that funding is that easy, then you haven't tried fundraising. And I don't mean that to be dismissive of your opinion, I'm just pointing out that everybody that I've talked to, who's had a startup and raised funds, has told me that it is by far the hardest thing they have ever done! From my personal experience, I have to agree. A lot of people look at the ""unicorn"" companies and they think that those companies magically raised funds, but the amount of work you have to do to raise money is insane. To get a couple million USD, you have to talk to over 100 VCs (if this is your first time raising)."

RedditAlternatives,3c2zuo,kiwikku,2,Sat Jul 4 16:13:11 2015 UTC,"Having people vote on every little thing is counter productive. You end up with everything being decided by the hardcore few. These core users always become resistant to any real change. They also tend to try and fortify their influence. Most users aren't going to want to bother, they just want to discover new content and discuss things. They also don't have the ability to see the big picture so to speak. This can partially be alleviated by the site owner(s) providing detailed information behind their rational for proposed changes but now you're running a series of political campaigns and not a site."

RedditAlternatives,3by5o2,caughtinthought,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:08:47 2015 UTC,the invite-only thing on snapzu seems really stupid.  i think most of us who can't scramble for codes will just have to wait for voat.co to get a little more structure before joining.
RedditAlternatives,3by5o2,folkrav,2,Fri Jul 3 18:08:17 2015 UTC,"Not stupid - actually pretty smart, considering what's happening to Voat right now - I could see Voat once in the ten times I tried to connect... They crashed once, and are pretty fast to fix any issues. The codes are pretty easy to find right now, you get three invite codes just for joining, so availability is exponential...  Plus, they're self-founded for now, and have no intention of making profit. There's people speaking of crowd-funding the place, or something."

RedditAlternatives,3by5o2,uberduger,18,Fri Jul 3 23:16:15 2015 UTC,"It was gradual for a while, then they did a major site redesign that everyone hated. That was the big catalyst for many (including me) to switch to reddit.  If this shutdown lasts for more than a few days, or results in a big negative change in overall site function, it could be a major event like the digg exodus."
RedditAlternatives,3by5o2,jimmiefan48,10,Fri Jul 3 05:53:41 2015 UTC,"when digg exodus happened reddit was already a mature community. you can share cat pics or share a news about net neutrality anywhere on the interwebs but finding intelligeble comments on a good interface with a fair voting system is the most important thing and that makes reddit somewhat unique.  I'm yet to see viable alternative, I'm actually waiting for voat.co to become online, they look promising. Others are mostly web 2.0 bullshit with shiny interface."

RedditAlternatives,3by5o2,jimmiefan48,3,Fri Jul 3 07:26:14 2015 UTC,I remember it quite clearly. I was a hardcore Digg fanboy but then V4 happened and I had to pack my bags. Coming to Reddit (something I hated for it being a rival) was like being a freshman in HS trying to find a place to sit at lunch. Overtime I met people and it became my new home. The switch is always hard but time will heal everything. A new giant will come out on top.
RedditAlternatives,3by5o2,nickcantwaite,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:16:25 2015 UTC,"The Digg one was absolutely amazing to be a part of.

Here is Voat's response to the amount of traffic coming in and their servers not being able to keep up:     ""Voat is currently getting hit with a huge amount of traffic as a direct result of recent changes happening over at that other place. Everyone, we're sorry. We're both sad to see what we once loved change in this manner, but we're also excited about the future, but our future won't be traveling down this same path. We won't be getting any sleep tonight (again) and we are doing everything we can to handle the traffic. Our budget is limited but we'll make sure to fight to the last penny in order to keep Voat a love for this community. If you want to donate, well, now is the time.""     This is followed by a link where you can donate to their bitcoin address, but I'm not certain of the rules for posting that sort of thing, so you can click the link above if you want more information.

RedditAlternatives,3by5o2,Ninja_Fox_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:36:04 2015 UTC,"Well maybe they could do that even though it might not be as beneficial/functional as the app. I figure it would slowly grow as a browser used product (like 50/50 or so, maybe more) just because that's more convenient for a lot of people but when it starts getting like Reddit is now there will be an alternative.  Even if making a browser version is impractical there could always be the app version.  Viva la revolution."

RedditAlternatives,3bysnd,rickdg,27,Fri Jul 3 22:03:24 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea and downloaded the mac client. Its taking a while to download the first sync though.   As a programmer who has dealt with some distributed systems tech (but not p2p, more working with distributed databases and embedded devices), this is a seriously ambitious project and I'd be glad if this takes off.  I'd also be willing to try and tackle a web alternative if I get the time (fyi, I made slicer.io, which I've posted on /r/redditalternatives). I noticed that somewhere it mentions that its an open protocol, do you have a link for that?"
RedditAlternatives,3bysnd,Flux159,9,Fri Jul 3 08:10:23 2015 UTC,The first sync can be a little problematic. If it doesnt work then restart the client a few times and if it still wont sync then remove the data folder at ~/Library/Application Support  If all that doesnt work then you can contact the developer http://getaether.net/sending_logs  Also the source code is up on github. There is no documentation but the code is well commented
RedditAlternatives,3bysnd,rickdg,10,Fri Jul 3 08:14:13 2015 UTC,"Cool, I think that this would be the protocol file at the moment: https://github.com/nehbit/aether-public/blob/master/InputOutput/aetherProtocol.py ; haven't done python since I messed around w/ Blender internals but it seems easy enough to read through.  The general idea of making a web client would be converting the protocol into javascript and using web sockets in order to connect to other machines using aether. It probably wouldn't work with older browsers that don't support web sockets though (which in my opinion is fine, even IE8 is not being supported by MS after 2016). Haven't worked directly with web sockets myself (usually only tried out socket.io/meteor), but there's always something new to learn.  I'll definitely try to help out if I can / when I get the time."
RedditAlternatives,3bysnd,riskable,4,Fri Jul 3 08:27:20 2015 UTC,That would be amazing! I have a basic idea how it works from looking  over the code but im not a very good developer. If you could get this working I would definitely donate some money to you.

RedditAlternatives,3bysnd,meridielcul,8,Fri Jul 3 09:00:02 2015 UTC,"So I was thinking of something different. I'm sure you could add an http/web sockets server component to the current implementation and do:  browser <-> aether server <--> other aether clients  But then someone/multiple people would need to host aether server(s) that browsers could connect to.  I was thinking convert the protocol into JS and just have a static UI layer (just html and css). You could host it anywhere (even Amazon S3 or any static file host) and link to it, or you could just download an html, css, js zip & run it locally via your browser (instead of via an app)."
RedditAlternatives,3bysnd,Flux159,3,Fri Jul 3 09:16:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, cool idea. That's the beauty of open source."
RedditAlternatives,3bysnd,meridielcul,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:27:58 2015 UTC,Converting the protocol to JS would be a huge undertaking. JS just wasn't made for such things. It would be easier to just write a web based GUI that interacts with a Python back end that maintains the communication with the Aether network.  The only hard part is maintaining each user's unique identity with just the one site (which may actually consist of multiple servers). That's the real problem to solve with any distributed system like this when making a web front end.
RedditAlternatives,3bysnd,Flux159,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:26:27 2015 UTC,"This sounds much better. JavaScript is much more suited to math, captchas, trivial code such as removing styles from a tag when a user has scrolled far enough, etc, most of which can now be accomplished by CSS3. JavaScript is meant for user interaction, not for servers and all the bells and whistles of server stuff (although new web technologies are pushing that eg. Node)   An added benefit would be less load on the client, which means better user experience, which means more user base."
RedditAlternatives,3bysnd,blue_arrow_comment,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:58:40 2015 UTC,can't you use JS to connect directly to the p2p network?
RedditAlternatives,3bysnd,sillet,6,Fri Jul 3 09:26:10 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm hoping that web sockets allows (or webrtc - which is supposed to be for peer to peer video, but apparently can be used for data). However, I don't have extensive experience with either of those two technologies yet (which is why I think it'd be a great learning exercise).  Edit: Whoops, just read it as ""can't""; I thought you meant ""can you use JS"". I think my response would be the same though."

RedditAlternatives,3bysnd,reddit_crunch,2,Fri Jul 3 09:37:55 2015 UTC,It would effectively be a proxy to allow the browser to communicate with other p2p nodes if for some reason the protocol can't be converted to JS.

RedditAlternatives,3bysnd,Lucarxo,2,Sat Jul 4 03:18:43 2015 UTC,"Symbol of Chaos:       The Symbol of Chaos originates from Michael Moorcock's Eternal Champion stories. In them, the Symbol of Chaos comprises eight arrows in a radial pattern. In contrast, the symbol of Law is a single upright arrow. It is also called the Arms of Chaos, the Arrows of Chaos, the Chaos Star, the Chaos Cross, or the Symbol of Eight.  Moorcock has stated that he conceived this symbol while writing the first Elric of Melniboné stories in the early 1960s. It was subsequently adopted into the pop-cultural mainstream, turning up in such places as modern occult traditions and role-playing games.  There are a number of traditional symbols that have the same geometrical pattern as Moorcock's symbol of Chaos, such as any of various eight-pointed stars, the star of Ishtar/Venus, the Eastern Dharmacakra and the Wheel of the Year, but none of these were symbols of chaos and their limbs are not arrows.

RedditAlternatives,3bznrz,arsenix,28,Fri Jul 3 13:16:37 2015 UTC,"I do like the concept of Aether, but I think the ""free of the web"" aspect means that it is probably unlikely to build a large userbase since it requires a dedicated client. A web client could be possible for less privacy minded users. Also Aether is a pretty terrible name since there is so much fantasy/minecraft/cruft that shares the word!"
RedditAlternatives,3bznrz,taranasus,7,Fri Jul 3 15:39:36 2015 UTC,I honestly like it a lot! The problem is with anonymity and decentralization it also allows for people to go crazy and do... ilegitimate stuff on it. I'm waiting now for the initial sync to finish to see what's around on it but I find the concept quite appealing.  While it could do with a web app as well I really like the dedicated client concept.

RedditAlternatives,3bznrz,Ninja_Fox_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:46:58 2015 UTC,Once you get a thread the client will keep it forever. But nodes are set to stop sending around a thread after 6 months. If you know the hash of a post you can still ask nodes for it and if they have it they will give it to you.  Hashes could work like links for example aether://hash would bring you to the post even if it is over 6 months old
RedditAlternatives,3bznrz,avnti,3,Sat Jul 4 04:53:37 2015 UTC,"Serious question, how can we ensure that this Reddit alternative, or any other is as free from shills and agents as possible given the rampant turfing over the last few months/years?

RedditAlternatives,3bznrz,otakuman,2,Fri Jul 3 19:37:14 2015 UTC,"I started a discussion for a new distributed protocol. The idea is that while there will be pseudonimity (even anonymity) and censorship-resistance, as in newsgroups/freenet, boards will be moderated by their creators, and the creators will grant public key certificates to new users. This avoids the problem of trolling/brigading/shilling that negatively affects reddit.  It's WIP and just a raw sketch. I'm planning to do a full modelling of reddit's use cases and the alternatives, so we can at least replicate (hopefully) 100% of reddit's functional capabilities.  The problem I have right now is that I have nowhere else to post it anonymously, but reddit. Yeah, kinda bummer.

RedditAlternatives,3bznrz,cdunn2001,9,Sat Jul 4 03:06:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that no one has reddit's userbase... but are any of these sites even designed to be able to grow to handle it? Many of them intend to stay as niche websites which is totally fine, but I think one of the most attractive aspects of reddit is the massive scale.  I'd like to see a site that can become something better than reddit, not just grow into a copy of it when it gets enough traction. The issues reddit has run into aren't easy to solve. Dealing with spammers and companies trying to exploit the site for free advertising. Dealing with hateful content while maintaining free speech and open discourse. Bringing in enough money to keep the site open (and keep the investors happy).  So which sites are just reddit 5 years ago, and which ones are trying to do things differently? Voat (to me... very limited experience and not pointing fingers) seems like reddit 5 years ago. Voat is starting to hit some of the early speedbumps like having their hosting/paypal shut down over adverse content."
RedditAlternatives,3bznrz,absspaghetti,7,Fri Jul 3 13:29:16 2015 UTC,"I scale things like this for a living.  It doesn't matter if they were designed for it, it's more of a question of if the owners have access to the talent to scale them and enough people to run them.   It's not like we're going to have a place to run to, We're going to have to wait for these medium sized sites to work it out.     At least the problems are pretty well known. Content Control is needed, staff is needed, community is needed, if you have all that in place, hosting is NBD, it's just architecture and money.      More interesting stuff is what content do you block?  You need to protect your company/site/self from getting sued.  Obviously anything felony is right out, you need community to report and admin/mods to report and ban-inate.    Reddit has done a pretty shitty job with advertising.  For a free site, it could have had quite a bit more and still have been fairly acceptable.  Throw in a pay to remove ads and figure 75% will still adblock instead. Put in some better pay features like private communities and basic link mirroring."
RedditAlternatives,3bznrz,astoundingchair,2,Fri Jul 3 13:55:35 2015 UTC,"I'd have no problem with paying to avoid ads.  The problem is that I'd then want a greater say in what mods do. I want controversy. That's why I'm here. I want free and open discussion. It's messy, but it's how change happens. If all I wanted was a link aggregator, I'd go elsewhere."
RedditAlternatives,3bznrz,18andover,2,Fri Jul 3 15:39:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there has to be some give and take. I don't have a problem with cess pools, as long as it's not going to get me in court or jail for trying to keep them up.  Hardcore hate groups and illegal porn can probably be left off the list without too many tears.  You need some very clear, very strict rules. The selective morality is the bitch of it. Hate<insert race here>: not cool, hateWalmart yeah sure!, hateWalmartShoppers: still probably cool, but wtf how's the line drawn?    It's easy to say, we don't moderate the allowance of groups existence for content. But you have to block illegal porn, you're going to end up getting hassled into blocking piracy if it gets big.  It's that fine line on moral policing. Holding that line ends up putting you in court, jail or financial trouble, which is imo not really worth it."
RedditAlternatives,3bznrz,walt_ua,2,Fri Jul 3 17:51:38 2015 UTC,"I'd have no problem with paying to avoid ads.   I think metafilter's the only one like that right now, but it's REALLY, really different from reddit. The subs work very, very differently, though there's an ask page, a general posts page, an ""I made this"" page, and a few others; and posts are generally much more substantial. Here's a link to the page where everyone talks to the paid mods.  It's also really different from reddit in that they'll straight ban you for being a disruptive dumb fuck. I love it."
RedditAlternatives,3bznrz,Mitten5,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:40:27 2015 UTC,"In reddit's case, how much of the moderation actually happens by paid staff? Seems like a lot is done by volunteers. I suppose that is more difficult to control since when people are volunteering their time they tend to be less likely to accept what management says. Takes a lot more leadership skill at the top too (ie what reddit is failing at right now).  It is always a big debate as to what to block and what not. You'd like to say ""we support free speech and accept all content"". Illegal content though will take down the site eventually (or at least make things hard). Hate content even if legal? reddit hasn't done a terrible job at this, although they haven't handled the pr/leadership side of it very well in all cases."
RedditAlternatives,3bznrz,absspaghetti,0,Sat Jul 4 18:14:44 2015 UTC,"I suspect the founders of all of them dream of one day doing to reddit what reddit did to digg, even if the founders say otherwise to their communities right now.   It's not a matter of 'designed to be able to grow' it's a matter of scaling. When you get the reddit hug of death, it's hard for a small team to handle that. And not just from a front page submission but from fucking every corner of reddit sending massive amounts of traffic at you. That would bring most any small site to it's knees.  The underlying theme of your comments is basically 'i really want to use Voat and it's down right now, this sucks' and I feel you on that. Just be patient, it will be back up eventually."

They encourage mods to hide infracting posts and give users a chance to edit them to compliance with community guidelines (whatever that means).

I appreciate that it is Reddit without badmins (so far), but I am looking for something that isn't just a clone of Reddit's aesthetics with slight improvements in functionality.

Snapzu : A bit different, still similar but with different ""rewards"" systems (XP and levels progression, actually rewards contributions), more moderated but a lot more pleasant to browse. Less users though, but feels like a tightly-knit community. You don't go to Snapzu to make it a new Reddit, you leave Reddit and become a Snapzite.    I prefer Snapzu, but that's a matter of opinion.

I don't like the updated ones either (more below), but the bottom part of this post is no longer relevant. Now, the new TOS:   forbid any automated interaction with the website (goodbye mobile apps and browser extensions), forbid you from selling anything you have ever posted on the website, forbid you from ""redistributing"" material from website (= no quoting, reposting or crossposting), while allowing the site owners to do that.   Generally these TOS look pretty hostile (to me). For an example of TOS that I consider friendly and reasonable, see Snapzu.    Old comment below.

RedditAlternatives,3c0ab2,kiwikku,12,Sat Jul 4 02:03:44 2015 UTC,"High content density and low flash, low complication.  On reddit I can fit 11 links on screen at once, and it's simple to read from top to bottom. That's zoomed in, because I like the fonts larger. Clicking a link opens the link, no Javascript, no fuss.  On other sites I'm seeing 8, 6, even 4 or 2 posts per screen (without zooming) before I have to scroll for more, and on some of them posts (slowly) open inline, or the site is broken because I haven't whitelisted its Javascript yet. It feels like they're totally missing what made reddit reddit.  Reddit never seemed to be about viewing every link, it just aggregates tons of content and you can decide what's interesting at a glance. If the content is already loaded and displayed inline or otherwise takes up a huge tile, I might find myself having to scroll through a bunch of memes I'm not interested in just to search for something I might be.  And then half these sites are breaking under the influx of new users. Is it because the codebase is overcomplicated or because they don't have enough servers? It's hard to consider adding a site to your daily routine when it's down or takes 30s to load literally every time you've tried checking it."

What this says is that I like smaller communities, especially ones where I might even know some of the people. Most of the subreddits to which I subscribe are for games I play. I value a calm, friendly atmosphere where I might even know [some of] the people there. I should be able to see only the content that I want to see.  If there is a voting system, mass up/downvoting shouldn't be permitted. It should only be in place to sort content-- this also means no aggregate karma score like reddit has, to discourage karma whoring.  A layout with high content density is important. Reddit is very good at this, allowing one to see ten posts at once. The UI should make sense and look nice, and a good mobile interface certainly helps too."

RedditAlternatives,3bzhhh,bcegkm,6,Fri Jul 3 12:07:37 2015 UTC,"I feel like I remember an interview with one of the reddit cofounders where they talked about either using a 5 star voting system or a simple upvote and downvote. I think it was a video interview where he explained (paraphrasing) ""I only ever used 5 stars or no stars to sort my music library, so we didn't implement 5 star voting on reddit"".  I can't find where I read/saw that (and I hope I'm not imagining it), but I think that it may have influenced other sites as well."
RedditAlternatives,3bzhhh,Flux159,2,Fri Jul 3 13:45:36 2015 UTC,I believe they talked about it in episode 24 of the Upvoted podcast.
RedditAlternatives,3bzhhh,Nashafa,6,Fri Jul 3 16:47:59 2015 UTC,Sadly 5-star rating systems have been proven to be pretty useless. People either just use them to 1-star something or 5-star them. This is why youtube switched years ago...  http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2009/09/five-stars-dominate-ratings.html  http://www.evanhamilton.com/star-rating-systems-j-curve/  http://seansandulak.com/2014/06/13/are-5-star-rating-systems-useless/
RedditAlternatives,3bzhhh,Derimagia,2,Fri Jul 3 16:31:11 2015 UTC,"If you look at Amazon, you will notice that people are using the 5 stars for different things. I think most use 5 stars like an upvote, and 1-4 stars are some kind of downvote. Some will actually use 3 stars for a solid product - not good but not bad: Does what it should. They use 4 or 5 stars for better or even excellent products. But you never now who uses which system, and all stars will be calculated into the same average - which sucks.  Most users will not take the time to actually think about the product and compare it to other, similar products and then give a according rating. Therefore, a simple upvote/downvote, or just ""like"" is easier and better for mass ratings."

RedditAlternatives,3bxov9,Darklight88,3,Fri Jul 3 02:21:18 2015 UTC,The site was overrun by spammers a while back. The community voted to move to invite only. A lot of the current members (including me) still like the codes. It helps slow the influx of new users to prevent a massive shift in the site culture. We aren't about becoming the next reddit. We wan't to have our own unique community.
RedditAlternatives,3bxov9,EffZeeOhNine,3,Fri Jul 3 02:18:30 2015 UTC,"It's hard to put an exact finger on what the community is ""like"". I'd say wait for the site to come back up and check it out for yourself. I can say that it is much more content oriented than reddit. Much better for people who enjoy the link aggregation side of reddit. The way posts (called snaps) function is quite different than reddit and the communities are more of a network rather than individual groups. It's really hard to do it justice by describing it through. Its just similar enough to reddit that it can be described, but not similar enough for those descriptions to paint a truly accurate picture."

Expect to expand in the future. Hereshot uses your location to deliver aggregated news and entertainment posts near you. That's currently photos, links and text. On Monday, video is being included into the release.   Imagine reddit, but instead of their being just one front page for the entire world, Hereshot is location based, so you can search multiple areas (no matter how narrow or wide) and get multiple hot listings for content. You can search in just your town or your entire continent - or the continent over. Or a town in a completely different country. Provided there's content being shared there. It is a very new app, so lots of areas without content at the moment. The west coast of the US tends to have the most activity.   You can also select a time range to load content. By default it's the most recent posts, but you can go back to older posts. The past hour. The past day. Two weeks ago. The year 1982. Again, provided there content there. It's a pretty cool concept, I think."

RedditAlternatives,3byrj7,yamchanice,3,Fri Jul 3 06:40:08 2015 UTC,Interesting idea. How are (sub)categories created/managed?
RedditAlternatives,3byrj7,rickdg,2,Fri Jul 3 09:04:35 2015 UTC,"Hey Rick!  Categories/sub-categories are created by me. Users cannot change or edit them. (for example. Current we have a category called people, and under ""people"" there is a sub category called ""sports-person"". Users are unable to create new categories).   What users can do is create ""topics/subjects"" which they then can write their opinions on. (very much like how users can create pages on Wikipedia).   Writing an opinion on a topic is very straightforward:  1.) type the topic into the search bar. If the topic doesn't show up then you can create the topic.  2.) Give the topic a score between 0-100  3.) write your opinion 4.) submit. 5.) Now the score of the subject will be slightly influenced by the score you gave it.  Now, the cool thing is (even thought I say it myself) that not everyone has the same influence over the final score of a subject on Panjury. This is because we take into account 1.) the age of your account 2.) the quality of your written opinion 3.)whether you posted anonymously or using a verified account.   Let me know if you have any more questions!"
RedditAlternatives,3byrj7,rickdg,2,Fri Jul 3 16:58:52 2015 UTC,"Understood, I'm browsing through the site right now. I don't think there is ever a perfect solution for categories. For example, I think tabletop gaming (boardgames, RPGs, card games, etc.) should probably be under gaming and not as toys. However, I see you do have a lot of content inserted already.  Do you know the site boardgamegeek.com (and rpggeek.com)? The usability is weak, but the database is super-complete and has an almost decent API. You probably can get that niche into panjury if you rescue that type out of the toy box ;)"
RedditAlternatives,3byrj7,rickdg,2,Fri Jul 3 17:30:51 2015 UTC,You're right! We can definately upgrade/update our subcategories better.   Thank you for your input! I'll definitely check out rpg geeks when I wake up! (It's almost 2am here!)

RedditAlternatives,3c0q0b,kevsudos,3,Fri Jul 3 18:29:48 2015 UTC,"Assuming it has as much traffic as reddit, would take a lot of work and money just to keep it up and running without downtime. The actual features aren't that difficult to build if you have some basic programming knowledge but keeping it running is the hard part. You wouldn't be able to just throw it up on a shitty $5 per month host and expect it to last more than about ten seconds.  Reddit is also opensource: https://github.com/reddit/reddit  So you could theoretically make a clone using their exact code pretty easily."
RedditAlternatives,3c0q0b,lexbuck,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:37:23 2015 UTC,Thanks for the information. Where would I begin to go about looking for a host that would be able to handle that kind of traffic?
RedditAlternatives,3c0q0b,talkb1nary,3,Fri Jul 3 20:05:30 2015 UTC,"The thing is, if it would take off you can't just host it. Reddit is designed to balance its load to a multi server architecture, i did not look into it really but i guess they also have some kind of high class protection systems in the front. We are talking about multiple thousand dollars a month, and this is just the hosting. You will also need to heavily moderate.  But in the end some elite users who manage the funds would would make the decissions when things would go wrong, so we may just end up in a similiar situation.  Edit:// here is a interesting article on their architecture and issues"
RedditAlternatives,3c0q0b,lexbuck,2,Fri Jul 3 20:49:44 2015 UTC,"There's a lot. Rackspace or somewhere like that would be one with their dedicated server options.   Honestly though, you wouldn't need to worry about that for a long while. As long as the host was flexible and was capable of growing with you you would be okay. Building a web community is extremely hard. People aren't real open to change most times and won't easily just jump ship to the new site on the block especially when there's little content. It's definitely not a ""build it and they will come"" thing. Most times you have little content so people aren't real apt to switch and start posting which in turn keeps content low. So it's a real conundrum. I'm doing what reddit did on one of mine and using fake accounts to build and give the impression of activity on the site. I programmed it into the submission process so that I can create new users on the fly with new posts."

Reddit's new CEO who gives zero shits about the community and is involved in schemes with her husband banned that subreddit for ""harassment."" She basically banned it because she doesn't value reddit's ideals of free speech.   This is not a good time to be new, friend. Reddit's good years are far behind it. I started lurking back in 2011. It's drastically different and not in a good way. What's happening to reddit now is what happened to a website called Digg (much like reddit) back in 2009-2010.

It ""scales"" by spending tens of thousands of dollars a month on hundreds of EC2 instances to run the site. That has nothing to do with the code. Voat is slower because it's being run by a couple of guys on a couple of servers and they have no money to afford more resources.   A Reddit alternative needs to take a different approach. That's why there's a lot of interest in distributed systems. Any site that's run by one person or company will have a single point of failure. If a few thousand people can pool their computing power, there will be plenty of housing resources and no single point of failure."

It's one method, yes, but it can be very expensive, especially for a small startup trying to compete with Reddit and other social news sites.

Just about every framework has been painstakingly designed by very smart people over decades. They have just gotten better year after year, sometimes by a demonstrable order of magnitude. Why use software that's 10 years out of date?  This is just a news aggregator.  You need three tables including one for users, at a minimum.  It isn't an issue with available software. I'm certain a suitable replacement could be built relatively easily. The problem is that the public does not switch. They use whatever they are used to until such a time that what they are used to becomes completely unavailable.  If Google tomorrow released something they spent $10B researching and developing, which blows the lid off this place technologically and psychologically.

It's not censorship it's quality control.  Especially to reduce spam bots which is what they had issues with. Seemed pretty fair to me.

RedditAlternatives,3ay9r8,3hux,2,Wed Jun 24 13:50:36 2015 UTC,"Mind if I provide some constructive feedback? First off, let me say that I do like the idea of the site and I could see my self visiting if a few changes were made.   The color scheme is pretty tough on the eyes. There is a lot going on there which it makes it difficult to actually scan the news. I see what you are doing with the panels, not a bad idea; however, every story does not need to be a different color. Personally, I would say leave the headlines black, have all the hashtags the same color, and the the bottom icons all one color. This gives the reader some stability and knows what to look for. The Icons are rough on the eyes too. Also the ""Live Trending"", Topics, and ""News Streams"" obstructed part of the headlines when scrolling. This happened in desktop and mobile view. Do like the logo though. Keep that. Fonts. There is too much difference in Font sizes between the headlines and the hashtags. Makes it difficult to read and scan. I would suggest mimicking a news paper a little more. Maybe only having 4 to 6 pts between the two. Something like Headlines at 14 and hastags at 10.  Also the bottom row of icons should be a little smaller as well.   These are all aesthetic, and could be easy to fix. I like the retro look too. I also like the ability to filter by hashtag when clicked...that was nice. However, there was one thing really lacking as a reddit alternative), the ability to comment.  This is a major thing and probably the hardest to implement. When I clicked the headline, I was expecting the ability to comment. However, I was taken to just a bigger version of the tile. That page should include a comment section like reddit. I do like how the click takes to an intermediary page instead of straight to the link destination. Reddit taking me straight to the linked destination always annoyed me.  I know this was a lot, and am not really trying to be an ass ... but I think the site has great potential... just need some tweaks."
RedditAlternatives,3ay9r8,BobsYourUnc,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:42:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your feedback - it is much appreciated for us at this alpha stage of development.  We definitely plan to A/B test all of the changes you've mentioned and some others that we have internally discussed.  We also plan to allow users to alter the interface to their liking adjusting every aspect of what you pointed out.  I'm hoping this customization feature will be in our upcoming beta, but it might be a few months to be in place.  I really appreciate you taking the time to be so detailed. Thank you!  I do want to speak to your point about the lack of commenting.  Honestly, I am fighting to keep comments -off- the system.  We don't want our system to be a place for people to discuss the news - there is many other sites well established for people to do that already ;-) However, I feel there is a lacking of passive websites these days, meant for non-interactors.  I myself have been a lurker on reddit and imgur and many other sites for years and years. I started our site for folks like me that really just want to read the facts, the sources, the links - and if its easy enough (I.E - no login required) I would interact with a minimal action such an up/down vote.  Up until posting to redditalternatives, I have had an extremely minimal amount of written interaction on any sites. Maybe a little bit on somethingawful a decade or two ago, otherwise next to nothing from me as far as posting goes - but I certainly want to vote and help others find content, based on what I viewed and liked. Commenting feels a bit dated to me, and while I have many years of chatting on IRC under my belt, I feel the future is paved with less comments and more trending analysis and data tracking - and I want to make sure that our site reflects this progress - while keeping all the users safe and protected and anonymous.  We are incorporating a voting system for the tags themselves, and allow people to submit replacement tags for articles and links, and then allow all the public to vote on those tags which affect the weighing of the articles when searching and grouping tags together. In addition, we track views of articles and of headlines that people read, and use that data to establish our trending section (although, as of writing this our trending section has a major bug that is being fixed this week and this tracking is not working correctly)  We want to link to multiple social networks to let people visit them from our site, for discussions about the topic/aricle at hand, but I don't want our site to be pigeon-holed as just-another-reddit-clone. We are meant to be a pure and private news aggregator for commuters and people on-the-go.  I know it is difficult to understand and see our full vision at this stage, but we wanted to get the site out there and start collecting feedback like yours, in hopes to incorporate the public's ideas for our site and really build it into something special.    We want to always be independent and always be a source of all the news from all of the angles of a topic.  I hope this is interesting enough for you to check out are site again.  We have new changes we are rolling out this month, so hopefully you'll check back again soon and tell us what else you think :-)  Thank you again for taking the time."

All same stories as everywhere else in an unattractive looking arrangement that makes it hard to navigate. I see nothing here that Google News doesn't do better and more stylishly. Go look at Popurls.com, too.    I'm guessing that those hashtag looking things are something to do with twitter. I wish twitter would crawl up Facebook's ass and explode and destroy them both, so maybe I don't fit your customer profile.   Finally, notice the name of this sub: redditalternatives. Your site is not even remotely an alternative to reddit. You seem to be passing discussion boards off to other websites. Reddit's whole thing is that you can get into fights with equally anonymous strangers about things that neither one really has any business trying to discuss, and collect meaningless internet points. I'm not seeing that functionality with Newsbae, which incidentally is a shitty name because Chrome REALLY wants to send me to NewsbasE.com."

The hexagon buttons are just meant to be fun - sorry they were so offensive to you. The large font usage is so its easy to read/scan the headlines.  The site is meant for people that want to consume and read lots of news, instead of having to look at dozens of sites to accomplish the same thing. Google News and popurls are extremely limited in their # of feeds and the sites they pull, and while there are obvious similarities, we feel our future versions and goals are far different than those other sites.  We are a news aggregator, not a reddit clone. I was seeing the reddit alternatives sub as a sub for 'non'-reddit sites not for reddit-clones, which is why I posted here. Our community is meant to share news stories, not fight and argue about them - there are enough sites for that already.  The hashtags are simply keywords that let you find related items when you click on them.   If your Chrome is autocompleting to newsbase.com it probably means you've visited newsbase.com before.   Thank you for your feedback, it is much appreciated."

That cable box is just a big ass modem.

Open Source is a much stronger model because everything is transparent and open. I would rather build a platform in the open with full transparency and where adversaries have to fight us in the open on things that matter not silly wedge issues like the freedom to share racists jokes or the totally indefensible (opposite of freedom) to share pictures of abused children.

This includes my private server which was only used to host my girlfriends blog. She is a scientist. She published her research papers on that blog (pre-formatted papers to which she owns the copyright). That server contained no other data whatsoever.  The reason they gave us when they notified us that they have cancelled our contract is ""...we have received significant information that the content on your server includes political incorrect parts that are unacceptable for us."" and ""Due to the fact that we cannot keep bond of trust to you as our customer..."".  Luckily, we have managed to move our databases to a cloud platform mere hours before they shut down our servers. Ladies and gentlemen, my eyes have been opened by this. I don't know about you, but we are living in a weird world. We will have to carefully evaluate our long term options of providing a platform of free speech if we are to stay online. Your donations are what keeps us afloat.  Also, I am back in Sweden from my post-graduation vacation, currently packing my things and I will be driving (moving) to Switzerland tomorrow or day after tomorrow.  Edit: just to clarify, I have been a hosteurope.de customer for well over 5 years, always paying my bills and never hosting any illegal content.  Edit 2: thank you all who donated. I removed info on how to donate as I feel we have received enough to help us survive for quite some time. We will publish a detailed report about how much money we have received through donations (all bitcoin transactions are already public) and what the money will be used for. I can already say that we have received around 8000 USD since our call for donation went up a few days ago. This money will most likely have to be taxed, but a detailed report will be published asap. I have received interview requests from several major news agencies but responding to these agencies will have to wait. A voat which runs smoothly and satisfied users is my #1 priority.

However, reddit, which is a platform for all ideas, or mcdonalds, which is a place that sells hamburgers, has no business making any attempts to take steps to prevent ideas being seen by other people.  I do not take issue with reddit's banning of subs like /r/fatpeoplehate, especially as they allow things like /r/fatlogic to exist.

What I have heard about Australian censorship of games goes far beyond what I'm experiencing in Germany.  Valve (Steam) are lazy fucks who don't want to implement proper age verification, which would allow them to sell uncensored games to German customers. Other online shops do it. Post-Ident and other methods are used. It's official, not a shady corner phenomenon, even if Valve keeps claiming the opposite: Not only have I seen such shops, I also mailed our authorities twice about this, both times they confirmed what I'm claiming here.  Uncensored games can not be advertised in Germany and need to be bought with adult-age verification. There are probably also actually banned games, think e.g. of one where you'd be a kiddie porn producer, having actual clips and such in the game, but I think that wouldn't fly in almost every country, anyway."

The press is regulated by the law of Germany as well as all 16 States of Germany.  The most important and sometimes controversial regulations limiting speech and the press can be found in the Criminal code:   Insult is punishable under Section 185. Satire and similar forms of art enjoy more freedom but have to respect human dignity (Article 1 of the Basic law). Malicious Gossip and Defamation (Section 186 and 187). Utterances about facts (opposed to personal judgement) are allowed if they are true and can be proven. Yet journalists are free to investigate without evidence because they are justified by Safeguarding Legitimate Interests (Section 193). Hate speech may be punishable if against segments of the population and in a manner that is capable of disturbing the public peace (Section 130 [Agitation of the People]), including racist agitation and antisemitism. Holocaust denial is punishable according to Section 130 subsection 3. Membership in or support of banned political parties (Section 86). Currently banned parties include the SRP and the KPD, but historically all non-Nazi parties have been banned (1933–1945). Dissemination of Means of Propaganda of Unconstitutional Organizations (Section 86). Use of Symbols of Unconstitutional Organizations (Section 86a). Items such as the Swastika or clothing of the FDJ is banned. Disparagement of the Federal President (Section 90). the State and its Symbols (Section 90a). Insult to Organs and Representatives of Foreign States (Section 103). Rewarding and Approving Crimes (Section 140). Casting False Suspicion (Section 164). Insulting of Faiths, Religious Societies and Organizations Dedicated to a Philosophy of Life if they could disturb public peace (Section 166). Dissemination of Pornographic Writings (Section 184).   Outdoor assemblies must be registered beforehand.  Assemblies at memorial sites are banned.  Individuals and groups may be banned from assembling, especially those whose fundamental rights have been revoked and banned political parties.  The Love Parade decision (1 BvQ 28/01 and 1 BvQ 30/01 of 12 July 2001) determined that for an assembly to be protected it must comply with the concept of a constituent assembly, or the so-called narrow concept of assembly whereby the participants in the assembly must pursue a common purpose that is in the common interest.

That being said, when you can't down-vote things that you don't like it makes the community stronger by default. Only the most liked content makes it to the front page and if you don't like something you have the option to voice your opinion in the comments.  By using comments it opens discussion about the content rather than anonymous down votes that remove it from other peoples view. BUT. Comments can be up and down voted.  If you choose to not leave a comment, you can do that as well. It's up to you.   User interaction is immediate. You post a comment and it happens in real time, no page reloads and waiting around. You post it and it's there. You can try it here. http://www.pushdup.com/posts/xcfrHyHP4bL2pqnKZ   We are still working out the kinks and bugs so if you have any input just let me know.   Thanks for giving me a few minutes out of your day."
RedditAlternatives,3a5ye9,unique616,3,Wed Jun 17 16:06:13 2015 UTC,"Some of the volunteer moderators on reddit have too much power.  If you break a rule on one subreddit, you're supposed to be banned in just that subreddit, but there are quite a few users who are Mr. Popularity and moderate hundreds of subreddits. They can extend your ban to a huge part of reddit!  There's also no system to force them to step down so if you, or even the majority, don't like the way they moderate, there's nothing you can do about it. You can try to make your own subreddit, but as a hypothetical example, if you tried to tell people about funny2 on funny, the mods on funny would likely immediately ban you for trying to steal their user base! Plus funny is too good of a great subreddit name and so well established that funny2 will never surpass funny.  Sometimes the top mod or mods lose their enthusiasm. At one time they cared about funny but now they don't and really should hand over ownership to someone else who can take things to the next level, but they don't because logging in and seeing that they control a million accounts strokes their ego too much!"
RedditAlternatives,3a5ye9,Ninja_Fox_,2,Wed Jun 17 17:18:44 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you, that's why we have a handful of loyal and trustworthy engineers and community curators to help with that kind of thing.

RedditAlternatives,3a14xh,commeta_plugin,3,Tue Jun 16 12:21:55 2015 UTC,Seems like a cool idea! If it takes off it could totally create some really interesting experiences and sub-cultures.
RedditAlternatives,3a14xh,LpSamuelm,3,Tue Jun 16 13:41:06 2015 UTC,"I've left something in this Reddit discussion.  Some ideas:   Verified accounts: create a login to verify names. People can still leave comments as a guest and choose any name, but only verified accounts are bolded or something. Maybe a profile page, too? Notifications: maybe a ! when new comments have been created on a page you've commented on."
RedditAlternatives,3a14xh,NiKva,2,Wed Jun 17 03:14:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for checking it out - having verified accounts and notifications are both on the list of things to add.  Up and down voting of individual comments is a feature being worked on as well.  Any and all feedback is welcome!
RedditAlternatives,3a14xh,igotshadowbanned2,2,Thu Jun 18 10:28:26 2015 UTC,We need to share this with anyone who's been shadowbanned!
RedditAlternatives,3a14xh,ReccuringExtra,2,Thu Jun 18 17:14:48 2015 UTC,"Cool. Some random nitpicks, in case whoever made it is reading this thread: the terms and conditions have the whole vague ""hateful and harassing speech is banned"" spin that could really turn out bad in case the admins get power-hungry if this explodes in popularity. Also, swearing is censored for some reason. And although this could be a problem unique to me, but the amount of extensions I have on chrome is like a hooker with a bunch of tattoos, so adding more makes me worry for the future of my RAM and it would serve well to make it a website instead, although IDK how that'd work in the end. Having a button/icon next to the omnibox (like a lot of other extensions) that opens up the thread would also be better than the element that potentially blocks website buttons or links that it has now, and that way you could also alert notifications like someone replying. I feel like quick commentary like this would also be better suited for a chat room than a slower reddit-type thread, but I know this is /r/redditalternatives so then it wouldn't fit here.  Overall, the concept is really cool & probably the most unique thing here, but it wish it could be implemented better.  EDIT: Another thing I just noticed: If you have RES and are commenting on a reddit page, the 'use subreddit style' text bleeds through the widget."
RedditAlternatives,3a14xh,ReccuringExtra,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:37:08 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for the feedback, I'm glad I checked back! Your 'nitpicks' are excellent points and I agree the terms look overly heavy, I don't see any alternative unless we can find a hosting provider that is resilient to future SJW attacks (which are sure to come eventually).  The scripting is as lightweight as possible, we've run it with dozens of open tabs and it only adds ~2% memory load at most.  This is one of the benefits of being mostly just text rendering.  The biggest hurdle right now is adoption - we need more people using it.  For anyone else reading this, give it a try and feel free to comment / suggest / and nitpick as much as possible."
RedditAlternatives,3a0ddr,Killswitch35,14,Tue Jun 16 06:15:09 2015 UTC,I use reddit is fun for about half of my time spent on reddit. That being said I think having an open API to the site might be more important than actually making the app yourselves.
RedditAlternatives,3a0ddr,seanhead,5,Tue Jun 16 16:29:45 2015 UTC,I second this. And also just make sure the site displays well on mobile.
RedditAlternatives,3a0ddr,NotFromReddit,8,Tue Jun 16 19:53:01 2015 UTC,"A good app would probably be the tipping point, at least for me. I mean, who doesn't use reddit when taking a dump?"
RedditAlternatives,3a0ddr,dencrypt,9,Tue Jun 16 10:33:41 2015 UTC,I only use reddit mobile anymore (reddit sync) so it would make a huge difference for me.

RedditAlternatives,3a0ddr,incredulitor,3,Sat Jul 4 17:06:19 2015 UTC,"The lack of an app is a deal breaker for me. The vast majority of my reddit interactions occur through relay for reddit, and before that through reddit now. If I'm at a computer, chances are I'm working or watching a movie, so mostly no reddit there. The lack of reddit alternatives is the main reason why I'm still on reddit...that plus some very strong interest specific subreddits."

RedditAlternatives,39y033,Flux159,3,Mon Jun 15 18:40:18 2015 UTC,"I like slicer, but I think that a relevant minus (which Voat has, too) is that the URLs are cryptic. Example:  http://slicer.io/scenes/919fa516-0012-4a50-b8dc-62d6e2083b3c  On reddit, this would have been something like  http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAlternatives/comments/12x345/so_who_else_is_here_avoiding/ [fake link]  Voat example URL:  http://voat.co/v/fatpeoplehate/comments/129158  So, you see that the slicer URLs give a lot less useful information, which is an important factor if you consider long-term use and use by tens of thousands of people.  Still, as an alternative I like Voat and then slicer the most."
RedditAlternatives,39y033,king_of_the_universe,2,Tue Jun 16 07:30:11 2015 UTC,So an interesting thing about this: Reddit only uses the number before the title part to retrieve the correct comment thread. I think that the title must just be something for search or analytics. An example is this thread itself: http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAlternatives/comments/39y033/thanks_rredditalternatives/ and http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAlternatives/comments/39y033/thanks_r/ both go to the same page for me.   I think I could add something similar fairly easily and will definitely consider it for the nicer links (note that slicer itself uses uuid keys - which are much longer than reddit or imgur keys - its something that I've been considering to change). I'm sure that voat.co could do the same thing with adding titles to their urls.
RedditAlternatives,39y033,king_of_the_universe,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:56:34 2015 UTC,"That's good. I wished Imgur would introduce something like this. I mean, they could allow us to add a bit of ""arbitrary"" (filename-compatible) text on top of the unique image file name."

RedditAlternatives,39vdxp,Adam24,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:31:54 2015 UTC,"The ""add post"" process is weird: First, you choose the ""subreddit"" in a form, but you can also enter a custom name that doesn't exist yet. (Btw., I don't have an account / wasn't logged in.)  Then you click ""go"" and get a form as we're used to it from reddit, but there, too, you can still choose the ""subreddit"" in just the same way. The second form uses the URL of the chosen ""subreddit"", even if it was an imaginary one.  This seems like unnecessary interface overhead.  At least the site apparently supports links and alternatively text posts, like reddit. That's a good concept. (The submission form explains this. There are no text posts on the frontpage at the moment.)"

I'm on my phone so I'm going to copy a comment I left yesterday in response to someone:  The theory is that instead of following topic-based subreddits and getting whatever the herd votes to the top, you follow specific users that you respect/enjoy and end up with higher quality discussion AND links (typically any given users has a small domain of interests that end up loosely mirroring topical subreddits...like 'technology, music, and biking' for example. You still don't miss out on the main stories of any given discipline in a news cycle, but you do end up with somewhat more serendipitous discovery as a user's tertiary and more obscure interests are revealed into your feed. But Hubski also lets you follow (and block) things like tags and domains themselves, so it's not exactly like long form Twitter imho."

I'm interested in seeing how well Hubski scales just because of its different ""sharing"" (like tumblr and twitter) system instead of the voting system, and only ""upvote"" voting for comments.  The upvote/downvote system definitely breaks down after a certain point because humans just think of it as a ""I agree with what you said, like what you said, or your post was a funny three word joke/pun"" and not a ""your post was relevant to and expanded upon the conversation"" for upvotes, and the opposite for downvotes."

Individuals can block other individuals, but in doing so, it shadowbans you from participation on a thread created by the person that blocked you.

Of course I like to be upvoted, but the reason is 1) if I wrote/posted something that I believe in, it tells me ""They agree."" or ""They are sane."" or ""I effected something positive instead of working for nothing."" and 2) disapproval comes with the energy of ""Your whole mind is wrong."", an experience I try to avoid.

Here is my answer to that same question from the discussion thread:   I want to provide a completely open platform that is #1 really easy to use, and #2 allows the freedom for users to decide exactly what content they want.  I think it will be ""better"" because the focus of the site is on crafting a great user experience for just a platform, and not trying to unify everyone across all walks of life. Think a mix of the freedom between reddit and 4chan, but wrapped in a pretty and usable box like facebook/twitter/etc are.  One of the main goals I'm trying to accomplish here is getting rid of the elements of a forum site such as reddit that breed hostility and drama among its users. I want to free users from these distractions so they can focus on posting and enjoying good content.   Does that answer your question?"

Limiting liability will come as a ToS explicitly stating what is acceptable, much like basically all sites that allow users to upload their own content.   Make sense?"

If people posting pics of child porn onto my servers would like to complain that the removal of their content is violating their free speech, then I will direct them to their local law enforcement to file a claim.  I think it will be difficult for people to ban together against a website for not allowing illegal activity, especially when explicitly stated through a ToS.

RedditAlternatives,39g4cr,JungleForestWoods,55,Thu Jun 11 17:20:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a long time user. When I first joined reddit it was because it quenched my thirst for intelligent and thoughtful discussion. I could tap on a source of people much smarter than me, even authorities on their own respective fields, to learn about important subjects.  The trend in recent times is that the once valuable thought provoking topics that populated /all and /front have been replaced by memes and one-liner jokes. Nothing against them when dosed, but really annoying when abused. I now get my daily fix on /truereddit, /depthub or others.  In terms of the 'offensive' subreddits: These always existed since the beginning. I am extremely offended by some of the content posted in some subreddits, but it has always been my choice to ignore them. The recent drama with Pao and her inconsistent banning criteria is that it seems to me another expression of the Political Correctness trend that floods modern media - joined with the 'constant desire of being offended' impression that modern US social dynamics suggest.  I cannot agree more with /u/BetterJosh wrote: ""This entire ""victim culture"" is absolutely poisonous and it does nothing but further victimize those it intends to help.""   I'd love to feel same rush I used to feel with reddit in older days. Perhaps a smaller community will do the trick."

More and more the front page is dominated by the same boring memes and pictures. I can only take so many it's-funny-because-penis jokes before I start looking for another site to browse.  I appreciate reading different opinions, but reddit has become an echo chamber. The same ideas are repeated again and again spilling over into every subreddit. These opinions have their own ideas about what the opposing opinion is and anyone who challenges that is silenced (sent to the bottom of the comments).  Those are two things that irk me about the site, but there are more. I don't know if voat.co is a good alternative because a mass migration of the same people will bring about some of the same content problems.

I found reddit nearly a decade ago, when it was full of computer science geeks and informed discussion on a wide range of topics, generally an older crowd more willing to be non-combative even if a topic was in their area of expertise.  Now, the signal to noise ratio has become untenable as a place of real discussion, from my perspective.  For the demographic it now serves - high school and college students - this is not just not a problem, but a solution.  They need a forum where they can spread their wings, argue, explain unnecessarily, drill into pedantic counterpoint for its own sake.  I really do see the value in that.  But I'm done with it in this scope.  I only have so much time.  How much of my life could I spend correcting grammar; explaining how this picture is fake, and that one is real, for what reasons; what so-and-so's philosophy means, and why semantics are so contentious...?  At some point I want a group of people to inform my experience without having to prove who they think they are.  Polite dissent, cogent correction, a mutual respect for each others' goals.  At this point, I get more satisfaction from the discussion on IRC.  If I wanted political correctness, endless diversion from the point, and empty regurgitation from what a college student just learned from ethics or South American history class, I'd have leapt from AOL or MySpace to Facebook and stayed there.  I'll return to IRC till I or reddit find the right balance again."

I'm sick of getting downvoted for making a comment that I feel is an insightful or quality comment because someone disagrees with me.  I've been downvoted for answering questions on topics I'm very familiar with and I know are correct.  Not to mention attempting anything close to critically analyzing anything that goes against the hivemind.  I've made a few posts making what I feel are valid points about Bernie Sanders and have been downvoted heavily for them because they aren't posts gushing with support.

The big irony here - this safe-space protect-your-feelings gestapo that's sure to only get worse here on Reddit (like it is in real life) is a direct result of the hivemind's very own ideology.  It's what they vote for in real life, and it's what they upvote here on Reddit.  It is the belief that you can protect freedom by restricting it, that you can promote the exchange of ideas by filtering out what hurts your feelings, that you can do no wrong as long as its for the greater good, that the collective is more important than the individual.  Reap what you sow, and bathe in the knowledge that you are your own undoing.  Accept responsibility for your bastard child, for it is all grown up and doing exactly what you taught it to do.

Actually, I very nearly didn't comment at all, and this is wonderfully indicative of my (our) point. But you know what? I'm not part of the problem; I'm a symptom of the problem. While my ""knows a lot about his particular field guy"" account gets a fair amount of use, I find the tone on this site pushing me more and more into using this, my ""fight the power by making fun of everything guy"" account. After all, why should I make an effort to be serious, earnest, and thoughtful when those things aren't rewarded, and are often punished?

By letting the powers that be start blocking/repressing content of obvious bad things (FPH), the users won't notice when they start blocking what they don't like. Suddenly one day we won't be able to link to competing link aggregation sites, and the users will be to blame for letting Admins think this kind of action is tolerable."

I don't see why /r/fatpeoplehate should be banned but not /r/rape or /r/coontown. Sure /r/fatpeoplehate ""lashed out"" on somebody, but damn why should it even exist in the first place. The whole place is a goddamn hive mind that is constantly referencing how shitty everybody else is. Lately, I have just found going on reddit literally as masturbation and self-destruction. Sometimes both.  EDIT: Also every ""hurr durr Jenny,"" ""FUCK /R/FUNNY'"" and ""lol nazi/cum(item)/broken arms joke"" are really FUCKING ANNOYIG.

RedditAlternatives,39g4cr,yoni0505,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:48:31 2015 UTC,"Because moderators of certain big (subjective) sub-reddit just act like dictators. I am talking specifically  about /r/India where the moderators have their affiliations with certain political ideologies and severely curtail the voice of others. The new moderators who have been selected  all follow the same ideology and a few are guilty of breaking the Reddit policies when it comes to personal abuse.  Discussing the moderation policies is against the rules, users can only PM the mods which they largely ignore. I had created a topic  with following text after one user was banned for so-called ""shit posting"".  There were a number of other users belonging to same political ideology as the moderators posting worse and the worse they receive is an occasional deletion of posts. and was banned within minutes.  Following was text of my post:   Can anyone, preferably from the moderator's team make clear how the bans are handed out ? I get that the abusive posters are banned in addition to multiple accounts, fake accounts, spammers, hate speech etc. But is this policy applied impartially to all ? For example, one user account was banned for so called ""shit posting"".Link - http://i.imgur.com/FGWWyZ7.jpg?1 But in another thread about arrest of minister, an AAP supporter is posting nearly same comments multiple times, but no action has been taken against him.  As someone who has managed a few internet forums in the past, this sub-reddit comes out as one with most baffling moderation policies which can't be criticised in public. Laughably, only way of disputing a ban or post deletion is a private message to mods. Public criticism or questioning leads to another ban. In above case, I can't reveal identity of AAP shit-poster because it's against Reddit policies. OK not this sub-reddit rule. This account of mine will probably be banned too for posting this topic, but it hardly matters."

I've been using linkibl.com and it's more in line with what I like, more serious topics and discussions and disagreements are polite. I personally share a lot of content from tumblr (funny videos and articles on amazing artists) and some subreddits like /r/MedievalHistory, /r/science, various art subreddits, /r/ancientegypt, /r/animalrights, /r/tdih, /r/Documentaries and /r/vegan among others. I'm interested in history, news and educational topics so that's mostly what I share. Low-quality content such as gifs, memes, links to other communities within the site, etc aren't banned but probably won't get marked as interesting by that many people. I like that you can post in multiple topics at once by simply tagging your post so i don't have to see if each topic has its own community and post it there."

Will he get investors or just sell to someone else altogether? He has to do something quick because he doesn't run ads and his hosting bill is now going through the roof."

RedditAlternatives,39cuvk,muskegthemoose,59,Thu Jun 11 03:31:06 2015 UTC,I think you severely underestimate how much of the community this is pissing off.  It's not just fat haters or racists.  It's people who want a free speech forum.  Which is what reddit used to stand for.
RedditAlternatives,39cuvk,leshake,29,Thu Jun 11 03:45:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even say that its about freedom of speech here. Personally, I don't expect freedom of speech on reddit. What is pissing my the fuck off is the lack of continuity in enforcing rules. If reddit were actually banning behavior, FPH certainly would not have been the first to go."
RedditAlternatives,39cuvk,Orchid-Chaos_is_me,6,Thu Jun 11 04:37:43 2015 UTC,"You've pretty much nailed the problem. It's one thing if there's a website rule or two that get added that you disagree with, it's another entirely if it's a clear agenda being enforced."
RedditAlternatives,39cuvk,Sybarith,5,Thu Jun 11 06:42:16 2015 UTC,"I never thought reddit had ""free speech"".  A user could be downvoted which severely limits the amount of posts they could make, or banned from posting altogether in a given sub, by other users in the first case, and mods (who are users) in the second. Dissent is discouraged very effectively.  As for the amount of users they will lose, I'll give management the benefit of the doubt and assume they had a pretty good idea of the number and type of user they would drive away, and are good with that. Time will tell. I'm thinking that they will drive away lots more users before they're done, in an effort to make more money from ads."

But if we're banning subreddits we disagree with that aren't breaking any laws, I'm leaving. I'm very against all forms of hate, but I'm also very against unnecessary censorship."

RedditAlternatives,39cuvk,chaz_chazington,15,Thu Jun 11 00:49:18 2015 UTC,Originally known as the Slashdot effect
RedditAlternatives,39cuvk,synfin80,10,Thu Jun 11 02:04:59 2015 UTC,"Slashdot effect:       The Slashdot effect, also known as slashdotting, occurs when a popular website links to a smaller site, causing a massive increase in traffic. This overloads the smaller site, causing it to slow down or even temporarily become unavailable. The name stems from the huge influx of web traffic that would result from the technology news site Slashdot linking to websites. However the name is somewhat dated as flash crowds from Slashdot were reported to be diminishing as of 2005 due to competition from similar sites.  The effect has been associated with other websites or metablogs such as Fark, Digg, Drudge Report, Imgur, Reddit, and Twitter, leading to terms such as being Farked or Drudged, being under the Reddit effect, or receiving a ""hug of death"" from the site in question.   Google Doodles, which link to search results on the doodle topic, also result in high increases of traffic from the search results page.  Typically, less robust sites are unable to cope with the huge increase in traffic and become unavailable – common causes are lack of sufficient data bandwidth, servers that fail to cope with the high number of requests, and traffic quotas. Sites that are maintained on shared hosting services often fail when confronted with the Slashdot effect.

The concept of Tiger Mother or Tiger Parent has been widely depicted in international media, including films such as Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971), The Joy Luck Club (1993), Vitus (2006), and most recently in a book written by Yale law professor Amy Chua describing herself (2011).

RedditAlternatives,39fbwu,slithek,2,Mon Jun 15 21:35:43 2015 UTC,"Whoops, forgot about the inline styles vs CSS file: I am using CSS only for a small subset of styles (along w/ pseudo classes like :hover, :active, :focus, :visited). This allows the CSS file loaded to be fairly small (6kb gzipped for the site). The rest of the styles are inline because I'm essentially following this: https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js  I'm not using react, but I built my own lightweight component framework that is very similar to react and defining styles as part of components makes it very easy to reuse the entire component in a completely different project simply by moving the js file. It also has the added benefit of allowing me to define styles as JS objects and modify them easily using all the control structures of a real programming language.  If you want to know more, just let me know (there's a lot of stuff that I can talk about after I built my own JS framework - I'll open source it when I have time)."

One of my complaints about a lot of reddit content is that in the last couple years it's become bland. And /r/TrueReddit goes too far to the other end of the spectrum trying to be too intelligent. (It's a good diversion when looking for long-form articles, but it can't be a standalone replacement). So far SS seems like a good collection of material that is interesting snippets, instead of ""rehashed banal trite"" that seems to plague most of reddit.  Just a few complaints..   I don't like the ""$"" in the name Stack$ity. Makes it feel less homey and more ""I want to earn money off of you"" Too hard to sign up to multiple sub-stacks. You have to click on each one, follow, go back to the master list, and repeat. Of course, none of the subs seem to be populated yet, so it could be a low priority Per above: almost zero activity outside the defaults. Technews with 4 followers? Same with Documentaries? Needs more users / activity."

Subscribe to stacks controlling your front page, upvote, downvote, hierarchical comments. Seems to me it just needs a few little improvements here and there and some more users and it would be pretty damn good.  It does concern me that I can't find anything about an API though. Either they haven't thought about it, or haven't documented it.  CPU seems to spike sometimes on that page too. Reddit maxes at 3-5% for me; typing a post on Stacksity was sitting around 40% on a Macbook Pro."
RedditAlternatives,39dqa0,88MilesPrower,3,Thu Jun 11 10:39:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's because this is the only one I had heard of before the Reddit exodus that may or may not blow over, but i'm really hoping Stacksity takes off. The idea of having the equivalent of subreddits but also being able to follow users creates a very interesting type of environment. My biggest issue with Tumblr is that you can only really follow users which means that your feed is cluttered with all sorts of things you don't want to see, especially heavily politically charged items. A format like Reddit means you can subscribe to certain topics and ideas, but then you also miss out on people, and following individual people like you can on Tumblr can expose you to new information and ideas faster. I'm really curious to see how Stacksity is going to evolve, because I have a feeling that the cultures of Tumblr, Reddit, and other semi-anonymous social media sites formed large in part due to the way information is shared. I'm also curious to see if either stacks or userstacks fall to the wayside eventually because the community heavily favors one or the other.  Stupid question: Is there a way to make the comments open in the same tab like Reddit?"
RedditAlternatives,39dqa0,Killswitch35,3,Thu Jun 11 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the amazing feedback, definitely appreciate it sincerely. Hopefully Stacksity can address niches better.

RedditAlternatives,39dqa0,Killswitch35,9,Thu Jun 11 14:58:25 2015 UTC,Its reddit but with a different feed layout. The mobile version of reddit looks similar too.   I tried my best to emulate social media platforms like facebook and instagram to make it easier for the casual user to join in.
RedditAlternatives,39dqa0,ssladam,6,Thu Jun 11 03:29:26 2015 UTC,"To really take off you need to add new functionality. Even before digg imploded, reddit was siphoning users. Everyone blames digg for killing itself, but the truth was digg tried to change in an effort to stop the slow exodus. (Instead it hastened it). So why were people migrating? Compared to Digg, at the time, the reddit had the advantages of:   Pace. Digg you could visit at most 2-3 times a day to see a new frontpage. With Reddit you could come back frequently and pick up new content Discussion. On Digg you could comment, but it was more like the comments section at a news site. A flat stream of (often simpleminded) comments. Reddit's pseudo-forum system allowed much more dynamic conversations Feedback on your involvement. On Digg you felt like a casual observer. It was hard to feel how truly empowered. With reddit you could immediately see / feel the power of your upvote / downvote on posts and comments   So far it seems like your ""wow feature"" is the concept that every user is a stack. Okay, that's fine, but I don't see how that integrates into the ""bones"" of the site experience, and don't see that being a huge draw.  I tell you want would be the REAL ""wow factor"" that would get me excited...  Have a sort of netflix or amazon rating system automatically running in the background. Track the sort of articles that I upvote / downvote, and eventually you'll be able to place users into categories. And that category will adjust the scoring / ranking of the content I see.  So lets say I go to pics and always downvote people's dead pet stories, and always upvote natural landscapes. Overtime the site evaluates voting trends for related people and highlights that content, and lowers the ranking of content of people in other ""social brackets"".  Maybe call the site ""webcliques.com"". I like the idea because you can push the concept of involvement with the site. ""We improve what you see the more you vote!""."
RedditAlternatives,39dqa0,Killswitch35,8,Thu Jun 11 04:02:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions, and I appreciate them no doubt. The complexity of what you are suggesting is exactly what facebook does. The problem of this is that it devalues the power of one person's vote, since that isn't the be all end all factor anymore  I currently do have most of the Reddit ""wow features"" that you've mentioned. But yes, keep the suggestions coming. The user stack thing is so that people can form social circles and have their own followings and such. This way there is still a degree of appeal to casual users. Some other features unique to stacksity:   every user is like a ""subreddit"", and users can make posts to each other, even privately. absolute value voting: -10 is the same as 10, meaning no burying controversial topics no moderators, only super admins to remove illegal content such as CP. This prevents mods from imposing too many rules on a stack (i.e. /r/politics), and lets the userbase decide how to take things minor: post numbers/comment numbers..taken from 4chan different simplified layout...way more like 9gag/instagram than reddit no vote manipulation - a vote is a vote"
RedditAlternatives,39dqa0,ssladam,3,Thu Jun 11 05:08:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, and on a site like the one I recommended the FPH debacle couldn't even happen. You don't like the stuff you see coming from FPH? Just downvote anything from there, and pretty soon with a 100% downvote you won't see a bit of material from there. And since you'll be lumped into that extreme category, if a post in another sub is being heavily upvoted by people that are huge fans of FPH, but being downvoted by people similarly against FPH... you won't see those posts either.  ALSO... it limits the ""gaming the system"" people can do. On reddit you can create a small army of accounts to upvote your submissions. Try that on the cliques site? You may end up gaming a subsection of material, but since you'll be quickly put into a narrow clique and you won't be able to spam the entire community."

RedditAlternatives,39dzp1,TweetsInCommentsBot,7,Fri Jun 12 07:38:04 2015 UTC,I just downloaded Aether and it's great but kind of low-population. I suspect it's because a lot of reddit/social is done from mobile phones and it seems to be a python/qt desktop app only at the moment.  I'm sure if we got a few thousand users on it would be a blast and someone would end up porting it since it's on github.

RedditAlternatives,39dzp1,itsfreedomstupid,11,Thu Jun 18 10:00:54 2015 UTC,"why is this bad? Time and time again has proven that moderation is only useful when you have good mods. Good mods are invariably good at other things in life and will give up modding for earning a living. This leaves you with SJW's and other keyboard warriros of the ilk to ruin communities. Let communities vote on things, with older community members votes carrying more weight for example, would be better and it combats eternal summer a little bit."

RedditAlternatives,39erzx,king_of_the_universe,2,Thu Jun 11 08:13:31 2015 UTC,"Looks good, simplicity is great, and because of that, I find the speech-bubble symbol questionable. I see that if a post doesn't have comments, there's no bubble, if it has 1 comment (or very few?), it has a bubble, and if it has several (like 16), it has a double-bubble :P  Personally, I feel that this symbol is unnecessary visual clutter that negatively affects the visual style. Less is more, and the symbol imho doesn't inform enough to be worth the price.  Directly before the symbol's place, there's a text saying ""no comments"", ""1 comment"", or ""16 comments"". I think the visual symbol that ""no"" vs ""1"" vs ""16"" etc. directly at the left end of the visual block of a list entry effectively is already fulfills the bubble's purpose perfectly."

It is a privately owned website and, as such, doesn't have to guarantee you the right to freedom of speech. If you are so outraged that you no longer have a place to harass fat people then maybe you and all your mature friends should find somewhere else to be totally enlightened and wise."
RedditAlternatives,39et2l,LookITriedHard,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:19:58 2015 UTC,"Till now you've been receiving the benefit of the doubt, but either you're trolling - you're most likely trolling - or, and I pity you if this is the case, you actually believe what you're saying. I'm still going to respond as if someone could have typed your long, conjecture-filled, rambling statement with the honest intent to argue.   Most of reddit isn't even american, so a single country's amdnement hardly is in question.   Now I'll admit here I got you mixed up with this other wacky bastard who said this, ""It's a god damned foundation of democratic society, if someone wants to infringe on people's rights just because they feel offended then they are the real threat."" So hopefully you'll see where I was coming from there.   you think defending open speech must mean I support harassing fat people   I allowed myself a moment's speculation, but I could be wrong and you might be some other variety of asshole.   I'm here to tell you that you just said a ton of nonsense and not at any point did you make a rational statement or anything even resembling a rational thought. be more hyperbolic than anyone else has ever been at any point through history, in fact it's shocking that I'm going at it this hard with any expectation that anyone could ever possibly believe that I believe what I'm saying.   That's what you sound like right now. ^   everyone for open discussion/speech like founders of reddit must have been supporting hating fat people and you want nothing more than to ban everyone who displeases you - got it   Show me where I advocate bans. All I've done so far has been entertain both sides of the discussion about free speech and open discussion. I have argued that their are unsavory aspects to it but never have I actually advocated censorship like you insist that I have. I have merely commented on the quandary. I have already stated that I'm not posing any solution to what I consider the unsavory side of free speech. (other than people should stop going out of their way to be assholes)   from everyone who was here during original few years of reddit, fuck you and you should leave first with your middle school classmates.   Hilarious conjecture. A 7 month old account accusing a 4 y.o. account of being a middle schooler. Even if I were currently twelve that would mean I was one savvy as fuck eight year old when I signed up.   I'm defending the right of people to open discussion on a website originally created for this reason where being offended doesn't matter as it shouldn't in a mature conversation.   You're being very noble and ascribing nobility to everyone out there who might be silenced by the removal of a handful of radical subreddits, but the right to open discussion does not extend to unlawful, harmful acts that the subreddits banned were accused of.    You're defending silencing all opposition until your view is the only view and people like you ruined reddit.   I've already touched on this, but no I'm not.   but that's only because there is no rational reasoning that can possibly defend your position.   My position really has only been that of Devil's Advocate. The way you repeatedly lay claim to rationality and make sweeping generalizations about everyone who disagrees with you is not effective rhetorical form.  People always jump to point out the nobility or intellectual merit of expression. But many of its proponents primarily use free speech for inane and injurious purposes, and, in these cases, I can't help but think that it is anything more than a child crying because he fears his license to bully may be revoked.  I understand the problem with the moving target of acceptable speech and I acknowledge that many people try to weaponize taking offense to shut down legitimate discussions. But for me true nobility is not congratulating every jerkoff who can ejaculate nonsense verbally and holding their acerbic psychic load in higher esteem than the person it impacted. To rationally build a case for censorship one would need only look at cases of cyberbullying which have lead to suicides in young children. (for me the answer to this question would probably place impetus on the parents to limit internet access but still one could rationally argue that a life is more worth defending than the right to flippantly aggrieve strangers anonymously.)  At the very least I hope you'll at least consider that the issue may not be 100% black and white. That's really all I've been advocating."

The mentality today is I shouldn't have to even worry about ""X"", someone else take care of it.  I'm not saying everyone is like this, but there are a lot of people out there that do this kind of stuff.    It always makes me think of the people who shout ""YOUR RIGHTS END WHERE MINE BEGIN"", completely ignorant to the fact that it cuts back on them, and it's barely a real statement to begin with.  People have the right to not be around guns.  But that right means you don't have to be where the guns are.  These idiots think that all guns should go away so they can go wherever they want, ignoring the fact it is taking other people's rights away.

Some people think that people who belong to gun clubs are getting together to plan murders, because ""why else are they meeting?"".  Much in the way some people think that programs like AA or NA don't help and make things worse, because it's just alcoholics and addicts meeting with other alcoholics and addicts, and that nothing gets accomplished.   EDIT : I'm a recovering addict.  I go to NA.  I actually have that chance to show other people how I have managed to stay clean.  not everyone does.  Hell, only 10% even ever stick around.

These exceptions have been created over time, based on certain types of speech and expression, and under different contexts. While freedom of speech in the United States is a constitutional right, these exceptions make that right a limited one.  Restrictions that are based on people's reactions to words include both instances of a complete exception, and cases of diminished protection. Speech that involves incitement, false statements of fact, obscenity, child pornography, threats, and speech owned by others are all completely exempt from First Amendment protections.

As someone who uses reddit almost exclusively on mobile myself, I am somewhat disappointed, but at the same time I understand what they're saying.   Dissenting opinion: the users of mobile apps have a trifecta of bad habits:   mobile usage promotes quick consumption of media; memes, images, gifs, rather than long-form posts and thoughtful debates; mobile usage makes it prohibitively difficult to compose long comments, and even more difficult to include citations and external links in it; I have the impression that users who connect via desktops and laptops tend to be professionals taking a break, rather than kids in school.   I also claim that when mobile usage got popular the average post quality on Reddit started to rapidly decline. It's possibly coincidental (and happened around the Digg exodus), but I am quite certain that mobile users are more casual almost by definition. You just can't contribute too deeply to a community when you're limited to a mobile device and have the time constraints of walking, waiting in line, sneaking a peak at your phone in class, sitting in the bathroom, etc."

RedditAlternatives,3810hc,Razkan,12,Wed Jun 10 20:08:28 2015 UTC,"It kinda makes sense but it's just silly. I'm sure anyone can write long comments with citations and external links via mobile. It's not that difficult if you want to do it. Hell, I've done it before.  Plus, as it is right now, Voat is hardly the bastion of intellectual debate/discussion. It's literally being overrun by users from the banned subs and many of the subverses are similar to Reddit's ""instant gratification"" subs like /r/funny and its ilk.  It's just silly to me that some Voat users think it's this great new website that's too good to have a mobile app."
RedditAlternatives,3810hc,MeOfAllTrades,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:18:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sure people take time to post well thought out and cited comments from their phones, but I think the main point is that the majority of users don't.   I am sure mobile apps will continue to crop up for these alternatives, and as they do I'm sure the user generated content will become a bit more image/meme centered. Honestly thats all fine with me. The majority of the reason I'm looking for something new is that I want something less censored. With the downturn reddit has been taking lately its just time to move on.   I understand why the instant gratification subs are there, and I expect them to be cause they're nice to visit to kill time or just when less popular subs arent generating a lot of new comments, but I can decide not to see them if I want. I cant control seeing content that reddit is censoring from me for XYZ reasons."
RedditAlternatives,3810hc,Razkan,6,Wed Jun 10 20:41:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm the same. If Reddit wants to ban all hate filled subs then it better get consistent about it and ban every sub which participates in that sort of thing. Plus, racism is much more deplorable than poking fun at fat people on the Internet IMO.  I have high hopes for Voat but I dunno, it's not quite right. I have a feeling it'll basically be the same as Reddit in a few months with the same old power tripping mods, but with less censorship.   Also, the ""sharing of ad revenue"" with content providers sounds like a fishy avenue for inviting crafty spammers."
RedditAlternatives,3810hc,MeOfAllTrades,2,Wed Jun 10 21:00:31 2015 UTC,I'm right there with ya. I guess we'll just have to see where it goes.

RedditAlternatives,3810hc,Razkan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:44:14 2015 UTC,Versa is the oldest one and that's the one I'm using now. There's also Boat for Voat  and Vulcan.   There aren't really four. I slightly exaggerated. Vulcan and Versa are okay choices though. Hope that helps.

RedditAlternatives,3810hc,cruyff8,-6,Wed Jun 10 20:08:11 2015 UTC,"Why should you ask? I'll have a go at why you should insist on a site having an API even if you can't and don't want to utilise it:  You may not want to write your own app, but sites that have them (and consume them) tend to be more stable than sites that do not . A decent userbase ensures that signal exists. A decent userbase also ensures that I don't have to write my own Android/iOS/whatever app. Most importantly, having a decent-sized userbase ensures that the site is being used."

I recommend staying away from Hubski if you value actual discourse, however.  The terminology is a bit different, but to put it in reddit terms, hubski has a feature where if LobsterSlut decided he didn't like what I was saying about hubski in this thread he could prevent me from responding to you the way I am currently.  Some people value that sort of control, but you cannot have an honest discussion when one participant has more power in the conversation than the other.  And god have mercy on your soul if it's a popular poster, they'll call for everyone else to prevent you from posting in their threads too.  Basically, when reddit started growing the old hands started complaining about the young whippersnappers with no respect.  Thus was Hubski borne, and into that pit of control hath they gone."

RedditAlternatives,34mhmd,tylercoder,2,Wed May 6 13:31:35 2015 UTC,You prefer wide-scale censorship to criticism?   I use the more granular controls to weed out spam and trolls.

RedditAlternatives,34mhmd,zants,4,Sun May 3 02:04:11 2015 UTC,"Bingo. This is the problem with reddit alternatives. Nobody has found solutions for the problems which haunt reddit. Corrupt moderation, vote manipulation, brigades, shills, trolls, all the things people are bitching about don't have simple solutions. People have been looking for solutions for these problems for decades.   The beauty of reddit is that you don't even need to leave the site for an alternative. Unless you have a problem with reddit's 5 simple rules, you can create your own subreddit if you don't like the one you're visiting. Chances are, there's already a competing subreddit."

More power to them for their values, but at this point i'm deliberately thinking smaller scale to replace my procrastinating.  Hacker News is a great replacement for now but it has a specific audience. When it hits broad scale it'll be distracting and useless to Y Combinator, and then killed."

RedditAlternatives,34mhmd,syzo_,6,Tue Jun 16 11:17:14 2015 UTC,Hubski seems like an interesting contender. Some of their feature choices have put me off in the past (notably: the muting mechanism) but I'll probably check it out again in a while to see how it's working out.
RedditAlternatives,34mhmd,fangolo,2,Sat May 2 16:40:30 2015 UTC,"I think the muting mechanism is largely misunderstood. Whereas banning on reddit is across an entire topic, on Hubski muting is specific to comments on the posts of one user, and there is no ambiguity about it."
RedditAlternatives,34mhmd,mreiland,5,Sat May 2 17:10:55 2015 UTC,"In reddit terms Hubski allows the OP to decide who is and is not allowed to comment on the thread.  I mean, if that's what you value, be my guest.  But I personally could not stomach the idea of a random person online being able to completely shut me out of a discussion in which I had a differing opinion by muting me.  And I submit anyone who values such is an asshat."
RedditAlternatives,34mhmd,fangolo,-1,Sun May 3 09:32:00 2015 UTC,"I agree that anyone that mutes due to a difference in opinion is being an asshat.  However, mods here have far broader power to suppress a user, extending beyond one user's posts to an entire topic.  IMO the difference is that when OPs can demand civility in the comments on their post on Hubski, like on a blog, it changes the dynamic. I think you prefer Reddits moderation for that reason."
RedditAlternatives,34mhmd,mreiland,1 point,Sun May 3 11:55:11 2015 UTC,"moderators can demand civility in the comments of their subreddit, much like a moderator/owner can do on a blog (and that apparently changes the dynamic, who knew!).  Here's a weird observation.  I've never had a mod in subreddit for a topic prevent me from contributing in other subreddits for other topics.  But in hubski that's not only possible, it's by design.  reddit actually garners better discussion than Hubski, I've used both and that's a fact.  What Hubski gets you is a lot of navel gazing, and if that's what you're into, so be it.  Hubski is not really a place for people who want actual discourse, it's a place for people who want the perception of actual discourse.   You can't have a reasonable conversation when one of the participants has the power to completely shut down the other.  You just can't.  And making analogies between Hubski and blogs cannot change that."
RedditAlternatives,34mhmd,fangolo,0,Sun May 3 12:20:00 2015 UTC,"A mod can lock you out of all posts in a subreddit, regardless of who the OP is by shadowbanning.  But it's ok. Hubski is not for everyone. And we don't aspire to be a replacement for Reddit. Perhaps some aspects, but not all."
RedditAlternatives,34mhmd,mreiland,5,Sun May 3 12:25:08 2015 UTC,"Reddit:       locks you out of all discussions on a particular topic or area (aka subreddit)     does not affect your ability to have discussions on other topics or areas   Hubski:       Locks you out of all discussions started by a particular set of users and everyone involved in discussions with that set of users.     Directly affects your ability to have discussions on other topics or areas completely unrelated to the original discussion so you're forced to segregate discussions on unrelated topics or give up having conversations in/on these unrelated topics.       It's the same damned thing only flipped around and looked at sideways.  I mean, you're right, Hubski isn't for everyone.  It's for those who want to have more control over other people's conversations than reddit allows.  And sure, that's ok, to each their own.  But don't bill Hubski as something it isn't.  Hubski's popular users become de-facto mods and they have as little oversight as reddit mods.  Less if you consider that hubski was designed for these popular posters to be able to curate content for everyone who follows them."
RedditAlternatives,34mhmd,fangolo,3,Sun May 3 13:20:36 2015 UTC,A lot of users independently decided to mute you on Hubski. No doubt that made for a bad experience. It's true that doesn't happen here. People can judge by your comment history here whether or not that is a good or bad outcome.
RedditAlternatives,34mhmd,mreiland,3,Sun May 3 13:47:09 2015 UTC,"As far as I know only 2 people ever muted me on that site, you're just in marketing mode.  Hubski is for those who want to be able to take their toys and go home, Reddit is for those who enjoy honest to goodness interaction.  I mean, you're right, probably more did, one of the ones who muted me was both extremely popular and extremely open about recommending others do the same.  Which is the point being made here :)  A few de-facto mods on a site that encourages such behavior.  The amusing part?  I was muted by the really popular guy for complaining about the mute feature.  Whereas here, you can't stop me from having the opinion I do.  So for anyone considering Hubski, just be aware of what you're getting into.  Whereas in this conversation fangola can't stop me from voicing my dissenting opinion, On Hubski not only could he do so, if he's popular he can get others to do the same.  If that sounds like an environment you want to be in, have at it :)"

What I hate about StackExchange is that mods close almost anything thats even remotely off topic even if its highly popular and upvoted.   And Quora mods think your name might be fake? Banned. They said to just change my name but the website wouldn't let me and they said they did;t know why so I had to make  new account.  But reddit is the best of the three. The only thing Idont like is that it seems like your posts often gets lost in the swarm if you post the wrong time of the day.  Unfortunately I don't know of a real alternative to any of them.

RedditAlternatives,33kjey,greedo,7,Sat May 9 12:10:42 2015 UTC,"To me, Reddit's biggest problem is that it only has one ""dimension"" of rating things - just upvote or downvote. There's no way to say why you're up/downvoting, so there's no way to adjust what you see in any meaningful way. And everyone knows that it's not supposed to be used as an agree/disagree button, but everyone does it anyway.  For example, I've thought for some time that Reddit needs a ""clickbait"" button, so that it's possible to filter out clickbait sites once they pass a certain threshold. Or, it'd be nice to see actual agree/disagree buttons, so we can see how people feel about stuff. Or maybe there could be a up/downvote for funny/stupid comments, or thought-provoking/trolling comments, or whatever.  I guess my point is that there are a lot of things that could be done to clean up Reddit, but the people who run it seem content to keep it the way it is. (And why wouldn't they? It's pretty successful as it is.)"

Ummm you do realize that a ""child"" comment literally means that it's a reply to the 'parent' comment. This is standard tech lingo. My comment here (regardless of votes) is a child comment. And if you respond to me, that comment will be a child to this one.  Which is why there's a button ""hide child comments"".

There's no avoiding sub-par content, that's a part of life. But if you find subreddits relevant to your interests with a good culture then you're set.

Censoring stuff just opens the doors to the Admins choosing what is 'okay' to discuss, which leads to bias in terms of what the Admins think.

On the other hand, Jotflow focuses only on articles, which we call jots.  To categorize your jot, you may use whatever label you wish, including I-Just-Made-Up-This-Damn-Label. A label acts somewhat like a subreddit, thus allowing you to browse jots that interest you.  Being a publishing platform, each author, gets a blog-like flow page, which aggregates all his jots. Jots may contain links, images and youtube videos and more!  If you have even a slight interest in writing, in expressing yourself,  or in voicing your opinions, please visit Jotflow.com in your spare time.  You may love it, you may hate it, I hope you won't ignore it. I look forward to your feedback.  Cheers!  PS: I am one of the founders of Jotflow.com. If you have any questions, feel free to ask."

RedditAlternatives,2x9w89,fangolo,5,Fri Feb 27 02:28:24 2015 UTC,Have you checked out Hubski? We don't have moderators; each user is basically their own mod. https://hubski.com/primer  Let me know if you have any questions/thoughts.
RedditAlternatives,2x9w89,Josh_The_Boss,3,Fri Feb 27 14:24:46 2015 UTC,"Hubski is pretty cool. It's like G+ and Twitter combined, but without the garbage. I don't see any way to prevent brigading though."
RedditAlternatives,2x9w89,fangolo,3,Tue Mar 3 20:12:51 2015 UTC,"We had an influx of unrulies a couple of years ago, and they were pretty quickly isolated to their own sphere. As every Hubski user can filter out users that they don't want to see, and mute them on posts that they make, brigades get quickly isolated. They can freely interact with each other, and even carve out their own space on Hubski, but it's very difficult to disrupt users that don't want you about."
RedditAlternatives,2x9w89,xnaas,5,Wed Mar 4 19:18:28 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't that lead to worse behavior than Reddit? A poster could just prevent everyone who disagrees with them from posting, etc. and create the ultimate hive mind? I'm asking genuinely; not to be a dick."
RedditAlternatives,2x9w89,CashewGuy,3,Thu Mar 26 09:13:56 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much what happens. Hubski is very power-user heavy. If you don't share those opinions, you can't really participate in some of the larger tags."
RedditAlternatives,2x9w89,mreiland,2,Sun Mar 29 19:37:45 2015 UTC,"yep.  This is something the folks running hubski can't seem to understand.  The reason the power users wanted the mute feature in the first place is because it gave them so much power.  Reddit went through the exact same thing when the original users started complaining about those ""pesky new users"".  The difference is hubski cow-towed to them, reddit did not."
RedditAlternatives,2x9w89,fangolo,3,Sun May 3 09:40:12 2015 UTC,"You can't prevent someone from posting, or prevent anyone else from seeing their posts, you just don't see their posts yourself.  You can block (mute) commenters on your own posts (like someone with a blog). Of course, this can be abused, but it's usually self-correcting. If someone mutes commenters for simply disagreeing, many people will either not follow that user, or even filter their posts out. The most popular users are those with good posts and good discussion on them.  The damage caused by an overzealous muter is pretty limited when compared to a subreddit mod whose powers extend to everyone's posts on a topic. At most, they can ruin the discussion on their posts alone."
RedditAlternatives,2x9w89,xnaas,5,Thu Mar 26 13:39:12 2015 UTC,Far enough. I might check out hubski then. :D

The good news is that this is where the main differences begin.  Content on Linkibl is user driven and not curated by editors and moderators which is controlled by a news media company.    The algorithm engine driving the content is unique as our approach is different :)  Linkibl is all about giving the users the say in what is important with a huge twist, also giving users the ability to NOT see what they don't care about.   Linkibl's beauty is the approach on how it melds these concepts.  We are in alpha and the core is in place now and are adding more features as well as the amount of content will continue to increase.  I do appreciate the feedback and once you try it, I hope you can see how it differs :)  Cheers, Kurtis"

Isn't the point of the upvoted/downvote for public moderation?   It's dumb. I'm going over there. Abandoning Reddit; it's going to become another ghost town.

I've been fortunate throughout the years to have found good small communities with enthusiastic and dedicated members, and from that experience I can tell you that only about 200 people are needed to get fresh content and discussion each day.  But on reddit, not so much. You need 10000 people for it to stay alive and have fresh content each day. I don't know what could be done about it, but I do think that the mindset that subreddits are content folders is the biggest contributor to why people aren't enthusiastic about their subreddits.  Also you could x-post this to /r/subofrome and you might get some more opinions."

This doesnt need to be the case, a few large subreddits have managed to keep moderation in check. I think this is also fueled by the fact that on reddit the admins refuse to really intervene when you have a mod who isnt doing their job. So essentially just better mods and more admin oversight of mod activities."

Registered users who have posted or commented in the last X number of days are eligible to receive Y number of votes they can spend to vote on posts or comments. Whether eligible users receive votes or not depends in some form upon randomness. Unspent votes expire after a week. There is a cooling off period after an eligible user receives votes during which they can not be awarded any more votes. Comments should have a score ceiling, posts should not.   It should be somewhat similar to the Slashdot user moderation system, which is still IMO the gold standard amongst user moderation schemes. User moderation is never going to be perfect when dealing with a large number of users, but Slashdot's system makes the best of it I think. Unlimited voting is probably the worst solution."

I understand you follow individuals and what not. Fine for big topics and controversial issues (I get what you're saying about reducing the circle jerk). I do however  Frequent some if the niche subs with specific interest. How would you emulate that? Do users have to know all of the hashtags likely to be used for an interest?  Edit: I read your privacy policy which is pretty ""boiler plate"". But if leaves some questions.   Second , you've got my email with my login. How are you going to guarantee me you won't abuse it OR worse, lose it like so very many ""secure"" big sites.  How about logging, is read history stored or just post history? Edit: Deleting IP address details doesn't particularly anonymise data or access if it's tied to a username.   How about account deletion. What is deleted when I leave ? Can I take EVERYTHING with me and vanish?  Finally, how is your financial backing? Obviously end goal is to sell your product and IP, but what is the current arrangement and big players with a decent chunk? When you do sell refer to previous question about deleting my data.   I like the partial anonymity that reddit provides, not that I say anything controversial or particularly care. Just one less thing for users to think about, and one less vector for spam or identity leakage.   Still interesting site.   Edit: I'm not trying to bash you.

RedditAlternatives,2eoj8z,ryan_II,3,Wed Aug 27 00:46:47 2014 UTC,"I think an obvious addition would be a wiki page with a bunch of different options with a short description.  Perhaps there could be mod-sponsored discussion threads or something to talk about various problems of reddit, and ideal solutions? Or ideal generalized sites?  I'd like to see some discussion of non-specific-site alternatives as well. For example, let's say I wanted to replace my use of /r/worldnews specifically. RSS is a pretty good solution, but I'd need some sources to throw in to my reader, and news sites generally flood my reader with 200 news stories a day. Maybe someone could make a site that somehow aggregates all of the common news sites and picks out the top X stories per day/hour in some smart way, with links to all of the major sites to read the articles, and then enables RSS so I can throw it into my reader. Or, let's say I want to replace /r/electronicmusic, /r/futurebeats, or the like (just any genre) - Maybe there's some awesome source for new/hot music that has RSS enabled? We could make this a hub of interested coders to make these sorts of alternatives (I'm interested in helping make these, if more people are interested).  More discussion in general would be awesome, but I'm not sure you could just magically make that happen :)"

Also there's Google News of course.  For music, Spotify has auto-updating playlists, or there's apps that can meet those needs.  YouTube does as well.  SoundCloud also does, though it's obviously limited on artists and other things.  It's also the premise of Hype Machine.  There's tons of better alternatives for discovering things, there always has been.  Discovery has never been reddit's strong suite at all, it's always been about discussing those things.  I guess it's sort of irking how all of the alternatives above aren't aggregated into a single website, but I think their better quality makes up for it (and maybe we just need to rethink how we're consuming this stuff anyway)."

RedditAlternatives,2eoj8z,zants,2,Fri Sep 12 02:13:23 2014 UTC,"I agree with /u/syzo_, a regularly updated wiki that lists alternatives would be perfect (and maybe link to its dedicated topic on the subreddit where people can discuss it).  At the moment the list is small enough that you might even be able to just put a list in the sidebar.  Also, there needs to be stricter rules about reposting the same websites.  Looking through the few submissions, there's a lot of repeats (for Snapzu, Newsvine, and Hubski, for example).  One topic per website should be enough (the only reason I see another one being made is if the topic is too old and can't be commented on anymore).  Tags could help with organization, too.  Probably only really need one or two: something like ""Discussion"" (for meta-discussion on reddit, about the subreddit, etc.) and/or ""Alternative"" (for links to a new alternative website)."
RedditAlternatives,2c4y6f,codydodd,3,Wed Jul 30 12:59:34 2014 UTC,"Would this not give a reddit-alternative a huge advantage over reddit (helping facilitate the transfer of users) and with limited costs/risks?    I'm not sure, one of the advantages of reddit is actually anonymity. People are very keen not to give away their usernames.    How hard would it have to try to prevent a sort of 'facebook'-like experience where profiles matter a great deal?    Difficult to tell.    Would others use similar tools? (being able to follow the contributions of friends easier).    Not sure what you mean, like friends online or friends IRL? Again, one of the reasons reddit is popular is because people don't have to give up their identity. It allows them to be a lot more honest with their opinion, taking that away would be a big change.    What other social tools come to mind?*   Reddit has a really poor search feature. So creating a website that allows people to find stuff easier would definitely be a plus."

I was wondering if there could be better friends features but not make it too much of a big deal.  E.g., you could only follow a friend if they agreed perhaps?  and at that, it is just a side page to help you figure out what cool stuff some of your other peers follow and what subreddits you've overlooked, but not much more than that?  Anyway, thanks guys for the fantastic feedback!  It was an idea that really got us exciting for a few nights, and we knew no better subreddit to at least share it, for better or for worse."
RedditAlternatives,2c4y6f,syzo_,2,Sat Aug 2 20:53:09 2014 UTC,"Instead we meant just having the ability to follow friends easier, and read similar subreddits as them.

Most comment threads consist of the most ass-sniffing garbage one can come up with. Remember how everybody got mad because they could no longer us RES to see their up/down counts? That spoke volumes for what is actually going on with regards to how people are actually using this website. They were bitching up a storm because they could no longer use vote counts to TELL THEM whether or not a comment was seen positively or negatively by the reddit collective. It's insane. It's proof that the majority of users now view reddit as a social media game of sorts. For fuck sake, /r/circlejerk has lost its way entirely. A subreddit designed to SATIRIZE reddit has now become just another part of the circlejerk. The voting has to go. Otherwise nothing will change."

Focus on security (https always, tor hidden service available as well), transparency, no moderators : users can effectively ban another by downvoting them until they run out of points.. upvoting/downvoting isn't free (takes away your points) - I am hoping this will lead to only quality content being upvoted, and only truly shitty comments / posts being downvoted.  Big focus on ability to format your posts / comments well; code highlighting and markdown extra.. am hoping to get latex in there as well over the next few weeks!

RedditAlternatives,2b27lm,cowboyhaze,3,Sun Sep 7 18:38:17 2014 UTC,"The point system will cause problems. It greatly rewards karma whoring, which is one of the biggest problems on Reddit even though points are absolutely worthless.  Also, upvotes/downvotes shouldn't be equivalent to good/bad. Here's why: a conservative walks into /r/politics and starts giving well written and objective counter-arguments to what he considers to be weak opinions, and proceeds to predictably get flooded with downvotes. The user is then banned? Or punished in voting power? That's what will happen. Unfortunately people will spend their voting points defending and promoting their views, often at the expense of objectivity and overall discussion health. Having downvotes have actual power gives a much greater incentive to downvote what you don't want to hear to punish the other party. It lets people ""win"" any argument with the click of a button. It's the ultimate passive agressive dis, to see someone take a serious effort to discuss something you don't want to see (the anti-abortion viewpoint, pro israel/palestine, maybe a shred of credibility to the ISPs in the net neutrality debate), and then smile as it gets buried. Yes, people are like that, you see it on reddit all the time.  If the community starts with a good group of people who are open-minded and objective this won't be apparent, but if the site ever grows to a more realistic demographic which represents a cross-section of the average internet user, that comment system would kill the site very very fast and result in a cosmic level circlejerk where everyone who shares the same view is isolated from everyone else.  IMO, the ultimate problem that needs to be solved by Reddit (aside from moderation woes and viral marketing) is that there needs to be a way to promote objective discussion. A conservative who goes into /r/politics and provides a well thought but unpopular viewpoint on an issue should somehow be rewarded much higher than a regular bandwagoner who parrots the same group response to every topic. The karma system will probably be at the core of this solution, and it may need to look radically different from the (failed) system Reddit uses. Objectivity needs to be right at the core of a better Reddit alternative."
RedditAlternatives,2b27lm,ra66it,1 point,Fri Jul 18 23:55:44 2014 UTC,"That may be the case- but I think with how it is now (where if you downvote somebody OR upvote somebody you lose one point) that will stop the majority of minor disagreement votes.. most people aren't willing to downvote themselves just to downvote someone else if they think their idea is just somewhat dumb. You might be right though, its completely experimental and I have no clue if it will work.    The karma system will probably be at the core of this solution, and it may need to look radically different from the (failed) system Reddit uses. Objectivity needs to be right at the core of a better Reddit alternative.   I agree completely."

RedditAlternatives,290cwq,secretdeveloper,15,Tue Jun 24 23:10:44 2014 UTC,"Okay, lets do this.  Why does Reddit suck?   The frontpage doesn't represent the majority of subreddits. I can't browse to /r/toasterrights if I'm not logged in. Sure I can go directly to it, but I can't browse to it. The cycling sucks. Why do I have to wait 30 minutes to refresh my homepage list? Much better to let me decide when I want to see new links. The early bird gets the worm. I mean this in two ways:    When you're the first comment on a thread, you tend to get the most upvotes. This makes it seems like the community agrees with the comment more than newer comments. Yes, there is the Best sorting algo written by the XKCD guy, but in practice it still seems not to work. If you post when most people are asleep, a smaller audience controls what the majority see when they wake up. That means there is a prime time for posting, when everyone's asleep, or more exactly, when they are about to wake up.  The admins won't kick moderators for not doing their job. For example, the whole /r/xkcd fiasco where many people got confused and censored because a lone moderator went rogue. And guess which subreddit I'd type in if I was looking for content relevant to xkcd? Answer: /r/xkcd not /r/xkcdcomic.

RedditAlternatives,290cwq,roshkins,3,Wed Jun 25 18:11:50 2014 UTC,"Well Reddit currently has the ""trending"" subreddits feature. Another idea is to make something like StumbleUpon (as opposed to Reddit's ""Random"" feature) that uses machine learning techniques to suggest new subreddits or at least allows you to randomly select from a genre of subreddits.  I think an idea that would be interesting to consider is allowing moderators to get paid depending on how active a userbase they have. Because right now Reddit doesn't reward those moderators that do a good job and that increase revenue for Reddit, and that's a prime reason for low quality moderators."

RedditAlternatives,290cwq,TESTlNG,3,Sun Jun 29 12:04:48 2014 UTC,"The voting system gives the illusion that popular consensus is correct. Really old forum boards, which didn't even have ranking for posts, did have a reputation system where you could + or - rep a user for his post. Many people had it to where the higher your rep was, the higher your +/- counted. That system in its roughest realization is obviously flawed, but I can get behind its ideas. Maybe you could figure out a way to bring it to a Reddit-style community. Not everyone's words are of equal worth. Not everyone has the best judgment.  For some subreddits, like /r/funny, it's fine to associate pure +s and -s with top ranking since you're just trying to make the most people laugh most likely. On the other hand, some subreddits are ""theory"" based or ""expert"" based (e.g. /r/history /r/askreddit /r/eli5) where we want only people who know to contribute to highlighting or dismissing a person's post."

RedditAlternatives,290cwq,mreiland,5,Wed Jun 25 18:29:50 2014 UTC,"I think it's bad that the subreddit moderators have so much power, and the admins even moreso. Entire subreddits are ruined by a few shitty moderators, and the admins refuse to do anything about it. Even worse if you have a well-named sub and it's shitty overall - /u/roshkins describes in his post the problem with /r/xkcd vs /r/xkcdcomic, but the same kind of problem spawned /r/trees instead of /r/marijuana, and I think /r/ainbow as well? Unnecessary community fracturing due to some shitty mods.    I think the users should be in control of what they see and don't see; no censorship otherwise. I think Hubski is pretty close to being the way it should work:   Users post to ""tags"", like twitter or tumblr hashtags, and users follow those tags Users can also subscribe to other users or specific domains if they feel like it Users can also block tags, users, or domains, if they feel like the content coming from one of those sources is pretty low-quality. Because of all of the above, the users are in complete control of the content they view. There are no subreddit moderators - users moderate for themselves. If someone is spamming up the place, users can just block that person and move on. As long as the admins don't interfere with this system, this should work pretty well (IMO).   But I still feel like it's missing something. I'm not really sure what it is yet.   The tag system is kinda weird.   You can only have two tags on your post, and the community can add another one. I think it should probably be just one tag and that's final (crossposts allowed - just like reddit now), or as many tags as you want (but then there's no stopping people from just adding every major tag and spamming) and allowing the community to add/edit/remove tags through <insert smart process here>. You can have a self-tag, which basically only you can post to. This is actually a very cool idea, but it kinda just seems a bit over-complicated. I think this is probably fine overall though. I've seen quite a few posts where the tag is just something random and not at all useful. Hubski is pretty much set up to enable users to follow other users, which I'm not too much of a fan of. I like following certain subjects, not certain people. As a result of the users-following-users status quo, the tags are sometimes abused. There's not really a good way to fix this I guess; I'll just not see your (potentially interesting) post unless I happen to be browsing the ""global"" page.  The points (karma) system is kinda weird, but I actually kinda like it overall (and it works pretty well with the system they have set up).   It's basically a reddit karma system with only upvotes (they're actually shares, not karma at all, but from a front-page perspective and following tags instead of users, you can think of it as karma with only upvotes). This is actually a pretty cool idea, but it takes some getting used to. It looks like there's only [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8+] possible values for ""shares"". I kinda wish this was just a number instead of the wheel thing.  Overall, it just seems like the system is too over-complicated. My intuition is that a successful social news / social media site will have a few simple rules (in the sense of how the system works), and it'll just work out beautifully. I guess it might need to be complicated if your goal is to remove moderation power, though. I think the site would work very well if the following happened:   The site was focused on following tags, not users (like how reddit works now). The ability to follow users and domains should be kept, however The upvote/downvote karma system was put back in place, but there needs to be a culture around it that reiterates that upvotes are not ""agree buttons"" and downvotes are not ""disagree buttons"". Perhaps have a minimum overall karma requirement for downvoting, and also perhaps having it such that downvoting someone else costs you two karma to do. Something like that. It should be hammered into users that upvotes are for good content that contributes to the conversation, not shitty pun threads or memes or ""THIS"". Also, don't hide the total upvotes/downvotes from people. This may introduce a vector for people to ""buy"" votes like what reddit is afraid of, but maybe there'll be some cool fix here. Completely transparent voting (i.e. you can see who all voted and how), along with ignoring people's votes? More complication, though. With the karma system in place, you can then filter posts like ""ignore all posts under X karma"", ""ignore all posts by users whose current karma is under ""X"", ""ignore posts by users who are newer than X days old"", and you can even throw in different filters for different tags if you want - all this allows for simpler self-moderation so that it isn't a pain in the ass to ignore spammers. And maybe more here, but I kinda ran out of steam writing this huge post. Here's a bit to chew on, at least."
RedditAlternatives,290cwq,syzo_,4,Wed Jun 25 17:23:21 2014 UTC,Thanks you so much for the big post. You made some great points and I'll see if I can implement some into the site.
RedditAlternatives,290cwq,mreiland,1 point,Wed Jun 25 21:12:58 2014 UTC,"A few points   I disagree with the idea of 'users control the content they see'.  When I listen to music, I always put it on random.  I don't want to control the content, I want to be surprised.  It's part of the reason I like reddit so much.  I can subscribe to a subreddit and then I get random stuff related to that on my frontpage.  I don't control, I only tell reddit where my interests lie. There are several aspects of hubski that actively hamper its users.  The way muting works.  For example, if someone posts in #racism talking about something they encountered that was racist.  If you respond stating it wasn't racist, the person who created the thread can mute you.  you are no longer able to post anything in that thread, including responses to other posters. They are currently discussing implementing a feature where all new users can be ignored by a user until they've been on the site for X days.  The folks running the site have stated they will most likely implement the feature.     If I were going to recommend anything to the OP it would be: don't be Hubski."
RedditAlternatives,290cwq,syzo_,3,Fri Jun 27 14:11:16 2014 UTC,"Ah, I'm the opposite haha. I find new music randomly but when I want to sit down and listen to something I pretty much always listen to an album or a long mix straight through. I don't really think that's relevant though, since tags work basically the same way as subreddits; you'll still see ""random"" content, just content related to the tags. With Hubski, you can also subscribe to a user if you've found their submissions particularly interesting (this is actually the whole point of Hubski but I don't really use it that way). I think I just missed the argument here, can you reiterate? I'm not entirely sure becuase I've never seen it happen or used it myself, but I think the ""mute"" thing works just like an ""ignore"" button. It doesn't block you from the conversation at all, it's just that if I were to mute you, I wouldn't be able to see what you've posted. If that's not actually how it works, then I agree with this point and would suggest to remove this feature in /u/secretdeveloper's alternative. I actually agree with their decision on this (although your post was the first I've heard of it); I had it in my post above, not knowing that Hubski was even considering this. It's an easier way to moderate people who just sign up and spam the place, since there are no moderators for Hubski. It wouldn't be on by default I would imagine, or that would be a little site-breaking. I actually probably wouldn't use it at all myself unless there were a flood of shitty new users.   Overall I think that having no moderators is a unique way of fixing the overpowering moderator problem, and I think it's at least worth exploring. If you must have moderators, I'd want complete transparency and admins who aren't afraid of removing moderators who are doing a shit job. At reddit, however, it seems that the admins just don't care about shitty moderators or they even agree with them for some reason. On Hubski, at least, the power is dissipated to the users using the site.  I sort-of agree with your last sentence, though - don't be Hubski. Try something new out, and hopefully it works. We already have a Hubski, we don't need another one (well it would be nice if it was open source, actually). Similarly, we already have a Reddit, so don't just clone it (Whoaverse...)."
RedditAlternatives,290cwq,mreiland,1 point,Fri Jun 27 16:43:00 2014 UTC,"this has two parts:    a) I don't necessarily want to curate my own experience.  I want to set rough boundaries and then see what happens.  b) There's a lot of hate towards reddit for being ""dumbed down"".  Reddit is amazing, not because it's dumbed down, but because the sheer breadth of content and experience it gives you.  I can have a deep intellectual conversation and laugh at a stupid gif all in the span of 5 minutes.  I enjoy both experiences for different reasons, hubski has made it's mission to be for ""discussions"" only, and their more popular users do everything they can to try and enforce that.   Nope, that's how it works.  If you mute someone, they cannot reply to you directly.  If the person muting is the creator of the thread, you cannot reply to anyone in that thread.  This is distinct from simply ignoring someone.  My experience has been that usually the mute is used so the person can get the last word.  It's an easier way to moderate people who just sign up and spam the place, since there are no moderators for Hubski.   No, see, users currently have a means of ignoring these people.  When they see the spam, they simply ignore the person doing the spam.  If it's mostly happening in specific tags, they can ignore the tag for a bit.  The tools are there.  This was asked for because the old hands don't want to have to do that, they want to be able to click a single button and have it all go away.    On Hubski, at least, the power is dissipated to the users using the site.   And therein lies the problem.  If you think moderators can be shit, why do you think random users are going to be any better?  They're not going to be any better, that's the point.  Reddit has it's issues, but they pale in comparison to hubski."
RedditAlternatives,290cwq,syzo_,1 point,Fri Jun 27 17:13:44 2014 UTC,"a) and that's basically what you're doing with tags..? Sorry, I still just don't get what you're saying.  b) I'm not seeing this either. If enough people want to see ""stupid gif"" content, they'll post it to #stupidgif. People that like that content will share it. Power users can't do anything about it other than block that tag or, worst case, ignore you. Ah, well that's pretty shitty. I guess it has something to do with the lack of downvotes? Their fix is still not at all ideal. I agree with you here. I mean, I haven't seen it happen before, but if hubski were to suddenly get spammed hardcore (many new users, all the major tags) I would want something like this too. Again, I probably wouldn't use it unless something crazy happened, though. (yep I guess this a #4 now) It's not ""random users"", it's YOU. It's not like the content you're viewing is in the hands of the power users there. If you're seeing shitty content, it's either your fault for following something shitty or you simply haven't ignored someone yet. It takes a little extra work to set up the experience but you don't have to worry that someone is censoring stuff or handling an entire subreddit poorly.   EDIT: I actually sort-of see what you're trying to say with #1, I think? It's basically a trade-off between you moderating and a moderator moderating. You can still follow a tag on Hubski and not have to worry about moderating yourself and get a decent experience, though. My main issue with Hubski is that I don't know how well it would scale to reddit-size. At reddit-size I think the moderator model probably works out better. There still should be much more transparency in moderation here, though."
RedditAlternatives,290cwq,mreiland,1 point,Fri Jun 27 18:41:47 2014 UTC,"a) The point is that I disagree with the idea that users curate their own experience.  Whether or not you can sort of simulate subreddits using tags is beside the point.  tags are a compromise that got added to Hubski later.  The point is that I don't want to control what I see, yet this is what Hubski is centered around.  b) and if I want to post the stupid gif in #programming because it's related?  I'll repeat what I said before, there's a lot of hate towards reddit for this sort of behavior, Hubski and its community specifically discourages such things.  I don't want to be a part of a community that is so 1-dimensional that I can't enjoy both types of experiences.  Anyone who wants to create an alternative to reddit needs to be active in creating a culture that encourages the sort of breadth of content that reddit encourages.  Hubski is absolutely not it. reddit won't let me skip numbers :) wanting it and being given it are two different things.  It's fine for a user to wish for such a thing, it's another thing entirely when the site itself implicitly says it's ok to judge users based upon how long they've been on the site.  It's not like the content you're viewing is in the hands of the power users there.   That implies I'm looking for read-only content rather than engagement by other members of the community.  If you want to use Hubski as a means of consuming content only, be my guest, but that isn't how the vast majority of people use online communities."
RedditAlternatives,290cwq,jinxjar,1 point,Fri Jun 27 19:27:46 2014 UTC,"a) I mean, okay. I guess we'll just disagree here. I don't think you control the content you see on hubski as much as you're implying, unless you want to, and think that tags emulate subreddits close enough to not notice a difference (beyond the lack of dedicated moderators).  b) Oh god please no. I'm one of the haters of this sort of thing. I'd rather have thoughtful discussion about the particular thing in #programming, rather than have gifs and pun threads littered throughout. I'm sure if you included that as a side-note and had some actual relevant content to your post in addition, hubski probably wouldn't mind. Neither would I. Curse you, markdown! Yeah, I'm not too worried about this. For me, it's whatever. That is actually mainly how I use reddit (well, and the comments), along with pretty much everyone I know AFK. That having been said: if you submit good content, others will share it and more people will see it. That's true of both reddit and hubski. It's not like the power users are effectively moderators on hubski. Your content can get 8+ shares even if power users never shared it."
RedditAlternatives,290cwq,el_daniero,1 point,Fri Jun 27 20:08:22 2014 UTC,"1b) try posting a meme or a fig in a conversation somewhere.  I'm not talking about submitting a post that has nothing but a gif in it.  /r/programming bans those as well.   if you submit good content, others will share it and more people will see it.   For some definition of good that doesn't involve having an opinion that's the least bit controversial.  power users = eyeballs, it's that simple.  They ignore or mute you, lots of other people don't see your content either.  If you're ok with that, have at it, but I that isn't the sort of moderation I'm after.  And it is moderation, even if not billed as such."

Instead, just introduce a few classes of users:   new user (based on account age) lurker (based on a combo of comments per month, and quality of comments per month. if their avg comment vote is 1.5 then they probably just post uninteresting comments like ""thanks"". this is fine, but only qualifies them as a lurker) member good contributor (users with xxx votes per month of membership). Easily achievable number. once gained, can't be lost easily unless you start getting heaps of downvotes.  *possible troll (people with -xxx per month)   and have that as the ONLY thing visible in the profile. so once you reach ""good contributor status, there's no reason to karma whore, because there's nothing higher than ""good contributor"""

RedditAlternatives,290cwq,Vector_Calculus,0,Fri Dec 19 04:52:44 2014 UTC,"Hubski is the alternative that I'm trying out right now, and it looks much nicer than Reddit, although I'm not sure if I'm liking the hashtag thing separating discussions based on keywords instead of subjects. I'm liking it for now for due to the color scheme, font choice, and the fact it's working alright and people there aren't retarded so far.   Please, if you were going to make an alternative, don't make it look like Reddit (like what whoaverse is doing). Reddit looks hideous, and I'm not exaggerating. The only reason I put up with such disgustingly ugly web design is because it was 1) functional and 2) the content (back then anyway).  But there is no reason why you cannot make a functional Reddit type forum without making it look nice. LessWrong is a nice Reddit style forum albeit a more specific one. And perhaps like LessWrong, try to stress on the guideline for quality content.   Hubski also has an interesting modding choice where you can ""ignore"" people, be it spammers or trolls. Instead of blocking them, the community can choose to simply ignore them and not give them the attention they seek, but they are still allowed to speak. Don't know how it will work out in the long run, but it seems like an interesting concept.   Consider expanding the voting system to beyond a polar system. Instead of up and down, give more than just two type of vote. Like on Slashdot, comments are voted based on its informative, insightful, interesting and humor attribute. Then comments can be sorted based on these categories."

So yeah, just because someone was able to ""claim"" a subverse simply because they joined early doesn't mean that they are the best fit to mod that community. In fact, I think many will soon turn out to be rather unsuitable for the ""job"".  I predict that drama will ensue and a few mods will be banned. During that, they are going to have to come up with lots of rules everyone can agree with and then they'll be more like reddit than they wanted to.  If the community grows big enough, they will also experience the kind of spam and vote manipulation that motivated vote fuzzing on reddit."

RedditAlternatives,28vdiz,Norci,3,Thu Jun 26 09:00:59 2014 UTC,"There are different ways to make money, even in the same market segment and same profitability ranges. Compare Walmart's business practices to Costco's. No one's going to argue that they're not both profitable, successful companies, or that they don't drive a hard bargain with their suppliers. Walmart though does a lot of ethically debatable things which I'm not going to bother detailing here but much discussion on the internet is available in case you've been living under a rock. Costco on the other hand is generally well regarded for their treatment of customers and employees alike as well as their procurement strategies specifically when it comes to animal welfare.  tl;dr: Just because you need to make money doesn't mean you need to be an asshole about it."

RedditAlternatives,28vdiz,alllie,1 point,Tue Jun 24 00:27:16 2014 UTC,"got it, thanks.  So you think they have employed people to start modding forums, and directing conversations into the direction they want them to go?"
RedditAlternatives,28vdiz,IRNobody,12,Tue Jun 24 00:31:00 2014 UTC,"I think reddit's owners told reddit's managers, ""Make reddit make money"".  I think reddit sold some subs to corporate media. Like /r/politics. Almost all the mods are newish, 21 of them moding for less than a year and many of them mods for just days. /r/politics banned almost all alternative media. What isn't banned, when you try to post submissions from them, the mods find a reason to block them so almost all the submissions you see are from corporate media. I bet some/most of the /r/politics mods work for places like the New York Times and Washington Post, etc, and every reader reddit refers to those corporate sites reddit charges for.   Second I believe reddit management, for money, authorized shills on reddit. The shills used to come from outside. They had accounts that were 6 months to a year old, mostly posting on innocuous sports and gaming subs, then suddenly, when they were sold, would start posting on political subs or countering any attacks on corporations or their products.   But shills didn't just stay looking like new accounts that had been set up, aged a little, then sold (like the accounts HBGary was trying to sell). Suddenly there were a lot of old accounts acting like shills. I've been here almost 7 years and suddenly I started seeing more old accounts than I'd ever seen before. At first I thought people were selling old accounts they never used. And there probably was some of that, but I also think reddit was selling fake old accounts to corporate interests. I was once talking to someone who I thought was a shill, and I pointed out the young age of his account, and he all but claimed he could get an account of any age he wanted. Either they have hacked into reddit or reddit is selling shill accounts.  Either reddit sold them old inactive accounts or made old accounts for them and sold them. I mean, this is like ticket scalping. The performers got angry that anyone but them was getting big money for tickets and started charging these big prices for ALL tickets. In the same way Reddit management probably felt if someone was getting money selling reddit accounts, it might was well be them.   And apparently reddit is now making money. And with no great increase in ads. What else do they have to sell but us."
RedditAlternatives,28vdiz,mreiland,7,Tue Jun 24 00:42:40 2014 UTC,"And there probably was some of that, but I also think reddit was selling fake old accounts to corporate interests.   this is what I think happened as well  It's such a shame.... so theres no conspiracy, its just the same ol' same ol', money runs everything  It's possible they are preparing Reddit for their IPO?"
RedditAlternatives,28vdiz,IRNobody,4,Tue Jun 24 01:43:53 2014 UTC,Maybe. Take the money and run.
RedditAlternatives,28vdiz,mreiland,0,Tue Jun 24 01:54:26 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it's kind of terrible right now because /r/conspiracy took over right away. It's already getting better though as more non-conspiratards join. It's based on user voting, so eventually the rule of /v/conspiracy should end as they become outnumbered."
RedditAlternatives,28vdiz,IRNobody,5,Tue Jun 24 02:18:52 2014 UTC,"Being based on user voting is the main thing that is wrong with these types of sites. It's definitely the biggest problem here on reddit. Instead of promoting an open forum for discussion user voting turns these sites into a place for like minded people to gather and jerk each other off about shared views. Meanwhile anyone with the gall to disagree is downvoted and insulted without ever providing any actual counter points to that person's standpoint. Even on subs that aren't meant for discussion the voting system is detrimental. Even though the votes don't do anything for you they are coveted by certain types of people that need to fulfill a desire to be popular. Which leads to people not only re-posting the same content over and over, but also just figuring out what's popular and flooding nearly identical content. It kills OC as well as discussion."
RedditAlternatives,28vdiz,mreiland,1 point,Mon Jun 23 21:12:15 2014 UTC,"I don't disagree with you, but I'm curious if you have any ideas on how to mitigate the problem?"
RedditAlternatives,28vdiz,IRNobody,0,Mon Jun 23 22:57:44 2014 UTC,"Really the only thing that could be done is to completely remove the voting system. As far as determining what makes front page, I'm not sure. Maybe have it based on the number of views?"
RedditAlternatives,28vdiz,mreiland,0,Tue Jun 24 02:45:30 2014 UTC,"views don't necessarily mean people liked something, and it would give way too much value to things such as the title rather than the content.  The reposting, etc, will never go away.  It's a fact of life.  To me, the up/downvote situation isn't really one that needs to go away.  So what if people up/downvote because they like/dislike or agree/disagree?  Is that really a problem?  It honestly reflects how people feel about either the content, or the comment.  I think a better approach would be to allow people to distill what they see based upon more metrics.  reddit already does it to some extent.  new/top/rising/controversial/gilded.  These are all ways to content using some other metric than ""got a ton of upvotes recently"".  Just add some more and let people configure the way they view their frontpage that way as well.  honestly, the only major problem I have with reddit is how much arbitrary authority the mods have over their subreddit, but even that isn't too terrible of a thing imo, just one that rears its ugly head now and again."
RedditAlternatives,28vdiz,lud1120,2,Fri Jun 27 14:25:32 2014 UTC,"So what if people up/downvote because they like/dislike or agree/disagree?  Is that really a problem?   With regard to comments, yes that is a problem. Because it negates any chance for a rational conversation about the subject at hand. I agree though that as far as posts, in most subs yes the up/down vote system is fine. However, voting on the comments within the post should be eliminated."
RedditAlternatives,28vdiz,alllie,-1,Fri Jun 27 22:04:00 2014 UTC,"It only negates the chance for a discussion if you get angry about a downvote.  your comment getting severely upvoted or downvated has absolutely no effect on your participation of the conversation (or the participation of others).  I honestly cannot fathom how anyone could reasonably suggest up/downvotes affects discussions of any kind by all that much.  It's used for ranking, which is completely separate from having a back and forth with people inside any given thread."
RedditAlternatives,28vdiz,alllie,2,Fri Jun 27 23:08:15 2014 UTC,"Because when people see a heavily downvoted comment they tend to ignore it. A lot of people don't even bother to click the ""this comment has been downvoted beyond the threshold click here to display"", and those that do just click it so they can downvote and insult the person that said it. Meanwhile no one bothers to give a legitimate response to someone that is getting downvoted.  Edit: Also if you don't think that more value is already placed on the title rather than the content you haven't been paying attention. A quick trip to the comments section in most cases proves that a majority of the commenters didn't even bother to read the article. Sadly, it is the those same comments that are consistent upvoted because they are expressing the hivemind's opinion."

Sadly I am not into programming, especially C#, and so I can't really help with that.   I also have to mention that I have run into a problem already on your site. It seems like someone has stolen redditor names, and might pretend to be users from reddit.  For example, both my accounts /u/lastresort09 (original account) and /u/lastresort08 have been taken on whoaverse. I am certain someone might have targeted me, because all the other numbers, other than 08 and 09, are available. Not a huge issue, but it could possibly turn into one.   If you guys had some way of redditors holding on to their names (through some process of verification via reddit messages), so that the shift is smoother, i.e. the community recognizes them, and there aren't people pretending to be someone else... that would be great.

This was a big enough deal that they should have presented it to us a month or a week beforehand, and asked for input and thoughts. They didn't. They just did their own crap, said ""fuck you, live with it"", and they continue to ignore us. People have brought up very big, genuine issues and very good sounding solutions to the problems, but the devs continue to blindly ignore us while they do their own thing. It entirely goes against the whole 'community driven' aspect of this site, and if they continue doing this, they will destroy themselves the same way Digg destroyed itself. If we are to judge the future of Reddit from how they treated us yesterday, Reddit can only go downhill from here.  So, with that in mind, right now is the time for people making Reddit alternatives to push their site."

RedditAlternatives,1w58rw,jimbajuice,4,Fri Mar 28 22:20:49 2014 UTC,Requires real name information.  Sometimes you just want to toss out a few ideas with an alt or two.  Also using a real name makes you more inhibited and less likely to share information that may be controversial for fear of it being linked directly back to you.  Imagine going to a job interview and they dig up all your Quora comments.  Not the most conducive environment to share ideas in.

RedditAlternatives,1tlvs4,fedoradeeuphfuhrer,2,Tue Dec 31 18:17:26 2013 UTC,"Amen! I'm done trying too. This place has gotten insane. Like literally insane. There's no compassion or thoughtfulness. It's damaging to my mental health to continue to stay here. I'm glad I found this subreddit, now I can get out of here."
RedditAlternatives,1tlvs4,theteenswillloveit,-3,Sat Jun 7 22:28:31 2014 UTC,Stop giving a fuck about it and just enjoy what parts of it you can. You don't have to contribute.
RedditAlternatives,1tlvs4,Bancai,6,Sun Jan 5 01:48:09 2014 UTC,I love the fact that you got downvoted in a post abouy why downvoting an unpopular opinion was one of the reasons this place is shitty!
RedditAlternatives,1tlvs4,shoutwire2007,3,Mon Jan 6 21:56:10 2014 UTC,I'm just curious what brought you here.
RedditAlternatives,1tlvs4,Berz3rk3r,2,Sun Jan 19 21:10:17 2014 UTC,"i was searching for an ""alternative to websites"" subreddit and ended up here."
RedditAlternatives,1tlvs4,EffEPi77,2,Sun Jan 19 21:33:43 2014 UTC,"So was I, but I haven't found what I'm looking for yet.   Any leads?"
RedditAlternatives,1tlvs4,LordSlayne,2,Wed Jan 22 18:37:20 2014 UTC,"I've found two so far, hubski.com and whoaverse.com. I messaged the main mod there to work on and improve whoaverse as well. Also, hearing rumors of someone named /r/zennonet[1] is creating a good alternative as well"
RedditAlternatives,1t6ep9,thbt101,16,Wed Dec 18 16:55:08 2013 UTC,"There's no commenting. Is there even voting? It's just a piece of crap news aggregator now. You can only sign in through Google, Twitter or Facebook. Definitely a piece of crap. I'm sure the NSA loves it."
RedditAlternatives,1t6ep9,alllie,2,Mon Apr 14 13:30:23 2014 UTC,What does the NSA have to do with it?
RedditAlternatives,1t6ep9,alllie,10,Mon Apr 14 15:12:05 2014 UTC,They spy on us. Forcing people to link with facebook etc allows what they view to be linked to their real identity.
RedditAlternatives,1t6ep9,joseph177,0,Mon Apr 14 15:27:33 2014 UTC,I really don't think the NSA cares which tech stories people are reading on Digg.
RedditAlternatives,1t6ep9,boddah87,11,Mon Apr 14 16:16:39 2014 UTC,"They definitely are interested in data, hoards of it. Google and facebook simply want to sell our identity preferences to pinpoint ads."
RedditAlternatives,1t6ep9,DrMeowmeow,2,Wed May 21 13:31:24 2014 UTC,"I agree, but the only thing I don't like is the amount of content that I've already read on Reddit"
RedditAlternatives,1snrbb,tehbored,1 point,Wed Dec 11 20:31:03 2013 UTC,You can submit vote and comment. So maybe. Though it wants an email.
RedditAlternatives,wu33z,DutchmanDavid,1 point,Thu Jul 19 20:22:00 2012 UTC,Here is a dailydot article about the website.  Here is the /r/TrueReddit post that started it.  Here is the /r/TrueReddit post in which one of the guys shows their new product!  The 2 TrueReddit posts added for archiving purposes.
RedditAlternatives,wu33z,scotchburg,1 point,Thu Jul 19 20:25:42 2012 UTC,"I hope they charge a one time fee to post content there, like Metafilter. It would help maintain the quality of the site."
RedditAlternatives,wa4jv,elshizzo,5,Mon Jul 9 18:03:01 2012 UTC,"haven't been to that site in a while, but it looks like its still surviving.  And it has a clean new interface.  It's got potential"
RedditAlternatives,wa4jv,fangolo,3,Mon Jul 9 18:06:42 2012 UTC,Thanks elshizzo. We aren't going anywhere. :)  Feel free to share feedback if you have any.
RedditAlternatives,wa4jv,fangolo,3,Sat Jul 14 15:26:36 2012 UTC,"I like a lot of what I see, but here's my feedback.  Discovering communities could be better.  It only lists the X or so most popular, i'd like to browse past that.  An option to view the most popular in the last day, or week, or whatever, would be nice.  An option to filter your frontpage between text/video/image/etc would be nice.  Otherwise, I like what i'm seeing, but its too similar to reddit.  It needs more advantages and differences to reddit."
RedditAlternatives,wa4jv,scotchburg,1 point,Wed Aug 8 20:53:27 2012 UTC,"Thanks elshizzo. These are all good suggestions.  I'll be getting back to you on this. :)  Btw, are there any things that you think reddit lacks that you'd like to see?"
RedditAlternatives,wa4jv,ClausnitzerCan,2,Wed Aug 8 22:02:11 2012 UTC,"fangolo: one thing (this is kinda a controversial opinion) that may have lead to a change in Reddit that is distasteful to some Redditors who have been around the site a while is a sense of an increasing lack of quality submissions and comments over time.  Another site that has seems to dodge this more or less is Metafilter. Metafilter has a one-time fee to comment on their content, albeit anyone can view it. This seems to have reduced the pace of decline quality content over time. Who would pay $5 to submit bad comment or troll?  Has hubski considered any such ""barrier"" to participation in the site in such that only those who are truly vested would want to participate? (and keep stronger content over time?)"
RedditAlternatives,wa4jv,scotchburg,2,Mon Jul 16 03:52:01 2012 UTC,|Who would pay $5 to submit bad comment or troll?| -Great point. It would take a pretty dedicated troll to pay to annoy people. -Though I wouldn't count this out.   Great suggestion.
RedditAlternatives,wa4jv,ClausnitzerCan,1 point,Wed Jul 18 01:46:50 2012 UTC,Thank you.
RedditAlternatives,wa4jv,scotchburg,1 point,Wed Jul 18 01:53:06 2012 UTC,Sure thing. See you around...
RedditAlternatives,wa4jv,fangolo,1 point,Wed Jul 18 02:20:39 2012 UTC,Such a comment has me curious and interested in what you mean. Should I be keeping a keener eye on Hubski?
RedditAlternatives,wa4jv,scotchburg,2,Wed Jul 18 03:15:46 2012 UTC,"Sorry, I was offline for a couple of weeks.  I haven't considered a subscription. However, one way that Hubski maintains the experience is the way that you construct your feed. You follow people that post and share quality content. If you find that some content is low-quality, you simply unfollow the person that is posting/sharing it. Basically, on Hubski you choose a group of people to curate content for you. If you choose quality people, you should continue to get quality content.  But, I am always open to new ideas. The $5 fee on Metafilter is an interesting approach."
RedditAlternatives,wa4jv,fangolo,1 point,Sun Jul 29 01:17:00 2012 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, fangolo, and good luck."
RedditAlternatives,wa4jv,scotchburg,1 point,Sun Jul 29 14:47:24 2012 UTC,np. Thanks.  Keep an eye on us. ;)
RedditAlternatives,wa4jv,fangolo,1 point,Sun Jul 29 16:41:42 2012 UTC,I also think I'll be an account with you guys...
