He is a part of the minneapolis/st.paul scene, especially associating with younger rappers, mentoring/guiding them. He also does different charity stuff. He is a part of the rap collective F.I.X with joe horton and cresent moon. I think he is kind of concentrating on his family though too, he has a young kid. I expect a lot from him still though, the times i do see him perform in minneapolis are always fantastic. Your right though he did kind of go quiet for a couple years after eyedeas death."

I live in Buffalo and quite honestly I was one of the first to bring the likes of Atmosphere into the suburbs of Buffalo.  It has grown to a degree, but it is not a regular destination for this genre of artists.  I often drive to Pittsburgh or plan business trips around shows to see artists, but RARELY get to MN.   Next time you see him wish him well from random fan ""Real"" in Buffalo."

altrap,3e5q26,alexyxray,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:00:59 2015 UTC,his first few lines are the best extended metaphor i have ever heard
altrap,3e209e,EmpireSquared,3,Tue Jul 21 10:04:08 2015 UTC,"This is from his ""The Evermore EP"" which should be available on iTunes and Spotify. I stumbled upon this by accident while digging through Youtube's recommended videos and I found out there's some really good songs on there. Personally, I think God's Favourite Sketches is better, but it's a tad short so I opted for this one instead."
