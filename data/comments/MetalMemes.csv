I've loved metal ever since (Chimaira, DevilDriver, Megadeth, Slayer, Carnifex as examples).  I feel I've done my diversifying. I will mix it up with some grunge or punk once in a while, but every time someone tells me I need to expand my taste in music, I tell them this story, then I tell them to go fuck themselves."

MetalMemes,3du63s,Girrzimm,6,Sun Jul 19 19:41:58 2015 UTC,Google Play Music has been really good for metal. My only complaints so far is that it's missing two or three LP's from Clutch's discography and missing Demigod for Behemoth. The Behemoth thing pisses me off more than anything because 'Conquer All' is my shit.

MetalMemes,3dnd7i,atrainmadbrit,9,Sat Jul 18 20:51:07 2015 UTC,Listen to the Swedish tracks on Carolus Rex (if you are able - many you tube videos have translations) - it's incredible how lyrically many of the songs are different. Example: Lifetime of War in English focuses on the broader causes of extended conflicts whereas the Swedish version is about the suffering of the soldier. It's good stuff.
MetalMemes,3dnd7i,oswaldvonwolkenstein,2,Fri Jul 17 20:03:53 2015 UTC,I always recommend to people getting into Sabaton that the first thing they should do is sit down and listen to Carolus Rex in its entirety.
MetalMemes,3dnd7i,Tetrabyte,8,Sun Jul 19 15:22:36 2015 UTC,I wasn't a huge fan of them until I saw them in concert. They were awesome! They brought some like 5yo kid on stage and let him hit cymbals. I guess his family was at the previous show the night before and they had him on stage then too.
MetalMemes,3dnd7i,kingeryck,3,Fri Jul 17 21:41:14 2015 UTC,THEY ARE AMAZING LIVE!!! They brought up a younger girl (probably like 8-9 yo) and they let her strum the guitar. So good. This is how you win all the things.

MetalMemes,3ddxaa,omgwtfkrieg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:20:18 2015 UTC,My brother showed me withering waves and I bought the album 2 hours later. I'm just not a fan of the drummer. He's good but they'd be a lot heavier with slower drumming I think

The drum cam footage of him is amazing. If there's something to complain about with the drumming, it's the production. They went a little too heavy with the drum triggers"

MetalMemes,3cxmon,FFGFM,5,Sat Jul 11 22:35:41 2015 UTC,Elitist. You're what's wrong with metal but you're probably right. It sounded close enough to melodeath to me the first time I watched it but not completely and metal archives has them as a melodeath band that was metalcore early on. I assumed they played something from the period  they were transitioning to melodeath but wasn't sure what to list it as. It sounds closer to melodeath to me but I don't listen to metalcore much so I'm not really a good judge of on which side they'd be closer to. You're still an elitist for correcting me.

And I mean, the albums 15 years old, but I guess that's not a lot since Iron Maiden has been putting out music since the 70s..."

Kay played Prowler in his club and the song got popular enough to hit number 1 in the Sounds magazine.   They also had two tracks appear in Metal for Muthas in early 1980, before Iron Maiden was released."

MetalMemes,3cgbz4,CheezyTheCheese,4,Tue Jul 7 18:15:09 2015 UTC,"I've been listening to this band since 2004 back when I was in a full blown hxc phase , and they have just progressed into the most brilliantly underrated non metal once metalish metal band of all. I was listening to silent flight parliament and like most of their long songs you get lost in them and don't mind their length nor want them to end. And I was thinking during minute8-9 ""I hope their new cd just melts my brain. Fuck it I'm gonna order a bundle now, I know it'll be good. This band is still awesome."
MetalMemes,3cgbz4,NowFreeToMaim,3,Wed Jul 8 05:45:31 2015 UTC,"Saw them live last night. Pretty fuckin metal if you ask me. The pit was big and moving hard, fuckers were headbanging and jumping. They got some good heavy shit."

Tommy said it was going to be ""80% clean vocals"", and it failed to deliver that promise, on top of the promise of being their best work yet.

I hope they stop making metalcore soon and graduate to Metal."

MetalMemes,3c9q92,ClockFaceIII,7,Mon Jul 6 05:03:14 2015 UTC,Lost it at Elitist Fap Metal. Some of my music sounds exactly like that.
MetalMemes,3c9q92,AbbathDoomOcculta,3,Mon Jul 6 14:57:12 2015 UTC,"The problem with the whole subgenre drama is that we need some terms to quickly describe what kind of sound to expect from a given artist, yet, since it's constantly evolving, sometimes it's hard to keep up. Since the naming convention can be abused, some people prefer to stick with a few, established genres, while others would happily slap a different subgenre label to each band.  From my experience, a general genre would suffice in 99% of the cases. Especially now, when most of the time we have an instant access to music. Entombed A.D., Cannibal Corpse and Death DTA are death metal, plain and simple. Would it hurt to listen to one song from each to get what they sound like? ;)  Generalisation is not a bad thing. I remember the times where 'Blackened Death Metal' was a controversial name, yet it's still here, since it swiftly gets the point across - how else would you describe bands like Behemoth? It's a fusion - but a fusion of two well-established genres, and we hear very strong influences from both. If you're trying to explain a nuance in a band's sound by inventing a new genre - that's probably too much.  As for this satire, those alt-names are mostly just silly, but he got me with 'ambient space water float groove' and 'halloween makeup metal'. Since I really like those kinds of sound (it's in the part III).  The rest of it isn't even metal subgenres, almost all are -core, so I can't really relate (the only -core for me is grindcore, since I began my metal journeys 19 years ago with Napalm Death - remember 'Fear, Emptiness, Despair? ;) )"
MetalMemes,3c9q92,taku_pl,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:32:55 2015 UTC,"From my experience, a general genre would suffice in 99% of the cases.   Eeeeh. I agree to a point. We don't need to (and we don't for all those whingy fucks) box each band into its own genre but I can give you plenty of examples of sub-division of stuff like death or black metal or power metal being necessary.   Plenty of folks who love black metal like Blasphemy or Revenge (what is often termed as Bestial Black Metal or War Metal) do not like black metal like Winterfylleth or Wodensthrone (Atmospheric Black Metal). Plenty of folks who love Old School Death Metal like Incantation, early Entombed, Asphyx, Autopsy don't like Tech Death like Brain Drill or Brutal Death Metal like all the Suffocation clones.   You can't really say that these cases are small and insignificant because the stylistic differences between the styles are huge even within archtypes like Death or Black Metal."

MetalMemes,3c95un,SerCearbhall,8,Mon Jul 6 17:21:54 2015 UTC,"You're right. As much as the elitists want to say different, Limp Bizkit and Korn are metal. Are they as heavy as underground stuff? No, of course not. But if you say they aren't metal, then what are they? Certainly not rock and nu-metal certainly isn't worthy of it's very own label. Metal is a wide and extremely diverse genre of music, covering stuff like nu-metal to Pantera and Lamb of God to Dying Fetus and Cattle Decapitation. Some of us just need to deal with it. Besides, if you're around my age (30) nu-metal was most likely your gateway drug to the more extreme music you listen to now. People can say whatever they want, but you didn't initially fall in love with this music because of slam."

MetalMemes,3c95un,E13ven,2,Mon Jul 6 14:40:55 2015 UTC,Agreed that nu-metal is metal  I think core is also metal ducks   core is nu metal for a nu generation
MetalMemes,3c95un,E13ven,2,Mon Jul 6 21:35:25 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think that nu-metal has enough of a leg to stand on on its own.   And a lot of people don't classify it as ""metal"" because it's not pure metal, there are other influences at play just like with metalcore and deathcore or whatever else.   I'm not really one to nit pick genres and I still refer to it all as metal, but I can see where the argument comes from."
MetalMemes,3c95un,the_Demongod,0,Mon Jul 6 15:56:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's enough history for it to be it's own genre of music. To me, a genre should have a long history and not just be a ten (or so) year trend. Also, it wasn't ever taken seriously, and probably never will be. I still think it's just a subgenre, the cousin that no one really likes in the family of Metal.   There are a lot of bands that aren't pure metal but are respected members of the community (Napalm Death and Opeth come to mind) but they're both influential and respected bands, yet there are bands that are closer to Black Sabbath that aren't considered metal. Nitpicking is useless, best saved for IMNs and elitists."
MetalMemes,3c95un,the_Demongod,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:12:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean I don't really consider each genre its own entity, I sort of just classify things either directly under or as off shoots of the main ""parent"" genre, so nu metal would be an off shoot of metal but also related to other genres.  And I think a lot of people classify a band based on their initial material. Opeth was a pretty purely metal band for their first few albums then veered off a bit up until now, but due to their beginnings they're classified as metal. Same as with bands such as In Flames."
MetalMemes,3c95un,the_Demongod,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:18:44 2015 UTC,"Limp Bizkit and Korn are metal.   Well hold on, I'm saying that they're ""heavy metal,"" and that no longer means that they're ""metal,"" hence the comparisons I made above."
MetalMemes,3c95un,Ciaphas_Cain,2,Mon Jul 6 19:21:14 2015 UTC,"So who is ""metal""? Metallica? Pantera? I only graduated from a small directional school man, I'm a little confused."
MetalMemes,3c95un,Sexyphobe,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:49:02 2015 UTC,"Haha fair enough. Obviously there are a lot of blurred lines, otherwise the genre debate wouldn't be so intense. I suppose ""heavy metal"" could be considered a subset of metal. I do agree that metal is an incredibly diverse genre and if I would probably say it starts at (so I suppose includes) nu and heavy metal.  Metallica's early stuff was definitely thrash metal. Pantera is definitely groove metal-y like Lamb of God. I don't listen to any of the heavy metal stuff I described before (Disturbed, Slipknot, etc), but from what I've heard, the whole aesthetic changes in a way that's difficult to describe. I guess it's less about making excellent music and more about painting a picture of the band as a whole, so you start seeing things thrown in for shock value and such, and you start seeing gimmicks (like Slipknot's masks). I honestly don't listen to any bands that are on the heavy metal/metal edge, so I'm definitely not the person to be asking here. I listen almost exclusively to black metal, so there are probably others here more capable of describing it than I am."
MetalMemes,3c95un,Sexyphobe,2,Mon Jul 6 20:26:38 2015 UTC,I still don't know if there really is a difference between calling something either metal or heavy metal. I've always just thought saying metal meant you were too lazy to say heavy metal. I think it really comes down to semantics and splitting hairs.
MetalMemes,3c95un,Metal_Malachy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:15:12 2015 UTC,"I used to think that as well and I think it was once very true (back during the transition from classic rock to metal, with the Big Four, etc.), but I've been noticing a trend with these almost-metal bands recently. If you google ""Disturbed,"" ""Slipknot,"" ""Mushroomhead,"" or any other bands that are what we call nu-metal, they are all described as ""heavy metal,"" and it seems to me like they've split in the way I described ""Rock"" and ""Rock and roll"" splitting above. It's clear that the word ""rock"" was just short for ""rock and roll,"" but by the time the classic rock bands like Led Zeppelin came into existence, the genre had become very different from Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Buddy Holly, etc. and at that point they were essentially separate."

Slayer won an award one time and didn't really care about it. They thought it was cool and all but they only cared about making good music.
MetalMemes,3c12xn,DavidSSD,9,Fri Jul 3 23:00:44 2015 UTC,don't... Take pride in their music  only cared about making good music   What?
MetalMemes,3c12xn,emptywords18,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:18:33 2015 UTC,Taking in pride in something means you are only thankful for yourself and nobody else. making music requires alot more than just one person.

MetalMemes,3bpkj4,FrostytheSnowColt,-18,Wed Jul 1 04:40:40 2015 UTC,"The big four can go die in a hole. There's no fucking reason for those four bands to get so much more publicity, especially since Exodus blows all of them out of the water."
MetalMemes,3bpkj4,blalkr,18,Wed Jul 1 08:34:24 2015 UTC,The new Exodus sounds like Stitch (from Lilo & Stitch) singing to Slayer tracks.
MetalMemes,3bpkj4,BigNickTX,6,Wed Jul 1 12:13:29 2015 UTC,"The new Exodus stuff doesn't sound like Slayer at all. It's at least much more varied and original than the same song Kerry has been writing for the past 10 years at least.  Also, thrash is something to be heard live, not on an album. In that case, Exodus blows Slayer out of the water since they actually move around on stage and have actual contact with the audience.  Most of the big four is incredibly boring live. Tom Araya stands there like a statue and he says the same shit every show, Kerry just stands there bobbing his head. James Hetfield pulls the same kid friendly Metallica Family shit every show. Dave Mustaine kinda doesn't talk at all anymore. Anthrax is surprisingly still pretty fun live.  Sure, Exodus isn't as good as they used to be in terms of music, but their live performances and attitude are still on point. They still know how to put on a good show and identify with their fans. That's the real thrash spirit; that it's still aggressive and fun. Choosing the big four in terms of financial success is absolute bullshit."
MetalMemes,3bpkj4,blalkr,2,Wed Jul 1 13:19:58 2015 UTC,"I still love to see Slayer live. Tom is my boy; he is just a genuinely cool guy that loves the fans. Don't get me wrong, I love Exodus, but Souza's voice is silly to me. I only made the Slayer comment because of Holt playing with them these days. I saw metallica in 94 and was blown away. I don't even want to see them again because I do not want that experience tarnished. I saw Megadeth a couple years ago and the only talking the 'staine did was about cigarette smoke. Their set pretty much sucked and the new albums...don't even get me started. Anthrax is very fun live. I have been around, but have yet to see an Exodus show, so my only experience is through records. Bonded by Blood is in my top twenty favorite albums list.  TL;DR:  I love Exodus, but Zetro sounds like a demonic Muppet on record."
MetalMemes,3bpkj4,BigNickTX,2,Wed Jul 1 20:05:10 2015 UTC,"I love exodus, but I love the Rob Dukes era the most. I can still love Zetros songs like Toxic Waltz, Scar spangled banner, Ect. But I just love Dukes songs the best. Like children of a worthless God, Ballade of Lenord and Charles, March Of The Sycophants, ect. Zetros voice now just sounds gross compared to Dukes'. But it really depends on your taste in vocals."

MetalMemes,3bd8o5,Tankred,2,Sun Jun 28 09:58:03 2015 UTC,"I hate when people trash on the concepts of ""genre"" just as much as I hate when bands feel like they need to conform to a specific genre.  Genres are just names for specific collections of musical traits.  Genres help people find bands whose works contains traits and themes they enjoy.  I enjoy sewing-machine drumming, fantasy lyrics, light-hearted attitudes, and cheesiness----So the vast majority of bands I listen to are Power Metal.  Do I like only Power Metal? Fuck no. I enjoy many different bands from many different subgenres. (The bands I enjoy span Power, Prog, Folk, Speed, Thrash, Death, Prog Rock, Traditional, and occasionally Black, with a few standing from the realms of Psychadelic and other such oddities)  But Power Metal contains the bulk of the traits that I enjoy.  Sure, Prog Metal also occasionally uses Sewing Machine/Machine Gun Drumming, and occasionally has fantasy themes, but are they cheesy and light hearted? Outside of a few acts like Ayreon, not really.  Sure Black Metal is cheesy---But because they take themselves seriously, not because they explicitly don't take themselves seriously. (Except for Abbath. Dude's a hilarious nutcase.) Fantasy lyrics? Oh, hell yeah. Sewing Machine Drumming? Not often.  Genres are categorization and ease of communication.  Sure, you lose a lot of depth and nuance by just saying ""Power Metal"" or ""Black Metal""----But, hey, they aren't so much rigidly defined descriptors of bands as they are a single aspect---Many groups works' span multiple genres, or can be cleanly fit into one single genre but with a few twists (I.e., you'd be a fool to say Crimson Shadows isn't power metal, but because they use growls instead of traditional singing some people will immediately classify them as either Death Metal or Deathcore, former due to its more complex and Metal instrumentals, Deathcore because of the type of growls they use and because they occasionally use breakdowns---Just because they think ""Well, The dictionary says Power Metal is Clean singing, sewing machine drumming, and undistorted guitars... But they have growls so they can't be power metal"")  I mean, hell, compare Heavenly to Avantasia: TMO---Same damned subgenre, completely different texture, tone, and style.  But despite their many differences, they're still distinctly the same sub-genre---Why? Because at their core, the foundation of the songs, they use the same traits.  But sadly, people tend to take genres as too ""Definitive"", so we end up getting these ""Genre Spaghettios"" like ""Progressive-Power Blackened Deaththrash"" or whatever---Like, dude, Technical Death metal is more than enough. We get that Technical Death Metal isn't well known for Power or Black Metal influences, but it's cool. It's just a ""Closest to"" type of deal, not a ""Hyper-Exact"" type of deal."

That's not a logo, that's just a font you found online with a grainy filter on it.  That being said, I prefer when the logo is legible, at least to an extent, like enough to get the first/last letters at least.  I love black/death metal, but my first love was thrash, so I'm really partial to those styles of logo. IMO, the best balance between legibility and standing out uniquely belong to 80s thrash."

MetalMemes,3bd990,PXL_OZZY,-1,Sun Jun 28 03:30:49 2015 UTC,A concert announcement is pretty damn close to the definition of a meme actually. But speaking general social media terms you're right. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme
MetalMemes,3bd990,autowikibot,-1,Sun Jun 28 12:43:11 2015 UTC,"Meme:       A meme (/ˈmiːm/ meem)  is ""an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture"".  A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.   The word meme is a shortening (modeled on gene) of mimeme (from Ancient Greek μίμημα pronounced [míːmɛːma] mīmēma, ""imitated thing"", from μιμεῖσθαι mimeisthai, ""to imitate"", from μῖμος mimos, ""mime"")  coined by British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene (1976)   as a concept for discussion of evolutionary principles in explaining the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. Examples of memes given in the book included melodies, catch-phrases, fashion, and the technology of building arches.   Proponents theorize that memes are a viral phenomenon that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, each of which influences a meme's reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive, spread, and (for better or for worse) mutate. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts.   A field of study called memetics  arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model. Criticism from a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can examine memes empirically. However, developments in neuroimaging may make empirical study possible.  Some commentators in the social sciences question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture in terms of discrete units, and are especially critical of the biological nature of the theory's underpinnings.  Others have argued that this use of the term is the result of a misunderstanding of the original proposal.   Dawkins's own position is somewhat ambiguous: he obviously welcomed N. K. Humphrey's suggestion that ""memes should be considered as living structures, not just metaphorically""  and wanted to regard memes as ""physically residing in the brain"".  Later, he argued that his original intentions, presumably before his approval of Humphrey's opinion, had been simpler.  At the New Directors' Showcase 2013 in Cannes, Dawkins' opinion on memetics was deliberately ambiguous.

I'll try to think or make a list, but on the top of my mind, just check the aussie dudes from Be'lakor. Especially their song ""Countless Skies"" and the album Stone's Reach. All of their albums rule, but that's my favorite."
MetalMemes,3b88ms,mrnecrodaemon,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:05:26 2015 UTC,"Gotchya.  I don't blame you, melodeath has a very general sound.  I'll check out Be'lakor as well.  Seriously, I need to expand my horizons more than what I have.  Thanks for the recommendations!  If you want recommendations for ANY genre of metal, let me know."
MetalMemes,3b88ms,hunthell,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:08:00 2015 UTC,"Oh, I wasn't complaining. I LOVE melodeath, especially because I've spent some years away from metal (dating indie gals can really influence your taste), but melodeath brought me back. After that, I just started to find more and more metal to like while, also, getting to more and more extreme stuff."
MetalMemes,3b88ms,mrnecrodaemon,2,Sat Jun 27 00:11:57 2015 UTC,"As I said, let me know if you want a specific sound.  I may be able to point you in the right direction, even if it may not be the exact sound you want.  As far as indie music, I understand.  Blood Sacrifice is definitely more indie than metal, but I love them.  I want to get into more stuff like that.  You have any indie bands that emulate the occult-rock of the  60s/70s?"
MetalMemes,3b88ms,hunthell,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:16:14 2015 UTC,"It's been years since I listened to those bands and, frankly, I can't seem to remember them at all. Wasn't a huge fan back there, just enjoyed some songs, I guess. The only band I really liked and from time to time I came back to is The Kooks, but I'm almost sure isn't the kind of band you're looking for. There's Minus the Bear, altough I found them by my own (they're related to Botch and Russian Circles, two bands I enjoy), but again, not the kind of indie you're searching for. Also, The Dear Hunter (not the other Deerhunter band), they're a little more on the prog side, but also has a lot of influences creeping on their sound and they even have a Surf rock song on one of their ep's (""She's Always Singing"", from the Yellow EP).  Oh, I appreciate your offer, man. If I ever find myself wanting a particular style of band, I know to whom I might ask."
MetalMemes,3b88ms,mrnecrodaemon,4,Sat Jun 27 00:33:56 2015 UTC,"They're a pretty good melodic death metal band. If you've ever heard of Insomnium, one of their guitarists is in it. I recommend you check them out."

MetalMemes,3b88ms,spideralex90,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:25:34 2015 UTC,Desktop version for Windows.
MetalMemes,3b7b97,Fuckyou_glennbeck,11,Fri Jun 26 15:32:36 2015 UTC,What do you call shitty djent? I need names.
MetalMemes,3b7b97,Funeralord,-6,Fri Jun 26 16:48:13 2015 UTC,The ones that sound like korn and limp bizkit?
MetalMemes,3b7b97,rob61091,18,Fri Jun 26 17:49:32 2015 UTC,"Those two are nü-metal bands. Nothing to do with (and much older than) djent. OP said ""shitty djent""."
MetalMemes,3b7b97,Funeralord,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:12:28 2015 UTC,I'd argue that shitty djent sounds like korn and limp bizkit
MetalMemes,3b7b97,rob61091,4,Fri Jun 26 18:21:58 2015 UTC,"But djent is based in some kind of progressive metal (even if there's a lot of non metal djent), while Korn and Limp Bizkit are based in some kind of hip-hop/funk style, and not netal at all"
MetalMemes,3b7b97,TheMightyMrM,6,Fri Jun 26 19:23:09 2015 UTC,No...he's saying shitty djent sounds like shit nu metal...he's not saying they're the same thing.
MetalMemes,3b7b97,PHPH,6,Fri Jun 26 21:50:39 2015 UTC,"Jesus, thank you"
MetalMemes,3b7b97,rob61091,-11,Sat Jun 27 00:48:21 2015 UTC,"Vildjharta, Born of Osiris, Destiny Potato, and Clandestine name a few."
MetalMemes,3b7b97,Is_Secretly_Welsh,7,Fri Jun 26 18:38:19 2015 UTC,I'm genuinely curious if you've given Vildjharta a dedicated listen.
MetalMemes,3b7b97,spideralex90,5,Fri Jun 26 22:29:35 2015 UTC,Don't talk shit about vildhjarta mane
MetalMemes,3b7b97,ryanjeb,4,Fri Jun 26 23:04:30 2015 UTC,"I thought Vildhjarta's Thousands of Evil was pretty interesting, definitely not the traditional constant chugging a lot of djent bands do."
MetalMemes,3b7b97,SpicyCornflake,5,Fri Jun 26 18:43:49 2015 UTC,"OP said ""shitty djent""."
MetalMemes,3b7b97,Funeralord,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:44:18 2015 UTC,"Destiny Potato is pretty nice imo. It's basically Pop-metal with a kickass female vocalist. Nothing revolutionary, but still fun to listen to."
MetalMemes,3b7b97,bad_balisong_handler,13,Fri Jun 26 19:42:46 2015 UTC,Why is this funny? Or a meme?  You are making fun of someone for calling djent bands brutal? Is that the joke?  Is this over my head? I don't get it.
MetalMemes,3b7b97,nickinkorea,-3,Fri Jun 26 19:25:46 2015 UTC,"Shit, you could have just downvoted it. Jesus.   EDIT: maybe I should elaborate a bit so i don't come off as quite such a huge asshole. I am not calling the entire djent subgenre shitty, nor am I making fun of someone for calling djent brutal. I was only trying to poke fun at a FICTIONAL person who carries the mentality that he has a mature and varied taste in heavy music, when in reality he only pays any attention to the lower quality bands of a particular subgenre without exposing himself to a wider array of bands/styles.   I guess I should've worded the post a little more carefully, but I didn't really expect anyone to take it so seriously seeing as it's a fucking meme."
MetalMemes,3b7b97,zach_buddie,10,Fri Jun 26 19:49:34 2015 UTC,The joke  ^  ^  ^  ^  These guys' heads.
MetalMemes,3b7b97,dalekslayer96,2,Sat Jun 27 03:19:32 2015 UTC,woosh
MetalMemes,3b7b97,HvyMetalComrade,3,Sun Jun 28 15:54:22 2015 UTC,Because 'shitty' and 'brutal' are always exclusive from each other right?
