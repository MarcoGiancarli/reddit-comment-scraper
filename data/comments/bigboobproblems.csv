The TL;DR: Wash your bras every 1-2 weeks. Wash them by hand in a sink or shower with gentle detergent if you really want to make them last forever. If you don't have time for that (like me!), then zip them up in lingerie bags, toss them in with the rest of your laundry, and run your machine on a delicate (i.e. not hot water) cycle.   After either method, hang them up to dry. Under NO circumstances should you run bras through the dryer, as this will nuke the stretchy fabric in no time flat."
bigboobproblems,3dv4pa,AskMrScience,3,Mon Jul 20 22:40:50 2015 UTC,You can get some lingerie wash and hand wash them every 2-3 wears to expand the life of your bra. Stuff like eucalan and soak are lingerie washes.
bigboobproblems,3dv4pa,Moonforehead,2,Sun Jul 19 21:16:37 2015 UTC,"I have a little bottle of powdered soap called Forever New that I use. I handwash my bras in lukewarm water using a sprinkle of that (a little goes a long way). I gently squish the bra around, let it soak a minute, squish a little more, drain, rinse, rinse...rinse. Then hang dry overnight.   In summer I wash more often, probably once a week or so. Winter I go a little longer (but also have a wider range of bras to cycle through, I don't wear molded/padded cups in summer because it's too hot)."

bigboobproblems,3dpyp7,grandteton,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:58:59 2015 UTC,"Things to help backs:  â¢properly fitting bra. Measure her underbust snugly then as tight as possible.  If there isn't much difference definitely start with the snug measurement.  Then while she is braless measure around the fullest part of her breasts.  Repeat this while she leans forward face to the ground and laying flat on her back. There is a calculator on the sidebar of /r/abrathatfits but basically you take the average of the three and subtract your band measurement from the bust and the number of inches difference  will tell you the cup size.   â¢ A good mattress is paramount. I don't care what your physical composition  is, a bad mattress will cause pain.   â¢ doing core exercises. It's good to have a strong core.   â¢ don't put too much weight in the bags being carried (especially if done so on one shoulder) and  make sure that any lifting is being done properly."

bigboobproblems,3dlsce,bbpsecondary,25,Fri Jul 17 08:33:23 2015 UTC,"I've had this happen.  My right boob is basically not longer attached to my chest wall on the top right side.    Basically it's up to you.  It sounds to me like your doctor is trying to give you options especially since you've injured yourself, it's likely to keep happening.    In the end it's your body and your choice."
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,NurseAngela,10,Fri Jul 17 12:01:43 2015 UTC,what do you mean it's not attached?
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,emphesym,10,Fri Jul 17 14:23:22 2015 UTC,The mammary tissue (the boob) has pulled away from the muscle wall of the chest.  And while it's still attached by skin and fat and veins and things like that it's kinda free floating.
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,NurseAngela,11,Fri Jul 17 15:10:30 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry if this is rude, but I have to ask... Does this make your right breast significantly elongated compared to your left? Or does it have no visual effect?  I didn't even know this could be a thing."
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,TantalizingTroupial,4,Fri Jul 17 15:23:58 2015 UTC,No since its only on one side. You can see it (or I can) there is a small visual difference and there are huge stretch marks right where the tear is.  But it doesn't overall change the shape or function of my books.   It makes bras harder to fit.  Pretty much all curvy kates not longer fit because they dig into the space.
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,NurseAngela,3,Fri Jul 17 18:03:59 2015 UTC,"wow, how did you learn this? I've always had this crazy thought that at some point my boobs were going to detach from my body due their weight, as a joke/exaggeration thing. I didn't know it could really happen!"
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,NurseAngela,2,Sat Jul 18 10:52:36 2015 UTC,About two years ago when my right boob detached :(.
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,belousugar,2,Sat Jul 18 12:03:59 2015 UTC,How did you know that it detached? Did you feel it? Did it hurt?
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,grandteton,44,Sun Jul 19 11:15:09 2015 UTC,"I think doctor's sometimes can say things very matter of factly that they don't realize is going to be somewhat hard for the patient to hear. What she should've said was, have you ever thought about getting a breast reduction? What are your thoughts/fears/hopes for getting one?  I understand the feeling of feeling betrayed by these things on your body, but in the end it's up to you how you see them. If they really are a nuisance and you do fear for the sagginess that comes with age, or the possible spinal problems, then get them re-sized a tiny bit. They'll still be your boobs, just lightened up. You wouldn't feel badly if you had some extra weight on your stomach and lost that, right? It's a similar feeling with breasts, only you can't exercise them smaller.  If you don't feel that way about them, if you don't feel like you have enough problems with them to warrant surgery, then tell your doc thanks very much for your opinion but I'm going to keep them the way they are. It's your body, and in the end you get to decide how you treat  it. A doctor is just trained to look at things purely from a medical standpoint and not an emotional one, and to be fair we all have emotional relationships with our breasts."
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,grandteton,13,Fri Jul 17 13:17:32 2015 UTC,I have gigantomastia. It's not really that big of a deal and it is definitely up to you about surgery.  Definitely keep  babying yourself with the injury though. If you don't  heal then it may be  less of a choice just because you may have continued injury.
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,cakeordeath,3,Fri Jul 17 12:37:40 2015 UTC,"hehehe, babying it indeed, I do hoist it in my arms as if I was carrying a baby when braless :P  I know, the term is just.. I don't know medical stuff, I don't think it is a medical condition or chronic mutation... just very huge boobs it just sounds like a syndrome, ""Diagnosed with the syndrome of chronic giant boobitis"""
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,double-dog-doctor,3,Sat Jul 18 10:54:54 2015 UTC,For me it almost is a condition.  Luckily the growth has been slow but they've continued to get bigger even as I hit age 30. It's been over a year since my last spurt so I'm hoping I'm done.
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,UptightSodomite,11,Sat Jul 18 16:40:09 2015 UTC,"I've been wanting to have the surgery for about 20 years, at first for looks, and better fitting clothes, and now mostly to relieve pain and be able to exercise comfortably. Even as happy as I am about my finally upcoming surgery, I have to admit that I felt strangely sad when I learned that the insurance called it ""medically necessary.""  Like you, I felt kind of betrayed by my body, and wished it wasn't something I had to deal with--why couldn't I have been born with a more ""normal"" body???  Sure, I could keep wearing the best bras I can find, and manage the pain with chiropractors and PT. But my boobs are preventing me from living the life I want, and the back pain and pinched nerves in my shoulders are just going to get worse.  I just couldn't handle it anymore. My point is, I completely understand how you feel, and surgery is a very personal decision. Your body, your choice."
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,Crikey-Way,2,Fri Jul 17 12:12:10 2015 UTC,"I'm getting a breast reduction a week from today, and this is exactly how I feel.  I love my breasts, and I think they're wonderful.  But I wish things fit better.  I wish I could exercise comfortably.  I wish they didn't actively try to destroy my nerves.  I felt relieved that my insurance company thinks that my quality of life would be improved by having smaller breasts, but at the same time...I feel shitty because it feels like my body is actively fucking itself up.  I look at myself and it doesn't feel like my boobs are giant.  But then I see the notches that my bras have created in my skin to support the weight of my breasts, and remember the constant pain I have in my neck and back.    I'm incredibly excited for this surgery, but I also feel like I'm losing part of my identity."
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,hilbertisoutofspace,29,Tue Jul 21 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, it's up to you. Who cares if you have saggy boobs and you stoop a little when you're old? That's going to happen anyway, if you live long enough."
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,CrystalElyse,3,Fri Jul 17 10:50:30 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm 28 and it does affect my image as much as I'd like to help it. They are already pretty much at my belly button and I cringe to imagine if they get lower in a few years, which I know is inevitable. 35yo is not ""old"" and the possibility of boobs in my hips may sound ludicrous for most, but not far fetched for me :("
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,hilbertisoutofspace,4,Sat Jul 18 10:57:43 2015 UTC,You should only get one if you feel you need one.. Surgery is a big deal and you don't need to get a breast reduction of you don't personally feel like it's a problem. But seems like if you do want one in the future you could get insurance to cover it Bc of the incident and your doctors response.
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,MutantToenail,11,Fri Jul 17 16:24:43 2015 UTC,"Even if your breasts are down at your knees without a bra, that's purely an aesthetic issue and not actually a physical problem. I don't see why people (especially plastic surgeons who seem to have their websites written up to make others feel bad about themselves and how they look) seem to be so troubled about this. I have breasts of comparable size to you and I've never personally had any pain, but I've had my GP check out my breasts before (I had a mole on one which I thought was a bit suspicious but turned out fine), and she hasn't said a word about their size. I feel like this is an area where some doctors may have pre-conceived ideas and biases.  If you want to get a breast reduction after due research and consideration, that's fine, but if you don't, I think that's okay too. If you're worried about it, getting a second opinion is probably a good idea."
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,beccabug,21,Fri Jul 17 11:41:17 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, it can be a physical problem if you have pain. A LOT of women have backpain from the extra weight and it can lead to spine problems. It's not common, though. If you don't have any pain it's just aesthetics, but for a lot of people it is an actual medical problem. Please don't dismiss it because you personally don't get pain.   I do agree that it's entirely up to OP as to whether or not she feels it's necessary and that she should get a second opinion, though."
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,Goddess_Keira,3,Fri Jul 17 15:04:24 2015 UTC,I perhaps articulated myself poorly. Pain is obviously a reason to look at getting a reduction. I just meant that having breasts which aren't perky is an aesthetic reason and seems to be one of the main issues that OP's doctor is putting forward to suggest getting a reduction.
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,chuckbown,24,Fri Jul 17 22:08:12 2015 UTC,"For an elderly person with limited mobility it can be a hygiene issue, for what that's worth."
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,sierramoon,7,Fri Jul 17 13:24:26 2015 UTC,"It's not purely aesthetic though, I mean if you don't want a reduction that's fine. But women who do want a reduction actually have physical issues, it's not about looking better. It doesn't matter how big your boobs are, it's their size in comparison to your body size that matters. I for example am just under 5' tall, 120 lbs and I have G cups. I was up to a D cup at 15, so I've been dealing with it for a while and I can tell you it hurts, I actually have awful posture and a bit of a hump.   However, a woman at like 5' 11"" with G cups wouldn't have the same problems as me and probably would not need a reduction. My breast aren't in proportion to my body at all, and that causes issues. So no it's not about aesthetics.   Edit: I haven't changed my flair yet, but I can assure you I'm a G cup."
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,Goddess_Keira,5,Fri Jul 17 18:30:22 2015 UTC,"Even if your breasts are down at your knees without a bra, that's purely an aesthetic issue and not actually a physical problem.   I'm sorry, but I have to disagree with this. It may or may not be seen as a physical and/or aesthetic issue, depending on the individual woman, but there can be no denying that in the very uppermost size ranges such as the OP and yourself, and often at smaller but still voluptuous sizes, there can be very real physical problems. And these problems will tend to cumulate over time. What is perfectly tolerable physically while in your 20's and 30's could lead to a lot of physical pain and spinal damage in the 40's or 50's, if not addressed by then.  This is a very individual issue and the OP should make this choice based on herself and her needs and wants, as should every woman in a similar situation. The doctor was too aggressive in her advice, but I don't think it was out-of-line for her to comment on the physical health issues that may result from having gigantomastia. I realize that's an awful-sounding name for it, but it is a reality regardless of how any woman chooses to deal with it."

This is any business.  Create a problem and then market yourself as the solution to that problem.
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,smallgirlhugebra,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:50:37 2015 UTC,"Well, even without pain it would not be a purely aesthetic issue, there's also being able to function normally and be able to move around without your boobs smacking you around your waist and hips, sitting and having your boobs touch your legs and such.  Yes there is pain, the usual back pain and pain removing the bra at night and wires digging since not all bras can fit right. Of course these won't kill me but are still there  I think that the breaking point is when you can't let your boobs hang by themselves anymore, where they surpassed their own weight limit.  Do you find the weight of your boobs burdensome? I do feel dragged by them and keep wishing for a vacation from them.  I do find it interesting that being of similar size you have not felt pain, do your boobs support themselves? I wonder if there's an important weight or shape difference that could affect this."
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,Magratt,9,Sat Jul 18 11:15:09 2015 UTC,"I had a reduction about 3 months ago.  Best thing ever.  I understand that some women bristle at the idea that their large breasts could cause health problems, but the fact of the matter is, they can.  I had neck pain for about 10 years.  I never attributed it to the pull of my breasts, but afterwards, what used to be an almost daily pain has only happened once in 3 months.   My breast reduction has been amazing and I highly recommend it."
bigboobproblems,3dlsce,RegisteredTM,3,Fri Jul 17 14:35:10 2015 UTC,"I can empathize completely with how you feel, and I'm certainly not suggesting you ""should"" or ""must"" have a reduction. It's upsetting. My mother used to suggest to me that I should have a reduction when I was in my twenties and early thirties. I would have no part of it, but in my case if I'm honest, the reason stemmed from an extreme fear of surgery. Any kind of surgery, even life-saving surgery. I've had a few major surgeries since then, and lived through them, and my fear of any kind of surgery is actually worse than ever.  At the time my mother was urging me to have surgery, I was probably ~34FF/G (guessing) if correctly sized. When I first got correctly sized, I was in my fifties and a 38GG. I've been lucky that I haven't had any pain or damage that I think was associated with my breast size, but I do wish I'd had a reduction many, many years ago (I'm nearly 58 now). I would have a reduction now, except for other overriding health reasons, and the fact that I still have an unholy terror of surgery, and the fact that I'd probably no longer qualify to have it covered because I've lost so much weight that at ~32G my boobs are now seen as being not so very large, and they're mostly saggy skin folds now.  I think your doctor's language and attitude about this were too aggressive, but I don't think it was inappropriate or wrong of her to raise this as a valid option and consideration for you."

Though, I've never been told I needed one by a doctor as I've always been in a good health, I work hard on my strength and posture. Honestly, all the sedentary desk jockeys I know/work with have way worse back problems then I do.  So, why the fuck does everybody feel need to tell me that my body is messed up? It's MY body and I don't your advice or opinions.  This is YOUR choice. Not something like ugly words like giagantomastia or phrases like ""too big"" should shame you into doing.

I'm still growing (a few cup sizes in the last year) and sometimes catch a view of myself in the mirror and go ""OH MY GOD!"" or when the laptop screen goes dark all i see are boobs and get a little shocked or worried. That being said, I choose to be positive about it. There is nothing WRONG with me. It took me a long time to learn to feel this way but I feel that I'm beautiful.   Do mine behave like yours?

bigboobproblems,3d0vlp,Crikey-Way,10,Tue Jul 14 06:52:37 2015 UTC,"What does ""too big"" mean?  I'm a FF, generally, and I don't regard myself as particularly ""too big"".    If people make comments, know that really, they're giving more information away about THEM than about you -- people can be dumb and project things onto other people that just aren't true, and there's not much you can do about that other than not let it bother you.    And just as a warning -- boys are dumb about boobs, particularly when they're young.  It's because they have no idea what they're talking about but feel like they have to sound like they do.  You will run into some idiots along the way.  Just know that they're idiots."
bigboobproblems,3d0vlp,localgyro,23,Sun Jul 12 16:25:16 2015 UTC,"There is NOTHING WRONG with your body. It isn't, and will never be, too big or too small. It's just yours. If people make comments, you just have to ignore them - they're almost certainly just insecure about themselves and don't know how to deal with it.   That said, do visit /r/abrathatfits, because I thought I was a 32D, turned out to be a 26GG (I'm 16 btw), and it made me feel so much better in terms of comfort and security."
bigboobproblems,3d0vlp,goodoldfreda,2,Sun Jul 12 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"17 here, went into ABTF like two years ago thinking I was a 34D, came out as a 28FF (now 28GG, because, well, growth). Absolutely life changing."
bigboobproblems,3d0vlp,dezeiram,16,Wed Jul 15 10:35:36 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I would head over to /r/abrathatfits and properly measure yourself. A common misconception is that D is this huge size reserved only for porn stars. This simply isn't the case. Also, a correctly fitting bra can actually make your boobs look a little smaller. A natural D is relatively small anyway - I recommend visiting The Bra Band Project to see what I mean.   Secondly, I was about an F/G when I was your age (though I thought I was a DD) I did get some comments, because I was one of the only girls in my year who was that developed. I dealt with it by ignoring them - seriously, they're just looking for a reaction. You will have friends who do not give two shits what your breast size is, and those who do care aren't worth it.  If they get irritating, you can go down the sarcastic route with replies such as ""OH MY GOD REALLY? I had noooooo idea my boobs were big! Thank you so much for telling me!"" or looks down at chest ""HOLY SHIT DID THAT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT? NO WAY I HAD NO IDEA."" Just be super over the top and then point out that those sort of comments are totall unneccessary.  But honestly unless it becomes an issue, try not to worry. Boobs are awesome! :)"
bigboobproblems,3d0vlp,NotYourStereotype,6,Sun Jul 12 16:56:23 2015 UTC,"What's your band size? ""D cup"" doesn't really specify how big your breasts are in relation to the rest of you.  Also, ""too big"" is an entirely subjective opinion. The sooner you make peace with your boobs and accept them as they are, the better.  The only other advice I can offer is to make sure you're wearing a properly fitted, supportive bra."
bigboobproblems,3d0vlp,DmKrispin,2,Sun Jul 12 19:57:44 2015 UTC,Sorry. My band size is 40.
bigboobproblems,3d0vlp,SD_Bitch,7,Sun Jul 12 20:07:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I was a 38 DDD starting freshman year of high school, and the only real comments I got about them were that I looked proportional (since I was also a size 18). Those who may say hurtful things are only in it for a reaction, so just don't give them one.  As many others have said, go on over to /r/ABraThatFits to get a proper fitting. I thought I had stayed a DDD until I was in my late 20's, but wow, I was very wrong! A well fitting bra will most likely de-emphasize your breasts, and make you feel a whole lot better."
bigboobproblems,3d0vlp,talesofa30band,4,Sun Jul 12 21:35:31 2015 UTC,"Nope. I'm your same age and am a 30DD/E. It is medium-sized at most. I don't look huge, just normal-sized. I'm about to start freshman year too. I also suggest you get your A Bra That Fits measurements too. I am a 30 band wearing a 32 because it's easier to find. I wear a snug 32D when I really need a 30DD/E."
bigboobproblems,3d0vlp,pewpass,3,Sun Jul 12 20:18:27 2015 UTC,"Own it! New boobs are probably the time that boobs are most exciting. I had my family of all people really make some hurtful comments when I first got them, telling me that I needed to cover up and that I couldn't wear shirts like other girls do anymore. But screw that dress the way that makes you the happiest. People in high school will comment on something or another even if you didn't have boobs at least there is pretty strong comeback for this one, anyone who tries to say shit about your boobs is absolutely peanutbutthurt and jelly.  Like some other readers suggested I'd go to abrathatfits, I thought I was a 34F in high school but that was only because it was the highest cup size I could find in stores. A great fitting bra goes a long way for confidence about them. How are you going to be comfortable with your boobs if they themselves aren't comfortable?"
bigboobproblems,3d0vlp,lightning_crashes,3,Sun Jul 12 17:59:47 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with you or your boobs. At all. No matter what anyone says. You'll definitely want to take your measurements, and key them into the ABTF calculator. It can't hurt to double check, especially if you've been fitted by places like Victoria's Secret. Their fit methods are self-serving, because it fits you to whatever they have. That's what happens when you're dealing with a tiny size range that consists of 15 different sizes in store. Compare that to the UK full bust brands like Curvy Kate and Panache, which come in anywhere from roughly 40-90 sizes per style. A 40D means a 40 inch ribcage and a 44 inch bust. Does that sound accurate for you?   If not, and if you get a different size as a result, don't worry. I promise you there are bras out there in your new size that you'll love. There are also bikinis and one pieces in your size too. They're bras I would never have even dreamed of existing in sizes beyond a D cup."
bigboobproblems,3d0vlp,Crikey-Way,3,Sun Jul 12 21:20:37 2015 UTC,A D is neither big nor small bc the cup size (letter size) is relative to the band. And also if it's proportionate to your height and weight or whether or not you're projected/shallow may have an effect on whether or not you appear busty.
bigboobproblems,3d0vlp,teramisula,3,Sun Jul 12 22:29:25 2015 UTC,Nope.
bigboobproblems,3d0vlp,unfunnypun,2,Mon Jul 13 16:28:34 2015 UTC,"First of all, a D-cup can be anywhere on the spectrum. The letter doesn't mean much. A 28D is a 32B, while a 40D (you) is much larger overall. Regardless, either could look big or small depending upon your frame.  I don't feel breasts are too big unless they're literally limiting you. If you feel so uncomfortable about their size or they are physically causing you harm (e.g., back pain), then you may want to look into a reduction once you're older. But right now, you're very young.   If people catcall you, they're being disrespectful. I wouldn't even acknowledge them, but if the problem persists, notify a teacher, counselor, or your principal. You should not be harassed or feel unsafe, and if anyone makes excuses for offenders (""boys will be boys""), don't take that shit! Not to suggest only guys can be rude. Just the first thing that came to mind."
bigboobproblems,3d0vlp,spasticjedi,2,Mon Jul 13 19:14:16 2015 UTC,"Hi there!  I'm 24 years old and started growing my boobs at around 12 or 13.  I was almost fully filled out by the time I was 14, and, though I wasn't made fun of to my face, I always heard comments behind my back like ""why does she think she has to stuff her bra?"" or comments about my boobs being really saggy.  I was miserably self conscious about my boobs because of this.  It didn't help that I could never find a comfortable bra.  I had to be a D-cup, right?  That was the highest Walmart had.  And I must have been a 40 because any D-cup smaller than that didn't even kind of fit my boobs.  But I never felt supported, my boobs were always uncomfortable, and they looked awful.  When I heard the saggy comment, I figured I must just be sizing myself wrong, so I went down to a C cup because at least it gave some upwards pressure.  By the time I was in college and looking for sexy bras, nothing even kind of fit well, especially underwire.  My shoulders and back were starting to hurt, and there was a permanent divot in my skin where the straps of my bra sat.  Fast forward to 2 years ago.  At this point, I was so body-conscious from the entire world telling me that my boobs were wrong.  I hated everything about them.  Then my boyfriend suggested the miracle that is /r/ABraThatFits, and I learned for the first time that there are very natural sizes above a D-cup and that I am, in fact, a 34HH.  My bras fit wonderfully, I've lost any pain associated with them, and I'm absolutely in love with my boobs.  The point of this post is - everything that you're worried about CAN happen.  But don't let it.  Big boobs, while they do have their problems, are amazing.  If I had been properly sized from the very beginning, I guarantee that I wouldn't have been worried about my body and wouldn't have had a care in the world about my boob size.  Don't repeat my mistakes.  It's really easy to be confident about your boobs when they look beautiful.  Get properly sized and feel as great as you should.  :)"

You can find cheap elastic styles on Etsy for under $15, and most styles run in the $20-$35 range. The $50 mark is usually pretty high-quality, and you can usually find leather options at that price point, too.   Unlike the bra, it's not as picky in fit, as most styles are designed to frame the bust, so cup size and shape are irrelevant. Most are elasticated or have buckles to adjust the fit, so the fit really is as simple as S/M/L, even for full-busted women. Buy based on your ribcage, and that's really all there is to it.   I follow a model who is a 28G/GG and wears them regularly. The brand she recommends is Malice Lingerie, whose styles run about $25GBP-$40GBP."

bigboobproblems,3cr9cy,sextarts,5,Fri Jul 10 03:22:29 2015 UTC,"I've ordered. Shipping is a bit slow from UK and for some reason they won't take my chase/visa debit but will take my Wells Fargo/visa ""debit"" (it's an eppicard that my child support automatically goes on it)  I find it endlessly amusing my ex who never wanted anything to do with me physically (it's amazing I have 2 kids) is ""funding"" bras. But in reality he pays very little for child support and I make 4x what he makes (he is obliged to pay 25%) so he really isn't paying for much. Lol.  Returns were scary because I shipped back like 4 bras and they took FOREVER. Way longer than it took to get here. Insuring was like 60 bucks so I went uninsured and was very nervous. Seriously like 6 weeks!"

Yeah I'm hoping anything and everything I order will fit because returns over seas sound long and scary (and expensive.) Besides the nerve wracking aspect of returns was Bravissimo staff helpful with the process? Did you end up returning or exchanging bra's (just curious for if I ever have to.)"
bigboobproblems,3cr9cy,turkeysrule,3,Fri Jul 10 16:31:36 2015 UTC,"The good thing about Bravissimo is that they have their own house brand which is actually pretty good.

bigboobproblems,3cr9cy,equiraptor,3,Fri Jul 10 06:29:42 2015 UTC,I don't live in the UK either. It was basically a proof that they aren't just some random website.
bigboobproblems,3cr9cy,grandteton,2,Fri Jul 10 07:23:22 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I've had some poor experiences with FigLeaves. Shipping times vary from about 4 weeks to 12+ weeks. They blame US customs for this, but my Bravissimo orders (which also have to go through US customs) consistently arrive in 2 weeks. And, at least on the bras I order, the price difference between Figleaves and Bravissimo is small. The added cost with Bravissimo is worth both their service (their email support is good) and the consistent shipping, for me.  (Obviously, I'm in the US, not Canada, so your experience will vary slightly).  ETA: FigLeaves also has crappy support when I try to contact them for things. I can't get any information from them about bras (while Bravissimo is very responsive and informative by email). And when I contact FigLeaves to try to figure out what happened to one of my ""it's taking more than 6 weeks, what's going on?"" orders, their support staff is uninformed and gives me the runaround. They directly contradict statements on the FigLeaves website, and I have to quote the website and give them a link to where the quote was from before they will actually do anything. I keep giving them another try, and I keep having bad experiences. I have better experiences with BraStop and cut-rate sellers on Amazon and Ebay!"

Though I'm willing to wait longer for the order to get here I would really prefer to deal with a company that has good support and service (especially in case I need to return/exchange something.) Price isn't the biggest concern for me (I already spend an arm and a leg at places like Victoria's Secret to get bra's that barely fit so if I can find some that do, the cost isn't a huge issue) so if the difference between Figleaves and Bravissimo prices is as minimal as you say then I doubt it would be worth it to even attempt to use Figleaves"

bigboobproblems,3cs2ov,Kartarsh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:28:49 2015 UTC,"This is an issue both my busty mother and I have dealt with in the past. The rash can actually be a low key fungal infection as opposed to just a ""sweat rash""; if it is a heavy moisturizer (like argan oil) is not going to help. Dabbing the area with isopropyl alcohol two or three times a day will work wonders for either kind, and is very cost effective. It usually only takes a couple of days to clear everything up.   Alternatively, if you don't think an astringent is the way to go, unscented baby powder or Gold Bond powder aren't as fast-acting but can help clear it up. Powders can be very effective at keeping moisture issues at bay.   Here is a little different of a solution for keeping control: (http://ladygrace.com/product.asp?pn=727) You probably won't feel sexy with it, but it can make super heavy sweat situations (mowing the lawn, etc.) way more tolerable.

The bra should also be snug enough so it doesn't move around at all so you don't get any rubbing under breasts.  Honestly I think you can improve the situation a lot (if not eliminate it entirely) by taking a critical look at your bra fit.  http://brasandbodyimage.com/2012/09/05/putting-your-bra-on-properly/"

bigboobproblems,3cmdf3,SayceGards,11,Thu Jul 9 04:35:56 2015 UTC,"Most women don't finish growth until 24-26 on average. The majority of growth is done early in puberty, but it's not completely done by the time you're 16/18 except in very rare cases.  I've only just turned 23, so it's likely I'm still experiencing minor growth changes, but the majority of the changes are due to hormonal changes from an IUD I got in February (which was, surprisingly, copper, so it would have been hormones from my body reacting to a foreign body in uterus). I went up about 2-3 cupsizes then inside 2 weeks after it was inserted, with minor changes now (2 months after having it removed, due to pain/perforations)."
bigboobproblems,3cmdf3,diagetic_getdown,3,Thu Jul 9 04:45:33 2015 UTC,I did this too around 26. Went from a G to a J. It fucking sucked. I also gained some weight which just made everything worse.
bigboobproblems,3cmdf3,Moonforehead,2,Thu Jul 9 13:08:54 2015 UTC,This makes me worried to get my IUD now. I just bought two G bras after going up from a FF. I can't afford another change this soon ;-;
bigboobproblems,3cmdf3,Moonforehead,3,Thu Jul 9 14:10:53 2015 UTC,"Don't stress too much.   I know I'm a special case when it comes to birth control - everything I've tried has had horrific side effects, and the copper IUD was a last choice since I react so poorly to hormones. Most likely, you won't have any issues - even the Mirena has low enough hormone levels that most women don't have noticable breast growth from it.   And like /u/diagetic_getdown said, you can always try places like Zulily or Ebay for cheap bras. There's also the bratabase listings and /r/Braswap for new & lightly used bras, usually at a sizeable discount. And if you prefer to go Polish, Comexim (through the Comexim website, not Wellfitting) translates to about $30/bra with shipping if you're in the US ($42 for me in Australia)."

And if I do mess up and wear something that eventually shows off my girls too much they'll cover their eyes. They've also made comments about being jealous of my ""porn star tits.""  All of this makes me extremely uncomfortable, and the few times I've complained about not being able to find my size (of which I swear is the bra equivalent of a unicorn) they will roll their eyes or dismiss it.   That being said, maybe this girl keeps bringing it up because she thinks you got your boobs together and maybe she wants to be properly sized? She might also just be desperate for a girlfriend, and thinks that this is a good way to bond.

I know some people speak more openly about their breasts, jokingly or not, but it's been a really rough road with me and them, and it's unpleasant to be inside my body.

That is probably something she does not even realise. She either realises it and wants to make you uncomfortable (in this case she is not a good friend at all) or she is utterly oblivious to how uncomfortable it makes you.   You need to communicate that you don't like talking about your body at all. No mincing words, spell it out for her."

bigboobproblems,3coraz,grandteton,5,Thu Jul 9 20:15:59 2015 UTC,"That does sound really awkward. Maybe she doesn't believe you about your bust size and thinks shopping together will prove you wrong? I don't know why else she would keep saying things like that.   Maybe you tend to wear looser clothes to hide your bust (I know some posters here do), so she doesn't realize how curvy you are? Or, if you estimate her at a 28C/D, there's a good chance she's wearing 32As or something and has the belief often found in society that DD is huge and anything above a DD is insanely massive (I get the impression that you're in the UK, which definitely has better bra options than the US, so I'm not sure if that belief is as widespread there as it is here). In which case she probably thinks ""Oh, you're about a 34C/D, surely you can find something that fits in the store"" or something? I know women with smaller busts often just forget that their larger busted fellows don't have some of the same options that they do (which is understandable), so I would just leave it at that if she didn't keep making comments about you being about the same size."

bigboobproblems,3clq7u,talesofa30band,6,Wed Jul 8 21:58:49 2015 UTC,"Don't sweat it. It's not about matching your numbers precisely, it's about you being comfortable. If that means you size up, no biggie. If you'd prefer a 30 band to a snug 32, go for that.   You shouldn't have to feel like you need to defend yourself for not wearing as snug a band as others do.   To be honest, the only reason I wear my bands so snug is for support. I measure at 31"" loose and 29"" tight, and wear a 30 band. I still manage to rip the hooks/eyes out of everything up to a 36 though, but true-to-size or loose 32's and larger don't give me enough lift, but that's likely only because I'm hovering around the JJ/K range. If I had a smaller bust, I'd most likely want to size up.   Sometimes people get so caught up in numbers that they forget a properly-fitting bra is about comfort. The fit criteria are criteria to get the best fit, support, and comfort for most women, but playing around with size is always an option. Don't like the way it feels? Change it. You don't owe anyone an explanation. Your comfort is what's most important here, and that's all it is. Go for loose, go for tight, whatever you please.

bigboobproblems,3cfh1n,neomaxizoomdweeby,32,Tue Jul 7 14:35:27 2015 UTC,"I get what you are saying, but I feel that the problem isn't that they are fetishized, but rather when we are only defined by them.  I realize that men are going to see large breasts in a sexual way, and I don't think that is a problem.  And I think that a fetish for a certain body part/type is simply a stronger sexual attraction to that type of body.  In a way, I guess I don't think it is fair to say that some women are born with big breasts, and that is ok, but some men are born with a stronger sexual attraction towards big breasts, and that is not ok.  Again, I don't think that him marginalizing you to just your boobs is good - it's a rude thing to say to anyone.  But I guess I just don't extend that feeling to fetishization of large breasts overall.  Does that make sense?"

Your points are solid, but when we all talk about fetishisation we mean people seeing you only for your boobs/skin tone/other physical feature, and being attracted to you solely for that. Which is an issue."
bigboobproblems,3cfh1n,goodoldfreda,2,Wed Jul 8 15:42:00 2015 UTC,"The difference between being attracted to large breasts and fetishizing them is exactly that behavior. It's the same with guys who have a thing for Asians or redheads. Being attracted is fine. Being the sole focus is not. A lot of times people overuse the term fetishizing but this is the true use of it. I once had a guy say that he wanted to just remove my breasts and snuggle with them and sleep with them etc. There was no interest in my person, just my breasts.

For example: I daringly wore a wrap around dress that showed off my girls' size and my roommate, during a dinner party, interrupted my story to tell me she can't hear me because my boobs are so distracting.  Or as a medical student, nurses will make comments about how big they are or standardized patients tell me to watch out and cover up even more.

I don't think I would want a reduction, as at the moment they are not detrimental to my health and I don't like the idea of unnecessary surgery (not that reductions are unnecessary, but that to get one would be unnecessary for me).    I get really mad sometimes when my husband pays too much attention to them because it feels like... like they are objects that he is worshiping that are more important to him than our relationship.  He claims that if I wanted to get a reduction or if I needed to have a mastectomy loosing the boobs wouldn't be a big deal, but I feel like if something happened to them he would lose part of what I think he identifies as me.

Sure it feels amazing to have them touched and massaged by a partner, but if he seems to disconnect from me as a person while he's doing it and get's lost in boobfetish land, then it's kind of a drag.

Men seem to find my breasts attractive--I notice lots of glances and occasional staring--but very few men fixate on them now. To be honest, I've had far more issues with men fixating on my ass. In my experience, a shapely bottom is compelling to most men while what's regarded as an attractive breast size is highly variable.

This one has adjustible straps and enough coverage that it could help avoid overspill, although I don't know how you feel about having to pull it over your head.

I never knew this and I always just assumed I had inherited her larger boob proportions. It wasn't until I was about 20 that I found out they weren't real. Interestingly, my maternal grandmother had a breast reduction because her enormous rack was causing major neck/back problems. Maybe it skips a generation."

Her mother, on the other hand, is pretty much built like I am, so I assume that's where I got the big boobs. My sister is the same way, too, so at least I had someone to empathize. My mom really didn't know what to do as they got bigger, so my bras didn't fit really well when I was a kid/teen. I kind of learned on my own what works and what doesn't."

She fit fairly well in a 34G I gave her.  My grandma on my dads side is 5' and all boob, but she sticks to matrix sizes too. I'd guess 36H or there abouts. She yo yo diets and goes up and down 60lbs fairly regularly and of course that changes breast size, particularly when you are that short.

I think having a large breasted mother helped me accept having large breasts since she understood everything I was going through, especially during the ""outgrowing bras every 2 months"" stage. We were the same size until I started the pill and my boobs jumped up to an H. She is still very supportive but I will say that since I outgrew her, she has been cracking a few jokes about the size of my breasts. I can tell she's just joking and she's the best mom ever so I don't mind the teasing. We do argue occasionally when she tells me to ""put my boobs away"" when she feels like I'm showing too much cleavage. Still, my mom is definitely my busty role model! :)"

Her mother was quite large busted, and while I have no idea about my dad's mom, my aunt is only a cup size or two smaller than I am.  I desperately wanted a reduction when I was younger, but my mom was adamant that there was nothing wrong with my body. I've never had back issues associated with the size of my chest, and over time I've come to accept them as they are, though I do appreciate that they're getting a bit smaller as I lose weight."

Pretty awesome though how life works out sometimes, the things that cause you so much pain end up saving you from death.

bigboobproblems,3cbd6q,The_Truth_Fairy,5,Mon Jul 6 21:11:58 2015 UTC,"A curvaceous woman is thanking her lucky stars after she was saved from certain death â by her BOOBS.  Mum-of-two Sarah Foster used to be ashamed of her 38JJ bust before they came to her aid by protecting her during a car crash.  The 28-year-old stopped in a lay-by to smoke a cigarette before getting out to make a phone call.  Married Sarah was horrified when a car travelling 80mph smashed into the central reservation and headed straight for her.  But the curvy mum's chest bounced straight off the windscreen and instead of being crushed into the tree with the car, she was sprung over the car and on to the road.  Amazed doctors revealed Sarah had no broken bones and told the relieved cleaner her super-sized chest saved her life, by acting like an AIRBAG to cushion the blow.  Sarah had amazingly booked an appointment to discuss a breast REDUCTION just days after the horror smash, but has now vowed never to get rid of her lifesavers.  Buxom Sarah, from Pontefract, Yorkshire, said: ""The doctor said to me - I remember it so clearly - he said 'I don't know how you survived'.  ""We were in shock. They said your shoes have been blown off, your clothes have been blown off, we don't know how you are here.  ""I asked 'what saved me?' and they said my boobs bounced me off the windscreen.  ""They were all bruised - and they said that literally saved my life.  ""I was really overwhelmed. We just cried and it was a terrible thing to go through.  ""The ambulance woman came back to me too and she said I was really lucky to be alive and I had to be grateful to have my 'airbags'.  ""That was the word she used.  ""She said I had my own airbags and I turned to my wife and said 'I was going to get rid of them, I was going to get rid of them'.  ""If I'd have got rid of them I might not be here today - they saved my life.""  Curvaceous Sarah was self-conscious about her 38 JJ boobs and was starting to suffer with extreme neck and back pain, before her accident.  After discussing it with her wife Marie, 37, she decided to book an appointment with her GP to discuss reduction surgery after weekend away for a christening.  ""I was having really severe back problems and my neck was starting to hunch over where my boobs were literally weighing you down,"" she recalled.  ""Me and Marie were talking and I was like 'listen I just really want to get rid of them, I can't do it anymore' and she said we'll go to the doctors then after we've come back from the christening.""  She was driving to the event in Leighton Buzzard, Beds., with the couple's children Steven, 13, and Megan, eight, when they stopped in a lay by.  Sarah jumped out of the car for a cigarette and to make a phone call, standing on a path between the layby and a field, off the A1 near Peterborough, at lunchtime.  Shocked Sarah turned around just in time to see a Mini Cooper smash into the central reservation, and turn to head straight towards her.  The terrified mum turned to have one last look at her family before she remembers seeing the air bags in the car deploy just before she hit the car windscreen - boobs first.  Her horrified family saw her bounce off the car and catapult over the vehicle into the road, before the Mini smashed straight into a tree.  Sarah said: ""I hit the windscreen, and heard the smash, and my boobs hit it so hard it just smashed and I don't remember anything after that.  ""Marie said I bounced and went straight over the top of the car.  Care assistant Marie dragged unconscious Sarah off the road, called an air ambulance, and she was taken to Peterborough Hospital.  The impact was so intense it ripped off her clothes from the waist down, and medics strapped her to a board and sent her for countless tests.  But miraculously she escaped with torn knee ligaments and severe bruising to her chest and body.  She said medics said she was saved by her huge natural boobs, which acted just like an airbag to both cushion the blow, and bounce her over the car away from harm.  ""I went into majors and I had scans, x-rays, and blood tests done and everything you can think of,"" said Sarah.  ""I was in a lot of pain but believe it or not I didn't break any bones in my body.  ""The doctors told me that if I wasn't so big chested I probably would have been dead and that my boobs saved my life.  ""The doctors stressed that quite a lot to me - that because of my size and my boobs, they saved my life.  They said if I had been really skinny I wouldn't have bounced and just stayed on the car and gone up against the tree that she hit, but instead I bounced and rolled.  ""When they said that to me I said 'no, I'm never getting rid of them, they are staying'.""  The female driver of the Mini was not charged after the accident was apparently ruled a ""freak accident"", but Sarah was awarded Â£5,000 from the motorists insurance company."

From what I know about corsets, if they are made custom they would be able to do the job of a really great bra. They'd also allow you to either go strapless or work with lace or shoulder-baring styles that still fit your high-neckline look."

bigboobproblems,3c98r3,bigcitylights1,2,Mon Jul 6 20:47:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a corset lover myself. For a good place to start as a beginner, I highly recommend starting out at Lucy's Corsetry. She's got a ton of youtube videos so you can see reviews, and a heap of information on the difference between tightlacing and waist-training, the pros and cons of an underbust vs. overbust, items commonly mis-labeled as corsets, how to choose a size and how to corset safely. She's also got a lot of guided galleries for things like cupped overbusts, overbusts for full-busted women, underbusts under $200, etc. etc.  For beginners, I generally recommend Timeless Trends, Restyle or Orchard Corset, as they're budget-friendly, well-made and curvier than others in their price range. Timeless trends comes with a lifetime guarantee, and Restyle has one of the curviest corsets in this price range (the Wide Hips style)."
bigboobproblems,3c98r3,apricotmuffins,2,Tue Jul 7 00:57:33 2015 UTC,"My only issue with an overbust is that I don't want a lot of cleavage. There are corsetieres who make overbusts for the full-busted but they are still pretty cleavage-y. Having high-set breasts, I usually have cleavage up to about 1.5"" under my collar bones anyways (which I'm trying to avoid).  Even cupped overbusts have a lot of cleavage going on for smaller-busted than I.   I really love corsetry, which is why I'd love to have one worked into my outfit (more using the wedding as an excuse to get something I've been lusting over for months), but I'm actually not into them for the bust support, of all things."

I realize the side-sections on that particular one are lace, but I wanted to find one that also incorporated a corset for support.   To be a queen anne, basically, the front bit can be straight, a sweetheart, or even a modest v, but the sides come in and cover your shoulders to make a bit of a diamond shape, and the back has a high collar; this reduces the amount of skin you're showing and makes it a bit more feasible for people with our set of problems (and means you can wear a bra!)  Technically, Kate Middleton's dress was also a queen anne.   Incidentally, that particular photo I found at Wish Bridal, and it looks like they do custom sizing? I bet they could put an opaque backing fabric behind the lace on the shoulders, if you wanted. I wouldn't have them replace it entirely; that might pucker and gather strangely since they're not used to working with something different, but it could be an option?"

I wear 30JJ and corsets work fabulously on me. The trick is that you have to get it custom; there's no off the rack corset that will support your bust and make it look good. Make sure you find a corsetier who is experienced with large busts.   You might also consider a full Victorian gown, like this lovely bride. She wears 36HH."

I even buy quite a bit from DD Atelier and Pepperberry and still haven't found many styles that aren't super cleavage-y.   The longer I look, the more convinced I am that I just want to go custom.

My wedding dress was custom and its great to have my boobs and tummy appear where they are supposed to rather than letting off the rack make you feel like a freak. Plus then when you fall in love with different styles, you can theoretically get it Frankensteined onto the same dress.   If you go with a lace upper part you could probably also have a flesh colored fabric sewn under to have the lace effect while still keeping your straps.   Personally, I went strapless with my dress and just had the dress reinforced with boning to help the bra out.   Other ideas include building a well fitting bra into the dress."
bigboobproblems,3c98r3,Amphigorey,3,Tue Jul 7 05:53:17 2015 UTC,"My sister is a similar cup size to you and got married last year. Advice would be:   chiffon material is more forgiving than silk on the bust. go for a plunging neckline (really) but get a seamstress to sew in a modesty panel for you. A good one will be entirely unnoticeable, and can be made from the fabric from the bottom of your dress. avoid strapless as a final look, but again if you find a strapless dress you love a seamstress can sew in straps, a halter or even a lace overlay neckline if they are good enough. Straps stop there from being a vast amount of flesh between chest and neck and just balance the whole look out a little bit. It also adds a smidgen of support and security."

bigboobproblems,3c98r3,Ominous_Octopus,3,Mon Jul 6 21:06:05 2015 UTC,"My #1 piece of advice, which I took myself for my wedding in 1982: Figure out what bra/corset/whatever you're going to wear on your wedding day, the one that fits and makes you feel the most comfortable, and buy/design your wedding dress to fit it. I'm not in the same size range as you, but I knew when I shopped for my wedding dress that most of the styles available were not going to cut it with my go-to bra. Bearing in mind this was 1982, strapless was not a thing at the time. It was all high necklines and long sleeves for fall and winter weddings, but with the illusion fabric over the upper bodice that wouldn't hide a bra strap. Strapless bras were never a viable option for me--no support--so all of those were right out. (I never realized at the time that possibly they could be lined with skin-tone fabric, but with illusion sleeves also, that may not have looked so great. Still better than bra straps showing or unsupported bust).  I second the suggestion of looking into Queen Anne necklines (which is what my dress ultimately turned out to be, with coverage over the shoulder area so a regular bra could be worn), and also looking at some of the ""modest"" bridal gowns that are very beautiful and cut high enough to cover a bra or custom corset. However, with one of those you'd need a lot of custom alterations and a very good tailor/alterationist who could advise you what will work for your figure."
bigboobproblems,3c98r3,TinCanBanana,3,Mon Jul 6 22:48:27 2015 UTC,"Here's the dirty secret behind wedding dresses: most of them don't have proper shoulders or sleeves that might hide bra straps because that's the part that's most different in fit from person to person, and expensive to alter when it's wrong. Strapless, halters, and lace ""shoulders"" are a way for manufacturers to avoid having to make a dress that actually fits, while still claiming it's custom.  A boat/bateau neckline might be a good option for you. I've found that they're flattering for my large bust because they draw the eye up to my shoulders, and they also let you wear a regular bra."
bigboobproblems,3c98r3,apricotmuffins,2,Mon Jul 6 13:04:18 2015 UTC,You could try a qipao or cheongasam. They're pretty simple to make so a lot of sites do custom made for ten dollars. Maybe something like this?  Edit: Wait I just read that part about the lace. Sorry :( I've been looking into this too with a similar problem. Changed the link.
bigboobproblems,3c98r3,cant_be_me,2,Mon Jul 6 16:13:15 2015 UTC,"There are some options out there, but you do have to search much harder for them. Have you thought about a style like this, this, or this? Where you could actually wear a bra with them. Or, if you could get a bra that fits that has removable straps, you could put in those clear straps they make and wear that under a dress with a thicker lace like this (the lace would have to be thick enough that the shininess of the plastic strap wouldn't be noticeable). I'm going to be in the same boat as you very soon and I refuse to buy a dress I can't wear a bra under, so best of luck!"

Of the gowns and corset styles I've liked, all but two have been Edwardian silhouettes (or edwardian-inspired). The corset I've been lusting after for years (and finally have an excuse for purchasing a $600+ corset) is an Edwardian S-bend underbust.   Not to mention the level of embellishment and the exquisite laces they use make the girlish part of me squeal with excitement. I've also discovered the rabbit-hole that is pre-1900's corsetry and gowns (and that there are still a surprising amount around being traded by collectors worldwide), and I'm lamenting that it's probably not a good idea to wear a 120+ year old gown (nor would I likely find something I love that fits, and be able to afford it).

bigboobproblems,3c98r3,apricotmuffins,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:38:11 2015 UTC,Allure has a modest line. Order for your largest measurement and then everything else can be taken in. You can wear a bustier/corset underneath or have a seamstress build in a bra. What kind of look are you going for? And wedding dresses are sold as strapless because it's easy to add straps but very hard to cut them off and have a still functional dress. Straps can usually be added for $100-200.  http://www.allurebridals.com/category/modest  I think that Christina Hendricks picked a very flattering gown. Sexy without being too scandalous for grandma.  http://imalbum.aufeminin.com/album/D20120711/867911_VLPOYUJEGZWA54WAANXLAZCK8KBRK4_robe-de-mariee-des-stars-35_H113309_L.jpg
bigboobproblems,3c98r3,Cyrridven,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:04:04 2015 UTC,"So, you can go strapless and pick up a shoulders-only cover-up. There are many that are thick enough with lace and/or beading to conceal a bra strap that's the same colour (that's what I did).

Because if the strap is intended to fit around, say, a 42"" chest measurement, then it expects the front half to be some 21"".  So the cups are spaced in such a way as to spread across the 18"" or so that wind up as the front of the chest.  If I'm trying to put it on a chest measurement of say, 32"", I'm going to have cups in my armpits.    I first removed any spacing between the cups, and second, usually sewed a dart or two into the bottom to continue to narrow the width while allowing the projection."

Actually, that might be another fix - If you could turn the bottom into a pocket with slide rather than fixed cups.

All choices aren't equal (for instance cosmetic surgery is dangerous) and it's not like ""oh this particular woman just happens to think big breasts, a small waist, a round butt, a small nose, lighter skin, and relaxed hair look prettier on her, that's nothing to do with harmful societal messages at all, it's just her personal preference."""

There are so so so many people who like small breasts, natural hair, big women, and large noses.   That being said, is there really anything wrong with wanting to be that stereotypical beauty?

bigboobproblems,3bp2g1,Fugera,3,Thu Jul 2 11:34:25 2015 UTC,"IT HAPPENED TO ME:I Got a Breast Reduction and Men Shamed Me for It  Apparently, I insulted the boner.  Kadia Blagrove  Kadia Blagrove   Â· Jun 30, 2015      It has been a little over a month since I got my breast reduction surgery. Sharing my journey so publicly was nerve-racking for sure. Not only did I reveal a very personal piece of my life, I accompanied my story with nude portraits of my body pre-surgery in honor and appreciation of my natural, ginormous 34HH breasts. Despite the nerves, I was ready to share my story with the people who would relate.   Photo by Justin J   I was also ready for the inevitable criticism. I knew this story would reach a lot of women who may not have found a space to truly discuss such a taboo topic. I know Iâve had a difficult time finding relatable breast reduction stories. I am grateful to the writers, artists and creators before me who have explored and unveiled less-talked about realities for folks who donât relate to âtypicalâ experiences.   So this risky exposure was definitely worth it. Thankfully, my story received much more love than negativity. What was alarming though was the number of men who have contacted me personally (one even finding out my phone number -- scary) to express how my decision to get a breast reduction affected them. Apparently, I insulted the boner.  Skip past all the main details of my story, in which I mention the years of severe back pains, neck pains, shoulder pains and also the psychological issues that come along with having big breasts in a world that assumes big boobs = sex (even when youâre only 9 years old), the one takeaway these particular men got was that I had low-self esteem, was too fat, and paid âthousands of dollarsâ to get plastic surgery.   (FYI, I didnât pay âthousands of dollarsâ for my surgery. This was a medical, not cosmetic, operation and was fully covered by my insurance. In the past, despite it being difficult to get a good workout with large heavy weights attached to your chest, Iâve gone down from a size 12 to a size 8 and still carried size HH breasts.)  The emails and comments from these angry guys were all pretty much the same: âBut you look better with big boobs! Iâm a boob guy!â âBut men find that sexy!â âYou will regret the surgery because... reasons!â   And of course, a womanâs nude shoot canât get by without a bunch of âyou fat bitchâ comments. I tried my best to ignore the negativity and only shot back at one or two commenters. (Shout out to the supporters who had my back!)   However, it has been a month and a few of these angry guys are still harassing me. They arenât sending me threats, thank God. What I am currently dealing with are men who are on a mission to fulfill their faux-feminist duties and save me from making my own decisions on my body. Like this guy for instanceâ¦  Totally responded to this guy.Totally responded to this guy.      In his horrible attempt to help me see the light, he misses the irony in his statement. If me getting breast reduction is me becoming âanother creation of a society that objectifies women as objects for sexual gratification,â isnât me keeping my painful heavy boobs for your pleasure just the same objectification?   So many women of all ages and walks of life have reached out to me, sharing their personal breast reduction stories, asking for my advice, sharing their own advice, and even just discussing body issues in general. It has been such a beautiful experience connecting with so many people, especially about a topic most people shy away from due to shame and embarrassment.   Breast reduction surgery, though a common procedure, usually gets a bad rep because it is plastic surgery and society just canât seem to understand why a woman would want to get rid of her âsexyâ big jugs.   âWomen are paying to get what you naturally have!â No they are not.   Hereâs the thing, natural large breasts are completely different from large breast implants. One sits and the other hangs. One is purchased and the other is from genetics. One is a choice and the other is not.   You telling a naturally big bust woman not to get her breast reduced is you policing her body and dismissing her personal choice in honor of your sick and superficial desires. A few women whoâve undergone mastectomies have reached out to me and shared the same frustration. Itâs incredibly unbelievable how even with the most dire medical procedure, women are still made to feel as if their worth lies on their chest.   This is the smallest size Iâve ever been in my adult life and I still couldnât naturally reduce my breast size.     Iâll admit, before deciding on my breast reduction surgery, I worried about my appearance. For years, Iâve been known as âthe girl with the boobs.â Who would I be without them?   Spoiler alert: Iâm the same person but with smaller boobs.   It is common for anyone who gets a breast reduction to worry about how theyâll look or, honestly, how the surgery will affect their dating life. Size change and scars can bring a little insecurity at first but believe me, itâs so very temporary.   Iâm just 7 weeks post-op and I can say that breast reduction is one of the best decisions Iâve ever made. I feel so much better than I did before. The relief of tension has also kickstarted my healthier and fit lifestyle.   If you are thinking about getting the surgery, speak with a great doctor, learn about all the risks, and make the decision solely based on what you think! Please donât let the naysayers get in the way of your comfort.  Same bikini top from the previous picture. I can finally fit into it now!      And to finally address all the guys who Iâve insulted by reducing my back-aching, neck-straining, shoulder-pulling large breasts: Iâm sorry.   Of course Iâm not. Read below:  To the man who mysteriously got my phone number and called me at 7 in the damn morning, to the men who cyber harassed me and other women who chose breast reduction surgery, and to the man who went on a 20-minute rant on his podcast about how my breast reduction was an insult to black men everywhere: Fuck you.   Fuck your sexism, your misogyny, your misogynoir and, most importantly, fuck your penis.   I did not get my breast reduction to get âmore white guysâ to like me, to fulfill beauty norms, or because of âlow-self esteem.â I got a breast reduction because I wanted to.  After several years of health issues and natural attempts to help remedy my situation, I made a bold decision that affected only one person -- me. But you scolded me for taking care of my health instead of being âwhat every man wants.â   Obviously, all women are just automatically heterosexual.   And of course, all women would want to screw you. Because youâre such a catch right? You are not doing me any favor by telling me how awesome my body is. You canât uplift someone while shaming them. You donât validate a womanâs self-esteem and you hold no weight in her personal decisions.   Women donât exist for your pleasure. Titties are for babies and bras; please note that our experiences with them are wholly at the grace of the ladies who own them.   For anyone interested, you can check out some of my breast reduction updates on my blog."

bigboobproblems,3bj0o2,grandteton,6,Tue Jun 30 09:22:23 2015 UTC,"Well... in general people's defense, breasts big enough to be noticed is most of the time a female thing. Still, I'm sorry it made you feel this way, it sounds tough, Mister."
bigboobproblems,3bj0o2,laughinglampshade,6,Tue Jun 30 13:29:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that. The summer is the toughest. I try not to advertise that I have breasts but it is what it is.  To be honest,  as far as my breasts go, I don't mind having them or wearing a bra.  Women do the same thing every day and they don't complain about it. It's not their fault but, people see my breasts and then wonder, man? Or woman? Believe me, the thought has crossed my mind to go out and instead of hiding ""the girls"" try to go out as a ""ma'am"". HMMMM?"
bigboobproblems,3bj0o2,grandteton,3,Tue Jun 30 13:47:59 2015 UTC,"I'm genuinely facinated with your life, I can't even picture what it could be like for you. I admire your positive spirit :)  May I ask how old you are and when the breasts made a difference in  your life?"
bigboobproblems,3bj0o2,laughinglampshade,2,Tue Jun 30 19:58:33 2015 UTC,I was  about 10 or 11 when they first showed up. By the time I was 14 I was wearing a bra daily and the rest is history.
bigboobproblems,3bj0o2,grandteton,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:57:09 2015 UTC,How is it a problem?
bigboobproblems,3bj0o2,laughinglampshade,2,Tue Jun 30 03:42:56 2015 UTC,"I don't consider it an insult,  but, I'm a guy."
bigboobproblems,3bj0o2,KingKittj,4,Tue Jun 30 14:07:41 2015 UTC,It's a problem in that it causes anxiety.  I'm under 40. I shouldn't be called ma'am yet.
bigboobproblems,3bj0o2,grandteton,8,Tue Jun 30 03:50:58 2015 UTC,"I thought ma'am was just a non age attached term generally used for people aged 20+. Also I don't think it causes anxiety for everybody, maybe just you and a few other people."
bigboobproblems,3bj0o2,KingKittj,5,Tue Jun 30 04:22:26 2015 UTC,"You'd be so wrong about the anxiety.  A large percentage of women have issues being called ma'am under the age of 40. It has the connotation of being ""old"" and is far from an ageless term."
bigboobproblems,3bj0o2,grandteton,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:49:36 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on where you're from. It's a term of respect for women in the 40+ range around where I live, but a coworker of mine is from a southern state and calls all women he works with(including high school girls) ma'am. For him it's a respectful habit he has. It felt weird at first but after he explained himself I now take it as the compliment he intends."
bigboobproblems,3bj0o2,KingKittj,0,Sun Jul 12 01:03:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that's  40+. Again, I am under 40."
bigboobproblems,3bj0o2,Wibblybibblybobbly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:25:41 2015 UTC,"I'm nearly 20 years away from being 40, but like I said, just try to take it as a compliment! You'll feel better thinking someone is at least trying to be respectful, even if it seems a bit off. Especially if someone doesn't know your name, such as a salesperson, it's meant as a sign of respect so try not to take it as an insult!   :-)"
bigboobproblems,3bi2de,pandalei,2,Mon Jun 29 11:59:32 2015 UTC,thats very unprofessional....
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,show_time_synergy,8,Sun Jun 28 23:04:57 2015 UTC,What's the brand/style of that bra? I like it!
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,carolineo,3,Mon Jun 29 00:47:49 2015 UTC,I second this thought!  Tell us /u/show_time_synergy :)
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,p0ppyc0ck,7,Mon Jun 29 01:43:01 2015 UTC,"/u/carolineo /u/totallymisreadit   I know VS doesn't get a lot of love around here... But they came out with a sports bra line a few years ago that's worth a second look.  It's two bras in one. You guys. TWO BRAS IN ONE:  a regular front clasp underwire encased by a front zippered sports bra.  Downside is that they only go up to DDD. BUT the sports bra layer is forgiving enough to compensate for what pops out of the cups, for my Gs at least. It's a (much) cheaper alternative to special ordering nursing-specific bras in my actual size.  Before I found these I was relying on nursing tanks. sobs"
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,carolineo,3,Mon Jun 29 02:11:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the link.  Ahh!! It has 12 colors! I'm so excited right now!
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,Pikachu42,7,Mon Jun 29 05:40:05 2015 UTC,I use fresh breast. It goes on like lotion and dries into a powder.  I love it!   It didn't work zip lining through Mexico though.
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,katf1sh,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:37:25 2015 UTC,"Is that what it's actually called?? Also, I need this lol where can I buy it?"
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,Pikachu42,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:15:43 2015 UTC,Yup. Fresh breast. They also make fresh balls and fresh foot. I got my tube from Amazon.
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,katf1sh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:30:22 2015 UTC,Ooh I knew about fresh balls! Should have made the connection haha. Does it actually work?
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,Pikachu42,2,Thu Jul 2 00:16:58 2015 UTC,Yes! Just make sure you apply it in all the areas you think you'll need it .
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,rinwashere,5,Thu Jul 2 00:54:55 2015 UTC,What do you use? Nursing pads work better than i thought they would.
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,personal_failure,4,Sun Jun 28 23:44:49 2015 UTC,That's a really good idea! I still have a stash of washable ones too.   Right now I'm just doing a lot of bra laundry. :/
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,shaylabearj,4,Mon Jun 29 00:00:16 2015 UTC,This stuff has been handy for these hotter months.
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,kuripan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:55:27 2015 UTC,"What's it like to wash off? Does it absorb into a layer of stuff to wash off? Or does it prevent sweating at all, like an anti-perspirant?  Edit: words"
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,atouchofyou,6,Mon Jun 29 02:25:52 2015 UTC,Is it safe to put deodorant on your boobs for this issue. I have this problen too. I was looking for ideas.
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,Pippafert,7,Mon Jun 29 01:15:10 2015 UTC,I use deodorant for it on the hottest days. I've never had any problems.
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,totallymisreadit,2,Mon Jun 29 01:19:43 2015 UTC,There's no reason it wouldn't be safe. Your armpit skin isn't all that different from the skin on the rest of your body. (It is a little different but not much.)
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,flamingzucchini,6,Wed Jul 1 12:58:35 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter what type of bra you have you sweat through it in the summer. Even with air-conditioning. I am so happy you posted this because I can not stop sweating no matter what bra I wear. It makes me feel so not alone. Thank you!
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,ltracey42284,4,Mon Jun 29 01:59:06 2015 UTC,"Solidarity, sister. boobfistbump  Also, the Google attempts at finding an image for this comment were hilarious."
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,noys,3,Mon Jun 29 02:39:48 2015 UTC,WHERE DID YOU GET THAT BRA! its everything i want it to be...
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,noys,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:40:59 2015 UTC,I put Certain Dri under my boobs last night.  Let's see if it helps me out today in the 101 degree weather we are going to have...
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,senkidala,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:05:45 2015 UTC,Anhydrol Forte works wonders. 20% solution of aluminium chloride hexahydrate.   Get it from your doc. NO sweating at all.
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,noys,2,Mon Jun 29 15:08:06 2015 UTC,"Boob sweat is pretty much inevitable with a compression bra... You'd see at least 75% less with an encapsulation bra.  EDIT: Downvote me here all you want but seriously, you are downvoting my good advice in other subreddits that people rely on? Get a life, people, and stop breaking reddiquette."
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,noys,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:22:18 2015 UTC,"This is a combination bra; encapsulation + compression. The support it gives is unbelievably life-changing.  To be fair, the pic was taken after an hour of sweaty chores."
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,SiliconeJulie,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:25:19 2015 UTC,It definitely doesn't fit like an encapsulation bra should.
bigboobproblems,3bg6x3,noys,2,Mon Jun 29 08:27:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, it doesn't look like there's any encapsulation/separation going on... they just look squished together. No wonder it's sweat city!"
