nycpics,3dba21,0hmyscience,2,Wed Jul 15 17:13:26 2015 UTC,"When you scroll and release, the page is suppossed to keep scrolling at that speed and slow down at a given rate. Yours is either slowing down too fast, or it jumps way too much. For example, if I gently scroll from the top so I can see the first image, it basically scrolls down to the third image.   I think it's trying to do something where it has these predetermined positions on where to stop, but they're arbitrary. But this is just a guess."

If you are not shooting put your camera in your camera bag. and if you are super paranoid you might want to avoid using a camera bag, because it is obvious to anyone what is in there. then you can easily convert a messenger bag or backpack into a camera bag to be a bit more discreet."

nycpics,3995mr,brainkandy87,2,Fri Jun 12 07:36:58 2015 UTC,You're way more likely to have a phone snatched out of your hands than a camera. Often the phone is more valuable.

nycpics,3995mr,mleland,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:40:11 2015 UTC,"Obviously there are times when you should keep your kit concealed, but crowded places often offer easier opportunities for thieves on the lookout for fancy gear.  Be wary of this particular con for example, popular in busier locations (I haven't heard of it being that common in NYC though), where people might feel safer just letting their camera hang round their neck. It's becoming more and more common nowadays because of the proliferation of pricey/easy to sell lenses, and that it's also clearly quite easy to pull off. I've even heard of kids being taught how to remove the lens whilst the parents/adults distract you with a map. Try to develop an instinctive reaction and hold your camera firmly whenever you're approached unexpectedly.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YWaloz-Duw"

The wing itself isn't super reflective per se, it's just that its dark out and he's flying above a pitch black surface (the Hudson corridor), so it's naturally going to reflect a lot of the surround light.

It seems like you may have applied a thick layer of noise reduction and contrast boost?  It also seems like the horizon is cocked a little clockwise, but that might be my wonderful sense of balance (none of my photos are ever level, I have to recrop them every time, I'm a mess). I'd try to bring up the blacks level a bit and lower the contrast, it seems like all the darker parts of the image on the left are just pitch black.   Like I said, the composition is nice, the tracks give you a nice counterparty to the streets and both pull your eyes to the skyline, I like that a lot. Maybe try a recrop to eliminate the upper half of the clouds where they look all watercolor painting-esque, might help a bit.  Solid image though, if you decided to ignore my advice completely it still looks pretty good :)"

nycpics,2yb2sb,michaelconfoy,2,Sun Mar 8 04:04:33 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of L.A. and it's street cars. Funny how it use to be one of the biggest cities for public transit. NYC stayed smart, and L.A. is playing catch up.."

Sure, the weather could be better, but it's the cost of doing business in one absolutely amazing city. I've lived in bitter cold and I've had to run my AC in January; I'd still personally rather be here."
