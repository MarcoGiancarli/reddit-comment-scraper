FitToFat,37zke5,iscrapedmyknee,22,Mon Jun 1 01:30:04 2015 UTC,What I don't get is how celebrities can get this fat. They are faced with before and after pictures constantly. TMZ destroying them over every little pound gained. It's not like a normal person who can pack on 5 pounds a month and no one says shit about it because feefees.

FitToFat,37zke5,thaloopdigga,20,Sun May 31 21:20:05 2015 UTC,He has depression and substance abusive problems.  I heard that since his father died he never really fixed his depression.  This is probably the lowest he's been and it's manifesting itself in this ever-expanding waist.  Such a shame.  You can see the self-hatred and hopelessness on his face.

FitToFat,37zke5,scrodzilla,5,Mon Jun 1 00:54:14 2015 UTC,I dont understand how someone with that much money could get to that point.  He should have a personal trainer and chef and nutritionist at his disposal.

If someone has all that money he could be with the hottest chicks around but because he is a fat pig he won't be. So with all that money he could have the best setup to get it done. And you are right he has neither will power or motivation
