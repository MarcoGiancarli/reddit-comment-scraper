The verses (one of my fav parts of the song) sound so weak because they aren't playing the riff like in the studio version, but instead they are playing it the way like the riff before the verse riff. Furthermore I really dislike the drumming (inb4 ""Lars hater!""), for example the missing double bass fill in the second chorus which is really awesome. Also, they cut out the last chorus and the really, really cool part right after it :/ Still a pretty good live song, but I like the studio version much much more."

Metallica,3dsd2t,justo316,2,Sun Jul 19 07:53:28 2015 UTC,"I listened to a live version and the album version and the verse riff sounds the same to me. Just F5 and E5 chords. On the album version I did notice possibly more ""scuffing"" in the pre-verse riff which seems to be changed to palm mutes in the verse.   Maybe it sounds weaker to you live because there are fewer layers of guitars? And because it's not as tight as the album version? I once read in an interview where James said that when you're singing and playing at the same time, either the singing or the playing will suffer. Also, don't forget that on the album James is playing all the rhythm guitars and is totally locked in.   Edit: the verse riff is just E5 and F5 chords before being little hook of Bb5-Bb5-A5 repeated"
Metallica,3dsd2t,Justintimejjc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:49:27 2015 UTC,"It's not the same. In the studio version, they play the muted E string once and then the open E5 power chord 5 times at the beginning of the verse riff. These open power chords make the verses sound so powerful. Live they play the muted E string once, then 1 open E5 power chord, then again the muted E string and then two times the open E5 power chord. This is the same way the pre-verse riff is played (live and studio)"
Metallica,3dsd2t,Heizungsrohr93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:56:33 2015 UTC,"I dug a little deeper and listened to guitar-only studio version. You're right, the verse riff is different from the pre-verse riff. Even the rhythm is different. He does this thing with the switch from F5 to E5. In the pre-verse it anticipates the vocal pattern exactly. (If he started singing over it, the second syllable of ""justICE"" would get the first F5. An interesting chord because in E minor F#5 would be in the scale, but here it's flattened) But in the verse that part has a different rhythm and doesn't exactly follow what he's singing.

Hetfield and Ulrich have huge egos,  and so does Mustaine,  there was no way the three could coexist. Hetfield and Ulrich would always have each others backs since both of them basically started it. I mean look at Megadeth,  i think he has complete control and direction.   Also,  Mustaine's writing and Hetfield's were different,  Mustaine is more thrash,  while Hetfield's is a bit more inspired by Cliff Burton and melodic."
Metallica,3dneeb,ryangt47,3,Fri Jul 17 23:31:02 2015 UTC,"We basically saw this play out with Jason. He wasn't an ego, but, like James and Lars, he was an alpha. Queue the power struggles and all the shit that followed.  It's been my opinion that part of the reason Robert works so well with the new line up is because, like Kirk, he's a beta. (Note that I don't mean it a bad way, it's just what their personalities are like. There's no judgement.)  That's all to say, I agree with your point. There's no way even a sober Mustaine would have lasted."
Metallica,3dneeb,runbobarun,2,Sat Jul 18 02:42:22 2015 UTC,I don't think it was a power struggle with Jason at all actually. I think Jason knew his place in the band but just wanted to do a side project that had nothing to do with Metallica and James just put the kaibosh on it.

Dave does not have the emotion that every Metallica album has.  It worked with KEA because of how raw it was but after that it would have been a clashing of styles.  I'm glad they each got to flush out their own sound and neither has to compromise.  It also would have been a travesty if kirks solos would never have been.  shudders  Itd be very interesting to visit those parallel universe's but if I had to guess I'd very much prefer this one.

Metallica,3dneeb,AlmostEasy89,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:09:36 2015 UTC,"They probably would have broken-up anyway, sure. Still, I think they mostly get along musically. I don't recall anyone in Metallica bad mouthing any of Dave's albums. And remember too that Dave has some songwriting credits on Ride the Lightning so its not as clear cut regarding the style divergence. Dave would probably be game for anything Hetfield came up with as long as it was heavy and he could solo over it. For what it's worth, Kill em all is pretty much proof that these guys gelled musically. If they were under contract to only interact on musical terms I guarantee that they would do a lot less ego crashing than most folks would suspect. The split was not about artistic differences, it was about Dave taking his antics too far and blurring the line between the asshole stage persona that people actually loved and the real backstage Dave who would get the band into fights and banned from clubs. It was a good way to get the music press looking at the band but Hetfield wisely concluded that it would lead to disasters where Dave would be out of commission for extended periods in jail or the hospital."

He could have tried to work with James and Lars but in the end he would have wanted more of a frontman position. He would have either quit or have been fired.  Either way he would still bitch about it."
Metallica,3dneeb,kevonicus,0,Sat Jul 18 05:25:54 2015 UTC,I think Dave's influence would have been a negative one and he would have left eventually anyway. Megadeth is corny sounding as fuck and always have been and I don't think he could have evolved with them.

But they probably won't come to the U.S. for a while so probably not gonna happen . :/

I personally think they should make it a point to play every song they've ever recorded across the next tour - maybe even with the stipulation of at least one song from each album at every show.    I'd lose my shit if I got to see them play ""The Outlaw Torn"", ""Devil's Dance"", and ""My World"" live."

Metallica,3dee8g,Matthew94,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:09:32 2015 UTC,Eh? Do you have a crappy speaker or what? Even with the bass being pretty buried you should hear the difference without a problem. It just sounds so.. empty. There's nothing to fill the space between the drums and guitars.

But I agree, Carpe Diem Baby is a very underrated song and in my opnion, one of their best songs of all time. The riff is heavy, James' voice is amazing and the lyrics are thoughtful.    Where The Wild Things Are, Better Than You and Fixxxer are also very underrated songs from Reload."

Metallica,3dbb6p,heavykevy1983,7,Wed Jul 15 17:09:17 2015 UTC,Mercyful Fate from Garage Inc. That transition guitar riff after the intro.
Metallica,3dbb6p,metallikoh,8,Wed Jul 15 04:30:49 2015 UTC,That's very hard. I'll have to name a few.  Disposable Heroes - harmony part in the solo  Suicide & Redemption - the harmony  Dyers Eve - the breakdown may be my favorite. Some of the best moments in metal tracks are when familiar riffs get repeated twice as heavily.
Metallica,3dbb6p,SuicidoCheez,3,Wed Jul 15 12:03:05 2015 UTC,That riff in Dyers Eve right after the solo is a monster. Just so thrashy.
Metallica,3dbb6p,TristanCorb,5,Wed Jul 15 21:11:01 2015 UTC,Mine is the 4:47-5:05 mark in Master of Puppets where the soft riff goes full distortion. Chills every time

Not knocking Milwaukee, but Lars probably forgot about it by the time the next show came around.  The band is extremely busy when they tour, and most shows are very similar.

I suspect the US ""market"" is less interested in you as an act without a new album/product to promote. Touring costs money. A lot of it, and if you're investing in it, there's not always a guarantee that you'll get your money out of it.   It's likely ""safer"", from an investment perspective, to send a band to a smaller # of festivals, relying on MANY bands to draw ticket buyers to the venue, than it is to try and book your single band to a string of dates all across the US."

Metallica,3cy9ma,dragonsky,7,Sat Jul 11 21:35:20 2015 UTC,My cousin once tried to tell me that Metallica ruined a perfectly good Lou Reed album.  I told him crack is whack.
Metallica,3cy9ma,Stop_Rock_Video,5,Sun Jul 12 05:50:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Lou Reed hasn't had a good album since Transformer. And for rock fans you'd probably change that to ""since he was in Velvet Underground"". He fucked up on this one by just thinking he could jam over anything that ""any band"" plays as long as it has blues scales.  If I were in charge of this mess:  1) Get background band who's familiar with Lou's working methods and tastes  2) Lay down tracks with classic VU \ Lou Reed type arrangements  3) Cut up the song structures where his lyrics and vocals meander sorta Doors  style and change the arrangement in those spots entirely  4) Amp up the beats a bit to make it heavier  5) Cut the vocals up and quantize them to the new beat  6) Have Metallica listen to the highly edited version and produce heavy covers of the songs  7) Re-sync Lou's vocals to the Metallica covers  8) Have Lou listen to the results and memorize the changes  (and maybe offer suggestions to change here and there)  9) Re-record Lou singing over the Metallica versions  Really the key would be step 2. You'd need a band who understood how to get that classic ""I'm waiting for the man""\""Sister Ray"" type sound.   Well, that and step 8 where Lou has to actually practice his performance skills rather than just ambling into things as if he's just continuing the same jam session for 40 years.   Honestly, I've seen him do ""Sweet Jane"" where his backing band was just knocking it outta the park and he was more or less acting annoyed that they weren't just sticking to the most vanilla rendition so he could wander all over the fucking place. He's probably played with a fair number of jam musicians who could develop an intuitive response to his wandering but he's gotten so reliant on that he seems to think that every band can hear him slow down a single word and know that he wants new chord changes or different riff. Even the Allman Brothers, who can basically write whole new (and well arranged) songs during a jam, needed some sort of ""system"" (signals, conventions, etc) to weave that stuff, they weren't just following a singer pulling shit out his ass and expecting them to psychically develop new arrangements on the spot. So many cool musicians get into that mode and end-up producing garbage results.  Too late for Lou though."

If someone has an abridged version with most of Lou edited out, I might actually listen to it a bit more. In it's current state, I'd say one proper listen for curiousity's sake then shelf it.

The acoustic section, and the guitar harmony.   I asked my mom to buy me the album, which she did. When we got home she read the lyrics and was going to throw it away, but my dad convinced her to let me keep it.  I remember at the time I didn't like battery. It was too aggressive. I was used to def leppard and bon jovi.   I still consider master to be their best album, although I love all of the first 4, and a lot of the songs on later albums."

Metallica,3crnof,drenahmeti22,2,Fri Jul 10 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"2 years ago, I wasn't listening to music a lot. I kinda liked stuff that you usually listen to in the radio, like Katy Perry. I found a guy in my school that liked Linkin Park, so I started to listen to them again. I was getting into hard rock and alternative metal stuff, like Linkin Park and Sum 41.    When I searched for new stuff to discover, I found Slipknot, that seemed very heavy to me. I loved that group, that was exactly what I was looking for. Later, I also discovered Destrage, which is a metalcore band (not 100% metalcore to be honest, but it has a lot of metalcore elements, so...). That band has growls (alternated with clean singing/screaming), but they are kinda different from other death metal bands.    A few months ago, I had an homework to do for school: we had to discuss about songs that talk about drugs. I looked for ""metal songs about drugs"" on Google and I found some songs, and one that was mentioned a lot of times was ""Master of Puppets"" by Metallica. I listened to it, and I skipped quickly to some parts of the songs to listen to how it sounds like. I didn't like that at all. It sounded too ""classic"" and ""old"". It wasn't ""heavy"". So, I decided to listen to other songs, but they were all kind of boring too.   After some hours, I asked myself: ""How can all these people like this metal shit? It's so boring."" So, I decided to listen to some of the songs again. I decided to listen to the ""Master of Puppets"" track completely and without interruptions, and it wasn't that bad after all.   The day after, I listened to that again, and... holy shit. That was awesome. All those riffs, those solos, that complexity... I listened to the rest of the album, track by track, day after day. That was an incredible experience.   This is how I discovered Metallica. And metal music in general.   TL;DR: I listened to ""Master of Puppets"" while looking for a metal song about drugs; I still wasn't into metal at all. They opened me a completely new world.   Thanks if you've read it all ;)"

I can't remember the FIRST time I heard it, but I distinctly remember playing AJFA in my shitty car on my shitty car stereo in the HS parking lot (that's my first real memory of them). I was already big into GnR (this is right around the time Appetite was becoming HUGE) so Metallica was a natural step for me. Managed to pick up all their albums on cassette and played the HELL out of them in that shitty car.   My HS had a talent show, and 3 guys who were in a band performed ""One"" as their part of the show. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen or heard in that auditorium!  I was pretty active in Boy Scouts all through high school (good group of people who weren't crazy religious and it was possible to do that AND be a metal head). Summer after I graduated, I was at the local Boy Scout camp with my troop as an assistant scoutmaster (had just turned 18) and I left camp that week to come back into town to see them play with The Cult as the opening act. Kirk was hanging out just off stage in between the two bands, and my buddies and I screamed ""KIRK!!!!"" down to him, and he turned and waved to us. I also remember Lars being carried around on the back of a roadie/assistant, presumably so that his legs wouldn't get too tired before Metallica came on stage. I saw Doris fall, I saw the rigging above the stage ""collapse"". My ears rang for a week after that show. Next day, I was back at Boy Scout camp."

Metallica,3cnm59,stinkadickbig,11,Thu Jul 9 08:31:29 2015 UTC,"I thought most of the solos on Death Magnetic were really poorly done. Terrible tone, nothing melodic, overkill on the wah to compensate for a lack of any real ideas. I honestly felt the intro lead bit on Hate Train was better than anything else he's done since the Load/Reload era."
Metallica,3cnm59,CharaSmash,6,Thu Jul 9 12:17:14 2015 UTC,Was going to come in here and say that. His solos lack any intensity or melody to them. It's pointless wankery on the wah pedal.  During Suicide and Redemption is starts to sound like the solo is going somewhere and then he pulls out the wah and it collapses.
Metallica,3cnm59,Matthew94,3,Thu Jul 9 22:46:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, the first part of the solo without wah is done by James I believe. Kirk plays the wah solo, and in my opinion James' is much better."
Metallica,3cnm59,SteelValley,3,Sat Jul 11 19:46:39 2015 UTC,"Really? I'll agree with you for the End of the Line, All Nightmare Long and the Judas Kiss, but that's 3 out of 14. The others may not be as good as their older solos, but they're more than good enough. Have you listened to Cyanide?"
Metallica,3cnm59,SuicidoCheez,3,Thu Jul 9 21:08:26 2015 UTC,I felt like the solo in Cyanide was doing well when it was just building off the initial riff it comes from. It hits that peak at 4:36 (I think) and then I find it's a lot of wankery from there.
Metallica,3cnm59,CharaSmash,4,Fri Jul 10 14:57:11 2015 UTC,I love the Don't tread on me solo! The little run he does towards the end is really subtle and cool. I'd say my least favorite is probably trapped under ice or escape. Trapped under ice solo are just simple pentatonic runs that you can tell were improvised and not well thought out like the rest. Escape because he steals his ideas from the call of ktulu solos and rehashes them in escape which for me doesn't make for a fun listen. I do love he ending of the escape solo though.
Metallica,3cnm59,PopPop-Magnitude,2,Thu Jul 9 09:15:37 2015 UTC,The solo at 5:30 on Hate Train has always sounded like an ambulance to me.

Metallica,3c57zn,vestergaard92,10,Sat Jul 4 22:24:33 2015 UTC,"What tension was there?   I never understood why the bass was never louder on the album. But you'll have to talk to Lars and James about that. 'Cause Jason [Newsted] was technically a better bass player than Cliff. He was much tighter and faster and all this. Musically I don't know. Did he ever co-write any of the songs? He probably did on the later albums but they never really gave the poor guy a chance. Did they?     Ohhh shit, that's interesting. I have heard people say that Cliff was pretty sloppy and this adds some weight to that."
Metallica,3c57zn,Matthew94,10,Sun Jul 5 16:16:44 2015 UTC,"I see tons of old school Metallica folks giving Rob Trujillo the business on the internet but anyone with a more than a few hours of guitar training can tell that Rob has more skill than Cliff. He's got more pocket, he knows his classical chops, and he's just a generally good metal bassist unless you are just willfully ignorant of Infections Grooves and Suicidal Tendencies. And honestly, the only thing you could legitimately criticize Jason for was that his parts lacked the melodic warmth of Cliff's. There's not even a question for anyone sensible that Jason could outplay Cliff (too) in terms of speed and technicality. Rob easily rivals Jason's skill and has a warmer sensibility than him so there's really nothing more you could ask for (best of both worlds). People looking to complain about Metallica's current sound need to look elsewhere. They've got a damned fine bass player, they just need to make some songs to make use of him.  Now that's no jab at Cliff. Whether he was aware of it or not, Cliff's decision to emphasize melody rather than rhythm in many song sections was a stroke of genius because the band was ""stacked to the gills with percussion"" so adding another beat to the mix is overkill even if that's the traditional role of bass. He found a cool niche and Rob's emulation of that style is a testament to how well it works."
Metallica,3c57zn,nbohr1more,6,Sun Jul 5 19:06:32 2015 UTC,"The difference for me with Robb and Jason is that Jason has that ability of being a great ""hype man"", he got the crowd going a lot which egged James on and so on and he was a powerhouse of a back up vocalist, unlike Robb and Kirk in those moments. Watch those two try to get the crowd going lately it just seems like they're exhausted trying to get it going where as Jason (and cliff in away) held that end of the ""production"" up very well. I even believe that on the latest MOT video James asked Robb to sing back ups on one tube (TU2), and Robb stammered searching for an excuse and ultimately landed on a joke."
Metallica,3c57zn,Prometheus357,6,Mon Jul 6 13:27:38 2015 UTC,"Did James put his parts down first?   James would put his parts down and I would give him Kirk's guitar and he would put Kirk's part down as a rhythm part. 'Cause Kirk doesn't play any rhythm on the albums I've worked on. James did all of that but on Kirk's equipment.   I thought Kirk played some of the rhythm parts.   James would play it on Kirk's equipment. On his amps and his guitars and stuff and we'd double those with James' guitars and sh-t. He's just so damn tight that it would be a shame not to use him for all the rhythm tracks.   James knew exactly what the various rhythm parts were going to be and what Kirk would ultimately end up playing when the songs were performed live?   Oh, yeah.     So all Kirk did then was solos? Sounds like the studio would have been a bit boring for him then."
Metallica,3c57zn,Matthew94,3,Sun Jul 5 16:13:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the first 15 years for Kirk were basically James and Lars saying, ""Here, play this. No, this way.""  But then again you got your live gigs, which there is a metric fuck-ton of.  Bob Rock probably facilitated the direction for Kirk to play his side/channel. Meaning James likes the left channel while Kirk takes the right channel."

Metallica,3c3rg7,heini92,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:27:11 2015 UTC,As a pianist who switched to guitar in the 80's I had a hard time playing the Master of Puppets album at the time on the guitar so I would go to the piano and do something like this but not nearly as good.   When Master was out I always thought it would sound awesome orchestrated because to me they were heavy metal classical. I was also just 14 at the time.

Metallica,3bxm6o,stinkadickbig,3,Fri Jul 3 00:12:03 2015 UTC,One of my better production jobs.  Or so what someone said two years ago. The bass does have an odd riff for the verses.
Metallica,3bxm6o,serosis,2,Fri Jul 3 10:36:31 2015 UTC,"Great job! It doesn't sound as dry as the original, which was one of it's many downfalls IMO."
Metallica,3bxm6o,serosis,2,Fri Jul 3 10:51:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I actually just combined the bass into the original without touching the original's sound at all. But I heavily doctored up the bass tracks.  Newsted hammers on his bass so hard that you can hear the picking sound through the recording, I tried to isolate and mellow it out because it interferes immensely. Thicken the bass a bit so it blended with the heavy guitars but also filter the high-end and mid-range so you could distinguish it along with the other instruments.  None of the bass tracks line up with the originals perfectly either, so I pretty much had to hack up the bass tracks on a need-to basis whenever they went out of sync. Which thankfully were usually after a long silence or pause.  Adds up to one huge pain in the ass."
Metallica,3bxm6o,SuicidoCheez,2,Fri Jul 3 10:59:54 2015 UTC,"Yep, I believe (Don't take my word) I read somewhere that he used some kind of sponge or something to make less rattling sounds on the Black Album. They're still there, but there's much less of them and the excellent production certainly helps. I actually liked the rattling on Black Album, the bass sounded really cool during the parts where it cut through the guitar sound and played on it's own, like on The god that failed. AJFA just had too much of it."

Metallica,3bxm6o,PopPop-Magnitude,2,Mon Jul 6 12:49:08 2015 UTC,"It sounds really strange. That bass line during the verse does not go well with the guitars at all, and the guitars in general sound super thin.  It was a very interesting listen though."
Metallica,3bxm6o,PopPop-Magnitude,2,Fri Jul 3 00:17:59 2015 UTC,"Well, that was a quick and dirt job in Audacity so thin guitars are a given, just wanted to show that they are a little too bassy which gives the bass guitar too little breathing space."
Metallica,3bxm6o,PopPop-Magnitude,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:22:32 2015 UTC,"This is just a comparison, so I didn't include vocals or drums as they would just stay in the way. The first part is the normal version, as in the album. The second has the low-ends on guitars cut out, which makes the Bass just so much more audible --- no, I didn't increase it's volume. I guess James was right about the Guitars and Bass fighting for the same frequencies, when you crank up the bass guitar without cutting out the guitar low-ends they just end up masking each other.  Also, this was done like in a half a minute in Audacity, and I of course simply cut out absolutely all of the low-end on guitar, so of course it would sound completely different if a real producer did it."

I really d think what went down with the mixing was done for the best. I like the way the drums sound and the guitars sound on the original, even though its really dry without bass"

In the album version he actually follows the guitar riff somewhat.  https://youtu.be/jnhlldaNp_Y?t=1m20s  Now, Seattle 89 does seem to follow the beat though he still doesn't play it consistently. It's an officially released (and edited) show.  https://youtu.be/OVXqbgnMI78?t=1m57s  Philadelphia 1989 isn't an official release and he isn't playing the beat on it either."
Metallica,3bzidg,christianraun,2,Sat Jul 4 15:53:46 2015 UTC,"I kind of think that was more of his own decision to not play it  I mean, that drum line is still nowhere near as hard as a typical line from their thrash songs"
Metallica,3bzidg,BrockYXE,2,Sat Jul 4 22:32:47 2015 UTC,"Well, he only played like 5 seconds of the double bass bit. I think another issue is that that fast double bass playing would have sounded ""mushy"" with standard microphones."
Metallica,3bsw2g,Crashiee,10,Wed Jul 1 21:45:01 2015 UTC,I remember being so anxious to hear this when I saw MetOnTour said they played a 'New Song'. It came out 6/6/06 I believe.

Metallica,3brtbo,BrockYXE,5,Tue Jul 7 01:31:31 2015 UTC,This sounds pretty bad. The bass is way too loud. I have yet to find a version where the bass sits in the mix right. Its either not there or way too out front. I wish metallica would just put out a proper remix with some bonus tracks or something. Justice is my favorite album of theirs so I don't mind the lack of bass but I would seriously give my left nut to hear the album all fattened up with a black album type sound or something in that ball park.
Metallica,3brtbo,Strider_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:36:16 2015 UTC,"I agree it sounds terrible like this. I'd prefer to not hear the bass than to hear the bass too much. Even if it was mixed correctly I don't think it would sound a lot like the black Album simply because of the different producers. I think the bass on Metallica's albums is felt rather than heard, and this fan remix just makes it too loud."
Metallica,3brtbo,spider_lord,3,Thu Jul 2 04:28:57 2015 UTC,You see the problem is there are only 5 master tracks available from AJFA so people just bass boost the album thinking thats the same as changing the volume level of the bass track or taking the time to mix it correctly.
Metallica,3brtbo,thatfuckingguy13,6,Tue Jul 7 01:46:11 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't find it better. The bass is way too loud, as seems to be the issue with the fan remasters."
Metallica,3brtbo,SHdude,2,Wed Jul 1 18:17:54 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the sound of bass guitar is pretty low in the mix on all four of Metallica's first albums.   Not as low on Kill - Master, but low enough that there's a marked difference on the Bob Rock-produced albums."
Metallica,3brtbo,weirdmountain,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:40:34 2015 UTC,"All the mids are cut out from the first albums. They make note of it in ""a year and a half in the life of Metallica"".

Black album forward they raised the mids and the bass started following more closely with the drums."

Metallica,3b2z4r,randude,7,Thu Jun 25 15:28:39 2015 UTC,"Cleveland, Ohio, October 2009. I remember vividly, I was in 7th grade and my best friend had just gotten tickets to see Metallica at Quicken Loans Arena. Holy shit. But then, a few days before the concert, my report card came back and I found out I got a B in math. Only a B!   ""Well,"" said my parents, ""that's just too bad. You're capable of more. You're not allowed to go to the concert with your friend.""  WHAT. I couldn't believe they were serious. Free tickets to see my undisputed favorite band of all time, and I'm not allowed to go because of a measly B in 7th grade math. It's not like I hadn't had a B before. Needless to say, I was devastated.  Of course, my friend had a ticket still so he ended up bringing another mutual ""friend"" of ours. I say ""friend"" because he was kind of an asshole. And after the show our ""friend"" would not stop bragging about it and rubbing it in my fucking face, which made everything even worse.  So, it's been 6 years since they last played in my area. After that show I always figured, ""Hey, I'll catch the next one."" But every year I check the tour schedule, and every year I'm disappointed. Every year they get older and older, and every year the fear of never seeing my idols in concert grows more and more real. I still haven't forgiven my parents for that, honestly.  TL:DR: Metallica last came to my area in October 2009, when I was in 7th grade. I got a B in math and I wasn't allowed to go. I haven't had a chance to see them since and I might not ever. I dub my parents unforgiven."

Metallica,3b3t1y,kestrel_rises,5,Thu Jun 25 21:25:19 2015 UTC,I'd love to see a progression of the approach they took on DM. Thrashy riffs with a fairly modern feeling mixed in with some great melodic sections and acoustics like you said. Vocally i'd enjoy more of an exploration of James' melodic singing rather than a lot of aggressive shouting. I really liked Death Magnetic to be honest and I'm sure I'll be fairly pleased with wherever they go next. I'd even dare to say that they've found a way to include some of the more raw emotion of St Anger in a way that even old school fans can appreciate so I hope they keep the ball rolling with that rather than trying to write something just to please fans begging for more straight forward thrash.

Metallica,3b3t1y,steakpienacho,3,Fri Jun 26 01:20:32 2015 UTC,"I think the 2015 set lists are a good indication of where this is going to go.  Notice there are some Load songs on the set lists now... King Nothing and Unforgiven II have made regular appearances.  Other than Fuel, this is honestly the first time in about 12 years that songs from this era have a seemingly permanent place in the set list, even if it's one song per show.  This shows where their heads are at now, as they continue to write.  There will be a logical extension of the DM song writing style (a la Lords of Summer), but I do think there will be a few songs on the album that are reminiscent of The Black Album and Load."

That sweet fat riff with some solid writing.   However, I also enjoyed Death Magnetic (with the mild dissatisfaction with suicide and redemption, what? It felt like ""stock"" to me!), Beyond Magnetic and Lords of Summer (even though this too had some ""stock"" moments.   All in all my general fee for this next record is that it will be metallicas last, I've posted a few comments on those feelings over at JITF.

I read an article that the lead singer from Nickelback is going in for vocal chord surgery.  A huge part of Metallica for me anyway was Hetfields unique voice. While it definitely got deeper from Kill em All to The Black Album I think he still had that perfect blend of the higher pitched stuff and could hit the lower more visceral notes.   It was the perfect blend. See Creeping Death being performed at Moscow...that, IMO was the best of Hetfields voice.  Just sucks becuase their music now is tighter than its ever been but Hetfields stressed out vocals honestly kind of ruin the experience for me.."

Metallica,3aq6gq,drenahmeti22,22,Mon Jun 22 16:42:19 2015 UTC,"Ok. Just heard about this and had to go take a listen. I haven't heard them through headphones yet, as my girlfriend has borrowed them and is using them as we speak. I should let you know this is based purely on default laptop speakers. I've been in the audio production world for 10 years, so I know my way around things like this. Listened to all the main studio albums, and S&M, Live Shit, Garage Inc.  So here we go. I'll go album by album:  Kill 'Em All: The definitive version to me. This is what it should have sounded like. Everything is there and clear. Present is the running concept that seems to go through out the Metalica MiTs, is the guitar sound has been dialed back some. Feels very crisp, and and less busy.   Ride The Lightning: Sounds great. Drums have been brought up in the mix more, and the cymbals brightened. James' voice seems higher in the mix to my ears compared to prior Blackened label releases and Electra discs.   Master of Puppets: Great. Bass is more audible in the songs where Cliff isn't really the showcase. Drums have been perked up. Clearer mix. Very clean  Justice: One of the 3 biggest surprises here. Cannot say with any certainty that the bass is any clearer (Need my headphones to judge), but its sounds amazing. Sounds like there's life breathed into the music. It's not just flat sounding anymore. Guitars and drums still dominate the mix, but nowhere near as bad as it was. So far, aside from Death Magnetic, the biggest improvement overall.   Black: Didn't really need the MiT IMO, but there is some noticeable difference. Guitar sound is quieter in volume, and drums are more upfront.   Load: Kinda muddled. Guitar sound lowered alot. Vocals also seem EQd bass heavy. The effects they used on them stand out more. Backing vocals louder.   Reload: Improved in a small leap. Drums are clearer and vocals sit better.  Garage Inc: This one seems to have the greatest comparison difference. Everything sound fresh and new, even the older tunes on the second disc. The first disc sounds just as good as it did, so not a real difference.   S&M: Sounds great, but the orchestra seems lower in the mix than before.   St. Anger: Little improvement. One of the audio channels doesn't sound right (Muffled sounding). Tin can snare less distracting.  Vocal effects more prominent.   Death Magnetic: Rejoice everyone. We now have an almost completely clean Death Magnetic. Guitars are down slightly, but the bass is up and vocal effects and backing vocals are more prominent. Definitive version here. Moderus can rest easy.  Beyond Magnetic: Sounds wonderful actually mixed and mastered, as the previous versions were much like Lords of Summer (First pass). Just demos that were thrown on CD and given just a basic treatment  Lords Of Summer: Surprisingly, this was ALSO MiT. Didn't expect that, and sounds awesome. Sounds like a completed song now, and sounds much better than before.   Live Shit: Didn't notice alot of difference other than the presence of more bass, and some vocal EQing. Still sounds great, but didn't need it like San Diego and Seattle needed it."

That's usually to change tunings or because they play hard enough that the tunings start to give out and they have roadies that have pretuned guitars on the side.  For recordings it's usually because they like the different sounds that different guitars make.
Metallica,3affk6,earthwormjim91,0,Fri Jun 19 18:46:04 2015 UTC,So the look of a guitar can make different sounds?
Metallica,3affk6,earthwormjim91,8,Sat Jun 20 03:14:35 2015 UTC,"Not so much the look. But different shapes do have different acoustic properties because of how vibrations resonate through the body.   It's also very likely that they have different hardware. Things like a tremolo or whammy bar, different pickups, different strings, etc."
Metallica,3affk6,GRuntK1n6,7,Sat Jun 20 03:20:47 2015 UTC,"When theyre playing live they switch guitars for the tuning. For example most of their songs are in E  standard Tuning, however, if they are playing Sad But True, which is D standard, they would have to retune their guitars. Rather than standing up on stage trying to tune their guitars, an easier way would just be to switch out the guitar for one that is already in D standard"
Metallica,3affk6,Shaun_Guitarist,11,Fri Jun 19 18:41:50 2015 UTC,"Actually when they play live most of the songs are in Eb (half step down) but they play so damn hard that the strings get worn out and out of tune so they switch. But for songs like sad but true and all nightmare long, they do change for tuning purposes"
Metallica,3affk6,GRuntK1n6,6,Fri Jun 19 18:48:27 2015 UTC,ah yes i forgot they played in Eb tuning thanks for the correction
Metallica,3affk6,shaggy756,-4,Fri Jun 19 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"Sad is in Drop D, not D standard  Edit: I'm wrong RIP"
Metallica,3affk6,Squidward-Tentpoles,12,Fri Jun 19 19:12:23 2015 UTC,Actually I believe it is in D standard.
Metallica,3affk6,decytv,2,Fri Jun 19 19:53:51 2015 UTC,"they typically do it in d standard, you are correct, though it's also been done in eb"
Metallica,3affk6,Hammiams,5,Fri Jun 19 21:37:20 2015 UTC,"Sad But True is a full step down, you're probably thinking of All Nightmare Long which is Drop D."

Metallica,3affk6,guywoodman7,8,Fri Jun 19 21:20:13 2015 UTC,"As stated in other posts, when it comes to playing live it's all about tuning and the preferred feel of certain guitars for certain songs...again mostly preference.   When it comes to the studio though it's a whole other beast. Think of it like painting a wall. First you sand it, then you prime it, then you put up a coat of that awesome metallic paint, then you put up a second coat...maybe even a third.  In the end, the additional layers of paint add a more solid look to the wall.   Same applies for sound. When you mix different sounds you get a ""fuller"" sounds at is very popular for but music like met.  Also, often you are not only hearing multiple guitars, but multiple microphones placed on the same guitar amp. One mic may be right up against the amps's speaker capturing the most raw sound that guitar and amp are putting out and another mic may be 5 or 10 feet away, capturing more of the actual ambient sound of the room that the amp is in.   That brings us to textures of rooms. Put an amp in a tiled room? You get a natural reverb due to sound bouncing off the hard tiles surface. Put that amp in a room full of soft dampening material, like pillows and blankets, and you get a very sharp and abrupt sound with no sustain at all.   When all is said and done, the mixture of guitar sounds, amps, rooms, and microphone placement (also microphone choice as there are many different types of microphones that have different patterns of how they receive input) and you get very subtly different sounds. The standard layman will NOT be able to hear the subtle differences in sound. But audiophiles who understand how sound actually works sonically with all these different variables can.   Sometimes it takes days or weeks for a band in the studio to get the ""right sound"". It's incredibly difficult and tedious at times. And ultimately a musicians sound is their signature, hence the emphasis put on its importance."

Metallica,3affk6,BiGSTaN,3,Sat Jun 20 03:17:26 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it's looks, sometimes it's tuning  James will play Kill em all songs on his V a lot, fade to black and unforgiven are often an acoustic + snakebyte combo, and he usually switches between snakebytes and ESP les Paul clones (unless they're actually les Pauls) for the rest"
Metallica,3affk6,fvalt05,2,Fri Jun 19 22:48:57 2015 UTC,"Usually they change instruments because of tunings, but I've noticed with metallica there's alot of albums with diffrent ""looks"". James had the white v up til the end of puppets, the Explorer from lightning up til load he started to use a bit of everything, like a b bender tele for unforgiven II, then going to the les paul style until he released the snakebyte. Kirk just has an array of custom ESPs that not using them would be insane, the black, white, and natreal ouija board, the mummy, the Frankenstein, ""kirk's guitar"", the original skully, he only uses the Jackson Rhoads V for whole step down tunings. The list goes on, my guess would be that ESP and Gibson will practically throw these amazing $4000 guitars to these guys just because we as fans see them all the time."
Metallica,3affk6,awesomemgy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:44:44 2015 UTC,"Also when they started, they were broke so they had to use probably 1 or 2 guitars live and those same ones on the records.  Once the big time came, you saw how many different guitars Kirk purchased (lol).   Plus when they first started, they just played in standard tuning 99% of the time. (The Thing That Should Not Be is the only song not in standard) So a couple guitars would be fine. Now with James older, they have to tune down whole/half steps so it necessitates more guitars."

That it's about someone who went through pain and suffering finding someone who was similar.   In the second verse the lines ""She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again"" means he kills her because he's unsure if she'll still love him after seeing his demons.

""I take this key  And I bury it in you Because you're unforgiven, too..."" means only she had to key to his demons and no one else can see them."

I like long songs, but not if they have to be forced. I'll accept a natural 5 minute song over a forced 7 minute song. I want epic guitar solos. I want an instrumental, and it better be good.  The thing is, a lot of spots on the last album sounded forced and lacking any real passion. Combine that with the fact that they're obviously in no rush to make this next album, it doesn't sound like the music's going to have any real urgency, or if it does, it won't feel natural. I want the next album to feel natural, like it's the album they wanted to make, not the album they feel like they were supposed to make. I love Metallica, but I'd rather they never make an album again than make a half-assed one their hearts aren't in."

The Black Album had guitar tones that killed. That wall of sound was a force to be reckoned with at the time. Kirk's lead work on Justice was his best in my opinion. Plus, while I like wah on a solo, it shouldn't be on  EVERY solo. (groan) Everybody beats up the Load and Reload days, but I agree with r\JHallComics about listening after all these years and hearing new things every time you listen. And James can actually sing. While his growl is awesome, the soul he brings is equally powerful. And finally, while the production sucked, Lars' drumming on DM was the best of AJFA and The Black Album combined...awesome machine gun double bass but not overly complicated like some of AJFA.

I love everything they have done so far with the exception of letting Ja Rule get his hands on some Presidio material.  They can keep doing what they are doing as long as they leave the shittiest of rappers out of it.
Metallica,39q5rp,serosis,2,Mon Jun 15 04:20:54 2015 UTC,"I've accepted Hetfield lost the voice that we all know and love. It sucks, but I've come to terms with it.  What I don't accept is his style of singing. After Black, he started singing in a more country way. It had a southern drawl that never really went away. Even in DM you can still hear it.  I miss when he just sang in a more straight-forward and aggressive manner. To me, it just sounded more raw. There was no hint of any southern drawl in anything until Load and beyond. Kind of sucks. Maybe it's easier for him to sing that way? Maybe he likes it? If that's the case, by all means stick to it. I'm just 1 fan putting in my 2 cents but even then I still stand back that the artist should do what THEY want no matter what.  What's that saying? When you try to please everyone you please noone? Or something like that."

Metallica,39krma,cdrewsr388,20,Fri Jun 12 12:27:19 2015 UTC,"Justice was a step in a heavier and darker direction and is my personal favourite of all Metallica albums. I see where you are coming from in saying its not exactly thrash although there are some very fast songs on that album such as Dyers Eve and Blackened. MoP is hands down a masterpiece but like you said, not as thrashy as KEA or RtL. That being said Battery, Master of Puppets, and Damage inc are also very fast yet technical songs.   I'm no expert on what is considered thrash metal but both of these albums still, in my opinion, retain the the elements of a thrash album."
Metallica,39krma,soslog,5,Fri Jun 12 13:13:17 2015 UTC,I call AJFA Prog Thrash. And Master of Puppets kinda bridges the gap between KEA/RTL and AJFA

Metallica,39krma,aprilfool01,8,Fri Jun 12 20:29:56 2015 UTC,"MOP is definitely thrash.. there are a lot of riffs with the triplet patterns and most of the songs have a lot of chugging the E. Battery, Disposable heroes and damage inc are perfect examples of thrash. Justice on the other hand.. That to me is not thrashy. I dont really know how to describe that album."
Metallica,39krma,theshitlord00,5,Fri Jun 12 13:13:48 2015 UTC,Prog thrash to add to the endless list of metal subgenres.

Metallica,39krma,MIK_the_prick,-2,Fri Jun 12 22:42:16 2015 UTC,OK other than those songs the album is fairly slow.
Metallica,39krma,theshitlord00,3,Fri Jun 12 13:21:46 2015 UTC,"lets do the math.. Battery, MOP, Disposable Heroes, Lepper Messiah has some thrashy parts, and damage inc.... I dont know man, 5/8 songs"
Metallica,39krma,decytv,-1,Fri Jun 12 13:32:46 2015 UTC,Yes...thrash parts.  I would say half of those songs are also slower and more melodic.  Not a bad thing.
Metallica,39krma,decytv,6,Fri Jun 12 13:40:21 2015 UTC,I think the definition of thrash has changed over the years; Metallica was once thrash metal but now they're really more just metal as thrash has gotten much more hard
Metallica,39krma,tombstone23,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:25:46 2015 UTC,"I think it is still the same, just not as raw.  Endgame was pure thrash but much more technical than any early Deth albums.  Death Magnetic had some good thrash on it, just not the same as the early days.  Hell, even Anthrax with Worship Music went back to the early days, just more produced sound.  Slayer...well they always sound the same (except the Nu Metal 2000s...)."

Metallica,39krma,Cfx99,-5,Fri Jun 12 15:00:12 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  As far as a total cohesive album goes, nothing beats Rust in Peace.  Each song is on point, does not linger too long, and has amazing technical guitar and drumming.  On a LOT of Metallica songs, the rhythm parts repeat so many damn times.  Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning are good examples, where it gets a little repetitive.  This is not present on Kill em All...  Suspect being Dave wrote 4 of the songs and had input on all of them.  Megadeth is never repetitive.  Just listen to Mary Jane or Holy Wars, shit changes so fast.  I agree with you that Metallica shed their thrash roots after Ride the Lightning."

Metallica,39hv4w,IPainTrain,8,Thu Jun 11 20:39:36 2015 UTC,"IMO, the four shows at Fillmore were the best of last years. Great setlists, guests, new songs and unplayed live songs. Rock am ring 2012 with full black album (Great performance of James' vocals there + killer setlist), DEEHAN show (2013 Orion festival)."
Metallica,39hv4w,Golovkin8,3,Thu Jun 11 21:15:40 2015 UTC,I've heard mixed reviews on the Fillmore shows. I'll have to give them a listen before I make conclusions. I can see why you put them up there (unplayed songs/good setlists) though.  The My Friend of Misery performance gives me chills every time I watch it (from Rock am Ring 2012).
Metallica,39hv4w,buefordwilson,3,Thu Jun 11 21:56:38 2015 UTC,"The big thing for me in terms of the Fillmore shows was the guest musicians. Jason and Dave were a couple of my favorites, but it was all put together pretty well."

Metallica,39hv4w,Deadman76,2,Thu Jun 11 21:17:35 2015 UTC,Wembley and the O2 were both great gigs. Add the Master Of Puppets anniversary gigs (saw Arnhem and Download) to the lists for me
Metallica,39hv4w,Crashiee,4,Fri Jun 12 01:26:57 2015 UTC,"""Orgullo, Pasión Y Gloria"" is a pretty great show. The setlist and crowd was amazing and I'm really impressed with Disposable Heroes. James is killing it.  ""Quebec Magnetic"" is also notable. Tracks like The Four Horsemen, Breadfan and Phantom Lord was played but I think the highlight was The Judas Kiss. Can't believe they don't play this more often. It kicks ass!   ""30 years at the Fillmore"" is very unique. Carpe Diem Baby, Rebel of Babylon, Dirty Windows, Hate Train, Mercyful Fate, To Live Is To Die, Just a Bullet Away and so on. Tracks you'll never hear live was played."
Metallica,39hv4w,TristanCorb,2,Thu Jun 11 21:18:46 2015 UTC,"I got the Quebec DVD for Christmas the year it came out, a solid concert there too.

Kerry: There's a damn good reason. It isn't too long an explanation. [MEGADETH's Dave] Mustaine came to me that day and [METALLICA's] James [Hetfield] came to me that day saying, ""Hey, it would be really cool if you played."" I knew Jeff [Hanneman, SLAYER guitarist] wouldn't do it, and I knew Tom [Araya, SLAYER bassist/vocalist] wouldn't do it. And I also knew after we played that neither one of them would edit our video that was going to cinemas in a couple hours, so I told James and Mustaine both, ""Listen, man. I've gotta edit our video before I can even think about playing with you guys."" So the entire time of the set change between SLAYER and METALLICA, I was editing that video. I came running to the tuning room after I got done picking the songs, and they were already onstage. And to make it an even better story, I found out at 1 a.m. the night prior, so I really had no chance to work on that stuff or anything. So I wanted to; it just couldn't happen. I've got a lot of flack for that but yeah, that's the story."""
Metallica,39hv4w,keitarno,2,Fri Jun 12 02:25:35 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Although I would have thought they'd have people to edit the video for them.

Metallica,39hv4w,Matthew94,2,Fri Jun 12 02:30:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seems like the other dudes kinda dropped the ball on him there.  People always talk trash about him, and how slayer is dead without Jeff and Dave, but honestly, without Kerry, slayer wouldn't be. He is so passionate about it, it is his life, I think he'd be lost without it, Tom has kids and stuff to keep him occupied, but Kerry IS the  embodiment of slayer.  I have mad respect for the man."

Metallica,39hv4w,theoxfordtailor,3,Fri Jun 12 09:07:32 2015 UTC,"And I think its a fair assessment to make that the period of '89-'93 and then a brief stint from '98-'00 could be considered their prime years.   Ahem 1986 would like to have a word with you. Otherwise I'd have to agree with the obvious choices like Français pour une nuit , Orgullo, Pasión, y Gloria and Through The Never just because of their great production quality."

Metallica,39ev63,AceBobcat,30,Thu Jun 11 06:50:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with your premise.    The biggest misconception people have of TBA is that it was an intentional move to sell out. No. It was an intentional move to do something different from AJFA.  Tell me, how the fuck do you try and top AJFA in terms of progressiveness, speed, complexity, length and geo/political social message? You can't is the answer. I mean Kirk and Lars were so coked out by the end of that tour they didn't know what city they were in. It happens when you are asked to go that hard every night and play that kind of intricate music.  Instead of burning out and becoming a parody of themselves, they went the only direction they possibly could have. Simple, melodic and straight forward.  You have to understand they made that album from October of 1990 to June of 1991.  They were still a cult following band, all be it, the most popular American heavy metal band. But heavy metal was not that popular, hair/pop metal had just reached its peak at the end of the 80's.  When TBA came out in August of 1991, there had never been anything like it that was so powerful, yet accessible in terms of the casual music fan.  Metallica didn't go mainstream, the mainstream came to them. Instead of embracing the fact that true heavy metal shot to the top of the charts in America, too many ""metal purists"" turned their back on the band.  It's like fucking around in your basement painting and having a local cult following of your art, then putting out more stuff and gaining acceptance in that particular genre of expression, and then one day after spending 9 months working on a piece that you really enjoy...BOOM.  The next thing you know every art collector in the world is calling you because they want to buy your painting and it's going on auction at Sothybe's to the highest bidder.  What the fuck are you supposed to do?  Apologize that your project that you really like and put a lot of time and effort into, is also liked by tons of other people? Nah, fuck that shit. You embrace it and take pride in it.  One more time, Metallica didn't go mainstream, the mainstream came to them and they didn't apologize for it. If they were true sell outs they would have tried to recreate TBA 7 times over. Instead, they continued doing their own thing, on their own terms, and once again became shunned and ignored.

Metallica,39ev63,Metallicarox,3,Thu Jun 11 11:27:35 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. /u/I_of_Whoreus has a good point (love that username too!). But I think it's also true that Metallica quit challenging themselves around that time as well in favor of experimenting with new stuff. They've said as much and I happen to be glad they did because I really enjoy a lot of what they made during this time. The real question is whether you consider quitting the thrash metal arms race to experiment with other sounds ""selling out."" I don't think it is but that doesn't mean the critics of this move are hipsters either. When Metallica quit pushing the boundaries, their music did suffer ""in terms of progressiveness, speed, complexity, length and geo/political social message."" We gained something else of value too and I'm happy we did but I don't think it's fair to boil down the other side of that spectrum to hipsterism."
Metallica,39ev63,weirdmountain,7,Wed Jun 17 23:01:54 2015 UTC,"Bands can't win. They keep their sound mostly similar (AC/DC) or change it (Metallica, Anthrax, etc.). Either way they are bound to piss off fans."

Metallica,39ev63,itacoop,7,Wed Jun 24 03:13:27 2015 UTC,"The Black Album was a reaction against the troubles they had with AJFA. Namely, they couldn't properly play the songs in a live venue. They needed a drum machine on the album to properly time the rhythm changes. The crew enjoyed the simplicity of the cover tunes they did on Garage Days Re-Revisted and decided to see if they could capture that spirit in their own songs. Flemming Rasmussen, the producer from RTL to AJFA was the one pushing the complexity boundaries so that's probably why they shopped around and found Bob Rock. And finally, the loss of the Metal Album grammy to Jethro Tull was probably the final straw that drove them to aim for a more commercial producer who could get their work recognized. An unfortunate series of events I'd say but the resultant album was pretty damned good all things considered. It wasn't until Load that the true scope of this change was on display and once it dawns on you it colors your perception of The Black Album in retrospect. Still, you can clearly hear Bob Rock's signatures in The Black Album so can you really call it a ""Metallica"" album unless you consider Bob Rock to be a member of the group. True, you could say the same of Flemming but it's quite clear that everything he did was an extension of what either Cliff Burton or Jason Newstead were aiming for since both those guys wanted more complex arrangements. Bob basically told Metallica how to change their sound to match his vision of a commercially successful Metallica. You could say, Metallica wanted to make that change so they listened and that act of listening to an outside influence doesn't invalidate them as creators... but no, almost anyone who's into any band will be disappointed when that band decides to let someone else drive. Metallica weren't the only ones guilty of changes like this around this time. Remember when Anthrax went Grunge? Even Slayer had a NuMetal album so all 4 of the ""big 4"" sold-out at one time or another. This was due to a stupid polarization of the industry around that time. Folks were getting fed-up with ""hair metal"" bands like Nelson so they tried to rebrand Guns N' Roses as ""heavy metal"" by pairing them with Metallica and at the same time tried to market Metallica as mainstream hard rock. Then the Grunge scene hit the market and was the antidote to all those Nelson\Winger etc bands but because Metallica was hanging out with GnR and Bob Rock they got pegged as part of the ""corporate rock"" scene, which is pretty strange if you think about it. Alice in Chains were far more metal than GnR and even Nirvana choose their producer because he worked on a Slayer album. Basically, if Metallica had stuck with their old sound through the Grunge era they would've been a closer match to what the mainstream changed to taste wise but they switched before that happened because they got a big smack to the face during the AJFA album. They busted their assess making a hugely complex album and trying to tour with it and were rewarded with lukewarm sales and a grammy snub."

Metallica is the only metal band to come out of the 80's that evolved. Load and Reload are two of the best albums of the 90's but don't get credit because people wanted Metallica to keep playing the same 80's sounding stuff.

Metallica,39ev63,MartinusXIV,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:10:49 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with any band that changes their sound is the reason why they did it.I really like the fact that many bands overly change their sound, but I like subtle nuances too. AJFA was..and is to me..a barrage of riffing that not many peple felt to be enjoyable. Of course Metallica had to change their plan and work on it. While I think a complete change (looks etc.) was not really necessary, they felt it was and only they truly know why.  What I am trying to say, is that I don't care if its sell-out or not, less I can understand who stop liking a band just for that reason. I embrace changes, weiher big or small and I think doing the same thing over and over, gets boring after a while. So I'd rather have Metallica step out of the box and do something different."

Metallica,39ev63,cdrewsr388,-1,Sun Jun 28 21:10:41 2015 UTC,"You're talking about the load era, not the black album era. Black was a shift but it wasnt selling out. It was when they were trying to chase the succes the black album brought that things went off course.     Watch a concert from say 97 compared to the black tour or before. They got a real chip on their shoulder and started acting like rockstars who smell their own farts. I love Metallica, top 2 or 3 favorite bands ever, but just look at their interviews or shows in 97. You can see hetfield on the black tour making fun of axl for his list of wants n demands backstage, then on the load tour hetfield explains how he now makes his assistant bring him a catbox of dirt before every show.    There's evolution which I'm all for, which they achieved perfectly between kill em all and justice, which is the fanboys excuse for the shift in behavior, sound, and image, and then there's change, which is what really happened. Metallica didn't evolve or grow any more, they just up and changed, trying to appeal to more mainstream audiences, trying to chase that success they got from the black album. The bottom line is they stopped doing natural things and started going for controversy to grab headlines. Load wasn't exactly chasing the mainstream musically, musically it was a slight gamble, but still very safe radio/construction site rock. They took the Madonna route of reinventing themselves image and attitude wise to stay hip more than they worried about chasing trends musically, which we all could debate as to whether which was the lesser or two evils...    I love black, but it was a real shift in sound coming from puppets and justice. Still it was natural. Load on the other hand, at least in the way they handled themselves, what tours they'd take, their image, etc... was not. They've never been a great or dynamic rock band, and when they started trying to be, and saying they weren't metal and calling themselves 'tallica, and wearing wife beaters and eyeliner, and cut their hair as a PR stunt, their motives were really transparent to anyone who wasn't blinded by how good they were in the past. The stage banter went from James just talking to the crowd being in the moment to a rehearsed script where he'd say arena rock cliches before certain songs each show of the tour, with no deviation from the script until about 3/4s through the show. ""'tallica gives you heavy baby"". Ugh watching load tour vids and there's so much ""baby""... The success of the black album spoiled them and they sold their souls trying to chase that success in the years after.     If I had more time or thought anyone actually cared, I'd go on, and produce video examples from YouTube to back up these points. Metallica aren't just sellouts, they're the biggest sellouts in the history of metal/rock, maybe even the biggest sellouts in music history. BUT, they're Metallica, they'll do what they want, good or bad, and they don't care what anyone thinks because they'll play sold out stadiums anywhere they go on any day."
Metallica,39ev63,serosis,0,Thu Jun 11 15:17:49 2015 UTC,This was great.  Please continue.  Personally I think Kill em All was their only thrash metal album.  Kicking out Dave was the first step in them going mainstream.

I went through a few like Phantom Lord and Battery but then chose fight fire with fire, thinking hmm he won't follow through with it.

If it is a 2 hour film, 1st half hour will be their rise, alcoholica, Cliff dying, and Jason stepping in.   The next 45 min will be about Napster (which should be a footnote at best).   Then 15 min will be about substance abuse problems, turmoil, and Jason leaving.   The remaining 30 min will be the uncertain future, Rob coming onboard, and the band carrying on into the sunset.  I can't see Hollywood doing their story justice. It will cheesy and end up like Jem and the Halograms."

Metallica,392pj6,weirdmountain,-2,Wed Jun 10 20:47:34 2015 UTC,"I'd be hella against it.  I feel like movies like that are for when the younger generation needs to be shown/told why an artist is still relevant because the music alone doesn't do enough justice.     That's why they made big movies of The Doors, Ray Charles, Johnny Cash, and NWA - who didn't make necessarily bad music, but mystifying their stories really helps to prop their music up - but they haven't had to make them about The Beatles, Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix, or Led Zeppelin.     Metallica's music is strong enough to stand on its own legs, and doesn't need actors pretending to be them to prove that they are (or by the time a movie might be made, were) important.    There's nothing a biographical movie can tell you about Metallica that you won't get from listening to the albums and/or watching any of the documentaries or concert films they've already released."

Only song that I wasn't sure about was Attitude, there were about 5 songs that could've gone there, I think I like Attitude marginally more than the rest. The others I'm pretty sure on. One thing I noticed is that I picked barely any faster songs, Attitude is the only song that I'd call upbeat, maybe 2x4 and Until It Sleeps. I also decided to put The Outlaw Torn as the opener, I think it sets the mood for the album, it's dark, slow, and mixes soft and heavy, like most of the songs I picked. Anyway, I think a long opening song would suit a Metallica album."

Metallica,38sx2l,notesonthebrain,3,Sat Jun 6 15:19:58 2015 UTC,"This could definitely produce more variety. But what I think what would have made it better is if they had like 2-3 slots for songs left entire up to the voters. And they would then go down the list of votes, if they already have the song in their setlist - they keep going through the votes till a song not on their setlist comes up."
Metallica,38sx2l,legendary_skulls,3,Sun Jun 7 06:58:25 2015 UTC,"The By Request tour would have been dramatically better as a midsize venue,  club member only tour.  In terms of the difference in setlists with that proposed scenario vs. what we saw last year, the fan club sets would have had more of the better songs from the Load era, and a bunch of Garage Inc songs.    I think the band themselves think the ByRequest tour was a dud, because the setlists they ended up playing were exactly the same as what they've been doing for about 10 years."

Metallica,38sx2l,G-42,11,Sat Jun 6 15:44:27 2015 UTC,"I think what he's saying is that at these ""By Request"" shows, the overplayed staples like Sandman, Matters, and Seek were the most requested songs by fans, making the whole concept pretty much futile. You were getting basically the same Metallica show under the guise of the fans having made a choice.  What makes sense to me is mixing the set up. The fans would get to vote on 50% of the tunes which would exclude the fan favourites, because the band would play them anyway. Something like this:   Creeping Death (set staple) Prince Charming (voted by fans) Master of Puppets (set staple) Some Kind of Monster (voted by fans)   Etc... This would be a sweet way to hear some rare tunes that aren't often given a live treatment."
Metallica,38sx2l,followedbysnow,5,Sat Jun 6 16:03:10 2015 UTC,"The main problem with the By Request tour was that it has the potential to have really rare songs played. While this happened a bit, most of the setlists had the same songs (great songs for sure, but far from uncommon)"

Metallica,38qx5b,keitarno,3,Sat Jun 6 02:26:18 2015 UTC,I went to a Protest the Hero concert a month or so back and had my phone on me. I felt it was better to just not record. Phones get crappy audio most of the time when you are really up close to the band anyway. I managed to record a minute and a half of a song and that was good enough for me to relive later. I just spent the rest of the night going crazy

Metallica,38q4ct,Strider_,9,Fri Jun 5 21:53:02 2015 UTC,They already said remasters are coming. The tape for record store day was just the start.   The tape will be released in a broader sense sometime late summer (tape/cd/iTunes/vinyl/collectors edition)   With the other releases to follow.   They are digging DEEP into the vaults to pull out loads of supplement material for each album.   It's happening.   It's official.

Metallica,38q4ct,yodawg111,3,Fri Jun 5 22:43:05 2015 UTC,Remastering AJFA would basically be James and Lars admitting what happened with the bass.
Metallica,38q4ct,binarysmurf,2,Sat Jun 6 01:35:27 2015 UTC,James has commented many times that the bass on AJFA was mixed down in production on purpose. Once that leaps to mind is on the 'Classic Albums' Episode about TBA.
Metallica,38q4ct,L33-the-3rd,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:43:54 2015 UTC,"I concur.  Each album has a signature sound, which couldn't be recreated unless it sounded exactly the same. A better sounding MOP wouldn't be MOP.  They went to great lengths to give the black album it's quality - partly, imo, because they didn't want that 'perfect' sound, which I think contributed to its success.  Load / Reload, had that perfect studio quality, but lacked something all their other albums had. This is the reason I think they went for the weird snare and more crunchy guitars in SA, and maybe to some extent the crushed sound of DM. (apparently the sound engineer who mastered DM confirmed that the recordings he was sent were already super compressed, indicating that Metallica wanted that particular sound).  Obviously there's the issue of James voice - could he actually pull it off?  I've wanted them to do rerecording for years, but I don't think the end product would be as good as the thought of it. Maybe a 'best of' album, made up of new recordings could work tho. Maybe even a slight reworking of each song?"
Metallica,38q4ct,Metallicarox,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:36:33 2015 UTC,"I kind of wonder what a remastered St. Anger would sound like, but I also know it would probably most likely sound really different from the original."

Metallica,38q32a,Strider_,4,Fri Jun 5 21:43:05 2015 UTC,I love Metallica but i don't think they are the type of band that really changes it up all that much from show to show. Sure the setlist changes all the time but the songs themselves don't really leave room for any kind of unique jamming or whatever. So in my mind this is overkill.

Kirk can't play. James can't sing.  Those are bizarre opinions about a band that put together an impressive catalogue and that still headlines just about any major festival."
Metallica,38ruwg,smulverine,6,Sat Jun 6 07:40:48 2015 UTC,"Kirks solos on Lightning were plain and simple perfect. Fade to Black to me has the 2 greatest solos ever written. Ride the lightning perfectly mixes melody with shreddyness. A lot of his stuff on Puppets is also amazing, although to me not on the same level.   Lars wasn't all that special to me on most albums, he was just a really good, solid player until Anger. However, his drumming on Justice is some of the best I've heard."

Metallica,38ruwg,stinkadickbig,6,Sun Jun 7 07:08:30 2015 UTC,"Kirk, skillwise, was best from around 1986-1991  Musically, his solos were great from 1984-1997, and his DM solos are pretty ""Justice-y"" I might add  Lars was best from 1981-2003, with 1989 being his peak  I say 2003, because there's some hard as shit drumming on St. Anger"
Metallica,38ruwg,thetaimi,3,Sat Jun 6 12:30:06 2015 UTC,"True, the St. Anger drumming wasn't half-bad. Listen to Frantic, and try to ignore the snare sound if you don't like it, it's pretty damn great."

Metallica,38ruwg,PopPop-Magnitude,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:48:07 2015 UTC,"Lars was a good drummer and Kirk was a damn good guitarist. Theyre both pretty damn good now but obviously worse due to ageing. Im not a drummer but I love Lars' patterns. I am a guitarist and I do understand kirk's shit is simple and fast, but he has accomplished something few others have. He has a sound that you know is him from fearing about 3 seconds of any clip he solo's in. He was also pretty creative with his licks in the 80s. Refer to the 89 seattle solo to see him skipping strings, doing some interesting scales."

In it is a meet and greet and I have to say it's a bit cringeworthy to watch.  Afterward, he mentions meeting fans like that is a bit full on  Here it is linked to the relevant part https://youtu.be/yf-rfClPFwA?t=800  I'd say that if I was doing that for years and kept hearing that everywhere I went it would either go to my head or I'd have to step back to keep things real. James has always been the big metal riffmaster frontman so I'd say he would attract these types of comments more than the other guys.  My guess is that while this might be a bit over the top, hearing it makes him uncomfortable. It would make me uncomfortable. I'd be surprised if fans never have a chance to meet him but I'd say opting out of the meet and greet is his way of avoiding these types of situations."
Metallica,38jejv,keitarno,6,Thu Jun 4 22:14:03 2015 UTC,nice find. i think this is what it comes down to. meet and greets are just awkward for him. i've seen a bunch of his meet and greets prior to 2013 and it looks like he doesn't feel comfortable at all. example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnWoKjSnNpo

It was a great experience and all the guys lived up to what you would expect of them. I feel very lucky especially because James stopped not long after.

Metallica,38h2qq,BaldEagle88,3,Thu Jun 4 04:04:38 2015 UTC,Totally agree. Such a good song too. Great representation of pure Metallica riffage. They're at their best in 10 years.

I was actually kinda embarrassed.  They're still capable and awesome when they make it work.   When playing any of the faster songs from Puppets and Ride (this, battery, fight fire with fire, disposable) they really need to focus on staying in time.  This means Lars has to remain steady and not overblow the fills.  When they do that, they still pull these thrashers off live... and pretty well at that."

Metallica,38hagu,grimmless,10,Thu Jun 4 07:43:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about Het's voice, it will be what it will be and James will adjust to any changes just fine. What concerns me is the amount of time it takes them to write and record albums now. TIME is the one thing that is in limited quantity and there seems to be no one who realizes it or cares on the management side, or they would take a break from touring and get this next album done. In olden days, the band would tour and write songs while on the road...that doesn't happen anymore. So, the only time in which songs get worked on (they possibly practice new licks in the sound room before they go onstage, but I haven't seen it) is in the studio.  At the rate they're going, I just don't see them making a another album after this Duke Nukem Forever album that they are supposed to be working on, but they only have one song completed. It's been 7 years since Death Magnetic was released. I just don't think that writing new songs is what motivates them anymore (and that's fine, I'm sure it's difficult to write angsty music when your life is no longer filled with angst).  The good news is that I think they have another decade of touring in them before they call it a career."
Metallica,38hagu,dpprace,2,Thu Jun 4 13:47:42 2015 UTC,Duke Nukem forever album they are supposed to be working on    Upvote. best line I've heard on /r/Metallica in a long time.

Metallica,38hagu,yodawg111,6,Sat Jun 6 01:40:13 2015 UTC,"I can honestly see two more albums in the next five years, and then they call it quits after ten  Kirk and Rob will surf for the rest of their retirement, Lars will retreat to his piles of money, and James will probably do some solo gigs like the Acoustic4ACure  As long as James doesn't push it, his voice could probably stay pretty consistent (I mean, it's better now than it was 10 years ago). He probably won't be able to do ""second half of battery"" type performances for longer then 7-8, however."

There's just a point where there's nothing left to prove or accomplish, other than making one final classic, which almost never happens and is almost never expected to happen."

I sing in a band.   I curse in some of my songs.   But, 30+ years in, if James wants to not add curses into his songs (or sing curse-driven songs, like ""So What?"") because he wouldn't want his kids to hear him talking/singing like that, I can dig that."

Metallica,38ekj6,ahamm95,0,Thu Jun 4 12:29:16 2015 UTC,"As much as his kids might have been behind his reduction in swearing, I think it's just something you drop as you get older. I used to be pretty foul mouthed when I was younger, and even though I don't have any children now, I swear much less than I used to.   There's swearing to punctuate a lyrical point, and then there's swearing like the way he does on the Live Shit performances. It got pretty juvenile after a while."

Metallica,38c3bp,DiscoWolf,8,Thu Jun 4 05:14:50 2015 UTC,"James for sure.  It would not be Metallica with another singer.  Even if they did continue, I would not consider it Metallica anymore.  I can't see James wanting Metallica to continue without Lars.  It's possible they would continue without Kirk.  It's probable they would continue without Rob."
Metallica,38c3bp,Wilkmazing,21,Wed Jun 3 13:18:27 2015 UTC,"I think the two right answers are: James and Lars.   Short disclaimer before I continue: I am biased, and these are my opinions.  If Kirk died, it would take a big bite out of the band--but, ultimately, he is replaceable. Why? He's the quiet lead guitarist. I love Kirk to death but I think it's fair to admit that he isn't the best at what he does, and he isn't what I like to call a band's ""representative."" (I'll get to that later) What I mean is, when people think METALLLICA, Kirk is seldom the first member to come to mind.   Rob hasn't been in the band long enough to be considered a staple, or defining pillar in the band's public image, able to break the band up with his death; although, again, like Kirk Hammett, it would take a long break and a long search to replace him.  James and Lars, are definitely PILLARS of Metallica. Lars, no matter the flak he receives for being a non-spectacular drummer, is one of the two original members of the band still doing it today and by far the most outspoken of the band. It's almost like Lars has always been the band's representative.   Do I really have to type out why a loss of James would destroy the band? Simply put, the band would lose one of the greatest, if not the greatest, frontmen in hard rock history. He is one of the best writers of riffs and lyrics. No one can replace James Hetfield.  But if I had to pick only one, that'd be James.  Honestly, I think that with the band's age + the fact that they have had to replace so many members in the past, another death in the band, no matter who the member, would end Metallica."

Metallica,38c3bp,BrockYXE,6,Wed Jun 3 08:08:46 2015 UTC,James is irreplaceable.

Metallica,38c3bp,plymouthpower,2,Thu Jun 4 05:12:44 2015 UTC,"I think they might keep going if Rob died, definitely if he quit. Like Bob Rock said in Some Kind of Monster, everyone after Cliff may be temporary, and if Rob lasts till the end, it's because A: he's very humble, B: the rest of the band is more mature, C: They probably don't have more than 10-20 years left.  Edit: if Rob died, I think we'd be down to 5 years or less."
Metallica,38c3bp,crewdoughty,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:03:52 2015 UTC,"If Rob left/died, they'd probably finish what ever new material they have and then tour one last time (probably with Jason)."
Metallica,38c3bp,wewontstaydead,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:23:15 2015 UTC,I wouldn't see Jason coming back. He doesn't seem to want anything to do with the spotlight anymore.
Metallica,38c3bp,Hetstaine,2,Sun Jun 7 01:26:26 2015 UTC,I think it would be James followed by Kirk. James is the most important piece to the lyrical side and currently the most signature sound in the band.
Metallica,38c3bp,theshitlord00,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:19:17 2015 UTC,Any of them. They are in retirement mode right now anyways and they are only doing what they do now because they want to.
Metallica,38c3bp,Matthew94,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:45:20 2015 UTC,"James is pretty much the only one I can see being totally irreplaceable. Kirk and Lars can be replaced with the premise of ""they loved Metallica and would want it to continue."" James is the face and voice of it though and without him it wouldn't resemble Metallica to me.   Losing Rob however might kind of kill any desire they have left for touring or new material."

They talked about their own favorite songs but didn't mention Death Magnetic or St. Anger directly whatsoever.  One of them even liked a tune off Lulu and mentioned ""they like epic songs"". Clearly someone hasn't heard All Nightmare Long.

Metallica,383u0y,yodawg111,8,Thu Jun 4 00:25:40 2015 UTC,Ive seen fight fire with fire 2 times now... it is without a doubt my favourite song live
Metallica,383u0y,talktothehand00,10,Mon Jun 1 20:31:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, OP is right. Metallica routinely rotate through a wide variety of their catalogue.  Therefore, they have been playing the same 150+ songs for 10+ years."
Metallica,383u0y,Rlchv70,9,Mon Jun 1 20:59:32 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, though, they have a good 25-35 songs that they've never played out live though.  Bid love to see them do something like Pearl Jam does, and really mix up the set lists.  Open the sets with unusual songs (like they did here with ""Fuel"", or go really weird, and open a set with ""Sanitarium"", or ""Ain't My Bitch"").   It doesn't matter what they play, as long as they make sure they keep about 5-7 of the staples in the set for the not-hardcore fans.   If I'm at a Metallica show, I'm getting stoked for ANY song they play.   They could any song off any of their albums...   Hell, they could even play a cover of Taylor Swift's ""Shake It Off"", and I'm still going to be stoked for it.     But, I hope they mix up the sets next tour, and bust out those deep cuts that have never been played outside of the album."
Metallica,383u0y,weirdmountain,14,Mon Jun 1 21:34:09 2015 UTC,Ain't My Bitch could actually be a great opening song.

Metallica,383u0y,Vickshow,3,Mon Jun 1 22:27:19 2015 UTC,"The next tour will likely have songs from their new album. I can't imagine them busting out too many obscure cuts when they've got new songs to promote, plus standards to keep the older fans happy."

Metallica,383u0y,terrynutkinsfinger,-2,Tue Jun 2 11:56:15 2015 UTC,"I have seen well over 500 bands/artists in my lifetime (including small name acts and openers). I don't expect that any band of that caliber and with that many titles under their belt, to play the same songs two nights in a row. In all my years I have seen some bands do maybe one or two big hits to ensure everyone gets to hear them, but when you're talking about Metallica, they should be playing different shows each night. Seven songs is absurd. No, not in 20 years and 500 acts have I ever seen a band perform 7 songs two nights in a row. Never."
Metallica,383u0y,theknowmad,3,Tue Jun 2 12:24:55 2015 UTC,"Then like myself you will have seen many acts perform the same set list night after night. The bigger your repertoire the harder it would be to remember word for word, note for note, the songs you rarely play. Be reasonable and appreciate the fact they mix it up a little."

Metallica,384198,DeadHead468,6,Wed Jun 3 12:47:56 2015 UTC,"I think that may be true for smaller bands, but legendary bands (U2, the Stones etc) still sell out any place they play.   I think the truth of the matter is related to economics though. They play festivals in Europe because they can take a smaller road crew and don't have to haul around a stage, it's so much cheaper to tour that way. You'll notice the few shows a year they do play, in the states, are always events held by someone else - probably for the same reason."
Metallica,384198,weirdmountain,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:57:41 2015 UTC,"Though, they bring their own stage to festivals. Everyone else just plays on it."
Metallica,384198,weirdmountain,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:56:07 2015 UTC,"They are still pretty well known in the U.S to my knowledge. But  I guess Europe just loves them more so I guess they just choose to be there. When they release their new album which should be sometime around next year, they'll come around the U.S plenty"
Metallica,384198,weirdmountain,6,Mon Jun 1 23:51:08 2015 UTC,"They should just start doing a smaller stage show, and playing 2 nights in a row in 20-25,000 capacity venues.   They've been getting tighter and better live (looking at you, Lars.   Proving the haters wrong), and  they don't need all the pyro and fireworks.   Just get out there and play the fuck out of the songs, like it was 1988 again.     If they played 2 nights in a row at venues like the Susquehanna Bank Center in Camden NJ, (Philly local here.   That's my reference point), they'd friggin PACK those joints.    Bring along some kick ass openers in the U.S., too, like Mastodon, High On Fire, Baroness, or Kvelertak.     Maybe even do something to allow/include a local opener per show."
Metallica,384198,SynysterORION,2,Mon Jun 1 21:44:10 2015 UTC,See?! Yes this is a good idea! They sure as hell don't need the money (necessarily) and I know they would sell out in those types of venues! It would be cool for them to go back to that vibe for a little while.
Metallica,384198,weirdmountain,3,Mon Jun 1 21:55:45 2015 UTC,"Hell, they could do a tour like that in the states every 2 or 3 years.   We don't necessarily need a new Metallica album for a new tour, as has been the case previously.   The last time they actually toured the U.S. Was SIX (!) years ago.   If they toured a smaller stage show, with 80-dollar max tickets, they'd sell out every show, and probably make a KILLING on merch.    And that's another thing.  They should do like Maiden does, and sell nice, newly printed, classic-design shirts, and mix in a good 8 new tour designs by artists like Pushead, John Baizely, Richie Beckett, James Stokoe, and whoever comes up with designs for Mastodon's merch, because their shit is awesome."
Metallica,384198,Roqua99,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:05:07 2015 UTC,"Omg yeah if they did 80$ tickets I would splurge on merch.

Metallica,3840ui,ahamm95,6,Mon Jun 1 18:19:59 2015 UTC,"I honestly think it's going to be a great album. They're already multi-millionaires and I think are all pretty comfortable with their family life that (to echo the article), they can focus on what THEY want to do, just like everything up until Black.  If Ronnie Rising Medley is any indication of how Hetfield sounds then it's going to sound great (vocally). The only ""issue"" if I can even call it that, that I had with Death Magentic is that he sounded kind of ""flat"". I'm not sure if that was just his voice at the time, or something deliberately done in the studio but there's a lot more attitude/life in his voice in Ronnie Rising Medley that I really liked.  Musically, I just want them to surprise me. Whether it's heavy, punky thrashy, hard-rocky has ballads etc.. whatever it is I trust that they're going to pump out something that I'll like."

Metallica,380tmb,NYR99,3,Mon Jun 1 07:22:43 2015 UTC,"I was wondering the same thing.  I found this on the Sharpie wiki...    In 2002, Sharpie released Silver and Gold sharpies, which makes two metallic colors. In 2011, Sharpie released the Bronze marker, increasing the number of metallic colors to 3. This generally makes 70 colors."

Metallica,3805m4,Machinax,3,Mon Jun 1 00:50:19 2015 UTC,What was the other one? Did it already happen? Is there media online???  I must hear this!
Metallica,3805m4,MoBaconMoProblems,3,Mon Jun 1 01:28:01 2015 UTC,"It was played at Rock im ... Reiver or whatever it's called a couple of days ago. There's a decent bootleg on YouTube doing the rounds now, but no official media yet."
Metallica,3805m4,Machinax,3,Mon Jun 1 01:35:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks, found it.  Holy. Shite."
Metallica,3805m4,MoBaconMoProblems,3,Mon Jun 1 01:53:36 2015 UTC,Unforgiven II??  After all these years... I wonder what motivated that?  A need for Kirk to redeem himself?
Metallica,3805m4,MoBaconMoProblems,3,Mon Jun 1 01:28:31 2015 UTC,"I wonder what motivated that?   I would really like to know this. I can't imagine too many people within and without Metallica were really clamoring for ""The Unforgiven II"" to make consecutive appearances 18 years after its recording."
Metallica,3805m4,Machinax,3,Mon Jun 1 02:14:09 2015 UTC,"It's probably cause they had practiced it because it was up for voting at a show last year, but sadly lost to some other song. Maybe since they already knew it and people wanted to hear it they figured why the hell not."
Metallica,3805m4,zeraxify,3,Mon Jun 1 12:14:27 2015 UTC,"Hopefully, it just means that they're mixing up their sets, and busting out songs they've never really played out before.     Looking at Load / ReLoad deep cuts..."
Metallica,3805m4,weirdmountain,2,Mon Jun 1 15:15:07 2015 UTC,Maybe there is an unforgiven 2 ish song in the new album? Trying to get back in the groove before recording?

Metallica,37yaji,Notsoaveragejo3,20,Sun May 31 12:31:42 2015 UTC,"I'm sure I'd buy it, but Het uses his voice so much differently than he did back then that I'm not sure how it would come out.  For me, part of the charm of Kill Em All and Ride the Lightning is how his voice, above all else, really gives away just how fucking young they were when they cut those albums.    Don't get me wrong, I like how he has matured as a vocalist.  It seems like a lot of people bitch about it, especially on live performances, but I think he's done a good job of refining and preserving his voice.    Metallica's old albums are like time capsules that reveal a different period with their style, content and recording quality.  I like to enjoy them for what they are.  I think a thorough remastering would be better than a full-out re-recording.    What I would really like to see is another 'Garage' collection.  I love hearing those guys put their spin on the songs that they like from other artists."
Metallica,37yaji,aeroplane1979,7,Sun May 31 13:30:26 2015 UTC,I would be up for a remaster but not re recording. James voice has changed and Lars would not be committed to recreating his classic drum parts as they were.
Metallica,37yaji,thegreenvalley,1 point,Sun May 31 15:26:30 2015 UTC,"yeah, that's what I came here to say. Fortunately I took the time to read the comments first. I'm not a big fan of completely rerecording an album. Didn't Cheap Trick do that?"
Metallica,37yaji,EZE123,4,Sun May 31 18:31:18 2015 UTC,"Iron Maiden has done this by re-recording older songs and releasing them as B-Sides. I always thought it would be awesome for Metallica to do that with a song or two, especially with how the live versions evolve over time. I think that they're content to just let live recordings be this, though."
Metallica,37yaji,strangebrewfellows,3,Sun May 31 12:57:52 2015 UTC,"I would since the problem is that while the songs themselves are awesome, to me, the quality makes them hard to listen to for me."
Metallica,37yaji,rd1994,5,Sun May 31 13:00:03 2015 UTC,"Re-recorded? Nope. This is what live shows are for. Remastered? Take my money. Having said that, Megadeth re-recorded Rust in Peace (and a few others), called it ""remastered"" and IMO absolutely fucking ruined a masterpiece, and have made me afraid of this. I don't see Metallica ever pulling a move like this though. If I sound bitter it's because I can't find a non-remastered version of Rust in the legal digital realm (Xbox Music, Amazon, etc.)"
Metallica,37yaji,Hoverboy911,2,Sun May 31 15:49:47 2015 UTC,Google Play has two copies of it. One says 2004 Remaster and the other (more expensive) one doesn't. The samples definitely sound different.  Remastered  Probably not remastered
Metallica,37yaji,MonkeyChowder,3,Sun May 31 23:47:56 2015 UTC,Anthrax did a sort of greatest hits re-recording and it was pretty awesome. Yeah Mrtallica could have my money. I'd buy it. On vinyl. For reasons.
Metallica,37yaji,xXIronSausageXx,1 point,Sun May 31 12:55:28 2015 UTC,"I love that album, but it was mixed and mastered fucking terribly.  I have a copy of it on vinyl, and it is one of the worst sounding records I've ever heard.   It's a shame, because they did a killer job with the re-recorded versions of those songs."
Metallica,37yaji,weirdmountain,2,Mon Jun 1 15:18:57 2015 UTC,"They kinda did that with through the never. Two caveats though, they have to keep the guitar solos because Kirk cannot replicate them. And the vocals need to stay the same cause James sounds enitrely different."
Metallica,37yaji,shyataroo,2,Sun May 31 13:31:07 2015 UTC,"I would've loved to have heard a remaster of Kill Em All recorded in 1988 or 1989. Besides that, I like the current sounds, though I am looking forward to the remasters strictly for the better sound quality."
Metallica,37yaji,TerrrorTwlight,2,Sun May 31 16:22:30 2015 UTC,If they could make all the albums sound like Justice they can definitely have some more of my money.

Metallica,37y7sm,rock4ever123,6,Sun May 31 12:01:06 2015 UTC,I'm a firm believer that the only way to make a proper Top Metallica list is to break their discography in half at the Black Album due to the stylistic differences between pre and post Black Album releases. Just my two cents.
Metallica,37y7sm,xXIronSausageXx,3,Sun May 31 13:01:45 2015 UTC,I'd throw DM in with the first four though.
Metallica,37y7sm,Caboose119z,2,Sun May 31 19:13:35 2015 UTC,It's the only way. It's like 2 completely different bands

Metallica,37wvyb,ahamm95,6,Sun May 31 01:59:59 2015 UTC,"See, there used to be a time when Metallica's live performances were as good as, if not better than, their studio performances. It's to do with both their choice of live tone, and the evident deterioration in James' voice. I'd say things held strong all the way up until S&M - I can watch Cunning Stunts on repeat and still be in awe as to how tight the band used to be, live. But then the guitar tone changed after St. Anger, it's become a lot more crunchy, as opposed to being more thick and encapsulating, which has really killed the feeling of a lot of songs when played live. The songs from the Puppets-Justice eras NEED that specific tone of guitar, otherwise they just sound messy.  As for his voice - I saw Metallica in Moscow in 2007 - during what I like to call the ""recovery years"", when James' voice was awful. I'm glad he's found his tone again lately, and he seems to have added some great depth to make up for the lack of gravel in his voice, and hopefully that carries through to the next album. But yeah - live - his voice is currently better suited to the songs that require more ""singing"" than the early thrash stuff.  TL:DR - Metallica WAS great live, last great DVD was S&M. Since St. Anger, tone change and James' voice have been the crutch of their live performances."
Metallica,37wvyb,DannyLeSock,3,Mon Jun 1 09:20:36 2015 UTC,"Lately Kirk has been fucking up the really high whammy bar parts of Puppets, and before that the guitars sounded sour during the duel guitar riff. It sounded really good at rock in rio though."
Metallica,37wvyb,Thepunkrockprince,3,Sun May 31 04:50:10 2015 UTC,"I can't think of anything, maybe Nothing Else Matters... Metallica always seem to sound much better live than in the studio. Death Magnetic for example is an album that is infinitely better live than in the studio."
Metallica,37wvyb,25willp,3,Sun May 31 07:35:10 2015 UTC,"I would have said Nothing Else Matters as well, I think Lars is mainly to blame though he constantly adds in fills and rolls that aren't in the studio version and it just sounds rushed or cluttered. Feels like he's bored having to play a slower beat so he's trying to compensate for it and it just doesn't fit for me."
Metallica,37wvyb,reaper91,2,Sun May 31 10:53:43 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Lars kind of sucks at anything slow, studio or live. He's just not very creative, so when you take away the speed and impact, there's not much left.  I love their ballads, but in every single one I cringe at the drums."
Metallica,37wvyb,MoBaconMoProblems,2,Mon Jun 1 01:42:29 2015 UTC,Yea Lars works well with the fast songs but he really struggles with ballads and playing more subtly.
Metallica,37wvyb,reaper91,2,Mon Jun 1 06:19:35 2015 UTC,"Lars has mentioned this in interviews, and even said that it was a main reason he ""dumbed down"" his drums going into the Black album and Load/ReLoad. He mentioned seeing Sean Kinney (Alice In Chains) tearing it up on a small drumset and wanted to delve into the challenge of laying down more creative drum tracks with less equipment."
Metallica,37wvyb,whosline07,3,Mon Jun 1 20:44:05 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the era, like I prefer Bells studio to modern live but I prefer 1985/1886 live versions to the studio because Cliff improvises the intro a bit and it's faster."
Metallica,37wvyb,Democrab,2,Sun May 31 07:40:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, most of them. The only ones I particularly like more live are For Whom the Bell Tolls, Call of Ktulu, Creeping Death, Bleeding Me, and Outlaw Torn.  The rest are much better on the album, for various reasons. The playing is much tighter, with a better tone, and with the exception of those mentioned above, Lars' fills and footwork on the album is much more interesting and/or fitting than live. It doesn't surprise me that three of the ones I mentioned are from Ride the Lightning, because the drums in that album are just stale."
Metallica,37ursx,AskMeIfImSwedish,4,Sat May 30 15:54:11 2015 UTC,Rob Scallon is Jesus

Metallica,37u97x,yodawg111,14,Sat May 30 13:07:07 2015 UTC,"Even though I did not attend last night concert I feel so hyped and amazed. They haven't even released a new track or album but I still feel like this is a ""new"" Metallica."
Metallica,37u97x,Crashiee,9,Sat May 30 16:03:21 2015 UTC,"To be honest, a change up in the setlist was imminent. The By Request Tour was their way of making back the money they lost on Through the Never and Orion Music + More, and having fun doing so, but they said they were very disappointed in the By Request Tour.  Avenged Sevenfold played a lot of the same shows with them and in his AMA, M.Shadows said Lars told him how disappointed he was in the tour.   I mean, I'd be sick of playing the same songs every show for 30 years."
Metallica,37u97x,Crashiee,6,Sat May 30 16:33:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed and I've also heard the same stories about Lars. The setlist from their Black Album Tour was a nice change compared to the Request setlist although they played St. Anger here in Denmark - sounds pretty cool live.   I'm really excited to see which song they will play in Munich tomorrow. Any guess? Maybe No Leaf Clover, Low Man's Lyric, The Outlaw Torn or The Judas Kiss will make a comeback? I can only hope!"
Metallica,37u97x,Blackadder18,9,Sat May 30 18:06:59 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to imagine peoples reaction when they played Seek and Destroy. 'No Sandman? No Nothing Else Matters?!?' Would have been a bit of a shock at first haha.  Damn fine set list though. Probably also worth mentioning its the first time Metallica played Frayed on their own behalf, the very first time they played it was because of Metallica by Request."
Metallica,37u97x,Fragdiemilch,5,Sat May 30 14:43:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as they played Seek I was a bit confused because I was expecting the balls to drop onto the crowd but they didn't so I thought ""Hell yeah they aren't finished yet"""
Metallica,37u97x,Bwuhbwuh,7,Sat May 30 15:43:32 2015 UTC,"Hahah same here! I told my friend: ""Oh theyre playing seek and destroy, they're gonna drop the balls now"". Got so confused when they didn't do it."
Metallica,37u97x,masterchef420blaze,3,Sat May 30 16:30:59 2015 UTC,"I like sandman a lot, but they have many much better songs,"
Metallica,37u97x,Bwuhbwuh,3,Sat May 30 19:23:55 2015 UTC,"I doubt they'll ever not play it, since it's their biggest mainstream hit apart from Nothing Else Matters."
Metallica,37u97x,lunchboxchronic,4,Sun May 31 09:03:15 2015 UTC,Fuel was the opener at Rock in Rio for me 3 weeks ago.  King Nothing and Disposable Heroes were played there as well too.  It was fucking awesome seeing / hearing shit live that I never would have imagined seeing. For King and Disposable that is.
Metallica,37u97x,Democrab,3,Sun May 31 05:07:35 2015 UTC,"I got Fuel right after That Was Just Your Life along with Disposable Heroes and Ktulu at the last World Magnetic show in Melbourne, they were all amazing live.  Not gonna life, this is pretty much my perfect setlist."
Metallica,37u97x,MoBaconMoProblems,2,Sun May 31 07:39:03 2015 UTC,"Is there media available yet? I need to hear Unforgiven II.  EDIT: found some phone video on YouTube... and .... DAMN. They rocked it.  Ten THOUSAND times better than the previous performance years ago.  I literally had chills.  This is what this song was meant to be.  Glad they gave it another chance.  Maybe now we'll see some other Load/Reload gems get another go.  Funny, I didn't think Unforgiven II is even one that most people would consider one of the better songs from those two albums."

Metallica,37sv0r,e-dangerously,9,Sat May 30 02:56:11 2015 UTC,"I really think that could become a staple in their set. It was so strong and held its own easily with the original Unforgiven (IMO). Plus, we need more live Reload!"
Metallica,37sv0r,severed_reverie,2,Sat May 30 11:06:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This totally redeems the shitty performance from the 90's. I hope they revisit more Load/Reload. This performance, I feel, is what the song was meant to be.  It friggin' rocked.  I had chills."
Metallica,37sv0r,MoBaconMoProblems,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:46:29 2015 UTC,"The killer of that 90s performance was Kirk's slide playing, sorry to say. But in this he's actually riffing the notes, so they're on point. I've always felt this tune had great live potential (along with a few others from Load/Reload) and this totally proves it!"
Metallica,37sv0r,severed_reverie,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:54:43 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. The 90's performance had Kirk playing a dying cat with a cheese grater. It was terrible.    Load/Reload are rock your face off albums, and they need their time in the spotlight."
Metallica,37sv0r,MoBaconMoProblems,9,Mon Jun 1 02:17:54 2015 UTC,"Even at potato quality, it brought a tear to my eye to hear them play this again. It's my favorite song in the Unforgiven trilogy, and probably top 5 of all Metallica songs for me."
Metallica,37sv0r,zutroy,4,Sat May 30 10:26:11 2015 UTC,I am so glad that this was my first Metallica show. Absolutely fucking legendary. But I'm afraid that there's nothing that can top that lol.
Metallica,37sv0r,Fragdiemilch,5,Sat May 30 12:23:06 2015 UTC,"I wonder why James didn't play his Telecaster. It still sounds fucking great on the Explorer (I can't see too well, but it sounds like the Ken Lawrence) but it's interesting to hear that verse part without the B-bender"
Metallica,37sv0r,1919Eternal,3,Sat May 30 18:22:40 2015 UTC,"Given that they had to adapt how the song was ultimately played, it makes me wonder why they chose to do ""The Unforgiven II"" at all (when they could have done any other obscure song that didn't require a specialized guitar).   Actually, it somewhat surprises me that they even remember ""The Unforgiven II."""
Metallica,37sv0r,Machinax,2,Sat May 30 19:44:15 2015 UTC,Not familiar with this reference. What special guitar?
Metallica,37sv0r,HybridGirth,2,Sun May 31 15:34:27 2015 UTC,"According to Wikipedia's talk page on the song:   James employs a Telecaster with a B-bender to bend the B string up a full step while maintaining open Cadd9 and open G chords (with the thumb on the low E string, third fret).    To be fair, I don't know if that makes a B-Bender a ""specialized"" guitar, but I know bending the B string a whole step up (while maintaining other chord positions/fingerings) is not something he can do on a ... ""regular"" guitar, for lack of a better word."
Metallica,37sv0r,Machinax,1 point,Sun May 31 16:30:42 2015 UTC,Do you know if there are any video or photos of the song being played with a b-bender? I'm curious to see this gizmo.

Metallica,37sv0r,Machinax,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:08:40 2015 UTC,"So... does it actively bend the string, or is it set ahead of time? I'm confused how this works...  Thanks, btw."
Metallica,37sv0r,MoBaconMoProblems,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:16:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I have no idea. I'm not knowledgeable enough about guitar to even make a guess (although there's always /r/guitar). I don't really listen to the style of music where a guitar like this would be played very much, so my exposure to B-Benders doesn't go beyond ""The Unforgiven II."""
Metallica,37sv0r,Machinax,2,Mon Jun 1 02:18:16 2015 UTC,"Cool, np. Here's what YouTube says:  Awesome"
Metallica,37sv0r,MoBaconMoProblems,2,Mon Jun 1 02:22:59 2015 UTC,"You know, that sounds really cool. You could have a lot of fun playing around with that.  A few years ago, a friend of mine and I came up with the idea of covering ""The Unforgiven II,"" with him on guitar. He said he could get his hands on a B-Bender, but the idea evaporated before we got too serious about it. Shame, really, I would have loved to have deconstructed the song to see how it came together."
Metallica,37sv0r,Machinax,5,Mon Jun 1 02:27:50 2015 UTC,Is this show part of the By Request tour? I was checking out the setlist and it seemed to me more like the shows they were prepared to do instead of the generic sets they ended up with. What By Request should have been.
Metallica,37sv0r,RJB6,4,Sat May 30 05:58:04 2015 UTC,I can't stop hearing the main riff that Kirk plays as the Hendrix riff that influenced it
Metallica,37sv0r,shaggy756,3,Sat May 30 09:55:54 2015 UTC,"James voice is so perfect, it almost sound like the original song!"
Metallica,37sv0r,killmore,1 point,Sat May 30 03:41:47 2015 UTC,I'd argue his current voice is better than the Reload recording.  It seems more full and powerful.    I'm still bummed neither this nor the first song made it on S&M.
Metallica,37sv0r,MoBaconMoProblems,3,Mon Jun 1 01:48:53 2015 UTC,Duuuuude! That's so awesome! I can't even believe that they played it again! And also a set with Metal Militia em Frayed Ends! Wow!

What if they replace Sandman too?  It seems like they've heard us call for trading some overplayed songs for rarer songs. They played metal militia, which has only been played 10 times since 1985.

Metallica,37ram1,neonwaterfall,3,Mon Jun 1 01:53:00 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjMPeTnui48  I LOVE that song.  Seriously.
Metallica,37ram1,bruzdnconfuzd,3,Sat May 30 00:03:57 2015 UTC,"You and me both, dude. That song made me discover Metallica - first song I really heard.  As for the clip with Lars and Jason... they must be referring to the 1997 Billboard Music Awards. Why did they think it was such a travesty of a performance?"
Metallica,37ram1,neonwaterfall,2,Sat May 30 05:48:54 2015 UTC,"It sounded ""clunky"", I think.    Listen for Kirk's little slide just before the first verse.  It seems out of place, sort of like they really need to switch guitars mid-song to get the right sound.   Due to timing, they had to cut bits out, as well, so it didn't ""flow"" as it should.    I can't wait to hear the 2015 version of the song.  I know James' voice seems to be off recently and it IS a difficult song to sing technically, but there's still a chance they can nail it and get it to sound epic :)"
Metallica,37ram1,TweetPoster,1 point,Sat May 30 20:29:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I could easily hear the Kirk thing as soon as it hit. I'll have to give the old one another listen thru later. But James' voice didn't sound too off on last night's performance. Doesn't have quite the same Hetfield bite or edge in the original recording, but studio will always sound prettier. Got my fingers crossed that they'll release their own recorded version to beat out the potato-version (for which I'm still grateful!)."
Metallica,37ram1,bruzdnconfuzd,1 point,Sat May 30 20:41:09 2015 UTC,"Just seen the potato version.  Mix seemed overkill on the guitars, but it sounded great otherwise and that could just be the acoustics of the cellphone.    They were really concentrating - nothing happening with the lighting and they didn't move around the stage as much as they usually do.  Have to say, I think the hairs stood up on the back of my neck when I heard the first chorus.   MUCH better than the 1997 version."

This cover was a little jarring at first when I heard it because I was so used to the original, but it is a very good version once you get used to it.     From my experience cannibal corpse is a bit too extreme for the average Metallica fan, but if anyone likes this and wants to check out more, I'd recommend any of these albums -    Eaten Back to Life, because it's their most thrash influenced,     The Bleeding, because it's their best and most accessible of their older style,     and Evisceration Plague, because I feel it's the most accessible of their newer era.     There's also a really good live album called Live Cannibalism that spans most of their career if you want a taste of everything."

So on a scale of 1-10 song structure wise it is a -4 and James has even said that it was written while he was on the phone and mindlessly strumming the open strings of his guitar and other doodles that got thrown together into a song at the last minute.  Add on top of that some fairly uninspiring lyrics and about 3 minutes too long...the solo is good but that's about it.  My opinion.

Metallica,37ps2l,DeadHead468,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:46:24 2015 UTC,"I gotta say Seek and Destroy. Don't get me wrong, it's a good song. But Metallica themselves even overrate it themselves by performing it at the end of EVERY show and are like ""THIS IS CALLED SEEK! AND! DEESTROYYYYYYY GO!!""Also, the song is basically the same riff until the guitar solo in the middle. Just not a lot of variety to me so that's why I think it's their most overrated song."

I'd love to get back into this project, but I by no means plan to take over it again, as people didn't seem to like my ideas from the last time (I was rather picky with recording and all that, and again I apologize). I'm not home right now, but I'm gonna be working on my audition within the next few days to get it in before the deadline.   OP, will you be going with the same songs that were chosen last time around?  Also, if you need help with the composition of the medley, I'll be available.

St. Anger is a raw album of emotion and anger, you can't reign the music in and justify giving it the title of St. Anger. The original is exactly what it needed to be, and what made it enjoyable."
Metallica,37mkip,Metallicarox,4,Thu May 28 20:05:43 2015 UTC,"I haven't checked out the rerecording just yet, but that is exactly what I liked about St. Anger. It's a heavy, raw album.  I even like the dropped snare. Not in general, but in that context."
Metallica,37mkip,DoylePTB,3,Thu May 28 20:47:29 2015 UTC,If you mean the donk noise of the drums is raw and emotional then I agree.  Otherwise the mix they released was utter shite.
Metallica,37mkip,MetalikillA,3,Fri May 29 02:22:01 2015 UTC,"My problem with it starts when he does not keep to the material.  Not more than a few seconds into Frantic I can tell it has been sped up, then about 55 seconds in he starts using power chords where there need not be any.   The rest of the album follows the same suit. What I liked about the original has been stripped away and this surgical display of notes leaves a bad taste in my ears."
Metallica,37hwgw,erftonz,10,Wed May 27 19:29:59 2015 UTC,The new snare is a little loud on the mix. They should have put it in a bit lower... but the idea is awesome. Very funny/excruciating.

Metallica,37hwgw,HenryKillinger,7,Wed May 27 21:35:48 2015 UTC,"st anger was in a different tuning, i think that drop C or something, but master is in standard tuning so this isn't really a fair comparison"
Metallica,37hwgw,echoplexe,2,Thu May 28 00:15:48 2015 UTC,Why would the tuning of the guitars have any impact on drum tuning? Yes a very fair comparison.
Metallica,37hwgw,EnfieldCNC,8,Thu May 28 04:56:54 2015 UTC,"Ok, as a reversed example : that big fat 1980's MoP snare sound wouldn't cut through St. Anger's downtuned guitars at all and would get lost in the mix.  The higher, cutting sound used for the snare really was a pretty good choice to go with that guitar tuning at the time they recorded St. Anger.  It prevented the two instruments from sitting in the same frequency range and also had a bit more raw attitude, which seemed to be the theme of that album.  If you think drum tuning has no relation to guitar tuning; you must be a guitarist.  You must also play alone a lot. :)"
Metallica,37hwgw,TheShinyOne,2,Thu May 28 06:28:15 2015 UTC,Thank you.
Metallica,37hwgw,echoplexe,0,Thu May 28 16:55:29 2015 UTC,I think it's funny you say that because they still tune down a full step and more live to help James. But the snare sounds more like master of puppets live than anything else. Seems to make big Mick Hughes happy. Lots of down tuning on death magnetic too and the snare drum sounds like an eagles record.... Seems to cut through fine.
Metallica,37hwgw,Nakmus,2,Thu May 28 07:13:15 2015 UTC,"Don't they usually just tune it a half step? Only songs in D are Sad but true, whiskey and devils dance. Then the entire st.anger album is in drop C#"
Metallica,37hwgw,echoplexe,1 point,Thu May 28 07:21:40 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure everything is played in D live and songs off of kill Em all and sad but true may be lower. It definitely sounds lower than D#

Metallica,37hwgw,echoplexe,2,Thu May 28 07:38:44 2015 UTC,Wow you are right I checked it out. I think maybe it's the chorus on the clean that makes it sounds so low. Good call. Doesn't completely disprove my point tho either.
Metallica,37hwgw,Nakmus,1 point,Thu May 28 16:58:32 2015 UTC,"No, you are right in that the male singing voice is a lot better fit to D#, especially after Hetfield losing his voice under black album."

Metallica,37hwgw,EnfieldCNC,0,Fri May 29 05:51:46 2015 UTC,"... But you're comparing live sound to studio sound, which isn't what my comment (or this thread) was about.  Apples and oranges.  One is something you can tweak to work nearly perfectly since you have the time, the other is something you get in the ballpark pretty quickly and it has to work for every song from every era for one night only.  Probably easier for a more one-dimensional band like Lamb of God but tougher for a band with a seriously varied catalogue like Metallica.    Also, if you're really comparing the Death Magnetic drum sound to an Eagles record... I'm worried about you man! :-D"
Metallica,37hwgw,echoplexe,1 point,Thu May 28 17:28:04 2015 UTC,Lol. I'm just saying the snare drum on DM sounds more like a thump than a crack compared to the 90's stuff. Also don't you think if the band would need to be mixed that way in the studio that the same principles should apply live? They are using a Midas digital console with well over 60 inputs per night. Mixing on the fly with such technology is almost something of the past. They have the ability to play different rooms year by year and keep full mixes saved and then tweak the day of to fix minor inconsistencies. So all that's left is to just straight up mix the band like it is the studio.
Metallica,37hwgw,echoplexe,1 point,Thu May 28 19:58:32 2015 UTC,If the snare drum disappears in the studio it will also live given the same tuning hypothesis. The laws of sound don't change just because you are on a live pa rig compared to studio monitors. Only the room does.
Metallica,37hwgw,BlackDeath3,1 point,Thu May 28 20:02:37 2015 UTC,"this isn't really a fair comparison   I don't think it's supposed to be. Not only does what /u/EnfieldCNC said about the time differences between the two albums apply, but they're also very different albums aside from that. You touched on that above, but it's much more than just guitar tuning that separates MoP from SA.  It seems pretty clear to me that this video was done for humorous effect more than anything else."

Metallica,37hwgw,EnfieldCNC,4,Thu May 28 01:06:35 2015 UTC,"Jeez, what's next - Led Zep songs with a modern, super crisp close mic'd drum sound?  :)  Of course it's going to sound hilarious, the era mismatch is extreme.   It's kinda like an old woman getting a boob job (and a bad one at that).  It's disturbing because one part just doesn't match the rest at all.   I probably would hate that album if any individual thing was changed to a modern sound.  It would be unsettling to the status quo of the album as it exists in my brain.  edit : Also, if you feel like doing a Zep song I think that would really be pretty funny.  I'm guessing the results would be pretty tragic."

And I fucking love that idea. The idea that your whole life is spent waiting, never moving on, never letting go; it's not romantic, it's pretty bleak and melancholy.   ""The Outlaw Torn"" is easily one of my favorite Metallica songs, partly because of the music, but the sheer depth of emotion in it. From a thrash metal band that wanted to call their first album Metal Up Your Ass, it blows my mind."

Metallica,37df2d,ShtupidCow,1 point,Tue May 26 20:35:59 2015 UTC,pretty much sums it up.. you can probably kill yourself after a metallica show because nothing you see will be as cool as that for a very long time. I have been sky diving and i compare it to going to a metallica concert.
Metallica,37df2d,theshitlord00,19,Thu May 28 14:14:27 2015 UTC,"Constant high energy.  Not as much moshing as a slayer show, but everyone gets into it and has a great time."
Metallica,37df2d,sbujrb,5,Tue May 26 20:39:48 2015 UTC,"I had a dude behind me tell me to sit down during the Metallica concert I went to. And, being a big wuss, I did it, and I asked my friends to do it.  Man, I regret bitching out and doing that. If you don't want to stand on your feet for a few hours, perhaps a metal concert is not the place for you?"
Metallica,37df2d,BlackDeath3,10,Tue May 26 23:32:42 2015 UTC,"Sit...down...at...Metallica??? Does not compute! I went to a Celine Dion concert once and everyone stood the whole way through, who the fuck does one sit through an entire Metallica concert?"

Metallica,37df2d,BlackDeath3,2,Wed May 27 01:18:28 2015 UTC,My first Metallica show I was in the seats at MSG but by their third song everyone was on their feet.

Metallica,37df2d,BlackDeath3,-1,Wed May 27 01:27:32 2015 UTC,How exactly do you determine which is the appropriate way to 'experience' a metal concert?   I want to enjoy the concert as well and not have to constantly look behind me because some asshole is crowd surfing his boot into the back of my head. I also don't want to keep having people batter me and call it 'moshing'. I should be able to enjoy my music experience without having to worry about my physical safety.
Metallica,37df2d,mblitch,6,Tue May 26 23:49:06 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you missed the part where the other guy was actually the one dictating commands. All I said is that if you aren't willing to stand for a few hours, you might want to avoid places where people tend to stand for a few hours."

Metallica,37df2d,elvinbolo,2,Sat May 30 17:06:44 2015 UTC,I feel like its all part of going to a concert. A boot on the back of the head isnt as bad as it sounds.

Metallica,37df2d,sbujrb,12,Tue May 26 21:02:49 2015 UTC,More of the same. Lars bass drum will kick you in the chest. They sound much better live than the liveMetallica.com recordings would have you believe.
Metallica,37df2d,bardyTV,2,Tue May 26 21:19:14 2015 UTC,Haha those recordings still make it seem like they kick ass
Metallica,37df2d,Thedamned22,6,Tue May 26 21:25:24 2015 UTC,"Extremely loud. My Dad and I are both metallica fans so we went to the Big Four when it was in Yankee Stadium and they were just a tad louder than Slayer. I'd say that's probably only because they were the headliner. So long story short, very damn loud."
Metallica,37df2d,JayMoona,17,Wed May 27 00:28:10 2015 UTC,Hetfield will welcome you to his metal family.  That will feel nice.  Then 3 days later you're ears stop ringing.

Metallica,37df2d,JsseNlsn,7,Wed May 27 08:33:54 2015 UTC,Power. Energy. Adrenaline. The guys are stage beasts and James especially knows all the tricks in the book to keep the crowd constantly revved up. You'll feel the bass shaking your stomach and the drums shake your muscles. You'll get sweaty but it's not nearly as physical exhausting as a mosh pit in a Slayer concert.
Metallica,37df2d,PhantomLordJD,2,Tue May 26 21:44:41 2015 UTC,"Haha I was exhausted after slayer, I fell asleep in the cab on the way back. I need to see them so bad"
Metallica,37df2d,Zennakku,3,Tue May 26 21:58:21 2015 UTC,"That's more than understandable! I once saw them at the Big 4 concerts. In one night Anthrax, Megadeth, Slayer and Metallica! In that order. We were blown away."
Metallica,37df2d,hosinthishouse,3,Tue May 26 22:11:33 2015 UTC,I'm so jealous of you. That would be the pinnacle of my life. How would you rank them in order cf best show?
Metallica,37df2d,KeAnE214,4,Tue May 26 22:15:58 2015 UTC,"I warmly suggest you get ahold of the Big 4 Blu-Ray then, it's a must have and the next best thing! As for ranking, I'd say right about in the order as they performed. Anthrax were really great, funny and old school. Megadeth were relentless in their brutality, pure unadulterated trash metal. I am not much of a Slayer fan, not quite my taste, but they were more than up to their reputation as you have experienced first hand. Then Metallica: when they lined up it felt it wasn't the ""Big 4"", more than the ""Big 3 + Bigger 1"". It seemed like the others were just an opening act and completely owned the exhausted crowd. I won't spoil you the setlist, but you are in for a real treat!"
Metallica,37df2d,hosinthishouse,2,Tue May 26 22:28:44 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I'll try and get that. I wish I was born like 20 years earlier lmao. I could have seen these bands evolve and gone to their shows in different eras."

Metallica,37df2d,theshitlord00,6,Tue May 26 21:41:47 2015 UTC,There will be a moment where you and James Hetfield make eye contact (or at least feel like you do) For me it happened during For Whom The Bell Tolls during Orion. It's the closest I've come to a religious experience. ABSOFUCKINLUTLEY.
Metallica,37df2d,rh21_,1 point,Wed May 27 04:58:56 2015 UTC,"They were the second band I ever saw, Fade to Black is my favourite song and that intro is probably my favourite solo as well.

I'll never fucking forget that."
Metallica,37df2d,Trash_Boat_2055,5,Wed May 27 11:29:06 2015 UTC,"Very, and I mean a stupid level of loud. Imagine putting your ear right next to a 20 foot speaker. Now imagine something being that loud when you're 100 feet away from it."

Metallica,37df2d,schmidtmike76,6,Tue May 26 22:44:55 2015 UTC,I recently went to Rock In Rio with my dad and it was a great experience. We both enjoyed Rise Against and Linkin Park before but of course the main thing we were looking to was Metallica. It's absolutely amazing. The drums made your skeleton shake. The bass rippled through the air and the guitars were beautiful. The only thing that did suck is we had to stand for 4 straight hours to get a good spot.
Metallica,37df2d,25willp,2,Tue May 26 23:59:21 2015 UTC,"I was there too! Rise Against was awesome! Metallica was soooo fucking loud, but good all the same!"

Metallica,37df2d,Democrab,2,Wed May 27 01:32:35 2015 UTC,It's fucking awesome. You find yourself singing to exactly every song and the energy is explosive. I was in Denmark last year and this year I'm going to Ullevi in Gothenburg.
Metallica,37df2d,Bwuhbwuh,2,Wed May 27 06:20:18 2015 UTC,I have taken a few non Metallica fan friends to their shows and each and every one of them have sworn its the best show they had seen. You will not be disappointed
Metallica,37df2d,Democrab,2,Wed May 27 07:20:34 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen Metallica live since 1990, but it was one of the single best concerts I ever went to.   Metallica play long sets, lots of pyro and lots of energy. They are a fantastic live act. Behind only Iron Maiden (IMO) as far as live metal acts go and I've seen them all."
Metallica,37df2d,Bwuhbwuh,2,Thu May 28 13:41:10 2015 UTC,Didn't they stop using pyro though? I think they decided on giving lightshows because of James' bad experiences with pyro.

I just don't think recording is the worst thing in the world, as long as you keep it in check and remember to respect the band.

Metallica,36z7uy,stinkadickbig,0,Sat May 23 11:06:54 2015 UTC,He mixes them just right - they're not too loud like other people tend to do it.
Metallica,36z7uy,heltflippad,2,Sat May 23 11:07:43 2015 UTC,Imo this sounds too loud. The high frequenzies on the bass is almost louder than the snare on the thing that should not be.
Metallica,36xh7m,belovedquasar,9,Fri May 22 22:46:59 2015 UTC,That guitar tone is awful.
Metallica,36xh7m,shaggy756,3,Sat May 23 01:26:54 2015 UTC,Wow.  This is truly terrible.

Metallica,36xh7m,bleepblopbloop,1 point,Sat May 23 17:37:06 2015 UTC,Mainly put it here because the vocals sound like Jason and its not a complete copy of the original note for note
Metallica,36xh7m,kevonicus,-6,Sat May 23 18:13:06 2015 UTC,Much more full than the original. To me the whole song is as if it were Pantera.
Metallica,36tma0,soupstone,20,Fri May 22 00:45:22 2015 UTC,"Its my favorite album of theirs, and aside from that, I think its their best overall work,  just edging out puppets. Its their most progressive and most technical album, I feel like its lyrically their best as well, and judging from live videos of that era, I feel like it was the tightest they ever were as a band. Sucks you don't like it really at all, but everyone has different tastes. Maybe it'll grow on you down the road still. Its a very technical album which may be why its taking longer to sink in with you. But then again it hit me immediately when I was 8 or 9 when it came out, so that could very well not be true. If ride is your favorite, then maybe you're just not a fan of such technical music in general?. I don't really know man, to each his own. Hopefully one day it clicks for you because it really is fantastic."
Metallica,36tma0,Strider_,2,Fri May 22 01:01:51 2015 UTC,"I love technical metal, and I absolutely love Megadeth's Rust in Peace, and some other melodic death stuff, but the writing style just hasn't clicked with me."
Metallica,36tma0,bermental,3,Fri May 22 01:11:00 2015 UTC,It really is a weird album by musical standards. I love it because it just sounds so different then everything else but I do find if you listen to it at a respectable level of volume it isn't the same album. I used to use it to piss off the neighbours as an early teen. Throw it on REAL loud and you might just get it.  I ripped two 10 inch speakers living in a trailer/mini home to give you an idea of how loud I used to listen to it.

Frayed Ends, Shortest Straw, and Dyers Eve all come to mind. God Dyers Eve while cruising down the freeway would be so fucking awesome."

Metallica,36tma0,Matthew94,1 point,Fri May 22 20:33:55 2015 UTC,"Shame they never play it live these days, hell of a song. Better than something like Shortest Straw which still gets played from time to time."
Metallica,36tma0,serosis,6,Fri May 22 09:23:32 2015 UTC,"The first song that really got my dick hard from Justice was Eye of the Beholder.  I remember the first time I heard it like it was only yesterday. In a used record store, it was the only album I had not heard of Metallica's at the time since I was given the rest as a hand-me-down.  I found the fade in intro riff kind of interesting so I kept listening, and when that main riff hit(from 0:45 - 1:11) I bought the album right then and there.  It was also shortly after that I picked up the guitar. That was the first song I learned the rhythm through and through."
Metallica,36tma0,Testiculese,6,Fri May 22 02:56:14 2015 UTC,"I went from full-on hippy to black shirt metalhead in one week, after hearing Shortest Straw. I was at my cousins, and he said ""check out this tape"" and puts the AJFA cassette in the player. I had never heard anything like that before. I was completely blown away. The only thing I said was ""I need to learn how to play that"" I didn't want to learn it. I needed to.  I bought a guitar by the end of the month, and started learning how to play Shortest Straw. It took about 3 years, as I didn't even know what a power chord was. Never held a pick. It was the first rhythm I learned note for note. What a brutal way to pick up an instrument! I started working backwards from AJFA down to KEA, and learned them all.   Hetfield really is the only reason I started playing, and really the only reason I keep playing. Sure, I've branched out to a dozen other artists, but I could only play the first 4 albums for the rest of my life and still be just as happy."
Metallica,36tma0,TheFriffin,3,Fri May 22 13:11:15 2015 UTC,"I went from classical music and pop Queen 13 year old to Metallica fanatic in the span of about a week  My dad showed me his old guitar, and I was curious as to what the hardest guitar riffs were, and Puppets was No. 3 on the list (which, in retrospect, is probably incorrect)  I checked it out, and immediately bought the entire album on iTunes"
Metallica,36tma0,Matthew94,3,Fri May 22 18:27:08 2015 UTC,I know it might be controversial to say   Not liking an album isn't controversial.
Metallica,36tma0,theshitlord00,3,Fri May 22 09:22:20 2015 UTC,AJFA if my favourite album of all time
Metallica,36tma0,ephen_stephen,3,Fri May 22 15:44:44 2015 UTC,"This is one of the reasons I love Metallica, everyone has a different favorite album. AJFA is mine."
Metallica,36tma0,leadfarmer153,3,Fri May 22 18:08:23 2015 UTC,Frayed Ends Of Sanity has Kirk's best solo. There are many different styles contained in just that one solo. It sounds like he is dueling himself. Give it a listen and really listen to that solo carefully.
Metallica,36tma0,stinkadickbig,4,Fri May 22 21:41:27 2015 UTC,"Some of the songs drag on for too long, I think. The title track and ''To live is to Die'' are extremely repetitive and too long for their own good.   However, Harvester of Sorrow, Frayed ends of Sanity, Shortests Straw, etc. that stuff is great. I actually like the drum sound, sounds so epic and heavy.   The guitars sound very ''bare'' because there is no bass. Listen to the demo version of ''Wherever I may Roam'', the bass isn't mixed into it - the sound is similar to Justice. Now, listen to the album version, it sounds just so much fuller and heavy."
Metallica,36tma0,xVocalTestx,2,Fri May 22 08:15:47 2015 UTC,"For me,...AJFA is in my top 5, but it's not in the top 4.  But the top 5 Metallica LP's for me are leagues ahead of most other bands I listen to.    I get your point about the mix/mastering of the record, there's no depth to the guitars without the bass, which makes them end up sounding too crunchy.  I feel like an anniversary remix of this record would be something a lot of people will be interested in hearing.    The other point I agree with you about is the song legnths.  Some of the songs are long for no reason other than they didn't really know how to end at the right time and just added in another verse/chorus/bridge section to round it off.  I wonder if it was the recording process where they originally sought to use the guy who recorded Appetite For Destruction and that went sour for one reason or another.  Then they ended up going back to record with Fleming, I think it was at first in the States and then they returned to his own studio.  I might be a bit off with this info as I only read it in Borth, School, Metallica, Death earlier this year but having been playing in touring bands for 15 years I know how the writing and recording process goes and moving studios and producers can be detrimental to the writing and ultimately the feel of the record.    I feel like a lot of people dig the songwriting on this record, it's by no means bad at all, but by their standards at the time I just feel it was a little lazy.  Great album, but just a tad lazy, rushed if you will."
Metallica,36tma0,binarysmurf,2,Fri May 22 10:44:06 2015 UTC,"I have the same mindset as yourself. AJFA is technically brilliant, but it just doesn't click with me. There's nothing wrong with the fact that you simply don't like the album. :) Harvester, Blackened and One are fucking excellent. Most of the other songs are over-long and over-produced. Just my opinion."
Metallica,36tma0,Metallicarox,2,Fri May 22 12:21:02 2015 UTC,"I don't really like it that much either. The three songs I like on there are blackened, one, and ...And Justice For All."
Metallica,36tma0,FloydRosita,2,Fri May 22 14:03:13 2015 UTC,"the mix, at least on the CD I bought, was always too flat and monotone for me to get into the album at all. I think I've never heard it the whole way through"
Metallica,36tma0,legendary_skulls,2,Fri May 22 14:30:04 2015 UTC,"I won't argue with you AJFA was mixed horribly. But personally I like it just as much as their other albums, you can hear the aggression in all the songs. They had plenty of grief and rage after cliff. I really hope someday they remaster it or maybe even re-record it. Dyers eve is my favorite form the album"
Metallica,36tma0,iameveryone2011,2,Fri May 22 20:08:11 2015 UTC,I feel the songs on st anger and death magnetic are too long for just being long.  A lot of tracks on those two could shave off an extra chorus or two and be much tighter tracks. As for justice it is probably number 3 or 4 on my list with load/reload at the top followed by no life til leather/puppets and lightning
Metallica,36tma0,lodeus1,2,Fri May 22 21:19:35 2015 UTC,Its not my favorite but it was the album when I discovered they were more than just the songs I heard on the radio all the time(mostly TBA and Load songs).

And nobody's right or wrong.  Except in this case. You're clearly wrong. Justice is perfect."
Metallica,36tma0,BornIntoAttitude,2,Tue May 26 01:59:42 2015 UTC,"I USED to not like justice, except One and Blackened. I started digging the album, however, after I heard the live version of the title track in the Through the Never soundtrack. The rest of the album came in gradually.Once it clicks, you get to realize how amazing the songs actually are."

Metallica,36tma0,WATTHEBALL,2,Wed May 27 08:44:35 2015 UTC,Try watching some concerts from 88 to 91.  It really shows how heavy these songs really are.
Metallica,36tma0,serosis,1 point,Fri May 29 19:29:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's their heaviest forsure...Death Magnetic is kind of heavy too but more in a ""nu-metal-y"" kind of way that was popular in the 2000's.  Like every album, there are songs that I absolutely love and some that are ""meh"" to me but just take time for them to win me over.  I used to not really like And Justice for All and I only liked the chorus of Blackened( lol, I know, spare me) but then I watched one of the best shows (imo) they put on which had a lot of their songs from And Justice for All and it totally won me over. Now I really appreciate the album and while it may not be my favourite, it's definitely up there.  Watch this and see how you feel after:  Metallica- Live Shit Binge & Purge, Seattle 1989  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-jyQu6LNZY"
Metallica,36tma0,WATTHEBALL,5,Fri May 22 01:56:06 2015 UTC,NuMetal?  Do you remember what that used to sound like?  This is what St. Anger was supposed to emulate.
Metallica,36tma0,TheFriffin,6,Fri May 22 02:55:50 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'm not sure how to describe the sound of Death Magnetic...you're right it wasn't really nu-metal but it definitely isn't traditional metal. It was heavier than most of their albums other than And Justice for All but just had a really 2000's sound to it. Not sure how to describe it.  I liked it though."
Metallica,36tma0,WATTHEBALL,5,Fri May 22 12:44:41 2015 UTC,"Death Magnetic was their attempt at recapturing And Justice for All (long songs, twenty riffs in each song, a sort of ""complexity"" to the riffs, and guitar solos like AJFA), but it still had Load and Reload (and honestly a bit of Slayer) influence, so it had a much different sound than the no-nonsense heaviness of AJFA"
Metallica,36tma0,serosis,3,Fri May 22 18:30:46 2015 UTC,"That's a good description of Death Magnetic.   In all honesty this is why I still love Metallica. The fact that they try out new things are the reasons why they've lasted so long.   Yea some of the stuff they've come out with have been less than stellar but each album has at least 1-3 songs that are really good. They're literally several different bands in one which is why I can listen to an hours of just Metallica and never get bored because each song in each album is completely different from eachother.  Who knows, their next album may be another Master of Puppets in terms of being blown away with something we've never heard before.   Sorry went on a bit of a rant there but just thought i'd throw my 2 cents before the inevitable ""sold out"" and ""fuck Lars"" comments come out lol"
Metallica,36tma0,stinkadickbig,2,Fri May 22 18:55:33 2015 UTC,"I think Death Magnetic spans a couple sub-genres of metal along with just plain old metal. Heavy, thrash, and progressive come to mind."
Metallica,36p8ze,Gam3rGurl13,25,Thu May 21 01:10:58 2015 UTC,"Ronnie Rising Medley. Sonically, this is what the next album should sound like, in my opinion."
Metallica,36p8ze,1919Eternal,9,Thu May 21 11:34:44 2015 UTC,"Everything sounds good in this cover. The drums aren't too loud, Lars is playing well, the guitar tones are nice, James sings his ass off, etc. If the next album sounds like that I would be happy."
Metallica,36p8ze,bermental,4,Thu May 21 15:12:27 2015 UTC,Really hope this is the kind of quality we're going to get with their next album. I'm perfectly happy waiting for however long it takes if every song on that album has the same quality as Ronnie Rising Medley. I haven't heard James sound that good in a long time.
Metallica,36p8ze,WATTHEBALL,3,Fri May 22 18:57:29 2015 UTC,"I like it.. but it's clipped, just like Death Magnetic. Without the unnecessary loudness, it would sound so good."

Metallica,36fnoz,clydefrog811,2,Wed May 20 01:54:54 2015 UTC,I have no idea what it's worth. The guy on eBay has it under the vinyl records category and that's how I found it. I offered him 4 and after a week he took it.
Metallica,36fnoz,clydefrog811,1 point,Wed May 20 10:31:55 2015 UTC,I did a search for rock n roll comics on eBay. It seems you got a good deal. Some of them were selling for close to $10.
Metallica,36g8ho,usereyesweb,8,Tue May 19 03:40:31 2015 UTC,I can't help you out but I decided to post just because of relevant name.

Metallica,36dxgl,delta0062,1 point,Tue May 19 17:05:55 2015 UTC,"Not bad. There were a few minor things that really bothered me. That being said, the harmonics sounded pretty cool, and she nailed Hetfield's solo."

Metallica,36a4rm,JIKFLIP_Dylan,5,Sun May 17 17:52:45 2015 UTC,I always felt like The Blackening and The Atrocity Exhibition... Exhibit A were at least influenced by Justice.

Metallica,36a4rm,KirtisO,1 point,Mon May 18 05:44:30 2015 UTC,I would also suggest Evile mostly due to the dry crunch to some of their songs.

Metallica,36a4rm,King-Jimmy,1 point,Wed May 20 11:03:35 2015 UTC,"Anthrax's Persistence of Time is totally Anthrax's answer to And Justice for All.  Also, Chimaira's ""Save Ourselves"" has a very Master/Justice era vibe to it, but with modern heaviness. You can totally picture James with the EET FUK guitar playing that main riff, and the solos are so Kirk it's awesome."

Metallica,365va6,alikeyvan,12,Sat May 16 13:08:25 2015 UTC,I love seeing this side of Hetfield.
Metallica,365va6,tombstone23,10,Sat May 16 19:37:42 2015 UTC,She seems to have a nice bluesy voice. I dont see her following in the metal style but she could end up a great rock singer.
Metallica,365va6,bermental,9,Sat May 16 14:28:25 2015 UTC,"How nervous must he be, playing for his daughter? He can't mess this up! Luckily he's James Motherfucking Hetfield."

Metallica,365va6,ephen_stephen,-1,Sat May 16 16:49:16 2015 UTC,You can tell he is such a good father. I wonder what it's like for her to know that her father was one of the most important punk rock metal motherfuckers in history.
Metallica,365va6,furyofsound,-11,Sun May 17 00:36:12 2015 UTC,Hard to tell if that was any good due to the acoustics and the cheering.

Metallica,35v5ma,brownj99,3,Sun May 17 04:58:19 2015 UTC,I really don't think he has that many years left in him vocally.  It was up and down over the last ~8 years but it seems like it's hit a new level of struggle.  He's dropping octaves in places he never used to. :(  Have they dropped another half step yet?
Metallica,35v5ma,Damage_Inc666,3,Thu May 14 00:12:17 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's still Eb.  EDIT: On a side note, James always struggled with a few notes, they're strong and high even for '93 James, if you check out."
Metallica,35v5ma,brownj99,3,Thu May 14 02:30:31 2015 UTC,"Oh I know, I've practically memorized every year of his vocals.  He's definitely either at just another low, or going through another shift, I don't know lol."
Metallica,35v5ma,Damage_Inc666,2,Thu May 14 02:33:39 2015 UTC,"Probably recording vocals for the album can be demanding for the voice, that's what I usually think, or he's having a not very good day, dunno."

Metallica,35twjo,weirdmountain,9,Wed May 13 14:03:35 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. If them prolonging the album means that it will be better quality, I have no problem."
Metallica,35twjo,weirdmountain,7,Wed May 13 14:11:14 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer they just start cranking them out, especially if they have as many riff ideas as they say they do.     But, at the same time, I understand that those dudes have families that they want to spend a lot of time with, and I know that's really important to them, especially Hetfield.  As well, they've made more money than most other bands, so they can give their families the most awesome lives ever.     A lot of people think it's them being ""lazy"" or lacking in creativity, but I think a hell of a lot more of it is just wanting to hang with their kids."
Metallica,35twjo,sits-when-pees,9,Wed May 13 14:22:15 2015 UTC,"Nine times out of ten, cranking out albums quickly, especially when composed of riffs that weren't properly tied together, is going to result in an abysmal body of work. Constructing and arranging even a single song is a long process, let alone recording, mixing, and mastering."
Metallica,35twjo,weirdmountain,7,Wed May 13 16:54:07 2015 UTC,"True.   Sometimes a song can just fall right together though.   I make some music with some friends, and there are some songs that became songs in no time.   One session.   3 hours.   But then there are some other ideas that we've been hammering into shape for months at a time.    You never know how the Lightning is going to strike."

Metallica,35twjo,baconbash,4,Wed May 13 17:09:45 2015 UTC,"That's why a lot of artists can release a good first album, and maybe a few follow ups, then write crap from then on. The pile up ideas their whole life before, put all that into a few great records, and have nothing left."
Metallica,35twjo,sits-when-pees,2,Wed May 13 22:04:26 2015 UTC,Because those albums were just slapped together from bits and pieces of ideas that had been made a decade ago?
Metallica,35twjo,baconbash,3,Wed May 13 19:16:16 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you on this one. I scrolled down through the comments on this link and everything was about ""Metallica is a bunch of sellouts"" and ""I haven't liked anything since Justice"" and a bunch of other bs.

Metallica,35twjo,Metallicarox,4,Wed May 13 22:02:39 2015 UTC,People are stuck in the past and can't accept that Metallica is adjusting their style to what today's metalheads like.

Metallica,35twjo,Metallicarox,2,Thu May 14 00:27:34 2015 UTC,"I looked up the play which it's supposed to be based on, and I can track the storyline a little bit. But then again I probably can't get all the story because I don't know the play."
Metallica,35twjo,baconbash,2,Thu May 14 18:55:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't listened to Lulu yet, so I can't say anything fairly about that album. There's just so much good music out there I haven't had time for it!  St. Anger though is great, Jimmy Page loved it and it was Jack White's favorite Metallica album.  Load and Unload are also good, yet get a lot of hate."
Metallica,35twjo,SHdude,2,Thu May 14 22:41:52 2015 UTC,"I actually loved the drums on St. Anger. I thought it made it seem more raw and aggressive, plus it was something unique."
Metallica,35twjo,theshitlord00,4,Fri May 15 11:23:02 2015 UTC,let them take their time and all but STOP fucking  touring.. christ! this is turning into a farce. They promised this album last year
Metallica,35twjo,RKRagan,7,Wed May 13 20:12:06 2015 UTC,"They never promised anyone. Touring is what they love to do anyway. And not to mention the fans love it. Especially in places no called America. Also touring is what makes money. Lars even said he gets more sleep on tour than he does at home. These guys are in cruise mode, they stay busy but they're not rushing anything."
Metallica,35twjo,MyDinnerWithZoidberg,2,Wed May 13 20:39:59 2015 UTC,"At least they should keep releasing songs, like Lords of Summer, or an EP to have something to present in these shows, I know they need to keep the cash flowing.  It's starting to feel like a lot of old bands end up doing, playing it safe and exploiting nostalgia  It's understandable, but is it's clear that making new music has not been their priority for years"
Metallica,35twjo,Tbh2006,2,Thu May 14 13:58:13 2015 UTC,"I would say I'm more curious about it than looking forward to it. They've been one of my favourite bands since about 1986, but I'm not feeling the recent stuff. And by recent I mean specifically St anger and death magnetic."
Metallica,35twjo,WATTHEBALL,1 point,Wed May 13 21:00:38 2015 UTC,"Death Magnetic had a sort of And Justice For All feel in terms of how heavy most of their songs were.  What people don't understand is that Metal isn't king anymore. Hell, rock music isn't king...guitars, drums, bass...they're not the leaders. It's unfortunate but it's true.  What the youth love these days is EDM, rap/hip-hop/R&B etc..it's been like this for the last 15 years and I think it's just a phase.  Metal was the same way. It came into the scene in the 70's as something really niche then exploded in popularity in the mid 80's through the early to mid 90's so about 15-ish years until something else took over. I guess it's now rap/edm/hip-hops turn in the spotlight for a while until something else becomes the new leading genre for the masses.  I'm hoping that the traditional metal/rock music will start making a comeback in the next few years but who knows anymore, I just hope that there's going to be another Iron Maiden, Metallica, Pantera etc that comes out of nowhere and knocks everyone on their feet soon.  EDIT: I was watching this 1989 Seattle Concert Shit Binge and Purge and it was probably one of Metallica's best performances I've ever seen them play...When I watch them these days it really seems like they're doing a chore on their live performances. I obviously know they're way older now and they're all not hammered like they used to be but I dunno...wish they could be a little more lively and not so ""rushed""."

Metallica,35twjo,Metallicarox,3,Thu May 14 18:55:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending them. They don't need defending. I'm just saying any time a band releases anything, there are gonna be a little crowd of fans who shit on their new stuff no matter what. Why are you getting defensive? I'm just stating a fact."
Metallica,35twjo,Matthew94,2,Thu May 14 18:56:59 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying any time a band releases anything, there are gonna be a little crowd of fans who shit on their new stuff no matter what.   Fair enough then."
Metallica,35twjo,SportzTawk,3,Thu May 14 19:07:47 2015 UTC,There for a second I thought he was describing the album... Couldn't figure out what the hell it meant!
Metallica,35twjo,Testiculese,3,Thu May 14 03:33:08 2015 UTC,"This is going to be like the GTA 5 release, I bet. People bitching left and right to hurry up and release it, as if they're owed something, then they're going to get a fantastic product, and then bitch about it.   I felt like I was the only one that was saying ""Take more time, do it right"" ... 217 downvotes. Heh."
Metallica,35twjo,theshitlord00,2,Thu May 14 19:38:23 2015 UTC,"im all for waiting if it means the product will be better... but really, we are holding out because they wont stop doing shows. 7 years touring the same album is a little fucking ridiculous. Im a big metallica fan but this is just becoming a farce"
Metallica,35twjo,Nitsut1658,-6,Wed May 13 20:13:19 2015 UTC,"Your title is misleading. At first glance it sounded like that was his opinion of the new album, but after reading he was only talking about the release date.  Edit: Not sure why I'm getting down voted, I'm just pointing out click bait. The article title is clear, but the title OP made omits the fact that Lars is talking about release date."

Metallica,35twjo,BoardroomBimmy,-9,Wed May 13 17:10:35 2015 UTC,Because I like Metallica?
Metallica,35twjo,earthwormjim91,11,Wed May 13 17:34:54 2015 UTC,Odd. I couldn't infer that from you calling their music horribly produced and mediocre.
Metallica,35twjo,elscorcho91,-3,Wed May 13 17:36:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because if you're a fan, you can't criticize their work at all, that makes sense"
Metallica,35twjo,earthwormjim91,11,Wed May 13 17:41:25 2015 UTC,"You haven't even heard the new album. It's fine to have opinions, but to bash something that isn't even out shows that you aren't a fan of the band. Probably just the first 4 albums."
Metallica,35twjo,BoardroomBimmy,-6,Wed May 13 17:52:15 2015 UTC,So I like the first four albums but I am not a fan?
Metallica,35twjo,earthwormjim91,11,Wed May 13 18:02:42 2015 UTC,"Of that music, sure. Being a fan of a band doesn't mean loving everything. It means accepting what they do for themselves. Might not be your cup of tea, but that doesn't make it mediocre crap.  They aren't the same band they were 26 years ago. If you don't like anything they've put out since then, then you're not a fan of the band. Just those 4 albums. Because that isn't Metallica anymore. What they put out now is."
Metallica,35twjo,elscorcho91,-6,Wed May 13 18:05:29 2015 UTC,"He was bashing the stuff they've put out lately. If you weren't being an immature fanboy, you might understand that. Face it, you're not gonna get a personal handjob from James because you're defending their honor"
Metallica,35twjo,earthwormjim91,4,Wed May 13 21:00:54 2015 UTC,"How was I being a fanboy? I didn't say I love everything they've done. I'm just sick of this whole ""they were only good for the first 4 albums"" mentality. They've had some weak albums and shitty songs, yeah.  That doesn't make their shit mediocre.  Its like saying you're a Ford fan, but only like the 65-68 mustang. That makes you a fan of that specific car. Not the company.   Same applies to the band. You don't have to like everything they put out, but only liking less than half the stuff they've done, and over 2 decades ago, makes you a fan of just that specific content. Not the band itself."
Metallica,35twjo,Metallicarox,-1,Wed May 13 21:12:39 2015 UTC,"I don't really any problems with any of the albums including Lulu. But the one song I can't stand is ""Thing That Should Not Be"", I just can't get into it."

Metallica,35lvts,Tenacious_jb,2,Mon May 25 23:44:34 2015 UTC,The $59 dollar ticket will get get you into to the event and to see Metallica.  Parking is of course a separate fee
Metallica,35lvts,cthomb,1 point,Tue May 26 18:16:18 2015 UTC,Ok thanks. The wording is a bit confusing. I just want to get in to the show.
Metallica,35lvts,cthomb,1 point,Wed May 27 14:08:27 2015 UTC,Not to annoy but what's the upgrade you purchased for? Trying to go but I don't want to be stranded out there.
Metallica,35lvts,Tenacious_jb,1 point,Wed May 27 15:55:12 2015 UTC,Its fine there wording is kinda weird i agree. The upgrade i purchased is just for a closer viewing area. The regular tickets can still see the band and the show  just wont be as close to those to do upgrade but i think its all standing room anyway.
Metallica,35lvts,fvalt05,2,Wed May 27 20:54:16 2015 UTC,Ditto! I'm hopping on I-35 for the show from Dallas. Can't wait!!

Believe me I've been listening to them since they opened for Metallica in 2009 and I enjoy them but dude you're crazy.  I don't think a band not playing in your state has anything to do with musical preference.  Sounds like you're just butthurt.  I am too, they disappoint me.  I saw them at Orion fest in Michigan and they gave us the whole ""Detroit is the music center of the world we can't wait to come back we have a 3 year contract it's been the best concert ever!""  bunch of bullshit, broke their contract and never returned.  Ruined my summer.  But even so, they're still, imo, the best metal band in history even though I find their integrity to be a bit.. off at times."

I agree that Metallica is the biggest band of all time, no doubt, just bums me out that they don't get around as much anymore, last night was my 5th Volbeat show since my last Met show.

I just can't believe it. Here I am,TWO INCHES from Metallica, and I'm going to stand like a zombie to capture a REALLY SHITTY video so I can remember the experience I never experienced.  Un-fucking-real.   Back in MY day (34 now, so when I was 19) when I saw Metallica, I pushed and squirmed my way to get to the front of the crowd at an 11-hour concert in the mid-July heat and rock out, knowing it could be a once in a lifetime experience. Not pissing for eight hours, sweating my brains out, being tossed around involuntarily by the big guys moshing (I was only 155 lbs and pretty timid), feeling the heat from the pyrotechnics, and passing out twice during Metallica's set (thankfully the crowd was so tight I couldn't fall over)... I mean, that's what it's about.  Metallica is an experience, not a shitty iPhone video.  It's just damn insulting to them.  It's like the fans are at the zoo, not a rock concert.    Kids."

Metallica,35icbo,Prometheus357,1 point,Mon May 11 15:51:51 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts:  KEA was my introduction to Metallica in 1984 (I was actually looking for RTL but the record store didn't have it).  I think Hetfield was trying to emulate Sean Harris but I agree, I'm glad he abandoned it.  His pre KEA vocals are kind of painful to listen to.  If you listen to the early Mustaine solos, he did a lot of noodling, fast stuff that didn't fit the songs at all. Kirk added some musicality to them.  I've read quotes from the guys where they said they were basically banging on the door to get in the studio during mixing.  I never really had an opinion of the album cover back then but now when I see it, I think it's pretty cheesy."
Metallica,35icbo,dr_oog,2,Mon May 11 11:21:34 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree. Mustaine was to pentatonic soloing what Slayer's ""Jeff Hannenman"" was to chromatic soloing, ""raw energetic jazz"". Kirk's renditions were tame by comparison, even if more melodic. I've always felt that he's too derivative of his mentor Joe Satriani.  http://www.concertfy.com/concertfy-interview-with-joe-satriani-part-2-giving-metallicas-kirk-hammett-guitar-lessons-chickenfoots-future/   You discuss giving guitar lessons to Steve Vai and Kirk Hammett when they were > younger in the book, and I found an interview where you mentioned studying guitar  solos of Metallica songs once Kirk joined the band. Do you recall any songs you > worked with Kirk on, or any pointers you gave him?  The main thing with Kirk that was really a lot of fun was he was a really good  guitar player when he walked in the door. He was already playing lead guitar for  Exodus, so he was already shredding. He had a great right hand, he knew most > of his chords, he just didn’t learn how to play in an environment where he learned > all the names and how to connect everything together. So my job was to take  advantage of the fact that his fingers were already moving like crazy, and we  could focus entirely on melodic and harmonic possibilities that he hadn’t yet  been exposed to, which means I would show him more developed chord  structures. I would show him how to figure out what key he was in, and I would  show him all the different melodic possibilities that exist, scales basically. That’s > a fancy way of saying I had to show him scales and he had to practice them all  over the neck.  The thing that was very interesting that a lot of people don’t realize, is that it was > very exciting because I noticed that Kirk’s age, all the way down to let’s say  about 10 years old, my students were at the very beginning of what turned into  thrash metal, and what became what everybody knows as Metallica and every  other band that was sort of under their wing there. They were coming up with  material that changed the harmonic structure that a then budding lead player  would be stuck playing over. So for instance, I wouldn’t know the names of the  songs, but Kirk would bring in some chord progressions and he’d say, ‘Hey, me > and James were working on this thing and I think there’s going to be a solo over > this section, but I have no idea what key it’s in.’ In those songs people hadn’t  really soloed over chord structures like that, they weren’t blues chord structures, > they weren’t pop structures, they weren’t jazz structures. It wasn’t cut and dry,  and I think if you took even somebody as accomplished as Steve Lukather, who > during that time was the first call electric guitar player in LA for sessions. He  probably would have looked at the chord progression and gone: ‘Oh my god,  what are you going to do over this?’ What it took was the new generation to say > okay, I’m not going to get psychedelic, I’m not going to get bluesy, I have to  create a new path to solo over this new kind of chord progression.  Specifically, this is a very long answer, but it was a good question, I think  sometimes people forget how much work Kirk and his comrades had to put into > this. They had to look at these weird chord structures and navigate through them, > like you’re driving through a crazy off road path where you have to avoid a lot of  things, but somehow you got to make the journey a lot of fun. I would show him > how to look a progression, extract the notes, arrange them alphabetically,  determine the space between the notes, and then check that formula against what I had him memorize. To an American ear that would sound like a bunch of  exotic scales. When I’d say to him choose, I wouldn’t show him what to play, I’d > say: ‘Kirk, these are your options. Be yourself, do what your generation wants to > hear, do what you hear.’ The cool thing was that if you asked him to he could  play Stevie Ray Vaughn. He could play Michael Schenker or early John Roth, he > was a great study of guitarists of the day, but he didn’t imitate them. But it’s also > because he realized I think that they were doing something brand new, so to  copy me or any of those other players wasn’t going to help him create the  Metallica sound.   TLDR; Joe is the architect of the Hammett sound.  It's a meticulous and studious way to make solos, whereas Mustaine, Hannenman, and other thrash scene contemporaries could just improvise and play what they felt though the cost is sometimes repetition or aimless noodling. I'd pay that price to get that ferocious spirit back."

Metallica,35a9p6,Thepunkrockprince,6,Fri May 8 14:49:39 2015 UTC,"Turned out much better than the actual by request tour. The thing is, there's a few songs that almost everyone picks then a few rarities.

Metallica,357fy9,furyofsound,2,Fri May 8 04:46:22 2015 UTC,I hated the fact they didn't show all of Frantic. They had to show the start of the song as the credits played then cut us off from the rest of it.

Metallica,34xnv0,stinkadickbig,11,Tue May 5 12:37:26 2015 UTC,"It's because the guitars (I'm looking at James's here) take up so much room in the mix. Typically a producer will cut the frequencies from a guitar that overlap into bass/bass drum range, leaving room in the mix for both.  If they don't, it leaves the mix ""muddy,"" meaning the instruments are indistinct from each other, as is the case with early Metallica. The reverb on the guitars contributes to this as well.  Hope that helps!"
Metallica,34xnv0,ZBGB,4,Tue May 5 14:45:31 2015 UTC,"The bass drum and bass guitar on Kill Em All didn't have this problem. Each instrument was distinct there, but less polished"
Metallica,34xnv0,yodawg111,3,Tue May 5 21:06:01 2015 UTC,Exactly.
Metallica,34xnv0,MjkArmy,2,Tue May 5 21:26:12 2015 UTC,Absolutely right.
Metallica,34xnv0,Matthew94,4,Tue May 5 15:19:09 2015 UTC,I've noticed the same. The double bass at the end of Fade to Black is almost inaudible.
Metallica,34xnv0,BaldEagle88,2,Tue May 5 19:06:32 2015 UTC,"http://youtu.be/S-QLG5-BjYA?t=348  The bass guitar follows the double bass near the end of Fade to Black - I never noticed this until I heard the isolated bass track. I hope the remastered edition of Ride will have the double bass and bass guitar fixed, they're so cool yet you can barely hear them."
Metallica,34xnv0,SteelRanger,3,Tue May 5 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"I'll get downvoted to fuck, but I've heard in the past that Cliff was noted as a sloppy player. And his death propelled him to the icon that he is now. And if that recording is any indication of his other recordings then what those people said, is true. I'm not a huge Rob fan, but he would never record something that sloppy."
Metallica,34xnv0,BaldEagle88,2,Wed May 6 05:09:04 2015 UTC,"Not going to downvote, but he was the absolute polar opposite, cliff was a perfectionist. There are stories of them jamming in Lars' (pretty sure it was lars) garage and Cliff would spaz on James or anyone else for making minor mistakes. He practiced 6 hours a day even while touring in '86."
Metallica,34xnv0,BaldEagle88,2,Wed May 6 10:47:08 2015 UTC,"He was a perfectionist at composing. His solo work was incredible but listen to a lot of his isolated bass tracks from RTL, just overall sloppy. Not very tight."

Metallica,34xnv0,littlegreenalien,2,Thu May 7 17:13:04 2015 UTC,Is there going to be a remastered version? That would be amazing! And can we get some bass on AJFA while they're at it?!
Metallica,34xnv0,SteelRanger,2,Wed May 6 10:49:06 2015 UTC,"http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/metallica-to-release-remastered-deluxe-editions-of-kill-em-all-and-ride-the-lightning/  Well, they were not satisfied with Justice's sound at all, and pointed out several other issues than just the lack of bass, so if these are going to be released, then it's probably just a matter of time before AJFA gets remastered as well."
Metallica,34xnv0,sumrz,1 point,Wed May 6 13:21:46 2015 UTC,Nice! Had not seen that. Thanks
Metallica,34xnv0,sumrz,6,Wed May 6 18:53:36 2015 UTC,"Several issues at play there, but IMHO the most likely is the quality of the intended playback platform.   Nowadays any car stereo, home stereo, iphone will happily and accurately reproduce sub bass. That wasn't true in the 80ties, bass frequencies were always muddy on cheap systems. So you'd better mix with that in mind cos your main audience didn't had high-end systems. Also mixing for vinyl ment you had to hard cut everything below say 60Hz or so, vinyl was back then still the primary medium, so the mix was intended for that. It took a long time before amps and speakers could accurately reproduce bass.   If you would play a modern mixed record on a normal 80ties sound system, it would probably just rattle the boxes out of their cheap plybox enclosures."
Metallica,34xnv0,legendary_skulls,3,Tue May 5 20:34:58 2015 UTC,"Well, Kill 'em All had plenty of bass - and especially on the vinyl version. It's older than Ride and Master so bad sounds systems are probably not the problem here.  ZGBG is probably on point here, the guitars really get into the bass frequencies. Because of this my subwoofer boosts the guitars as well, so there's no way to hear all the instruments well, unfortunately.  Still, I don't think that's the only cause - they're simply mixed low as well. Even on acoustic or otherwise more silent parts they're rather inaudible too. Why, I don't know.."

Metallica,34fips,tombstone23,2,Thu Apr 30 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"Part of why I started buying vinyl records is because I grew up on (mostly) tapes, and I love listening to the program of a good side.   The tape of Kill 'Em All that I grew up with had ""Blitzkrieg"" at the end of side 1, and ""Am I Evil?"" at the end of side 2.  Ride, Master, Justice, and ""black"" all had great sides.   Nirvana's albums all also had notoriously great sides.     That intermission when you have to flip a tape, or a record, is something that sadly was lost when digital became the predominant format.  I definitely still get that same vibe at the end of ""Fade To Black"" or ""Sanitarium"" that there should be a gap of silence there.     And, I'll stand by my love for St Anger on vinyl, because it's split across 4 17-minute sides, and a lot easier to listen to in small chunks like that."

Metallica,34fips,yodawg111,2,Fri May 1 18:05:34 2015 UTC,"A B-side is how they fill up the extra space on a single. Say your band puts out a 7"" vinyl single. You have a whole second side to use. Put a cover song, a song that's not quite good enough for the album, a live recording, whatever."

Some of the fan mix downs are fairly good which tells me in content, its not a terrible album, but hearing the snare drum buzz due to the baritone guitar's bass level on ""Some Kind of Monster"" is just shoddy work."
Metallica,33m666,Cfx99,2,Fri Apr 24 15:29:14 2015 UTC,"I don't like the snare buzz on that track either, but is it shoddy? It's definitely a choice."
Metallica,33m666,Cfx99,2,Fri Apr 24 17:47:36 2015 UTC,"A choice to make it sound shoddy. I get the whole ""raw feel"" they were looking for, but what they made was what a lot of garage bands have been making forever and it didn't make an impact the way Bob Rock wanted."
Metallica,33m666,Cfx99,6,Fri Apr 24 18:32:13 2015 UTC,I think it's pretty awesome Rock produced the two Metallica albums that are widely regarded as the best and worst sounding. Just interesting.

Metallica,33m666,shotgunassassin,3,Fri Apr 24 19:44:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't listened to the whole album in a while but ""Frantic"" is a pretty damn good song."
Metallica,33m666,fortheturnstiles,5,Sat Apr 25 22:03:13 2015 UTC,"I love St.Anger for many reasons. First, it is raw and honest. No bells or whistles. It's a true garage album, one people were clamoring for. However, once people had it, they couldn't deal because it wasn't this or that. Had this been Metallica's first album, or any other band's album, it would be hailed as a masterpiece. But people expect the impossible from Metallica. St.Anger is pure Metallica, no additives. I could go on and on, but I will just say this one last thing, you can look at the cover art of St.Anger and KNOW it's Metallica. Can you say the same for Load, ReLoad, or Death Magnetic? If there is a Metallica album one can say is pure ""art"", it is St.Anger."
Metallica,33m666,shotgunassassin,2,Fri Apr 24 19:22:36 2015 UTC,I do love the St. Anger album art. Really dig the cardboard/paper packaging for the CD as well.
Metallica,33m666,fortheturnstiles,2,Fri Apr 24 19:27:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry that is not true. St Anger is such a shit album from top to bottom. I love Metallica and I am not criticising them for trying new things, however St Anger is truly (in my opinion) one of the worst albums of all time.    The production - terrible Lyrics - Terrible Song writing - repetitive and terrible Riffs - Dull, droning and repetitive. Songs - Faaaar too long. Invisible Kid is one of the worst offenders but many of the songs repeat the same ideas endlessly.   Some Kind of Monster (the doco) is my favourite music film ever made. It is fascinating watching the band put together such a piece of shit of an album. You can see the excitement from Kirk when he mentions being able to write lyrics and express himself creatively - yet (and correct me if I'm wrong), the lyrics he wrote for Invisible Kid are seriously some of the worst I have ever seen in a song from a professional band.  Also, it is not a 'true garage album.' They wrote sections of songs and then merged them together using protools to make horrible mish mashes of songs. I hate this concept of big bands recording albums in interesting places and claiming it is raw. Dave Grohl had such a massive boner for recording in a garage for one of the Foo Fighters last albums. It's all he would say in interviews. But guess what Dave? It doesn't matter where you record your album if you take a $100,000.00 soundboard in, professionally soundproof the walls, bring expensive furniture and other comforts in. You could record it in a prison but it doesn't matter if you turn it into a professional recording studio before hand.  Anyway.... sorry for the rant and again, I know this is just my opinion but man... I hate that album. I remember listening to it for the first time. I was so fucking amped. The first Metallica album released when I was a fan. At first, I didn't love it, but fuck, it was some new Metallica. And then ever so slowly, over the course of a few days, it dawned on me that it stank. It just stank."
Metallica,33m666,_SongsForTheDeaf_,3,Wed Apr 29 07:17:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there certainly is a lot of debate over this album. If you watched the SKOM documentary, then you know why the album sounds like it does. It wasn't a matter of them trying something new; it was a matter of whether they could even work together anymore. You make it sound like they all had their shit together and should have been able to put out some amazing sounding record. There is no way. When it comes to Metallica, James is the money guy, meaning he comes up with all the tasty riffs and lyrics. Do you really think after all the booze he downed over the years, then Jason quitting, then going through months of rehab, he was going to be able to do that?? It was amazing he could even pick up a guitar and be in the same room with Lars. You missed the entire meaning of the documentary.  The reason St.Anger is such a great record is it's the salvation of Metallica. Without it, there would be no more Metallica. I don't know about you, but I believe these guys are one of the greatest rock bands ever, and I will take their worst record over most bands best record any day. You mention that St.Anger is just ""sections of songs... merged together""... This is how they write; this is how they have written almost every single record. James comes up with the riffs and Lars arranges them into songs. It's been that way forever. The dynamic between those two is the brilliance of Metallica.   You mention that St.Anger was the first album released when you were a fan. So are then trying to tell me that Load and ReLoad were the fantastic records that turned you onto Metallica in the first place? I dig some songs from those records, but come on, as far as aggression and heavy metal are concerned, St.Anger shits all over those records. In my opinion, All Within My Hands is one of the fiercest and most brutal songs they have ever written. You are not going to tell me that a track like Hero Of The Day even compares with that, are you?   I have been a Metallica fan since Ride The Lightning and every album since then has been different. That is what makes Metallica who they are, and why they are leagues above every other metal band. If you want the same record every time, there are plenty of bands that can give you that. I like Slayer and Maiden, but let's face it, for the most part, all their albums sound the same. If you have heard one, you have pretty much heard them all. Metallica is not that band. You get Puppets once and that's it, you get The Black Album once and that's it. Such is true with St.Anger; you get that album once, and that's it.  Hey, we are all fans and we all have our own favorites. I am not telling you that you cannot hate St.Anger. Hate it all you want, a lot of people do. But take time to realize where this album is coming from, and the state of mind the people who put it together, where in at the time. I'd much rather have it than not. Peace."

I get that there was more going on than just trying something new. I'd definitely rather St Anger existed and we still had Metallica. I just don't think you can defend an album with that argument. Sure it helped them stay together. Sure it was amazing that they could even make something given the circumstances. I just think it is a truly terrible album.   No, Load and Reload didn't turn me onto Metallica. I listened to MOP and then AJFA.   I also know how Metallica operates with Lars piecing the songs together. I just feel that with protools it was too easy to write long repetitive songs without actually feeling them out.   Like you say though, it's all a matter of opinion and if some people dig the album then that's cool."

Metallica,33auaf,talktothehand00,8,Tue Apr 21 13:42:49 2015 UTC,"I think LuLu could've worked.  Lou was too old to adapt to Metallica so they should've adapted to him. Play old Velvet Underground tunes till you get the vibe the do similar stuff for Lou and after you get the structure down THEN make it heavy. It's not like VU didn't have heavy moments. You gotta use what's natural to the singer.  Metallica were the best when they were trying to copy Diamond Head. Once they veered too far from their progenitors Motor Head and Diamond Head they lost something. They need spend a few months making fake Diamond Head songs then rework the best of them into something suitable Ride The Lightning era sounding.  There's nothing wrong with the engineered drums on AJFA. If you're a big musical act and you've got a vision for an ambitious new sound then go ahead and use studio tricks to achieve it. If you're afraid of how you'll manage to play it live, hire more band members who can play the tricky parts. Don't give up on complex arrangements because you need to prove something about what you are personally capable of. I don't care if the Black Album is more genuine because its simple enough to play comfortably. I didnt get into Metallica to hear simple music. I don't even care if you have to add a drum machine if it means I get something as cool as AJFA's prog-metal leanings.  Rick Rubin's cool and all but the boys need to work with someone like Flemming Rasmussen again. Maybe someone with more Classical music background."

They have always been their own producers and editors (except during the Rock era, which made them rich, but also seemed to drain them), they pretty much know what they want and they live in a place where you can find a decent sound engineer on every street corner.   They own the rights to their own music, they have their own record company and they probably have enough access to the business to sell their own stuff.  They have achieved (almost) total independence.  So I don't really know why they are still stuck in this cycle of locking themselves up for years in a studio to assemble between 8 and 14 overproduced songs, just like any other band tied to a record deal. Why is that?  Nobody is buying CD's anymore, anyway.  And do you need at least 10 songs to complete a common theme?     I wish they would record a couple of weeks every year, or just when they feel like it, and release what they come up with.   Just three songs?  Fine, focus on them and release.  And they could keep on touring forever."

I HATED Lords Of Summer because I thought it was long, boring and didn't have a solid hook to get invested in. Like, imagine that song wasn't a metallica song, that it'd just been released by some no name metal band. I seriously doubt that those who give it a pass as a metallica song would give it a pass as some other band's song.  I want them to write short, fast punkish songs like Motorbreath and Trapped Under Ice. I've voiced this opinion before and had people excuse them because of their age. I don't give them that pass. If they can't write quality songs anymore, then don't. And that's fine! There'd be nothing wrong with them just going out every few years on tour playing the hits. I'd go see them.  So there, that's my controversial opinion."

I disagree with writing music though, I don't really care about the bands' reputation, if they release no more good music, I just won't listen to it, doesn't make a difference to me. The only thing which would be damaged is their reputation, I'm not part if the band, I don't care about that. Now, let's say that there's only one good song on the next album, and the rest is crap. Well, then, I'd rather have that than nothing, even if I never listen to any of their other new songs.  That being said though, I have faith. Not much faith, but I have faith. DM had some amazing parts, and while I'd be (pleasantly) surprised if the next album is a masterpiece, I'd be surprised if there weren't any good songs on there. Especially the soft songs, for a metal band, they right some pretty damn solid soft songs, and I listen to a lot of soft music.  EDIT: (I don't particularity care about karma, but I think that whoever downvoted me should take a long hard look at reddiquette. Ridiculous)."

Death Magnetic was a true return to form for Metallica and I'm absolutely confident that after 7 years they've recorded another classic.

Metallica,33auaf,serosis,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:08:29 2015 UTC,"Really, Load?  Always thought Reload was a filler album on purpose. It still has good shit on there, but it literally sounds like them taking a couple ideas and hammering them to death over a whole record.  Bob Rock did not do shit. He was only a producer and friend to Metallica until St. Anger saw him actually join. When have Metallica ever had people make up their minds for them?  Everything else is on point with my opinions. Except I probably like St. Anger way more than most anybody here. It was their first release after I became a fan and the first Metallica album I bought(I had the other albums but they were given to me). I learned a good chunk of my self-taught guitar with that album as well."
Metallica,33auaf,Hetstaine,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:24:44 2015 UTC,"Their concerts have so much 'filler' like Sandman etc it is annoying.   St Anger is awesome  Load and Reload although having a few standout tracks are a bit shit and i thought they were more going for mainstreamy than pure Metallica. The Black Album rock vibe and total domination at that time changed them.   I loved DM straight up and didn't give a fuck about all of the sound bullshit going on surrounding it.  I think if Cliff would have lived he would have gone his own way and they would have got a new bassist anyway.  Jason is my favourite bassist  Rob ..fuck..i still can't get into his groove although he does soem good shit  LuLu was shit..oh oops.  All that being said, there is only one Metallica and they really do kick some major fucking ass."
Metallica,33auaf,MoBaconMoProblems,2,Tue Apr 21 12:14:43 2015 UTC,"Load and Reload I think are some of their most interesting work. Maybe not their BEST work, but it's certainly interesting that they explored new sounds so passionately at that time.  There are a few really good tracks (some that never get any attention) and some cruddy ones, but all in all, it was a neat time for them, and they were big enough to do something like that and not only did it not ruin them, but they actually absorbed it as an experimental period. They own it, and fans love/hate it, but in then end most fans still love 'em anyway. I think those two albums are a testament to their greatness, because they say, ""we can afford to do what we want, and it doesn't have to be great"".  More power to 'em.  I know what I'd like to see in a new album, but if they want to make something kinda out there, I'm with 'em on it."

When 2 x4 came on i was like..wtf is this shit ? Sounded like filler. Still, Load at the time got a lot of play at our place as did Reload when it came out but those two albums would definitely be my least played of all.  It's funny, i had neighbours who were huge Johnny Cash fans, one night having a few drinks and a smoke i put on Mama said..dudes were like..Fuck, bit too heavy for me man..blew me out how they had considered it heavy, still does :)"

Metallica,335txf,Fapstronaut_TK_421,23,Sun Apr 19 20:51:17 2015 UTC,"I have been a fan of Metallica for 26 years, since I was 9.   And I have been a fan of Lou Reed for about 17 or so years.     I remember when the Lulu album was released, a friend joked that he thought I was somehow cosmically responsible for its happening.     Upon its release, I listened, and immediately understood a point that a LOT of people missed - the fact that it is first, and foremost a LOU REED album.  Metallica is just the band on that album.   And, like the albums that Lou had made before Lulu, it was a difficult, perplexing, challenging album.  If you've ever listened to his Edgar Allan Poe concept album, The Raven, you should know that Lou Reed was all out of fucks to give long before asking Metallica to make an album with him was even a thought.     Metallica have been all out of fucks to give for a long, long time, too.   We should all know that.   They do what they want, how they want, and they don't give a fuck who likes it.   Hell, Death Magnetic gets a lot of praise from some folks, but derided by others for being a ""give the fans the kind of Metallica album they want"" kind of album, but they still put ""The Unforgiven III"" on there, because why the fuck not?     Lou Reed and Metallica both definitely shared one common trait in their creative processes, and it's that they both have created art that baffled people upon its initial release, but as time went on, context was achieved, and the albums that were misunderstood at first, became ""beloved classics"".     Like that article said, nobody understood Lou's Berlin album when it was new, and it is now considered to be his masterpiece.    I feel the same about St. Anger.   I spent years bashing that album, but time makes a good lens through which to view art.   I love that album now.    In 25 years, people will hail Lulu as a masterpiece, and a brave decision for all involved.   And it already sounds better to my ears now than it did when it came out.    Metallica's riffs are UN. DE. NIABLE.    They sound like a bastard love hold of Scott Kelly and Tony Iommi.   Lou Reed sounds like a crazy person, and rightfully so.   He spent years abusing himself, and pushing the envelope as to what it means to be a musical artist.    Or they won't.   Who knows?      All I can say to sum up my thoughts on Lulu is that it's not as bad as people ripped on it as being, and it's not as good as Metallica and Lou hyped it up to be before its release, thereby guaranteeing that people could only be disappointed by it.    I like it."
Metallica,335txf,weirdmountain,15,Sun Apr 19 21:58:23 2015 UTC,"I think it's a terrible album. One of the worst ever, and I'd bet my balls that it will never be regarded as anything other than a train wreck, let alone a masterpiece. BUT, I have to say, that was excellently written."
Metallica,335txf,Strider_,5,Mon Apr 20 00:46:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   Yeah, man, who knows how time will view it?   But Lou's Berlin was panned, hard, when it was new.

Lulu..i just don't feel it. It has some monster riffs and some great lyrics..but i cannot get it to gel with my ears at all. Big part of the problem is i cannot stand Lou's voice.

The singer needs to practice his singing though. Sounds like he's sliding through the vocals rather than hitting each note.   Then there's the other guitarist humping his guitar like an autistic Justin Bieber. Plays great and do what you need to to get in the groove but I couldn't take it seriously.   10/10 for proficiency  7/10 for vocals  11/10 bassist was metal as fuck.

Had this been just any old band and they whipped this out, it would mean more to me.  Still, very good.  And yeah, the singer needs to be more clear and beef up his vocals. They just sounded muffled and thin. James just projects himself so well. When he sings it, you feel it."

For the most part, I thought they also recreated metallicas live tones, though some could have used a few tweaks to not sound so tinny.   Would have liked to hear a slightly dirtier mix. It was a little on the clean side."

Metallica,334rxv,MoBaconMoProblems,1 point,Sun Apr 19 15:24:49 2015 UTC,"You need to set your sound card to record ""what you hear"". Some old SoundBlaster cards (SB Live!, etc.) have this listed quite literally as a ""What U Hear"" mode -- IE: it records exactly whatever is coming from your speakers. Higher end professional level sound cards can do this naturally by being put into monitor mode whereby you feed that mode source signals from various channels, then you can record whatever those are. This can be a mix of live audio from mics as well as audio sources played from any mixing board or from the computer. It's handy because you can use this to record individual tracks from a 5.1 up to a 7.1 audio recording (like center channel only, or bass channel only), but it requires a sound card with dedicated drivers for all 8 channels. You will not find this with consumer level sound cards. Generally you need an ASIO card to have this functionality.     Your best bet is to find if your sound card can record from the ""what you hear"" mode. If not, you might be able to find some kind of driver that will hack this functionality into it. Barring that, you could try to feed the signal from your headphone jack in a loop back into the line-in of your card and record the line-in. Use a standard 1/8"" TRS cord (tip, ring, sleeve, colloquially known as a headphone jack) for this. This is a somewhat dirty hack though as it will force the audio signal through a DAC on the way out (headphone jack) then again through an ADC (line-in jack) on the way back in. And this will only work if the sound card can handle driving both the headphone jack and recording the line-in simultaneously."

I am curious though if they used the tape that I had personally.   See way back I found a tape labeled ""live Dallas"" it was said to be Jason's first show with the band in the U.S.    But when I popped it in the deck... I was shocked to find it was filled with demos from 82-83. When I did research I couldn't find any info about this tape.   It's got stuff with alt. lyrics and riffs from the ride album alt takes and the like.   So when Metallica said they where searching for stuff from the fans and collectors I mailed them the tape. Curious what they did with it."
Metallica,3317f5,Blasphyx,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:43:13 2015 UTC,"Hmm interesting...but I'm sure your tape is a bootleg copy of something already readily available.

Metallica,332fan,PopPop-Magnitude,6,Sat Apr 18 22:56:07 2015 UTC,Hetfeld's voice at this very moment in time is best suited to do kill em all style and load style vocals. His performance of metal militia in 2013 was mind blowing.

I had so many tapes of tapes of Metallica records, blown up at double speed on a dual deck or made with care from an LP, Metallica was first and foremost a tape band for me. $5.98 EP. Those boots of the early Lighting demos. For all their current absurdity, there's no denying the community aspect of tape trading that led to their success. Good on them for recognizing that and their fans with respect and good humor. I look forward to reliving my discovery of this band through the Blackened reissues."

I love bass heavy mixes.  I suppose with recording demo tapes back then, you wouldn't know if levels are too high until its too late. I could be wrong though.  EDIT: Huh weird...If you compare The Prince and Helpless, the bass isn't as overpowering on Helpless. I actually love how The Prince sounds there."

It's a bit jarring at first, but Load and ReLoad have some awesome riffs that are good start points. ""Cure"", ""Wasting My Hate"", and ""Attitude"" come to mind. Start from those then just kind of branch out and explore the albums as you see fit.  ""Bleeding Me"", ""Thorn Within"", ""The Outlaw Torn"", ""Bad Seed"", ""Prince Charming"", and ""Fixxxer"" are some of my personal favorites from those two.  As for St. Anger, go into it and look at it as a jam session. The lyrics aren't cringey, they're heartfelt and really convey the emotional situation James and the band as a whole were in at the time."

It was great when i was an angry teenager with a lot of aggression.. but as a grown as man, my musical taste has evolved beyond chugging the the open e on the 6th string... and why is my statement cringey? is trash metal the only genre of metal you know? do you find pantera cringey? the 80's/90s were over 20-30 years ago.. you people need to evolve."
Metallica,32vv1u,talktothehand00,4,Fri Apr 17 17:34:47 2015 UTC,"Wow... you are beyond narrow minded.   In my opinion 80s metal (specifically Metallica) is the best metal, for me.  In the 90s, I think Pantera and Slayer were my favorite metal sound.   Why the fuck do you think I need to change my musical preferences to something else just because what I like is a bit older?

Metallica,32skis,IvanGeJota,4,Thu Apr 16 11:14:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I kind of hope not.    I hope they just drop the album on us, with no real announcement.   When they do those things, it's like that friend or relative who shows you every ultrasound picture and gives twice-a-day updates about their pregnancy.     Don't get me wrong - I want more new Metallica as much as you do, but it's become a fact of life that they take forever to make new music.   We are now in the middle of the longest stretch between albums, and I think they know that the longer you make people wait, the more people expect some masterpiece-level shit.  And half the people are always going to bitch that Metallica in their 50s doesn't make music like they did in their 20s.     If they put out a new album next week, I'll buy it and love it.   If they don't put one out for another 3 years, I'll still buy it and love it.   I'm a lifer with Metallica.     You can't rush or force your art, and now that they are their own bosses, in terms of releasing albums, they can take as long as they like.   There is no label breathing down their necks demanding a new album (which I still think is the culprit behind St Anger being what/how it is)."
Metallica,32skis,weirdmountain,2,Thu Apr 16 13:39:44 2015 UTC,"I get your point but... I don't know... I love to see them doing crazy stuff in the studio, and those are not daily videos, they uploaded the Mission: Metallica videos and the Jump In The Studio videos whenever they wanted. Usually, between one and the next there were weeks without any update.  I don't know... I think they are just fun videos that everyone would appreciate and it would make us be more and more hyped about their new stuff. I just hope they make the videos, because this days I love to watch the old ones, and damn... I wish I had the same kind of videos about the recording of Kill'Em All, Ride, Master and Justice.  I'm not forcing them. I just think that'd be really cool for everybody."

Metallica,32hya5,Seppel270,7,Mon Apr 13 23:05:01 2015 UTC,"I've always associated Metallica a bit more with progressive metal than other thrash bands. It seems fitting that they would end up with longer tracks, which is basically a signature aspect of prog. There is more division of tracks into distinct sections, which invariably increases their lengths.  However, I don't actively listen to any other thrash, so maybe someone else has a better idea of how commonplace that is."
Metallica,32hya5,provi,3,Tue Apr 14 05:38:04 2015 UTC,"I think a good chunk of it has to do with lyrics. Then the next would be how many riffs a particular song has and how many times they want to hear it/feel comfortable with.  The music I compose usually ends up in the five minute range because I exclude lyrics completely. I imagine that if I had lyrics and a repeating chorus that it would likely add a few more minutes.  Not to mention solos, intro, and outro.   They do composition extremely well for the genre."
Metallica,32hya5,serosis,3,Tue Apr 14 04:46:14 2015 UTC,"It's pretty typical for the genre more so then just a Metallica thing. 4 minute songs are more of a pop thing, hence why most radio friendly songs fall in that time range."

Metallica,32hya5,DaveMcElfatrick,2,Tue Apr 14 02:51:55 2015 UTC,the reason why the songs are so long is because they have so much material.. think of a the movie Wolf of Wall Street. its a 3 hour movie because they couldnt decide where to chop stuff off to make it shorter. Metallica suffers from the same affliction..take a look at the frayed ends of sanity.. even james himself laughed at how long that song was
Metallica,32hya5,lukavago,2,Tue Apr 14 13:15:57 2015 UTC,On their last 2 albums theyre blatantly trying to make them longer by copy/pasting riffs together for way too long. Like All Nightmare Long. They took Shadows of the Cross and threw in a bunch of extra riffs for no reason other than to make it longer.   They seriously need a producer that will whip them into shape. But thatll never happen. Theyll just rick rubin come lay on a couch and eat burritos or whatever.
Metallica,32hya5,DaveMcElfatrick,3,Mon Apr 13 23:49:12 2015 UTC,"I do agree. In Death Magnetic they repeated the same barre for way too long on many songs, presumably in order to add length, but it didn't add anything. Compare this to say, the intro to Disposable Heroes. The halftime riff goes on for a while but new layers are added onto it, and it's great.   I do enjoy Death Magnetic, however it does have a couple of flaws in my opinion, this being one of them aside from production."

I personally like certain albums past Justice but just because other Metallica fans do not doesn't mean they're any less of a fan than me or vice versa. I get people like to protect their music but we're all different people with different tastes. Enjoy what you enjoy
Metallica,3297kz,moogie413,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:07:30 2015 UTC,"The thing that bothers me is that these people, who would call themselves fans, use the fact that they like the first four albums as protection when calling their new stuff shit. Instead of saying, oh you know, the more mature, ""it's not my type of music,"" they straight up say it's shit like it's a fact. It's not shit, it's music. You might not like it, and it may not be your taste of music, but plenty of people think it's genius and beautiful.  To clarify, I'm not asking for people to suck Metallica's dick. All I wish is that people be respectful, especially those who consider themselves fans. That's the frustrating part."

Metallica,3297kz,yodawg111,4,Sun Apr 12 13:58:24 2015 UTC,Well said. Load and Reload also have some of those most personal lyrics written by Hetfield. People don't seem to realise that if Metallica had just kept doing the same thing over and over again they wouldn't have done so well in the 90s and a lot of people would have never heard their music. People can have their own opinion but it's annoying when they keep saying the recent albums are all shit like it's a fact.

For the previously unreleased song, My Creation, he wrote this:   This was an unfinished song that Nick Menza wrote the main riff too and I finished for him.........Of course the first thing out his mouth when he heard it wasn't ""That's rad!"" It was ""You're gonna pay me, right?"" Some things will never change.    Grow up Dave"

James and Lars tried to downplay Daves contribution to the band after he was fired and said he was never a true member of Metallica and just a hired gun (lol some hired gun who wrote half the songs on their setlist while he was in the band)"

On each album you're mainly hearing James anyway. The main riffs he is turned way up and Kirk is turned down till his solo hits. I read once, that Load was the first album they let Kirk be heard on rhythm sections."
Metallica,31xzy9,guywoodman7,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:38:47 2015 UTC,"Almost, load and reload was the first time the let Kirk DO his own rhythm sections.

The Memory Remains and Devil's Dance are heavy, Unforgiven II is deep and kinda heavy, Better Than You is heavy. Slither, Bad Seed, Carpe Diem, Wild Things, Prince Charming are all good (to me) but they're more just stuff that I like to hear and can sing along to that are just kinda fluff stuff, if that makes sense. I like singing them but they're not anything special. Same with Attitude, I think. I love Low Man's Lyric and Fixxxer defined most of my high school life so I dig those but I can see others not caring much about the former.

Maybe the progression to this new record will be more like a post Black Album but not anywhere near as far along the line as Load.    I dunno man, I kinda always hoped they'd take Death Magnetic a bit further for the next record."
Metallica,31akot,xVocalTestx,2,Fri Apr 3 14:46:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, I've always believed that there should have been an album between Justice and the Black albums because you could hear the progression. But for some reason they ""skipped"" an album in that progression and I think that's why they got all the hate over the Black album."
Metallica,31akot,FailedAccessMemory,5,Sat Apr 4 06:45:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just want to hear more Death Magnetic.  That album was amazing.  ""Unique"" makes me nervous.  Like.. S&M, St. Anger, Lulu?  Haha every time they've tried to do unique it goes too far."
Metallica,31akot,450k_crackparty,15,Fri Apr 3 17:05:33 2015 UTC,S&M wasn't a studio album. And by itself it's still pretty amazing I think. It takes the epic feeling to a new level. Plus two new songs included.
Metallica,31akot,RKRagan,4,Fri Apr 3 20:50:38 2015 UTC,"I think Metallica has always done the unique thing. Fade to Black apparently sent the metal community into a frenzy, then expanding on that and having a lot of melodic songs.   Metallica isn't afraid to take risks, and I love that. Sometimes it pans out, like Black or S&M, and sometimes it doesn't, like Lars and the snare. But, part of what makes Metallica the best band ever is their willingness to experiment. A lot of the greatness we've got is from that experimentation.   P.S No Leaf Clover is God's gift to Earth."
Metallica,31akot,Orionator,3,Fri Apr 3 23:33:41 2015 UTC,"like Lars and the snare   My God is this true.. I've been listening to the Through The Never live album and Lars' fills are literally snare snare snare snare snare with the occasional tom tom tom CRASH. Then I go back to AJFA and can only ask myself: what happened?  Edit: If you're gonna downvote (whoever it was, not you OP. Unless it was you), then at least explain why you disagree. I love Lars as much as anyone else in the band, but it doesn't take much to see that his skills have obviously diminished. He still has his speed and energy, but his fills have gotten lazier and lazier over time. You have to be a really blind fan not to notice this."
Metallica,31akot,Orionator,2,Sat Apr 4 00:44:53 2015 UTC,"(I didn't downvote. I actually just up-voted to cancel out whoever the D-Bag was)  Yeah, I know what you mean. A lot of was Lars does now is pretty lazy. I actually don't have a huge problem with him in a lot of cases where others do. I think he did great in the Load era, for example, but for sure live recently has been iffy. By the snare drum I was especially talking about the awful sounding drums on St. Anger. Experimental, but by god did that not turn out well."
Metallica,31akot,Vickshow,2,Sat Apr 4 07:18:30 2015 UTC,"Yep. I actually really like Lars' playing on St.Anger. It's really, really powerful and sets the tone of the entire album perfectly. But that snare..   I'm really hoping Lars makes a change in his drum kit soon. Although it's a huge step up from St.Anger, I'm still not quite digging his drum tone. I think it might also have something to do with those drumsticks he uses (the ones that look like magician's wands lol). I play guitar, so I'm not really familiar with drums and sticks and what have you, so I could be miserably wrong, but his tone was so great back in the day when he used regular wooden drumsticks.   Oh well. Guess I'll just have to anxiously await the next album. I'm excited nonetheless."
Metallica,31akot,450k_crackparty,6,Sun Apr 5 02:51:05 2015 UTC,"S&M was and is an amazing live album. If you listen to it as it's own thing it works really well, and we got No Leaf Clover and an amazing version of Call of Ktulu out of it.   St. Anger is nowhere near as bad as people say; it's just very, very different from what people were used to. There are still some great, heavy songs on that album.   Lulu isn't a Metallica album, it's a Lou Reed album. The Metallica parts on it sounded pretty good, but when you added Lou Reed on top it started to just sound really bad. I can't remember the specific songs off the top of my head but there were a couple cool riffs on Lulu, even if the songs as a whole didn't work."
Metallica,31akot,Matthew94,3,Fri Apr 3 23:12:37 2015 UTC,"I can't disagree with any of the points you made there.  I was actually pretty into S&M when it came out, but to me it did not stand up to repeated listening.   Same with St Anger.   Didn't give Lulu much of a chance.  Death Magnetic I've listened to as much, or more than all of their albums.  I just want more of that.  Mad riffery, bangin solos, and aggressive, deep Hetfield, without too much YEAH YEAHHHHHHHHHssss (but some.. gotta have some).  To me that album was like a phoenix rising from the ashes."
Metallica,31akot,MoBaconMoProblems,5,Fri Apr 3 23:29:23 2015 UTC,"Like.. S&M, St. Anger, Lulu? Haha every time they've tried to do unique it goes too far.   Could be something like Fixxxer? Rock songs with a more ""out there"" vibe."
Metallica,31akot,androd25,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:12:35 2015 UTC,I hope so. Fixxxer is one of my all time favorites. I love the more organic style of playing that James and Kirk use.

Metallica,31akot,serosis,6,Fri Apr 3 15:39:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that Reed is an Icon, but he had no gas left in the tank on Lulu. It was painful to listen to, and it sucks because if the music could stand alone with out lyrics it'd be a great album. I know Metallica and Reed both stated this wasn't for fans of either, but for them, that being said, why release it?  Edit: Spelling, still trying to figure out how to use Swype."

Metallica,30hptl,JimBellious,9,Fri Mar 27 14:02:16 2015 UTC,"Not too long ago, somebody put up a posting of all the songs that Metallica has that they've never played live, and there was a good 2-3 ALBUMS' worth.     I'd love to see them decide on 5 or 6 ""staples"", like ""One"", ""Enter Sandman"", ""Master Of Puppets"", ""Creeping Death"", ""Seek And Destroy"", and ""Nothing Else Matters"" - the 5 or 6 that they kinda have to play, and of course they'll be in the set, because you have to please the radio listener who paid 100 bucks so he could say he saw Metallica - but then make sure that, across the next tour cycle, they also play every single song they have.   Get weird and break out some ""middle of Load or Reload"" songs...   Hell, they could do one half of each of their albums at every show, and mix it in with the rest of the set.   Across 20 or 30 dates, they could easily play every song that has ever been on a Metallica release.    They could mix in the Garage Inc songs, too, at one or two per show.   Could you imagine if they came back onstage and started an encore with ""Astronomy"", the ""Mercyful Fate"" or the ""Ronnie Rising"" medley?!?!  Or seeing a set where they played ""Fixxxer"", ""Slither"", ""The Judas Kiss"", and ""Sweet Amber"" all at some points in the same set?!     Yeah, it was cool to get to see them play ""Escape"" for the first (only?) time ever.   And it's awesome to know that they finally played ""Frayed Ends Of Sanity"".   Both ""historic"" moments...   BUT - they have a chance to make a whole tour where every night is something surprising and historic.   They could even debut new songs and new covers on such a tour.     Maybe they're having a hard time getting the new album finished because they play pretty much the same songs every time they play a concert.   If they started radically shuffling their set lists, I'd bet that the new album would come together a lot sooner, and it would probably be completely awesome."

Metallica,30hptl,BaldEagle88,6,Sat Mar 28 02:39:51 2015 UTC,"The thing about the ""rarities"" setlist is, people like me who have never been to a proper Metallica show want to see all those oldies some of us are sick of. I'd rather hear the songs that first got me into the band before I hear the less-famous stuff, if I had to pick.   For me, the ideal setlist would be 3/4 greatest hits and 1/4 rarities. More than anything, I want them to bring back multiple encores."

Metallica,30hptl,johnnygat2000,3,Tue Mar 31 02:09:59 2015 UTC,It was due to the masses/ bit-part fans who only voted for the Metallica songs they had heard of.    Who are also fans.
Metallica,30hptl,Matthew94,2,Sun Mar 29 18:56:29 2015 UTC,The reason they don't play those songs is because it would just be crickets in the audience. That's why their popular songs still get voted in because a lot of people going to the show are just casual fans.
Metallica,30hptl,crewdoughty,2,Sat Mar 28 06:00:30 2015 UTC,"I would love to see a list of all the fast exciting songs, Like Battery, Fight Fire with Fire, Dyers Eve, Motorbreath, Stone Cold Crazy, That Was Just Your Life, Through The Never, Disposable Heroes and stuff. Just all the fast and crazy ones to wreck the audience. Bands like Kreator are doing that and its amazing.   The reason they don't do a lot of the stuff you mentioned, is because it doesn't sell as well as the more popular stuff, and it isn't crazy enough. A lot of concert goers are young and want to go mental for a few hours."

This is pretty much my only complaint with them, however it makes total sense/ They play the songs that made them big enough to sell out the arena's they are playing in.  I dont know why they stopped doing ""melody's"" but those were great. I wish they had a bit more Phish in them in that they improvised more songs and changed them from the version on the record. For example the acoustic versions of All Within My Hands and Disposable Hero's are incredible."

I find it incredibly frustrating that instead of working on their next album they're taking time out of the recording process and doing the same festivals with the same songs every year. Load is my second favorite album behind Kill Em all, but I understand why they don't play songs from Load/Reload. People hated those albums, and they would sell out more arenas if they just ignored that period from the 90s."

I had the 'front line' window open in Chrome for a while, but a few minutes before 10 CDT I decided to open up an IE window as well. The IE window got me in around the 3 minute mark. I carted Sat/sun tickets and went through the payment process. It stayed on the 'purchasing' screen for 4 minutes before saying it could not be completed. I hit the pay button again and it worked and gave me confirmation.  The Chrome window finally got to the cart page after 30 minutes (I had just let it run) and by that time the Fri and Sun passes were all gone.   I would not have known about this had /u/kirkemg had not made the post. Thanks!"

(Justice For All.. tour)  I mentioned his stereo sounded flippin' awesome and was surprised when he flipped the top open to show me it was the vinyl playing.  He said Metallica spent the extra money to have the album span two discs so that it reproduced the sound properly.  To put it on a single vinyl, they would have had to 'compress' the grooves which would have lessened the sound quality.   edit: a word"

Metallica,3036dw,schmidtmike76,7,Tue Mar 24 16:48:16 2015 UTC,Clearly a dick move towards Jason.
Metallica,3036dw,clydefrog811,3,Tue Mar 24 13:58:07 2015 UTC,I thought this was common knowledge.
Metallica,3036dw,SleestakLightning,5,Tue Mar 24 15:37:35 2015 UTC,It should be. Jason did an interview some years ago where he spoke about the recording process of garage inc and how he just went in and did his parts and didn't give input into the mastering and mixing process. He thought Justice would be very similar which was how his prior band did its recordings. Justice was much more work intensive and serious than garage (obviously) and his lack of input led his portions to be pushed out. Consequentially Lars did the vast majority of the work with James whose parts are very prominent.
Metallica,3036dw,posam,2,Tue Mar 24 18:03:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I mean it's fairly obvious that the bass-less sound was intentional. Metallica had control over the mixing and the production so I'm not sure why this is such a stunning revelation.  I am a bass player but I LOVE the production of AJFA. I think it's perfect as is.
Metallica,3036dw,SleestakLightning,4,Tue Mar 24 18:17:46 2015 UTC,Is it not a bit petty to complain about something that happened 26 years ago?  Build a time machine and do something about it if you are so inclined to bitch.
Metallica,3036dw,serosis,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:09:40 2015 UTC,"I might me lhe only one who thinks this but the reason why i love so much ""...and justice for all"" is due to the lack of bass on the album"
Metallica,3036dw,puppetz666,-1,Tue Mar 24 19:10:07 2015 UTC,"For the reason that there are more guitars in the arraignment, sure, but Metallica's bass has never really factored into their songs. I can barely hear it in KEA, RTL...and if you get the isolated tracks, it's really weak. It's something I noticed when I would jump from Metallica to Motley Crue. Take Dr. Feelgood; it has a much, much thicker sound, because the bass was very prominent (but not overbearing to the rest of the song). Go back to Metallica and it sounds so thin in comparison.  I built guitar backing tracks out of the AJFA master tracks floating around, and working the bass into it, the songs sound so much better."
Metallica,3036dw,Testiculese,0,Tue Mar 24 19:28:42 2015 UTC,"In the Classic Albums doc Jason said something along the lines of ""I am as responsible for no bass on AJFA as anybody else"" also I think it was Kirk who said that , if he could, he'd like to redo AJFA from scratch.  Also there are some more comments from Jason on the matter..I am at work right now,but will check afterwards."
Metallica,3036dw,rd1994,0,Thu Mar 26 12:10:39 2015 UTC,I heard that the bass was mixed way down so that James's guitar tracks wouldn't get compressed so much.

Metallica,3036dw,aprilfool01,6,Tue Mar 24 10:02:12 2015 UTC,What are you referencing here? The fact that it should have been Lars who died instead of Cliff when their bus crashed? Because Cliff switched with Kirk.   Or are you referencing the fact that Lars was about to be kicked out of the band before Cliff died?   Are you talking about Lars's drumming on the album? That it should have been muted out?   Genuinely curious here! No sarcasm.

Metallica,3036dw,aprilfool01,2,Tue Mar 24 15:33:07 2015 UTC,This is referenced in A Year And A Half and Kirk has talked about the poker match that made them switch. I think it's AYAAH. Or maybe SKOM?  I'm on my phone so I can't check.

Metallica,302xfs,weirdmountain,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:13:33 2015 UTC,"For me, it's a case of liking a piece of art for what it is, and how it is, flaws and all.   I've been hearing it that way for 26 years now (I first heard/got that album in 1989), and it just is what it is.   I've heard mixes that people posted where they cranked up the bass from that Guitar Hero game, and that mix ends up having a lot of Master Of Puppets feel to it.     I've always said that if they ever decided to re-release it, with the bass tracks at an audible level, of course I'd buy and listen to it.   But, time does wonders for all of Metallica's albums, even St. Anger, which sounds better to me now than it did even 2 or 3 years ago.   Justice has a distinct feel and charm to its sound, and it's the way they wanted to release it.      Have you ever read the essay about the first four Metallica albums by Scott Kelly, from Neurosis?     It's pretty excellent."

In III at the end he says, ""So how can I blame you, when it's me I can't forgive?"" Before III it was some demon he's struggled with (the most public was alcohol.)  I feel that in III he's finally ready to move on from it. Yeah he's been sober for a while, but it was damaging overall."

Metallica,2zlu4w,RJB6,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:06:33 2015 UTC,Not particularly. I'm not sure how to do that. The idea of 8-bit music is something familiar to more people. I do enjoy all types of MIDI music but for this channel I think I'll stick to 8-bit. Uploading everything in both 16-bit and 8-bit would half the rate I can put a video out. I think I can find a way to get sound-card music like Roland etc.. onto any midi. I might take music that was originally 8-bit and revamp it into that. Thanks for the idea. :)

Their first book was a failure and mostly panned by fans -- this time around they're using sensational headline grabbing quotes to drum up business. Every mediocre blog that has picked up this interview uses the METALLICA HAS MADE NO MONEY SINCE 2010 line, and it's not only without a verifiable source or evidence, it speaks to the journalistic values (or lack-thereof) of Brannigan and Winwood.   It'd be nice if both of them would be open about their burned bridges with the band that led to the penning of both books, but I suppose that would sort of transparency would ruin it.

Metallica,2zgqyh,yodawg111,2,Thu Mar 19 21:13:34 2015 UTC,I think they should make it clear this is more about Metallica the brand/corporation than Metallica the band and the band members. The band members themselves aren't hurting for money...well maybe Rob...he said so himself when trying to get kickstarter funds for his documentary on Jaco. They're not going to be selling homes or auctioning off personal items. Yes they've made questionable finacial decisions in the last few years. Orion was great to go to but I'm sure from a money/production standpoint it could have been done better and more cost effective. Same thing goes for Through The Never. The new album will come out and people will either love it or hate it. It will probably sell decently and they'll do a huge tour as always and all will be good.

Only after listening to this album I truly became a fan & the day I heard this album i ran to my friends house to tell him how dark & great metallica is."
Metallica,2zbuem,benitin,4,Tue Mar 17 14:34:47 2015 UTC,"Spot on.. Seems we have a similar Metallica past.. I remember the goosebumps I got from this album. When I heard this album for the first time, I couldn't believe how amazing it was. For me, it's the greatest album in existence. I know many will disagree but it has made the biggest impact on my life. I got a lot better at the guitar because of this album. I was taking lessons and my sister bought me the tab book."

Metallica,2zbuem,G-42,2,Wed Mar 18 03:55:32 2015 UTC,"It was the album that made me a metalhead, instantly.  I'd only heard tiny bits of metal before; I even owned an Iron Maiden album, though never really felt passionate about it...AJFA was my first time discovering what I considered ""heavy"".  It was love at first note."

Metallica,2zbuem,weirdmountain,8,Tue Mar 17 15:27:15 2015 UTC,"After listening to it that way for the past 26 years (I first heard it in 1989), I'm so used to it that I can barely imagine what is would sound like mixed any other way.    That said, if they did reissue it, with beefed-up production, and audible bass, of course I'd buy it again and listen to it."
Metallica,2zbuem,prince_from_Nigeria,7,Tue Mar 17 14:02:09 2015 UTC,"the drums were too compressed IMO, that made the album sound ""mechanical"" and flat. also, no bass....  it's one of my favorites nethertheless."
Metallica,2zbuem,Testiculese,6,Tue Mar 17 09:28:15 2015 UTC,"I don't like the production, except for the lead and voice.  The bass drum is weak as shit. Take Hit the Lights, and play it back to back with any AJFA song on a good stereo. The difference is very obvious. Also, Lars put nickels or washers on the drum, and it blows out the bass, creating distortion that even an isobaric enclosure rumbles out. The compression just makes it worse.  Hetfield's guitar is too electronic, and too scooped. It's not very noticeable unless you're a guitarist, and if you get an isolated track, it really stands out. KEA's higher top end sound is much better. The guitar does give it a deeper, darker tone, however when I play the rhythm with a KEA/MOP hybrid tone, the light boost on the high-end brings out a better crunch.  The lack of bass guitar. Not that I noticed for years, since they laid guitars over each other, and that was what I was focusing on. I found those GH master tracks, and I assembled them (and cut the bass way down, it was so overpowered), and the songs sound so much better with it.  I'm just disappointed in the production quality, not hating on it. The guy who produced RATM should be the standard everyone strives for. That guy knew his shit."
Metallica,2zbuem,TheShinyOne,4,Tue Mar 17 12:36:14 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I appreciate it for what it is...but at the same time, I really wish they had done a BETTER job producing, so that the album itself could have been even better.  I think Kirk's solo's on this album are his best, though."
Metallica,2zbuem,terrynutkinsfinger,8,Tue Mar 17 15:59:59 2015 UTC,I like it too. I think the sound quality on kill em was worse.   I have my seat belt on braced for downvotes.

Metallica,2zbuem,my_clock_is_wrong,3,Tue Mar 17 07:50:14 2015 UTC,"Don't see why people downvoted you, but I think part of what makes Justice is the sound (same with every album really) so it would feel different with a different sound and might not have made the same impact as it did."
Metallica,2zbuem,dmol,12,Tue Mar 17 08:40:42 2015 UTC,I tend to agree. Justice has a sound and a feel to it and there was nothing about it from day one that made me question the mix.  In my mind:  KEA - raw thrash  Lightening - cold and icy  Puppets - thick and warm  Justice - industrial and mechanical
Metallica,2zbuem,mafu99,1 point,Tue Mar 17 09:05:00 2015 UTC,Great descriptions.
Metallica,2zbuem,my_clock_is_wrong,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:27:52 2015 UTC,"I feel like these descriptions are based on the perception each album cover gives off. Apart from KEM, i agree that this is easily described as raw thrash. But it seems like the other descriptions are based primarily on the album art (and to a degree the music videos - One for example), and not necessarily the sound."
Metallica,2zbuem,KMAsKorner,4,Tue Mar 17 22:03:49 2015 UTC,"These are just my own opinions though. Having said that, my reasonings are:  RTL - For me the cold breezy intro to Ktulu permeates the album. That is to say when listening to the album in order, the intro to Ktulu isn't out of place. The other songs have either a sound or theme that gives me a cold, icy feeling (e.g. trapped under ice) and a feeling of distance and loneliness.  MOP - The mix is a lot thicker. there's more low end and guitars are a lot chunkier. It's a much warmer and more mature sound than KEA or RTL.  AJFA - The lack of bass in the mix makes it sound mechanical. Can't explain it otherwise. It's both crunchy but has a lot of mids and high end. James' riffing is honed and percussive and Kirk's soling is on fire after some lessons from Satriani.   Anyway, that's my personal feelings about the first 4 albums."
Metallica,2zbuem,AXL434,1 point,Wed Mar 18 03:19:16 2015 UTC,"I remember my radio station previewed the album on Sunday, before the release I think on Tuesday, and I recorded it off the station. My first reaction was, the drum tracks aren't done yet and where is the bass. The music was great but the sound wasn't. I gave the tape away and bought the album a few months later.   I always thought that having so many guitars is hard to mix and eq properly but they missed severely on that drum sound and no one in the band wanted the new bassist, Jason, to be heard."
Metallica,2zbuem,serosis,1 point,Tue Mar 17 11:23:57 2015 UTC,"To me the drums have more of a clicking than a thud sound when compared to other albums.  The guitar tone is very scooped with the bass essentially inaudible.   It's a matter of taste, sure, there's nothing inherently wrong with it.  To me it sounds too hollow and unfinished."
Metallica,2zbuem,Strider_,1 point,Tue Mar 17 12:55:13 2015 UTC,I do not know where I heard this but it was said that Lars put a half dollar coin where the kicker hits the drum so that it would click.  But I have no citation other than shoddy recall of an article I probably read 10 or so years ago.
Metallica,2zbuem,Blasphyx,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:23:33 2015 UTC,"Aside from the albums all being classic, Metallica never really had good production outside of the black to garage inc. era. I don't feel like it brings any of the albums down though, even justice. They all sound pretty individual. But if justice and puppets had the black album sound, that'd be pretty damn cool."
Metallica,2zbuem,TerrrorTwlight,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:57:35 2015 UTC,"I never understand how people can say Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets has bad production...   But I guess complaints towards Kill Em All makes more sense, cause what other raw Metal album has the majority of Metallica fans heard?  Almost any person familiar with Metallica is familiar with Seek and Destroy, and there's a large demographic in there of people who don't listen to anything else like Metallica.  The ""problem"" is not in production, but just a raw guitar tone. As in, that's how they want their guitar to sound. Production is just bringing the tracks together in a way that lets all the tracks sound good together without interfering with eachother's soundscape. Mixing and Mastering is production... Changing James and Kirk's amp settings is NOT production. At the time, this tone is where (extreme)Metal was. Trebley Marshal Noise. People who dislike KEA's sound wouldn't be able to handle Exciter's Heavy Metal Maniac.  Sound quality is subjective, but let's pretend Metallica had a less crunchy, cleaner guitar tone in the 80s. It could sound similar to Judas Priest at the time. One can say the sound quality is pretty good. Now we change the amp settings to what Metallica used. Nothing changed in the recording studio, all that changed was the amp. So the recording capabilities have not been affected and the studio still records at that same high standard.  If anything, I'm sure we can all agree that Lars' drums sound great on their first 3 albums...first 4 if you like the drum tone on AJFA."

Robert is a fine bassist (probably better technically than Jason), but I repeatedly ask myself what has Robert brought to the band and the answer is always ""nothing."" In over 10 years, he hasn't contributed anything of note to the band's history. Even his bass ""solos"" are unmemorable to say the least, not to mention he's been doing the same shit (detuning the E-String) for at least 5 years now.   Contrasted with Jason, who immediately changed the band's style and writing and gave us some awesome tunes (and bass lines). Credit Bob Rock with some of the changes, but I listen to songs like My Friend of Misery, God that Failed, Until It Sleeps, etc, and I it really makes me miss Jason.

I learned how to build websites soon after. Just how many websites do you think existed back then? Not to mention how many Metallica websites do you think existed back then? Now I may of not been the first Metallica website, but definitely I was part of the first group of Metallica sites. There were a bunch of us pre-teens making these websites...

Metallica,2yu01m,TristanCorb,4,Thu Mar 12 20:20:41 2015 UTC,"Low Man's Lyric since it ends abruptly on its own already and is nice and mellow near the end. And if you like Justice so much (one of my favs as well) try listening to the ""added bass"" version. It's well known James and Lars turned down Jason's bass for that record but with Guitar Hero Metallica, the original mix with the bass at normal volume is used and someone took that and put it online. Blackened sounds particularly sick with audible bass. Check it out and let me know what you think. Cheers!"
Metallica,2yu01m,iamgrrroot,2,Thu Mar 12 20:45:05 2015 UTC,"That's not the ...And Justice For Jason version is it? If so, I've heard it, but they made the mistake of turning the bass too loud that it just drowns out the guitars badly. I'll try the Guitar Hero version though, thanks for the suggestion!"
Metallica,2yu01m,Testiculese,2,Thu Mar 12 21:06:19 2015 UTC,"Yea, someone took the bass and didn't drop it down from the master volume. I can see why they cut it out of the album, it was way too strong.  When I build my backing tracks for guitar, I cut he bass by 50% and it was just about perfect."
Metallica,2yu01m,serosis,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:19:01 2015 UTC,...And Justice for Jason was someone who recorded their own bass according to the tablature books.  It was never the original bass tracks.

Metallica,2yu01m,r2o,3,Fri Mar 13 18:40:35 2015 UTC,"It's actually something they employ in a few different songs.  Not necessarily from one song to the next, but within the song itself.  I think I remember talking about it at some point.   That instead of playing harder and harder, to use some softer stuff and let the dynamic difference create the effect.  Battery - acoustic intro,   Fight Fire With Fire - very melodic intro, Blackened, One - starts soft and builds toward the ending, Fade to Black,  Sanitarium etc.."
Metallica,2yu01m,mamoorlook,3,Thu Mar 12 23:44:54 2015 UTC,"To me, personally, Justice is their best album. Even better than Black. I like everything about it. Even the sound, that many people take a shit on, is badass. But the songwriting is masterful."

This to me is what Metal is about, bands with awesome talent and a unique sound, very much like the early Rock and Metal bands. They're not as heavy as most Metal bands today and I like that, it seems like people think Metal should be all scream and growl so you can't understand the lyrics and guitars so low the notes are indistinguishable, I've heard people refer to Metallica as a rock band because they still play in E standard or E flat, no, Metallica are Metal.   This band has the talent and heart that music is lacking today, I also watched some live videos people have taken and they look like they put on one hell of a show, I hope to see these guys go far in the future. All in all brilliant band and I will definitely check out all their music and most likely buy their CD's if I see them. Also, thanks for this post, I love finding new bands to listen to."

Others say he has relapsed into painkiller addiction or something similar.

Metallica,2ym68a,dpprace,25,Tue Mar 10 23:26:20 2015 UTC,"Its mostly the drum that a lot of people hate. Lars detuned the snare and so it sort of sounds like a trashcan.  It also isn't nearly as polished as most of their other albums. Nor were there any solos. Basically, it doesn't actually sound like ""Metallica"" if you think about Metallica being their original thrash. It's different. And is why a lot of people hate it, as well as Load and ReLoad.  Personally, I fucking love it."
Metallica,2ym68a,earthwormjim91,2,Tue Mar 10 23:17:33 2015 UTC,"It's not actually detuned, it's just that he removed the snare so it's like a metallic tom. The snare are metal wires that go on top of the resonator head which is thin and makes that metallic sound, in St. Anger he ""removed"" it with the lever the snare has to deactivate it."

I apologize if I hold the guys to a higher standard, but they have proven time and time again that they're capable of better better writing than this. I seriously would like to challenge all of you to find a more ridiculous Metallica lyric than these examples.  (No, ""Whiskey in the jar-o"" doesn't count. They didn't write that.)"

This is the only song from the entirety of the SA recordings that I can listen to regularly...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dsP_EEEM_Y"
Metallica,2ym68a,Stop_Rock_Video,2,Wed Mar 11 00:12:01 2015 UTC,"I think that that's letting the Metallica brand get in the way. It certainly isn't a great album by any means, but it isn't worthy of all the hate that it gets. As a stand alone, its pretty cool and fun to blast."
Metallica,2ym68a,earthwormjim91,2,Wed Mar 11 00:21:14 2015 UTC,"I think there is some truth to that. I think I might have enjoyed it more, even for a short time, if it had been released by another band. (Sort of like how I enjoyed Disturbed in their time of popularity)  And it may be unfair to hold Metallica to a higher standard than other bands based on their history, alone. Again, I'm not saying it's a bad album, necessarily. But, unlike most of their albums, SA is the only one I can't listen to on a regular basis. There's just too much that bugs me about it, speaking personally.   If you enjoy it, excellent. More power to ya. I'm not judging you. I'm just explaining why it doesn't work for me and many others."

Metallica,2ym68a,Roqua99,1 point,Wed Mar 11 10:01:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not put off by the lack of solos. On many songs I feel like its the lyrics, but most importantly its the drum snare sound like you say. I really like that metallica is different on every album, makes them less stale. I love load, reload and garage just as much as I love kill em all, puppets and justice. St.Anger has its merits as well. Ive listened to it quite a lot. It's just the one I like the least because its hard on the ears after a while (because of that stupid drum. What was Lars thinking)"
Metallica,2ym68a,Skjalg,0,Wed Mar 11 09:17:22 2015 UTC,"I like it.

Metallica,2ym68a,Hetstaine,14,Wed Mar 11 05:11:57 2015 UTC,"-Lazy songwriting (understandable because all the Hetfield situation): mediocre riffs, excessive repetition, too long songs with no purpose, bad lyrics, etc  -No solos. In general, trying to get into the whole nu metal trend of those years  -Poor production (Don't know if there was actually any)  I dont even care about the snare sound, it was the last of the problems with that album"
Metallica,2ym68a,MyDinnerWithZoidberg,5,Tue Mar 10 23:37:59 2015 UTC,"A lot of the lyrics came out because they tried opening up the songwriting to the rest of the band. Kirk can write solos, but good god he can't write lyrics to save his life."

Metallica,2ym68a,weirdmountain,6,Thu Mar 12 14:14:31 2015 UTC,"It's an album that gets better with time.   Hell, if you are 17, that means you were probably around 5 when that album was released, so you're hearing it with different ears than old heads like me (I was 23 when St Anger was released).    When that album was new, I was just thrilled for new Metallica, period.   For perspective, their previous proper album before St Anger was released before or around the time you were born.   I disliked St Anger for years for all the reasons people say - production values, lack of solos, drum sound, lyrics...  I always said that the album's main fault lies in that there are curse words everywhere that there should be guitar solos.     I've really come around on St Anger in the past few years though, because of all of its flaws.   I like that it is a very imperfect album, but they were proud enough of the statement they made to release it, warts and all.   It also helps to listen to it on vinyl, where the album is broken up across four sides.   You get an intermission between every three songs or so, and it's a lot less of an onslaught to listen to that album as 4 20-minute sections than one huge 80-minute wall of confusion, therapy sessions, and rage."
Metallica,2ym68a,spoonard,4,Wed Mar 11 03:56:55 2015 UTC,Lyrically it's terrible. That damn snare pinging in EVERY song. The guitars sound so rough. Very few guitar solos.  The songs are uninteresting and longer than they need to be. These all sound like songs that were not even ready to be born yet. They needed much more polish and refinement.
Metallica,2ym68a,sebaimans,2,Wed Mar 11 01:07:19 2015 UTC,"It was the first album that got me to like them. But when going back to it after listening to all other songs, it just feels cheap, bad quality recording, james voice sucks, drums sound horrible, no solos of course. It just seems rushed, like they had to put something out so lets put some leftover riffs and add some shit on top it and there you go. The Some Kind of Monster movie definitely explains why the album was done so bad."
Metallica,2ym68a,RyanThePatriot,2,Fri Mar 13 13:19:37 2015 UTC,"About the lyrics, they're all understandable. I mean, watch SKOM. They talk about the rehab, their record label, etc."
Metallica,2ym68a,justo316,2,Wed Mar 11 01:19:32 2015 UTC,"When you compare it to every other Metallica album, it falls short (easily IMO). Sorry, but with a finite catalogue, something has to come last."
Metallica,2ym68a,yodawg111,2,Wed Mar 11 02:39:04 2015 UTC,"Horribly tuned snare. It could've sounded good with a weird tune, but it was just too noisy. There's parts of the album where I just visualize Lars randomly hitting everything on his kit.   Guitar tuning. Least of the problems with the album. I didn't mind the tuning until I heard the album with standard tuning and now it's hard to go back (Frantic riff will always sound killer).  Lyrics were ok sometimes but were cringeworthy more than not.   The lack of solos doesn't bother me, but the song length does. The songs just drag on and on forever. Some Kind of Monster feels like a 15 minute song to me.   Every problem except the lyrics is fixed by these guys though"

I was having a bad day today so I went to the gym and blasted this album.  I was jamming out!  It was such a great release while lifting weights.  I was tapping along to the drums and mouthing lyrics."
Metallica,2ym68a,thegreenvalley,1 point,Wed Mar 11 01:59:15 2015 UTC,Multiple things for me. The snare was just an awful idea and ruins every single song for me. And no jt wasn't detained as someone noted he simply turned the snares off of the snare drum. No clue why. It sounds awful.   The general production quality is horrible. I don't by the 'going for a raw sound' bit. Garage inc had a raw sound but still was produced well.   I can be open minded enough to deal with the no solos but Jesus every song on the record needs about 2 minutes or more edited out. Choruses repeated too many times in almost every song. It would flow better with solos( ie death magnetic has long songs and is great imo) but without them these songs need to be shorter.   If you want to hear st anger in a slightly better state grab the dvd audio. They packaged a dvd of them playing all the tracks live in the rehearsal room and it sounds way better than the actual album.
Metallica,2ym68a,nbohr1more,1 point,Wed Mar 11 02:20:40 2015 UTC,"Too derivative. They were trying to do something sorta groove oriented like NuMetal and seemed to just retread a lot of stoner rock meets Faith No More type material. Hetfield can't and shouldn't rap yet here we have him sorta veering in that direction. At least when Slayer put out a sorta groove metal album they still sounded pretty Slayer-esq and knew how to play to their strengths with that sound. St Anger was crock full of failed experiments in genres that Metallica have no aptitude for. If they wanna do out there stuff, they should do more punk. Garage Inc. clearly shows they are as good a punk band as a metal band."
Metallica,2ym68a,smulverine,1 point,Wed Mar 11 03:45:50 2015 UTC,"Production is production.    But it's about songs.  Metallica can record for 10 years or they can squeeze a song through production in a few hours, but you'll always know whether it's a good song or not.    And on St. Anger there is only 'Sweet Amber' and 'The Unnamed Feeling' and maybe parts of 'Some Kind Of Monster' that should have made it to a Metallica album.   Rest of it is therapy for them and should never have made its way out of the studio."

Metallica,2ym68a,ryangt47,1 point,Wed Mar 11 10:12:09 2015 UTC,"The only problem I had with St.Anger were that some of the songs were way too long for no purpose, usually ballads are long because of some intricate music with good long solos, but in this albums case, it was just repetitive riffs with shitty lyrics. If they made the songs shorter which would go with no solos, it would have been much better. Also if it had better lyrics.  I loved some of the riffs in most of the songs, just that it didn't build on top of that.I still like St.anger for what it is, just that it would have been great with a little bit more work."
Metallica,2ym68a,stomp224,1 point,Thu Mar 12 04:07:34 2015 UTC,"for me;  1) The arrangements are terrible. Clearly a result of them using Pro tools. In SKOM there are many shots of Lars editing, and they are just copy/pasting parts ad infinitum. It really sounds like a 'digital' album in that respect  2) James' vocals. There is a rawness that is cool, but he also goes off-key almost continuously, and for a band that has prided itself on pristine production, it's quite jarring.  3) the drum sound. Yes, that God awful snare. You can hear the snare skin ringing throughout the album ( and as a result, hear the bad edits of the above mentioned copy/pasting.)  However, it does have its merits. I do like several songs off St. anger, and I have a great deal of respect that the band even released it, as it is very uncharacteristic on almost every level."

St anger, for me feels like a failed attempt to get back to the same style and sound of their first few albums (my favourite ones). It may have something to do with transitioning from the horse-shit load/re-load albums towards the more Metallica sounding death magnetic.   Just my personal opinion, I understand everyone likes what they like and dislikes what they dislike."

Metallica,2xh8ev,benitin,3,Mon Mar 2 21:14:20 2015 UTC,"This is pretty cool. I'm only one song in, so this opinion may change, but my first thought is that the snare drum is too loud. Not by much... I'm not familiar with the GH stuff. Do you have access to each drum track on its own? Or just the entire drum-kit track as a whole? If you only have the whole drum track, then there is not much that can be done. But if the snare came down like -2dB, or maybe even -1.5dB, I think it would ride perfectly.    Still.. this is pretty sweet. Thanks!.. You can actually hear a dynamic, pummeling bass sound. Jesus fuck, what has Metallica done? lol"
Metallica,2xh8ev,DarkDeity9194,2,Mon Mar 2 02:22:35 2015 UTC,"yeah it came with kick, snare, toms, cymbals all separate, so it's on me.  now that you mention it, it does feel a little too loud lol.  I think I might redo that track cause it's just gonna bug me now."
Metallica,2xh8ev,DarkDeity9194,3,Mon Mar 2 02:31:12 2015 UTC,"The other thing I am noticing is that the timing in between tracks is all over the map. Part of mastering is giving the listener an adequate break in between songs. The break in between Broken, Beat & Scarred and The Day That Never Comes is barely a quarter of a second long. This is a huge mastering no-no. At the end of The End of The Line, there is like 10 or 12 seconds of silence. That is usually way too long.    Typically you want maybe 4-5 seconds in between tracks, but obviously you can bend those rules. The first that comes to mind for me is the delay in between Wreath and Deliverance on Opeth's Deliverance album. Wreath closes out and before you can even catch your breath and go ""fuck..."", Deliverance smashes you in the face with full force. There is a bit of an artistic touch to track spacing, you have to be mindful of the mood that the previous song sets upon the listener as it segues into the next track, as well as the overall effect/mood you are trying to achieve with the transition."
Metallica,2xh8ev,HaaanyeWest,2,Mon Mar 2 02:42:59 2015 UTC,"Also, there is something going on with All Nightmare Long...    When the song kicks in and you can hear James yell ""One! Two!"", that part is way too loud to me. Part of the charm of that part on the album, is that it seems ""pulled back"", like you are hearing James turn his head from the mic and yell at Lars. If it's up front that loud, the effect is lost. Also, when he sings ""Luck... runs... out..."" there is some crazy vibrating effect going on with his voice... just me, but it does not sound good at all.

Metallica,2xasbq,autobioofamexican,2,Fri Feb 27 03:13:39 2015 UTC,Good point. I've seen a lot of patches for sale; seems like a fun project.
Metallica,2xasbq,DanTheMan_622,7,Fri Feb 27 03:26:05 2015 UTC,"You'll most likely have to make one, i've never seen one for sale unless you can find someone on etsy or a similar site that makes and sells jackets/vests.  I recommend checking out the sub r/battlejackets, you can see what others have made and post asking for help/advice. I'm working on two different jackets and I think it's been a fun project to work on in my spare time. Just listen to music and sew away. It's highly personal, and it feels great when you wear it to a show and get compliments for it knowing that you did all the work into making it look awesome.  Here's a link to mine if you want to check them out for some ideas"
Metallica,2xasbq,DanTheMan_622,1 point,Fri Feb 27 04:57:31 2015 UTC,"That's awesome that there's a sub for it, I'll definitely check that out. Just wondering, where did you get the actual jackets?"
Metallica,2xasbq,dr_oog,2,Fri Feb 27 15:12:56 2015 UTC,"I found my dark blue jacket in a clearance bin at a clothing store for like $12 and the light blue one at a thrift store for about $6. Thrift stores are definitely your friend when it comes to finding jackets, but if you're looking for something really specific (like the black denim james has) you'd have to go online. Just cut the sleeves off and you're good to go!"
Metallica,2xasbq,luis138,5,Fri Feb 27 15:46:41 2015 UTC,"I may sound like an old man (probably because I am) but dude, make that shit. No need for advice or suggestions, just throw on some patches of bands that you actually like."
Metallica,2xasbq,SlaughterMeister,2,Fri Feb 27 07:04:24 2015 UTC,Found patches for a few of my favorites on Amazon. Guess it's time to break out the iron!
Metallica,2xasbq,Kmkrystian,2,Fri Feb 27 15:10:54 2015 UTC,Wasn't that vest stolen or did James recuperate it?
Metallica,2xasbq,ganon56,1 point,Fri Feb 27 04:13:22 2015 UTC,recover
Metallica,2xasbq,The_Joellercoaster,2,Fri Feb 27 23:27:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, they normally go by the name of ""battle jacket"". Research them to see different styles. I got a worn Levi's jacket already with no sleeves. Adding patches for nearly a year now.  Do it. It's so satisfying."
Metallica,2xasbq,Waiting_for_Merlot,2,Fri Feb 27 15:43:15 2015 UTC,I actually just made a battle jacket myself and it cost quite a bit if you buy it all at once (I think I spent over $200 for patches and a jacket). But its quite easy to make if you are even slightly competent at sewing.  Also /r/battlejackets exists can't link on mobile

Metallica,2x6v8g,king_walnut,2,Thu Feb 26 15:56:11 2015 UTC,Depends what the source material was recorded on. Take a look at the HD remaster of Friends ...that looks incredible.
Metallica,2x52l7,delta0062,20,Wed Feb 25 18:54:42 2015 UTC,I don't see the appeal of asking Metallica to lip sync a show and be surrounded by 4 hours of commercials.  Frankly it sounds like the worst idea for a Metallica show ever.
Metallica,2x52l7,G-42,-6,Wed Feb 25 19:31:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna lie, I mostly agree with you. BUT I think there could be a chance they could work something out that wasn't lip syncing and that would be AWESOME. That would expose millions of people who may or may not really know Metallica to them and potentially gain more fans..."
Metallica,2x52l7,guywoodman7,9,Wed Feb 25 19:46:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think Metallica is hurting for anymore fans. If they weren't selling out every show they play then sure they can use the extra exposure. I love Metallica, but I certainly don't give a rats rear if they play super bowl or not. Would much rather them focus on touring and recording."
Metallica,2x52l7,JHallComics,3,Wed Feb 25 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I just want them to play more US shows. I have been wanting to see them, but they're always in Europe and south america."
Metallica,2x52l7,98satsl1,3,Wed Feb 25 20:18:33 2015 UTC,"I don't care if they play the super bowl but I think the appeal is to have an actually good half time show, which metallica could definitely do. Then again that's only if those in charge get rid of the lip synching bullshit."
Metallica,2x52l7,mawisu,6,Wed Feb 25 23:15:09 2015 UTC,"I would love to see metallica play at half time and so would a lot of other people, but if you play metal during an event that is already a ""male majority,"" how would they reach other demographics?"
Metallica,2x52l7,fdredcap,2,Wed Feb 25 20:00:09 2015 UTC,The Super Bowl already appeals to more than just the 18-54 male demo. How many women and non-sports fans do you know watch the game JUST for the commercials? I'll bet it's a lot.
Metallica,2x52l7,mawisu,3,Thu Feb 26 01:00:14 2015 UTC,"Fuck the demographics, this football, blood, sweat and tears, bbbbbbbboooooooooommmmmmm"

Metallica,2x52l7,Vickshow,6,Thu Mar 5 03:52:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even want them to,to be honest because the people running the show would just add some Shit artist like lorde or Bruno mars type artist on stage with then.  just like when the red hot chili peppers played last year, rhcp played 1 song and then Bruno mars took over. I don't want some today's top 40 person to think they are better than metallica because they never will be"
Metallica,2x52l7,weirdmountain,9,Wed Feb 25 19:15:07 2015 UTC,"Bruno Mars ""took over"" because it was his halftime show. RHCP were only there as guest performers."
Metallica,2x52l7,Excalexec,5,Wed Feb 25 21:18:42 2015 UTC,"I think Metallica has waaaaaay more clout than the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and their management would never allow that to happen.   There would be some phone book contracts that would make sure their performance would be THEIR performance.     (edit:) REAL artists don't get their performances tampered with.   The Rolling Stones were legit when they did it a few years back, and Prince's performance was off the wall.   That guitar solo he ripped during ""Purple Rain"" was probably the finest moment in all Super Bowl Halftime Show history."
Metallica,2x52l7,weirdmountain,1 point,Wed Feb 25 19:33:48 2015 UTC,what about when that asian pianist played with metallica during the 2014 grammys. that was pretty bad.
Metallica,2x52l7,Dakota66,1 point,Wed Mar 4 04:10:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but not Bruno Mars-bad.   It was an attempt to be artsy, and that has been a Metallica goal forever.    And it was also the Grammys.   They're just an awards show to remind normal people that musicians are still making albums, and Metallica probably only performed on there to remind normal people that ""hey!   We're still around too!"""
Metallica,2x52l7,john11wallfull,3,Wed Mar 4 04:29:05 2015 UTC,"To add to all of the people saying that it was Bruno Mars's halftime show, RHCP were actually invited by Bruno Mars.  I do understand your reasoning, however."
Metallica,2x52l7,serosis,2,Thu Feb 26 11:46:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, so you are one of those people that dismiss all artists because they are popular?  You can't justify calling either Lorde or Bruno Mars shit. Bruno actually killed it with his drum solo a couple years ago. And yeah he took over the show, because it was his show. RHCP were guests.  You have to be closed minded to not want to see what kind of performance Metallica can create with another great artist."
Metallica,2x52l7,yodawg111,5,Wed Feb 25 21:36:07 2015 UTC,Why?  In all probability if they were to get the gig they would be forced to play either Enter Sandman or Fuel.  There would be no point unless they debuted a new song.

Metallica,2wulz8,adamgent,4,Mon Feb 23 10:26:56 2015 UTC,I thought it was a missed opportunity that they didn't play Fade to Black and Low Man's Lyric.  They would be perfectly suited for S&M.

Metallica,2ws8ms,shroobs,36,Sun Feb 22 18:58:54 2015 UTC,It really depends on what kind of music you are into. I'd say The Black Album is the safest bet since it appeals to the widest audience. If you enjoy thrash go with Master of Puppets.   For what it's worth my favorite album is Justice.

Metallica,2ws8ms,unholy_savior,11,Sun Feb 22 19:39:20 2015 UTC,I asked this same question to a friend back in high school and he decided to let me borrow every CD. But I could only borrow them in chronological order and couldn't get the next till I was finished with the previous. This was before the time of major pirating and online streaming. Personally I loved getting to experience their growth over time and I recommend this approach to anyone who is uninitiated.
Metallica,2ws8ms,Dakota66,7,Sun Feb 22 19:34:39 2015 UTC,"I listened to ...And Justice for All and Ride the Lightning first, but I recommend giving songs second chances. There were a few songs that didn't catch my attention the first time I heard them, then months later became my favorite songs."
Metallica,2ws8ms,decytv,6,Sun Feb 22 19:40:08 2015 UTC,I preferred the start from Kill Em All and go through them chronological.  You'll see how they changed and improved.
Metallica,2ws8ms,MoBaconMoProblems,4,Sun Feb 22 21:31:58 2015 UTC,"Another option is to listen to a ""best of"" mix rather than trying to go through a whole album. The albums are stylistically different and each have good songs and poor songs. It would be unfortunate to be turned off to Metallica because you didn't like the style of a particular album.  If I were to suggest a mix of their more popular songs, it would look like this (This is by no means my opinion on what the best songs are. It's just a sampling from all of their albums.):   Master of Puppets Enter Sandman One Seek and Destroy Fuel Fade to Black All Nightmare Long Sad But True Creeping Death Blackened The Call of Ktulu Until it Sleeps So What No Leaf Clover For Whom the Bell Tolls Frantic  King Nothing Broken Beat and Scarred Leper Messiah The Memory Remains Turn the Page The Unforgiven   ""Turn the Page"" and ""So What"" are covers, but they give you a taste of the double CD cover album, which, imho, was pretty awesome.  I got into them as a freshman in college back in '99, when I got the Black Album and S&M for Christmas.  From there are gravitated to Load and Reload because they felt more current than the old stuff. However, S&M and live show bootlegs got me into the older stuff over the next few years.  Currently I love every album equally (except for St. Anger, which should burn in hell) and will regularly listen to any of them straight through.  I'd say either start with a best of playlist like the one above, or go with the album that has more of the songs you already like on it, and just follow your tastes from there. Don't ever feel pressured that you have to like/dislike certain albums because ""that's what all the other Metallica fans do.""  Fuck 'em.  Like what you like, and everyone who rides your case for it can go to hell. And that, my friend, is an attitude the band would be proud to find in its fans."
Metallica,2ws8ms,yodawg111,5,Mon Feb 23 02:01:09 2015 UTC,This is a really great guide. I'd replace Turn the Page with Whiskey in the Jar or Am I Evil.

Metallica,2ws8ms,Paincakes,5,Mon Feb 23 06:09:19 2015 UTC,Black album piqued my curiosity.  Master of Puppets had my attention.  Kill em All sealed the deal.

Metallica,2ws8ms,thetaimi,4,Sun Feb 22 22:27:34 2015 UTC,"Definitely Master of Puppets!  Then revisit the older albums from there, before delving into And Justice For All.  If you really want to get the essence of Metallica, you must start well before the Black album."

Metallica,2ws8ms,timbo4815,8,Sun Feb 22 19:14:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. If you're new to metal or Metallica start with black and if you like it or even if you don't, because theyre so stylistically different, work your way backwards and check out ...and justice for all and master of puppets as well. Puppets and justice are faster and the production is a little thinner, but that's when the bad was at their peak."
Metallica,2ws8ms,TripleM88,3,Sun Feb 22 20:01:45 2015 UTC,"I have to second this, it was the album that opened the floodgates to the band.  Plus it's a good cross between their old style and their new style but I suggest going backwards to the first album first and after go forward from the black album to load and so on."
Metallica,2ws8ms,G-42,3,Sun Feb 22 20:14:04 2015 UTC,"If you're relatively new to the metal genre I'd suggest to start with the album that probably has the most mainstream appeal, which would be the self-titled 1991 album (also known as the black album). If you're already familiar with a few other metal bands and you already like the heavier and faster stuff, Ride The Lightning (1984) and Master Of Puppets (1986) are the albums to go."

Metallica,2ws8ms,andenz,1 point,Wed Feb 25 20:45:34 2015 UTC,"Idk where to start for me... I was 16 when Load came out. So naturally I started there.  I then quickly learned of the rich history the band had and worked my way backwards. Of course I had heard stuff off the black album as a kid. MTV use to play Unforgiven 15 times a day. When I bought Justice I was blown away... Almost like whoa is this the same band? I will sum it up...  Kill Em All - low budget production. Almost tin can recording. A very young band with raw talent.   Ride The Lightening - Production recording greatly increased. You can here how the band truly was getting way better. With songs like Fight Fire With Fire and Fade To Black  Master Of Puppets - Probably would be voted there top album with diehard metal fans. A masterpiece and Cliff's last album before his death.  And Justice For All - There most Athletic album with very long songs. Has the song One on it. A song you'll never get tired of hearing and a song that on S&M still gives me chills.  Black - Commercial cross over album. The end of there ""live"" albums. Songs are pieced together. Mistakes can not be heard because they went back and fixed them. Still a masterpiece. This was the point the world took notice of Metallica. Girls in the 90s owned this album.  Load & Reload - originally designed to be a dual CD. The songs on both albums similar. Good albums, holds a special place for me.  Garage Ink - A album that combines all the B sides from singles from every album up to the point. There B sides were always cover songs. And a 2nd CD of cover songs they recorded at that time. A very cool album.  S&M - A live concert recorded with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and Michael Kaman. A wonderful performance that came off beautifully. Somehow the Orchestra intertwines in and out of each song. Taking the lead, falling back, playing along and elevating each part.  St. Anger - Do Not Start Here!! An album with the right attentions, recorded wrong with Lars hitting pot and pans instead of a snare drum. D tuned album. The band was kind of lost at this point and on the verge of breaking up. Still a raw album, love it or hate it.. it's Metallica.   Death Magnetic - A step in the right direction... As many say. Longer less radio friendly songs. A return to there roots. Did fall victim to the loudness wars. Still I consider this a comeback after St Anger.  Side Notes  Lulu - Cant comment did not buy.  Live Albums - Through the never - Great live album with excellent recording.  Cunning Stunts - Live DVD, A decent show from a true leg of a tour. Includes what I consider to be the best live version of Fade To Black   Live Shit Pinge and Burge - Who veers idea it was to record Seattle 89 May the Gods bless him. 3 DVD 2 CD set of the band in the prime. Anyone who watches Seattle 89 will come away saying these guys are legends.  Wow, so there ya go. Where to start is entirely up to you. Black would be a good choice as its there biggest commercial album. Kinda a gateway album into Metallica. Where ever you start I would urge you to actually buy the CD. I'm old school like that I suppose."

Paradise Lost was a film that stuck with me after its release, and a year or two later I made a website about it as part of a college project. That website turned into a hub for followers of the case for a while and I ran an active message board there for a few years.   Creating that website was also how I learned web development, which ended up starting me on my professional career. In a way, I have Bruce Sinofsky to thank for a lot of what's happened in my life.   He will be missed."

Metallica,2wqa00,Hetstaine,1 point,Mon Feb 23 07:14:26 2015 UTC,"MTV wanted to do quick 3-4 minute interviews with fans to use as clips for the show, and the Met Club sent out a call to NYC- area members with a date and time. A few of us ended lined up outside MTV's office. It was a lot of fun."

Metallica,2wqa00,Hetstaine,1 point,Mon Feb 23 12:37:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't actually get to see the show live- all the interviews were taped a few days before as I remember.   There were some Met Club tickets to the show given out, but I don't remember if they were just random or what.   I was lucky enough to get tickets to one of the Filmore shows in SF right around the same time. They did four in a row (similar to how they did the 30th anniversary shows at the Filmore). I was at I think the second or third one. Hung out with a bunch of Met Clubbers at Mickey's joint that afternoon and saw a kick ass show later that night. It was the first time they played (and anyone publicly heard) St. Anger, too, which was cool."

Anyway, the reason I asked is because he's been having hair thinning issues for a couple of years now.

No career guitar player is willing to risk injury or even the slightest damage to his hands. Makes sense to me."

I know I read somewhere that he cheated on his wife before she gave him the ultimatium of get your shit together or she was leaving with the kids (that forced him into rehab). I think part of the same article, James said he got a new wedding ring because he felt his old one was tainted from his past actions. We all know how bad of a combination sex and alcohol can be. I'm just amazed he's managed to keep this all private so that no one really knows unless he chooses to go into detail (which I doubt he will)."

If nothing else, Axl was/is a dude who loves to friggin stir the pot and rile people up, and that is Public Enemy, all over. They would have fit on a bill with G'n'R perfectly, especially at that point in time, but I don't think they would have fit on a bill with Metallica.  I've always thought that a lot of people don't realize that PE were totally a heavy metal band, just one that made hip hop /rap music."

Metallica,2wksvx,serosis,3,Fri Feb 20 19:16:25 2015 UTC,"After my and /u/delta0062's little argument over sound quality in his/hers/its thread about the Guitar Hero remasters, I took it upon myself to find out what the sound quality actually was.  After downloading the Death Magnetic DLC for Xbox 360(The only one I could find that would seed properly) and extracting the files using wxPirs and VGMToolbox(XMAsh & toWav) I found out the quality was a lot higher than I expected. Even higher than what was available to download currently.  So here is a little project that will happen over time, I have a shitty 2.5 Mbps connection and it takes five hours just to upload one set of multitracks. But I will get all of Death Magnetic uploaded within the next week.  First up though is Suicide & Redemption, the biggest set. The Hetfield, Hammett, and an Album version I hacked together. It is definitely not a perfect re-creation of the studio version but it is barely noticeable with all the tracks going at once.  Everything will be in .flac format."
Metallica,2wksvx,decytv,3,Fri Feb 20 19:25:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you for doing this.  I often find myself wishing I had the stem files so I could make a couple nice backing tracks.  Wish I had these for some of the black album songs.  Seriously, thanks, great stuff!"
Metallica,2wksvx,decytv,2,Sun Feb 22 01:46:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know how what you mean. I am doing this mainly because of the lack of ""give-a-shit"" with the tracks that are available.

Metallica,2wksvx,MoBaconMoProblems,3,Sun Feb 22 21:36:53 2015 UTC,"That is what I am talking about, the only available stems available are compressed into lossy format(not to mention downsampled) for an open source game called Frets on Fire. They combine everything into four tracks and compress them to get the best sound for the smallest filesize. Which unfortunately looks like they went for a bitrate of 128Kbps.  I thought those were the best quality you could get until I extracted them from the game myself. Which is why I am taking time to make sure people get the best quality."

Metallica,2wi0og,weirdmountain,3,Fri Feb 20 16:15:54 2015 UTC,"Which is false. After Jason quit, they went on to record St. Anger with Bob Rock on bass. Rob's first album with Metallica was Death Magnetic."
Metallica,2wi0og,therant,2,Fri Feb 20 18:29:23 2015 UTC,"This is true, but Bob Rock was only a session player/placeholder for that album.  I don't think he ever toured or played any real shows with them.  Rob was Jason's full-time replacement."
Metallica,2wi0og,weirdmountain,2,Fri Feb 20 18:48:15 2015 UTC,"You're right too. He was a placeholder. I don't have the album handy, but I recall he gets credited inside the booklet for playing bass (not just for producing). That makes him Metallica's bassist between Newsted and Trujillo.  For all intents and purposes - a true Metallica quiz would throw this as a trick question.   I only brought it up because I saw that question, rushed to click on Rob's name and quickly remembered those scenes from Some Kind of Monster. I thought I goofed, but it turns out it was just an easy question.   *edit - the Wikipedia page - lists Bob Rock as an ""additional musician"". That makes me technically wrong. The worst kind of wrong."
Metallica,2wi0og,therant,1 point,Fri Feb 20 18:55:53 2015 UTC,"But, again, at the same time, you're technically correct.   It is kind of funny that while Bob Rock did play the bass parts on St. Anger, Rob Trujillo is credited as their bassist, and it's his photo in the album art..."

Metallica,2wfoff,Dakota66,12,Thu Feb 19 15:13:00 2015 UTC,'Where the Wild Thing are' should have been on 'Dirt' by Alice in Chains. Serious answer though... Wherever I may Roam could have been on Load or Reload in my opinion! I love the song and I love Load and Reload just to clarify.
Metallica,2wfoff,rodwool,4,Thu Feb 19 16:16:21 2015 UTC,I know that they were all written around the same time but many songs on Reload feel like Load songs.   I feel like Load was softer (Where the Wild Things Are) and Reload was heavier (fuel).
Metallica,2wfoff,Bwuhbwuh,11,Thu Feb 19 16:52:17 2015 UTC,"I've been a Metallica fan for about 9 years now I think, and I still don't know if songs are from Load or Reload."
Metallica,2wfoff,leadfarmer153,1 point,Thu Feb 19 18:10:24 2015 UTC,"Load and Reload were suppose to be one album. But the Reload songs weren't up to par. They put them on the back burner, toured on Load and finished Reload."

Metallica,2wfoff,weirdmountain,9,Sun Feb 22 06:44:26 2015 UTC,"I always felt like Load was the more ""rock and roll"" album.   ""Mama Said"" and ""2x4"" sound like Skynyrd songs; ""Ronnie"", and ""Ain't My Bitch"" sound like ZZ Top songs; ""Until It Sleeps"" and ""Hero Of The Day"" sound like Thin Lizzy songs.    And I always felt like ReLoad was the more ""classic heavy metal"" album.   ""Fuel"", ""Prince Charming"", and ""Attitude"" all sound like Motörhead songs; ""The Memory Remains"" sounds so much like Ozzy-era Sabbath that I wish Rick Rubin would have talked Sabbath into covering it for album outtakes for their ""13"" album, as does ""Carpe Diem Baby"".   At the same time, ""Devil's Dance"" and ""Fixxxer"" sound like Dio-era Sabbath.   ""Slither"" sounds like an AC/DC song.     Those two albums were the first time we ever really saw them wear their influences on their sleeves, and it becomes really evident when you listen to Garage Inc, which was the third Metallica album in three years, right after Load and ReLoad.     They did it again with ""Lords Of Summer"", which is the best Judas Priest song that came out in 2014."

Metallica,2wfoff,BoardroomBimmy,8,Thu Feb 19 16:58:43 2015 UTC,It was made at the last minute as a filler radio-ish sounding track that the record company wanted to be on there iirc.
Metallica,2wfoff,bluecard17,2,Thu Feb 19 18:34:35 2015 UTC,It's one of my favorites. Highly underrated IMO.
Metallica,2wfoff,Cromlech,1 point,Thu Feb 19 20:12:51 2015 UTC,Escape sounds nothing like black album material. But I do agree that it sounds like it doesn't belong on Lightning. It sounds far more mainstream for that time period than anything else they ever did up to that point.
Metallica,2wfoff,ZadexResurrect,1 point,Sun Feb 22 00:48:30 2015 UTC,"Eh. If it had the same production, guitar tones and era correct vocals, I don't think anyone would ever bat an eye."
Metallica,2wfoff,Zennakku,8,Sun Feb 22 01:48:34 2015 UTC,Dyers Eve. No doubt. Shortest and fastest song on the record. I love the song but it's strange that it's the last track after an epic long track like To Live Is To Die. Seems more like something you would find on the first couple of albums.
Metallica,2wfoff,TristanCorb,1 point,Thu Feb 19 15:30:18 2015 UTC,I always felt like it belonged on Master of Puppets.

Metallica,2wfoff,decytv,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:18:21 2015 UTC,I agree 100%. Only exception I can think of making is all the songs on Load and ReLoad. I feel like I can consider those two just one giant album.
Metallica,2wfoff,el_diablo_gato,1 point,Sat Feb 21 23:06:52 2015 UTC,"for me, although the content from reload was the load leftovers, I dont think of them that way. for me, load was much stronger. The songs on reload seem more experimental. james' voice seems a little different. too.  i like reload,but it was always second fiddle to load."
Metallica,2wfoff,decytv,2,Mon Feb 23 14:51:41 2015 UTC,"I listened to each album as they came out and I have to be honest, I can't imagine any songs being anywhere else. They are so engrained in my head in the era the band released them I believe they are all on the album they should be on.   Off topic but slightly related thought, I think the entire album Death Magnetic belongs in between Justice and TBA. I love DM but it seems like a time warp. A good one, of course."
Metallica,2wfoff,TheFriffin,3,Mon Feb 23 01:31:40 2015 UTC,I always felt like One was such an amazing song that it should have been on Black album instead.  Best songs = best album.  I'm pretty silly though.
Metallica,2wfoff,Metallicarox,3,Thu Feb 19 18:32:09 2015 UTC,"The first half is pretty similar to the Unforgiven, and it would fit on the Black Album. The latter half does fit AJFA perfectly though."

I started playing guitar 7 months ago and I still don't fully have the technique down to play the chords properly throughout an entire song.

Metallica,2w7n2f,JoeyTheGuitar,3,Wed Feb 18 16:42:19 2015 UTC,Moderus III  He also did a few songs off justice if you're interested  Dyers Eve  Shortest Straw  Blackened
Metallica,2w7n2f,blackvalve,-2,Wed Feb 18 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"I think people make too big a deal of the production; it's perfectly listenable. The GH3 versions do sound better though, especially songs like Broken Beat & Scarred.  edit: Some of the songs are a bit different (Suicide and Redemption); they added some finishing touches before sending it to GH3 (or they used demoes)."
Metallica,2w7n2f,SuicidoCheez,9,Tue Feb 17 19:15:55 2015 UTC,"If anything, people didn't make a big enough deal out of it. The band only very recently even admitted to there being a problem.

Metallica,2w7n2f,Agent_545,4,Wed Feb 18 10:28:10 2015 UTC,You either need your hearing checked or your stereo/headphones are a total piece of shit because the difference in the GH3 versions and the CD release is fucking huge.

Metallica,2w7n2f,G-42,-6,Mon Feb 23 13:58:12 2015 UTC,I still prefer the album versions. If I were going to accept anything else it would either be the Band's remaster or my own.  Those are the only two opinions I trust when it comes to Metallica.
Metallica,2w7n2f,serosis,12,Tue Feb 17 21:12:28 2015 UTC,"I love Metallica as songwriters and performers, but I don't trust the hearing of people who've been playing metal every day for 30+ years.  Don't even begin to tell me their hearing is fine."
Metallica,2w7n2f,DoylePTB,5,Wed Feb 18 01:15:34 2015 UTC,"Well, the guitar hero one is simply the uncompressed and not 'loudness war'ed version of the album. It's not a remaster, it's a version of the master before it was raped by the  production people."
Metallica,2w7n2f,serosis,-4,Tue Feb 17 21:32:39 2015 UTC,"Yes it is a remaster, because someone still had to put the multitracks from Guitar Hero together and use their ear to balance the levels. Otherwise the only thing you could have downloaded was the separate tracks for guitar, bass, and drums.  EDIT:  Not to mention the Guitar Hero stems are compressed in a lossy format introducing ugly auditory artifacts. That wierd, warbly, white noise when a song goes quiet. These are not 320kbps MP3s here. Low quality compressed OGG.  UPDATE:  Just for your edification I uploaded the bass track from That Was Just Your Life for you to listen to.  You will notice the background sounds like one of those cliche mainframe computers bleeping away."
Metallica,2w7n2f,SuicidoCheez,3,Tue Feb 17 21:44:42 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that Suicide and Redemption is different. The end of the solo is more drawn out, I'm still not sure which version's solo I prefer."
Metallica,2w7n2f,metallicafan542,-2,Wed Feb 18 01:01:03 2015 UTC,Yet another reason why. And there is not enough information between the two versions to recreate the solo on the album.
Metallica,2w7n2f,serosis,2,Wed Feb 18 05:54:39 2015 UTC,That depends on where you got them. The version I got off the Pirate Bay has 320kbps audio (and you can hear that). The torrent I found was called Metallica.Death.Magnetic.320Kbps.MP3.GHIII.EDiTiON-ViSUAL

They recorded their 2010 concert in Puerto Rico and listening to it gives me second hand embarrasment. His most obvious fuck up is in Nothing Else Matters, which is a song that only requires a steady beat and a good feel, the base on which every good drummer ever supports himself, and Lars lacks  Edit: I havent watched the video yet, I'll wait to get home from work."
Metallica,2w4nn8,FloydRosita,3,Tue Feb 17 01:41:13 2015 UTC,I really hate to agree with you but you are kind of right.  He really sucks.  Even back in the day the only thing he really had going for him was he could double bass pedal like a mad man but now he can hardly even do that.  He really needs to come back down to Earth and practice. I still think he is the right drummer for Metallica because of how well he can fit drums to a guitar riff and he is a great song writer but he really has gone down the tubes during live shows especially.

Metallica,2w4nn8,MoBaconMoProblems,2,Sun Feb 22 07:00:29 2015 UTC,"We probably wouldn't have a Metallica. He started the band, and is continually the reason for their success.

Metallica,2vzzto,KilosunWS,5,Sun Feb 15 22:37:32 2015 UTC,Torrents are where I got my copy many years ago.  I never listened to the retail version again after downloading the GH3 rips.  There is a similar version of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Californication floating around on the torrents called Californication Unmastered.  Can you guess which producer appears on both Californication and Death Magnetic?  Seems to be a theme with him and shit fidelity.  Edit: spelling.
Metallica,2vzzto,wadems,3,Mon Feb 16 01:50:43 2015 UTC,Comparison between CD version and Guitar Hero version. CD version is far more compressed.

Metallica,2vzzto,heini92,4,Sun Feb 15 23:34:10 2015 UTC,"Final mastering, probably.   Every Guitar Hero version I've heard still sounds like a demo.

To look inside and see what's comin""  Bad Seed and Attitude are bad lyrical songs but I think that (.. oh boy I'm gonna be unpopular for this) Hit The Lights sounds very cringy. Very teenage-like.

She traces me and draws me in"".   Also, unnamed feeling has some great lyrics too . ""I wish I could turn my eyes to look inside to see what's coming"".. Say what you want about St anger, but lyrically it probably has the most touching lyrics they have ever written. The outlaw torn is another song that blew me away. This is why I'm a Metallica fan.

Metallica,2vwpxg,metallicafan542,35,Sat Feb 14 21:14:18 2015 UTC,"Because the signal is dynamically compressed with a limiting compressor in a style called ""brickwall"" compression. It means the signal is absolutely maxed to the ceiling. Some of the songs actually surpass the ceiling and digitally clip. This is Rick Rubin's (the producer/mixing engineer) doing. The mastering engineer of Death Magnetic has been quoted as basically saying that the mix was ruined before he even got it, there was almost nothing he could do to it. I would be surprised if he even did anything at all to it except put his name on it.    The ""Loudness War"" is a problem because excessively compressed music has no life to it. It doesn't breathe, like real music does. When you go to see a live show, you feel the pulse of the music, the pounding bass, the searing guitars, the pummeling riffage, the jabs of the drums. Music that is brickwalled doesn't sound like much of anything except lifeless white noise. There is nothing to be gained from turning it up. It sounds exactly the same at any volume, which is the reason why it is done at all. There is a misguided and frankly sickening trend in modern music and radio whereby, rather than relying on the listener to simply turn their fucking stereo up if the music is not loud enough, radio stations and mixing engineers just compress the living fuck out of everything to avoid the chance that ""someone else's"" song might be louder than theirs. (The horror, the calamity!)    To give you an example of just how insanely badly Death Magnetic is compressed, look at this photo of the waveform from a Death Magnetic song, compared to a song from Master Of Puppets:  http://imgur.com/a/xom7J  Click the photos to see a short description. Metallica is not the only metal band that does this, but Death Magnetic is very extreme. Most other metal acts have at least 4 or 5dB of range. Death Magnetic has about 1.5 or 2dB (or even less in some songs) of range. It's just a lifeless mix. It gives you nothing when you turn it up, and that is unsatisfying to the listener.    If you listen to some more underground and expertly mixed metal/rock albums (first that comes to mind is anything mixed by Steve Wilson), the mix is very organic and feels full of life, and you can hear a depth to it. And guess what? When you turn it up on a high quality stereo, it sounds fucking great!  EDIT: It's worth adding that the human brain actually uses dynamic range, to a degree, to place things in the stereo field and to differentiate different sounds. If everything is the same volume all the way through, it is hard to pick out intricacies in music. It's frankly taxing to listen to. I can't listen to Death Magnetic for longer than a few songs unless I'm drunk or something. It just doesn't sound good."

Metallica,2vwpxg,hellrazzer24,-1,Mon Feb 16 06:54:26 2015 UTC,"Other than the clipping and slight distortion, Death Magnetic sounds much better than the guitar hero version."
Metallica,2vwpxg,Helevitia,8,Sun Feb 15 16:23:31 2015 UTC,Because there is absolutely no dynamic range on the album and it is so loud at points it is distorted.
Metallica,2vwpxg,CoMiGa,5,Sat Feb 14 23:07:33 2015 UTC,It's mixed at stupidly high volumes which leads to clipping being audible.
Metallica,2vwpxg,Strider_,3,Sat Feb 14 21:40:47 2015 UTC,Listen to the end of The Judas Kiss and you'll hear the distortion even after all instruments have died down.
Metallica,2vwpxg,CaptainAwesome64,3,Sat Feb 14 23:08:09 2015 UTC,The Guitar Hero 3 version of the album had a different mix.  Sounds a little more balanced. Someone ripped it from the game back when it came out. Not sure if its still available.
Metallica,2vwpxg,jasondidit,2,Sun Feb 15 01:04:02 2015 UTC,Just listen to the end of The Day That Never Comes  What was great is that the guitar hero version of DM wasn't as badly screwed with.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DRyIACDCc1I

Metallica,2vwpxg,autowikibot,4,Sat Feb 14 21:40:04 2015 UTC,"Loudness war:       ""Loudness war"" or ""loudness race"" is the popular name given to the trend of increasing audio levels on CDs and in digital audio files since the early 1990s, which many critics believe reduces sound quality and listener enjoyment. Increasing loudness was first reported [by whom?] as early as the 1940s with respect to mastering practices for 7"" singles. The maximum peak level of analog recordings such as these is limited by varying specifications of electronic equipment along the chain from source to listener, including vinyl record and cassette players.

Metallica,2vwpxg,Crashiee,3,Sat Feb 14 21:40:31 2015 UTC,It's a trend of increasing audio levels on CDs by removing the dynamic which make it sound louder. People believe it reduce sound quality and enjoyment.
Metallica,2vwpxg,DixieWreckedJedi,1 point,Sat Feb 14 21:40:40 2015 UTC,The album is mixed at a high volume relative to most.
Metallica,2vwpxg,Hordiyevych,1 point,Sat Feb 14 21:37:47 2015 UTC,"Now that I know what loudness war is (thanks guys) I can say that there are parts where I've heard clipping in some of the DM songs, and when my music is on shuffle they are noticeably louder than the rest of the Metallica songs. I've heard people say that the audio quality in DM was a lot lower than in previous albums, and that may be the doing of the loudness war. Personally, I'm not too big a fan of the clipping, but DM has it's own unique sound (to my musically untrained ears and this is coming from someone whose only involvement in music is listening to it) that is instantly recognisable."
Metallica,2vwpxg,Godofallu,1 point,Sat Feb 14 22:06:00 2015 UTC,I actually bought and then returned my first copy of Death Magnetic since every time I would turn the speakers up I could detect a static noise.   Turns out it's supposed to be like that. What a joke. Oh well I have a fan made remastered version now and it's pretty great. Of course I have a legit copy that I bought too.

Metallica,2vwpxg,echoplexe,1 point,Sun Feb 15 15:20:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly compression aside. This record sounds like shit anyways in my opinion. If I wanted to hear drums that sound like the drums on death magnetic I would just listen to an Eagles record. Kind of a deal breaker for me. You can't let our ears marvel at the sonic power of the black album and then just reverse the evolution of your sound (and sound in general). It's like McDonald's perfecting the Big Mac over the span of their operation and then deciding great sandwiches aren't cool anymore and botching the recipe to stay current and ""hip"".  Although I have always appreciated their willingness to bend the rules and let their sound take different directions. Purely opinion based.   Downvote for an opinion. Stay classy r/Metallica"

Im not a huge fan of it now, but it did give me the opening to check out more stuff from Diamond Head, Maiden, Tygers of Pan Tang, etc.  I like some of their newer Garage Inc. covers of non-metal stuff, but overall I'm just not into stuff like Sknyrd, Nick Cave and that sort of thing. I don't think it works as well as the original Garage stuff, where you can cleary see where Metallica got a lot of their influences from."

Metallica,2vpfuk,DoylePTB,2,Thu Feb 12 23:45:29 2015 UTC,"this is what I wanted to say.. in addition to those songs, I really like the song SKOM.. but I also have some issues with this album as well.. I cant stand that tinny snare sound.. and like someone mentioned, the riffs seem to sound like an 11 year old trying to interpet heavy metal for the first time. I remember when this album came out, i for the first time, thought my riffs were on par with JH... it wasnt until death magnetic that i realized i am not in the same league as him. So Musically, i think it's their weakest album, but i do appreciate this album for the fact that it kept them alive."

Metallica,2vpfuk,r_u_ferserious,9,Fri Feb 13 11:05:09 2015 UTC,"Full disclosure: I'm a ""purist"".  I say that bc I'm in my 40's.  I was there for the emergence of Kill'em All and all the rest.  St Anger was so foreign, I just haven't been able to get over it.  It has been years and I just can't get into it.  You're going to go a long way before you find a bigger fan.  Metallica defined a lot of my youth; I've been to over a dozen concerts, my wife bought me and our sons tix to Vegas for Rockin Rio in May, t-shirts, banners..........the list goes on and on.  My appreciation for the band is true and legit.  But I just have never been able to accept Anger.  And I wanted to, I really did.  But I find myself so incredibly tuned in to every note, to each chord, to every single tap on the snare and toms on every track of every album..............I just can't identify with St Anger.  It's not something I hate them for.  I'm not mad they did it or went outside of their formula.  It's just not an album I can't get into no matter how many times I try."
Metallica,2vpfuk,xVocalTestx,2,Fri Feb 13 04:27:52 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you, I just cannot tolerate that record. I feel like it's the record they needed to do to realise they went in a direction they didn't necessarily want to go in, they just ended up going in that direction. If you look at the sheer improvement in songwriting on Death Magnetic, you see a reinvigorated band that embraces where they came from and used that to write an album that stands up next to their earlier output.   St Anger needed to happen, they needed to see what a truly average record was like so they could get that kick up the arse to make something truly great. I can't listen to St Anger but I appreciate what it symbolises and enjoy the documentary more than the music of that particular bass player less period."
Metallica,2vpfuk,Stop_Rock_Video,1 point,Fri Feb 13 06:39:44 2015 UTC,"I have serious trouble with some of the writing on this CD. Some of it sounds like an 11 year old's interpretation of what a metal song sounds like. I have a very hard time believing that the band that once wrote ""A vow unto his own that never from this day his will they'll take away"" also wrote ""Madly in anger with you"" and ""Kill kill kill kill kill""."
Metallica,2vpfuk,xVocalTestx,2,Fri Feb 13 08:06:55 2015 UTC,"This is what I mean though, the rest of the band helped out with the lyrics as seen on SKOM docu.  That had to happen for them to realise that they shouldn't really let anyone else write the lyrics and just get it out of their system.  I dislike the songs but like the fact that without that record, we wouldn't have the Metallica we have today."

Metallica,2vpfuk,heini92,4,Fri Feb 13 13:52:39 2015 UTC,"I really like it, always have. The only thing that annoys me sometimes about the album is that some songs have huge repeating sections with little or no variation. The song St. Anger stops and restarts almost completely about 3-4 minutes in. Invisible Kid does the same thing. That song doesn't need to be 8 minutes long. SKOM does it too, but at least with SKOM, James changed all the lyrics the second run through so it feels less dry.    Even considering that, I still enjoy all of the songs. Dirty Window, My World and Shoot Me Again are probably my favourites.    The other thing is that there are some super interesting guitar tones on this album. I think James used a Wizard and Diezel amp for a lot of this album, which is totally not usual for him (he pretty much always uses Mesa pre-amps/power amps and Marshall power amps). He also used a Wizard amp on Garage Inc. I believe. Even though the production is lacking, the combination of crazy low tunings, different guitar amps, and basically just  ""fuck you"" style of writing gives everything a super brash edge which pretty much none of their other albums have."
Metallica,2vpfuk,Timsin,4,Fri Feb 13 02:35:00 2015 UTC,"Enjoyable and underrated I think. Just because it's Metallica, does not make it bad. That goes out to the uptight music critics out there.  Claim: If it wasn't Metallica on the cover it would be applauded, but whatever. I think it's a great album, and I feel sorry for those who don't."
Metallica,2vpfuk,SuicidoCheez,5,Fri Feb 13 00:12:43 2015 UTC,"This album may not be the thrashy technical Metallica we all know and love but this album is not bad. It's different but different isn't a bad thing, this album is packed full of emotion more so than any other album of theirs. It also has some really memorable songs like St. Anger and Frantic but it also had some bad like Shoot me Again. Over all I thought this was a great Metallica production."
Metallica,2vpfuk,GamePrime99,2,Fri Feb 13 12:00:50 2015 UTC,"I think it's a pretty good album. Sure, it's different, but the same talented band is behind it. The drums are tolerable, and sometimes even good. All Within My Hands and The Unnamed Feeling are awesome."
Metallica,2vpfuk,weirdmountain,2,Fri Feb 13 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"I enjoy listening to it a lot. Its one of Metallicas more interesting albums and I'm a fan of their more different stuff like Load, ReLoad, and St. Anger. They all have something that other Metallica albums don't have."
Metallica,2vpfuk,metallicafan86,2,Fri Feb 13 00:50:14 2015 UTC,"You can't mention the name ""Metallica"" without St. Anger coming into the conversation.   Personally, I've see-sawed with my feelings toward that album since it was released.   I loved it when it came out, because I was just as starved for ANY new Metallica as anyone else.  The years following, I hated on it pretty hard.   In the past few years, I've come around on it, and now I really love it for what it is.   I bought it on a vinyl LP a year or two ago, and that way of listening to it is best, in my opinion, because the songs are spaced out across 4 sides, so you get a breather here and there, instead of a 78-minute assault."

Metallica,2vpfuk,ChaosForger,1 point,Sat Feb 14 19:22:08 2015 UTC,"I think if it sounded the way it did on the DVD rehearsal, it woukd have been looked at more favorably.  I like it to a degree, but I can see why it's hated. I get what Metalluca were going for, and it works somewhat, but it just needed more refinement. The drums are obviously terrible, but I like the production on it overall. I like the concept of making it a grimey sounding garage album. The problem is that a lot of the lyrics are laughably bad, the songs are too long, too repetitive, the snare drum, of course, and yeah, Bob Rock just had WAY too much influence in the whole making of it. Too many cooks in the kitchen and it fucked up the direction the album should have gone in.  Like I said, I think if it sounded and had the feel that the rehearsal DVD had, and if they had just tightened up some of the songs, it would have been received more favorably. I do enjoy the 2015 remake on Youtube, but what I think they do wrong is that they try to make it sound too much like a typical metal album. They play too fast, it sounds too clean, they take out the soul of St. Anger. I think what works with Anger is the low quality, the groove to the songs, and completely different direction from everything else they've done before. It plays better as it does on the DVD - slowed down in parts, sped up in others, and keep Bob Rock from sucking the soul out of the band."

Metallica,2vpfuk,usereyesweb,1 point,Mon Feb 16 14:36:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly its the first album by metallica I truly liked front to back. I'll admit though that I only heard the first four albums and Load by that time. The first four album are not that good too me..but that has to do more with the fact that the sound quaillity is kinda meh and the way James' voice sounds on them. Load was a cool abum but didn't really get my attention that much. But then I got St. Anger for Christmas and I LOVED it. Truth be told, I wasn't a fan of guitar solos, not only by metallica, but in general. So the fact that St. Anger had none certainly helped. To this day. Its my favorite metallica album. Along with the black album. And if you wonder. Yes, I like guitar solos (especially by metallica) now. I can't tell you what it was but back then (I was 9 years old) I couldn't really get into them."
Metallica,2vpfuk,terrynutkinsfinger,1 point,Mon Feb 16 16:37:42 2015 UTC,This album is growing on me.  I just ordered the 4LP 45rpm vinyl set and can't wait to hear it.  The sticking point for me on this one is the lyrics....but I'm getting over it.  Musically it's a great album.

Dave is by no means a good singer or anything, but his voice is the only one i can imagine singing tornado of souls or holy wars. Also, his riffing. Ive never been a fan of his leads, even in metallica, but he always got great lead players for megadeth so there is literally nothing to hate"
Metallica,2vcns3,TerrrorTwlight,5,Tue Feb 10 01:07:33 2015 UTC,"Rust in Peace is so good. A masterpiece indeed. Having never heard any Megadeth until about a year ago, I had always assumed they were some cheesy hair metal band, but one day I decided to give them a try so I typed in Megadeth on YouTube and Holy Wars was the first song to come up. 30 seconds in and I was sold. They fucking rock.   My ONLY complaint about that album is the sound quality. I have the original non-remastered CD and it just seems so quiet."

Metallica,2vcns3,leadfarmer153,3,Tue Feb 10 09:18:52 2015 UTC,I've read all of Hammets parts on Kill Em All were Dave's riffs almost note for note  with little tiny changes.   I think Megadeth could've been as big as Metallica if Dave would've just played guitar instead of singing also. His voice just isn't there. He's an amazing guitar player. One of the best ever.

Don't get me wrong his voice is perfect for the new stuff, but much more raw for the older albums."
Metallica,2v7h71,AcadianMan,7,Sun Feb 8 23:28:27 2015 UTC,Well he is 51.
Metallica,2v7h71,guinne55fan,4,Mon Feb 9 03:05:31 2015 UTC,"That's not why though,,  he blew out his vocal chords before the black album."
Metallica,2v7h71,AcadianMan,3,Mon Feb 9 03:19:29 2015 UTC,"He blew his voice out on So What, but age is definitely a factor."
Metallica,2v7h71,guinne55fan,2,Mon Feb 9 04:35:33 2015 UTC,"I disagree with all of this. No need to make excuses for him. He was never a great singer. What he was, was he was awesome at shouting in key and he had a great tone when he did. He was a great frontman and vocalist, but singer, not so much. He just changed his style to more singing and frankly, he's not too good at it. I think he started getting into country, and with him being concerned after blowing his voice he just decided to try something different and turns out he wasn't too great at it. That last line actually sums up Metallica during the load and reload era totally I think. They wanted to experiment, more power to them for it, but they werent as strong in other feilds as they were at making metal. Honestly, the record execs could have pushed a cleaner vocal to appeal to a wider audience, that could've been the reason for the change and we'd never know, because they'd never admit it for credibility sake. Now it has to do with him being a bit older, not having that fire from drinking and being fearless, a well as not practicing as much, and having nothing to prove, but initially it was just him tackling a different style that he wasn't competent with."
Metallica,2v7h71,Strider_,0,Mon Feb 9 05:00:31 2015 UTC,So what you're saying is you've never been to one of there shows... OK got ya. Because he can't yell non stop like he use to. Its just age and wear and tear. It has nothing to do with a style he wanted to do.  He can still growl but its not as often. I'm 34 and your voice just ages. Yelling hurts the older you get.  And at no point did I make an excuse for him. And I lol at got into country. You know he loved Waylon Jennings for a long time you know that right
Metallica,2v7h71,leadfarmer153,2,Mon Feb 9 05:13:30 2015 UTC,"I've been to plenty of shows, and there are plenty of vocalists as old or older who still use rasp or heavy vocals. Plenty of vocalists ten or twenty years younger as well who do it, which is about when he stopped, ten to twenty years ago now. Vocal chords are muscles, they get stronger the more they're used, and weaker the less they are. Aside from that, when he was still young, 20 years ago on load and the load tours, he was just choosing not to do that style, it wasn't that he couldn't, they had changed stylistically and the growling/shouting didn't fit their new style, and it also would have hindered them in the changing musical climate where alternative was really strong at the time. Now though, im sure age factors in to a degree, but again, there are plenty of singers his age or older who stay busy, who you can tell practice and write in their down time, who are still quite strong, and tou can hear it in their voices. And yeah, maybe he always liked country, but as you get older your musical tastes often change. He probably got more into it, or maybe I'm wrong and he was always way into it, I'm just talking about when he started introducing it into his own style in small increments. Sure he loves it and wants to add that tinge, I dont fault him or the band for wanting to try new things, but they're only human, just because they were the kings of metal and thrash, and Hey was the most badass vocalist ever in that style, doesn't mean I can't call it as I hear it when they attempt something different. Being great at one style doesn't get a pass from me for simply attempting others. I'm not trying to argue though, if you thought I came off as rude or condescending, that wasn't my intention. We're all fans. Also, I wasn't necessarily replying to you directly, but the chain of comments as a whole."
Metallica,2v7h71,Strider_,1 point,Mon Feb 9 05:16:41 2015 UTC,I believe at some point he voice started to hurt him and or it was going out on him a lot. And he realized he needed to stop growling during his shows. He changed to more of a sing yell.   Idk many metal singers that have played as many shows as they did and still can yell like they were in there 20s.
Metallica,2v7h71,leadfarmer153,1 point,Mon Feb 9 05:35:54 2015 UTC,He blew his voice out on SO WHAT...here is the vid where he says it.  http://youtu.be/6Vz5GWv0bkE

Point is when you yell scream like he did for years you hurt your voice.   And that is from the Making of Black. So there he is voice hurting and singing. Yes he said he threw his voice out in that interview. And I'm sure he could tell you 1000 other times he threw his voice out.   He's explaining why he does warmups to that goofy ass tape. Not why his voice has changed over the years. A completely misinterpreted interview. It maybe more like threw it out... Then finished the rest of the show and really did damage.

He's really great about responding to his fans on twitter and instagram, something not a lot of celebrities of his stature can say.   He does kinda have it made though as a celeb. He plays in the biggest metal band ever but unless you're an actual fan, chances are you wouldn't give him two looks if you walked past him in the mall."

Metallica,2uuon6,MoBaconMoProblems,3,Thu Feb 5 16:02:25 2015 UTC,"I really hope they dont. While I would love to see them perform a live show at the superbowl, I dont want them to succumb to lip-syncing and prerecorded music.. :/"

Metallica,2uuon6,brownj99,2,Fri Feb 6 04:56:21 2015 UTC,"This is a GREAT idea. The NFL has run out of big-tent acts to have during half-time, and Metallica are one of the few bands left who are big enough to fit the bill. I doubt it'll happen, though, since the NFL's goal for the half-time show is keep the ladies involved."
Metallica,2uuon6,bruzdnconfuzd,1 point,Fri Feb 6 14:09:40 2015 UTC,"Signed.  Been saying this for years.  Lip sync or not, having a real band set up at mid-field, ripping through Master, Creep, and Sandman would be fantastic.  Much better than the walking shark drivel that we were subjected to this year."
Metallica,2uuon6,EZE123,2,Sat Feb 7 18:24:58 2015 UTC,I don't like the idea at all.  Why would you want them to shorten their songs and play along with some corporate game plan just to play a popular gig?  That's everything they're against.  They don't give two shits about that kind of stuff. They want to play for the metal heads who want to hear it.  Insulting almost in my mind to try to pressure them to do that.  They're not lady gaga
Metallica,2uuon6,Benzpiece,3,Thu Feb 5 16:52:42 2015 UTC,"They're not lady gaga   Yeah, that's the point! Why should SB halftime shows be dominated by bubblegum pop bullshit that you can hear 10x/hour on the radio? Why doesn't OUR music deserve to be represented on one of the biggest stages worldwide (in terms of viewership)?  And nothing says they would have to trim down anything - they're not going to play ""One"" or ""Outlaw Torn"" or ""Orion"" - no 8-10 minute grooves. I'm thinking ""Fuel"", ""Enter Sandman"", ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", ""The Memory Remains"" or even ""Hero of the Day"". There would be no need for a supporting act.  And in the theme of ""Metal Militia,"" this event would be equal parts of amusing us already-metalheads, but also spreading that love, power and aggression to everyone else. ""We're trying to get the message to YOU!"" Right?"
Metallica,2uuon6,cygnae,3,Thu Feb 5 19:14:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you're getting down voted (probably for the same reason my above comment will be). You hit the nail on the head: Metallica CAN play their instruments and perform in front of a crowd and if they're not going to be allowed to, why bother. I'm still puzzled by RHCP even got involved with that shit show last year."
Metallica,2uuon6,brownj99,4,Thu Feb 5 22:41:54 2015 UTC,"This isn't 1982, they're a business, they're not angry teenagers.  It would be one of the biggest stashes they've ever played on factoring on TV viewers"
Metallica,2uuon6,earthwormjim91,2,Thu Feb 5 17:43:51 2015 UTC,"do you really think the best band ever needs it? they're not starving or unpopular, it's just not the same demographic playing live for the superbowl, and we still hear metallica music in the regular games.. just saying."
Metallica,2uuon6,kirkemg,1 point,Fri Feb 6 07:43:00 2015 UTC,Still.  It feels like a bit much.  They're all about doing what they want I'm not sure they'd fit into that rushed overproduced slot.  It'd have to be very very special circumstances with a lot of freedom before I could ever see them doing that.
Metallica,2uuon6,bluecard17,5,Thu Feb 5 18:02:56 2015 UTC,"Except for the giants games they've played, the grammys, television spots.  They've played plenty of times where they only played one shortened song."

Metallica,2uw6uc,MASTER_OF_PANCAKES,5,Fri Feb 6 01:51:34 2015 UTC,"That's what I think! My table thinks that NFL wouldn't hire them because of the whole has to attract the viewers and their lyrics are violent. Like okay, but Metallica is the American Music Legend!"
Metallica,2uw6uc,earthwormjim91,9,Fri Feb 6 05:32:33 2015 UTC,"The Super Bowl isn't live anymore though, after Janet Jackson's tit popped out. They'd get to ""So fu-"" before the sound was pulled, and the broadcast would never make it to tv.  I really doubt that they would do that nowadays. Too much money involved and too much backlash that could come."
Metallica,2uw6uc,yodawg111,7,Fri Feb 6 04:41:33 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're getting down voted, you're right. There's a 7-10 second delay on live TV.   Source: my job"

Metallica,2uw6uc,MASTER_OF_PANCAKES,3,Mon Feb 9 12:27:59 2015 UTC,"Ah that's right. I forgot about the damn delay from live to broadcast. I still think Metallica would do it if they were allowed to do it their own way. They've played in places bigger than any NFL stadium, so I'm sure their equipment guys could figure it out."
Metallica,2uw6uc,TerrrorTwlight,11,Fri Feb 6 13:58:32 2015 UTC,"What they should play... Blackened, Battery and Damage, Inc.  What they'd probably play... Enter Sandman, Master of Puppets and Sad But True"
Metallica,2uw6uc,bassface69,7,Thu Feb 5 22:38:05 2015 UTC,"Probably same old, like sandman or something mainstream"
Metallica,2uw6uc,yodawg111,5,Thu Feb 5 19:20:12 2015 UTC,"Probably not a lot of their favorites. A song like Creeping Death isn't explicit, but not G-rated either. Also slower songs like Nothing Else Matters would probably be out.  If I were them, I'd do a medley of:  Hit the Lights  Fuel  For Whom the Bell Tolls  Sad But True  Enter Sandman  Basically the most family-friendly and commercial songs."
Metallica,2uw6uc,dpprace,3,Sat Feb 7 01:49:07 2015 UTC,"Probably just the old Kill/Ride medley and a song from the album they're working on.  But, it isn't gonna happen. I would like for the NFL to offer the gig, but there's no way that the band would agree to playing (aka lip syncing) the halftime show.  The spectacle that the HTS has become is more suited for a band like Motley Crue, if they were interested in booking a rock act. But the NFL isn't."
Metallica,2uw6uc,SportzTawk,2,Fri Feb 6 13:31:37 2015 UTC,I didn't know HTS was lip-synced! In that case I would agree they wouldn't accept that.
Metallica,2uw6uc,yodawg111,1 point,Fri Feb 6 14:10:50 2015 UTC,"The vocals aren't necessarily lip synced, but the music itself generally is."
Metallica,2uw6uc,cygnae,2,Fri Feb 6 14:48:50 2015 UTC,"Live music is near impossible for the changing stage at the half time shows, hence why solo artists often perform. A friend showed me a video about the technical aspects behind Katy Perry's show. The only live instrumentation came from Lenny Kravitz's guitar."
Metallica,2uw6uc,vestergaard92,3,Sat Feb 7 01:59:10 2015 UTC,"well if the nfl wants them to lip-sync, i'm sure they'll play anesthesia,  call of cthulhu and orion. or just play ""so what"" even if there's something else playing on the speakers."
Metallica,2uw6uc,NefariousBanana,2,Fri Feb 6 18:23:01 2015 UTC,maybe something from the new album
Metallica,2uw6uc,bruzdnconfuzd,2,Fri Feb 6 18:07:02 2015 UTC,Super Bowl is a ~20 minute set.  Closest I've seen Metallica do to that is the Live Earth set.    Sad But True  Nothing Else Matters  Enter Sandman   Something like that.
Metallica,2uw6uc,NefariousBanana,2,Sat Feb 7 11:27:47 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love NEM, so much so that it's tattooed on my arm... but it doesn't belong in a Super Bowl halftime show."
Metallica,2uw6uc,fughp,2,Sat Feb 7 17:53:28 2015 UTC,"That's probably their most accessible song. Of course they'll play it. Hell, even my mom likes Nothing Else Matters."
Metallica,2uw6uc,CrentistTheDentist,2,Sat Feb 7 18:12:32 2015 UTC,"Fuel, Bellz, Sandman and SbT  Those songs are all staples at every single stadium in the NFL, are radio-friendly enough and you could fit them into a 15 min set without doing some halfassed medleys"
Metallica,2uw6uc,yodawg111,2,Sat Feb 7 13:14:14 2015 UTC,I'd imagine Fuel would be in there.
Metallica,2uw6uc,vestergaard92,3,Fri Feb 6 00:54:52 2015 UTC,I love Fuel (go ahead and crucify me) and I can just imagine the big elaborate half time show stages with the pistons and flame graphics from Through the Never and RaR 2014.

Metallica,2ulep2,arrocknroll,2,Tue Feb 3 23:53:01 2015 UTC,would you be willing to share that? I have tons of live stuff also.
Metallica,2ulep2,kirkemg,10,Wed Feb 4 14:01:57 2015 UTC,"One of the better live Metallica albums, especially in recent years, but go back and check out the Live in Mexico City CD that is available on the Live Shit: Binge and Purge set and check out how much energy and attitude the band had in their peak."
Metallica,2ulep2,RJB6,0,Tue Feb 3 09:59:28 2015 UTC,peak   ...of popularity
Metallica,2ulep2,KnivezScoutz,7,Wed Feb 11 16:26:18 2015 UTC,"Would have been cool to hear more from Death Magnetic or maybe 1 track from St.Anger. It is a pretty good album though and they played very well (even though they most likely overdubbed as they do with most of their live albums) and ripped through some of the songs at lightning speed which is fairly typical! I was at the show too, it was easily one of the best shows I've been to in my life. The level of production was out of this world. The only problem with the venue (Rogers Arena) is that it's a huge stadium so the sound leaves a bit to be desired, but whatever. I still prefer club settings or actual theatres for a good metal show (even though you can't mosh -- I'm getting older, I just go for the sound.)    Oh yeah... the only thing that sucks is that Orion was not done live! The crowd would have probably destroyed Rogers Arena in a froth of madness if they actually played that song live. Still pretty cool to have another recording of that great song though."
Metallica,2ulep2,GuitarGreg,3,Tue Feb 3 03:28:06 2015 UTC,Personally I think it was awesome to get a modern recording of an older song with great production and no crowd background. I'd love to see it happen to other songs.
Metallica,2ulep2,Blackadder18,2,Wed Feb 4 04:56:36 2015 UTC,"MOP already has pretty great production if you ask me. Get a vinyl of MOP and turn it up with a high quality stereo. Also, Orion has so many guitar tracks layered up on the album version that it is impossible to do it justice live unless you have five guitar players or something. But I hear you, it is still a great recording and it is cool to hear a modern take on it. I just have a soft spot for the original recording!"
Metallica,2ulep2,GuitarGreg,0,Wed Feb 4 05:05:45 2015 UTC,"Oh don't get me wrong I think the original albums quality is good enough, I meant in regards to their normal live recordings which are pretty mediocre in quality."

Looking at it as purely a live album, there is nothing at all special about it. It's one of the most generic setlists you can imagine from them.  I would much rather this level of care be applied to Metallica's 30th Anniversary Show. They played so many great songs and they will probably never have setlists like this again. If Through the Never got the same treatment that this show got, it probably wouldn't sound much different.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJr8Bdq2HI"
Metallica,2ulep2,Blasphyx,1 point,Wed Feb 4 00:46:30 2015 UTC,"Yea I can see that. I would have preferred more from Load and onward and at least one song from St. Anger since they're ""playing songs from every album."" I can see why they did it but it kind of sucks that I can count the number of post black album songs on one hand. Even when including The Black Album it's only six songs :/ It's still a great performance though even if they could have picked a more well rounded setlist."
Metallica,2ulep2,arrocknroll,2,Wed Feb 4 01:32:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they still could have covered more. I think they were more trying to cover their roots than anything. It would have been cool if they played -Human."

Metallica,2ulep2,thetaimi,2,Wed Feb 4 16:04:34 2015 UTC,I love S & M   The orchestrations are beautifully intertwined with Metallica's heavyness
Metallica,2ulep2,maximumrocker,2,Fri Feb 6 14:14:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm weird, but I like making my own setlists with the Live Shit: Binge and Purge album and Through the Never."
Metallica,2ulep2,yodawg111,3,Sat Feb 7 02:04:26 2015 UTC,"Totally overdubbed, it's closer to a studio recording than live, especially the vocals, but it sounds better than if it really was just a soundboard recording nowadays so more power to em. Seattle 89 is still the best thing in the world."
Metallica,2ulep2,Strider_,1 point,Tue Feb 3 18:58:57 2015 UTC,Go buy binge and purge from Amazon. It's like $30. You get 2 DVDs and 3 CD all live from 89 and 92. That's when the band was in there prime. If you've never seen it your jaw will drop. You can see it on YouTube but all the uploads are poor quality. Its only available on DVD no Bluray.  The sound that use to come outta there amps was amazing. Hets voice is in God mode the entire time. Then you'll understand why now they sound worn out. Because they played like that for years and years. To me Metallica now is like a cover band of how they use to play. That's why people refer to them almost as two separate bands.... Old school Metallica is a term commonly used.  Cunning Stunts isn't bad. Best song on the is Fade To Black. Probably the best version I've ever heard. At the very end James reaches up and pretends to catch something outta the air. He knew it was a moment that they nailed.
Metallica,2ulep2,leadfarmer153,2,Tue Feb 3 21:37:12 2015 UTC,"James' voice is terrible on Cunning Stunts, it cracks multiple times even during the same song. Apart from that it was good, but James voice is really weak for something they made a live DVD for."
Metallica,2ulep2,Blackadder18,2,Wed Feb 4 04:58:29 2015 UTC,That's because it was a legit leg of a tour. Not how they tour now which is 1 show every 5-6 days. 20 shows total.   It's how his voice sounds post 92 black tour when he destroyed his voice with 2 years of touring.
Metallica,2ulep2,leadfarmer153,1 point,Wed Feb 4 12:53:42 2015 UTC,I used to sit and write down all the in-between song banter from Cunning Stunts just because I thought James was the man and I wanted to learn his secrets. Great show.
Metallica,2ulep2,RJB6,-5,Wed Feb 11 19:41:47 2015 UTC,"Orion sounds so good on this recording.  Would've preferred a couple of different songs off Death Magnetic instead of Cyanide.  Stoked that there wasn't anything off St Anger, I'm a fan of all of their records but that one just plain stinks.  The product of a band without any inspiration whatsoever.  Obviously the old classics still sound amazing."
Metallica,2ulep2,xVocalTestx,0,Tue Feb 3 17:48:28 2015 UTC,"Orion sounds so good on this recording   Yes, it sounds incredible. I love it.   Would've preferred a couple of different songs off Death Magnetic instead of Cyanide.   Cyanide ain't bad, but yes. More DM songs would have ""kicked maximum ass""   Stoked that there wasn't anything off St Anger.   Not sure if any St. Anger songs would have fit with the movie, but it would be cool. When they played St. Anger stuff during the St. Anger tour, it was bad. Really bad. Madly in Anger with  the World was probably their low point IMO. They got a lot better when they started touring DM. But when they have been playing St. Anger in the By Request tour, it sounds killer!   but that one just plain stinks. The product of a band without any inspiration whatsoever.   No... I don't get it. St. Anger is a great fucking album. It is so heavy and so many cool riffs and lyrics. Seriously I never ever understood/understand the hate. Watch SKOM you will appreciate it more.   ""There is one Metallica. We have many styles, it's called Metallica."" -James"

Metallica,2uj8rx,weirdmountain,10,Mon Feb 2 18:12:03 2015 UTC,They really shouldn't. The Super Bowl actually requires you to playback. That's what got RHCP pissed off. I really don't see Metallica doing that.
Metallica,2uj8rx,Bwuhbwuh,7,Tue Feb 3 14:40:16 2015 UTC,They'd do some bullshit like Iggy Azalea with Metallica making a split-second cameo because ratings. Not optimistic.

But since its Super Bowl 50 there will probably be come compilation of past acts or some shit, who knows.  But go to an NFL game and you hear a lot of Metallica."
Metallica,2uj8rx,Fade2Black89,2,Sat Feb 7 02:06:35 2015 UTC,Never gonna happen - way too many ways for it to go bad for the NFL.  I'd love to see them pull off a repeat of the 1996 MTV Europe music awards when they came out with Last Caress and So What!
Metallica,2uinqc,foxhail,4,Mon Feb 2 14:27:20 2015 UTC,"I have a KH-602 and I absolutely love this guitar.  I have Ibanez RG,  Epiphone Explorer, and Epiphone SG. My KH-602 plays and sounds better than all of them.    Don't get me wrong I love all my guitars, but my KH will always be the one.   Lot's of people over at /r/guitars dump on ESP LTD series, but I think they are very good guitars. The EMG pups have that beautiful crunch that just yells Metallica."
Metallica,2uinqc,AcadianMan,2,Mon Feb 2 14:37:31 2015 UTC,"That's great to hear. I've been hesitant about buying anything with EMGs before because, only having one or two guitars, I've had to take into consideration how they sound on a clean channel as well as with gain. Tbh I've never played anything with EMGs though, so I could be wrong. One that will perform better with higher gain will surely be a nice change of pace."
Metallica,2uinqc,AcadianMan,2,Mon Feb 2 14:43:44 2015 UTC,"EMG sound really good on clean channels,  but they really have that deep punch when it comes to crunch.  If you play lot's of Metallica then EMG would be the pups you want.  If you want to replace the pups on an existing guitar,   I hear   GFS Crunchy rails have some similarities to EMG.  http://www.guitarfetish.com/GFS-Crunchy-Rails-Our-Hottest-Modern-Metal-Power-Black-Bridge-Pickup_p_303.html  GFS Red Active also sound really good  http://www.guitarfetish.com/REDactives-Guitar-Pickups-_c_450.html  Plus they are way cheaper  $32.  I searched youtube for GFS Crunchy rails just to get an idea and they sound pretty good."
Metallica,2uinqc,SGT_756,2,Mon Feb 2 15:35:19 2015 UTC,I think the Hetfield EMGs may be your answer...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc1FMJvNXCg  Put Hetfield EMG in the YT search and you'll find a ton more examples (that video I linked is more promotional). Actually I think the snakebyte might come with the Hetfield EMGs pre-installed...  EDIT: Both the Snakebyte and Iron Cross come with the Het Pickups.

Also love the neck-thru construction and the Floyd Rose. That guitar with a Mesa Mark IV is literally the definition of Metallica. I used to play stuff from MOP with that guitar and amp and people would be blown away at how amazing it sounded.    Only guitar I own that comes close to it is my Gibson Explorer, but the KH-602 had so much more punch, it was insane. Plus I miss that damn Floyd Rose like crazy. Lesson of the day: never sell your guitars."

Metallica,2uinqc,maximumrocker,3,Tue Feb 3 14:22:16 2015 UTC,Op what is your amp? Have you considered on changing that? You amp is what makes a big difference in tone choice.
Metallica,2uinqc,maximumrocker,2,Mon Feb 2 16:05:20 2015 UTC,"I use a Marshall Haze 40, which I don't love right now simply because it's too warm and lacks the crunch I'm looking for. It's also very bass heavy. As for pedals, Boss MT-2 (I know, ew) and Dunlop crybaby. Any suggestions?"
Metallica,2uinqc,decytv,2,Mon Feb 2 18:30:23 2015 UTC,"I'd for get about the Boss pedal. And go with this guy: http://www.blackstaramps.com/products/id30/  Heres a great review by Rob Chappers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdyrDsAmjdg  That amp has built in effects, you can get a foot switch to go between them. It has TVP. Has USB so you can record direct from amp on to your computer. Crazy how great it sounds for a none tube amp. And the price range is extremely affordable with all the features you get.   I'd seriously look at one of these. I hope this helps!  PS. if you want to get the wah pedal later then you can."
Metallica,2uinqc,Testiculese,2,Tue Feb 3 00:31:41 2015 UTC,"That sounds great from what they show in that demo video. I wish I'd seen that before spending the same amount on my Haze 40 (very entry-level tube amp). I think this is next on my shopping list, thanks for bringing it up!"
Metallica,2uinqc,Testiculese,2,Tue Feb 3 02:31:52 2015 UTC,"I have a Snakebyte and absolutely love it.  The HetSet sounds great and if you are looking for that metallica crunch i highly recommend it.  Of course it's going to depend greatly on your amp/pedals, but the guitar is great."
Metallica,2uinqc,AngusWolfe,2,Mon Feb 2 16:38:05 2015 UTC,"Not any of the above, but the Ibanez series crank out Metallica like they were born for it. I have an RG550 and 420. They are very versatile. I use them for all different kids of music, and a little fiddling on the effects, and I can go from Metallica to Zeppelin, go back to full crunch and add a delay and suddenly, Satriani."

Metallica,2uinqc,LepriXXBeats,1 point,Mon Feb 2 18:27:59 2015 UTC,Is yours close to this Les Paul Custom? I think his tone hits pretty close. Before you go buy a another guitar for no reason (not like one is really needed).
Metallica,2uinqc,tombstone23,1 point,Tue Feb 3 00:58:44 2015 UTC,"Nah, mine just has the regular Gibson Alnico humbuckers, so they don't really deliver the same crunch you get from the EMGs. I do like that guys tone though, it does sound really close."
Metallica,2ufonu,NYR99,4,Sun Feb 1 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"I was the same as you, I watched it when I was 18 as a blindly devoted fan. Now i'm more of a casual fan and I can see just how messy the whole thing is.   I'm fascinated by St. Anger. I always wonder how they reached some of the conclusions they did. Obviously it was fuelled by the therapy, Jason leaving, all that. At some point there were decisions made regarding the album, tuning changes, the snare sound, the cut and paste nature and I'd love to know why.   I don't mean ""they were angry so the sound is angry"", I want to know asthetically, for example James might have said somewhere he was inspired by touring with bands like Limp Bizkit and Slipknot to tune lower, or Lars was messing around with his snare and thought ""this might be some revolutionary shit"". It's a very interesting album for stylistic decisions."

Although contrary to belief, if you watch SKOM, St. Anger was actually recorded with a blue 5.5""x14"" Ludwig Vistalite snare. (To any non-drummers or musicians, those are the clear, acrylic drums)"
Metallica,2ufonu,jnoble_05,1 point,Fri Feb 6 08:00:56 2015 UTC,I still cant stand it. His snare was perfect on the black album. I wish he would go back to that sound.

Metallica,2ufonu,RJB6,0,Fri Feb 6 16:57:59 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, you will never get a better sounding snare than a brass or a 6.5""x14"" Ludwig Supraphonic."
Metallica,2ufonu,rd1994,2,Fri Feb 6 21:51:26 2015 UTC,"that's interesting to know.. im a guitarist and know nothing about drums, but it doesnt mean i dont care about them :)"
Metallica,2ufonu,SleestakLightning,0,Fri Feb 6 21:52:10 2015 UTC,"Haha for sure. Despite everyone hating on it, Lars' Tama LU1465 (diamond plate) is a great snare when tuned right with some Puresound snares. I love mine. He also has a signature bell brass, but it's a $1200 drum. I've never seen him use it, but I have seen him use a regular Tama bell brass back with the silver Starclassic (S&M) era. Not to be confused with this silver Starclassic he used for the ""Dehaan"" gig, and the acoustic show they did where he used one kick and a Ludwig Black Beauty. Sorry I just geeked out lmao"
Metallica,2ufonu,pierpstain,1 point,Fri Feb 6 21:59:20 2015 UTC,In the video I watched he said he has been using that snare for 10 years. Maybe not that specific design though. Which drummer would you say has the best metal tone? For me it's vinnie Paul
Metallica,2ufonu,Hordiyevych,0,Fri Feb 6 22:31:20 2015 UTC,It was decided early on that they wanted it to be raw and sound like a garage band getting together and jamming for the first time.
Metallica,2ufonu,TheNecromancer,1 point,Mon Feb 2 07:52:19 2015 UTC,"That doesn't explain the tuning or the snare, that explains the rawness of the recordings."
Metallica,2ufonu,foxhail,1 point,Mon Feb 2 08:01:57 2015 UTC,well..for the snare...maybe they haad one song where they had the snare like that and decided to keep it for the sake of consistency. And maybe tunignwise...its again..something that felt natural to do..I mean..looking back they barely have any songs in alt tunings shrugs for that part I have no idea at all..but the first part seems possible in my opinion.
Metallica,2ufonu,jnoble_05,0,Mon Feb 2 15:17:45 2015 UTC,It does actually. Because rather than take the time to be meticulous on every little sound they just ran with it.
Metallica,2ufonu,Bob_The_Zombie,0,Mon Feb 2 20:04:26 2015 UTC,That snare... So bad.  It makes me blink involuntarily every time Lars hits it.
Metallica,2ufonu,serosis,6,Wed Feb 4 07:37:09 2015 UTC,"Recently they said that, potentially, without the cameras around filming the documentary, they might have not been able to keep themselves in check and the whole band would have fallen apart. It's interesting to watch it after knowing that, and to be honest I have to give great kudos to Metallica for surviving something like that. It was really interesting to see some of them opening up slightly, like Lars when he mentioned he was always the third (fourth?) wheel, and how it would take ""28 beers and for James and I to be alone together"" for James to say how much he loved him. In any case, it documented one of the greatest bands of all time going through a really tough period, so even for a non-Metallica fan I think it would have been very interesting to watch."
Metallica,2ufonu,deepseatoast,6,Sun Feb 1 22:46:18 2015 UTC,"It made me like Lars a lot more.  When he loses it at James over the rules set out around his recovery is a very powerful moment.  You see then, that for all the image and all that people may say against him, he is a guy who loves being in a heavy metal band and just playing music.  I've had exactly the same arguments with band members who try and delineate the process and stick up boundaries to playing music, so it really hit home."
Metallica,2ufonu,Fapstronaut_TK_421,3,Mon Feb 2 11:30:00 2015 UTC,"I got most of the way through watching it for the first time a few days ago, and it's really interesting to see how therapy can affect people like it did the band during that time. Along with that, it really struck a chord to see how James improved coming back from rehab since I've been starting to try to deal with alcoholism myself recently. It's encouraging to hear that recovery doesn't happen overnight.  This definitely feels different from the era shown in the documentary about the making of the Black Album; the band seems to have really matured, not just as musicians, but as people, some of the guys being fathers, dealing with old demons, or even Lars selling his paintings. I haven't tried to start learning more about Metallica until just recently, so I'm looking forward to finishing it up."
Metallica,2ufonu,jnoble_05,1 point,Sun Feb 1 22:01:06 2015 UTC,You can definitely see the beginning of a long and hard road during the making of the black album. A lot of frustrations began on that album and they finally boiled over during skom.

My wife battled it for the first three years of our marriage. It was the most awful thing either of us have ever been through and we almost divorced because of it.  She finally saw someone, and that cloud has lifted.  She's was a completely different person during those years. It was so hard to be trying to love someone who couldn't feel anything and began to resent you for it. She just felt empty all the time, and from that anger would grow.

Metallica,2u5erq,oldmonkmgm,2,Fri Jan 30 08:05:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. And the sort of madness that screams portrays. I have gone through bouts of depression, and it resonates with me."
Metallica,2u5erq,jokesandnotes,7,Fri Jan 30 13:42:33 2015 UTC,"For me, The Unnamed Feeling has a similar meaning that Fade to Black has. I was contemplating suicide some time ago and I would listen to Fade to Black and it made me feel like I wasn't alone...like someone else went through the same BS that I was going through and they managed to survive so maybe I would too. It's songs like those that help me get through the tough times and think that if I just hold on I'll find a light at the end of the tunnel. I don't know if I'd be alive if it wasn't for Metallica."
Metallica,2u5erq,PhantomLordJD,8,Fri Jan 30 05:20:21 2015 UTC,I get what the Unnamed Feeling is. I can feel it right before I get a panic or anxiety attack. I've also felt it a couple of times when I was seriously considering suicide when I was in the middle of a bad depression. It still amazes me how James wrote something so exposing of his own problems considering how private he is.
Metallica,2u5erq,Abandoned_Post,8,Fri Jan 30 08:04:41 2015 UTC,"This is one of my favorite songs off the album. It resonates on so many levels for me. The raw sound, the ugly poetic lyrics, James screaming at the end, the ""I wanna hate it all away"" segment...really hits home with me and I've used this song to describe how I'm feeling to girlfriends in the past."

Edit: Favorite part of the lyrics:  ""I've found safety in this loneliness  But I can not stand it anymore  Cross my heart hope not to die  Swallow evil, ride the sky  Lose myself in a crowded room  You fool, you fool, it will be here soon"""
Metallica,2u5erq,weirdmountain,4,Fri Jan 30 18:59:40 2015 UTC,"Can we also talk about how St. Anger has aged really, really, realllly well...?!  I went through a few years not really feeling that album, and I still think that there are too many curse words where there should be guitar solos, but on the days that I think to myself, ""I need to listen to Metallica right now"", and *St. Anger is the album I reach for, it's awesome.   I have it on vinyl, and it makes for an awesome listening experience, because the songs are broken up to about 3 songs per side across two records.    I think it's their most ""human"" album."
Metallica,2u5erq,gingawhaaat,5,Fri Jan 30 20:08:56 2015 UTC,"Dude fuck yeah, you make basically all the points I'd make. I love this album and was listening to this song yesterday! Thanks for posting this. People are so quick to write off the album or really anything post Justice/Black Album.  Your next post should be about how awesome Lulu is, and you'd be right!"
Metallica,2u5erq,gingawhaaat,3,Fri Jan 30 09:23:56 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of Lulu. It sounds like a Metallica jam session that they didn't iron out with Lou Reed reciting poems over it. Doesn't do it for me. Not saying it's bad for what it is, just don't like it."
Metallica,2u5erq,oldmonkmgm,2,Fri Jan 30 10:25:32 2015 UTC,"I hear you. It took me a WHILE to get into it, but I eventually heard that thing that Lou Reed has that people love him for.

I've never understood the negative reception it gets from some Metallica ""fans"", it's a powerful album that the band needed to release, they needed to unleash their inner anger after going through a tough period in the band's existence. To understand what I mean I advice you to watch Some Kind of Monster if you haven't already seen it!! St. Anger will always be one of my favourite albums for many reasons...The Unnamed Feeling being just one of them!"

Good call on HOF, too.    I remember the first time I heard them was the first time I saw them, opening for Andrew WK, and I thought, ""these dudes are like Motörhead doing Ride The Lightning"".   Baroness has toured with them in Australia, but it'd be great for them to tour the US, so they could get exposed to a bigger audience out here."
Metallica,2u68hq,CrentistTheDentist,2,Sat Jan 31 20:14:04 2015 UTC,"I've always thought about HOF as Motorhead and Slayer's child, but I think I like your Motorhead doing Ride the Lightning comparison better, heh."

If anything, they'd probably prefer that electronic artists use more guitar than dance pop samples. The closer to metal the better."

I told my brother once that  if he's having a bad day, to listen to any of the first four albums, and it makes any troubles just disappear.    We've been regularly listening to Metallica since about the summer of 1989 (we were little dudes of 9 and 6 and our aunt made us tapes of Master Of Puppets and Justice), and they, especially the first four and Garage Days Re-Revisited, remind me of a time when there were no real worries in my world.   GI Joe battles set to ""Disposable Heroes"" and ""One""...    Good times."

Metallica,2tzrtc,metroidmen,2,Thu Jan 29 10:03:59 2015 UTC,"I saw Metallica live for the first time during this period.  They were touring Australia toward the end of 2003 (i think it was 03) and they played St Anger twice during the set.  It didn't take too well, but whenever they played anything from Justice or earlier the crowd was just going wild.    I've been listening to Metallica since I was 10 years old (...and Justice for All had just launched) and I will always be a fan no matter what direction they take but I will always love the first four albums the most purely because they were the albums that I listened to during that tormenting adolescent stage of my life.  I am also a huge fan of Megadeth from Killing is my Business to Rust in Piece for the exact same reasons.  Out of their new stuff, the Day that Never Comes would have to be my favourite.  It's just a musical masterpiece and I love every part of it."

Metallica,2tzrtc,Metallicarox,3,Wed Jan 28 22:24:49 2015 UTC,"2008, my second Metallica show... I was a fucking wreck. I'd been standing for hours, tired as fuck, was dehydrated, hadn't eaten, and to top it all off, I'd started my period the day of the show. I eventually got so sick that the concert security wanted to call me an ambulance. I almost threw up three times and nearly fainted twice just in the 45 minute wait for Metallica to show up after Lamb of God left the stage (which by the way is a fucking ridiculously long time to make people wait).  My mom digs Metallica and I was still too young to do much by myself so she was with me, although she didn't really hang around me too much. She let me and my best friend at the time be but she knew I was feeling sick and getting worse. My mom refused to let me go to the hospital because she knew I would miss Metallica and would regret it forever. I laid on the cement because I was burning up but then I froze so she covered me with her jackets (she gets cold easy and it was December), and when Metallica finally hit the stage she demanded my friend take me to go see the laser light show they'd put up.  It's like she and my friend had a mental connection somehow because he took me to a mosh pit, wrapped my arms around his waist, and dragged me up close. One guy saw us, laughed, and said to me, ""HOLD ON TIGHT!"" and (gently) shoved us into the middle of the pit. We got bashed around some before the pit kinda moved over and we got left on the outskirts of it. I felt completely fine. No trace of the fever, of the shakes, of fainting... Gone. I sent him a text (even though my arm was still around him) saying ""Metallica cures everything"" and when he got it he smiled at me and nodded. It was ""our thing"" for a long time. We knew the secret. The secret cure to everything.  I'm glad he and I weren't the only ones who have experienced that magic medicine :) I mean obviously lots of people feel mentally better when they hear Metallica but they cure physical ailments too! Lol.. although maybe mine was just because I'd been standing still for five hours and was dehydrated and my blood had pooled in my legs and I needed to move around more.... but still!  TL;DR Metallica cures everything."

I'm sure if I listen to Metallica long enough that it will grow on me.  I think music is very therapeutic in that it can help you feel less lonely and give emotional support. For example, when you're dealing with breakups you would want to listen to Taylor Swift, since she is known for singing about heartaches, breakups, etc.   Music helps because you can relate to the emotions and hardships conveyed."

I've put a lot of time into really embracing Metallica's sound and lyrics over the past month or two. It started out with exclusively replaying the Black Album for a few weeks, but after watching Some Kind of Monster and learning about the tumultuous past these guys have weathered has helped me to look to their music as an even stronger source of support as I start to deal with my own alcoholism."

Metallica,2tsems,serosis,3,Tue Jan 27 03:57:01 2015 UTC,"This lady should show up at a Metallica concert backstage. Show herself to Kirk with this makeup... He'd freak out and say ""Holy shit! It's practically the spittin' image of me! This is so dope!"", Lol."
Metallica,2tsems,DealWithItbot,4,Tue Jan 27 05:49:31 2015 UTC,As a Metallica fan this is just fucken amazing lol. If only she could do Lars next
Metallica,2ttih4,rd1994,8,Tue Jan 27 07:26:52 2015 UTC,"See, that's the whole catch 22 of making music: you keep consistent and people get bored; you change things up, and people accuse you of selling out. Either way, people will find a way to dislike a band, no matter what they do."
Metallica,2ttih4,Bob_The_Zombie,2,Tue Jan 27 14:16:54 2015 UTC,"Perfectly explained.   People hate on bands like Muse, The black keys, Arctic monkeys, Linkin Park, Weezer and whatever people like these days, for changing their sound and experimenting a bit (in most cases, adding more electronic sounds and what not) but to me, as a Linkin Park fan since Meteora, the albums after it (Meteora) are pretty good, they're not bad, they're good, in some cases some songs are better than some songs on Hybrid theory or Meteora.   Basically, fans are ungrateful bunch of cunts. And those people are the people who complain about things you mentioned (keeping the same sound since debut / changing sound after a few albums), and thats why I love PJ Harvey, different sound on each album and it always worked.  They are also ignorant too (see: RHCP fans, or should I call them, John Frusciante fans because they don't fit into RHCP fans)   In this case; JF quit RHCP in 2009, his friend Josh who toured with them in most of the final leg of 2007 tour thus allowing them to play some songs where John recorded 2 guitars, fans didn't like the album with Josh, hate on him, calling him ""unable to play guitar"", acting like John is the one who founded the band citing ""The band isn't the same since he left"" while actually he joined them in late 1988/9 just because Hilel (founding guitarist) died due to drug overdose, but John is the one who brought them popularity and fame.  TL;DR: Fans should be grateful to the fact that the bands decided to continue making music whatever it sounds, I don't care if you dislike the new Black keys album because ""it doesnt sound like the other albums"", that's why it's good, because it stands out from the rest.  /rant over"
Metallica,2ttih4,Gamerhcp,15,Tue Jan 27 14:46:55 2015 UTC,"Metallica changing their sound was a brilliant move. They not only survived the 90's because of it, but were actually relevant throughout the whole decade. They didn't get stuck playing shit that sounds like it belongs in the 80's like Megadeth did and still does. Load and Reload are two of the best rock albums to come out in the 90's. The only reason no one recognizes that is because butthurt fans wanted them to pump out the same type of music they did in the 80's. Metallica knew better. Not many bands can or have put out great music like they have so consistently in almost a 30 year span. I'm actually really hoping this new album is stylistically different from Death Magnetic and doesn't feel like Death Magnetic II."
Metallica,2ttih4,kevonicus,3,Wed Jan 28 02:08:40 2015 UTC,Well said.
Metallica,2ttih4,kirkemg,3,Wed Jan 28 12:50:03 2015 UTC,"That's why they are the best. They are just miles ahead of the other bands in this regard. They just have better vision than anyone else. Love him or hate him, lars is a genius"
Metallica,2ttih4,earthwormjim91,2,Fri Jan 30 00:57:20 2015 UTC,"Very much agreed. I really liked DM. It was a nice ""rebound"" from st anger (even though i liked that too). I very much hope the new album is as equally stylistically different though i dont think it will be. I'd love a Load DM style mix. Load has so much raw emotion it's palpable. DM has the composition that made them famous"
Metallica,2ttih4,MoBaconMoProblems,5,Wed Jan 28 15:32:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that they don't like Jason. In fact, Jason is pretty much known for bringing a huge stage presence and energy, and is loved for it. Rob is different, but brings his own personality. Cliff, well, Cliff was Cliff.  Lars' drum sound was just so different on _ St. Anger_ that many people found it offputting. I loved it, but I can see why people would hate it. It isn't how a snare is supposed to sound and it sounded like a fucked up, high pitched tom tom."
Metallica,2ttih4,Matthew94,2,Tue Jan 27 07:52:26 2015 UTC,"Even the Three said if Rob had been around in the beginning, Cliff might not have made the cut.  Strong words."
Metallica,2ttih4,MoBaconMoProblems,3,Wed Feb 4 03:18:35 2015 UTC,Sure some might say opinions differ   Yup. That's about it.
Metallica,2ttih4,kevonicus,2,Tue Jan 27 16:32:24 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. And yet, here we are, 20+ years down the road, still going 'round and 'round about it."
Metallica,2ttih4,serosis,3,Wed Feb 4 03:21:22 2015 UTC,"I don't listen to Metallica for bass. I love ""Anesthesia"" as much as the next guy and Jason was a cool dude, but I was just praising the gods when he left that one of the other members didn't leave. I really like Rob as well,  but James, Lars and Kirk are more indispensable than any bass player. It just wouldn't be the same without one of them but wouldn't really make a difference who you put on bass."
Metallica,2ttih4,MoBaconMoProblems,2,Wed Jan 28 01:59:55 2015 UTC,"Well I was saying something similar in my rant. Was I was talking about was basically that people make it such a big deal. I mean it would, like you said, far more obvious if Kirk was fired/decided to quit. And also. Lars say he is not a good drummer. I think he is not a flashy drummer. Like 4 bars but 24 drumfills. (yeah I know that makes no sense I am just looking for an example to make my point clear) so maybe just keeping the main verse beat etc."
Metallica,2ttih4,TerrrorTwlight,2,Wed Jan 28 12:51:28 2015 UTC,It would make a difference if Flea got the gig.  Could you imagine how funky Metallica would be?
Metallica,2ttih4,tombstone23,2,Fri Jan 30 14:09:34 2015 UTC,Changing a bass player can make a huge difference. Bass is the groove. Bass is the feel of the song. Bass is massively important.
Metallica,2ttih4,Metallicarox,3,Wed Feb 4 03:20:38 2015 UTC,"I appreciate their need to switch up their music a bit over the years. I'm sure playing the same style for 30 years would've gotten boring. That being said, I still can't get into St. Anger. I like Load and Reload, they each have some great stuff on them. I love the Black album and Death Magnetic.  I agree about the bass players."

Metallica,2ttih4,thechariot83,2,Tue Jan 27 13:38:38 2015 UTC,"me too. I was 13 or so when i got the load album and that was my first real intro to metallica.. after that I heard One and my life changed drastically after that.  I am glad I came late to the party.. I am able to embrace all of their albums with open ears, whereas some of the older fans have stopped listening since justice.. which is a shame.   also, I love each of their bassists. We were blessed to enjoy 3 awesome bassists. They all have their own style and all bring something different to the table.   Im hoping the new album has different styles on it.. I do enjoy their heavy songs quite a bit, but i would like a few softer ones in the mix."
Metallica,2ttih4,awesomemgy,2,Tue Jan 27 14:23:28 2015 UTC,"Even though I started listening to them around 2012, with reload being the first album I listened to, I like all their albums, even lulu. I'm glad some bands change their styles over the years. I feel St. anger is it's own unique album, but people really hate lulu because lou reed clashes with metallica's vocals and instruments,but open-minded listeners appreciate the album for what it is."

Metallica,2t0ssq,BaldEagle88,5,Tue Jan 20 05:24:03 2015 UTC,"They could have still done it on vinyl. Pink Floyd did pretty much the same thing on The Wall.  I agree though, the Blackened intro sounds cool both backwards and forwards."
Metallica,2t0ssq,justifiabledefiance,1 point,Tue Jan 20 11:45:08 2015 UTC,"But you would have to flip the vinyl over, wouldn't you. Defeating the purpose of it automatically repeating to create the endless loop."
Metallica,2t0ssq,LHodge,2,Tue Jan 20 17:20:09 2015 UTC,"Run a closed groove on the B-Side so the reversed intro runs indefinitely, maybe? That would kind of help."
Metallica,2t0ssq,justifiabledefiance,1 point,Tue Jan 20 17:29:47 2015 UTC,"Yes but the idea that it loops is still there for whoever is listening. Doing it on vinyl isn't the easiest or best way to do it, but it was obvious on The Wall. It's done in a way so you can tell the album is supposed to loop."

Metallica,2suzav,TerrrorTwlight,2,Sun Jan 18 21:58:30 2015 UTC,It will never happen. Plus all performances are pre-recorded. Not sure if metallica would be down with that. If you recall last year the  red hot chili peppers instruments weren't even plugged in...
Metallica,2suzav,Ktulu85,1 point,Sun Jan 18 22:37:26 2015 UTC,If you recall last year the red hot chili peppers instruments weren't even plugged in...   Lol really? That's sad. Did RHCP not know about it? I can't see them going along with something like that.
Metallica,2suzav,arrocknroll,1 point,Mon Jan 19 21:32:52 2015 UTC,Yea they knew but flea kinda justified it. (link below if interested in his comments). Still...  I wouldn't want to see metallica do it. The magic of the four Horsemen is that they sound better live than they do on tape.  http://redhotchilipeppers.com/news/454-a-message-from-flea
Metallica,2suzav,DavidTyreesHelmet,3,Mon Jan 19 22:06:07 2015 UTC,"I honestly wouldn't want Metallica to do it.  The big reason that they have more pop stars over rock stars is because they always do a prerecorded track for everything that isn't vocals.  It's too much preparation to sound check for instruments and get all of that right. Just look at last year with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  They came out with instruments unplugged.  Basically the only one to be performing would be James on vocals.  That's not what Metallica is about.  They're about raw and engaging live performances not scripted playback ""performances.""  I would much rather see a real Metallica performance somewhere that isn't the Super Bowl because that is what they do best (Although not going to lie, seeing the entire stadium chant DIE during Creeping Death or singing along to Master of Puppets would be really cool).  Let the pop stars play the half time show.  That is what their style of performances are made for."
Metallica,2suzav,FrostFire131,1 point,Mon Jan 19 05:02:44 2015 UTC,"Besides as sexist or whatever you wanna say it is, the halftime show is usually for the ladies and kids n all that, so they usually try to get performers that females will like over metal bands like Metallica. Gotta get that extra non sports fan audience"

Metallica,2suzav,bruhimhigh,1 point,Sun Jan 18 22:27:49 2015 UTC,"Another thing to consider here is that they have those pop stars and such at halftime to get a new audience in.

Metallica,2ssw4a,arrocknroll,2,Sun Jan 18 04:22:41 2015 UTC,can you explain what you did? what do you mean you took away the ping and clipping?
Metallica,2ssw4a,The-Nidoking,3,Mon Jan 19 21:13:33 2015 UTC,"Sure. I took the multitrack from guitar hero and first brought each of the individual tracks into Adobe Audition to adjust what I needed to.  To reduce the ping (the snare drum), I dropped the mids of the drum track a little bit so it wasn't as jarring and I used tube exciting to make the symbols pop out more.  Clipping is the phenomenon that occurs when a track is louder than the file can handle and it creates a scratching/popping/distorted sound where there shouldn't be.  Since most if not all of the clipping occurred in the guitar track, I used some mild clipping restoration and that seemed to fix most of it.  I also widened out the guitars and made the bass and treble EQ more pronounced so it sounded bigger. Once that was done, I put all of the tracks into one multitrack and began mixing and mastering it all to make it sound balanced. That largely consisted of just messing with volumes here and there to make sure all of the instruments stayed where they should and didn't overpower the other ones.  The finished result of all that is what you see here."

Same with Infected Nation, I like up until the 1:16 mark and then lose interest.  I do love In Memorium and my personal favorite Cult.  I prefer this style of vocals over the first two I posted."
Metallica,2stamh,SportzTawk,6,Sun Jan 18 19:41:41 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, Tool is the only band I love more than Metallica, and also the best band I've ever seen live (Jan 2013 @ Melbourne). I've never seen Metallica live though hopefully this changes in the future, especially if they tour with a new album!  Also love Mastodon, Rob Zombie, Pantera, Queens of the Stone Age, Slayer, Amon Amarth, Black Sabbath and pretty much anything from the 80's hardcore punk scene, like Black Flag and The Circle Jerks, and modern day ones like OFF!.  Also ambient/new age is fucking awesome."

Metallica,2stamh,arrocknroll,3,Sun Jan 18 09:38:55 2015 UTC,"My other two go to bands are Iron Maiden and Avenged Sevenfold.  Iron Maiden because they are absolute masters at crafting many different kinds of songs.  Everything from songs like The Trooper, a galloping ass kicker that you can bang your head to to huge epics like Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, Dance of Death, or When The Wild Wind Blows that leave me speechless every time.  Avenged Sevenfold because they are like a middle ground between Metallica and Iron Maiden in the best of ways. Except of course for their first two albums which are just straight up metalcore."

Metallica,2soxko,MrGonghen,1 point,Sat Jan 17 03:12:28 2015 UTC,Thanks :D Yea I saw that and I really liked it! I'm actually listening to St. Anger right now haha. They did a really good job with that and it was really impressive.
Metallica,2soxko,kirkedout,1 point,Sat Jan 17 03:49:45 2015 UTC,"Hey man, you got a link to what you're talking about? Would love to hear it"
Metallica,2soxko,Domin129pl,2,Sat Jan 17 14:31:47 2015 UTC,This is nice - finally a re-mastered version without the bass being ultra up in your face. Me likey.
Metallica,2soxko,willardd,1 point,Sat Jan 17 12:45:27 2015 UTC,I'm no professional audio guy or anything like that.  Just a high schooler with some nice hardware and some spare time. I did a Death Magnetic remaster a while ago that got fairly popular on youtube and I recently started work on an ...And Justice for All remaster.  I used Blackened as a test track to mess around with some settings that I will hopefully use on the rest of the album as well.  I tried to give it a better sound stage and spread it out so it doesn't sound as cluttered.  I also wanted to preserve the original tone of it to some extent so it sounds like something that could have actually happened for this album had it been mixed and mastered better. And of course I mixed in a proper bass track too.  I know there is already And Justice for Jason but the creator said that he didn't make it to be a proper mix. He created it to compare the bass track to the rest of the music and that's what I got from it.  This is meant to be a more proper mix that is more pleasing to the ear.  Let me know what you think!
Metallica,2soxko,Bob_The_Zombie,1 point,Sat Jan 17 01:43:59 2015 UTC,did you just use the original song as the master?
Metallica,2soxko,bassface69,3,Sat Jan 17 05:45:25 2015 UTC,"Yea basically.  Like I said, this was just a little test run.  I found an isolated bass track for Jason and mixed that into the song.  Then I widened it, messed with the EQ a little bit to give it a slightly bigger sound and let the solos stand out, and added a little reverb so it didn't sound as dry.  I wanted to make it sound like what it would have sounded like if they had done it a little better.  I could have changed it completely but I didn't want to make it sound over processed and filled with unnecessary effects.  I only did what I felt was necessary.  I did find the isolated tracks for the rest of the band too so I'll hopefully be able to do a much better job and actually do a proper remaster instead of a little tiddy-up ""remaster."" I know that it's not a true remaster but I don't know what else to call it and I did the best that I could do with the given resources."
Metallica,2sp8pa,LUCID_FUCKING_DREAMS,10,Sat Jan 17 03:27:32 2015 UTC,Unforgiven and Unforgiven II would be my vote. Can't get much closer than two songs that were written to sound similar.
Metallica,2sp8pa,Vickshow,5,Sat Jan 17 05:05:34 2015 UTC,"Definitely portions, especially thematically and with the horn at the start. Key difference, though, is that UNF 1 has a fast verse and slow chorus, whereas UNF 2 has a slow verse and a fast chorus. Or maybe heavy instead of fast. Either way, my point is that they're shockingly structured in opposites."
Metallica,2sp8pa,watties12,9,Sat Jan 17 09:15:59 2015 UTC,"There was an occasion in which even James got confused, and started with the intro to One, but wound up playing Fade To Black.

Metallica,2sp8pa,RJB6,2,Sat Jan 17 12:31:49 2015 UTC,You can pretty much swap the lyrics and they fit right in.
Metallica,2sp8pa,Matthew2470,1 point,Mon Jan 19 19:35:08 2015 UTC,"The structure is pretty exact, and if it were not for King Nothing's key being in E flat it would share some of the same melody as well.  If they were both in the same key they would be hovering around E minor with a diminished 5th(augmented 4th?) and flatted 2nd thrown in for good measure. Although King Nothing is a bit more complex."

There are some interesting insights but otherwise it is a tl;dr of the movie.  EDIT:  Something else to note, the main movie is still in 4:3 resolution and the extras disk is still a DVD. I do not even now if they used the original footage to upscale it to ""HD"". They do not even say. It could just be an upconversion straight from the DVD.  I mainly bought it to replace my old DVD which has a tiny scratch that makes it completely stop mid-movie and locks up my blu-ray player."

If I could arrange a setlist for them, I'd stick with a few tried and true live staples, (because I'm not the only one in the audience, and you have to please everyone a little) and at least 5 songs that'd make us lifers say ""Oh shit!

Metallica is tough, I'm thinking Holier Than Thou (that was going to be the title track after all) or maybe Through The Never, although the actual track isn't the best in the album.  Load would probably be Thorn Within, even if it isn't my favourite track from the album.  Reload would be either Devils Dance or Memory Remains Death Magnetic would be All Nightmare Long, although Suicide and Redemption fits it quite well and I also think Cyanide could potentially be there too.   I guess with those albums there wasn't a title track as such, in all of the track titled albums there was always one track that they thought was good enough to name the album after. Another thing I've noticed is that in all the track titled albums the title track is always second, so in Lightning it's after Fire, in Master it's after Battery, in Justice it's after Blackened and in St. Anger it's after Frantic."

With that said, even though I like these covers a lot (and hey extra points for covering all of SA instead of another MOP cover), the tone is so similar to nearly every other metal band playing at the moment that it loses its bite."

Metallica,2sb1p4,Mostly-Harmlessish,3,Tue Jan 13 22:34:31 2015 UTC,"Ditto, especially after watching the Some Kind of Monster documentary. It's so raw and angry and honest."
Metallica,2sb1p4,PopPop-Magnitude,5,Wed Jan 14 12:22:28 2015 UTC,Im with you. The original sound has a punch to it that I dont think most people here are getting. The songs dont have the same emotions oozing out of them
Metallica,2sb1p4,dujayy,7,Wed Jan 14 02:42:35 2015 UTC,"A comment I read on UG about this cover summed it up well   ""this remix succeeds in neutering the album of one of its most notable and, in my opinion, poignant element: that damn snare drum! without that snare to emphasize the rage in this album, St. Anger has become St. Slightly Annoyed""  Note: That was part of a larger quote, but I only included the point that was relevant to your comment."
Metallica,2sb1p4,PopPop-Magnitude,4,Wed Jan 14 03:12:53 2015 UTC,"That's actually exactly what I feel. St anger speaks to me because of the raw emotion in not just James'voice but also the instruments. They're essentially trading the soul of the record for better mixing. Trust me when I say that if they wanted that production, Bob rock could have more than easily provided it"
Metallica,2sb1p4,Seiryth,2,Wed Jan 14 03:16:38 2015 UTC,"while i did appreciate the album's honesty and rawness, i also was annoyed with the band. it felt like they were trying to do a ""record everything in one take"" and then chickened out, leaving us with this weird middle band of looped performances and some unfortunately phoned in performances.   this shows, to me anyway, that had the band been in better shape with their chops (they hadnt played live for years during this record), it could have been a tighter album.   this re-recording shows that the riffs, melodies and beats were all there, it was just in limbo between a raw performance and a lazy one.   edit: just wanted to add that personally, it wasnt actually the production or snare that irked me, just the lazy playing from the band overall."
Metallica,2sb1p4,msv0112,0,Wed Jan 14 10:02:28 2015 UTC,"Not my favourite album, but artisticly I think Metallica did a great job in terms of making songs that had meaning to them at the time. Those songs werent ""good"", the lyrics werent ""good"", but all in all they had an emotion. An emotion wich is raw and angry/frustrating. And looking at the film ""Some kind of a monster"", I think they did a really good job at making music for them selves, and one of the biggest key points for making music I think is to come out with an emotion (where the audience feels the same or they dont). This is where Metallica did a great job, conveying emotion into art in form of music.  Another reason why people hate it so much is because at the time people wanted ""old"" Metallica back, and when they heard St.Anger they closed their ears and threw it out as crap. (Not that it aint crap, its just crap with emotion attached). And when a lot of people hate on something a lot more of people tend to join the wave of hate because its easier that way.  and thats my ramble of the day. Good day, Sir... I said GOOD DAY!"

Metallica,2s7esq,mrhomeless97,2,Tue Jan 13 01:09:42 2015 UTC,I played the intro to Battery on bass. Here it is EDIT I see you wanted the riff too. Here's that
Metallica,2s7esq,metroidmen,2,Wed Jan 14 02:31:48 2015 UTC,I have just gotten a blister from learning the song. Hopefully I can record it before the deadline.

Either someone (or some people) are genuinely bothered because we've been taking so long (due to unexpected life changes, as life tends to be), or their upset because we want this to be a well-done project and can't be a part of it due to a lack of recording gear. For that we do apologize."

Metallica,2s7esq,metroidmen,1 point,Sun Feb 8 06:01:14 2015 UTC,"probably.  I'd say rather than this whole audition thing we record some stuff (put up a post on how to get a decent recording using minimal gear, set some keys and standard timings) and upload to soundcloud. Anyone that can't play but is handy in pro tools or logic can have a crack at mixing and we get some songs in.  I'm cool if life takes priority but there's been no update and it's nearly 3 weeks past the deadline."
Metallica,2s7esq,Andju,1 point,Thu Feb 19 06:52:29 2015 UTC,I recorded mine on an ipad. I'm sure any recent phone could be just as good (for guitar).  All you need do is center a mic on the cone of your amp 3-5cm away from the mesh. Adjust the volume until you can record without clipping and record away.  Garageband on the ipad has a VU meter built in but I'm sure 5 minutes with google can dig up some other VU (voice recorder? although not sure about the recording bitrate for that)

Metallica,2s7esq,HarvestedSorrows,-3,Tue Jan 13 23:30:40 2015 UTC,"Well, for one thing, I completely disagree with your initial post. We wouldn't set such standards for the audition if we ourselves weren't ready and willing to live up to said standards. We are both capable players with decent gear.  That aside, we are posting our auditions in order to get feedback from everyone who wants to be involved. If by Sunday we have enough guitar entries, with two additional guitarists who's skill and tone/gear far surpass ours (and I am by no means bragging about myself or /u/ImJunKz) then we will have them take our place."

I used amplitube for mac to record it (so I have access to basically every tone possible) and logic pro to combine the guitar and the drum/bass/vocal track I downloaded. I already know how to play most of the songs on Metallica's more popular albums so this medley should be a blast!
Metallica,2s7esq,Peasant-Slayer,1 point,Sun Jan 18 03:40:31 2015 UTC,Is there a time limit on this?  Might be worth giving a bit of time for people to learn the song if they don't know it.  I won't be entering due to a lack of skill and equipment but best of luck to those who do.

Metallica,2s7esq,ZBGB,0,Tue Jan 13 08:08:52 2015 UTC,Record what you can. It doesn't have to be the whole song. The reason we chose Battery was because it's a song that can show us two things: that you don't have a problem getting a decent tone and that you don't have a problem playing speedy riffs.

Please note that I did these one after another and under extreme time constraints, so it won't sound the prettiest. The mic I used is low quality but with some time I could get it sounding better. And also if I wasn't fatigued even before starting, it would have gone much smoother...  Take 1   Take 2   Take 3  Note: I don't sound this sloppy on most songs; I didn't have any time to practice and did each of these in one take without editing."

It's like a MIDI version of the song that a person has transcribed.  I'd start with the basic ones like For Whom the Bell Tolls and Enter Sandman. Maybe even Fuel. It really depends on how complicated you want to get. I'm sure even the simplest songs have some interesting bass parts."

Metallica,2s4b9e,jnoble_05,3,Mon Jan 12 05:58:49 2015 UTC,"For sure, SKOM was wicked, introduced my partner to Metallica with it. She was mega disappointed when they didn't play any of the songs when we first saw them together."
Metallica,2s4b9e,Hetstaine,2,Mon Jan 12 13:51:08 2015 UTC,I too enjoyed St. Anger.
Metallica,2s4b9e,DanTheMan_622,2,Mon Jan 12 07:09:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's their best, but it certainly isn't bad.  Am I the only one who likes the drum sound though?"
Metallica,2s4b9e,brainandforce,1 point,Tue Jan 13 17:28:50 2015 UTC,Nope. I love it. It works great for the tone of the album.
Metallica,2s4b9e,jnoble_05,1 point,Tue Jan 13 21:01:50 2015 UTC,"St. Anger was the first album they released after I became a Metallica fan. So it holds a higher place in my heart than what came before.  I bought it the day it came out and listened the shit out of it. St. Anger was the album that finally sparked my ass into gear when it came to learning the guitar. At that point I had an accessible starting point, although interestingly enough I did not learn any of St. Anger first. I actually learned Eye of he Beholder first then I learned most of St. Anger after."
Metallica,2s4b9e,serosis,1 point,Sun Jan 18 05:12:48 2015 UTC,I have to be in a certain mood to enjoy it. It can be a little annoying sounding if you're not in the right mindset.
Metallica,2s4b9e,kevonicus,8,Mon Jan 12 10:47:24 2015 UTC,I've been listening to most of LuLu again lately. I still honestly think over time it's reputation will grow. I mean St. Anger has grown on people. But people need to remember. This was a Lou Reed album. Metallica just happened to be playing on it. Iced Honey is awesome as is Dragon.
Metallica,2s4b9e,PhantomLordJD,4,Mon Jan 12 07:36:28 2015 UTC,"Dude, in 25 years, Lulu will be praised by critics the same way Lou Reed's album Berlin is.  It will be called ""Brave"" and ""way ahead of its time"".  It's just a weird album, with some really cool sounds going on."
Metallica,2s4b9e,weirdmountain,2,Tue Jan 13 14:52:23 2015 UTC,"This.  It was Lou Reed and Metallica, not Metallica and Lou Reed."
Metallica,2s4b9e,Fapstronaut_TK_421,3,Mon Jan 12 11:15:36 2015 UTC,Link. In case anyone actually wants to listen.  Which I wouldn't really recommend.
Metallica,2s4b9e,deathmonkey,2,Mon Jan 12 16:08:26 2015 UTC,"I wish I were not on a shitty Dell Optiplex(GX260 if you must know) or I would actually watch that video. Fuck it, I watched it even with the skipping audio.  Never really thought of it the way he puts it, which is odd because ever since The Black Album Metallica have doing whatever the fuck they wanted without any regard to what the outcome is.  The only times Metallica ever does fan service is through their live shows, fan cans, meet & greets, and the extra shit they release. (E.G. Mission: Metallica, Beyond Magnetic, and The Lords of Summer.)  Although I disagree with his assumption that Metallica were more improvisational than they usually are on the album. The mainstay of Metallica is that they are almost completely improvisational. Literally almost at all times when they are not replaying a song live, and sometimes even then.  I rank Lulu higher than Anthony did, simply because I am a Metallica sheep who loves practically everything they put out. 7.5/10"
Metallica,2s4b9e,serosis,2,Sun Jan 18 05:06:32 2015 UTC,"Some interesting thoughts but I think this misses the mark.  The album sounds like Lou and Metallica just presumed they would know how to work with each others' material since they are both rock veterans and didn't do any research about how best to gel their styles. Lou is clearly out of his depth, he hears some familiar blues motifs in the Metallica riffs but doesn't know how to groove to the rhythm they are using so he sorta wails little half hearted pentatonic runs in between spoken passages. It sounds like he's grasping for a way to fit into the music because he is. Metallica, on the other side, seem to just be playing what they want without any consideration about how it works with the choruses or verses of Lou's ""songs"". I still feel the blame lies squarely with Lou. He has this attitude that rock n' roll ""just happens"" and there's little need to think about it. He has always had inconsistent results with that philosophy even back to his Velvet Underground days. If you're Dave Navarro and regularly produce good performances without practicing that much then you can get away with that sorta thing. For Lou, he might've pulled it off had Metallica emulated the older Velvet Underground repetition closer... but when thrown into a completely different musical style, he was just plain overconfident that he could use his old bag of tricks.  All that said, I would love to get the raw tracks from these sessions and see what could be salvaged by creative editing in ProTools. (Making chorus sections sync better, changing tempos to match dynamics, etc). Or make two albums, a Lou Reed album with retro style arrangements and a Metallica album with some James impersonator doing vocals."

Not really sure what the deal is wi the Freddy mask but man oh man is this guy into tune with Cliff's mastery of that song.  Didn't really realize that Ktulu was so Cliff-centric; he essentially carries the whole song and bursts through about fifteen times, such beautiful bass, a shame that he is gone.  Great job this bass player does, he's right into it and nails it."
Metallica,2rytcu,JeepBike,2,Sat Jan 10 22:26:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know what the deal is with the Freddy mask either, but the guy is great. He does a damn nice job of Orion, too...   http://youtu.be/qIEJe_s_VTY"

Metallica,2rytcu,designerdy,3,Sun Jan 11 03:56:23 2015 UTC,"As much as I admired Jason, you're right. He wrote some great tracks but he could never really nail cliffs parts the same way.  His bass skills never really shined. It's like he is a diet coke version of cliff. He may of been holding Metallica back a bit when it came to live performances. Don't get me wrong, he's a beast... But it's no coincidence that we started hearing live of versions of Orion"

Metallica,2ryf7v,Hordiyevych,4,Sat Jan 10 13:47:10 2015 UTC,"Fucking great album closer, too. Finishes the album on a real dire and heavy note, a perfect ending to such a dark and complex album."
Metallica,2ryf7v,Matthew94,7,Sat Jan 10 21:08:34 2015 UTC,I'd say Wherever I May Roam has great imagery. The lyrics give me a real Mad Max vibe.
Metallica,2ryf7v,provi,4,Sat Jan 10 13:51:42 2015 UTC,"In terms of pure emotion, ""To Live Is To Die"" and ""Fade To Black"" would be at the top. ""One"" is absolutely incredible in terms of both imagery and emotion. Those are some of the more obvious ones.   ""Fixxxer"" is one of my favourite songs from the later era. It's filled with some pretty incredible imagery, and the vocals for one of the last lines always really resonated with me. Around 7:10, for ""fix this hoooolllleeee in a mother's son"", the way James holds that one note gets me every time."
Metallica,2ryf7v,RKRagan,3,Sat Jan 10 21:00:18 2015 UTC,"""The trash fire is warm  But nowhere safe from the storm""  and  ""So you bring this poor dog in from the rain  Though he just wants right back out again""  Both of them give me chills, with images of a man shaking in the cold and full of regret."
Metallica,2ryf7v,decytv,3,Sun Jan 11 03:55:15 2015 UTC,Fade to Black for me.  The feels get me every time.
Metallica,2ryf7v,LUCID_FUCKING_DREAMS,3,Sun Jan 11 04:27:17 2015 UTC,"Disposable Heroes I think for me was a really well-written song of emotion, lyrically. Same goes for Fade To Black, especially after hearing about the backstory with James' suicidal thoughts.  As for imagery, St. Anger is right up there for me, definitely brings forwards thoughts about times of dire stress and conflict."
Metallica,2ryf7v,TrentGgrims,1 point,Sun Jan 11 13:09:15 2015 UTC,The Unnamed Feeling and All Within My Hands off of St. Anger also have some extreme emotions.

Metallica,2rvj0c,JHallComics,5,Fri Jan 9 18:12:40 2015 UTC,"dude, that was fucking awesome!!! i have a feeling they will.. Metallica has been very cool about allowing themselves to be captured on film these days.. It's almost as if they  want us to be part of the band. They were very hesitant to create ""a year and a half in the life of metallica"", but that definitely opened up the gates. After Some kind of Monster came out I think they realized how healthy it was for them to allow them cameras in their world. I honestly will be a very sad man if they dont keep up the filming process."
Metallica,2rvj0c,JHallComics,2,Fri Jan 9 20:43:35 2015 UTC,Yeah it was like the 5 months of Christmas when Mission Metallica was running.

Metallica,2rvj0c,weirdmountain,2,Sat Jan 10 03:01:46 2015 UTC,HBO series like they did for the new Foo Fighters album. That'd be sweet. Or even if they just did a 2 hour special or something.
Metallica,2rvj0c,DavidTyreesHelmet,19,Tue Jan 13 03:57:51 2015 UTC,"I don't care when they put it out.   Not that I don't want new Metallica, because I do - but there should be no pressure on them.  I hope they pull a Radiohead or a D'Angelo, and actually have a finished album up their sleeves and just release it, rather than telling us the day they start recording, and update us every 3 days about how far along they are.     It's an album recording process, not a pregnancy."
Metallica,2rvj0c,give_him_room_hooper,7,Fri Jan 9 19:31:52 2015 UTC,you are right.. The black album didnt have a time frame on it. They kind of just recorded it until it was done. I want their best. No rush...take your time but hurry up lol.

You need to train your downpicking a lot to be able to keep up with it the proper way.  I've been playing guitar for... jesus, almost 12 years. I used to be able to nail MoP when I'd been playing for some 4-5 years, but when I made a cover of it last summer I really struggled with it because I had been playing physically less demanding stuff for a long time, even though I'm a much better player over all.

Metallica,2rfg5o,yoda46986,9,Mon Jan 5 19:26:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely The Unforgiven III. The song is already setup perfectly for an orchestra, with the piano intro and violins in certain sections. I'd love a prolonged breakdown with greater emphasis on the symphony. One can only dream."
Metallica,2rfg5o,ShtupidCow,4,Mon Jan 5 20:48:44 2015 UTC,"Yea! Great idea! I forgot about that one. The part where he goes ""Forgive Me...Forgive Me Not"" would be awesome with the orchestra. I don't get the hate against that song. It's awesome!"
Metallica,2rfg5o,bardyTV,4,Mon Jan 5 20:55:36 2015 UTC,An epic Unforgiven suite!! all three parts with one of those things at the end thats all musically joined together using those words used in classical music that i dont know!

Metallica,2rfg5o,Hordiyevych,1 point,Tue Jan 6 07:59:04 2015 UTC,The reason why I chose this one was because if the middle part where James solos had some flutes and trombones it would be totally nasty!
Metallica,2rfg5o,Machinax,2,Tue Jan 6 16:25:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of those, I Disappear would also he added to that in my version, although I think with some of them it would be very difficult to add in an orchestra. I'm no musician but stuff like Dyers Eve, although I love that song and would love to see them try, I can't see an orchestra there."
Metallica,2rfg5o,weirdmountain,2,Tue Jan 6 00:57:53 2015 UTC,"I'd toss the out-and-out heavy songs right out the window. They didn't work on the original S&M, and I can't see songs like ""St. Anger"" and ""Broken, Beat & Scarred"" benefitting from having 100+ other instruments behind them.   My choices would be almost exclusively from Load and ReLoad. The instrumentation and arrangements on those albums is already so lush and layered, that an orchestra would fit perfectly. Barring a few notable exceptions, the songs from the pure thrash metal days simply do not allow any kind of breathing space for the myriad melodies that an orchestral arrangement would bring to the table. I dread to think how a symphony would sound trying to play ""Dyers Eve.""  Put a string section behind a song like ""Mama Said"", however, and you're in business.   Throw in ""Junior Dad"" off Lulu, too."
Metallica,2rfg5o,Machinax,1 point,Wed Jan 7 05:51:32 2015 UTC,"I wish they'd put out a fully-instrumental version of Lulu.   I listened to it on headphones a few months back, and the things Metallica were doing on that album were really friggin awesome."
Metallica,2rfg5o,weirdmountain,1 point,Wed Jan 7 19:59:31 2015 UTC,"I really listened to ""Dragon"" yesterday, and that main riff is cool as hell -- you could structure a great song around it. But that riff repeats so many times that it lost its lustre as it went on.   I think that'd be the problem with a fully-instrumental version of Lulu. Look at the song lengths. The music on the album is really good in places, but making Lulu more palatable would (a) take more than simply removing Reed's vocals, and (b) be completely miss the point of the album, I think.   It's like the people who made ""fan remixes"" of St. Anger. Yeah, sure, the guitars sound cleaner and the drums don't ring as much, but the album wasn't about sounding sonically perfect. Same with Lulu."
Metallica,2rfg5o,Machinax,2,Thu Jan 8 01:37:49 2015 UTC,"Good calls.  I actually bought Lulu on vinyl, being a Metallica lifer, and a Lou Reed fan anyway.   One thing that really helps with enjoying that album is to read the liner notes explaining the concept of the album.   Although that can be argued as another reason the album is not so good, like the old adage about how if you need to explain your Halloween costume, it's not a good Halloween costume."
Metallica,2rfg5o,weirdmountain,1 point,Thu Jan 8 01:57:39 2015 UTC,"Nicely said. I was watching some of the press release material about Lulu yesterday, and it struck me how everyone involved -- not just the musicians, but even the guys who designed the cover -- saw Lulu as this one-off musical art project.   Lulu is absolutely too self-indulgent for its own good. As much as I love Metallica, and as much as I love the sheer balls it took to make an album like Lulu, they didn't need so much damn music to make their point, whatever that point might have been (and since you've read the liner notes, you know more about it than I do).  I'm glad to be able to talk about Lulu with someone without having to dodge the ""I AM THE TABLE"" jokes."
Metallica,2rfg5o,Aktulu,2,Thu Jan 8 02:16:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, he also says he is the root, the problem, and the aggressor, but all anyone hears is ""table"".   Haha  I agree that Lulu is overindulgent, and waaaay too long, but one of Metallica's weaknesses has always been their lack of the concept of brevity.   That was most evident across the Load - St Anger era, where a lot of songs could have benefited from being 1-4 minutes shorter.      I think the funniest thing is going to be when critics retroactively praise the hell out of Lulu in 2035.   Because you know that's going to happen.   ""Ahead of its time...!"""

Metallica,2rbonh,SpudMonkey68,6,Sun Jan 4 20:35:14 2015 UTC,"Jason... only because i've known of him the longest. I started listening to them in 1995 so To me, he was always metalica's bassist. He had the best energy when it came to live shows.  obviously Cliff had the biggest impact on the band, and is probably the reason i love the old stuff so much. He was just so musically advanced. Rob is no slouch.. I think he is probably the most technical of the three, but because he hasnt been around as long, he gets forgotten about. I would love him a lot more if he stopped doing the crab walk. i fucking hate that"
Metallica,2rbonh,Dakota66,1 point,Mon Jan 5 16:39:56 2015 UTC,"Robert has been in the band for like 11+ years I believe. He's only beaten out by Jason and that won't take too much longer.

Metallica,2rbonh,yodawg111,2,Tue Jan 6 13:21:07 2015 UTC,"Well for many people, they have been listening to metallica for years, and rob is the third bassist they heard in metallica..

Although being a pick only bassist put him at a handicap Rob: most technically proficient bassist, but we've really only seen him on 2 records, neither of which are great examples of his playing.

This is obviously something that happens in pop music but it also happens in modern metal, especially metalcore."

Metallica,2r8fec,Hordiyevych,12,Sat Jan 3 20:46:11 2015 UTC,They protect his hands from getting cut on the strings when he plays.  Some people just pick a certain way that their hand scrapes across the strings and gets cut up pretty bad.  I'm the same way.
Metallica,2r8fec,G-42,4,Sat Jan 3 20:49:06 2015 UTC,He's said in interviews that it's masking tape. Sometimes I've seen him with scotch tape.
Metallica,2r8fec,theoxfordtailor,4,Sat Jan 3 21:41:53 2015 UTC,"It's masking tape, he has very sensitive skin for some reason and he uses them on his picking hand to stop the strings cutting into his hands, as in his early time playing guitar he had blood on a few. I believe he still owns those guitars.  If not, the guy who does is sitting on a GOLD mine."

Swedish black metal band Luciferion covered “Fight Fire with Fire” on a tribute compilation album that was faster, heavier, and possibly better than the original. And some group called Grope, on whom I could find almost nothing else, had a slightly different take on “And Justice for All” that was also very good."

Not really the toughest song to play, there's just a lot of chord progressions to memorize. Master of Puppets. The only part I really struggle with is the verse with those fast chord slides.

Metallica,2quups,CalFalpha,2,Wed Dec 31 05:57:23 2014 UTC,"As an old school fan, it's weird for me to say but probably the solo in Unforgiven.

He injured himself, which got him into painting while he recovered (he couldn't really play bass or jam with anyone) so that took took up a chunk of his time.  Who knows what the reasoning is with the Newsted band stuff but I think he's earned the right to do whatever he wants.  Based on the tons of other side bands he's done, maybe he just wants to move on to another one."

Metallica,2q4rqm,THISisnotmyfirstTIME,12,Tue Dec 23 02:13:35 2014 UTC,I like these stories about Lars. He is a genuinely good guy that gets a bad rap as a douchebag or pretentious.
Metallica,2q4rqm,earthwormjim91,10,Tue Dec 23 02:46:21 2014 UTC,Lars hate is so unjustified. Most people don't realize that he is responsible for Metallica's arrangements which is the reason they are a step above most bands and the Napster hate is so fucking old. He had the foresight and balls to realize it needed to be squashed and was the only artist out of a lot that felt the same way to put himself out there and speak against it. I remember an AMA earlier this year with some record producer that even said Metallica and Lars were some of the most humble and easiest guys to work with when asked. It's sad that people can't get past the Napster thing and them changing their sound when needed. Load and Reload are genius and assured their place in the modern market for the next 20 years after the fact. Look at bands like Slayer and Megadeth that are playing the same 80's style shit and never evolved and then look at Metallica's career since the Black Album and tell me they weren't smart as fuck. Metallica's new shit is always still relevant and their peers from the 80's are mere novelties of the 80's.
Metallica,2q4rqm,kevonicus,2,Tue Dec 23 07:38:47 2014 UTC,"Yes. I always felt a pang of frustration when I would come across any Lars hate over the years. I mean, I don't know the man or his motives but I know (or at least I have damn good justification at least believe) that he's a straight up awesome guy."
Metallica,2q4rqm,Cornholio94,1 point,Wed Dec 24 01:31:30 2014 UTC,Napster happened literally 14 years ago just today I saw Rolling Stone share an article about Lars for his birthday and all anyone can say is Oh hope he doesn't sue us again like jesus are we going to ignore all the interviews where he admitted he fucked up
Metallica,2q4rqm,yodawg111,2,Fri Dec 26 17:21:22 2014 UTC,Of course people only talk about how Lars is a douche based around how he acted from the late 90s through early 00s (aka the band's roughest time period)
Metallica,2q4rqm,Bwuhbwuh,1 point,Sat Jan 10 03:53:10 2015 UTC,Paging /u/RealLarsUlrich. Hope he somehow reads this.
Metallica,2q4rqm,thetaimi,0,Tue Dec 23 10:11:03 2014 UTC,"Most people hate Lars because others do.. they actually dont have any idea about why they even hate him  A) Bad drumming ,yea he kinda sucks, what can you do? B) Napster(people have no idea about this) C) ''douche'' (people have no idea about this)"
Metallica,2q4rqm,thetaimi,2,Tue Dec 23 09:11:27 2014 UTC,Dude. I may not know a DAMN thing about drumming but I loved him in ONE It blew my teenage mind.   EDIT: HAhhahahhahahhaa! I just found a drum solo vid. I can honestly say that he is a HELL of a showman.

I'd be totally fine with buying the Russian version, I just have my doubts about whether the quality is the same as the original version. ""Russian copy"" scares me haha. I guess I should probably do a little research and talk to someone who has the Russian version.  Thanks for the response."

That seriously would have broken my heart in two. There is so much left in them and it would be a tragedy to lose it. I'm even looking forward to what they do when they get even older and decide Metallica is done and pursue solo projects. Long live all the members!

Metallica,2ptk3u,DoylePTB,2,Sat Dec 20 14:49:48 2014 UTC,I always thought it's like 1983 Metallica fused with 1997 Misfits. Or something like that
Metallica,2ptk3u,henkile,1 point,Sat Dec 20 20:15:12 2014 UTC,"I believe that song is called ""Vulturous.""  Would have made a great B-side.  I downloaded the audio from the YouTube video years ago and still listen to it often."
Metallica,2ptk3u,wadems,2,Sat Dec 20 16:32:49 2014 UTC,Vulturous   Also a favourite of mine. I wanted that so badly in a slightly polished studio version
Metallica,2ptk3u,ossemon,2,Sat Dec 20 18:39:49 2014 UTC,"It feels a little too ""St.Anger"" to me after the re-used intro personally. James's vocal melody isn't very fleshed out."
Metallica,2ptk3u,AndrewRyansRapture,2,Fri Dec 19 23:25:53 2014 UTC,"They took the intro for the new song and made it into ""The End of the Line"" on Death Magnetic, and then took the rifts at the end of Kirk's solo and spliced it out to make ""All Nightmare Long"" and ""That Was Just Your Life"".  So you can hear a lot of the song in studio format across Death Magnetic!"
Metallica,2ptk3u,bleepblopbloop,1 point,Sat Dec 20 16:58:35 2014 UTC,ANL is one of my absolute favourites from DM.

Metallica,2pq4dr,AndrewtheAbbot,9,Fri Dec 19 17:58:36 2014 UTC,Let's just say I am very excited to hear the new remastered version thats coming out next year.
Metallica,2pq4dr,TerrrorTwlight,3,Thu Dec 18 22:07:42 2014 UTC,oh same here. its been a long time coming. I hope they eventually remix ajfa with the original bass included one of these days.
Metallica,2pq4dr,TerrrorTwlight,6,Thu Dec 18 22:36:57 2014 UTC,"Yeah. Honestly, KEA isn't one of my favorite Metallica albums. Musically, I think it's pretty awesome, but I'm not a huge fan of James' voice on the album and the sound quality of the album is lacking, but that's to be expected for someone's first album.   I would've LOVED to hear Kill Em All recorded in 1988."
Metallica,2pq4dr,weirdmountain,2,Thu Dec 18 22:42:00 2014 UTC,I love James's voice on KEA.  He sounds like Ian Gillan on Machine Head!

Metallica,2pq4dr,decytv,1 point,Sun Dec 21 01:28:12 2014 UTC,"Being the rhythm heavy thrash album that it was, I think Newsted would have been great on KEA. He never really got a chance to shine on a thrashy Metallica album. Cliff was great but Cliff shined more on RTL and MOP because he was actually there for the writing process."
Metallica,2pq4dr,GSKashmir,1 point,Thu Dec 18 23:40:09 2014 UTC,Didn't they alreayd do a remastered version once many years ago?
Metallica,2pq4dr,decytv,4,Fri Dec 19 03:10:20 2014 UTC,I think it's amazing!  Four Horsemen is one of my favorite metal songs period!
Metallica,2pq4dr,GSKashmir,2,Fri Dec 19 02:04:15 2014 UTC,"I agree 4 horsemen is pretty awesome, but overall the album is far from my favorite"
Metallica,2pq4dr,decytv,3,Fri Dec 19 03:10:50 2014 UTC,"Random trivia, did you know the guitar part right before the solo is based off of the riff from Sweet Home Alabama?"

Metallica,2pq4dr,agentalpha,3,Fri Dec 19 07:02:33 2014 UTC,"Eh, for me, Kill 'Em All is a good album for what it is but it's probably my least favorite in their entire catalog. I think a lot of it has to do with the production quality. I understand that it was recorded quickly on a small budget for a small label but it's hard for me to listen to. If I want to hear those songs then I go to the live versions."

Metallica,2p47eb,TerrrorTwlight,7,Fri Dec 12 21:43:12 2014 UTC,"Tube amp ideally.  Scoop the tone - lots of bass and treble, zero midrange.  Volume to drive the tubes  Active pickups would help  In terms of pedals, the closest I ever came would be the DOD American Metal pedal."
Metallica,2p47eb,G-42,2,Fri Dec 12 23:09:33 2014 UTC,"Man, I really need to do some serious research, I didn't understand 90% of what you wrote haha."
Metallica,2p47eb,G-42,3,Sat Dec 13 00:18:01 2014 UTC,"No problem.  In order:  Tube amps, when driven hard(overdrive) produces a thicker, fatter, heavier guitar sound than a solid state amp can.  If you don't know what your amp is, it's solid state.  Tube amps require volume to achieve the overdriven sound.  Turn up the bass and treble, turn down the midrange, to nothing.  On the amp and on any pedals/effects.  Active pickups are pickups in your guitar that have a power source - internal batteries typically.  They sound fuller and, if used a certain way, heavier, than passive pickups.  Again, if you don't know which you have, you have passive pickups.  And pedals...head down to your favourite guitar store with some time to spare, and get acquainted with lots of them.  Take money.  Justice was my favourite album(still is), and I spent a lot of time trying to recreate that sound with no money."
Metallica,2p47eb,Blasphyx,4,Sat Dec 13 00:37:39 2014 UTC,"Awesome man, thanks for the lesson! I had wondered what the big deal about tube amps was, now I know. Also, I'm pretty sure you're right about the me having passive pickups. I have an Epi Les Paul Standard Pro and whatever is in there are just the stock pickups and don't require any batteries.   AJFA is my favorite album too, I just love the guitar sound in it."
Metallica,2p47eb,The_One_Above_All,1 point,Sat Dec 13 00:51:40 2014 UTC,"Also, correct me if I'm wrong guys, but if you want to go with an active pickup, you might as well go with a solderless pickup kit. That will save you trouble in installing the pickup...unless you already know how to solder pickups.  They used EMG 80 somethings..."

Metallica,2p47eb,lrkr486,1 point,Sat Dec 13 01:12:11 2014 UTC,"Tube Amp - $500 minimum  Pedals - $60 ish minimum  Active pickups - probably a few hundred bucks.  These kinds of things are often in great shape used, so don't be afraid to go that route."
Metallica,2p47eb,Blasphyx,0,Sat Dec 13 03:07:20 2014 UTC,you can probably find a tube amp on ebay or Amazon for probably around $350 or so...but yeah retail probably around 500...I've gotten guitars and amps of eBay and have had no problems...just make sure the seller has good feedback and a return policy (which most good sellers will).
Metallica,2p47eb,Paincakes,1 point,Fri Dec 26 22:43:44 2014 UTC,Yes! Scoop that tone. I forgot to mention that
Metallica,2p47eb,Paincakes,6,Sat Dec 13 05:51:04 2014 UTC,"You will need a lot more than just an amp and to achieve this... especially a fender one. I am not an expert, but i do know a little of what needs to be done to achieve this tone.   I would look into buying a line6 hd500.. i have the hd400 and its fucken amazing.. but the hd500 is much better and im pretty sure someone has uploaded the patch for this tone somewhere.  also look into this link: http://www.guitartricks.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-19242.html  In my opinion, you could probably get close to the sound, but you are missing a lot of the ingredients that goes into that tone.. its not all about the mid/high/bass settings... there are noise gates, compressors, etc.  dont get discouraged."
Metallica,2p47eb,dr_oog,1 point,Fri Dec 12 21:51:00 2014 UTC,"Yeah I know my setup is faaaar from ideal, haha.   As far as the line 6 thing goes... is it just an effects pedal? I looked at some pics of it but I have no idea what I'm looking at. Even if I were to purchase a line 6 hd500, would it make a difference even though my amp sucks?   I'll check out that link too, thanks. I have this thing, the iRigHD that I use through Garage Band on my Macbook, and I've tried messing with some of those tones and stuff but I'm not really getting close to the sound I want. It doesn't help that the thing is partially broken, so when I do any palm muting it basically cuts the volume off for some reason, plus I don't have any speakers set up - just using my built-in speakers on my laptop.  Thanks for the pointers!"

At the same time it was my proper introduction to heavier music - I did have and love the soundtrack from the 1995 Mortal Kombat film, which included some pretty heavy rockin' tracks, but it wasn't until S&M that I actually took interest in heavy metal.  The first Metallica album I've ever bought was Re-Load, soon followed by Ride the Lightning and at first I was pretty surprised by how different James sounds on the latter. Then I got the rest of the albums over time and got hooked. Unlike most fans, however, I don't care very much for Master of Puppets. Individual songs range from good to great, but the album as a whole doesn't work all that well for me - I much prefer Ride the Lightning in that respect.If only Escape and Trapped Under Ice were better.  Here's my collection of Metallica cassettes. I still have 'em all. :)"

Metallica,2oq5wg,Whoneedsspaces,4,Tue Dec 9 10:52:48 2014 UTC,I too rocked out S&M in middle school and 9th grade. I would listen to it before every game i played in and on the way to school. I was a fan of Load and Re-Load not knowing the backlash that the band went through for cutting their hair and changing styles a bit. I like the earlier albums but the sound gets more clean and heavy during the later albums which came down to James and Lars mixing the first few albums. Escape and Trapped are severley underrated and I hear they are re-releasing the earlier albums with better production mixing to help the sound.
Metallica,2oq5wg,Whoneedsspaces,2,Tue Dec 9 14:49:32 2014 UTC,"I also didn't know that Load and ReLoad caused controversy among fans, I just listened to them and liked them for what they were.

These days I think they are simplistic and borderline comical in their lyrics. They set a trend though and a lot of trend setters appear cliche in hindsight.  Black Metal is good classic Venom

It wasn't until years later he decided to be a part of my life again and he disapproved of my anti-Metallica ways. He figures out I hadn't even heard their beginning years and tossed me CDs (this was early 02') of Kill and Lightning.

So, one day I got the latest Motley Crüe album in a tape..   There was some space left in the tape, so they filled it up with Battery and MOP.. That was it..

Puppets is a masterpiece. A fucking symphony that was released when most albums had maybe 3 good songs. Then Justice comes out, good, but no Bass at all.  The ""One"" video was awesome. It was the first time the world got to see who these guys were. Head-banging, angry maniacs. Men of loud music and few spoken words. They put out the Black album and Enter Sandman becomes this huge commercial hit. Everyone is stoked except the old school fans. Metallica was ours. Everyone else was supposed to hate them and now they are all singing ""off to never never land""  ugh. They put out Garage inc and big deal. I had the first garage days and that was enough. Then the Loads come out, with Napster and WHAT!!!? Our cool ass metallica who was the beacon of angst was now the MAN fighting the little guy.  I see them twice on each tour (I live in NYC and they play LI, the garden and NJ so i have options) and the started sucking live. Playing a melody of older songs. This long 10 minute montage that crammed 8 or so songs followed by all newer shit. Sucked. It wasn't till the Summer Sanitarium tour that they realized what to do.

Metallica,2okxtu,rodwool,4,Mon Dec 8 00:10:01 2014 UTC,Make that a baker's dozen!
Metallica,2okxtu,shaggy756,4,Mon Dec 8 06:28:37 2014 UTC,"I love Reload.   I think the only problem in that whole album is the use of the actual phrase ""Unforgiven too"" in ""The Unforgiven II"".   The rest of that album, and Load, are solid heavy rock and roll albums.  Unlike the first five, they wear their influences on their sleeves on those albums.   To listen to Load, Reload, and the New Recordings '98 section of Garage Inc. all in the same day, you can hear it loud and clear.   ""Fuel"" sounds like a Motorhead song.  ""The Memory Remains"" sounds like Ozzy-era Sabbath (those riffs...   the vocal melody...).  ""Devil's Dance"" sounds like Dio-era Sabbath.   ""Ain't My Bitch"", ""2x4"", and ""Mama Said"" all sound like Skynyrd..."
Metallica,2okxtu,weirdmountain,1 point,Mon Dec 8 18:10:57 2014 UTC,Not my favorite as all their albums are my favorite. But I love Reload. You wanna talk about dozens? Try finding a decent metallica fan that loves St Anger.  I can't believe how many people out there bash that album. It speaks to me on so many different levels and don't see how it doesn't for others.
Metallica,2okxtu,Bear_Taco,4,Fri Dec 12 04:48:45 2014 UTC,I'd say for me its a close second behind Puppets.  Side note/Shameless self promotion: I did a remaster of it for those of you like me who didn't like the horrible clipping problem.  Its fairly popular on Youtube if you search Death Magnetic remaster.  You can find it here.  Enjoy :D  There's also a download link in the description.
Metallica,2okxtu,arrocknroll,8,Sun Dec 7 22:01:50 2014 UTC,It's definitely up there for me. It's hard for me to pick ONE favorite but for sure it's one of my top Metallica albums.

Binge and Purge was one of my earliest Metallica purchases - I remember a week in college when the CDs were all I listened to - and Load is my favorite Metallica album. If you'd like to tell me why I'm not a ""true diehard Tallica fan"", I am all ears."
Metallica,2okxtu,Machinax,2,Tue Dec 9 06:19:59 2014 UTC,"How ironic,  when I new was 17 Load was my favorite.  Before I had heard any of there other albums.  Its your opinion,  but I play guitar and as far as riffs and music skill goes Master is way above Load."
Metallica,2okxtu,leadfarmer153,1 point,Tue Dec 9 12:38:15 2014 UTC,"Riffs and musical skill, sure. Emotional maturity and textures and layers to the music? Not so much. If I want adrenaline and speed, there are hundreds - I mean, probably literally hundreds - of thrash metal albums I can go to, and Master of Puppets is very, very high on the list.   But if I want something unique, with depth and feeling to it, that's why Load exists."
Metallica,2okxtu,Machinax,2,Wed Dec 10 20:43:16 2014 UTC,"Well put, you know Load and Reload were suppose to be 1 album with two CDs. I wish they would've took the best of both and just made one CD. It came out at different times because the some tracks weren't finished. Those songs became Reload"
Metallica,2okxtu,leadfarmer153,1 point,Wed Dec 10 22:14:13 2014 UTC,"I've heard, and seen, so many ideas of an ultimate Load mix that I'm decidedly against the idea now. Combining both albums into one would leave out many hidden gems that make the unsettling, uncomfortable mood of those albums.   And that's what I like about the Load albums - it was Metallica pushing themselves into unfamiliar territory, and coming up with some surprising results. Who knew Hetfield could sing that well? Who knew Hammett could play thoughtful, delicate solos? Who knew Ulrich could play with restraint and minimalism? Who knew Newstead... well, never mind.   I've heard Master of Puppets so many times now that, as an album, it doesn't surprise me. But no matter how many times I listen to the Load albums, something always jumps out - a guitar melody I had never noticed before, or how Hetfield pushes his voice on some of the choruses. And those things just aren't there in the basic thrash metal template.   So that's why the idea that ""no true Tallica fan would even consider anything after Black as there best album"" would be hilarious, if it wasn't the same regurgitated bullshit fans have been saying since 1996."

That Was Just Your Life, The Day That Never Comes, All Nightmare Long are all top notch, but My Apocalypse is my favorite off Death Magnetic.  AJFA is probably my all-around favorite album. RTL and Master are right up there though, it just depends on what I'm in the mood for really."

This whole album is exactly what my die hard metallica fan wants and yes, it doesn't quite hit the mark:  too many sour notes, wasted tonic in so many of Hammett's solos, the drumming is fine, Het's voice and the writing, chord progressions, and arrangements are all left wanting for the superb adventurous perfection of the first three albums.   How can this album be your fav?  Perhaps if you're a new fan, it comes close, a fraction close, to their past masters: growing up with KEA, Ride, and MOP, well nothing today comes even close to that brilliant magnificence.

Metallica,2okxtu,RyanThePatriot,1 point,Mon Dec 8 14:29:09 2014 UTC,"Tonic (music):       In music, the tonic is the first scale degree of a diatonic scale and the tonal center or final resolution tone.  The triad formed on the tonic note, the tonic chord, is thus the most significant chord. More generally, the tonic is the pitch upon which all other pitches of a piece are hierarchically referenced. Scales are named after their tonics, thus the tonic of the scale of C is the note C.  In very much conventionally tonal music, harmonic analysis will reveal a broad prevalence of the primary (often triadic) harmonies: tonic, dominant, and subdominant (i.e., I and its chief auxiliaries a 5th removed), and especially the first two of these.  The tonic is often confused with the root, which is the reference note of a chord, rather than that of the scale. It is also represented with the Roman numeral I.

Metallica,2okxtu,cosmic_meatball,1 point,Tue Dec 23 05:21:14 2014 UTC,Not sure about the greatest ever Metallica album but The Day That Never Comes is up there for me as one of their best ever songs. The pounding second half especially is incredible- an electrifying lead solo and Trujilo's bass playing as brilliant as ever adds to the already great first half.

Metallica,2o769k,metalheadgod,20,Wed Dec 3 22:30:21 2014 UTC,"The black album would've probably been a lot closer to Load than what it was.  Justice would've been more groovy and more bass heavy, obviously.  Cliff was very into classical and more alternative music. It is one thing that really shaped his bass style. He liked to push the envelope and experiment musically, and the rest of the band would've likely been down with it."
Metallica,2o769k,earthwormjim91,16,Wed Dec 3 23:45:01 2014 UTC,"James has said in interviews that Cliff wasn't only into metal and was encouraging experimentation, so we might have gotten Load-style music earlier than we did."
Metallica,2o769k,DocWheatley,6,Wed Dec 3 22:54:39 2014 UTC,"I can't stress this enough every time people bitch about load and all of that. We probably would have had those albums sooner. May not have even had AJFA. While Cliff was vital in Metallicas rise, his death has what made him legendary. Some of his playing on the recordings are amazing, mind blowing, jaw dropping. But a lot are also very sloppy. Listen to a lot of his isolated bass tracks."
Metallica,2o769k,BaldEagle88,3,Wed Dec 3 23:19:18 2014 UTC,"I would disagree: Justice has credits to Burton: To Live is To Die and the Cliff's memorial riff which is a form of the Justice bass riff, the last bass riff he ever wrote."

Metallica,2o769k,weirdmountain,1 point,Sat Dec 6 16:20:24 2014 UTC,"Absolutely.   There is an interview with Cliff (I think it may have been one of his last) where the interviewer asks what he'd been listening to, and one thing he says is ""have you ever heard R.E.M.?""     I think they would have maintained pretty much the same creative path, but without the music videos, as Cliff was supposedly against them.  (and I wish they had heeded that throughout most of the 1990s, 2000s.  As much as I love Metallica, those Load-era videos where they're hamming it up and mugging for the camera are unbearable.   I fully understand why a lot of folks who watched a lot of MTV in the 1990s don't like Metallica.   I was 16 when Load was released, and we didn't have cable TV, so I never really got to see those videos, and only really knew the music on its own merits, and I love those albums.)"
Metallica,2o769k,yoda46986,5,Thu Dec 4 19:48:27 2014 UTC,"Everything the same except St. Anger, Music Videos, Mascara, Blackened, My Friend Of Misery, and Where The Wild Things Are. Why? Most of the songs on Load, Reload, Black were all written by James, Kirk, Lars so Jason didn't really do anything :( Cliff only wrote half of Master and if the rest of the albums followed suite, then the fillers of those albums would have been songs like Enter Sandman, Until It Sleeps, and Fuel. So those albums would be really cool since there are already cool! Mascara to Cliff would have been a sign of a sell out along with the music videos. But Cliff said it himself: When Metallica will rise, they will self implode."
Metallica,2o769k,Bear_Taco,1 point,Fri Dec 5 17:09:49 2014 UTC,"But Cliff had a special bond with James and everyone else that Jason never really felt with them. When he left the band, it wasn't just to explore new opportunities. It was also because he always felt left out of everything. Which, surprisingly, Lars felt left out too (part of his stated reasons when doing the documentary for St Anger).  So I think Cliff would have still had a lot of influence on the band."
Metallica,2o769k,ijoinedtosay,3,Fri Dec 12 04:55:36 2014 UTC,I think we'd have got better albums than we did. Yes Cliff was in to different music and had a style that could easily help create a drastically different sound but he was also a magician on the bass and would have had that signature playing/writing style and I firmly believe he would have kept growing and we would have definitely got more 'classic' Metallica music than we have. He brought so much that I feel at times he's rated as a bass player more than he was for what he could create.
Metallica,2o769k,dr_oog,2,Mon Dec 8 15:16:32 2014 UTC,I think they would be happy that he was still alive and still in the band.
Metallica,2o769k,kidstandout,2,Fri Dec 5 03:32:42 2014 UTC,"probably the same considering cliff was into more abstract musical concepts and experimentation. i'd say the reason they changed after justice was to honor what he had in mind. remember, cliff was a big skynrd fan, and the least metal member in terms of appearance and influences. the guy was wearing bell bottoms"
Metallica,2o769k,DaveMcElfatrick,2,Thu Dec 4 03:57:36 2014 UTC,I don't agree with the idea that we'd have gotten Load sooner with Cliff around. Just cause he liked the idea of experimentation doesn't mean he'd necessarily have wanted Metallica to go down a bluesier direction. He could've experimented in different ways. I'm sure he had his own ideas for the Metallica sound.
Metallica,2o769k,BoardroomBimmy,1 point,Thu Dec 4 06:05:42 2014 UTC,"Better arrangements, less sour or no sour notes, more of complicated black album - maybe it would not have been as commercially successful as met may have put up more of a fight with Cliff.  Who knows, maybe they'd be like U2 is right now.  More musical theory."
Metallica,2o769k,vestergaard92,1 point,Thu Dec 4 07:09:49 2014 UTC,"My head canon is that they would be much more akin to something like Opeth, where they certainly evolve over time, but in a much more complex manner. I think a lot of the simplistic stuff after Justice never ever would have happened, let alone trash like Stanger, Lulu and Bob Rock sucking out their souls, and ustice itself probably would have been very similar but with actual bass and just an overall better vibe and sound to it.  I could possibly see them eventualy still heading into that Load territory, but I don't think it would have been as sharp as a change as it was. I would imagine their later stuff being experimental but still being deep and complex and heavy as shit.  The guys themselves would have been much different as well. When Cliff died, a large part of them died as well, both musically and emotionally. I don't think they would have become angry and embarassing self parodies that they became over the years."

Metallica,2nz5kc,M3n747,4,Mon Dec 1 20:58:26 2014 UTC,"In my opinion, I like St. Anger. It's not my favourite Metallica record, but c'mon, St. Anger is not so bad as people say it is. It has some good riffs that you can headbang too, and It has some cool lyrics. There are only 2 things I dislike in St. Anger: Lars Ulrich's drum sound, and the fact that this album has 0 guitar solos."
Metallica,2nz5kc,metalheadgod,2,Wed Dec 3 00:08:02 2014 UTC,"There's another fanedit that modifies the drums and adds solos, unfortunately it's only 7 songs out of 11. Also, the solos don't really fit with those songs, they feel forced and tacked on to me. I guess Lars was right when he said that solos just didn't work on this album. (Edit: missing comma.)"
Metallica,2nz5kc,metalheadgod,1 point,Wed Dec 3 08:02:29 2014 UTC,"Wow, I've never listened to this remixes. Those guitar solos were written by Kirk Hammett or it is fan-made? I kinda like the solos, but has you said, some solos don't fit the songs. :/"
Metallica,2nz5kc,weirdmountain,1 point,Wed Dec 3 22:13:07 2014 UTC,"They're fan made, as far as I know. I applaud this fan's effort, but the solos feel out of place for me.  After listening to Blessed Anger a bunch of times I think my biggest problem with St. Anger was the length and repetitive nature of the songs - now that they're cut down, I don't mind the lack of solos as I feel they're no longer necessary to change the pacing of the songs."
Metallica,2nz5kc,dpprace,3,Thu Dec 4 15:50:46 2014 UTC,"Does anyone else find it ironic that St. ANGER provokes such an... angry reaction from so many people?  The album has definitely grown on me the past few years (I usually like to start it at ""My World"", then listen to the whole album on repeat, So ""Frantic"" comes on again right after ""All Within My Hands"")  It's definitely not as bad as everyone says it is, and I like that it is a snapshot of that moment in their lives as humans, and as a band.   It's as hard to listen to as it probably was to make, and it completely humanized them, even more than the accompanying documentary film did..."
Metallica,2nz5kc,CalFalpha,4,Wed Dec 3 18:45:06 2014 UTC,"I appreciate the effort that this person put into this, but the problem with St. Anger isn't the length of the songs -- it's the fucking awful lyrics and the shitty motherfucking pots and pans sounding drums.  Still angry. Still bitter."

Every time it comes on, I get immersed in it and I get chills towards the end at the staccato accents. I can't even describe it. I wish so badly they would have wrote an interlude type thing to this song, like a separate track before it where James does the soft thing like I added in. The beginning excerpt is from Some Kind Of Monster when he is writing T.U.F. and talking. I thought it was cool to add to the beginning and fade in. I hope you guys like it.   (just a heads up, once the actual song starts, there is nothing else done to it, it's just the album version. this project was by no means hard or some large impressive task I was trying to do, just something I really did for myself because I love James' monologue and thought I would share with the Reddit MetFam)"
Metallica,2nnmna,hellrazzer24,2,Fri Nov 28 09:48:37 2014 UTC,"Its definitely the best song on St. Anger. I do agree with you, would love to hear an interlude for this song, or even just a jam like in SKOM."

Metallica,2npjr1,Hetstaine,5,Sat Nov 29 00:09:43 2014 UTC,"Man, do not dare to say that again! Metallica is a legendary band. One of the best and most succesfully bands in the whole world! They have classic songs and almost everyone knows Metallica even if they don't like them, they certainly have heard the name once. They have a huge legion of fans. I am a fan of them almost since I was born. I listen to them since I was a little kid and I immediately fell in love with their riffs and guitar solos. They are all happy about what they do, but recently, I think they are just tired. They make a lot of shows per year, I think they should rest for a couple of days and stop with the shows for a while and concentrate on the new music. About Rob not fitting the band, in my opinion, I love Rob, he is amazing, he is a very nice guy and a great bass player. I think he's perfect to Metallica. James solo album, yeah, it would be cool to hear something like that, but with Metallica still working. To me, Metallica will be forever, and I hope they do not quit so early. METALLICA RULES! \m/"
Metallica,2npjr1,Hetstaine,2,Sat Nov 29 00:54:31 2014 UTC,"LoS didn't do anything for me and i have always felt a hollow since they kicked Jason out. Look forward to what they will do musically or otherwise when they do go their seperate ways though. Don't get me wrong, Metallica has been my number one band since MoP and it will be a weird day when they do call it quits.

Metallica,2npjr1,metalheadgod,0,Mon Dec 1 02:19:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah i find it amazing, that one cannot voice an opinion or have a serious discussion without super obssesive fanboys down voting you to death. Im 34 been listening to them since i was a kid, like i said, seen them live 14 times, love all their albums but it's just not the same anymore. Let's face it James is the riff master and kirk is a good guitar player, but they are getting up there with age, so of course they can't play as fast anymore and i think that is the reason Lars has simplified his drumming because it's not easy to play that type of music three times a week for two and a half hours at night. I really think James doing a solo project with complete control of everything would be amazing. If you watch Some kind of monster, there's somewhere in there where he is bitching about Lars wanting to make every song 6 minutes long when he thinks its not even necessary."
Metallica,2npjr1,AaronRyan,2,Sat Nov 29 23:22:15 2014 UTC,Fuck no! they are just picking up their 3rd wind.. I do suggest they cut out all the tour dates and focus on themselves and other projects.

Metallica,2ngoxs,PhantomLordJD,19,Wed Nov 26 08:56:40 2014 UTC,"It's hard to say but my guess would be yes, he is happy. Kirk has never really been the one to take the spotlight and jump around. Neither is he a very vocal person in general nor one to express his feelings. He likes to live in his own world for the most which I think encourages people to assume a lot of stuff about him. Also, they're getting old. They've been touring so much this year it must be taking its toll on them. At this points I think they're doing it for the fans more than they're doing it for themselves."
Metallica,2ngoxs,keitarno,11,Wed Nov 26 09:18:25 2014 UTC,They've been touring so much this year    Wish they would do some of that touring in the US! They haven't done a tour here in like 5-6 years.

Especially when you're expected to thrash around, which I just don't do. And I would be uneasy with a throng of fans clamoring for me, or whatever.  I just wanna jam. Put me over by the drummer, and let me play. Fortunately, Hetfield doesn't mind the spotlight at all."
Metallica,2ngoxs,Testiculese,2,Wed Nov 26 15:21:37 2014 UTC,"This is exactly how I would be as well. I love playing metal music, but I am not the type of person you would expect to see at a metal show. I don't want to be in a mosh pit, I would rather sit there quietly and watch the show/enjoy the music than jump around and scream my lungs out. Maybe part of that comes from me playing guitar, I enjoy just watching what these guys are doing while they play and trying to learn new things from them."

Metallica,2ngoxs,III420III,8,Wed Nov 26 15:57:42 2014 UTC,If you watch the metontour videos i think it is pretty clear that he is happy
Metallica,2ngoxs,vestergaard92,9,Wed Nov 26 09:20:30 2014 UTC,"I don't think he'd be happier anywhere else, Metallica is his home and he probably got used to the whole thing. I doubt he'd ever join another band or start another project. So in that regard, I'm sure he's happy in Metallica, or happier than he'd be in other bands. However, he's been giving me ""I'm just punching in and punching out, 9 to 5, doing my job and nothing more"" vibes for years. I think he's been simply doing this for too long. I don't think there's a particular reason for this, simply decades of this stuff can make you jaded...    I do remember hearing that his hands/fingers hurt or whatever. He's got some health issues, albeit nothing too severe, so I think having to physically perform the songs he wrote as a teen, at this age, after all these years, and with some pain involved, it's just not as fun as it used to be.    I also heard rumors that he might still have a drug problem but I don't know if I believe that. Anyway, our ""boys"" have gotten old, it's no wonder they're not the 20-something musicians from the 80s."
Metallica,2ngoxs,JayMayo,3,Wed Nov 26 17:25:44 2014 UTC,"I had the same impression from the last two MOT videos. I suspect he is going through some personal issues.   30th anniversary I'd put down to simply being stressed as the whole band was; he and the band were very happy since, particularly throughout Soundwave 2013."

Metallica,2nd81y,metalheadgod,29,Tue Nov 25 12:48:43 2014 UTC,"The metal and drumming community hates on Lars because he's ""not creative enough"" and plays simple beats. People who say that are missing the bigger picture in my opinion.  Lars has stated in numerous interviews that he and James are symbiotic and that he creates beats that complement Hetfield's riffs.  One of the greatest examples of this is his work on Load and ReLoad, where he creates an amazingly emotional groove. Had the drums been playing a beat similar to The Black Album, these two albums would have a completely different vibe.  As far as the ""asshole"" monicker, I think it started with the Napster fiasco and continued after Lars was made known to be an expensive art collector. I guess people in those circles are known as snooty and he may have given off that vibe for a short period of time.  I think he's a good guy who's made something of himself and is not afraid to show it. Sure he has a big personality, but that's what it takes to be known and recognized."
Metallica,2nd81y,followedbysnow,7,Tue Nov 25 13:11:01 2014 UTC,"The argument about his drumming is less about the beats he originally played and more the fact he can't play the ones he played on albums as well anymore. He tends to simplify original beats when playing them live which is a little disappointing to see. Compared to Charlie Benante or Dave Lombardo (drummers of Anthrax and Slayer respectively) who can play their original stuff just as well but even faster or more complex makes the complaints against Lars kind of justified.  I don't think he's a horrible drummer, he knows his place in the band (most of the time, stop overplaying the slow part in Orion and Puppets for gods sake), but I do agree that skill wise he is lacking, not just compared to others, but his former self."
Metallica,2nd81y,Blackadder18,-3,Tue Nov 25 17:30:41 2014 UTC,"have you heard him do an interview... the constant smacking of his lips, his continual hand movements that rattle his jewelry, the way he pauses to ""articulate"" himself... he comes off as a fucken douche.. sorry.. he just doesnt seem down to earth at all.. i love the guy, but he comes off as a dick."

Metallica,2nd81y,dr_oog,0,Wed Nov 26 17:43:51 2014 UTC,"plays simple beats   Nowadays, for sure. The first 4 albums, though, I don't hear many drummers with that kind of creativity, flow and precision, without the overly technical vibe."
Metallica,2nd81y,Blasphyx,8,Tue Nov 25 20:03:09 2014 UTC,"Because he has slowed down massively, simplifies songs live and there are some he can't even play any more.  Compare the album version of Harvester of Sorrow to the live version, it's a pretty huge difference. The bass drum in the album version actually follows the guitar riff while it's just the standard ""snare bass snare"" beat live.  He has gotten a lot better in the most recent tour. There was a period a few years back that had recordings of shows where he wasn't playing the machine gun part of One right."
Metallica,2nd81y,thetaimi,2,Tue Nov 25 13:40:08 2014 UTC,"He is an asshole and has a hugely inflated ego, but he's one of those guys that's such an asshole that you can't help but like him. I for one love him."
Metallica,2nd81y,Metallicarox,2,Mon Dec 1 20:33:46 2014 UTC,I think It's simply because he's the 'spokesperson' for the band. I don't get why people complain so much about his drumming.  It's fucking fine for what they do.  He's not Derek Roddy and they're not a death metal band.
Metallica,2nd81y,Hordiyevych,2,Fri Dec 5 03:48:09 2014 UTC,"The Lars hate is really overblown. Yeah, he's no 1993 Lars, but he's not that bad. He's even been getting a little better as of late.  I think the main reason is because he's in a really big band, so everyone expects him to remain just as good as he was if not better...as it's natural for most musicians. That's not entirely unreasonable, but I personally don't mind too much how simplifies his beats live. I would love to see them live regardless. I'd just be focusing on the guitar anyway.  This band Venom was a big favorite of the Metallica guys in the early 80s, and they were pretty big up until around Metallica's Ride The Lightning and Master of Puppets. Their drummer wasn't that great at all...during their prime. But back then, Venom was big regardless. Extreme Metal was about speed...it's a guitar dominated sound, and people who were into stuff like Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Bathory, Celtic Frost, etc knew this. Percussive prowess was just icing on the cake. I NEVER see people shit on Abaddon(Venom) the way people shit on Lars.  A lot of modern metal puts the drummer up front...and sometimes even the guitar sounds percussive.(Meshuggah) I challenge any Lars hater to find me the ""worst"" Lars performance. I rather be there than at a Meshuggah show."
Metallica,2nd81y,kevonicus,3,Wed Dec 10 01:59:59 2014 UTC,"Reason 1: BANDWAGONING  Some people hate him on the internet => Others join without knowing SHIT  Reason 2: Napster ( 80% of ppl who say this, have no fucking clue about it )  Reason 3: He is shit drummer nowadays.  Which is true, he is pretty terrible nowadays."
Metallica,2nd81y,Swazi,1 point,Tue Nov 25 19:53:04 2014 UTC,Do you think metallica will officially disband within the next few years like Black Sabbath is doing?
Metallica,2nd81y,serosis,1 point,Thu Dec 4 13:21:05 2014 UTC,"I think it's more likely they will simply dwindle more and more down away from the outside and only perform at a few concerts a year, not doing massive tours, maybe still releasing an album or two. I doubt they will ever say ""Right, see ya guys, it's been good"" but slowly and surely it will come to something almost exactly like that."
Metallica,2nd81y,Zahninator,0,Thu Jan 1 12:52:25 2015 UTC,It is exclusively bandwagoning. It's just regurgitated statements that have been floating around since after the black album and Napster and no new thoughts or criticisms are ever introduced. It's just uninformed people that know nothing of the topic spouting out shit they've heard or seen on message boards. Everyone gets hate on the internet. Just ignore it.

Metallica,2nd81y,MoBaconMoProblems,1 point,Sun Jan 18 06:28:04 2015 UTC,"He doesn't play as well as he used to, but he can still play decently well. He just looks bad compared to Lombardo and people who are close to the same age. Some bodies age better than others."
Metallica,2nd81y,Tbh2006,3,Tue Nov 25 18:58:23 2014 UTC,"A couple years ago I saw back-to-back interviews with Lombardo and Ulrich where they were asked an identical question about what they do to improve their skills after so many years.  Lombardo went on about some jazz sub genre he'd just discovered that was really challenging for him, while Lars laughed and said he doesn't touch the drums anymore, except on stage."
Metallica,2nd81y,TiitsMcgeee,2,Tue Nov 25 22:35:57 2014 UTC,I really don't blame Lars for that. He has a right to treat his body how he chooses.

I could play most of the rhythm guitar on probably about 75% of their songs but I would mainly play along to the live albums because i would play along with it as if I was onstage too.  I could play Cunning Stunts all the way through from front to back playing all of James parts.  I don't play their stuff as much any more than I used too but my two favorites to jump on guitar to and play is Creeping Death and The Four Horsemen from Live Shit."

They're really the only band I played for the next 10 years. I learned 99% of KEA, RTL, MOP and AJFA pretty much note for note.  I really can't do any of the leads either. Some of the smaller ones, or Satriani-style, yes. I focused on other bands when I was learning lead, and I flat out can't do some of that stuff.

You can't mention Metallica without someone saying he's a dick and all these people upvote it every time. The Napster shit is so played out and if you ask anyone that's ever worked with Lars they talk about how good of a guy he is. Not to mention that he has a huge hand in the arrangement of their songs which is arguably what Metallica excels at. Also hate how everyone says they only like their stuff before the black album, because in my experience, everyone that says that hasn't even really listened to Load, Reload or Death Magnetic. I've had several friends that always said they didn't like anything after the black album and then get them to listen to Death Magnetic and they can't believe how good it is."
Metallica,2mrej0,kevonicus,12,Wed Nov 19 18:18:56 2014 UTC,agree with everything.   Load is an incredible album. Some of their finest work.
Metallica,2mrej0,kirkemg,7,Wed Nov 19 18:59:22 2014 UTC,Actually wish they would make another album like it. At this point I rather him them do tight great sounding songs than 8 minute riff fests. I like Death Magnetic but I really hope this next album doesn't feel like Death Magnetic 2. James voice right now would really lend itself well to a Load-esque album.
Metallica,2mrej0,kevonicus,1 point,Wed Nov 19 19:49:48 2014 UTC,"great way of putting it. I actually thought DM was a GREAT way to say we aren't done yet. DM has a lot of really creative, fresh sounds to it. A very modern take on their ""old"" style. With that said, I don't want the leftovers of DM for the new album. Though with ""lords of summer"" i anticipate that's what we'll get.   The reason I am such a big metallica fan over and above all over bands i like (megadeth, pantera etc) is simply put James ability to express emotions in lyrics and songwriting that others simply can't replicate. His lyrics, especially on Loan, simply guide you to a concept but aren't overly descriptive and allow you to apply it to your own life. I wish they made an entire album of bleeding me's and outlaw torns. It's so raw and emotional and genuine and exposes insecurities that we all feel. I love the traditional metal they make as much as the next guy but when they/James decide to compose a song like Outlaw Torn there is no one better in the world."
Metallica,2mrej0,kirkemg,0,Thu Nov 20 16:48:37 2014 UTC,"Load, reload, and even black, feel like such a far cry of where they were going with their first three albums.

I just can't get enough of the raw youthfulness of hetfields voice."
Metallica,2mrej0,ScoutzKnivez,5,Wed Nov 19 21:06:30 2014 UTC,I don't think it was bizzare. I thought it was bad ass and smart as hell to not get stuck in the 80's with pretty much every other metal band. Megadeth still sounds as cheesy as they did in the 80's. That's why Metallica is one of the biggest bands in the world and Megadeth couldn't fill an arena by themselves if they tried.
Metallica,2mrej0,kevonicus,-1,Wed Nov 19 23:39:10 2014 UTC,"stuck in the 80's.   You say that like it's a bad thing. I don't know if you've noticed but nearly all of Kill is timeless.  From 91 and on, they slow down their speed and aggression. It's mellow, the riffs aren't there. Shit, they even forced kirk to not solo (which was extremely ironic since James n Lars thought solos were ""dating"" their songs, when in fact not having guitar solos on that record actually dates it to the 00's alt metal/hard rock stuff.)   It's frustrating whenever you bring up metallica to someone all you get is ""they're old, Napster, reload load is awesome/garbage"" it's always the same shit. No one ever compliments horsemen, remorse, phantom lord.... it's kind of a bummer."

There was a raffle for a charity that had a booth inside the venue, and my buddy won the drum head then gave it to me as a birthday present. We went backstage to an area where Jason came out. I showed him the drum head and asked him to put the date on it, and he signed it again and dated it.  The ""Capn's of Krunch"" is a patch that I got through the Metallica club or off their website back in the late '90s.

Makes one wonder whether the whole Bob Rock era would've happened. Then again, even Newstead was against the hard-rock direction that Bob pointed the band in but that didn't stop the train from rolling.  Honestly, Trujillo is a godsend for the band. He's got impeccable rhythm and pocket and he's got finger-picking skill at or (dare I say) above what Cliff could do.   The only problem being that the big-two of Metallica don't take input from other members for song-writing and they've run out of Dave Mustaine material to re-use for instrumentals and song structures (etc). Eg. We'll probably never know if one of the core songwriters of Suicidal Tendencies would be good at making Metallica songs...   Well, that and Rick Rubin steering the band to do their best Slayer impersonations (and the ""Loudness War"" mastering...)"

Metallica,2m0zmi,BeanGallery,5,Wed Nov 12 18:32:28 2014 UTC,"It was twirling around on him before he slammed it. He slammed it to the ground as a sign to his crew that there was a problem with it. It looks like the crew missed that message. As he was getting his new guitar on for Sandman, he noticed that nobody had run over to the mic yet and so he had to point it out. Then the crew member just stood the thing back up and turned it around backwards. Didn't address or notice the root issue at all. Somebody wasn't paying attention."

Metallica,2m2pi9,BBoySpringz,5,Wed Nov 12 14:39:00 2014 UTC,"They have only played Unforgiven II just one time,   http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/metallica/1997/mgm-grand-garden-arena-las-vegas-nv-63d6daeb.html  It just doesn't translate well in the live environment.  There is a video of it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxly3xq7nWE"
Metallica,2m2pi9,metallica48423,6,Wed Nov 12 15:59:05 2014 UTC,"They're not going to play the song because you wore a t-shirt. The setlists are decided before the shows even start, so unless you were in the Meet and Greet, there's no chance it would help.   The closest Metallica came to playing it was this year at one of the By Request shows. It made it to the Vote of the Day, but was shot down by a wide margin. There's a little footage of the boys rehearsing Unforgiven 2 that day, but that's it.   They whipped out a lot of rarities on the World Magnetic tour, so I'm thinking our only greatest hope is that they finish the new album on tour like hell. Another By Request tour is another chance, but I doubt they'll do that.   When did you see them live?"
Metallica,2m2pi9,theoxfordtailor,1 point,Wed Nov 12 18:08:11 2014 UTC,"I know they wont play it just because of a T-shirt. but my Question is why dont they ever play it Live?  I saw them Twice last year and the year before in Yas Island Abudhabi. Can't wait for the next one, although its not announced yet but whatever it takes, ill be there."
Metallica,2m2pi9,theoxfordtailor,5,Wed Nov 12 22:51:44 2014 UTC,"There are a bunch of reasons why they haven't played it. Not all of them are good ones and some are just me speculating.    They have a group of songs that they must play at most shows. For instance, it's almost impossible to find a setlist without Master of Puppets, Nothing Else Matters, Enter Sandman, Sad but True, Creeping Death, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Fuel, Seek & Destroy, Fade to Black, or One. These are what I would call ""top-tier"" songs. These have priority on every setlist because they are the most popular and most requested. They are much more likely to disappoint a lot of fans by skipping any of those songs. Sure, they get left out every now and then, but that's incredibly rare.    Second-tier songs would probably be numbers like The Unforgiven, Sanitarium, Ride the Lightning, etc.. These are the songs that are popular, but not really expected at a show. In most shows, these songs are the interchangeable items on the setlist. For instance, Harvester of Sorrow might sub for Ride the Lightning, while still keeping the same basic outline.   Cover songs probably form their own tier. It is extremely rare to see more than one in a show. During the World Magnetic tour, they made a point of playing one cover a night.   There's another tier for almost-rarities like ...And Justice for All (to a lesser degree these days), Disposable Heroes, and Leper Messiah. You won't see this very often at all and it's always a surprise to see them, but you couldn't really describe hearing them as a rarity.   You could probably make a few other tiers after those, but let's skip to the bottom tier. These songs include the extremely rare and never-before-played. These songs are either unliked or unknown by the general masses. Like it or not, the majority of people going to Metallica shows aren't in the fan club, don't regularly post on Metallica boards, or even own all the CDs. The majority of people at those shows are casual fans who probably listen to radio hits.   The hardest of the hardcore fans like myself would kill to hear a super rarity, even if the song is not necessarily the best song in their catalog. For instance, a lot of fans on Metallicabb are clamoring to hear Fixxxer or, as you said, The Unforgiven II played live. The By Request shows basically proved that those aren't all that popular, except by a vocal minority.   But that doesn't it won't happen. We got them to played The Frayed Ends of Sanity!   (Speculative) Another reason would be that the band don't regard it as being all that good. Thus, Metallica isn't very interested in playing it.  (Speculative) They only played it once and want to make that one time a special occasion. I find this reason unlikely, but it's a possibility.  Adding a rarely-played song to a setlist means a lot of extra practice time and additional work. They know Sandman to a tee and generally don't need to practice it. They'll rehearse, I'm sure, but they don't have to relearn the song.    Tl;dr: Metallica won't play Unforgiven II mostly due to lack of demand.  I'm right there with you. I want to see them live again so bad!  edit: formatting came out funny, forgive me. Or forgive me not."

Metallica,2lqzwy,Whoneedsspaces,3,Sun Nov 9 08:56:29 2014 UTC,I did a re mix a while back. Here it is  The problem is that not every song on ajfa has 'leaked' stems. So in order to make the bass more audible without increasing the lower frequencies of the the guitars/drums/vocals you would have to use the stems. Else it will sound like shit. Simply increasing the 50-80 hz range will not make the bass instrument more audible in the mastered versions.  If anyone could get their hands on high quality stems of other ajfa songs I could give them a try too.

Metallica,2lqzwy,EnfieldCNC,1 point,Wed Nov 12 01:27:50 2014 UTC,"a remaster won't alter anything like that.  At most a remaster will take the original recordings, convert from analog (or whatever) to the highest quality they can, fix up loudness or compression, maybe enhance the dynamic range a bit, make sure there's no clipping etc.  What you're thinking of is a remix. Taking the original tracks and re-adjsuting the levels to make something sound completely different to what was released.   Personally, I hope they don't do this as what was released (the mix) forms part of the feel and emotion of the album."
Metallica,2lqzwy,my_clock_is_wrong,2,Sun Nov 9 10:07:36 2014 UTC,"I would like to hear it, personally. Flemming Rasmussen's original mix sounded completely different, according to the man himself. The guitars had more midrange, the bass was very audible (think Black Album level of audible), and the drums had more room mics in the mix, making a 'larger' drum sound. Overall, a 100% different sound than what was on the album, and the way the producer intended it to sound before James and Lars changed the sound during the final mixing process with Steve Thompson."

Metallica,2lm4ay,leadfarmer153,3,Sat Nov 8 03:31:23 2014 UTC,"I bought most of their albums before the internet existed.  I camped out in 30 below weather for front row tickets before the internet existed.  I learned most of their songs on guitar using tab books printed on old fashioned paper, before there was an internet.  Pirate their albums?  Never had any need to."
Metallica,2lm4ay,arrocknroll,2,Sat Nov 8 03:54:11 2014 UTC,"Same here, waited outside a ticket master for the summer sanitarium tour tickets. Own every album. My favorite bands I would never even consider a download only."
Metallica,2lm4ay,Svinhood,1 point,Sat Nov 8 02:45:09 2014 UTC,Yes and no.  I had bought some of them on cd and imported them into my computer but I had the rest on cassette tape but I still owned them.  I just pirated the ones I had in cassette because I already owned it and I might as well have it in good quality if it's already been payed for.  Plus I like to remaster and tweak the audio to make improvements or just for funzies and I can get the isolated tracks.  I remastered Death Magnetic in this fashion and it actually got fairly popular on youtube. (shameless self promotion). I'm working on AJFA next.  So I did buy all of the albums at some point but I pirated the ones that I couldn't put on my computer or if I wanted the isolated track files I pulled then off of the internet.

Metallica,2lm4ay,ecke,1 point,Sat Nov 8 05:10:59 2014 UTC,The only one I have pirated is Death Magnetic.  No idea why.  I already had the rest of the albums on CD/Tape/etc.  I remember I actually had to buy several copies of MOP on cassette from playing it so much.
Metallica,2lm4ay,MetalJunkie101,1 point,Sun Nov 9 17:57:42 2014 UTC,When I was a teenager I downloaded the albums after hearing metallica for the first time on a bootleg from my friends brother. Time went by and I bought album after album until the collection was complete. Now I rarely use the cds as I have the albums on Spotify.

Metallica,2ligl8,Dzoneh,4,Thu Nov 6 21:08:48 2014 UTC,I hope they do something interesting on the five night stand. Maybe play part of the Ronnie Rising medley or something that's never been played before on tv.
Metallica,2ligl8,PhantomLordJD,9,Thu Nov 6 23:38:17 2014 UTC,I've been LOVIN' that new Medley. I tend to like Metallica's covers even more than the versions by the original artists.

Metallica,2ligl8,BaldEagle88,1 point,Thu Nov 6 23:59:02 2014 UTC,Huh? From what you said it sounds like they are playing 5 nights.

Metallica,2liu50,Hetstaine,3,Fri Nov 7 05:16:57 2014 UTC,"2, 1, 3.  1 is alright.  2 is cool because it's a real throwback to the first one and has got some really spine-chilling moments.  3 isn't that bad. A good ending to the trio, but the solo could've been better."
Metallica,2liu50,Whoneedsspaces,1 point,Fri Nov 7 10:42:12 2014 UTC,3: I think the build up to the solo is amazing and the lyrics some of the best of the trilogy.

Metallica,2liu50,pixelman1,1 point,Tue Nov 11 12:51:53 2014 UTC,I think 3 has one of the best solos since The Outlaw Torn
Metallica,2liu50,kestrel_rises,4,Tue Nov 11 16:09:42 2014 UTC,"II.  ""Now I see iiiiiiiiiiit...."" gives me chills."
Metallica,2liu50,BaldEagle88,3,Fri Nov 7 01:45:10 2014 UTC,2 is my favorite. It was one of the first songs I ever learned how to play on guitar so it'll always hold a special place in my heart as my favorite Metallica song.
Metallica,2liu50,Gimpygoat,3,Fri Nov 7 11:44:26 2014 UTC,"II, I, III  II is just so damn good!!"
Metallica,2liu50,RyanThePatriot,3,Fri Nov 7 16:58:52 2014 UTC,"III, II, I I can't be the only one. I think II and III change top spots from time to time with me. II was the first Metallica song I remember listening to, so it has more nostalgia for me, but that solo on III is moving."
Metallica,2liu50,awesomemgy,1 point,Fri Nov 7 17:00:06 2014 UTC,Was just thinking it! I think II and III are equal. I love the build up and the solo.

I thought 3 was amazing because it was so interesting musically."
Metallica,2liu50,joshj516,2,Sat Nov 8 05:16:27 2014 UTC,"I for the music, II for the lyrics and III, well, meh."
Metallica,2liu50,AyyMibz,1 point,Mon Nov 10 04:55:22 2014 UTC,1 2 3 in that order. 1 fills me to brim with a sense of nostalgia. 2 is a good tune and 3 is by far the inferior of the group.

Metallica,2liu50,caffeineme,1 point,Fri Nov 7 01:45:18 2014 UTC,"III I II  I love the atomosphere and lryics of III, the chorus gives me chills every time. its only downside is the brick wall limiting (the distortion is very noticable in this track), which does make it difficult to listen to.  I enjoy II, and Reload is my favourite album, but it just lacks soul for me."
Metallica,2liu50,Herr_Opa,1 point,Fri Nov 7 12:38:26 2014 UTC,"II, III, I. I was fine, but overplayed when it came out.   From II: ""Lay beside me...tell me what I've done"". Among my favorite lyrics.   III seems SO cathartic from James. I like to think it's his coming to terms with his new life, sober, with a new outlook on the world and his place in it, all while not forgetting who he used to be.    ""How could he know this new dawn's light  Would change his life forever?  Set sail to sea but pulled off course  By the light of golden treasure  Was he the one causing pain  With his careless dreaming?  Been afraid  Always afraid  Of the things he's feeling  He could just be gone  He would just sail on  He would just sail on  How can I be lost?  If I've got nowhere to go?  Searched the seas of gold  How come it's got so cold?"""
Metallica,2liu50,sunbro420praiseit,1 point,Sun Nov 9 04:27:32 2014 UTC,"It's a hard pick... Like others have said, my first album was Reload as well, and Unforgiven II was one of the first songs I attempted in a guitar, along with Boston's More than a Feeling.  Still, in terms of the solo, The Unforgiven wins. It's my all time favorite Kirk Hammett solo, along with Ride the Lightning and One.  In terms of lyrics, I would also pick The Unforgiven. In my opinion, that's when James' poetic abilities were at their peak. ""Oooh a vow unto his own, that never from this day..."" pops into my head whenever I remember the vows I made to myself in life.  The Unforgiven II has its moments, such as when the song is finishing up and you hear the same note sequence from The Unforgiven along with the backing vocals going ""So I dub thee Unforgiven..."".   Now, whenever I'm listening to music on Shuffle and I hear that piano start to play, I know shit's about to go down and I love it. Back in 2008 I wished they would put the horn in the beginning, to follow the tradition from I and II, but I've come to appreciate and love that piano intro. I'll even go further, when Unforgiven III starts to play, I get the same feeling I get when I hear Battery or Damage, Inc play. It's a feeling of ""All hell's gonna break loose in a few moments"". And indeed, the riff kicks in along with ""How could he know..."" and it is majestic and monumental.  All that being said, I place them: 1,3,2."
Metallica,2liu50,yoda46986,1 point,Mon Nov 10 05:21:48 2014 UTC,"Probably The Unforgiven, The Unforgiven II and the Unforgiven III in that order. The toss up between I and II is difficult as for which is my favourite.  The Unforgiven is a great song. The line 'that old man here is me' being a particular favourite.  The Unforgiven II is a really powerful song. I think it would have been even better if it wasn't a 'sequel' song. If it was a stand alone song. Say it had been the first Unforgiven, it would probably rank amongst my all time favourite songs."
Metallica,2liu50,GSKashmir,1 point,Fri Nov 21 09:39:17 2014 UTC,"The Unforgiven will always be my favorite one. The song will always be in my top ten favorite songs of all time. The into, solo, the main riff, the lyrics are all amazing. Second place will be the Unforgiven III. A little different than the rest, with the piano entrance, which isn't that great, but the rest of it makes up for it. My favorite solo since Bleeding Me, alongside the Suicide And Redemption solo. James's best lyrics for ages also. ""How Can I Be Lost, If I've Got Nowhere To Go"" is awesome. The Unforgiven II is the more connected to the original but with southern twang. My least favorite because it gets a bit repetitive after a while. Anyways they are all good."
Metallica,2liu50,MuchAdoAboutStuffing,-1,Fri Dec 19 13:43:17 2014 UTC,"I, III, II.  Number 2 has a lyric that is literally the title of the song. ""YOU'RE UNFORGIVEN TOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!"""

Metallica,2lapwi,arrocknroll,3,Wed Nov 5 02:34:23 2014 UTC,"I saw it in IMAX 3D the day it came out and I loved it!  The performance was spot on, the sound was great, and the visual effects were stunning.  The in ""narrative"" parts didn't really tell to compelling of a story.  Tripp is tasked with getting a bag that the band needs and trips (HA GET IT) the fuck out on some drugs and is faced with a bunch of nasty scenarios until he finds a bag which the viewer never finds out what is in it which is kind of irritating because Tripp at one point looks inside and is flabbergasted by what he finds.  I don't find this all that bad though because the narrative scenes are still REALLY cool and work well with the music.  It feels like an extended music video almost but with a live performance instead of a studio recording.  All in all, I'd say if you haven't seen it yet, its worth a watch."
Metallica,2lapwi,Raggedy-Man,3,Wed Nov 5 03:25:26 2014 UTC,"Loved it. Absolutely loved it. I understand that it's not meant to be a standard movie and more like a music video, I understand that plot takes a secondary role but I would have appreciated if they ended the movie with a bit more context, and I am not referring to the contents of the bag because as a MacGuffin beacuse I am completely fine with it. It felt to me that screenwriting-wise they gave up in the last quarter of the movie."
Metallica,2lapwi,DrMond,5,Wed Nov 5 11:34:56 2014 UTC,I saw it in imax 3d as well and it intense. Made me sad I haven't had a chance to see them in several years also watch it monthly on blu ray

Metallica,2lapwi,matssundin1392,2,Tue Nov 4 22:44:15 2014 UTC,"Saw the premiere in TO. It was awesome. The sound was fantastic (Lars' base drum was actually audible!), the song selection was good, the story bits were weird, but entertaining. 10/10  Also, it was pretty neat to do a Q and A with them after. In terms of the bag, Lars said that it's whatever you want it to be."

Metallica,2lapwi,theoxfordtailor,0,Tue Nov 4 21:17:47 2014 UTC,"I enjoyed it. The best concert footage ever filmed.   But there was so much squandered potential. Metallica made the mistake of playing it safe. Sure, the whole movie was an experiment, but they played it totally safe where they could. They should have whipped out a song they've never played live before, maybe come with an original plot. Try this on:   Do you know why they spelled it ""Call of Ktulu""? Because if you spell it correctly, you summon the Ancient One. So, Trip, the roadie accidentally writes ""Call of Cthulhu"" on the official setlist. When the band plays it, Cthulhu is summoned. The Ancient One puts Metallica in a trance, forcing them to continue playing, only stopping when Trip recovers that bag, containing the soul of Cliff Burton. Cliff's soul brings Metallica back to their senses and they defeat Cthulhu with the power of heavy metal.   Just about anything would have been better than what they came up with."

Despite what they say about it being balanced, it was heavily biased towards concert footage.  I essentially watch it to enjoy a really well recorded concert. The camera angles were amazing. You get shots you just never get from regular footage.  I saw it with a friend who's never really listened to Metallica and she loved it which I found surprising to be honest."

And Kirk it seems to me has always just kinda followed their lead. Sometimes I dream about what Metallica would be like if they'd never kicked Mustaine out. In some ways Megadeth are definitely better than Metallica's later music; I mean, ""Low Man's Lyric""??

Metallica,2l5s85,ghibliblog,3,Mon Nov 24 19:48:00 2014 UTC,"Such great dynamics in this song. That's what I really love about this era of Metallica - they really got songwriting. They slowed things down and came up with some incredible textures and soundscapes to their music. For a heavy metal band bred on Venom and Diamond Head, that's absolutely staggering."
Metallica,2l5s85,Metallicarox,2,Mon Nov 3 22:24:59 2014 UTC,"I was just spinning my 1996 LP copy of Load on the turntable last night, and really loved the music.  It helps tremendously if you're a fan of '70s rock (Zeppelin, Sabbath, Purple, ZZ TOP, AC/DC, Sknyrd, The Who), since that's where Metallica's heads were at back then.  I always loved the sheer unpredictable variety of it all; you never know what's going to hit you next.  The ""conventional"" move for Metallica would have been to re-record the 1991 Black Album, or shamelessly rip off the Seattle sound (even though the Seattle Grunge Era had already ended by 1996). Instead, a progression of that successful formula into many new directions, full of rich, colorful guitar tones, and bursting at the seams with new ideas. These must have been fun albums to create.  I'm reminded of how Pink Floyd followed up Dark Side of the Moon with the radically different Wish You Were Here; The Who (Who's Next), Deep Purple (Deep Purple in Rock), Led Zeppelin (Houses of the Holy) and Black Sabbath (Sabbath Bloody Sabbath) are also excellent examples.  Oh, and Load sound a bit better on vinyl LP, deeper guitar tones and smoother flow. It would have been nice to have the end of ""Outlaw Torn"" on the end of side 4, but that's alright. It was a good fadeout, and that album really required a fade-out."

They could have added another chorus at the end there to tie it all together or something to end it with a band.

Metallica,2l5s85,ghibliblog,1 point,Tue Nov 4 01:04:02 2014 UTC,"The song kind of ends on a cliffhanger, without a final resolution, like, say, Abbey Road (""The love you take is equal to the love you make""). But think of Load as a concept album that details James Hetfield's personal struggles, his ""dark night of the soul."" He hadn't yet found his way out of darkness and addiction; he was still struggling.  Also, there's the Re-Load album, which is kind of a ""Godfather Part II"" to the saga. That album, of course, ends on a pretty spectacular final note."

Although I wonder if ReLoad is more of a Godfather Part III - flawed, but brilliantly ambitious in other places. The Godfather Part II is a bona fide classic through-and-through, and as much as I love Load, I can't say that about ReLoad."
Metallica,2l5s85,Blackadder18,0,Mon Nov 24 19:45:57 2014 UTC,"Re-Load is one of those albums you don't think much about until you play it. ""Why am I not listening to this album more often? This is really good?"" One thinks. Load has the better variety and more color, while Re-Load is more influenced by the ""live"" sound from their 1996 tour.  Anyway, Load/Re-Load is the Physical Graffiti of the '90s."

Metallica,2l24ct,Bwuhbwuh,1 point,Sun Nov 2 17:46:58 2014 UTC,"Well you can't let details like that stop you. The trick with tat's though is that you want something that will always look good.

When people see my metallica tattoo almost no one recognizes it so I have to explain what it is. And I wouldn't get just any band tat, but Metallica isn't just any band."

Metallica,2l14oh,CalFalpha,3,Sun Nov 2 03:17:58 2014 UTC,"I've cried during a few of their songs but not exactly Fuel and for different reasons haha.  I can relate to a lot of their stuff so sometimes I use their songs as a sound track when I'm feeling down because I can relate so well.  For example, I was having a really tough time because my girlfriend wasn't feeling well.  I won't go into specifics but it was not a very good situation to say the least.  I often use Bleeding Me as a motivator to stay with it and over come tough stuff even though it'll be hell because to me that's what the song is about.  I was home alone so I just put on the S&M version and sang along.  When it got to the chorus I got really into it and belted it out as loudly and as powerful as I could.  Then the bridge came and same thing I just belted it out and got really emotional and just started crying when James starts repeating ""I CAN'T TAKE IT. I CAN'T TAKE IT. NOOOO OH THE BLEEDING OF ME."" I just cried and let it all out.  It felt good man and felt like there was someone there who could understand.  No other band has been that way for me.  Not even my favorite band of all time Iron Maiden. James' lyrics and delivery coupled with incredible music to back it up that matches and sets up the mood perfectly is what makes Metallica great."

Metallica,2kzhgu,iameveryone2011,6,Sat Nov 1 16:19:36 2014 UTC,They need new mixes and masters for all their albums...actually load and reload sound great
Metallica,2kzhgu,arrocknroll,1 point,Sat Nov 1 21:36:43 2014 UTC,"Yea the Black Album, sonically, was flawless. Load and ReLoad were fantastic too but there is some clipping that could be resolved. Other than that, they sounded great.  The only Bob Rock produced album that didn't sound magnificent was St. Anger which sucks because if you listen to the alternate version of Some Kind of Monster on the Some Kind of Monster EP, it's on par sonically with the Black Album even with the snare-less drum sound.  The snare doesn't overpower the rest of the song like It can at times on the album and it actually sounds pretty cool. It still captures that raw feeling they were looking for on that album too. It's a shame because it shows it could have been much better than it was :(   Edit: For those of you who haven't heard the alternate version, you're welcome."
Metallica,2kzhgu,panickedthumb,2,Sun Nov 2 02:19:39 2014 UTC,"I have the EP but never actually listened to it. But hang on a damn second, are you telling me that the whole album could have sounded like that?  I just listened to them back to back. The alt version sounds to me like, purely, a different mix, not a different recording. You can still hear a bit of the snare clanging but it actually sounds appropriate. Damn that's good. I never cared for Bob Rock, but if he had the final say in the mix that led to what was released I'm even more unhappy with him."
Metallica,2kzhgu,ghibliblog,1 point,Sun Nov 2 05:47:56 2014 UTC,"I'm a great fan of the St Anger DVD performances. I thought those recordings were infinitely better than the CD, which was horribly brickwalled and crushed, and sounded less like a rock album than a computer collection of 30,000 digital samples. Naw, the live version sounds excellent all around. In a perfect world, Metallica would reissue THAT version on vinyl LP.  I'm also hoping that new reissues of the early LPs would be mastered more wisely. The 2008 LP reissues of the first three albums were just bloody awful, and there's no excuse for that."
Metallica,2kzhgu,tmthomsen,0,Mon Nov 24 19:56:27 2014 UTC,"Although I appreciate this alternate version of Some Kind of Monster, I actually think I  dislike this snare drum more than the original. It sounds so... fake and flat."

Metallica,2kggdv,posam,1 point,Mon Oct 27 14:41:47 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure the band has even said 2015.
Metallica,2kggdv,dujayy,6,Mon Oct 27 19:16:24 2014 UTC,"To be fair, they've also said every year since 2012."
Metallica,2kggdv,serosis,3,Tue Oct 28 10:00:18 2014 UTC,They specifically said they would be working on it this year. So expect a two year Escape From the Studio tour beginning next year.
Metallica,2kggdv,SnowHesher,3,Tue Oct 28 02:20:50 2014 UTC,"I seem to recall reading a quote from Lars where he said that with Death Magnetic they were trying to make a worthy follow-up to ...And Justice for All.  With their next album, the goal is to make a worthy follow-up to The Black Album.    So judging by that quote, the next album will probably have more of a mainstream metal sound to it than a thrash metal sound."
Metallica,2kggdv,CrentistTheDentist,1 point,Tue Oct 28 08:51:30 2014 UTC,They did a great job with that musically on DM.  But the mixing was not great. Here's hoping they try to achieve a great drum sound etc like on black.
Metallica,2kggdv,SnowHesher,3,Fri Oct 31 04:51:23 2014 UTC,You should see if you can find the Guitar Hero Death Magnetic mixes. Most people who have heard them agree that they're better than the normal mixes. I agree with that assessment.
Metallica,2kggdv,CrentistTheDentist,1 point,Fri Oct 31 05:41:55 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, forgot about those. If only they were the actual album mixes. But thanks for the reminder - I should just find a way to download those and just listen to those instead"

Metallica,2kggdv,arrocknroll,2,Tue Oct 28 02:19:30 2014 UTC,The only thing I remember him saying as to how it will sound stylistically is that Lords of Summer was a good representation of the style they were going for.  Sorry but I think you may have dreamed that up :/
Metallica,2kggdv,metalhead1h34,2,Tue Oct 28 05:06:03 2014 UTC,"I was hoping for shorter songs and more like black/load/reload, the 8 min songs get annoying and hard to listen to because they never end"

Metallica,2kggdv,kevonicus,1 point,Mon Nov 3 23:33:26 2014 UTC,"You know, I personally have a taste for long songs, but I definitely feel like a few songs on Death Magnetic were too long. Long songs are cool (my band plays 9-15 minute songs every once in a while), but you have to have enough riffs to make the song not sound like a verse and chorus on repeat (like That Was Just Your Life and The End of the Line feel, although I like those songs, they are repetitive). The long song format worked on Master of Puppets and ...And Justice For All, because the arrangements were varied and progressive, not repetitions of a verse and a chorus with minor variations on those two parts throughout the song."

Metallica,2kg2xx,UncleGoldie,0,Mon Oct 27 14:56:39 2014 UTC,"I feel like they've never been a band to really put a lot of value in having great album art. Unlike some bands, I feel like they make it a point to keep them subtle."
Metallica,2kg2xx,rodwool,1 point,Mon Oct 27 15:43:45 2014 UTC,Good point! I guess a band like Metallica don't need to worry about people picking up their records in a store based on the cover. The name is all they need haha

I first got into Metallica(and metal) because I walked into a record store and saw the display for Justice, and said to myself(having never heard a note of Metallica before) that I don't know what this sounds like, but I bet it sounds like nothing I've ever heard before.  I bought it and became a Metallica fan and metalhead for life.  So it was the cover of Justice that sucked me in.  That said, I've never been a huge fan of their covers.  I'd call St. Anger my favourite of all of theirs."

Metallica,2kc5dk,WonderfulJustWonderf,8,Sun Oct 26 02:03:57 2014 UTC,"I must have been in...7th grade. My neighborhood was having a collective garage sale thing, and I thought it would make me feel grown up to get involved. No one was around in my house so I took it upon myself to set up a little area on the driveway and layout some of my stuff I could part with. I opened up the garage and was digging around some boxes for any of my stuff I could sell when I came upon a disk with a sweet looking ninja star on it. It was my older brother's CD (Load) I could tell, so I figured it was worth a listen and plus I needed some tunes while I sat around waiting for customers. The computer was in the basement, which was connected to the garage so I was able to put the CD in and blast it while I sat outside.   At this point in my life I listened exclusively to my Beatles cassettes, so hearing the thundering guitar and drums coming from Aint My Bitch made me take pause. The garage sale was a bust but I didn't care; I sat at the computer with my headphones on and listened to Load straight through, in a trance. I was heavy, intense, the vocals were crisp and fluid, the guitars were doing things I had never heard before, it was almost spiritual. And I didn't even know who I was listening to.   I played that disk nonstop for... god knows how long. After a while, after he had seen me listening to it, my brother told me this was a band called Metallica and got me the Black Album that Christmas. Of Wolf and Man was the most metal thing I had ever heard. I sat in the top of our bunk bed and drew dragons and shit while that pumped in my brain.   I can still listen to nothing but Load for a month straight and not get tired of it. There's a song for every mood, every emotion.. to me, it's their masterpiece. And I still have that disk I found, with that sweet ninja star (which took me YEARS to realize was the Metallica ""M"").   I love that memory."

My bedtime was usually 9-930, so I would lie in bed making myself stay awake until 10, then tuned in on my mp3/radio player, and was usually too excited to sleep for a little while after the songs were over. I'd try to get shitty bootleg recordings using the record function on the mp3, then reup/download so I could listen to them later too. 11 years later, still one of my favorite bands, although I now have money to buy CD's and stuff (Sorry, Lars!).

Metallica,2kc5dk,Jakek97,3,Sun Oct 26 04:23:43 2014 UTC,"I first heard them around 2004 when the music video for the song 'Some kind of Monster' came on a music channel. I thought the song was incredibly boring and the band looked old and kinda lame (especially James with his hillbilly look at the time). From hearing that I immediately pegged them as a band I had no interest in and ignored their existence until I saw the video for 'One' on the same music channel about 3 years later and had my mind blown. They looked cool, sounded cool and were everything I wanted from a metal band haha. So yeah I blame the song 'Some kind of monster' for stopping me from discovering my favourite band of all time for so long. For the record I actually kinda like that song now!"

Fast forward four years later, and I was looking up ""hardest guitar song lists"", and Master of Puppets was number three. I looked it up on youtube, and slowly got enveloped in all the songs.

I never listened to any type of rock or metal before this besides linkin park and trapt. I loved the game so I decided to get it for myself. I remember when i got to the last song in the setlist, One by a band called Metallica. The funny thing is when i heard the preview i thought it SUCKED. The voice sounded weird and the song was so slow (keep in mind i was in middle school). I decided to give the song a try and my mind was BLOWN!!! I never heard anything like it, slow beautiful intros with depressing lyrics then goes to fast heavy riffs and ends with a heart pounding solo. It legitimately changed me as a person. I decided to study music and metal. I learned piano and guitar and to this day i havent stopped. My life is completely surrounded with music because of metallica and guitar hero."

Flash forward to about 2 years ago and I heard 'Fade to Black' on the radio for the first time (sad, I know) and thought ""Holy fucking shit, THIS is what I have been missing all this time?!?!?!"" and I immediately went out and bought Ride the Lightning. Then about a week later I picked up Master of Puppets and then I was hooked.  I just really regret not getting into them sooner.

Metallica,2k6ia5,Great_Shell,20,Fri Oct 24 08:37:59 2014 UTC,"Ping  I don't hate it, but it's hard for me to enjoy listening to it these days.   Edit: To elaborate a bit- The drum sound is honestly the biggest issue. I listened to that album a lot for the first year it was out and eventually the garbage can lid sound started to wear on me to the point that I really can't stand it any more. It's not as bad on every song, but it's there and it annoys me. I like the DVD versions and live recordings a lot more.  The other thing I don't like about many of the songs is that they feel really copy and pasted together and often kind of repetitive. St. Anger is a good example - I really like that song, but it feels like it's a couple of minutes too long and they just duplicated a big section for the sake of it being longer. Unlike other long songs it doesn't build on itself or change things up or get more complex or interesting - it just...starts over, almost like they felt, ""Well, this would be cooler if it were longer."" Ctl-C, Ctl-V  This isn't true of every song and isn't a blanket judgement, but I find I just don't get as excited or inspired listening to it as I do with other albums, where I'm still hearing new things even after listening to them (in my case) for more than 20 years. I think part of that might be that the drum sound gets in my way too much - there may be a lot more there I'm just not willing to dig out because I find that ping so annoying."

Metallica,2k6ia5,iameveryone2011,9,Sat Oct 25 01:53:31 2014 UTC,"I don't hate it necessarily. I resent it for not being more than it should have been. It was a long time between drinks so to speak and it was a bit of a let down. Apart from the weird snare sound (which was a nit pick in my eyes) it felt rushed.   Most of the songs were the same thing repeated to make up a bunch of time. There are a couple of songs like The Unnamed Feeling which were good. But the bulk of them were sameish and not what I'd come to expect from a Metallica album, especially coming off Load/ReLoad."
Metallica,2k6ia5,Sullo13,8,Fri Oct 24 10:27:56 2014 UTC,"I don't hate it, but it is my least favorite Metallica album. Reasons? Poorest lyrics of any album, bad drum sound and no solos.

Metallica,2k6ia5,Gronkbeast87,3,Fri Oct 24 15:40:40 2014 UTC,"Poorest lyrics of any album   It's no coincidence that coincides with other members of the band getting writing credits.

Metallica,2k6ia5,thatswhytheycallitsh,2,Fri Oct 24 21:16:07 2014 UTC,"These are easily his most personal, powerful, and emotional lyrics.  Unnamed Feeling, one of the best songs from the album, is absolutely amazing and I've heard of a lot of people that know exactly what James is singing about."

Metallica,2k6ia5,arrocknroll,10,Fri Oct 24 19:18:23 2014 UTC,"I would argue the Load albums do.  They are very personal and deep on an emotional level and you can tell James is pouring his heart and soul into every word.  Especially in the delivery.  Songs like Bleeding Me, Outlaw Torn, Fixxxer, Until it Sleeps, Low Man's Lyric, and the like give me chills every time I hear them.  Especially at the choruses. I feel like on that album they really championed the epic chorus.  Other albums had some really good choruses but I feel like on the Load albums James just really hit it home overall between the words themselves and the hair raising delivery."
Metallica,2k6ia5,mrana,3,Fri Oct 24 20:11:52 2014 UTC,"Agreed, I was just thinking about these as well.

Metallica,2k6ia5,j00ann0ym3,10,Sat Oct 25 04:50:07 2014 UTC,"I do not hate it. In fact, growing up in a fairly restrictive household, I didn't listen to Metallica as a kid. In 9th grade a friend gave me each CD one at a time and in chronological order, to introduce me to them. And then St. Anger came out. So it was the first Metallica CD to come out while I was a fan. It was different, but I liked it. I had to keep my mouth shut though because everyone told me it was crap.  Outside of the missing solos and Lars' constant use of the no-snare sound, I think the album is just fine. Plus it shows they've got some balls to make whatever music they want. Of course at that point they could afford to make a shitty album if they wanted to."

Metallica,2k6ia5,bleedingoutlaw28,4,Sat Nov 1 23:55:17 2014 UTC,"I don't like it. I've tried many times to let it grow on me but it never takes. I think it's the lack of creativity on the album. Maybe it'd be good if someone else wrote it, but it's not up to the level I expect from Metallica.   I find the songs are boring with barely any interesting riffs, drums or vocals to get attached to.  Given they're emotional states at the time it's no wonder. They know it's not their best work.  We shouldn't HAVE to like everything they do, because we are FANS not FANBOYS."
Metallica,2k6ia5,TomBonner1,5,Fri Oct 24 11:26:11 2014 UTC,"The songs are too disjointed and experimental for me.  I've always thought of music as a set of features (cool riffs, breakdowns, choruses, solos etc...) set on some kind of common core.  The features can be whatever but the core should make sense musically and should flow logically from start to finish.   Metallica will usually have a main riff that functions as the core that runs naturally into the verses and connects them to the other features of the song, but in St anger they seemed to just throw that away and randomly staple features together haphazardly.  There's some bit of every song on that album that I really like but overall the package of each track sounds to random for me.   Having said all that I don't really hate the album,  but it is their weakest offering by a fairly wide margin."
Metallica,2k6ia5,ghibliblog,5,Fri Oct 24 16:03:28 2014 UTC,"I'm treading no new ground here:   Drum sound: very underproduced, [insert comment about Lars' snare] Guitar tone: tuning to drop C was a poor decision. It really sounds like either they weren't sure how to make a guitar sound good in such a low tune, or they sincerely thought the guitars sounded good. Lack of solos: granted, I don't think solos fit within those songs, but as Kirk said on the dvd, by omitting solos the band actively dated the record to the early 2000s when nu-metal was in vogue. Poor songwriting: just overall, the songs are lackluster. In my opinion, they had been since Reload, but it shows greatly on St. Anger. I enjoy some songs (The Unnamed Feeling is a bright spot on the album for me) but overall the album suffers from a lack of quality. I hate to compare albums, but I view Metallica's post-Black Album material to lack the quality when compared to the albums that came before it. It shows most on St. Anger because the album did not possess the mainstream accessibility that Load and Reload had."
Metallica,2k6ia5,TomBonner1,1 point,Sat Oct 25 02:52:27 2014 UTC,"I will agree that down-tuning a guitar to C results in a muddy, rusty tone. It's not very pleasing to hear."

I used to be on the bandwagon and be like ""aw this is shit"", but besides one awful song (Frantic), it's a seriously good album (like, a 6/10). I'm listening to the entire St. Anger album as I type this, and it really gets me pumped up, and has way more emotion than any other Metallica album.  Regarding the songwriting, it's obviously not on par with the first seven albums, but still better than any other nu metal bands I've heard."
Metallica,2k6ia5,TheFriffin,2,Mon Oct 27 13:55:01 2014 UTC,"My dislike for the album mostly surrounds the misleading pre-release buzz, comments from the band during production, the horrific mis-management of the band by Q-Prime and Bob Rock, and it just not meeting my own expectations.  I remember respected people from the press who attended the press-only listening party writing afterwards on the internet ""OMG SO COMPLEX JUST LIKE JUSTICE!""  ""SO FRIGGIN HEAVY!""  ""THE SONGS ARE 8 MINUTES!""  Obviously this got my attention.  Then the band themselves were also comparing the material to bands like Meshuggah.  I remember the ""Jump In the Studio"" videos with Lars stressing that the new songs were heavier, and had double bass.  This also got me incredibly excited.  Then I remember the MTV Icon event, which at the end featured the very beginning of Frantic, which actually sounded pretty heavy and tight live.  I was still going nuts.  As a 17 year old who worshiped the first five albums, this was paradise.  I couldn't wait to see what Metallica was going to deliver.  The hype was incredible... all my friends and I did was talk about how excited we were for a new thrash metal Metallica album.  Obviously we know this wasn't what we received.  Everything that the press had written was wrong... it almost made me feel that the early reviews were fake.... plants from Q-Prime to build hype for an album that they knew wouldn't have sold on its own.  I remember watching the video for the title track and being so incredibly bummed.  My expectations were not met at all.  Then I remember going to the theater to see ""Some Kind of Monster"".  Though it's an excellent film, the content enraged me.  I was so annoyed at how horribly this band was managed... how horribly things were being handled, and at how poor the guidance from Bob Rock and Q-Prime was during this time.  It was a time where people were afraid to tell them ""no"", because they thought telling anyone in the band ""No, this isn't a good idea"" would engrage them and derail the progress of the album production, and theoretically stop the gravy train.    Though Metallica is obviously still a top tier performing act, they were worth a ton of money back in 2003, moreso than they are now in our current musical climate.  At the time, they were the second most popular rock band behind U2 (they even reference this in the documentary).  This isn't the case now... mostly in part towards the continued backlash against them after St. Anger was released.  They were a prime commodity at that time, and I'm sure in some board room somewhere, there was an initiative and a task put on someone's list to ""Get Metallica to release this album, no matter the quality, because the pent up demand for a Metallica album will generate high sales regardless of what the product sounds like.""  And sure enough, that happened.  Despite the fact that most people didn't like it, the album still sold like hotcakes.    I know the band defends the album all the time, and I myself will admit that there are decent ""ideas"" littered throughout the album.  However, there is no cohesion.  There was no guidance at a time when these guys desperately need this.  And I blame all of that on their management.  When this band has the appropriate time and direction, they are still capable of delivering quality music that the fan base can be proud of.  Death Magnetic proves that.  This was just miss-management to the nth degree."

Metallica,2k5aqs,SpudMonkey68,11,Fri Oct 24 21:29:04 2014 UTC,I would personally love to see what kind of interpretation could be done with ...And Justice for All as an acoustic album.
Metallica,2k5aqs,Wizard_of_Ozzy,8,Fri Oct 24 01:17:36 2014 UTC,Ever since their acoustic rendition of All Within My Hands I have wanted to hear what the rest of St. Anger would sound like.
Metallica,2k5aqs,serosis,3,Fri Oct 24 12:02:55 2014 UTC,it would be cool for Kill Em All accoustic
Metallica,2k5aqs,cliff_em_all,2,Fri Oct 24 03:21:33 2014 UTC,I really can't see how it could be any good. It'd be interesting but I just can't imagine it'd sound like anything other than weird mess. Too thrashy for acoustic in my opinion. Possibly though.

Though I'd much prefer it to not have vocals at all if it's acoustic.   Minus Human would be really cool as an acoustic interpretation. Not just played exactly the same way as it's played on an electric, it has to be beefed up like on Acoustic Wizard. Orion too..."

I'd like to hear Day that Never Comes right next to One on Justice, as I think they are very similar songs. I like Fuel right where it is, but I agree on Unforgiven and Of Wolf and Man. I'm not sure how you could make Roam more ominous than it already is.  I think All Within My Hands had the potential to be a great song if they had kept their Garage/S&M style going. The ""KILLKILLKILLKILLKILL"" spam at the end seems like it wouldn't have happened on any other album.  A weird one as an afterthough, but I think Sanitarium would be interesting to hear in the style of St. Anger (sludgy guitar, piercing snare, rough vocals).

Metallica,2jqxwu,zuzuotamutu,40,Thu Oct 23 02:16:48 2014 UTC,"Okay, so I'm going to try to limit this to MOSTLY advice about Metallica, and not about parenting, but here goes:   Metallica is profane in some regards, but it is CERTAINLY not excessive. I've been listening to Metallica since I was in middle school, and was surprised when I recently heard them curse for the first time. Now, when they curse, it's because:   A. It conveys the raw emotion in the song, such as in Dyers Eve or Damage, Inc.   or   B. It's in the moment of a live performance, which is a whole different story.   Therefore, if you want my opinion on whether or not Metallica is appropriate for a 14 year old boy, it's definitely one of the better things he could be listening to (go look up Chief Keef and come back to me), and with the internet these days, he will find any music he wants to. Also, Metallica as a band has matured in the 33 years they have been around, and seeing that prolonged maturity makes all the current members of Metallica excellent role models for your son.  However, if you ask me, I believe that even if Metallica was excessively profane, listening to it would be a healthy outlet for an adolescent. I believe that age 14 is a time where you as a parent should begin to show your child some freedom in his choices, especially in his tastes and passions. For example, restricting your child from performing PHYSICAL acts, such as doing drugs, is understandable, especially illegal acts. But restricting your son's choice of expression is something that in my humble opinion you should start thinking about loosening up on. This is for the following reasons. First, the type of music one listens to, especially a teenager, is largely the thing that defines him, but also helps him to release emotions in a healthy way. If you don't let him listen to music that expresses these feelings and emotions, he might find a different, less healthy outlet for them. For example, the reason I listen to Metallica is because a lot of their lyrical themes are about manipulation and feeling helpless. Whenever I feel injustice against me, I listen to songs that reflect that rather than lashing out at myself or others. Second, and similarly, not giving teenagers the freedom to express themselves is a recipe for a rebellious teenager later on. Ironically, there is a song by Metallica that expresses this concept very well: Dyers Eve. Dyers Eve is one of the few songs in which Metallica curses on the album version. The song is about parents who shelter their kids too much and, in turn, do not adequately prepare their child for the real world. Here is a quick excerpt from the song:    Dear Mother  Dear Father  What Is this Hell You Have Put Me Through  Believer  Deceiver  Day in Day out Live My Life Through You  Pushed onto Me What's Wrong or Right  Hidden from this Thing That They Call Life  Dear Mother  Dear Father  Every Thought I'd Think You'd Disapprove  Curator  Dictator  Always Censoring My Every Move  Children Are Seen But Are Not Heard  Tear out Everything Inspired   Here, the lyrics show the thought process of someone who was restricted as a child and all of a sudden had the world thrust upon them without any preparation, and he couldn't handle it. Obviously you only have the best intentions for your child, but as someone who grew up with a lot of people who had the same sort of childhood as the ""Dyer,"" the best thing you could do is to let your child listen to whatever music he wants to. As far as slowly giving him freedoms, so that they won't hit him all at once at adulthood, this is a relatively harmless first step. I'm sorry for the rant, but I am a huge fan of Metallica for the exact reason that I believe your son should listen to them.  *Edit: Besides for Damage, Inc. and Dyers Eve, if you still insist on blocking any songs, I'd stay away from some of the album Garage, Inc as well, although these are all covers so they're not even originally Metallica's profanity."
Metallica,2jqxwu,PiuEcho,12,Tue Oct 21 00:48:22 2014 UTC,"To add further:  this song is specifically about Hetfield's parents.  They were Christian Scientists and didn't believe in modern medicine. God's will be done, etc, etc.  His mother died from a curable form of cancer because they refused treatment.  The God That Failed also addresses this."
Metallica,2jqxwu,zuzuotamutu,2,Mon Oct 20 03:22:47 2014 UTC,"Right, and my point is that Hetfield believes that he ended up unprepared when he finally reached adulthood and immediate freedom from his parents."

Now I'm 15, and I appreciate Metallica as musically as ever while still being a classical music buff. The only album that has a lot profanity is St. Anger, and depending on your kids tastes, you'll probably never hear him listen to songs off of it. There are precisely 3 songs off of the first 5 albums that drop the f-bomb, and a couple more with lesser swears (damn, hell). Regarding lyrical content, there are some violent songs (My Apocalypse is rather gory and descriptive, One is very dark), but much of the lyrics are metaphors.  The profanity occurs in the following songs (off the top of my head; I know every Metallica song by heart ;D)   2 or 3 F-bombs in ""Whiplash"" (Kill em All) ""But damn it ain't right"" from ""Ride the Lightning"" (Ride the Lightning) ""Listen damnit, we will win"" from ""Welcome Home (Sanitarium)"" (Master of Puppets) 3 F-bombs in ""Damage Inc."" (Master of Puppets) One F-bomb in ""Dyer's Eve"" (...And Justice for All) Various swears (B-word, damn, ass) in ""Ain't My B****"" (Load) F-bomb in ""Fuel"" (Reload) A dozen or so F-bombs across the entire St. Anger album, along with a ""s***"" or two   Out of the dozen or so songs that have swearing, there's also a little questionability (like the word ""rape"" in ""...And Justice for All"" and ""Broken, Beat, and Scarred""), but there's still a ton of clean songs. In fact, almost all of their best songs (in everyone's opinion) are clean.   I hope I've helped; and I would say that it is fine if your kid listens to Metallica!  (Though, I'd advise you'd check out the cover song ""So What?"" before you let your kid listen to it... trust me...)"

While it's hardly Metallica's best, it's certainly a great place to start.   Then again, your son probably wants the ""good"" Metallica, or the old stuff. Try Ride the Lightning, which doesn't feature any hard swearing at all. ""Damn"" and ""hell"" are the only ""bad words"" on the record. The song on that record, For Whom the Bell Tolls, actually turned me on to reading Hemingway, so I can speak for Metallica being a positive influence, in many respects.   James Hetfield, Metallica's vocalist and rhythm guitarist, is not a bad role model for your son. In the early 2000s, he went to rehab and went straight-razor for the sake of his family. James actively tries to make modern Metallica shows more positive and family friendly."

I understand your concern about swear words and wanting to shelter your child from them for as long as you can, but, let's face it...he knows every single one of them by now, hopefully he knows not to use them with people he's not familiar with.   Now, the one thing that he won't really get from listening to Metallica (and this is an anomaly because almost every other band in the history of rock and roll has relied upon it) is sexually suggestive language.

Their studio albums don't usually curse except when maybe while writing the band thought they needed an extra edge to make to make others feel what they wanted by listening to it.    3.) live music curses far more although for more recent stuff they realized through having their own families that they could tone it down because fans would be brining their children."

Metallica,2jistt,RyanThePatriot,10,Fri Oct 17 15:06:37 2014 UTC,"I started playing guitar mostly because of Metallica and Kirk. I think when evaluating Guitar players some people get very stuck on technique as their primary concern. If that is the only metric we are going by then Kirk is not the most technical Guitar player out there.   I on the other had tend to enjoy Guitar players based on their style not their technique. Sure I want a player to have some technical ability but if they write something enjoyable then that is as important if not more important than technique.   Kirk is a well trained player. He has some classical backing from school and also studied with other big name players when he became famous. He is not the most technical player by any stretch of the imagination. However I really like his style as a player. I enjoy the ""Kirkisms"" in his playing and I find a lot of his style in my own playing.    Sure he is not going to sweep pick arpeggios at mach speed. He is not going to make his guitar talk to us using the whammy bar. You won't see him putting out a shitty solo album any time soon. But he will continue to crank out solid solos for Metallica that people will enjoy. I don't really know why some people have a problem with that. I personally like that they guy isn't so into himself to try and force feed us some album full of mach speed solos."
Metallica,2jistt,drascus,3,Sat Oct 18 01:24:35 2014 UTC,"Well, in my opinion, he is more diverse than you may think. The first four (and arguably five) albums, he has a very thrashy, in your face attitude about his solos. I would say good examples of this is anything off of Ride the Lightning (Creeping Death, Fade to Black, etc.), Master of Puppets (Battery, Orion, Damage, Inc., etc), ...And Justice for All (Blackened, Shortest Straw, Dyers Eve, etc.).   The Black Album is where I think his style becomes broader. Some things are still like the 80's stuff, like Through the Never or Wherever I May Roam, but there is softer stuff obviously like The Unforgiven and Nothing Else Matters.   Load and ReLoad is a great example of him branching out to a blues-like style. I do believe that Kirk took lessons during this time and learned new styles and techniques. Songs like Ain't My Bitch, Hero of the Day, and the Outlaw Torn are good contrast to his earlier work. ife Death Magnetic, to me, is Kirk trying fuse both of those elements together. That Was Just Your Life and My Apocalypse are very much old school thrash. Unforgiven III and Suicide and Redemption have a very good blend of both.   I Didn't include Kill 'em All because those songs solos were pretty much written by Mustaine, and Kirk took the first four measures of each solo and then changed the rest. St. Anger wasn't mentioned for the obvious reason that there were no solos on that album."
Metallica,2jistt,bfusco11,2,Sat Oct 18 02:16:48 2014 UTC,"Actually, I think the solo from Nothing Else Matters was James, not Kirk."
Metallica,2jistt,bfusco11,1 point,Sat Oct 18 22:32:26 2014 UTC,"Damn, your right. I didn't even think about that."
Metallica,2jistt,Agent_545,2,Sun Oct 19 00:30:59 2014 UTC,"Well first of all, he needs to stop being called The Ripper. That just makes things terrifyingly confusing between him and Owens.  Personally, I don't care that Kirk doesn't have the technical ability of others in the genre. He has (or used to have) one of the most brilliant composing minds in all of metal, when it came to writing solos. If you look at the classics up to at least TBA, you can't tell me there are many solos that, one, aren't very memorable, and two, don't fit the song they're in perfectly.   If I A/B them against Dave's leads on the early demos, for example... ugh. I'd take Kirk's any day.  Ride and Justice are particular standouts for me, solo-wise.  Edit: More thoughts-  I think a lot of the poor solos on Death Magnetic were a result of him not having much control over his own goddamned solos. Lars and Greg Fidelman kept telling him to be improvisational, and throwing away perfectly good solos because those two like the 'lively' versions better. Kirk had a composed solo for The End Of The Line which had some pretty cool licks in it, but we got the barrage of noise that ended up on the album (and I don't even mind it that much, I get the effect that they were trying to do with that, it just doesn't work in practice as much as the composed solo). Another example is this note in The Judas Kiss' solo. Kirk was pretty adamant about bending it to a higher note than what he was doing, you'll notice. Yet, what ended up on the album?"
Metallica,2jistt,my_clock_is_wrong,2,Sat Oct 18 10:10:18 2014 UTC,"Kirk is the reason I picked up the guitar when I was 13.  He has the chops when he needs to. I think sloppiness comes down to practice. It seems that when not on tour or in the studio he's off doing other things and not living and breathing his body of work. Who cares. In that regard he relates to a lot of us.  Most of his solos he can play but if anyone is looking for note-for-note renditions of their stuff live then Metallica is not for them. A lot of their songs are dumbed down for live performance, especially these days. I'm sure 30 years of heavy riffing has done wonders for RSI and Kirk would be no exception.  Just meeting him and shaking his hand is still on my bucket list, if only for the inspiration he gave me back in the day (even if I could never play any of his licks...more of a follower of James in that regard)"

Metallica,2jistt,Sabres00,1 point,Fri Oct 17 19:01:56 2014 UTC,"I think Kirk's insistence on using a wah is what really limits what he could do.  With all the technology out there he could really do some interesting stuff, but he pretty much does the same things.  I saw a post about James solos, and I actually love his solos, I don't think you need to shred to have good stuff.  It's actually one of the reasons I like the newer Mastodon stuff, their solos are so ambient and different then the standard shred/squeal/harmonic stuff you hear in metal."

Sloppy, yes, he is. But all the solos for their songs are crafted to the song, and I really can't feel a different solo would work at all. He just nailed the tone/style/etc.  I haven't followed them since the 90's, so I don't know if he's gotten better or worse. I currently lean towards worse, judging by the Black album, and the times I tried listening to their newer stuff."
Metallica,2jistt,scArryy,6,Fri Oct 17 17:21:05 2014 UTC,Do you have any source to back up your statement? Because James and Kirk have quite different styles when it comes to soloing and all of the solos in 80's and 90's sound a lot more Kirky than Jamesy.
Metallica,2jistt,drascus,2,Fri Oct 17 15:25:16 2014 UTC,This is just not true. They were just on Howard Stern recently and James said flat out that he lets Kirk write the solos and doesn't really want to be involved with that. He said very plainly that he thought Kirk was better at it.

I think James would find it easier writing music than lyrics and vocal melodies, so just by the fact they contain no vocals would suggest to me they'd take less time to put together. Especially when you consider Metallica's method of writing is to just piece riffs together.  The only thing that would possibly make things harder is that you have no vocals to work off to know where you are in the song which is probably why Kirk was complaining about being overwhelmed with Suicide & Redemption.  Fuck I love that these guys are the only guys who consistently make epic instrumentals that aren't filler tracks."

Metallica is hugely popular with vets, so it makes sense. This is going to be a hugely popular event, I'm pumped. They're expecting 250,000 people. I can't wait to see the streets lined with tanks and guys with machine guns (as they do for large events in DC).  Metallica is really on top of their game now. They pretty well fucking killed it at the grammys, and I think a lot of people have a renewed interest. I think they were at a low for a while, but they're doing amazing now. Can't wait to see One live. I'm guessing their setlist will include For Whom The Bell Tolls, One, Puppets, and Sandman. It'll probably be a short show they're having several mega bands.   I'm not really sure how this will go since they have like 10+ mega artists playing, and it starts at 7pm. It might just be like a few songs, then on to the next artist.

Metallica,2i9g49,Nik62982,4,Sat Oct 4 13:33:27 2014 UTC,Just look at the certifications each album as received and add them up. I think people were a bit surprised when they saw Load at no.2. This album was the first album released after the black album where they gained a massive amount of fans along with their original fans.
Metallica,2i9g49,Nik62982,-1,Sat Oct 4 16:51:39 2014 UTC,"Puppets sold more albums than Load in the US, right? Isn't it more likely that Wikipedia just doesn't have all of the international certifications listed? Also, certifications mean different numbers in different countries."
Metallica,2i9g49,Nik62982,1 point,Sat Oct 4 17:13:14 2014 UTC,MOP sold more copies than Load in the US by a bit. And you're right about the certification thing too. Platinum in the US is 1 mill where in Canada I think its 100k and places like Greenland its 2000. I added the actual copies sold.
Metallica,2i9g49,daroobster,-1,Sat Oct 4 17:24:52 2014 UTC,I think you added right. I just don't think Wikipedia is providing you with all the numbers unless Load was an abnormal international success.

As blasphemous as that may sound, I just always assumed that Cliff was right there with James and Kirk in terms of notes, but it's a far more stripped down version of the guitar riff...which I DO realize is the bass players MO, but isn't it sort of common knowledge about Metallica that most of the bass riffs follow right along with the guitar riffs?"

Just something I found once upon a time.  Also, realize this was their first album. Later stuff (which I'll make available soon) sounds better.

One could pass by okay, I think, as it doesn't criticize the military as much as it tells the tale of the horror that a soldier has to go through as a result of sacrificing his own life. I'm sure there's lots of injured vets that would like it if they gained a little more respect based on the details of that song.  I'd say songs like Disposable Heroes, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and No Remorse are right out. Those are direct attacks on the war mindset (which I'm not saying is a bad thing, I agree with Metallica on the stances in those songs) that I think could run slightly contrary to the overall spirit of the event."

Metallica,2hwnfb,dr_oog,2,Wed Oct 1 16:25:37 2014 UTC,The 'don't give a fuck' attitude is very much a Lars thing and I've always admired him for it. It's very unexpected but kind of awesome knowing that this attitude or persona of his probably came as a result of him discovering Oasis. I honestly think it has helped him through times where he has had to deal with a lot of shit like Napster and everyone bashing on his drumming skills. I like Lars. He created something for the ages.

They will never record anything similar to any of those albums again. they can't, nor should they try. that's the beauty of music, any given recording is supposed to capture the emotion and talent of where that band is at that particular time.

Metallica,2hut6u,Quenadian,1 point,Tue Sep 30 23:35:18 2014 UTC,"You are not the ""fans"" Ulrich talks about..  There was a drastic change from AJA to TBA.         After,  Metallica never made any records on par with their first four entries, and they probably never will recapture that magic again.  Metalica made good and even great records since, but that can't compete with a masterpiece or in their case,  4 in a row each better than the preceding one."

Metallica,2hut6u,kevonicus,1 point,Wed Oct 1 03:23:20 2014 UTC,I think Load and Reload are hard rock masterpieces. They just don't get the love because it isn't classic Metallica. I always said if some new band had made those albums they would have been praised as genius.
Metallica,2hut6u,Quenadian,1 point,Mon Oct 6 02:52:18 2014 UTC,"I couldn't disagree more.  For a record to be a masterpiece, every song on it has to be good.  It's very rare in any genre, the genius of Metallica is to have 5 of them if you include TBA, which IMO is a ""radio friendly metal"" or ""commercial metal"" masterpiece.  Less interesting musically than the previous 4 but very efficient with great hooks and great riffs on every songs.  Besides Load and reload are not really hard rock albums, their more Metal/grunge experiments with hits and far too many misses to be called masterpiece.  That doesn't mean Load and Reload are shit, far from it. Their more like what most bands usually produce. Actually, I think they are still superior to most bands, because of the good/bad song ratios. But that's still a big step down from what they've accustomed their fans to, which is why, along with the huge musical genre switch, they had such a big backslash."

You can prefer Load all you want and it's quite ok, but all artists create art of varying quality, at one point they reach their plateau, and usually decline after.

I agree with everything else you said, by the way, except for your use of ""objectively.""  I prefer the first four albums, because subjectively, I like them better.

Metallica,2hcvig,keitarno,3,Thu Sep 25 23:55:20 2014 UTC,Should be pretty easy to tell.. the horn in Unforgiven 1 is an A and in Unforgiven 2 it's an Ab (as that entire album is recorded with guitars in Eb)

Metallica,2hb9g2,RJB6,11,Wed Sep 24 08:18:08 2014 UTC,"Once you hit the black album lyrics start to get a lot deeper and more personal. Not digging at the older albums lyrical content, but to me the mid-late (load-st anger) albums have the most meaning lyrically. There are a lot of songs that once you really sit down and look into, are actually really fucking deep."
Metallica,2hb9g2,earthwormjim91,8,Wed Sep 24 12:11:32 2014 UTC,"Uh uh! No! They sold out! They went mainstream and made radio friendly songs!   /s  For real though, some really good content in the Black-St Anger albums, lyrically"
Metallica,2hb9g2,UncleGoldie,7,Wed Sep 24 12:41:44 2014 UTC,"Black album was really the only ""mainstream"" album they've had. Load and reload were pretty alternative."

Metallica,2hb9g2,ScoutzKnivez,8,Wed Sep 24 20:06:29 2014 UTC,James did actually hate that song though because the record company made them record a radio song. It's still hella good though.
Metallica,2hb9g2,earthwormjim91,3,Wed Sep 24 20:08:25 2014 UTC,"Glad to hear someone say this.  I was a latecomer to Metallica ('99 at the age of 18), so I had everything up to S&M dumped on me at once.  I'm glad for this, as I saw it as one body of work, not ""pre-Black"" and ""post-Black"" as so many people did. I love all of it, but each album for different reasons.  Load and Reload have connected with me on a deeper level than any of their other music because of the vulnerability, introspection, openness, and sincerity of much of the lyrics.  Though they're not as ""heavy"" as some of their other stuff, I think they're much darker than any other albums.  Much of their earlier work sounds very angry, but can also be more of a surface emotion, whereas what's expressed in Load and Reload is much closer to the core, much more despairing, much more self-loathing.   EDIT: Why did I get downvoted?  Was it because someone didn't agree with me or because my comment really contributed nothing to the discussion?"
Metallica,2hb9g2,MoBaconMoProblems,6,Sun Sep 28 02:06:35 2014 UTC,"What really gets me is when people equate speed with heaviness. Sure Master of Puppets was fast, but it also had that heavy fucking chugging along and that bass. Kill em All wasn't even all that heavy. It was fast, loud and angry. More like a more grungy punk.   Just listen to Black Sabbath. Some of the heaviest music around and it isn't all that fast at all. The War Pigs opening is heavy as hell. Sad But True is another example. Slow, chugs along, but has the weight of a tank behind it. Same with a lot of load and rwload, but more nuanced. It's got the bluesy heaviness and bass, along with heavy lyrics."
Metallica,2hb9g2,earthwormjim91,8,Sun Sep 28 03:13:09 2014 UTC,"I remember James talking about it a long time ago..this is the story behind the song, or at least the thinking behind it..  ""Wasting My Hate"" was a line that James got from his buddy Waylon Jennings who was sitting somewhere in a diner, and there was another guy outside in a car stairing at him. So Waylon stared back with hate, and when he finally had had enough he went out to talk to the guy in the car, only to find out that he was sleeping. Waylon thought ""Oh man I've wasted my hate on this guy"". He told James the full story and James liked the line so much that he used it for writing a song about it."

Metallica,2h38jh,spoonard,9,Mon Sep 22 03:03:57 2014 UTC,"I figured it was since Garage Inc. wasn't any of their own material, they just went with out there videos. Whiskey in The Jar is an old Irish drinking song about excess, so the video matched.   Turn the page was about life on the road and personal feelings, and their version has a very heavy feel to it, so the video matched as well."
Metallica,2h38jh,earthwormjim91,4,Mon Sep 22 03:19:42 2014 UTC,"Whiskey in The Jar is an old Irish drinking song about excess   No it isn't. It's a song about a highway robber. Sure, he gets drunk in the song but it's more about the betrayal from Molly leading to him killing the captain and being imprisoned."
Metallica,2h38jh,Matthew94,6,Mon Sep 22 08:06:51 2014 UTC,"A drinking song isn't usually about drinking, just something to drink to. Also the song is over 300 years old. Look at any drinking culture. Cowboys drank to sings about their girls, soldiers drink to songs about battle, back then in the late 1600s highway bandits were revered in Ireland because they usually robbed from the Englishmen who were occupying Ireland. Like fuckin braveheart.   The song is about a highway bandit that gets jilted by his lover, kills the British guy, and goes to prison. Sounds like the Irish equivalent to a hank Williams song. Definitely an old pub song to drink to."
Metallica,2h38jh,earthwormjim91,-3,Mon Sep 22 11:49:23 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure if this was Metallica's interpretation, but I'm pretty sure Turn The Page is talking about the life of a prostitute.

Metallica,2grtsl,III420III,8,Fri Sep 19 04:57:14 2014 UTC,Let me answer that for you as a 46 year old who has been a Metallica fan for 30 years.  Still a metal head.  Was a little worried during the Load years and the Napster thing but they are a band that cannot die.  They just got bigger and bigger but I think the non stop touring helped.  But never would I have thought that 30 years later I would still be going to see them in concert.  How kickass is that.  Metal up your ass!!!

Up until then it was Judas Priest and the Irons, Ram it down, Vengeance, Defenders, Number of the Beast, Powerslave was my playlist..then i heard Battery, Master, Sanitarium, Orion, Damage..JESUS FUCKING CHRIST! Hit the cd shop that week and just kept getting blown away with Ride and the 'new album' AJFA..man, it was a metal heads dream :)  Took me until '98 to finally see them on the Poor Retouring me gig..haven't missed them since in Oz. And yes, those load years were worrying, especially when one wanted some of that pure thrashtallica again. I remember being so disappointed after hearing the whole album on release day, took me some time to mellow into their new found groove.   What are your thoughts on the current sound, as in Lords of Summer ?   And yes.. it's been a brilliant journey listening to these lads as they pound the metal around the world. Fun fact, seeing Judas Priest in February here in Brisbane..now there is a band i never thought i would be going to see in 2014 !"

Metallica,2gowdu,whosline07,7,Wed Sep 17 20:00:24 2014 UTC,"Check out The Who's ""Behind Blue Eyes"". The bridge is very reminiscent of this part of The Outlaw Torn. Obviously James took inspiration from there.   When my fist clenches, crack it open  Before I use it and lose my cool  When I smile, tell me some bad news  Before I laugh and act like a fool  If I swallow anything evil  Put your finger down my throat  If I shiver, please give me a blanket  Keep me warm, let me wear your coat"
Metallica,2gowdu,RJB6,3,Thu Sep 18 10:29:23 2014 UTC,"Cool stuff, had never looked into the lyrics for that song. Definite inspiration."
Metallica,2gowdu,GuitarGreg,4,Thu Sep 18 11:16:56 2014 UTC,"To me this song is about being lonely, love-wise, and otherwise. ""So on I wait my whole lifetime."" The Outlaw.  I've always seen James as a bit of a joker, in a general sense. A very easy-going guy. Most interviews you see of him, he is laughing and smiling and cracking silly jokes. Meet & greets, same shit.  ""And if my face becomes sincere"" --> watch the fuck out, basically.  I don't think it has to do with control, but more so that a sincere face for him signifies he is not amused, to put it lightly."
Metallica,2gowdu,Nano1523,1 point,Thu Sep 18 01:30:55 2014 UTC,"In the Some Kind of Monster he says that with Jason he was very controlling in the sense that he didn't want Jason in the band he made (EchoBrain).

Metallica,2gowdu,GuitarGreg,1 point,Thu Sep 18 04:43:48 2014 UTC,"Yes, you are right. I don't think that has anything to do with the Outlaw Torn though. Nothing about that song sounds like it is about Jason.   ""I ride the dirt, I ride the tide, for you."" Sounds like a love to me."

Metallica,2go607,kevonicus,6,Wed Sep 17 16:13:30 2014 UTC,Hell yeah. Load is probably my favorite album of all time. I wish I could find more music like it.
Metallica,2go607,earthwormjim91,4,Wed Sep 17 22:34:06 2014 UTC,The whole album sounds like whiskey soaked guitar riffs. I love it.
Metallica,2go607,GuitarGreg,4,Thu Sep 18 01:46:32 2014 UTC,"Agreed.  I think those albums were a really interesting direction for the band to explore and they seemed to have an unexpected flare for... what is it... western metal?  Load had a heavier twang to it than Reload did, but it was still present in the second album and I thought really showed their depth as artists. My only real disappointment about those albums is they just sound a little dampened... muffled... compared to everything else, which I think is a shame because some of the guitar work is so rich and thick.  I doubt it will ever happen, but I vote yes for Load3."
Metallica,2go607,MoBaconMoProblems,2,Thu Sep 18 04:07:45 2014 UTC,"I remember how much some people hated those albums when they were released. But I never grew tired of defending Metallica and I'm very proud that they took such an adventurous route. However, I'm glad they went back to they core foundations. I've been a die hard loyal fan for 28+ years and it's been a in ride."
Metallica,2go607,Matthew2470,3,Thu Sep 18 04:39:02 2014 UTC,"I'm 31 and Load is pretty much responsible for the start of my fandom. Guess that's why I have a special place in my heart for that style. I love their early stuff just as much but I want to see them continue to evolve and do new things. Death Magnetic was a great mix between old and new. I just hope Lords of Summer isn't indicative of their next album because it seemed like more of the same of Death Magnetic. Even if it is, I'm sure it will be awesome, I just hope they add some new elements."
Metallica,2go607,Matthew2470,1 point,Thu Sep 18 04:46:09 2014 UTC,Lars had stated that LOS is the direction they are heading. What makes the album will likely be better than that but it's a fun song to blast in the car.
Metallica,2go607,watties12,2,Thu Sep 18 13:09:50 2014 UTC,F-YES  Honestly at this point though I just wish Metallica would do another album :/
Metallica,2go607,justo316,2,Thu Sep 18 06:29:20 2014 UTC,"I would only for the fact I get 2 albums to look forward to.  But I loved Load and was pretty disappointed with ReLoad. ReLoad had some great songs on it, but it was the shitters that put me off. I pretty much just add the half I like to my Load playlist and call that an epic album."
Metallica,2go607,Toneloaf,2,Thu Sep 18 11:47:08 2014 UTC,I want the next album to have the same production value at least.
Metallica,2go607,the_rabbit_king,2,Mon Sep 22 02:44:03 2014 UTC,"I think it makes more sense given their age and maturity as songwriters. Plus, I feel some of his most emotional and heart-wrenching stuff is on Load. Maybe we'll get a bit of that on this next one. It would be good to have the variety."
Metallica,2go607,NCleary,2,Mon Sep 22 22:54:46 2014 UTC,"I agree. Probably 2 of my favourite albums of theirs, I can listen to them no matter what mood I am in"
Metallica,2go607,shockfyre227,2,Wed Sep 17 18:48:52 2014 UTC,I'd like to see an instrumental album in that style. Mainly because I felt like Hetfield's vocals kinda clashed with the overall feel of some songs.  Give me Re-Reload with some sexy guitar work and I'd welcome it with open arms.
Metallica,2go607,Matthew2470,3,Wed Sep 17 19:56:47 2014 UTC,Not really. Those were more like boogie albums than heavy metal. I like those albums but I'm glad they moved past that phase.
Metallica,2go607,Matthew2470,3,Wed Sep 17 21:31:04 2014 UTC,"I'm not saying they go back to exactly what they did, but I would like to hear them do some more hard rock than metal type stuff. I think they're amazing at it. I just hope the new album doesn't sound like a continuation of Death Magnetic. I like Death Magnetic but Lords of Summer sounded like it could have been on that album so I hope they change things up a little more when they get in the studio."
Metallica,2go607,earthwormjim91,-3,Wed Sep 17 22:43:30 2014 UTC,Metallica is a metal band. Leave the hard rock to Nickelback and their ilk. I'm glad that the new album will be a continuation of Death Magnetic.
Metallica,2go607,MoBaconMoProblems,2,Thu Sep 18 01:55:57 2014 UTC,"Metallica is a band that does whatever they want. Thrash, heavy metal, bluesy hard rock. They don't fall under any umbrella."
Metallica,2go607,Matthew2470,1 point,Thu Sep 18 02:42:42 2014 UTC,"Metallica is a metal band.   Maybe you should tell them that. I'm sure they appreciate their ""fans"" telling them what they are and what music they're allowed to write."
Metallica,2go607,MoBaconMoProblems,2,Thu Sep 18 04:03:07 2014 UTC,Oh jesus christ. They are METALllica. They play metal. They love metal. They epitomize metal. They are proud to be metal. They are not an emo band and they aren't an alternative band. They have delved into many areas but they love to bring the heavy.
Metallica,2go607,xtylerryanx,3,Thu Sep 18 04:26:07 2014 UTC,And they still enjoy the Load/Reload material. It is possible for them to have broad enough interests that they would enjoy metal and heavy alternative.  What a staggering concept... and yet... oddly enough... that's what we see.
Metallica,2go607,Matthew2470,2,Thu Sep 18 04:29:29 2014 UTC,Metallica is not a metal band. They are a group of musicians who seek to explore their creativity through music and art how they chose

Metallica,2go607,yoda46986,1 point,Sat Sep 27 17:35:30 2014 UTC,"Load/Reload are my favorite albums as well. Such as nice mixture of sounds of old and new. Also, those albums basically had to be redone after the first try because the band was not happy with the product. Most of what you hear on those albums are mostly completely rewritten material or reformed songs from the original.  PS. I know alot of bands re-record in studio frequently, but this was pretty much a complete overhaul."
Metallica,2go607,daMATT487,1 point,Thu Sep 18 13:34:29 2014 UTC,"I love this album! 1996 was a great year for music(Aenima-Tool became my favorite album of all time!) This has got to be easily in top five of all time. It was definitely James's best album (both lyrics and guitar playing wise) and Jason rocks the bass in this album. You can actually hear it. Also, imo, it's the best mixed album in the catalogue with plenty of bass in it. Reload is terrible, they are the leftovers right?, besides Carpe Diem Baby and Fixxxer. If they do this type of album again and experiment, I'll be happy because with LOS they are trying to play music that they are too old to play. I don't know but when I listen to it, I feel something is missing...something important.But they do need to change and experiment. I also think that James should do solo project cause rob and Kirk stink, imo, or a supergroup thar plays hard rock songs. Maybe with Danny Carey, Jason Newsted, and the man, Dave Mustaine. That would be awesome!"
Metallica,2gmap3,Gamerhcp,11,Wed Sep 17 01:38:36 2014 UTC,"Info and progress about the album has been all over the place for the past 2-3 years. One of the only concrete things we can take away is the band saying James has a crazy amount of riffs (500+ IIRC) recorded on a hard drive and they're just trying to filter through those and see what they can build. I think I also remember Lars saying during a Meet and Greet that they have a few songs, and for now are just code named as various cities.   And I found the quote you were talking about:   ""I can tell you, all kidding aside, I'm pretty convinced that 90 percent of the record is actually written, it's just gotta be kind of assembled between all those riffs. It's just a matter of connecting this to this and sort of shaping it into a song. And so, I'm pretty psyched about that.""   Source"
Metallica,2gmap3,SGT_756,8,Wed Sep 17 03:25:01 2014 UTC,"No wonder Death Magnetic sounds like pull a riff out of a hat all over the place, I guess that is how they write now...sigh"
Metallica,2gmap3,iameveryone2011,2,Wed Sep 17 14:02:00 2014 UTC,Technically that is how all the albums were written. It is just the storage media for holding audio has become much more advanced quite quickly between then and now.  If James had a two terabyte hard drive in the early 80's I am sure it would have been filled up before the release of Kill 'Em All.

Metallica,2gmap3,timbo4815,0,Wed Sep 17 04:20:09 2014 UTC,"I know, but Rob said they're going to 'write' songs..oh well, they've been saying that all the time"
Metallica,2gmap3,onehipwonder87,4,Wed Sep 17 10:15:35 2014 UTC,I remember reading in 2012 it would be released in fall 2014. >:0
Metallica,2gmap3,JayMayo,6,Wed Sep 17 13:25:53 2014 UTC,"As far as I understand, James writes riffs all the time and records them. So to Metallica nowadays, starting work on an album means going through James' riffs and deciding what riffs to use and how to build songs around them, at which point Lars comes in to lay out the drums and arrange the riffs and everything, then Rob lays the bassline and Kirk thinks of a solo.   What Lars means by 90% of the album being written, is that he's convinced most of the riffs and melodic lines they'll use are already on James' riff collection, they just need to find the right ones and put them together. I'm sure 10% means everything else the other guys do, plus the occasional riff they may right on the spot.   That's what I take from all their statements. I don't think they're lying, they just have a huge amount of Jaymz Riffs and they're taking their sweet ass time to go through them and start building songs. Is this the right way to write an album? No idea, but we can only hope it will be on par with DM cause I doubt they'll ever write Master again."
Metallica,2gmap3,dr_oog,1 point,Wed Sep 17 14:29:48 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's not only James that writes the riffs. As far as I can tell from interviews and such is that every band member has 'riff tapes' that they go through.  They've done it that way for years and years.
Metallica,2gmap3,JayMayo,0,Wed Sep 17 22:00:39 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure James writes most of the riffs, and he's the one the band relies on in terms of guitar writing. Yes, Kirk wrote some riffs, ironically their most famous one (Sandman) and a couple of others. Newsted wrote a riff or two. Even Rob got some input in. But those are the exceptions.   James writes the riffs. I'm sure all of them come with ideas and some of those ideas get used (remember Rob's flamenco playing?), but again, that's not the norm."
Metallica,2gmap3,littlefishguy,1 point,Thu Sep 18 03:45:47 2014 UTC,I remember reading that Kirk came up with the main Enter Sandman riff and James and Lars tweaked it. That would be a crappy band if you had no input into basic song creation.
Metallica,2gmap3,JayMayo,0,Sat Sep 20 14:04:57 2014 UTC,"I thought it was common knowledge amongst everybody who likes Metallica that James and Lars run the show and do all of the creative process, and the others just pitch in here and there, but only with their approval.   You can even hear that in interviews, James and Lars clearly said that when looking for a bassist, they were looking for someone who would be comfortable in the backseat while they ran the show.   So yeah, not the best band to be in if you're a Dave Grohl-type who always has to write music and do stuff. That's exactly why Newsted left."

Metallica,2giyzg,roflocalypselol,9,Tue Sep 16 03:42:44 2014 UTC,Lots of emotion packed in but it isn't the mess that is St Anger. Good balance. Orchestral part helps with the depth.

I actually forget that it exists every now and then until it pops up to say hello during a shuffle.  Simple and heavy, it would sound very boring without the live energy and the orchestra."
Metallica,2giyzg,MoBaconMoProblems,3,Tue Sep 16 18:22:04 2014 UTC,Why didn't they play Fade to Black? Seems a great fit with the orchestra. LOVED that they did both bleeding me and outlaw torn. both brilliant.
Metallica,2giyzg,Acillatema,1 point,Tue Sep 16 22:24:51 2014 UTC,They tried to do: -Fade -Harvester -...And Justice -Both Unforgivens -Through the Never -Low Man's  -Wasting my Hate -Ronnie -Mama Said  But hadn't played them live in forever and with the minimal time to prep had to cut the ideas. I agree Fade would've been incredible but they picked a very nice mix

Metallica,2g14kg,a_weiner1993,3,Wed Sep 10 19:02:30 2014 UTC,"What, where? They have not issued any new audio recordings or re-issues on Blackened yet. Perhaps it's an earlier issue with the new logo added to the packaging."
Metallica,2g14kg,porter_esq,3,Wed Sep 10 21:37:33 2014 UTC,"They released them in August, that being said was there an issue with the earlier issues?"
Metallica,2g14kg,porter_esq,3,Wed Sep 10 22:03:04 2014 UTC,"Huh, I missed that. I have an earlier reissue (pre-45rpm) and it's clean.   Are these new ones really remastered or just reissued?"
Metallica,2g14kg,HeisenBergeron61492,2,Wed Sep 10 22:59:22 2014 UTC,"Apparently they are just reissues, my mistake mixing my wording up. That being said, I previously had purchased the black album from the warner bros issue, and had the same problem I am now."
Metallica,2g14kg,JSX13,2,Wed Sep 10 23:01:28 2014 UTC,I have the skipping problem with my WB released vinyls of MoP (which is completely unlistenable as a result) and TBA. My RtL also has severe pitch fluctuations and gets incredibly noisy towards the end of each side. I know it's not my turntable because none of my other records from other bands have had any sort of problems. Just poor manufacturing or qc on the part of Warner Bros. I suspect.
Metallica,2g14kg,JSX13,1 point,Thu Sep 11 00:55:26 2014 UTC,Is your needle clean? Is your arm tracking to heavy? is the record clean? What is your counterweight set too?
Metallica,2g14kg,JSX13,2,Thu Sep 11 00:00:57 2014 UTC,"I have a crappy crosley, I'm lead to believe that's the reason why. I'm really not an expert when it comes to record players, I have been looking for an upgrade for some time."
Metallica,2g14kg,FlamingSeahors,5,Thu Sep 11 00:05:15 2014 UTC,Probably exactly that then! They set the tracking weight way to high and that needle is eating away at your record and destroying it. I'd upgrade to an audio technica lp-120 or maybe a pro-ject elemental. The elemental is the one I have and its excellent!
Metallica,2fybyl,DaveMcElfatrick,6,Tue Sep 9 23:04:55 2014 UTC,"Cool solo...I'm a big Exodus fan, but the rest of the song doesn't interest me much. This is actually the best thing for Kirk to do to prepare for the new album in my opinion...  This solo almost reminds me of the aggression of the AJFA days, and since Metallica is (seemingly)heading in that route with Lords of Summer, working with Exodus can do him some good."

Metallica,2fybyl,PopPop-Magnitude,3,Wed Sep 10 06:41:22 2014 UTC,"He had a really good solo in '08 on his collaboration with K'naan, but it was more of a soulful solo than a thrash shred. This was so refreshing to hear"

Metallica,2fmnkv,acidfro420,4,Sat Sep 6 10:42:12 2014 UTC,I have Master of Puppets on vinyl and it had that label on it but there isn't a change in the loudness. I doubt they would alter their albums for a reissue
Metallica,2fmnkv,Dreax,3,Sat Sep 6 13:49:30 2014 UTC,"Actually its common for reissues to be compressed a tad so there is less dynamic range for the sake of ""more volume"".

At one of the large London stations, we were on a travelator (a flat kinda escalator that only takes you along and not up and down) we saw a group of 8 dudes all wearing metallica shirts on the on going the other way.

I tried to brush it off, but soon found that I liked this new mysterious song coming through my wall. So, I had to get up and ask him what the song was. It was No Leaf Clover. It became my favorite song of all time.  Another moment for me would be when I saw them for the first time on Aug 17 / 2012 at the first TTN Concert in Edmonton. When they came out with that super stage and started playing Creeping Death and James started singing the first verse, there was this amazing moment of ""I'm finally seeing them"" (I'd missed a concert in Calgary in 2008 due to a brutal leg injury, and had been waiting for them to come back since), not to mention just looking at the super stage all lit up was amazing."

James was doing that thing where he shouts at the crowd and they shout back. Went on for about 5/10 minutes, then he just got this wee smile on his face (you could see it on the screens at the side of the stage) and just jumped on the spot. Pretty much the entire crowd watching all jumped on the spot as well. The thud as thousands of people all landed in unison was a pretty awesome feeling."

Metallica,2flynq,MoBaconMoProblems,5,Sat Sep 6 03:21:10 2014 UTC,I think he might mean he fingerpicks the first part of the solo (the clean part) or maybe the intro. I've only ever seen him use a pick for the heavy part.

Metallica,2flynq,Arian88,2,Sat Sep 6 04:13:45 2014 UTC,"Indeed. Whenever I play the solo on guitar I use hybrid picking. That is, I hold my pick with my thumb and index finger, and the middle onwards pluck the strings.

Metallica,2fm5gn,100yearoldWhiskey,3,Sat Sep 6 04:54:50 2014 UTC,"I would do ""Fight Fire With Fire"" and I actual wrote a speck script for this idea. Start in a medieval ballroom for the opening of the song, which is filled with lords and ladies dancing in time with the music. Then, when the song gets faster, cut to a an angry mob of peasants, led by a barbarian who looks kind of like Braveheart. They storm into the castle and start slaughtering all the party guests. Then the entirety of the video would then cut from brutal sword fighting, and the king (who was sitting on a thrown at the far end of the ballroom) running for his life. The leader of the revolution then chases down the king, kills his guards and slowly makes his way towards the grovelling king. At the end of the video the leader of the revolution would be at the top of one of the towers of the castle holding up his sword (it was originally the king severed head, but I changed it because of recent events) as lightning strikes behind him in the distance. The lightning strike would go in time with the lightning in the song.  TL;DR: ""Fight Fire With Fire"" set to a medieval revolution."

Metallica,2fb0ic,RyanThePatriot,6,Tue Sep 2 23:34:24 2014 UTC,Just the two.
Metallica,2fb0ic,RyanThePatriot,11,Tue Sep 2 23:37:09 2014 UTC,Lars is in pro tennis and Kirk is in pro vegan

Metallica,2fb0ic,MadAMGreene,0,Wed Sep 3 06:37:11 2014 UTC,Broke his wrist skating and delayed a tour if I remember correctly.  That was back when they weren't as well known as they are now.
Metallica,2fb0ic,jtj-H,1 point,Wed Sep 3 13:12:06 2014 UTC,"It was during the MoP or AJFA tour I think, so they were pretty well known. Also I don't think it was delayed (maybe one show) as they had someone fill in on guitar for him and he still did vocals."

Metallica,2fbqo9,luis138,4,Wed Sep 17 13:59:20 2014 UTC,Why end in disaster? Besides the big personality clashes I think it would have been a hell of a band.

Metallica,2fbqo9,padsboltssaints15,-1,Wed Sep 3 21:44:12 2014 UTC,Agreed.  Also how was cliff and Daves relationship in the band?  Edit. Or were they even around each other? Didn't cliff come after dave? Wow I just realized I don't much about pre killem all.

And I realize it may not be a must-play choice for the fans, but dammit, it's a great song to me and it's pretty much one of the only songs they have never played live.  I believe they've done every album in its entirety up until Metallica, so maybe when we get to 2017 they'll play Re-Load in its entirety?"

It seems they call themselves Tired Of Counting.  By the way, that cover of Super Mario was REALLY awesome too.   (Wow, I'm really spamming a lot about this guy. I think I must be in love with him or something, holy shit...)"

Metallica,2f5xb9,TheMetaI,2,Mon Sep 1 21:49:45 2014 UTC,"Damn this dude is accurate. I spend a lot of time listening to the master drum tracks of a lot of their songs (mental exercise, I play the guitar in my head, it makes weak points obvious) and he is nailing it. I wish I had someone half as good as him nearby.  For all the shit Lars gets (and I give him some too), the dude is a drum master."

From what I have heard, James had been messing with the songs for years. I think they had the basics laid down from around the KEA days."

The break down has that telephone effect on the vocals. After the ""fall in love with life again"" line, the effect is removed. That moment when the band stops and James sings ""so tell me, can you heal what fathers done?""  The way that song is written, you can feel the intensity building. The end of that break down just begs for an explosive transition out. They absolutely nailed it, in my mind.   I still prefer a lot of the older material, but there is some fantastic song writing on Load and Reload."

You know, the part you never see them playing much anymore? That solo, and the riff behind it, is a thing of awesomeness.  I'm a huge fan of Hetfield's phrasing. I don't care too much for lyrics, as such, but the delivery of the vocals is pure class. There are too many examples of them to list really, but pretty much all of James' vocals on Justice were awesome."

I would search through my Dad's cassette tape collection and look for the coolest looking covers and give them a listen.  I found Ride the Lightning and immediately fell in love with Fight Fire With Fire.  I didn't really start listening to them more often until years later, I must have been around 9 or 10, when I begged my dad to let me get Master of Puppets when I found it in a Walmart.  I didn't end up with that album but I did walk out of there with The Black Album so I was a happy boy.  I listened to that casually for a number of years but got really into them when I found a bunch of their CDs at Best Buy.  I walk out with Master of Puppets, Load, ReLoad, and Death Magnetic and just absolutely fell in love with Metallica.  Master and Death Magnetic I fell in love with almost instantly. Load and ReLoad didn't start growing on me until just recently. I now own their entire discography and listen to them 24/7 :D"

That same evening , I was changing the channel to MTV to see if ""I Disappear"" was on , in total coincidence , there was another song by Metallica called ""Fade to Black"", it was MTV classics, so I listened to it and I was like 2 songs by the same band that I like. I went over to my cousins and told them about the songs and they too had noticed the band, and we downloaded a couple of songs like ""Master of Puppets"" and ""Harvester of Sorrow"" , and we fell in love with the band.  To get the albums, during our birthdays , each of us would gift each other an album of the band so that we could share the music with each other , so we bought ""Ride the Lighting"" , ""Master of Puppets"" and ""And Justice for All"" that same year and discovered that we love this kinda music."

Fade To Black, One, Sandman, Memory Remains, Unforgiven I and II, Anywhere I Roam, and one more that I can't remember (this was 17 years ago). I listened to it religiously. When I got a bit older I found dad's full albums (post Black album), so I nicked em. Then I learned that Metallica had a whole history before these albums, so I went out and bought them all. Got a Metallica tattoo when I was 18, and still love them just as much as I used to.   I still remember the moment I realised they were the greatest band on the planet: listening to the black album in full for the first time, and Wolfman comes on, and the second line, ""out from the new day's mist I have come"". When James does bit where his voice wavers down on the word 'come', that was it. The vocalisation on that one word took me from ""this band fucking rules"" to ""this is the greatest band of all time""."

I think Gojira pulled this song off perfectly, the heavy tone of Gojira's guitars goes really well with the large amount of chugging in Escape, also the growling vocals gives the song a whole different feeling to Metallica's more melodic singing. Love both versions, Metallica's is still the best but Gojira's is fantastic too."

Metallica,2ed5ni,Spidersham51,2,Sat Aug 23 18:14:57 2014 UTC,"I personally like it when other, more modern metal bands cover Metallica because it almost always ends up being more fucking metal.  Don't get me wrong. I love Metallica but I find the audio quality of their pre-Black album stuff to be a bit dated. I wouldn't even mind if the band rerecorded some of their stuff like they did with Orion for Through the Never. Hell, I'm pretty sure St. Anger could do with a rerecording considering that album was mostly marred by shitty instruments above anything else.  EDIT: here are some other covers for you guys to enjoy. I know a number of you enjoy classic metal more than the kind of screaming and growling and that's fine. Just wanted to show another perspective.   Cannibal Corpse - No Remorse Vader - Fight Fire With Fire Ensiferum - Battery Periphery - One (WARNING: Djent)"

Metallica,2ed5ni,TheMartinConan,2,Sun Aug 24 12:59:36 2014 UTC,By that I'm assuming they reissue Justice in a way where you can actually hear the bass :)
Metallica,2ed5ni,clydefrog811,1 point,Mon Aug 25 03:38:57 2014 UTC,Yes with bass in it.  I remember seeing a documentary on the making of the black album and in one scene James is at the mixer and he goes here's the thickner which was Jason on the intro of sandman.  Before the thickner was justice after the fooling around it was the way we here it now.  Load and reload were recorded really well as well.

Metallica,2e0ek8,Vnaan,36,Tue Aug 19 19:21:14 2014 UTC,"St. Anger is a good album for what it is.  It's not a pretty album at all and in a lot of ways it makes little to no sense musically at all. It's ugly as hell and that's exactly why it's awesome.  It's pure anger in musical form and it's not apologetic about it at all.  Metallica used this album as a musical stress ball and used it to let loose the numerous issues they had at the time and that is very apparent in the music and lyrics.  When I listen to this album, I use it in much the same way.  It lets me just go wild and let all my negative emotions free.  You can't really do that with Load and ReLoad.  They were more elegantly crafted, professional sounding songs while St. Anger was the exact opposite and it was meant to be that way.  It's raw, unadulterated, unrelenting metal.  It's not meant to sound pretty. That's exactly why it's awesome"
Metallica,2e0ek8,arrocknroll,5,Tue Aug 19 19:43:02 2014 UTC,It's pure anger in musical form    I couldn't enjoy St. Anger at all until I quit looking for anger in it and realized it's about frustration.  Then it all clicked and I've loved it ever since.

SKOM is the most notable offender.  And as much as the drum sound is terrible, it's James' voice that really turns me off here. When he forces a low or high note, or growling it just sounds so cringeworthy, and frequently off-key.

It even has the same outro where the band stops after the bridge, main riff plays then everyone comes back in. Also a very similar build up throughout the intro where instrumentation is introduced one after the other. After the verse a similar shift in the pre-chorus but in this song it goes to A instead of F#. It's clearly structured after ES since the former is their most successful song of all time."

Metallica,2dj6zq,justo316,1 point,Thu Aug 14 14:01:14 2014 UTC,Me too.  Also first song I learned to play all the way through.
Metallica,2dj6zq,scottycujo,0,Thu Aug 14 20:05:43 2014 UTC,Very easy opening riff. Anyone who is a fan of Metallica and plays guitar should be able to master this simple but great riff.
Metallica,2dj6zq,CalFalpha,0,Thu Aug 14 13:04:11 2014 UTC,"This needs a lesson?  The only thing tricky about this song is when they take that piece and transpose it up to F#/Gb for the ""Sleep with one eye open"" bit.  Give yourself more of a challenge, like the intro to Blackened or the fucked up galloping in Battery."
Metallica,2dj6zq,serosis,1 point,Thu Aug 14 21:03:06 2014 UTC,"True.  I may have sounded a bit harsh in that post but I stand by its point.  Enter Sandman is literally one of the easiest songs to learn of theirs, next to anything from St. Anger."
Metallica,2dfa9n,ffviiac,3,Wed Aug 13 10:03:48 2014 UTC,"Watched an episode of Pawn Stars the other day, and they bought some chick's jacket and banner for about $1500. Both were signed by all four including Cliff."
Metallica,2dfa9n,Metalligit,3,Fri Aug 15 09:44:32 2014 UTC,"That's awesome, now I want a jacket hah"
Metallica,2dfa9n,my_clock_is_wrong,4,Fri Aug 15 11:54:31 2014 UTC,"depends what it is and how prolific he was signing shit when he was alive.  e.g. a signed LP of MOP will be worth more than a signed LP of KEA simply because there was less time for him to sign the former. Also, really early stuff will be worth more than something from 1984/1985.  Middle stuff I see go for $100-$200 depending on the item. Pre-fame or very late stuff would be worth more. A signed stub of the concert from the night he died would be quite the collectors item.  If it were mine and genuine, I'd just frame it."
Metallica,2dbn1z,megabreakfast,14,Tue Aug 12 10:10:21 2014 UTC,"The intro to Battery is done on a few guitars so I doubt that they would have. Plus, imagine the setup. It makes sense to switch between an acoustic and an electric for Fade to Black or maybe unforgiven, but it seems to much hassle just for an intro."
Metallica,2dbn1z,mike135,9,Tue Aug 12 10:37:05 2014 UTC,I'd just love to see it :(
Metallica,2dbn1z,Homer_JG,5,Tue Aug 12 12:18:22 2014 UTC,"I would too but Mike is right. They recorded that in the studio using several layers of guitar tracks, so even if James and Kirk played it live, it wouldn't sound right."
Metallica,2dbn1z,Herr_Opa,2,Tue Aug 12 21:10:52 2014 UTC,"There's plenty of other stuff they used multi-layered guitar on the recordings but not live, but I suppose when they're mid-song and the bass/drums back them up, they can afford to lose some rhythm guitars for the dual lead work."
Metallica,2dbn1z,Herr_Opa,1 point,Wed Aug 13 05:29:13 2014 UTC,"Speaking of that, I personally don't like when they play Master live and go into that double harmony solo before James' solo. It sounds so empty in the background, that it seems to me like someone got their instrument unplugged.  In S&M it was cool because the orchestra backed it up, but it always annoys me live. Same thing with Creeping Death."
Metallica,2dbn1z,Herr_Opa,1 point,Sun Aug 17 02:07:47 2014 UTC,"I know what you  mean, but the dual lead is the focus there not the chords in the bg. When it's live it's so loud that it doesn't feel like anything is missing anyway so it's not so bad.  Also S&M is my fave live album so I agree with you there, the orchestra makes it. Also if you can find it, someone dubbed the orchestra parts over the original recordings of the tracks, that's a cool album to listen to"
Metallica,2dbn1z,okjust1or2,1 point,Sun Aug 17 02:16:24 2014 UTC,"Totally agree. And I saw them live and didn't notice it. It's only when I see a video of them doing a live show that when they mix everything, you can hear that hole in the sound.   I wonder why they don't just have one guy with an effects pedal and a harmony setting play the solo and the other guy plays the background chord."
Metallica,2dbn1z,echoplexe,1 point,Sun Aug 17 05:04:58 2014 UTC,Hm that never sounds quite as good. Also it's far cooler to see dual lead than an effects pedal!

Metallica,2dbn1z,Agent_545,1 point,Wed Aug 13 05:30:26 2014 UTC,The only problem is that it is 4 guitar parts. They would need two more guitar players live. On the record I'm sure each part was doubled bringing it to 8 total.
Metallica,2dbn1z,SpudMonkey68,1 point,Wed Aug 13 06:56:23 2014 UTC,"True, but using that reasoning pretty much every guitar part is doubled on every recording to beef up the sound, so it doesn't matter too much anyways I guess."
Metallica,2dbn1z,scleroderma,1 point,Wed Aug 13 09:49:50 2014 UTC,"Excepting 9 times out of ten its the same ""part"" doubled. So live Kirk and James both play that part. In this case its at least 4 different parts to make up the harmony that is the intro."
Metallica,2dbn1z,scleroderma,1 point,Wed Aug 13 14:07:43 2014 UTC,I mean literally every nondemo guitar track they've done is doubled (if not tripled or so on) per guitarist.   So 4.
Metallica,2dbn1z,thepistonhead,1 point,Wed Aug 20 11:22:33 2014 UTC,I meant 4 different actual musical parts. Not the same part doubled. Harmonys
Metallica,2dbn1z,scleroderma,1 point,Wed Aug 20 18:02:12 2014 UTC,"Aye, I'm with you there. Was just saying multiplying that by 2 cause of doubling wouldn't really matter, since they play all their doubled studio tracks with one guitar each live."

Metallica,2cox78,Allenrw3,6,Tue Aug 5 14:44:22 2014 UTC,...and yeah's for all They have somewhere around 12 hours of studio music so Metallica is .04 percent YEAH
Metallica,2cox78,mrana,2,Tue Aug 5 17:51:20 2014 UTC,"What's your favorite YEAH? Mine is from right before the Nothing Else Matters solo, where he unleashes a YeeeYEEAHHHHHHH!"

Metallica,2cmh0j,lenuhc,16,Mon Aug 4 20:58:01 2014 UTC,"Would have liked to have heard more from James, but great stuff from Kirk!"
Metallica,2cmh0j,vestergaard92,11,Mon Aug 4 21:52:30 2014 UTC,I love how he admits that he hears people bash him for over-using the wah pedal too much.
Metallica,2cmh0j,hellrazzer24,15,Wed Aug 6 05:06:30 2014 UTC,"I really enjoyed that. As a non-guitar player, hearing talk about how much work went into their songs with structure and equipment is crazy. I knew how talented they are already but it's nice to really see them talk about it."
Metallica,2cmh0j,RKRagan,10,Mon Aug 4 23:17:13 2014 UTC,"As a guitar player, I love this sort of stuff. Every detail about Kirk's inspirations for his work, which has inspired me greatly, is fascinating to me. This article also reminds me that I really need to study up on my music theory."
Metallica,2cmh0j,ateoclockminusthel,1 point,Tue Aug 5 00:32:18 2014 UTC,"It was a solid slap in the face for me, that if I ever want to even be remotely close to his level at some point in my life, I have a heck of a lot of exercising to do."
Metallica,2cmh0j,Laxerapz,10,Fri Aug 8 12:31:09 2014 UTC,"James is bring honest, Dave's lyrics were terrible and slayer will never do a ballad, he is saying what we already know"
Metallica,2cmh0j,PerpetuallyPineapple,7,Tue Aug 5 00:57:05 2014 UTC,"Very enjoyable read, but I was surprised at how critical JH was of other bands (""Dave's lyrics were stupid"", slayer saying they wouldn't do ballads was ""bullshit""). I don't necessarily disagree with him but surprised he's put it out there like that."
Metallica,2cmh0j,Tbh2006,5,Mon Aug 4 23:22:32 2014 UTC,I thought that too. They were pretty honest about it.
Metallica,2cmh0j,RKRagan,3,Tue Aug 5 00:00:15 2014 UTC,"anyone know when the interview actually took place?  it's nice to hear kirk talk passionately about the work on load and reload.  i know i'm in the minority, but i really love that late 90's era of metallica.    i feel like the band is currently ashamed of those albums.  :("
Metallica,2cmh0j,geekedoutcoolness,3,Tue Aug 5 19:19:16 2014 UTC,That interview is very old.
Metallica,2cmh0j,Matthew2470,2,Tue Aug 5 04:00:14 2014 UTC,"I would've loved to hear about the Metallica during the 2000's, but regardless, still a great little article!"
Metallica,2cmh0j,Spiderman97828,1 point,Tue Aug 5 04:09:52 2014 UTC,"HETFIELD ADMITS TO STEALING THE RIFF IN SANITARIUM!   Link to song  Quote from article:   ""Welcome Home (Sanitarium),"" Master of Puppets (1986) HETFIELD: The idea for that song came from the movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. “Fade to Black” worked well, and we wanted to have another slow, clean, picking type of song, this time with a chorus. I had trouble singing that chorus. It’s really high, and when I went to sing it in the studio, I remember Flemming looking at me like, “You’re kidding.” I said “Shit, I don’t know if I can do this!” So I ended up singing it lower than I intended, but we put a higher harmony on it and it worked pretty well. The riff for that song was lifted from some other band, who shall remain anonymous.   EDIT: Not bashing the band, I love Sanitarium and all but c'mon...thoughts???"
Metallica,2cmh0j,xtylerryanx,4,Tue Aug 5 01:49:16 2014 UTC,".thoughts???   One song only, could be worse I guess. Led Zeppelin did their fair share of yanking ideas/parts of songs from others, they appear 3 times on this list and here is another list of 7."
Metallica,2cmh0j,SGT_756,1 point,Tue Aug 5 06:52:20 2014 UTC,"I agree 100%, but the real difference is knowingly going ""hey, I'm gonna use the melody/riff/etc. from this song in my song"" and subconsciously/unknowingly using a similar piece of music in your own song"
Metallica,2cmh0j,xtylerryanx,1 point,Tue Aug 5 07:16:58 2014 UTC,I think this is what he's talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4F0skwb__A

Metallica,2cmh0j,xtylerryanx,1 point,Tue Aug 5 15:43:45 2014 UTC,That's it. Someone posted this on the metallica forum 10 years ago and they went nuts.
Metallica,2cmh0j,hellrazzer24,1 point,Wed Aug 6 05:06:01 2014 UTC,"He could be talking about the riff in the middle section. I remember they've joked around about it being Rush's song ""Tom Sawyer"""

Metallica,2cn397,metallicabmc,2,Wed Aug 6 04:20:01 2014 UTC,Awesome pics. Did they give any info out about when Tallica Parking Lot will be released? Mention anything about new music or new special editions of through the never?
Metallica,2cn397,kevonicus,1 point,Wed Aug 6 10:22:37 2014 UTC,They said soon to both of those things and they screened the short for us twice.
