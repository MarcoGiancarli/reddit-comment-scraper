Next step we'll polish them up and make tidy packages on a nice base, I'd like to do a riveted copper boiler. Also have a dynamo for mine and will likely add a phone charging / USB slot."
steampunk,3dzqr2,JustCallMeDave,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:39:08 2015 UTC,I'm trying to understand: is the vtwin powered by air which is supplied by a propane powered turbine? If so....où est le steam?
steampunk,3dzqr2,JustCallMeDave,2,Tue Jul 21 01:42:15 2015 UTC,"No the v twin is on air for the test and set up play, the turbine (second half of the video) was fed raw propane by my co-conspirator. He enjoys flames, but he got more than he bargained for. The comment above explains the future steam and fun, it'll get there, we've just started."
steampunk,3dzqr2,JustCallMeDave,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:13 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, I was confused. I thought the 2nd video was your competitor. So in the future iterations there will be a tiny boiler? Wow, proof of concept that bad boy and get it on kickstarter! Nice job!"
steampunk,3dzqr2,JustCallMeDave,2,Tue Jul 21 02:37:02 2015 UTC,"Ha! Could be missing the boat for sure. Yea, think we still have mixed messages the turbine that bursts into flames, that is indeed my competitor / best friend / coworker's, but he was running propane through it to make a show of it. Toasted his ceiling nicely.   My V-twin I'm running on air in the video while we mock them up. I'll do the little boiler indeed, riveted copper, on a nice wood base. It only needs a handful of PSI to sharpen a pencil, I'm feeding it 50 in the video and have already cracked the block and silver soldered it back together once."
steampunk,3dzqr2,JustCallMeDave,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:18:01 2015 UTC,Cool video and nicely engineered device either way.  Your post got me curious so I started looking at other mini steam powered devices. They are cool but tend to run on methanol. Wonder if there is a more accessible fuel source for the boiler.
steampunk,3dzqr2,forgotpassword69,2,Tue Jul 21 03:23:28 2015 UTC,"We're fortunate to have a many thousands of gallon tank of methanol at work, price is right. It's still available as ""wood alcohol"" in most hardware stores, or as fondue fuel in the grocery store in small quantities."
steampunk,3dzqr2,_Lady_Deadpool_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:01:08 2015 UTC,"available as ""wood alcohol"" in most hardware stores, or as fondue fuel   Agreed. My thought was, however, that it would seem to be really convenient if it could run off a different fuel source. Something readily available in your corner store such as, for example, lighter fluid."

steampunk,3d8u01,jaketrunk,10,Tue Jul 14 12:09:12 2015 UTC,"Georges Melies.  He more or less invented steam-punk before the was a punk to get steamy about.  The Scorcese film ""Hugo"" gives the readers' digest version of his career.  He invented or stumbled onto many of the early film effects.  If you see ""Hugo"" or talk to a film geek you will find out that he is an early film god.  Insanely prolific and every effects driven movie you have ever seen has him as its grandfather.  Endlessly creative and inventive and more wit in a two reels than much of what you find in a feature film today.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s"

The movie features appearances from authors, musicians, makers and more, including William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Cory Doctorow, China Miéville, Cherie Priest, Gail Carriger, Abney Park, Unwoman and many more.

You can't glue some gears on it an call it steampunk. Thats bad. Thats crass, low effort and harmful.  Steampunk is an alternate historical asthetic driven by the alternate spread of steam power in the victorian era. (And if you checked the dates, that would include the westerns) Now, when you build steam machinery, you need rivets and googles and steam powered vehicles, but simply having those does not make something steampunk.  If your work includes decisively advanced items like electrical tube valves, highly controllable articulated joints, electrical systems, jetpacks, then it's not steampunk.  Wild Wild West is better steampunk than this game, being a: set in the right era, b: with consistent technology, and c: respecting the bounds of the genre.  Rocket Knight is good. It's a fantastical game with good play and story.  Don't insult it or the genre by calling it steampunk."

steampunk,3axvo4,Ontopourmama,-1,Wed Jun 24 17:27:10 2015 UTC,I can't take boobs here seriously anymore after learning that there were tons of videos and tutorials dedicated to making your boobs look huge for cosplay.

steampunk,3axvo4,OurSponsor,2,Wed Jun 24 23:46:09 2015 UTC,Whoever is making those tutorials should be commended. They're doing god's work.
steampunk,3axvo4,Ontopourmama,-27,Wed Jun 24 21:27:13 2015 UTC,"That woman is rather plain and you are calling her a beauty because of her breasts.  You are only posting it because she has large breasts.  This shit does not belong here.  I can only imagine how painful it is for women who want to participate in this sub, but what constitutes a good Steampunk outfit for a woman is the size of her breasts."
steampunk,3axvo4,Geofferic,5,Wed Jun 24 14:59:35 2015 UTC,You calling her plain and claiming her breasts are the only redeemable quality about the photo says more about your character than the photo does of this sub.
steampunk,3axvo4,Yackemflaber,-2,Wed Jun 24 22:50:30 2015 UTC,LOL  Only because you believe there's something wrong with being plain.  YOU are bring YOUR problems with women just being people and not being your masturbatory object of the evening to the conversation.  YOU are scum.
steampunk,3axvo4,Geofferic,0,Thu Jun 25 17:23:49 2015 UTC,"This is hilarious!  Just because there is nothing wrong with being plain doesn't make it less insulting that you went out of your way to tell the world that she wasn't a ""beauty"" to you.  Think of it if the tables were turned. Someone posts a photo of you in some cool getup, captioning it ""Handsome Getup"". You're feeling pretty good about it, and then some girl comes out of nowhere and says: ""That man is rather plain and you are calling him handsome because of his bulge.""  Doesn't that just hurt like hell? Doesn't it hurt to know that, in this hypothetical situation, some girl went out of her way to announce that no, you're not handsome, they were clearly just talking about your dick? How shallow is that hypothetical person to judge your appearance and then immediately deduce that there is NO POSSIBLE WAY that the person was talking about your actual appearance?  That person is you."
steampunk,3axvo4,Yackemflaber,0,Thu Jun 25 20:31:08 2015 UTC,Says a misogynist.   Lolol
steampunk,3axvo4,Geofferic,2,Fri Jun 26 01:44:14 2015 UTC,"I love how we're arguing over who's more feminist than whom.  I mean, to be totally real with you, I don't doubt that this photo got so many upvotes over some other content I've seen on here because of the boobs in question (for the record, I myself have not voted up or down because I find the photo to be neither particularly good nor particularly bad). And who knows, maybe the OP posted it thinking that the noticeable bust size would be easy karma.  But we don't know that for sure. All we know is that this is a steampunk subreddit, this girl is in steampunk attire, and the OP finds her beautiful for an unstated reason. I see no crime here."
steampunk,3axvo4,Yackemflaber,9,Fri Jun 26 02:57:06 2015 UTC,"What exactly is wrong with the outfit, pray tell?"
steampunk,3axvo4,BigBassBone,-15,Wed Jun 24 16:20:07 2015 UTC,I made exactly zero comments about the outfit or the Steampunk nature thereof.  None.
steampunk,3axvo4,Geofferic,8,Wed Jun 24 17:08:58 2015 UTC,You said it doesn't belong here. It would only not belong here if the outfit weren't steampunk enough. What other possible reason for it not belonging could there be? Are you seriously shaming this woman simply because she has large breasts?
steampunk,3axvo4,BigBassBone,-16,Wed Jun 24 18:11:07 2015 UTC,It doesn't belong here because it's been posted solely for the breasts.  It's not remarkable or interesting or novel as Steampunk - it's quite pedestrian.  It wouldn't be here if not for the breasts.
steampunk,3axvo4,Geofferic,8,Wed Jun 24 18:16:37 2015 UTC,"Thankfully, you're not a mod then or this place would be a ghost town..."

steampunk,39y7ur,sculptedpixels,2,Mon Jun 15 21:22:18 2015 UTC,These tubes have about 21k hrs on them currently with no problems.  The lifespans can vary quite a lot depending on the voltage and frequency settings.  If set properly it is not to uncommon for tubes to last between ten and twenty years.

The the painted nerfgun and bad wig really top it off.  The backgrounds lighting is not consistent with foreground. Plus it is quite apparent the elements of the background  are individual pieces brought together in photoshop. If you studied with the best in the world then you did not get your money's worth from their instruction. This composition is amateur and I have seen better from high school freshmen.

Once I'd figured out how to repair it, I sculpted the original spacebar a bit with my dremel, 3D-printed a rim for it  (in ABS plastic) to match the other keys, painted it and the original spacebar with an oxidizing bronze finish, and added a piece of rattan to the top.  Once I figured out how to do the spacebar, that basically was the end of the project. It was, embarrassingly, about 2 years from start to finish. Now that it's over I need a new hobby."

So you've got a modern gun, dieselpunk goggles, nativistic swimsuit, dimestore skirt, feathers (possibly matches the nativistic thing), randomly grabbed pendant, and just for shits and giggles purple hair and nails.  This may come as a shock to you, but while there certainly are some horny kids in here that will upvote anything with breasts, being pretty does not alone qualify your photos as Steampunk."

steampunk,391crz,Geofferic,2,Mon Jun 8 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"First off, I'd like to say that the model is great!  I like the powerful stance, the distant gaze (I'm assuming through the goggles) and the confidence.    The outfit has a lot of good elements which you could try to bring together.  The suede fringe top and the necklace remind me of a steampunk theme with a desert feel.  The goggles are classically steampunk and look very well built.  The big, black satin skirt, purple hair with feathers feels a bit more cyberpunk to me.  (Or maybe a victorian vibe like this skirt )The gun is cool on its own accord but seems too modern for a steampunk gun and not futuristic enough for a cyberpunk gun.  I personally like the mixture of elements because it offers something different.    One thing I would add is a common theme to tie everything together.  I often have problems doing this myself, but I find that its easier to do if you ask the question ""who is this person?""  What would be her role?  A lot of these genres do blend together.  Just look at the futuristic, dystopian, post apocalyptic genre which to me, looks like a mix of steampunk and cyberpunk.  Edit:  Don't understand why I'm getting downvoted here.  I thought it'd be nice to give some specific reasons and offer suggestions on making it better."

steampunk,38r2bn,Zorkamork,7,Sat Jun 6 04:41:36 2015 UTC,"You could try adding some kind of petticoat under the skirt to puff it up a bit. Some cream and black vertical striped leggings could help. Also, you could try and find some sort of utility belt."

steampunk,38r2bn,fzombie,2,Sat Jun 6 12:40:20 2015 UTC,A dagger and a double barrel derringer.  Maybe a small waist leather apron or mid size leather apron with tool pouch. Would be a convenient place to carry a large wrench or wire framed welding hammer and a screwdriver or multitool

steampunk,38r2bn,thesockbunny,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:30:51 2015 UTC,I definitely think a bolero or cover up of some kind on your shoulders would pull it all together and I like the other suggestion of a petticoat to fluff it up.

The pistol on your hips will also dray more attention to your form, which is accentuated by the corset.   One other idea I just had is to add a cape of some sort of you want to go more aristocratic in the look."
steampunk,38r2bn,bluegargoyle,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:42:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with the suggestion of a bolero, especially brown or reddish leather.  Definitely a raygun, or even s steampunk rifle to sling over your shoulder.  I made one that I need to add some stuff to (vacuum tubes, lights, etc) before I'll consider it finished.  A parasol would be cool too."
steampunk,38r2bn,asheneyed,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:05:44 2015 UTC,"I think it looks pretty good! Best way to finish up an outfit is an appropriate hairstyle and head piece, like a hat/fascinstor/goggles/bomber etc,  whatever fits your character. You have a good base down,  from here just pick up accessories you like as you go. I also might suggest a chemise under your corset, as an alternative for the jacket suggestion."

steampunk,38r2bn,Zandt88,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:53:52 2015 UTC,"A single leather shoulder guard that matches (not exactly but similar) the pattern of the bodice). Maybe something with a belt or strap that would come down across the center of the body and hook to a belt in the front and back.   It looks like something is missing on the bare shoulders and neck. A faux collar maybe, or possibly a wide lace band around the neck."

By the looks of your corset and skirt, I'd say the character profile that you're going for is ""Adventurer"", which I believe an utility belt would be choice.  If you are, in fact, going to be profiled as an adventurer, I'd suggest the shoulder guard that /user/Zandt88 suggested.  If you develop your alter ego's back story a bit more, you'll see that she will dress herself.  Sidenote: I truly do fancy that corset and cannot endure the time required to see it complete."

Some copper pipe contraption, metal, glowy stuff? Glass, even?

steampunk,38dd19,king_of_doma,6,Wed Jun 3 18:20:09 2015 UTC,I think they missed the proverbial airship on this one.  Pretty sure Captian Hook and Tinkerbell are not steampunk.  Looks like some people just took it to mean 'Halloween'.

steampunk,38dd19,Pindaroo,2,Wed Jun 3 18:57:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely missing gears!  In reality, yes, the garb could be argued to fit, but the allusion to the children's story is a bit off the mark.  Everyone brings their own flavor to it all though, so if they want to make that argument, so be it.  Important thing is that people had fun, regardless of whether they re-purposed their furry suit or not.  Looks like they did."
steampunk,38dd19,king_of_doma,2,Wed Jun 3 19:24:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely! Fun is first and foremost!!!  I've seen costumers whine and complain about spending hours on their outfits, as well as money.

Mad props to him for having a fun time with his wife and granddaughter!"

I mean if you're doing a steampunk version of an existing character, it could go in either, just as if you were cosplaying a character from media in the steampunk genre. Although I tend to think of Cosplay as a costuming genre only, whereas Steampunk is more inclusive, as you could also be mentioning films, fashion, music, devices, and such that'd fit the Steampunk classification/time period. At least in regards to the category. If it was just a photo of an attendee, I'd probably have put the link in the Cosplay Reddit."

Alternatively, you could go with a skirt like this and top it with a frilly blouse and riding jacket.

The reason I say ""let's hope it's good"" is because I hope it isn't going to be like what Fox is doing with the Fantastic Four.

steampunk,37kto9,masy3d,1 point,Thu May 28 10:43:13 2015 UTC,"Here's my 2c:   How much would you like to be able to customize your ships? Just different types of Gun Turrets, Armors or would like to keep upgrading them into more powerful ones during a game progression and make this a big feature in a game?   I like the few empty hulls with many customizations idea. It doesn't make sense that you can just keep upgrading the same weapon forever. 3 levels of upgrade per weapon then buy a new one perhaps? Also keep in mind that for me at least visual customization is huge! I want a red hull with black sails or coated in skull and crossbones.   Should ships have a crew members that operates those vessels? So for example if you take heavy damage and crew members die your repair speed goes down, or guns reloading takes longer.   It depends on the story line. If you are the general, admiral, what have you, commanding this fleet then having a few key can't be killed type characters might be a good idea for plot points but the ability to hire crew members with back story that can be leveled up and I become emotionally invested in would be awesome. It will affect the way people deploy their ships, how much risk they take and will make the game play much more interesting. Bonuses to these special crew for winning and negatives for losing or when a special crew member dies would also be neat.   How would you like the battles to look like? Fewer ships in far distance between with slow speed and longer gun reload times where you need to use more tactics and planning to win(slower peace) or more ""arcade"" like style battles where you are flying around enemies in circles and just Shoot all you got on them?   Both. There is a strategy to having hold back heavies and fast rollers engaging at the same time. It would make things more interesting to have to contend with both. That being said, if you have a heavy holding back firing into battle the issue of friendly fire should come up.   Last one is about in-game story? How much game should base/take from it? Is it important for you to have ""Hero"" Characters, some sort of story telling between missions? or just want to build airships and destroy enemies?   There has to be some story there and some characters to become invested in or I'll just forget about it before too long.  These are just my opinions, others may disagree. It sounds like an interesting project. Looking forward to seeing it go forward.  Edit: Formatting"

steampunk,37ff4v,officialimguraffe,6,Wed May 27 15:21:31 2015 UTC,"kindof yeah, it's hard to flesh out properly without going into a lengthy explanation.  but in short; Lolita is a clothing/dressing style in which you try to look either like a porcelain figurine, or an old doll from when dolls where still made of porcelain.  It is also worth mentioning that Lolita usually strives towards utopian ""sweet lolita"" or dystopian/darker themed ""gothic lolita""  and at last a little poster so that you have an idea what's'what.  http://hivemill.com/products/types-of-lolita-print  protip; DON'T EVER MIX THE STYLES UP! YOU CAN RUN, YOU CAN HIDE, BUT THEY WILL FIND YOU AND THEY WILL FORCE YOU TO WATCH YAOI!!! another protip; don't look that up it's anime gay porn  edit; no seriously; i have seen girls walk off half crying because some bloke didn't know the difference between gothic and punk lolita. not because of his ignorance, but because people spend much effort to create these dresses and she thought he knew his stuff...  edit 2; this came out very long. anyway, in my first edit i forgot to mention that there are few (or not many) people into lolita, and those few usually knows the difference. she just misunderstood his compliments.   edit 3; yes. also being a younger self is correct in some styles."

There is still demand because a human touch is still more agile than a human's code.  It isn't like people are pre-destined to be low-skilled workers (not that I think anyone thinks that, anymore). Automation can also make it easier to live independently for people who might fall into those tasks today and the many that did, previously. People both fall into those tasks and life is not made easier through automation for various reasons which we may not entirely disagree on.  Did the movie preclude that in some way? Were there renegade air conditioning specialists?"

Sadly, I'm not sure which is worse."

Now just cause it has that doesn't mean it is not steampunk. What I look for in steampunk is more steam work and the like. I would consider Firefly more Dieselpunk than steam. But this is just my opinion. I love Firefly and Steampunk, but I feel like it hardly scrapes the surface of steampunk and is more dieselpunk. I feel like you could do a lot more to make it steam."

steampunk,35c6qh,designbat,3,Sat May 9 01:29:13 2015 UTC,Awesome! Will do :)
steampunk,35c6qh,janm8114,5,Mon May 11 02:02:27 2015 UTC,I will be there giving out tea with my friend Jacob. :) We're also hoping to have an open picnic with a hotpot of tea and tons of cookies.
steampunk,35c6qh,designbat,2,Sat May 9 11:35:35 2015 UTC,Chammomille and Lavendar tea by any chance? It tastes lovely.
steampunk,35c6qh,IAmBabs,3,Sat May 9 11:39:42 2015 UTC,"So, the (paper sealed) bags of tea we'll have to distribute are hot cinnamon spice, Earl Grey, passion fruit and Irish breakfast. I'll also have little one inch pins with a tea theme to give out. My friend beth is bringing even more tea bags (!) from the Disney collection, so she may have those.  Since we're making tea in large batches for the picnic, we'll have peach tea and Organic Green w/Citrus & Ginkgo, from Harney and Sons (based in NY). We're hoping to do that in the Radisson courtyard before events really start Saturday am.  Do stop by and get our calling cards.  (We're just tea obsessed people, not promoters.)"
steampunk,35c6qh,desmondevers,3,Sat May 9 11:55:23 2015 UTC,Have you all heard of Wanderlust Tea? They're friendly and have amazing teas!
steampunk,35c6qh,IAmBabs,3,Sat May 9 12:30:36 2015 UTC,I had some of their tea last year and purchased some last year. oh and If I see you Babs I will will have lovely peppermint candies to give out.

steampunk,35c6qh,janm8114,2,Mon May 11 23:53:06 2015 UTC,"Plan on attending every day! This will be my first Steampunk event, and I am so excited.  Been trying to get to one for over four years, but was overseas for three and couldn't find one close by last year.  Got married this last August so new hubby is bringing me out for a birthday/honeymoon gift.  Bit of a drive, but worth it I'm sure. Any advice for a noobie?  And would love to meet someone who does pictures out there. And YES!  Going to definitely want to get some pics taken.  Who would you advise us about when to get the best shots?"
steampunk,35c6qh,IAmBabs,4,Sat May 9 11:08:07 2015 UTC,"Hello! As OP discovered, I am Babs Who Takes Pictures, the head of photography at SPWF. I will be hosting a panel on Dark Victorian photography, holding studio shots, and walking around taking free shoots. If you'd like to meet, you can inbox me or at the event ask for Babs.   There will be other photographers, Marissa M who normally specializes in family photography and Scott M. Photoplex who has a green screen, as well as Matt Norris, who is amazing at making wonderful effects in post. I believe there are other photographers, but this is who I know at the top of my head.   As for what to do, take a breath and enjoy yourself. There will be panels that you want to see that are back to back, so you'll miss some. That's fine, many of the performers have shows at different times. If they don't, you can leave on early and head to the other. Unless it's Wyck or Karnevil, no one will say anything arenything about it (they do for comedic purposes).  Speaking of Wyck and Karnevil, both are sideshow acts that involve pain. Want to cause some? Bring a few bills and staple them at the end of the event to show them how much you love (or hated) the show.   Like music? Once again we have French & the Punk, This Way to the Egress, Eli August, Steam Powered Giraffe, Platform One, and more! The event also brought back the very much missed Emperor Norton's Stationary Marching Band.    Azkadelia Victorius Madhattress the aerial dancer has several acts throughout the weekend and I think lessons. If she does, they were very well received at Wicked Faire (another event run by the same people).     If you want to participate in something, Professor Mark P. Donnelly will have an astounding 14 different panels throughout the weekend, some of which are bartitsu lessons. Bartitsu  (before you Google it) is akin to Victorian Era sword fighting...but with what Victorian Era people's had on hand - namely canes, umbrellas, parasols and their bare hands.  Into poetry? There are at least two events this year - the poetry slam and an into to steampunk poetry.    This is what I remember off the top of my head. You would have to visit the scheduling page for more. I do think I remember chocolate tasting, and I'm not sure if there is an absinthe tasting event this year.   Please try and remember the 5-3-1 Rule to stave of con crud, especially since partying is indeed a thing at SPWF).   The rule is ""5 hours of sleep, 3 meals, 1 shower every day.""  The event is mostly outside, but it will be hot, you will smell and a roll of deodorant won't cut it. If you need it, I usually have multivitamins in my room to helps keep people marginally nutritionally balanced."
steampunk,35c6qh,jenniferhaggerty,3,Sat May 9 12:29:05 2015 UTC,"Oh you are amazing!!!  This will be great!!! We are two old folks (both 62) who are young at heart and vivid with our imagination, so this sounds right up our alley!!! I hope I will be priveledged to meet, greet and thank you. OH! Fair warning, Hubby LOVES photography and he will probably want to pick your brain on your photo techniques. :-P  LOL"
steampunk,35c6qh,IAmBabs,2,Sat May 9 12:49:43 2015 UTC,"That's what my photo panel, Camera Obscura, is all about! But if he catches me in a studio session, I chat a lot while taking pictures with anyone nearby.   Ninja Edit: Here's the schedule"

steampunk,355a7l,CPU_Pi,2,Thu May 7 14:05:58 2015 UTC,I've seen a few of these done really well.
steampunk,355a7l,OverratedPineapple,8,Thu May 7 16:48:38 2015 UTC,"steam punk is an interesting aesthetic as there is alot of focus on form over function.  I've seen lots of functional pieces such as keyboards from datamancer (RIP).    For outfits though I haven't seen much.  I've seen a couple exo-skeletons that are geared appropriately, but they were mostly just cogs that were interlocked, they didn't actually ""do"" anything."
steampunk,355a7l,Halcyonforever,3,Thu May 7 13:56:00 2015 UTC,"Since a lot of steampunk is heavily influenced by the Victorian era - the idea of the aesthetic dictating the fashion choices seems well justified. I know people seem to be battling this out but with influences of a period where things were very specifically worn for the look of the thing and functionality be damned - I am happy to see people simple playing with the look of mechanical things purely for their aesthetics. Has to be room for both, no?"
steampunk,355a7l,foxes722,2,Thu May 7 17:19:57 2015 UTC,oh absolutely.    One of mine is a monocle that has a diffused red light to it.  Cool looking but actually blinds me in that eye.

I don't usually put gears on my guns, but when I do they will mesh and they will do something. When you are holding the gun you use your thumb to move the lever on the back. The gears turn and the hand will move to indicate the different settings."

steampunk,34tn96,LandgraveCustoms,3,Mon May 4 13:46:34 2015 UTC,"The idea behind this piece is that Art Deco as a movement was introduced closer to the end of the Victorian era than to the beginning of WWI, so you end up with Steampunk metals and tech, but Dieselpunk forms and coloration... so if the piece looks a little confused, well, it's kinda supposed to be.  First time doing this style of more realistic copper and stencil lettering. Lots and lots of masking involved. A ton of drybrushing (and not-so-dry-brushing to simulate the ash and powder leaks behind the shell). Not to mention two different finishes (matte and gloss) and more detail work than I care to remember, including blacking out every thin little line on the shell with a 1-bristle brush.  So... worth the work?"

steampunk,34l2hf,grievousguy2,4,Sat May 2 02:28:27 2015 UTC,"Steampunk often combines the appeal of the gritty, greasy world of mechanical/electrical contraptions with the appeal of the chic into one fantasy world. A lot of times paired with the Victorian era's cultural aspects, often the Aristocracy.  Much of it for me is about the mechanical side of technology in its purest form - a different, more approachable avenue of technology. It's probable, if you ask me, that it is more appealing to some than fairies, wizards and magicians, but still offers that same type of wonder with a more raw, technical undertone.  Perhaps it occupies a space between fantasy and reality that is more comfortable than the usual fantasy style, taking a bit from both.  It also certainly attracts people looking for a creative avenue, from gluing a cogwheel on a hat or belt, to fancy Victorian style outfits and more fantasy-oriented airship captains and all sorts of Tesla coils and related technologies worked into weaponry and consumer tech."
steampunk,34l2hf,Aquinas26,2,Sat May 2 21:28:26 2015 UTC,Yeah.  We noted that there is a very pleasing level of visual rhythm with just enough variance to keep it interesting (what with the cogs and pipes being there).  Possibly a dissatisfaction with today's values and a certain longing for some of the better ideals of the 19th century.  Something familiar yet foreign from what we experience in daily life.  The idea of archaic or boring tech being used in extremely extraordinary ways.  Some of the artwork is incredibly thought out; almost like you could actually build it from the image.

The story is that when he died, his last breath was captured in a test tube and then sealed in paraffin wax. A family member gifted this to Henry Ford, who was a friend of Edison's.  I've seen some anecdotal stories about other notable people in Edwardian/Victorian times doing this as well (in libraries, many moons ago) but I'm coming up empty on the ol' innertubes for more correlating stories.  Either way, I like /u/josh61980 's idea here. Some sort of facial apparatus, or just the properties of the interaction of a soul with Aether and a test tube to get the job done."
steampunk,34i6ym,fatalifeaten,2,Fri May 1 17:52:17 2015 UTC,"Alrighty, lemme give it a shot.  I like Aether as the ""semi-mystical"" element of steampunk.  It has classical roots w/ the Greeks, as the sum of all Elements, and there was a time when folks thought that everything in space was aether.  So you could have some mystical mumbo-jumbo that souls are really just the aether inhabiting and animating people, and at the moment of death, the soul is released and dissipated back into the aether, like water poured back into the ocean.  So you have a big ol' mystical Frankenstein-ish machine that runs on trapped lightning and can capture a soul to either be bottled, or have that soul somehow ""imprinted"" in a clockwork mind.  It could also harvest the raw aether and use that as power, somehow, but only by capturing the soul from a body right when it dies (or is killed, of course) can you have useful, 'organized' aether that retains any semblance of intelligence."

steampunk,33zozz,pirategaspard,2,Mon Apr 27 15:34:18 2015 UTC,Maybe low pressure is ok?  Could it be engineered so that you could pedal to compress the air? Then you could alternate between air-powered and pedal powered!  I can't imagine that would work for high pressure?

steampunk,33updp,RAndrewOhge,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:24:35 2015 UTC,"The Loco Steam-Powered Black Pearl Motorcycle From Revatu Customs  By Spiros Tsantilas - Apr 23, 2015  The Black Pearl was unveiled at the Bigtwin Bike Show in Rosmalen, Holland, next to a poster of Captain Jack Sparrow.   But unlike the legendary sea vessel of the silver screen, this Black Pearl is a land vehicle powered by a steam engine.   Constructed by Dutch company Revatu Customs, the two-wheeled locomotive is a fully functioning motorcycle, albeit a slow one.  The red wheels on the Black Pearl are a nice touch.   If the target was to look like a train with the Black Pearl, it worked.  This saddle on the Black Pearl may be a bit uncomfortable for prolonged use.  Set your fire, wait to build pressure and you're good to go.  Although custom specialist Rene van Tuil, owner of Revatu, makes no effort to hide what inspired the name of his latest creation, it is a 2011 design by Colby Higgins that is likely to have sparked his creative flame.   Named the Train Wreck Bike, industrial designer Higgins’ 3D rendering came about as he was exploring his “fascination with old fashion mechanics” and drew considerable publicity.  Staying faithful to the Train Wreck’s design, van Tuil built a motorcycle whose locomotive inspiration is obvious from every angle.   The final transmission, an exposed crankshaft rotating the rear wheel by means of an eccentric pivot, mimics a steam train’s engine both mechanically and visually.  Adding a bell and a steam horn doesn't steer the mind away from trains either.   A setup more familiar to the typical motorcyclist can be found at the front, where two shock absorbers connect the steering to the wheel through a trailing link structure, housing a drum brake assigned with the task of stopping the beast.  More importantly, the Black Pearl is a motorcycle one can actually ride.   There is no official technical description, no mention of horsepower, torque or weight figures. In fact the only thing we do know is its top speed: 5 mph (8 km/h).   Barely enough to outpace a pedestrian, it probably won’t set the asphalt on fire (considering the irony of riding a burning boiler a few inches off the ground).   What it certainly will do is ride unlike any other motorcycle.  Talking about touring on it may be a bit premature though, at least until we find out how much coal and water it can store.   Shorter distances are definitely more feasible, as Rene van Tuil proves with the following video of him (briefly) riding the Pearl.  https://youtu.be/GQN0lZedqvA"

steampunk,33rka7,the10dude,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:04:47 2015 UTC,"The link states ""Clear Hard Back Panel + Flexible Edge = Combination of TPU and Polycarbonate for dual protection"". I presume that the edges are TPU and the back is Polycarbonate.  Polycarbonate is what CDs are made of, so if you have some junk CDs around, you can experiment on those first.    Ammonia and Acetone will dissolve it, so you might try using one of them as a solvent to glue the pieces in place. I don't know if they evaporate entirely, or if they leach into the PC and permanently weaken it, so that's a concern. I know Acetone will leach into Acrylic and permanently weaken it resulting in tiny cracks that appear over time. You could try using a torch to heat the gears so they sink into the surface or underside. The melting point for Polycarbonate is 155 °C (311 °F), so a propane torch would be more than enough for the job. You might also try heating them in the oven. I don't know if the heat will cause stress cracks as it cools, so that might be a concern.    This link might be helpful. http://www.aandt-industry.com/ompanyews/61-75.html  Good luck with the project. Be sure to share if you try it out. I'd be curious how it went regardless of the results."

steampunk,33lvbt,ProfThadBach,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:02:13 2015 UTC,"If you look closely, there are foot pads above the exhaust. The handlebars are within reach as well."
steampunk,33lvbt,ProfThadBach,2,Thu Apr 23 19:11:59 2015 UTC,Whatever you say. The dude that rides that has to be about 9 feet tall to reach the foot rest and the handlebars. Which brings me to how does he steer it when there are arms attached to the body of the bike that are at a different angle to the steering column? And why six exhaust in the front when you have put the  drive train behind the seat? What are those exhaust for? I don't see a mechanism that needs to be vented in what looks like the instrument area of the bike? I know I am taking all the fun out of this for you but I am all about design and functionality. I would find it much cooler if form followed function.
steampunk,33lvbt,ProfThadBach,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:34:10 2015 UTC,"Creating a world where there are steam powered robots with gear driven minds, I was prepared to have to do some explaining.  The front housing does contain a secondary smaller engine which will work the bifurcation of the front fork. Hence the front exhaust. The majority of the exhaust will be expelled from the rear exhaust pipes of course.  As for steering, the attached arms can swivel, you can see the point of swivel about halfway up the arms.  Again, neither myself nor my artist is an engineer. So hopefully readers out there will forgive us if we haven't designed something 100% feasible. Then again, is that not the fun of comic books, creating things that might not exist in the real world?"
steampunk,33lvbt,nicholastheposh,2,Fri Apr 24 00:01:27 2015 UTC,I did study engineering and I build and ride motorcycles. I am not saying it can't be fantastical. I just look at things from a design perspective.

The dress code for my high school prom was:   All tops, (shirts, blouses, dresses, P.E. attire), must have sleeves that cover the shoulders and underarms. Wide straps do not constitute sleeves.  The length of dresses, skirts, and shorts must be closer to the knee than the bend of the leg at inseam. Front, back, or side slits in skirts may not extend beyond mid-thigh.  Clothing which exhibits cleavage (front or rear) is inappropriate for school functions.  Formals, backless dresses and/or tops may not extend beyond the bottom of the shoulder blades.  Girls’ dresses and tops  must have a 2″ minimum strap on each shoulder.  Shawls, boleros and other shrugs are acceptable if worn over the dress at all times.  Cleavage covered.   OP's dress is beautiful and I'm actually really jealous that I couldn't have worn such a thing six years ago in high school. :P"

steampunk,32lwae,ImaginaryLivingBody,2,Tue Apr 14 21:00:28 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I've got a few props that dispense liquid.  Unless you want your pump to be powered by something (like a battery-powered fish tank pump) you basically have two methods of getting the liquid from point a to point b.   My first prop used a meat syringe to make a vacuum to pull the liquid out of the main chamber into the syringe, and out. I had two one-way ball valves on either side, so pushing the liquid shut the valve it came from. You'll also need a one-way valve on your main tank, so the lack of air doesn't create a stronger vacuum than the pump. (Air in, but liquid doesn't leak out.)  The second way is something I'm attempting now. Your main chamber needs to be air tight, though. I'm using a portable bike pump to disperse the liquid with air pressure, pushing the liquid out. This method is a little less precise than the other, but seems like an easier build so far.  My biggest advice is create ALL internals from plastic. This includes your bottles! My first liquid prop was made with brass, steel, and glass and while it looks beautiful, I can't wear it more than an hour at a time. (Seriously. Feels like a overgrown toddler is hanging off of me.)   Remember to buy extra poly tubing, and make double sure whatever valves you buy fit your tubing perfectly. Double glue and wrap all your connections. There's nothing worse than leaking all over your costume, hours before you can change!  Good luck, and post the results!!"

steampunk,3289jb,HerpofDerpwood,3,Sat Apr 11 13:45:24 2015 UTC,"The technology in a steampunk reality works because something in the invented setting is different from our actual 19th Century. What that difference is will determine how and why the advanced technology functions. Examples:   Difference: Charles Babbage's difference engine and computational engine were successfully built and widely adopted. Tech theory: The information age arrived as early as 1822, so advantages that the computer brought to engineering--rapidly iterated design optimization, simulated material stress testing, miniaturization of precision devices, etc., not to mention massive-scale industrial accounting--could be leveraged a century ahead of schedule. Results: Super-sophisticated clockworks, highly-efficient mechanical energy transmissions, ubiquitous industrial and scientific computers, stronger/lighter/smaller moving parts in everything.   Or,   Difference: A MacGuffin from Victorian science fiction literature is exploited on an industrial scale. Tech theory: Verne, Wells, and others imagined substances and devices that, if they'd really existed, would have utterly disrupted the development of most industry. Cavorite is the obvious example, but there are also Jekyll's and Griffin's formulas, all that military hardware the Martians left when they keeled over, and weirder questions like ""what if Dr. Moreau got hold of specimens from the Lost World?"" Results: HIGHLY improbably weight-to-power ratios in everything, armies of invisible super-spies equally capable of infiltrating foreign capitals or policing domestic thought crime, giant mushroom farms to feed the poor, force field domes over underwater cities, chimerical medicine.   Or,   Difference: The laws of physics themselves are somehow different from the world we know. Tech theory: Technology based on the luminiferous aether or angellic sorcery has essentially whatever tolerances and limitations you, the author, decide it does. You're now writing straight fantasy, so remember discipline, restraint, and internal consistency when developing your magic system. Results: Sentient clock-golems. Mathematically-constructed gateways through time and space. Vampire-slaying swordcanes made of exotic alloys that leech away the undead's stolen vital galvanism. Cities powered and lit by vials of the Blood of The God That Sleeps.   And so on."

steampunk,3289jb,Tralan,3,Sat Apr 11 20:39:57 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean by steampunk is an aesthetic but in order for it to be believable, particularly in works of fiction there has to be some sort of theory behind it to explain it, even simple explanations rather than just ""it uses steam/cogs"" even if it's just one person's interpretation i'm sure there has to be some explanation for the workings of steampunk technology."

Because steampunk is partially inspired by the Victorian era (This really depends on who you talk to too..) A quick google for Victorian patents, or odd Victorian inventions might bring you a bit of inspiration. Be warned- a lot of these patents and inventions actually didn't work, or were never made.   If you're talking about ACTUAL steampunk workings, like how steampunk ships would actually function- it really depends on the person. The steampunk world that my friends and I created is somewhat based in science, so a lot of our ""airships"" are actually dirigibles.  Other people have ships and machines that run on mysterious forces like the aether, or souped up steam engines. (While might make sense on paper, would be physically impossible.)

I focus mostly on cosplay and make steampunk outfits when I feel like it.   I've sold jewellery in the past, but am not selling any right now. If you really like something here feel free to show the picture to someone else who could make it for you, I can link you to where I got jewellery parts and stuff if you want, but I'm afraid I can't really make more myself (too busy atm to make jewellery, and I can't really make clothing to measure)."

steampunk,31nsn9,DBerwick,-2,Tue Apr 7 12:53:03 2015 UTC,"It looks nice, but the bracelets give a very strong vibe of 'unnecessary gears = steampunk'"
steampunk,31nsn9,executioncommentary,17,Tue Apr 7 12:53:05 2015 UTC,"Of course the bracelet gears are unnecessary, they're part of jewellery, jewellery itself is unnecessary. Jewellery is for decoration, and Victorians, like most other societies and cultures, would take inspiration from their world and things prominent in their society to base their jewellery off of. Victorians would make floral jewellery, but wouldn't wear actual, growing flowers round their necks. They'd wear pendants with engraven portraits because that's what was important to them. In a steampunk world clockwork would have been pretty important, and plenty of people like the whole clockwork aesthetic, so I don't see why using non-functional gears in jewellery is seen as being so un-steampunk.  Sorry for the wall of text, I've just never understood that argument being used against gears in jewellery, especially when the Victorians were so into their decoration."

steampunk,31h9tp,jelli2015,4,Sun Apr 5 01:47:50 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm pretty new to the world, myself, so I'm sure someone with more experience will have better answers for you, but I'm currently in the thick of my first steampunk project I'm planning on wearing to the Wizard World Comic Con in my area, so I'll share some things I've learned as I muddle through.     Come up with your image. Do you want to be a scientist, an aviator, a gentleman/woman, a mechanic? Deciding your overall look will help you figure out the details.  Google as much as you can until you find something you like that you think, ""Yeah, I could make something look like that."" Google steampunk hats, steampunk goggles, steampunk vests, anything you want to include.  Look for tutorials. I've been using Lost Wax's youtube tutorials and patterns. His patterns are cheap - I think it was ~$5 for the top hat and $3 for the goggles. Better yet, his main materials are craft foam and a cheap yoga mat. Both inexpensive and fairly easy to work with.  Instead of trying to create things from scratch, find existing things that you can steampunkify. Rub 'n Buff has been my best friend. I bought a whole set so I have a variety of shades to work with and a little bit goes a long way. I'm doing a mechanic, so I took a set of tools I already owned and smeared them with Antique Gold and wrapped their handles in faux leather.  Dollar stores and thrift stores are your friends. I bought my gloves and a couple of belts from a dollar store and found a collared shirt and a shirt that I butchered/altered with Liquid Stitch glue into a vest from Goodwill, along with a bunch of belts and purses for various leather scraps.     Things are constantly going wrong that I have to keep redoing and I'm a little terrified to debut it, but I've wanted to do this for a long time. Good luck if you decided to try!"
steampunk,31h9tp,daemonfamiliar,3,Sun Apr 5 02:32:11 2015 UTC,"The thing i love about the steampunk community is that largely all types of people come to the faires.  While coming in costume is encouraged, you and your dad can wear whatever and be fine.  But if you wanna be a bit more in character a pair of khakis, wifebeater, suspendors if you have them, boots and a bowler (which you can find a cheap one usually at like a party city) works well.  just dirty up the whole ensemble, maybe make a pair of goggles and youre set.  we al start some where...do you mind if i ask which faire?"
steampunk,31h9tp,callmenoodles,2,Sun Apr 5 04:44:17 2015 UTC,It will be the Emerald City Expo in Kansas. It won't be for a little while but I was curious and would forget to ask here later on.
steampunk,31h9tp,oograh,3,Sun Apr 5 05:43:41 2015 UTC,"Ahh. I have worked at that expo the past 2 years.  You are definitely welcome to come without any steampunk garb! It is not uncommon at all for people to come in without anything steampunk. Come and talk to anyone there about steampunk, and just about any of us will be delighted to help, or just talk about it!"
steampunk,31h9tp,aria51,1 point,Sun Apr 5 13:39:28 2015 UTC,That is a fantastic expo! I saw lots of people in street clothes last year.

We drove 6 hours to get there, and I know of folks who drive 7 or 8. It's not as big as teslacon but not too shabby for the Midwest.  An up and coming festival I must plug is Big River Steampunk Festival in Hannibal MO. Last year was the first year, and from the website this year looks to be growing like crazy."
steampunk,31h9tp,everettforge,3,Sun Apr 5 22:41:12 2015 UTC,"Thrift/charity shops are where a good chunk of people throw together their costumes except the super talented or hard-core.  I just threw stuff together from the mall and salvation army due to lack of sewing abilities,  and happen to work in a mall so I had a lot of time to hunt for pieces. My ""crew""  also have utilized thrift stores for their outfits -  and being male it was considerably easier for them. You don't need to dress like a dandy! Regardless of gender you can blend in easily wearing an Oxford shirt and vest over some slim black/brown pants and boots of some sort.  Check out some Pintrest outfits and Tumblr pics for ideas! I spent too many hours on both of those sites for inspiration and ideas of what to throw together before going to my first time at the Steampunk World's Fair. Also look for pics of the con itself to see what kinds of stuff people wore last year! My friends and I are a pirate crew of sorts and we have influences from Dickens, the Civil War,  Pirates of the Caribbean and Japan. Heck,  even the Old West counts for clothing influence!"
steampunk,31h9tp,lemursteamer,2,Sun Apr 5 02:34:18 2015 UTC,"It's pretty common to have people at cons or expos that aren't dressed up. A lot of people appreciate the aesthetic and just enjoy looking at what others wear and create. If you are worried about sticking out though, you could start with something simple, dress pants, a dress shirt, and a top hat.   I don't know of a lot of people that hit their first con with a fully decked out costume. Most people I know started with the bare basics like dress clothes and a top hat. As they went along, saw what others were doing, grew more confident in their DIY abilities, they started to add a trinket here, a weapon here, a new piece of clothing there.  There are some truly amazing and inspiring costumes out there nowadays. Don't let that intimidate you. They started exactly where you are now...some of them probably didn't have an artistic bone in their body, I know I didn't!   Hope you have fun!"
steampunk,31h9tp,SkyPork,2,Sun Apr 5 08:16:43 2015 UTC,"I have been to many steampunk events and there are always people that attend in plain clothes.  I would say that while you may stick out, you will not be treated much differently.    People may come up to you in character and ask if you are from the future, but it is always playful and not ment to offend.  My wife and I have a saying, ""steampunk will last because we are the most polite.""  manners and politeness are the hallmarks of what steampunk is about.  If you do not mock, you will not be mocked.  anything less would but unseemly in our community.  Best adventures and good evenings to you and your father.  report back any escapades."

I'm not sure if the event near you excludes people from the modern era or not. ;-)  As far as the level of your costume, don't worry. It's an ongoing process. You'll always be getting new ideas."
steampunk,31h9tp,nemaihne,1 point,Sun Apr 5 21:06:43 2015 UTC,"The first two steampunk conventions I went to I was in regular clothes. I built up my costumes very slowly. As far as abilities, you never know until you try. I applied my experience of painting model cars in my youth to custom painting toy guns and making them look steampunked. Just bought some appropriate colours and went to town. Start small, start simple. I found once I didn't need to feel intimidated by people who had welded and crafted metal exoskeleton arms with functioning gears that I had just as much fun as a total noob. I even found some artisans and retailers at conventions would be very helpful if you tell them you are new to the scene and just starting out on your costume and props. I didn't go to a convention in full costume until my third time and even then I had to make do as I forgot two pieces of it."

steampunk,30slul,RufusBillesdon,4,Mon Mar 30 10:47:08 2015 UTC,"Steampunk refers to a subgenre of science fiction and sometimes fantasy—also in recent years a fashion and lifestyle movement—that incorporates technology and aesthetic designs inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery.   Steampunk is very simple: It is a retro-future alternate past based on Victorian styling.  It can be a lifestyle, a fashion, a fancy dress, a theme for a fictional work.  You can wear it all day everyday. Or on special occasions. Or simply write stories about mad men with steam wings fighting between airships. Or draw art of women in corsets and gowns going to work on a steam powered calculation engine. Or even just talk about it with friends.  Overall, you're looking at leather, brass, extreme engineering of Victorian technology, and often themes of exploration, daring or discovery."

steampunk,30slul,Ontopourmama,3,Mon Mar 30 16:03:44 2015 UTC,"Okay, you raise a good question.  I might ramble a bit in an attempt to answer. For me Steampunk is a bridge that helps connect me with both my real life heritage, English, as well as my faith, Mormonism, a Victorian religion. It is the embracing of the best of the ideals and values of the Victorian Age, adventure, exploration, invention, and wonder, as well as some of what I consider to be more ""civilized"" social rules. It is also a chance to explore a different  person for yourself that you may not get to in real life. I fix computers and work with difficult people 40 plus hours a week, but at the end of the day I get to put my bowler on, check my pocket watch and ride off into something cooler. The only thing you have to do to fit in is be you, with a touch of class and a sense of adventure, and maybe a monocle. Sorry if that answer is not helpful, always happy to talk more on the subject."

You can be formal about it or informal.  Google it and you will find tons of information.  I like the history aspect.  One of my ancestors was a door to door medicine salesman.  I have been taken under his wing so to speak.  I am a pirate doctor.  I carry blades, guns and vials of elixir.  I could hurt you in a duel but would immediately feel the need to patch you up.  In real life I am a sailor who happens to be a Health Informatics IT guy.  I am not saying your persona has to be so close to real life.  Have fun with it.  Try out different things and see what feels right to you."
steampunk,30slul,Sir_Korupt,2,Mon Mar 30 15:46:04 2015 UTC,"How I usually describe Steampunk is ""Science fiction set in the late 19th century."" More accurately, it is a certain aesthetic that can be expressed in any way you like. There are SP books, Music, Games, it's a fashion style and inspiration for role playing games. It is a surprisingly varied field and people come through all kinds of different ways to Steampunk. Some people are interested in history and like thinking about the ""What if-scenarios"" that steampunk poses. Other people just like the aspect of tinkering and building their own contraptions.    I don't think there is anything specific you have to do to ""fit in."" So far all the Steampunks I know have been really kind to new people,  no matter what. Maybe dive into the history and the basics of many Steampunk universes (Nikola Tesla, Charles Babbage, the Steam engine), read some classical books like Jules Verne. If you like making things, you could try and build your own steampunk goggles, or a strange clock! Just go and see what tickles your curiosity!"
steampunk,30slul,DrPantaleon,2,Mon Mar 30 12:44:31 2015 UTC,"To address Q2 (Q1 being more than adequately discussed, I believe):  Be open about your interest.  Walking up to someone and telling them how great XXXX looks, or how curious you are about how an item is put together, is the best way to meet people.  Steampunk tends to be very ""gear-focused"", and people put a lot of effort into their costumes.  Asking and appreciating is a great way to fit in."
steampunk,30slul,Azarul,2,Mon Mar 30 16:41:42 2015 UTC,I did a podcast episode on what steampunk is and where it came from. It's only five minutes long; give it a listen if you've got the time.
steampunk,30slul,MichaelCoorlim,2,Mon Mar 30 17:20:01 2015 UTC,"Steampunk isn't just one thing, it's a web of interrelated things.  The term was coined by author K.W. Jeter as a riff on ""cyberpunk"", as a tongue-in-cheek way to refer to the alternate-history science fiction he and a couple of other authors were writing.  So first and foremost, it refers to that subgenre of science fiction written by modern authors, usually set in Victorian England or the American Old West (or occasionally in other locations during that time period), where modern or futuristic concepts are realized through the technology of the 19th century. (But it can also be set in post-apocalyptic futures where humanity has returned to steam power as its primary motive force, or on other planets with an equivalent level of technology). Or movies of a similar ilk.  But the term can also refer to the fandom subculture which grew up around the literary tradition (those of us who enjoy dressing up in period or period-inspired clothing at conventions or specifically steampunk events, and who presumably enjoy reading/watching steampunk); or to the art, music, costuming, or mechanical devices created by that subculture (there's a substantial crossover between steampunk and Maker cultures).  And outside of all that, there's stuff called ""steampunk"" by people who've never encountered the literature or subculture, who've seen steampunk creations and attempt to mimic their outward forms without understanding where steampunk came from (which I like to refer to as ""cargo cult steampunk""). See, for example, Just Steampunk Magazine, which takes great pains to stay away from any mention of science fiction in its ""What Is Steampunk?"" pages, lest it scare away any potential readers who just want to hot-glue broken clock parts onto porcelain birds.  You can be as casual or fervent about steampunk as you feel comfortable with. I generally only wear steampunk costumes at cons or when making a steampunk video, but I know people who dress up every day."

I feel the music side helps flesh it out since not only you have your imagination in the text and imagery to do with as you may, but you get to hear the sounds the artists came up with to fit the timeline they hear in their heads for steampunk."

steampunk,30slul,DNAhuman1,1 point,Tue Mar 31 02:29:39 2015 UTC,"Steampunk is a creative movement in literature, visual arts, music, fashion, etc. that remixes the tropes of Victorian science fiction and proposes alternate histories of the 19th Century Western Industrial Revolution (and, sometimes, adjacent periods & settings). There are original steampunk creations like the books and art, things that get adopted into the genre like most of the ""steampunk"" music and movies pre-2010 (or so),  and things that get ""steampunked"", like computer case mods, motorcycles made to look like a Jules Verne contraption, etc. Generally, for something to belong in the steampunk category, it needs to refer in some way to the Long 19th Century and invoke the twin themes of anachronism, or ""stuff encountered out of its proper time"", and retrofuturism, or ""the future as imagined by the past"".  The short version is, Victorian science fiction re-imagined by contemporary minds across myriad media, mostly for fun, sometimes as a thought experiment about different technological and social possibilities."
steampunk,30slul,pdxsteampunkff,1 point,Thu Apr 2 11:40:02 2015 UTC,"Long nineteenth century:       The long 19th century, defined by Eric Hobsbawm, a British Marxist historian and author, refers to the period between the years 1789 and 1914. Hobsbawm lays out his analysis in The Age of Revolution: Europe, 1789–1848; The Age of Capital: 1848–1875; and, The Age of Empire: 1875–1914. The concept is influenced by Fernand Braudel's idea of the ""long 16th century"" (c. 1450–1640).  According to Hobsbawn, the long 19th century begins with the French Revolution that established a republic in Europe and ends with the start of World War I, upon the conclusion of which in 1918 the long-enduring European power balance of the 19th century proper (1801–1900) was eliminated.  A more generalized version of the long 19th century, lasting from 1750 to 1914, is often used notably by textbook author and Professor of History at George Mason University, Peter N. Stearns.

For me, I think it certainly helps a great deal to have a wide knowledge of previous steam punk works and I myself tend to think of things like Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky and the Bioshock series for example as pinnacles of the steam punk aesthetic. But because steam-punk is a kind of genre of amalgamation, mixing the steam-industrial era and traditional sci-fi/fantasy, I don't tend to focus on these works on any other in particular. Knowledge of European history between 1800-1900 seems pretty essential though.   Aside from that, my own means of inspiration remains the same as when I write fiction of any other kind."
steampunk,306tcj,phalanxednoise,2,Thu Mar 26 04:07:05 2015 UTC,"That makes sense... It's got to help to have knowledge of both the genre and the history involved on hand, and I can see why you wouldn't want to get tied down by following a particular work. Thanks for the response!"

Then once it's cut, I'll add pipes, vials, gears, lights, pistons, etc... In places that make sense and feel organic to the flow of the piece as I bring the build together."

steampunk,306tcj,pdxsteampunkff,2,Fri Mar 27 22:28:52 2015 UTC,"Writer and builder here!  When I build, I try to think of what HASN'T been done yet. Which is difficult. Or I think about how I can take something that is done a lot and add a little extra flair. For instance, when my dad and I built his mechanical arm, we were thinking about different weaponry to add to it. The gatling gun has been done so often, we really wanted to try for something else. So we ended up attaching a mini cannon (check out my profile to see pics.) That little addition really sets his arm apart from others and really grabs people's attentions at cons.  As for writing, I draw from my love of futuristic science fiction. I'll look at something, like say rocket boots for example...and then I'll try to figure out what would rocket boots look like in the 1800's. Where would the steam come from? How long would they sustain flight? Stuff like that. I'm working on a Steampunk Western graphic novel (yes, I know, shameless plug) and I did a lot of that type of thinking.

It is only fairly recently that we've broken things out into clockwork-punk, diesel-punk, Deco-punk, etc. The type of attitude you're displaying is reminiscent of a basement-dwelling, socially retarded neckbeard arguing that Edwardian style has no place in steampunk because it occurs outside the reign of Victoria. I agree that some of the things in this drawing are perhaps outside of a strict definition of steampunk, but at least a quarter of it bears directly on a large swath of the periods that some steampunk draws from. Ease up."

It's a steampunk sub. I don't think it's out of line to expect steampunk content. Nor does it mean I've:    wrongly appointed themselves arbiters of what is or is not acceptable in a sub-reddit."

steampunk,2zlxhb,TrishyKitty,2,Thu Mar 19 18:03:35 2015 UTC,One of my first thoughts was actually that this would make a really cool framed print :) I like looking at doo-dads too!
steampunk,2zlxhb,foxes722,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:14:49 2015 UTC,Good idea! That would make nice art for my craft room :)

steampunk,2ze8o0,TrishyKitty,4,Tue Mar 17 21:15:05 2015 UTC,Absolutely beautiful. You should set up an online store.
steampunk,2ze8o0,for_reasons,4,Wed Mar 18 00:30:23 2015 UTC,Thank you so much :) I have an Instagram but I haven't been as active lately due to family things. My handle is @TrinketEmporium . I hope you like my other things!
steampunk,2ze8o0,Alycion,3,Wed Mar 18 00:58:38 2015 UTC,Looks amazing!
steampunk,2ze8o0,alias-of-a-girl,2,Wed Mar 18 01:44:18 2015 UTC,I want to buy one. Have you considered Etsy at all?
steampunk,2ze8o0,Iamdickburns,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:44:24 2015 UTC,I have a shop but I'm not active on it as a seller. I've only really used it for custom orders. I guess I should consider getting back into it!
steampunk,2ze8o0,chalkchick0,2,Wed Mar 18 05:55:41 2015 UTC,I would love to see some more of your work. Where do you get antique watches and how much do you generally pay for them if you don't mind.
steampunk,2ze8o0,chalkchick0,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:33:11 2015 UTC,"If I can find them at antique stores I snag them there. I can't generally pay more than $20 for a piece so I try to keep all pieces I buy under that. I fail miserably because I'm a collector but I try to keep that number in mind. For pocket watches I'll spend up to $150 on a piece. I consider the age, condition and parts when making the big ticket purchases. As far as selling what I make, it depends on each piece. Some pieces have lots of old expensive parts that are very difficult to replace, I have to consider that along with how long I spent on it. That necklace isn't complete yet and hasn't been for months. I started this almost a year ago exactly and I've yet to feel it's finished. I think the chain is what it needs to set it off still."
