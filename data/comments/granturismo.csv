granturismo,3e4p6c,binky_the_doormat,2,Wed Jul 22 08:10:10 2015 UTC,"I'll second this tune. I can win this race quite easily now with this.   Mind you, I think it's as much about finding a rhythm than it is the vehicle, especially in the section between the two karassels. That's where you're going to be chasing your fastest competitors, so mistakes here are more critical than anywhere else on the track.  The problem is that all your restarts are going to happen long before this point, so you'll get far less practice on this section."

I set the tranny to top out around 240 MPH, didn't use 1st or 2nd gear, and shifted around 6K RPM to ride the torque. I used the DS3, made only a couple minor mistakes, and I passed the lead car (Toyota 7) on the straight at the end. I ended up running a 6:05.  When passing the cars, I found that you either have to bump them slightly out of the way because the track is so narrow or follow them until they make a mistake because it seems like each car will make mistakes at some point. I was only able to cleanly pass a few cars."

granturismo,3dzqss,cbabbx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:30:52 2015 UTC,The trick is to install the game BEFORE any updates are applied. Disconnect from the internet and run the game out of the box. Then apply all the updates. You're much less likely to get any errors.

After they are downloaded and 'installed' by the PS3, GT6 then wants to unpack them on launch. If there is too much in one go, the game can't unpack them and it just gives up. The only solution is to delete the lot and do it in smaller batches."

granturismo,3e1ba5,codmw3master,6,Tue Jul 21 06:04:58 2015 UTC,"If you do have a clutch pedal, you need to disengage the clutch 100% before you can shift. Makes it very difficult :/"
granturismo,3e1ba5,22quack,2,Tue Jul 21 07:31:35 2015 UTC,A clutch is a very tactile pedal. Even if I had one I don't think I'd use it
granturismo,3e1ba5,My_usrname_of_choice,2,Tue Jul 21 08:05:20 2015 UTC,"I'm totally with you on that. Also even the brake is shitty on all setups, you get nothing from it. Even if it has some resistance, it's passive - until we get a hydraulic brake with force feedback linked to code in the game it'll always be 'wrong'. What I'd love to see (feel) is a brake that modulates when you skid so you can tell when your wheels are locking up, this would be awesome.  This may already exist? If it does it's beyond my meager budget."
granturismo,3e1ba5,3rdone,2,Tue Jul 21 12:48:39 2015 UTC,There's no FFB in any set of pedals but there are load cell brakes out there already that make a huge difference in feel.
granturismo,3e1ba5,kilogttam,2,Tue Jul 21 18:33:41 2015 UTC,Well i just find it a little ironic.... The real driving simulator.... Doesnt have a clutch....
granturismo,3e1ba5,Yangomato,3,Tue Jul 21 13:52:15 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're playing with DS3, what's the point of having an extra button for clutch when you're shifting up and down with two buttons? Doesn't it resemble paddle shifters more than clutch + H shifter? If you want a better simulation experience, invest in a wheel, pedals, and a shifter.  That said, you still won't feel 100% you're driving a real car due to the market and technology limitations. You won't feel the g force, feedback from the pedals, etc. The only feedback you get is from what you see on the screen, and the feedback from the wheel. However, the wheel provides more feedback than DS3, and makes the game a lot more fun."
granturismo,3e1ba5,3rdone,3,Tue Jul 21 14:16:41 2015 UTC,"I have a DFGT with a playseat challenge rig. I would recommend to anyone on a budget, it works so well and really is solid though looks like a deck chair. Swap the DFGT with a G27 which you can get great deals on at the moment [not officially supported by PS4] and you're set for some H shift fun. I'm waiting to get a T300rs when GT7 comes out... oh blah, bladdy, blah what a waffler."
granturismo,3e14e3,Manky_Dingo,3,Tue Jul 21 03:46:07 2015 UTC,"First thing to remember is GT6 has a ""consecutive days logged in bonus"".  You'll see the number to the left of your credits total on the main screen.  It maxes out at 5 and when you're at 5 days in a row all your payouts will be 200%.  You start at like 120% then 150%, 170% and finally 200%, I think...So, it's not like you have to wait until Day 5 to make payouts worth while.  I never played GT5, but people who have have said that it's easier/quicker to build a bankroll in GT6 compared to GT5.  Go earn some credits!  You have until the 24th to run the SRT Seasonal Events with the new SRT Vision GT cars.  The payouts are very nice.  I would do those, along with any other seasonal events.  You might want to wait a couple of days until your login multiplier is up to 170% just to maximize the payouts, but that's up to you, of course.  There is also the Quick Match mode that can be quite lucrative.  I personally can't stand it because you end up racing against so many idiots, but if I were in your shoes and trying to grind for credits quickly, I would definitely do several QM races each day.  Obviously, you're also going to want to progress through Career Mode.  As someone already stated, GT6 makes you collect at least half (I think - it might even be a little more than half) of each License Level's stars before it will unlock the license test to progress to the next license class.  The higher the license class, the greater the payouts in races.  That's not to say that you want to just do the minimum in each license class because you get free prize cars for completing all the stars in all license classes and then some classes will give you another prize car if you get all gold trophies in the license tests.  Here is a list of GT6 prize cars and what you must do to earn each car: GT6 PRIZE CARS  You'll even earn credits by racing in Online Mode, but the payouts are very low and 90% of the public rooms are full of morons.  I would use Quick Match, Seasonal Events and Career Mode to grind credits - if you're into building your car collection as quick as possible.  One thing to remember about Seasonal Events in GT6 is, each Wednesday night at 11pm EDT the new Seasonal Events are posted.  They rotate which types of events are offered.  One week, PD will post three new Seasonal Events called A-Spec races.  There are Beginner, Intermediate and Expert level races.  These are great because you can re-run them as many times as you'd like and you'll keep earning credits with every single finished race.  The following week, PD posts 2 Super Lap Seasonal events where you just try to set as low of a Hot Lap time as you're capable.  There are 3 sets of payouts. Bronze, Silver and Gold trophies/payouts depending on what your lap time was.  PD also posts 2 Drifting Events during this week which uses the same 3 levels of payouts depending on what your drifting ""score"" is.  These 4 events only payout one time per level, meaning if you beat the Gold Trophy time in a Super Lap, for instance, you'll get paid the Bronze, Silver AND Gold payouts all at once.  If you run the event again, and even if you improve on your time, you won't get paid anymore.  These aren't grinding events at all.  They're bragging events, if you give a crap about where you rank worldwide for each event.  Good luck!"
granturismo,3e14e3,alb1234,2,Tue Jul 21 14:12:32 2015 UTC,Thankyou for your reply.  Here's where I am at the moment. I'm noticing that the license tests seem to be easier to gold than the previous games and there's only 5 per class as opposed to 10 but there's also 'Mission' runs which seem to be very similar to the previous games' license tests.  I've nearly finished the first 2 sequences of racing (B and National B?) and I haven't even upgraded a car yet. I've only used the car I was forced to buy and other cars that I won from the license/mission/championship.  It seems like they've diluted the GT series making it easier for people to start playing and win but from someone who has enjoyed the challenge of every GT game since the original on PS1 it's a bit of a disappointment.  Hopefully as I progress the game will get better and more challenging but at the moment it's a bet... meh.  Your detailed answer is appreciated though
granturismo,3e14e3,Idlers_Dream,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:37:28 2015 UTC,The best challenges will be in the online lobbys.  Find a good group and start friending good drivers.
granturismo,3e14e3,carmaster22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:18:31 2015 UTC,"Don't count on the difficulty increasing.  PD really made career mode, including the license tests, way too easy to get gold.  Even in the super lap seasonal events, the gold time is a joke.  I was disappointed with this aspect as well since getting gold in all of the license test has been such a challenge in the previous GT games.    Also, the AI in anything single player is absolute garbage.  To make it even remotely fair, I'll usually detune my car 50 to 100PP lower than what the restriction is set at.  Even with that, they are just moving chicanes and the challenge is just running consecutive clean laps to catch up to the leader (since nearly every race is a rolling start where start last and have to pass everyone).    But yeah, the quickest way to make money is to get the 5-day bonus and complete the seasonal events.  The Redbull Standard championship also pays out fairly well and you can complete the 5 races pretty quickly."
granturismo,3e14e3,Harvester_of_Sorrow,2,Tue Jul 21 22:10:46 2015 UTC,"First, I'd do the seasonal events for the SRT Tomahawk. Then do the regular races. I think the license tests become unlocked after you finish every race in the class.   Nothing I can think of.  The Shelby GT500 is good and cheap. There's the Lotus 97T and 2014 X1's that you can win. You can get all GT5 DLC and preorder cars too.    Check the seasonal events for cars that you can win. You can win cars from the Goodwood events too.   PD hasn't said anything about the servers."

granturismo,3e14e3,Harvester_of_Sorrow,2,Tue Jul 21 13:39:17 2015 UTC,If you preordered GT5 you would get some of the chrome line and stealth model cars. That's the only way to get them. In GT6 you can buy them like they're regular cars.

I almost got it in the LM55 last night, but the AI's making me work for it.  It seems to adjust its pace based on the player's skill somehow...to win this one I'm going to have to tease the 6 minute barrier [5:59 or better], or hope for a better opponent set.

Other car shows should also do comparisons against sims from time to time seeing as sim racing is quite a big scene with car enthusiasts. Fifth gear had a section with comparing the realism of different sims but not as great as this.
granturismo,3dbm9s,nocnoc94,2,Wed Jul 15 09:43:15 2015 UTC,Could've been before the days of FFB wheels/before steering wheels they became more than a novelty (the DFGT didn't arrive until a couple of years after GT4 was released). Clarkson certainly looks about 10 years younger in this video.
granturismo,3dbm9s,kilogttam,-1,Thu Jul 16 02:16:51 2015 UTC,"One thing. I bought the same NSX in GT6 as the one he drove in GT4. And I managed to beat him by not even a full second with a wheel. I don't know if he's really good at gran turismo, if I'm crap at it or maybe he's using different tyres. I've seen one of the people point this out on Youtube and if he really is using some sports soft tyres or even racing then he would manage a much faster lap, than he would with stock tires."
granturismo,3dbm9s,OMGWTFBBQHAXLOL,3,Wed Jul 15 17:24:14 2015 UTC,Physics have also improved since GT4. I tried to go back and play it but the actual driving hasn't aged very well. It's easier to get a good lap now since the game follows reality better.
granturismo,3dbm9s,jigielnik,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:39:31 2015 UTC,"The other thing is that GT4 defaulted to putting traction control on all cars even cars which never had traction control (like the NSX) and it's racing traction control, too, so if you leave it on you won't even realize it and it makes your times faster."
granturismo,3dbm9s,nocnoc94,4,Wed Jul 15 18:37:39 2015 UTC,Traction control slows you down imo
granturismo,3dbm9s,jigielnik,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:19:47 2015 UTC,"It depends on your driving style, I think.  Personally, I like to have the TC totally off for the sole purpose of knowing I'm driving the car in as close to a real-life setup as possible.  However, you definitely can set the TC and other aids up in ways that can really help"
granturismo,3dbm9s,foxden_racing,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:22:15 2015 UTC,"I only leave TC on, usually for fast racecars like in Le Mans or faster super cars like the Huayra, which makes them easier to drive and lowers the chances of spinning out, especially if its RWD."

granturismo,3dbm9s,smeisinger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:22:40 2015 UTC,With the LeMans cars I usually play with the Drive train settings instead of using TCS. Lowering the initial torque settings helps prevent excessive wheel spin.

granturismo,3d33bl,politan1531,6,Mon Jul 13 03:25:10 2015 UTC,"They're not cumulative, if that's what you're asking.  But, you also shouldn't always go straight to the top tier for power, either [and don't go too stiff on suspension / brakes unless you've got tires that can take the heat].  There is such a thing as too much of a good thing, even in cars; a car you can reliably push can be faster than a car which is more powerful but extremely hard to handle.    In addition, you have to match the car to the track.  A top speed of 250mph and 10 seconds of turbo lag isn't going to do you a lick of good someplace like Tsukuba, where you'd be better served with a slower but more responsive engine...but will serve you well someplace like High Speed Ring, with its long flat-out sections."
granturismo,3d33bl,foxden_racing,2,Mon Jul 13 03:54:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I meant to ask if they're cumulative. Thanks for clearing that up. I thought I had to get each of the three upgrades in order to have a ""full"" upgrade."
granturismo,3d33bl,dougmcunha,4,Mon Jul 13 04:05:46 2015 UTC,"From my experience, ""bigger is better"" is true for most upgrades, but when it comes to turbos and NA Tune, later stages (which provides more power output) also changes the power band, thus the characteristics of the car. As already said, you can build a really powerful car, but not as responsive (with a very narrow power band and lots of turbo lag).  One way to reduce the issue is to do a transmission upgrade that address the issue. These are other kind of upgrade in which they are all different, not necessarily better. A closer ratio transmission allows you to keep your revs closer to the (now narrow) useful power band of the engine. And a customizable transmission will even let you set individual gear ratios, giving you absolute control to match the car characteristics to any track characteristics."
granturismo,3d33bl,Helpmetoo,6,Mon Jul 13 07:09:38 2015 UTC,"I think engine and turbo upgrades need the previous stage to be purchased, but do not rely on them for power as only one can be fitted at a time. (haven't played gt1 much, this is from experience with gt2 onwards)"
granturismo,3d33bl,FFStudios,3,Mon Jul 13 03:28:28 2015 UTC,"Only go for the racing upgrades. The mid-tier upgrades are only useful when you're low on cash and if you have the credits, you get a bigger benefit by just upgrading to the highest stage possible."

The users aren't as bad, but everyone is stubborn as fuck and they get very nasty and snarky.  I've been banned three times.  The reason you need to wait for moderator approval to use your account after signing up is because of me.  No word of a lie.  I fucked with a moderator from multiple accounts using proxy servers after he pissed me off, when he was absolutely wrong.  Can't remember what it was about.    What's funny is that I was looking at another forum one day and it was also about camber in gt6.  Most had read the gtplanet camber theory bullshit thread.  I took a lot of flack for people thinking in was wrong and it turns out guys like praiano and shit realised I was correct.  I race with people like beau and immortal.  I'll be damned if I'm wrong lol.  Anyways, I was looking and someone linked to one of my posts from the GTplanet thread.  It was after I was banned on gtplanet.  They were saying things like ""that dude 332i is a dick, but he is right"" and ""I tried his camber and toe methods and I agree"".  I was surprised that people found it and glad to see that months later people were acknowledging it as being correct.  The tuners suck on there too.  The only ones that are decent are praiano, sw_10 and dabomb330.  They're the only ones who can crack into the top 100 in seasonal time trials of the tuners.  I can usually crack into the top 100, but have never posted tunes because people get too nasty and critical of some peoples' tunes.  So I've never bothered.  There's just too much tension and anger on GTplanet.  I did two series on there as well.  An FGTA series, which fell apart because people got too catty off the track.  Then I did a dtm series.  I quickly realised there was only one other guy who could compete with me.  Bth_pimiki.  He is very good and races clean.  I've never battled with someone online like we did.  But there were too many incidents that were huge bouts of ignorance.  I figure most were too young or just didn't know how to race.  People would block pimiki and I, when they were a lap or laps down.  I got wrecked out of a race by some idiot who tried to rejoin the track without looking for traffic after he crashed.  Pimiki got hit by some shit head who crashed.  After he crashed, he sat in a sand trap and quit, but not out of the room.  Then, he decided he was going to drive around for no reason about 20 minutes later.  He lolly gags around and cuts off pimiki as he was trying to catch me and pimikis race was done.  I won every single race that I wasn't wrecked in and half way through I quit as did three others.  Too many shit drivers and people who didn't understand racing, like blue flagging themselves, rejoining asap and then wrecking people, etc.  It was disappointing and people got pissy with each other in the thread for it on GTplanet.  People can't handle being told they don't belong racing yet and shit.    Overall, not a good forum."

granturismo,3d07c2,332i,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:57:56 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for realistic physics, gran turismo is the wrong game for you.  I've been playing it since it came out, along with some sims.  The environmental physics are actually pretty good - the way the cars react to the road, etc.  A big problem is grip and the speeds you can go because of it.  The tuning physics make no sense, but they're not very extensive, so that's not a big deal.  Camber is still broken though...for nearly two years.  It's as if they have decided to give up on it.  You can brake late as hell in every single car.  I don't play with ABS, unless it is a time trial that I know I can get to the top 100 or so and #1 on the leaderboard is also using abs.  If they're not, then you'll know that no abs is faster for that car/track combo.  That said, you can lock brakes up and regain grip before it affects the car or your time much.  When your running 5% diff lock, because there is so much mechanical grip, something is wrong.  That said, I love GT for the most part.  It's just not close to being a sim yet."
granturismo,3d07c2,Alexlam24,0,Sun Jul 12 18:05:43 2015 UTC,"My friend has a 700hp 3 rotor FD that can spin its tires into 3rd gear IRL on racing slicks. My 686 FD doesn't even spin into 3rd. The grip is ridiculously high, even on CS tires. 300 HP turbo GT86 should be a drift car on CM tires right? Nope, not in GT. Edit: 3 rotor IRL"
granturismo,3d07c2,332i,0,Sun Jul 12 18:10:41 2015 UTC,"Yep.  It's pretty comical.  Fun, but comical.  There's less grip with tire wear turned on when you play online, but it is still insane."

granturismo,3cmr4i,rick_mcdingus,6,Thu Jul 9 02:53:45 2015 UTC,"The DFGT will get the job done, but the g27 is definitely a step up. I used a DFGT from the launch of gt5 until about a year ago before i went for the g27. My experience has been that it makes a ton less noise and does a better job handling the force feedback due to the helical gearing. Having the H shifter is a very nice plus. It's the cheapest feeling part of the whole package, but still nice to have. The quality of the wheel is better and feels better in my hands. The break pedal feels better with its different spring, but there are better ones you can replace the stock one with.   It's very far away from something belt driven with a quality shifter, wheel mod, and load cell brake. That said, I'm very happy having purchased mine. I still want something better, but I'm not in the position to pick up a good thrustmaster or what have you. It's my opinion that if you're looking for a ""budget"" wheel, you should just save for the g27."
granturismo,3cmr4i,ConfusedAboutDucks,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:54:07 2015 UTC,"I bought a wheel with a cord system just because I wanted one for years and had an amazon gift card. Said fuck it and bought it, i feel depending on the car it makes the game so much more fun, but some cars are legitimately undriveable with it for me like the Tomahawk X. I can't drive that thing around the 'ring for shit with the wheel but when I use my ds3 I can easily do it in 5:30 or less. This is really good to know though about the G27 though so when I have the money for it!"
granturismo,3cmr4i,winnipegjets31,3,Thu Jul 9 06:32:57 2015 UTC,"people who own the G27 will tell you that it is, people who have owned a G27 will likely tell you that it is not.  I started with a DFGT, then ""upgraded"" to a G27..for about a month. Then really upgraded to a fanatec CSR wheel, elite pedals and a th8a shifter and its an unbelievable night-and-day experience.  The G27 would be a better first wheel, but for me, it's not an upgrade over the DFGT. The G27 wheel is okay, paddle shifters are nice, the buttons are nice, same with the leather wrap. It's still noisy af and you can feel all the gear notches when you turn it, its still a good wheel despite this. The pedals suck, a minor upgrade over the DFGT (although I liked the feel of the DFGT brake with a squash ball jammed in the little cavety behind the brake pedal, better than the feel of the G27 brake). and the shifter is pretty much worthless. Its absolutely tiny and feels like a kids toy.  I'd keep your DFGT, if you're still using it daily after a few months, drop the coin on some good gear. Not necessarily Fanatec (I hear thrustmaster has some great wheels).  Also keep an eye out on classified ads for used gear in your area. I was able to get all of my fanatec gear on the real cheap, otherwise I'd probably still be using my G27 and urging you to buy one too!"
granturismo,3cmr4i,Sens420,2,Thu Jul 9 13:15:48 2015 UTC,"The G27 is a very good wheel, quiet, good quality, and fairly priced. But here is the thing... the g27 will never work on the PS4. I am selling mine for this exact reason."
granturismo,3cmr4i,Starky513,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:06:14 2015 UTC,"I have both, and they both have about the exact same steering feel. Only reason to go with the g27 is if you really want to use that third pedal and the shiftier. Both of those extras really didn't do it for me they just didn't feel real to me. The clutch in gt5-6 just feels like an on off switch and the H shifter just felt to plasticy for me. I ended up just using the paddles after a while making the extra features kinda useless."
granturismo,3cmr4i,steve2166,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:47:12 2015 UTC,"I think it was worth it. I really like the feel of the G27 over the DFGT, it's a lot more solid. I like the shifter because it puts me more into the game, even if it does feel plasticy. There are mods you can do to make it feel less cheap, just YouTube it (although I haven't down them myself). Also, the G27 is loads quieter, it clunks around a little with the bumps in the road, but it is nothing like the whirring of the DFGT. Overall, I think it's worth it."

However, I'm sure you're probably going to want to play GT7 whenever that game comes out. Now, neither the DFGT nor the G27 is supported by the Playstation 4. So, you're going to have to buy a new wheel fairly soon anyway. Therefore, you might as well go the less expensive route right now since you won't be using this wheel for several years anyway.   Of course, everything I just said might be hogwash if you are not planning on getting a PS4 and GT7 when the game becomes available."

granturismo,3ce96w,dougmcunha,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:04:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe it has to do with the pressure sensitive buttons. DS4 does not have them. On the track they don't work at all? Or they work partially? I suggest you to try and set accelerate/braking to right analog stick and steering to the left stick. If the problem are the pressure sensitive buttons, you should not have problems with the analog sticks."

But I'll be honest, if there is no tuning...I'm down in the 500s.  I have to be in a car that is catered to my driving style or I am shit.  I turn in very hard and late.  I don't bother with the street car time trials.  I have trouble with those.  Same thing.  Only top 300-500.  It is annoying.  Any formula car or 600-700pp race car trial - no problem if I do 30 laps or so...I can step far into the top 100 like yourself...otherwise...nope not happening.  I can't get street cars to turn in hard enough.  I'll be honest, I love downforce, speed and grip.  Otherwise, I just don't have enough interest to push it and try to get up into the higher end.  Either way, FYI...we're in the top .1% haha.  I know it is just a game but it feels good.  If you want my formula gt setup, pm me.  I'm pretty high up and can't remember the place number now and I'm sure I got stacked up a few positions since Saturday.  I can only gain a second or so from here...maybe two, but immortal is killing me.  He's given me setups and advice before, but he is far more diligent.  I don't have his patience.

granturismo,3c3tvp,greenfuzzysocks,8,Sat Jul 4 14:36:34 2015 UTC,"T300rs is the best option there in my opinion, especially comparing it to the G29.. both are the same price but the Thrustmaster has a belt-driven system with a brushless servo motor, while the Logitech is using the same old hardware as their 6-year-old wheel (gear-driven, brushed motors) with a double in price for seemingly no reason. Gears give the FFB a clunky feel and create friction/noise and brushed motors are more prone to wear, belts eliminate friction/dead zone and the FFB feel is better and more precise. It's what makes the G29 a mid-range wheel and puts the T300/Clubsport V2 a step above.  The Fanatec has a belt-driven system and a brushless FFB motor like the T300 so it should really be a decision between those two. I haven't used the Fanatec so I can't really compare it to my T300 in build quality but I personally preferred the design and style of it to the Fanatec. You can't really go wrong between the two though."
granturismo,3c3tvp,kilogttam,4,Sat Jul 4 16:22:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The  G29 is just a G27 with a facelift. Same pedals, same motors, and no H-gate shifter."
granturismo,3c3tvp,codmw3master,2,Sat Jul 4 16:47:27 2015 UTC,"The steering wheel is a bit different and there is a controller built into it.  I'm pretty sure the gears have less backlash, too.  Is there any info confirming the motors are the same exact units?"
granturismo,3c3tvp,332i,2,Sat Jul 4 16:53:54 2015 UTC,"Can't find anything that says they're the exact same motors but the features/specifications are worded identically (""dual-motor.. helical gear.. anti-backlash"")."
granturismo,3c3tvp,kilogttam,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:37:27 2015 UTC,"I have the T300rs. I'm not sure if the problem exists on PS4 as well, but you have to reset the wheel turning range every race. Futhermore, it can't be done in the settings menu, you have to pause the game, set the turning range and resume. If you do it before the race starts, you get this weird speed-wobble like effect.  Other than that, it's alright. The pedals are terrible though. No resistance on the break pedal and you absolutely need to mount it to something, using it just sitting on the floor is not an option. I'd personally look towards the Fanatec. I'm personally wishing I went that route and plan on doing so on my Sim PC build."
granturismo,3c3tvp,WafflesInTheBasement,2,Mon Jul 6 02:26:23 2015 UTC,"I've had no such problems. I can restart the game/console, unplug the wheel from the USB, unplug it from the wall.. and when I come back to it it's still set at the rotation I used last. So either your wheel is faulty or the driver for PC is just really that poor.   But we agree on the pedals. The way I saw it though is the $400 is the first step toward a really solid set-up, once upgraded to the T3PA-pro pedals and the TH8A shifter Im only in it $700 which is still competitively priced. You could save a couple hundred by going the 911 GT3 V2 route but I believe I miss-spoke earlier when I said it had a brushless motor, I was thinking of the Clubsport V2 wheel base. According to this the motor used in the 911 V2 (RS-550) is a carbon brushed motor, which doesn't make it a bad wheel by any means but a wheel base from Fanatec that's most comparable to the T300rs is in fact $600 by itself. Once you buy the rim and any pedals you're at twice the cost we spent on the T300 and you still need an H-shifter."
granturismo,3c3tvp,kilogttam,4,Tue Jul 7 04:24:59 2015 UTC,"If your main point of consideration is ps4 compatibility, it's my opinion that the upcoming g29 is a waste of money. For the same price you can get a belt driven wheel from thrustmaster.   The g27 is great (albiet not ps4 ready) because it has sold build quality, is relatively easily modable, and is decent value for money. I firmly believe the g29 is horridly, inexcusably overpriced for a gear driven wheel. If you're spending at least 400 then please please go with thrustmaster over Logitech."
granturismo,3c3tvp,ConfusedAboutDucks,2,Sat Jul 4 16:57:58 2015 UTC,Thrustmaster all the way! G29 is now head to head with the t300 and can't compete imo. I think Logitech just out priced themselves. Edit: word

I browse GTplanet after new updates come out to see what's up and have noticed with the last update that a TON of people are essentially saying: Fuck the VGT cars.  I agree for the most part.  They're getting a little silly.  The Chapparel is a ridiculous concept.  The Tomahawk feels like a down-tuned redbull X1 with a snappy ass.  All the VGTs have fantastic brakes, grip, etc. too.  Which I like, but they all feel generally the same.  The loose grip quite linearly, too.  Most don't step out very easily, they just slowly slide away from the apex if your entry is too hot.  The only one I like is the Mazda, because it looks like it could actually fit current LMP rules with a few aero changes to conform to them.    The Dodge is annoying.  It's fun fighting the car for a few laps and then it gets annoying.  I've not tried tuning it yet though.  I'm in the top 1 or 200 right now in the FGT time trial at silverstone and I can easily go a second or two faster with a new setup I put together late a few night ago...but, I couldn't even put a proper lap in with the Dodge at Willow Springs and didn't bother registering a time.  Same at daytona.  That's absurd.  Some cars just don't click with me, but if it is to the point that I can put a lap in that sends me to the top 1% of GT6 players in every formula car time trial GT6 has hosted..but I can't pull a decent lap out of the Dodge, something is wrong.  I'll probably try the Nurb one, just because I know the track to the T.  We'll see.  I just think it is bizarre that a I can be so good in one car and absolute trash in another.  And the Dodge feels like it has more downforce than the FGT, too lol.  IDK.  Beats me."

granturismo,3bxp8k,CheifWaterMelonHead,6,Fri Jul 3 00:39:50 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about the 'ring then hopefully you have a wheel for starters!  What I did was switch every aid off with the exception of abs but put active steering to strong. It's still difficult but this should help, remember the brakes are amazing so you can break really late. Try to think one corner ahead, don't fixate on just ahead of you and good luck!"
granturismo,3bxp8k,3rdone,5,Fri Jul 3 00:51:25 2015 UTC,"I was forced to use a Dualshock since my wheel was back in college, and I managed to Bronze it on default settings with a few seconds to spare after a few tries, so it is possible. Not exceptional by any means, but enough to clear it and get the car.  Just to add, throttle control is key, you should be accelerating 50% for just under a second out of each corner to ensure you're on track and ready to go. You'll be comfortable enough to use the drag mode on some of the smaller straights after a while, but be careful not to overuse it, since if one wheel touches the grass, your car will spin out."

If you are using a controller, try using the right stick as your throttle as you can give it a little bit of throttle compared to the on/off switch of the x-button. Take your time, and don't think you are going to not finish in time because you are going too slowly in one section. I took plenty of time, and was 1 second off gold (after 42 tries) If you want to floor it, make sure you are completely straight, and instead of just pinning the throttle, build it up and little slower than normal."

There's plenty of time, don't forget to use the low drag mode on the final straight to make up some time. Its difficult, but doable. If you can't concentrate for the full lap, pause the race for a minute and continue then. I think I only enabled active steering, tcs to 5 and abs to 3."

So definitely not the Le Mans winning car, and in fact a car which is not in Gran Turismo.  Plus if the car is owned by Mazda, they will probably restore it themselves. As far as I know, that's what they did with the 787B. I think there has been like 3 or 4 ever made, and all of them are not necessarily owned by Mazda, or may not even exist anymore."

granturismo,3bsq6y,happysealND,5,Thu Jul 2 06:47:32 2015 UTC,"This is gonna sound weird, but: Drive fast as patiently as possible.  Nitro for accelerating out of slow-ish high-traction corners [nitro to accelerate > nitro for top speed, but nitro to spin tires = bad] to gain time, and get a run on nearby cars.  The three big score boosts at the end are Max Combo Size, Perfect [which IIRC is a quarter million just by itself], and Time Remaining, so on that I can give the following advice:    If you've gotta lose a second or two to make sure you don't cuff an AI, lose a second or two to make sure you don't cuff an AI.  The effects of a good combo is a lot higher than the 5k you'll get for having an extra second left. Don't over-drive yourself into a wall, or the grass, or another car...the half-second you save braking at the last possible instant is going to earn you a lot less than having a strong combo.  Chances are you're braking too late anyway; in terms of lap time, a good exit is faster than a hard entry. And most importantly: anticipate the AI's line.  Put your car where it won't be, instead of expecting it to not put its car where yours is.  Honestly, this is sound advice for any racing, not just against braindead AI.  The only car you control is your own; the easiest way to avoid a wreck is to anticipate where the other guy's gonna go, and then go somewhere else."

I want to keep my pedal setup -_-  But, I hate a lot of steering input.  I run the 270* lock pattern, because the 450 lock pattern annoys me with most formula and LMP cars and that is all I care about in GT6.  But, I need something more around 330-370 and I heard that the T300 has that lock option?  Is that true?"
granturismo,3bplk1,spiffydeezy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:26:07 2015 UTC,"I thought perhaps it'd be a more broad change on how the clutch mechanic functions in general.  And not directly but a $20 adapter would fix that for you. I cant personally compare it to a G25 as the only Logitech wheel I ever owned was the DFGT, but from all accounts Ive heard it's better in both build quality and hardware.. namely the FFB motor and belt-driven system in the base. It's a $400 wheel that doesn't include an H-shifter but the drastic improvement in FFB has proved totally worth it to me. Plus when I eventually upgrade the pedals and get the shifter add-on I'll have a high-end wheel at around $700, and that seems like a hard or impossible price point to beat in comparable Fanatec gear.  I haven't used it with any PC sims as mine isnt capable enough to run any of them, and I believe I can only get to 180/360/540/720/900 in GT6, so I cant say if it can be calibrated to any degrees in between 180-1080 or not but I would imagine so."

I really with they do though, somehow...    The rear toe angle can really screw you if you touch grass or kerbs, it'll put you sideways and you'll have to skid to a stop to be able to drive on. Nissan said for the race they would would have to keep off the kerbs and drive neatly, which cost a lot of time Just like car #22 in Le Mans, the front end is HARD, and it gets really uncomfortable and bouncy, to the point of making it hard to see. with that front weight balance, you can't have the other end-suspension take some of that load off you. Watching it live you could see the guy's head shake about, it was seriously brutal. Can't get power down until you get the wheels straight, typical FF problems ): The aero is good, but the GT6 car just like the real one doesn't have a refined aero package, I've heard this somewhere, but I forget. Most of the LMP1s aren't too crazy aero (edit, clarification: what I mean is visually, think F1), but they have subtle details and things that aren't obvious to an eye that really adds up. Toyota where slow this year but their car is hardly new and unrefined ): Horrifically thick A-pillars, no rearview screen-mirror thing ):   I mean it has good points, it's easy to drive, but I find it more frustrating when I start to feel for the car....

granturismo,3bmbkg,332i,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:36:14 2015 UTC,"Couple of things to keep in mind there. The first is that, all of those little winglets and aero-gubbins all add to the overall drag of the car, and is less than ideal. Second thing is that this was the ""High Speed/Low Drag/Low Downforce/Le Mans"" body work. From what I have read they have been working on adapting a high downforce body for the rest of the WEC rounds. And keep in mind that almost all of the cars downforce comes as a result of exploiting the front splitter, and the flow through tunnels helping to get maximum efficiency out of it. So a lot of winglets and other aero-gubbins you see on the Audi and Porsche are not going to be as critical on the Nissan. In theory, at least anyway.  That said, I do feel that there are some elements missing from the car, that could probably be readdressed and improved. As during the cars testing and development, the only area they changed was the lip on the forward edge of the radiator outlet, and little else. I think their front nose shame will likely change significantly, and the leading edge of the splitter will probably get significant reworking, now that they understand how the air-flow directly effects the car in anger. Also, there may be required changes to the bodywork that come with the much needed suspension upgrades and modifications to help improve the drivability and durability over rough curbs.  Now that we know what we know, moving forward there should be some interesting innovations, and I look forward to seeing them figure it out."

The car burns through tires like they're going out of style because most of the weight is in the front and with that, the lack of pressure on the back tires won't keep them stuck as well and they won't warm up as much as the front two. It's a brilliant design, but there's many pitfalls. It probably worked wonders in testing, but a nonstop 24 hour race really shows what's what.   Go Audi and Dr Ulrich!

The standard Lancia Delta HF Integrale is the best car in its class, IMO. They just stuck a 4WD onto a hatchback, but somehow, everything just turned out to be perfect. You've got to get the tuning right, though. Otherwise, it turns like a brick.   The Dodge Challenger R/T '70 is pretty amazing. This is your basic FR. Everything about this car is average.

That thing won everything, especially once you get to the point where you have tyre wear and fuel consumption, because it's so light on usage. Another popular option is the Rocket, which basically doesn't use fuel or tyres, so you can save on the pit stops and basically erase the huge gap you start with."
granturismo,3bn3mw,flipjj,2,Tue Jun 30 16:48:48 2015 UTC,"A fair chunk of the difficulty in a race is going to come down to what your 'draw' is.

If you want to cheese the races, the TS030 / F1 GTR / R35 Touring Car are all solid picks; the Citroen GT Race Car and Ford GT LM Spec II are nice as well.  But, this is also a great opportunity to improve as a driver; the AI's big weakness is in the braking zone, further hurt by their line selection...keep at it, try to be calmer at corner entry [less last-minute in for a faster exit], and your skills will eventually be good enough to win with a subpar car."

I would much rather see the coursemaker enter the game than these stupid concept cars.   I don't understand the point of a concept car if there is never any intention of making it a reality. A manufacturer could claim anything if they don't have to prove it."
granturismo,3belyd,Sterling_____Archer,2,Sun Jun 28 19:23:27 2015 UTC,Concept cars are just cool to use. I do agree a car like this is pointless. It's all lies. Even using it on a course is almost impossible since you can't use any power. However for this track it was made to be out of control speeds and this car is perfect for it.

But since I hate the Red Bull cars as well, I guess it makes sense?   I'm experimenting with the S for B Spec, but I don't think I'll be driving these things much, to be honest.  I can't understand why you'd make a car that can go 0-1 billion in 1 second and not work on the cornering. I have zero fun going super fast then super slow for a turn then super fast again, rinse and repeat. I like when it flows and I just couldn't make these things flow properly.  But I'm actually glad you love them, so that you're happy with the update and so it means PD isn't completely lost (yet). In a way, it's comforting to know someone liked them."

My problem with the cars is that they are very inconsistent. One corner they turn ok in 2nd, the next one, in 3rd, they are horrendous. I couldn't really get in a groove and I was having zero fun in them.  If you found a tune for it, would you mind sharing?"
granturismo,3b916z,flipjj,8,Sat Jun 27 00:52:58 2015 UTC,"World of difference. However, I don't feel comfortable giving out any tunes because 1. I don't really have one, I just solve handling issues as they come up and 2. My tunes are probably unorthodox and not ""good"" technically speaking, I just tune cars so that they're fun and easy to drive. I will say this though, set toe to 0, and decrease acceleration sensitivity to 5. Should make it easier to drive, but beyond that, you might just have to wait for one of the big tuners to publish one or learn how to tune yourself."

I drove the Tomahawk a bit yesterday as a goof (Red Bull Ring while my friends were driving a 417PP Camaro, there were a lot of crashes) and get it. The Nordschleife is probably the least suitable track for that thing to drive on, by the way. Still not a fan of it, because of the cornering abilities being waaaaaaay worse than the POOOOWWWWAAAAHHH abilities, but I at least understood it, I managed a few good laps, I tested it like a normal car and it worked.

Try Willow Springs with the Tomahawk X, it' s a fast track (The fastest of the West!) and if you fuck up, you can always throw the car around!

Also, who the hell had the patience to deal with this car enough to hit a 3:21? Jesus....  I still think it's ridiculous to take the time to make this car and not make sure it turns correctly. Once those aero flaps hit, the car ""jumps"" and it wrecks the lap. I took the Lotus 97T to the Red Bull Ring and did a 1:13. In the Tomahawk X, I did a 0:56. That difference is just ridiculous. Not that I drive well or anything, but same driver taking 17 seconds off in a lap that is so short is not a simulation, it's arcade."

If you feel like you are going to lose control, jump on the brakes and keep it on the road, over 100 km/h it' s quick to brake. And you don' t need to know every corner of the Nürburgring, when I don' t remember where it goes or I can' t see the next corner, I just brake or simply tap the accellerator, you don' t lose too much time and you definitely won' t spin out (I got 5:05 chilling, in a some time I can easily go under the 5:00 mark).

The gearing is pretty realistic, irl when moving off in first the car always feel jerky unless u step it down a bit more than u will usually do on a car, the first gear is just incredibly long.

Now obviously most cars be tuned sane by a person who knows what they're doing (unlike me) but a lot of cars seem to only meet their true crazy undriveability when you slap a huge engine into it or a supercharger or what not.  Prime example, the Mercury Cougar XR-7. It's pretty low PP for the potential power that you can get out of that thing in a straight line. With the Supercharger and max engine in a straight it can get up past 200 mph. But then you hit a corner and you realize why they put it at so low of a PP. It is -undriveably- squirrely at high speeds. I have no idea how to tame that thing but I kind of love it even still, as it never crashes boringly. Its never just you turning into a wall, its always some complete 360, tire smoking engine killing flip end over end into another driver level of crash. Its fun times."

You'd have to snap the wheel to full lock very quickly with most of the weight loaded on the outside wheels or simply lock the brakes up.    I have an e36 M3 and an e46 325ci IRL.  My e46 has decent all seasons on it and I can't break the rear loose with my foot to the floor from a dead stop unless I'm turning out of somewhere at 90 degrees like merging out if a parking lot.  M3 is a lot easier to snap loose, but it's got ~100 more hp.  I have summer tires on that.  I'd put them at SM in the game with a car that has 300hp in GT6.  I'd put CM to CS as all seasons."

Even down to silly things like that.  We can't change the language in the US and my buddies in ireland and UK can't change their's either.  You'd think in the US that you could change it to spanish as well, but no.  I'm guessing probably not, but ask on GTplanet.  People on there will know for sure.  I'd poke around but I'm banned on there :p"

I haven't touched GT6 in a while though, and I'm trying to finish all the tours in DC that I haven't completed yet. Another reason is that I just didn't bother booting up my PS3 for only GT6.

There's a rewarding sense of progression with how much money you get for events, early events will give you enough to buy cars like the Mazda RX7 and the more further you get in the game you start getting enough to buy Ferraris.   You just need to sink some hours into the game if you want to try out the higher end cars, but since the game has realistic handling it's quite interesting getting the feel for all sorts of different cars first."

At least give us the ability to put any car in any race once we've beaten the game  It's incredibly annoying that I can't, just for fun, truly crush the competition in any race.   If you look at GT4, the PP system starts to feel like cheap game design, because in GT4 the natural progression of winning races/getting prizes meant that for most of the story mode, you can pretty much only afford cars that are competitive in the level of races you happen to be in. The PP forces you to progress through the story mode like a pathetic rookie, even if you're great at the game."
granturismo,39zpzp,klevenisms204,2,Tue Jun 16 15:41:15 2015 UTC,"The PP system is awesome for online races, just set a PP and know that everyone will be roughly equal on the track, without it being a 1-make race, and it still allows players to tune their cars to their liking."

If anything it shows PD cares about putting more effort into their games than simply cranking out titles at the rate of Call of Duty. Maybe if Turn 10 took another year on FM6 they would've succeeded at things like dynamic time and weather progression instead of doing the absolute very least to say they've include those things."
granturismo,39zpzp,loldriveclub100,-4,Tue Jun 16 16:21:26 2015 UTC,"PD cares more about getting all the visual details on the Roman Colosseum that you can barely see from the track right than addressing long-standing problems like their garbage engine sounds.  This isn't some case of them being the real heroes and T10 cranking out Call of Duty sequels, it's a case of them spending the last decade in the woods.

granturismo,39zpzp,baron_aloha,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:34:22 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. I've spent a lot of time in both franchises, and I massively prefer the Forza approach. 5 might have been a little light on tracks but it was polished and beautiful and well worth its price.   PD as an org does not seem to know how to build software. They do a few things well, but they do a lot of things really poorly because they can't seem to manage their time. Standard cars, sound, the AI, the single player campaign, these are all years behind the curve now and they really need to figure things out.  I love both franchises but  Forza is consistently delivering for its fans IMO, and PD is not."
granturismo,39zpzp,smeisinger,2,Tue Jun 16 20:52:04 2015 UTC,"What's the importance in rushing it?  GT6 has been a borderline failure.  It has massive faults.  Broken camber, higher top speed by raising one end, tons of physics exploits, you get more grip from have a higher rebound value over compression in the front (which is backwards), the diff lock up rates don't feel anything like they should in terms of preload and momentum changes...many of us could go on forever.  They're just lucky they have the fan base that they have retained.  I like gt6 because the physics and ffb are good enough and I can play casually.  But they rushed it.  That's why the major issues exist. You can also setup a car to basically do whatever it is you want it to.  You can just keep tweaking and eventually it is impossible to not come out with a car that is point and shoot.  I can play online, have a few beers and relax.  If I'm tipsy and off pace...that's fine...I'll be on the ball another night and have just as much fun.  iRacing and GSCE...I can't do that and you have to be ready to rock for them.  There is a legitimate penalty system in iRacing for going off, crashing, bumping into people...it is very regulated...which is great, but I can't play it anytime I want.  You have to put a few hours aside for iRacing every time, too.  It is heavily involved.  There is no oops, sorry my bad.  Which is good. It raises the racing quality.  But you can't go and chat with friends and shit casually.  Gt6...I can just sit down and play for a few min anytime I want.  Or for hours.  Doesn't matter.  These are the reasons why gt6 is great...but the delay is by far necessary for gt7.  They rushed gt6 and it has suffered due to that.  No one buys it for the most part anymore.  It's 1.5 years old.  They're not making money off of the game at this point.  I'm actually curious how they have the money to develop another.  Nissan and such must feed them a LOT of money.  The excuse is to not roll out dog shit to your consumers.  Plain and simple.  If they rush it and pcars, forza, etc. blow it out of the water...GT series is done.  If they wait until those games are released...they can beat the competition as they'll know what the benchmark is.  If they show up not knowing where the benchmark is...it'll probably be the same story as gt6 and they know it.  That's the key to it.  They can't afford to get caught with their pants down again.  AC is coming to consoles, too.  I figure gt7 will be split and b spec will be removed.  My guess is that they will have two different physics options so they can compete on a more involved level, rather than regular gt physics versus srf.  Maybe there will be a middle ground in between better physics, regular and srf.  I have a feeling it will be somewhat like that, so they can compete with all of the major ps4 consoles racing titles.  AC has to do the opposite and get something together so controller players don't flip out about how they can't play it and how unfair it is.  Kind of like controller players for gt6 amidst seasonal events."
granturismo,39zpzp,332i,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:25:56 2015 UTC,"I can't really say they rushed it. They still took three years, almost to the end of the PS3's lifespan to release Gran Turismo 6. Remember the wait between GT4 and the full GT5? Six years.  I just wonder what the PD team does with their time. It's almost as if they have entire teams modeling air vents in car interiors rather than fixing netcode, physics or AI.   According to Wikipedia, Polyphony Digital has 140 employees. Turn 10 has between 100-300 (I guess more are brought in contractually during certain development phases). Maybe PD is just really poorly managed."
granturismo,39zpzp,reddelicious77,6,Tue Jun 16 22:50:43 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, they need to start over. Simplified vs. detailed cars is just embarrasing at this point.

granturismo,39s6oy,Ionalien,8,Sun Jun 14 06:12:34 2015 UTC,"Yes!! GT2 is still my favorite, that's the one I grew up playing along with the 1st. I always had memories of the the Suzuki pikes peak rally car or the vector twin turbo. The Viper GTS was a favorite as well. Don't really play it that much anymore so I don't know if I could satisfy your desire for time trial battles. Still have it though and every once in a while I pop it in for a little replay. Just letting you know you're not the only one who still loves the older ones!"
granturismo,39s6oy,RageLikeCage,4,Sun Jun 14 07:25:17 2015 UTC,"Awesome man. Its so weird the rush I get from playing it. Definitely the pikes peak is a beast. I remember the day I saved up enough credits to buy that my siblings knocked over my PlayStation which corrupted my hundred hour save. That hurt haha. I still haven't gotten around to grinding cash for that again. But I have pimped out way more cars and done more races than that original save. Any reccomendations for really fun cars for a certain style and/or course? I always love the skylines, which is good because there are lots haha."
granturismo,39s6oy,RageLikeCage,2,Sun Jun 14 07:42:49 2015 UTC,"Ah man, there were a lot of things that I liked to play. The Subaru STi's were always fun for myself. Really overall you can't go wrong what you play. I ended up doing something similar with a lost save file, except I accidentally overwrote my completed game with a brand new game (FML). Guess it made me replay the game though lol"

You can choose car or track first.  I actually went back to GT1 last night so I can get 100% completion. Arcade is 100%, all I have left is the 3 marathon races in simulation. Only thng I'm not doing 100% is gold licenses because that's impossible haha"

They really did an awesome job with it.  The biggest problem is the resolution which really is shit. But playing it on an emulator makes it look like a PS2 game (there's plenty of footage on Youtube).
granturismo,39s6oy,LightSniper,4,Sun Jun 14 08:37:22 2015 UTC,Holy shit. I just saw emu footage and you are right. It does look like a ps2 game.
granturismo,39s6oy,ebEliminator,3,Sun Jun 14 15:06:07 2015 UTC,"The graphics are great! I replayed recently on PCSXR and with updated resolution is really does look good. It's also fascinating how many of the sounds are still being used in GT6, like the button-press sound and the klaxon in the races. I'm sure they're modified versions of the old sounds but it's a nice touch. Maybe the biggest issue with replaying GT2 is that you realize how little the GT series has actually changed over the years."
granturismo,39s6oy,ReeferPirate420,3,Sun Jun 14 09:35:44 2015 UTC,"The game changed tremendeslouy. GT6's physics are not just in another ball park, they're on another planet, compared to GT2.  And don't get me started again on how boring the single player got with GT5 ..."
granturismo,39s6oy,horstwrabetz,6,Sun Jun 14 13:28:48 2015 UTC,"I remember loving GT2 as a kid, but whenever I go back I can never adjust to the handling of the cars and how ""loose"" it feels on every turn. After playing GT5 and GT6, where you're trained to brake slightly early, GT1 and GT2 feel almost the opposite."

I mean, engine sounds help the game be complete as a real driving simulator, in my opinion. Because,  Corvette C7 sounding like... Crap. I mean, when you install new exhaust system, and a supercharger, along with all the engine components, you expect it to sound rougher, not lighter. And turbo sounds. Maybe it's a bit too street and is turning away from what GT is, but it'd be nice."

granturismo,39gsx9,eddydjcat,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:06:33 2015 UTC,I agree that sound is a big issue in Gran Turismo.

I can wait a bit longer even though I like the variety that Gran Turismo can offer.

They are easy to put in, sure, which makes putting effort into making something else - redundant. Making the entire game look half-assed.   They should have learned from GT5 and not put any PS2 cars in GT6 already. Quality > quantity. Could have made new models for cars that ARE needed (2j Chapparal, tank car, whatever) and left all the 500 miatas and civics behind. They're useless, they look ugly, they make the entire game look half-assed and they don't belong on PS3. Let alone PS4."
granturismo,394sxj,gordogg24p,11,Tue Jun 9 10:41:05 2015 UTC,"You've given no real reason why the standard models shouldn't be in the game. If it doesn't prevent the addition of more premium models, then there's no argument to be made about whether or not they should go in. No one is ""suffering"" because of the standard cars (as hilariously melodramatic as your word choice is). No one is forcing you to use the standard cars.   500 premium cars plus a bunch of standard cars is far preferable to 500 premiums and nothing more. Ideally, they'd all be premiums, but since that's wildly unrealistic, this is the best option."

Totally saps the immersion when you see that black interior."

I've not seen many other mesh files used for video games.  Types like .STL and such.  IIRC there are about six mesh file types.  I've never seen an object from a PS1/2 game that's wasn't a .obj file.  I haven't looked at many ps3 files as I haven't hacked mine.    Someone who hacked and can look through GT6 files sent me a few.  I do a lot of CAD and 3D printing.  I wanted to see if I could print out a shell.  I've done it for many games.  Sonic, metal gear...all sorts.  Some PS2 cars are clearly refined mesh files.  You can instantly see improved detail and smoother contours, because there are so many more polygons stitched together.  Look at the skylines, RUFs, Cobra R, some of the mercs, dtm cars, etc., etc.  They're just a shit load of polygons connected together to make the shape of whatever object is on the screen."

For example, here's a racing-modded Corvette. These never made it since GT3 used completely new models, so they couldn't be imported. A lot of the car models that came from GT3 could be imported into the next game, so there didn't tend to be many models missing over time from that point on."

I Don't Want to Know (If You Don't Want Me) by The Donnas From GT4. That opening riff is inspired by AC/DC. It's just good old-fashioned, in-your-face, knock-yer-teeth-in rock 'n' roll.

No wheels are locked out by the ps4 itself.  Zero.  The developer of x game you're going to use your wheel on must support said wheel.  Otherwise it will not work.  It is up to the developers.  So get on them to support our wheels - Not Sony.  Nothing to do with them.  No more generic wheel profiles/generic drivers for wheels on either new gen system for games.  That is the problem.  Some wheels don't work with ps3 and xbox360, too.  We just get lucky with gt6 providing generic wheel drivers and logi/thrustmaster profiles.  Only reason people can use fanatecs with GT6 is because they can piggy back the g27 signal.  Otherwise, the fanatec wouldn't work on ps3 with gt6.  It's no different.

I think Fanatec is working on one too, but it's been a while since I've poked around their site.  Personally, unless something better comes along, I'm looking at the T300.  I've already got a wheel for the 360, and that'd cover me for PS3/PS4/PC.  I'd love to get some good Fanatec kit...but for the kind of money I'd put into ""doing it right"", I could almost afford to convert my real car to adjustable struts and better springs.  Their clubsport gear is...not cheap, let's put it that way."
granturismo,38vbx4,jocker12,-1,Sun Jun 7 04:42:24 2015 UTC,Apparently this has come out and it does work. But a downside is that there is a 10% dead zone on the wheel. And they said that they a re currently trying to make it work better for the g27.  http://www.match4newconsole.com/
granturismo,38vbx4,ford_racer,-1,Sun Jun 7 14:49:07 2015 UTC,"Ps4 only supports thrustmaster wheels at this point... there was a discussion about other wheel manufacturers drivers  being not supported and implemented by sony on their ps4's... there is also a petition online to support such implementation at  https://www.change.org/p/sony-add-logitech-and-fanatec-wheel-support-to-ps4 you have to love sony! That petition needs 25.000 supporters, and, as I write this, is 7,585 signatures short... If you want to have a chance to use your wheel with GT7 on PS4, you know what to do!"
granturismo,38vbx4,jocker12,4,Sun Jun 7 03:38:32 2015 UTC,My Fanatec CSR works on my PS4 with PCars.  I'm not sure if you mean they officially support Thrustmaster and the others just work or if by support you think that only TM wheels work.
granturismo,38ttga,Shmogt,2,Sat Jun 6 19:35:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know for sure if it's actually a bug, when you put Engine Stages or Weight Reduction on a car, it's always there. It seems to act as sort of a ""permanent"" upgrade... Sorry this didn't really help but yeah I notice this too."
granturismo,38ttga,TycoonTim46,2,Sun Jun 7 00:52:54 2015 UTC,It ruins the entire point of having different setting tabs
granturismo,38ttga,lavabeing,2,Sun Jun 7 16:30:43 2015 UTC,The settings tab is for configuring things that can be changed back and forth on a car.  Engine stages and weight reductions cannot be undone.  This was the case in GT4 and GT5.  It is not reversible just like a new paint color or the race modifications in GT5.
granturismo,38rszd,StarkTheWhite,3,Sat Jun 6 06:54:29 2015 UTC,If that GT academy kid wins it with a FF Datsun I'll laugh my ass off!   Note: I'm a huge Nissan fan and think this is an unprecedented way of working within the restrictions.
granturismo,38rszd,Xirious,4,Sat Jun 6 09:36:56 2015 UTC,"What Nissan did, to me, shows everything that's wrong with F1 right now.   Regulations mean all the cars look almost identical and the way they achieve their power output is also almost identical.  The LMP cars this year prove you can have radically different designs still create close competition."
granturismo,38rszd,jigielnik,2,Sat Jun 6 21:45:28 2015 UTC,"So will I! It's a long shot but I hope it works, the car is so different which makes me like it that much more!"

granturismo,38rszd,Dehno34,2,Sat Jun 6 17:50:37 2015 UTC,"I would recommend that you drive with traction control off and the ABS set to 0. The best method of getting the car to perform well for you is to stop accelerating before the turn and throw the mass of the car into the corner.   This is different from a MR car, or a RR, or FR where you would want to use the power of the engine to bring the rear wheels about.   Try a track with a few nice, but mild corners, and see if you can throw the front of it in, and let the tail follow.   I hated the car at first, but after getting this technique down, I really, really enjoy driving it"

granturismo,38hto3,pwoodg420,3,Thu Jun 4 08:48:27 2015 UTC,These events are so easy it's like they're from the novice license class.
granturismo,38dtmv,kilogttam,14,Wed Jun 3 15:50:58 2015 UTC,"This is so freaking awesome. I’m stunned.  Together with Project Cars this means either Gran Turismo 7 will get its shit together and get a proper racing game again or I will simply stop caring about it. I will just forget about GT5 and GT6, keep my memories about GT1 to GT4 and play them once a year or so, just for old times sake.  Have you noticed the engine sounds? They’re nothing less than magnificent. In my opinion that’s a crystal clear ""Fuck You"" towards Polyphony."
granturismo,38dtmv,smeisinger,3,Wed Jun 3 16:24:00 2015 UTC,"I reckon polyphony is aware of this. They recently headhunted Forza's lead sound designer to work on GT7. Not sure if he'll be able to power through all the legacy code/design elements of GT, but we'll likely be hearing a substantial upgrade to the general soundscape in GT7."
granturismo,38dtmv,brendan7_,6,Thu Jun 4 14:45:28 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty pumped for this. The only reason I ever bought a playstation 2 and 3 were for GT. after this last gt's disappointment, I finally have a reason to purchase a ps4"
granturismo,38dtmv,Itsjorgehernandez,8,Wed Jun 3 22:35:48 2015 UTC,"If you're a sim racing enthusiast and don't have a very capable PC like myself this is great news. I don't think this is direct competition for GT7 in that they don't aim to create the same experience, but it should further motivate PD to improve various aspects of the racing itself.. and as they say ""the more the merrier"". I can personally see myself owning and enjoying Project Cars, Assetto Corsa, and Gran Turismo 7 and being in racing heaven.  Console launch trailer"
granturismo,38dtmv,Acurus_Cow,2,Wed Jun 3 16:04:51 2015 UTC,"Can we hope for VR Support for GT7?  After driving AC with my DK2 and G27, I can't imagine a racing game that doesn't support VR. It's such a fantastic and amazing experience. It's like actually sitting in a car!   The future for racing games/sims are truly bright!"
granturismo,38dtmv,Strider2211,2,Thu Jun 4 10:00:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah Morpheus is undoubtedly coming to GT7. It's already gotten confirmed support from Project Cars on PS4, maybe Assetto Corsa will be next!"

granturismo,38dtmv,Acurus_Cow,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:24:57 2015 UTC,So what to buy for PS4? PCars or AC?
granturismo,38dtmv,modonaut,2,Thu Jun 4 05:49:40 2015 UTC,"That will depend on what you like about GT.  PCars are more of a racing game with focus on progressing a racing career.  AC is a more full on sim. Less cars, not much of a career mode. But fantastic physics and driving experience."
granturismo,38fk5p,jocker12,8,Wed Jun 3 21:50:41 2015 UTC,Misleading title. Doesn't show the car driving on a ceiling and only says that it is theoretically possible.

granturismo,38cup0,Andefir,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:13:18 2015 UTC,I enjoyed completing these events. They should do something like this again for the seasonal events but maybe with touring cars. Just an idea.

granturismo,38fma1,foxden_racing,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:30:19 2015 UTC,"The car hasn't made general release yet...it's included in the background, so that it can be used in GT Academy Round 4 [where it's the car driven, and the prize for completing a lap].    It's probably not going to see widespread [aka in the dealership] release until after GT Academy ends."

granturismo,38d9tg,nEx944,2,Wed Jun 3 14:07:43 2015 UTC,"I'm actually really enjoying it - it's a huge challenge to manage the understeer and the loss of traction on exit, but it's rewarding when you nail it. It's doing odd things to the field though, I'm showing at 160 when I'm 9 seconds off the pace."
granturismo,38d9tg,WhineFlu,2,Wed Jun 3 16:56:20 2015 UTC,You guys weren't kidding.  That lap sucked. Either cone placement or the car itself. That was the least amount of fun I've ever had with a GT game.   I feel like I just spent an hour in the gym after. 5 or 6 attempts to get a lap in. That car sucks
granturismo,38d9tg,Dehno34,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:45:45 2015 UTC,"The car has enough lift off oversteer to get podium in a Formula D competition, then it understeers horribly. Ugh its bad."

granturismo,38d9tg,Dehno34,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:49:51 2015 UTC,It's similar to my friends time attack Aura RSX. Everything lost in cornering is made up with brute power and speed.

Then I can work on getting in shape [boot camp has a physical], get a wheel, and really go for it next year.  Currently sitting a shade under 3:33, which I'm happy with given that I'm on a controller."
granturismo,38d9tg,mr10am,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:38:06 2015 UTC,I think it has more to do with the FF layout. The description said the reason they went that layout was to increase the design possibilities of the body. You would think they would design the body to generate more downforce to combat the understeer
granturismo,38d9tg,gramcraka92,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:56:47 2015 UTC,No kidding. Feels like they've pursued a design dream while ignoring the fact that the car also has to win the race.

granturismo,38d9tg,gramcraka92,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:50:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, is it actually strong enough to damage the wheel?"
granturismo,38d9tg,jocker12,2,Thu Jun 4 04:48:13 2015 UTC,"I don't lift weights but I take care of myself and have an active job working with hand tools all day. Basically, I'm in decent shape with decent arm strength.  That being said, when I finally got around a clean lap (5-6 attempts) my arms were so worn out and tight I felt like I just lifted weights for an hour straight. That's with a Dual Force GT wheel. Constant, and I mean CONSTANT fighting the wheel and jerking back and forth, especially on the straights. I could definitely see it damaging a wheel after some hard laps."
granturismo,38d9tg,MrDoctorSmartyPants,0,Thu Jun 4 21:34:22 2015 UTC,"Also, if you're using a wheel, how high do you have the maximum torque set to?"
granturismo,38d9tg,jocker12,2,Wed Jun 3 13:56:50 2015 UTC,i have it set to 4 for torque and 5 for sensitivity

granturismo,38d9tg,Dehno34,0,Thu Jun 4 04:46:03 2015 UTC,"That is the main problem and is where the difficulty of this GT Academy round is coming from. It is not realistically, because logically, anyone will try to raise the suspension in order to have tire contact with the tarmac at any time.

granturismo,38buu0,horstwrabetz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:32:27 2015 UTC,I couldn't beat it until I turned traction control to 0 and turned the anti spin (whatever it's called) on. They get a lot easier.
granturismo,38buu0,Dehno34,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:45:31 2015 UTC,"anti-spin IS traction control,  in anycase, do yourselves a favor, and disable ALL aids, these racecars are so much simpler to respond to smooth inputs without any artificial assists that end up messing with your simple command at the helm."
granturismo,38buu0,manlydishwasher,0,Wed Jun 3 13:33:21 2015 UTC,"Or you could have fun with it, and play the game however the hell you want to. It is a video game, you know. If having aids on makes it more fun for you then use the aids. I drive with abs at 1 and 0 TC on regular cars, but the Red Bulls are more fun with the anti spin on in my opinion.  Anyway, I'm not talking about traction control, I'm talking about whatever the auto spin correction is. It may work with the traction control, but it's a separate toggle.  Get off the high horse, your playing a video game, not training to be a race car driver."

granturismo,388ws9,manlydishwasher,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:13:21 2015 UTC,It'll make that up in the straights. Of course only one lap is possible as they'd have to replace the tarmac on the track after it goes by

If you run a good lap, you will have a reference as your ghost and it will be more fun. If I get a red lap, I keep going to understand the rest of it. It is an opportunity to push for the limits because the lap is lost anyway. I keep going and start fresh with a slightly different approach."

For some reason, the inside gives you the feeling of proper traction, comparing to the outside, where is no grip and, while accelerating, you can turn the wheel right - left - right with almost no change of direction."

Not a fun car to drive. I hate FF cars in general, they belong on the road, not a race track! Consequently I suck at driving them and have no desire to get any better.  I did a quick gold run (3:34.2) and then got the hell out of there. Won't spend any time improving it, it's just no fun.  Bit of a shame, expected more out of the final round."

granturismo,386ogx,eloris,2,Tue Jun 2 11:33:30 2015 UTC,"Yes it was. GT6 has always aimed for 60fps. It frequently dips below that, especially when smoke and lots of other cars are in view, but if you're just hotlapping it will be 60 with occasional dips below that the majority of the time.  It's not really that different than GT5 in that regard. GT6 probably drops more frames, but it ends up being less distracting because the tearing isn't quite as pronounced as in GT5 and is less noticeable."

I thought my Civic was the final, best possible 500pp tune for Tsukuba I could make, where FFs actually often prevail, but I lost out to a race car (S2000, it might have been) and marginally to a focus RS with a better driver.  That race, I was running deep into the 54-second range, perhaps even dipping into 53s. But yet the top guy was running low 51s, which was really annoying."
granturismo,37y7uf,GoldenCorral69,1 point,Sun May 31 13:53:38 2015 UTC,"How about the 2010 Camaro SS. 500 pp stock, front and rear independent suspension, so it turns good, big v8 426hp. So turns a lot better than the civic and is a lot faster. Just a quick and easy recommendation.   If you can help it by a suspension and racing brakes. Now when you lower your suspension make sure it is 5 to 10 inches above being slammed. Spring rate I'd say 75% to the right for the front. And 65% to the right for the rear. Then the 3 options below forgot what they are called but the front of the car do 8,7,6. Rear 6,5,4. Camber at a minimum. .5 front and 1.2-1.5 rear at most, in some cases it's  not needed at all, your wheels will spin more and your slower from a dig as well as straights if your camber is too high.   Racing breaks, do 6 front and rear. Buy a fully changeable gearbox. Under that, buy the clutch plate, drive shaft, and a dif. Torque on rear wheels I'd say between 15-20, acceleration setting at 30-40. Brake setting at 25-30.   Add a body kit + spoiler for downforce. All of this does not add any pp, you will stay at 500 and be a lot quicker around the track.  Edit: Spoilers and Ground effects may up your pp."

granturismo,37ude4,VladimirDren,9,Sat May 30 18:59:28 2015 UTC,"GT1 to GT4 had awesome career modes, that’s what really bugs me. Would GT always been boring in single player, I’d just accept it. But it’s been SO good."
granturismo,37ude4,kilogttam,3,Sat May 30 19:32:45 2015 UTC,"Just doubling /u/smeisingers point. GT1 and 2 had AMAZING career modes. GT4's wasn't bad either. And you didn't always have rolling starts.  So what happened?  Polyphony has the physics down, it's graphics are fine as far as I'm concerned. So just improve the freaking career and for the love of god overhaul the boring AI and the game would be PERFECT.  Have the challenges like they do now for those who want em, have the career for those of us who were raised on em. And then online being the icing on the cake."
granturismo,37ude4,VladimirDren,3,Sat May 30 19:56:19 2015 UTC,"While AI and career improvements are Number 2 and 3 on things I want to be significantly improved for GT7, I do think that the online multiplayer experience and functionality should be the primary focus for any game that aims to create a realistic racing experience."

In the later licenses you are so far behind that it isn't fun anymore. :/ For those races you need a car that is way more powerful than the other cars and that is boring. What also annoys me is that most of the races just have a PP restriction. So in an event that says for example only GT3 cars you could drive with your standard street car as long as it has the PP, while all the other cars are GT3 cars."

granturismo,37ude4,samreven,1 point,Sat May 30 18:10:33 2015 UTC,I did the Norschleife one a few days ago and it was really fun. I had a hard time getting there too so I played some Multiplayer and later switched to the Singleplayer again. I was never able to play through a complete class without some breaks in the Multiplayer in between. :D I still need to do some events on IA and almost all the events in the S class.

granturismo,37ude4,eric5949,1 point,Sun May 31 10:21:43 2015 UTC,"A bigger career mode would be nice. I also love the GT Academy and seasonal events. I like the mix of career mode qualities and online qualities in both those events.    I also think career mode is too easy and money is too easy to get. But I remember when I first started playing GT3, it took me two years to get my super license. That last Super License test around Monaco seemed insane at the time. I recently tried it again and got it on the 3rd try. So I don't blame Polyphony for keeping the game accessible to people who haven't been playing for decades. Remember, millions of copies of GT are sold and only 80k (if that) get gold in the seasonal event time trials. My dad, who I suspect is a marginally above average GT player cannot pass the GT6 Super license tests. I don't mind that the learning curve stays fairly shallow to keep new people interested in the game, I just wish there were more seasonal events and GT academy type events for more advanced players.  Most people I suspect do buy the game to drive a Ferrari and aren't super interested in spending hours in an Integra mastering turn 1 at Ascari--but we weirdos go nuts. Since we weirdos make up a minority of Polyphony's revenue, I don't tend to rip them too hard on the money side  I was a big fan of qualifying and grid starts and would like to see those come back. That said, the current way of racing  has made me much better at passing. Until GT5 I couldn't trail brake around the outside to pass in a corner; it was either on the inside or it wasn't happening. So it cuts both ways I guess.  TLDR We're diehards and should accept that GT needs to stay accessible. Let's hope the PS4 will give Polyphony more freedom to be all things to all people."
granturismo,37ude4,henryshock,1 point,Sun May 31 03:52:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess you’re right …  Yesterday I finally did the iA license in GT6 (i didn’t bother to until now) and in some tests I easily got Gold at the first try knowing I could be at least a second quicker if I tried a second or third time.  That was almost as frustrating as don’t getting the license back then in GT1."

I couldn't stop thinking about it for a whole week after.  I also tried the goggles with Elite:Dangerous, a Milky Way space simulator, and it was just so breathtaking, the asteroids appear in your vision, that are larger than life. you pivot your head AND your eyes, to see around in your virtual cockpit. with dials and controls and switches at your disposal.  I have yet to try a car game with it, but I and tens of millions of other gaming enthusiasts will be on board with VR for GT7 and more, for sure.  it is revolutionizing gaming , simply because the hardware necessary to run it adequately, is finally upon us.  You know when a giant such as Samsung is throwing tens of billions in R&D to release this product to market, it is really happening, and no longer a fad.  it is also going to change a lot of business practices, not just games. virtual reality shopping, porn (yes I said it, in the trillions of dollars), medical, and fitness too.   the Nintendo Wii tried to get us off the couch with their Wii controllers.

granturismo,37luwd,kilogttam,2,Thu May 28 16:41:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it will work fine. They wouldn't of even tried for VR if it was close to impossible. The Google Cardboard just uses your phone and works pretty well and I am sure a PS4 will be much better. Not to mention they can add computer power to the headset itself to help with any extra stuff it needs. I think it actually has a small external box that is uses. I forget where I saw it, but I remember a Sony guy talking about it.   Samsung and Oculus have a new headset coming out that uses phones as the screen and power, but the have included more ram amongst other things in the headset to help the phone be even better also."

granturismo,37luwd,IamAnthonological,1 point,Thu May 28 16:47:43 2015 UTC,Its not hard to make a game VR Compatible the hard part [in the PS4's case] is rendering the same image twice for every frame. and that's why i would doubt VR will be a nice experience on PS4.   1Hz = 1FPS by the way.
granturismo,37luwd,kilogttam,1 point,Thu May 28 16:54:49 2015 UTC,"The PS4 only has to render the two images at 960x1080p each, which is half the size of an ordinary 1080p image. As Killzone 3 and Uncharted 3 show, you don't even have to half the resolution to make rendering the image twice feasible. Combine that with Killzone Shadow Fall's temporal reprojection method and the Morpheus' ability to interpolate frames, and you could easily have regular PS4 games running at 1080p 120fps VR."

granturismo,37luwd,QuiteKid,4,Thu May 28 16:49:34 2015 UTC,"The only problem the PS4 has is rendering VR at 90+ fps. However, Sony has preemptively solved this by including an interpolation chip with the Morpheus' HDMI splitter box. This means that every game will appear to run at 120fps. So no, the Morpheus is completely feasible, even with AAA games like Project CARS."
granturismo,37luwd,IPeeInGirlsButtholes,1 point,Thu May 28 17:43:40 2015 UTC,"Do yourself a favor next time and do some quick Googling   Over the next coming months you’ll be seeing a regular blog here on PlayStation Blog that’ll be diving deeper into more details of the game – cars and tracks, career mode, online modes, social and community features, and a special feature on Project Morpheus.  That’s right, Project CARS will be one of the first games on PS4 to support virtual reality via the Project Morpheus headset."
granturismo,37luwd,kilogttam,1 point,Thu May 28 16:53:16 2015 UTC,Despite all the software magic sony claims to have I'm going to need to see this in person before I believe that the ps4 is capable of convincing VR outside of minigames and demos. The hardware requirements are heavy. Interpolation is ok and it does help but you simply cannot fake frame rendering. It will judder when you're steering left and suddenly pull right because the fake frames were already drawn before the input happened.  Interpolation is not a magic savior. It is a massive crutch for the hardware that I hope they overcome. GT is really fun.

granturismo,37fgqk,smeisinger,1 point,Fri May 29 15:55:17 2015 UTC,The only downside (for me) to using the interior view is that occasionally it will have a bad lag and the steering animation lags too.
granturismo,37fgqk,happysealND,1 point,Fri May 29 21:34:55 2015 UTC,"I have no problem at all with standard cars. Of course interiors are nice and all, but I drive in bumper vie anyways, so I don’t really care.  Some of the textures look dated, yes, but so what?"
granturismo,37fgqk,dumkopf604,1 point,Sat May 30 14:01:40 2015 UTC,I feel that for a lot of repeated vehicles such as the r33/r34 skylines  theres only one model with a detailed interior this is somewhat annoying as I dont  believe it can change too much between different variants of the car and if I wanted to buy one variant as opposed to the other of the same car only one has the detailed view.

Down the road, after Kaz signed the collaboration with FIA, he also announced a FIA Championship for this spring and it didn't happened. Anyway, the Course Maker is still on the GT6 presentation webpage as to be included in a future update. My feeling (and I could be wrong) is that this update will be about those 2 cars and the GT Academy program, with the 4th stage and, probably, a new track (Abu Dhabi?)."

granturismo,37cbvh,StatuSChecKa,3,Tue May 26 16:10:34 2015 UTC,I don't think so. What I do is look at the course information and see how long the longest straight is. If it's around .5 miles then I usually tune for around 180-250 depending on power and nitrous.

Then do all 5 races tomorrow.  Maybe I'll practice in a room so random people could drop in.   Driver Errors in Brands Hatch is the only reason. I placed 4th in the Championship!

granturismo,37795o,nocnoc94,7,Mon May 25 13:29:10 2015 UTC,"Are you using the clutch with the shifter?  The clutch recognition in Gran Turismo is terrible, but I have never had issues with it not realizing it's in gear.   As far as going into neutral in between gears, that's kind of what it's supposed to do :P"
granturismo,37795o,Chronner420,1 point,Mon May 25 13:44:20 2015 UTC,"I guess it takes some getting used to. Feels very different from the gear box of a real car, and the clutch has no feedback too."
granturismo,37795o,SteveSharpe,5,Mon May 25 15:06:13 2015 UTC,"This is a problem with Gran Turismo more than the G27. The game basically doesn't recognize the clutch unless you press it all the way down to 100%, cleanly shift gears, and then release entirely. It's basically a binary operation and any slight alteration like beginning your shift as the clutch is still slightly above 100% pressed will cause it to just throw into neutral.   Essentially the clutch is useless on this game. If you don't ever use the clutch, the H shifter will work fine without it. But if you ever press the clutch at all, it will then be required for the rest of the race or you'll get the neutral."
granturismo,37795o,StatuSChecKa,3,Mon May 25 14:55:51 2015 UTC,Please note that you can get out of Cluch Mode by paddle shifting. Then you can go right back to H Patten with no clutch.
granturismo,37795o,Justskate11,1 point,Mon May 25 21:25:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's quite annoying in a race, makes me lose seconds. I'll still keep playing with the clutch though because it makes the game so much more fun and immersive. Was previously a ds3 player."
granturismo,37795o,Justskate11,1 point,Mon May 25 15:08:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I've been using it for a few hours and I've gotten a lot better with it, using the paddles would be a lot easier but I think the GT AI in career mode is easy enough to beat by a margin of a few seconds usually.  The thing is that I'm working towards a license and using the gear box mostly for fun but also for practice for quick shifting. It would be great if future gaming clutches could have force feedback."

granturismo,36zri8,refrigeratorbob,0,Sat May 23 18:37:05 2015 UTC,"If you want to get rid of the friends lines you will need to sign out of PSN and login in again after finishing your best lap, without exiting the event... It is a little tricky... That ghost is not his.. It is one of the fastest times (top 10) loaded in the game as a rabbit. If you look on the right top corner of his screen, the ghosts time is 2,07.5xx, which is more than a second of what he is achieving... He only needs the ghost as a reference point - breaking, lines and acceleration."
granturismo,36zri8,jocker12,4,Sat May 23 18:53:42 2015 UTC,If you want to get rid of friends lines can't you just push up on D-pad on wheel as the event starts?  That's how I do it.

granturismo,36zri8,Fraugheny,1 point,Sun May 24 12:53:05 2015 UTC,I can't race with ghosts unless they are behind me. Which defeats the purpose
granturismo,36zri8,refrigeratorbob,5,Sat May 23 18:59:44 2015 UTC,"He tries to stay as close as possible (for as long as possible) to the ghost. During time trials, you can judge the lines, the braking and the acceleration and understand what the top players are doing. Once you admit you won't be faster, you can use the ghost in your advantage and try to rectify your mistakes. The only problem is towards the end of the lap, because if you are too far away, you won't be able to learn, so the main goal is to push at the beginning and imagine a ""rubber band"" between you and the the ghost. I totally understand what you are saying. Too me, the most annoying are the lines, because they also have the player name on top at the track surface level, and you cannot see the next turn at all. If there are cones, those are covered by the name too. Fortunately, I am fast and I do not have that problem."

Some quick googling suggest the Momo Racing Force Feedback works with GT6. It is not a problem that it lacks a clutch pedal. Most low-end wheels do. The clutch functionality in Gran Turismo games is not that good from what I heard (acts almost like an on/off switch), unless it's been fixed lately.  I have been playing both GT5 and GT6 with a Logitech Driving Force GT (official Gran Turismo wheel) which also doesn't have clutch. I have beaten both games including both platinum trophies with it so you definitely won't need a clutch.  I think using the clutch would slow you down anyway, and in GT Academy you need all the speed you can get. Expect some fierce competition."

granturismo,36v495,NitroXIII,1 point,Sat May 23 09:32:08 2015 UTC,"It works in GT6? I guess that's why. I raced against that guy in that tournament he was super fast, won almost every race. My setup ran 0 camber as well and when I sent it to my teammates it shaved seconds off their lap-times. Obviously, the 0 Camber wasn't the most important thing to making the tune fast, but it definitely isn't necessary to add Camber to go faster in this game."

Also, bouncing the car over the kerbs will be tricky, while spinning the rears. Notice how some of the drivers will miss braking points, crashing in front of you, so be ready for evasive driving using alternate racing lines.

granturismo,36qqgc,buuhuu,2,Sat May 23 05:19:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, I have a question about this...   I've purchased a 905b, and put intermediate (IM) tires on it, and set it to ""push the pace,"" but it's seems to be struggling to get out of 16th place in this race.   Did you mean ""put the intermediates on the TS030""?   If so, which tires do you run on the 905B for this race?"
granturismo,36qqgc,Shmogt,3,Fri May 22 17:18:20 2015 UTC,"No, I definitely run IMs on the 905B. Even leaving softs on, it'll still run happily, then default back to IMs when it pits, so it was probably redundant info. It's probably enough to have the IMs in your inventory, so it has the option available to it.  As to why you're not progressing... I'm not sure. I'm gonna do some experiments, setting my tune back to default and see what happens. It bums me that it's not working for you.  Edit: the things I do for you. I purchased a brand new stock 905B. All I did was lower the tune enough to hit the 650PP limit, and buy IMs. 2 minutes into the race, and it's up to 7th. Stay tuned.  Edit 2: 5 minutes in, and the 905B takes the lead on Kesselchen. 2 and a half lonely laps to go.  Edit 3: The 905B wins comfortaly by 47 seconds, with a GT-r R35 Touring Car taking second. (I mention this because the results are tighter when the BMW McLaren is in the field. Still, it usually takes the lead before the end of the first lap and wins by 30+ seconds.)  This has me baffled. Theories? The b-spec driver performs relative to your experience, perhaps? How many stars do you have? I have them all. Could that be the difference?   How often have you raced Nurburgring? Could there be machine learning at work here? I know when Nordschleife was the seasonal event, I really spammed that track. Like, hard. 50 million credits hard.   OK, next experiment: I'll start a brand new profile and try it. It might take a while to afford the 905B. I'll get back to you."
granturismo,36qqgc,DishRags,1 point,Sat May 23 02:24:22 2015 UTC,"Holy crap man. You're totally awesome!  It worked. I was impatient when I saw that it was still in 16th place after only watching for 5 minutes. It slowly worked itself up to first place and won the race.  Thanks for going through all of the trouble to check that out for me. I really appreciate it!  On another note, which typically wins the race first, the 905B or the TS030?  Also, will the computer automatically change the tire type for you in a race if it notices the conditions change, or do you always have to do it manually?    I mean, I'll put IM's on the car for the start, but if it drys out on the track when the car goes to box, will it switch to RM's or RS's automatically?"
granturismo,36qqgc,Shmogt,1 point,Sun May 24 17:58:41 2015 UTC,"Oh thank heavens for that! I didn't fancy working my way up to Super licence again. ;)  There's not a huge difference between the 905B and the TS030 in Nurburgring 24. The 905B was about 5 seconds faster in the quick test I did, but you'd have to take a larger sample size to get a better idea, since getting stuck behind slow drivers, etc, can really make a difference in lap times.  Watching the AI drivers in the live timing screen, they start with a mix of hard and medium, but all change to IMs and wets by the end of the first lap (and the IM drivers hold most of the top positions). At the end of the second lap. most have changed back to hards, except a handful (the top 4, including my driver) who stuck with IMs. There's a BIG gap between these guys, and the others who stopped to pit.  This tells me two things: yes, the AI drivers will change their tyres to suit conditions, and IMs remain the best choice for this race. It's certainly not worth the extra pit stop to change. Maybe if PD ever introduce REAL endurance racing, tyre choice will become a real strategic decision. As it stands, there's not much in it."

granturismo,36lt6a,ImCummingOniiChan,3,Wed May 20 13:25:01 2015 UTC,"Shelby '64,  Ruf RGT '00,  Italia 458,  Mazda LM55 (5:55 around the Nurb at safe speed)  and surprisingly the Cobra '67, this car is very very good in GT6, unlike the oversteering deamon it used to be in GT5  I hope PD releases a car pack before we wait another 18 months for GT7 to finally appear..  I do suspect however, that GT7 will be nothing short of beautiful."
granturismo,36lt6a,Bane,3,Wed May 20 15:13:34 2015 UTC,"Handling and control seem distinct to me, yet similar, depending. Well here's a list of my favorites that I really enjoy driving.   FF: Honda Integra DC5 (facelift)... doesn't give me the usual FF annoyances, despite having the same issues in the end due to the laws of physics. FR: Mazda RX-7 Spirit R... honestly, perfection, rather like the next car. The BR-Z/GR-86 are also very excelent, and so enjoyable to drive, but they honestly can take a lot more power and be absolutely fine. The RX-7 has something about it that I can't resist. MR: Honda NSX Type R (facelift)... perfection in a car, in all important aspects, but a very different flavor to the RX-7. Will still exhibit MR tendency but it's hard to reach that unpleasant place. Surprisingly slideable. F/4WD: Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X... uncanny at times but extremely capable. M/4WD: Ford RS200 (road car)... it gets tricky at a certain point. Backwards R35 drivetrain but without all that mass. Questionable 1980's technology and engineering, thankfully the vehicle does not come with too much power, it'd not be out of place in the JDM market of certain dates, lol... Racecar: Honda HSV-010... it's generally excellent and easy to drive, in my opinion. Still teaches you about aero and grip for racecars though, and will turn nasty if provoked and not kept within it's requirements. Personal favourite: Nissan Silvia S15 spec-R Aero (facelift) with suspension tuned exactly to my taste, but I'd say there's better FR for handling stock. Any car can  likely become your favourite handling if you put enough time into it, and it then becomes a perfect extension and expression of yourself. I'm in love with what I made this car."
granturismo,36lt6a,vbaeri,1 point,Wed May 20 17:47:00 2015 UTC,"Quite a good list, gonna try them all out soon. Have you tried the Furai? It has a very nice turning circle and exits corners beautifully."

granturismo,36lt6a,ImCummingOniiChan,1 point,Fri May 22 10:15:08 2015 UTC,"I personally think the Honda Civic Type R '08 is better than the Integra but a tad bit harder to tune (I have one posted, check my reddit profile)  And the Subarus and GTRs make for better 4WDs with better predictability and thus consistency than the Evo X."
granturismo,36lt6a,Saadatoad,2,Sat May 23 14:50:30 2015 UTC,Subaru IMPREZA GT300. It has big race car grip with little race car power. Wonderfully easy to drive quickly.

granturismo,36lt6a,flacocaradeperro,2,Wed May 20 13:20:51 2015 UTC,Well I used the Ferrari GTO '84 for the second season of /r/RGTRC a few months ago. It's pretty quick around the corners and generally responds well.
granturismo,36lt6a,iwanttobearockstar,2,Wed May 20 13:54:41 2015 UTC,McLaren MP12C is best.
granturismo,36lt6a,gorosaurs,2,Wed May 20 16:20:42 2015 UTC,"A delicately balanced AE86 has all the right sort of FR characteristics and is a delight to drive, I use it to memorize course layouts by going over and over and over without getting tired at all. On comfort soft tires, 160 or so HP, short ratios and a good tune... no car can match it for ease of driving and overall delight.  Whether or not it will win races in it's performance class...is not likely, unless you focus very hard and have good skill."
granturismo,36lt6a,flipjj,2,Sat May 23 14:52:57 2015 UTC,Personally i like S2000 they have a very wide range of tuning capabilities from ae86 eater to Bugatti raper

granturismo,35uunq,foxden_racing,7,Thu May 14 13:37:36 2015 UTC,"I stand by the post I made a couple weeks ago.  PDI have to step up their game for 7, or they're at risk of becoming irrelevant, not being able to draw more than the already-diehard.    GT6 has the best lobby control system of any racing game I've ever played, but does a terrible job of getting its players emotionally invested.  What I mean by that...compare to Forza, where they've got full RGB/HSL control over paint colors, a full livery editor, and piles upon piles of customization options.  I know it's not Kaz's thing, and that's fine...but GT has to do something to make it so that the stuff sitting in the garage isn't a car, it's your car.  Similar can be said for the event list.  I'd love it to be maybe twice its current size [Forza's 1200+ races is a little obscene], but more importantly to force more variety.  When I can finish the game with ~40 cars in my garage, having never driven at least 25 of them, that's a huge missed opportunity.  Push me out of my comfort zone, force me to get to know more cars, and that comes with creative race restrictions rather than the same tired ""XXXPP, normal, YYY tires"" race in and race out.  And the AI.  For the love of all that's holy, the AI needs to stop being an opponent and move closer towards being individuals.  I could live with having only a pool of 30 AI drivers, if it meant each one had their own personality, car preference, would attack/defend, and had the ability to hold grudges.  I don't want to spend the race chasing down a car, I want to shout the other driver's name in rage when it beats me.  I want to run in the middle of a pack, not have the field fan out into a single-file procession that only changes if the car behind is far superior to the one in front of it.  If that's the kind of stuff they're workign on...then it'll be worth the wait.  If it's rushed because PDI is out of money, Sony needs its answer to FM6 [which will be the 2nd one on that system, thanks to their 'every 2 years, set your clock by it' release cycle], or delayed because they're working on something goofy like making pit crew members smile or frown in response to their pit stop performance, then I'm gonna lose heart."
granturismo,35uunq,Sterling_____Archer,4,Thu May 14 04:36:44 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly agree with everything you've posted, Forza has managed to catch up and pass GT in terms of emersion. The paint shop has been one of the greatest additions to the franchise and it has allowed players to really branch out with their creativity. Pairing this with extensive modification options and great communication between players and Turn 10, Forza has become hard to beat.  I'm just worried that Kaz is still stuck in his ways when it comes to the current state of Gran Turismo. As you said, PD has been teetering the last two games (this isn't to say that GT5 or GT6 are bad), and many fans have been annoyed that their complaints and criticisms have fallen on deaf ears. If GT7 doesn't live up to the expectations, Sony could start to look elsewhere for a exclusive racing sim.  That all being said, PD did get one of Turn 10's audio engineers, so at least one of the biggest complaints is being addressed. If we got better sounds and a paint shop, I think we'd at least be stepping in the right direction. I love both Forza and GT, and GT2 is My Favourite Game (Sorry.) but god do I want GT7 to be good."

granturismo,35uunq,foxden_racing,1 point,Thu May 14 13:40:03 2015 UTC,"Totally disgree that Forza is the competition PD should be worrying about. I also find it ironic that while you sing the praises of Turn 10 that FM5 was one of the most blatant cash grabs I can think of in recent history, cutting features and restricting content in order to have a game ready at launch."
granturismo,35uunq,REsoleSurvivor1000,3,Thu May 14 22:23:17 2015 UTC,"They've both got their strengths and their weaknesses, but I dare you to find a place where I've praised 5.  The franchise as a whole is useful as an apt comparison...the flagship sims on either system....and FM4 vs GT6 fits as the final iteration on their respective competing systems.  PDI doesn't have to be T10, but there are some things GT could learn from FM.  And vice-versa...I could write a post as long as the one above just fawning over GT6's lobbies.  All I'm saying is they risk being forgotten, or leaving the door wide open for a hungry upstart, if PDI doesn't do anything more than keep on keeping on."
granturismo,35uunq,ColloidMan5000,1 point,Fri May 15 01:47:52 2015 UTC,"While FM5 is a cash-grabby title I still believe that 3, 4 as well as the Horizon series deserve credit.

From their product description the bungee cord mechanism offers 'linear resistance'. This I would not recommend if you're serious into racing simulation as force feedback offers you the advantage of some feeling between the contact from your tires to the ground. I bought the G27 from Amazon for about $230 brand new, however you may find some used ones in your area on craigslist perhaps for about $120-150."

Having an absolute blast with it and feel its a great way to get your feet wet without spending a ton of money.

granturismo,35uz1m,brad1242,1 point,Thu May 14 15:03:46 2015 UTC,"I would only purchase this if it was cheaper than a controller. While it's still an upgrade, it's not worth twice the cost of something which uses the same basic resistance method.   For $130, I would purchase a Driving Force GT.   If you play more than 15 hours a week on average, I would forego the Driving Force GT, and just buy a Logitech G27, which is definitely worth the $220 cost (Amazon)."
granturismo,35uz1m,Sterling_____Archer,1 point,Thu May 14 17:53:55 2015 UTC,"I had a Thrustmaster Red Legend with the bungee system I picked up on clearance for $30 (regular $80). It worked well enough, but after about 10 months of racing every other day for a few hours, the bungee started getting looser and looser. Now it's tight like an old Lincoln.  I found a Logitech G25 on Craiglist for $75, it's not as quiet and smooth as the G27 but it gets the job done and is WAYYY better than anything bungee based. Also since everyone wants the G27 you can find the G25 on ebay and such for like $100.  IMO that's the way to go."

Pcars feels like it's a bit less forgiving than GT, and I like it that way. But it's close in my opinion. I don't remember if you could turn off the blinking gear indicator in GT, but it made it too easy in my opinion. In Pcars there's no such thing, which makes it better to me.  The sound is certainly better than GT, I especially enjoy the lack of the trademark tire screeching from GT. That said, it isn't perfect, for instance the SLS AMG sounds pretty bad in Pcars in my opinion, very artificial and not like a real engine. I'd say it's a bit inconsistent.  The career mode is a bit odd in my opinion, I know not everyone likes the classic car and mode unlocking, but without it it can get a bit unmotivating, but that's up to personal preference. You don't need to complete certain challenges to progress, so it doesn't really feel like a robust career mode to me.   The cars feel great and really different from each other, and especially with a wheel you'll get the most out of it.  If you just like a great driving feel and challenging races, I'm sure you'll love it. The AI feels a lot better than GT, but I don't have enough experience of that yet to speak about it. Personally, I enjoyed the career style of GT (excluding the grinding) and mostly just drive on Nordschleife, although some other tracks are fun too, like Brands Hatch. I don't enjoy the dreary flat tracks like Snetterton or Silverstone, but there should be enough tracks for most to get enjoyment out of it. What I would enjoy would be a challenge system like GT where you have to complete a certain course with a predefined car in a certain time, or difficult achievements like completing the Nordschleife under 7:29 with the GT-R like in GT5. Giving you all the cars and tracks to play with is cool in a way, but for me personally it just gets a bit dull after a while. I still like the game though, and I don't think you'll regret it if you buy it."

granturismo,35edoy,powerism_,5,Sat May 16 02:38:03 2015 UTC,"I've had about 3 hours with the game (at a friends place, didn't yet get it for myself but will).  It feels great. Begrudgingly I'm gonna say - it feels even better than GT. It's like you're driving a real car - you'll have to master each one before you plan on winning any races (with assists off).   So if pure racing is what you want - this is THE game to get. Until GT7 comes out and doesn't disappoint and is the best game ever.  However, if you're also into car collecting aspect of GT6 - it's absent. ~60 something cars is all what you get, but mastering each one can keep you occupied for hundreds of hours."

I haven't tested changing the seating angle.
granturismo,35edoy,found-a-universe,1 point,Mon May 11 10:31:14 2015 UTC,"So if pure racing is what you want - this is THE game to get. Until GT7 comes out and doesn't disappoint and is the best game ever.   Polyphony Digital are going to have a lot of trouble making the game look good while maintaining a 60Hz frame rate. Let's hope they don't have to resort to horizontal upscaling this generation.  Project Cars on PS4 uses a form of frame interpolation similar to TVs that turn 30Hz content into 60Hz with a motion interpolation chip. Killzone Shadow Fall multiplayer renders at 960x1080 and deinterlaces to achieve a 1920x1080 frame.  The Last of Us Remastered reduces dynamic shadow resolution to maintain a 60Hz frame rate. Nothing in Left Behind scared me because every time I saw blocky shadows I knew a coffin or something was going to open. If the shadows were high resolution I knew the scene was static and I wasn't going to receive an ""unexpected scare"".  The car models in Project Cars on the PS4 are built from a maximum of 60,000 triangles. With PC on Ultra it is up to 300,000: Face-Off: Project Cars. Also ""cube-map reflections (as seen in puddles or on a car's bonnet) run equivalent to the lowest resolution possible on PC.""  The Achilles hell of the PS4 is its slow CPU. Single cores run at 1.6GHz with no boost clock. Instructions per clock are significantly lower than Intel and the cores are only running at one third the speed of an enthusiast's desktop CPU.  My budget ""Pentium Dual-Core"" laptop CPU from ~2008 has faster single core performance than the PS4."
granturismo,35edoy,found-a-universe,2,Mon May 11 11:24:32 2015 UTC,I have it on PC. While Project Cars is an astonishing technical achievement I find it is virtually unplayable with an XBOX 360 controller. Even with steering sensitivity set to zero I cannot keep a supercar in a straight line. Controller input is so twitch sensitive that I overcorrect.  The game supports a vast array of input devices but doesn't even acknowledge that the exceptionally popular XBOX 360 controller exists. The closest input device one can choose is an XBox One controller.  I hope others don't share my experience.
granturismo,35edoy,found-a-universe,2,Sun May 10 13:40:33 2015 UTC,"To update my parent comment, it turns out controller input was never tested on consoles either! This Xbox One console Controller Configuration Guide equally applies to PC.  Steering sensitivity is ridiculous: ""The current sensitivity is very high. I run this at '0' and would ideally run it at '-10' if I could.""  Fortunately there is a Speed Sensitivity setting which does the exact opposite of what you might expect. The HIGHER the number the LESS sensitive steering is at speed. At setting 100 you can hardly deviate from a straight line at speed.  With Controller Input Mode 3, a Steering Sensitivity of 0 and a Speed Sensitivity around 70 the game may be reasonably playable with a controller.  It seems odd developers would release a console car simulation without rigorously play testing controller support but there you go.  I would NOT recommend buying this game without first personally testing controller input. Polyphony Digital has put many years of effort into optimising controller input which regrettably still makes Gran Turismo 6 the better controller-based game at this point in time. Quality control matters."
granturismo,35edoy,Buck-O,1 point,Mon May 11 02:26:19 2015 UTC,"There are so many things about this game that are completely fucked. Their testing phase was an absolute joke, and they pulled a lot of bullshit with their testing community during the process.  Long story short, if you criticized the development in anyway, commented about the game negatively, or even so much as insinuated that there was something ""off"" in the games simulation, you would get banned from the forum, and subsequently booted from the testing program. Literally, if you didn't stroke the devs ego, you were gone. Even for asking something so ""terrible"" as inquiring as to why the cars porpussed on flat sections, and how the terrain mesh differed from the visual one.  And to make matters worse, some people got some pretty flippant responses back from the devs regarding their bans, and why they were banned. Basically telling them that if they don't like the way the game is being done...tough.  It all comes as a bit pathetic, especially after all the hype, and all of the work that went into it by third party individuals."

I'm still disappointed in some of the graphics,  cars look great though there's texture pop in in replays just about like GT6 has but the project cars graphics look better and more track side details very detailed interiors. pretty low quality textures on track though. As far as the feel...it's probably the best I've ever played. Very realistic handling, getting out of control feels pretty cool actually. I set it to pro or something then added ABS and traction control I think it's at 8 % and the AI is between70 and 80. The AI is pretty fun and much better matched I think.  I Iove the helmet cam and all the graphic settings available. They need to work on the replays though. That's my favorite part, re-watching my races. So far Gran Tourismo still is king in that department in my opinion."

granturismo,35h1w3,kilogttam,2,Sun May 10 09:37:43 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the technical jargon but the PS3 was jailbroken via the USB ports through some exploit, the changes made to the PS4 better prohibits such a thing but as a result older USB peripherals lack a certain security chip to function. That's the laypersons summary anyway."
granturismo,35h1w3,brad1242,1 point,Mon May 11 23:35:19 2015 UTC,"Close but not quite. I pieced this together from posts on logitech support, PS4 support, and GT support forums; in order for a peripheral to be recognized by the PS4, the PS4 needs to have direct explicit access provided for a specific peripheral by Sony (i.e. in a software update), or it needs to contain the security chip that verifies that it's a 1st party / approved peripheral. Some of the Fanatec wheels that are compatible with PCars on the PS4 were made ~2009 and couldn't have had the proprietary chip, Sony has just granted compatibility access for these. So basically, it IS possible for Logitech / Sony to add support for the wheels, I'm just thinking its a $$$$$ issue... its basically a big ""fuck you"" from Sony and Logitech"
granturismo,35h1w3,kilogttam,1 point,Thu May 14 15:16:35 2015 UTC,"Well Logitech has expressed that they have no interest in returning to the wheel market or supporting their old/discontinued products so I cant help but think that if they did want ps4 support they could get it, so perhaps its not quite a fuck you from Sony."
granturismo,35h1w3,brad1242,1 point,Thu May 14 16:03:42 2015 UTC,"Valid point.. Just saying if Fanatec support was added to PS4, it should be technically possible to add Logitech support without the so-called security chip...

granturismo,357nb7,foxden_racing,3,Fri May 8 12:21:59 2015 UTC,"It could be the laser having trouble reading the dual-layer disc.  Mine does this too.  If that is, in fact, the problem, there is a work-around.  When putting the disc into the system, hold the system upright (so that the disc slot is facing straight up).  For some reason, it will register the disc then, and after you get to the first loading screen, you should be able to put it back down again (gently), and it will continue to work.  I don't know why it works, but it works for me."

Nothing was more awkward than driving an electric car and have its ""whine"" echo in the tunnel on bernese alps. I had a gen1 Mazdaspeed3 two years ago, and what forza presented as absolute not even close sound. The car also doesn't have an extreme exaggerating sound stock. I hated that about forza.  GT sounds may be pushed as the worst, but the one thing GT has done right is that the positioning of the car in the area matchs in a way. The position on the car in replays also makes sense."

I've always assumed you want to lower the car a few ""ticks"" above bottom and increase spring rate, shocks, and turn off stabilizers. I'm honestly open to suggestions because I'm working on a trial and error basis at this point. Most race cars seem to have a low-medium spring rate and a relatively high ride height, at least when viewed on the adjustment scale (where you tune the suspension on fully customizable)."

granturismo,34cke1,tot_coz2,6,Thu Apr 30 01:42:41 2015 UTC,Dont watch the top replay. Look for wolf-aono (i think) he is smooth and clean. Watch at every corner the brake point turn in point where he crosses at the apex and where he drives out to on the exit. Now go do a lap and purposly go slow trying to hit all those points. Try to get no faster than 2:25 but do it cleanly. Then go slightly faster. You'll quickly realize that on a couple corners that by slowing down this much you will be faster. The high speed right handers are a good example of that. If you slow down enough to take the right line you'll be faster. As you work your way back up to where you were never sacrifice your line always sacrifice your speed and you'll get there in no time.
granturismo,34cke1,angrymachinist,4,Thu Apr 30 07:28:20 2015 UTC,"I'm a 2:08, no where near the top 250, so I'm not going to try and give driving advice on this. What I did was watch the  top replays to see where people are braking and starting their turn ins around corners. This helped me take a few seconds off almost immediately. Also don't feel too bad. The last time I watched a top replay, the guy was downshifting to first early while braking to lock up the brakes or something like that. It works in game, but redlining in first to slow down isn't my idea of a great way around the track in real life. Silverstone is tough. It was one of my worst tracks for a while, because those high speed wide turns are very ambiguous.   TL;DR Watching others' replays helped me."

granturismo,34cke1,3rdone,3,Thu Apr 30 03:19:23 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you on using the handbrake as a method to get round the corner, that's just lame. The problem with the GTR is it does have a lot of understeer so you need to get the car moving around to compensate to make the car pitch into the corner. One thing I've been doing is on setting  up for a corner, I try and clip the rumble strip on the left (of a right hand bend) just to upset the car a little so it starts going into a  four wheel drift. Get this right and you can shave seconds off your lap time especially on the long straights as you carry much more speed.  This is how I like to challenge myself without resorting to 'hacks'. I haven't hit every corner like this yet but I can tell you, when you do it right it's massively quick and very satisfying. :)"
granturismo,34cke1,seminolecichlid,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:08:23 2015 UTC,"I never thought about doing that. Sounds like an interesting method. I'm still wonder if this a real racing technique, but I can see how it will help in game. The quicker you can get that angle into the turn , the faster you can accelerate out of it. I'll have to try this in the next round and try to break 250"
granturismo,34cke1,seminolecichlid,2,Thu Apr 30 15:00:08 2015 UTC,I'm sure it isn't a real racing technique except for in the obvious rally and WRC.
granturismo,34cke1,seminolecichlid,2,Thu Apr 30 18:25:39 2015 UTC,"Alright I'll try passing on some advice. The turn before the longest straight is the most important. Silverstone has lots of long straights, so make sure before one of those that you position yourself to get on the gas as early as possible because you'll end up reaching a higher speed and covering more ground with that speed. Even if you have to sacrifice a little extra time going into a tight corner, it pays off getting a good angle going out of it.  This is where I learned a few things that helped me. I haven't finished the video yet but there is a lot of good basic theory in there https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQRmYMlmdqM"
granturismo,34cke1,seminolecichlid,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:26:54 2015 UTC,"Seems like a good thing to try. I'll see what I can do. Any comment on the understeer and how to counter it? I've tried over braking and then breaking the back end loose, but even that didn't help (thanks to /u/nEx944 in another thread)."
granturismo,34cke1,kilogttam,2,Thu Apr 30 03:42:58 2015 UTC,"I try to stay off the throttle from when I begin the turn until I hit the apex of the turn. Accelerating shifts the weight to the back of the car and off of the turning wheels, so it will turn sharper as long as you are off the gas. It just becomes a matter of learning when you know you're past that point when you should start accelerating again.   That's my amateur opinion on what to try. I know how you feel. I am used to driving FR cars, so GTRs always feel like they really understeer. I guess they are quick because they are on rails, and never really lose an traction/power to the ground. They are something I still have yet to master.."
granturismo,34cke1,kilogttam,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:41:10 2015 UTC,"So are you saying that I should treat it more as a higher powered FF car instead? Or just be more weary of the understeer and over-compensate in a way? Also, you're spot on with your assumption, I mainly use rear wheel drive or the occasional Subaru."
granturismo,34cke1,manlydishwasher,2,Thu Apr 30 12:19:40 2015 UTC,"I would take angrymachinist's advice. He's a few seconds quicker than me in RGTRC and seems to have a good strategy there. I certainly think it's worth learning that way rather than trying to do what the top people are doing now to get those times. Back when I did my lap the top time was very smooth and apexes, rumble strips were hit perfectly etc. No cheating the system to shave that extra second off.   I'd follow angrymachinist's advice"
granturismo,34cke1,nEx944,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:57:56 2015 UTC,Are you using an automatic transmission? Because it's a lot easier and faster to throw it in a lower gear for a split second than brake hard enough to reach that gear at the right time.

I don't like to rely on that car all the time, but many times with these seasonals it seems there really is no other choice. Even with the ZZII, I had to cycle the lineup to get some favorable opponents. First run, there was a Zonda on poll, followed by another ZZII.  I managed 2nd, but was still nearly 5 seconds off the leader at the end. Second try started with a Buick Special on poll (I think the game felt sorry for me).  The real challenge in that lineup was a Saleen that started in 4th or 5th, who put up a serious fight (he ended up in 2nd place, 2 seconds behind me and 2 seconds in front of the 3rd place finisher).    I'd tried a few other cars first, but the closest I could get was 4th with my LCC Rocket (though with the Buick Special-led lineup I might have pulled off a narrow victory).

I overtook him on a corner and he just flew past me in the next. I pushed him into the left wall when we were in that tunnel halfway through the lap. That slowed him down enough for me to stay ahead and take the win. I was using a fully modded Honda HSC Concept car BTW. It's decently fast in the straights but performs beautifully around corners.
granturismo,33kgrh,pwoodg420,2,Thu Apr 23 06:25:13 2015 UTC,I would say the only advantage the T100 has over the G27 is PS4-compatibility.. unfortunately I think you'll find it's a step back in every other regard.

I've heard the T100 compared to the DFGT, it has less degrees of rotation but the FFB should be similar.. I think it'll satisfy you for the time being. And anything is better than reverting to a controller once you get used to a wheel."

granturismo,33fd3c,rokthemonkey,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:08:37 2015 UTC,Mercedes Sauber C9. It's amazing. I did have to pit (IIRC every 2 laps) but it was totally worth it. I don't remember the tire layout (been a while since I beat career) but I think I switched from racing soft to hard on the back wheels (they deteriorated faster case rear wheel drive).
granturismo,33fd3c,Thnito_Kyrios,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:28:49 2015 UTC,"The first dozen unsuccessful times the rocket car. Great around the turns but I didn't have enough on the straights. Also kept running out of gas on the last lap home stretch or my tires would go completely red and I'd flop around like a fish around the last set of corners.   After enough 2nd 3rd and 4th place finishes I bit the bullet and got the Gillet Vertigo race car. Took me a few tries but I finally got it, although it probably had more to do with new found track familiarity and timing the pit stops just right for certain tires and just enough gas. Also drafting and overtaking on the straights upwards of 240mph while blocking opponents in the rear view from doing the same. Making a mistake pretty much guaranteed a do over since it would inevitably be a split second loss. Ended up lapping the 2nd place car somehow due to them pitting two laps in a row and the timer running out before finish line so I didn't have to go around again. It was a perfectly run race, finally. And all I got was a lousy old audi rally car. Jk I love it"

granturismo,33fd3c,rick_mcdingus,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:25:42 2015 UTC,"I tried the Red Bull JR. I never could win with it at Spa. My fastest win at Spa was in the Mazda Vision GT--I think I only pitted once. I also like the Mazda for Nurburgring because the AWD seems to help in the rain. The Toyota TS030 and the three Toyota Race Cars on the last page (the red one, blue one, and white one) all worked fine for me too. Lots of people like the R18 and Delta Wing. And they are fast no doubt, but if you're already struggling to keep it on the track, and Spa is tough, choose an easier car to handle. I think the Mazda is the easiest to keep on the road."

The Pescarolo C60 Hybrid later got me far ahead of everyone in both 24 min challenges, lapping a few cars even. It's ""hybrid"" thing does nothing, but with the turbo and a tune it wrecks house.

granturismo,33ahuk,doubleaadogg,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:21:42 2015 UTC,"Haha, the exact same thing happened to me on a 24 hour race (it's probably even worse to throw the last race on a championship though).  Push it hard just seems to make the driver extremely reckless, it's like he nearly throws half the car off the side at the end of every turn, and every now and then he'll just drive off the road entirely. Even just today I did a 24 minutes of spa on the VGT Mazda, told him to push it hard and he completely drove off the track and smashed into the wall at one corner.  Push the pace makes him go a bit faster but not to the point where he's driving off the road and slamming into barriers."
granturismo,33ahuk,flipjj,2,Wed Apr 22 03:50:20 2015 UTC,The Mazda Vision Grand Turismo thing can win the 24 hr at Nurburgring. Just cancel its first pit.

Have bought all the expensive cars I wanted, now I'm back to buying stupid stuff and still have about 30 million credits.   Three possibilities: TS030, BMW GTR Race Car and the Audi Pikes Peak.  All of them are automatic, even if set to just push the pace (never tried the third setting). Just make sure the car has IM tyres, set and forget.  Also, the TS030 can win almost any race you can put it in for A-Spec. I used it extensively."
granturismo,33ahuk,Rathkeaux,2,Tue Apr 21 02:46:34 2015 UTC,"All of them are automatic, even if set to just push the pace (never tried the third setting). Just make sure the car has IM tyres, set and forget.   I actually already have the Audi Pikes Peak. Amazing car for A-Spec. Pardon the noobishness, but IM tyres? Is that ""Racing:Intermediate"", to goad the driver to not pit in adverse weather?  Sounds like the TS030 may be my next purchase. I still need to grind out iA events to unlock S, though."
granturismo,33ahuk,trixter192,2,Tue Apr 21 03:24:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, intermediate tyres. If you have full wets, the AI will pit again and it serves no purpose other than delay your win.  Start the race on racing softs, the AI will pit for IM and ride those to the end. If you are controlling the race, you can pit for softs again at the end of lap 2, but it doesn't really make a difference other than the car being able to push a bit more. Personally, I don't even touch the controller. I turn the TV off after setting it and go back in 30 minutes to collect the credits.   If you buy the TS030, you'll be able to use it for everything, it's that good. It can loose a drag race to other cars, but in fuel saving and tyre management, it's unbeatable, so you can keep going while the AI pits for new tyres/fuel. I use the tune by Praiano (easy to find on GTPlanet, if you can't find it let me know and I'll send it to you tomorrow) and it makes the car behave beautifully, although it come out of the garage driving very well already."
granturismo,33ahuk,flipjj,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:33:09 2015 UTC,"There is no need to do this, just buy the LCC Rocket, only but racing softs, tune it to 650pp and set to push the pace, it will never pit and always win."
granturismo,33ahuk,boostmastergeneral,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:31:08 2015 UTC,Just put the down force high and push very hard on intermediate tires.  Looks to be a 60 second lead when its over.
granturismo,33ahuk,Rathkeaux,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:24:45 2015 UTC,"Hmm, got any recommendations for a lower-PP car that the AI can handle well? I find that the TS030 gets smoked in lower PP events due to its starting low top speed, further hampered by the amount of power limiting and weight gain that PP management entails.  Something that tops out at 550PP would be nice."
granturismo,33ahuk,kukenjitsu,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:29:07 2015 UTC,"If the races have fuel and tyre consumption, tune the X-Bow R to 550 because it uses almost nothing, it's really unfair.  If there isn't consumption, the Shelby Cobra is insane (1.89 kg/hp ratio is pretty good in that 550 range) and the RUF Yellow Bird is also impressive (but I'm not sure how the AI will handle that car, because it takes some care to get it around the track)."

granturismo,3361tp,rbrtcnnll,4,Sun Apr 19 21:58:55 2015 UTC,"It's still listed as a future feature on the gran-turismo.com website:  Course Maker This feature, available at a later stage through an update, will allow you to create your own custom tracks that can be driven in the game. Additionally, in another update we will add the possibility to generate a track by capturing the GPS coordinate data of a mobile app while you are driving that course. These GPS-generated tracks will be available in the game as playable content.  So... Is it coming? If their website is to be believed, the answer is yes. Given that it's still on their website nearly a year and a half after the game was first released, I'd suspect there would be a fairly sizable class-action lawsuit if they reneged on that promise. I would imagine that PD would want to avoid something like that. Not only would it be a fairly substantial distraction for what is arguably a fairly small company, it would have a negative impact on future sales of GT7 & beyond, especially if they adopt the same 'minimum viable product' development model as they have with GT6."

granturismo,32ywkg,Guy_92,17,Fri Apr 17 21:36:17 2015 UTC,It's impossible to check speed.   Not necessarily some people will check the spectator view to see people's speeds and give people warnings if they are speeding. Some of the cop cars on track can make obvious predictions on whether someone is going over 60 or not.   What happens when people do speed?  Most lobbies will give 3 warnings before a Kick or you are made to change your Car.   Why would I want to drive my new car around a track at 60?  Some people (like myself) find it relaxing and threaputic to drive slowly and on the correct side of the road.  When every player does this it creates what you might deem as a normal driving expierence which you wouldn't normally get on GT. These lobbies also give you the chance to show of your cars to others and socialise in a less competitive enviroment.  How do I stay at a constant 60?  Watch the Speedometer.    Why's this a thing?  Maybe because 'Cops and Robbers' is a popular game type on the other games and people want to replicate that experience here.   For Cruising read the reasons above.  I know it might seem strange a game dedicated to racing and people choose to drive at 60. I also like the Competitive side to GT but sometimes its nicer to take it more slowly.
granturismo,32ywkg,Fattymagraw,2,Fri Apr 17 22:58:21 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to chuck in my take on these rooms on gt.  If you want to cruise and drive slowly on the correct side of the road etc etc, that's what gta is for and does it much better. Gt is a racing game, I go online to race people, not piss about at 60 mph. These rooms have become a pet peeve of mine because there's more of them and not enough proper racing rooms"
granturismo,32ywkg,Swinnyjr,2,Sat Apr 18 13:32:20 2015 UTC,I respect that and GTA is great for ordinary driving but you have to use fantasy cars which are similar but not legitimate.   It's also important to note that not everyone has GTA nor does it have a 'Cops and Robbers' game type as far as I know.   Also I'd say there are still more Racing lobbies over Cruising ones.
granturismo,32ywkg,Fattymagraw,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:33:42 2015 UTC,I understand the real cars element.  But in my experience gt has become cruising rooms/ drifting rooms/ drag racing at Indy and then one maybe two legit racing rooms once you've sifted through the above BS.
granturismo,32ywkg,Swinnyjr,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:56:53 2015 UTC,I thought there was a filter to block out cruise lobbies under the 'Race for Fun category' or the 'Let's Show of our Cars' or was that removed?

You will get it  eventually if you keep trying.  First of all, start off slow and just get a full lap down, its then easy to work off of that and improve on the difficult corners. I found it easier with all driving aids off and it takes time to get used to but it does mean you can go faster through some corners and shave off some seconds. If you know the track really well, try it with the HUD off, i find its easier to focus because I cant look at the lap time or the map."

One week it'll be 2 time trials and 2 drift events, the next it'll be 3 races.  Seasonal events typically give out a unique paint color on top of paying well, with special events coming up a couple times a year.  Over Christmas, they gave away over $20M in cash and almost $100M in cars through seasonal events.  For major endurance events they usually put up a celebratory event...the 24 of Le Mans and the 24 of Daytona both had events, which paid exceptionally well.  And the lobby system is incredible, better than any of the competition.  Anything but the race itself [free run, practice, qualifying, etc] is true drop-in drop-out.  Run the car, switch cars, tune cars, whatever, right from the lobby, and then go back to driving.  One thing that may get old, though, depending on whether you enjoy it or not is that almost every event is in a ""chase them down"" format...you start last, and because it's a rolling start you've gotta run the leader down.  I'm not sure the exact cause, but it's been reported that framerate goes through the floor when there's too many AIs clustered together, and they're not very good at pack racing to begin with."

granturismo,32vnu1,Guy_92,3,Fri Apr 17 02:22:13 2015 UTC,"Don't forget to snag the current VW while you're at it.  From a practical standpoint, get the Nissan first.  It can be made to qualify for a number of events, and has the grunt to pull it off.  The Aston was a wild ride and a ton of fun, but I haven't had much cause to use it.  650 is kind of an ugly duckling area for PP, especially for low-downforce cars...and it loses a lot of grunt being detuned down to 600 [the power limiter sits about 70%]  The Subaru didn't impress me.  The turning radius is somewhere between 'Oil Supertanker' and 'RMS Titanic' the instant you look at the throttle funny.  It's fine off-power, but the on-power understeer cannot be overstated.  Keep that in check, though, and it's a fun little car.  The Inifinity was...generally unremarkable.  Don't have anything positive to say about it, don't have anything negative to say about it, honestly barely even remember it.  It just sort of is.  Very similar to the Toyota, in that respect...it's a racing-spec FT1, not really much else to say about it.  If you're into WTFs, though...you have to get the Chapparal.  The Mazda is also not to be undersold...it usually can't be made to qualify for LMP seasonal events [PDI has a nasty habit of locking them to 2WD], but is a wicked little prototype that has no problems laying waste to its peers."

They used to capture in an open space, with the engine not under load...you can tell which cars were recorded that way because they sound fine while revving at a standstill, but still sound like they're revving at a standstill while moving.  Then they moved to moving under load, but that introduced wind noise into the sound samples, which makes the cars captured that way pretty obvious.  Lately they've been playing with a dyno setup like T10's been using since the beginning, but the first few Kaz wasn't happy about because the mics were picking up the sound of the rollers and reverberation in the room.

I even upgraded my whole entertainment setup with better speakers and borrowed a Fanatec BMW steering wheel setup when GT6 came out, and I gave up after a few months.  This clip just reminded me of why I gave up on the series, and sold my PS3."
granturismo,32gbgh,_____--_____,3,Mon Apr 13 18:36:09 2015 UTC,Are you seriously asking if its just you that has this opinion? Yeah a lot of the audio sucks but I personally am able to look past it and enjoy all the things that GT does have to offer.
granturismo,32gbgh,kilogttam,8,Mon Apr 13 20:32:49 2015 UTC,"I work in audio, so it's a big part of the immersion for me.  When I can hear the loop of the tire squeal repeating, or get distracted by the heavy-handed surround panning, it takes me out of the game.  Also, nothing gets me more excited to modify my cars and race than listening to ""The Entertainer"" and some light jazz.  :)  /s  For me, GT3 had the best music, sound effects, and overall vibe.  I played the hell out of that game."
granturismo,32gbgh,_____--_____,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:44:55 2015 UTC,"GT3 had pretty good sound samples, GT4 onward was when everything audio related started turning to crap."
granturismo,32gbgh,Onionsteak,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:56:41 2015 UTC,"The problems started with the implementation of 5.1 in the game.  If you set the audio to Large Theater in the sound options, the engine and tire sounds are MUCH better (particularly because of the much improved full frequency sound that is heavy on mid bass, and sub bass tones which are all but removed in the small speaker default settings), and if you have 5.1 (or greater) the immersion of those sounds is far more believable. Wit engine sounds coming from the right end of the car, etc.  The biggest overall change was a switch to procedural sounds that are generated, rather than simply sound clips of cars played in a loop. Personally, the sounds in Project Cars annoy the fuck out of me. I can hear the loop of every engine sound. ANd it makes it have this RRRRRRrrRRRRRRRrrRRRRRRRRrrRRRRRRrrrRRRRRRR kind of sound that is absolutely maddening to hear. Not to mention that the tonality change of variable throttle inputs is nonexistent as well. in every scenario but sitting at a dead stop revving the car.  While I might not completely ""enjoy"" the vacuum cleaner sound of the last couple GT games, I would much rather listen to a vacuum that responds to throttle input changes dynamically, and can be multichannel mixed per car, as long as it forgoes incessant looping sounds that are present in other games like P-Cars."
granturismo,32gbgh,Buck-O,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:31:28 2015 UTC,"I do have a nice 5.1 surround sound system and I keep the audio setup to large theater as well, PD have done surrounded sound well as you said (they did a stellar job in GT5 too), it helps but does not solve the problem.  Sound in Gt6 is a mixed bag, there are some cars that sounds decent when stock, probably because they are using the engine recording PD recorded from actual cars, but throw on an exhaust upgrade and often time it's ruined. You have to trade off performance for better audio samples which is silly. I almost wish there could just be an option to switch to whichever sound sample you think sound best. PD really need to expand their audio resources and change how they produce sound samples for modded cars."
granturismo,32gbgh,Onionsteak,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:39:16 2015 UTC,"People love to Complain, the sound isn't that bad,  it's got to be a huge task to get all the different cars sounding exactly like they do irl. The games does have its flaws,  but with over 300 hours played it's definitely the game that's satisfied   my gaming urge over the past year and a half.  Well done PD,  and of course GT7 will be much better than 6, and probably better than Pcars. Edit: 422.3 hours!"

I wonder what it is with assetto corsa vs gt6. Or even Iracing. I've never played Pcars tbh but I got tired of hearing the tire squeals of gt6 all the way around the damn track. Anybody a sound guy here? Please tell me that I'm not the only one who can hear the tire squealing loops over and over again.. I gave up on gt6 about a year ago.

granturismo,3276iu,ImCummingOniiChan,1 point,Sat Apr 11 15:55:59 2015 UTC,"Protip. Set your panning mode to mode 2 for straights, and mode 3 for corners. This setting is shown when you hit the triangle button when using the camera, if I recall correctly. Then, set your exposure to something lower like 1/60, maybe 1/500 maximum.  You get that feeling of motion. Like this."
granturismo,3276iu,ImCummingOniiChan,1 point,Sat Apr 11 13:36:43 2015 UTC,I was using 3 the whole time. It's more difficult to get a good feeling of motion with multiple subjects. For me at least. Haven't quite figured it out.
granturismo,3276iu,Shmogt,2,Sat Apr 11 15:32:30 2015 UTC,"Perspective and experimentation. Sometimes, you can only sugarcoat a subject that much, settings only get you that far.  Gotta find moments where cars move at the same speeds, or use angles to help.  Some of your images consequently turn out flat or unrealistic.  Depth of field can serve to cover up some of these minor disrepancies.  Edit: try mode 2 in corners as well. See if that helps."

If you run a decent race [1:07 to 1:08s] in one of the Group 4/Group 6 cars [XJ13, 330P, GT40 Mk.IV], you've got just enough time to catch the others to be taking the fight to them at the tail end of the 5th lap.  The small-block GT40 Mk.II [""race car '69""] doesn't have the grunt to hang with the rest, and usually falls back into the clutches of the Pro Touring cars [or whatever it is they're from].

You'll have to make quick work of the 1st turn, go through the semi S curve at max possible speed, then I advise breaking late on the tunnel turn. Not good at describing the technical term for the type of corner there but you can essentially make it one breaking point instead of two. The rest of the lap not much time can be gained on the AI (maybe a bit on the hairpin). Also, I had to hold off the 7 on the straight with my rear view mirror on so keep that in mind"

I managed to pull the 7 in the race I finally won [the 2J cycled out finally], but only won because it ended up in the sand off turn 1 on two different occasions, speared it in the door hard to get turned at the final hairpin while coming in way too hot, and then power-blocked my way to the finish line."

granturismo,31uv27,jocker12,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:21:44 2015 UTC,"I would hope so, the addition of nitrous and the new fast cars (Hyuara, GTR Nismo and the VGT cars) would make for some damn impressive times!  However I feel that if it were going to be a feature it would have been included in the game to start with. Here's hoping."
granturismo,31ufl3,bombcat97,9,Wed Apr 8 06:04:45 2015 UTC,"It's because mostly everyone that's talking about Gran Turismo is on gtplanet, and they have a huge community because they've been around for years."
granturismo,31ufl3,stungungun,2,Wed Apr 8 12:39:24 2015 UTC,"even if gtplanet is a dedicated website, still, they got sections for all the other major sim titles or racing games.... It is a different platform though, with discussion forums, and separate areas for tunes as well.  On a subreddit will be super confusing to mix everything up... Here you will need multiple dedicated subreddits or subreddits inside other subreddits..."
granturismo,31ufl3,jocker12,3,Wed Apr 8 14:19:32 2015 UTC,I feel like there isn't much interest in a GT-sub without an installment on the PS4. I think this sub will really take off once GT7 gets released with the broad userbase of the PS4 and the size of /r/PS4.  I can't wait for it.
granturismo,31ufl3,CarloPlaya,4,Wed Apr 8 10:01:33 2015 UTC,"There's a reason it's not advertised in their sidebar, GT isn't a pure simulator."

It took them over a year to include a feature which was already on all the previous 3 versions of the game (B-spec) and the pace of release of Vision GT cars is straight up pathetic. There are at least another 20 cars to be released and its coming up on a year and a half since launch."

granturismo,31ssru,Strider2211,6,Tue Apr 7 21:56:09 2015 UTC,PD is really good about surprises. No one saw the Toyota TS030 coming when the Red Bull Ring update  launched.   Good luck in your info dive.
granturismo,31ssru,Minutes2Midnight,3,Wed Apr 8 00:00:49 2015 UTC,Well the GTR LMP1 is coming to Gran Turismo at some point. I don't think they specified GT6 though...would love to see them use GT Planet's car suggestion subforum.
granturismo,31ssru,NitroNihon,2,Wed Apr 8 01:08:15 2015 UTC,"It probably would've come earlier if Nissan stayed on schedule and entered to race this weekend.  That would've given PD the info they needed to proceed making the car's specs.  But now that they won't be in action until June, we're likely gonna have a long wait ahead of us."

granturismo,31ssru,gramcraka92,2,Wed Apr 8 04:56:55 2015 UTC,This could be VGTs until GT7 but i really hope something new and unexpected like the TS030 comes
granturismo,31ssru,Andefir,2,Wed Apr 8 02:34:01 2015 UTC,There is supposed to be a new Nissan LMP race car coming soon.  So is the GoPro “Rampage” 1970 Camaro which won the 2014 Gran Turismo award but there are so many gran turismo award winning cars that didn't get put into the game so this will probably repeat with the camaro
granturismo,31ssru,Onionsteak,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:00:12 2015 UTC,"They don't put the Sema GT award cars into the current title, they wait till their next release to release those new Sema cars."

granturismo,31r7fu,dudethatcooksyum,8,Tue Apr 7 17:51:06 2015 UTC,"Never lose the pack. Nascar is all about slipstreaming.  Unfortunately the AI in GT6 sucks so much that PD decided to manually give them commands to make it more competitive. For half the race - cars go slightly faster than intended so you could feel that there is ""tension"" while driving, yet at the 2nd part of a race (say if you go 4 laps - it would be lap 3 and 4) the AI starts going slower than you, so you can actually win. This is very evident in international B and onwards.  So in nascar - Stay around the middle of the pack, slipstreaming all the way. If you get to first place in the first half of the race - other cars will just overtake you (which is fine, if you can tailgate them further, but sucks if you lose the pack). Only jump out into the first - in the 2nd part of the race, and just floor it. The AI shouldn't be able to overtake you then."
granturismo,31r7fu,Thnito_Kyrios,2,Tue Apr 7 17:56:50 2015 UTC,"Wow man I wasn't doing any of that, thank you for the info"
granturismo,31r7fu,dudethatcooksyum,2,Wed Apr 8 00:13:24 2015 UTC,watch the replay and you can see the throttle and brake modulation
granturismo,31r7fu,gramcraka92,2,Wed Apr 8 02:26:39 2015 UTC,Stay on the bottom. I always get out front and block on the straights and try not to let them under me in the corners.

granturismo,31mpv7,IamAnthonological,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:10:31 2015 UTC,"They're only dirt cheap if you buy them without an internal HDD, which is definitely required if you want to play Gran Turismo."

It's definitely possible to find one, but it will require some daily persistence on your part to grab one before someone else. Keep checking eBay for auctions that are ending soon and Buy It Now options. Also, be wary of shipping costs...  Finally, don't buy GT before the PS3 gets shipped! I bought a PS3 that the seller never sent (not sure if he was actually trying to scam me) and ended up with an unusable copy of GT5 at my house."

granturismo,31ko3e,ImCummingOniiChan,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:06:43 2015 UTC,"i usually have a LSD just because but you'll do good with yaw control, every evo that i've owned in game i have never had a bad setup with"
granturismo,31ko3e,tehpwnage7,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:13:19 2015 UTC,"The Active Yaw Control affects how the Evo feels mid-corner, because it's effectively a limited slip diff for the driveshaft. Adjusting it one way or the other will affect how the car ""bites"", essentially. 4WD cars have a tendency to push, especially in long corners. AYC compensates for this by allowing you to adjust the yaw angle through the corner. More rotation is good to a degree, but too much rotation can be counterproductive and scrub off speed. The best thing you can do is experiment with the balance of both the AYC and the LSD to find where the car feels the most balance and gives you the best controlled rotation, especially through long constant radius corners. Hope this helps."
granturismo,31ko3e,chase_c343,1 point,Sun May 10 01:48:17 2015 UTC,"Yaw control if that's how it's spelled  or if that's what your talking about. All the way to the left the car will turn better while not accelerating and the the right 130 I think is turning while accelerating is better. I do all acceleration, 130 or the maximum you turn far better. And change the torque split for the car and point towards more RWD, so 10:90-25-75 split."
