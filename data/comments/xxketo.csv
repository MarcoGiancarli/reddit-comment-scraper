xxketo,3e3qar,healthywinks,7,Tue Jul 21 18:50:22 2015 UTC,"I 'skipped' my favorite pair of pants that I'd been waiting to wear. They were skintight, and muffintopped me a bit when I first bought them, but they were so unique I had to have them. Then I gained weight and consigned them to the back of my closet. Even when I'd lost a lot I was afraid to try them on again and didn't want to feel fat when they didn't fit. Finally when I decided to face the music...they were too big for me. I was pretty pissed at myself."

xxketo,3e3qar,water_is_bae,2,Tue Jul 21 20:39:45 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing! I had a pair of Old Navy jeans that were always way too small to zip up. Even moved them twice--but didn't want to get rid of them as they were cute and I always thought, ""someday!"" (They were so old that the denim was really thick and sturdy...not like today's Old Navy jeans) Anyway, pulled them out the other day to try on and they're big and baggy! To Goodwill they went! Funny how much easier it is to part with clothes that are too big rather than too small."
xxketo,3e3qar,futuregoldengirl,2,Wed Jul 22 02:23:46 2015 UTC,"awesome idea!  I can totally relate to ending up with extra clothes that don't fit.  not only do I buy clothes without trying on because I HATE trying on clothes, (and then they end up too small) but I'm also guilty of buying clothes that are just a tad too snug- as motivation. While I wish I could tell you that I now fully understand it doesn't help motivate (speaking for myself), I am still guilty of this... I'm still hoping for that day where I can wear the majority of the clothing I own... I'd have so many options!  And a new style that is more 'me' and less 'lets cover this up'."

My wardrobe is 50% cutesy things that either once fit me or I bought like ""this will fit me"" because I'm CONSTANTLY trying to lose weight, and 50% sweatshirts/baggy tees/ drapey shirts. My boyfriend has picked stuff out of my closet before and suggested I wear it, not understanding that I can't wear half the stuff I own... and it makes no sense to him either that I keeps stuff I can't wear."

I won't need to go on any big shopping trip when I lose all the weight, I can just wear what I haven't ever been able to that I already own.  Until then, I'll be taunted by how good I know I'll look in the shift dress I bought a year ago that is a size too small.  Ugh."
xxketo,3e3qar,the_sandra,2,Tue Jul 21 19:55:42 2015 UTC,"I actually buy clothes for my goal size (size 8/M). I have a closet full of brand new adorable clothes that I can't wear yet. For a long time I thought I was an idiot for doing this because instead of losing weight I was gaining it. And then keto walked into my life. And now, I believe that one day not far from today (maybe by this time next year, hopefully) I'll be able to rock the shit out of my cute clothes. Currently, I only own like 3 tops and 3 pairs of jeans (size 18/XXL) that are becoming too loose for me. Just yesterday I was able to pull down my jeans without undoing them when I had to pee. And I remember these pants being snug when I first bought them.  Edit: a word"

It is really hard knowing/feeling like you are disappointing someone (not sure if that is exactly the right way to put the feeling) with your weight.  You know that their intentions are good, they want you to be healthy and happy, but you can't help but feel they are ashamed of you in some way, and that is what is motivating their support (speaking for myself only, of course.)    I feel the same way about my parents.  They made off-comments to me since I was a kid, and look at me now, it NEVER helped me.  I just felt more and more upset at the fact that I couldn't make them happy with my weight, and now I'm bigger than ever."

I really think negativity from others is really looked over... that they say ""you're the one who ate your way to this weight"" ""you cant blame us for your decisions"". But it is very very very dangerous when they use words to damage our self esteem. I know I ate my way here, but you were the one who told me I was fat when I wasnt."

I suppose that's not any different than regular freezer-friendly foods, haha.    Here's a yummy ""Mac and Cheese"" recipe that might freeze well.  And here's a chicken finger recipe that should also freeze well (as long as you stick them in the oven again?). I've made them, very tasty.  You could probably make some keto-friendly pizzas with keto-friendly bread and freeze those! Here's the crust recipe I have used in the past, it turned out really yummy.

xxketo,3e3p23,anbeav,3,Tue Jul 21 18:51:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a sign you've been kicked out. Sometimes our bodies do weird things with water or waste.

xxketo,3e2mbf,throwawayladymay,11,Tue Jul 21 14:04:45 2015 UTC,"ok, i will probably get downvoted, but here's my 2 cents:  weight is not the most important thing, despite what reddit wants you to think. you won't be terribly successful at losing weight unless you're able to commit yourself to it fully, and with everything going on in your life, it sounds like that's not the most pressing issue. more important, i would wager, is getting yourself to a healthy state of mind. look into some treatment options for depression, and get to a stable place with that before you tackle your body.  in the mean time, learn more about how the body processes different foods, learn what your body needs and look into creating some meal plans. pin a bunch of keto recipies on pinterest, get yourself prepared for when you're ready to commit, so that when you're in the right place mentally, you'll be able to make a smooth transition into your liftstyle change.  anyway, that's just my 2 cents."
xxketo,3e2mbf,_skittle_brau_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I really appreciate your honesty, and you're absolutely right that getting to healthy state of mind is more important than anything. My hope is that a healthy body will eventually come with a healthy mind. Thanks again for your response."
xxketo,3e2mbf,fancyflorals,4,Tue Jul 21 16:06:55 2015 UTC,"I think seeing someone about your depression would be a good first step. And you have control of your body, at least the food you put in it. But to do well on any lifestyle change like keto, you need to be willing to dedicate yourself to it, and as you've experienced before, if you're not dedicated 100%, you can fall off the wagon and not have motivation to get back on. It's forming a habit—at first, you have to really pay attention to what you're eating, ignoring cravings, teaching yourself to say no, learning how your body feels when you eat keto vs non keto, etc. Then you reach a certain point where it becomes a constant, like brushing your teeth or showering, you don't have to force yourself to do it, it's just part of the routine. If you're not ready to commit to your physical health now, you may only feel worse by failing again. It sounds like it's an area you want to make a change in but that you might be too overwhelmed to do so. However, being in the mindset of starting the diet after x event can cause a lot of ""I'll start tomorrow"" and the tomorrow never comes. In general, you may want to try to treat your body better until you can fully commit to keto--just making healthier choices in general, less sodas or sugars or fast food, whatever is your vice. I think you made a good realization, 30 lbs in 4 months isn't achievable for many women (unless at a high start weight, and even then it's not always realistic). Many realize that weight loss can be 1-2 lbs a week and it's almost never linear. When you realize it's going to be a long wave to ride, it can help fight the urgency to reach a ""finish line"" and rather guide you to focus on making lifelong changes. As many women realize, losing weight doesn't solve emotional problems, but it can help you take a step in the right direction to helping address your physical and mental health overall."
xxketo,3e2mbf,ghostforest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:29:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this! I really do have to get over the ""I'll start tomorrow"" mentality, and begin with small changes first."
xxketo,3e2mbf,nose_to_tail,2,Tue Jul 21 16:05:42 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you've really been through the ringer and I hope that things are stabilizing for you. And, I agree that getting some help with the depression will also be a great step. I think that the best way to frame the next steps is to concentrate on doing things that are nourishing to your body and mind. For me, that means eating keto things that sound good to me and I know are good for my body, it means sleeping well and enough, and it means doing things that are pampering and focus on me loving myself and treating myself like I'm valuable and worth it. It also means restricting how much access toxic people and things have to me and my life. If someone is making things worse or not treating me well, I put up a strong boundary and don't let them crash around in my life like a bull in a china shop.  Weight is weight and it's not where to focus, IMO. Sure, losing excess is a good goal, but it shouldn't be the only way to frame positive change. Positive change is being nourished and nurtured. It's making time to connect with people who love you and treat you well and it's also prioritizing nourishing yourself on a deep level. For me, when it comes to food, that means keto. I'm a life-long emotional eater and that kind of eating wasn't nourishing, it was covering other things up with the illusion of temporary comfort. It also had a bad snap-back effect that made me feel worse. So, when I feel like eating for emotional reasons now, I do something really pampering and tempting that's not eating.   For me, especially when times are tough, I really love the structure of keto. It literally becomes the one thing that I can control and keep consistent for myself. It's a routine that reminds me that I'm worth it and that eating this way is a way to show myself that I matter. So, I make the commitment to do that for myself. I make a plan and then lean on that plan. The good news is that you can start right this minute. Ramp up or go all-in, but whichever path you take, make sure that you're framing it as something nourishing and healing that you're doing because you're worth it.   Congratulations on your marriage. Chosen family is a powerful thing and I wish you and your spouse all the best!  If you need help with the nuts and bolts of a meal plan and macros, come back here. There are lots of smart ladies here who will work on it with you."

Luckily I didn't gain that much with my pregnancy (maybe 30lbs total- give or take a lb or two).

I have been trying to lose weight for 7 years, and it's really only in the past 18 months that I've had any sustained success. But for 5 years, I was learning. And learning. And learning. And finally I am seeing progress, but the reality is that I was making progress that whole time. Every ""fail"" is/was a lesson that got me one step closer to where I am today."
xxketo,3dz0bc,thedazzler,9,Mon Jul 20 18:32:53 2015 UTC,You are not failing. You are taking steps to improve your  health. Everyone eats high-carb foods at some time.   I think it's part of the process to be honest. Learning how I feel on and off carbs has helped me make healthier decisions in the long run. And a meal at a time is an awesome approach :)   Tangent: Is your name from the Wheel of Time books?

xxketo,3dzjsy,mistressg,4,Mon Jul 20 20:21:02 2015 UTC,"If your mind is feeling fuzzy, that's likely an electrolyte issue. Are you sure you are getting enough? What sort of deficit are you running? Another thing is that your body is adapting. It will take time. There are tons of people who do endurance races on keto and they do quite well, but they are fat adapted (in combo with lots of training) which takes 6-8 weeks.  I would up your electrolytes and make sure you are getting a bunch of water!"
xxketo,3dzjsy,hydrate_the_sponges,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:40:36 2015 UTC,MFP is set to around 1500 calories. I'm drinking loads of water but maybe I need to find some Powerade Zero to keep me going. Thanks!
xxketo,3dzjsy,Oranges13,5,Mon Jul 20 20:44:23 2015 UTC,"Powerade zero has a laughable amount of electrolytes, sadly. It's better than nothing, but you'll really have to drink a lot of them in a day to have any effect.  I add about a teaspoon of lite salt plus mio to my 24 oz water bottle; I probably drink about 3 or 4 of them in a day.  In general, its about 2000mg (2 grams) of sodium and 3000mg (3 grams) of potassium chloride per day."
xxketo,3dzjsy,hydrate_the_sponges,2,Mon Jul 20 21:18:52 2015 UTC,"You can make your own electrolyte drink by putting some lite salt and a squirt or two of mio into a glass of water. In Vegas, I stashed a thing of mio and a thing of lite salt in my purse to use whenever I needed it."

Now I drink a cup of broth a day with 1/4 teaspoon of nu salt added in, and I don't taste it like this. Don't forget to take your magnesium, too!"
xxketo,3dzjsy,ghostforest,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:24:10 2015 UTC,I drink Sole water for my electrolytes. You make it yourself with water and Himalayan salt in a mason jar. there are loads of recipes for it on the net.  The Himalayan salt contains 80+ minerals we need and it has less sodium than putting salt in water. I'm going through the weak phase myself (2.5 weeks in haven't cheated) and it really helps me.
xxketo,3dzjsy,thedazzler,3,Tue Jul 21 00:25:36 2015 UTC,"You can also add salt or lite-salt to your drinks. Go back and look at FAQs or do an /r/keto search on salt intake.  It may seem weird or counterintuitive, but you really need A LOT of salt each day not to feel like shit."
xxketo,3dzjsy,wackybones,2,Mon Jul 20 20:52:17 2015 UTC,"Yup, this is an electrolyte problem. Review the FAQ section on electrolytes and supplement. I eat salty snacks (pickles!) and salt my food and drink low-carb broth with salt added. I also use Morton's Lite Salt. You probably don't have that if you're not in North America, but you probably have a similar product marketed toward people with high blood pressure. The salts are either a blend of potassium and sodium salts, or just potassium salt. They are a great source of potassium. I try to get 1000mg of potassium in addition to what I get from food. I also take a magnesium supplement for another 400mg of magnesium. I much prefer a chelated magnesium like magnesium malate (pick one that has an -ate ending like malate, citrate, glycinate) - they don't give you diarrhea or GI issues.   If you're running and working out a fair amount, you have to get more than 5000mg of sodium a day, try for 7000-8000mg of sodium. That will help with how well you feel, especially while working out and after.   Don't bother with commercially available ""sports"" drinks like Powerade zero. The amounts of electrolytes in those are laughably low. They'll do nothing to fix the deficits you have."

I was zombie tired and gave up 3 times before committing fully.  For me, I think it was my body running out of glycogen storage which I always used for energy but not yet switching to burning fat for energy.  I found that by dropping carbs REALLY low (5g) but eating lots of fat (LOTS Of protein) helped the most.  You could just try it for a few days??

xxketo,3dzjsy,minorpianokeys,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:41:09 2015 UTC,Also Crystal Light lemonade and salt.  The sweet lemonade balances out the salt so I'm able to get down about 1 teaspoon of salt per lemonade individual drink packet.  I ended up doing that 3-4 times a day for the beginning.
xxketo,3dzjsy,yumyumfat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:43:11 2015 UTC,"I am about on week three,  and definitely the salt is a huge issue.  Bone broth,  pickles, etc. have helped me considerably.

I had been drinking bone broth before I started keto, as I make it for my dogs, and I do believe that has helped me kick through the keto flu phase faster.  I also took too much magnesium,  yikes.

It wasn't something I had to do, but it wasn't a cheat. I decided that I wanted to have some things over a set period of time. For me, if keto is going to be a lifestyle change, I need to accept that these things I'm not eating right now are not forbidden forever, but rather that they are things I will only have very rarely. As long as it doesn't make me slide down the metaphorical slippery slope, its really fine.  But yeah! Sorry for derailing. Congrats on the loss!

Plus, I feel good about myself that I'm sticking to a commitment I made to myself. I read an article once about how detrimental it is psychologically to chronically make promises to yourself and not keep them. If I stick with it, the scale will move eventually.

I have not seen much of any change on the scale for several weeks but I have been working out hard and tracking and staying within my macros. I have a past full of yo yo dieting and huge losses (and re-gains) so I am just trying hard to be patient. But now I see this as lifelong and for my health. I want to be a mother someday and I want to be around for many years so I have to take care and exercise patience. This point is so important!
xxketo,3dudc9,TheNamelessOnesWife,3,Sun Jul 19 19:15:10 2015 UTC,"This is so true, and something I really struggle with accepting. It's ridiculous to let slow weight loss discourage me and lead me to fall off the wagon, since the consequence of that is obviously no weight loss at all! I've tried lots of diets trying to lose at least 2 pounds a week, or I get really restrictive, and they're not sustainable. 6 months later I'll have given up and be the same weight (or more) whereas if I'd chosen a more reasonable approach I could be halfway to my goal.

If you are like me, a carb addict and addicted to binge eating, this is just about the on,y thing that will work.  Having said that, calorie targets are tricky. It was very uncommon for me to eat more than 1800 calories at your size. I just wasn't hungry enough. Today, I typically get between 1350 and 1600. I think anbeav's targets are fine, but once you are getting 1300 calories and meeting your protein macros, I see no reason to force yourself to eat more. If you are hungry for 1800 or 1900, by all means eat that, because you will lose weight either way."

xxketo,3dtm86,Clemmmentine,5,Sun Jul 19 20:53:00 2015 UTC,"My Mom gave me a rather genuine nice compliment today. Sometimes I don't know with her, so I always have my salt prepped whenever we get together. She started with You really are sliming down with a smile, then she paused and added, What is your husband going to do when you get more gorgeous, is he worried? Does he have a plan? So OK. That was funny and a good one."
xxketo,3dtm86,TheNamelessOnesWife,4,Sun Jul 19 15:49:37 2015 UTC,"Today is the first day I feel like I can notice a bit of a difference from losing weight! Not massive, but my pants are a little bit looser, which is a great feeling. I've also survived a kind of stressful and overly social weekend and managed to stay on track the whole time. I have a long way to go and am very prone to getting discouraged so I'm trying to remind myself to take note of and give myself credit for these tangible achievements."

Keep it up and don't stress...remember a slight stall for a couple of weeks is totally normal and expect it....just do what you're doing and push through it (if it happens).  Then the weight starts coming off again and it is just like a little miracle.  I love keto."

I'm gonna stop counting the days back now because I was never really gone.  What am I counting, perfection?  Perfection isn't a thing.  It's not a thing.  This is my life now, this is how I eat and if I can't be flexible I'm gonna have serious problems maintaining it for the rest of my life."
xxketo,3dtm86,spicy-melons,2,Sun Jul 19 14:48:25 2015 UTC,"Ha ha....I was wondering what you were counting, too!  I was thinking...hey beesyrup has been doing this for more than 7 days!   I join you in your quest for a flexible happy place.  I believe it can be done!"
xxketo,3dtm86,beesyrup,4,Sun Jul 19 15:38:06 2015 UTC,"I don't even know. Part of me is still hung up on the ""day count"" aspect from the old plan I followed, which was full of black and white thinking.  I was counting days of sticking to macros and not exceeding them at all.  So last night I had salad at like 10pm and went over my calories.  Big deal, it's salad and I wasn't even up to maintenance calories.  I just really wanted cold, crunchy romaine lettuce and dressing right at that exact moment, so I ate it. On the old plan that'd put me back at day one.  Newsflash to self: this is not that, relax. I know, I'm weird."
xxketo,3dtm86,ghostforest,2,Sun Jul 19 18:25:57 2015 UTC,"Free yourself from the day counting and just make it the way you eat now! Flexibility means sustainability. As long as you stay keto and make good choices, you're in. Resetting in an aim for perfection is a distraction that keeps your eyes off the horizon. Onward!"
xxketo,3dtm86,beesyrup,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:53:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I'm really working on it, it's an unhelpful habit.  It doesn't help that MFP slaps me in the face with a day count every time I go there."

I went to weigh myself to enter data and the scale is reading 179.8- the first time below 180 on the new scale! It's real!   And yesterday I experienced the mythical not-hungry phase of keto. I ate under 1000 calories and didn't feel the least bit deprived. It was great! I'm sure I'll be hungrier today, but it's been a really good week for me. :D"

Work and life stresses have really come down on me the last week; and I've been eating a lot of carbs, including cereals and grains. Holy bad mood! I was in a funk all weekend that lifted as soon as I had a full keto-only meal. These work/life stresses aren't going to get any better for the time being, but I can handle them infinitely better when I eat well.   Going to start participating here in hopes that y'all can help me when the going gets a little tougher and I feel myself start to slack."

It was somewhat easy during the week, but I faced the major battle on the plane home.  I was upgraded to first class (yay, it's nice up there!) but the stewardess brought everyone these huge warm cookies (boo! where are the nuts?!)...oh the smell of cookies!  She asked me 2 times if I was sure I didn't want any!!! Which was sweet, but jeez.  Instead, I shoved a 90% lindt square in my mouth, put my headphones on and tried to sleep...lol.  Although it's great to be back and having my own food, I think all of the residual stress from the first week of my new job hit yesterday.  I had all of this nervous energy and just ate way over TDEE.   I completely didn't follow what I was supposed to do when stressed- exercise, meditate, drink water, watch a movie, journal..etc..   But I am going to do that today.   Edit: I had to change my username because of a nosy friend borrowing my computer :)"

This time the gap went on way too long and a shirt that had fit me for over 2 years was too tight around the midsection and now I am back again.   I'm frustrated with myself. I always do so well with keto, but I use cheat foods to comfort myself or entertain myself and I'm still struggling to find a better way. (I actually started for the first time in 2010.)"

So it's not so much a keto thing, as it is a fat loss thing. But keto is great for fat loss. :) Your period should go back to normal (or, away in your case) over time."

xxketo,3dqha5,armoureddachshund,6,Sat Jul 18 19:44:27 2015 UTC,"Mine never ""went away"" just went from the normal week down to about 3 days - most months it's just 3 days of spotting instead of a period. That's been good enough for me.  HOWEVER, if you've just started keto you're going to have a wild ride for a few months.  There isn't a normal; everyone is different so your mileage may vary. However, my first 2 periods on keto were like middle school. Heavy (like 3 tampons in a day heavy) and clotty and ANGRY.  But, after that, it was smooth sailing. It's just the initial burst of hormones hopefully and you'll regulate once you stick to it.  DON'T GIVE UP ON YOUR HEALTH because of this. It's a silly excuse, you can do it! :)"
xxketo,3dqha5,Oranges13,3,Sat Jul 18 18:00:21 2015 UTC,"I had Mirena inserted in December to control high volume of blood loss each month.  (We're talking 8-11 days needing to double up tampons and pads to catch the extra...sorry if that's tmi)  First period was very manageable.  Started Keto in February.  Periods have been light and getting lighter each month.  However, quite sporadic as far as timing.  Used to be very regular...not so much anymore...sometimes shark week comes quite early, but it is rarely an entire week anymore and I can handle the flow, so I'm happy!"
xxketo,3dqha5,spicy-melons,2,Sat Jul 18 15:22:19 2015 UTC,I am a PCOS sufferer so I'm not sure if this will help you but I get light spotting every other month or so. No full periods though.

Each following month it got lighter and shorter to the point where I'd have pms symptoms but only one day of very light spotting. Then it was gone again.

xxketo,3dqha5,neon_prayers,2,Sat Jul 18 22:59:24 2015 UTC,I have had the Mirena for ~3 years and no period for the last 1.5 years. I've been in keto now for 2 weeks and I spotted a few days ago. It was unexpected but lasted less than 2 days. Yesterday I was ultra-sensative and I cried for the first time in a while...I didn't understand what was happening until I realized that this is what I used to feel like when I was on my period. It's different but it's also kind of nice to be reminded that I am a woman.  Sorry for the lack of guidance and advice :)
xxketo,3dqha5,neon_prayers,2,Sat Jul 18 20:08:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was taken by surprise at how emotional I've been getting, it's been sooooooo long... maybe mirena is why I'm SUPER TOUGH AS NAILS?"
xxketo,3dqha5,Nosy69,2,Sat Jul 18 20:20:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, I relate! In my early 20s, my emotions tended to get me in to a LOT of trouble. The past few years there's been a complete absence of drama in my life. I guess I figured this was the result of growing up and maturing. But I think I've missed out on a lot of life by avoiding my emotions and desires. I guess I've been tied down by my insecurities. Sticking with keto (as well as not drinking...cuz I can't handle booze well) I want to break free! I feel so good so far and I know it'll just keep getting better."

xxketo,3dqbl7,soanti,4,Sat Jul 18 12:24:28 2015 UTC,I have never heard anything like this! I would definitely avoid dairy if this is the effect you're experiencing as a result. You could try coconut cream instead?

Pain came back, not as severely but definitely there, along with sudden exhaustion. Paranoid about pneumonia coming back, and too tired to stick to my new routine, I stopped walking to work, stopped swimming, struggled to climb the stairs at work, and comfort ate. My comfort eating was keto (all halloumi, all the time) but without any energy I stopped caring, weighing and tracking.  I saw a doctor on Thursday and my lungs sound clear, and I have an xray booked for tomorrow to double check. It's probably just a blip in the road but having list the energy I'm so demotivated. Demotivated enough that when friends came round last night I joined in with the pizza, chocolate and ice cream (my original plan had involved sticking to halloumi!)  Finally I've had a word with myself. I can't do anything but rest and ride through the pain, and it's so much harder to look after myself when I'm this tired - everything goes into just surviving the work day - but I was doing well so I'm going to try to get my old attitude back. I've been avoiding reddit all well but I'm back (though still can't face the ""everything's so amazing!"" of r/keto, I much prefer the real life, practical,  doing-the-work feeling here, makes me feel much more supported!) because just visiting and reading helps me make constant positive adjustments. I'm back to keto - and tracking - today and will try to be kind to myself. I'm going in holiday in a week and my aim for this week is not weightloss but happiness and feeling better in myself.   Anyway, sorry for the ramble, hope you're all doing well and thank you for the inspiration!"

I lurk and sometimes see people musing about what happened to posters who just disappeared. I'm here with an n=1 report: about a year ago I hit a nice number on the scale that I've maintained ever since.   I had to get honest with myself that there's a complacency creep happening with my food (exercise has progressed) and it's time to recommit to ""making abs in the kitchen"" as the saying goes. One of the most successful times of my life is correlated with feeling supported and being supportive here, so here I am.  In the last year I discovered I'm a fructose malabsorber (explains a lot of why I feel so much better on keto!). So, in addition to low carb, I eat low FODMAP and as a result of that, pretty much paleo since there's so few processed foods I can eat. Just in case anyone else is dealing with other issues that restrict their way of eating like IBS and would like the company/support :)"

I have, however, been applying moisturiser twice a day to that bit and it really seems to be making a difference even after acouple of weeks.  I hear three things help that you can control: water intake, moisturising and weight lifting. I waited until I was on the cusp of normal to start lifting - but you're doing yoga which is great.   I reckon if you start moisturising suspect areas now that's going to be a big help (and who doesn't like soft skin). I hear great things about coconut oil for this actually - and I'll start using that once i've used up my existing ones.  I know what you mean about the worry - that's why I was in denial in the beginning - but that thing you hear people saying (I'd rather have a bit of loose skin than be that weight again) it's TOTALLY true. Feeling/looking like I do now is WAY worth alittle crinkle. Especially when they say it will keep toning up for acouple of years after the weight loss anyway!"

Been browsing loseit about our issue now (loose skin) and somebody commented something I found pretty useful. Apparently the occurrence of loose skin is associated more with quick loss and stretch marks. So, firstly you're unlikely to get loose skin in areas without stretch marks. That's a plus.  Secondly, because you mentioned you did have some stretch marks you know which areas to focus on. So - that derma thing, moisturising and maybe focus your yoga/weight-training in those areas. I know spot training isn't a thing - but it can't hurt right :)"

On another good note, I'm finally getting a post shark week whoosh and hit a new low weight this morning. Given that my previous low was due to severe dehydration after drinking too much, I'm definitely taking this low as a win."
xxketo,3dq33k,fivecentpsychiatrist,2,Sat Jul 18 16:03:58 2015 UTC,"I finally got a new scale in the mail so I can accurately weigh myself. I stepped on it this morning and it's up 2 lbs from what the analog one told me yesterday. I'm considering it an NSV that I'm not feeling a bit bad about that. I'm just happy I can track my weight to the 0.1-lbs level now!   As a side bonus, it came with a nifty body-measuring tape that makes it much easier to measure my biceps/thighs/calves etc... and it reads a half inch smaller than my old tape. I know it's not a real difference but it is nice to see numbers shrink :D   I also tried out an egg/bacon/cheese cup recipe and it came out beautifully! So it's been a really good day."
xxketo,3dq33k,Jennynot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:30:03 2015 UTC,"I never really felt like I could trust the analouge scale. Shift your weight alittle to the right and the needle moves a pound... waaay to subjective. At least now you have a proper one you can be certain it's accurate!   I'm impressed it came with the tape too - that's absolutly one of the better barometers of progress :) That and photos because the scale is a variable and temperamental thing at the best of times.  With the tape measure, a good thing to keep an eye on (as well as general waist measurements etc) are ratios. These can be good indicators of health.    Waist to height has been correlated with health, and should ideally be about 0.4 to be in a healthy range. Waist, btw, is the narrowest part, not the belly button part. I just learned this! Waist to hip is more aesthetics, and here the ideal is to be somewhere in the 0.75 - 0.7 range really. That one's more of a build thing though, we have less control over that one I think. Loss of body fat may help there perhaps.   You can actually also calculate body-fat % estimates from measurements too - which is also another excellent way to monitor progress other than the scale :)"

xxketo,3dq33k,Jennynot,2,Sun Jul 19 03:23:37 2015 UTC,"do you know, you can work out bodyfat from that?  I'm not sure if you're a spreadsheet fan (if that's where you're keeping track) but if you are the calculation is:  =([height in cm] * LOG([waist in cm]+[hips in cm]-[neck in cm])-97.684 * LOG([height in cm])-104.912)  Or you could just plug it into the navy online calculator I used above.

xxketo,3dpgf4,kattykat243,3,Sat Jul 18 04:38:40 2015 UTC,"Here is a meal plan where you only have to spend about 90 minutes on cook/prep every 4-6 days, depending on your calorie needs.   Shopping list: 2 dozen eggs Vegetables of your choice (avocado, cucumber, bell pepper, zucchini, mushroom, broccoli, cabbages etc). Get at least 9 vegetables total, 3 cucumber, 2 zucchini, 2 bell pepper, a pack of mushrooms, whatever suits you. Lettuce, kale, spinach, whatever you like. 3 heads of whatever. Butter, cream cheese, heavy whipping cream, and sour cream. Look for sales and buy in bulk.  String cheese makes a great snack. Berries can be expensive, but if in season grab 8-10oz of your fav berries or check the frozen food section for cheap ones off season. 4 cans of fish (tuna, salmon) 1 pork rump roast thing 6oz of whatever meat is on sale (pork, steak, chicken).  Deli meats like sliced ham, salami, etc can be the least cost effective, but most convenient. Look for sales. Seasonings you should have on hand: basil, dill, paprika, cumin, oregano, salt, pepper, garlic (fresh, powder, or salt. Lite salt If lemons/limes are on sale, grab 4-5. **Optional. Get a whole block of cheese on sale and shred it yourself.  Check out one new recipe every two weeks, and buy the stuff you don't have on hand for it.   Once every 4-5 days: Breakfast. Make a 12 egg frittata. In an oven-proof skillet fry up ham/bacon, saute in a vegetable (zucchini, broccoli, bell pepper, mushroom), scramble 12 eggs and add to the pan. Pop in the over 375 degrees for about 30 min, or until done. When it's cool, cut up into 4-6 servings, saran wrap, toss in the fridge, and pick it up in the morning.  Options. Good with onion also. Add cheese on top. If you don't have an oven proof skillet, make everything in a skillet, then transfer to a baking dish and pour eggs in that.     Prep for Lunch & Dinner 1. Make a real recipe for dinner, like pork carnitas or chicken parmesan 2. Cook the rest of your protein for your lunches in the oven or stovetop. These can go on big salads or lettuce wraps. Spices for baking chicken: garlic salt, paprika, ground pepper, salt. Or lemon, thyme, salt, pepper.  Spices for baking pork: Cumin, oregano, chili powder. Plain salt & pepper. Chinese 5-spice. You get the idea.   Prep your Veggies for Lunches & quick dinner While things are in the oven, wash the rest of your produce, cut up what needs to be cut up. Mix up a tuna or salmon salad for yourself.   So, four days would look like: Day 1. Breakfast frittata, lunch tuna salad or roll ups, dinner shredded pork tacos with red cabbage salad/avocado/plain salad, berries and heavy whipping cream for snack/dessert. Day 2. Breakfast frittata, steak salad with blue cheese for lunch, shredded pork tacos for dinner. Day 3. Breakfast frittata, tuna salad roll ups (add pickles!), chicken parm dinner. Day 4. Breakfast frittata, steak salad with tons of veggies, chicken parm dinner.   Berries for dessert."

BACON. It may not seem cheap, but it goes a long way! check out ibreatheimhungry.com -- some may require some pricey ingredients, but she has some great recipes nonethless.   Good luck!"
xxketo,3dpgf4,bikemuffin,2,Sat Jul 18 12:15:22 2015 UTC,"I like roasting the entire chicken and using the bones for broth. The chicken should last a couple of meals and it is cheaper per pound buying the bird and not just chicken parts. I also use a slow cooker for pork and beef roasts, those cuts of meat tend to be cheaper and using the slow cooker is ideal for the tougher meats. If you have a freezer, buying bulk meat is a good way to go. Possibly a local farm will sell you a percentage of an animal for a good price. The cheap per pound vegetables are carrots, onions, cabbage and cauliflower. The roots might not fit into your macros, but it's better than no vegetables and the roots are good for flavoring roasts and broth."
xxketo,3dpgf4,JewishEskimo,2,Sat Jul 18 14:53:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly I used to spend hours on meal prep and keto has definitely made me simplify. It's turned into lately:  Eggs for breakfast with cream cheese, maybe some meat on the side.  Lunchmeat-cheese roll ups or a tin of fish for lunch  Snacks of pickles, olives, nuts, string cheese  And dinners of ground beef or chicken thighs with Classico sauce and frozen veggies (cauliflower is my fave) or tofu/fish tacos on non-meat nights.  I may get bored of this soon. But it ain't bothering me yet and it's nice and cheap.  *Edit for formatting"
xxketo,3dpgf4,isolden,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:38:13 2015 UTC,"Hot dogs, salad with ranch dressing with cheese, anything with eggs, buy a pound of boneless chicken breast and cook in the oven in chicken broth and cream of chicken soup, then refrigerate and eat as needed, grill chicken or brats and eat as needed, cook up a whole package of link sausage, put in a bag and refrigerate, eat as needed. Broccoli is cheap, even in steamer bags, and good to eat. Sometimes it is hard to leave what you've always eaten, but try one new thing every few days, you may surprise yourself, and that may be your next thing you love to eat."

xxketo,3doqm5,vegmeh,7,Sat Jul 18 00:31:05 2015 UTC,"So, I know not having your period every month may seem fantastic, but there are many risks for it. Some of them are increased chances of developing uterine cancers, due to the uterine lining not shedding monthly, and it also increases your chances of osteoporosis in later years.  http://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/guide/absence-periods  http://www.medicinenet.com/amenorrhea/page5.htm#what_are_the_complications_of_amenorrhea  I have PCOS, so the chances of reproductive cancers are already higher for ladies like us, so you don't want to increase your chances anymore by not treating your menstrual cycle. It being irregular is a sign that something is wrong, and it should be addressed.  Losing weight will do a great job at helping your body readjust and start cycling normally again. It may make your periods more irregular at first, as all weight loss does, but it will stabilize once you return to a good weight."
xxketo,3doqm5,theresaratinmysoup,3,Sat Jul 18 06:01:24 2015 UTC,"I hate periods. Like srsly, cramps, cravings, mood swings, ruined undies and bed sheets spotted with blood. But I've been irregular for a few months now and it sucks. It really does. Evey month I just know something is not right. I feel excess blood in my veins. I missed a period last month and a few days ago when I started spotting I wanted to shed tears of joy. I'm feeling better mentally and physically. Periods are a pain in the ass, agreed. But they are also signs of a healthy functional female body. Never be grateful for missing a period. You need to take this seriously."
xxketo,3doqm5,Zephyrine_93,2,Sat Jul 18 21:49:36 2015 UTC,I do get once a month or every other month spotting now so it may come back as an every month thing as your weight drops. Before I started keto I had about 4 periods or less per year. As I progressed with keto I started having them more frequently once per month or every other month up until I got mirena then that changed to light spotting every other month or so.
xxketo,3doqm5,Lyrikah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:52:42 2015 UTC,I started keto just about 2 months ago. I have had 5 periods this past year. I had  31 day cycle last month (after a 94 day cycle previously) and I think I ovulated again this past week...I am seriously wondering myself if keto is the cause of the what I hope is some regulation!
xxketo,3doqm5,cmpet0,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:19:30 2015 UTC,"My experience is that they are getting more regular. I've always had these period issues and just was diagnosed with PCOS a couple of months ago after changing doctors. The other guy refused to look into it.   I've been eating keto for over a year. My ""cycles"" before keto where anywhere between 70-160 days.    During keto: They aren't quite regular yet, but they are getting much better than they were. I've had between 34-60 days and the past 3 have been with 34-40 days."
xxketo,3doqm5,Losingamy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:00:21 2015 UTC,"I can actually answer this one with personal experience!  I've had amenorrhea my entire period-having life and was diagnosed with PCOS in 2001.  I managed to lose weight through traditional diet and exercise which was a huge exhausting amount of work, but I was able to have kids so yay!  After kids, though, the sheer amount of time I have to exercise is a fraction of what it was and all the weight came back, as did the irregular menses.  I've been doing keto for 7-ish months now, and not only has it been stupid-easy and I haven't had to increase how much exercise I'm doing more than the 2-3 times a week I was previously, my periods have come back like clockwork.  I've had four since December 2014, each time coming closer together, and my last cycle was 29 days.  So, the good news is that I'm losing weight, I feel awesome, and my body seems to be reacting in a very positive way.  The bad news is that having a period every month SUCKS.  I got way too spoiled by only having them 2-3 times a year, tops.  They're also pretty heavy and crampy for me, too, so I whine a lot but the other benefits are still worth it, IMO."
xxketo,3doqm5,hairspiders,-8,Tue Jul 21 15:08:29 2015 UTC,"Well, I have PCOS and tho I've done keto before i was on BC pills at the time so I can't totally answer your question. But this time around I've been keto for about 7 weeks and haven't had a period at all. I'm over weight so that factors in too, same as the PCOS (chicken/egg problem). But I'm right there with you. One doc suggested BC pills solely for the purpose of regulating my period and I'm like ""eff that! why would I want periods all the time?!"" If it weren't for the fertility/weight issues PCOS would be the best thing ever! You get to be the superior gender, without mood swings or cramps or blood and you don't have genitals that do all your thinking for you!"
xxketo,3dms5r,bonitaappetita,5,Fri Jul 17 15:18:05 2015 UTC,"It's probably not fat loss, but if you had some chronic inflammation (allergies possibly), keto will lower inflammation all over, so maybe you have less inflammation fluid around your eyes now. If you have hooded eyelids (which you do), that sag happens with aging. You can get an upper blepharoplasty (eye job) to get rid of it. I have hooded eyelids and will probably get it done at some point when they start sitting on my lashes...  The skin could shrink back as well. Skin usually takes awhile to shrink back (sometimes a year or two), so it really depends on your skin genetics and how well your skin adjusts to changes."
xxketo,3dms5r,ghostforest,3,Fri Jul 17 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile so I can't see your stats. Are you overweight/obese? And if so have you been for a long time? That might just be your eye shape naturally but you never knew because there was always excess fat there. It actually doesn't look bad, mostly it just looks like you have a deep crease, which is fine. I've seen girls with similar even when I was in high school.   Also any skin care like firming eye creams usually take a month of consistent use to really start to show results.   I personally would choose that over excess fat anyway so keep using the eye cream and KCKO!"

xxketo,3dms5r,nionvox,3,Fri Jul 17 16:59:44 2015 UTC,Are you eating enough fat and gelatin? Your skin need nutrients to snap back. Maybe add some bone broth.

xxketo,3dms5r,jareths_tight_pants,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:25:49 2015 UTC,I always try to. And for a few weeks I overdid the water thinking it was dehydration but it made no difference in my eyes. :(
xxketo,3dms5r,nose_to_tail,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:50:33 2015 UTC,"That looks like a normal eye to me. The eyes are very sensitive to hydration. Perhaps up your water intake a bit? I have partially hooded eyes and they can be hooded either by the shape of the orbital socket and how deep set your eyes are, or by excess fat in the lids. Mine is excess fat in the lids. This is just genetic as almost everyone in my family has this problem. My mom's were the worst and she had to get an eye lift because they drooped so much that it was affecting her ability to see. She's gained a lot of weight with age so it's definitely not weight loss that caused her sagging."

One thing I try to avoid is xanthan gum; it backs me up so bad, I usually have to eat coconut oil and take laxatives so I can poop because I strongly dislike feeling like a log is jammed up my butt.

I love keto foods and do not want to go back to feeling like shit all the time.  I've set a weight 5 lbs. above my current weight and decided that if I see that number on the scale, I will start tracking again.    And you know what?!  Nobody died!  The world did not end.  ...and I am still at my first goal weight, with 2-3 lb. fluctuations here and there.  I did set a new goal, but now am just sort of living my life and not obsessing about food for a while...I absolutely love it.  Maybe I'll try to go hard-core again and lose the last 15 lbs...but maybe not.  Disclaimer: I will admit that I'd never be able to do it ""lazy"" like this if it hadn't been for those months of tracking religiously.  Those months shaped the way I eat.   I agree with you on the berries!  I also get around 40 carbs a day, almost exclusively from tons of veggies and some berries every day!    Isn't it funny how others insist on this as ""a diet""?!  Like your husband asking if you are still ""doing it"".  I don't feel like this is a diet at all anymore and I get (maybe a bit irrationally) annoyed when those close to me say ""are you still on that diet?"".

xxketo,3dlvoo,anbeav,12,Fri Jul 17 09:23:24 2015 UTC,"Day 5.  Feeling the over the top energy returning.  Reveling in the absence of pain of any kind in my back.  The food I eat doesn't have to cause pain in my body - that's just crazy if it does.    Had an epiphany of sorts last night during journaling about my black and white, perfectionist thinking that leads me to completely nullify my past progress and worth as a human being if I do even one single thing I deem to not fit in that illusory ""perfect"" ideal I somehow got in my head.  I know how I got it in my head and it was that greysheet program I followed.  I compare myself now to myself then and it's a really poor comparison because now is not then.  When I screwed up one time in 11 months back then I ate for 7 years to ""punish"" myself afterward.  It's funny their name was greysheet because they really reinforced black and white thinking.  You were either on plan and doing it perfectly or you were a complete fuck up who just ""couldn't"" (read: wouldn't) stop eating.  Yeah so screw all of that, I'm glad I was writing and it all bubbled to the surface in these sudden shocks of OMG I've been judging myself by harsh, outdated and unrealistic expectations.  I have the power to make good, rational choices for myself and have been doing that consistently again.  Just because I haven't been 100% perfect on keto since I started in March doesn't completely nullify everything I did before the crazy, disordered and imperfect eating happened.  I can abandon the false standards of perfectionism I learned from so many different sources these past 43 years.  I can still aim for perfection and maybe I'll hit excellence?  Idk if Vince Lombardi applies here.  Weekend plans:  food shopping, food prep, husband things, rest from the gym, journaling, reading, have sober fun somehow.  Enjoy your Friday ladies!!"
xxketo,3dlvoo,beesyrup,3,Fri Jul 17 11:12:26 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, perfection is the enemy of the good. Congrats on your epiphany!"
xxketo,3dlvoo,Plum51,3,Fri Jul 17 13:10:04 2015 UTC,Such an important realization! I sabotaged lots of good change by either going totally overboard with enthusiasm or by scrapping the good because of slight imperfection. It's a slippery slope to the bottom when we can't recognize accomplishments and progress because we're too distracted by slight imperfections. Getting my head readjusted about my mental patterns and mental habits has been my biggest keto accomplishment.
xxketo,3dlvoo,ghostforest,4,Fri Jul 17 18:47:41 2015 UTC,"I think I have had that realization before.  I tend to forget everything and then re-learn it over and over and over again, only improving minimally throughout all the realizations.  I need to remember not to go overboard with enthusiasm, too.  How do I always forget all this really important shit and yet remember where every pencil and lost item is at the office going back 15 years?"
xxketo,3dlvoo,beesyrup,3,Fri Jul 17 19:32:14 2015 UTC,"glad to hear you're feeling better, you've lost a lot of weight already, something to be proud of! This keto journey is amazing and so educational on personal levels, I love it :)"
xxketo,3dlvoo,beesyrup,2,Fri Jul 17 11:39:59 2015 UTC,Thanks!  The weight I've lost feels like nothing at all because I'm over-focused on the end goal.  MOAR perfectionist thinking!!!

I'm really surprised because I ate back almost all of my exercise calories this week and ate Chinese food last night (steamed chicken and broccoli- who'd've imagined keto friendly Chinese exists!?). I will, however, take it!   My brother is officially moving out this weekend, and while I'm fiscally stressed, I'm pretty excited to walk around in my underwear again! I'm going to make his old room my ""exercise studio"" and my niece's room my guest room (lol- like I ever have guests!!!).   My other goal for this weekend is to test out my brain to see if I can do the Sprint  distance triathlon next weekend. I will not cause my brain injury, but I am going to do all in my power to race because my 8 yr old niece has completed the ""TriGirls"" program associated with this race. She's worked all year to complete the 500m swim, 10 mi bike, and 5k run and she gets to run across the finish line with me and get her own medal at the actual race. She is SO EXCITED to get her own medal, and she cannot cross the finish line without her ""Tri buddy"" which is me! Also selfishly I am super excited to be in race week because I've missed it SO MUCH. Plus, because of my niece my mom and bro will be there and I have literally never had anyone come to a race to cheer for me so that would be awesome. Fingers crossed and, as always, positive brain energy appreciated!"

I'm so excited and this is just so motivating!   As for this weekend, well tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m. I finally get to go meet my puppy! We get to take her home in 2 weeks so my life is definitely going to change. I'm really looking forward to getting to finally see her as the breeder hasn't sent any pictures. When people ask about what kind of dog my puppy is I want to be able to show them actual pictures of my dog. Basically right now I'm obsessing with getting all of the things she needs and reading up on as much as I can. I've had dogs before, with my parents, but this will be mine and my husband's first dog. So it's pretty exciting!  Sunday is my six months on keto and I'm going to a bbq at my grandma's, so I figure that is a pretty great way to celebrate. Overall, this weekend is packed with visiting friends and family, I'm sure it will fly by so I'll try and savour every bit of it! Have a good one ladies!"

My commute to and from work were each an extra 45 minutes so I was super stressed and exhausted by the time I got home. My SO brought home tortilla chips (biggest pre-keto guilty pleasure). I ended up eating only 5! And I slowly enjoyed them which was nice, instead of just shoving them in my face. We also went out for a drink after dinner and I just got a rum+diet coke instead of the usual beer or sangria.   Worried about this weekend as I'm spending Saturday - Tuesday at the beach with my friend's family so I don't have much control over what I eat and I probably can't weigh anything out so I'll have to eyeball and probably over estimate.   Any suggestions on easy keto-friendly snacks that don't have to be refrigerated and might sustain me a bit would be super appreciated.

So at the end of the day(I live in the eastern hemisphere), I'm under my calorie goal. Not even slightly hungry.

I am not having cravings. I have energy. I wish I could understand what is different this time. Less than 10 pounds and I'll be out of the ""overweight"" category for BMI.   If you haven't seen it yet, there's an app called TwoGrand that many of us are on, and we post pictures of the food we eat. It's kind of like keto Instagram.

I've gone over my calories a few days (but I'm aiming for a 30% deficit, so there's some room for error in that regard), but for the most part I've been very close to my macro goals. I'm starting today with two cups of delicious French press coffee, each with 2 Tbsp of HWC and the first with some almond extract and the second with a little maple and vanilla (yum!); having half an avocado with lime and garlic for a mid-morning snack; going to a neighborhood work-from-home lunch meetup at which I plan to have a steak salad; then going out to dinner with some friends, I'm sure I'll end up having a bunless burger or something. Not sure how I'll track lunch and dinner, I'll either just guesstimate or not bother... but either way, still seems like a pretty good day.  I'm in a great mood today because I'm getting some really encouraging traction and leads on new positions for which I've been applying and submitting my resume. My current job is Just Not Working anymore (after the entirety of my responsibilities, and my reporting structure, changed about a month ago) and I am ready to get OUT ASAP.

I don't know what the shift was this week but people keep asking me about my diet and my food, like a lot of detailed questions on how it works or how to get started or how I made what I had for dinner and it kind of overwhelmed me. I figure this way I can just link them straight to a blog with a bunch of useful links and info. I'm not in your face about my diet on my social media, I just post a lot of food pics and such, but I guess my progress has gotten to that noticeable stage and everyone wants to know my ""secret"" (a couple have been genuine interest b/c they also have PCOS).

We had a really productive meeting yesterday, and the upshot is that I should have more to do around here soon.  Tonight I'm eating dinner out with the family, at a Brazilian place.  I'm used to eating a huge meal at lunch time, so I've brought some small stuff to keep me occupied.  I didn't get a run in this morning like I wanted to, but I'll find a way to get my 2nd for the week, per my July goal.  Rest days are a good thing; I just wish I wasn't going to eat a huge meal today too!  Tomorrow we're doing a celebratory bonfire for hubs' birthday (which is today, hence the dinner out), and other than that I'm hoping to get in some ass-kicking workouts mixed in with downtime, preferably by the pool.  :)  Happy Friday everyone!"

I've been hungry all week and had low blood sugar in the evening several times.  When that happens I try eating more food, deficit be damned, and drink a salt/no salt mixture.  But that hasn't helped, so I'm a bit miffed. Also it was shark week and I'm down 2+ pounds. I'm not sure if or how any of it is related. I had blood drawn last week for a general physical and I'm interested to see how that comes out.  Next week I need to focus on starting body weight fitness and figure out this blood sugar issue, and possibly adjust my deficit. Today I go in for a mammogram, oh joy!  One funny thing I noticed lately is that my ass hurts if I sit too long....some of my padding has left the building! If only my stomach and neck would do the same."
xxketo,3dlvoo,SteelersBnGG,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:39:32 2015 UTC,Are you diabetic? Why are you checking your blood sugar? It's unlikely blood sugar and more likely electrolytes. What are your symptoms?
xxketo,3dlvoo,fivecentpsychiatrist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:00:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not checking with a device or anything, its a feeling I get of shakiness and feeling lightheaded, similar to how i felt when i overindulged on food preketo.  I guess low blood sugar feeling is the wrong terminology, even though that's what it feels like.  Its probably electrolytes. I cut out no salt/potassium earlier in the week, but maintained my salt intake, it was giving me loose stool.  My bathroom issues disappeared afterwards. It's a delicate balance apparently and I have a sensitive stomach.  Yesterday I tried reintroducing no salt 1/8 tsp at a time, twice a day, but still felt off.  I guess ill gradually increase it, and salt too, hopefully finding the correct amount. Its been a pain in my ass - literally!"

I learned from that that I can keep a faster pace on the dreadmill much easier. This morning it was super muggy out so I did my mile on the mill at the gym in the AC. Then for my lifting I had an off day and was only able to get one rep at my bench of 125 when last week I was able to get 3. I think it's that I did about 35 full pushups and 55 knee pushups in my workout yesterday. Muscles weren't quite recovered from that I guess.   I don't have any big plans for this weekend. It's supposed to be sunny, hot, and muggy tomorrow so I'll either go to the beach or hole up in my AC. I want to go see the movie Trainwreck this weekend. I'm sure there will be yardwork too.

xxketo,3dknv7,hrtofdixie,15,Fri Jul 17 01:16:22 2015 UTC,"A lot of people do ""lazy keto""- which is kind of what I do. Though I think a lot of the people who have the most and the fastest losses definitely track their macros/calorie intake, many people have had great success with ""lazy keto.""   Basically, the way I lazy keto is that I eat keto foods, and generally keep a running track of how many carbs I'm eating in my head, trying to keep under about 20. I don't ""track"" calories so much, but I do try to be careful about the amount I'm eating and know ""eh, this meal is about 400 calories"" and keep my other meals in a general 400-500 calorie range. I try not to eat too much, and because I'm kind of just keeping track in my head, I don't make a lot of complicated keto-friendly recipes- I don't want to add up the carbs from fractional amounts of nine different ingredients. I also try really hard to make sure I'm getting my electrolytes in- I add salt and salt-substitute (potassium) to most things.   Like I said, this does not work for everyone, and I know I would probably lose faster if I was measuring/recording everything. But for you, maybe, it would be a little easier to get started if you didn't feel so intimidated, and then as you learn more about it and what your body responds to, you could transition into tracking/measuring/macros. A lot of people feel pretty hungry when they first start keto, and many decide not to track their calories for the first few days or weeks and just kind of eat until they are satiated.   What's been easiest for me is to cook a simple protein- usually just a chunk of meat- usually sauteed with butter or olive oil and seasonings, and keto-friendly vegetable (usually green beans or broccoli or cauliflower). Roasting any of those veggies with a little olive oil and salt and pepper is a wonderful way to enjoy them simply- and you can add different types of shredded cheese on top. Salads with a protein on top and a full-fat dressing like ranch or caesar are usually good choices, too. Eggs and/or bacon or BPC for breakfast. Keep it simple at first, eat until you feel satisfied, and stay away from bread, sugar, potatoes, and fruits other than most berries (and berries in close moderation).   Sometimes for me, tracking too closely leads to sort of obsessing over food, and sometimes even meal plans do. Also, when I have a meal plan together and I am missing an ingredient or for some other reason am unable to follow it, I get really frustrated and feel like I'm more likely to just say fuck it. I do think it's been important for me to pack my lunch, though (usually leftovers from dinner) to prevent me from going to restaurants and making mistakes.   Best of luck!"

xxketo,3dknv7,Wendyland78,8,Fri Jul 17 13:33:07 2015 UTC,"First, macros! We have really similar starting stats, so this is going to be pretty easy for me to do for you. Using the keto calculator, giving the age/heigh/weight you posted, I am estimating about 44% body fat (just a guess), and sedentary activity.       1515 kcal Daily Calorie Intake 25g Carbohydrates (7%, 100 kcal) 80g Protein (21%, 320 kcal) 122g Fat (72%, 1095 kcal)      SOME NOTES. Aim for a minimum of 1400 cals/day to start off, and limit to 25g net carbs, and a minimum of 70g of protein. If you’re like “I’m not hungry!” make sure you get your protein in, and eat less fat. The keto saying is: Carbs are a limit, protein is a goal, and just eat fat until you feel full. It is really tempting to think “WOW I’m not hungry, I’m only going to eat 1000 calories today.” Don’t give in to this temptation, it’s really likely to backfire on you, make you ravenous and then you’re way more likely to blow the whole deal with a crazy carb snack.      TRACK. I know this might seem really annoying, and you will think to yourself “I’m busy and tracking seems like a confusing hassle.” Do you know what is a hassle? Trying to put all this effort in and not seeing results and wondering why. It’s extremely frustrating. If you are tracking, you will be able to know whether or not you’ve been meeting the goals listed above and if “it’s not working” you’ll have a much easier time figuring out what to tweak to make it work. You have two options for tracking: myfitnesspal and TwoGrand. TwoGrand just involves making a commitment to snap a photo of everything you eat/drink and posting it for accountability.  Here is a list of us on xxketo using two grand. And here is a list of us on MFP. I'm thedazzlertracks on both and if you decide to do either one of these, add me and we can help each other stay on track!    ELECTROLYTES. This is so extremely important I’m giving it it’s own paragraph. Every. Single. Morning. You need to drink a big glass a water with 1tsp of LiteSalt (also called NuSalt), which is sodium, magnesium, and potassium. You can put a bit of lemon juice in there. Is it gross? Yeah. You know what’s worse, though? MUSCLE CRAMPS AND KETO FLU. So just do it. Don’t sprinkle litesalt in there either, get a teaspoon, measure your salt out, and mix it up in water.      Alright, so, what can you eat? Meat: Eggs, chicken, beef, lamb, fish, tuna fish. Check the labels on sausages and bacons and get the lowest carb count you can find. Vegetables: Celery, zucchini, mushrooms, cucumber, lettuce of all kinds, radishes, peppers, eggplant, garlic, pickles, dill, parsley, oregano, cumin, kimchi (fermented veggies), sauerkraut. In limited amounts you can also have some tomatoes, don’t go crazy with the tomato sauce or ketchup. Fruit: Avocado. Berries in small amounts: blackberry, strawberry, blueberry. Dairy: Butter, heavy whipping cream, full fat greek yogurt, sour cream, cream cheese, and most cheeses (check the labels for carb counts).     MEAL PLAN Breakfast: eggs and bacon Cook up 2 eggs, 2 bacon. If you drink coffee/tea, drink it black. frittata If you are on the go, make a frittata using this recipe bacon/broccoli/mozz frittata or google “keto frittata” until you see what you want. Make it Sunday night, cut it up into servings, wrap in saran wrap, and grab it before you head out in the morning. SKIP BREAKFAST AT YOUR OWN PERIL!     Lunch: The idea for lunch is protein + fat + vegetables. Salad. You can do a big salad with lettuce cucumber radish avocado + protein (chicken, tuna, salmon or steak). Depending on your day you can flavor it Mexican (add cilantro, lime), Italian (oregano, parsley, lemon, fresh pepper), Korean (pickled carrot, cilantro, basil, and a few tsp of white wine vinegar). Roll ups. Three slices of cheese with 9 slices of deli meat (ham, salami, whatever you like), mustard/mayo, lettuce, and veggies of your choice (zucchini, cucumber, radish). Layer from bottom to top, cheese, meat, sauce, veggie, and roll up.       Dinner: If you want to feel good, you’re going to have to do some cooking. Bunless burgers. Cook up hamburger patties, add cheese. Serve with side of veggies (mushrooms, zucchini, and some frizzled onions), avocado. Asian stir fry. Chop up half an onion, garlic, and ginger, sauté in olive oil, add meat (chicken, steak), add chopped up veggies. Chicken parmesan. http://www.ruled.me/simple-chicken-parmesan/ Enough said. This is so good I want to die of happiness when I eat it. If the pork rinds stink at first, just deal with it. It doesn’t take pork-like at all. Fish “tacos” Use lettuce as the taco shell. Season fish with salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, pan fry. Serve with a salad of sliced red cabbage with 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar, and cilantro, and sour cream and guacamole.

Start slow with just breakfasts, then start adjusting your meals one at a time.  I was much more successful once I took my time and really prepared myself.   Here's an example of my meal plan.  I am for around 25 net carbs per day.    Breakfast- sausage and hot tea with heavy cream.   Lunch- salad and hamburger with no bun.  Sometimes I add cheese to salad or burger.   My salads vary.  My burger meat varies.    Dinner is meat and non starchy vegetables.   One of the easiest meals you can get is a rotisserie chicken and a box of salad greens.   Boil the bones with water when you're done and you'll have broth for soup or snacks.   I try to keep things simple because I have a full time job and three kids.

xxketo,3dkab7,iplayrogues,9,Fri Jul 17 12:49:28 2015 UTC,"I disagree on the ""carb is a carb""  so it doesn't matter where it comes from. The fiber actually does help slow down the absorption of the other carbs than say eating 20 carbs of refined sugar. This means you see a steady increase in insulin instead of a big spike.   As far as ""cheating""....Really no matter what people say on this sub,  telling yourself at the beginning of a lifestyle change  like low carb/keto that you'll NEVER in your life eat something off the list of keto approved foods because it's ""cheating"" is still fostering an unhealthy relationship with food.    It puts too much power in one meal, when it's the accumulation of choices everyday over time that really matter.  People also start mistakenly thinking ""well fuck it I cheated"" and think that since they had some grapes they might as well eat some ice cream and cake when clearly there is a difference in nutritional value between fruit and candy.  Just realize that you can't have nearly as much of those foods that made you fat as you had before and if you choose to indulge make it the exception and not the rule. You should stay on plan the majority of the time to see results of course, but it doesn't have to be black and white all the time."
xxketo,3dkab7,anbeav,3,Fri Jul 17 06:11:10 2015 UTC,"For the purposes of ketosis, a carb is a carb so I avoided the nuance but since we are being nuanced, curiously fruit is quite unique in this regard as it has fructose which not only doesn't stimulate insulin but goes straight to the liver to stop ketosis.

That said, now that I've been at least thinking keto for three days and consistently keeping it at 30-35 net carbs - my stomach is already noticeably less puffy and I don't have the cravings I was having on Monday before keto. For me it's as much to ""wean"" myself off high-carb foods as anything. TRULY appreciate your comments."
xxketo,3dkab7,runninghome,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:53:39 2015 UTC,"Many people accomplish low carb with occasional fruit. Also remember that keto does allow for moderate consumption of high fiber berries like strawberries and raspberries which aren't as carb loaded as other fruits.   Also although 20 of carbs is ideal for induction, many people stay in ketosis at under 50g, some more than that but 50 is as high as I ever go unless I just totally go off plan."
xxketo,3dkab7,heladodevainilla,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:19:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for that encouragement! I'm going to check out blueberries and blackberries which we have in abundance right now and which I LOVE.  And I'm relieved to hear that my 30-35 net carbs aren't as sinful as I'd supposed...
xxketo,3dkab7,jareths_tight_pants,2,Fri Jul 17 15:25:29 2015 UTC,"Short answer is that all carbs are equal: fruit, table sugar, rice etc are all equally ""cheats"" on keto, your body treats them as sugar. (Though I hate calling anything ""cheating""). Long answer is that you don't have to do keto exactly by the books if it doesn't work for you. I'm on day 6 and I keep reading that if I want to be ""fat adapted"" after a month I shouldn't be eating fruit or having more than 20 net carbs per day for now. Well, I'm eating berries every day because I love fruit and I've set my carb limit around 30 net carbs because it gives me more leeway. I'm comfortable like this so this is what I'm doing.  I've been warned about the whole slippery slope thing but that really varies by individual. My family eats bread, rice, cake, chocolate, and whatever else around me and I'm not tempted to touch any of it. Just do what works for you and keep an eye out. If you feel bloated or want to lose faster, you can reign in the carbs. It's a learning process to see what sort of lifestyle change you can maintain, and there isn't one set of rules that everyone can follow and feel comfortable with."

I get a lot of really good ideas/inspiration for keto meals by seeing what they're eating everyday. It's crazy how creative you can get with your macros if you've got some good examples. If you decide to download either one, feel free to add me. My username on both is dessobick. :)"

I have to admit some anxiety that my food isn't as good looking as other people's foods, but that's just my silly mind being silly.  Got some great new ideas so far and am being more creative in the kitchen to keep my pictures (and the meals) more interesting.  edit: I use MFP free to track macros religiously. I think there's probably better things out there but I'm balls deep in MFP by now and change is hard. I myself never select any thing from the MFP database without first verifying its info in the USDA database and I usually end up correcting entries to include sodium and potassium which are all too often absent or incorrect in MFP.  Then once I've verified something to my own satisfaction it's forever in my recent foods list for future use."

I wouldn't pay for MFP, the upgrades really aren't necessary. I use it to track calories and keep on top of my macros. Being still about a month in, I want to keep a close eye on nutritional information for the meals I tend to have so I know how my body responds to each.

MFP free, you don't have to upgrade to premium and there's really no reason to upgrade imho.

xxketo,3dhq1q,cuckoochick,10,Thu Jul 16 10:55:52 2015 UTC,"When I became pregnant last year, this was one of the first questions I asked my OB since I have PCOS. She essentially said ""no"" to keto during pregnancy but encouraged a low carb diet... basically eating a gestational diabetes diet. My OB is pretty cool and has no problem with keto otherwise. I think this was the smartest piece of advice and I am glad I followed it. I gained 30lbs during pregnancy. After my baby was born the first 20lbs came back off fairly quickly, I did have quite a bit of swelling/water retention for a couple weeks due to having a c-section. Still have about 4lbs to go to get back to pre-baby weight (which was still too heavy). My daughter will be 8 months old this week to give you a reference as to the timeline.  I think staying low carb during pregnancy helped prevent me from getting GD honestly. I did have some carby cravings- bologna/cheese sandwiches and chocolate milkshakes from McDonalds, and I did occasionally indulge them. After the baby was born, I didn’t want anything to do with those things so I do attribute those cravings to being preggo. Overall, my doctor was happy with both my labs and my weight gain and so am I. I had researched quite a bit but always taking the advice I read with a grain of salt… have to stick to what the doctor says- she’s the one who is guiding and supporting you through the whole process."

I am glad you had a healthy pregnancy and baby, with the help of you doctors guidelines. 30lbs is not much at all especially considering C-section iv's and drugs that retain a lot of water. I am really wondering the reason for increasing the carb goal to 100g if we are able to get all the necessary nutrients even otherwise."
xxketo,3dhq1q,thedazzler,2,Thu Jul 16 13:13:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't increase my goal to 100g, but I guess some may and I'm not sure where that number comes from. During pregnancy I still stayed away from pasta, potatoes, most breads (except on those darn bologna/cheese sandwiches) but did include more fruit- didn't actually have a # goal. That's where most of the carbs I ate came from I think- bringing apples, pears or grapes to work. Fall fruits were in season and it worked for me :)"

xxketo,3dhq1q,MedusaGrey,6,Thu Jul 16 14:19:40 2015 UTC,"I think I'm going to be non-keto during any possible future pregnancies. Essentially ketosis is the body functioning in a completely different way, which we as adults can apparently deal with - but I imagine a developing fetus will react to this different way of functioning. That's also why I imagine the carb goals of around 100g are used - it's not that the carbs are needed necessarily for nutrition, but rather to maintain normal cellular functioning rather than ketotic functioning in early development.  I'm obviously not an expert or anything, and you've read actual studies. But even looking at the wikipedia page for the ketogenic diet mentions adverse effects in children - who are put on the diet for epilepsy including stunted growth and issues with bones and kidneys - I imagine this would only be worse at embryogenesis."

xxketo,3dhq1q,Cowen818,4,Fri Jul 17 09:01:05 2015 UTC,"Solid science on the effects of ketosis in human pregnancies is going to be hard to come by, due to the nightmare combo of ethical considerations, the impossibility of randomly assigning women to eat keto or not eat keto during pregnancy, and the 100's of confounding variables (age, starting weight, prenatal medical conditions, genetic family history). Not that ethics are a nightmare of course, it's just incredibly hard to do good research on diet, forget on pregnant women and babies.     Studies using an animal model of ketosis are typically using horrid diet composition (rat chow comprised mainly of transfats and other shitty materials) and personally I find them almost useless for studying what actually happens in humans.  So, where science is lacking, let common sense reign. If personally I were pregnant, I would eat whole foods (including veggies), pay closer attention to sourcing my fish (limit Mercury) and meat (limit growth hormones), and stick to between 50 and 100g of carbs a day. Limit exposure to alcohol, tobacco, any other smoke, and other environmental toxins. and make sure to sleep and get enough gentle exercise."

xxketo,3dhq1q,KetoThrowaway222,3,Fri Jul 17 10:03:59 2015 UTC,"I guess my answer is anecdotal as well but hopefully it'll help :)   I'm 25 weeks pregnant with my first. I started out obese at 200lbs and 5'7. I'm currently 203lbs but my highest weight this pregnancy was 212lbs. I started getting lazy a month ago and bingeing on whatever I wanted. I felt like complete shit and the number on the scale shot up fast.   I talked to my doctor and he said that because I'm obese, it's possible for me to lose weight while pregnant if I stay active and eat enough clean calories. So that's exactly what I did and now I'm back down to 203lbs and counting. I'm loosely following Keto and I feel fantastic!   On average I hit 100+ protein and 50-60 carbs. Fat intake varies but I keep it strictly healthy with things like avocado and fresh ground peanut butter. I LOVE fruit so almost all of my carbs go to watermelon and berries lol. The most important thing to remember is not to diet while pregnant. Eat clean and stay active but don't severely restrict your calories or nutrients.   I'm losing by weight because I'm obese but this won't be the case for all women."

I am so glad you found a way to be healthy during pregnancy, and your diet is almost close to our usual diet with the exception of fruits. My question really though was not about losing weight during pregnancy, but really eating at maintainance which is a lot of calories, but maintaining the macros and to some extent the question was also about the effects of sticking to 20-25 carbs."

From most things that I have read since then (because I would like to maintain keto or mostly keto during my next pregnancy) it's safe to eat keto but it's not really recommended to lose weight because of the toxins stored in fat cells. So my plan is to eat at maintenance if/when I get pregnant again. Last time, I wasn't super strict about it, but stuck to it for the most part."
xxketo,3dhq1q,CeseED,2,Fri Jul 17 12:16:57 2015 UTC,"I'm finding it difficult to maintain strict keto eating. I track my food most days and I'm also trying to eat more than 2,000 calories a day. I haven't brought my diet up to my doctors recently, but they were with me for my first who is 10 months old now, so I imagine they are aware of it and unless something seems dangerous they aren't going to say anything.  I'm still nursing, that changes things a little too, between the kiddo and the baby I have a built in deficit of like 600-800 calories. If you do a search in /r/ketobabies for the word ""update"" most of the posts you see will be mine from my first pregnancy.  The main dif. this time around is that I was 5lbs less when I got pregnant (158 vs 153) and I continued to lose in the 1st tri, getting down to 147 before I started actively trying to not lose, more maintain. I eat what I want to, which is fruits, eggs, and mostly chicken because no other meats sound appealing right now and because of the calorie deficit I can also indulge in some sweets when I feel like it without too much guilt.

There really isn't MORE information needed and 100g is a good goal to keep in mind. I'm sure there haven't been many conclusive studies as to why, but I would think logically since you are a) adding in calories to support your child's development and b) your child has not been affected by a carb-heavy diet. They are not addicted to sugars, etc. and the carbs they are receiving from you as mother directly relate to their development within the womb.

I think I will switch back to IF and save meals for the evening because it gives me a bit of wiggle room if I have unexpected work meals in the beginning of the day.    I'm traveling for work and really enjoying the empty hotel gym every morning.  It not only burns off some calories, but the stress as well - which I honestly care more about than the calories.   Since I usually work out at home, it's also nice not using an ottoman as a weight bench :)"

Today I go to the chiropractor about my neck pain, meet with my two bosses about my future at this company, and go watch AntMan in 3D.

I'm worried that he's going to say certain negative things that I know are unfounded, and because I'm PMSing, I might not be able to logically defend myself.  Must control emotions!!  The good news is that there is very little chance that I will be dismissed (I've reached my 90 days and this is a tiny technical center, so it could happen.)  If my duties change in a way that I wind up disliking, I can just keep it up while I find something new. Edit- My condolences on being in a similar situation."

It only took 46 days! Sigh. Two more pounds to onederland, if I don't bounce right back up again. I just took my last exam of our didactic year! This is a MASSIVE weight off my shoulders. I'm hoping that my stress levels will drop, my cortisol levels will drop, and maybe the vice grip my body has on every last ounce will loosen up. That said, my cohort is going to throw down this afternoon, and alcohol consumption will be happening. May my willpower be stronger than my booze-induced carb interests.  Going to Orlando this weekend for a wedding and to visit friends/family - still trying to decide how keto I want to be. I'm 6 weeks in, and I feel like I should try to keep it up as much as I can, but man, that's a lot of eating away from home to try and deal with. So we'll see. I won't do anything blatant (beer, pasta entrees, etc lol) but if the catered dinner at the wedding has some starchy sauce or something (""if"" - ha! of course it will) I'll probably just go for it rather than be a PITA.

I was super proud of myself because the other night, I went out for several hours and managed to nurse just two small glasses of white wine the whole night. It sounds silly, but I think it was the first time in years I had managed to go out drinking and not order too many drinks (by virtue of calories or just blood alcohol level!). Made me feel like I could do it- and you know what? I had JUST as good a time as if I'd have had 7 drinks- and no headache in the morning!

I'm planning my weekly meal prep too, to use up the veggies we got in our CSA this week.   But the thing that's got me distracted is this major overhaul of our personal finances that I'm trying to get through. The last year has seen a lot of overspending our budget since we bought a house and had plenty of income to cover vacations, impulse purchases, etc. But we agreed to start trying for kids in late 2016, at which point my husband would quit one of his part time jobs so we wouldn't have to pay for childcare. Right now we depend on that other income to balance our budget... so we need to start balancing it like he's already quit, and shove all that money into savings and debt repayment.

The first thing I did was nap like crazy, then I slept some more, slept in the next day, and napped the day after that.  Today I woke up many pounds lighter, which I know is partially dehydration, but also due to the hormones I've been lacking due to sleep deprivation.  Now I feel like a million bucks.

I picked up some Xanthan gum at the grocery store and made protein fluff for the first time. I used 1c unsweetened vanilla almond milk, 1 scoop iso-zero vanilla whey and some xanthan gum, added 2 tbsp of cocoa powder.

I met with the trainer guy at the gym I belong to and he measured my body fat but only on 5 points.  He came up with 35% and honestly that just seems way low but whatever, it was free. The keto calculator said 49%.  He starts going on and on about, ""Well your BMI and your calories intersect at the avenue of bullshit and douche-land and you have to really exercise a lot to lose weight.""  I'm just like, ""okkaaaay then there Mr."" Then I'm asking him about my form on the bench press and he starts telling me to use the Matrix machines instead.  I don't use any of those machines so he takes me out to the floor to show me them and when we get out there, standing 6 feet from the bench press he looks visibly AFRAID.  He's like, ""Yeah this machine is better than the bench press because it's easier.""  And I just said, I'm gonna stick with the bench.  He was like okaaay, good luck!  Overall the guy was kind of douchey and I don't think he really knew what he was talking about so I was glad when we parted ways.  No more talking to strangers anxiety!  So then I did my workout amongst all the giant men in the weight area which always terrifies me til I start.  I didn't get fatigued at all during it as I was concerned I would.  Then I walked a 20 minute mile and sweat like mad, which was awesome.  I feel so good after accomplishing my workout.  On the food front I'm adjusting to 1325 calories really well.  I'm gonna go walk on the treadmill after work for 30 minutes and if cardio 5 days a week starts to make me hungry I'll scale it back.  Have a terrific Thursday!"

xxketo,3dhk6g,dinosnoores,3,Thu Jul 16 14:10:56 2015 UTC,"[Day 4] Going well. Slightly went over my calories yesterday by ~150 but I had calculated them to be 20% deficit so nbd. Still dealing with so. much. hunger. Started drinking 2 cups of water as soon as I wake up to help curb it. Realized I made a major mistake. After all my planning around starting keto I completely forgot about electrolytes. I ate some plain salt last night (whatever) and will take some magnesium tonight. I tried to find potassium supplements at CVS this morning but couldn't find it :/ I don't feel like I have keto-flu so hopefully I get lucky until I find some.  Also, question about sugar-free candy. I thought it sounded like a great idea, looked at the carb counts for some and most of them were 15 carbs per serving due to 15g of sugar alcohols. Do all of those go toward net carbs? Luckily I didn't buy them after searching on reddit and discovering many people had stomach cramps after eating too many but I'm still curious about sugar alcohols. I've seen some post that say to count them, to count half, and to not count them at all."
xxketo,3dhk6g,beesyrup,2,Thu Jul 16 14:22:42 2015 UTC,"Instead of trying to find potassium supplements, have you thought about using Lite Salt or NuSalt? They're salt-substitutes- they are sold by the salt in the grocery store. They are basically just potassium. The supplements you can buy are very low-dosage (because too much potassium can cause you to have a heart attack) and provide so little that you'd have to take several of them to really get much benefit (at least for me). The salt substitute is much cheaper as well.   Sorry you're dealing with hunger. One thing that helps me is chicken broth. I keep boullion cubes in my desk. Add some salt substitute and a sprinkling of dried cilantro and pepper (which I also keep in my desk) and it's surprisingly satisfying and helps with those electrolytes!   A lot of people also ease off on the calorie-counting for their first few days/weeks of keto and just eat until they are satiated until they get more adapted and their hunger goes away. Maybe you should not worry so much about a deficit for a little while and just eat at maintenance calories while you're getting used to it. Best!"
xxketo,3dhk6g,dinosnoores,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:46:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your suggestions! I'll definitely try the bouillon cube thing and so far I've decided to lighten up the calorie restriction as long as I stay around maintenance which is pretty manageable.   I'll definitely look into the salt stuff, we just bought a huge box though so idk how the SO will feel about new salt.  We'll see."
xxketo,3dhk6g,beesyrup,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:19:43 2015 UTC,"Congrats on day 4!  What's your typical day of food like? Do you get enough protein?  Sometimes hunger is normal when adjusting to a new calorie deficit, especially for the first time.    I don't know a lot about sugar alcohols off the top of my head but there's a good thing in the FAQ about them.  I generally avoid them because they make me ravenously hungry in excess, or stall my weight loss from previous experiments.  When I want something sweet I just chew a piece of sugar free gum and get enough sweetness for a year from one piece."
xxketo,3dhk6g,Lizabetanne,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:45:16 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think it's just carb-starvation. Before keto I easily kept around 1300 calories, and now my limit is 1395 and I'm still hungry. Protein has been enough (72g, 106g, and 89g the last three days). I mentioned it yesterday and someone probably hit the nail on the head by saying I'm probably either misinterpreting hunger for thirst or just the absence of fullness."

It's still hard to KCKO when I've been stalled out for two weeks and then slowly gaining even staying within macros and calories. I also just got off of a round of prednisone for a slipped disc and I'm sure that is a big part of the issue as well.

At the movies, I did resist the temptation to have 'just one' piece of popcorn. So, today, I'm going to try drinking more broth, and see if that helps me save more calories for my evening meal. I tend to short-change future me. The little devil on my shoulder whispers, ""I can have another serving of pulled pork. If I eat all my calories now, I'll just fast through dinner."""

xxketo,3dhk6g,jessfm,2,Thu Jul 16 20:53:27 2015 UTC,"Ended up being lame last night and just chilling with Netflix rather than going out. Then I woke up at 230 wide awake and with some restless leg issues. So annoying. I finally fell back to sleep around 430 so when my alarm went off at 5 I hit the snooze several times. It was very tempting to skip the gym, but I decided I just needed to do it. Got in a good card deck workout and I'm happy about that. Will have to do my run later tonight because I had an inspection at work early this morning. The inspection is over now and I took a more leisurely walk back to my office including a slight detour through one of the botanical gardens on campus to check out the flowers. I've got no plans for tonight so I've got a few options: go shopping, go to the movies, or do some clearing out of stuff in my basement and laundry. Pretty exciting stuff here."
xxketo,3dhk6g,ketobento,2,Thu Jul 16 15:40:16 2015 UTC,"Man.... I completely messed up last night. I knew what I was doing when I took that piece of yellow cake, and I knew it was gonna be bad for me, but when you live in Japan and you only get american cake once a year? I gave in to my urges.   Of course this morning, I broke out in cold sweats and felt nauseous. The sugar crash? Keto Flu? who knows, maybe a bit of both but it felt horrible. It always reinforces that I don't need that stuff, no matter how much my body screams 'You want it! you LOVE it!'  Today I have a nice simple lunch of slow cooked herb chicken thighs and string cheese and herb-butter broccoli. KCKO."
xxketo,3dhk6g,jessfm,5,Thu Jul 16 22:13:07 2015 UTC,"Knowingly let myself have a cheat meal yesterday and I'm okay with that. I've been craving real pizza for a little over two months and i wanted it, so I had it. My biggest worry in the beginning of keto (this time around) was that if I slipped up, even a little, I would never get back to it. Well of course I did. I woke up this morning had a lovely keto breakfast and will carry on my way. It's nice to see that I myself have changed. Not just what I eat, but how I eat, and how I handle what I eat. (That was confusing... but whatever) The scale went up slightly this morning, and that's okay. It happens. Was the pizza worth it? To me, yes. I don't regret it. But I'm also not planning on doing it again any time soon. If it's another four months, year, never, that's okay. But ultimately it's my body and my decision.   I'm three days out from my six months straight on keto and I'm just feeling really great."

xxketo,3dhk6g,TheNamelessOnesWife,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:23:24 2015 UTC,"One thing I've missed quite a bit on keto is iced coffee. I don't even drink coffee all that often, but every now and then I really want some iced coffee, especially in summer. So I brewed a cup of coffee, let it cool then chill in the fridge. Added 1 egg, 2 scoops (1 serving) Isopure Chocolate Whey protein, 2 tbsp HWC, and ice cubes. I blended it up in my Ninja blender, the two cup one you can drink out of. Very tasty! Only 3 net carbs and 372 calories.  (edit) It might only be 2g carbs. I used Isopure Zero Carb protein, but off the top of my head I added 1g carb for it. Eggs do technically have a fraction of a carb. So... Maybe 2g but not more than 3g carbs."

But am happy to look on that as just a blip, and a chance to learn something...I'm still the same person who used to binge for months on end, I've done it once in 5 weeks, and by my old standards it was a tiny amount of food before I didn't want any more...I doubt i actually wanted ANY of it, I kinda think I was trying to sabotage my success so far, (loads of people have been telling me how good I look lately and although it's nice it feels a bit weird and cringey)... so that feels like a win, and am learning from that...  I had a counsellor once who suggested I should try to see how it felt to be successful at something, because I've always been an under-achiever, feeling most comfortable to sit in a place where I could tell myself how crap I am.

xxketo,3dkczk,psychic_mudkip,2,Fri Jul 17 11:15:08 2015 UTC,"Most can't believe it but it's to be expected. Weight gain is about food but for most it's much deeper, when you start losing, all of that deeper stuff comes to light for you to finally deal with, not easy but necessary and absolutely possible.   Yup, we can always wish the past was different but it is what it is and all of our experiences teach something if we are willing to listen.   The stumbles are part of the process, learn from them as that's key to making this lifelong change.  Make some plans for your weekend. It'll be hard without your daughter but embrace ""me"" time."

xxketo,3dkczk,Princess_OTS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:30:58 2015 UTC,"You're not bringing negativity.  We all have our setbacks and issues.  The fact that you ""binged"" only once in 5 weeks as opposed to nearly every day is...an amazing achievement.  This is why keto works.  Lowering carbs helps us to keep from binging (is not a 100% for some of us - but for many of us, a 90% cure is going to take the weight off slowly but surely).  Just as we gained weight, we lose it.  We have days where we eat too much or too little - but in the end, keto helps regulate appetite, fat storage, blood sugar drops/raises and so on.  And we can be rational (most of the time) about what we eat/drink.  Not to mention that eating eggs/eggwhites/mushrooms/cilantro/jalapeno omelette (cooked in 1 tsp butter) for breakfast, was so satisfying and filling.    Get yourself a keto treat (I picked up some good portugeuse sausage today - less than 1 g net carbs per serving) to make those omelettes even better.  Reward yourself for succeeding is my point (to counteract your desire to self-sabotage)."
xxketo,3dkczk,spicy-melons,3,Fri Jul 17 21:15:33 2015 UTC,Make a plan for staying keto for the next week. Plan out all your meals and then stick with it until you're back in your routine. Decide you're not going to do it again. There's nothing gained by undermining your plans and accomplishments.  Beware the slippery slope of one session of off-program eating turning into a trend. Get right back on that horse and plan for success! You can do it!

xxketo,3dgxb9,threeswordstyle,7,Thu Jul 16 09:14:26 2015 UTC,"I think op is making a custard ice cream here. Generally you boil a liquid, take it off the heat and let it cool just enough to whisk in egg yolks without scrambling them. It should still be warm enough to 'cook' the egg, but not hot enough to instantly scramble them before they've even incorporated in the mixture."
xxketo,3dgxb9,Track_01,2,Thu Jul 16 10:41:28 2015 UTC,Exactly this!
xxketo,3dgxb9,coconutterfly,3,Thu Jul 16 17:04:26 2015 UTC,Generally it's fine. I've been eating raw eggs since i was little without issue. I used to whisk it up with sugar!!!  I always wash my eggs and eat organic free range or get them from my farm. Not sure if that has an impact.
xxketo,3dgxb9,dessobick,2,Thu Jul 16 13:26:08 2015 UTC,"Great question! I probably should put an edit in the instruction, the cream mixture goes to just boiling. It is pretty warm still when you add it into the eggs, that's why you have to mix it in so slow. This warm mixture going in is supposed to make the eggs good to eat."

xxketo,3dgqnb,beans26,6,Thu Jul 16 03:32:08 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but someone's going to tell you to watch your potassium."
xxketo,3dgqnb,mllestrong,3,Thu Jul 16 04:53:56 2015 UTC,Your body will need time to adjust.  Switching from glucose to ketones for a fuel source will take time.  You will feel a bit more fatigued during workouts - but it does get better - SO much better! :)  Continue to work out - don't overdo it and try to push too hard through fatigue and cause an injury.  That's counterproductive. Monitor your electrolytes.  Magnesium can help take care of those muscle tingles and twitches.  Just be careful to up it gradually - too much magnesium can have a laxative effect.  Potassium and sodium are also important.  The FAQ's have great information on electrolyte management.
xxketo,3dgqnb,lecirca,2,Thu Jul 16 13:45:42 2015 UTC,"I'm on day 4 of keto.   Your body is now using free fatty acids and ketones as its primary fuel source. However, your muscles are still utilizing ketones in an effort to prevent them from building up in your system.  Over the next month or so most of your body tissue will adjust to burning fat as its primary fuel source. Once this happens you'll experience less of an issue while working out when it comes to fatigue/energy levels.  Beyond that, you must get enough sodium/potassium/magnesium to ensure your electrolyte balance is positive.  Beyond THAT... maybe you injured yourself and you are experiencing pain as a result of that.  Come back with more questions, please. You will need to sort this out to be successful on this diet."
xxketo,3dgqnb,DownhillYardSale,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:15:18 2015 UTC,"I am taking a potassium/magnesium supplement. The only difference about yesterday is that I took it in the  morning versus at night. I realized it helped with the fuzzy feeling in my head so I took it for work instead of in the evening. I haven't found anywhere that tells me the safe dose to take. I would take one in the morning and one in the evening if I find out it is safe.   I am now waking up and still feeling a bit ""off"". That's the only way I can describe it. But I hope getting some food and water in me will help that off feeling. Yesterday was a pretty heavy work out day so today I'm going to tone it down and see how I feel.   Thanks for the information. I will be back with more questions, I am sure of it."

xxketo,3de7cq,sekratchman,3,Wed Jul 15 16:04:04 2015 UTC,"Go you! That is half of the battle.  I had a similar thing.   Yesterday before dinner, our electric went out which meant we could not cook.  We decided to go to dinner even though were were only on day 2 of our Keto Diets.    We went to my favorite place (Chicken wings) where I usually load up on carb-y things but i kept it Keto and it was delicious.  A nice reminder that I don't have to give up the things I love for Keto.  I just have to adjust."
xxketo,3de7cq,TheCharmedLife,2,Wed Jul 15 16:20:43 2015 UTC,"Nice Job! Our day one was the A SUPER similar experience.   We got called to a dinner with friends last minute and decided to go, instead of the delicious burger and fries we usually have at our favorite place, we both stuck with dry rubbed chicken wings and a salad to share.   We can do this together!"

Order a single tall so it has only one shot of booze, but twice as much diet pop so it'll take you longer to drink it and you can pace yourself.   Jack and diet coke also works. Plain vodka (skip the flavored ones) and diet coke or diet sprite. Tequila and diet sprite is also quite tasty."
xxketo,3dg3fw,MadtownMaven,2,Thu Jul 16 00:46:38 2015 UTC,"I second this, and will add that if you're willing to take a little crystal light drink mix-in with you, those are very tasty with just liquor and water.  I like tequila with pretty much any flavor.  :)"

xxketo,3dg3fw,Plum51,2,Thu Jul 16 02:28:05 2015 UTC,I prefer a dry red wine and usually 1-2 glasses -- as it seems like the healthiest option and I'm on keto to get/stay healthy!

xxketo,3ddn0b,hellorhighwaterss,3,Wed Jul 15 17:16:27 2015 UTC,Isn't it interesting?  If I eat peanut butter I know instantly if it has sugar added and I just can't eat it.  I never knew there was a difference before.
xxketo,3ddn0b,CobhGirl3,3,Wed Jul 15 14:22:35 2015 UTC,"Seriously! I did this with my morning coffee about two weeks back. I hadn't gotten much sleep and was a total grump so I decided instead of my usual one teaspoon of agave, I was going back to one teaspoon of sugar. I had to pour the whole mug down the drain. It was WAY too sweet and was making me gag."
xxketo,3ddn0b,xklinx,3,Wed Jul 15 14:37:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, 90% chocolate was the most dramatic for me too. I couldn't take its bitterness in the past, but now anything less is overly sweet."

xxketo,3ddn0b,delillie,5,Wed Jul 15 21:21:18 2015 UTC,My favorite version of that is when I spit out a dill pickle because I was certain it was a sweet pickle.

xxketo,3dcmbk,LuminousRabbit,38,Wed Jul 15 05:41:10 2015 UTC,"I so identify with what you are talking about, OP. Food was, many times, the only thing I thought about or looked forward to. It was all of my emotions- reward, punishment, grief, joy, celebration, depression, everything all the time. I wanted to eat until I was sick constantly. I ate secretly. I remember going on fast food runs for friends or family and ordering an extra meal to eat in my car on the way to bring food back. I looked forward to being alone just so I could eat.   I remember being obsessed with making eating extremely pleasurable even in solitude. I would get food to binge on, and then make sure that I had taken care of everything to not be disturbed and to ""enjoy"" it as much as possible. It sounds weird, but I would make sure I didn't have to even pee a little before I would sit down and start binging- I didn't want anything to get in the way of the feeling of the binge.   Whenever my partner would start planning to go out of town for a business trip, I would start planning my grocery store run. I remember buying whole cakes and eating them in two days by myself, along with massive amounts of fast food.   Counting calories made things worse. I was able to lose weight, but I had to restrict to 1200 calories a day, which on low-fat diets feels impossibly hungry for me. I would spend literally all the time between meals focusing on what I was going to eat next, and how I was going to maximize my calories. I was obsessed with food.   Keto makes me feel like I have some control. I don't think about food constantly. I don't go back for third helpings. One of the things I noticed is that I don't need to make each meal a huge perfect production. I can eat a hard boiled egg or two over the sink in the morning on the way out the door, or grab a few pieces of cold chicken for dinner and I don't have to pee first. I still enjoy food. I still love to eat. But I don't feel like it has the same hold over me it used to.   Sometimes when I walk through the bakery section of the grocery store, I still feel uncontrollable. Like I just want to snatch up all the cookies and cakes and pies and shove them in my mouth as quickly as possible. But if I keep rolling through and don't pick anything up, staying keto is as simple as not buying the crap foods. The urges that come while I'm walking around, though, make me realize that the sugar has a huge pull over me.   I've never been one to buy into a lot of the alternative health fads, and the things I've seen on sugar being poison, etc., before have kind of felt like that to me. I used to think that the key was everything in moderation, I just could never get moderation down, which I thought was a huge failing on my part. But this has made me realize that I think the truth is, for me, I can't moderate sugar, like some people can't moderate alcohol or tobacco or drugs or whatever else. It is not a failing on my part, it's just a fact about my chemical, psychological, and emotional self that it is better to recognize rather than fight, because I will lose that fight. I am powerless over sugar and bread and carbs. I know that they will kill me if I let them. I just can't let them."
xxketo,3dcmbk,ketobento,10,Wed Jul 15 07:50:05 2015 UTC,"I can relate to this so much.  I never thought originally I had a problem with binge eating or overeating.  My weight will tell you otherwise.  I realized over the past few weeks my food addiction is out of control.  I wanted to say sugar addiction but it seems that its more than just that for me.  I got married June 20th.  Since then I've gained at least 10-15 pounds. In one month. LESS Than a month.  Its disgusting.  Whats even more disgusting is the fact that  seem to lack to ability to control myself around food.  I vividly remember my grandmother telling me as a child, ""You need to have self control"" (about everything).  Last week I found myself eating junk food crap from our work cafe. I wasn't hungry. I didn't feel the need to eat.  My brain just wouldn't stop telling me I needed it.  Originally I lost 50 pounds doing keto.  When I'm on it i'm on it. I'm good. Nothing can rock me.  But when I get off of it for a day or two I lose all ability to remember what keto has done for me.  Its tough because I keep thinking.. An alcoholic can just stop drinking, just move away from alcohol, a smoker can just stop--- they never have to have a cig ever again.  But food--- I have to have food to live.  It's not like I can just stop having food-- but I need to train my brain and my body to realize i need to use Food as fuel not to satisfy my emotional craving."
xxketo,3dcmbk,JuneBride,4,Wed Jul 15 11:30:29 2015 UTC,"Regarding your thoughts about needing food to live-something that's helped me is remembering I choose not to eat sugar, vs. I can't eat sugar. That small shift of moving away from can't to choosing not to has been huge for me because I have a very defiant part that bucks every diet attempt I have tried in the past, like OOH HOO HOO can't eat more than 1,200 calories today?  Watch me!  It's just relaxed that defiance so I'm not such an asshole to myself :)"
xxketo,3dcmbk,needathneed,5,Wed Jul 15 14:11:30 2015 UTC,"This way of thinking has made a huge difference for me.  I think about choosing not to eat carby foods instead of what I can't.

xxketo,3dcmbk,mylafantastik,8,Wed Jul 15 14:20:35 2015 UTC,"Thank God I'm working from home today your reply made me burst into tears. You've just described my exact relationship with food. Secret eating, not eating in front of others but hoarding food I could eat alone later is exactly my pattern. My partner goes away for the weekend once or twice a month and planning the carb binges before he goes is the process I go through.  I'm finding keto really hard to get past day one at the moment. I've done well on it in the past but I'm now only 7lbs away from my highest weight and I can't seem to get through the first few days. I pre plan, I make sure I have keto food around. Then something snaps and I'm knee deep in bread and chocolate hoping someone doesn't find out.  This week I thought would be better but we have a friend staying and my bf eats carbs so the house is full of stuff I can't resist. I got through Monday but yesterday was just a disaster and I'm trying so hard to make sure today isn't one as well.  I know keto does wonders for my binging I just need to get through the first week or so.   Sorry that turned into a longer post than I thought! Thank you for sharing."
xxketo,3dcmbk,tr1angles,4,Wed Jul 15 13:04:32 2015 UTC,"I have the same trouble getting past the first few days. I heard once that the first 4 days are the hardest, and after that something in your tastes/cravings actually changes. Obviously the desire is still there on some level, like OP said. I have started keto over and over and can't get to day 4. I did do keto for 2 weeks once and felt absolutly amazing! More energy, no pains where I used to have them, incredible mental allertness, no hunger pangs, hair, nails, skin and eyelashes looked awesome!   Today is the beginning of day 3 for me, again, and I actually woke up saying to myself ""Day three, onward!"" I feel strong this morning but it doesn't take much at all for me to fall and have nachos at lunch and then since I've already messed up the day I can just dig my hole deeper and have ice cream at dinner. I've been thinking I need an accountability buddy to help me along this path.   It is so weird seeing it described as an addiction because I know that even the time I went 2 weeks on keto, I fell off because I was just going to have one, JUST ONE, cheat meal. And that was all it took, I just stayed off keto, telling myself I could get back on tomorrow, tomorrow....tomorrow. That was in March. :( So it's just like an alcohol or cigarette addiction. ""Hello, my name is Wandering_thru and I'm adicted to carbs......""  Edited for clarity."
xxketo,3dcmbk,Wandering_thru,6,Wed Jul 15 14:14:06 2015 UTC,"You're not alone. I re-started keto about 8 times before I finally ""got it""."
xxketo,3dcmbk,thedazzler,5,Wed Jul 15 14:49:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, those 4 days were torture for the physical part.  The second week was hard for me psychologically.   That's when my inner battle get trying to get me back to the dark side.    By the third week, it started getting much better."
xxketo,3dcmbk,Wendyland78,3,Wed Jul 15 15:12:23 2015 UTC,"Yes. yes. yes! You've described my dysfunctional relationship with food perfectly. I can relate to all of what you've written. It's nice to knowing you're not alone.   I don't think about food constantly. I don't need to make each meal a huge perfect production. I can eat a hard boiled egg or two over the sink in the morning on the way out the door.   These are definitely my favourite benefits of Keto thus far!  On Keto, food is a lot simpler. I eat simple things that I like eating. Serving of meat with a mass of vegetables. Simple. I eat a massive salad every day for lunch and enjoy it so much. And while there are still times I emotionally obsess about food, many times I enjoy eating just for the sake of getting fuel.   I am relieved that I no longer feel like I need to escape into seclusion so I can eat and eat until I'm physically ill. But when I'm idle and alone, I still get anxious and struggle, particularly during the evenings and weekends. Sometimes I'll try taking a bath, hitting the gym, going for a walk, generally keeping myself busier so that I don't fall back into binge eating habits. But it still happens."
xxketo,3dcmbk,inertia-,2,Wed Jul 15 15:01:38 2015 UTC,"So much of this resonated with me.  I also have to super restrict my calories to lose weight, and this was a nightmare on the SAD.  I remember miserably counting that I wouldn't be able to eat for 5 or 6 hours after lunch, back when I was a student and practically lived at school.  I was always hungry, and I thought the same thing about sugar- I just had problems moderating it; if I could do that, I'd be fine.  It's freaky to me, reading through these posts and realizing how many of us have been out there suffering, mostly in silence."
xxketo,3dcmbk,Red5446,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:47:57 2015 UTC,"Amen and Amen. ""Moderation"" got me here, 40 and 200 lbs.   And your discussion of binging is so spot on it gives me shivers. Ever been walked in on mid-binge? It makes my stomach churn to think about it."
xxketo,3dcmbk,rilkewatts,13,Thu Jul 16 18:51:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for opening up a tough conversation.   Keto has also killed my binging. I feel like I was living meal to meal, hit to hit  during a three month depression that preceded my starting keto.   Binging, for me, started when I was 16 and put on Prednisone for Crohns disease. The side effects include a damning combination of insatiable hunger and insomnia. I gained sixty pounds in three months.   Lost that weight (slowly) but continued binging. Sometimes purging, other times restricting. That cycle lasted through my twenties.   After a trauma in 2011, I went into a six month depression. Work, eat myself into oblivion, sleep, repeat. I moved to a new city to heal and did a lot of work on myself. Not only the trauma but also my body image and relationship with food. That forty pounds came off a bit faster.   So here I am losing a significant amount of weight for the third time in my life. This time my body has changed because of pregnancy. I am at peace with my softer parts and stretch marks but I want to be strong. Most of all, I want to set a strong example for my daughter. Mamahood has empowered me to better our lives in a way I never was able to do for myself. I can now set healthy boundaries and cut toxic relationships/patterns I don't want her to grow up around.   Today was my 46th day of eating this way and I feel like I have all of this extra mental energy that used to be wasted on self loathing and controlling food."
xxketo,3dcmbk,beesyrup,9,Wed Jul 15 07:08:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. I'm sorry you went through a trauma as well--same year as me. I hope you've been able to get support.  It's amazing how kids change you. Much of this I'm doing for my son too. My husband and I both have food issues--and both our sets of parents do too. I'm doing my damnest to get the ""nurture"" part of it addressed. The ""nature"" is already stacked against him. Your daughter is lucky to have you. We need strong mothers now more than ever.   Good job doing 46 days. Here's to 47 and beyond."
xxketo,3dcmbk,Red5446,9,Wed Jul 15 07:22:04 2015 UTC,"Can relate to all this and it's good for me to remember I'm not the only one.  I grew up with people who were overeaters, who used food as reward and comfort and punishment.  I was skinny as a rod until about age 10, they even called me Slim until then.  Then I started gaining weight and started my own sick relationship with food and obsession with my body.  Then came overexercising.  By age 14 came bulimia and I got down to 96 lbs.  By age 16 bulimia had turned to a cyclical, occasional thing and I was just overeating all the time and only purging when I felt I had really gone overboard.  At 22 I was diagnosed with a non-specific eating disorder by a psychiatrist whom I then completely ignored. At 29 I found Atkins and lost 40 lbs and then returned to carbs and quickly put it all back on.  At 36 I got involved with Greysheeters Anonymous (an offshoot of Overeaters Anonymous) and following their low carb food plan without a single exception; lost 85 lbs in 11 months. Particularly difficult life events happened and I again returned to using food to manage my emotions.  Four years ago I got into therapy to deal with an anxiety disorder, depression and C-PTSD.  I don't want to have all these goddamn difficulties but I do have them, there is no denying that.  Throughout those 4 years I have attempted to return to using the greysheet independent of the fellowship (I'm pretty much a rabid hater of the 12 step fellowships - the fellowships, not their true process devoid of the interpretations of idiots).  I kept going back to my old bingeing ways and back in March 2015 I decided to give keto a shot.  I did really well the first two months, stuck to the three meals a day the greysheet got me so used to. I lost 36 lbs and felt great.  Then I stopped really looking at all my emotional issues or addressing them at all and started to go off the rails a bit with alcohol binges and finally went entirely off plan for this post entire weekend.  The binge sucked, I found no comfort and no enjoyment in the food.  Now here I am on Day 3 again after a hellacious binge on carbs over the weekend.  I do really well when I stick exactly to the plan, do not exceed macros, do not snack and just do it.  I don't believe by any stretch of the imagination that I am in any way, shape or form ""powerless"" over food.  I have all the power, it's what I choose to do with that power that decides how I do in my day to day life.  I can choose to be lazy and not deal with life and just check out using food or booze, or I can choose to sit through difficult shit, practice new methods of coping, patience and accepting my reality or doing things to change it.  I don't always make the right choice and I have decades of habit to overcome on a daily basis.  But I'm finally on the right track."

xxketo,3dcmbk,phoenix2fire,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:14:15 2015 UTC,"It takes a lot of courage to admit all that, especially the lack of comfort in a binge. It sucks, especially mid-process. I'm so proud of you for reigning it in and coming back. Take care of yourself, and feel free to PM me anytime. I've got GAD, what my therapist called ""double-depression"" (chronic dysmythia (sp?) and periodic major depression), and PTSD on top of it. I can relate. Keto has reduced all of those by about 90%."
xxketo,3dcmbk,terraping,2,Thu Jul 16 18:33:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  Keto really helps reduce the symptoms of my anxiety and other things to a large degree.  Exercise is really helping also.  It was very sad when I was bingeing and not only did I hate it, but really saw how it really hurts me.  My old main coping mechanism, my old best friend food hasn't worked to help me in a long, long time and I think I'm only just realizing that on an emotional and not just intellectual level now.   Thanks for your OP, it's a really good one."
xxketo,3dcmbk,Crystalcorals,8,Thu Jul 16 20:04:50 2015 UTC,"Keto has given me the ability to not bindge. The longer i stay on it, the eaiser it is to walk down the chip isle. I lost weight on keto before. Went from a size 22 to a size 14 in 5 months. It was great. I felt great. I got pregnant and half way through i went off keto. Anyways. Once the baby was born and we had many long nights the only thing that seemed to help was carbs. If have long periods of time of not eating and then id bindge on two wendys burgers. Or noodles. Or perogies. Or kraft dinner. Easy. Shitty carbs and i felt like shit, and the only thing that would get through the day was the thought that i could have some muffins or toast or shit. Now that im back on keto, weighing myself this time, and logging everything into mfp, it has been a lot easier. No giant fast food bindges. Ive had a few slips, but i log them and move on. But i love keto. I am able to make so many healthier choices. Cheese and cucumbers over chips, zucchini noodles over pasta. These are my accomplishments. The weightloss is just secondary."
xxketo,3dcmbk,JuneBride,6,Wed Jul 15 07:42:39 2015 UTC,"Yes that damned chip aisle! I could almost never walk past it without grabbing a bag of nachos or salt and vinegar chips. And then I'd scoff the whole bag while watching a movie. Ugh.  I am eternally grateful for the fact that I can know happily walk past that aisle feeling... nothing.   I still have binge cravings that I am trying to correct slowly. It'll take time to get away from abusing food as an emotional crutch, but in the meantime binging on fat is helping because I just cannot eat that much. And it's not for a lack of trying! The pms binging has been impressive, I won't lie."
xxketo,3dcmbk,JuneBride,7,Wed Jul 15 09:47:09 2015 UTC,"As a binge eater myself,  I would like to ask how did you start keto and stay on track.  I can't just throw away food and keep it keto friendly, because I live with my dad who buys food for him and my brother.  I also work in a bakery.  It's very hard to avoid temptation at home mostly though. Like when he cooks tator tots or orders pizza. I have a very hard time avoiding cake too.  I could be on track  for about 4 days then I screw up.  Also breakfast is a huge issue because I am very tired in the mornings and hate coooking, and I also really don't enjoy eggs alone they make me feel naseous now because I had them every morning for two months when I actually lost weight a year ago . But that was horrible because I ate eggs and tuna  daily.   Pardon my  rambling.  It's hard for me to just start and stay on track to keep going.  It seems like no matter what I'm doing I'm anyways failing.  Advice?"
xxketo,3dcmbk,fivecentpsychiatrist,8,Wed Jul 15 07:22:05 2015 UTC,"I'll probably post a few little responses to this because I keep thinking of things. First, be gentle with yourself. It's a huge lifestyle change and it takes time. I did several false starts before I was able to stick to it.  I meant every word I said up there about ""drugs"". Your body responds to carbs by lighting up your brain's pleasure centres in very similar ways to actual drug use. Easy carbs makes perfect sense for a species that evolved with an unstable food supply. It's going to reward you hard for eating that stuff. But each attempt is a little bit of rewiring you're doing. And I promise it gets easier--maybe about a month in for me it was suddenly just how I ate. But lord, about day 5-10 or so? Forget it. I hated everything. I was a bitch too.   My suggestion is to get as much support as you can. I live in a carby household too. I think it's great that some people can just toss out everything and start over, but for a great many of us, living in a carb-vacuum just ain't gonna happen. Do you have anyone in real life who supports you in this? I didn't at first, so I lurked for hours on here and the keto subreddit.   Also, forget perfect. Yes, sometimes I still eat a bite of my son's pasta or a rice cracker. I am NOT perfect. But I'm going in the right direction. I figure every carb that I cut out is a win. It's all progress in the right direction.   Breakfast: I often just eat leftovers. I've never been crazy about eggs all the time either. Oh, and I often now eat a slice of a high fat, high protein cheesecake (made from an ancient Atkins cookbook I found at a used book sale) with a cup of coffee.   *Edit: forgot ""brain"" Go figure. Also added the perfectionism bit."
xxketo,3dcmbk,whoamithistime,4,Wed Jul 15 07:32:09 2015 UTC,I like this Comment--- Its true. I dont have to be perfect at the beginning... as long as i have more steps in the right direction than in the wrong i'm doing okay... Yesterday I slipped a little but It wasn't a total loss.

xxketo,3dcmbk,needathneed,2,Thu Jul 16 18:39:43 2015 UTC,"It's from Dr Atkins' New Diet Cookbook from 1994.   16 ounces cream cheese at room tempreture 3 eggs 1 cup creme fraiche or sour cream 1/2 vanilla bean, scraped (I used vanilla extract.) 12 packets sugar substitute (I've used a combo of xylitol, erythritol, and liquid stevia. Tried 1/4 cup each of the first two and 1/2 tsp of the last. Still playing with it. Not very sweet.)   Preheat oven to 350 F. Place all ingredients in a blender and blend for 15 minutes. (I don't have one so I just used a mixer). Place in a pan of hot water in oven. If water evaporates during baking, add more hot water as needed. Bake for 1 hour, turn off oven and leave cake in oven 1 hour more. Total grams 33, grams per serving 2.8.  My notes: Those numbers above seem to refer to net carbs. This was in the days of saccharine and aspartame, so you'll probably want to run the numbers with your sweetener of choice. I've done it like this (sans crust) and it's pretty good. It's very dense and not at all too sweet. I like it because it is very low carb and I can therefore have it often. It nukes my cravings for other sweets. Also good if you reserve some batter and add cocoa powder and swirl it in to make a marble cheesecake.  If you want to or can afford the carbs, add your favourite keto pie crust--and then send me the recipe for it, because I haven't found one I really like yet. :)  *edit: add additional blathering."

I might mix in some cinnamon this time to get it a little more graham-ish. I haven't experimented yet with a doughy pie-crust but the almond meal has the right texture for me."
xxketo,3dcmbk,Red5446,10,Fri Jul 17 10:31:16 2015 UTC,If you can stick to strict keto for 2 weeks you will lose a lot of the temptation and cravings for carbs and sugar. Just cut it all off cold turkey. I fully believe that sugar is addictive and keto forces you to detox. I have a pantry full of carbs from my pre-keto days and I've been keto for almost 2 months now with zero cheating other than a tiny bit of fruit here and there.
xxketo,3dcmbk,Chicky587,2,Wed Jul 15 08:01:47 2015 UTC,It definitely gets easier with time.
xxketo,3dcmbk,needathneed,2,Wed Jul 15 14:13:39 2015 UTC,"As others have said, most of us have a bumpy start.  That's totally ok.  I learned something from each start.  What worked for me this time was taking my time to do a lot of planning.  I made lists of my favorite keto friendly meals.  I had plans for what I would do in situations that I knew would come up.  Like family events and work events.   I found several fast food places nearby and looked at their menu to plan what I could eat if I don't feel like cooking.  I had a couple ketofied sweet recipes that I could eat when my kids were having a treat.     Sometimes I have to do some mental tricks with myself and I'm becoming quite good at distraction.   i didn't let myself fantasize about food.  If the thought popped in my mind, I thought about something else or I would think bad things about that food.  I would get angry at the cupcake in the store and say, mentally, ""you made me fat and sick.  You are a jerk cupcake.  I want to smoosh you"".  It sounds dumb but it worked for me.  I started to change how I felt about those foods.   After a few weeks, the foods started having less of a draw for me.  At the six week mark, I had a bite of a Reese's cup.  It tasted gross and way too sweet.     Also, take care of yourself.  I treated myself good and was mentally prepared that it was going to be hard at first, but there was light at the end of the tunnel."
xxketo,3dcmbk,Chicky587,7,Wed Jul 15 15:31:10 2015 UTC,"I am so glad I am not the only one with food issues! I have a loooong history of an eating disorder. I spent many years in inpatient care. In recent years it's been like I have suddenly ""discovered"" food after not allowing myself to eat it for so long. I fell into a binge purge cycle which lead to a massive weight gain. I literally went from being incredibly underweight to over weight. In this time I also had an accident which resulted in my being a paraplegic so has been a huge adjustment. I have always used food to deal with everything and I constantly worry about this. I know I need to find different coping methods but nothing seems to give me the ""hit"" that food does. I am struggling to stick to keto but I feel like it is something that could really help me. However I also worry about falling into old habits. As soon as I start tracking the food I eat my anxiety goes a million miles an hour towards ""you f*cking ate how much today?! What are you?! You are worthless....."" And it goes on. So it's a really fine line for me between tracking healthily and becoming obsessed.  Sorry this is really long and rambling but I just wanted to say thanks for bringing this up and I now feel way less alone in this struggle!"
xxketo,3dcmbk,Chicky587,2,Wed Jul 15 08:23:26 2015 UTC,"Wow, your stuggle has been huge.  hugs How long have you been ketoing?  Are other people making the food you are eating?  Having others do that stuff for me would cause super anxiety, just like omg are they doing it the right way, what is the carb content etc."
xxketo,3dcmbk,Zephyrine_93,3,Wed Jul 15 14:16:30 2015 UTC,Thanks and hugs back at you x I have only been doing keto for about a month but have fallen off the track quite a few times in that month. I do all the cooking at home but quite often my partner will come home with pizza or other takeaways. I really need to focus on sticking to keto regardless of what is going on but I find the days when I come home exhausted and in pain the hardest when I have no energy to cook.  Thanks for listening to me vent!
xxketo,3dcmbk,Spiffy-Tiffy,2,Wed Jul 15 19:14:12 2015 UTC,"I think everyone struggles at the beginning of keto, so don't beat yourself up!  You're not alone in that either.  :)  If you want some input:  something that really helped me when I was a noob at keto was having food prepped.  I don't do well having tons of snacky foods around, because I will overeat them, but having casserole-type dishes in the freezer to just nuke up at will was really helpful.  It's great for busy lifestyles- you can build up a bank of dishes in the freezer from cooking one or two dishes a week.  It helps to stick to keto without losing your mind over every meal.  It gets way easier with time to avoid the takeout and such too.  Hope this helps, and vent away- that's what we're here for!"

I think the fact that you cook is pretty cool!! I bet it can be super difficult though, like as you say coming home tired and then having to do all that.  I try to make a bunch of meals ahead of time for this very reason!! Are you opposed to left overs?  It's such a relief to come home and not have to cook 3/4 days out of the week!

In my 15s I was starving myself to a point that I would almost pass out. In my 18s I was so chubby I hated going out, and I was cutting myself. Two years ago I decided to change mylife, lost alot of weight, started working out, running, eating better, etc. Someone recently told me ""I think deep down, you are still that shy cubby girl"" and he was damn right. I've failes to love myself since I can remember, no matter of the weight and size. I have a fucked up relationship with food. I feel guilty whenever I'm full. if I mess something up, like an exam or a relationship or something, I would skip my meals, becase eating in a middle of a crisis makes me feel stupid and guilty. Then I'd binge. And purge. Guess you know that feel. I hope you don't though.   My fave binge foods are fruit and nut butters. Keto has made it clear that I'm not gonna have a massive amount of them around, so I have less things in the frudge to binge on. I can binge on anything though. But for somereson when I'm stuffing my face with cream cheese I have a WAY easier time telling my self to stop. A binge is still a binge, but my ""fuck it"" moments have reduced since starting Keto and they don't last as long.  I've started therapy a few weeks ago, Probably gonna take meds.   I hope it gets better. I'm enjoying keto, no doubt in that but I don't like the fact that I've cut out a food because I can't eat in moderation. It's supid. But for now it's working and I'm feeling better and I guess that's what it's all about; feeling better."
xxketo,3dcmbk,inertia-,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:00:40 2015 UTC,"I can so relate to what you say here. I was overeating last night on brussels sprouts of all things.

I'm off the now, but I never would have gotten through the last 5 years without them.   I tried moderation for 40 years and it got me to 200+ pounds. I can't eat that stuff. I am like an addict."

xxketo,3dcmbk,mylafantastik,8,Fri Jul 17 00:18:19 2015 UTC,"Reading these comments is almost painful it's so familiar. I started bingeing when I had a serious bout of depression in my early twenties along with some other self-harming activities. I mostly got over everything but kept the bingeing as my go-to emotional coping mechanism. I've always been a comfort eater for sure, but things got way out of control and just weirder and more extreme, and all that coupled with the weight gain made me feel so ashamed. I haven't been doing keto for that long but I've already definitely found it reduces the urge a bit and I feel more in control of what I eat. I kind of knew but never fully appreciated until starting keto how goddamn addictive carbs are! I still have a long way to go and to be honest I'm worried my relationship with food will never be normal, but it feels good to find something that's helped for the first time."
xxketo,3dcmbk,needathneed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:03:31 2015 UTC,"It is really familiar, isn't it? I feel like food issues are so prevalent amongst women because it's a socially acceptable outlet. My parents wouldn't let me READ FOR FUN but I could eat all the junk I wanted? Seriously?"
xxketo,3dcmbk,ketocurious193,8,Thu Jul 16 18:42:34 2015 UTC,"On a slightly related note, though not exactly the same.. Keto has significantly reduced my urge to purge.  I've never been diagnosed with bulimia, I've hidden it decently well and really only purged when I've eaten 'bad foods' likes sugar or heavy loaded carb items.  There was never really an official binging part to the whole thing, just eating items that made me feel crappy about myself after eating.    Since keto, as long as I eat the LCHF foods, I feel great.  Not bloated, not psychological guilt that builds and builds until the only thing that will help me feel better is getting the food out of my body.  Plus, I'm losing weight, so double bonus :D"

I don't get the sickening guilt and need to purge after. I just get so satisfied  and full quicker! Last night I got a little wasted and went to the kitchen for carbs(I wanted something easy and microwavable)...I ate some beets out of a can and some cheddar instead.  I'm so glad I didn't wake up to guilt."

When I carb, I still binge. And regret it almost instantly but still continue for that day.

xxketo,3dcmbk,needathneed,7,Thu Jul 16 18:37:41 2015 UTC,"i'm worried keto has, not made it worse, but like masked or normalised it?  Before, on carbs, like a lot of people here my life was food. Planning meals was like a hobby, people would ask 'what are you up to today' and i'd reply 'oh nothing, boring day at home' but actually i was planning and getting really excited the two pastries, giant subway sandwich and family sized packet of crisps I was going to buy for lunch (I'd also buy even more on impulse in the store), with grapes and other fruit as snacks and then my big take-away chinese meal shortly after. I could make myself feel ill and just deny it was what I ate, I just had weird digestive issues. I'd do the same the next day because the hunger just never ended with sugar.   Keto's killed my appetite, but it hasn't killed these impulses for me. I still buy things impulsively. I don't get upset or annoyed if I can't eat something I'd planned (it used to drive me insane until I could finally eat and overeat it), but obviously I plan pretty meticulously and am allowed to be more insistent we stick to my plan because it's not a shameful 2000 calorie binge, it's my healthy lifestyle.   And the binges still happen, oh not as often and probably not as unhealthily or as calorifically. But I still justify them, I can't not eat whole containers of things so if I eat an entire packet of salami I impulsively bought I look at the calories and then, because keto has killed my appetite, I don't eat for the rest of the day, or sometimes the day after to mitigate the disaster of the binge.  But I haven't actually stopped binging, I just don't eat as much during it and I can mitigate it by my eating afterwards. I mean, maybe a 600kcal pack of salami doesn't 'count' as a binge in the traditional sense, but the emotions, the impulse, the driving force behind eating it is exactly the same.   I don't know how to deal with this honestly.   Keto has definitely reduced the role food plays in my life, bizarrely I used to feel very restricted with food because I have allergies. Now I've cut out even more food but I care less about what I'm missing out on. It's improved the obssession, the planning, the making myself ill, the physical health - but I think it's only treated the behaviour by allowing mitigation and reducing the presence of some 'triggers' - but it's definitely all still there. I haven't gained the self control to not purchase food I suddenly want. I haven't gained the self control to not eat the whole packet. Keto just allows me to get away with it without the consequence of stomach issues and weight gain :/"
xxketo,3dcmbk,bobaimee,6,Wed Jul 15 11:59:15 2015 UTC,"I can really relate to what you've written. Last night I sat myself down with a spoon and ate half a jar of peanut butter. Nuts, nut butters and cheese are definitely triggers for me. I've successfully cut out things like quest bars which are also a trigger. But foods that are seemingly 'okay' and 'keto' tend to sneak back into my pantry over time and I overeat them.  The frequency of my binging has decreased by a LOT, but like you, it's still a challenge for me. I had a binge-free streak for a while but I've recently faced a minor romantic rejection and -- lo and behold, I've begun binging like a mad woman for the last 2 weeks. It's helpful for me to realize the emotional / environmental triggers of binging. I realize when I am feeling insecure and/or lonely, it's a trigger for binging.   I've also had some success in removing the trigger foods from my household (like the aforementioned Quest bars). But inevitably, a few weeks will pass and I'll decide, 'What's the harm in purchasing a jar of PB? it's on sale!"" and I'll have a night like last night. Keeping trigger foods at work seems to help me as well. I've brought the jar of PB to the office today where it will live in the cupboard and I'll have the occasional TBSP as an afternoon snack. As long as I'm not alone while eating them, these foods become 'safe'.  **It's about progress, not perfection. And I think the process of becoming aware of our selves, our choices and our actions rather than mindlessly stuffing our faces day in and day out is the key.   It's not a miracle cure but Keto has restored my hope that overcoming this challenge is possible.**"

xxketo,3dcmbk,bobaimee,2,Wed Jul 15 22:56:51 2015 UTC,"I very much relate to this. This might sound unhelpful, but just making the choice to change and recognizing that you want those behaviors to change can be really helpful. It won't fix things overnight (I still have a lot of the problems you mentioned, but they're much better than they were 6 months ago), but it will help soften your feelings surrounding the problem behaviors. Remember that one of the reasons we overeat is self-soothing--it's a misguided attempt at self-care. Keto has helped take the danger out of those impulses, now what soothing things can we do to replace them?  Keep loving yourself exactly where you are and give yourself time. I do believe it can get better for all of us!"

As long as it's working though, I'm ok with a slower progression if it means it will stick!"
xxketo,3dcmbk,Red5446,3,Wed Jul 15 14:24:11 2015 UTC,"it's nearly a year now. The frequency of the binges has definitely decreased, but I wonder how much of that is more the lack of 'triggering' food or loss of appetite, rather than a psychological change. When the circumstances are right it still happens pretty flawlessly (I think of a food I'd like and can get, or am a little hungry in the presence of food I'd like) - just those circumstances are really infrequent because no appetite and no food cravings"
xxketo,3dcmbk,mylafantastik,2,Wed Jul 15 14:29:45 2015 UTC,"Not to diminish your worries, but substantively, does it really matter if it's the physiological causes leading to reduced bingeing? In my case, I pretty much feel like I'm never going to have a normal relationship with food- there are some pretty well established habits and associations and emotional responses I don't even know how to deal with. But the reduced frequency and lower impact have a great effect on my mental health. Low carb seems to create the physical environment for me not to binge, even though I still have that in me. So I'm just happy at the advances I've made from a few months ago - at the moment it still feels like victory enough."
xxketo,3dcmbk,beesyrup,2,Wed Jul 15 14:46:46 2015 UTC,"for me it just feels kind of like a whitewash? Like those issues are definitely there but rather than dealing with them I've found a way to largely avoid them, in the long run I worry that that will manifest unhealthily - either I'll relapse badly, pick up new terrible behaviours, impose my food crazies onto future children etc. I don't know, I guess for me the 'journey' is as important as the results - sure I binge less and am phyically healthier, but I'm still messed up with food and that's not being dealt with it's being avoided :/ I guess to me it would be like getting liposuction instead of dieting/exercise - sure the result is I'm skinnier but I haven't addressed why I needed to make the change in the first place"
xxketo,3dcmbk,needathneed,2,Wed Jul 15 17:20:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm definitely worried about passing on weird food issues to my kids because I know my mother did it to me, albeit completely unintentionally. I don't really know how to address it, to be honest. But it does feel a bit comforting to know I'm not the only one."
xxketo,3dcmbk,Red5446,2,Thu Jul 16 02:21:55 2015 UTC,"Would you consider that an improvement then?  I don't want to discount the fact that ok, the opportunities are less but also you are a big part of that by not bringing that stuff into your space!  It sounds like you are actively trying to avoid times when those circumstances are just right, which I would totally consider a legit improvement!"
xxketo,3dcmbk,needathneed,2,Wed Jul 15 21:38:46 2015 UTC,"Well... no? I'm not actively avoiding the circumstances,  keto just stops them from happening because I'm not hungry and don't get cravings. There's nothing coming from me there other than staying keto which I'll  agree is good in general and I'm proud of that,  but seems largely separate from the binge behaviours and,  as I said earlier,  may even mask them as I am now able to binge with no negative repercussions. It happens rarely but there's little incentive to 'try' not to when it does because I know I'll feel ok and can just not eat the next day"
xxketo,3dcmbk,blueeyestunned,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:54:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, I see your point, but I think that that's the first step in finally healing this. I don't get the hit in my brain anymore and that lets me have a bit of breathing space, the space to make a change if I want to. Sometimes, I don't. Sometimes I still pull the fuck it card, but I don't feel so driven to do it."
xxketo,3dcmbk,needathneed,6,Thu Jul 16 18:35:54 2015 UTC,"I'm a lifelong binge eater and sometimes bulimic. I have not tried the keto diet yet though I want to.   I know I have a food addiction, and much of it is due to the abuse and neglect I suffered in my childhood, and the fact that I inherited an addictive personality from my parents who were drug addicts and eventually died from their addictions. I don't want to follow in their footsteps. I would like to try keto but I live with other people which complicates things and I think my depression holds me back. I live with other people and I have to buy food for everyone, which includes carbs. Since my funds are limited its hard to just buy keto type stuff. By then end of the month there is usually only a jar of peanut butter and bread around the house.  Since you deal with mental health issues, have you tried mindfulness and meditation? It's helped me a lot, and I have all sorts of problems."
xxketo,3dcmbk,needathneed,2,Wed Jul 15 08:45:09 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, having that keto side effect of feeling really full really quick and the binging not being as rewarding allows that space for reflection of 'hmm, do I really want to be doing this?'  So while I've tried to be more mindful in my body, having that built in stop gap has helped me as well to realize what I'm doing and be able to take the few seconds to make  decision.  Sometimes it really is 'yep, gonna eat this whole lb of bacon' and sometimes it's 'naw, I'm all set I'll stop eating.'  We all support you if you do want to try keto, feel free to PM me if you'd like!! oxo"

My BF is at school all day and we live in a new city so I don't have much to fill my time with; i'm starting school soon though so I'm hoping that will help me with my boredom/grazing.

xxketo,3dfob4,TallToria,3,Wed Jul 15 22:15:55 2015 UTC,"how do you find variety for those mid-day snack urges?   Most don't snack much on keto as most snacking is habit or a byproduct of a high carb diet and keto will allow you to break that habit.  For now, eat to satiety but try to address the habit - good snack ideas - boiled eggs, canned fish, avocado, jerky, pork rinds, cheese, nuts    I can easily devour a ridiculous amount of cheese or nuts so especially I'm trying to find alternatives to those two!   Common domino foods. Beware, weigh or don't eat.  Honestly I would skip the snacks and if you're hungry enough for a snack, make a meal"
xxketo,3dfob4,anbeav,2,Wed Jul 15 22:39:54 2015 UTC,"Hi and welcome! You'll probably eventually reach the point where your appetite is really suppressed and you won't need to snack - I only mention that because I want to make sure you're snacking because you're actually hungry and not because you're used to eating between meals or because you have an ""urge."" I'm about 3 weeks in and my appetite is so suppressed that I'm not eating between meals at all. Making sure you're eating plenty (PLENTY!) of fat will help with this.   When I do though, my favorite snack is probably pork rinds. They're quick and filling but they're not SO delicious that they trigger my OMG GOOD FOOD MUST EAT IT ALL impulses."
xxketo,3dfob4,stefanielaine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:22:10 2015 UTC,Thanks - I'm only on Day Two so hopefully I'll loose the snacking urge in a few more days. Love the turkey jerky idea and Baby Bels. And - yes - I weigh everything but otherwise I can fool myself very easily!

xxketo,3dfob4,Wendyland78,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:57:42 2015 UTC,"I really like turkey jerky for a snack -- it's yummy, but not too yummy and I get full at about 1-2 oz in, which usually adds up to 70-140 calories.  This is only a good snack is you're having trouble hitting your protein goals. With keto, you don't want to go over your protein goals, but you do need to hit them.  Baybel cheese is also great for me since it's packaged in ~1oz portions, which keeps me mindful of how much I'm eating."
xxketo,3dfob4,delillie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:05:48 2015 UTC,"I was more snacky when I first started, but not as much now.   If I don't eat enough at a meal, I will get hungry before my next meal.  I'll usually try to make the snack substantial like 10 almonds, a hunk of summer sausage, and some cheese.   Or a cup of hot tea with some heavy cream."
xxketo,3dfob4,veralynn88,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:52:24 2015 UTC,I give myself about 100-150 calories for snack per day. Sometimes I get hungry and I eat it between lunch and dinner. If I don't then it becomes dessert and I have some halo top ice cream or dark chocolate.   I used to snack constantly before keto. Be open to the idea that it might be habit at this point or emotional eating and that you may not need to snack as much as you used to.
xxketo,3dfob4,yumyumfat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:23:55 2015 UTC,"Absolutely right, I am an emotional eater. And the snacking is often out of boredom, or nerves, or whatever. I'm on Day 46 of my quest (the first 43 were just calorie reduction/exercise so this is Day 3 of keto) and I have noticed my snacking urges and my over-eating urges are diminishing but I still have the habit of wandering into the kitchen when I shouldn't.  I think your idea will work for me. Thanks."
xxketo,3debyy,nursejessika,5,Wed Jul 15 16:37:17 2015 UTC,"I started my weight loss journey June 1st. Yesterday I joined this forum and switched to keto. However, for the past 44 days I have been averaging exercise 5 days a week.  I do different things - treadmill, stair climber, walks.  My goal has been that when I hit 20 lbs lost (which SHOULD have happened by NOW but I've hit a major plateau) I am going to add yoga and biking.  I can tell you that my legs are toning up and much more importantly, I find I walk straighter, sit straighter, and move more confidently. It's as though I'm ""in touch"" with my body again. Also - I have ZERO desire for crappy food - and I'm sure that has as much to do with the exercise as it does with the dieting.  Important note: even though I have stopped losing weight quickly - I'm fitting into clothes I haven't worn in two years and every day they fit a little better - so the scale is ABSOLUTELY not the whole story!!! I strongly suggest that you start by the following (1) Buy some REALLY good shoes for doing work outs. Your feet are critical in how you feel when exercising (2) buy at least one outfit that is your dedicated exercise outfit that breathes easily and that you are comfortable wearing so when you put it on, that's what you're doing and you feel good about it (3) start SLOW - don't do too much at the start or you can injure yourself and then not be able to carry on. Maybe a 20-30 minute brisk walk every day for a week? Maybe find stairs in your routine that you use instead of an escalator/elevator?  Do it every day faithfully for 7-10 days and then up your challenge every week. I think you'll be very pleased to find that after 20-25 days you find what was once an effort comes easily and feels GOOD! Good luck and well done!"
xxketo,3debyy,TallToria,2,Wed Jul 15 17:33:00 2015 UTC,"I've been keto for around 4 months? I just started Ice Cream Fitness 5x5 3 weeks ago and I lost a pound, gained a pound and haven't weighed yet this week. I should've taken measurements but didn't, oh well. I have not yet started adding in cardio, but likely will as this is a MWF routine. I like it a lot so far."
xxketo,3debyy,purplemoosefarts,2,Wed Jul 15 18:15:04 2015 UTC,"My weight loss has practically stopped since I started lifting weights June 1, but I have lost about half a pants size.  I have a long history of bloating up BAD once I start any exercise regime, so I expected it and swore I'd stick with it this time instead of giving up.  I waited until I dropped almost 2 pants sizes to start exercising so when I bloated up a size or two, which I did at first, I wouldn't need bigger clothes during that time.  It took about a full month for the water retention to go away.  June 1st I was 185.6, I bounced all the way up into the 190.2 for a long time before coming back down.

xxketo,3debyy,bloodsponge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:47:53 2015 UTC,Not totally related but just some encouragement. Right now I'm 201lbs. I have been this weight before (well 205 but close enough) and there was this pair of jeans I couldn't barely button. Gained from 205 to 250 (ugh). Thats when I started keto. Before when I was at 205 I got there with Medifast (do NOT recommend obv) and no working out AT ALL. This time with keto I have lifted heavy the entire time and have been training for a triathlon. That same pair of jeans I had to give away because they were slipping off of me. Exercise/lifting really makes a difference!!
xxketo,3debyy,gnalani,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:53:09 2015 UTC,"I run races and triathlons and lift to supplement. I have ""only"" lost 24 lbs, but I've lost something like 45 inches since 1/4/15. The fancy Express work clothes I wore when I was 22 (oh man, to have that kind of clothes budget again...) and weighed almost 20 lbs less are actually a size too big for me now.   More than the aesthetic results though, is the way my view of my body has changed. I am a machine instead of an art piece. This makes me fuel my body properly instead of trying to stick to a diet. It's changed my perspective on my body completely and is a huge reason I am keto 4 life!"

Don't forget to use some olive oil and plenty of salt. Good luck :)"

It might also depend on how ripe/juicy the zucchini is? Maybe your friend's oven isn't getting hot enough (I've had this issue with mine, but oppopsite)?  Edit: Read the recipe.

xxketo,3dcub7,inquiryteacher,3,Wed Jul 15 07:16:34 2015 UTC,"Your body is adjusting, the drive to snack is a consequence of a high carb environment and habit, you're learning what it feels like when your body can fuel itself between meals. Your hunger will never be the same but you still need to eat adequate calories and nutrients and especially protein.   Keto food is calorie dense - fattier meat, oils, butter, cream, avocado, nuts   You're not doing anything wrong, you're adjusting.   Are you using a food scale?"
xxketo,3dcub7,anbeav,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:19:01 2015 UTC,"Hmm,  so I need fattier meats maybe?  I had chicken breast, tuna I piled on mayo but could only manage a tbsp worth"

xxketo,3dcub7,fivecentpsychiatrist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:31:06 2015 UTC,"Remember that the fat macro isn't a goal you have to meet. If you're under on grams of fat per day, and you aren't hungry, that's totally fine.   I would double-check your food quantities. You didn't mention measuring or weighing. If you aren't using some kind of measurement, it's possible that you've eaten more than you though and you may be closer to your calorie goal than you imagined.   A food scale is recommended frequently for keto, but if you don't have one yet, go ahead and just measure your food using what you do have. It won't be as accurate as a scale, but it will help give you a closer idea.   As long as you're eating a reasonable amount of calories, I wouldn't worry about not meeting your calorie goal. KCKO! :)"
xxketo,3dcub7,fivecentpsychiatrist,2,Wed Jul 15 10:59:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you,  I was never a big eater before, I usually under ate protein before keto too :/. we are using a food scale, in grams. but I was adding things in the mfp by the cup for the most part. My concern is how to get those extra calories, do I eat straight butter or coconut oil?  I'm sitting at a projected 900 calories for today, after 3 meals and about 6 snacks"
xxketo,3dcub7,fivecentpsychiatrist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:25:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't just eat butter straight-up, that's probably going to be hard to stomach. What I would do though is try making a bullet-proof coffee or similar drink. It's easier to consume liquid calories than to force yourself to eat solids.   If you have a blender or a stick blender, BPC is pretty easy to make. My variation isn't a true BPC, but it is delicious!   1 TBSP coconut oil 1 Oz Heavy Whipping Cream Hot cofffee (enough to fill a tall glass or large mug)  Put the coffee in first and then stir in the coconut oil so it melts off your spoon. Blend with your immersion blender/in your regular blender. Add the HWC and repeat the blending.   I will sometimes add more cream or add almond milk/coconut milk to soften the coffee and make it more milky. You can also add sugar free syrup or a little stevia if you like. This will add about 200-300 calories depending on how much HWC you use and if you add almond milk."

xxketo,3d93w1,TwinOaksDesign,8,Tue Jul 14 14:46:42 2015 UTC,Another xxketoer makes and awesome spreadsheet.  Here is the one we're using now.  You enter your name and keep track of your stats there.  The idea is to try and be 100% dedicated to keto for 90 days.  I post weekly to see how everyone is doing and to remind everyone to enter their weight.  It just helps everyone stay accountable.
xxketo,3d93w1,TwinOaksDesign,3,Tue Jul 14 15:01:52 2015 UTC,Great! So similar to the 6-week challenges? I just joined my first 6-week challenge (albeit a week late!) so I will be primed and ready to go for my first 90-day challenge! :)

xxketo,3daw7c,lianabear,7,Wed Jul 15 16:12:21 2015 UTC,This is completely normal. The consensus seems to be to stay as keto as you can but eat when you're hungry even if you go above your deficit.

xxketo,3daw7c,fancyflorals,2,Wed Jul 15 04:33:49 2015 UTC,"Hey, I found a research paper on it! It's really old though... not sure if current research agrees, but it says we burn 8-16% more per day in the luteal phase (the 2-week pre-menstrual period of our cycle).   Other articles I read (all published in the 80s and 90s, I couldn't find anything recent through Google Scholar) indicated that the 6% increase in Energy Expenditure in participants studied was not consistent enough to be deemed ""significant.""   So maybe it's not a number that can be relied on, but it does seem plausible that some of us burn between 100-250 cals more per day when we experience PMS.  Thanks for your post :)"
xxketo,3daw7c,cicadasinmyears,2,Wed Jul 15 07:30:32 2015 UTC,"It's what I do. I also get ravenously hungry at a certain time of the month, and so I just eat more if I want more but keep to low carb food. I figure it's only 1 week and it's better than trying to white knuckle it and then ending up diving into a pint of chocolate ice cream...which is what usually happens instead!"
xxketo,3daw7c,GreenGlassDrgn,5,Wed Jul 15 16:08:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, no matter when I'm hungry (period or not), I just suck it up and follow my macros. If you're eating and it's never satisfying your hunger, from what I've discovered I'm probably going to be hungry either way, so I might as well stay at a deficient; this also proves it's most likely mental not physical hunger. I just don't give into the cravings/hunger. Probably not what you want to hear but it's just how I manage it. Sometimes letting the snacking beast begin just makes things spiral for some people--suddenly you're giving yourself an excuse to go over your calories, so where's the upper limit? When do you stop? When you're full? What happens if nothing makes you feel satisfied--then what? There's something easier about saying no than trying to find ""moderation""."
xxketo,3daw7c,GreenGlassDrgn,4,Tue Jul 14 23:05:01 2015 UTC,"I do appreciate what you're saying. I've been ""just dealing"" with my hunger for 8 months now. It's become a lot harder over the past 2 weeks, because I'm maintaining for the summer, and being hungry while maintaining just sucks.   I guess before I thought of the hunger as productive discomfort (like pain in birthing -- pain with a purpose). Now I'm just grumpy. Why the hell am I hungry when I'm eating sooo much more than I was before?  I also have raging hormones. I'm not doing well atm :("
xxketo,3daw7c,hnhlh,3,Wed Jul 15 00:21:28 2015 UTC,"I understand. I am pretty ravenously hungry more days than I'm not, whether or not it's around my period (I don't really have hunger changes around my period, but I also believe they're psychosomatic, people assume they're hungry because of their period or that they should it more because it's around their period as they're hyper aware that hunger is happening during or before a period). I do see how being hungry during maintenance could be frustrating. What kind of foods do you eat day to day and do you consume anything that could cause cravings or less satiety (artificial sweeteners, nuts, even things like hwc or oils may be calories not ""well spent"" as they're not helpful volume wise). I assume you're using a food scale? What was a day like when you were in a deficient vs foods you consume now? How are your water and electrolyte intake (especially with it being summer)? Do you do IF, and did you do it when at a deficient?  I definitely have been frustrated with my hunger as well, especially being close to my goal and barely losing 1-2 lbs a month because I'm so small, so I relate. I have been on keto for a little under 1 1/2 years and don't cheat on non-keto foods, so the thought of going off plan just isn't an option for me. I definitely believe sometimes complete restriction can help some stay the course more than the ""moderation"" route of going off plan every once and a while"
xxketo,3daw7c,hnhlh,2,Wed Jul 15 00:57:41 2015 UTC,"I do use a food scale. I log everything.  I've had a lot of changes lately. Kids are out of school. Schedule is completely out of whack. Can't fit workouts in. Work has gone crazy. Have house guests....   I think the no workouts is probably it though. No workout means I'm drinking less water, eating earlier in the day, running through my calorie allotment faster...   I'll fit in a workout tomorrow for sure and see if that helps.

xxketo,3daw7c,hnhlh,2,Wed Jul 15 06:49:45 2015 UTC,"Are you me??   Lately I have found that I am hungry a lot more than I was when I first started keto. I have similar hunger issues and nothing I've tried (more protein, more fat, loads of veggies, etc.) seems to work. I wind up going way over my calorie count, and/or my carb count. I feel almost like I must be missing some kind of nutrient, the drive to eat more is that strong.  I try ignoring it and taking PGX (derived from konjac root) to try to fill me up, but I am pretty miserable.  Potentially related: I am peri-menopausal - and feel like I get to go through all the hormonal stuff, but then the period part doesn't happen.   So, I guess I'm saying ""ugh, me too!"" and I'm sorry you're dealing with this, try PGX if it's available where you are, and I will watch this thread with interest for other people's tips."

If the goal is a healthy sustainable lifestyle, keto food or not the habit needs to be addressed. Binge is never ""cool.""  Also doesn't sound like a binge so perhaps let's reserve the word for actual binging. But yes the beauty of keto is that if you overeat, your hormones are in check and tell you you've had enough vs overeating carbs makes you want more."

I have deleted many posts asking questions or trying to talk about general keto woman life because they just get downvoted. It makes me feel really discouraged, honestly.

Honestly, this sort of qualifies as a NSV since instead of going for crappy carbs you went for protein, salt and fat to satiate your hunger/craving. That's a win, no matter what. My little 'I want to nom something salty' snack is a spoonful of peanut or nut butter. Way happier to eat that to satisfy a craving than a hunk of cake."

xxketo,3d8qo1,yumyumfat,4,Tue Jul 14 12:18:12 2015 UTC,"Actually meant that I had previously been shamed in a post, not that this one was shaming. But I stand by the statement that we should feel free to make comments without being shamed.   As for the binge part, I don't necessarily think a binge has to be like two days' worth of calories to count as a binge, AND I don't think bingeing in general is that maladaptive. Bingeing behaviour is common among our ape cousins, and seems to be correlated to reproductive readiness in females. So it's possibly incredibly natural and in fact adaptive to 'binge' while you're ovulating. And that could mean a few hundred extra calories (as I've pointed out previously that I seem to need because I experience hunger during those few days a month) or it may be a thousand extra calories or more. Either way, seems to be a normal part of life for female hominins to some degree. Bingeing weekly or more might be a real issue, I don't disagree with that at all, but there seems to be evidence that there are physiological (read: NOT PSYCHOLOGICAL) triggers to bingeing that point to occasional bingeing being a normal behaviour."
xxketo,3d8qo1,anbeav,3,Tue Jul 14 12:27:05 2015 UTC,"But I stand by the statement that we should feel free to make comments without being shamed.    I agree. I in no way shamed OP, but as many go along in this process of lifestyle change while yes this is a victory it's also worthwhile to still reflect on the habits so as to change them.   No, a binge is a mindset, it has nothing to do with calories, but many use the term to simply describe overeating and it's best not to confuse the two.   I'm not going down this evolutionary path about binging being an adaptive trait"

I struggle just as hard with binging as many others here, and I shouldn't have eaten an entire package of pepperoni, but I was happy I did it with that instead of ordering myself a medium pepperoni pizza and eating the entirety of that, instead (which I have done in the past). I have no one to support me or talk to in my life who understands my struggles with food addictions and lack of willpower, and I am so excited to find a community of women who would get it and get me, who are on the same path I'm on, but the longer I'm here the less it feels that way unless I'm celebrating a ""true victory,"" which all things considered, are very few and far between and the days I need the least support."

I think it's important to discuss these things which is why I started the discussion, because yes many have personal issues with eating and discussion about them helps.  Like I said it was great you didn't turn to carbs but also worthwhile to identify what you think resulted in eating an entire package of pepperoni, getting to the root issue which is a valuable part of the lifestyle change that many are working so hard to achieve.

I really think you're misunderstanding my post. My post was made with exactly this in mind to highlight that keto or not the food addiction mentality is still there and many find it helpful to talk through it to figure out what's really going on, to support you to change your relationship with food. It's not all roses here, and it shouldn't be but it's also helpful for others to provide constructive criticism when it's needed so as to help the struggles related to food.  This is a victory like I said, but also a sign that the behaviors are still lurking so with all of the rest of us here you can work through that like many others have in the past, no one was scolding you, no one was negatively criticizing you, it was out of support that I commented."

So I'd probably say ""it's cool"" about a keto binge. I didn't feel like OP was belittling my plight as someone with BED. Everyone has their own threshold as to what they consider a binge and I find it's the feelings around it (urgency or lack of control) that define a binge for me, rather than the quantity of food."

Usually I do a circuit of resistance training on 1 major and 1 minor muscle group at a time, and do 30-60 mins of cardio - either the Arc Trainer or fast walking at a high incline. I eat between 1,000 and 1,400 calories...varied because I try to eat when I'm hungry, though I will forgo eating and push through hunger pangs if I know I shouldn't be hungry. I do use a food scale, yes. I eat all organic, free range, grass fed, etc.  No artificial sweeteners, only stevia.  I use heavy cream in my morning coffee, but only 1/2 a tbsp. and otherwise, I eat no dairy. I eat 2 whole eggs and a flax/coconut meal pancake (very low carb) and 1 tbsp of kerry gold butter + 1/2 tbsp of coconut butter. For lunch I eat 2 servings of romaine lettuce, 1 tbsp of olive oil, a chicken thigh with skin, (100g) or slice of fried pork belly (50g), 3 black olives, 1/2 cup of white mushrooms, and a tbsp of kerry gold butter for lunch. For dinner I eat a serving of pork rinds, a serving of kelp noodles fried in 1/2 tbsp of duck fat, a tbsp. of kerry gold butter and a whole egg. That's an average daily meal plan, and if it varies, I swap out something for something else with similar macros and calorie content. I don't take any meds as of yet, though I am hoping to be put on metformin.  Endo wants me to take BC, so I've made an appt with the same gyno that my roommate, who also has PCOS, sees, who recently put her on metformin."

Yes, they have more carbs, but also play a big role in long term health and weight loss.  Also, as I've said to many others, fermented foods.  Have some fermented sour cream/yogurt/kefir with breakfast, some fermented vegetable like saurkraut or kimchi on top of your salad and maybe an additional serving with dinner or a fermented drink - KeVita is a good low carb option if you have access to it where you live, or you could make your own if you're like me!  There are so many things that could be affecting your personal experience, but I'm a firm believe that more vegetables makes a positive difference.  The other thing you may consider is your Macros, is there a reason you're going so high on fat% versus something closer to 65%?  With as high of an activity level as what you've listed you will probably find adding more protein to show a positive difference.  If something isn't working, try a change and see what happens, you can always go back."

xxketo,3d9gmx,toqueville,3,Tue Jul 14 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"I think that mind and body are inextricably connected and that your psychology can defnitely affect your weight; look at how placebos can have such strong effects, it's the mind believing that is producing the result.  Do you think maybe you're squeezing the bunny so to speak?  Focusing so much on it that it's escaping you?  You could sometimes see this happen in sales when someone would get so focused on hitting the goal that it would backfire; the best advice that always worked was to take a step back and let go of needing to hit the goal and really getting to a point of accepting the process, that if you're doing the right process the results may come.  They may come differently than you expect or want, but if you are genuinely doing the work then you will get your results.  Not sure if you've tried any yoga/meditation or if you've ever heard of something called EFT, but I think you could see some benefits from getting into a process of acceptance and love.  I know it's not easy, especially in a culture that always puts image at the forefront of value, but I truly believe that seeking out acceptance at all points of health and image will take you closer to the end goal, and ultimately you will be healthier <3"

PCOS causes insulin resistance, which is a metabolic syndrome -- which means your metabolic rate might be lower than keto-calc might suggest.  I also have PCOS (and hypothroidism, for which I'm taking meds) and I have been working under the assumption that my body burns calories at about 10% lower than the ""sedentary"" option on keto-calc. This worked fairly well for me, and even though I'm at  much lower weight than when I started I'm still loosing weight (very, very slowly now).  If you have the insurance that'll let you or you can afford it, then it might be a good idea to get your BMR tested.

I am going to the doctor next week, because my OBGYN has advised he's seeing increased cases of older PCOS patients with uterine cancer, potentially from lack of ovulation. Apparently an ultrasound can see how thick the endometrium is, and if it needs to be shed with medication to reduce the risk."
xxketo,3dbc0e,ONinAB,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:26:15 2015 UTC,"Apparently an ultrasound can see how thick the endometrium is, and if it needs to be shed   Is this related to endometriosis? Excuse my ignorance."
xxketo,3dbc0e,ONinAB,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:27:43 2015 UTC,"It is not, but the same parts of the body are involved. As I understand it endometriosis is when the endometrium tissue (that lines in the inside of the uterus) appears outside the uterus and causes a lot of pelvic pain.   In what I understand my doctor was talking about: the endometrium tissue that lines the uterus builds up - layer upon layer every month - making it thick over time when you don't ovulate. When you ovulate the layer is shed each month and it's not as much of a concern. The thick, layer upon layer, tissue can cause uterine cancer if an intervention isn't taken - which could be birth control methods (pill/murena) to help it shed the tissue monthly, or in my case, a progesterone pill taken once every 3 months for 10 days to cause the layer of tissue to shed itself every 3 mos to reduce the risk of cancer."
xxketo,3dbc0e,OnionOnYourBelt,2,Wed Jul 15 20:49:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, sure did. We (Dr and I) suspected I had pcos, got tested and sure enough. It does explain a lot, but it doesn't stop me from losing. It's just much slower than other people."

xxketo,3dbc0e,stargrace1,2,Wed Jul 15 03:55:32 2015 UTC,"I did not have an ultrasound to confirm diagnosis, but typically you need to display 2 out of 3 symptoms before a diagnosis is made. I had bloodwork done that displayed high androgens, along with semi irregular periods. I did have an ultrasound back in 2013 that did not display any cysts, but that doesn't mean they didn't develop between then and now. Also don't forget to check out /r/pcos :) Wonderful ladies there too."
xxketo,3dbc0e,unknownyeti,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:05:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you! So I see. One can have PCOS and not have developed cysts yet, but there is a high likelihood they will? And diet + BC can help prevent cysts/regulate?"
xxketo,3dbc0e,TrashyTripod,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:28:48 2015 UTC,I did. I got told it was the only certain way of diagnosing PCOS. It also helps because you can see just what level your PCOS is at depending on how many follicles they see.
xxketo,3dbc0e,unknownyeti,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:51:52 2015 UTC,Does that mean that your blood tests may be normal but you may still have PCOS?  I had blood work done last week and I have high triglycerides and a higher hemoglobin a1c (not in the diabetic range yet). She said that my blood tests were not indicative of PCOS. The doc still has me coming in for an ultra sound next week though.

xxketo,3dbc0e,n0m-de-plum,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:24:15 2015 UTC,"I would get one done every few years to make sure you aren't getting too many cysts. I got some even when on birth control (or at least one burst and hurt like hell), so not everything is fixable with the pill  Make sure to get regular PAPs as well, since you are at a higher risk for developing cervical cancer."
xxketo,3dbc0e,runninghome,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:26:38 2015 UTC,"Not at first. I was diagnosed in my early teens, but didn't have an ultrasound until my early 20s. I really don't feel like an ultrasound is absolutely necessary for diagnosis unless your doctor worried about another anatomical problem like endometriosis or uterine polyps. In that way it is useful to rule out those conditions as alternative diagnoses, or co-morbidities. Or, of course, as other posters mentioned, if the blood test results are in the normal ranges, but PCOS is still suspected.  However, being a classic PCOSer myself, if your symptoms are really as textbook as your doctor indicated, I'd suspect you will show the classic blood markers. If you have the symptoms, and your blood test results are what you'd expect from someone with the condition, that is diagnostic because PCOS, in spite of the name, is about way more than just cysts on the ovaries. Mainly it's a metabolic disorder.  If you really want an ultrasound, though, you can ask for one."
xxketo,3dbb7s,dinosnoores,6,Tue Jul 14 23:06:28 2015 UTC,It takes no longer than 24 hours to enter ketosis. Now that you're in ketosis ditch the sticks as they are not reliable to monitor nutritional ketosis
xxketo,3dbb7s,anbeav,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:07:58 2015 UTC,"That's because they only show excess and eventually my body won't produce excess, correct? Would they be useful if I knock myself out of keto and want to see if I'm back in it though? Like for example if I somehow fell off the wagon for a weekend?"
xxketo,3dbb7s,anbeav,2,Tue Jul 14 23:20:10 2015 UTC,"They are unreliable for many reasons-they only show excess is one of those reasons; other reasons - they only detect one of two many ketones in circulation   Follow your macros and you're in ketosis. If you choose to eat something with more carbs then don't stress ketosis, focus on how you feel - energy, satiety, hunger, cravings - and regardless you're back in ketosis in less than 24 hours. They can't be used for that purpose as you will excrete ketones if you kick yourself out of ketosis. If you fall off the wagon you know you're out of ketosis and you're back in in a day and don't need ketostix to tell you that.    Best to put them away"

xxketo,3dazrs,anbeav,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:01:46 2015 UTC,How much were you drinking? I assume you are referring to alcohol. If you're around day 3 of not drinking then you should go to a walk in clinic or the emergency room. It sounds like you could need a banana bag with some vitamins and some ativan. ETOH withdrawal is serious and if you went from a lot (be honest with yourself) to little/none then you're putting your body through the wringer and there can be some serious repercussions including seizures.

I found it helpful to always have a ""protein chaperone"" when I ate fruit. 1) If dairy is okay for you, the full-fat Fage greek yogurt is a fun way to dress up your berries and get some protein & fat.  2) Try half an apple with some peanut butter on top as a snack etc.  Looks like you stick to whole/real foods, but, if you need a convenience food, Quest bars are yummy and helpful when I was on the go.

They have really perfected how to provide a huge array of personalities with the tools to teach. In fact, I think that's part of how they're so successful:  there's not one type of instructor in their world; they encourage you to be yourself. Personally, everyone expected me to fail when I started teaching step. I wasn't loud enough, and I wasn't comfortable opening myself up to the class. Eventually I learned that it's a reciprocal thing- you get to know your members and give them your energy, and they give you their energy in return, and you amplify it send it back, and you have an experience together that can transcend the workout on some days. Sorry to ramble! Of course teaching still isn't for everyone. If you do love the classes though, don't rule it out just because of your current fitness level!"

The sort of good news is that nothing (other than the rheumatoid factor) was out of normal range, and other than some weird neck thing, my x-rays looked good.  Apparently there is a whole additional set of tests that they can do for autoimmune issues, but they didn't originally order that, because insurance companies don't like to pay for it unless the cheap and easy tests have been done.  So they drew more blood and I go back in a month.  Sigh."

Well I'd been almost regulat pre keto, but since I was afraid of getting more cysts in my ovaries and sonehow developing PCOS, i decided to give Keto a try and two months in, I'd lost my period. I was REALLY freaking out. I hate BC pills, I hate visiting my gyno and I hate the feeling that my body is fighting against me and now it's over.   Question; weight loss has been extremly hard for a few months, no change in measurments or cloths (I don't weight myself) I used to lose pretty easy with a low carb diet before my ovaries got messed up. Any chance I get my mojo back now?  Also, i've been eating slightly more carbs tis week, like up to 50-60 gr. Could this be related? Do I need to keep my carbs this hight to achieve a hormonal balance?  Have a great day everyone! <3"

Though my diet seems to be the only thing anyone wants to talk with me about lately (most of the time they just talk about all the yummy food pictures I post) it would be nice to talk about something else every now and then.  I do have to brag on my dog though, we started our Advanced/Refresher training course last night and she had the shorter homework list, lol! She's still a big chicken who gets freaked/distracted in public but she retained a lot more from her Advanced Adult classes we did over a year ago than I thought, I let our regular training slip. I know she enjoyed it because she fell asleep on our 5 minute drive home (win). Nothing worse than having an intelligent dog that's bored!

xxketo,3d8gyt,KtO_,3,Tue Jul 14 13:43:02 2015 UTC,I'm on day 2 of my period and I couldn't be happier. Pre-keto my periods were horrible and it was all to do with my birth control (nexplanon implant). I would get the worse cramps in both my back and my lower abdomen and would bleed heavily for a week. I know I might be jumping the gun but my cramps are so much more tolerable this cycle. I can function like a normal person. I didn't go straight to bed yesterday like I normally would. I'm still not my pre-birth control normal but I'm not miserable and that alone makes me happy.   And before anyone asks I deal with the symptoms of my bc because they are easier than dealing with an unplanned pregnancy.

Yesterday, I tried them on again and although they were tight, after putting on a toning tank top, I could wear them in public and looked pretty good! I was so excited!!

A year ago I didn't cook at all, now I miss my kitchen and all the keto meals I learned how to make.  I need to start going to the grocery store to keep food in the hotel fridge to make lunches as the office meals are a complete carb-fest.  I tried just having an evening meal (IF), but I am way too hungry to wait until then for some reason.   I mean actual hunger and not cravings, it's frustrating because it would be so much easier to only have to eat once per day.

I have fallen off the wagon, hard.  I've puffed up to my preKeto Weight... to be fair I only had a week on before shark week hit.    I'm finding a hard time with feeling full, and satisfied.  I'm not hungry.  And, admittedly I've been eating a lot of ""grab and go"" type of things instead of Sitting and Eating.    I did really well staying around ~20gm/day my first week.  Calories stayed low.  The second week I did okay.  When I start trying to get more veggies staying in the 20gm limit got wobbly - which, I'm ok with not being perfectly there (avoiding black/white thinking here).  Mentally - as long as I'm below 50 and staying in keto I'm ok, I am not hung up on 20g/wk per se.    Do you guys plan your meals to the nth degree? (Or, did you at first?)  Because I feel like paralysis by analysis is setting in."
xxketo,3d8gyt,Just4Kix1230,2,Tue Jul 14 21:17:09 2015 UTC,"I'm finding a hard time with feeling full, and satisfied   Can you elaborate? You say you're not full and satisfied but at the same time you are not hungry. It's likely that you're getting used to keto meaning that keto doesn't leave you physically full, it leaves you no longer hungry and it can take time to learn the difference. What are your meals like?    I plan my meal by the week, just like my mom did, every week.  You don't have to long term but I would strongly recommend it for the first few weeks to months as you get used to keto.  Plan a week at a time and then you can avoid needing to make in the moment food decisions. Also while 50 g is likely a reduction from the number of carbs you used to eat, 20 g really does cut down on much of the cravings and hunger issues faster than higher net carb intakes.  If you need help with a meal plan, just let me know"
xxketo,3d8gyt,sandyk199,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:26:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  I really appreciate the reduction in cravings... it's made all the difference - so maybe upping carbs isn't a great idea. Breakfast has been 2-3 eggs fried in a tablespoon of butter, heavy cream in the coffee.  Lunch, salad with chicken, cheese, full fat ranch on top.  Dinner is all over the map, but I try to stick with meat + veggie... veggie is hit and miss. What you say about the physical fullness factor is definitely it. I'm coming from a place of emotional eating - and that full feeling was a part of that. I will pull up my meal plan at work and PM you - thanks for offering to take a look!!  My sister had great success with keto (with the help of a clinic) and I am encouraged by her results.  I think dinner is the biggest challenge at the moment."
xxketo,3d63xf,tresliso,20,Mon Jul 13 20:36:46 2015 UTC,"I think part of the issue of finding nicely fitting clothes when you're bigger is the difference between plus sized body shapes. There is a much greater scope of body shapes in the plus sized world as there is in the regular sized one, which makes it harder to design clothes that will fit and look nice on most women of size. Two size 22 women carry their weight very differently (hips, belly, bust, tighs) but two size 6 women, while having different bodies, will probably not have that much difference between them. So plus sized designers resort to shapeless things, unforgiving cheap stretchy fabrics and end up making clothes that fit awkwardly on most. But we buy them anyway because that's what's available.   Plus sized clothing looked ridiculous on me. My legs and arms were small compared to my butt and bust and I had no real waist. I always looked like I was either wearing a tent or pyjamas. Now everything fits. I don't always like the fit of look of the clothes but there definitely is more choice."
xxketo,3d63xf,TineCiel,2,Mon Jul 13 23:31:48 2015 UTC,"Confirmed! I have a friend who works in sourcing material and consulting on cuts for the fashion industry and she says she always gets asked this and it's the same answer. Up until maybe... size 18, there's some leeway for things fitting okay even if they don't fit perfectly. Once you get into the 20s plus, it gets beyond our current ability to mass produce."
xxketo,3d63xf,quantumcooney,7,Tue Jul 14 03:25:29 2015 UTC,There is a great difference in how people carry weight in plus size bodies so I guess designers just say fuck it and make everything shapeless. I can't justify the atrocious prints on plus size clothing. I doubt anyone can. Back on point I just love how much more fun shopping is since keto has helped me drop a lot of weight. I'm not relegated to only shopping at Torrid and I love it. I still go there for shoes sometimes though. They have some damn fine shoes.

My friends at work are always on my case about wearing more color but I don't feel comfortable in most of the plus size clothes I can afford.  It's rare to find something that isn't glittery, covered in sequins, animal print, or very loud obnoxious colors. Most of it looks like something my grandmother would wear. It's almost like the manufacturers think we want to call MORE attention to our bodies. Old Navy is the worst, their sizing is never consistent and the fit is always bizarre.

It's just plain not true.   I would speak to the generally wider diversity of overweight body types, but that's already been covered.   This hasn't yet, though: cost of materials. Plus-sized clothing will always be more expensive than their smaller counterparts. Why? Well, for one thing, there's simply more material. Bolts of cloth and the thread to hold them together cost money. The more you use, the more each garment costs.   Also. For each bolt, you might get, say, 4 useable small size pieces. You may only get 1 or 2 useable plus-sized pieces, with a ton of unusable scrap. Making plus-sized clothing is just plain less efficient, so each garment costs more.   I'm not saying higher efficiency and optimization aren't called for! But that's the way things are right now. It's not a scam. It's economics."
xxketo,3d63xf,littlechichend,3,Tue Jul 14 15:42:36 2015 UTC,"congratulations on your progress! :)   Thank you! :D   cost of materials   Actually it's not. I went to school for fashion and studied clothing manufacturing, and the actual cost of the fabric is a very, very small percentage of the total cost of any garment. Even if you double up the fabric for any garment, the cost of production would go up at most maybe $1 or $2 for most standard fabrics. (I'm not talking silk or elaborate jacquards, I'm talking low-end cotton, jersey, poly-blends -- the types of fabrics commonly used in fast fashion, the segment I was addressing in my post.)  Also, plus size clothing for men is not similarly marked-up for the most part.  The issues of the greater variation in body types for heavier women (as mentioned by many other on this thread) is definitely more of an issue in terms of cost of production and pattern-making choices -- but economically speaking I feel like the reason that plus size clothing is so expensive is a complete mismatch in supply and demand. (Low supply, high demand.)  Here's a story from Jezebel about when Old Navy tried to charge more for plus size clothes for women. Jezebel can sometimes be too ranty and not enough info, but I think this story is fairly well written.  And here's another interesting piece on the whole Old Navy fiasco."

But, our brains do weird things when we lose weight and our self-view can be distorted. As you continue to lose, you'll start to experience the paper towel effect: when you have a lot to lose, you start as a full roll of paper towels. You can peel off the paper towels (lbs) and the roll still looks the same size. But, then, at a certain point, as you keep peeling towels/lbs off, the roll starts to look smaller. Then, as you get near goal (the cardboard tube) every towel starts to make a difference in how big the roll looks. It's only been 105 days - that's not a long time! You've made great progress. Just keep going and the changes will get more dramatic."

It's a phenomenon that a lot of people suffer from - they ""adjust"" what they see in the mirror to fit what they need to see.  I know because I've seen pix of myself (when heavy or when thinner) and been surprised that the image in my mind's eye didn't match the one in the picture (both ways - I was heavier than I thought OR thinner than I thought). Either you cannot see how you've changed NOW or you weren't able to see how you looked before.  You have gone down THREE PANTS SIZES so there is NO WAY you look the same. Trust me - it's in your head.  It might not be a bad idea to take a picture of yourself every week. Do NOT look at them. But after you've done that for 6-8 weeks, assuming you continue dropping anything from 1.5-3.5 lbs a week - look at the series and you'll see the diff.

Are you lifting any weights or doing bodyweight exercises? I have noticed that has changed the actual shape of my body. I do heavy weight goblet squats and use kettlebells and my shape is much more toned though my weight is the same. My clothes all fit differently and I look different but the number on the scale is the same. So I guess I kind of have the opposite problem. Just focus on the positive achievement you've made and keep up your awesome work, and if you can add in a few weight lifting or bodyweight exercises. Insanity DVDs can also whip you into a new shape really quickly if you are interested in that. I did them for a bit and lost a ton of fat around my mid section."

Do yourself a favor - take pictures on a monthly basis. Also, take measurements on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.

Today you look nearly identical to yesterday. Yesterday you looked nearly identical to the day before. This has been happening to you for 105 days.   For 105 days your mind says, yep nearly the same to yesterday, so it tells you, you've looked this way for forever. Its way pictures are important.   This is also why people who don't see you often notice the changes more then those you see everyday.

I remember a couple of years back, after I had lost 30lbs I thought I looked exactly the same, but then I took pictures and compared them with pictures before the 30lb loss, and they showed otherwise.  Also the less you weigh, the bigger the difference. For instance, if I were 30lbs down from my current weight, it'd be more noticeable than when I lost 30lbs at a higher weight.

Somehow, I still didn't get it though.  It didn't help, of course, that I was 150 lbs at my smallest adult weight and my friends would cry when they hit 130.

That doesn't mean you aren't attractive, though. Everyone's body is different and there is no perfect body for everyone no matter what Hollywood celebrity is currently being haled as the example of it. Seriously, can you imagine that EVERYONE would look better if they had a body like Kim Kardashian? On some people her figure would look really weird because they just aren't built that way.  Also, as other posters have said, there is no way you look exactly the same if you've gone down 3 sizes. You're working on your body and you've had great success at it. Losing over 40 lbs is pretty darn amazing! However, I'd also encourage you to work on your self-image, and work on shifting your thoughts less to comparing yourself to others and more to becoming the best you that you can!  Now, some sources for trendy clothes that come in bigger sizes and will look good on you now:   Old Navy Chico's (I was under the impression they were mostly ""old lady"" clothes, but was pleasantly surprised. I bought a tie-dyed skirt there so...) Mod Cloth, http://www.modcloth.com/ (Expensive, but they have so much cool stuff!) Ross (Requires some hunting, but great prices)"

If so, go take another picture of yourself now, and then use an app to put the pictures in a frame side by side. I have no doubt you'll be able to see the differences if you look at the details up close right next to each other like that! You could even post the pictures for us - I will show you all the places you have clearly lost inches and pounds from!!   And if you didn't take starting point photos - drop what you're doing and go take some right now!! Trust me, nothing is more satisfying than seeing the physical changes in your body with your own eyes, and having the photographic evidence to boot!"

xxketo,3d62ao,Acrassy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:36:40 2015 UTC,"This post is getting a little old but I just wanted to add that if you are like me and you lose weight sort of proportionally all over it can be really hard to see changes for a long time.   Like over the course of losing the first 30 lbs I lost inches consistently around my body. So for a long time I just looked like a slightly smaller version of my fat self. It was disheartening because it seems like you are not getting any results for a long time. And then suddenly there's this tipping point you hit where you can see it and it's AWESOME.  You might want to read the paper towel theory. Also take measurements along with weighing, they will tell the real story."
xxketo,3d7icv,foghornzipcar,8,Tue Jul 14 03:04:59 2015 UTC,"awww. shucks its ok ..don't be upset. I started keto a week ago and went to nordstorm today ,I dunno what I was expecting but I tried on several dresses only to look like toothpaste squished out of a tube       ,I felt depressed for a moment and then just had to laugh at the absurdity, thinking a week and 2 lbs later I am good to go for a size 8 dress :) your story may be different but just remember to use the bad times as your reason to stay disciplined. big hugs.."

xxketo,3d7icv,Plum51,5,Tue Jul 14 06:22:25 2015 UTC,"I've gained a bit since my lowest weight which was 53 kg on my 165 cm figure, which is pretty thin. I was choosing a dress for an event this morning and there was this dress which actually brought tears to my eyes because I looked huge, bloated and flabby which is unfair since I exercise alot. But then I rememberd I used to be EXACTLY this much, if not more, unhappy with my body and with that same dress when I was 53kg. Then it hit me that I have been unhappy with my body all my life. I had been very overweight, overweight, normal sized, underweight, skinny fat, etc. I've never taken time to appreciate myself for how long I've come. I've never taken a moment to praise my body for the amazing changes we are making together. I've never enjoyed dress shopping.  My point is, don't do that to yourself. There is a chance that this feeling sticks with you untill you'd reached your current goal weight and maybe you'd not feel as amazing as you'd excepted and man that shit will destroy you. Don't let this moment ruin you mood and body image. We usualy fail to see ourselves as we really are.  Take care!"
xxketo,3d7icv,Zephyrine_93,3,Tue Jul 14 05:33:17 2015 UTC,Excellent advice! I would now be very happy to be at various past weights at which I couldn't stand the sight of myself. We could all stand to be a bit easier on ourselves.

I just had my six-months on keto bloodwork done, and compared it to my bloodwork from a year before that (so eighteen months between the two).  Previously, my total cholesterol was in the normal range though my triglycerides were moderately elevated.  This time my total cholesterol was ten points lower, and my triglycerides were down 86 points.  My doctor complimented me on sticking to a low-fat diet and when I reminded her that I was on a low-carb/high-fat diet, she backpedaled and said that carbs can contribute to high cholesterol as well and if what I was doing was working for me, then great, keep doing it!  as of five years ago I was pre-diabetic but managed to get out of that range through diet and exercise, and my two blood glucose readings were 86 and 84, respectively.  Everything else looked great."

xxketo,3d4kks,MoshPotato,4,Mon Jul 13 19:15:43 2015 UTC,"I'm really sorry to hear that you've had heart attacks. Your concern is absolutely warranted and understandable.  Having said that ""cholesterol"" is a very simplistic term that says nothing about any kinds of risk to cardiovascular health. What was your A1c? ApoB? LDL-P? LDL(a)? LDL-C?  See where I'm going with this?  Now, do we know your Apolipoprotein E allele mutation? No?  Being scared of keto? Understandable.  On keto? Might have avoided those heart attacks in the first place.  I stress might because I completely lack any information here regarding your history but the science is crystal clear that for risk to cardiovascular disease this diet will most likely have a positive impact."

xxketo,3d4kks,MoshPotato,5,Mon Jul 13 20:56:29 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be drastic, plenty of people ease into it. Remove a grain type a week and see if you can cope, replace it with an extra serving of broccoli or leaving the chicken skin on. Or track what you're eating now and cut your carb level by half and see if that is sustainable and you have results. Keto isn't for everyone, you might not even lose weight on it, but it can work wonders."

I think I'm better off for it, regardless.  ETA: Also, as the other replier pointed out, there are a LOT of factors to general health.  I stopped eating high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated oils 15 years ago.  I don't eat any chemical additives, and I have a diet consisting primarily of whole, raw foods (even before I stopped eating flour and sugar).  Could that make a difference?

xxketo,3d4kks,joloki618,22,Mon Jul 13 21:53:49 2015 UTC,"I think the general consensus is that doctors are simply WRONG about fats. Eating fat won't make you fat.   I'm in a similar situation where my doctor wants me to eat low carb (and has been tracking my blood work and such), but low fat and low sodium. I eat dairy free keto, and my blood work had been great and I've been losing weight.  (I don't do well with dairy. Too many calories and it makes me want to binge. It also makes my doctor happy to see that I'm not eating a lot of cheese, even though most ketoers eat plenty of it)  If you eat keto, you will be eating a larger amount of fat, but your cholesterol and weight will definitely go down.   Edit: sorry I do take cream or butter in my coffee, and sometimes cook with butter in the pan. I do mostly dairy free :p"

xxketo,3d4kks,milleniajc,3,Mon Jul 13 20:20:53 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. And if you do lose a lot of weight, I believe your blood cholesterol goes up for a short time afterward."
xxketo,3d4kks,DownhillYardSale,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:45:48 2015 UTC,It's likely but is that on keto or no?  In ketosis weight loss we know LDL-C will 50/50 go up/down. If it does go up it's likely that total cholesterol will also increase because this is typically associated with an initial drop in HDL-C (LDL-C causes the cholesterol being released from cells to stagnate in HDL particles and thus they do not mature properly).  Then suddenly LDL-C drops and HDL-C increases on the next test... exactly as we'd expect.
xxketo,3d4kks,joloki618,2,Tue Jul 14 17:41:28 2015 UTC,"My bad. I just meant OP will likely be healthier on a ketogenic diet, despite her current cholesterol level."

Give it a good 3 months of strictly following it without cheat days. Then get your blood work checked. The real answer of whether this will work for you will be in the blood work results."
xxketo,3d4kks,lilacseeker,2,Mon Jul 13 21:53:38 2015 UTC,I have an appointment scheduled with my doctor for six months from now. I'm going to do everything I can to do this right! Thank you for your support. :)
xxketo,3d4kks,sasoon,11,Mon Jul 13 22:02:17 2015 UTC,"This is unfortunate, mostly because your doctor is giving out very outdated advice. Dietary saturated fat is not the cause of elevated cholesterol and your doctor should know that. Keto is cardio-protective and anti-inflammatory. It's one of the better approaches for heart health."

xxketo,3d4kks,DownhillYardSale,2,Mon Jul 13 19:24:28 2015 UTC,"This sounds a lot like me, except my doctor was a little more knowledgeable. I was told my vitamin D was scary low and my cholesterol was incredibly high. I was told I was pre-diabetic.  The difference is that my doctor told me I needed to cut carbs as much as possible to get healthy. She never brought up anything related to fats, but she discussed carbs at length and how important it is to get my numbers down.  Again, speaking from the same position you were in...I've done my 3 month blood work and my cholesterol is down significantly (my vitamin D is also up, but I'm on a pill to help that along). I would say keto is DEFINITELY for you. If you're not confident in that, go do some research yourself and possibly get a second opinion."
xxketo,3d4kks,ifartmeat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:42:21 2015 UTC,"I've been researching this, and my doctor didn't say not to do keto. I only spoke to a nurse today and she didn't seem to know to much of my results. I asked her for the numbers and she didn't know them, just that the doctor said they were high. After getting the news that my cholesterol was high, I wasn't sure if keto would negatively affect it. I didn't realize there were so many kinds of cholesterol!"
xxketo,3d4kks,DownhillYardSale,2,Mon Jul 13 21:25:17 2015 UTC,"On Tuesday I had a physical with my doctor. She said my vitamin D is low (normal for me, but I'll be taking a supplement to fix it) and that my cholesterol is high.   Can you provide the actual numbers please? ""High"" in my mind means your total cholesterol is over 250 mg/dL or LDL-C is over 130 mg/dL.   She wants me to start eating a diet low in saturated fats. Is it still safe to do keto? I know the diet is higher in fats but I thought weight loss would result in lower cholesterol.   Yes. Simply replace saturated fats with monosaturated and healthy polyunsaturated fats... although it may not be necessary to cut out saturated fats to begin with. They aren't associated with CVD although it IS possible for some people on this diet to see their LDL-P skyrocket and that is definitely alarming.  Weight loss may result in lower cholesterol but it isn't a given. As a matter of fact on this diet it's a flip of the coin.   Sorry for so much babbling. I guess I just want confirmation that doing this would be safe. I've figured out my macros and planned weekly diets to fit within them. This cholesterol thing just threw me for a loop.   Life is all about risk and managing it.  There is a possibility that the introduction and availability of fats will cause a spike in your LDL-C and by virtue your LDL-P.  There are no long term studies on the effects this diet has on your body but given this... what I would say is that even if the diet DOES do this we would still have to see a continuous level of increased LDL-C/LDL-P to be worried.  There is only one way to determine if this diet is not safe for you - doing it and finding out.  Nobody can predict the future for you.  However, all science thus far indicates this will benefit you if properly adhered to."

xxketo,3d65so,justcarri,4,Mon Jul 13 20:49:49 2015 UTC,"I have PCOS, I'm not in a high weight range, but I did start it to help with PCOS as well as lose some weight.  I recently read a study that suggested some women with PCOS may have much lower base metabolic rates and that your deficit may need to be more significant to see weight loss that others may experience more easily.  Also, your macros don't match up, you put 1500 calories, but 20g carb+ 140g protein +150g fat = 1990 calories.  If you're hitting those macros you may be consuming more calories than you think.  Also, my weight loss has been fairly slow (partially because I don't hold as much weight so losing the last bit takes more effort), but one thing that I found to help break a stall was focusing on starting eating later.  I'll start with tea or coffee and cream in the morning, and maybe some small bite of something (like 50-100 cals), but may not really eat until 10-11 am.  The other question I have for you is how much vegetable intake are you getting and also do you consume fermented foods?  You can do it!  And dude, you've lost 37 lbs, that's still great!!  One last thing, since you're now exercising quite a bit, remember that your weight may not be reflecting the changes happening to your body as you put on muscle, remember it's more dense than fat here is a great example of body change without weight change.  But please tell me what you're eating :)"

I stay at a stable weight for a few months and then suddenly drop 5 to 10 pounds. Although it was frustrating at first, I trust this trend will continue, so I keep with the plan. When I feel discouraged, I track carefully and increase exercise and water intake. ETA: I do notice that I still lose sizes though the numbers on the scale don't change."

I eventually started to feel better and my skin cleared up quite a bit from avoiding carbs, which helped keep my motivation up. I hit 199 at the beginning of June and despite staying the course, I've been hovering around 200 ever since. It's a process.  Just try to be patient with yourself and I bet you will achieve your goals."

xxketo,3d65so,happyjoylove,2,Mon Jul 13 21:45:13 2015 UTC,"The most important thing you need to do is figure out your RMR (resting metabolic rate). If you have PCOS chances are the generic caloric calculators are calculating this too high. There have been multiple studies that show a correlation between a decreased RMR and having PCOS. Go to a doctor or fitness clinic to get this done. Usually costs under $100.00. This will give you the basic amount of calories you need to survive. Once you have this factual number then you can calculate the real deficit you need.  As a side note, my RMR is very low. Am 5'8"", weight lift and am still chunkier than I would wish. To simply maintain I cannot eat above 1200 kcals a day. It wasn't until I had this test done that a lot of pieces fell into place.  Are you taking medication for PCOS? For those of us who have insulin resistance as part of the PCOS package medications like Glucophage help regulate things and enable weight loss to occur. When I was diagnosed 15 years ago this medication started the ball rolling and enabled me to lose over 150 pounds (and have kept it off). At that time my doctor also encouraged a keto type diet (though that term wasn't used).  Weight loss will be slow and it seriously sucks. However, it is possible. Last thing to note, and this is my own personal experience, while the typical person on keto embraces fat to keep your calories in check you may want to consider leaner cuts of meat and go easy on the dairy. I use IF (intermittent fasting), make sure I meet my protein goals first and foremost and use my fats carefully so I don't exceed my 1200 kcals a day. Also, I am a night eater so my ""window"" to eat is late and that keeps midnight snacking at bay since I go to bed full.  Best of luck and if you have any questions my message box is always open!!"

These herbs seem to work for a lot of folks, but keep in mind the fact that I am NOT a physician and I do NOT recommend specific treatments for anyone else! I suspect that dropping grains completely had quite a bit to do with it.

And I'm still not entirely convinced that it's a sustainable diet for the long haul, at least for me.

From what I read so far, (I have eczema) this could be linked to inflammation and low function in how the cells handle glucose.

xxketo,3d32ka,melissakv,7,Mon Jul 13 03:18:30 2015 UTC,Spotting is normal.  Hormones stored in your fat are getting released as the fat gets tapped.  Stock up on panty liners and/or pads and ride it out without carbing up.

xxketo,3d2t6v,PhrygianHalfCadence,3,Mon Jul 13 01:56:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't spend money on bacon if you've already got access to it through the meal plan. Can you swipe extras from your uni cafeteria at breakfast and take them with you to snack on through the day? Will there be hardboiled eggs, perhaps, at breakfast, that you can grab a few of? What's your salad bar situation like? I'd imagine that it would be fairly easy to make a big keto salad with whatever plain protein they are serving topped with veggies, ranch, etc., from the salad bar for lunch/dinner.   As far as what I'd keep around, $20 is pretty tight. I think you are probably going to have to shop the sales at the local grocery stores to determine what you are going to get. I'd go for things that you can't get on the meal plan, but that are fairly long-lasting. One week I might use the $20 to buy a big bag of chicken thighs and some seasonings, for example. Hopefully that would last longer than a week and then you've started to stock your pantry a little at a time.   Do you have any dollar stores near you? They are often a good source for cheap spices/hot sauce/salsa.   I'd try and stock up on frozen veggies, when you can find them cheap- often in my area frozen green beans are cheaper than fresh and you can get a decent sized bag for about a dollar.   I think I'd probably keep it pretty simple with stuff in the dorm kitchen- some meat and some frozen veggies to throw together a meal, but really your best bet is eating most meals in the cafeteria for variety. I might try and focus on eating almost all meals there, and then using the little bit of cash you do have to buy little treats once in a while- a diet soda with friends or an emergency beef jerky when you're out and about and get caught without food.   Good luck!"
xxketo,3d2t6v,ketobento,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:16:55 2015 UTC,"The usual options for breakfast and pork bacon, turkey bacon, biscuits & gravy, pork sausage, hardboiled eggs and scrambled eggs.  Cereal and fruit are always available.  We also have The Omelette Lady who makes custom omelettes with a mix of ham, cheese, mushrooms, spinach, onions, and some other ingredients.  I know I'll take advantage of that.  The salad bar is nice but there aren't any meat options.  There's a variety of dressings. The main protein I use is hard boiled egg, but even then, it tends to be freezing cold.  Would it be silly to bring my own bacon bits?  My main options for groceries are Kroger and a mini-Walmart.  There is a dollar store about a 15-20 minute walk from my dorm that I'd rather not go to.  My main fear of eating in the dining hall is I won't be able to measure out my portions exactly.  I can estimate a cup of lettuce or a tablespoon of dressing.  I think my starting goal should be to get into ketosis and watch my portions."
xxketo,3d2t6v,biomags,2,Mon Jul 13 04:01:15 2015 UTC,Be sure to ask if there is anything added to the omelet mixture. Some places add pancake batter.
xxketo,3d2t6v,foxyRenard,2,Mon Jul 13 13:58:16 2015 UTC,"hmmm.... I'm betting they make burgers (mine did). And I'm betting they are the frozen patty kind. Once you know the weight of one, you know them all. Ask a server how many oz the patties are, or suck it up and bring a scale one day. I'm betting 4.  I have a feeling you'll be eating a lot of those burger patties... :) I love burger patties on a salad! The fat runs out and makes a warm dressing. Add a splash of vinegar! Yum!"
xxketo,3d2t6v,biomags,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:03:01 2015 UTC,I think one day I'm going to bring a food scale and find out how many ounces everything is.
xxketo,3d2t6v,stefanielaine,3,Tue Jul 14 03:10:51 2015 UTC,"It is doable.  First, make breakfast your main meal of the day. You should try to get a good amount of your calories here since you know you always can.   Look up IF and think about if that would work for you, or if eating two meals a day would work.  Next take stock in what the dinning hall really is serving.   My dinning hall had a salad bar, does yours? If not, does it serve steamed or a healthy option for vegetables most days (broccoli, cauliflower, ect). If yours does, this can easily serve as your vegetables. Buy the bare minimal vegetables with your $20.   Most dinning halls have certain staples that are offered often. Burgers are great if they show up often. Just ask for one without the bun or take the bun off.   I would pick days where the protein will not be covered in sauce as your 3-4 dine in meals. Any of these show up (not breaded), so do you, baked chicken, burgers, fish, pork chops, steak. This means being flexible. Lunch might be better one day, dinner the next.  With your money, you will have more flexibility to make nicer meals if you get a good chunk of you calories at breakfast and it offers an option for vegetables. If your cafeteria doesn't really have a vegetable option, buy frozen broccoli or cauliflower. This should run you $5-10/week. Then buy really cheap meat. I can usually find chicken thighs for around $1/pound. Again $5-10/week. You will have to scrimp some weeks so you can buy fat (olive oil/butter/cheese), salt, and spices.  See if your parents will send you with old spices from your cupboard. They taste better fresher, but they still add flavor when not fresh. See about finding an ethnic market or check the international isle/section in your store. The spices tend to be significantly cheaper and fresher there.  I love adding a dried herb, lemon, and butter to chicken thighs."
xxketo,3d2t6v,stefanielaine,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:55:54 2015 UTC,"The burgers are delicious.  They have bags of buns and the patties are on a tray underneath the hot lights.  I usually grab a patty, a piece of cheese (American), and add lettuce and ketchup.  Our salad bar has fresh veggies.  The steamed veggies are kind of eh.  On a side note, they serve fried broccoli and fried zucchini.  They taste horrible, yet for some reason a large majority of students eat them.  We have upper cuts at my school which means we can use an extra meal swipe for 'better' food.  That includes crab legs & cakes, lobster tail, angus mushroom burger, scallops, steak, and other goodies."
xxketo,3d2t6v,stefanielaine,2,Tue Jul 14 03:09:26 2015 UTC,"Hello! Not sure if you mean that's what you currently eat or that's what you plan to eat on keto but if it's the latter, heads up, ketchup has a boatload of sugar. Probably not enough to put you over on carbs for the day, but for me personally, consuming any sugar at all seriously reduces my ability to manage my appetite and cravings. YMMV. Good luck!"

xxketo,3cydm2,mllestrong,4,Sun Jul 12 04:19:16 2015 UTC,"Holy shit this just clicked for me. I read an article a while back that said grains can contribute to the inflammation cycle in your body.

I am only down 11 pounds so I thought there's no way it could be from the weight loss already, but this makes so much sense. I must have reduced inflammation from the lack of grains!

xxketo,3cy1uj,bobaimee,3,Sun Jul 12 15:21:59 2015 UTC,"I'm almost your size. Started at 170, wanted to get to 145, but at 150, realized that I was really sabotaging my fitness goals by limiting my calories. I wasn't hungry, but I was weak. This only took a couple of months, since you asked.   So then I raised my kcal to 1500. That's been working fine for about 6 weeks now. I'm not losing any weight, but I keep looking better and better!   I'm not exercising a ton, (not lifting heavy) since the yardwork is keeping me busy, and just this last week, I started feeling ravenous. I haven't felt hungry since I started ketoing in March! So I decided to listen to it and for the last 4 days I was naturally sated at 1700-1750. So I'm just going to go with this for a bit and see what happens.    I have every confidence I'll continue to get smaller, since I'm slowly building muscle mass (it's not the most effective way to build mass, but I don't like eating that much :)). And since I like how I look now, that's not going to be a problem, I'd imagine.  If you enjoy the clear-headedness of a fasted state, try intermittent fasting (IF). Basically you fast for 18 hours, then consume all your calories in a 6 hour period (or 12/12, 16/8. It's flexible). Some people swear by it."

xxketo,3cy1uj,nstz,2,Mon Jul 13 11:45:19 2015 UTC,"I do feel a bit weak even though I am fit, like after walking up the stairs my legs feel so heavy.  1500 - 1700 calories a day is a lot (to me) so I think it is amazing that you are likely recomping without lifting.  Do you measure since you are not losing weight but changing shape?  IF could work for me and I have thought about it. I think I will save it for a plateau."
xxketo,3cy1uj,bobaimee,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:24:13 2015 UTC,"1500 kcal felt like a lot in the beginning. It took a week or two to get used to it. I didn't feel great eating so much meat to hit my protein goals, so I added a protein shake. Then it was hard to hit the fat macros because I was no longer eating as much meat. So I started adding extra cream to my coffee and in the afternoon drinking an enormous iced cafe breve (cold brew coffee + half and half + zero cal torani syrup.)   But in the last week when I've been getting hungry it hasn't been too difficult. I still use the protein shakes a lot, but I don't find myself playing catch up with fats. Somehow it's all shaking out. My  Fitbit HR says that I'm burning about 1850-1900 per day, so I'm still running a deficit.  I measure, but it doesn't look like I'm measure the right stuff-- I only measure bust, waist, hips. 41-30-40 currently. Before I started it was 41-32-42. Not a big change. But I can see how clothes look different. I was wearing leggings and a tank yesterday and it looked like me, but with Spanx. Not a whole bunch different, but smoother and more trim-looking than even a couple of weeks ago. Thighs look thinner. Thigh gap looks wider. Arms seem a little more defined. That kind of thing.   Plus, I think hauling a pushmower around 3/4 of an acre twice a week would build muscle in anyone. It's not lifting, but it's harder than cardio. It's a pretty decent workout. Almost enough to not want to fix the self-propelled mower. Almost."
xxketo,3cy1uj,bobaimee,2,Mon Jul 13 02:04:33 2015 UTC,"Me! I'm 6'0"" and based on how my clothes are fitting (this is a guess... I don't weigh myself) probably 175. I'm within normal weight range for my height and at a mostly-comfortable weight for my build. I have a lot of muscle as well. I've been happiest at around 165. My lowest weight was 125 (ED), but even at 150 (which I maintained for a while after recovery) I was still a bit too thin.   Started keto at a probable weight of 185. I didn't do it to lose a ton of weight. Mostly, I wanted to overhaul my diet because almost everyone in my family is diabetic, or prediabetic, and it was scary how much sugar I was eating. I also have ibs and my biggest trigger is wheat, second-biggest is sugar. Who knows why I was still eating that shit when it made me so miserable.   I started in late May and have only lost 10 pounds (but several inches). You won't lose weight as quickly as someone needing to lost 100+ pounds. You just won't. But that's okay. It comes off eventually. My stranger's opinion, your calorie count seems really low, but if it works for you then it works for you. I personally eat at a 500-900 calorie deficit. I work out 6 days a week too, lots of weightlifting and HIIT. My carbs are 25-30/day.  There's been really no clear indication if I've been in ketosis or not. Occasionally I will start smelling ammonia or a random fruity smell after working out, but the only consistent and noticeable change I've experienced is diabolically horrible smelling pee, which seems to be common with people on this diet. So, you could be or you could not be. If your carbs are really only 20g, there's a 99.9999999% chance you're in ketosis.   Keep a log if you don't already. I'm using myfitnesspal and it's really helped me stay with it."
xxketo,3cy1uj,bobaimee,2,Sat Jul 11 22:00:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for responding, it looks like we have the same goals and almost same keto start time!    One of the reasons I chose keto is becasue I am just a sugar and wheat fiend and I need to completely quit those things because I am simply not capable of reducing them or eating responsibly. I just binge. They are like heroin to me.  I am hoping that if I stay on keto for long enough I will kick the habit and those things will become gross to me, or at least I won't be able to tolerate them as much. Here's hoping!  I also have the stinky pee and weird smelling sweat after working out, so probably I am in ketosis! I log and weigh everthing on myfitness pal so I think i should be around the 20 gram mark for carbs daily.  Gonna stay positive!"
xxketo,3cy1uj,sellyberry,2,Sat Jul 11 22:11:10 2015 UTC,"I hear you on the heroin comparison. Sugar addiction is 110% real. I dieted for 2/3 of my life (I was overweight as a kid) and it was so unbelievably hard to eat healthy when I would still include bread, pasta, and sugar-laden ""health"" foods. Like putting a fire out with alcohol. And then I go keto for all of two weeks and I'm wondering why I'm never hungry.   You will kick it eventually. Food will taste so much richer and sweeter when your taste acclimates to only low-carb foods. I had some cantaloupe the other day and about died it was so sweet. It was like eating candy... And I hardly ever ate walnuts/seeds because I used to think they were flavorless. Lately walnuts have tasted AMAZING. Did you know they are actually very sweet and super buttery? I didn't until recently. lol"
xxketo,3cy1uj,Toofywoofy,3,Sat Jul 11 22:19:45 2015 UTC,I have noticed that 'sweet' things are so much sweeter now. I ate one single cherry today and it felt like it exploded in my mouth with flavour and sweetness.
xxketo,3cy1uj,KittenWhispersnCandy,2,Sat Jul 11 22:40:00 2015 UTC,"I'm about 23 lbs. from my favorite weight - for me.  I don't need or want to be super thin, I want to be healthy and live a helluva lot longer than I am now.  I know the weight will come down - already had a big drop - so I've decided, since I am so close and losing,  not to make the weight loss the main goal.  1000 calories a day, is so very low on calories!  I am 5'8"" and at around 1500 - I am fairly active, but nothing dramatic - lots of cardio as I enjoy it, and started yoga this week (ok, today, but I am sticking with it).   I have tried super low and higher and it took some experimentation to find where I felt good and strong aND lost - I think I'd switch the focus from the scale to the way you FEEL.  The strength and power you have.  No, there isn't a starvation mode, but I am positive I screwed up things by eating too few calories for too long.  It has taken awhile to get back on track.  Good luck!"
xxketo,3cy1uj,Toofywoofy,2,Sun Jul 12 02:23:01 2015 UTC,"Me! I've been hovering around 114 forever and the last 10 lbs are the hardest.   Truth be told, I haven't been as disciplined as I would like and thats probably my main issue.  I hover around 20g carbs on a good day and around 60g on the not so good days. I haven't gained more than 3 lbs since I started keto but I haven't seen too much progress the other way either.   I honestly think I'm just eating too much since I'm so small. (5""2') when I eat around 1000 cals my body feels better. BUT, I get mixed responses from people when I reveal his information.   The worst part about not being overweight when you start is when people tell you you're already skinny enough. :/ I don't walk around showing off my belly fat! But it's also harder for me to be strict because of this. There's less motivation when people aren't on your side.  I go to the gym about 3x a week. I'm training for a 5k right now. I do about 30 mins of cardio and an additional 20 mins of strength. I think this has also helped me maintain my results a bit more since I'm at  least being active and not stuck in a computer chair for what would have almost certainly been another hour of the day.   Good luck to you! Keto definitely works for us smaller girls. Just stay focused and do what makes you feel good. Since your closer to your goal, it's important to figure out what maintenance on keto will look like for you! If ever you feel like your not seeing progress, eat at maintenance for a bit and then go back to your deficit. Sometimes it helps to shake things up!"
xxketo,3cy1uj,TippingMyHat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:27:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for your advice!  I hear you with the mixed responses from people who know you are trying to lose weight. When I lived in Australia and the UK people would not be encouraging about me wanting to lose weight because I was already 'small' to them. Now I live in Italy where people are skinnier and it is slighly more acceptable to want to be really slim. Most of my female friends that know I am trying to lose weight are pretty supportive about it, like it is totally normal to be 5'5 and 110 lbs.  They are just not supportive of the diet choice because not eating carbs in Italy is basically spitting on the flag. But its not such a big deal. Clothing sizes are smaller here, there is a lot of high fashion and people generally put a lot of effort into their appearance so it is a bit easier to stick to a diet here. My lifestyle in Aus/UK was very much going out to eat and drinking ALOT.  114lbs at 5'2 sounds about perfect to me, you must be really proud to get that far!"

xxketo,3cy1uj,kcbrush,2,Sun Jul 12 14:38:51 2015 UTC,"I'm 33 and 150.  Don't use the sticks in the morning, you're testing for excess ketones, and when you're sleeping your body isn't burning a lot of fat for energy and you are using the ketones already in your blood as energy, so if you test at the end of the day you'll have different results.   Depends on what you call 'starting' weight. I've been doing some form of keto for over 3 years, I'm in my second pregnancy and still doing keto. I added carbs at the doctors request with my first and I'm not do as much of that this time. First time I was 158 when I fell pregnant (because I hit 145 and thought I could drink beer again so I gained back) and hit 198, so gained 40 pounds, 6 months PP I was easily down to 165 without trying, then I started serious keto again and got down to 153 before falling pregnant with the second, I kept losing because of loss of appetite (no vomiting tho!) and was 147 and now at 14 weeks I am 150. My goal is to not go over 170, but we shall see.  So in January/February I will have a new start weight and I wont care about dieting for at least 4 months ;)"
xxketo,3cxgiw,splendidjack,10,Sat Jul 11 17:21:09 2015 UTC,"Congrats!   One thing I want to add is, if you haven't had a period in that much time, I'd be concerned about endometrial hyperplasia (if you haven't already checked into it). Growing too much endometrium without shedding it is a cancer risk. I don't know whether you've seen a doctor about it yet, but definitely do so if you can!"
xxketo,3cxgiw,40000headmen,3,Sat Jul 11 20:43:50 2015 UTC,"Also, if it goes away again, and you aren't trying to get pregnant, try out some sort of  hormonal birth control. It will prevent the lining from over-growing or getting wonky."

It's not a combo pill, and you only have to be on it for a few days, but it will trigger enough of a hormonal withdrawal to bring on a bleed.   But! You might not even have to worry about it, if keto is bringing on the shedding :-). I went from having 1-2 periods a year (off the pill) to having a period every month after keto."

I have 85% chocolate from my local co-op in the UK, but I know Lindt do an 85%, a 90%, 95% and a 99% so you can find the right level for you. Just look closely at the macros and you should find an amount (for me it's 1-4 squares a day of 85%) that works for your calorie goals and macros.  You can also get some roasted cacao nibs, and use them in deserts and things :)"

I can spread out less chocolate across the fat bombs – I might use six small squares for two or three fat bombs – and it has enough crunch to satisfy my cravings.

xxketo,3cxkyu,Mikarina,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:04:18 2015 UTC,"I tried the 99% Lindt and did not care for the taste.

There's a certain element of faith involved in getting through the post-water weight dark times. ;)   Also, you are actually losing. Most of it is water, true, but underneath that, if you're at a calorie deficit, your body has to get energy from somewhere, and it's not from water!

Then he texted that parking was difficult (I'd biked there as its only about 2 miles from my house) and so he was bailing. That was kind of the straw that broke the camels back so I sent him a text calling him out on not treating me well recently. Then he replied that yep, he was over the relationship. So now I'm single again. Had a good cry last night. I'm sure the wine helped those tears fall.   But today is a new day. I'm currently rehydrating, just ate a nice breakfast of sausage and eggs, and will go on my run in a little bit. Then I'd planned on working in my yard, but may go off to a movie instead.

Lying in bed last night I was thinking about how stress is more damaging to me than the things that I'm stressed about.  Most of the things that I worry about never happen, and the things that happen usually aren't as bad as I think they will be.   The things that are the worst, I usually never even see coming.   All stress does is hurt me, it's not helpful at all.   I've known this for a while, but for the first time I'm really starting to feel it to be true.    This morning when I woke up I was worrying about of all of the things that are changing in my life, none of it was productive and I paused and thought, 'How is this helping me?'  So I stopped and did something productive instead.   I think this is going to be my new mantra when I start worrying - 'How is this helping me?'"

I was using reddit on my phone, and I realized that every few weeks I'd continue to get creepy messages - so here I am.  I was formerly shade_thrower, but I didn't post much.  Let's talk stats: Well, we went to Vegas last week and we don't drink. We got back late Sunday night, and I had a pretty abysmal week at work and emotionally. Hit a crossroads with my bf that involved some very heavy conversations but we are through the thick of it. I can see my life with him. It makes it very hard when I have no way of coping (can't eat, and can't drink) when I feel stressed/sad.   I've consistently kept in Keto since starting (woo we are 1 month in). I weighed myself before we left, and i was 135. I weighed myself a week later, and took measurements (yesterday). I'm down 1-1.5 Inches in most places, but only .5 of a pound lost? I contribute it to getting close to my period. So the scale said 135.4. Womp.  Personally, I'm trying not to measure and weigh a whole ton. My boyfriend is noticing weight loss, and so am I. Am fitting in smalls and mediums with relative ease, and not as afraid to be naked. I can feel my stomach shrinking, but I'm trying really hard not to focus on the numbers (former eating disordered person). For the most part, this is a lifestyle change and not a weight miracle.  I'm going to pick my dog up today from my parent's house 45 minutes away. Can't wait to get him home, so we can start walking him again. We miss him so much.   KCKO ladies.

I posted a few days ago about a pretty serious fall I took after finding my new reduced Keto alcohol tolerance, and I'm still feeling dizzy and tired from it, but work is relentless and I can't take time off. Not only that but I found a lump in my breast the day before fiance had to leave for a month for work (which was right before my fall). I'm going in tomorrow for a biopsy, which is pretty scary. They did already do an ultrasound on it, and it looks like it is a hollow fluid-filled cyst and unlikely cancerous, but I'm still afraid.

Feeling a bit fed up because I've gained 2lb in the last week - I've been so hungry and eating way over my calories (though sticking under 20g carbs. Hi cheese!) but it's the first day of my new pill packet so I'm hoping that means my appetite will settle down a bit now. I was eating so much that it's a good job I'm vegetarian or my cats might have been worried they were my next snack!"

xxketo,3ctwfg,beesyrup,14,Fri Jul 10 19:09:33 2015 UTC,"Oh man, we all get to pick and choose which parts of us come out here. All of our realities are messy in our own ways. I choose to reveal my fitness victories and my 24 pound weight loss, but I omit the fact (other than facetiously) that I truly believe I will be alone forever. I have a super small friend set who I do not see often enough, so I do all the training as a way to be productively alone rather than in my house with my pets all the time. I have legitimately never had any sort of relationship that has lasted more than 3 months in the 7 years since my divorce. There's definitely something wrong with my insides. But, oh man, throw in alcohol and flirty drunk men and I can push all that out of my mind for a while even if I feel like shit for the next 2 days. I'm a 31 year old, librarian, binge drinker and if that isn't the saddest truth, I'm not sure what is.  I am a huge believer in ""fake it till you make it,"" and if you faking it here with us helps move you to a better place physically or emotionally, then there is no harm in putting on a positive front. You are one of my favorite internet people, and I truly hope you don't disappear.   With the calories though, is 1385 really enough? While I'm laying down 90% of my life, I'm staying under 1500. I can't imagine working out as much as you have been lately and eating under 1400.   I think you're kicking ass, and if alcohol is becoming a problem high five for figuring that out now! I believe in you, internet friend."
xxketo,3ctwfg,BooksNShizzz,7,Fri Jul 10 20:30:28 2015 UTC,"In the most emapthetic way possible I say this (and not disregarding ANY of your feelings or experiences) - but it sounds like a big part of what you're feeling is BOREDOM.   I don't mean that dismissively - like 'Oh jeez shut up you're just bored'. Boredom can be really really destructive and isolating and compounding. I know when I moved to a new city and knew NO ONE and hated my job and had nothing to do, it was the most unhealthy I've been both physically and mentally. I was too alone and lonely to be brave enough to go out there and be a joiner, and too ashamed and uncertain to go to a gym or fitness class, and way too socially insecure (which was a first for me) to try and make friends. On top of feeling sad/lonely/awful/worthless - I was so fucking bored! I'd go home from work and have NOTHING to do, NOTHING to look forward to, so my life was pretty much 'oh gee, I guess I'll watch the Bachelor and order a pizza'.   One day I just had enough and decided 'fuck it - I'm going to be a goddamned champion in this city'. So I randomly volunteered for a bunch of events (book awards, gala fundraisers, etc) and Boards. I started feeling like a more competent human, regrew my sense of self-worth, and ended up being SO busy that I don't have (a lot) of time to be down.   Anyway - TLDR, this reminded me of when I was really bored and lonely so I got busy."
xxketo,3ctwfg,dangeryoung,2,Fri Jul 10 20:55:53 2015 UTC,"I think you are 100% correct and thank you for pointing this out.  It's like a vicious cycle mind-fuck for me.  I've retreated from all the friendships I have had over the years as everyone got so into their kids and I have no kids or interest in kids.  I also kind of felt all these people I had as friends were just boring themselves and I was already bored so why continue this charade with these people?  I slowly withdrew entirely from the world and any interests I have and I let everything lay fallow and it festered in boredom and I developed unhealthy habits and patterns of thought to replace an active and engaging life.  That was compounded by crippling low self esteem and anxiety.  In the past few months I have been putting forth a lot of effort to find things I can actively engage in and contribute to in some meaningful way.  I haven't been finding anything but I sure have been doing a lot of seeking.  I think maybe my asinine perfectionism comes into play with this and I'm discounting activities I could be doing to help re-grow my sense of self-worth (I love that statement) just because they don't meet some imaginary standard in my head.  I need to just do like you did and throw myself into a few activities and stop making excuses for why those activities suck or are stupid.  Or why I don't have anything to contribute to the stream, which is fucking bullshit, everyone has something to contribute.  Thanks for this, it's given steam to a direction I was headed in but abandoned when it wasn't immediately fruitful."

I also agree with the above poster, that you are bored. It is clear that you are an intelligent woman. You need to find something to do with that brain of yours, and something that helps your self esteem and I think the weight loss, problems with your marriage and job (and hungry cats) will all start improving.

I know exactly how you feel - when I had moved, all my pals suddenly had these fabulous jobs (one of my gfs texted me photos of her out one night DANCING WITH BEYONCE). I also cut myself off and cuddled up into a ball for a while.   When I forced myself to become a joiner, there were still a lot of challenges. A lot of people are assholes and you have to work with them. I volunteered on an arts award gala which was run by an incompetent semi-literate fascist and I had to be her bitch for a week. It was awful but hey - it got me out of the house, and I bonded with a bunch of other people over how much we hated the incompetent fascist piglet. No matter what, make sure you keep doing you.

xxketo,3ctwfg,anbeav,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:05:48 2015 UTC,"That's why I liked the gym.  In May and June I had been looking for support groups for eating disordered people or anxiety people or any kind of people I could relate to.  I went to two OA meetings but the whole god vibe was just not for me.  I called the National Eating Disorder association to find support groups, and found none.  I scoured the internet and couldn't find anything.  I even tried Meet Up groups to get out and engage.  I tried rekindling old friendships and was reminded why those friendships were OLD.  I might keep going to the gym but just not go crazy doing it.  I have an A-B-A workout to do for lifting so that's three days a week.  I was doing 30 minutes of cardio after lifting so that doesn't seem like too, too much right?  Then on off days I was just doing 30 or so minutes of cardio.  One day I did an hour.  Maybe an hour is too much.  I am not going to stop or give up.  I know that if I returned to carbs and my old ways I will be in excruciating back pain and over 230 lbs again in probably a week.  I really don't want that so I am just going to keep trying in many directions to change."
xxketo,3ctwfg,maiamou,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:36:58 2015 UTC,"That workout plan seems reasonable but rest days are for rest so walk or something light but nothing that demands more recovery time.

xxketo,3ctwfg,maiamou,4,Sat Jul 11 13:47:16 2015 UTC,"I've never posted before (Day 6 of Keto), but your comments compelled me to reply. See, I think all of this stuff (emotional, physical, etc.) gets dredged up when food is no longer an outlet for emotions. It forces you to take stock, clear-eyed and painfully sometimes, at your life, past, present and future--and that can be rough. That's why obesity is so incredibly complex.   When I eat a lot of carbs and sugar, the brain fog helps me procrastinate all the important decisions in my life. Living without the fog is great for all sorts of reasons, but almost too sobering at times.  This is stuff you probably already know, but maybe it helps to hear it again. All I can say is that I'm going through the same thing. Obesity is incredibly isolating. It's so much easier to self-medicate. I've read anecdotally that a good number of patients that have had bariatric surgery turn to alcohol. There is something to that."
xxketo,3ctwfg,laridaes,2,Sat Jul 11 13:56:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100%.  I had lost 42% of my body weight on a low carb food plan 8 years ago and after 11 months of sticking to that plan without exception I dove off the deep end into a vat of alcohol.  At the time a woman I knew told me I had done that because I had removed my main coping mechanism: food, and had not replaced it with anything.  Thus, enter alcohol.  When I started keto in March I was determined not to let that happen again and I did well for a while at managing all my emotions and habits, but then I stopped doing as well and alcohol crept back in steadily as my crutch.  Yeah so now that I have put it out there and am not hiding it anymore I guess it's time to change that.  Congrats on starting keto, it is the best way to eat that I have ever heard of in my life.  For the brief time I was faithful to the program I felt like 50 billion dollars of pure gold.  Thanks for reaching out!"

It's a lot easier to ignore, push aside, hide under the carb brain fog, etc. You are actually wrestling with it--how amazing for you!  We are almost the same age--I'm 46--and I know how the years seem to pass and how you can feel frustrated that you are still dealing with the same issues.

xxketo,3ctwfg,delillie,2,Sat Jul 11 14:15:22 2015 UTC,"Oh beesyrup!  I am 53, widowed for ten years, both kids out of the house - I am fortunate I suppose that I have a very good job (legal assistant) that is super fulfilling, but I struggle too - on weekends especially. So, what I do and have been doing for awhile that helps me is I got into Meetup.com to find some like-minded people.  I write, and found a few local writing groups (where I am the oldest, but hey whatever!).  I started taking yoga lessons.  I am not a cat-owned person, but husky-owned so the guilt is high when I leave them on the weekends as I am gone so much during the week, but they deal (they just sleep anyway - I have lazy huskies). When my husband died, I realized all my friends were internet friends - so I started to visit them here and there, and worked hard to make friends locally. It wasn't easy. It is still not easy! I envy my daughter sometimes, and all her friends from college and high school!  And I am still hoping to run into that guys or girl who can be a running buddy with me -  most women near my age are still married, or have grandkids - I am somewhat of an anomaly.  (I also am not a church goer, but that is always an option - just not for me). Anyway.

xxketo,3ctwfg,laridaes,10,Sat Jul 11 14:12:25 2015 UTC,"Okay first of all you need to be kinder to yourself. No one here started out 100% and never made a mistake. We all learned as we went and so will you.   Second of all what you call a failure I call a great beginning, a learning process, and a chance to improve. Half of the days you ate under your deficit and I'm assuming many if not most of the other 60 days were probably under your TDEE (maintenance calories). That's a solid start. You also made under 30g 75% of the time. Also staying under 100g carbs still counts as low carb, so you ate low carb 95% of the time.   You're beating yourself up for not being perfect well guess what none of us are. Your failures seem so big to you that you can't see how successful you've been. You can do this and you have been doing this! Don't get discouraged."
xxketo,3ctwfg,AntiPhat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:27:31 2015 UTC,"Okay first of all you need to be kinder to yourself.    Yes that's true!  I think at least one of my problems here is that I continue to compare myself now where I'm measuring and tracking macros to a previous point in my life where I lost 85 lbs in 11 months on low carb (by portion size, if that makes sense which I don't think it does) where I tracked no macros at all but weighed everything.  And yes, definitely beating myself up about being imperfect but I guess I'm comparing myself to myself of over 8 years ago which is not helpful!  Now is not then.  At higher weights these calorie overages won't effect me as greatly but as I get lower in weight they will have a big impact.  I think my 1 pound gain this week probably had a lot to do with the calorie overages over the past 60 days and nothing at all to do with starting to train in the gym.  I just feel like shit and wanted to let then entire internet know I haven't been perfect like I know that I probably can be of I choose to be.  Ugh that sounds insane but that's what I think!"
xxketo,3ctwfg,Sister_State_Trooper,5,Sun Jul 12 03:26:35 2015 UTC,"Everyone is different. Some people can quit things cold turkey, others need to slowly wean off. It's kind of like quitting smoking, not everyone is able to handle being able to stop smoking there and then (without substitutes).        Obesity kills, smoking kills and yet people still eat huge amounts of food and people still smoke. The fact that you decided several months ago to to take care of your body and became a healthier version of yourself, that is impressive as not everyone is able to do that and not everyone is willing to do that.        If you're going to talk about the negatives, you also need to look at the positives. Not only have you lost a significant amount of weight, but you also surpassed onederland! And I bet back when you started you never thought you could. When I first started my journey I was 200 lbs and I never ever thought I could shrink. Like people would tell me 'you're naturally thick, you're never going to reduce those legs or your body' and yet I proved them wrong. My mum used to think it was genetics as apparently my dad's sister was like that when she was alive. Maybe body shape is genetics but being obese definitely isn't.       I have so many imperfections but I concentrate on ones I can control and most of them can be controlled through nutrition/exercise and natural remedies. Only you can control this. If alcohol is too much for you, then maybe it's something you have to quit cold turkey on if you want to achieve success or have keto friendly options. Personally for me I find that I have to do things cold turkey and after it becomes a habit, I never crave them anymore.      Everyone is their own worst critic. I don't know why you feel like a failure. And I'm not just saying this because of what you've written, but I get inspired when people who weigh over 200 lbs start their weight loss journey. Like literally, I totally respect them especially when they have a good chunk to lose relative to their height.      I also wanted to add that you're one of the users whose posts I follow on the daily sticky. And I'd love to continue reading them. I don't post often on here but I felt I had to when I saw this post. So get rid of the demons (I know that's easier said than done) and continue inspiring people. This time next year, you'll be all the better for it.       Edit: formatting"

xxketo,3ctwfg,IllegalBeaver,2,Fri Jul 10 19:22:15 2015 UTC,"If you find it hard to quit smoking and alcohol cold turkey, why don't you set mini goals and see if that helps? So if you currently have 10 cigs a day, cut that by half for a week or 2, then cut that by half again and then again until you're down to 1 a day and then slowly start introducing 0 cig days until you're literally having 0 cigs. I know plenty of people have also done well with e-cigs until they no longer need either. I've never drunk or smoked so I don't know how hard it is, but I also think eating junk is a bit like them both in that it is also an addiction, so if you were able to start keto, then I believe you do have the strength to control everything else. We believe in you, you just need to believe in yourself."

What I wish for you is that you can sit with those feelings - whatever they are - and accept them without adding unhelpful judgment ('I am a complete failure'). You have people here who care, remember that. And, if things get too much for you to handle on your own, please get some support in your community.

I've lost over 115lbs during this time and I could have done it quicker but it's not a race for me. I go out for sushi once in awhile, drink a little too much wine some nights, etc. The next day I'll be bloated with water retention but I'll eat really high fat to counter balance it. It works for me. I've been overweight my whole life. It has varied from being slightly chubby as a child to 280 pounds as a 34 year old adult. Being fat was who I was. I identified with it, I was used to the rude comments/looks, the drowning of my sorrows in fast food, etc. What made me start this journey though? I was tired of not being able to move. I would routinely ask my kids to pick things up off the floor that I had dropped. It took effort to get up off the couch, out of bed, even walking up the stairs in our house was difficult. I wanted more, I needed more. I had tried many diets before but do you know why I stuck to this? Sure, it was way easier to lose weight when I was eating rich foods and was never hungry. But I really stuck to keto because I realized that I deserve this. I deserve to be healthy, I deserve to be happy. I was finally ready to make the commitment to myself. So back to this being a lifestyle change for me. I'm 5'6, 158lbs (8 pounds until my initial goal weight, holla!) and eat around 1400-1500 calories a day. I lose a couple pounds a month doing this with no exercise. My next goal is to join the gym and start lifting weights to help tone all the jiggly bits. I eat what I want and when I want. I take giant scoops of peanut butter and just eat it off the spoon. Try it, it's fucking amazing. Mmmm. I drink too much red wine on nights that I make rib eye steaks (a few times a month). Heck, with the steak, gorgonzola butter, roasted veggies (in olive oil), and wine we're talking about a 1500-1800 calorie meal! So much yum. Does it set me back? Nope, because it's all keto. Even the wine is maybe 12 carbs but by the end of the day I've still kept it under 30 net carbs. I go over my calories multiple times a week. I go over my carbs pretty much every single day. I try and stay under 30 net carbs but a lot of times it goes to 40 or 50. Because my body is so keto adapted it's not a big deal. Keto isn't difficult and you shouldn't be stressing about calories and every little gram of carbs. Eat when you're hungry (or if you want that fucking amazing spoonful of peanut butter), stick to keto foods, and if you're going to drink alcohol then stick to low carb ones. I spent most of year two drinking whiskey & coke zeros 4-5 nights a week. Like 4-6 shots a night. I still lost weight because it has zero carbs. Now on to the mental struggle. Does it get easier/better? YES. Does it go away entirely? Not yet for me. I've been fat my whole life so it's going to be awhile to get rid of that way of thinking. I see my before pics and I don't remember ever being that big. But then again I saw outwards at others and didn't look at full body pictures of myself on a daily basis. I get glimpses of myself all ready for the day and think I look fabulous. Then there are the times that I still see myself the same way as when I was at my highest. I know I've lost the weight, I know I look thinner, am thinner, yet I still see fat me. It's a struggle but it has gotten better with time. So after this long, drawn out post that seems to be all over the place (forgot my afternoon dose of adderall today!) the message I want to say to you is that it's a struggle. We all go through the mental part. You will overcome it with time if you believe in yourself. I deserve this, you deserve this, we all deserve this."
xxketo,3ctwfg,anbeav,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:19:28 2015 UTC,"Pfft, you're hardly a complete failure. It's really hard to make a total lifestyle change. You've done so well, though! Thirty-six pounds?! That's fabulous!   ""Do not despair if old ways look good to you. Despair only if you fall into them too often."" Which you're not, not by my reckoning. Too often for your comfort? Maybe, and you can fix that. Have you tried setting a minigoal to hit 30 or less for thirty days running? If you can do something consistently for thirty days, you can make a habit of it.   And quitting drinking is so helpful for me losing weight. I'd easily be drinking too much if I weren't off liquor right now. You're not alone in that! So maybe you've learned that drinking is triggering for you right now, and you need to step back. It's okay to learn from your own mistakes."
xxketo,3ctwfg,wonkafur,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:33:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really need to stop substituting overeating for overdrinking.  I guess this post is coming right in line with my attempt to drive that overdrinking into overtraining.  Thankfully I'm too lazy to do that, I guess?"
xxketo,3ctwfg,Lizabetanne,3,Sat Jul 11 13:53:53 2015 UTC,guess this post is coming right in line with my attempt to drive that overdrinking into overtraining.     I have hesitated to comment but since you posted I will no longer reserve comment. It's great to have energy and want to workout but my fear in the past week is that this is exactly what you're doing and while exercise is more productive than alcohol it can be just as destructive. You have to break the cycle of replacing one thing with another and get to the root of why the initial problem (overeating) started and address that
xxketo,3ctwfg,Lizabetanne,2,Sun Jul 12 07:12:14 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I've now realized that and am trying to do something about it.
xxketo,3ctwfg,hydrate_the_sponges,3,Sat Jul 11 03:30:13 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a delicate situation and it's always hard to know when to comment, I did repeatedly comment to take it easy and specifically commented when you were gung ho even with shin splints, so I didn't stay silent but was going to be more obvious if the overzealousness continued but don't want to overstep.  I said a single word, several times. I can't speak for others but I was personally concerned which is why I replied to your posts stating as such regarding the intensity with which you were exercising."

xxketo,3cum4o,eraser-dust,4,Fri Jul 10 22:22:13 2015 UTC,"Plan your meals ahead of time until you get the hang of it-fattier meat, smaller servings of lean meat, avocado, nuts, oils, butter, cream, cheese, coconut milk   It would help to see a food log to make specific suggestions"
xxketo,3cum4o,anbeav,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:37:01 2015 UTC,"At the moment breakfast is usually bacon and eggs or eggs and cheese, I don't really eat lunch unless it's a snack which usually is a pickle or two and tuna(mixed with mayo) or cheese slices, dinner usually consists of skin-on chicken or ground pork with vegetables like zucchini, green beans, and broccoli or a salad.  Stir fries and taco salads are my go-to meals.    Does that help at all?"
xxketo,3cum4o,anbeav,3,Fri Jul 10 22:45:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing how that much exceeds 80 g unless your meat portions are large, details help, how many oz meat? How far over your protein goal? Is it set at 0.8 grams per lb lean mass?"
xxketo,3cum4o,anbeav,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:47:02 2015 UTC,"It could be a portion issue.  Like I said, I'm fairly new and just trying to get things figured out.  I weigh the portions of my ground pork and such but with the chicken it's based on the servings listed on MFP.  When it comes to certain measures I don't know if to go by grams or the amount such as a tablespoon.  Even if my protein stays low enough, however, I still have issues getting all of my fat.  If I try to add in more fat it seems I end up with more protein.  Is it really just as simple as adding more oils or butter?  I used the keto calculator before all of this so I'm guessing the amounts are correct?"
xxketo,3cum4o,anbeav,5,Fri Jul 10 23:01:09 2015 UTC,"You can't really go based on MFP servings, you have to log the actual weight of the food you're eating.  In general, use grams for nearly everything.    Fat is as an upper limit, however that being said high deficits are counterproductive so there is some amount of fat you need to eat (don't eat over 30%) deficit but it's not a goal so if some days you're eating slightly less fat that's ok. How far are you from your fat macro?   Oils, butter, avocado, nuts, but if you're not using a scale to weigh everything many underestimate fat intake - you don't have to glob the fat on but just add slightly more oil or butter to cook with, add an avocado or serving of nuts and you quickly add 15-20 g fat   It would really help to help you if you link your log. Is that possible? It helps to troubleshoot to see the actual data"
xxketo,3cum4o,anbeav,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:07:52 2015 UTC,"How do I post my log?  I've been logging from the start, even on the two bad days, so everything is in MFP."
xxketo,3cum4o,P0PSTART,2,Fri Jul 10 23:24:32 2015 UTC,Copy and past your MFP diary link here and then make sure it's set so others can view it
xxketo,3cum4o,P0PSTART,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:26:34 2015 UTC,"http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/deathstarsandkittens  There are some discrepancies because the MFP database didn't quite have what I was looking for.  For instance yesterday for the chicken thighs, all four of them were ridiculously tiny which is why I had four instead of the normal two.  The back bacon had a similar issue.    Some other things were grouped together though they weren't eaten all at the same time (jello, mainly).  And the whipped cream was estimates.   That beings said, where is a good place to check for actual nutritional info?  There's so many sites out there."
xxketo,3cum4o,jareths_tight_pants,2,Fri Jul 10 23:36:24 2015 UTC,"So I would start with getting a food scale as ""chicken thigh"" is not an accurate way to log food. Other examples ""scrambled, 3 large eggs = 304 calories"" isn't accurate, 3 eggs = 210 calories and then you added butter separately so also don't pick entries based on someone else's recipe, log the food separately.   MFP is fine but you just have to double check so you're actually logging accurate information, if you're going to log might as well do it accurately. Always double check labels and use this site (http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/) to verify any information for things like meat and vegetables. You can search MFP for the database number and log the food by weight.    I would perhaps plan your meals for the next week ahead of time as you get the hang of it"

xxketo,3cum4o,Treat_Choself,3,Sat Jul 11 00:28:52 2015 UTC,"Not sure how much you are going over your protein macro by, but unless it's insanely high I doubt it would be a problem. If you are getting into the low 100's that shouldn't be too much!"

xxketo,3cum4o,Girloutofkitchen,2,Fri Jul 10 22:56:16 2015 UTC,Don't worry too much! You won't kick yourself out of ketosis at around 100g of protein! I keep my macros much closer to 100g of each without any problem staying in ketosis. In the beginning I was much more concerned about making such my macros were on point but I'm realizing that there's no harm in being flexible with fat and protein as long as you are getting enough protein and keeping your carbs low.
xxketo,3cum4o,Girloutofkitchen,3,Fri Jul 10 23:04:30 2015 UTC,"Nuts are a good high fat, low protein food. Just weigh your portions as it's easy to overeat them. I like macadamia nuts when I'm feeling indulgent. They have the perfect blend of fatty, salty, sweet."

It is also nice to see that other women have ups and downs. When I gained back two pounds one week I almost thought about quitting but seeing that I wasn't the only one kept me in it.

I really like the 90 day challenges but if you feel like changing the timeline it'd be fun to see that too! I do hope you choose to do some form of this again though, it's really motivating. I like the proposed dates for this one though, it doesn't include Halloween in them, so I don't need to be worried about ruining myself on the last day. >_>"

xxketo,3ctig8,ThrewThrowingThrown,5,Fri Jul 10 17:27:56 2015 UTC,"Breaking keto can make you feel sick if you're not careful because of the sudden change. Some people do ""cheat"" for special occasions, others don't. For many people it can lead to increased cravings and become a slippery slope where one carby meals turns into a day or a week, year etc. You'll also gain some water weight but it should drop back down within about a week after you resume keto.   Just wanted to give you the facts. :) In the end, the decision is yours and only you know how much self control you have to get right back on the wagon, and only you know if you're willing to deal with the consequences/side effects. Breaking keto on a regular basis is pretty counter productive so if you choose to, don't make a regular habit of it.  Of course, you could also trying making your own keto marshmallows and bringing them!!  http://ketodietapp.com/Blog/post/2013/11/16/Healthy-Low-Carb-Marshmallows"
xxketo,3ctig8,slothcough,2,Fri Jul 10 17:39:32 2015 UTC,Oh my god those marshmallows sound heavenly.  I started keto only recently and actually went off a few days in because of previous plans for my birthday. Part of it was roasting marshmallows.  I now want to try these because I love the fluffy texture of marshmallows but I don't miss the sugar content.
xxketo,3ctig8,eraser-dust,6,Mon Jul 13 08:49:36 2015 UTC,"I've broken keto numerous times, but have never had illness from it like others have experienced. I think the key is simply moderation - have a few roasted marshmallows, but don't gorge yourself.   I did a three week backpacking trip in which I was fluctuating between 10 to 12 miles a day, and while I watched my carbs, I did not keep strict keto as it's almost impossible when you have no refrigeration. I kept my carbs until 100 a day, and lost nearly 15 pounds in those three weeks. Granted I was highly active during that time period."
xxketo,3ctig8,electric_oven,3,Fri Jul 10 17:58:52 2015 UTC,You and I should talk /u/electric_oven. My spouse and I are planning a 10 day backpacking trip in October (~9 miles/day with elevation gain and drop).   Can I pick your brain about food and meals?!!?

xxketo,3ctig8,nauticalspoon,2,Sun Jul 12 23:21:27 2015 UTC,"It was pretty easy to stay under a 100 carbs a day. I used my JetBoil, and prepared lot of freeze-dried meals  before I left. If you're not comfortable preparing your own freeze-dried meals, I'm sure you've heard of Mountain House (and all the other companies that make them); for me, MH is just expensive, and I have a dehydrator where I did all my prep work beforehand. Also, even if you're not using a bear canister, I would repackage all of your MH meals into ziploc bags just to save more room - the original packaging is super bulky.  I also don't get sick of repetitive meals, so I ate tuna for lunch for two weeks in a row.   Breakfast: Oatmeal packets with peanut butter (could use PB2 to save room) mixed in, summer sausage with hard cheese, different variations of trail mix (my favorite is called Strawberry Sensation where you mix Strawberry mini-wheats with yogurt raisins, dark chocolate chips, and dried strawberries); a low carb option could be Spam and freeze-dried eggs with hard cheese   Lunch: Tuna pouches with mayo/relish, Spam (I actually like this stuff!), summer sausage with hard cheese  Dinner: GIVE ME ALL THECARBS   Snacks: Trail mix, Peanut Butter, Nutella, Blue Diamond almonds, KIND bars, Jerky, Clif bars, marshmallows, pudding cups, a thousand things I would never eat on keto   I used The Yummy Life and TrailCooking almost exclusively to get ideas for meals.   My Yummy Life favorites were the Thai peanut noodles with chicken, creamy alfredo chicken, and the apricot macadamia couscous.  Super filling and hit the spot after a hard day of hiking. For the TrailCooking site, I loved the pesto salmon pasta, among others.   I think you could stay keto if you reallllllly wanted to, but I found just upping my intake to stay under a 100 a day was just so much easier...and my will power at the end of the day to eat more tuna and summer sausage just wasn't happening. Make sure you bring some lite-salt/Propel/Gatorade/hydration packets to keep those levels steady. I tracked all of my nutrition during the trip on MyFitnessPal, so I knew roughly how much I was eating.   Above all else, don't sweat the carbs when you're there, and have fun! You'll be active for the majority of your time, and I sincerely doubt that the extra carb intake will do much (if any) damage. Hope this helps!"

xxketo,3ctig8,nauticalspoon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:06:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm only two months in, but the couple of times I broke I had zero adverse effects. I only weigh myself every couple of weeks, too, so I don't notice any increased water weight."
xxketo,3ctig8,DjerteiVanDerCloaca,3,Fri Jul 10 18:23:40 2015 UTC,"I've done it a handful of times for very special dinners at places I've waited months to get a reservation for. But, I still make as many keto choices and modifications as I can and have a plan in-place to get right back to keto immediately after the dinner. It still stalls me and I have to get rid of water weight, but I knew that going in.   The main risks are 2. The first is that you will get sick. Some people get stomach sick from large amounts of carbs after keto and some don't. The second, and biggest issue IMO, is the slippery slope. Lots of people have a very hard time getting back to strict keto discipline after taking a break and eating off program.   That said, I think with some planning, you could be OK. Eat very, very low carb and then allow yourself a couple or three marshmallows. A regular marshmallow has 6g carbs. You can still have them and stay in the lines if you plan well."
xxketo,3ctig8,ghostforest,3,Fri Jul 10 21:28:13 2015 UTC,"Nope. I don't cheat because it's not worth feeling like crap for days afterwards. If I cheat it's on calories, not carbs."

xxketo,3ctig8,delillie,3,Fri Jul 10 19:25:38 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough, I did something similar. I went camping with my husband last week and figured that after 5 months I would let myself enjoy the occasional marshmallow because c'mon, MARSHMALLOWS! I also drank a bit more than I probably should have and didn't track my calories so I'm sure I went over carbs on nuts. This was for 3 nights and 2 days. I didn't feel terrible. My body was okay with it and overall, because of how active I was, I didn't put on any extra pounds.  BUT. I had a hard time getting back to keto 100% afterwards. I find that personally, when I take a little break it's harder to get going again afterwards. So my vacation was from Tuesday to Friday, but I still wasn't really back into it on Saturday and let myself eat a salad with breaded chicken that I normally wouldn't have done. Then I had some popcorn that night. By Sunday I was fine again and I'm even lower than I was when I went camping now but honestly, it wasn't really worth it. That's just my personal opinion and my experience!  Ultimately, it's up to you! So good luck and have fun camping!"
xxketo,3ctig8,jessfm,4,Fri Jul 10 17:57:13 2015 UTC,"I do, for special occasions. I took a break when I went overseas so I wouldn't miss out on any of the foods that I can't get locally. I went straight back to keto the moment I got home, though! If you're camping, maybe you can try to do a lot of hiking to offset some of the carby calories? That way you feel less bad about it :)"

xxketo,3ctig8,ElegantArtifice,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:26:07 2015 UTC,"I do, on increasingly rare occasions, usually on weekends with the family. The problem with cheating is that it makes one feel very bad, lack of energy and mental sharpness are marked and I, for one, ALWAYS get terrible leg cramps and muscle/joint aches if I eat too many grams of carbs. It just isn't worth it for the most part keto food tastes better to me now anyway. After 13 years of this the smell of all the sugar in cakes and such is actually unpleasant to me these days. It just isn't worth it, I can always have some more green salad or an extra hunk of steak while the high carbers eat their potatoes or mac-n-cheese and I bring Media Crema, cocoa powder, cottage cheese, flavorings and liquid stevia to make my own yummy dessert."

xxketo,3ctig8,hopelesslyinsane,0,Tue Jul 14 16:50:51 2015 UTC,"I did CKD last year and lost 30lbs in 6 weeks BUT I was doing intense cardio and muscle workouts.  This year I've been better with staying on Keto but if I do have a day where I go off I usually fast (<500 cals) the next day. It will take off most of the water/carb weight. I had a BAD week last week. Tuesday-Saturday was just crap food. I fasted Sunday and have been back on keto all week. I'm back to where I was plus down 2 pounds.  So you can have bad days just make sure you cut them off eventually. Because of last week I'm technically behind because I didn't lose anything last week. Like a lot of people on here point out, Keto is a lifestyle change. Life is no fun if you're forced to restrict yourself all the time. It's ok to slip up, it's ok to take breaks for special occasions. Just as long as you know it's a break and get back on! Also, you WILL see weight gain on the scale. Sometimes 1 bad day can show 5 or 6 pounds, but it's all water weight. It takes a couple days to get rid of and you can't let that get you down. You have to remember, all cheats have consequences and you have to accept it and KCKO."

I have found that I can't eat as much chicken as I previously would have, unless it is dark meat and skin on. I've also found that I have to eat extra fat at every meal, i.e. Coconut oil in coffee (plus HWC), bacon with lunch, butter on veggies at dinner. Greek yogurt is very high in protein too. It's hard to train yourself out of looking for traditionally ""healthy"" food choices, but my mantra has been ""when in doubt, eat fat!""  As for specific meal suggestions, I also eat the same breakfast and lunch every day:  Breakfast: keto muffin (eggs, bacon, cheese, hwc, and broccoli) and coffee with coconut oil and hwc  Lunch: tofu, bacon and bok choy (I know, weird!)  Dinner: Italian sausage and veggies (add butter!) chicken thighs and veggies, keto pizza and veggies  Snacks vary: almonds, straight pb, fat bombs, cheese, chocolate mousse, avocado  HTH!!"
xxketo,3ct4kw,Mak3_yourself_17,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:18:00 2015 UTC,hmm I used the calculator and those are the numbers it gave me.

xxketo,3cs845,gwyllin,9,Fri Jul 10 10:20:58 2015 UTC,"You're not stalled, weight loss is not linear, you will not lose weight every week on the scale especially in the first 4-6 weeks when water weight fluctuations can mask fat loss. Count your calories accurately, take measurements and be patient   How many calories?   You're losing weight. You need to realize water weight can mask fat loss, you have to follow the trend but it hasn't been long enough to establish a trend   This is a marathon not a sprint, trust the process"
xxketo,3cs845,anbeav,7,Fri Jul 10 10:53:12 2015 UTC,"This comment may provide some solace. https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/y549t/starting_keto_again_last_time_i_suddenly_stopped/c5slh2x   Say you're at a caloric deficit of 500 kcal, the first three weeks you'll lose 21 * 500 = 10,500 kcal, which is 10,500 / 3,500 = 3 pound of actual fat. On top of this you'll lose the 5-10 lbs of water, so you might see it as this:  Week 1: 5 lbs (-4 water, -1 fat)  Week 2: 3 lbs (-2 water, -1 fat)  Week 3: 2 lbs (-1 water, -1 fat)  Week 4: 1 lbs ( 0 water, -1 fat)  Week 5: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)  Week 6: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)  Week 7: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)  Week 8: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)  Week 9: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)  Week 10: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)  Week 11: 1 lbs ( 0 water, -1 fat)"

xxketo,3cs845,tetrine,4,Sat Jul 11 16:00:36 2015 UTC,"I think you should take measurements because you may be making progress that doesn't show on the scale.  30 per cent deficit seems good but what is your tdee? And how did you calculate it, did you say that you are sedentary or active? I eat at a 35 percent deficit and say I am sedentary even though I exercise 6 days a week. A lot of people here won't agree with that but for me it is the only thing that works. Also are you drinking alcohol at all?"

xxketo,3cs845,adverbsyo,3,Fri Jul 10 12:55:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think two weeks counts as a stall. Try increasing your water intake to 2-3 liters a day.

Increasing your water intake will encourage your body to drop it."

And I realised that if I forgot my pill my weight loss stalled immediately. Since you are not on medication, you can maybe try to reduce your insulin resistance (if you have any) by eating for exemple cinnamon and doing some resistance training. Ultimately more muscles mean more calories burned and more muscles improve the insulin resistance in your body.   Also like anbeav said, it's a sprint not a marathon."

Like /u/anbeav and /u/tetrine said, you can be gaining back some water weight that you lost at the beginning, and the scale doesn't know the difference between water and fat.    Edit: A lot of people see no movement for a couple of weeks, and experience a ""woosh"" moment.  Also, if you've been walking your dog for an hour for a very long time, your body may be used to it. Maybe try incorporating some other form of exercise, if you have the time?"

xxketo,3ctxbd,Girloutofkitchen,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:32:35 2015 UTC,"The county loves to take away babies, when someone makes a complaint that someone's not acting in the interest of the child. And all medical providers are required to make complaints. It happens constantly here, even for stuff like missed dental appointments. Babies are a huge target because legally the county can take them after delivery, and not have to allow reunification because the baby does not have an established relationship with parents or siblings. Parents are placed under gag orders with threats of jail if they talk about it, and the county gets a small bonus of federal dollars for each adoption. Occasionally, you get a national news story because someone talks before they're gagged, or because someone talks and then goes to jail.   Once the baby is home and has established relationships with the siblings, the family is protected by law, but not before.  As far as her health and the babies, GD is not a risk factor as she doesn't eat carbs, and she's never had it.  It is also impossible to figure out in advance, if your doctor is ""one-of-those"". We found out a friend-of-the-family was ""one-of-those"" when he made national news for taking the baby of a Russian couple looking for a second opinion. Friend no longer."

xxketo,3ctxbd,OnionOnYourBelt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:51:01 2015 UTC,No. But she really hates these tests. Even before she was low-carb they made her feel as sick as a dog. It is her least favorite part of being pregnant. I'm on here looking for a good way to get out of it.
xxketo,3ctxbd,septicidal,3,Sat Jul 11 00:02:00 2015 UTC,"I've done the test twice before. Yes, they're horrible but if the potential consequences are as bad as you say then I think she'd be silly to decline. It's one small bottle of syrupy soda. Suck it up and deal with sitting in the waiting room for 3 hrs."
xxketo,3ctxbd,Just4Kix1230,0,Sat Jul 11 14:38:59 2015 UTC,"It is truly scary stuff how little protection families have. Parents have almost no rights or protections, as the law in our state allows the judge to make any ruling ""in the interest of the child"", regardless of whether parents did anything wrong. Children under age 3 do not need to be returned to parents, since the state views separation at this age as causing no trauma to the child. After age three, taking the children is legally considered traumatic to the child.   Only sibling groups protect younger children, since taking away siblings traumatizes the other children.   If you're wondering how I know, its because I worked for Child Welfare."
xxketo,3ctxbd,Just4Kix1230,3,Fri Jul 10 23:54:48 2015 UTC,"Hey! I'll chime in, I do these tests all the time. When patients come in to do a Glucose Challenge, the drink will be 50gms of glucose.   You do not have to have the test, nobody can make you do that, if you are concerned ask your doctor if you can have Fasting Glucose and random glucose checks instead."
xxketo,3ctxbd,Lindarama,3,Sat Jul 11 00:12:46 2015 UTC,"I couldn't complete the test because it made me very sick to my stomach and I couldn't keep the glucose down. As an alternative, my OB had me check my blood sugar with a home monitor 4x a day for two weeks. Your insurance might fight covering it since the glucose test wasn't attempted, and the test strips are expensive even with insurance.  That being said, you have the right to refuse any medical test. Having a history of pregnancy without blood sugar issues, combined with a lack of indication for the test, may help the OB better understand the refusal. It is standard of care to have all pregnant women do the one hour test, though."
xxketo,3ctxbd,anbeav,2,Sat Jul 11 00:27:28 2015 UTC,"It's ""standard practice.""  They had me do mine twice since I tended to gain excess weight with my preganancies.    If there's no other indication (read:cause or appearance of cause) to take the test, see if you can defer until the doctor sees some evidice to need it.   Modern ob'cs are overtested IMO.  It's the field of medicine with the highest malpractice suit rate, so most docs are going to go with CYA... so be prepared for some discussion.  Maybe there's an alternative test? (Guessing, here.)"
xxketo,3ctxbd,ghostforest,-3,Fri Jul 10 20:05:04 2015 UTC,"I think she will probably just pretend to drink it. My understanding is that that it is testing for extra glucose that your body hasn't processed. So if extra glucose doesn't show up, it passes as normal."
xxketo,3ctxbd,jareths_tight_pants,7,Fri Jul 10 23:20:40 2015 UTC,The nurse watches you down the pseudo-soda. That probably isn't a solid plan.
xxketo,3ctxbd,anbeav,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:22:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, the nurse (both times) sat me in the waiting room and came to check I was drinking it. I had to give her the empty bottle at the end."
xxketo,3ctxbd,jareths_tight_pants,3,Sat Jul 11 14:41:04 2015 UTC,"Have you discussed it with your OB? If you're already on a low carb diet which would be the treatment for GD perhaps you can opt out.  It's worth mentioning that if you do the screening, you need to eat high carb (read: over 100 g) for at least 3 days before testing for accurate results."
xxketo,3ctxbd,n0m-de-plum,2,Fri Jul 10 19:42:55 2015 UTC,"I came here to say this as well. If you tell your OB that you're very carefully tracking your very low carb diet, they may be fine with opting you out. You can even offer to show them your tracking records."

Keto is the real deal, though, so stick with it! I made great headway with emotional eating on keto because I could finally differentiate physical hunger from wanting to eat. If I wasn't physically hungry, I did a non-food replacement activity that was fun. Lots of pampering treatments and I got back into some crafty hobbies that I had stopped doing. It worked really well for me.   Don't worry about stuff like loose skin. You'll find that once you have some major loss under your belt, you will be so super happy that skin won't really matter much. Plus, you sound like you may be in your 20's? Younger skin snaps back more easily, it just takes time (skin can continue to shrink for 1-2 years post-loss)."

If you don't have them, you can't eat them. If you can't get rid of them, hide them from yourself. Put them where you don't usually look.

I have been reading ketogains and the idea of eating above maintenance, even eating at maintenance tbh, makes me hesitant.   I know I have to, as all of the strength training I currently do isn't progressing anymore because of my calorie deficit. But after working so hard to lose weight, it's difficult to change my mindset  even though it is the most intelligent and healthy choice.

It's burger day in Red5446 town.  :D  I'm going to do a final practice run through of my ride when I get off of work tonight, and then go home and do nothing, possibly until late in the evening, because I can!  Tomorrow, we are going out to O-town to spend time with Mom2 (my name for my MIL.)  There are some gardens that I'm really excited to check out, and we're planning lunch and possibly a movie afterwards.  My husband gets his reticence from his mother, so if we don't have a concrete plan, we will just sit in silence somewhere.  I figure if we're going to do that, we might as well watch a movie too!  I'm also really excited for the plant porn- eventually we will move into our own place, and Imma go buck wild on that yard!  I want rainbows of plants!  It's never to early to start planning, especially in FL with its endless summer.  I think I've roped my Dad into taking my class on Sunday, which will be his first indoor cycling experience.  I'm really excited, because I think he will like it- he mountain bikes, so he can handle the leg work, but he has gym anxiety- it's kind of been my Mom's turf for decades, and he gets a little claustrophobic in some situations.  I think that he will enjoy being in the back corner, with the lights down, once he realizes that no one is looking at what he's doing.  I'm hoping that I can make a spinner out of him, because we need some activities to do together now that it's almost too hot (and sharky!) for fishing.  If I get the time, I want to experiment with a keto cheddar biscuits and gravy dish.  I'm so so excited for the weekend!  Plus I just found out that my coworker needs some help with sample prep, so now my morning is going to fly by and the afternoon is lab clean up, so my week is basically over already!  :D"

And somewhere in all of that I need to also clean the house and go grocery shopping.  In keto-land I'm still on my first round of 100 days of keto, no cheat (or desire to cheat) in sight! I'm down a little over 22 pounds in 40 days! Weight loss has slowed at this point, and it looks almost like a wave. It'll go down in a matter of days, stop for one day, climb upwards (2-4 pounds,) stop for a day, and drop 4-6 in a 2-3 day span. I know a lot of people say not to weigh in every day, but it really helps to see the pattern my body goes through so I don't freak out week to week. I can SEE my habits are working :D My last whoosh, coupled with an 8 day period, took me from 222, up to 226, and now down to 218.6 :D Lowest weight I've been since 2011 (last pregnancy.)  I can't wait to see my doctor again next month for bloodwork and see if she has anything to say about my weightloss. I've gone from a BMI of 39.9 to under 36.6. It's not huge, and I'm not there, but t have changed that much in what feels like such a short period of time is REALLY exciting :D  Thank you all for being here as we go through this together."

I've tried for 15 years to control my weight (as a teen through unhealthy methods, and as an adult by traditional ""eat less, move more"") and if I ever saw results, it was only tiny (maybe 5 pounds lost) and it took forever. As soon as I got fed up the weight would come right back. I know I probably won't lose another 22 pounds in the next 6 weeks, but frankly if I can just get into the hundreds by Christmas I'll be ecstatic. It's my Christmas present to myself :D"

Slowly but surely getting my eating back under control despite the cravings that inevitably follow 2 weeks off plan. I'm also hungrier for some reason and end up eating more calories than I plan.

Still maintaining my 90-day challenge goal and now looking forward on heading to my 170's. I was excited to get over the 190's hump and into the 180's.

I had to grab my husband's sweatpants and pull them up to my bellybutton and tighten/tie the drawstring.

On the plus side, I am less than a lb from the 150s which has only happened in my adult life one other time when I had a monster throat infection and couldn't eat or drink for a week! Plus, I was awake for 2 hours last night (money anxiety, yay!) and I READ A BOOK! I read four chapters and didn't get a headache or get nauseous! As a librarian on summer break, this is gigantic!  I also signed up for the full KC Marathon yesterday. It may be a bit optimistic since I am still only walking, swimming, and minimally body weight strengthening, but I need a goal in my life to look forward to!

It is really helping me stay on track.  I started a low carb diet to lose weight a the June 5th but and lost 7 lbs by the 23rd, but I needed more structure and ideas and when looking for recipes stumbled on I breath, I'm hungry's website and menu plan.  I have been following that since with some modifications as I don't want to eat quite that many calories and sometimes need to finish up some of the leftovers for another day.  I am keeping my carbs <20 most days, never over 25 net carbs and trying to keep my calories around 1200.  I have lost another 6.5lbs since and it much easier to plan, and the food is good as well.    Not doing any official exercise yet, yard work and a bit of walking is all, I am thinking of starting a bit more walking next week and maybe some body weight exercises. Working all weekend so it will be a write off for me."

Last night I did some yardwork including moving some perennials from where the new garage will go to around my pond and took a load of tree trunk pieces to the drop off. I love being strong enough to pick up and lug around those super heavy chunks. Today will be a desk day at work and I need to catch up after spending most of yesterday helping with the department picnic. Tonight I'm supposed to hang out with the bf. There's a local festival going on that I want to go to, so maybe we'll do that. Tomorrow morning I want to do at least one load of yard waste to the drop off which should take a couple hours to round up. I also want to bump up my mile run I've been doing daily and try 2 miles. There's also Art Fair on the Square this weekend that I want to visit. It should still be a relaxing weekend with a nice mix of activities thrown in.   Oh, and two new PRs at the gym this morning. Squat 3 x 145. It felt good although my hips are pretty tight and I need to work on that so I can make sure I'm hitting depth. Bench 2 x 125. The first one felt really good and the second was a struggle, so I didn't even attempt a third."

I'm still waiting to scale myself on Sunday. I don't want to make it about the number. I've also decided to look at success in '5's'. I realized that looking at the big number (~30lbs) was making me feel daunted since there hasn't been scale progress. So instead, I'm just going to look at it in getting to the nearest five.

xxketo,3cs41u,Eversist,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:35:52 2015 UTC,"I just heard this at a talk a couple of days ago, completely unrelated to weight loss, but it's so true. Your idea of success morphs and moves as you make progress.  When I reach 170, I will have lost at least 13 lbs in 6ish weeks (I didn't take accurate starting measurements). That doesn't feel like much to me (even though I've been 180-190lbs for a couple of years now). My brain keeps saying ""Oh, but once you've lost TWENTY POUNDS, that will be nuts, won't it?!"" And I imagine once I reach that weight, my brain will say ""That's not much, what if you lost X POUNDS?""  Something I've been struggling with."
xxketo,3cs41u,Red5446,2,Fri Jul 10 19:33:14 2015 UTC,"It seems very related to weight loss!  Using that same idea, from a different perspective, though, you may eventually find that factors other than weight are more important indicators of your success.  For example, many people experience more level moods and energy stores, mental clarity, less cravings, and better vital signs due to keto.  That said, you're practically at 170 now, and that's great progress!  :)"

Yasmin made my life like hell and I haven't lost the water weight since. That was when I decided to go by how I feel and not weighing myself anymore.  Anyway, this time last year I weighed around 120 and that was when hormonal imbalance and cystic ovaries made me gain those damn last lbs back - I can just tell you what I was doing before that. I wasn't on keto, just typical low carb with fruits, and didn't even count calories, but I was doing IF, skipping breakfast, and not eating after 8 pm. I also exercised at least 3 times a week, lifting weight or doing bodyweight exercises with occasianal HIIT whenever I felt like it. Before I added the exercise, everyone seemed to think I looked sick and fragile and I was feeling gross and skinny-fat. That being said, don't underestimate the power of weight training. You will look better, feel better and maintain you weight way easier with some nice muscles on your body.  Also, do not lower you calories! I did that and it backfired - I started binging and purging and developed some bad habits that I didn't have before and am still struggling with. Don't push your body too hard. Let it feel safe and happy with your healthy weight!  Good luck to both of us!"

Worth it to not be bleeding 24/7 though. it's a low dose combined pill.   I definitely want to stay keto - fruit is almost definitely a problem food for me. pre-keto i was easily eating an entire punnet of grapes, and whole canteloupe melon, two apples, two satsumas and a banana a day. I don't think I can allow fruit and stay low carb.  As I said in a previous comment, I really struggle with exercise because it makes me angry. I don't know what to do about it but as soon as I feel like I'm physically exerting myself I get really hot and frustrated and just want to murder everyone around me and it lasts for hours. Any advice on how to stop that would be great - at the moment I do yoga and really, really easy pilates that probably do fuck all except flexibility as I never feel like i'm 'trying' thus never get angry."

It was my last pre-keto day.  Haha, that's a cool problem! Well, you get angry because you are out of breath? You do realize you are supposed to FEEL the work, right? It may sound silly but I was thinking maybe you could benefit from that anger, like doing martial arts or something? A friend of mine is the type that hates exercising for the sake of exercising - like running and lifting sounds pointless to her.

General consensus seems to be too eat more. I'm not really hungry, but i do like to eat so no harm in that,just confused because I thought I needed to stay at a deficit to lose weight"
xxketo,3cqs5d,Oranges13,10,Fri Jul 10 01:36:26 2015 UTC,There's NO WAY with that much activity that 1300 is maintenance.
xxketo,3cqs5d,ghostforest,5,Fri Jul 10 03:50:58 2015 UTC,"Most people here use the keto calculator. I'm not sure what methodology your doctor used. I guessed you were 25 (bingo!) for my calculation. I set it to sedentary as that's what's suggested for anyone trying to lose weight, even if you exercise regularly.   Also, take measurements. I've found that the scale can be a poor indicator of what's happening and it can lag behind other indicators that you're shrinking."

xxketo,3cqs5d,mons177,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:07:50 2015 UTC,Try upping it by 100 kcals for a week and see if that changes anything.
xxketo,3cqs5d,dunstonchecksout,3,Fri Jul 10 07:20:49 2015 UTC,"Wow!! Very detailed post. Reading through, a fee things came up as red flags. Firstly, I question the low intake of calories. Lower than 1200 calories will make your body retain any water weight desperately. Compounded with your high level of exercise! I'm not sure why your doctor told you that 1200 is maintenance!!! Unless you have the world's lowest metabolism, this is an extremely low maintenance. How did he or she determine this exactly? Was there some kind of test? Did they measure your lean body mass vs total body fat? I would use the side bar at xxketo to determine your TDEE and base and use those numbers, not just what your doctor say. Or seek a second opinion.   Another thing is the supplements you're taking. Did you check for carb count? A lot of vitamins have added sugar. Check online to see what the carb counts are. That's all I remember for now so hope that helped in some way. I would def recommend upping your calorie intake!!!"
xxketo,3cqs5d,diaju,2,Fri Jul 10 01:27:41 2015 UTC,"No sugar in the supplements, and yes PCOS is known for low metabolism. The Dr.  Used body fat, muscle, and did a four hour blood glucose fasting test (the same one pregnant women and diabetics take)   I'm coming up 1300 maintenance calories using approximate estimates, so 1000 calories should really be a about a 20% deficit."
xxketo,3cqs5d,dunstonchecksout,0,Fri Jul 10 01:33:01 2015 UTC,20% would be 1200.
xxketo,3cqs5d,jareths_tight_pants,3,Fri Jul 10 01:52:20 2015 UTC,1300 x 0.8 (80%) = 1040
xxketo,3cqs5d,Girloutofkitchen,2,Fri Jul 10 02:56:43 2015 UTC,Dur! I read 1500.
xxketo,3cqs5d,Girloutofkitchen,3,Fri Jul 10 03:37:51 2015 UTC,"1 pound a week is a perfectly healthy weight loss. Us ladies don't get as much of a whoosh as the guys. But I think you're under eating and need to up your calories a bit. 1,000 calories for 181 lbs is too few.  Also, be careful with the saw palmetto as it thins the blood. If you start to notice a lot of bruises then taper off of it or reduce the amount you take."
xxketo,3cqs5d,ThatChickFromReddit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:19:26 2015 UTC,"Cool, I didn't know to watch for bruises with saw palmetto, thanks for letting me know.  It is definitely helping with the hirsutism though. That is a good point about ladies losing slower, I think I will up the calorie intake and more closely monitor my macros"
xxketo,3cqs5d,AntiPhat,2,Fri Jul 10 13:16:04 2015 UTC,"First of all, your diet looks great, albeit very low cal (but that works for me so each to their own).  1 pound a week weight loss is not bad at all! try to be happy about it!  I would start taking measurements every 3-5 days because you might see that is where the changes are happening especially because you are working out a lot.  I would measure upper arm, lower arm, bust, waist, hip, upper thigh, above the knee and calf (widest part).   You will probably find the wieght is coming off slowly because you are gaining muscle and losing fat.  my fitness pal is good for tracking measurements and I use it a lot.  I understand your frustration, I am on a similar diet and exercise regime to you and it is punishing and you want to see huge numbers coming off on the scales.  Stay positive!"
xxketo,3cqs5d,AntiPhat,2,Fri Jul 10 14:28:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll try the measurements, you may be right about that.  I appreciate it :)"

xxketo,3cqs5d,AntiPhat,-1,Fri Jul 10 15:41:16 2015 UTC,"have you talked to your doctor about some kind of birth control pill that might help regulate your period? i think that bulletproof coffee has way too much fat, i would stay away from it. i think 1200 calories is a good amount to aim for. This is going to sound weird, but i stopped exercising this week and lost a ton of weight- try taking a week off from exercising and see what happens."
xxketo,3cqs5d,ThatChickFromReddit,5,Fri Jul 10 08:28:17 2015 UTC,"If the bulletproof coffee fits her macros and she's weighing/measuring everything properly then there is no issue with her having it.       Also, the weight you lost after you stopped exercising is water weight. When you exercise, your body holds onto water, mainly for your muscles. As soon as you stop, your body whooshes all that water out."
xxketo,3cqs5d,DidIEver,2,Fri Jul 10 10:59:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying all of it was water weight but most of it (if not all) most likely was. And yes it's very much possible to retain 5+ lbs of water weight through exercise depending on how intense it is. That's why people find that when they stop exercising, all that water comes out. So yes the OP may lose 'weight' from stopping exercise, but it's not a good indicator of fat loss.         Also just to add: when someone is on a calorie deficit then they're going to lose fat. Most stalls (when people are doing everything right) come about from people having their fat cells fill with water. Through patience and perseverance, the fat cells eventually give up the water and they shrink. This is how you get 'whooshes'.

xxketo,3coona,n0m-de-plum,5,Thu Jul 9 15:24:32 2015 UTC,"Yasmin should help. It contains anti-androgen progesterones, which hopefully should minimize any lingering insulin resistance and other issues that are caused by PCOS.  Any weight issues from birth control are sketchy at best and completely disproved at worst. Regulating your hormones should help you lose weight."
xxketo,3coona,Solieus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:47:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Yasmin definitely did help with the facial hair (blah!) when I was on it before. I didn't really gain much weight on Yasmin before. A little bit (5 lbs, which on my frame was barely noticeable), but it is definitely possible that it was actually from half-assing the healthy eating aspect while in college."
xxketo,3coona,the_ether_layer,2,Thu Jul 9 16:13:50 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you've already made a decision, but I would encourage you to think about getting the Mirena IUD.  It's the most effective form of birth control, and while the insertion and first couple of months are slightly unpleasant, once you're over that hump it's a breeze.  I've had one for a little under a year and I pretty much don't have a period anymore.  I have some spotting occasionally but that's it.  Plus, since the hormones are only acting locally, there aren't nearly as many side effects (or any, really).  You also don't have to worry about remembering to take a pill at the same time every day.  Just my two cents."
xxketo,3coona,Oranges13,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:29:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying ""no I absolutely won't do that!"" but I do have some thoughts...  First, having no period is not something I want any more than I want prolonged bleeding. It's something that has happened to me in the past (another symptom of PCOS), which is why unlike most women, it is not something that inducing chemically sounds desirable to me. I know that in theory it is perfectly safe, but I'm not sure I'd be able to feel comfortable with it. There would always be the worry in the back of my mind ""Do I know for CERTAIN this is the Mirena and not my PCOS symptoms getting worse?""  The hormones acting locally, and causing less side effects, might actually be a good thing in terms of my concern about weightloss stalls. Did you notice any added difficulty losing weight with Mirena? And do you have PCOS?  One concern I do have is that it does still contain hormones, so there is still a possibility side effects and since it's an IUD, if there are side effects that I find intolerable, reversing it is not as simple as just no longer taking the pills."
xxketo,3coona,Oranges13,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:49:32 2015 UTC,"Reversing it is as simple as removing it. You can get pregnant immediately after removal.  To chime in with another anecdote: I'm on my second Mirena. It has not affected my weight loss at all (in fact I hit my lowest with it).  I still have a regular cycle too.  Everyone is different, and considering the horror stories from the copper IUD I enjoy the added protection of the low level of hormones."
xxketo,3coona,the_ether_layer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:43:30 2015 UTC,"Haha, yes, I know it's not permanent and you just need to remove it.  I guess I should clarify that I'm a bit of a control freak, so even having to wait for my doctor's office to do it rather than being able to do something myself (like not take a pill) falls into the category of ""not that simple"" for me.

There's no way to know anything for certain, so while I understand where you're coming from, at some point you are going to have to relinquish control.

I really wanted to get back to my routine yesterday so I got up and went running but it was not the best idea. I was feeling weak afterwards, so much so that I could barely lift my arms to dry my hair. Then I went to IKEA with a friend and just browsing the marketplace was enough for one day. We were supposed to have lunch together and spend the afternoon chatting but I opted for my couch and Vikings (I'm almost done watching the entire series. Moving on to Penny Dreadful next.) Today I'm taking my mom into the city to get her hair done so I hope I'll feel better. I'm hoping to walk around some and maybe sit on a terrasse and just look around...  I've been thinking about my next fitness goals. I'm a little bit discouraged by the little progress I've made in the last 8 months. As close as I got to my goal weight in May (I managed to get to 139 before my trip to Italy, CW is from this morning) I have a feeling that it is either not realistic or that my body is just ""comfortable"" in the 140's. I'm losing hope, TBH, that I will ever achieve my goal. So I've been thinking that maybe the problem is not what I'm doing but my goal itself. I love running and I still want to achieve regular longer distances (I'm working on being able to regularly run 10k for now but I was hoping to make it to longer distances.) Seems however that running is not enough to get me to my goals. I'm thinking maybe I should start lifting - I've actually been thinking about it for a while... Truth is I find it terribly intimidating and don't know where or how to start. I've also read that running/cardio and lifting don't mix well, which worries me since I don't want to quit running. In the meantime I downloaded ""Strong Curves"" but it doesn't seem super useful or engaging in ebook format. I've also started lurking in xxfitness and ketogains but I don't dare post or ask newbie questions. I guess I just need to keep reading and get over this.  Have a nice day ladies!"
xxketo,3cnq5u,Red5446,3,Thu Jul 9 12:08:08 2015 UTC,"I think running and lifting mix very well - but not if you're focused solely on the number on the scale. I've found that my lifting and yoga really helped with my form when running - I tend to get shin splints if I have a weak core so strength training really makes a big difference when I run. But you'll build muscle, so the number on the scale might not go in the ""right"" direction.   I downloaded strong curves too, and like you said the ebook format sucks. But the exercises near the end are pretty straightforward once you've done them a couple times, so I found it easier to just make a list on a piece of paper or on my phone and do them that way."
xxketo,3cnq5u,my_Favorite_post,2,Thu Jul 9 12:43:56 2015 UTC,"You're so close to your goal!  In my experience, running and lifting work together quite well.  Getting stronger overall can't possibly hurt your running, and gaining muscle will mean that you burn more calories in day.  I strongly (no pun intended) recommend Stronglifts 5X5.  I know that the Olympic bar can be intimidating, but it's a great program.  It's simple; there are only 5 moves to learn, and you start small and build your way up.  It's mentally challenging too, and personally I think that the toughness you build up in that area can really help put your weight goals in perspective.  It's hard when you are close to goal, like we are, and shifting to a focus on getting strong and achieving running goals really helps to manage the frustration of slow losing.  Sorry, I'm rambling now, but one more thing-  I've been contemplating signing up for a half marathon in November... would you want to find one in your area and become training buddies??"
xxketo,3cnq5u,Just4Kix1230,0,Thu Jul 9 16:06:54 2015 UTC,"You're right of course. I'll look into the programme you mentioned for lifting.  About the half marathon. I want to do it eventually, but maybe not this autumn. A friend asked me last month if I wanted to enter one with him and the next day a young firefighter died while running a local race so we decided not to do it right away right away and take it slow. I want to make my 10k game strong before going longer distances - the half marathon will come later...  For now I need to get my head around the idea of lifting heavy things ;)"
xxketo,3cnq5u,ghenne04,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:41:55 2015 UTC,"Lifting heavy is the bees' knees! No worries about the half, it totally makes sense to want to work your way up.

My stints of running are based on how long my stumpy puppy can run for, so I'm proud of her for going as long as she did! I'm a bit sore this morning.  I mentioned the other day how I tried on my small tight jeans and they were big on me. I may have understated it. They're HUGE on me. Baggy and trying to fall off. While it feels great for these pants to be sagging, it's also super frustrating as I am going out of town next week and need to save my money for that. I don't have money for new clothing and the thrift stores near me never seem to consistently carry above a size 8. So I suspect I'll be walking around in baggy clown pants until August. Ugh.

I've not been feeling like I'm on the ball at work lately though, so this was a pleasant surprise.  Made a zucchini and Italian sausage casserole last night and I can't wait to eat it for lunch. Both are from my veggie and meat CSAs, so they are locally grown/processed. I've never eaten so well in my life since finding these CSAs and starting keto. Only thing I don't buy ""local"" nowadays are the heavy cream, cheese, and eggs in my diet (though I could buy them from the local Amish at the farmer's market, I eat way too much for it to be close to economical). It's a bit more expensive, but I don't have to worry about the quality of life of all this meat I've been eating on keto, or recalls of veggies from major food processors. Worth it!  Have my personal training session after work today, and a kickball game tonight. Hopefully it doesn't rain again - slippery grass fields are the worst!"

Shredded zucchini (we used maybe 3 medium sized ones) 3-4 eggs About 1 cup of ""Italian breadcrumbs"" (essentially I mixed almond flour with Italian seasoning) Browned Italian sausage cut into small chunks (or ground beef, or whatever, it's optional) Shredded cheese (I used about 2 cups of shredded mozzarella) Garlic, onions, other seasonings as desired   I browned the sausage, put it on the bottom of the pan, and then spread the zucchini mixture (i.e. with the eggs and breadcrumbs) on top. Topped with the cheese, and baked it in the oven for about 45 minutes at 350.  Good luck with the zucchini - it's one of my favorite summer veggies and I'm so happy we're getting 3-4 per week in our CSA."

I've broken a lot of bad eating habits these last 6 weeks, but boredom eating is one I'm still working on!!  Husband turned me on to an awesome weight tracking app - Libra - that has taken my daily weighing to a much better place, because it plots your weights on a trend line as you track. So now, even if I bounce back up from the day before, I can see just where I am compared to where I would be if I stayed exactly on trend - and most days, even when I go up, I'm still on or below the line!

We also started taking probiotics together and she's had to reduce her insulin by 5 units in the morning. Even after oatmeal and berries and a little bit of yogurt, she was feeling woozy from too much insulin so she had to reduce it. Correlation with probiotic intake? I don't know but possibly.  Edit: yes I know she is eating ""carby"" oatmeal etc however at least she's made the effort to cut back on a lot of bread etc. She's responsible for making the decision on what she eats.

Today at work we have our department wide cookout which my supervisor was organizing. That means I got to help her unload her car then we headed off to pick up some more food at the grocery store. Then we were the ones to do all the grilling, so I spent about 1.5 hrs at the grill and helping set up all the food. I was able to eat some of the hamburger, the deviled eggs I made, and some salad greens, so not too bad for a work potluck. Then my supervisor had to leave for an inspection, so I also got to help with all the cleanup. It's nearly 2 and I'm just now sitting down at my desk for the day.   No big plans for tonight, but I think I might do some yardwork because the drop off is open later tonight, so I should weed enough to fill up the car for one load. Maybe even load up some heavy tree trunk pieces."

I need to eat all of the things... although I'm veggie keto so it's really all of the cheese! I think it's a combo of upping my exercise and being one pill from the end of the pack, so I hope it'll calm down soon. I've stayed within my carbs but gone way over in calories, it'll slow things down but I feel so much better for eating more.   Other than that, went swimming again after work - feeling pretty happy with myself for starting to build a routine with it :)"
xxketo,3cnq5u,fivecentpsychiatrist,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:12:07 2015 UTC,so.. this week has been pooh like.  I think i'm getting sick.  I went to the doctor yesterday because of an ear ache.  I have antibiotic drops but it seems like they are making it worse.. I probably need to just let them take effect.  I was cleared to swim but i can't see how that would help my ear so I think I'll go for a bike ride instead tonight. I ran tonight but I feel like i should do two things today since i had a rest day yesterday.  I'm wondering if the infection is what is causing me so much fatigue.  Who knows.    I'm surprised.  I'm two or three days out from getting my period and I haven't had crazy cravings or even an bottomless pit of a stomach.  I just need to stay on track this weekend with not over doing it with booze.    9 days till my first triathlon!

I'll do lifting 4 days a week with the setup I have at home, and a 15-30 minute HIIT two days in between. Once in a while I'll do an hour HIIT burnout. I do an hour of pilates about every other day. I also walk to work twice a week 2mi.  The deficit I eat at depends on my calories burned. Luckily MFP makes that easy, and fitnessblender shows you a range of calories burned based on height and weight. I set MFP to sedentary as a baseline for daily calories (2000). Then when I exercise, I will eat more when the daily limit increases (usually up to 2600). Either way, I keep my deficits somewhere between 500-900 calories. I do increase carbs slightly."

I also have a road bike so I bike on a trainer or outside, depending on the weather.  I also keep a set of free weights at home so I can bust some accessory lifts while watching TV.  Sometimes I run, and more recently I'm training for a late season triathlon, so I add some lap swim at the pool in.    Basically, I have exercise ADD and I can't do the same thing every day or I burn out quickly.  As far as Keto is concerned, I found my usual 6-7 day a week 60+ min workouts were making me RAVENOUS, so I cut back to 3-4 days and I find my hunger is much more controllable and I'm able to maintain a bigger calorie deficit."

It's impossible for me to stick with a schedule so just alternating like this has worked well for me. If I have two days in between, so be it, as long as I get back out there asap. I find myself to be super hungry the day after lifting heavy, not so much after hiking. I was surprised by this, as I'm burning 3 to 4 times as many calories on hiking days.

xxketo,3cnexv,Sister_State_Trooper,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:56:07 2015 UTC,"Lifting heavy weights once every 7-14 days (as in book, Body by Science). It's great if you like training very hard for a very short period of time and lounging on the couch for the rest of the week. No extra carbs. The best way to 'tone up' that muscle is lifting heavy things. Not to be a drag, but as we get older, our muscle mass declines and lifting heavy things counteracts that. And you feel bad ass."
xxketo,3cnexv,ghenne04,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:06:42 2015 UTC,"I go to yoga, personal training, or the gym on average about 4-5 times per week (usually works out to yoga 3 times, strength training twice), play kickball or some other social sport once per week, and have one complete rest day (in which we are cleaning the house and cooking so it's not just sitting on the couch).   On days I don't feel like going to the gym, I will walk my dog 1.5 miles to downtown, have a Miller Light (or a rum and diet), and walk 1.5 miles back home. It's easy to convince myself to get off the couch if I get a reward for doing it - and Miller light is low enough carb that I can fit it in my carb count (the place I go also has water bowls for my dog).  I do eat back some exercise calories, but not all - things like MFP tend to overestimate calories burned during exercise. Typically I just eat until I'm not hungry any more, and it tends to stay within my allotted net calories for the day. I may increase carbs by a little, to maybe net 25 or 30, but not a ton.  Yoga and walking are great for flexibility and overall health and don't really require resources except for a yoga mat and maybe youtube if you're new to it.  Edit: math"

How many carbs in this or that? Can I reach ketosis going a bit over or is 20g the cut off.  Usually by the time I realize I'm overlooking things its too late.   Count before you eat   I'm also having trouble not going crazy on cheese   Control yourself or don't eat it. Cheese is a common domino food, if that's the case then either exert self control or don't eat it, only solutions    I'm trying to learn how to cook for myself   Good idea, keto or not, cooking is a useful skill    Also I'm gonna be leaving for the weekend to a place with no Internet to check carb amounts. A big trigger for me to give up on my diet plans is being unsure of my amounts which leads me to say fuck it and binge. Stress!   Eat obviously keto friendly foods like meat and eggs and avoid ketosis anxiety    Lastly, with how close I am to my goal weight (15 to 20 lbs yay) do you guys think I should be counting carbs AND cals? Seems hard to do with all the fat I'm suppose to be consuming. I mean good lord, one tablespoon of coconut oil is 120 calories!   You're unlikely to get to your goal without counting calories. However I recommend you re-evaluate your goal, 120 lbs at your height is technically underweight. Time to assess the goal and whether it's realistic. Fat intake is relative, people with lower calorie goals eat less fat, that's how it works.    suggestions    Avoid ketosis anxiety, log before you eat, learn to cook, reassess your goal-it seems unrealistic and likely unsustainable"

Most food items list nutritional information on the packaging these days, so figuring out how many carbs are in things is easy. Even a lot of eggs now list nutrition info out on the inside of the carton, and if you don't see it on the package, you can always Google it!  When I first started out, I would think of the things I might want to eat, look up the nutrition info beforehand, and forecast for the day - For example - I want to go out and eat a bunless burger at a restaurant for dinner on Saturday, so I'll go ahead and map that out now so I know how many carbs and calories will be left over for breakfast and lunch that day. I remember looking up ketchup vs mayo or mustard and determined which would be a better condiment choice (since some places put sugar in ketchup). Then I would look up nutrition for a burger patty, cheese, and whatever topping I expect to be on it and add it all up beforehand. Some people use MFP, some people use other food logging applications for this.   After a while, you start to remember what fits where."

Those are awful, cheap corsets that I can guarantee will break after a month and hurt. Don't buy them. You'll need to invest in a quality, steel-boned corset with good strong fabric made from a natural fiber like 100% cotton coutil or silk. Any blended/fake fabric is going to make you sweat thus decreasing the life of the corset and risking your health via fungal infections, rash, or heat stroke. Quality, waist training corsets cost $$$. I'd suggest you buy a timeless trends corset as it's decent quality for the price and you'll know in a month or two if you hate it. Waist training corsets can easily run $300-1,000 a piece and eventually you'll need to go custom/bespoke. Waist training is not for the feint of heart. It has moments that will be uncomfortable and the results are temporary unless you plan to wear the corset 23/7/365. When you take the corset off your body will relax back to its natural shape. Over time you will become accustomed to squishing and it does get easier. But it doesn't actually ""shape"" your body unless you're wearing the corset.   What are your measurements? Depending on your current waist to hip ratio I can give you an exact recommendation. Also, how tall are you and do you have an average, short, or long torso?  edit: here's what I'd recommend.   If you are taller than 5'5"" or petite but have a long torso https://timeless-trends.com/corsets/white-floral-brocade-corset  If you are shorter than 5'5"" or taller and have an average/short torso http://www.scarlettscorset.com/page50/"
xxketo,3cnkkz,jareths_tight_pants,6,Thu Jul 9 10:52:47 2015 UTC,"They don't give you any long term results. They can make your waist look smaller while you are wearing them, and for a short while after you take them off (like a hour), but that's it. Also there is a negative risk too in that you don't engage your core muscles as much while wearing one which can lead to them being underdeveloped and weak which can lead to injuries, especially back injuries which are no fun.   Now I like to wear corsets occasionally and do enjoy them, but don't be under any illusions that they are doing any long term help."
xxketo,3cnkkz,MadtownMaven,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:57:45 2015 UTC,"I love corsets and am always looking for an excuse to wear (and buy!) them.  To get the results to last more than a few hours, you literally have to do it day in and day out for quite a long time.  In fact, I know ladies who have to sleep in them to maintain the size of waist they like.  The real downside is as the other poster said, your core will weaken as will your back muscles.  So if you're going to do it, you're committing to it.  With that being said, make sure to get a good under bust corset and not any of the flimsy ""showy"" ones for 15 bucks.  A good corset is worth the investment."
xxketo,3cnkkz,Petra_Ann,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:36:30 2015 UTC,Just another voice echoing that true waist training is a very long-term pursuit and it does cost a fair amount of money to get proper corsets. There's a lot of hype and misinformation about waist training right now. The results are not permanent and you really have to commit to wearing the corset the majority of the time to maintain the shape. It's not like you wear a corset here and there and then are rewarded with a permanently changed waist.   Do some research and find out what you can expect to spend in terms of time and money and also be aware of the health challenges long-term waist training can cause.

For all the reasons mentioned but if you want to take it from my Great Aunt Ella who wore them back in the day they were fashionable and necessary for a woman, don't go there.  She really wished she hadn't worn one as it was impossible for her to comfortably not wear one.  I've also seen a few documentaries about what happens inside when you wear one.  The crushing and displacement of organs is alarming.  As is the decrease in cardiovascular stamina when tested.  I'm not even talking about tight lacing!  Nice for a special even/dress but not long-term."
xxketo,3cmlqb,TinyBitOfCarbon,4,Thu Jul 9 02:09:31 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, MFP is percentage based only, which is extremely frustrating because if you ""earn back"" calories from exercise, it also adds carbs / fat / protein (since your percentage goes up). This is one of the reasons I recently switched to a different app.  Key here that you might be missing:  Carbs are a limit. Protien is a goal. Fat is to keep you full.  So you're hitting your goal, which is great. You have to go WAY OVER IT to have it kick you out of ketosis, and if you're active you should be ok because you're using it to maintain muscle, which is good."

A brief rant: I'm tired of MFP's limitations, and their updates just make it worse every time. With their new subscription service, you still can't even pay to see net carbs instead of total, despite it being requested by many users for years. Considering how many keto resources suggest using MFP, providing them free advertising, you'd think they could provide a better solution than, ""use notes."""

xxketo,3cmlqb,the_ether_layer,3,Thu Jul 9 21:42:11 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain so much. Before I found keto I was exercising like crazy for about 14 months and lost a total of 9 pounds. I have never been officially diagnosed with PCOS by a medical doc, but I have many of the symptoms. Here is my best more heartfelt keto advice.    You have to stick with it. I did keto religiously (weighing food, using MFP, watching my macros) for 8 weeks before I started to see the weigh drop, and man, let me tell you, after that it started flying off at an alarming rate. You will get there, but you absolutely have to have faith and stick with it!! Like others have mentioned, you need to supplement with electrolytes. For me, this meant a full measured teaspoon and a half of lite salt mixed in a big glass of water with plain lemon juice. Don't waster your time sipping sugar free powerade or sprinkling crap on food. Get some LoSalt (or NuSalt) or whatever potassium/magnesium you can find and take it. Every Day.  Your mileage may vary, but I had a lot of success by not freaking talking about keto to anyone except my husband and the wonderful women on this forum. People will just not freaking shut up about their opinions on your food choices and how that much bacon can't be good (while they shovel donuts into their smug maws). Keep it on the DL as much as possible. The second the word ""diet"" ""keto"" ""weight loss"" comes out of your mouth you'll probably get a flood of BS from all surrounding friends, co-workers, loved ones. You don't need that crap right now. When you've lost 80lbs, it might be a different story. You have to figure out what works for you. Personally, for me, 1300 calories was too low. I did freaking fantastic at 1590 for the past 12 months and since I've lost about 50lbs, I just now lowered it to 1490. My starting stats were 5'0/184. I would suggest thinking about increasing your limit, and making sure you eat at least 1251, but give yourself some breathing room to eat a bit more (as long as it's keto!!) especially in the beginning. However, see item 3 and feel free to ignore me, you know what's best for you. Always.    And lastly, please keep us updated!!!!!"
xxketo,3cmlqb,octopus-butterfly,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:58:37 2015 UTC,"This is so helpful! Thank you!  So far I've had several NSVs where I turned down the opportunity to munch on some carbs - that's more will power than I've had before!    And I completely know what you mean about people and their opinions.  I'm sad to say that was me over the last year!  My mother has been trying to hype up low carb for a while, and I retorted at every opportunity with all the usual BS ""bad for cholesterol!"" ""Too much fat!"" ""Not healthy!""  ...why are moms always right?"
xxketo,3cmlqb,DownhillYardSale,2,Fri Jul 10 02:24:41 2015 UTC,"It's not too early to be keto flu--but it seems like you're getting quite a bit of sodium.  Perhaps think about adding a little potassium and possibly take a magnesium supplement.    In terms of your macros: I plugged your stats in and got this: 1413 kcal, 20 g carbs, 88 g protein, 109 g fat, 20% deficit.  So you might want to consider more calories, especially if you're feeling really hungry (more about that later).  Protein is very important and you have to go over by a lot to really mess you up.  But you do seem to be having quite a bit.  I would eat less protein and a little more fat.  Why use low-fat versions of things?  The full-fat varieties taste better and will you leave you fuller.  About hunger: it takes a while to adapt to keto.  You'll probably feel hungry a lot.  I certainly did.  It's just something you have to get used to, I think.  Drink more water.  Can't help you with MFP, I've never used it.  Good luck!"
xxketo,3cmlqb,jareths_tight_pants,2,Thu Jul 9 03:13:42 2015 UTC,I had the same protein problem!  Two days sticking to <20g carbs but eating a really high amount of protein.  Try not to see it as a waste and instead see it as step one was lowering carbs and step two is getting the protein into target.  I'm now on day three of hitting all three macros nicely.  It's involved lots of double cream (heavy whipping cream) and butter to get my fat macros up!!  Good luck!
xxketo,3cmlqb,jareths_tight_pants,2,Thu Jul 9 12:52:23 2015 UTC,"AH!  While I was lurking the last few weeks and kept seeing ""HWC"" hailed as some holy grail.  Now that I know what that stands for I'm pretty excited to enjoy that part of Keto ;) Congrats on hitting your macros! Today was day three for me and I did as well :)"
xxketo,3cmlqb,P0PSTART,2,Fri Jul 10 02:28:11 2015 UTC,"Hi there. Welcome. :)  Protein intake should range anywhere from 0.5-1.0g per lb of lean body mass (LBM). Usually 0.8g is recommended with anything above that reserved for people who exercise a lot or are athletes/gaining muscle mass.  70g doesn't sound like much at all.  If that is the case then it means your lean body mass would be 87.5 lb. Subtracting that from 251 lb means that 163.5 lbs of your weight is fat.  That means your body fat % is 65%! Does this seem accurate to you?   Today I started reading more on the protein bit and read that going over grams of protein can pull you out of Ketosis.    It can but you'd have to go over by hundreds of grams of protein, which you aren't doing. Your entire intake for day 1 was 116g and day 2 was 152g.  Protein intake is mandatory to avoid losing muscle mass. If you are concerned about too much protein then put down the pork rinds. :P  I recommend for the first 3 weeks someone eats at close to 150g of protein as possible to avoid losing muscle mass (losing that weight is not healthy) and then dial it back down.  What is your body fat %?   Have I wasted the last two days??? Should I give up my morning protein shake? How important is the protein macro to weight loss?   No. No. Very important - you need to hit it to make sure that loss isn't muscle tissue."

Deaths are hard, but the last thing I want to do when the world otherwise seems out of control is to give up the one thing I can control - what I eat.  In tough times, keeping a level head is important which means I have to continue to take care of myself.  Stop beating yourself up about it and use that energy instead to do something about it.  Take it one minute at a time if you need to, but you need to stop saying ""fuck it!"" like that's OK, it's not and never will be, you deserve better than that.  Engage impulse control and discipline, do it even when you don't feel like doing it, remove ""fuck it"" as an option.  Cut the emotional eating, it's an abusive relationship and until you get out of it you're not going to feel good. The food couldn't care less about you so get your control back.  You and only you can overcome your weaknesses.  There's always a lot more going on mentally but at the end of the day it's do or do not, make this the last day one."

And life style changes take a looooooong time to turn into habit. It's not a linear process. A mountain in real life has a bunch of ridges and valleys to  climb before you make it to the top. Sometimes you gotta go back down before you go back up, but your still progressing. Yo-yoing is apart of the process. The fact that you have regained your ambition is great. Even that alone is a goal within itself. So keep it up. If you fall again, get back at it the next day. Look at it as a hurdle, not as a defeat.   Set small goals. Start with a 5lb pound goal at first. It's easier  to reach and help keep motivation.   Keep it up. This isn't  a new start. You just went down a valley, but your still climbing the mountain."

xxketo,3cjp9e,Just4Kix1230,3,Thu Jul 9 00:35:32 2015 UTC,"You got this :)  So, one thing that I found really helped early on was making supplemental dishes - keto pizza, I buy a keto friendly ice cream (Clemmy's), sf chocolate etc.  I'm realizing now that the withdrawal process was actually months, even though the really strong part is only the first week or two.  Being prepared is the biggest weapon you have when your will power isn't as strong.  Try not restricting calories at first, just do keto foods (meats+veggies+low sugar fruit aka berries+fatty dairy+nuts/seeds) and when you feel those ""fuck it"" (you got this) moments, have some keto alternatives easily accessible.  That means on the days when you're feeling good make a keto pizza and freeze serving sizes, make some keto cookie dough and freeze it, keep some keto chocolate and ice cream around.  Also, be sure to have snacks around when traveling to help with those moments in any location; I started keeping a bag of jerky, nuts etc in my car.  I also think that eating a healthy version of keto can make a big difference - if you're just eating bacon and heavy whipping cream everyday that's gonna get old fast and really isn't the healthiest route.  Make sure you're getting vegetables daily, and I'd also personally recommend some fermented foods.  Aim for consuming whole foods, versus just trying to get a bunch of fat into you.  Hope that helps!"

You get tired going back, and half expect to fail again.  (Or-at least I was. )  Take a deep breath.  Stop the Day Ones.  Start now... yes, even though it's likely the middle of the day.  When the ""oh f@#k it"" arrives - and IMO if we're all honest it WILL because life happens - remind yourself gently that “no, falling face-first into a bowl of chocolate covered sugar bombs will NOT make me feel better” (hopefully that elicited a smile). For me-reminding myself of that truth makes it easier to say no in the moment.  Distracting myself helps…  then keep going.  It’s Day 3, 4… a bump here, a holiday there... just keep going.

xxketo,3cjp9e,imadorkdog,2,Wed Jul 8 16:45:03 2015 UTC,I think you need to maybe set yout goals differently. Maybe just try to stick wheat free or gluten free for a bit until you feel you can be in a bit more stabilized place. If your not in the headspace nothing is going to help you stick to it. Going keto for a few days would probably be worse than eating moderately healthy non keto all the time.

xxketo,3cjr0z,dinosnoores,6,Wed Jul 8 13:25:17 2015 UTC,"I've been keto for one year this month (in 3 days).  The benefits have far outweighed the negatives for me, but I was really unhealthy when I started this.  I weighed 211lbs (I'm short, too), had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and my A1C was creeping on up into diabetic range.  My periods had been super light or AWOL for a few years, and I had painful uterine fibroids (probably have/had undiagnosed PCOS).  I literally could not sit at my desk at work without sweating and breathing hard.  I was down to one pair of pants that fit.  :(  Keto has fixed all that, plus I'm now within (hopefully) 15lbs of my goal weight, which is amazing.  I have been fat my whole life.  The only negative I can think of health-wise comes from neglecting electrolytes.  It's crucial to get enough sodium, especially.  If you don't, you will feel like crap.  Seems a lot of people start keto and completely ignore the part about the keto flu, thinking it doesn't apply to them.  Or they assume they're getting plenty of salt when they're not.  You see posts here and at r/keto every day from frustrated people who are about to give up, and clearly all they need is a cup of broth or two to get rid of the dizziness, the headaches, the brain fog, the charlie horses.  It's so worth it to get the electrolytes figured out.  Socially, I can think of a few more drawbacks.  At the start, especially, you might get crap from friends and family.  Even if you don't mention what you're doing, they will notice, and they will comment.  Sometimes they will take it as a personal affront, like you think you're better than they are because they aren't giving up Cokes and you are.  It's kind of ridiculous, but that's on them, not us.  My MIL once offered to put a bite of German chocolate cake in my mouth for me so it ""wouldn't be my fault.""  If alcohol is involved, that can cause issues.  My tolerance is pretty much gone.  I'm sure part of that is the weight loss, but I think a lot of it's just keto.  I used to be able to put away 8 Jack and Cokes in a night.  Now, two whiskey and club sodas and I am sick.  Also can lead to poor food decisions.  If you're out partying and drinking, that plate of French fries starts to look real good with lowered inhibitions.  Going out with friends can be a test at the start if you're not sure what you can eat and/or you're not willing to look ""weird"" by ordering something like a bunless burger or broccoli instead of potatoes.  You learn fast on this, though.  I have no problems now figuring out what to order from most menus.  And there's just plain ol' cravings and staying/getting back on the wagon.  Some get into the mindset that they have to do this absolutely perfect or not at all, and that's not the case.  Having a banana for breakfast does not mean you've gotta have a sandwich, chips, and a soda for lunch and pasta and cookies for dinner.  You can always start back over with the very next thing you put in your mouth.  You'll even see posts here of people outright panicking because they didn't realize Nyquil had carbs and OMG NOW THEY'RE OUT OF KETOSIS AND EVERYTHING IS RUINED.  A dose of cough syrup does not negate weeks or months of healthy eating, but you'd think it was the end of the world for some.  Having to cook most of your own food gets to some people.  Hasn't been an issue for me; I've been cooking since I was 10, so I just cook like I always did but leave out the carbs.  Others come to this with little to no cooking skills and give up because they don't have time to cook/don't know what to cook and nothing sounds good and: http://memegenerator.net/instance/39459185  If I think of anything else, I will edit it in, but this has been a fabulous lifestyle change for me.  I truly believe keto saved my life.  :)"
xxketo,3cjr0z,sassytaters,3,Wed Jul 8 14:23:30 2015 UTC,"To be honest, there are few negative effects of a well-formulated keto diet, however that being said like most nutrition research there are few well-controlled long-term studies however there is historical data from populations who have been eating a keto diet for centuries as well as many here who have been eating this way for a long time.  There are well known side effects of a certain keto diets like the keto diet for epilepsy but that is quite different from a standard keto diet.    Are there particular concerns you have?   The negative effects it seems are more practical - sustainability, compliance, food quality"
xxketo,3cjr0z,anbeav,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:31:22 2015 UTC,"Concerns he brought up included heart health, food quality (currently we can't afford organic/grass fed meats), monetary strain on food budget, kidney stones. My own personal concern is TMI: changes in smells/taste of lady parts ?"
xxketo,3cjr0z,anbeav,4,Wed Jul 8 13:38:54 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're not currently eating organic/grass fed meat, keto wouldn't really change that and moreover don't let perfection be the enemy of good, grass fed meat is ideal but the marginal benefit is not much.  Keto improves cardiovascular disease risk for most both as a product of weight loss but also reduced inflammation and improved risk factors (triglycerides, HDL, blood pressure, etc).  Moreover, if we consider that the incidence and prevalence of heart disease only continues to increase as saturated fat and meat intake has decreased, it's indicative that the fat isn't really the issue, it's likely the intake of everything else that has increased that is the issue. It does not increase the risk of kidney stones, that is a myth. There are people who are more susceptible to kidney stones, keto or not, keto can make a pre-existing stone symptomatic if you don't stay hydrated but does not cause the stones. Most don't have a change in the smell/taste in the lady parts and if so it goes away with time.   There are great videos in the sidebar at /r/keto. There are great books on the topic - The Big Fat Surprise, The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living, Death by Food Pyramid, Peter Attia's blog (theeatingacademy.com)."
xxketo,3cjr0z,DownhillYardSale,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:45:54 2015 UTC,"Concerns he brought up included heart health   Keto improves heart health. Your heart already uses ketones for fuel so now you are providing it with even more healthy fuel. Ketones also create less toxic byproducts in the body which overall create a healthier systemic environment. Now your body has more energy to do productive shit instead of fighting off all the crap that comes with a normal diet.   food quality (currently we can't afford organic/grass fed meats),   Organic food isn't any healthier for you. I can understand regarding grass fed meats. You have to start somewhere, though.   monetary strain on food budget,   If you want to make this happen you will.   kidney stones.   Keto doesn't cause kidney stones.   My own personal concern is TMI: changes in smells/taste of lady parts ?   Can't help you there. I've never dated a woman in ketosis."
xxketo,3cjr0z,calibur_,2,Thu Jul 9 17:11:17 2015 UTC,"I can testify that even if you are initially buying more expensive food (more meats, more bacon, more dairy products, etc...) you will actually save money in the long run, even while buying these things. Keto naturally reduces your appetite and you will eat much less food than you used to, and less often."
xxketo,3cjr0z,DownhillYardSale,2,Fri Jul 10 09:56:10 2015 UTC,Good point calibur!  Not to mention the savings in health costs by not having to be attended by medical professionals nearly as often. :)

xxketo,3cjr0z,BabiiChayne,2,Wed Jul 8 14:54:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for asking this question OP, while I was aware of the very few negatives, it's good to have this kind of information on hand :)  On another note, I admire you and your SO so much from a relationship point of view. Having more than a bit of trouble from my own with my choice to go Keto. You guys are inspirational."
xxketo,3cjr0z,jareths_tight_pants,2,Fri Jul 10 23:03:34 2015 UTC,"aw thank you. We try to communicate a lot and support each other as much as possible. The most beneficial thing for me was making sure I knew what I was talking about. If I went to him and said ""Hun, I'm going to start this new diet/lifestyle where I only eat green food because random internet people told me it was a good idea"" He probably would be way less supportive. Maybe your SO just doesn't understand Keto and the benefits?"
xxketo,3cjr0z,DownhillYardSale,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:11:18 2015 UTC,"The only negatives I see are that you have to be more conscious of your vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes, and the expense. You can fit keto into any budget but meat/dairy is generally more expensive than carbs."
xxketo,3cjr0z,cedrus_libani,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:10:42 2015 UTC,"It's obvious you've researched the plus side of Keto, but have you looked into the negative effects of it too?   There are no long-term clinical trials that indicate negative impacts of the ketogenic diet upon people.  A person prone to anxiety can freak out initially about electrolytes and such (I did, trust me).  Electrolytes are a daily requirement so although not necessarily a negative it will require maintaining proper intake so that you do not experience awful symptoms.  Beyond that this diet is incredibly healthy.  There is a possibility that some people will experience increased total cholesterol/LDL-C (and by proxy ApoB/LDL-P), which is negative. The ""fix"" thus far seems to be to replace saturated fats in the diet with healthy mono/polyunsaturated fats, which is easily doable.  Good luck."

It's just that when there is a problem people upvote and talk for support, so obliviously it gets more attention.   I could be wrong. Maybe we should do a poll.

xxketo,3cj12v,Just4Kix1230,2,Wed Jul 8 16:50:26 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, periods can change for many reasons.   Also it would be interesting to see if it correlated at all with how much weight you had to lose and other factors. My guess is the more weight you have to lose the more hormones you may have stored in your body."

I have a very mild period. Comes every 28 days on the dot. Rare cramping. Mild PMS. And I cherish the crap out of it. So all this talk about periods going on a rampage worried me.   My SO started keto and I saw the weight he was losing and I decided to just go for it. I have had no issues. Well, ok...the PMS gets a little bad when I start craving chocolate. It's a little ridiculous how emotional I get sometimes. And it's never been like that pre-keto. But we keep a couple bars of dark chocolate on hand to help curb the craving. I try and make some fat bombs when I know its on the way.   Other then that I am fine. So if any lurkers are reading and are hesitant because of the crazy period talks. Just go for it!"
