Which means I have FIVE GODDAMN SECONDS to myself to sit at the computer and make this throwaway account. I am ready to receive my adoring fans. Bow before me.  OK, seriously, I was sort of worried you guys would be mad that I even referenced you at all! I wanted to respect the rules but this sub is pretty much my favorite place on the Internet, and you ladies are the shit. So I couldn't resist including it in the article.  Thanks so much for all your kind words and virtual hugs, and I'm so happy that you all noticed, and appreciated, my little shout-out. AND that some new BroMoms were able to join our ranks because of the article!  Numerous shitheads on Slate wrote comments which basically said ""you should stop nursing your baby so much, give him formula"" or ""here's how you should wean your baby off nursing during his nap"" and I was like HA! You're an asshole. Keep your sanctimonious judgment to yourself! No BroMom would ever say that shit to me. Oh, and if I didn't nurse him all damn day, I'd have so much less time to be on Reddit :)  Love you guys, Tamar"

I have felt like a failure of a mother for most of my baby's life because this is how naps are for us. I hear so many people talking about doing chores during naptime, or exercising, or eating real meals, or watching TV and chilling out, or whatever, and there I am laying down in a darkened room with a white noise machine on, scrolling through Reddit on my phone in silence. It's something I'd never confess outside of Breaking Mom and I felt awed and amazed to see it mentioned like No Big Thing in a mainstream, nationwide publication. And in an article that was not about ""freaks who made their babies overly attached to them"" or something, on top of that, and was in fact not about ""parenting tactics"" - as if there are any, other than ""get through it"" - at all, but just about some other thing, and oh hey yeah this is how my kid naps.

This has happened before and I know it will pass eventually, but it always makes things better to hear someone else say all you can do is get through it.

I understand why it was difficult to make the decision that you did, but doing the right thing is not always the same as doing the easy thing.  I know it puts you in a shitty, horrible position with the relationship your husband has with these people, but sometimes we just have to do what we know is the right thing, and deal with whatever the consequences are.  You're doing the right thing here.  These kids need somebody to stick their neck out for them because that is NOT safe.  Also, did I read you correctly that your husband thinks this method of discipline is a good idea??"

I had such a hard time reading comments in my other post where people didn't seem to realize I was in a tough spot. YES I care about the girls and wanted to stick up for them.

I'm so sorry that was happening to you.  I absolutely get wanting to do a ""gut check"" and just kind of make sure, like, ""Okay, this seems ridiculously bad to me... but is it just me?  And does this outweigh the possible fallout to my own family (who, like it or not, is my first fucking priority)?""  It is so hard to weight this out sometimes, but I think you ultimately made the right choice.

breakingmom,3dy71a,missy070203,8,Mon Jul 20 16:06:18 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure I convinced my husband that this is abuse. Right after they left the house, I said ""that's really disturbing that they do that,"" and he was kind of saying ""it's not that big of a deal."" He had been drinking though and he really looks up to his friend. My husband unfortunately is a little too laid back for his own good. The next day I said ""we need to talk about this some more,"" and I told him, it's abuse, it needs to be stopped, I think it should be reported. He said he would talk to his friend about it when the wife was not around. I also told him that my oldest daughter will NOT be visiting them (we had been making plans for her to go next time he travels there for business and she would stay with the family) and he said he is fine with that and he understands. So that's kind of where we left it between the two of us. Please don't think badly of my husband. He is a loving, caring, devoted partner and father. His judgment sometimes gets clouded by others around him."

I'm glad that you and your husband have the kind of relationship where you can express your concerns and come to a consensus.  The headline here, though, is that you did the right thing and it may cause a bit of a shitstorm, but better you deal with a shitstorm than one of those girls deal with a trip to the hospital (or worse)!"
breakingmom,3dy71a,nervousgirl396,9,Mon Jul 20 15:33:06 2015 UTC,"I know. Part of the reason that they really need someone to stick up for them is because the husband is a surgeon and the wife is a PA. They actually said that they don't care if they bleed, break bones, whatever, because they can patch them up right there at home. So even if they get really hurt, they might not actually end up in a hospital where a doctor will see them. It's so, so sick. I'm honestly more worried about the psychological damage, though."
breakingmom,3dy71a,dietotaku,9,Mon Jul 20 15:35:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, that is way more gross than I originally thought (which was pretty bad already)!!  And, I agree, the psychological damage is nothing to shake a stick at here.  I don't understand why they think that literally teaching their kids that fighting is how to resolve a conflict is a wise idea.  Like, what are these girls going to do when they are in a relationship as adults?  Or in the workplace?  Or with their friends?  We disagree!  Off to the boxing ring, folks!  How do these people survive in their workplaces!?!?!"
breakingmom,3dy71a,CocoonReady,11,Mon Jul 20 15:47:32 2015 UTC,"the husband is a surgeon and the wife is a PA   I think this makes the situation worse. They are mandatory reporters.

breakingmom,3dy71a,Clasi,6,Mon Jul 20 17:16:21 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing, that they are mandatory reporters. It's so upsetting. Not to defend what they are doing because I obviously think they are abusing the girls, but just for some background, the husband was raised by a very seriously disturbed woman so he literally doesn't know what is normal and what is not. When I said ""that is an interesting parenting idea, whose idea was it?"" the wife (actually the stepmother to the girls) said that's what they did in her own family growing up. So maybe I am still a little bit in denial myself, but I would rather not think that it is deliberate but seriously misguided."

Most disputes were settled with violence. It's hostile to live that way.   I have a twin sister who since were were less than a year old, has been literally twice my size. I wore toddler clothes into the 3rd grade and she was always the tallest and fattest kid in our class. Even now at 30 she is 5'11 and about 400lbs. I'm about 5'5 and 150lbs (not for long because I'm pregnant). She broke my nose once and my dad fixed it in the kitchen with a spoon.  It's traumatizing. You did the right thing. Even if CPS does nothing more than a home visit and a letter, maybe that will be enough for them to stop doing it."

If you were fighting (physically) in his class, the next day, you had to go 10 rounds in a boxing ring with 16 oz gloves.  To me, this is a lot different than your situation because 1) they're already physically fighting (not sure how much this helps), 2) boxing gloves, boxing rules protect the boxer and the one getting hit 3) very few people can actually go 10 rounds in 16 oz gloves.  After the first minute, it was more of a cardio workout with lots of dodging than a fight.  AND he did it decades ago."

I have to admit, I've been there... in a situation where I'm really attached to a friendship and very willing to overlook things that don't seem quite right in order not to rock the ol' boat.  But, from what OP has said in comments, it sounds like that was his immediate, in-the-moment reaction, and after some talking and reflecting, he's of the same mind as OP that this is not good."
breakingmom,3dy71a,lucyfour,2,Mon Jul 20 15:49:27 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to say this, but if your husband is more concerned with his friendship than those kids, he might want to ask himself why. And if that friendship is more important than his marriage, same thing. I think you did the right thing. Kids need someone to stand up for them. CPS will talk to them and do what they can- at least you don't have to sit around wondering what you could have done to help."
breakingmom,3dy71a,lucyfour,2,Mon Jul 20 16:22:13 2015 UTC,"I really dont think he would consider his friendship more important than his marriage or the girls. He was in as hard of a position as I was, maybe even worse. Can you imagine calling CPS on one of your best friends? And for the record, he didn't ask me not to call. He definitely didn't want me to report it but would not have stood in my way if I put my foot down and said I was going to make the call. I guess it's my own cowardice that made me do it ""behind his back"" so to speak."

Hopefully this will be the wake up call your friends need to realize that this shit isn't okay. CPS does have more tools than simply taking kids away. I'm going to guess that they'll force the parents to take some parenting classes and keep an eye on them in the future, but CPS responses varies so much by state and even district that I couldn't tell you for certain what will happen. It will be investigated at the very least though"

breakingmom,3dy71a,Flitterbee,4,Mon Jul 20 21:45:55 2015 UTC,"That's not an easy thing to do. Trust me, I understand better than I want to where you are right now. I used to work for CPS, though I worked with kids who had already been removed from their home and were in a group home. CPS varies so. damn. much. Some places will ignore everything but the worst abuse while some will jump all over little stupid things.   Overall though CPS is more reasonable than they're given credit for. The kids I worked with were either surrendered to the state by their parents or removed for good reasons. I personally didn't work with a single kid that I thought was taken away unjustly, just a few that I wished were taken away a bit sooner. The person I had to call CPS on was forced into alcohol treatment, the kid learned about AlAnon/AlAteen, and after a fair amount of drama and classes for both of them things got better. Not perfect, but better. Now that I know how heart-wrenchingly common child abuse is I doubt your friends' kids will be taken away, but there will almost certainly be a reality-check.  I wish I could do more to support you. If you have any questions or just need to vent or hear some kind words feel free to PM me."
breakingmom,3dy71a,missnewreddit,2,Mon Jul 20 23:30:47 2015 UTC,"i read the other post and you absolutely did the right thing. even if nothing comes of it, at least it's on record that somebody said something, acknowledged it was wrong and tried to stop it.   does your husband know you had someone call? i do think he should find out from you rather than his friends (because who knows what kind of spin they will put on it), but it may help to broach the subject by exploring exactly where his boundaries are on this issue and what he would be okay with happening as a result. like the other thread mentioned, sure he may have wanted to slug his siblings once or twice, but would that have made him a better person? would he have wanted to be forced into a fight that had to continue whether he was winning or losing, whether he wanted to stop or not? would he have wanted every ""he took too long in the bathroom"" or ""he drew dickbutts all over my favorite CD cover"" to result in getting pummeled in the head? for fuck's sake, if pre-teen/teenage girls are getting bitchy with each other, they need to sit down and TALK about what's bothering them, not give each other black eyes until mom says stop. that's the opposite of effective communication.  anyway, i think if your husband is asked to really search his feelings and understand what these girls are being put through, he'll see that it's not right. plus, like you said, the chances are very good that the girls won't be instantly removed from the home, but the parents will instead have to attend classes and be coached on appropriate conflict resolution strategies. knowing that, would your husband agree that it's a good outcome for the whole family? yes, it's probable that if the parents deduce who was behind the report, that they may not want to be friends with you & your husband anymore. hopefully going through parenting classes and realizing how they were hurting their kids will make them realize that you did what was in their best interests and they can forgive you. but if they don't, what kind of uncle puts his friendship above the well-being of his nieces?"

These women are brutally honest about their daily trials and give me so much perspective about my life as a mom and housewife. They share their minor frustrations—with humor, empathy, and sometimes rage—but also their struggles with addiction, divorce, domestic abuse, illness, death of a partner, suicide, you name it. And the comments on this sub are so warm and open, so kind and compassionate, that it brings tears to my eyes sometimes.

My husband has mentioned to me before that, when we have a really long dry spell sexually, he starts to worry (quite irrationally he admits) that I don't love/need him anymore.  And I am talking like a month of no hanky panky.  Maybe your hubby is the same way?  However, getting up in your face like a petulant child who didn't get dessert is pretty fucking sad.  What did he expect you to do?  Beg for forgiveness while giving him a hand job?  I'd get some sleep and tell him off afterwards when your ""righteous anger"" outways your ""exhausted sadness""."

One of them (Both their names start with K, so I'll just call her K1) K1, told me one time I went away for 2 weeks (unplanned, once of a lifetime thing for me) the winter my mother first left (she left almost 5 years ago to be with her boyfriend again across the country, still gone) to ""Please come back"" because our mother already abandoned her, and she didn't want me to abandon her too.  I feel like shit, because for the past few weeks, for the first time in their lives, I have walked away.  Their father is a man who used to beat me (specifically) as a kid, and having to be civil and deal with him for their sake has been so hard, but they don't see any of that.

The best you might get is a ""hey, hi there,"" and I hope you realize that all the appreciation in them lies under that--even when they might never find the words to give to you.  Don't hate this time to spare them, but release that hate for yourself. You're not alone necessarily as much as you're finally finished doing this job.

It's not OK to punk you, and jump ship for what they perceive to be better opportunity. You were loyal and sacrificed for them to the point that you maxed out... and they turned around and felt no obligation to even so much as consider your feelings. You sacrificed your former years so they could have theirs. You're a hero for that, and I do hope one day they pull their heads out of their twats and rectify the wrong they have done to you by basically leaving without considering how you worry and care.  They have chosen to stop leaning on you, let them go out on their own now and deal with the fraction of the reality that you've dealt with. I hope you don't end up like me though with the resentment and desire to see them fail or hurt for having abandoned you. I can tell you from my seat and my own similar story, it's not worth it. Take permission to be selfish and let them go without losing love and empathy. The tides of fortune are lost upon me simply for losing those feelings. Because I no longer appreciate, and am a shell of my former self. Be angry, but get over it when you can. It's worth it. I have lost years. I hope you dont!!!"

I don't know many kids that are fully trained at 2.5, and when you are up to it, you can deal with the pacifier.    Keep in touch with your counselor and doctor.  Remember anti-depressants can take time to really work, and sometimes need to be fine-tuned. Can you reach out to your partner or a friend or family member?  I have not experienced depression, but I do have anxiety, and I find it helpful to have a person I can text just to say I am having a bad day.

The pacifier thing I wouldn't be to worried about, its the same thing when you are both ready it will happen . If you feel like you want to try to conquer these things the reward system worked great for us .

As long as she's potty trained by age 6, you're golden. And the pacifier? She puts it in her mouth, falls asleep, and it falls out. No teeth damage. During the day sometimes isn't going to kill her at this age.  I find telling my kids ""I'm depressed, some of my wires are crossed, but I need you to know I love you"" makes us all breathe a little easier. If the depression gets worse or seems to affect your kids, see a shrink. I love my psychiatrist and my therapist.

My almost-4 year old girl wasn't NEAR ready for the potty at 2.5, and still uses a paci for bed. She didn't potty train until 3.5. She just wasn't there, but the social pressure was SO heavy.  She literally just didn't care if she wet herself. We took it slow. I can check off that box now, but the paci still remains. One thing at a time. There are so many days I just don't have the energy for anything and it's Sesame Street and Thomas all day. But they can come to me for a hug (or whatever) anytime, they are fed, and safe. That's big. Being a good mom isn't all pinterest crafts and perfect milestones."

Then as soon you can today get a man to go with you down to the police station. Have them raise hell with you. Tell the police that you want a civilian complaint if they won't file anything else for you. If they try to bully you explain that it's ""necessary for your insurance"". If your local police are lazy, or overworked, they may hem and haw but don't walk out of there without a written copy of a complaint. Explain that if you don't do something you are being negligent to keeping your child out of harm. Use those exact words. Repeat every time this happens. Sooner or later the officers will tell your neighbors to cut their shit out in order to shut you up.   I would also go to the local town council meeting and raise hell. If there isn't a ordinance specifically covering this on the books, push for one. Call, write, show up to the meetings. If it continues without remedy call the news out to look at the holes in your house. I assure you something will be done to stop this no matter where you live if a picture of your damages ends up in the news with a byline of how your baby was almost hurt. I live in a very gun and hunting friendly area and even out here something similar happened between to neighbors across the street from each other, acres away and with no kids involved and it blew up once it escalated to the local newspaper.   I know anxiety can make this process feel impossible but you have to push in order to protect your family and home. You can do it!"

Then if you get anything in the mail from collections have them do a debt verification and since you paid it off, it should all work out fine.   Look up medical bill debt verification and you should get some sample letter.  I haven't ever had to do the debt verification part.  I just paid the bill and it was dropped. I also wouldn't talk to any debt collectors on the phone especially to tell them you are going to do this. Also, a lot of medical places have their own in house collections agency and it doesn't get put on your credit report."

We were just finally starting to scrape together something resembling a savings account, and then I got pregnant, had a missed miscarriage, and had to have a D & C. Just got all the bills from that one, and here we go, right back into owing way more than seems reasonable for not even 1 full day in the hospital.   I'm not sure where you're located, but if you are able to pay that collections bill soon, they probably won't report it to the credit bureaus. At least that has been my experience (I've also had a couple smaller medical bills slip past my radar and land in collections, and as long as I paid them right off, they didn't go on my credit report).  And for what it's worth, bankruptcy wasn't really the worst thing in the whole world for us. One year post-bankruptcy and my credit score is honestly better than it has been in a long time. We have to wait longer than I would like to buy a house, but at least we might have a fighting chance at it in the next 5 years. Good luck to you, sending good vibes your way."

You did what you were supposed to do. You did everything right. This is NOT your fault.   Hang in there, mama.  This too shall pass."

She had to have breathing treatments at her doctors office, which I know terrified her, but she was too weak to really fight me or the mask :(  They misdiagnosed her first as well and thought it was just a virus. She ended up needing two rounds of antibiotics and an inhaler to get rid of it for good. It's terrible.  But she's totally fine now!  It's not your fault. Kids get sick. You're doing great.

breakingmom,3dxo1i,Notta_Throwaway,3,Mon Jul 20 17:08:08 2015 UTC,As a car seat stickler it is a big deal. Sometimes if you call the company they will send you replacement parts or if it's under warrantee they may just send you a new one. You could always buy a seat and return it after your trip if the company is willing to help you out. All car seats have to meet the the same testing standards to a 50 dollar seat will work just as well as a 300 dollar seat.
breakingmom,3dxo1i,mominnl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:50:15 2015 UTC,"I've heard that about the price of car seats before.  Can you point me to a source?  I also think of myself as a car seat stickler, and it's hard to find solid information out there.    Part of my issue is that that seat we have costs $400.  My MIL bought it on recommendation from the head of trauma at the children's hospital where she works, the thought being that her grandbaby must have ""the best"" car seat.  So I don't want to fly into a frenzy buying a replacement seat, especially a $400 seat, and even if I did, it's not in stock in local stores and would need to be ordered.  But we're leaving tomorrow...  But I also don't want to buy a cheap car seat, because what if it is less safe?  And what if our seat really is ""fine?"""
breakingmom,3dxo1i,Notta_Throwaway,2,Mon Jul 20 17:06:54 2015 UTC,"They have to meet the same minimum requirements, but companies that sell the more expensive seats generally do more in-house testing and have more rigorous standards. Now, it comes down to a trust issue - do you trust the companies to actually have higher standards and do more testing? Personally, I do. The results typically show through third-party testing like Consumer Reports. Current regulations in the US don't require side impact or rollover testing (unless the regulations have changed recently, which is possible), but many seats offer such protection and unbiased testing also typically checks these things.   However, a cheap car seat that you know is undamaged might still be a better choice than a seat you aren't sure is safe. That's a tough call!  I hope the manufacturer gets back to you quickly!"
breakingmom,3dxo1i,Notta_Throwaway,2,Mon Jul 20 17:25:14 2015 UTC,"Every car seat needs to pass a minimum safety requirement set by the National highway association. After that everything pretty much goes up according to features. The key is having one that fits your car correctly, and is installed correctly. It's crazy scary to me that like 80% of people have their car seats installed wrong. Do you have a foonf? I would really try to contact them and ask them. They will be able to tell you for sure if it is still safe to use, and may be able to help get you a replacement part if it no longer is."
breakingmom,3dxo1i,Notta_Throwaway,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:51:00 2015 UTC,"Sorry I forgot to include a source. This is a really good explanation of everything right here. http://www.car-safety.org/guide.html I have a safety first on board air 65, a diono radio rxt, and a combi infant carrier for the youngest. There are things I love and hate about all of them, but they fit and are installed correctly."
breakingmom,3dxo1i,needs_a_name,2,Mon Jul 20 18:53:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  The list of features was an interesting read.  I'm in Canada, so while our standards are not exactly the same, I know we also have a set of requirements that all seats sold need to meet.  Ours has lots of the features mentioned, fits well in our car, and we've had it checked to ensure that we install it correctly, so I'm usually very confident in it.  I did get someone from the manufacturer to look over pictures of the damage, and she assured me that the seat will be safe to use until we get the replacement piece, so all is good.    We are very lucky that hubby's parents have so far offered to buy all of the car seats (and snow suits) that our stinker has needed.  I will take your info to heart, though, if we ever need to buy a car seat ourselves.  Nothing wrong with the most expensive model when someone else is footing the bill, but great to know it's not a necessity!"

breakingmom,3dvybo,dietotaku,6,Mon Jul 20 05:18:21 2015 UTC,Wow. While I certainly don't want frivolous cases being investigated this could have a really negative impact on whether someone reports. Some cases are clear cut but a lot aren't. If people don't feel comfortable reporting potential abuse than it's the kid who's going to suffer.   And I'm all for a penalty for false reporting but that amount seems really over the top to me. A fine 1/3 that size would likely be enough to stop false reports.

But I would like to see some efforts addressing false reports to CPS.  A significant percentage of calls to the Children's Aid in my town are simply angry people seeking revenge.  It has happened to me, and it has happened to friends.   I'm not sure I'm in favour of anonymous reporting.  I think it offers far too much room for abuse.  I hear the argument that without it people wouldn't be willing to report, but I think that's actually an unlikely outcome.  Having to leave your name, with an assurance that the CPS agency would keep it private, would allow agencies to ignore reports from known trouble-makers.  For instance, when a friend left an abusive idiot, the CAS worker (who came to her house in response to the asshole's call) could have verified that he was the caller and clearly interested in harassment. Instead my friend had to proceed as if his complaint was legitimate.  Who does that serve?  And, given that the CAS doesn't have the best track record of protecting kids (the worst stories of abuse I've ever heard come form the foster system - not from parents), I don't know that giving them extraordinary powers of search and seizure is a net benefit."

My oldest 5.5yo has moderate to severe eczema started at 6mo so we've  been though the ringer. In the summer we get a reprieve  because of the pool and sun so while we've never done it at home I know lots of people who have success with bleach baths there's lots of instructions out there on how to do them. The pool chlorine and bleach baths do the same thing.  Most Lotions don't help my girl a ton but the ones that do a little are cerave, cetaphil, and eucerin. Make sure there are no fragrances and use the ointments (tubs of stuff) over the actual lotion variants.  Good luck mama. Eczema is no joke and a giant pain in my ass."

breakingmom,3dx8m6,ZenMommy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:42:10 2015 UTC,"My son has severe eczema, as in we just cleared up the horrific rash that started in February. He was treated by one of the top pediatric dermatologists in our area, this lady knows her shit and I love her for it.   Here's her treatment for us:   Bathe daily in warm (not hot) water, using only Vanicream soap, followed by Vanicream moisturizer on barely dry skin. Keeping skin moisturizer is the most important part!  Use only Vanicream diaper cream and sunscreen, when needed.   If using prescribed steroid cream, use exactly as directed, not doing so can result in worse eczema.   Cotton socks and clothes as much as possible.   Sun and chlorine have helped a lot, but not necessarily for everyone.   This sounds like a lot of rules, but it's been the best way we've been able to treat my son. Vanicream is highly recommended among dermatologists and can be found on Amazon or at Walgreens. I'm sure cetaphil or cereve are fine too, the idea is to be consistent with what you're using, so you know what is causing the outbreak. Just when my son was getting better, I used a baby sunscreen on him, which caused the rash to get 1000x worse.   Good luck mama, I've spent more time in a dermatologists office over the last six months than most people do in their lives, but watching my baby be so miserable was the worst part. Hopefully yours will have a faster recovery!"

breakingmom,3dx8m6,emily8305,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:21:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, 100%, BUT only if I'm extremely consistent with following those steps. I tried another ""sensitive skin"" sunscreen ONE afternoon and he started breaking out, skipped two baths in a row due to late softball games, another breakout.   However, these breakouts go away within a day or two and are extremely mild compared to before. We have two different steroid ointments to use, only where there's a breakout, and only twice a week.   The dermatologist said it's basically like playing whack-a-mole with the breakout spots, but we're keeping it under control pretty well. If you're interested in the moisturizer, it's kinda expensive ($15-17), but lasts for a long time. It's the kind in a tub with a pump. I love the bar soap too, that's only like $3-4. I feel like using them together works the best."

As soon as they left I told my girls that while they thought it was funny look at mess they made that was now someone else's problem. And asked them how they would feel if they had to clean it up?

Now I get everyone parents differently and really I don't care how your kid acts. But you better believe that I will use the little shitlings as an example of bad behavior.

She knows our rules and carries on living by them with lots of positive attention for her good behaviour, it breaks my heart when he hurts her (my brother makes him apologise if he sees it or allows me to do that if he doesn't) and she asks me why he did that.   She sees the praise she gets for her good behaviour and has worked out that she'd prefer that to the negative attention he gets (as well as the negative consequences, but not sure your niece gets those from what you say).  Raise your boy to behave how you'd like him to behave and be open and honest with him if he asks about your niece's behaviour, don't give excuses for her and he'll soon learn.

I know you probably mean that you were upset and your husband got you out of that situation but I hope you see what I'm trying to get at.   My almost two year old started hitting a while ago and we tried things like time-outs and trying to explain that hitting was bad and it hurts people. Those didn't really work. If she wants to freak out because I asked her to stop hitting, I let her. I tell her I'm leaving the room but she can come get me when she's ready to apologize, and she does (eventually)! If she's still hitting, I smack her hand and honestly, that really sent her the message that hitting hurts. Just a little smack, I don't beat her. I don't even have to smack her hand anymore. I just have to say, ""Are you hitting?"" in a warning tone and she stops. I can tell she's still mad but she stops.

Our 16 month old, so I started sleep training at about 10 months, I nurse until she's kinda sleepy, then I just put her in her crib and she's out. She knows now that when she's on her blanket, she's going to go to bed whether she likes it or not and just sleeps right away.

She literally didn't nap so it was that or death by wine. We did naps and bedtime all in one go and it took a few days. Naps were definitely worse and she cried harder for those than at bedtime.  Something that really helped me was changing the order of our bedtime routine so that boobing wasn't the last thing that happened. We do bath, boob, story, song, bed.   My daughter is super routine driven so anytime that gets messed up (vacation, travel, etc.) she has to be retrained when we get home.

I didn't want to do it, but I couldn't handle the sleep deprivation any more, I just couldn't. She's a happy, healthy kid now, and I'm not crazy, so it worked out for the best.

breakingmom,3dvdar,EffyGreen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:21:40 2015 UTC,"I started with bedtimes, around that age and we did CIO. We started doing the Ferber thing (graduated extinction I guess?) but then after a few days noticed that going in was just prolonging the misery so we just did straight extinction. Like you, we started on a weekend so that we both had the opportunity to get some rest during the day after. The first night we put him in bed and verbalized that it was nighttime and that meant it was time to sleep and he had to go to sleep. Then we went in after 2 minutes, didn't pick him up but just stood next to the crib and told him that he was ok, we loved him, but it was nighttime and he needed to go to sleep. Then we went in 5 minutes later, then 7, 7. I think the first night it took 17 minutes total before he fell asleep. The next night it took 12 or 15, and the intervals were longer (5,7, 10, 10). Then the next night we did 10, 15 etc. After we reached the 15 minute one the following nights we just kind of let him cry, but he rarely went more than 7 minutes.   I found that for our own sanity and also I think for the baby's ease of mind it helped to verbalize what we were going to do and what we were doing as the process went on. We did something similar for night weaning, we would go in and give him a sip of water from a sippy cup, tell him that mommy didn't have milk because it was night time out and time to sleep, and then leave.   Mine has always responded really well to CIO and so we stuck with that method. We do use a paci but have always used it, so will have to cross that bridge when we get to it (we're thinking of getting rid of it by two years) and like the other poster said I wouldn't recommend introducing it if you don't already use it -honestly if you don't use it by now your kid probably wont take it- but a lovie or stuffy might be good (just maybe make it one thats easy to procure extras of in case it gets lost?)"
breakingmom,3dvdar,msdebacle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:53:48 2015 UTC,"I sleep trained differently. I let my son co-sleep and nurse to sleep right before I gave birth to my second. My son is 15 months old, and the method I chose was ferber. It's all about routine. He gets fed at 6, bathed at 8, and bedtime at 9. He sleeps in his crib by himself, with stuffed animals (that he now holds onto) and a blanket. Right before we place him in his crib, we (so and I) take turns holding him, telling him how much we love, and that he has to sleep so we can play tomorrow, and he'll just hug and place his cute little head on our shoulders.   BUT LET ME TELL YOU, it wasn't all this easy. I actually had my dad help me. I used to get really pissed off, and I just couldn't. I couldn't be the parent I wanted to be. My dad helped transition him from my arms to crib in three days. In three days at 14 1/2 months, he was successfully transitioned into sleeping on his own. My dad would hold him and rock him to sleep, then gently place him in the crib. Then he started to place him in the crib when he was awake, and it just clicked.   Now, he does talk/play by himself, in his crib, but he's not screaming or crying.   It may be hard to transition your son, because he's only 9 months, may still need night feeding, if only to feel you. Don't rush it. If you live close to the grandparents, I recommend having them put him to bed, which may seem strange, but it worked for me. Worked really really well for me. Heck, the little tike is currently asleep in his crib, without fuss. I DON'T KNOW."
breakingmom,3dvdar,clairrific,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:09:28 2015 UTC,"Nap time is much harder to train than nighttimes since the kids just aren't that tired. And nighttime is tough to train if the baby isn't sleeping well (over tiredness is your enemy since it makes falling asleep harder). I did naps only after nighttimes were working (ie baby sleeping several hours without getting me up).   We did use binkies but they'd had them since infancy - I'm not sure whether it works to bring them in later.  If you haven't already, read a book on CIO so you are solid on what you are going to do in every situation and why. It will fail if you are inconsistent or give up after the first rough evening."

Why God couldn't they just both be identical good sleepers?!  At 6 1/2 months we decided to do CIO for bedtime only (they would only nap if they were laying on me until they were 8 months old). We have a very strict routine- we even read the same 2 books every night (oh god I'm so sick of Mr. Brown Can Moo). My girls never took a pacifier, so they have a lovey (small muslin blanket) and one of those wubanub pacifier stuffed animals to cuddle and chew on.   The first night, after 45 minutes of graduated extinction A fell asleep. But B continued crying for 3 fucking hours before I quit. Second night, 20 minutes and A was asleep. B still cried off and on for hours. 3rd night, A fell asleep pretty much immediately and hasn't really had any problems since unless she was sick or teething or something. She also wakes up between 0-2 times to eat, but goes back to sleep no problem. B on the other hand still sleeps with me and is up all the fucking time and just cries randomly for no reason or wants to play for an hour and a half. I haven't gotten the courage to try CIO again, I'm just hoping she just decides to start sleeping longer.   They both can now nap on their own 90% of the time, I just randomly decided one day to put them down drowsy but awake after nursing and the shit actually worked! Who knew!?

The first night he cried for 35 minutes. My husband and I turned the tv up louder, watched him on the video monitor and slept like the dead that night. The second night was 15 minutes and he was out; the third night he went to sleep, woke up 45 min later and cried for about 15 minutes. The week or so after that was under 5 min of crying/whining while laying on his stomach, bum in the air (his sleep position). After that, it stuck for naps and bedtime.   When he isn't feeling well (teething, cold, etc) we will go in and soothe him or rock him for a bit. There are some nights now that he wakes up and stands up in his crib, so we give him 5 minutes and he's usually back asleep by then. If not, it means he's hungry or he's pooped."
breakingmom,3dvdar,throwawayscatty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:45:16 2015 UTC,"Okay, short synopsis, you can pm for longer one if you want. We did ferber/cio at 4 months. I am the spineless one, hibs stayed strong, which was great. Night 1, took 20 mins with 2 checkins, night 2, 40 mins with 3? checkins, nights 3 and 4, out in 7 mins, 5th night, no crying at all. We have had back slides, but not nearly enough to regret it. Also worth noting, my LO is and has always been a fantastic sleeper. We did sleep training so that I wasn't the one nursing to sleep, waiting till she was in deep sleep and trying to transfer her to crib. My husband did most of the research since he was the one who was hell bent on sleep training when we did. Naps just kind of followed suit, maybe a week or two later. Our routine is dinner, bath, book if she's not too tired/fussy, boob, then bed. She still falls asleep nursing when I put her down, but she stirs when I transfer her to crib. I remember hearing that there are certain ages where cio might not be as effective, but what ages I don't know.   Certainly no judging here! Everybody needs to sleep well to maintain whatever slight shred of sanity we are hanging on to! Good luck!"
breakingmom,3dvdar,maybeitsapony,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:40:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply :-) I have a feeling I'm really going to miss the middle of the night nursing someday, sort of how you remember good things years later about a job you really hated at the time. I know he won't be small forever ...though he's getting less small by the day, and it's getting harder and harder to stealthily transfer is 20 pound sleeping butt into his crib!"
breakingmom,3dvdar,cloudsnapper,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:49:30 2015 UTC,"Not a problem! This topic of sleep training is just sooo controversial! In the end my philosophy is do what works for you and your family. Did I want to listen to my poor baby girl scream, of course not! But I had an amazingly supportive husband who listened to both of us cry that first night, and kept reassuring me that this needed to be done, especially after I spent 5 hours one night trying to successfully transfer her to the crib. He had ALL of our interests at heart. Good luck, mama!"
breakingmom,3dvdar,cloudsnapper,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:39:23 2015 UTC,Mine will take naps and go to sleep after fussing or crying a bit at almost six months. I honestly just got tired of bouncing her grouchy ass around one day when she was tired and put her down and walked out and she went to sleep. She wakes up and occasionally needs a paci or a butt change but I'm currently only feeding her twice between 9pm and 7am which has been great because it used to be every 2 hours. Sometimes when she's over tired it takes up to thirty minutes of waiting it out but that's not frequent. Every baby is different though and this is my first so I won't pretend to have any useful advice for you!
breakingmom,3dvdar,pipeen1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:01:23 2015 UTC,"I did ferber style cry it out and it worked pretty well. I only did nights, I nap with him on a mat. That's by choice, but also he likes to comfort nurse his whole nap and he stopped gaining weight a couple months ago. (10 months now, not worried cuz he's crawling all over the place but I want him to eat if he wants to.)  I tried to get him to do a transitional object, but he isn't into it."

breakingmom,3dv71e,Clasi,4,Sun Jul 19 20:05:42 2015 UTC,"First of all I'm very sorry about your mom. I feel you.  I get so overwhelmed and anxious when the house isn't picked up. I can't get any other work done until it's clean but I get so overwhelmed sometimes I dont know where to start. I can't imagine what it's like for you with the preschoolers and dogs.  I just have a baby, cats, and a husband.  I'm not sure if your looking for advice so stop reading of you aren't, but I would start with sitting down with your husband for a very serious talk about how much the mess is causing you stress and how he needs to really step it up and help out. Even after the talk he might still need reminders.  When my husband doesn't put something away or doesn't put his dishes in the dishwasher I stay calm and say something like, ""I just cleaned. Would you help me keep the house clean today by picking up after yourself?""  I try to phrase it as calmly as possible so he doesn't feel like he's being nagged and I don't start to get upset.  I only have a baby so I don't have kid experience but can you set up a reward system with them for cleaning?  As for tackling the cleaning in general, set small goals like one room a day. Decide what items truly represent your relationship with your mother and what items won't really be missed.  Also remember that a messy house is not the end of the world and it can and will be fixed. Take a step back, have a drink (if your into that) and you can do this!"

I tried this. All I got from his was ""well I did this, that, and this while you weren't even awake yet."" He used to do nothing, at all, around the house. Now he does maybe 3 loads of dishes and laundry a week. That helps. But it's no where near enough for us to get ahead on the mess that this place has become. He will help me really clean one room, and then he says ""wow, we did a great job. Let's sit down and do nothing for 3 days"" and then it gets bad again."
breakingmom,3dv71e,racf599,4,Sun Jul 19 23:24:21 2015 UTC,"do you have access to a storage area or could you rent a storage space? if so, you can try the nuclear option of bagging up everything that has been left where it doesn't belong and banishing it to the storage area. I did that once with my kids' toys. they wouldn't tidy up, I couldn't even see the floor in their room. it took several huge garbage bags but that room was tidy when I finished. took them nearly a year to earn back all their stuff."
breakingmom,3dv71e,elleandmia,2,Sun Jul 19 21:58:42 2015 UTC,I don't really have that option. We are low income and I don't have anywhere to take the stuff. Not to mention the fact that I don't have a car big enough to transport any significant amount of stuff.

I'm very house proud and my parents live close by so they drop in sometimes. Maybe before bed you can get everyone to pick up 5 things and put them where they belong. In 2nd grade I had an art teacher that would start a timer (usually a minute) and get us to pick up as many things off the floor as we could in that time and whoever got the most would get a sticker on our chart. Kids haven't got a clue of time so you just time until your satisfied. I'm pretty sure 'only 10 seconds left!' Was actually more like 30 seconds!   I'm sorry you're so stressed. I used to date someone whose mum was a horder and it made me sick to even think about going there. That's in the extreme but the feeling of being so overwhelmed about mess rings true.

My husband grew up in an almost-hoarder house. We stayed with his sister for a few months and it was the worse thing I have ever been though. So, he sees how our house is now, and comparing it to that, it's fine. But I lived in the opposite. I had an mom with something like OCD about cleaning, and nothing was ever good enough. He thinks I'm over-reacting, I think his standards are too low. And I don't know what to do from here. He thinks if things aren't moldy, or smelly, and there is a path, that it's clean enough. He's always telling me ""sit down, take a break, you're too stressed"" and then he will ""help"", but the result is one light load of dishes, and some laundry, and then he stops. I would have put tons of stuff in the dishwasher, and hand wash the big stuff, and get it put away. He thinks that's over kill."

My place is no where near clean but it's not anxiety inducing anymore. I'm not holding onto things that don't make me feel happy or provide some sort of usefulness."

My mother is the same way - she would scream at us if the stovetop wasn't clean enough, etc. Recently when I visited her home, my sister pointed out that she has been scrubbing her new cupboards so frequently the varnish is coming off. My home would make her freak the fuck out with how dirty it is, but compared to most people it is incredibly clean. Sometimes I still get anxious and have to scrub all the counters down.    I hope your husband gets on board with picking up after himself soon, and if not I say fuck it and start littering the house with wine bottles ;) - it's crazy how much money you'll have for wine when you don't need to buy cleaning supplies anymore!"
breakingmom,3dv71e,ria1328,2,Mon Jul 20 00:57:54 2015 UTC,"Nope. Not alone. My stepfather was the same way. It wasn't uncommon for him to tell my sister and I to clean our room and if it wasn't clean enough for him, he'd go in and rip shit out of the closet, rip clothes out of the dresser drawers, take his arm and just sweep everything--jewelry, makeup, contact lens cases, whatever--off the top of the dresser. He'd rip the sheets off the beds and then tell us we had to clean it up right this time or he'd do it again and again until we did it right.  I think it made me a little OCD about cleaning. I usually spend at least an hour every day, sometimes more, cleaning up. Over 4th of July weekend, I spent around eight hours that Saturday cleaning the entire house from top to bottom. It probably doesn't need that level of deep cleaning again right now but I'm kinda itching to do it because I feel like it's just not clean enough around here even though it probably is.  My hubs is the same way. After almost 17 yrs of marriage, I've given up. Plates and cups are gonna be everywhere because he can't be bothered to pick up after himself. He uses Qtips and leaves them all over the place. He takes receipts, etc from his work pants and leaves them wherever. He gets pissed at me when I try to put his shoes under the bed because I'm sick of tripping over those damn things. I learned a long time ago trying to get him to give a fuck is a lost cause."

One of the most frustrating things is the fact that over the course of the day, I'll notice about a zillion things that need attention around the house, but I don't even have three seconds to write them down on a to-do list, and then when I do get a bit of time wherein I could tackle something that would be on that list, I can't remember what the hell any of the things were.

I grew up poor more than not so I have this thing about finishing what's on your plate. Usually they can't get up from the table if they don't finish. This has caused a few... Meltdowns.

I wasn't in the mood to have the fight with her so I asked if she was sure and I said there would be nothing else to eat until snack time, at which point she would finish her lunch instead of something else. She said that was fine, I asked her to take one more bite and then she may be excused.   She took the bite. She finished her water. She asked to be excused and when I said yes she may, she broke down wailing.   No explanation. She couldn't tell me why she was having a fit.

As it is IVF is the only way we can ever have more kids, so whether I want to or not, we may be one and done simply because we literally can't afford anymore tries - it's such bullshit. Those two years of trying were literally the hardest times in our lives and any mention of someone else getting pregnant would set me off for days, so I can empathize.  It also doesn't help that a vast majority of people are literally incapable of dealing with infertility in a tactful manner. I lost two friends during our struggle because they were major assholes and just didn't get it. I'm so glad you're seeing a doctor soon, I really hope they can help find you some answers. Like another said, check out the infertility sub - there's some great ladies over there who are fantastic listeners."
breakingmom,3dt7cv,PeacefulTreeLand,9,Sun Jul 19 12:43:40 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you're going through this, but please understand that you already are a ""real"" mom. You're a real mom to your two step children. Real mom's aren't just biology; they're the ones who help with homework, who give advice as the children grow older and navigate confusing relationships, who are there for every bump and bruise - even if it's just to comfort, who attend plays and award ceremonies, and who encourage their kids to grow up to be better in every way they can.   You are a mom. (Even if you don't feel like it right now)"
breakingmom,3dt7cv,XBlueYoshiX,4,Sun Jul 19 13:47:43 2015 UTC,"Oh snap! What if one of the reason so many people have trouble relating to infertility because our society doesn't consider the term mom = biological children. Therefore when women like the OP express their grief over not being a mom, most people cannot relate to that at all because they already view the person as a mom. So it becomes one of those things where people look at the OP the same way that the OP views her family member who is infertility by choice. It is easy to then think OP is only not a mom because she choices to not be a mom. She has kids already, she is a mom.  If you think about it, our society is built on Mom's and the vast majority of them are not our biological mother. From the infant stage we enter daycare where other motherly women care for us, not our bio mom. We spend hours and years in school learning from other women, motherly women who teach us great lessons in life, again not our bio mom. After school our afternoons are spent with team mom's, coaches, daycare givers, again all who care for us like mothers...are you wearing sunscreen? Need to potty? Can I get you food? And again, most of the time they are not your bio mom.  So maybe it is the vocabulary....maybe mom is not the correct term, but the best one the OP has to use in her context of life.   I agree that OP is a mom and it will be a slap in the face to hear that and an even bigger one when she learns it on her own. So I guess the question I leave myself is how do women like me and you help support women like the OP? Also, what positive actions can we role model to help show them they are a mom?"
breakingmom,3dt7cv,PeacefulTreeLand,2,Sun Jul 19 16:41:45 2015 UTC,"Ummm just be there for them to bitch without judgement and just remind them how great they're doing with whatever kids are in their life?

And, OP, I hope I didn't inadvertently make things worse for you!"

Or worse comment was, ""to be honest, you are not missing much when they're newborn/babies"".   I want to slap those people to Pluto.

It got to the point I made an appointment and told him I don't care what it is we are getting this done !!!!! We did and they came out really cute.

breakingmom,3dt9w5,medievaleagle,2,Sun Jul 19 20:07:08 2015 UTC,Harry Potter erotica is probably one of the less creepy things on the internet.

At least the characters in Harry Potter are practically adults at the end of the series. :/

I am not clear from your post and various responses what your mental state actually is.  Of course, if you really feel like you need some professional intervention, going to talk to somebody about mental health services is for the best.  If you really do just need a break, you might be surprised how generously people respond if you really let them know the situation.  Of course I don't know your family, so YMMV.  There may also be some respite services in your town for situations like this, you'd have to do a little research to find out.  Good luck, I hope you find a way to get what you need."

If I am having a party or watching kids I don't want to tell other kids they can't play. I felt very lonely as a kid and my son is very sensitive, so I don't want to contribute to hurting kids feelings when it's the parents that suck.   With that said, when my son found out about the neighbor's party he was very hurt. He understood he wasn't invited and he was too embarrassed by that  to go over.   I have eventually got him to see if the new kid in the street (who just started moving in the other day)  was home. The kid was leaving, so my son sat on the sidewalk between our houses staring at the party. The parents throwing the party saw him and completely ignored him.

I was the kid who'd go over to their neighbors houses uninvited pretty frequently. I'm pretty sure I went over quite a few times without letting my parents know I was going. I know for sure I got up early one morning, put on a slip and a tutu, went across the street, and woke the neighbors at something like 6 am to show the my outfit. I'm pretty sure THEIR kids weren't even awake. Now that I'm an adult, I think everyone knew my parents drank and took pity on us kids, which it doesn't sound like that situation for you. Sigh.

I'd assume that she was fairly young, given who usually works in these types of places, so this might give her a small kick in the nits for future job performances. Or, she just really doesn't give a crap and loses the job. Either way, it's a good outcome for her and the company.   Definitely get in touch with management and explain how horribly disappointed you were (and your daughter's disappointment, too). Mention the party that your husband went to and how great it was- you went to them by word of mouth and now, unfortunately, can't recommend them after your experience. Don't be irate, and don't over exaggerate your daughter's disappointment- how you described it here is perfect. Make sure they really know that they sucked, and with the number of kids you had at the party, they can pretty much be guaranteed that the potential business is lost.

I always start them out with dry erase markers and pencils but some lose so many of mine that I tell them to borrow or go to the store.    My students need a pencil box, pencils and dry erase markers. I give them a new one at each semester. They are allowed to purchase and bring crayons or binders or pencil sharpeners with a catch. That's it. No rulers, scissors, glue, staplers, paper clips, calculators, or dry erase cleaner.   I provide: colored pencils, folders, paper, glue, rulers, scissors, pencils, dry erase markers and whiteboards, staplers, hole punches, erasers, and a pencil sharpener.   $75 times 20 kids= $1500 for school supplies for a class?

Antibiotics kill the stuff that keeps yeast in the body at low levels.  Some women get yeast infections when they take antibiotics.  If you've already been having yeast issues then you've done 3 rounds of antibiotics....  your body is a yeast playground right now.  Get some probiotics to go along with whatever the Dr perscribes.  There is some baby ones you can put the powder on your nipples before nursing to help the baby get probiotics and kill stuff on your boobs.  If you have a washer throw your bras in super hot and clean them.  Kill the bacteria living on your bras.  Hope it gets better."

Are you willing to sacrifice that time plus more each week to further your teaching goal and fix your crisis?
breakingmom,3ds6l2,elsies2,2,Sat Jul 18 23:48:04 2015 UTC,"Is this something you love, or is it something you think you ought to do?  Grad school is a bitch. If you don't love your subject it's probably not worth the pain. Even if you do love your subject, there will still be days when you're stressed and unhappy. This may be colored by the fact that I'm STEM and most of the other grad students I know are also STEM, but I don't think any graduate level program is easy no matter the subject.  That said, it is still doable with a kid. I've known a number of women who have done it and I'm working on finishing my thesis myself. It's a hell of a lot easier if you have support though. Does your SO support the idea of you going back to school, and what do your finances look like? Some programs you can have tution waived in return for TAing classes and you even get a small stipend, but it may still be a struggle to make ends meet. You could do it single too, but it's going to be that much harder.   I would recommend sitting down with you SO, looking at programs you're interested in, finding out how much you'll have to spend (include some sort of daycare as well - you will not be able to get all your classwork done when the kid is sleeping, particularly if you have to grade undergrads' work as well. I find even hearing the kid in the other room while someone else watches him is distracting), and seeing if it works for you. If money is going to be tight it will make it that much more stressful. You're also going to need to be honest with yourself about your study habits and academic ability. Bad study habits will fuck you over in grad school even without kids. I've also known a few people who have started graduate programs but whe simply weren't academic enough to get the material. Notice I didn't say they were stupid; their skills were just elsewhere.  My kid is younger than yours and I've even known women who had a kid while in a PhD program and still completed. It's hard but really rewarding. Given all the variables I can't honestly say if you should go for it, wait, or do something else entirely. If you have any questions I can tell you more of my experiances though."

Teaching seems like a low-time requirement, but the truth is that if you are doing it right, you are looking at probably 50+ hours a week during the school year. Grading, parent contact, lesson plans, PD, etc will all suck up a lot of time - especially your first few years. And the pay usually sucks dead bunnies.  Grad school is def doable - the more supportive your partner, the easier it will be.... But it still won't be easy.  I just finished my MA in educational administration while teaching full time.

breakingmom,3drmp7,throwawayscatty,11,Sat Jul 18 20:05:59 2015 UTC,"Now is the time to start teaching 'Gentle Pets'. Every time she touches the cat, tell her in a firm voice 'Gentle' or 'We pet the kitty gently' and then hold her hand with yours so that her palm is open (ish, if it's in a fist its ok) and demonstrate how she is to pet the kitty. This will take LOTS of repetition but eventually it will start to sink in. When she grabs the cat's tail, you want to remover her hand from it which should be easy right now but will get harder as her grip gets stronger. I have to sometimes grab my sons wrist and press my thumb into the base of his palm or wrist tendons to break his grasp but it doesn't hurt just helps to open the grip. Then repeat 'We don't pull the cat's tail, we pet her gently' and demonstrate what to do like before. Soon she might understand 'Gentle pets' and when you say it she might start doing it. But it's a pretty long road, my kid is 16 months and he gets it about 60-70% of the time, but I know he understands gentle now as he looks at me sometimes when I say it and does it correctly. He still grabs the tail, which the damn cat facilitates by shoving her ass in his face every chance she gets, and now he's starting to 'pet' her on the face so thats another thing we have to work on.   Anyway, until she starts to get it just try and run interference and keep them supervised. The cat might get your kid with her claws, mine has gotten my kid a few times but a lot less now than when he first discovered that it was fun to antagonize the furry thing."

Never did work for my kid..the only thing that he respected/listened to was her swatting him with her claws pulled in. The only time she's ever scratched him intentionally was when he was in her face while she was eating once. She swatted him, scratching his nose and she hissed at him. He never did it again.  Actually, until very recently, she didn't want anything to do with him and wouldn't go near him if she didn't have to.

Kid might get a scratch or two first but that'll teach the kid not to annoy the cat quicker than saying no will.  Sounds like your cat is being pretty tolerant. Just make sure the cat has places it can easily escape to.  I have 2 dogs and a cat plus 5yr old twins and a 2.5 yr old. The animals have all been ridiculously good with the kids and they've all survived relatively unscathed so far. Making sure the animals had an escape route was pretty much all we did.

However, my opinion was two fold, if the cat was really pissed off it'll move, and a swat with a paw wouldn't scar  her for life. Both of my cats, as well as the other cats in our lives have their claws.  She's been scratched a few times... and I'm fine with it.  It was barely enough to leave a red mark--- and she learned to not try and bite the cats feet.    I'm a firm believer in letting my kids experience everything... skinned knees and scratches are part of life.  Al of that being said, I'm the first one to pull the cat away if 2.0 gets too aggressive and set them both in their corners.   Just my .02 cents. :)"
breakingmom,3drmp7,neuchmarie,2,Sat Jul 18 20:57:28 2015 UTC,"You're right--she is way too young to effectively train at this point.  We don't have a cat, but a very patient dog who put up with our child (doing less, actually--just stomping around and occasional hits) until one day she didn't put up with it any more.  My then 15-month old got a nice bite between the eyes, and they've been seperated with very limited, supervised interactions since then (daughter is now 3).  Our vet was so helpful to us during this ordeal, because so many people will just tell you to get rid of the pet, but our dr explained to us (verrrrry patiently) about the actual dynamics at play here and how to manage them if we want to keep the dog.    He told us how it's really unfair to both the child and the pet to allow lines to be crossed.  It's also not a realistic expectation on a child to know right from wrong (with regards to animals) until they are truly at a trainable age--he stated he believed it to be at minimum 4 years old.  Yes, let them interact--when you are holding the animal you can teach gentle touches, petting, avoid the head/face, etc.  but never allow them to be with each other when you aren't present (and by present I mean able to drop everything and intervene/be RIGHT THERE.).  Just think-every time an aggressive behavior occurs, it sets and resets as normal into the minds of both the pet and the child.  So, if there are 10 pinches, that 1 gentle petting session isn't really damming the flood, right?    Another thing to remember is that cats don't F around when they decide to strike back.  Yes, a swat might ""hit home"" for your daughter, but it's not likely to stick being that she's less than 1 year old and it may result in her being traumatized/ becoming afraid of the cat.  What's more likely is that your daughter might get really hurt, and you will blame your cat and/or re-home him or put him down.  It literally happens all the time and it's utterly heartbreaking.  The worst part of the whole scenario is that it'is so preventable and pretty much the parents' fault.  Yes--it's harsh, but at the end of the day we have to be the ones to keep things safe (for both-kid and pet).  Yes, it's unfair.  It's just the way it is.  So, either keep them seperated until your daughter can learn to be gentle consistently, or give them seperate spaces to relax in.    On a side note, I'm sorry for you because I know how stressful this situation feels!!!"

A former mom friend of mine came over and her 9 month old was crawing up on our female doberman, going for her ear. My dog seemed cool with it. But what the fuck! My dog could end your baby and it won't be anyone's fault but the hers for letting it happen.  Sure people say, oh our dogs are great and they don't mind the pulling and crawling. Okay well. Until they fucking do.  I know of a video online where a baby is playing with a dog, pulling on it, and the dog looks totally cool for the first 5 seconds and you see it tense up and it snaps at the baby's face.   For me with the new baby on the way she will be taught right away to leave the dobies alone. They are wonderful dogs, and I trust them, but you never know what could happen.

The other cat is pretty good at staying out of her way, but at 2 my daughter also has figured out that Oscar is ok with hugs but Thea is not.  Both cats have swatted her with claws in many times.

She loved to grab the cats hair and tail, and she would pull our hair or pinch our skin. Babies just don't realize these things hurt. I'm afraid that she'll get around another little kid and pinch them.   Anytime she gets rough I just say ""No no, gentle!"" and I take her hand and stroke the cat/my hair/my husband, then I use my hand to stroke her arm, just repeating ""gentle"" very purposefully.   I didn't think it was working until last Sunday at church, my husband was holding her and we were singing and she kept reaching out to stroke my shoulder. She never does that, always grabs and pinches. She's 13 months old. I wasn't even super consistent with it.   Also, kitties can usually get away if they don't like what's happening. They usually only scratch when cornered."
breakingmom,3drmp7,2ndstartotheright,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:42:25 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly support you letting the cat reasonably defend itself. It's the natural consequence of pissing an animal off that it will either strike back or move away. As long as your cat's good about claws-in and baby isn't likely to get a scratched cornea, I say that's really the best tack to take.   My 15 month old doesn't talk a ton yet, so if his 2.5 year old brother hits or pushes or otherwise bullies him, I don't intervene when he hits (or more often bites) in retaliation. I coach them both after the fact on why what happened happened and how to more peacefully resolve conflict, but I think most of that is lost on them for now and knowing that baby bro will probably bite is a way better deterrent for hitting than me telling big bro to ""be gentle."""
breakingmom,3drmp7,himit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:50:03 2015 UTC,"I started the 'gentle' thing with an open hand at five months, as soon as kiddo noticed the cat was around, and it worked. Ridiculously well. She's now 15 months and I never have to worry about her pulling on his fur or tail (eye gouging and hitting is another matter, but him and his claws have now taught her sufficiently well -.-).  I know with toddlers you're supposed to teach them what to do instead of just saying no, so I guess that's why this worked. Keep in mind that I thought it was a crock of shit at the start.  For the rest... Ugh. I sort of believe that hurting = getting hurt back, but she's not deliberately hurting me. The pinching I used to let slide but now I remove her hands has soon as she starts and say gentle, and it's starting to sink in. The hair pulling she doesn't do often but I try and keep my hair out of her reach, when she does pull I try not to react and remove it from her grasp."
breakingmom,3drmp7,mhayu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:09:39 2015 UTC,Went thru this with our dog at around the same age. Time to teach gentle pet and as soon as she starts to get rough we remove the dog. We have times when she is wailing in front of the door wanting to get to the dog.
breakingmom,3drmp7,HurrGurr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:13:39 2015 UTC,My stormpooper was the same. We did the gentle petting thing by correlating the petting motion with the cooing/sighing sound (aaAaah?) and enforcing that that was the only appropriate way to touch anyone.   No pinching/biting/punching/kicking! Only aaAaah to mommy  His first word was 'aaAaah cat' and he just recently noticed we have a dog too.  Though we did have to shave his head cause he was tearing out his own hair in clumps and when he's sleeping he will try to rip out my/teddybears/daddies hair if he's within grabbing distance

breakingmom,3dqign,XBlueYoshiX,35,Sat Jul 18 13:53:13 2015 UTC,"She's actually not wrong.    There are now a multitude of studies that show that mothers and babies should be together, skin to skin (baby naked, not wrapped in a blanket) immediately after birth, as well as later. The baby is happier, the baby’s temperature is more stable and more normal, the baby’s heart and breathing rates are more stable and more normal, and the baby’s blood sugar is more elevated.    source."
breakingmom,3dqign,pandabelle,8,Sat Jul 18 14:30:17 2015 UTC,"Last week we were in the hospital with my newborn for same issues and the doctors told me to do skin to skin too, that it was the best thing for her next to the bilirubin lights. So during feedings we did skin to skin with the light blanket."
breakingmom,3dqign,MustacheBus,3,Sat Jul 18 15:29:25 2015 UTC,That's kind of cool.
breakingmom,3dqign,Flitterbee,3,Sat Jul 18 17:40:05 2015 UTC,"That's interesting! But the baby was pictured in a biliblanket (for jaundice), that keeps the baby warm as it gives whatever sunlight has that helps reduce jaundice. My son had the blanket at home the first weekend he was born because of jaundice sp I know how warm that thing gets.  It was honestly more my pet peeve about the unsolicited medical advice from someone who was not a doctor in any way."
breakingmom,3dqign,pandabelle,6,Sat Jul 18 17:58:00 2015 UTC,"Neither of mine had jaundice so I don't have first hand experience with it, but what I've heard (from midwives) is that the best treatment for it is the lights (and blanket, I'm assuming) and as much colostrum/breast milk as baby will accept. And skin to skin in general helps baby acclimate to life on the outside."
breakingmom,3dqign,because__science,0,Sat Jul 18 18:11:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah the light from the biliblanket helps a lot. My first was awful at breastfeeding when it was just colostrum so we had to supplement and do the biliblanket to help with his jaundice. Once my milk came in and regulated (aka didn't try to drown him every feeding), his jaundice went away quickly."
breakingmom,3dqign,sweetscgirl9,2,Sat Jul 18 18:47:17 2015 UTC,"Does the blanket different than the bed? We had the at-home bilibed and it didn't get hot at all. In fact, we had to keep track of baby's temp every time we took him out to feed/change to make sure he wasn't too cold and we were advised to use blankets on top of it if his temp was getting low.    It uses light therapy, not sun/heat. There's no reason the blanket should get that hot."
breakingmom,3dqign,suagrupp,0,Sat Jul 18 19:10:20 2015 UTC,"Ours kept our son quite warm. I don't know if the light thing at the hospital is different. We were told to use a blanket with ours too, but our son stayed warm in that thing."
breakingmom,3dqign,WWLadyDeadpool,8,Sat Jul 18 19:14:11 2015 UTC,"The only logic I could think of (of than encouraging feeding) is that your child stays fairly warm while you are holding them.  The warmer they are, the less they shiver, the less calories they are burning, so it would help regulate.  That seems like a big leap though."
breakingmom,3dqign,brokenbaristamom,4,Sat Jul 18 14:12:46 2015 UTC,"That is exactly how it works. They are used to being kept warm from being inside their mother - they've never had to generate their own heat before. When they are skin-to-skin, they don't have to work as hard to maintain a good temperature, and the mother's breasts will cool down or warm up (like the perfect thermostat) to keep the baby at a good temperature. The baby uses less energy on heating, and all the milk it drinks is used for more important things."
breakingmom,3dqign,hadesarrow,9,Sat Jul 18 18:05:17 2015 UTC,"It might, but since she's in the hospital, I'd say the 50 doctors and nurses would know the best treatment.  People on the Internet who think they are smarter than doctors are a huge pet peeve of mine."

breakingmom,3doysm,TheOneYouFeed,6,Sat Jul 18 03:06:59 2015 UTC,"Hey. I commented when the accident first happened, and I've been following your story since then. I lost a long term boyfriend when I was in my early 20s. We weren't married, no kids. So not the same, and I absolutely know it. But kind of similar.  Right after my boyfriend died, my dad said something to me that is probably the truest thing about mourning that I've ever heard: you are always going to mourn this loss, but with time, your grief will become less relevant to your daily life.   It is so true, Misty. It takes a long time, but over time the ache becomes less constant. Whole days will go by when you forget to be sad. I'm 10 years out now. There are still days I miss him. I'm fearful of something happening to my husband or my son - fearful in ways I think most normal people don't understand. But I'm also pretty healed, pretty whole. And I'm in a place now where I remember my boyfriend with fondness and love and with almost no pain. Almost.   Hang in there, love. Don't rush another relationship. You don't want to be with anyone who wants to be with you right now. Focus on yourself and your kids and building your new life, just the four of you, at least for a little while.   Let me know if you want to talk. I'm almost always around."

I pumped and got ~20mL for him (which is pretty good) and he couldn't physically finish even that in 3 hours. But no, we had to forcefeed formula, and sign this bullshit form that is a lie becase terrible parents and hypocritical lactivism.  This time I'm not signing the form if it's the same bullshit and bringing my own formula if I have to. (Not BFing because the hormones nearly drove me to kill my son.)"

So when my son was born, the nurse went through the whole ""never shake a baby"" shpeal,  and I responded with: ""Yeah, actually I have a question about that...""  The LOOK on her face.

breakingmom,3dp2vy,Teriyaki_Pterodactyl,21,Sat Jul 18 02:24:13 2015 UTC,"Ok, moms of infants, listen up.   You gotta teach your baby ""Boom!""  At the first sign of your baby pulling up to a standing position on their own, teach them this little game. Sit down on the floor with baby facing you. Lift baby up to a standing position, holding her under her arms. Then, still supporting baby, quickly bring her to a sitting position, as though she's falling on her diapered butt, and say (in your best, high-pitched cutesy mom voice) Boom! Bring her back to standing and then back down again saying Boom! each time (it helps if you gasp a little right before you say it, to build anticipation). After you do this a few times and get a few giggles and smiles, your kid will anticipate the ""boom"" and automatically bend his legs and drop to a seated position. That's when you move the game to the pack n play or crib. Have him stand at the edge by the rail, then plop him on his butt, saying Boom!   Why is this a mom hack? Because when the little tit-muncher learns how to pull up, she will want to practice her new skill All. The. Time. Especially during nighttime and nap time, when the crib offers prime pull-up space. And your ankle-biter is going to get stuck standing up and not know how to get back down. And she'll cry, and scream, and wail. And you'll go put her back down and she'll pull right back up two seconds later. Just let her figure it out, you say? Well, 15 minutes later, when you just can't take the crying, you will go find your little boob-sucker hanging like her life depends on it, white knuckles gleaming, from the edge of the rail, terrified to let go and drop 3 inches.   The very first time this happens, gently push her to her butt and say Boom! (maybe a few more times if you've got a stubborn one) and from then on your kid will know how to drop to their padded little tush. It will save you weeks of wrecked naps and nights.   Seriously. Play Boom!"

So, as a FTM way back then, when I started putting my baby in his own room I thought... man its quiet in here... that would freak me out if I was little.  So I started playing that CD.     Kid listened to that CD for years.  He recently passed it down to his baby brother, who started sleeping in his own room at 8 months and is now the proud owner of the sleep CD. Works like a charm, put the kid in the crib, turn on the CD asleep before the first song is over.  He is brain washed.

There's no nice way to say that after three days, you will want to lose your fucking mind, sell all your shit, and move to a remote island all by yourself. Or that you'd settle for just 20 minutes of crying and not an hour. Or that if everyone doesn't shut the fuck up, you'll probably just cry too.  Teething and sleep regression are terrible. It feels like it always comes at the same time, to add insult to injury. BigO always, always got like four teeth at once. Sure, we were done with teeth by a 1.5 years but from 3 months on, we were in varying degrees of teething all. the. time. And there's nothing for it but to try and give them relief especially at night. My pediatrician has always maintained that the fuckers pop through at night and I don't even care if it's true, it FEELS true. At least, it's when I'm the most emotionally invested in whether or not we are all sleeping.  You aren't crazy. You aren't alone. You are tired and at your limit with the shrill sound of little people cries. For one night are you able to get out of the house or go to a quiet part of the house during the routine? Just having that moment of silence that's otherwise high stress may work wonders for you. For little one, something to ease the pain (whatever works for your family) might help as well."

The only way I can tell my son is teething is when his sleep suddenly goes to shit and he's not obviously sick. Sure enough a few days later a tooth will pop through. We ended up resorting to painkillers too. I hate to unnecessarily medicate, but he's too little to tell us what's wrong and we all need to sleep sometime."
breakingmom,3dodnj,bumblebeerose,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:14:36 2015 UTC,I know. I worry about giving meds but sometimes I don't know what else to do. Maybe I should try water next time. Sometimes so think that the meds act like a distraction and he calms down because he is forced to stop crying for 10 seconds.
breakingmom,3dodnj,patientish,3,Sun Jul 19 12:14:28 2015 UTC,"Oh I feel your pain. I'm currently sleep training my 1 year old with the Cry It Out method, which means: put him in his bed, shut the door and just wait. The maniac cried, stood and bounced for 4 hours straight. Two days in a row. Soooo effing stressful. However, the third day he ACTUALLY did 2 naps, something he refused before. So there is progression. And you'll have progression too. Count to 100 momma, and have a glass of wine. Or two. Or three. Or maybe four."

My ex husband went to jail and I divorced him because 1 marring him was a mistake. 2 I was at the time a correctional officer myself and the crippling embarrassment of having to deal with telling the warden and filling out the paper work to ensure he was never placed at my unit still curls my toes 8 years later. 3 I didn't really like him anyway because he never had a job, had mental issues and I wasn't going to waste 5 years waiting on him.

breakingmom,3dpj66,orangething,2,Sat Jul 18 12:28:54 2015 UTC,"I'm going to piggyback on this real quick. I recently started Amazon MTurk. Within about a week (roughly 2.5 hours of work) I had earned $23. That's the quickest I've ever made that amount of money on online work. If you sign up, make sure you sort the hits by highest payout and stuff you're qualified for. Also, keep in mind you can only use it towards stuff off Amazon. It's also really nice because once your reward has been approved, payout is almost instant, and there's no minimum payout.  Swagbucks is also nice; when I was really into it, I could make about 500-700 points a day. However, once you pick your reward (I usually  did the $5 amazon gift cards), it takes about a week to process. Also keep in mind that 500-700 points was about 5-6 hours of work, and 100 points=$1."

You DO have to pay taxes if you make over a certain amount ($400 I believe) so be sure to save some back for self employment taxes at the end of the year.  There are tons of scripts you can download to help you sort the hits better and that takes a minute to figure out. Once you do that, you are pretty solid. Right now I'm working to get 1,000 hits approved so I can do some better compensated options (so far for a little effort, I've made about $5.00 while trying to just figure out the system).   The advice above about Swagbucks is spot on. I tend to make a little less per day because I'm not as invested, but I use it for the occasional amazon gift card. We use Amazon for most purchases, though, so it may not appeal to you. I tend to get the video apps and let those play on my phone while I turk for mindless Swagbucks. It does max out per day though."

What worked really well for us was doing her usual bedtime routine (bath, jammies, nursing, book) and then instead of putting her in her crib, we put her in the car seat, so she was all ready to sleep. I took her out and changed her and nursed her whenever we stopped, which made her more comfortable and happier to go back to sleep quickly. And bring new and exciting toys for after baby wakes up--ours was so ready to be out of the car, but we still had two hours to go, so I could keep passing back new toys that kept her amused for 15 minutes or so, and then when she got sick of that one I could give her a new one. :) Good luck with your trip!!"

Not that there's anything wrong with that, and yeah I probably should've been doing that this whole time   I ain't the best wife but my husband isn't going to cheat on me, which, lets be honest, is what he has done.  I see that you are adamant about not leaving him, and I am sure you have your reasons, (I am going to assume is for security and family reasons, kids etc.) and I am not going to try to convince you otherwise because I can see that you are set in that.  But he has done this a few times now, even when he gets caught he does not care.    So as far as I see it you have two choices:   You need to start not being bothered by this behavior, or basically look the other way.  I know that sounds like shitty advice, but he is not going to stop doing this, thats pretty clear.  So you can either be super crushed and upset every time he does it or you can just stop looking for it, and turn a blind eye when you think it might be happening. You could just up and leave like everyone else says.  He is not going to change, he will continue to do this and he will eventually cheat physically.     The decision that you need to make here is what are you willing to put up with?  Are you willing to put up with the cheating and flirting and lying in exchange for a marriage, and kids and a sense of security?  OR are you not willing to put up with that, are you not willing to sacrifice your happiness for his?     I think in either of these scenarios you need to seek counseling, NOT couples counseling because I don't think that is going to work for him, I think you need to seek your own counseling so that you can work through what it is that you really want and and NEED in YOUR life and your childrens lives."

breakingmom,3do7k0,auroraskies,5,Fri Jul 17 22:13:08 2015 UTC,"I wanted to respond to your post, because I understand what you are going through and have a different perspective than what has been offered so far. I am using a throw away because obviously this is very personal and sensitive information.   I have been through a similar situation with my husband. We have been together for 10 years, and had our first child in March. We are extremely compatible, he supports my ambitions (I am currently pursuing my PhD), and we get along 99% of the time. The only thing I’ve ever considered leaving him over is online infidelity.   Early on in our relationship, I was on my husband’s computer and found some nudes that had obviously been sent to him. This sent me down the rabbit hole of snooping and I found that he regularly chatted with a handful of women. During these early days, he had such shame associated with the behavior that when I would confront him about it he would totally shut down and refuse to discuss it. After discussing the issue two or three times over a two year period, I made it clear that if the behavior continued I would leave him. This stopped the behavior for quite a few years.   Then one day last year when I was very pregnant, I was on my husband’s computer and saw that he was a member of an online role playing community. I felt totally devastated. I felt like I had made it very clear how the behavior made me feel, but he just didn’t care that he made me feel like shit.   Over the next six months, we again fell into a cycle of me snooping followed by him apologizing but doing nothing to change his behavior. Finally, when my baby was 2 months old I decided we had to face the issue head on. I was already feeling shitty about how much my body had changed from pregnancy, and every time I found more evidence of online infidelity my self-esteem took another hit. I wasn’t prepared to break up my sweet little family over the issue, but I could feel it chipping away at the foundation of our marriage.   I wasn’t sure how to deal with the issue. One thing that had always been difficult was that I wasn’t sure how I was supposed to feel about it. I knew how I would feel about physical infidelity (I would leave in a second) and I knew how I felt about porn (really don’t give a fuck), but this was somewhere in between, and I had never known someone else who had dealt with this problem. I definitely believe that monogamous relationships require a certain level of personal fantasy to retain the sexual spark, but I wasn’t sure how this behavior fit into that framework. I knew my husband justified the behavior by categorizing it as fantasy, but I also knew that it made me feel a lot worse than him just looking at porn.   I wasn’t sure how to quite approach the issue. I was prepared to go to counseling, if necessary, but clearly preferred to save money if possible. So I started looking online. The first thing I realized is this is an incredibly common issue. Knowing that I was not alone immediately made me feel a little better. The resources I was finding did not help though. Most of what I was finding had a Christian viewpoint (I am agnostic at best) and felt totally sex negative. They also offered totally impractical advice, like getting rid of the internet all together.   So, like a true academic, I turned to the literature. I found a paper that really helped enlighten the issue for me (I’ll include the link at the end of the post). I ended up going through it and making notes at every point that sparked my interest. Then I asked my husband to do the same and scheduled an open night later in the week to talk about it. The paper was great because it really helped us understand each other’s point of view.   For the first time ever, we had an open and honest conversation about the behavior. It wasn’t just me yelling at him and issuing ultimatums I clearly wasn’t willing to follow through on. I asked him about his motives, I clearly laid out how the behavior made me feel, and for the first time ever, I laid out my boundaries. I made it very clear exactly what behavior made me uncomfortable and what behavior I was okay with.   Since that conversation, I have felt a million times better about things. Clearly, I cannot guarantee that it will never be an issue in our relationship again, but I know I no longer have that sinking feeling in my gut every time he is alone with his computer. Also, I know your relationship may not be comparable. We had a pretty solid relationship except for this one issue and were able to honestly communicate about the problem. I just wanted to share the experience, because I know I felt so alone when I was going through something similar. I hope this will help. I also wish for the very best for you regardless of how the situation plays out.   Here is the paper I was talking about: http://english112ubc.pbworks.com/f/Online%20Infidelity%20in%20Internet%20Chatrooms%20An%20Ethnographic%20Exploration.pdf"

breakingmom,3dpvn2,MakZgirl,17,Sat Jul 18 07:55:18 2015 UTC,"To me, it's not as much 'evil mother' than a statement of how our society ignores mental illness, how hard it is for people to get help and if you have no money or insurance,  you're doomed and nobody wants to help you.  What she did was absolutely awful, I'm not minimizing that at all. I just have to believe that a mentally healthy person would never have done this and that perhaps if she was able to get the help she needed, those children would not have suffered a horrific end of their lives."
breakingmom,3dpvn2,pipeen1,5,Sat Jul 18 11:47:02 2015 UTC,"100% agree!  I did my thesis on Andrea Yates and it was heartbreaking to learn that she really was a good mother who loved her kids so much.   But she was unable, for a myriad of reasons, to effectively treat her mental illness.  Situations like this make me hurt for everyone involved."
breakingmom,3dpvn2,bonkerbear,3,Sat Jul 18 16:19:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with mental illness not being assessed as necessary in our society and that being a huge issue that leads to far too many tragedies. That said, with her being allowed to plead guilty, I'm almost positive  the courts would have had to do some sort of psycological vetting to verify that she was sane to do so which makes me think that in this disgusting, terrible situation mental illness may not have played a role. Side note, I'm not a psychologist nor an expert on the court system so I may be completely wrong in my assumption.   End all be all, this situation is mind numbing and painful and the suffering of those kids breaks my heart and I'm happy to remember the mothers I know here and in life who are true examples of motherhood."

Even if they are, they're still jailed with minimum or no therapy. If they're lucky, they're given meds.  I'm not saying she doesn't deserve jail (b/c obviously I don't know her or the case) but working in the legal system (not as a lawyer) i see often where mentally ill people are jailed in regular jail vs a hospital (which doesn't always help them anyway. America is pretty bad with mental health)  The number of mentally ill people in regular prison/jail would blow your mind. I  think I'm allowed to link this article, if not mods, I can remove it.

He would prescribe them if I want them, but he doesn't like to when pregnant. (I'm 100% with him, as I don't have history of bipolar or something that I need normal meds for).  Anyway, my point is push a little if they don't seem responsive. It is true our hormones are crazy right now, but we don't have to feel nuts. What state/country are you in? One of us may be able to find you a hotline number to talk to for free.  EDIT: Also don't feel bad if you do want or need meds! I am down to under 3 months and at birth may be like ""pump in the meds!"" I know some of the contributing factors of my PND so it kinda helps me to know it isn't all out of the blue."

I assumed since he started off by calling himself a bad uncle he had some shame. He sounds like kind if a dick. If it were me, I'd tell him to go fuck himself if something similar happens again, but I don't have a real brother, so I'm probably underestimating the drama."

My sister had her husband change the breaks on her car and then she took it in to NTB for an oil change. When she came back a few hours later they tried to tell her that her breaks were bad and that she needed new pads put on and that they wouldn't let her have her keys and leave until she paid for new breaks because her car was unsafe to drive because her pads were basically gone. They literally stole her new break pads and tried to sell them back to her. She had to pull out her receipt where she had just bought new break pads and threaten to call the cops before they would let her leave, but since she couldn't ""prove"" that she had the new pads put on, she couldn't prove that they had stolen her break pads, so she had to drive to a different garage (less than 5 minutes away) on the shitty breaks they had put on her car and get her breaks done again, too!

The night he came home he slept on the couch (came in at 3 am, didn't want to wake me) and so in the morning I plopped our daughter in front of the couch to play as I got breakfast ready. A few minutes later he starts yelling for me to go into the living room since she was taking her first steps. It was exactly why I didn't tell him or anyone else that she was walking. He got to feel the same emotions I did when she actually first started. Later on in the day I told him she'd been walking for over a week. At first he was mad that I didn't tell him but then he realized he wouldn't have felt the same had I told him before hand.

breakingmom,3dnvfi,sleepsonrocks,2,Fri Jul 17 21:19:23 2015 UTC,"We just did this with our kids. 8 hours each way (which turned into ~10) and I thought I was being clever and smart to drive overnight. My boy (2.5yo) slept most of the way; my girl (1.5yo) screamed most of the way. It was a nightmare. The drive back home we left in the morning and said fuck it, If they sleep, fine, but hopefully they won't scream. She did much better day driving.   I hope your trip goes well! Good luck!"

Sometimes we go for walks but that's hard with the baby. We visit family a lot and they have a lot of stuff to do there,  4 wheelers, sand mountains, 36 acres to explore. I live in a very rural area and there aren't many free activities so I guess that's my excuse? My kids are 6, 4, 2, and 5 months and I'm a stay at home mom."

For most people what I'm about to type is way overboard and neurotic.  I fully realize that.    My schedule is typically: Mon:  Story Time in AM at the Library Tues:  Children's Museum and Farmers Market Wed:  Little Gym type place (its a physical therapy studio that has a play area) Thurs:  Splash Pad/Outdoor Water Play or Sensory Time at a local place called Baby Earth Fri: Lunch Date with Daddy  (I don't nanny on Fri) and Sign Lang class  I occasionally try new places on the weekends (zoo, aquarium, etc).  We also go on walks, go to Whole Foods, etc.  I have a daily schedule too but posting that just seems like admitting that I have a problem with making sure there is structure.   I do try to be flexible so if kiddos aren't feeling up to something or weather is bad, etc I just keep a list of back up stuff (bouncy place, toy store with play area at back) that we can do."

Look into Waldorf to get some ideas, but there are some very intense, Type A, things you can do at home. Things like: Baking Day- even at age 1, can toss things in, watch you and enjoy the tasty treat. Nature Walks - this starts in your neighborhood and local parks. Find common items to your area, take a photo and put together some 'scavenger hunt' like cards. She carries the card and on a hunt you go. This expands to a nature book, coloring and drawing as she ages. Craft Day - i don't mean everyday art, I mean a big craft production. Only true super moms can pull this off, I am so not one of them.  A Garden - even a small one of a few pots, it is a task that requires everyday attention. Get hardy simple plants and a 1 yr old can poke at it and help you water and care.  hope some of those ideas help break up the sitting around the living room :)"

My son (the 4 year old)does swimming on Saturdays with his dad.

Kiddo is 14 months.    On weekends, we're fairly good about doing something at least one day. After swim lessons ended, we started trying to go to the splash park regularly to make up for the half hour of water time. We have a zoo membership but haven't gone in a few months - we've been out of town the past few weekends.

Other than that we just go to playgrounds and play in the backyard and sometimes venture out to the outdoor pool downtown.

They make the liquid ones for little ones. They are already lubricated at the top of the plastic. When my daughter was a year or younger, I usually gave her about a 1/4 to 1/3 of the bulb.

breakingmom,3djps2,dietotaku,8,Fri Jul 17 00:19:46 2015 UTC,Scary!!! My husband's truck did the same fucking thing. I fucking hate auto locking features. I asked her to open the door for me but she said she didn't know how to. Thankfully I had the spare key in my handbag zipped area. After that I taught my 4 year old how to unlock the door and open it. She knows not to do it randomly and only opens the door when I get out of the car. She's very proud to know how to do it and I have peace of mind now she won't be trapped Obv won't work with very young children.
breakingmom,3djps2,Kitsunefyre,22,Thu Jul 16 21:36:46 2015 UTC,"I thought of doing this exact thing. I don't know if she can reach the handles though (she's really tiny). I'll have to check.  Is your husband's truck a Ford?  The thing is, I would imagine you have to hit the lock button before auto starting it so someone can't just get in the car and steal it.   But you still have to start the car to drive it. Someone couldn't just hop into it when it's been auto started it and drive it away. The key has to be inside the car and you have to push the start button again to drive it.   So in reality, that was a shitty design feature.  The car has a pin code on the driver side door, but it's some random number that my husband never changed. It might as well be a randomly generated wifi password. My husband asked me, ""Why didn't you just get the password off of your phone or call me for it?"" My phone was in the car.  I told him last night it needs to be changed to something I can easily remember. I gave him out daughter's birthdate and he asked me, ""What is the significance of that number? How are you going to remember that?  Jesus.Fucking.Christ.  I'm surrounded by assholes."

We were in our drive way and I also locked myself and my 3 year old out of the house. Spare key was in the house, cell in the car. We lived in the county and we had no neighbors for half a mile. I was terrified to leave him to walk to a house. First I tried breaking the back door in. Damaged the hell out of the door frame but the door wouldn't budge. I was pacing around the house, debating if I should chuck a brick through a window when it occurred to me I hadn't locked the kitchen window. It was tiny and over my head. I pried the screen off and slide the window open. I gave my 3 year old a pep talk and lifted him up and through the window. He had to climb off the counter and I was so worried he was going to fall!

She had a scheduled c-section and even the days leading up to it, she kept asking for prayers and good thoughts and hope that big sister is protecting them... some people put together that she was pregnant,  but when asked what was going on she'd respond by saying ""I don't want to jinx it.""

breakingmom,3dmaph,because__science,3,Fri Jul 17 14:32:04 2015 UTC,Conveniently - babies at 35 weeks tend to survive. It's early but they can survive. I have a friend whose son was delivered at 28 weeks. He's 13 and he's done great. Smart kid.   You likely have a majority of stuff around as well as the know how to handle a baby. You have stores near as well as Amazon etc. if you buy nothing until the baby is born you can still buy it later. And you may not go crazy buying stuff you don't need this way. Not denial - you are being frugal. ;)  I understand in a way because I believed mine was just a growth until I saw it on the sonogram on Tuesday. I'm only 10 weeks so huge difference but I struggle still with not thinking this is all in my head.   Plus hormones are a bitch. A huge bitch. And that could be part of it.   You should be almost to the weekly dr appointments now so just mention it to your dr. Talk about percentages of survival and stuff. Honestly you've got +/- 5 weeks right now. That's tons of time to buy stuff and get mentally stoked for that top of the head baby smell.

When my son was born, all I could say in that first moment was ""he's real! Husband, he's really here!"" We had plenty of stuff, but I just didn't KNOW until I got to hold him.   If I could offer one bit of advice, it would be to take the weeks you have left and celebrate this pregnancy and this child. You are almost certainly going to have a wonderful, perfect, healthy child soon. And, because I know I couldn't stop myself from thinking about it, if the unthinkable happens and you lose this pregnancy, I think you'll have been happier celebrating your child for the time you had him than fearing a loss that hasn't happened yet."

breakingmom,3dmnvb,jessika1005,4,Fri Jul 17 14:44:36 2015 UTC,"I cannot believe no one has said Naruto yet. Also check out Fruits Basket (only one season). Yu-Gi-Oh! is another common one I see kids watch. Take a look at The Vision of Escaflowne. It's been a long time since I've watched it, so I'm hazy on the nudity and violence levels, but I remember it being more magical and less dark (similar premise to Inuyasha with a girl spirited off to a magic land to fix their problems). One of the hard things with recommendations is the prevalence of casual nudity even in funny shows. For example, I would be totally fine with my kids watching Ranma 1/2, but there's lots and lots of boobs. Same with Tenshi.  For movies, all the Miyazaki films with the exception of Grave of the Fireflies are good bets. You may want to screen Princess Mononoke before showing it to your son, but your daughter is almost guaranteed to love it. Spirited Away is basically my favorite movie ever. My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, and Ponyo are good bets for your son. Lots of people love Howl's Moving Castle, but I'm a huge fan of the book, and it is so different that I can't watch it without feeling let down.  If they haven't seen it, The Last Airbender is a US show with a very anime feel.  If your kids remain interested as they get older and you don't want to police their watching as closely, you may want to subscribe to Crunchy Roll. It's like a Hulu subscription but for anime.  Now a few warnings. If your daughter is really into Inuyasha on Netflix, she will be drawn to Madoka Magica. It is a beautiful and incredibly well crafted anime. Do NOT let her watch it yet. 10 is way to young. It gets dark and weird. Bleach is a natural follow up to Naruto but is a little more mature. By the time they've worked through Naruto, they may be ready for Bleach but not yet. Watch out for ""magic girl"" series as they tend to have a lot of nudity if that bothers you. Your daughter will love, love, love Slayer, but, again, boobies. Slayer doesn't really have the full show like some do, but there are a few characters where everything but the nips are visible.  Feel free to ask about specific shows as they get interested."

breakingmom,3dmnvb,Cairnwyn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:03:39 2015 UTC,"Thought of a few more. Your son will almost certainly like Dragon Ball Z. The best description I can give is imagine if Superman lived in Japan with a bunch of other alien guys, and they all made a living off of super powered karate tournaments. And Superman is married to a nagging wife with a cute little super power baby. The animation is very simple with basically no gore. My brother was obsessed with DBZ when he was 13.  Rurouni Kenshin is a good introduction to the samurai genre if you think your kids would be interested in that.  And if either of your kids likes the giant robot genre, I would start with Voltron then move up to Robotech and then the Gundam shows.  Cardcapters may also appeal to your son since he likes Pokemon."

The old Sailor Moon is great, for both of them if your son doesn't have something against shows with only girls. Um, Sword Art Online is pretty popular and I'm loving the hell out of Fairy Tail. My little cousin is way ahead of me in it lol. It has some darker elements, but they're like tween/teen boy dark and dramatic if that makes sense?"
breakingmom,3dmnvb,Rainbow-Spite,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:08:52 2015 UTC,"Fairy Tail would probably be a good one. I haven't seen all of it though, so I'm going off of my daughter's analysis.  Your daughter may like Soul Eater. The show itself would probably be fine for your son too, but some of the artwork is kinda freaky. The sun and the moon are disproportionately creepy looking, even though they have nothing to do with the story at all. It's a good show with an overall positive message, not a lot of gore, most violence is implied. That sun and moon though...fuck."
breakingmom,3dmnvb,Rainbow-Spite,3,Fri Jul 17 20:32:48 2015 UTC,"Full metal alchemist is my favourite, and Netflix has it. Brotherhood is the second series which is the same as the first series but different and a bit darker."

I actually had to go outside just now and tell him I thought he was being rude, the fact he was standing inside my garden staring through the window trying to get my kids to come outside didn't sit well with me for some reason, lol."

His mother is now 40 and got together with a 17 year old 3 years ago. They hid it until he was 18 and then it was ""oh I am pregnant""... when the news from that died down it was ""I miscarried""... when the news from that died down, the 18 year old boyfriend decided to grab his samurai sword and started threatening the neighbours. He got arrested.    I mean, I feel bad for this 7 year old kid, I really do. But I just had to close my curtains because he wouldn't stop. I feel so horrible in my own home right now."

breakingmom,3dkxab,VladTheSoviet,2,Fri Jul 17 12:18:19 2015 UTC,"The thing is, because this is a class 2 felony (aggravated battery instead of just domestic), the quotes I'm getting are insane.  It's going to be anywhere from 4-7 grand to retain someone.  I simply cannot afford that.    I suppose because its a ""first felony"" he won't get slammed.  But, I don't know anything.  It's strange to me that his bond is so high, lawyers are so expensive, and yet my pedophile step-father was able to skip jail after only a few weeks.  With picture evidence.  This is insane.  No one wants to help a 6'5 weightlifter who allegedly ""strangled"" his family member despite this person having a very clear alcohol problem and a record longer than I am tall.   And I'm tall."

When my husband got home,  he was instructed to find a spy disguise.   So he put balloons under his shirt, which my daughter found hilarious.   Dinner was excellent -- homemade black bean and spinach enchiladas and then it was the last day of swimming lessons.  Thank goodness because it's like a sauna in there.

Mine is acquiring quite the imagination though. She likes to tell us that she lives in a white house (ours isn't), drives a little green car (neither of us have a green car), and has a puppy named Sleepy (we don't have pets). Bunnies live in little houses and poop in the dirt.  Her dad also told her that I need to learn how to poop on the potty so she constantly lectures me about that.

All using stolen from the dish drainer utensils and cups.  He'll 'crack' each while saying egg.    He doesn't even eat his eggs most of the time.    I cant wait til it really gets going!

I thought I'd try closing the blinds in the nursery and see if I could feed her and get her to go to sleep.... it WORKED.  I also laid her down in her bed and she opened her eyes and smiled at me and coked out. I got to sneek out, and RAN to my bedroom while stripping off my clothes and jumped into the shower with the monitor on the ledge.   She slept the whole time... I even got to shave all the things....  Then when she woke up, it was her bath, I accidentally splashed water into her mouth as she was laying down and she choked, but after I patted it out of her she smiled. Got her dressed, fed her again, she made BIIIIIIIIIIIIG poops, and then after we got all cleaned up we went and ran errands.   I got everything we needed and she only got fussy once and I fed her a whole bottle in my truck in the parking lot. She conked out on the way home, and I got her back into the house, and into her bed without waking her. She slept for another hour.   I got to say hi to the cute UPS man and got the next stage carseat/booster thing I got for 70 dollars off during prime day.  I also got the amazon branded wipes. If you are curious they are just like target's wipes.   Hubs got home, baby woke up. Skyped with my parents.   LO passed out, but hubs wanted CICI's pizza.   Risked a meltdown and loaded her back up and went out. She did great. Played with her stuffed minecraft creeper while we ate.  Came home, last bottle. Passed out.   I am at a loss at what to do now... the house is clean... laundry is done... dishes are done...  and Tomorrow I have a ton of shit I bought during prime day arriving... and I have a doctor's appintment to get new glasses...

She even refuses a bottle of pumped milk in the evening now (!) even though she has taken a bottle since she was 10 days old and will only be consoled by the boob.  I am happy to be able to console her at all but it is rough. What a dick for saying she is sick because you took her somewhere.

breakingmom,3dkl1u,skratterbug,3,Fri Jul 17 01:03:47 2015 UTC,"Technically, it's a different understanding of colic, I think. Colic is a semi medical condition that's a catch all diagnosis for ""fussiness"" in newborns, without known cause or treatment, but eventually goes away. Purple crying is a normal part of mammalian newborn development that is difficult to endure, but will eventually end with time.  At least that's my understanding of it. I could never really tell it apart from cluster feeding, and the most important part of it to me was ""dear God will this ever end."""

All I do know is that she fits all the purple crying symptoms exactly. From what I have read on it, all babies go through extra fussy periods of it from 6-8 weeks (so she's right there at it) and it improves from there. The severity varies across babies. I'm not mad that he didn't know what it was,  I'm mad that he didn't bother to think about what it could be beyond ""oh, she must be sick from venturing into the world."""

It also has little exercises to do with LO to help them test out the new abilities after the fussy period is over."

breakingmom,3di8oq,-sixandseven-,0,Thu Jul 16 17:38:04 2015 UTC,Our daughter had trouble latching in the beginning so we had to syringe feed a lot in the hospital.   She could only nurse maybe 40% of the time.  Once we got home her latch hadn't improved but my milk came in and her stomach grew so we couldn't feed her fast enough with syringes and just switched to bottles.   You can always try a bottle for a couple non consecutive feeds and see what happens.  A baby who nurses well probably isn't going to forget how after just one feed.

Apparently I turned into a disrespectful, ungrateful daugter in law, right around when I was 9 months pregnant. These are words she told my husband, I am glad I was not there, otherwise shot would have gone down. I won't go into most of the story, but a big part was that she blamed ME for spending so much on the wedding and having such a big wedding. Ummmm, your the one who made us invite close to 300 of YOUR family members. Not to mention several ""family friends"" that ""are like my own children""-FIL who we have NEVER met. And your OWN child is getting married. He photocopied who knows how many invitations. We told them they get 6 extras, my parents get 6. Originally it was 5, but they pleaded and begged. Anyways, response cards start coming in and one seems...different. I look closer and it is photocopied! That SOB! Anyways, sorry, I got way off point. MIL blamed me for big wedding and spending so much money when it was them who required wvery single person to be invited so we didn't start any drama shot that that family holds on to for years. I'm glad we did what we did, but I sooo understand eloping! And its the couple's choice! Kinda like ""when are you going to have more kids?""

We left her with my mom and went to the county clerk. We still laugh about it because there was a huge sign that said ""This is not the unemployment office. That's down the hall in room 101"".

Our ""elopement"" isn't cheap but we're doing a wedding/honeymoon all in one and we'll be gone for 9 days!

breakingmom,3dihuq,patientish,2,Thu Jul 16 17:14:20 2015 UTC,"Originally, my husband and I were going to have a huge shindig in my hometown. I hired a wedding planner since I was no longer living there and began making payments  to have everything paid off by the time of our big day. In all, it was a little over $5k, with more to go. I tried to get a hold of her one day, but the phone was disconnected. I went to her website and there were a ton of angry messages calling her a thief, a liar, and ""you'll burn in hell for this"" type things. Turns out, she left town with everyone's money and didn't do shit as far as planning any events. I was lucky that my wedding was a year away, but some people had events for that weekend or the next. We all filed charges against her, but the police couldn't do much about it until all the event dates had come and gone and no services had been rendered, which is a whole other thing that infuriated us all.   Anyway, since it was obvious that we weren't getting the wedding of our dreams, my husband and I got married that weekend. It was at our local arboretum, which was free, with a JP officiating. I wore a beautiful $45 dress from JCPenny, and my husband wore his suit with a fancy new tie. My MIL had booked us a photographer for an engagement session, so we just did that + wedding pics in the same day. After the ceremony, we went out to eat, which his grandmother paid for, and had a car service pick us up from the restaurant and take us to the nicest hotel in town...which in our town isn't saying much. In all, I think we spent $600, including the photos and I got to marry the love of my life a whole year sooner. My family wasn't able to come from out of town on such short notice, but that's ok. It was still a good experience. Everything worked out beautifully and it was still pretty elegant despite the time crunch and budget."

Plus I'm very private, I don't like all eyes on me, so it always just made sense for us to do a courthouse wedding.   We got our license and scheduled it for the week after. Invited my dad and of course had our kids there. The judge who married us was so sweet. He talked us through everything and when we did our vows in the little room, it felt so personal, so intimate, it was beautiful.   I don't regret it at all. I didn't have wedding stress or drama. All I had to think about was the reason I was getting married to begin with - sharing my life with the person I love. Instead of worrying about this dress or those flowers, or who to invite, and going broke doing it, it got to be completely about us, our life, and our love for each other.   Afterwards, we all went to eat at the restaurant where we had our first date, and we even ordered the same things. It was such a perfect, wonderful day.

Mostly when I see all the cool Pinterest-type ideas.  But...I loved our wedding!  A friend took our photos so we had a good discount on photography and had access to all our photos.  There was no stress over wedding invitations, bridesmaid dresses, venues, food, colours, drinking, and family drama was at a minimum!  My mom was bothered about it because I think she had this image in her mind of her firstborn's wedding with all the family and a big reception and the father-daughter dance and all the trimmings.  She told me once that my wedding was ""bad"" because I didn't have cake.  But...CHEESECAKE!  If I had had a big wedding, I would have snuck out mid-reception.

After all that we were going to try and plan something small for August 2015, but my mother said she was too busy because she already had jeep events planned. (apparently jeep week and 4 wheeling is more important than seeing your child get married)  Needless to say I was so fucking pissed off at that point I was homicidal. We can't have anything nice because we're drowning in bullshit.  Ended up my mom decided she was coming into town for Memorial day this year. I planned a wedding in the park in less than 8 days, bought a fucking ugly white dress from Macy's for $100, made all the food and the cake my self because it was too last mintue to order catering on a holiday weekend. My mom and step dad came and my husbands family came (30 people, his family is huge). No one else who I invited, friends or family wise showed up.  I'm still bitter about it, I wanted to at least feel pretty or something on my wedding day. I spent the entire day before and day of cooking and most of the ""party"" (in our backyard) serving food and cleaning.   Plus is we incurred $0 in debt, and I don't have to stress out about it anymore. (spent about $1000. total, mostly on booze). Also found out I was pregnant a week after we married, so theres that.   People who were invited knew about a week in advance. Everyone else found out after. There was no formal announcement. Just said ""Oh hey, we got married over the weekend"".  Also, now everyone assumes we got married because I was pregnant (even though I had no idea I was pregnant when we got married). Which pisses me off, because it's a rude fucking assumption.

I have most everything childproofed in the room that he spends most of his time in, including everything blocked and gated off, so I dont have to say it a ton because he has free reign in here."

We have taken out everything from the living room except the couch, chairs, tv and lamps, and we have gates blocking the tv, lamps, and ac. He still manages to be a pain in the ass because he climbs the gate to reach for the lamps, or he climbs up on the arm of the couch to try to get over the gate, stuff like that. That's when I say no. But he already knows he's not supposed to do that stuff, so when I say no he looks at me and his eyes light up because the fun game has begun.   I do repeatedly redirect him, so it sounds like I'm on the right track. Every new phase makes me feel like a dummy!"

He was probably 9 months old at the time."

I guess when I said he doesn't understand no what I meant was that he doesn't know that NO MEANS NO. Lol. He understands that he's not supposed to do things and that no is a HILARIOUS word but me saying no doesn't stop him.
breakingmom,3dkiml,CoffeeVodkaAndBlow,3,Fri Jul 17 01:07:32 2015 UTC,"I say no to my kid (he's 16 months so a bit older). And then he started mimicing me by scrunching up his face and shaking his finger at me and saying 'Doh!'. So apparently thats what I look like when I say it and now its one of his few words, fuuuuuu.  But I do find that saying no just makes him do whatever more, so we have more success with redirection or correction. For example, if he hits the kitty I hold his hand and say 'we Pet the kitty gently' and then move his hand in the correct way. Its definitely hard to discipline when they're this little, but I think as long as you're somewhat consistent you should see progress."
breakingmom,3dkiml,abigaila,3,Fri Jul 17 01:30:39 2015 UTC,"Umm, maybe a straight jacket?!  Just kidding :-) But seriously, my one year old does some of that stuff...the banging on windows (and floors, doors...think the kid is going to be a drummer). Anywho, if she does anything that hurts me, DH, the dogs, anyone...we give her a very firm ""NO"" or ""no hurt/bite"", etc. And redirection if she doesn't cry. She usually cries when I say no firmly, but it's been helping."
breakingmom,3dkiml,abigaila,3,Fri Jul 17 04:24:50 2015 UTC,"My son is 11.5 months.   I know that physical discipline is controversial, but I do the following:   ""No!"" (which he - and other babies I have been around - understood consistently starting around 9-10 months) Firm commands. Grabbing his hands and explaining what he can't do. Holding his hands still by his side for ten seconds as punishment. Swatting or squeezing his hand. Time-outs in his crib. Spankings on his big cloth diaper butt.   Discipline is very ritualized, with a very clear pattern:   Warning. ""No, buddy, don't go into the kitchen right now."" Second warning IF it's something he's not familiar with. ""Don't go any further from Mama, if you keep going you'll be in the kitchen, and I told you not to do that right now."" If it's something he definitely knows, he doesn't get a second warning, and if he is actively being sneaky, I'll sometimes swoop in like an angel of justice with zero warnings. NOT often, though. He's little, he needs reminders. Stern explanation. ""Kiddo, I told you not to go in the kitchen, and you didn't listen. You didn't obey Mama. You're going to get a time-out because you didn't obey Mama."" Punishment. For a time out, I'll put him in his crib and stand about ten feet away with my arms crossed and my back to him for ten seconds. He howls as though he is being murdered.  Reassuring explanation. ""Oh, honey, you didn't like that, did you? Yeah, I know, you don't like time-outs. You're a good boy, and we love you SO MUCH. You got the time-out because you went into the kitchen when Mama told you not to, and it's important to obey. I told you not to go into the kitchen because you could have gotten hurt. No one is mad at you any more and we love you so much, you're our best Kiddo."" The reassurance comes with hugs and kisses and then we go back to whatever we were doing with as little fuss as possible."
breakingmom,3dkiml,thekenzta,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:15:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed response! I will try time outs in his crib. He won't sit still right now so that's a good alternative.
breakingmom,3dkiml,baconandbacardi,2,Fri Jul 17 17:46:54 2015 UTC,"One thing that I forgot to mention is that I will usually tell him what the consequence will be he continues to disobey. ""Buddy, if you go in the kitchen, you're going to get a timeout.""  He knows perfectly well most of the things that he is not supposed to do. He will touch the dog's crate, realize I can see him, and burst into tears because he knows what's coming. That's the nuclear punishment. No warnings. He gets scooped up and spanked and lectured while on his way to the crib for a timeout. It's a major safety issue - we have a good dog, but that's her safe place, and if he corners her in there, while she's eating, that's how bites happen.  I'd love to hear how the timeouts work for you. As you may have noticed, I am very firm and opinionated on discipline. It's paying off really well. My son went to stay overnight with a friend of the family recently, and she said that when he tried to touch something unsafe, she would just tell him ""No,"" calmly, and he would stop, look at her, and go touch something else. Him being so responsive to that means that she is willing to come rescue us from baby boredom pretty frequently, which is awesome.  I'm not saying that my son is some sort of perfect little angel because I do everything right or anything. Let me be very clear:   A few days ago, he had three screaming tantrums by 8:30 in the morning.  Yesterday, he stole the dog's toy and hid behind the sofa to chew on it without getting a lecture.  This morning, when I reminded him not to touch the TV, he looked at me, looked at the TV, looked at me, and put both hands flat right on the damn screen.   He is a child. Children disobey. However, we are accomplishing two things that I consider valuable:  1) Providing clear consequences and expectations from the start so that he is used to it and doesn't have a rude awakening when boundaries are suddenly placed.  2) Getting US in the habit of being good disciplinarians. It helps both me and my husband to start practicing the way we want to respond (quickly, firmly, calmly) to bad behavior NOW, not when he's older."

I've seen people talk about others as if they're nothing more than their diagnosis.  That said, those labels can be really useful. A proper diagnosis can get you access to the treatment he needs, which is way more important than what a few assholes think. You also don't need to tattoo the diagnosis to his forehead or something. There's nothing wrong with only telling people the information that's relevant to them when it comes to your kid's health.

You will know what you are dealing with so you can be a more effective parent.  A diagnosis doesn't change your child.  They are still the same person going into the evaluation as they are coming out.  Ignoring the issues does your child a HUGE disservice by denying him resources that could potentially help him.

I wish more kids would ask or at least approach calmly. He's a 1 year old boxer and still pretty bouncy. Kids are his favorite.

Our younger/smaller dog is also a rescue and a mutt (rott/lab/golden/Schnauzer?). He is fond of kids but not like the big one. We got him when he was 5 months old and were nervous at first around kids, as we didn't raise him from a small pup like the big one. A friend of ours has a 6 year old that helped calm that fear. This kid is also gonna get himself bit one day. The dogs were trying to smell him, he didn't like it, and instead of saying no, he kicked the small one hard in the face. Happened before I could intervene. Small one just sat there looking like ""What just happened?"". No growl. No aggression. Just confused puppy. I dont worry about him now but I still watch kids around him a lot closer and make sure they stay out of his face. Big one is too busy licking them for me to worry about that with her.

And on the Saturdays when Maggie wasn't there, they'd have either a Schipperke or a Saluki. I was kind of sad when all of the dogs (which were all older dogs) ended up not being able to come after a few years (the Saluki passed away and the schipperke developed a seizure disorder) because Bubs really enjoyed those story times.

If we didn't, little loco wouldn't eat whole meals because he wasn't that hungry. And then he'd want more snacks when he did get hungry, and vicious cycle ensued. So he gets breakfast, lunch, 3 o'clock snack, and dinner. The 3 o'clock snack is partly cultural--it's totally ingrained status in Japan, like ""tea"" is in some countries--and partly because dinner doesn't normally happen till about 7, which is really too long for anyone to go without eating. The side benefit of the 3 o'clock snack is its generally the only time he gets ""treats"" (say junk food or sweets or anything else not a normal meal, so he knows to save candy or things for those times). We also won't let him ""come back"" to a meal. He would always want to give up on a meal half way through because he'd rather go play or something, and then say he was hungry again in an hour or two. Now he is warned that he will not get anything else until the next meal if he chooses not to finish his breakfast/lunch/dinner, and after a couple of time experiencing hunger pangs, he's pretty much learned to eat up what he has been given.  Now that he's learned to regulate his meals better, we'll sometimes let him have a bit of fruit or carrots between meals (kid loves baby carrots, what can I say?) but in general he knows the schedule and won't whine for food in between meals unless we're running late and he's starving.

That's right around the time I developed PPD and while, of course, not everyone gets it, it IS pretty widespread that three months is when your hormones start to do crazy things, whether they're back to ring balanced or they start up again. Try some coping mechanisms. Take DEEEEEP breaths, let your baby cry while you count to ten before going in. Try taking a nap, because maybe that will balance the sleep regression for you.

I don't feel tired, just really easily enraged like you describe.  A good day of sleep/napping helps a lot (but I know it can be hard to get).  Sometimes I cheat and co-sleep for the baby's naps - the baby sleeps longer and I get some rest too.  My little girl is also 3 months.  My doctor said something at my post partum check that's helped me a lot.  If we saw a dad getting all grouchy, emotional or ragey after having a new baby, we'd just say he's tired.  But with mom's we always blame hormones first.  Try to treat the tiredness first, since that's more easily treatable and go from there."

breakingmom,3dinll,Tootfarkle,9,Thu Jul 16 16:05:44 2015 UTC,"That hurts.  A couple years ago one of my best friends from HS called to tell me he had proposed to and was engaged to our other best HS friend.  Amazing!  I was so excited for them and told them their wedding was gonna be so much better than our stupid HS reunions.  ""Yeah, it's gonna be awesome,"" they said.  Later that year, I saw FB photos of their wedding.  A big wedding & reception.  In our hometown.  Attended by our mutual friends.  It did look awesome.    For Christmas I received a card that included wedding photos.  I've pretty much not spoken to either in depth since, because I mean WTF?  I'd really like to know why I wasn't invited.  Look, your ""best friend"" is obviously dumb and she's done you a favor by releasing you from the bonds of friendship with her.  You owe her nothing.  You owe yourself a kick ass reception because you are important and the people who matter will be there, especially your groom!"

I haven't talked to my childhood best friend in three years and I still get down about it.   But I still invited her to my wedding two years ago. And she showed up. So, what your ""friend"" did is rude. And I think that she showed her true colours in that sense. Maybe it's time to let that relationship go because it's not what you thought it was/what it was before. I know, easier said than done but you don't need to waste time or effort on someone who can't be bothered with you. Sure, people don't invite you for various reasons but not even to know about the wedding? That is hurtful.  And don't let this hiccup affect your wedding plans. I had 300 people on my list and I was worried no one would show up. The people who matter and the people who love you will show up. You are important! Situations like this get you thinking and it's just downward spiral. Chin up, mama. You'll have an awesome wedding :)"
breakingmom,3dinll,gibbly,3,Thu Jul 16 17:26:53 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry. My heart hurts for you, that really sucks.  Have you considered reaching out to her? If you want to try to maintain the friendship that is. Say exactly what you said here pretty much. Maybe you can find out why she didn't invite you and you guys can work through it. Childhood friendships can be so tough. You want to maintain that connection to someone who has known you such a long time, but people grow and change and become different people, and it's hard to give our childhood friends the attention that relationships need. I'm sorry she hurt you instead of talking to you."

She's surprised that she basically told you she didn't like you and ignored you for a year? Stay cordial but curt. If she complains that you still hold it against her, tell her she broke your trust and friendship because of her actions."
breakingmom,3dhsds,ria1328,12,Thu Jul 16 12:05:07 2015 UTC,Accept the apology or don't.  Go on vacation or don't.  They're not mutually exclusive.  And if your husband didn't jump her shit when it happened he can shut up about what he wants now.
breakingmom,3dhsds,junkaccountforbrmo,14,Thu Jul 16 12:57:29 2015 UTC,"I think you can accept the apology for what it was, but those words still hurt and I don't think you need to be friendly with her or spend extra time with her."
breakingmom,3dhsds,medievaleagle,10,Thu Jul 16 12:06:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  Forgive but never forget. Forgive, because it's better for you and your mental status as it takes a lot of effort to be angry (at least for me). Also, you would feed into her drama by doing anything other than accepting her apology. ""gosh I even APOLOGIZED to yourjoeyramone but she was SO MEAN SHE DIDN'T ACCEPT IT AND I'M THE BIGGEST VICTIM EVER"".  BUT just because you forgive (which you do for you not her), doesn't mean you forget which means you don't have to go back to status quo. I would be polite to her, as I would any adult, but hold her at arm's length. I would not treat her as a friend, I would not confide in her. I would treat her as I would my neighbor, polite but making no effort to create a relationship.  Your husband needs to check himself before he wrecks himself, your SIL was terrible to you. you don't need to do anything except not feed into the drama she needs to create to feel better about herself."
breakingmom,3dhsds,pipeen1,8,Thu Jul 16 13:38:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't even read the other comments but there's something I teach my students and my kid. Just because you apologized doesn't mean you are forgiven, it's forgotten, or an apology is your golden ticket out of trouble. I had this student last year I was working on who would EXPLODE with rage and say mean things to me and about me. It got to a point that she would do it and then within like five minutes would be apologizing and showing contrition. I finally explained to her that now that she's able to apologize of her own free will she needs to harness these feelings of regret and think before she speaks.   Your SIL is allowed to hate you. She's allowed to think mean and spiteful things of you. She is even allowed to say these things to you. That's on her. But what she can't control is you and how you react to her. If you don't want to go on the trip you don't have to. If you think the apology is only to get you to allow her on the trip, you are either fine with it or you're not.   Hopefully your spouse will support you if you want more distance after the apology and effort shown before you allow contact."
breakingmom,3dhsds,ugga_mugga_mama,7,Thu Jul 16 14:42:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go on vacation with her. It sounds like you would be spending the entire time feeling self-conscious, worried that she is going to get angry again, or simply disliking being with her. That's a shitty vacation. Unless this is really important to your husband and he's willing to make some big concessions and you decide you're willing to put up with it for him, I would just write a short but polite response and a bland excuse for not going. If she gets pissy about it then it's just further reinforcement that you don't actually want to spend time with her. If she deals with it and stays friendly with you then maybe in the future you guys can have a relationship.  I also don't think your husband has the right to just want things to go back to the way they were without your input. It would be one thing if he wanted to have the same relationship as before but he can't really ask you to do the same."
breakingmom,3dhsds,Nikcara,4,Thu Jul 16 13:43:26 2015 UTC,"I went through similar with my SIL. She apologized, I apologized for my part in our petty crap, and we agreed to build a better relationship for the sake of the whole family. I meant what I had said so I put effort in, she ignored me for the most part. After a couple years of that, I just cut off contact with her and blocked her on everything. Fuck that bitch.   What I would do differently this time is to just accept her apology, apologize for my part (always do this, it's the adult thing to do), and let there be neutrality at best between us. No animosity, but no genuine effort. It's really just a waste of effort with people who you just aren't going to get along with no matter what."
breakingmom,3dhsds,Flitterbee,6,Thu Jul 16 14:33:46 2015 UTC,"You could tell her you accept her apology and appreciate the sentiment, and that you would like to work towards rebuilding (key word here, implies that ""the past is in the past"" isn't going to cut it) a relationship, but that you think that a week long vacation together isn't the best way to do that. My guess is that she's been given a lot of slack over the years, people saying that this is just the way she is and sweeping it all under the rug in the hopes that they won't be in her crosshairs anymore. She's never had any consequences to her behavior, which is why she's so ""surprised"" that anyone actually resents her. Her apology, while a great first step, is really just the bare minimum. And your husband is basically wanting you to continue the cycle of not holding her responsible for her words."
breakingmom,3dhsds,Bobalery,4,Thu Jul 16 15:35:01 2015 UTC,"Those are some really random things for your SIL to pick at. People are so weird.   Is it reasonable to thank her for the apology and to acknowledge that what she said earlier really hurt you? If you think she's sincere and you want to, you could say something about wanting to rebuild the relationship or start over. No matter what your husband thinks, the relationship will be different now, even if you've made up. I hope you sort this out on a way you can live with. Sounds like a really shitty situation."
breakingmom,3dhsds,SupersonicJungle,2,Thu Jul 16 12:26:19 2015 UTC,"I mean, totally acknowledge her apology, thank her for it, and decline to go on vacation with her, but be cordial at future interactions.

breakingmom,3dhsds,baconandbacardi,5,Thu Jul 16 12:42:17 2015 UTC,"My answer may not be the most popular one, but the question is what would you do. So here it is: I'd try and work it out for the sake of the kids and for my husband's sake. You don't have to be bff with her, but just foster an environment in which you can all be civil together.   As for a response to the email I would take the middle road, accept her apology but not without saying my peice. Something along the lines of   ""dear SIL, thanks for reaching out to me and for your sincere apology. When you said all of those things to me in the past I felt really scrutinized and betrayed so I hope you understand that it might take some time for us to get completely back to normal. I look forward to building the trust between you and I. This apology from you is huge step and I really appreciate you putting it out there"". But with more details.   Again I don't think that's exactly what you SHOULD do but it's honestly how I would handle it."
breakingmom,3dhsds,thenamefits,4,Thu Jul 16 15:39:28 2015 UTC,"My SIL, who can't get her life together and lives across the country, decided about 3 years ago that at 2 am in the morning she was going to text me what a terrible wife I am to her brother and that our youngest probably isn't even his. She apologized to my husband but I haven't heard from her since. Now with #4 due, she wants to come visit for a week, staying at our house, eating food I make, etc. so basically I'm kind of in the same boat. I'm not a very forgiving person."
breakingmom,3dhsds,littlehippy,3,Thu Jul 16 15:47:43 2015 UTC,"hmmm, so for the last 52 weeks or so, no contact at all, but now, she wants to transition to 24/7 and thinks that's a good idea?  Bargain, bargain, bargain. Maybe a weekend? Hold off until there is something else you want to do in that area so you have some 'alone time' away from her. Don't pay for any of her shit."
breakingmom,3dhsds,sellyberry,3,Thu Jul 16 17:39:11 2015 UTC,"I'd personally tell her that while you're glad she has realised what she said was wrong, hopefully she can also realise that it was over a line that she can't come back from. If she truly realises the error of what she said, she should realise just how bad it all was and why you may not be wiling to welcome her back with open arms, apology or not. You can accept an apology without having to put yourself back into a position where you can be hurt (i.e a relationship with her)"
breakingmom,3dhsds,crystal1107,2,Thu Jul 16 21:27:33 2015 UTC,"I have similar issues with my SIL. Overall, she's a bitch. My husband finally told her enough is enough and she needs to apologize. Has she? Nope. Will she? It's to be seen. If she does, I will absolutely accept. I'll also let her know that just bc this is behind us that I in no way wish to have a relationship with her. Cordial at family gatherings, and that's it.   I say, accept the apology. I wouldn't attempt a relationship. I also think you should talk to your husband about your feelings. ""Just bc I accept her apology doesn't mean I want us to be friends or that what she said didn't hurt...blah blah blah."" I think having everything out on the table is best."
breakingmom,3dhsds,wine_me_up,2,Thu Jul 16 13:54:56 2015 UTC,"If you want to accept her apology, do so, but I don't think it means things are the same as before. If she genuinely wants a friendship with you she needs to prove through her actions she's not going to be an ass any more. Just writing a 'sorry' letter is a great first step but I'd see it as just that."
breakingmom,3dhsds,icanhascake,2,Thu Jul 16 13:58:07 2015 UTC,"So last night (after almost a year of blissful no contact with her), my SIL e-mailed me kind of a nice apology letter. I totally understand that it is really hard to apologize. But now my husband wants things to go right back to how they were before. And I still think of her as this massive bitch who scrutinizes my every move and assigns the most malicious intentions to everything I do.  What would you guys do? I am torn between just writing a short thank-you    Tell DH that since she apologized you will be civil to her at family gatherings, but you have no desire to ever be close to her again.  Tell him you can't unring a bell."
breakingmom,3dhsds,beaglemama,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:31:42 2015 UTC,"I'm being direct/to the point. NOT directive. At. All:  You have boundaries,  maybe you need more time to.process the bad feelings to be genuine. If so, that's your boundary, and I agree with you where you imply isnt fair. Therefore, reassurance.towards reconciliation while still maintaining your needs/boundaries.   Something like: ""thank you for reaching out to me. In the future, it would be awesome to plan a trip, but would it be alright if we let some more time pass to build up to this trip?"" Then offer some alternatives, like regular upcoming functions?   If she plans everythibg, it's her way of making amends. If you're not there yet, you're not there yet. And if she doesn't get genuine appreciation for the effort she's wanting to make, it is all going to backfire, from my experience here.  It seems like she wants to control the situation. And she can control how she acts around you, not what she plans for you. That doesn't make up the personality conflict. So, I would find some neutral words to put the ball back in her court where she accepts your boundaries for now.   Move forward when you're ready. Don't put yourself in a situation where you're unhappy or risk losing your own patience andor a situation that causes you to shutdown and then retreat.  It's hard to accept and tolerate each other when we're naturally different. I've been on both sides of you'd dilemma.... and I've had to learn that courtesy and consideration is about self awareness of others and their comfort/needs....not just pleasant conversation.  I wholly support you not sucking it up and trying again until you're surly ready.   Edit to add: hopefully husband will support you and reassuring him that you want to be genuine for the long term snuffing this out is your intentions. Therefore, you need more investment of initial time for reconciliation, and you're excited to get over this hump and know you'll be able to accomplish that for him and kiddo, and definitely can with his support of what you need for this process to end in success"

I was never a girly girl, frankly my son can be girlier than I am when it comes to his hair, but I found that, if we start at the very end, and work our way up, then the pain (and consequently the struggle) are eliminated. Occasionally (read: most nights because the kid refuses to sit still) we give him some sort of visual/auditory stimuli (TV/current favorite toy) to help him focus while we get the combing done.  Obviously if the whole combing process is common sense for you then do simply ignore my comment. I just personally found that to work best for us."
breakingmom,3dix0a,PeacefulTreeLand,8,Thu Jul 16 17:15:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but I probably wouldn't sweat it.  I remember watching a lot of age-inappropriate things when I was a kid and so much of it went over my head.  That declaration may have completely gone in one ear and out the other.    But if it didn't, perhaps it's good to have a convo like, ""What does 'virgin' mean to you?""  Maybe she thinks it's kissing.  You can go further, ""Why do you think it's important to Jazz?""  It's a great way to start talking about love and sex.  IMO, It's a good lesson too that sometimes who we admire can also hold different values than we do.  Just because Jazz wants to have sex doesn't mean everyone should and it doesn't diminish the qualities you do want your daughter to emulate."

I was with my daughter's biodad for almost 3 months and he cheated on me not even a week after we found out I was pregnant. I didn't even know about it until weeks later and we had broken up when I was 7 weeks, before I even knew. He has always acted like it was no big deal and like it was my fault, because the girl he had sex with(and started dating while we were still together) told him that i was sleeping with someone else and he didn't bother asking me. I think I am only just getting to the stage of actually not caring about him.   You went through so much more with actually being in a good relationship and are already doing well. Soon enough you and your little girl will have your own place. And oh god, like actual hello kitty appliances for you? They make this stuff in adult size? Off topic!

Was absent during the whole pregnancy then wanted to know all kind of shit once I was in the end. We're civil now. He still annoys the fuck out of me but it's whatever. It's just who he is. I contain it around my girl.   But being alone through pregnancy made me strong. I know myself and I know my feelings. I know there's nothing I did wrong here. I let myself fall apart when I need to. But I needed to get me and my kid away from all that shit. I really thought he was it for me but the person I wanted that with was a lie.   I don't know what stage of grief I'm in now. acceptance? I don't know. I'm taking it as it comes.   And YES HELLO KITTY APPLIANCES!!!! I'm not certain they still make them but target had the whole line a couple years back. I need them!

First one, even with me working from home while taking care of him and even with my husband being out of the country for the first 11 months of his life, I could give him attention when he needed it. With little #2 now, I am finding it way more difficult to balance attention between the two. I miss being able to just cuddle with baby and make silly games and faces, like I did with #1. Can't hardly do that with #2 without #1 getting jealous or needing me to wipe his butt after pooping or wanting breakfast right now or needing to get dressed and off to school or whatever. Plus I've been way more frustrated with #1's behavior since #2 came along, because suddenly it's not just ""Oh, you're going to throw a fit about going to bed? Fine, I'll let Dad wrestle you up there while I clean up for dinner."" No, now it's ""Oh, you're going to throw a fit about going to bed? Well, while Dad is dealing with you, I'm going to try to shove my boob into the face of this screeching baby and spend forty minutes trying to get him to sleep while you bang around and wake him up every single time he starts to drift off. Oh, yeah, and then I'm still going to have to go downstairs and clean up from dinner until 9:30 at friggin' night. So much for me time!""

The hardest part was two in diapers (they are almost exactly 2 years apart) and even that was easy because we cloth diaper.

Of course, the first was hard but I had such an excellent support system to fall back on, my husband was around and my mom stayed over lots. Now it's just straight up exhausting and instead of just having to focus on one kid, my life is perpetually balanced between a needy toddler, a baby that needs me, a husband that still requires affection, my own wants/needs and a house that seemingly will never have a time without renos and is never clean.   I still have a great support system but it's harder unloading two kids on the grandparents, especially with a baby that still wakes up throughout the night.

Will you update the whiteboard every day? I know I'd forget and rush out at least some of the time. Put the date on whenever you change it.   I leave for work before everyone else in my house is completely awake. I tend to text and occasionally call from the train. I do my best to pick my battles because my husband reminded me that he doesn't have time to read/act on a zillion calls/messages while he's getting the kid and himself ready for school/work.

While the information you're giving is theoretically helpful, he probably doesn't NEED much (if any) of it and can send you a text / quick call if there is something he needs to know.    Of course, I'm comparing this to how I handle things - daycare writes down when kiddo ate, was changed, slept, etc. but I can always tell right away if he had a shitty nap or I put it together when he starts asking for food earlier than usual."

On the bright side if your daughter already forgot about it you could make it disappear pretty easily.    My grandfather got me a kitten one Christmas without telling my dad.  As soon as we went to my moms for the weekend that thing was gone.  I was mad at my dad for that one until I became an adult and realized how inconsiderate that was of my grandfather.
breakingmom,3dg1fw,-sixandseven-,27,Thu Jul 16 00:57:59 2015 UTC,"Omg, what in the actual fuck was she thinking??   I feel your pain. When my kids were little, my babysitter asked if she could take them to a church carnival with her kids. Sure, sounds great, here's some money for snacks and rides! When I came to pick them up after work, they come running all excited to show me their prizes. Goldfish. One for each of them. Are you fucking kidding me??? I'm a vet tech, and at the time I volunteered for a cat rescue, so I always have a ton of cats. At that particular moment, I had 8 of them. Those goldfish were not safe in their little soup bowls.   Plus, I fucking hate fish. They're cool to look at, but I'm terrified of moving them to clean their tanks and dropping them, and having them flopping all over the floor. It really freaks me out. So, we needed a tank with a lid and filter. Fine. I sent the husband and kids. They return with a fucking ten gallon tank for two little goldfish. We set it up. Husband and kids decide the fish look lonely in there (because it's an enormous tank that we didn't need), so they go buy more fish. It turns out that these carnival fish lived a lot longer than expected. So when they died, we had to have a fish funeral where both kids sobbed, and then we needed more fish (thanks husband). And that's how I ended up with a ten gallon fish tank full of several fish at any given time, for 5 years, until the husband and I divorced and I insisted the fish stay with him.  I think you should put a bow on the tank and regift it to her kid, even if she's not 2 yet. Get the kid all excited about it, then leave. Or just leave the tank on their front porch with a note saying they missed her and wanted to come home. But seriously, fuck fish. And fuck anyone who gives an animal to a child without parental permission!"

Drives me NUTS that they give them away at carnivals and that grandparents everywhere gift them in little bowls because it will be such a fun present.  I think I have most of my family trained now, any time they buy critters (or think of buying critters), they get a very long lecture from me, and everybody hates being lectured, LOL"
breakingmom,3dg1fw,forwardseat,2,Thu Jul 16 14:23:13 2015 UTC,"See? This is why no one should give living things as a gift. We thought our fish had so much space with the ten gallon tank (and I only wanted a 1 gallon tank, I just wanted a lid and filter). Honestly, we were shocked that they lived over 6 months. They were just little feeder fish, plus from a carnival. My husband did switch to fancy goldfish after awhile, hoping they would live longer than the other ones.   We tried. We had filters and thermometers and additives and vitamins and whatever food the kid at the pet store said was good. I cleaned that tank despite my phobia of flopping fish. But obviously we had no clue what we were doing. Hell, I didn't even want the damn things. I wanted a rat, but they're ""gross"" so I couldn't have one. I'd get one now, but with 6 cats in a tiny house, it would probably have a heart attack on its first day here!"

They're very clean, they only pee and poop in one corner of their cage, they're friendly, and you can even teach them tricks! Plus, they don't have a natural musk like mice and hamsters, so they don't stink.   I had rats as a teenager, and they were awesome. One in particular was super smart. He would hang on the door to his cage as soon as I walked in the room, and when I let him out he would climb onto my shoulder and groom me. I would let him run around the house and thump the floor with my hand when it was time for him to go back. He always came running, no matter where he was.   I think the tail freaks people out. Everyone thinks hamsters are so cute, but most hamsters are assholes, especially the dwarf ones. The big teddy bear hamsters can be OK. But rats are like dogs without all the work."

We both are fish people but we hate having fish in a tiny little bowl (it was not a gold fish). So we made a trip to the the pet store that day and spent 80 freaking bucks. That night he set the tank all up and put it at her level to enjoy. Next morning I get up excited to show her but couldn't find the damn thing anywhere.

The parents hired a petting zoo, a bouncy castke, and pony rides with a cotton candy machine, popcorn maker and mimes and clowns. There were over 100 people. Probably close to 150.

I don't mind too much, because I love critters, but I think she did it to get back at me for all the years she wouldn't come in my room because of the various lizards, frogs, baby birds, and whatever else I had living in there.  The only thing that really bothered me about it was she bought two dwarf frogs at a toy store, in a tiny cube with horrific care instructions like ""feed once a week"" and to hardly ever clean it.  I tested the water and it would have killed anything with gills.  Because I actually care about these things I ended up going out to buy a proper tank and acessories for them.  When my mom stayed at our house for a week with kiddo and I told her she needed to feed them once a day, she was all ""but the instructions said once a week!"""

breakingmom,3dfito,NellyBell42,27,Wed Jul 15 21:34:45 2015 UTC,"Go to YouTube and watch how mother lions play with their cubs.  The mother almost always becomes frustrated and snaps at her baby. Sometimes really hard.  But the cub stops! I think showing your child that people become angry when boundaries are crossed is a good thing.  Sometimes you might have to growl or snap at your playful little cub from time to time, and that's okay. :)  You didn't cause him any pain, you just became upset when your son caused you pain. Showing him that is one thing, but explain to him that he really frustrated you. That way he learns consequences."

The point is to startle him, showing him that people don't react well when you push their buttons. A simple swat on the butt is fine, in my opinion. Parents who cuss their children out, tell them to shut up, and spank until it burns---those are the people who should be crying about their parenting skills. Not you. :)"
breakingmom,3dfito,not_just_amwac,13,Thu Jul 16 02:55:57 2015 UTC,"I don't believe spanking makes you a bad parent. I use it as a last-resort, when my son will not do what he's told/asked/begged/bribed etc to do. Because I'll be damned if there's no consequences for him not doing as he's told."
breakingmom,3dfito,mcSquidly,10,Wed Jul 15 21:53:35 2015 UTC,"I've spanked my son about 5 times.  All before the age of four. Each time I did a count down from 3. None of the spankings were very hard. We'd talk about why he was spanked afterward then I cried alone from guilt when it was finally over.  But, I'll tell you what, he is 8 now and all I have to do when I'm seriously ready to snap is tell him I'm going to count down from three and then he'll get a spanking, and by the time I get to two, he is compliant.  I know some people are really, really against it but being that it meant that the next (going on) 4 years he understands when mom is about to lose her shit, it was worth it."

It's hard because in every other situation in life, if a person was doing that to do, you'd be kind of justified in swatting them. I reflexively did the same thing to my daughter when she leaned over one day and sunk her teeth into me.   I don't know if this helps, but what works amazingly well for us is saying ""when you do this, people don't want to be with you . I don't want to be with you right now."" And then leave.

Then the next time she tried to use it, it didn't feel right. So they told her that it must have broken and they'll have to get a new one next time they go to a store that sells them. Then they religiously avoided the aisles that would carry pacifiers when they were in a store with her and just played dumb. ""We can't find them anywhere!"" until she forgot about wanting one.

I think the best thing you can do is let her know that as long as she's with him, you can't be around her. But that you still value and love her. Then if when they break up, reach out to her and give her the support she'll need."

breakingmom,3ddqdw,Hydrangeas0813,3,Wed Jul 15 17:31:10 2015 UTC,This solid advice.
breakingmom,3ddqdw,cypher_chyk,5,Wed Jul 15 15:15:36 2015 UTC,"I know that must be crazy frustrating, but I would try not to cut her out completely. She is obviously being pushed away by that fuckwad boyfriend. I would just give her space, continue trying to involve her, so that when she does realize what he is, she knows she can come to you. Just don't invest all your feelings into her coming to things or being around as much as you would like. I went through a hard time for a while- living in town with family and hardly ever went to see any of them. I was doing a lot of stupid shit and being totally selfish. They just kept inviting me to family dinners and holidays and when I finally started getting my shit together, I knew they were there. I felt like shit and like I wasn't worth anything, but there they were- never said anything about it. They let me do my thing and still come home after."
breakingmom,3ddqdw,Ashley777,7,Wed Jul 15 16:05:00 2015 UTC,"You're not crazy.   I shall give you some perspective.   I had a crazy, controlling, abusive douchenozzle attached to my hip.   It didn't start where it ended. It was a progression of control and bullshit. Things that were absolutely unacceptable in the beginning of our relationship became normal for me over time and because it was a gradual descent into the madness I didn't notice, and when I did notice, I made excuses for him to myself and others because I was dependent on him for something.   In the back of my head I knew it was wrong. In the back of my head there was a tiny little voice repeating over and over ""this is not okay."" but I ignored it because all the other things competing for my attention kept me distracted and focused on him, rather than focused in myself.   Controlling relationships are insidious.   It is your sisters choice to do the things she does, to tolerate his behaviour, to ignore the voice in her head and the one coming from you.   But she's got him in her ear all the time.   The thing my ex did that was the worst in my opinion was isolate me. This sounds like what her boyfriend is doing to her. He's gaslighting her, and bribing her, and guilting her to do it. My ex started with the shitty ""friends""  I had through highschool. Every group has one or two of those. The ""friend""  who isn't really a friend and everyone keeps around and they aren't sure why because they more or less suck. They are the constant complainer or the shit stirring person or the one who obviously uses people or whatever. He started there. Those people were shitty people and cutting them out of my life was ultimately a good thing. But doing so at his advice was a mistake because it continued. Then the real friends were slowly dismantled and excised because they were bad too. Then it was my family. He picked out their flaws, magnified them, blew them into epic proportion, stirred the shit, and separated me from them. By the time it came to the last of my family there was no longer the illusion that I was making the decision to cut them out of my life. It was fully his. And I let it happen because he was right about that first group and he let me believe I was making that decision on my own.   Your sister has to make her own choices. She is going to choose him until it becomes too much to bear and then she will make a different choice.   You don't have to suffer for it though. You can allow her to fade out of your life. As much as that hurts, it will hurt less than watching her deteriorate and suffering with her as she continues to turn a blind eye.   When she comes out of it, she will come back. When she comes out of it and is receptive you can tell her how much it hurt, that you love her, and forgive her, and start rebuilding the relationship. Until then you are only giving her boyfriend ammunition to harpoon you with when he finds it necessary.   Tell her you love her. Tell her to just go to the concert and not sweat it. When she asks to come see the baby, find a reason to be too busy for her when she schedules it and be vague. Let her fade away gently. She will come back."

breakingmom,3ddqdw,adoreandu,2,Wed Jul 15 23:15:08 2015 UTC,"OP can't stop that from happening. And it probably will get physical and hopefully her sister has enough sense of self preservation that when he starts creeping over that line she bolts.   The problem here is that the dickhead boyfriend is gaslighting her sister already. If he's doing that, there is no way the OP can win in that situation while her sister is still willing to entertain the control her boyfriend is wielding. Everything that the OP does to preserve her own sanity and we'll being, every word she says to her sister, it's all going to be cast in the most negative light possible, and anything actually positive she tries to do for her sister if it can't be twisted by the boyfriend to something mean and nasty and selfish, will be outright denied. He's already gaslighting her. And this time he combined it with a bribe. the OP cannot win right now, not while her sister is unwilling to step away. The best she can do for her sister in the long run is provide no ammunition for the boyfriend to further poison the relationship they have and let her sister know that she is still loved."

Isolating someone from their family is an abuse tactic, as I'm sure you know, and once he's successful (which you can't help--you can't force her to see him for what he is) the abuse is likely to get worse. I think it's good that you're choosing not to enable this relationship though."

breakingmom,3dfmn0,followthepost-its,3,Wed Jul 15 23:56:58 2015 UTC,"In Ontario, Canada garage or yard sales are held on weekends. Signs go up a few days before around the neighbourhood. Sometimes at grocery stores, community centres. Check to see if there's a garage sale day that is promoted by your city hall. If there is then buyers will be out hunting for deals. Check with your neighbours to see if they want to have a yard sale this year. Bigger draw if you can put ""5 house yard sale"" on the signs.  I'd avoid holidays when people have other things to do. Check to make sure road work or events aren't going to make it difficult for people to get to your location.  Anything and everything can be sold. Cookware, books, clothes, jewelry. Keep the most expensive items where you can easily see them. Put out a mirror if people are trying on jewelry. Have an extension cord ready to go if you're selling lamps or something that needs power so it can be checked. No change room necessary. Most clothes sold are baby/kids.  Around here most garage or yard sales start by 8 a.m. but it's common to have the hard core buyers out by 7 a.m. Organize everything the night before.  Use card tables where you can. Buyers tend to be parents with kids in tow and seniors. Bending over to sort stuff on the ground is a turn off. Label items with tape and a marker. Things get moved around throughout the day and you'll forget your prices. Around 3 p.m. (or an hour before you plan om closing) start to heavily slash your prices to get rid of the remaining items.  Assume that at least some of the people coming to the sale are going to try to steal from you, either money, sale items or items that happen to be in view that are not for sale. Wear a money pouch and make sure you have tons of small change. Make sure you know how to identify counterfeit money. Have at least one other adult staffing the sale.   Do not let anyone in your house for any reason. Not for a bathroom emergency or to try something on. I know people who have had items stolen from their homes when their backs were turned and one had a buyer unlock a window and rob the house the next day. Some buyers are only at these sales to see if you're worth robbing. Lock your doors. Seriously."

I love auction sales and there are tons of them in my region. I pick up small tables and other items I know I can refinish for little money. Last year I bought 9 items that I've bought for under $150. I spent less than $40 in stain, varnish and fabricsc and sold them for $675.

breakingmom,3dce8g,alice-in-canada-land,19,Wed Jul 15 07:57:12 2015 UTC,"My mom did the same thing. When she'd send me off for my annual week of summer with Gramgram, I'd come home and my tiny little bedroom would be so clean. I was super appreciative of it, and I've continued the 'tradition' with my own kids.   I remember how awesome it was to come home to a clean, clutter free bedroom. And yep, once it got to a certain critical mass, I'd stand there in the middle of my room going ""Where the fuck do I start?!"" I'm so thankful for my mom for helping me like that. I'm not a hoarder anymore like when I was a kid. I haaaaate clutter. So, its not like she taught me how to be irresponsible and manipulate people into cleaning up my mess for me. It actually did the opposite."
breakingmom,3dce8g,unicornswithkeytars,2,Wed Jul 15 12:54:40 2015 UTC,"I recently had a come to Jesus phase about clutter and tidiness in the same respects. After my big medical debacle that left me reliant on others for everything but tooth brushing/eating for a while, I really appreciated tidiness and having everything in its place. When I went home to  regain my life, is be damned if I didn't make my bed every day and tidy every day. After a lifetime of clutter so bad you'd have to walk on piles of clothes and papers to get to the bed, kind of stuff. Finally reached my zen level of clean and I swear to god I sleep better in a clean house. My whole family benefits from this."

But I discussed doing this with my daughter before she left for camp in June, and she approved it because the critical mass was completely overwhelming. I threw out just those same things you mentioned, and organized everything else, and when she came home she nearly cried from happiness. She's been playing in and enjoying her room for a month, and she has been able to keep it picked up. I will repeat this as necessary for the remainder of her childhood."

I ended up neater than my brother by leaps and bounds, until he had to take care of his own house.   Contrast that with my husband, whose mom was one of those ""you can't do x until that room is clean to my standards"" types.

It's not like you went in, grabbed your 18 year olds dildo to throw away and read her diary. (although I would probably do the first, but give her a new one and throw condoms everywhere... I think my daughter is going to hate me later on)    Most of the time we do it together, but they still don't have any say in what gets thrown away, lol. I'll explain it to them, sure.

I lined them all up on her bookshelf neatly, but I didn't look.   She has shown me some of them before, though. There are four or five notebooks. Each has a different theme. One is for her fashion design ideas. One is her ""dog book"" where she draws different dog breeds. One is her ""pokemon book"" where she draws and makes up her own pokemon. One is her ""minecraft book"" where she plans out worlds. It's not like my 10 year old has salacious secrets. She isn't quite into all that yet. Even then, I won't do it.

breakingmom,3dce8g,brokenelk,2,Wed Jul 15 16:13:42 2015 UTC,"You are all awesome. Thank you for the feedback!  I've compiled some of the gems. I deleted the post just before I made this one because it just wasn't worth my time to defend myself and make people understand that I know my kids better than them. Some were supportive but they got downvoted into oblivion, like I was when I asked ""so you're saying i need to let my five year old decide if that trash or torn book is valuable to them?"" I have extracted usernames and such, and some were in response to my responses.   sit back and shake your head at the cluelessness of raising messy kids:   I'm in agreement with several of the other posters here. I urge you to take into consideration your children's growing sense of autonomy and ownership over their own living space. Adults don't like when someone else goes into their living space and changes it and takes things that those adults feel ownership over. It's not good to do that to children either. This is the difference between giving them limited choices, and not allowing them any choices - and it's critical. They have agency; you can let them pick if there is anything they want to save. If they say they want all of it, you can limit their choices.  Totally agree. My brother and I had to clean our rooms thoroughly ourselves on a regular basis. WE decided what we kept but we knew if we didn't declutter to our Mom's standard then she would clean for us. NEITHER of us wanted that! It left us with the decision making at a very young age but still got the job done.  I'm not sure whether your kids will be grateful, or hate you for throwing away their stuff... While this may be true, you're making a big assumption and applying a permanent action. I would suggest for anything else you're considering tossing, put it in a box and hide the box. You don't even have to tell them you did it. If the kids can't name a specific thing they miss in the next 6 months, that's when the boxes can go. But you'd be surprised the weight people can ascribe to items others find to be trash. Hell, I have a bottle cap with tremendous sentimental value. Did you warn them you were going to clean their rooms at some point if they did not? Ethics aside, I think it's a great before and after. Those rooms were a disaster. I agree with ---user---that it's iffy throwing any of their stuff away behind their backs. Maybe in the future you can include them in the purge process to give them some agency in the decisions being made? As an anecdote: I have a couple of friends who developed a fairly serious hoarding habit as a result of a childhood where their parents threw away stuff - they had a subconscious fear that anything they acquired could go away so they had to hold onto whatever they had tightly. I'm curious to know how this turns out after they get back. I remember my mother doing this when I was young. I always loved it! It was like coming home to a whole new bedroom and I would find toys that I had forgotten about. I have kids and I clean their rooms. But before throwing everything out I make two piles. One is pure trash. The other is broken items that are trash to me. I still let my kids 1. Know I am going to clean their rooms. 2. Have a say in decor choices. 3. Help clean up. 4. Look at what is going out for donation and trash.  I would feel incredibly violated if someone, even well meaning, went through my stuff and tossed it without consulting me. I get wanting to have a clean home. Wanting to upgrade your kids rooms. Donating items that don't fit or are not worn. But I completely disagree with the method you used because you did not teach them how to clean or how to declutter. You invaded their personal space and are teaching them that you don't value their feelings or their items. A ten year old girl is about to go through major hormonal changes and I am willing to venture she would want a say in how her tween age room should look. Identity is a huge component to a tween.  Be careful going forward. My parents used to do this to me all the time growing up. I'd go away for a few days and come back to find everything redone by my folks. I loved it as a child, but once I got to around 12 years old, my feelings changed dramatically. It felt like a massive invasion of privacy, things of mine that I wanted were thrown away. I'd fake happiness because I knew they spent a lot of time and/or money on the project, but it was always pretty upsetting.  I'd watch their reactions very carefully when they see the change. Pay special attention to reactions that are neutral, negative, or even positive reactions if they seemed forced.  Oh man, the 10 year old is going to be so hurt and furious. I think it was really wrong of you to invade her space like this. Actually...the five year old, too. That's THEIR stuff!  Great job! Looks great! Not so sure about how the 10 year old will feel about you going through her things but I hope the reveal goes well and they appreciate all your hard work :) In my case, I had this done to me as a kid and it felt extremely invasive and made it very clear that nothing I'd thought of as 'mine' in my room was really mine. Whenever this would happen it left me feeling very uneasy in my own room and a bit at loose ends, as though I didn't really belong there. All it really did was make it very hard for me to let go of belongings once I'd become attached to them, and I also started hiding things that were important to me so they wouldn't get thrown out. Because I wasn't consulted, I had no way of knowing if what mattered to me would be seen as valued to someone else.  No, but you could involve them in the decisions about what stays and goes. I think that's the point people are making- not that the stuff should stay, but that it's kind of jarring to come home and realize someone has gone through all your stuff and thrown out a bunch of it without even mentioning it to you. A bonus could be that the kids start to understand that when something is broken or too small it's time to let it go, setting aside a tote or something in their rooms where they could let those things live between deep cleans might help them get involved in making this process easier on everyone, and giving them the chance to take initiative.  Reddit loves to think of children as small adults, when they're not. My mom did this for me when I was younger, and it was awesome coming home to a brand new room. They will love it, don't worry what reddit says about parenting.   Not all children are the same, not all adults are the same. It's reasonable to ask. I agree! I have done this with my kids before, and they love it. I would never think of doing it once they get older (late kid/pre-teen/teenager). But 5 year olds are weird about their trash. They just need to forget it exists."

breakingmom,3dedvj,not_just_amwac,4,Wed Jul 15 18:37:29 2015 UTC,People fall all over the spectrum not just with weight but how it is proportioned. The spectrum is based on averages of formula fed babies until your provider is using the WHO chart.  (If your provider is using the standard chart formula fed babies and breastfed babies gain at different rates over the course of the first year. Breastmilk changes and formula doesn't. That's why you need more formula after a while.) Just like adult clothing all 3 mos clothing are not created equal. Different brands are going to fit differently. Your diapers matter too. Some are thicker than others.

My day care used to give me those old school plastic teethers that were like plastic sacks with colored balls in them. I hope that might help you guys get him cooled down. My seizure took place while I was at day care and apparently freaked out the ladies running it really badly. It will be ok! I'm 26 now and it didn't effect me at all. Just take slow deep breaths and do what you need to do to get his fever down.

I'm sure they told you everything at the hospital but I worked with a pediatrician for about a year so I just wanted to offer some support. Once a baby has had a febrile seizure (seizure caused by a fever) they are more prone to it happening again. Sometimes babies get fevers for seemingly no reason. It happens a lot more than you would think. Keep an eye on him and be sure to make sure he is drinking enough and he should be fine.

I'd almost go to a walk in clinic and just see if they can give you something for the pain if your dentist won't. Or see if another dentist can squeeze you in if you aren't set on seeing your dentist.

She has acid reflux and cried constantly (I'm talking blood curdling screams). 6 months is when we got a good flow going while she was on medication. However. My daughter is VERY clingy. If you left her in the living room to let the dogs out she screams like a banshee. It is REALLY fucking annoying. I get it. She loves me and doesn't want to be alone but she was perfectly happy and fine until I got to the doorway and then she loses her shit. It doesn't matter to her that I talk to her the whole time. I'm dead as soon as I leave the room.

On night #4 of no sleep I was in the recliner with her (because it's the only place she'd sleep because she was upright) and it was about 3 am and Dumbo came on. I watched it and BAWLED because I knew I should love my baby as much as Mrs. Jumbo loved her baby and I just couldnt. It ended up being our turning point. A week later we found out she had reflux after going through 12 hours of no feeding a 2 week old so they could do an upper GI. Most people don't realize how shitty you feel because you can't feed a newborn for 12 hours and they just get past the point of crying and they just lay there wimpering and they're so desperate they drink barium but the barium doesn't make them feel full so they're extra upset because you're feeding them but they aren't getting anything. I never want to do that again.

breakingmom,3dcsrd,scoutyfreeman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:11:13 2015 UTC,"Mine finally learned how to breastfeed instead of chewing at 4 months, so the terrible boob pain finally stopped. That's when everything turned around for us.   Mine's still a difficult bub, though, as far as healthy bubs go. He (at nearly 2 yrs) sleeps with me and after his first sleep period (2-4 hrs) he wakes me for a breastfeed every 20-40 minutes, with one 80min sleep if I'm lucky. So most of my night is spent awake or getting a few 10-20min naps, coz it takes me a while to go back to sleep.   And during the day he's pretty full-on. He can play independently, which is great, but he has so much energy and never shuts the fuck up. We have a running commentary of his day. Literally running, haha, often while holding sharp things. All day: talk, run, climb, babble, and tantrum coz physics vs motor-skillz. Plus insisting on being carried for walks. He's not 2 yet! This non-stop commentary crap is supposed to happen later, isn't it? Everyone (childcare centre, other parents, playgroup coordinators) remarks on the draining, non-stop nature of it. Luckily he's happy and funny (when physics is on his side), so it's a delight. A very wearying delight.   And he's not a fan of daytime naps. If he's not in bed with me, usually it's no nap or one 20-40min nap. If it's in bed with me, it's a 2-3hr nap but waking for boobs every 40min.   I'm presumably to blame though, coz I'm ADHD and I've never slept much. And he's a heaps easier baby than Mum says baby-me was.   Whew! Off-topic much? Looks like I had to get it out.   What was the question? Yeah, 4 months. It got better at 4 months. And it got HEAPS easier when he could crawl, coz then he could entertain himself instead of demanding constant attention and location-changing every few minutes."

Let's just say every new age is better (except for three, which was a goddamn nightmare).  When you have a high-needs baby, you need to ask for help. I was ashamed to ask for help for so long.

breakingmom,3dcsrd,manapan,3,Wed Jul 15 12:13:26 2015 UTC,"It does get better, but for both of my kids, it was a gradual thing, not an overnight change. Your daughter sounds a lot like mine (we logged SO many hours in that Ergo...still do, but we're down to 3-4 hours/day from 10-12). She's 4.5 months now and will sleep for 1-2 naps and the first part of the night in her co-sleeper (as opposed to next to me in bed). She'll actually let other people hold her and play with her on her good days. Some days I can put her down on a blanket t roll around and play for like 15 min. Other days it's 5 min. So...we're better than we were at 1 month, but it wasn't like some magical switch flipped and she all of a sudden loved life.   FWIW, I think for ""normal"" babies (I'd say we have ""difficult"" babies) 6 weeks is when it gets better because babies typically start sleeping for longer stretches (6 hours...what?!) and becoming more interactive. Usually. I think with fussy babies, you have to adjust the goal posts a bit and look for gradual progress.   Last thing- my son wasn't as high needs as my daughter, but he was an intense baby for sure, until about a year. He's now 2 and as toddlers go, he's pretty good. He's slept through the night since about 13 months and takes good naps, eats a wide variety of food, is super-social and friendly, helps around the house, and is a general goofball. She won't be like this forever. Fussy babies turn into good people! :)"

Also I can't imagine what you are going through - mine usually lets me put her down to sleep and has only had periods of clingyness since about 4 or 5'weeks old.

It was definitely a longer and slower for bub #2 who like yours insisted on being cuddled to sleep.

breakingmom,3dcsrd,CaptainCalamari,2,Wed Jul 15 13:08:21 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a gradual thing.  When you're first adjusting to motherhood everything just seems so... overwhelming.  You'll have good days where you think ""I've totally got this!"" and then you'll have days where you just can't figure out what to do.  Those days, you just do whatever you have to do to make it through the day.  Forget a shower (unless warm water running over baby's back helps soothe her), forget the dishes and laundry, just do whatever gets you through a few minutes at a time.  After a while things start getting better a little at a time.  I'm sorry you have a difficult baby, but it's not your fault.  It sounds like you're doing the best you can, so don't judge yourself based on your perception of others.  Everyone has bad days, and what you see of other people may just be the first ""good"" day they've had that week."

And another when she learned to walk. Difficult babies are TOUGH. Hang in there. Six weeks is a growth spurt and is a difficult time. So is 3.5 months. Take care of you and, as silly as it sounds, try not to worry too much about the baby being upset. The good news is that you will be much better prepared to parent a toddler. I've heard some parents say that the baby stage was easiest and they don't know how to handle a toddler. Fuck that. At 13 months in, I feel that everyday, parenting gets easier. Nothing could be more difficult than those first 6 months with a clingy baby!"

But she is very affectionate, lots of smiles and laughs from 2 montns on, you just accept that there's not much sleep or any alone time.

When she was smaller, before I committed to bed sharing, I spent quite a few nights sleeping with her in arms, propped up in all kinds of mad lounge/pillow forts so I didn't drop her in my sleep (!)

He also started smiling then, and that made it easier (he had a couple gas-smiles between six and ten weeks, but no happy smiles until 10 or 11 weeks, I took a picture of a real one at 12 weeks).

But I had PPD so the meds might have been a deciding factor for the second month. Each month had special achievements we both unlocked as we grew as a mommy and as a potato faced cutie :) Three months, she smiled more. Four months, she was all about monster noises. Five months was colder weather so she was all bundled up and adorable.  Six months was Christmas time and that's always magical.  Seven months, she tried to sleep through the night every once in a while. Eight, she started crawling.  Nine, it was warmer weather so we got out more. Ten, her daddy finally came home from Afghanistan.  Eleven was when I started realizing how badass I was for raising our baby mostly on my own. I was way more confident.  Twelve... well, we're here now. And I think this is the best. She learns new sounds and she copies me. We can do way more together but it's always more difficult and more fun than I have thought out. I don't feel like myself anymore. I feel like a sexy badass who has this shit down. I mean, I don't. But it's good to feel like that. And one day, you will too."

I don't think babies usually eat too much from the breast because they get it soooo slowly and they have to work for it. But I'm no expert.   I'll say 3oz at one feeding sounds like a lot, especially for a premature infant. How old is he now?   You might get some judgey comments, but if you ignore them you can also get great help from breastfeeding subreddit, no matter what kind of feeding you are doing, especially if you want to eventually nurse full-time."

breakingmom,3delg4,whiskeyjane45,2,Thu Jul 16 04:13:37 2015 UTC,"Hey There.  My son was also 6 weeks early and had GI issues.  Exorcist style vomiting and reflux issues that impacted his breathing.    Is your son on any sort of medication?  (Prevacid, Zantec, etc for the spitting up)  My son ended up taking two meds at the peak of his issues.  He's one now and doesn't take any though so it does get better!  What sort of formula are you giving if any?  (We ended up settling with the Similac for Spit Up because it has the added rice starch and is thick as hell.)  In yesteryear, before putting rice cereal in bottles was evil, they added rice cereal to bottles.  The unfortunate thing is that breastmilk will not breakdown the rice cereal so in order to give the liquid a thicker consistency it has to be mixed with something like the Sim for Spit Up.  There are a few options:  Nurse and give him formula to keep on top of his stomach that is thicker or pump and give him the breastmilk mixed with formula.  I tried both.  I ended up pumping and mixing because it was just easier for me.  He was also in the NICU for awhile so they typically gave it to him mixed in a bottle.    Also, when you pump, pump then massage your breasts like all the way at the back.  Apparently, according to lactation lady at the hospital, a sort of thicker, richer liquid sits back there.  You'll see it when you freeze your breast milk.  (I thought she was full of shit.)  But it separates more than the first milk.  As far as portion size goes, I just looked up what his daily intake should be and divided that out between the breastmilk/formula mix.  I burped him every ounce at first, then every 2, then every 3, etc as he got older.  He may not be spitting up due to overeating; he may just have reflux so severe that the acid is causing him to spit up.  When a child has GI issues, every 2 ounces they drink is creating an ounce of weird acid stomach juice, so they actually end up spitting up more than they take in.  (Or so my doctor told me!)  Also don't lay the kiddo flat.  Our son was in his swing a lot and the pediatrician recommended allowing him to sleep in his car seat (I know some disagree with this but GI issues create unique situations.)  Hope some of this helps."

I go to a coffee shop, sip on a latte, and read a book or write in my journal or sit silently and stare off into space while I think my own fucking thoughts without interruption.  Dad feeds kid and does bed time.  Every other evening of the week, I come home right after work and take over toddler-wrangling duties while husband gets dinner on the table (he stays at home with kiddo during the day and works in the evenings and on weekends).  Granted, my kiddo at that point was old enough to skip nursing one night a week (and my boobs thankfully put up with the interruption of their regularly scheduled draining), so that wasn't an issue.  But you don't even have to schedule a full evening.  Just schedule one day a week where you don't come home right after work.  You need this.  It is a requirement to get some time to decompress!!"

I separated the two of them and asked him what the hell he thought he was doing pushing his younger and smaller sibling hard enough that she fell down. He gave reasons and showed zero remorse.   So I asked him if he thought that it was okay to push her. He said yes.   So I asked him if he liked it when the girls on the bus were picking on him? (several weeks prior he came home complaining about some girls on the bus kicking his seat, and when he moved seats farther back the next day, they crawled under the benches to grab his feet and continue harassing him.) He said no. I asked why he didn't fight back and he said ""because they are bigger than me and I don't want to fight them.""   So I ask him if he is bigger than his sister. He says yes. I asked him what he would have done if she had gotten up and shoved him back instead of telling me. He said he would just shove her again.   So I planted my palm in the middle of his chest and shoved him hard enough to plant him on his backside in the playground rubber chip safety stuff.   The look on his face. Oh my god. I wanted to die. But also I knew I made my point. He got it. So we finish the conversation and sort it all out.   Apparently this makes me horribly abusive."

I only tell you this so that you can see that you can come out the other side of this as a whole, intact, happy person. Do not feel guilty if you have to let things slide for a while to manage your grief. Cry when you need to cry, be angry when you need to be angry. Something I noticed right after the death of my dad was that I found myself feeling guilty for enjoying things like food, and having fun with my little boy, while dealing with this horrible thing that had happened. It took me a while to understand that it is OK to feel happiness while you are grieving. Give yourself permission to feel the good emotions, and give yourself permission to cry, often and even at inopportune times. It made dealing with the subsequent tragedies that came later much easier when I could just give myself a bit of time to fall apart when I needed to. A good quote I read somewhere (forgive me I can't remember where) ""It's OK to have a meltdown. Just don't unpack and live there.""

My friend asked them to check over his choices and the TA in their class commented that maybe it was better this way because at least this way he will get a balanced diet."

We had the ridiculousness of with our school lunches we used to get given a block of cheese and the salad option. For some unknown reason they wouldn't give us the cooked vegetables. Needless to say we went on packed lunches when my mum found out.
breakingmom,3dd3ys,plasticcastle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:47:42 2015 UTC,I have some serious issues with the TA. She's very religious and has been overstepping the school's community worship and religious education policies quite dramatically. I don't need my five year old coming home telling me about the blood that fell into Jesus' eyes from the crown of thorns. Thanks.

And others are so supportive and realise you do what's best for the kid that works for you.   I'm lucky I've had the former. I've admitted I coslept to mine and they said that it isn't the safest option but can be done safely and momma getting sleep is safer than her not.   Sounds like yours is looking for problems. Hope you get a better one soon!

breakingmom,3dcwu9,adoreandu,2,Wed Jul 15 11:28:35 2015 UTC,Thank you. Sara kept telling me she was sorry last night. Made me feel worse. I kept telling her she did nothing wrong and there was no need to apologize. Sure hit me in the gut though.
