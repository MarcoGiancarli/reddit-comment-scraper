BullTerrier,3dy0rs,shayboy,3,Mon Jul 20 13:42:39 2015 UTC,Harley's our 8 month old bundle of joy and loves mayhem  He also loves hustling for food and cuddling. Spending time with him has led my wife and I to understand how much depth this breed has. They're incredibly emotional dogs who love their owners to bits.

BullTerrier,3deur6,Backpacks_Got_Jets,4,Wed Jul 15 18:48:00 2015 UTC,"1) I have a male 3 year old EBT and ive been his custom dog bed since I brought him home.   2)just checked his paws: rock hard  3)Bron was pretty nippy when I 1st got him, but he hasn't nipped in a year. I always just used one finger and kinda popped the bridge of his nose then slowed down the pace we played...idk if that's the best way but it worked."
BullTerrier,3deur6,fannypaq,4,Wed Jul 15 20:11:15 2015 UTC,"First off, Tango and your other dogs are so handsome! Jackson loves to lay on, under amd around me no matter how I feel about the situation! He loves to be the ""little spoon"" when we cuddle.  They are very social animals. Jackson's paws are hard as rocks as well. Jackson can be very mouthy hes almost two. I have taught him no teeth on a human ever is ok. I usually bop his nose and have him lay down to calm down some. He usually does this on his own now if he accidentally does it. Good luck :)"
BullTerrier,3deur6,Pandora023,3,Wed Jul 15 20:49:48 2015 UTC,"My EBT Chlöe is very mouthy when playing as well. She's ~1yr and still does it. I've done a few things as bopping her nose only seemed to 'escalate' the play as she can be very physical too.  First; think like a dog. When puppies play, if it gets to be too much they yelp and retreat for several minutes before returning to play. When she gets too mouthy (especially initially it did hurt! I'd let out a loud high pitched and exaggerated ""YELLPPPPP!"" and get up and walk away. Then I completely ignored her for 3-5 minutes before patting her or re-engaging in play. The first time I did this her expression was priceless. She looked like I'd been stabbed and then spent the next several minutes trying to make it up to me (so she didn't enjoy being ignored).... The second thing is sort of a modification of the game called 'It's your choice!' Essentially I hold and show food and Chlöe would be mouthy on my hand to try to get the food so I would wait until she stopped and then reward that behavior. After a while I started using the command ""Off!"" which meant take her mouth off and then rewarded once she did. Now I can play tug of war with her and if I say ""Off!"" she releases the rope... additionally if she gets mouthy I say it and she stops... Keep playing and rewarding the non-mouthy behavior and it will eventually diminish/disappear."
BullTerrier,3deur6,k2exoman,3,Thu Jul 16 22:31:47 2015 UTC,"Yay for rescuing a Bully :)  1) Yeah it's a Bully thing. Ours will lean against our legs, sit on our feet, rest her head on our forearms for attention, and even sits on our other dog when he's laying down. :P Bullies LOVE tactile input, and are always seeking out a good scritchin'.  2) Our BT has relatively soft pads still, still building up a good callous after crate life. But my other dog, a mutt, he's got really hard paw pads, he's had more years outside.  3) Yes. This is normal. The #1 thing you can do is immediately cease play upon getting mouthed or nipped. Just literally change to a neutral facial expression, look away, turn around and ignore for a few minutes. Wait until he goes and lays down or generally does something relatively calm, then you can re-start play. Another option is to also YIP really loud like an injured pup and pull away like it hurts, and then do the whole cease play and walk away/ignore. Consistency is key here, guests and family members will have to know to do the same :)"
BullTerrier,3deur6,ashV2,2,Fri Jul 17 03:22:12 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the wonderful world of Bull Terriers.    From my experience Bull Terriers feel like they have to be at the center of whatever is going on in the house.  By laying on your foot etc I think it lets them when something is going on so they aren't going to miss it.  Also, Bull Terriers possess the unique ability to put off of their body weight in to their neck making getting them off you a tricky task :) Nothing to worry about. Others have already given you good advice on this one.  I personally don't have to worry about my guy being mouthy. It is the surprise headbutts that get me."
BullTerrier,3deur6,Devil_Nights,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:23:51 2015 UTC,"Firstly,   Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww. Super cute!  Tango is super normal and all the above is typical bully behaviour.  they are very mouthy dogs, make sure you have a lot of tasty chew toys - try avoid rawhide, since they have a tendency of just swallowing. Our bully Harley sleeps on us all the time, they are special dogs, and think they're lap dogs. They just become very attached and love to cuddle.  For the biting:   Bop him on the nose, and give him a very sharp ""NO!"" Or just give him a firm ""NO!"" and ignore until he gets it. Don't lose your patience, bullies get it eventually.   They also don't forget traumas they have experienced, so just be as loving as you can possibly be.   Enjoy the adventures ahead... He did choose you after all :)"
BullTerrier,3dbdwr,wordgobbler,3,Tue Jul 14 23:27:36 2015 UTC,"So as to the first part, if you can find out why she's not with her previous home and that may explain some of the behavior. I find the best way to introduce new people or situations,  such as going to the vet,  to enforce it as a good experience. My ebt is almost two and he loves going everywhere. Vet, grooming, into stores, loves everyone and every pet he sees. He is also very food motivated. So he got a lot of treats. One way to is to crouch down (for an easy out from the dog if needed) and to face her from the side. Dogs see both of those as a sort of ""submissive"" moves, that you are not a threat. Move slow, extend your hand and let her come to you.  One very important aspect is make sure she has an out. Any dog, no matter how nice, WILL bite if they feel trapped. As to your niece, I am not sure what will work for that besides have her in a neutral area, I.e. the park and have her move very slow around your ebt and to maybe try some of the tips above.  Always supervise those visits, and if she is protective of you try meetings off leash. Good luck :)"
BullTerrier,3dbdwr,Pandora023,2,Wed Jul 15 02:10:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions. I will definitely start to take her more places and will try having my niece with her on neutral ground.   She came from a home with other dogs and lived outside. So coming to our house was like winning the doggie lottery. Plenty of food, cushy indoor bed, and no competition for love since she's an only dog."
BullTerrier,3dbdwr,Pandora023,3,Wed Jul 15 02:20:10 2015 UTC,Well she still might be adjusting. There she might have been bottom of the pack and is a little afraid and unsure of the new situation.

BullTerrier,3bls1x,Marjoke,2,Tue Jun 30 06:38:46 2015 UTC,"We have just overcome a similar problem by using a food supplement high in vitamins A,D,E and Biotin as well as omega acids 9,6 and 3. The one we use is called Nutri Cell and is produced in the country where we live, I'm sure you can find an exact alternative through your vet or pet supply store however.  Literally after 3 days of applying a couple of teaspoons to his food at each meal we noticed the dry itchy skin on his thighs and ""armpits"" was virtually cleared up, now after 3 weeks it is totally gone with no additional creams being used. I would highly recommend giving it a try.   Edit- As others here have already said, a grain free diet is absolutely necessary."

BullTerrier,38j46x,-SnarkAttack-,2,Thu Jun 4 16:21:19 2015 UTC,"I'd say try it. If you have access to a pool you could also try to get him to float with you on one of those blow up rafts and see how that goes, if it goes well then you should try the kayak. Look on Groupon so you can get a discounted rental (just in case you can't stay long because he freaks out haha) and try to go to a place where the water will be calm and it won't be too busy so your bully doesn't get over stimulated on his first time. Good luck!   P.S. Thank you, I love that life jacket! (found it online)"
BullTerrier,38j46x,-SnarkAttack-,4,Thu Jun 4 17:00:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks OP! I didn't realize this was actually your own video. I may just have to get that vest then. My Bully chewed the front buckle off of his current vest and I was just going to replace that buckle, but now I think I may use it as an excuse to get the shark vest!  Good idea about the rentals, but I own my own kayak. It's not a sit-on-top but he would still fit inside mine as I'm only 5'1. We live 5 minutes from Pittsburgh's 3 rivers so we can get in and out as we please. It's definitely not calm, so probably not ideal for testing dogs. I'm thinking of taking a trip out to a smaller body of water to test him out. I had considered it before, but now I'm feeling inspired! ;)"

BullTerrier,3883zx,LikeNapalm,2,Wed Jun 3 06:43:47 2015 UTC,"It isnt just because I wanted to. We used to  use a harness walking him but he would pull, a lot. Even at twenty pounds he was pulling me around and I weigh about 100 pounds mostly muscle. I use it as a tool to control him if I need to. I didnt want a dog to pull me into some kind of trouble, like to greet a dog agressive dog out for a walk with its owner. I hope you understand my reasoning a little better."
BullTerrier,3883zx,unclejunk,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:48:17 2015 UTC,"This is why we use one also.  A bully in a city, or around lots of people needs to be able to be controlled without pulling.  I do agree that the collar makes a bully into a different dog, and I don't like that aspect of it... But I am willing to use one to keep the dog from pulling us into a dangerous position.  I hope that when she grows up and has seen it all she won't need it any more.  I have tried the collar on myself before we got it.. it doesn't hurt, it's just uncomfortable."
BullTerrier,3883zx,CJHEAT,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:44:57 2015 UTC,"A few people have commented on it, and I take the time to educate them that a pinch collar can be a tool, and not something that is cruel. I like them better than choke chains because it stops a dog from doing damage to themselves. Jackson just gets so excited for other people and animals he doesn't get that there can be danger. He is just a silly lovey bully :)"
BullTerrier,3883zx,CJHEAT,0,Thu Jun 4 14:42:41 2015 UTC,"I think I need one of these. I have to see if I can get em in australia.  I've tried the muzzles over the nose, choke chains and harnesses. Nothing works. I have a little female now also and she's already a crazy puller as well. My wife refuses to walk the dogs anymore and it hurts me inside."
BullTerrier,3883zx,CJHEAT,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:51:23 2015 UTC,"You might be able to ship them there, I am unsure. Try www.sportdog.com, their equipment is fantastic. When we got Jackson we tried the regular leash and collar set up, which he would choke himself to being sick. Then a harness, which are specifically made for pulling I found out after. And then the pinch and I have had great success with it. The first part sucks though because they throw a fit or two in the beginning and you cant let them win. It hurt to watch but I didnt want to stop having a walking companion :) just give good praise and treats help to make it more positive for the dog"

They do have an ""Evertuff"" line that might be worth looking into. Personal preference, but I'm not a huge fan of Nylabones and I know more than one Bull Terrier that has managed to break off and swallow chunks of Nylabone that were later found in exploratory surgery due to obstruction.  Edward also seems to be convinced that they are entirely edible, so, I don't buy them.  Toys will last longer when they're taken up when you're not there to supervise, or taken up if they start getting too rough.  Flirt poles are a good interactive toy.

BullTerrier,36j66w,Ningaboop,3,Tue May 19 19:49:52 2015 UTC,"That is a difficult question to answer without knowing more specifics, so I hope you're consulting with a professional, reward-based behaviorist.  Unfortunately, there can be a genetic predisposition behind dog aggression.  Realistically, you should aim for acceptable on-leash behavior, and don't expect too much too quickly. Keeping him under threshold is extremely important.  With A LOT of patience and time, you might be able to find single play mate(s) that he is proven safe with and allowed off-leash, but it seems to me like an unnecessary risk to allow a dog with an aggressive history off leash with multiple other dogs. In any case, it would probably be necessary to build up to that, as while he might be confident enough with one-on-one with a single dog - two, five or more dogs at a time could be too much stress."
BullTerrier,36j66w,bullterrierlove,2,Tue May 19 21:08:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input.   History - My dog has been attacked by other dogs multiple times. The last attack resulted in 10 stitches to close a deep wound on his chest. So he is understandably scared of strange dogs. However, I've noticed that his aggression to other dogs seems, at times, half hearted. Like if he was given a chance he would attack but then would turn tail and run. Of course this is only a guess and I have no intention of testing out my theory.  He is fantastic on the leash and I'm often able to divert his attention when we're approached by other dogs.  I should add that I live in South America so there are loose dogs everywhere. We can easily encounter 20 off leash dogs on any given walk (not all at the same time but 2 or 3 at a time). But being down here means that I don't have access to a lot of the programs that are offered in other countries. And I dearly wish I could put my dog in some sort of socialization classes but they don't exist here.   I am lucky enough, though, to have a really great dog trainer here who has helped us immensely. It just that, at times, I kind of lose hope of my dog ever going back to being stable and well adjusted around other dogs - hence my question in this sub.   Thanks again for answering."
BullTerrier,36j66w,luigisayshello,2,Wed May 20 14:48:59 2015 UTC,"Take this advice with a grain of salt, but I actually think this would work. First find a dog that his a very happy stable dog, put a muzzle in your dog (make sure that the other dog don't find dogs with muzzles strange), let him play and give him some rewards if he's doing good."
BullTerrier,36hzqp,Remnika,8,Tue May 19 15:06:32 2015 UTC,"I have been very involved with the Texas Gulf Coast Bull Terrier Rescue since 2010, have fostered 5 dogs through them, and am currently a part of the board of directors as secretary.  If you must have a puppy, please choose to go to a breeder and I would only advise contacting breeders through the Bull Terrier Club of America.  These individuals have agreed to abide by a code of ethics.  If they do not have available puppies/dogs, they may be able to direct you to someone that does.  Keep in mind that many reputable breeders only have a litter or two a year, if that, and they may have a waiting list."

Best dog I've ever known (Brought up with at least 4 dogs in house through my child hood)  3) Bought from breeder. Turned out to be completely deaf despite breeder saying they BAER test. When I aked the breeder about the deafness she said I must have done something...Later we found she had bad kidney issues, like very bad - as far as I know the breeder still breeds from that line...  4) Rescue. Amazing dog, still going strong at 15 years old. Had a rough 5 years at the start of his life (I got him at 5 years old) Can be funny with other male dogs but will turn and run if the other male tells him off.  5) Rescue. Amazing dog. Shite time from previous owners and can't be trusted with other dogs but still going strong and getting better every day.

Sometimes my non-mini bully gets a red splotchy belly for an unknown reason, and then it goes away in a few days.  We thought it was from grass, but ruled that out.  We tried ruling out all kinds of things - bedding, rugs in the house, foods, etc and we're still not sure what she is allergic to.. but its a mild allergy, and she doesn't even seem to notice or care.  If she has a 'flare up' we give her 2 benadryl 2x/day for a few days (our vet and breeder both recommended this).  Do your research on benadryl for your pup if you decide to give it a try - don't just take my word for it!"

Pick up dog toys and put them in his toy box-Pickles must root through the toy box to get his favorite bone.   Pick up toys (again!) and put them in the toy box (again!) and Pickles must root through the box to get his second favorite bone.   Rinse and repeat.  Vacuuming is entirely out of the question, as he has a blood feud going with the Dyson.     The highlight of the day was having all the furniture  pushed into the center of the room and him spotting the tennis ball that had been under the couch.   Much hucklebutting ensued.

BullTerrier,331ipv,FasterOnFire,7,Sat Apr 18 16:44:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Austin specifically, but I actually had to move out of a city that threatened to seize my girl and put her down. Bull terriers were lumped in with pit bulls in the city ordinance and I had no idea. This was in Missouri, so I did my research and moved to a suburb that did not have a bull terrier ban. Hopefully you're just dealing with picky apartment managers and not BSL. As far as dealing with apartments and home rentals, I refer to her simply as a ""terrier"", if they persist I'll say she's an English terrier ""you know, like Spuds McKenzie or the Target dog."" Just leave ""bull"" out of it if at all possible."
BullTerrier,331ipv,belyanoch,4,Sat Apr 18 21:44:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah make sure to tell them ""English Bull Terrier, like the Target dog!""  And it's best to have a picture of him/her that looks goofy to show them if they're confused.  (Also have a picture of a pit bull for people who don't know what they are).  When people hear bull terrier like /u/SuperMarioChess says they immediately assume it's a pit bull terrier."
BullTerrier,331ipv,nobodynose,2,Sat Apr 18 19:30:43 2015 UTC,"Just a random question in case anyone else has insight... both of our bull terriers passed their canine good citizen tests. Would this help with us getting a house in the future and avoiding problems with ""the list""?"

Yes, they definitely make 'the list' sometimes, but as said by others, a lot of people also assume you mean pit bulls.   That being said, we've adopted lots of rescues in Austin & it's supposedly a pretty dog friendly city so you might have more trouble than you would with a non-bully breed, but it's not impossible.   ETA: Honestly, I'd probably ask for their pet restrictions in writing rather than asking if ""xyz"" is acceptable."

BullTerrier,30vwt1,jillybobilly,4,Tue Mar 31 03:16:57 2015 UTC,"Forgive me if I'm being inappropriate, but what are the sexes of the people the dog lives with?   You speak in plural when you say you've tried everything to help the bullie, yet you fail to mention who is the other person. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that it's not a man, seeing as you've been recruiting help from male friends, which puts the BT in an all female  household.  Now, my aunt and female cousin used to have this problem with a female dog of hers (admittedly, not a BT), but whenever me or any male friend of my cousin's came to visit the dog would growl bark and throw bites at us.   Now, it wasn't very daunting (again, not a bullie) but it was annoying and made it impossible to relax. The way they solved it,  and i don't know how they came up with thw idea, was to be extra nice to any male in front of the dog. Hug, each other, sit closely, pet the dog together, make the bullie see she has nothing to fear from men and that they're friends.   Also, as always with a bull terrier, be sure to show YOU are her ""pack leader"" and if she steps out of line be it with attacking a man or whatever, reprimand her and don't let it slip by.  Hope that helps!"
BullTerrier,30vwt1,ArgiePig,3,Tue Mar 31 14:39:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry. It's myself (female)and my husband (male), who she adores. She does get on fine with my brother in law as well."
BullTerrier,30vwt1,ArgiePig,2,Tue Mar 31 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"Well that presents a pickle. Have the bullie have as much interaction with men as you can, while showing her that you interact with them too and that it's all good.   Sorry not to be able to help you more, but that's as much as I know.  Best wishes to you and your bullie!"

BullTerrier,30vwt1,unclejunk,2,Thu Apr 9 00:25:13 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem with my male rottweiler when he was a pup, but he grew out of it around a year old, luckily, with the help of his handler.

One thing that really made my female bull bond with me (male) vs my girlfriend, was playing her absolute favorite game - flirt pole.  She will do just about anything to play, including LISTENING to my commands (the rest of the time she pretends she is deaf).  In your situation, it might help your pup if you make yourself a flirt pole, and have a male play with her.. start with a male she gets along with, until she is able to play properly ( video https://vimeo.com/26279876 ), and then have a male that she doesn't particularly care for play with her.  It might show her that other males are nothing to be afraid of, and they are actually fun!  Hours after playing with the flirt pole, my bully wont take eyes off of me and prances around me waiting for the flirt pole to magically appear.  It is a great tool for training, and I think it might help your situation.. give it a try.. if nothing else, you'll have a tired bully after 30 minutes of sprinting in circles!"

BullTerrier,30vwt1,nobodynose,1 point,Fri Apr 3 00:01:42 2015 UTC,"I bet she had some days/1 week max, where she was acting different than normal and that the first case happened during that time. Plus be careful, she will pass 2 more phases until she does 2 years, when you see her different than normal, just try to isolate her for some time and then try to re-socialize her again.  Get her a muzzle, and ask for people (men) to gave her treats pet her and more treats."
BullTerrier,30vwt1,Buddhalite,-11,Wed May 20 15:21:30 2015 UTC,$1200 and you haven't learned how to put the dog on a leash? Seriously don't let people pet the dog.
BullTerrier,30vwt1,Bubblebiter,3,Tue Mar 31 10:12:30 2015 UTC,They come here asking for advice and you act like a douchebag? Big help.
BullTerrier,30vwt1,Buddhalite,0,Tue Mar 31 15:09:24 2015 UTC,I don't see you offering any solutions to the issue.  Did you have something helpful to add?  If the OP doesn't face facts and their dog continues this behavior a day could come where it seriously hurts someone.  Unless the person was trespassing or provoked the dog then the owner is civilly liable. She knows that the dog can be dangerous and posted on a public forum that the dog has attempted to bite others.  This alone in some states carries a fine by not reporting the dog to authorities.  Down vote me all you want.  Nothing I've said is untrue.  Do the research yourself.  Putting the dog on a leash could save the OP a lot of heart break and/or financially.
BullTerrier,30vwt1,Buddhalite,2,Tue Mar 31 15:57:37 2015 UTC,"Your problem is you acted condescending and you didn't bother giving any useful information either.    She said the dog's attacking people that aren't petting her at this point.  You say ""don't let people pet the dog"".  /eyeroll.  Your solution is to keep the dog leashed up and away from people all the time.  That kind of solution doesn't fix the problem.  It just stops the possibility of a lawsuit.  The problem still remains.  If someone has a suicidal friend, your solution should be about how to make that friend not suicidal anymore.  If you followed the same type of advice you gave here you would advise the person to ""Just keep them away from things that they can use to kill themselves.""  Leashing a dog can cause be WORSE.  There's something called leash aggression.  Quite a few dogs get more aggressive on a leash than they do off leash.   The reason why not everyone is offering solutions is because not everyone HAS a solution.  They'd rather offer no solution than what they deem a bad solution (or a temporary fix like yours).    She doesn't want to know a temporary fix; the temporary fix is obvious.  She wants to know how to determine the root cause of the aggression and FIX the problem.  And that's the thing, I don't know what might be causing the problem, hence I have no good advice for her.  If I wanted to give her useless advice like you did, I could tell her ""just put the dog to sleep, buy a new dog"" and pat myself on the back for how edgy and frank I am."

BullTerrier,30g8w5,k2exoman,2,Fri Mar 27 02:48:58 2015 UTC,"Had to help my bully's ears out a bit to stand correctly. The breeder recommended using medical moleskin and cutting it to match the shape of the inside of his ears. It's slightly tacky on one side, but not so much so that it will irritate the skin or rip the fur off...just enough to adhere. We would stick it to the insides of his ears for maybe 2 to 3 hours at a time just to help train the cartilage. It's pretty easy to do, the moleskin is inexpensive, and it didn't seem to bother him nearly as much as the couple of times we did actually tape his ears. The fact that your baby's ears are already somewhat standing, they may just need a little extra help."
BullTerrier,30g8w5,CheddarHeather,2,Fri Mar 27 03:14:55 2015 UTC,"Both of my bully's ears stood up with minimal taping required.  I had to tape Shandy's more often because her ears were thicker/heavier.  Shiner's ears stood up pretty early, around 3 months, and stayed up until he started teething, but it's normal for their ears to go floppy during that stage.  Depends on the bloodlines really.  I found that taping the ears overnight had better results."
BullTerrier,30g8w5,odoyle66,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:06:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for commenting... Chlöe is really teething now... her back molars came in only a few weeks ago so she's around the 7 month mark or so. She's a rescue so not too sure on the age.

They do have an ""Evertuff"" line that might be worth looking into. Personal preference, but I'm not a huge fan of Nylabones and I know more than one Bull Terrier that has managed to break off and swallow chunks of Nylabone that were later found in exploratory surgery due to obstruction.  Edward also seems to be convinced that they are entirely edible, so, I don't buy them.  Toys will last longer when they're taken up when you're not there to supervise, or taken up if they start getting too rough.  Flirt poles are a good interactive toy.  Now, he isn't really destructive with his toys, but I think it is worth noting that we have had a small GoDog Dragon for THREE YEARS that is still for the most part intact.

BullTerrier,2yapds,bullterrierlove,3,Sun Mar 8 01:44:07 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Yes, his behavior can, and may, absolutely change. Yes, there are dogs who hit maturity and are no longer as dog-friendly as they were as puppies.  Longer answer: a lot goes into making a dog what they are at any point in time - age/maturity, genetics, socialization, overall health, environment, training, and management (i.e. the humans).  There are critical fear periods in a puppy's life, and the specific periods are different for each individual dog, but what happens during these periods can shape how the puppy continues to see the world & their personality.  These periods are, generally:   Between seven to nine weeks of age Anywhere from four to six months Again at around 12 months At approximately 14 to 18 months and with some dogs can even be as late as 2 years   The key is to keep socializing - for his whole life, really - and control all situations to the best of your ability.  Build their confidence, avoid traumatic or overwhelming experiences.  If you notice at any point during these times that they seem a little off or weird (shy, grumpy, etc.), don't go out visiting with them. And never, ever punish fear."
BullTerrier,2yapds,okaythisisit,2,Sun Mar 8 03:05:31 2015 UTC,"Mine is an absolute brat to all dogs unless she gets to spend more than 5min meeting them. She's defensive at first, and then once she loosens up she can play with everyone. I wish she'd be nice immediately, instead, but that's just not how she works.  She lived with a basset hound mix for just under 2 years before now being the lone-pup, as the other one passed away recently.  Basically every dog is a little different, if they're socialized more early on: they'll behave better with just about anything/one... Mine is a rescue who we picked up at ~1 y/o, so we don't know her full background... other than that she had puppies stripped from her, and is afraid of some weird objects when introduced."

I'm sure she's being taken care of just fine, but it is a little suspicious that she's in the crate that often. Where I used to work if a dog needed that many ""time outs"" we would have stoped letting them play with other dogs altogether (and informed the dog's owner). It might be better to find a daycare that can handle her personality, so she doesn't have to as much/any time in a crate."
BullTerrier,2y2iy7,Demgoats,2,Fri Mar 6 01:29:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think its the other dogs she's having a problem with, but rather that specific lady.

The dog brings her toys over and over, messes with things repeatedly like barking at the closet door where she knows the tennis balls are kept and just basically is a pest. A bull.

BullTerrier,2y2iy7,Demgoats,3,Fri Mar 6 02:40:52 2015 UTC,"Then I would definitely try a different daycare, it's not fair for you to pay for her to be in a crate that much."

If you want her to be the dog she is now and remain that way then don't do anything.  Personally that's how I raise mine.  Other than leash training for showing and crate training no other training was given.  It's how my parents raised theirs and my grandparents before them.  To you they'll be perfect angels but to others they'll be jerks because they expect the same level of attention.  If you want a different behavior you need to train it.  Skip the day care, crate her at home for free and invest in someone that can train her.  When you do socialize her you need to be there to reinforce her behavior."
BullTerrier,2y2iy7,FurL0ng,1 point,Fri Mar 6 13:28:48 2015 UTC,"I worked at a doggy day care for several years.  Regardless, the fact that you instinctively are worried that your dog is kenneled most of the time means that you don't trust them and should not keep your dog there.  Secondly, you are aware that your dog has issues with other dogs in the day care setting.  Yes!  Plenty of dogs do not do well at day care. Just because you have tried a new day care, doesn't mean the problem will resolve itself.  It sounds like your dog is too obnoxious for its own good.  Day care staff can't baby sit just your dog the whole time.  It takes away from their responsibilities of maintaining the safety of all the other dogs.  Plus, it isn't fair to the other dogs to be bullied all day.  Perhaps consider hiring someone to come by once a day and run your dog?  Help your dog burn off that energy.  OR you could take your dog to a behaviorist who can use techniques to teach your dog, dog manners."

BullTerrier,2xxna7,fortysevenpopsicles,6,Wed Mar 4 18:49:10 2015 UTC,My 12 week old tends to chase her tail at times. I think it's more of a boredom thing at the moment. I'm keeping an eye on it and stop her when I can. Just do the same and see if it slows down or escalates. Just distract your pup with a toy if it starts spinning or biting.
BullTerrier,2xxna7,CJHEAT,5,Wed Mar 4 18:52:35 2015 UTC,^ This is the correct answer OP.

BullTerrier,2xxna7,CrouchJr,1 point,Wed Mar 4 19:03:02 2015 UTC,"Mine did it as a pup, she's now 6 months old and I don't see her doing it any more at all, so I think she has stopped for now at least."
BullTerrier,2xxna7,Devil_Nights,3,Wed Mar 11 02:10:06 2015 UTC,As others have said just keep an eye on it and try to direct that energy elsewhere.  My guy is 5+ years old and still does it when he is hucklebutting but it is only for a few seconds or so like he is trying to decide which direction to zoom off in and can't make up his mind.
BullTerrier,2xxna7,bullterrierlove,3,Wed Mar 4 22:59:08 2015 UTC,"Always redirect to another, more positive activity.  Bull Terriers should never be allowed to chase their tail.  Don't wait for them to do it an extended period of time - redirect, redirect, redirect, but never, ever punish for it.  Canine compulsive disorder is an anxiety-related disorders.  Some dogs have a specific trigger, others exhibit the behavior when they are bored or stressed.    Now, I'm not saying this to be alarming, but I don't feel like enough people take tail chasing seriously enough.  There are cases of dogs who literally spin 24/7. They have zero quality of life. It's completely devastating. Here is an example of one such dog. The woman who took that video said, ""He spun on the leash the whole way to my car, he spun non-stop in the crate, he spun the whole way into the vet's office, he tried spinning while they withdrew the blood, he spun the whole way back to my car and the whole car ride back, and I'm sure he's still spinning now.""  Tail chasing is the kicker, but there are other things that may be OCD tendencies that you may want to be aware of - excessive paw licking, snapping at flies, chasing lights or shadows, fixating on a specific toy.  Don't ever, ever use laser pointers, and don't use the drug acepromazine (which is sometimes used as part of an anesthetic protocol).  You can find a lot of information on www.btneuro.org.  As a side note, a spin or two mid-hucklebutt is not the same OCD spinning."

He just flails around and smashes into all the walls then has a nice little nap.   You may want to try a flirt pole http://www.squishyfacestudio.com/flirt-pole-3/. It's basically a gigantic cat toy for dogs. You can buy them or make one out of PVC if you're  feeling crafty. There's  instructions if you google it. It's a great way to wear out a dog with any sort of prey  drive, which any terrier should have."
BullTerrier,2x15p5,RoguePierogi,2,Wed Feb 25 02:06:39 2015 UTC,"I also use the soda bottle chase thing sometimes.  She loves it.  But even better is the flirt poles.

The other 2 are the smaller kong ones that I use indoors when weather is bad."
BullTerrier,2x15p5,Cryp_Uno,2,Wed Feb 25 12:36:59 2015 UTC,"Flirt pole.  My ladybull loves it, and it tires her out ALMOST as much as going to the dog park.  She loves it so much that I use it as a training tool to get her to sit, down, look (at me, not the toy), wait, and release.  I made my own out of leftover PVC conduit, a piece of rope, and small ripped open stuffed animal so it was basically free.  We don't play hyper/running/jumping games inside our house (we really don't have enough room), and I think our bully gets it so she is calm and lazy inside."
BullTerrier,2x15p5,unclejunk,4,Wed Feb 25 15:49:21 2015 UTC,"Never. They mature a little, depending on the dog, between like 3 and 5.  Getting another is a crap shoot. They MIGHT wear each other out, OR they might just amp each other up and you'll end up with Bull Terrier to the Nth degree, rather than just simply squared.   What you need to do is wear out her BRAIN.  You will NEVER EVER EVER wear her out physically.  Train, train, train, play mind games, teach new tricks, make her THINK."

BullTerrier,2x15p5,Adddicus,1 point,Wed Feb 25 01:39:43 2015 UTC,When we first got Rudy he was so wild. Every night he'd just sprint and spin around. After we added Juno to our family it made everything so much easier. They play with each other all day so it wears down their energy a lot more with minimal effort on our part.   I also love having a fenced in back yard that I can't just open the door to when they're being crazy. In the summer they'll spend hours out there together and never come in. I know this isn't a possibility for everyone though unfortunately.

BullTerrier,2whsp7,pitbulluv,1 point,Mon Feb 23 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"Yelp, then give her a toy and play with her when she takes it.  Praise her and play with her while she has the toy; say the word 'toy' in a happy voice.  Everyone in the family should keep a toy with them all the time, and practice yelp-toy whenever she bites or even puts her mouth near skin, shoes, or clothes.  The whole family needs to get in on the training!  You might want to do a few short training sessions with gardening gloves on.  Eventually she should learn the word 'toy' and go get her toy when she wants chewing, biting play.  Be patient - and good luck!"

Try to determine if it's small dogs, other males or particular breeds, i.e maybe furry dogs that trigger your boy. Then stay away from those to begin with until control is maintained then begin the training process with the trigger dog within the vicinity but still a distance away and move closer as progress is made."
BullTerrier,2vzqjq,CJHEAT,2,Mon Feb 16 04:43:14 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing he is neutered?  Because that would really help.  My dog was neutered at 18 months (when I adopted him); I think the late date made him more aggressive.  Maybe not.  My dog was also afraid and aggressive to other dogs (and still hates un-neutered males).  It took me a solid year of counterconditioning to get him comfortable with other dogs.  Even now, his social skills are not the best.  So here's what I suggest: consult a behaviorist/trainer right away, use a muzzle in public or around other dogs, and plan on working with him on this for a long time.  A basket muzzle works well for us.  Don't give up - a good behaviorist or trainer with experience in this area should be able to help"
BullTerrier,2vndtr,akkemmerer,9,Thu Feb 12 13:28:15 2015 UTC,"I use those cheap polar fleece blankets from IKEA. He chews them up a little bit and makes a nest, but doesn't eat them. I also leave a couple of the really large Nylabones in there so he has something to chew on. Give your bully lots of praise and treats when they're chewing bones and treats, he'll learn."

BullTerrier,2vndtr,Spunelli,3,Thu Feb 12 16:11:31 2015 UTC,"Nope. Mine doesn't get a bed. He even tore up the plastic tray in his wire frame kennel. The last thing I tried and what has stuck is, I laid down a bunch of old sheets in his kennel to pad his legs from the wire frame and he hasn't torn those up. So I added to the collection and just cycle them out and wash them. He is 2 years old now.  Recently I've been wondering if he may be ready for a bed of some kind and I had bought myself a decently large square pillow. One day it had fallen off my bed and I found him using it as a bed, like a good boy. It's a little too small for him but it's got me thinking that he might be ready for a real bed, now. I don't think i'd leave it in his kennel with him. I'll just stick to the sheets."
BullTerrier,2vndtr,snowbaby0413,1 point,Thu Feb 12 14:17:22 2015 UTC,"I picked up a couple of super cheap bed pillows from the store and mine loves those. Although, occasionally she still destroys one whenever we leave her alone for a while."
BullTerrier,2vndtr,unclejunk,3,Thu Feb 12 17:49:52 2015 UTC,"Fleece blankets are good for chewers so even if they do eat it, it comes off in little pieces and not huge strings.  My breeder swears by moving blankets.  She gave us a few and they are super tough and thick enough to be comfy for my little bull.  They are sewn every inch or so in a wavy pattern, so they are hard to tear (even for strong jaws).  The ones the breeder had fit perfectly inside a crate - 2' x 3' or so.  I haven't been able to find any by me, but I'm sure they can be had online."

BullTerrier,2vndtr,Fleabag46,2,Thu Feb 12 22:40:20 2015 UTC,"My bully would do this with every bed I bought her for inside the crate. Eventually I figured out she wasn't eating it she just loves being able to ""dive"" through the stuffing. So now she has a fleece blanket on the bottom of the crate (which she chews occasionally) with the stuffing forming some sort of nest for her. She loves it."
BullTerrier,2vndtr,snowbaby0413,1 point,Thu Feb 12 22:53:07 2015 UTC,"Mine loves to pull stuffing from things too. We've started buying her soft toys from the dollar store because she has them about 30 seconds before ripping it open to pull out the stuffing, lol."
BullTerrier,2vndtr,snowbaby0413,1 point,Thu Feb 12 23:21:12 2015 UTC,"Mine doesn't get a bed, because she just sees them as giant stuffed toys to tear up. You could probably just get some cheap fabric and quick sew a thin one yourself. Mine was 9 months when we got her and she hated her crated. We started giving her treats every time we had her go in there and made sure to put lots of nylabones in with her to keep her occupied. She loves her crate now and even goes in there to hang out when we're home."
BullTerrier,2vndtr,snowbaby0413,2,Thu Feb 12 17:48:27 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! Unfortunately for whatever reason my dog always ends up throwing up in his crate... I don't know why and he is definitely crate trained (just not crazy about going in there) so it's really hard for us to crate him. I may try to get a new kind of crate (those caged ones if you know what I mean) and maybe that might help.
BullTerrier,2vndtr,doberwoman,1 point,Thu Feb 12 18:55:39 2015 UTC,"We had to switch crates styles too. When we got her, she had a metal one and she got super anxious while in it. We switched to the plastic one and she did better. (I'll admit, the treats helped a bunch) Random funny bully destruction story: Her crate is next to the couch and one morning an edge of a blanket fell against her crate and we didn't notice it before we left for work. Welllll, that entertained her for the day, because she had managed to pull most of the blanket through several of the holes in her crate and absolutely shredded it. She looked so happy with herself when I got home, lol. She doesn't do well with plush items."

She like to destroy the blankets, i am glad they are super cheap.  The bed she is good with it, unless i forget it next to her crate, she try to pull it inside (she made 2 small holes on the side of it, easy fix). I wish you best of luck."

When I was young, our English Bull Terrier, Petey, wandered out of our yard and into our neighbor's bushes, getting himself stuck. We looked for him for a long time, thinking he had run away. But no, he was just standing in the bushes, unable to figure his way out. The only way we found him was because there was a leaf ticking his ear, making him shake his head, which in turn made his dog tags jingle!!"

BullTerrier,2v9rsd,sosaysm,5,Mon Feb 9 05:16:08 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your parents aren't giving her any more attention than you are able to give the dog, right now. You(your parents) need to take that thing outside and run him for about 3 miles. She's getting overly excited and wants to play but doesn't know how or ""can't contain herself"". Ask her parents if the dog is running laps through the house constantly. If so, they need to make that dog work... alot."
BullTerrier,2v9rsd,Spunelli,4,Mon Feb 9 14:59:14 2015 UTC,"Good grief, please don't have anyone alpha roll your dog or otherwise physically man-handle her -- that is ASKING to be bitten.  Dominance theory is out-dated and completely unnecessary.  Bull Terriers need boundaries and consistency, but they do NOT require physical force to subdue them.  Dogs submit to other dogs BY CHOICE, they are NOT FORCED into it.  And we're not dogs.  We are people.  We control all of the resources and our dog's access to those resources and there is absolutely no need to use physical force in training."
BullTerrier,2v9rsd,bullterrierlove,3,Mon Feb 9 20:50:46 2015 UTC,"Mine also did/does this occasionally. I've tried firm tones and bopping on the nose and pushing her away... all of which escalated her 'play'  Then I read something that has worked great for me: What would another dog do if your animal bit them overly hard?  They WHIMPER/YELP loudly and sharp. They go limp and move away to stop the play. After a minute or two of ignoring your dog, re-engage and pet. If it happens again, whimper loudly and go away from the dog.  This sounds silly, but the first time I let out a loud yelp, Chlöe looked at me like ""Oh no! (I understand that!)"" and she stopped mouthing on me. I still occasionally have to do it, but in the month I've had her it's gotten so much better. She went from almost breaking the skin, to not at all.   Also, get her mind and body exercising because she has too much energy. Walks/runs, play/dog parks & training. Try a 'wobbler' feeding toy for meals so she has to 'think' to get to her food. All of this has helped."
BullTerrier,2v9rsd,k2exoman,4,Mon Feb 9 17:17:56 2015 UTC,I don't know whether I'm giving you the right advice but I find with bullies you need to be dominant over them. Your dog feels it's getting away with unwanted behavior. If mine are doing the wrong thing I grab them by the scruff of the neck with one hand and the scruff of the lower back with the other and whip them onto the side and use my fist to pin the head down until they submit.  It may sound cruel what I said but I'm not hurting them just showing them who's boss and that I'm in control of everything.
BullTerrier,2v9rsd,CJHEAT,2,Mon Feb 9 06:19:42 2015 UTC,"This. Except they will get right back up and keep testing you. I always have to 'dominate' him about 3 times before he gets it. I noticed this has helped his interactions with other dogs, too. When another dog corrects his behavior, my dog will plop on his side and submit."
BullTerrier,2v9rsd,Spunelli,1 point,Mon Feb 9 14:55:56 2015 UTC,Mine does the nipping too. But never hard. Try to go with a loud OUCH! After a bite and go away for a bit. Try to make her feel guilty about it. It helped me but took some time.
BullTerrier,2v9rsd,wogvorph,1 point,Mon Feb 9 06:58:30 2015 UTC,"My normal response when my pup was very small and very bitey (under 6 months) was to sit on the ground with my legs in front of me, grab her by her shoulders, lightly flip/roll her on to her back between my legs and pin her there (on her back, feet up) until she stopped being mouthy.  Usually I'd rub her belly until she was calm, and after 30 secods  (or more) of her sitting completely still, I'd release my leg-lock and let her roll onto her feet.  This worked REALLY well for a puppy that was learning her boundaries, she is 11 months now, and when I put her in this position, she lays perfectly still and calm until I tell her it is OK to get up.  Pinning her down while she was on her side was ineffective.  She would continue to struggle and snap at me.. the only way was on her back like I described above.  These dogs are mentally stubborn, and you can't hurt them physically with a smack on the rear so don't even bother with that.  It sounds crazy, but a lot of times you have to play to their emotions, make them realize they hurt you and now you don't want to play with them anymore, etc."

BullTerrier,2v184q,k2exoman,4,Fri Feb 6 22:40:25 2015 UTC,I've had two male bullies. The first Bully absolutely hated water. Hated bath time. Hated sprinklers. HATED the water. My current Bully is the complete opposite. He loves running through the sprinklers and getting sprayed with the hose. He'll bark if he's inside and the sprinklers are going so he can go play in them. We even have a little kiddy pool we fill for him during the summer.
BullTerrier,2v184q,CheddarHeather,3,Fri Feb 6 23:55:46 2015 UTC,"Ours does not like water. He doesn't like swimming, baths, sprinklers, etc. He will sit for a bath and tolerate it, but looks miserable the whole time."

I tried everything to find an owner assuming maybe she'd escaped or been let out accidentally but she wasn't chipped and there've been no responses to newspaper and craigslist ads and flyers... doesn't matter anymore because she's picked me! As I had no history she's now been spayed/vaccinated/registered and we've started training her. She does get along with the other dogs but is super energetic.

BullTerrier,2uu8n9,pazimpanet,3,Thu Feb 5 04:46:34 2015 UTC,"All things being equal, brindle is the preferred color (in the colored variety).  That being said, brindle & white is definitely more common than brindle.    Basically, according to Bull Terrier color genetics, if you breed a predominantly white dog, regardless of their mate's coloring, you WILL NOT get a solid puppy - no black & tan, no solid reds, no solid brindles or black brindles.  They will all have a white blaze to some degree (tricolor, brindle & white, etc.).  On the other side of that, you WILL ONLY get solid colored puppies if you breed two solids.  This is due to the S-Series Locus -- Bull Terriers are believed to only have the alleles si and sw and not the dominant S allele that causes true solid color, (si si would be solid, sw si would be colored & white, sw sw would be white). This idea may change with more research, but I have personally yet to see a Bull Terrier that does not have the tiniest amount of white - be it the tip of their tail or toes, or a small dot on the chest.  It gets more difficult when you're breeding two colored dogs where one or both have some amount of white, because two dogs that are phenotypically alike may have different genotypes.  It is hard to guess what colors a specific dog may ""throw"" without their genotype and I'm not sure how many breeders actually genotype their dogs for color and use this information in their breeding.  Health and temperament should always come first.  All of that being said, they can't be too extremely difficult to find because we've had them in rescue more than once.  I can think of three off the top of my head, just with our rescue.    As a final note, the AKC is just a registry.  There are ""AKC breeders"" who are not responsible or ethical.  There are ""AKC breeders"" who do not show their dogs.  If you want a reputable breeder, start with the Bull Terrier Club of America breeder directory."

Not saying you can't find a good white one but this might lead to idea that the brindles are harder to find. I have a brindle girl and the breeder had a mix of white and brindled.

BullTerrier,2u9lew,Tekaknight,2,Mon Feb 9 06:53:21 2015 UTC,"Problably a food problem. Go to your local animal doctor and ask them what you should feed your bully. I wouldt recommend scraping, as that is really painfull for your dog."
BullTerrier,2u9lew,UmbersRevenge,1 point,Sat Jan 31 08:59:45 2015 UTC,"No, it's really not.  There may be some discomfort, but they do this to them while they're awake.  It's extremely common.  They scrape a small area of the skin, like if you fall over and scrape your knee on cement, and it causes mild irritation that clears up within a couple days.  A skin scraping is a diagnostic test for basically any skin condition.  It can determine if there are mites, fungus, etc.  This person needs to take their dog to the vet and have the vet diagnose what the cause of the skin problems are. Period."
BullTerrier,2u9lew,bullterrierlove,1 point,Sat Jan 31 19:38:14 2015 UTC,Im not an expert at these things but my vet told us that it needs to scrape at 6 different spots. And that it would hurt.
BullTerrier,2u9lew,UmbersRevenge,1 point,Sat Jan 31 19:47:26 2015 UTC,"A single scraping from an affected area of the skin should be sufficient.  But regardless of whether it's one spot or six... because it might be painful, instead it's fine to continue allowing a dog to be itchy and full of discomfort while the humans play guesswork at what's wrong??? They can lick themselves raw when they're itchy and THAT hurts."

BullTerrier,2u0bfv,toucherboy,2,Wed Jan 28 21:38:26 2015 UTC,The Bull Terrier Club of America can refer you to a good breeder.
BullTerrier,2u0bfv,Adddicus,2,Wed Jan 28 22:16:34 2015 UTC,"I believe the Bull Terrier Club of Puget Sound adopts rescues to Idaho.   I would ONLY recommend contacting breeders who are members of the BTCA - there is a breeder directory on the BTCA website.  These breeders agree to abide by a code of ethics.  There are health issues found in our breed that can be prevented by responsible breeding.  A responsible breeder health tests their breeding stock, and you should be able to see the results of those tests: heart echocardiogram, kidney UPC ratio, and BAER tests for hearing on puppies over 5 weeks old.    Please remember that the AKC is just a registry body and does not guarantee health or quality. Registration alone is not a good indication of an ethical breeder."

BullTerrier,2oixvp,Devil_Nights,4,Mon Dec 8 02:40:16 2014 UTC,"'Three year old in a dog suit' is not an overstatement. They are curious and they get into everything. A Bull Terrier decides whether or not to put something in their mouth by putting it in their mouth - if you want to avoid obstruction surgery, don't leave them unattended. If you allow them to be bored and fail to supply them with a suitable activity, they WILL find a way to entertain themselves. You will NOT wear them out physically. Mental stimulation is everything.  Laughter is a major reinforcer. If you laugh, the battle is over - they have won. If you laughed at something that isn't really appropriate, good luck preventing them from repeating it.  A large chunk of Bull Terriers will obsess mildly over something or other, but tail chasing/spinning is not cute. Laser pointer chasing is not cute. OCD is serious business.  In short... nothing will prepare you."
BullTerrier,2oixvp,bullterrierlove,2,Sun Dec 7 21:40:10 2014 UTC,"You will NOT wear them out physically. Mental stimulation is everything.     THIS.  I thought two daily 45 minute walks would do the trick, going up to an hour on the weekends.  NOPE.  The only one that got worn out was me.  Mental stimulation is harder because my guy is so incredibly stubborn. If he is not getting anything out of it, after about 10 minutes he is done."
BullTerrier,2oixvp,bullterrierlove,1 point,Tue Dec 9 00:09:07 2014 UTC,"Hahaha well that sounds right up my alley. Thanks a lot, very helpful!! Can you elaborate a little on the OCD aspect?"
BullTerrier,2oixvp,ChalupaKoopa,5,Sun Dec 7 23:26:42 2014 UTC,"Yup.  Canine compulsive disorder in Bull Terriers is considered a genetic disorder, and there is no test for it yet, but there are studies being conducted to find a genetic marker for it. Tail chasing is the one thing that really needs to be discouraged, but there are other things that may be OCD tendencies - excessive paw licking, snapping at flies, chasing lights or shadows, fixating on a specific toy, or for instance, my dog suckles & kneads on blankets. His suckling is also a self-comforting behavior.  It is an anxiety-related disorder, so a dog that has a genetic susceptibility may never exhibit symptoms under the right circumstances. Some dogs have a specific trigger, others exhibit the behavior when they are bored or stressed.  A Bull Terrier should NEVER be allowed to chase it's tail. They should always be redirected to a more positive behavior.  Laser pointers are one of those things that they can just get way, way too focused on and it's not a good focus. It can potentially bring out other OCD tendencies. Another warning, so to speak, would be about the drug Acepromazine, which is often used in anesthetic protocols... in some cases it has exacerbated OCD issues in Bull Terriers.  IMO, it's safer to just avoid it. You can find a lot of information on www.btneuro.org.  To answer the question above about dog-aggression... a lot goes into a dog beyond their upbringing. Positive socialization during critical stages in puppyhood sets a dog up to achieve their greatest potential, but their parentage and breeding definitely plays it's part -- though even the best breeders produce dogs that don't like other dogs. And that's okay. I mean, I don't like most people. :P   I'm secretary of a BT rescue and we don't take in dog-aggressive dogs because our insurance doesn't allow it, but that doesn't mean every dog we take is perfect with all other dogs. Most Bull Terriers won't start a fight, but they'll absolutely join in or finish it, and that's something to keep in mind always."

BullTerrier,2oixvp,ChalupaKoopa,4,Mon Dec 8 02:42:29 2014 UTC,"Paw licking can be a product of allergies too (and the licking can cause yeast), but if there's no underlying issue and they're licking for the sake of licking... yeah. Some do it just out of boredom, too. Pretty sure the act of licking releases endorphins - as does chewing. :D  They are special creatures.

Luckily I have horses, and I just take her out to the barn and let her romp around there. We normally go for about a two mile hike daily. Then hours of fetch each night.. We also have other dogs, and a large 3+ acre backyard which helps a lot. But lots of walks & park time should be good!"

BullTerrier,2nxv76,Edg-R,9,Mon Dec 1 14:09:46 2014 UTC,"We currently have a 3 year old female English Bull Terrier named Midna. We first found out about Atlas, the 1.5 year old deaf male, about two weeks ago. We quickly contacted the rescue club and got in contact with the foster parent to see what we needed to do to add him to our family.   A week ago, the foster parent asked us to visit Atlas along with Midna to see how they interacted. Everything went great! We were ecstatic. We fill out paperwork and paid a deposit so that he could be dropped off by the foster parent a week later. This was due to him needing to be taken to the vet one last time to make sure everything was A-OK and because we'd be out of town for a few days and we didn't want to have to board him, plus the foster parent wanted to check out our house and make sure everything looked ok.  He suffered from an extreme case of Demodex when he was taken in the by the rescue club. He's since fully recovered and is one happy pup. He LOVES getting hugged and licking your chin.  He's deaf, which is something new to us, but during this long week, we've taken the time to read online articles/resources teaching us how to be better parents to him as well as watching lessons on basic ASL and even ordered a small quick reference guide for the most common ASL signs, such as ""good, no, sit, stay, come, etc"".  We're extremely excited and a bit nervous.  Here's another picture of Atlas:  http://i.imgur.com/yxPJ5Mm.jpg  And a picture of his big sister, Midna:  http://i.imgur.com/2diOqmP.jpg"

Since the dog is new to you and deaf, if you for whatever reason need to wake the dog up from sleep... try immediately putting a treat in his mouth to calm any defensive reactions."

BullTerrier,2n6a39,sosaysm,3,Sun Nov 23 16:16:15 2014 UTC,"That young you should be able to retrain bad habits. I'd recommend getting started on crate training immediately and take a few days off work to get her accustomed to her new home. Most bullies I've seen that age adopted out have been because their current owner wasn't consistent enough with training and they are hyperactive pains.  Scud was a huge PITA around that age but now at a year and a half is a lazy potato except for bully runs. I'd check for food aggression too, just so you know what you're dealing with. Good luck!"
BullTerrier,2n6a39,DeLeon54mk,2,Sun Nov 23 17:31:55 2014 UTC,"Yes, if you can't spend at least 3 hours a day with that dog don't do it. These dogs require a lot of attention, especially when you bring them home."
BullTerrier,2n6a39,pitbulluv,3,Sun Nov 23 21:58:19 2014 UTC,"Talk to your local bull terrier rescue, and the veterinarian you plan to use.  They can tell you all about bull terriers.  They are a special breed.   BTs are strong, stubborn, social, high-energy dogs.  If you want to spend time training, playing with, hanging out with, and exercising your dog, a bull terrier will be great.    BTs can be a challenge to train.  They love working with people and are smart, but they define the term 'bull headed'.  A BT who is not exercised or trained can be destructive, over-exuberant, and difficult to control.  Training a BT can be lots of fun if you like working with your dog.  They are great at agility, obedience, and as therapy dogs.  A happy, calm BT is the sweetest dog ever.  BTs like to spend time with their people and will probably want to sleep near you or with you.  Many bull terriers have sensitive skin; allergies and a tendency to sunburn.  Back leg problems are also common."

His coat is abnormally thin thanks to allergies.  But, I don't feel like Velcro is ideal.  Everything else doesn't have a latch for the lease, as we walk him with a harness.

BullTerrier,2m2hr6,DeLeon54mk,1 point,Wed Nov 12 13:02:16 2014 UTC,Could you explain the fear better? What exactly is she doing that makes you think she is fearful?
BullTerrier,2m2hr6,bullterrierlove,1 point,Wed Nov 12 16:49:27 2014 UTC,"If we're walking down a trail and she sees people walking toward us she'll stop dead in her tracks.  When they continue to walk toward us she'll back peddle.  She refuses to move forward.  In certain situations she'll tremble with fear, lay down and just shut down.  She's done this at least twice.  I usually have to pick her up and carry her past the trigger before she's able to carry on.  In these cases I understand that I've let her trigger over stimulate her and it's too late.  She used to growl but I made sure to put a stop to that.  What do you think?"
BullTerrier,2m2hr6,bullterrierlove,1 point,Wed Nov 12 17:02:28 2014 UTC,"Oh no, please don't stop her from growling! Growling is communication, that's all. Dogs growl to let you know they don't like something. If you take away the growl, their warning, then a dog will move straight to their next level of communication, which very well could be snapping.  I really enjoyed this blog post, which is about counter-conditioning & desensitization, if you care for some more reading on the subject... and well, Eileen is a really lovely person.  She also recommends careforreactivedogs.com.   There is a Facebook group for Fearful Dogs.  Have you contacted any breed clubs in your area?"
BullTerrier,2m2hr6,bullterrierlove,1 point,Wed Nov 12 17:18:37 2014 UTC,"Hey,  Thanks for the reply.  It looks like we have a slightly different opinion on growling but I can certainly see your point.    Thanks for the great link and information about fearful dogs on facebook, I really appreciate it.  I'll be sure to check out both.  One thing that cannot be overlooked is how much I've been forced to learn about dogs to help my own.  I've already read 2 books and watched countless youtube videos.     Have you contacted any breed clubs in your area?   I know of no such Bull Terrier clubs in Sacramento.  I'm seriously considering a trainer within 6 months if I don't see any progress with my classical conditioning."

BullTerrier,2m2hr6,Spunelli,1 point,Wed Nov 12 20:45:06 2014 UTC,"I've had mine since he was 9 weeks old. I was thinking about making a post about him being skittish. Mine doesn't cower away like yours but is more 'jumpy'. He hears everything. If it's a windy night the house creaks alot. He could be really relaxed and half asleep but when he hears that creak he jumps out of bed in full kill mode. Scaring the bajeezus out of me, every time. If someone comes to visit and they walk in the house.. at first he's full kill mode. Then when he realizes the threat may possibly be real (person standing there) he retreats but keeps barking. Another time we were relaxing watching TV. He was in a position where he could not see my movements. We were both laying very still for a while then I touched the back of his neck to pet him. He jumped up because I scared him, no barks, he went right back to laying down as soon as he realized it was just me."
BullTerrier,2m2hr6,unclejunk,1 point,Wed Nov 12 22:50:31 2014 UTC,Hey thanks for the response.  How old is your dog now?  Are you doing any training to offset this behavior?  Has he improved since you first got him or has the behavior just been consistent?
BullTerrier,2m2hr6,Spunelli,1 point,Thu Nov 13 00:59:58 2014 UTC,"3 years. Worse, I'd say. I just bought a house. So now he's in a new environment. This new house is alot older and in the country so it makes alot more random noises. He's really been going crazy. Maybe eventually he'll get used to it. Been in the new place for 3 months. Last night we were watching a movie and there was a car crash with some very distinct sounding glass breaking. He was curled up next to me in the recliner and sat his head up barking and looking at the front door. I was really into the action scene so it scared the crap out of me. I don't know what to do about it so I am not doing any training. A part of me thinks its really good that he's on high alert but another part of me wants him to know the difference between a real threat and a fake one."

BullTerrier,2jzyp3,jmarnett11,1 point,Wed Oct 22 15:20:04 2014 UTC,"I recall one thing that could had made him act like this, the other new dog had a protective (funnel) dog collar and I think he never saw a dog with one! lol. If it happens I can risk a little bit further, I'm not seeing him attacking and he already pass for some situations, fortunately he didn't get ""mad"" with other dogs."
BullTerrier,2jzyp3,bullterrierlove,1 point,Wed Oct 22 15:27:40 2014 UTC,"You need to look at the body language more - dogs are very adept at talking with their bodies and barking has a lot of different purposes. I will note that over-stimulated excitement can escalate very quickly into aggression, but that does not sound like what happened here. Going just from what you said, it sounds like you've described a play bow, which is an invitation to play. Some dogs will give a short bark when they're trying to engage in play."
BullTerrier,2jzyp3,bullterrierlove,1 point,Fri Oct 24 16:13:48 2014 UTC,"Usually I'm aware, but lately he changed a bit and I have a harder time understanding him , but thank you, it looked like it, but he is more ""barky"" than usual and even though he is friendly, he is getting into the nerves of some dogs and I don't know what to do, to take him down a step, he is always so eager to play that he gets a lil' ruff if they don't play with him."
BullTerrier,2k088x,jmarnett11,4,Wed Oct 22 16:34:47 2014 UTC,"Do you have a mentor who can guide you? Has your dog been shown to get an indication of how closely he conforms to the breed standard? Will the puppies be microchipped, and would you provide for and take back any of the puppies at any time in their life for any reason?  The health tests that should be performed before breeding Bull Terriers are:   UPC ratio for kidney function, the value should ideally be below 0.1, definitely below 0.3. Most dog breeds are okay with a ratio below 1.0 but Bull Terriers are special!! This is tested at 18 months - 2 years old, and the dog should not be bred prior to this test. I've seen way too many dogs go down at 2 or 3 from kidney failure, although some dogs make it to 6 or 8 before it takes them. Just because you haven't seen anything yet doesn't mean it's not there. Auscultation and/or doppler echocardiogram (more reliable) looking at the heart, by a board certified cardiologist. This can be done at a year old and should be done yearly after that, some choose to do it every 6 months. Palpitation to check for patella luxation (this is a condition where the knee cap slips out of normal position); this ranges in severity and can require surgery in some cases. Puppies should be BAER tested after 5 weeks of age to test for uni- and bilateral deafness. The test is only required once in the dog's lifetime, but if it wasn't done on the dog as a puppy........   Other issues that can arise in Bull Terriers include lethal acrodermatitis, neurological conditions such as sudden-onset aggression, OCD (as mentioned), skin conditions and epilepsy. Can you confirm that EVERY dog in your dog's pedigree was not affected or afflicted with any disease? With breeding, you risk not only losing all of the puppies, but the dam. Breeding done ethically tends to cost more than you're going to get back in puppy sales."
BullTerrier,2k088x,bullterrierlove,3,Fri Oct 24 16:25:57 2014 UTC,Where to start... Is your EBT Purebred and papered/registered with a kennel club? And fully health score tested?  Does he have any odd traits? What is his temperament like? Does he show any OCD tendencies? Such as obsessive tail chasing.
BullTerrier,2k088x,FACEAnthrax,2,Wed Oct 22 19:27:01 2014 UTC,"/u/faceanthrax is entirely right. Do the responsible thing and have your  BT's health screened. The tests can be expensive, but it is the responsible thing to do to ensure that any negative hereditary traits are passed on."
BullTerrier,2k088x,Speed_Decoy,1 point,Wed Oct 22 19:40:35 2014 UTC,"Jack's AKC registered pure bred, as far as the health score I'm looking into it, he's been to the vet and they always say that he's in perfect health no skin issues or problems common to EBT's that I know of, but I will look into the actual score. He's one of the best bull terriers I've ever owned. He's very calm and jolly, he can be an attention whore, but is sometimes shy around new people. He doesn't show signs of OCD, and is very intuitive. He listens pretty well for his age, he'll be a year and a half next month. Jack is on the larger side for EBT he's about 75 lbs, and LOVES to cuddle. He likes to play fetch and is good with other dogs.  He's on the quite side but watchful, never barks at other dogs while in public. My dad has his brother, both still playing pool so to speak, and they get along great. He's a very sweet dog."
BullTerrier,2k088x,luigisayshello,3,Wed Oct 22 20:08:02 2014 UTC,Health tests are the thing that matter most. Start there.

BullTerrier,2jtc5v,KhanneaSuntzu,1 point,Wed Oct 22 17:13:38 2014 UTC,"Generally speaking, the more snug the fit the better it works, so go with the medium... but... make sure the company can exchange it for the large if its too tight.

BullTerrier,2jq86q,jillybobilly,2,Mon Oct 20 04:22:50 2014 UTC,"Mine does it as well. But, I've only noticed it after we've been outside for awhile. So I just assume it's sun damage. As with any animal, white furred skin can be the most sensitive in the sun. I don't pay any attention to it. If it stays for several days with no significant amount of time in the sun then I might be concerned. I'm more concerned about his acne.

We wash her feet after walks, and during spring she normally takes 1-2 iramine per day (mild antihistamines). We have found that giving her a good rub down with coconut oil twice a week, and including a teaspoon of flax seed oil in her breakfast helped massively. All the best!"

BullTerrier,2j2jyy,Devil_Nights,2,Tue Oct 14 03:55:12 2014 UTC,I will try flax seed. I am also going to try keeping it in the fridge so it is solid when he eats it. I think the oil is getting on his nose when he is rummaging in his bowl and it is staying on his skin causing the break outs.

BullTerrier,2j2jyy,Username_uhh,2,Wed Oct 15 07:34:05 2014 UTC,"Sounds like he needs an immune boost, I would suggest sticking him on a multivitamin to help his immune system."
BullTerrier,2j2jyy,Darknessborn,2,Mon Oct 13 00:42:49 2014 UTC,"Only a small portion of what we get from multivitamins is beneficial to the immune system, and in fact there's some new research saying that the benefits are immeasurably small given the miniscule amounts of everything you get. I still take mine every morning though :)  Also, while allergies are a product of a faulty immune system (basically false alarms), they are not caused by a 'run down' immune system and typically do not fluctuate with changes to it. As you probably know, allergies can hit the healthiest if us, and be absent in our most unwell.   Probably the most beneficial supplement for dermo allergies is an oil to promote healthy skin and fur.   A multi probably wouldn't hurt though, particularly one that promoted gut health and hair growth."

BullTerrier,2iwab3,ThatsGoldJerry_Gold,5,Sat Oct 11 05:53:42 2014 UTC,I was so ready to downvote you at first :)
BullTerrier,2iwab3,ThatsGoldJerry_Gold,3,Sat Oct 11 15:34:40 2014 UTC,"I just had to, since earlier that day I was on a walk with mine and a woman was walking her border collie. Her dog started to growl and bark at my bully (mine wanted to play of course, she's 9 months old) when suddenly she pats him on the head and says 'stop it stupid, that dog would eat you with one bite'. So I just imagined that for Halloween, I'll just walk her out, that should bring enough fear :D"

BullTerrier,2hlfuh,Pandora023,3,Sat Sep 27 05:35:52 2014 UTC,I loved that mine would start snoring a good 15 mins before she was actually asleep. The sleep process went like this. Sit somewhere. Figet until her back legs were comfortable. Then lay down the front legs with a loud noise so everyone knows. Then pick a spot to stare at and start to snore. Once she was about to actually sleep she would try to cover her eyes.
BullTerrier,2hlfuh,KSinz,2,Sat Sep 27 15:28:38 2014 UTC,"My guy is the same way. He might be lying down, even curled up, but unless he is burying his face in his bed/blanket/legs, he is not asleep. As soon as I move he is up and ready to go."

But conversely... if i take her somewhere and she gets TONS of exercise... i mean really wear her out.. the she almost always hucklebutts when we get home and then knocks out immediately after  Her technique is all over the place... some days she spins... some days she runs... some days its all of the above  She mostly hucklebutts on the bed... when she is in a running mood she bolts from the bed, down the hall on to the couch... a quick spin then bolts back to the bed and repeats...  she also has a habit of hucklebutting on leash when we are walking up the stairs after a really long walk (4th floor walk up)  heres a short clip of Arya in her element:  http://instagram.com/p/fa9lWiJTAt"

BullTerrier,2he2nd,akkemmerer,3,Thu Sep 25 01:54:03 2014 UTC,"We took our 1.5 yr old mini to the vet with similar complaints. The vet said that the yellow foam was bile because there wasn't any food in his stomach to throw up. So I would suggest paying attention to how much you are feeding him. We feed our mini twice daily, apps. 1.15 cups per meal. He hasn't been sick in a long time."
BullTerrier,2he2nd,Mrsdw3,4,Thu Sep 25 02:12:25 2014 UTC,"This- both of my bullies have done this. It's tough when I put dinner down and he ignores it the gets sick in the morning.  We found out the same way- vet visit, bile seems to be the cause, and then we try harder to make sure he eats."
BullTerrier,2he2nd,FinePointSharpie,2,Thu Sep 25 04:17:37 2014 UTC,He eats though! That's the crazy thing. Once he turned one we switched him over to adult blue buffalo food and he loves it! He chows down both meals and we feed him the same amount as well. It's so strange.
BullTerrier,2he2nd,doberwoman,3,Thu Sep 25 13:13:46 2014 UTC,maybe he needs 3 meals? or snacks between meals.
BullTerrier,2he2nd,doberwoman,2,Thu Sep 25 17:39:14 2014 UTC,Same happens with my doberman if his meals are too separated. Never happened with my bully.
BullTerrier,2he2nd,Spunelli,3,Thu Sep 25 17:37:35 2014 UTC,"I'm in the same situation. I moved to 4 acres. This dog now just RUNS AND RUNS AND RUNS constantly. Where before we used to just cuddle and watch netflix 24/7. I have heard of highly active dogs needing upwards of 10cups of food a day! For now, i'm letting him tell me how much he needs. I keep his bowl full and readily available and monitor his weight. There was one day we were outside ALL DAY, i was working so hard i never stopped for food and i didn't have his food readily available. he got the ""netflix"" once daily amount of food that day. Poor feller was slow, weak, boring, and barfed up mucus. When I increase his amount of food, he's back to running all over the place, CONSTANTLY again."
BullTerrier,2he2nd,k-weezy,2,Thu Sep 25 19:24:01 2014 UTC,"Mine does that when she forgets to eat too. My pit and bull terrier have a weird thing about food, I am sure it is some sort of power strugle, but I cannot make sense of it, but that means sometimes lola does not eat or gets distracted and barely eats, anytime she pukes I notice she did not eat her dinner. weird thatnis seems to be common for the breed. I hope your problem is as simple as that."
BullTerrier,2he2nd,Fleabag46,2,Thu Sep 25 06:21:24 2014 UTC,"Check for any other physical signs of rashes etc. My bully only does this when she's eaten something she's allergic too - like part of a palm frond that she might have been playing with earlier. She was normal, happy and not ""itching"" when she first started doing it at around 7mtha but she would vomit bile for no apparent reason but on closer inspection  she had the reddest skin I'd ever seen!"
BullTerrier,2he2nd,Spunelli,1 point,Thu Sep 25 12:28:05 2014 UTC,Interesting. He has a very red nose and sometimes a red chest. Do you think that could be it? I've never noticed any rashes and even the vets haven't said anything about his nose or chest. He does itch his neck a lot and we stay on top of the flea issue so he shouldn't have those.
BullTerrier,2he2nd,Fleabag46,1 point,Thu Sep 25 13:14:59 2014 UTC,"Careful with this. Bull Terrier's have sensitive skin. Which means, Did you spend extra time in the sun the day you decided to check for red skin? Chances are it's just from the sun. Was the bedding in his bed/kennel moist all day while you were at work? Does he have a red belly? Could be from the kennel. So on and so forth."
BullTerrier,2he2nd,Faible,1 point,Thu Sep 25 19:31:18 2014 UTC,I took mine to a dermatologist. They took a sample of a couple of pustules that she had as well and also performed an allergy test. We give her regular custom made by the vet injections to build her immunity to her allergies which has worked wonders. Eventually she won't need them anymore.
BullTerrier,2he2nd,Devil_Nights,2,Fri Sep 26 04:59:28 2014 UTC,"My mini bull girl used to throw up quite a lot. But I found if I cut down on the fatty things she was eating it stopped it. Now it's really rare for her to be sick, whereas it used to be once or twice a week at one point.  Things like turkey, offcuts of fatty meat, human food that's greasy/oily/fatty etc have all been reduced to things she has rarely.  It could also be allergy related (are there new plants where you now live? Could be from something he's nibbling on), or maybe he's overexciting himself and that's why he's throwing up. Good luck :)"
BullTerrier,2he2nd,bullterrierlove,1 point,Thu Sep 25 16:24:01 2014 UTC,"My guy does this too. He still eats his food, so I am not sure what triggers it. He does not appear to have any other outward signs and the vet has given him a clean bill of health.    I was told to try coconut oil so I have been adding a little bit to his food every day. He hasn't had a incident so far, but they are so rare in the first place that I don't know if it is really helping."
BullTerrier,2he2nd,Darknessborn,1 point,Thu Sep 25 14:19:33 2014 UTC,"How long before/after eating does this occur? What time of day? Do you feed on a strict schedule? Along with going too long between meals, feeding on a routine can also cause this. They start to produce bile in anticipation of digestion -- nothing to digest and the bile has to go somewhere else.  Try feeding more randomly.   I only feed one meal a day, but he gets it anywhere between 3-8pm.    Antacids may also help."

BullTerrier,2gx31n,unclejunk,1 point,Mon Sep 22 12:51:38 2014 UTC,"Does she do stretches while doing the Dino yawn? Scud kind of drags his legs on the floor behind him while doing it every morning. Until he was about a year old every morning he would also get up, stretch, lay half way out of his crate, grumble, drag himself the rest of the way out, then proceed to roll around making odd noises to himself."
BullTerrier,2gx31n,Cryp_Uno,2,Mon Sep 22 13:23:16 2014 UTC,"Yes, this exactly!  Every morning she comes out of the crate like it's her first day walking, head down, ears back.

BullTerrier,2gtq5d,TheZOU,3,Fri Sep 19 02:46:22 2014 UTC,"The first step in breeding is health and temperament! Has he had his health screens, looking specifically at genetic issues within the breed such as Mitral Dysplasia, hearing (BAER), kidneys (Urine Protein Creatinine). How does he measure up to the breed standard? Have you been to any shows to be able to compare and/or ask for feed back about his overall confirmation. Although the money seems very tempting, it's more important to be a responsible pet owner and never use that as an excuse, but I do appreciate your honesty on the matter. As for getting him snipped, I am highly against it! It WILL NOT CHANGE HIS BEHAVIOR! In fact, it can actually make it worse. Bull terriers are very high energy, and unfortunately they pretty much never calm down until at least 2 years old. I can go on and on, but figured I'd make this short and sweet, plus I'm about to pass out! If you have any more questions, or need me to explain more in detail, just let me know!"
BullTerrier,2gtq5d,Username_uhh,3,Fri Sep 19 04:37:49 2014 UTC,"The health tests that should be performed before breeding Bull Terriers are:   UPC ratio for kidney function, the value should ideally be below 0.1, definitely below 0.3. Most dog breeds are okay with a ratio below 1.0 but Bull Terriers are special!! This is tested at 18 months - 2 years old, and the dog should not be bred prior to this test. I've seen way too many dogs go down at 2 or 3 from kidney failure, although some dogs make it to 6 or 8 before it takes them.  Auscultation and/or doppler echocardiogram (more reliable) looking at the heart, by a board certified cardiologist. This can be done at a year old and should be done yearly after that, some choose to do it every 6 months. Palpitation to check for patella luxation (this is a condition where the knee cap slips out of normal position); this ranges in severity and can require surgery in some cases. Puppies should be BAER test after 5 weeks of age to test for uni- and bilateral deafness. The test is only required once in the dog's lifetime, but if it wasn't done on the dog as a puppy........   Other issues that can arise in Bull Terriers include lethal acrodermatitis, neurological conditions such as sudden-onset aggression, OCD (tail chasing/spinning), skin conditions and epilepsy. Miniature Bull Terriers may be affected by primary lens luxation. With breeding, you risk not only losing all the puppies, but the dam -- not so much concern for the owner of the stud dog, I suppose........."

BullTerrier,2gpj53,luigisayshello,1 point,Thu Sep 18 01:12:25 2014 UTC,"Our bully has had issues with food also.  The breeder fed her on costco chicken dry food and she gave us a huge bag of it when we picked up the pup at 8 weeks.  That was working fine until we got about 3/4 through the bag and one day she started having issues with it (diarrhea).  We switched to boiled chicken and rice, which worked well and made her solid again.  We'd be on boiled chicken and rice for a few days and everything was fine, we'd start to gradually mix in other foods and the issues would start - diarrhea, or semi-solid with clear and yellow mucus, or throwing up.  We tried - Orijen Chicken puppy, Taste of the wild Salmon, EVO Beef, and even tried RAW chicken with bones for a week (she loved it).  All had similar results.  The vet eventually prescribed food - Hills Science Diet I/D chicken and rice.  It helped immediately.. but it is almost entirely CORN!  Our little bully became very itchy and had dry skin.  She wasn't breaking out in a rash and her poop was perfectly solid, so we stayed on that for a month with good (solid!) results.  For the last three weeks, we've been mixing in Dave's 'Delicate Dinners' food with good results and we are now at a 3:1 ratio of Dave's to Science Diet and going strong.  We also started giving her some pet probiotics around the same time we started on Dave's.  We give less than the recommended amount, and some days we forget to mix it in the food so she goes without. Doesn't seem to make a difference, so I can't say if the probiotics are working or not, but I'm told it can't hurt."

I know a lot of ppl who have bullies weighing around 35 kg's, but my breeder told me she only breeds for quality not size and my boy should only hit 30. He's at 28 atm and is 10 months old.

I know that's shitty and I'm not trying to make excuses for them but maybe, since she's young, they just got her and are getting used to having a dog. She also might be an escape artist and that's why she's gotten out four times (again, not making excuses for them, just considering other possibilities).  I would talk to them and see what the story is (maybe they can't have her inside until the new floors are put in or something like that). Suggest a better fence or training programs to be helpful. (Unless they're just like ""we don't want dogs in the house"" then it may be time to step in)  If it happens again, and she ends up on your doorstep or another neighbor's, make sure she's ok and hang on to her (not forever, just for an hour or so or until your neighbors get home if they work during the day). Call your neighbors and say you were on your way out to go to the store and that you thought you saw her running around alone. If they say something like ""she got out again?"" after her being away for a while, then I think it's time to step in and consider it as neglect.

Unfortunately we couldn't take her inside because my sister is (VERY) allergic to cats but we gave her food and water and let her sleep in the garage and she stayed for about a week. We went to the shelter and thankfully she was microchipped but it took about a week for the owners to get back to us after constant messages. I felt weird about giving her back because the parents seemed less than concerned that she was missing (and, you know, alive) but the daughter was so happy to see her.

BullTerrier,2drjtd,minkabun,7,Sun Aug 17 01:08:50 2014 UTC,"Exercise and socialize.   Take your bully out on walks, play at the park or in the yard is a must. My guy loves chasing and playing with his basketball and soccer balls. They need to get their energy out or they can be very difficult. These dogs are smart and stubborn so have patience. Kong ball with peanut butter. Kong tire with a twizzler (don't judge me lol he likes them). Show him a treat and hide it. They have a desire to work!  Socialize.... have them interact with other dogs of all types. Dog park is ideal. Have them interact with people young old etc. Car rides help. Lowe's / home depot / pet stores allow dogs and they will get a lot of interaction.   That's all I have for now. Let me know if you have any additional / specific questions."
BullTerrier,2drjtd,TheZOU,2,Sun Aug 17 02:22:34 2014 UTC,"I've also heard there are other ""puzzle"" type games that help stimulate their minds. Do you know about these?"
BullTerrier,2drjtd,TheZOU,3,Sun Aug 17 17:01:30 2014 UTC,Not off the top of my head. I usually just rotate those 3 things. Also to add is kennel training. My guy is 10 months now and I've just got to where I can leave him out when I go to work / out / sleep at night. Start with straight kennel training. Then as your dog gets older start to give them tests. Leave him out for 5 minutes when you go to get gas. Then 15 minutes when you need to run to the store etc. Build up time to where you can leave them out longer and longer. I'm lucky I have hard wood floors and can limit him to this area....and slowly allow him more freedom as he earns it. Good luck!
BullTerrier,2drjtd,wogvorph,4,Sun Aug 17 17:40:09 2014 UTC,"As for a puppy;  BE PATIENT they can be stubborn!   Do not worry about biting. Just show the dog when it hurts and get him many different toys to bite.   Don't worry about pulling/donkey mode (won't walk on a leash) - he/she will get it in time.   And;  Regular meals = regular poop ;) Mine is 7 months old and I'm still saying 'great poo poo' every time she's finished :D She does pee/poop basically on command because of me praising her every time.

BullTerrier,2drjtd,Zip94,2,Sun Aug 17 17:02:29 2014 UTC,"Well, I for example removed all the carpets at the start. Placed all small objects higher or to the room that she couldn't go in. And well, kept her busy. When piglet gets bored piglet will try to eat diferent things :D She's still jumping on the table with front legs but ye, just try to keep things in the middle of the table, especially fluids (it turns out my keyboard isn't a beer fan). Your bully will try to bite on many things, that's how dogs are. Just, for her own safety, keep small things away :D"

BullTerrier,2drjtd,Buddhalite,2,Wed Aug 20 05:16:01 2014 UTC,"Hello! Be ready for a lot of fun - and some serious stubornness. We adopted our bull a year ago, when she was 2 and had not even learned to walk on a leash. With enough patience she still learns a lot. And she learns it fast if its fun.   The main problem is to drain their energy. We can walk for hours, and she just doesnt seem to tire. Playing with other dogs, running free in the forest or riding bikes with her all work well, though. She needs fun and challenges more than excersise, it seems. Our dog has a lot of fobias, and balls and toys like it are unfortunately one of them.   What works really well is filling a Kong with some good stuff, like liverpatè, and then put it in the freezer for a while. In the beginning she spent 2 hours on it - and was completely drained afterwards. Now shes done in 30 min, but its still great.   I bought a puzzle board for my mothers Dachs, and tested it on the bull first. She just didnt get it, and got more frustrated than amused. But like i said, she was severly understimulated for her first 2 years, so she might be a bit slow."

I spoke to my breeder and she laugh and said the vet was an absolute dickhead for saying that cause for one, he's still has puppy teeth and second he's going to risk putting a 3 month pup under anesthetic for braces.  When I moved houses a month later I asked the new vet that I go to and she even laughed that the other vet was putting pressure on me to do that.

BullTerrier,2cqgf1,ashV2,2,Wed Aug 6 01:00:14 2014 UTC,"I know it sounds silly and many pet owners hate doing this...but putting a cute outfit on your dog if weather permits is one way to get people to look past the muscle of a Bull Terrier. Even a colorful collar helps (if you have a chain collar or leather or even spike collar it can look more imposing).   Another thing you can do is stop and chat with any neighbor with dogs that you can. Bring your dog, show them how good he is without having to say a word. Educate them by example. Go on frequent walks when lots of other people are out. Go to parks and let anyone who asks pet your dog.  Some people I know buy Therapy Dog vests for their dogs (even if their Bully is not really a therapy dog) and it makes them seem more approachable to people who don't know better :)"

The focker never walked the dog for god sake.   I really have to train him better so it appears that he is well taught, he is but he can be more stubborn that he can be obedient."

She said it's quite common in the breed especially for those with a strong roman nose, she noted having one with a proper bite was hard to get and is important for show.  She had two hold backs from her previous litter when I was there that she was waiting to see how their jaw sat as they grew, one of which I know she then sold on as a pet only dog, due to the jaw not being right for showing.  Might be worth talking to your local club and the breeder to find out what ramifications can come from the jaw show wise. I'm not so knowledgeable on the subject, but thought I'd share what I had heard. :)"
BullTerrier,2ci0ps,FACEAnthrax,2,Sun Aug 3 18:55:24 2014 UTC,My dog had a little of this growing up but it turned out fine.  It's fairly common for teeth not to line up just right until they grow into their bite.  That left side looks a little more extreme and I'd keep talking to the vet and possibly a local breeder about what to do for it.
BullTerrier,2ci0ps,rawcaret,2,Sun Aug 3 20:20:22 2014 UTC,Mine is like that as well. It did look awful as a pup but it seems to have worked its way out.

You can actually avoid that from happening by pulling out 2 bottom canines at the right moment, milk teeth ofc. Not that i did it, it's cruel but some breeders actually do that if they want proper teeth on their dog.  The problem is that some dogs develop really strong milk teeth and they don't fall out when they are supposed to. By doing that they block the natural way of teeth development, so they don't grow to the sides of the jaw but into it."

BullTerrier,2c5gt5,Pandora023,2,Wed Jul 30 16:54:20 2014 UTC,"Some bull terriers suffer from extreme OCD which manifests in tail chasing. It is hereditary, so first and foremost I would contact your breeder and let them know of this issue (any dog that displays even the mildest form of tail chasing should not be bred for this very reason). Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do, but you can try to cope with it. I would talk to your vet and see about medicating him. I know that might sound scary, but that combined with behavior training will help ease the issue. Do not intervene with any form of punishment, like a shock collar or prong, that will only exacerbate the issue or create another. Simple things to intervene while he's spinning are toys and your interaction, even something as simple as scratching his butt to get his leg shaking. There is no simple answer and it's going to be tough, but I wish you the best of luck and hopefully he is able to ease up on the spinning."

Do they literally just decide to chase their tail and never stop? What issues arise from tail chasing?"
BullTerrier,2c5gt5,FACEAnthrax,2,Sun Aug 3 18:59:07 2014 UTC,"Tail chasing, also referred to as spinning, is a form of canine compulsive disorder. Bull Terriers are prone to suffering from OCD, and our breed is one that tail chasing is most often seen in. It is considered a genetic disorder, and studies are underway to find a genetic marker -- with which, hopefully, a test could be developed to test dogs prior to breeding them.  I have seen cases of dogs who literally spin 24/7. They have zero quality of life. It's completely devastating. Here is an example of one such dog. The woman who took that video said, ""He spun on the leash the whole way to my car, he spun non-stop in the crate, he spun the whole way into the vet's office, he tried spinning while they withdrew the blood, he spun the whole way back to my car and the whole car ride back, and I'm sure he's still spinning now.""  Other dogs may have triggers, or only exhibit the behavior when they are bored or stressed. It is anxiety-related, so a dog that has a genetic susceptibility may never exhibit symptoms under the right circumstances.  They also may self-mutilate. Many of the dogs who end up having their tails docked is not because it stops the spinning (docking does not cure tail chasing), but due to causing themselves serious injury. If the dog cannot leave the injury alone long enough for it to heal, the infection could kill them.   A Bull Terrier should NEVER be allowed to chase it's tail. They should always be redirected to a more positive behavior.   You can find a lot of information on www.btneuro.org."

When he first arrived he'd tail chase any time he was awake (along with peeing everywhere and anywhere), ignoring toys, treats any people. He's been castrated now & gradually over he first 3 or 4 months it decreesed. Can't say for certain what caused it but I provided a very chilled atmosphere for him along with plenty of ball chasing. Now if at home he rarely goes spin crazy but still does it if we are staying with friends.  given he was a rescue dog and has a few signs of previous abuse I can only presume having a safe home and no bollocks is the cause."

BullTerrier,2be3cf,Username_uhh,2,Wed Jul 23 04:15:29 2014 UTC,"You don't typically see them because they are not to standard for show/breeding. It's a recessive gene, so most of the time they randomly pop up if both parents are carries of b genotype. Now and days I've been seeing a lot of people purposefully breeding livers to livers, labeling the pups as rare colored and selling for a ton more. I honestly don't understand that logic personally, but I don't need to go on a rant, lol. I personally love the livers, but there hasn't been a bull terrier I've seen that I haven't fallen in love with! Do you have a pedigree for your pup? Curious to know if there's any Anne Dees in the lineage."

A lot of times when my pup has done things like that, it seems that it's as simple as introducing that person to him.  If I don't let my bully know that the other person is a friend, or non-threatening, then my pup will be little hesitant to approach that person.  He trusts my judgement and if I say the person is okay, he will generally lighten up.  Try to let her know that it is okay, before she gets too defensive.  If the pack leader shows her there's no worry, then there shouldn't be any worry for her either and she'll recognize that.  A nip is a precursor for something more that's about to come.   All of the places that these incidents have happened, they are more private quarters for her so that may be a reason why she is not distracted enough to take warning."

For about six months we gave Stella all of her food from one,  took an hour a day and wore her out. Plenty of running and lots of new smells will do it too. It won't be long before he settles,  fear not...  In the mean time, provide  plenty of options for toys,  with Stella,  we let her take what she wants from the recycling (within reason) which means constantly new toys and great variety on the cheap! Another thing,  once he is desexed, things will settle big time too. Hope this helps."
BullTerrier,2aubzw,Darknessborn,2,Wed Jul 16 11:04:58 2014 UTC,"It does help. I feed him minced meat so ill have to get goodo biscuits to put in a Kong instead. With toys he has a few at the moment but he plays with it for 20 minutes then it lays around and that's it. I'll get him desexed at about 9-12 months,  he's 8 now and counting."
BullTerrier,2aubzw,Darknessborn,1 point,Wed Jul 16 11:24:37 2014 UTC,"You should also consider the amount of food you give him for the level of exercise he gets,  for instance Stella gets about 5-6 chicken wings and some carrots normally,  lately she has been house bound with a bad ankle,  and if we don't cut her food back she is mental...   Let us know how you go,  did you try the recycling trick? Milk containers are great,  we also let Stella lick out yoghurt and cream containers etc which takes some time. Another thing is raw hide bones..."
BullTerrier,2aubzw,Darknessborn,1 point,Wed Jul 16 22:06:03 2014 UTC,My breeder told me too feed him twice a day 500g raw mince with a cup of dry biscuits added. The recycle trick does work.

Exercise is a walk to the park and a free run for 1/2 but it's winter at the moment in Australia so it's dark and cold early on. His energy level is off the charts. I get tired watching him.

As for the shock collar, I would never suggest placing it on your dog with a metal training collar, it's in the right location, other then the prongs which I'll assume has slide over.

He puts his butt in the air and bounces in front of the other dog. If he is aggressive , he walks very close with his chest out and is quiet and tense with his tail only moving a little bit. Honestly, we never tried letting him play with smaller dogs. We did have to work on his play style because he was being too rough and grabbing ears and faces. We gave a yelp when we saw it and if that didn't work a firm ""no"" and a scruff pinch. And if he did it again we made him sit next to us and wasn't allowed to play for a time. Eventually he understood that that behavior meant he wouldn't get to play."

BullTerrier,2a25pu,luigisayshello,2,Mon Jul 7 16:28:24 2014 UTC,"I went to puppy training hoping to solve this problem - so maybe not the best way, but it worked for us!  What I was suggested by the trainer (who trains the AKC Canine Good Citizen Test Dogs) was to put the loop of the leash in your non dominant hand, and let the leash cross your body, Like this person is holding their leash.  This way, when the dog stop moving, you are not yanking them to keep going, but your body weight and momentum kind of keep them moving when they fall behind. Bring treats to coax them and reward when they walk. Be excited when they do what they are supposed to.  Its super embarrassing to feel like you have the only dog in the world that wont walk, but they will! Bruce was HORRIBLE with the stopping and being dead weight...but now, he trots along side me like he knew how allll along. :)  Good luck!"
BullTerrier,2a25pu,FinePointSharpie,2,Mon Jul 7 17:11:37 2014 UTC,"I'm not even embarrassed, I'm frustrated, because that part of the walk where he stops the most is the only path to the part that he can walk freely and exercise.   I used to walk that way but he only pulled, and pulled. I will try the EZ harness. And tomorrow I will train a little bit with him and try to make it fun. Today for me it's impossible.   As for the trainers, I'm not in US plus I saw some ""trained"" dogs and the methods and the dogs are just crazy plain stupid, so here I will try to do my own training.   On the street I don't know if I should make it fun and excited even if he pulls, and correct them with a harsh no, or just silent and giving him corrections and praise him when he walks like he should. The problem is that he likes praise but it prefers to smell the bush right beside his head and he simply don't want treats during walks.   How was the training? Did you see the methods?"
BullTerrier,2a25pu,FinePointSharpie,2,Mon Jul 7 20:24:58 2014 UTC,"I understand completely. It makes you not want to take them for walks when they wont walk. Deep breathes.  I actually was there for training, she was more training me, not the dog, if that makes sense. I went out and bought some really really good treats (I even cooked up some plain chicken bites). Something the dog would consider ""high value"" to get him to do what I wanted.  I thought about the EX Harness, but really, its not about the harness- its about you and the dog.   What I did when Bruce would stop and lay/sit/dead weight on me was stop moving myself and kneel down with a treat out to my side and say ""lets walk"". usually, he would come walking over and I would give him the treat, praise/pat his head and immediately get up and continue walking.  If he pulls - which is rare! - the trainer said you continue to hold the leash (as in the picture from my earlier post) and STOP moving. you become the dead weight and say ""UH OH!"" loudly and seriously. until he sits or returns to your side, you are not to give him treats or pets or anything.  She said that praise for correct behavior and nothing, a no, or an UHOH! for unwanted behaviors. NO yanking. Also she says that making the training sessions short - like 15 mmins at a time is helpful. dogs, like people, get bored and frustrated too.  You (and your pup!) can do it!!!"

BullTerrier,2a25pu,Username_uhh,2,Mon Jul 7 21:54:41 2014 UTC,"How old he?  So, the trick is NOT to treat, if you treat it's going to take longer for you to stop the behavior. The reason is because, ""Hey! Every time I stop, I get some food!"". All you need is either slip lead and a toy, I prefer a simple tennis ball or something that squeaks. As soon as he stops, don't look back or give him any type of attention, start bouncing the ball or squeak the toy, it will get his attention and bring him forward to continue the walk, but don't give him the toy until after he has moved a few paces with you."
BullTerrier,2a25pu,Cryp_Uno,1 point,Tue Jul 8 03:22:53 2014 UTC,"He just don't want food even if I give him, a toy actually worked, but it was so smelly and dirty that I had to put it in the trash, I'm getting one when I order the vitamins for him.   When he stops can't I do that and use some playful ready words and tone? I find that the more I'm hard on him, the more stubborn, unconnected, frustrated, unhappy he gets.   Today I will try the tennis ball.  P.S. He his 4 Months old, the puppy with (probably) demodex, Napo's."
BullTerrier,2a25pu,Darknessborn,1 point,Tue Jul 8 10:58:12 2014 UTC,"You can't acknowledge him when he stops, if you do so it's Ok'ing the behavior. The idea behind it is that he needs to pay attention to you at all times, and not the other way around. You can give him phrase after he moved forward again for the toy, but not until after he goes a few steps more. This breed is very hard headed, and since he's only 4 months, brace yourself for his stubbornness and just don't give in."

When i am gone both are in crates.  3) i seen a few with sensitive skin (mine need sunscreen), many white animal some are deaf, my breeder told me to be careful because they tend to chew and eat on everything so they can get stomach problem often. (lucky me it did not happen yet)  4) I feed mine only raw meat (80% muscle meat, 10% bony meat, 10%organ meat (only half of organ can be liver)) and natural supplement (fish oil, coconut oil) and as treats plain greek yogurt with some fruits in it, and they also go crazy for ""baby carrots"". Both my vet and breeder agrees with the diet of my dogs.  If you get a white one, do not bath it too often even even if it is dirty, try to just do spot cleaning with a wet towel :)  When you bathe the dog avoid non-organic products that may irritate the pup's skin."
BullTerrier,29v8q7,doberwoman,2,Sat Jul 5 03:31:38 2014 UTC,"At what point did you start feeding your dog a raw protein diet?  My pup just turned 1yr. a week ago and I'm going to transition him to adult food.  But if I can transition him to a raw diet, I'd much rather do that."
BullTerrier,29v8q7,chapastyle88,1 point,Mon Jul 7 15:10:33 2014 UTC,"I started feeding my doberman raw because he was underweight even if fully healthy (we did countless tests at the vet and they were all negative). I tried many brand of kibble, wet food, grain free kibble... nothing made him gain weight. So i read a lot in many different forums and they all said i should try raw diet. I made research for two months and then made the switch. (there is no transition because kibble and raw don't mix well).  After 6 month of being raw fed he became to have a better looking shape. Two years later he is looking about perfect. Not to mention he have a shinier coat, pearly white teeth, no gas, and almost odorless small poo.   Having such great experience with raw with my doberman, i started my EBT on raw as soon as she was home :)  She is a really good looking big muscular 6 month old girl."
BullTerrier,29v8q7,doberwoman,1 point,Tue Jul 8 02:59:39 2014 UTC,What kinds of meat do you feed? What cuts and kind of meat? How often do you feed them and what amount? What does it cost you?
BullTerrier,29v8q7,TotaLibertarian,1 point,Sat Jul 5 19:16:20 2014 UTC,"EVERYTHING! All type of meat that we can eat, as for cut, i like to feed as whole, or big parts but more than often they get chicken quarters, steaks, chunks of liver, spleen, raw bones etc.   As for quantity, i feed puppy between 8-10% of her own weight, or 3-4% of her estimated adult weight. My doberman is on the lean side, fully healthy but he do not keep weight since he is a pack of nerves and always moving, he is 5 years old and i feed him 5% of the weight i'd like him to be.  as for the cost, well i am in butcher school, i get some meat for free ( most people can do that too if they call slaughterhouses, meat transformation plants for frozen burnt meat, which is still pretty good for the dogs) Visit your butcher too! Sometime they can make great deals on big bundles! (the more you buy the cheaper it is.) Asian market have super super cheap meat and all sort of organs that is rare to see anywhere-else.  If you have Facebook, this group is AWESOME!  So much information in a better english than i could ever speak. https://www.facebook.com/groups/rawfed/?fref=ts"
BullTerrier,29v8q7,doberwoman,2,Sat Jul 5 22:44:09 2014 UTC,"1) IDK how fucked is the breed that people see and talk about to you, from what I know and the dozens of bullies that I known since I have mine, that thing is not even possible. With other dogs it's possible. With people is so improbable as a cow going to space while dancing the marcarena. It's simply not in the breed character, it just simply isn't.   They require you and walks (+socialization, I can't express the disapointement when my puppy don't see a dog), any house is good enough.  Choose a good breeder. But even in good breeders they can have problems.The parents of mine don't have any problems and mine appear to have some (fungus, apparently some environment things). Give good kindle to him grain free, at least 50% of heath problems can be prevented with this. I read the doberwoman part, and a good antiallergic shampoo is good enough. Mine loves bushes, and his baby belly sometimes gets to ruff, and a belly bath is enough to normalize things when it's to ruff.  Other advice, if your puppy is not seriously ill, always wait 1 day if it gets better wait 2 more. I had some serious scared moments with mine, but it wasn't nothing more than usual stuff.   They really are the best, I have mine snoring on my ear right now with his belly up. They are rather odd lovely beasts, and you see something new with and in them everyday. It's a joy to see them playing with other dogs and the love they have for people and the dumb thousands of ways they have to show."
BullTerrier,29v8q7,luigisayshello,2,Sat Jul 5 22:50:24 2014 UTC,"For the correct breed standard, I would check out the AKC bull terrier example (or FCI if AKC doesn't apply to you). This should give you a good idea for what to look for in the parents of the pups so you don't get the runaround from a breeder. I've been seeing a lot of miss marked dogs being breed and the puppies sold as ""champion bloodlines"" for crazy amounts and in essence those buyers are getting ripped off. As for health screens, there are four main screens any breeding pair should go though, this breed has health issues as with any pure bred, so health tests are vital to save time, money and most importantly heartache down the line. Any reputable breeder would be more then happy to show you the results of all, as well as be able to explain what exactly they are along with the health issues associated with this breed. If they can't, run, run far away!! The first is a BAER hearing screen. I know of adults who have not have it done, but the puppies should be tested for deafness prior to being sold, unless otherwise noted (I thought my first bull terrier was deaf, he was just stubborn). Next is heart health, most common in the breed are heart murmurs (Mitral Dysplasia), this should be done with a doppler screen of the breeding pair to ensure less chance of passing on the defect. The puppies won't need a doppler screen for heart murmurs, as they are to young for that screen, but they should have an auscultation screen, in which the vet listens for a murmur. Then comes kidneys, both dogs should pass a Urine Protein Creatinine to make sure their kidneys are in great shape, as kidney issues are also an issue in this breed and can be passed on from a parent. And last, but not least, checked for luxating patella, which is the slipping of the knee. If you have a bully with LP, it can be very costly. I don't want to scare you away from this amazing breed, but you should be made aware of some issues that can possibly pop up in this breed and if you decide on dishing out the money for one (which can be a pretty penny) you might as well put it toward one that was responsibly bred to save you health costs down the road."
BullTerrier,29v8q7,Username_uhh,2,Sun Jul 6 06:59:02 2014 UTC,"haha! Your comment about Stubborn not deaf got me - My father used to watch Rocky while I was away and was absolutely convinced he was deaf. He had me take him to the vet to see about getting a hearing test done. I knew he wasn't deaf- he always responded to me.  So me and dad pack the dog in the car and go off to the vet. We get there and explain my dads concerns. My dad is bringing up BAER tests and ear cleanings and all that rot...  The vet picks up a a pen and drops it on the floor behind the dog - who immediately pricks up his ears, hearing the sound. ""Not deaf"". and we were on our way haha..."
BullTerrier,29v8q7,FinePointSharpie,2,Mon Jul 7 21:03:31 2014 UTC,"It amazes how good they can fake it, the whole time I thought he was deaf he was really just being a typical bull terrier.... actually he was being an asshole!"

BullTerrier,29v8q7,FinePointSharpie,2,Sun Jul 6 11:24:23 2014 UTC,"1- Not mean, but their excitement can be unnerving. Mine likes to yowl and talk when people wake him up or come into the house- no barking, just yowling and talking. MY last couldn't be bothered ot even see who was coming through the door- I agree with figtoria, horrible watchdogs lol   should be a-okay, as long as you are walking them, taking them to play a few times a day and potty breaks. (especially when puppies- they can't hold it for long). Crate training is a good thing, it gives them their own space and they can relax in their while you are away. Your belongings/walls/mail/chewable items will learn the hard way otherwise :)   3- Skin issues (sores spots, pimple like things), allergies, deafness (white ones) are pretty common. My last bully had very very serious kidney issues (which we weren't aware of until it was pretty late stage...) choose a reputable breeder. this should be helpful. read up.  I feed blue buffalo and occasionally some raw veggies and meats. good sources of protein. It make sthem helllllla gassy, but I would rather deal with stink and have a healthy pup.  They are chewers. If they are being too quiet- they are probably doing something they shouldnt be. Protect your shoes/clothes/couch/ etc.  Super lovely dogs :)"

BullTerrier,29v8q7,Cryp_Uno,1 point,Fri Jul 18 20:06:36 2014 UTC,"My 15 month old bully has not shown any signs of aggression since I got her at 8 weeks.  In fact she is probably the friendliest/most social dog I have ever come across in my life.  She has, however caused a few minor injuries to people with her friendliness. Ha  Attempts to ""jump kiss"" have left friends with a busted lip or two.  LOL.   She will bark LOUD at anyone that walks past my apartment door but if I open the door she wags her tail and says hi to the same person she sounded like she wanted to kill seconds before. I live in a small 1 bedroom apartment in brooklyn, NYC.  The space is fine, but I make sure she gets PLENTY of exercise daily.  Long walks, dog runs, fetch in the park, etc.  The times I dont give her exercise she gets a bit restless and can get destructive.  Luckily she destroys her own toys and not any of my things. Skin issues and allergies seem like the most common things people discuss.  Mine definitely has some skin issues but nothing that sunscreen doesnt fix No advice for ya here.  I am considering switching to a raw diet.  My bully is PICKY and gets bored if I feed her the same food day in and day out.  Finally switched to Taste of the Wild dog food and she seems to LOVE it (so far)   Prepare to laugh a lot and also prepare to pull your hair out in frustration in the very same breath.  They can be STUBBORN at times beyond belief and right when you are about to lose your mind they do something ridiculously funny that makes you laugh instead of cry.  I know its been said a few times already... but if you cant exercise your bully enough prepare for some mayhem inside"
BullTerrier,29v8q7,JessPeachy,1 point,Fri Jul 11 18:26:56 2014 UTC,"I am about to get my third male bull terrier. Both of my bull terriers before LOVED all humans. They loved annoying them the most. This breed has LOTS of energy and need to be entertained. They will not be ok with you coming home from work and wanting to sit and watch TV. They need a good run everyday. If you exercise them everyday, apartment living will be fine Unfortunately, my last bull terrier just passed away at 4 from Kidney Disease, which I have learned is common in bull terriers. However there is a test you can perform on their parents (UPC test) to determine if your bull terrier will have this disease or not. Also they can have skin issues. Usually need sunscreen on their nose. Honestly, I just fed my bull terriers high quality dog food. Go to a pet store, the dog food sold at grocery stores for the most part is shit. They are the best breed you could ever own. They are so loyal and will make you laugh everyday. However you have to spend A LOT of time with them. They demand it. I will never have another breed."

Long term behavioral training, diets, etc. all failed. Eventually he started to really bite me and we had to make the decision.

I fight fire with fire. I made him lay down in a submissive position on a ""walking road"" in a park where there is a lot of dogs. i would correct him everytime he try to lift his head from the ground to look at other dogs. The first day went ok, he growled or looked at the first 15-20ish dogs, then he got bored and would not even care and stayed in a submissive state of mind.  I did that 2-3 days in a row, then i bring him in parades and festivals to give him a people/dogs/noise bath and desensitize him. He is now pretty good. Sometime a little aggressive/dominant with unaltered males but there was no bad incident."

BullTerrier,29njkb,figtoria,3,Wed Jul 2 15:10:34 2014 UTC,Your breeder is correct in that their ears should start to stand up around 3 months and that massaging them will help with the process.

BullTerrier,27rrji,ThatsGoldJerry_Gold,1 point,Tue Jun 10 17:06:26 2014 UTC,half-dollar sized hole on his chest     What happened?
BullTerrier,27rrji,becausewine,2,Wed Jun 11 04:34:37 2014 UTC,"We really have no clue. The only two options we can think of are that he either got stabbed by one of the bushes he likes to trample at high speeds or there was a something sticking out of the fence that caught him. Either way, we never found the object that caused it."
BullTerrier,27rrji,ThatsGoldJerry_Gold,6,Wed Jun 11 04:41:15 2014 UTC,Bully's really have no regard for their own body. It's crazy. They're like a giant battering ram.

BullTerrier,27rrji,Spunelli,2,Tue Jun 10 14:07:33 2014 UTC,"He has officially knawed down to the ground, every single bush or shrubbery. About 8 packs of underwear. He has chewed the adjustment bar on my computer chair and tried going for the feet. He nibbled on my Pixar hard cover book but I caught him in time before he demolished it.  One time I was improving the fence so he couldn't jump over it, anymore and I left extra metal fence stakes in a pile next to the house. He was outside with me while I was making the fence bigger. I turn around to check on him (because.. well.. he was being silent and THAT means trouble) and the lil shit grabbed a metal fence post from the pile and dragged it to the middle of the back yard where he was sunbathing and chewing on it.  Other than that, nothing major. He just likes to jump over fences and run all over the neighborhood. I haven't even had a trash can massacre, yet. He's 2."

Luckily, the apartment manager liked me, and said they were going to be replacing the carpet anyway.  Other than that, I've been lucky. No intestinal blockages, no major injuries. He eats like a pig, though, so that costs me a fortune."
BullTerrier,27rrji,FACEAnthrax,2,Tue Jun 10 23:12:32 2014 UTC,"Speaking of costing a fortune with food. My breeder told me to feed my boy 500g raw mince and 1 cup supercoat biscuits twice a day. He's only 6 months old, so you don't need to feed as much when their older. It costs me $1 a day for the mince and the biscuits are $22 for 8 kg's."

BullTerrier,252jz1,luigisayshello,7,Thu May 8 20:23:24 2014 UTC,"Peeing:  Watch the dog like a hawk, pick him up as soon as he squats and put him outside.  Every time.   When you take him out of his crate, the first thing you should do is carry him outside.  Reward him (treat and praise) when he successfully goes outside.  It's exhausting but you have to do it until he gets it.  Make a schedule.  Biting:  Put your hand around his snout and push his lips under his top teeth so he bites that instead.  That should be enough for him to get the picture.  Don't let him bite anything that isn't a toy.  It only takes one jerk to get ""bitten"" for you to get sued or for your dog to get put down.   How do you play with yours how do you correct him and reward him? What are the best practices?   Correcting and rewarding is the only way to get a dog to behave the way you want.  Whether you realize it or not, you are training your dog at all times.  Consistency is rule #1 - Don't let him bite your pants.  He doesn't know the difference, like you said."
BullTerrier,252jz1,rawcaret,1 point,Fri May 9 13:54:12 2014 UTC,"Peeing: I can't get him outside, apartment and his vet says that he only can go out when he his 3 Months and with the 3 shot. But the rest was what I was missing, makes total sense.  Biting: I just did what you said he just get madder, after 2 minutes he picked something in the floor hallway (it's the only outside that he can have) and I had to go on the throat to pull out wtf he had picked and he bitted me hard, I would had bite me to, but for this specific what could I do?  The last one, I'm already doing that, no biting in ourselves. When I correct him with voice I use his name but with an hard tone, should I use other word or doesn't make much difference? Apparently he knows the difference of tones."

BullTerrier,252jz1,Pandora023,2,Fri May 9 16:19:04 2014 UTC,"You can limit him water in take, mine is 8 months and i do with mine. A dog should be able to hold their urine for their month plus one hour (example, 8 months equals 9 hours) not always exact but something to aim for. Good luck!"
BullTerrier,252jz1,Pandora023,1 point,Thu May 8 23:52:16 2014 UTC,"Great tip on the water limit. Do you take the water away some time before he goes to sleep and then you put it back, or you just give him water, let's say from 30 to 30 minutes 1 or 2 hours before he goes to sleep?"
BullTerrier,252jz1,MaNurse,1 point,Fri May 9 16:04:39 2014 UTC,"Well where i work we train dogs, and usually we give dogs water every hour, its up to then to drink and we let them drink their fill. At 7 pm we don't usually let them drink any more and they get water again around 6am. Those are dogs around 4 to 8 months old. For younger puppies I would recommend 10pm and 6am, with a potty break. But don't always give in first whimper you get. I suggest moving your crate (I hope you have one) to another room if it's in your room. Good luck :)"
BullTerrier,252jz1,figtoria,1 point,Fri May 9 17:02:14 2014 UTC,"no, he has his room, but I don't have a crate. Basicly I get home and he gets out. He only spends part of the morning in his place.  That schedule is very good indeed.   I'm a sucker at wimps but I stay strong and I have my guilt time after the end of the wimps + some more time, so he does not understand lol"

BullTerrier,24inrk,metalmammal,2,Fri May 2 04:29:39 2014 UTC,Nori is a really sweet 7 year old intact female. She absolutely loves people and she loves to snuggle. She is not good with other dogs and has become very aggressive with our corgis so we need to find a home for her. She plays pretty rough so I wouldn't recommend having her around young children. I love this dog to pieces and she is my baby but it's not fair to her or my corgis to keep all of them. They have to be separated and it is stressing out all of the dogs :(
BullTerrier,24inrk,doberwoman,3,Fri May 2 04:32:30 2014 UTC,"Maybe seeing a trainer would solve your problem. Don't just get rid of a dog for a simple thing like that. Make some calls! Ask for advices, don't give up!  If you really love her, you'd fight to keep her. Find solutions , don't just get rid of her like she is a old broken toy."
BullTerrier,24inrk,okaythisisit,1 point,Fri May 2 16:40:20 2014 UTC,I have tried everything. They recently had a pretty bad fight and my fiance is putting his foot down. I would love to be able to keep her.

I will go, but I have some traumas on vets as my father lost 1/2 puppies in 2 creations (he is a hunter, not a puppy mill), by bad recommendations and very bad prescriptions, this in two separated vets. Now he just does all by himself and they are the most healthy energetic dogs.  I asked this here, to see if their puppy bully had the same 'issues' than my Napo.."
BullTerrier,23gj7i,Pandora023,2,Sun Apr 20 01:43:51 2014 UTC,Also lamb and rice might help if he has a sensitive stomach. Hope that helps!
BullTerrier,23gj7i,scnavi,1 point,Sat Apr 19 22:56:07 2014 UTC,"I don't think so, he doesn't get constipated or nothing like that, is just the color that is exactly the same as the food."

It's a grain free brand and it actually says on the back of the bag to expect the farting and upset stomach at first.  There should also be what amount you should be feeding him on the bag.  Keep in mind puppies grow."

BullTerrier,23gj7i,Pandora023,1 point,Tue Apr 22 12:30:39 2014 UTC,For a test I supose. She's farting a lot and poops aren't THAT small. Bought smaller bag of the food so if she'll be worse after TOTW we're going back to Eukanuba. Maybe more Acana or Orijen testing in the future.  @edit: Plus high protein/no grain seems to be very nice.
BullTerrier,23gj7i,Username_uhh,1 point,Tue Apr 22 13:33:36 2014 UTC,"Someone said here that is normal, mine after 2 weeks is starting to do fine, I add some warm water to every meal, so he eat and not swallow, and the digestion is much better.   PS HE HAS A PIMPLE IN HIS DICK, is this normal? I use to clean his dick when he pisses so he don't spread little pints of piss all over the place with a piece of toilet/kitchen paper, today I will talk with the vet"
BullTerrier,23gj7i,iZey-,1 point,Tue Apr 22 13:40:14 2014 UTC,"So, she ate 5 meals, 2 yesterday, 3 today. 3/4 eukanuba and 1/4 TOTW. After 4rd meal her belly was really stuffed and after 5th poop came out yellow and really smelly. She doesn't look like she's feeling great. So, we're going back to Eukanuba I suppose. She had yogurt and bananas too. So I'm not sure if that's TOTW fault."
BullTerrier,23gj7i,iZey-,1 point,Wed Apr 23 19:41:20 2014 UTC,"It's normal, mine to, he is great now. He was eating a lot, but I found a trick, I just put some warm water into his food so he eats slower, after this his poop turned dark brown, he poops much less, and eats less (the indicated measurements)"

BullTerrier,238e86,Pandora023,1 point,Thu Apr 17 16:23:19 2014 UTC,"I'd say it's worth a shot. Just avoid places where there are other dogs who will get tangled. I think the big gripe with retractable a is that it can reward dogs for pulling, they resist the tension and get to keep going. That doesn't seem to be your problem so it might work."
BullTerrier,238e86,Pandora023,1 point,Thu Apr 17 02:00:14 2014 UTC,"That's my thought. If we drop the leash and walk away, she will eventually follow, so maybe having that extra space will help encourage her without pulling"
BullTerrier,238e86,Username_uhh,1 point,Thu Apr 17 03:55:56 2014 UTC,"I haven't had much success with a retractable, in fact we only use it to let him out to go potty (we don't have a yard). And when we go on walks i never walk him by his harness because it encourages pulling, I actually use a pinch collar and he does prefect on it. But then he's been conditioned to it because he's been to private training a couple times. Good luck!"

BullTerrier,22vhq4,jillybobilly,2,Sat Apr 12 19:57:36 2014 UTC,"My Bunia is almost 3 months old. At first she was peeing on some kind of mat that's used if you're old and peeing your bed or sweat too much. Poop was the issue because when she was getting 4 meals a day she pooped every 3-4 hours, so I was often going out with her at 3AM. I suppose you need to figure out when she PROBOBLY would like to pee/poop and stay outside until she will. Sometimes I need to pick her up and put down in pooping spot like 10 times. And 'nice poop/pee, good job' always follows. Giving her meals at exact same hour can help.   As for biting, still an issue :p But well, she has no hands to grab something. Often biting legs is is more like 'I want to play' sign. Besides, hands are warm and hot so you know, quite fun to chew on. Just try to out maneuver the dog with your hands when petting. You have opposite thumb ;)   Walks are still a nightmare. She'll go in donkey mode and won't go anywhere. My solution is going to the forest where I'm getting her of the leash and when I'm far enough she'll follow me so she won't loose me. But ye, walks are not fun for young dogs, not yet. You need to make them fun and exciting.   To be honest, with all the problems that's why I got myself a dog not a cat - to get busy :) Just try to think like a dog for a while. Everything that  is going on the is above, I want to know what's going on so I'm jumping. Have some of my good luck, not much because I know I'll need much with my girl too :D"

I can take her to a park and let her off and she's pretty decent about following, but I think otherwise it just... it seems like she feels the leash is demeaning, ahah. How dare we take away her autonomy to sniff as she likes!"
BullTerrier,22vhq4,bullterrierlove,2,Sun Apr 13 01:24:40 2014 UTC,"Relax! She's still a baby.   Mouthiness - Consistency. She isn't going to learn bite inhibition overnight. Just stick with it - yelp, replace inappropriate object/body part with appropriate object and ignore her.    She doesn't really need walks yet, and too much exercise can be bad for her growing joints. At this point, you really just want her to get used to the leash. For one, it may be easier if you use a harness, rather than a collar (you haven't mentioned which) and reintroduce the collar later. Try letting her explore with the leash on-  drop it and let it trail until she's interested in something, then pick it back up when she's focused and moving.  Many puppies under 12 weeks of age haven't developed bladder or bowel control yet. She has a tiny bladder and a not-totally-wonderful memory. I realize it's very frustrating but patience, patience, patience. You can start worrying in a couple more weeks if she still isn't catching on, but I'm sure she will. In the mean time, prevention is key. The less opportunity she has to go where she shouldn't, the less chance she might be inadvertently reinforced for doing so.  If you haven't checked it out already, perhaps make an account on www.dogstardaily.com; it's founded by Dr. Ian Dunbar and is full of a lot of great information (particularly on bite inhibition)."
BullTerrier,22vhq4,luigisayshello,1 point,Wed Apr 16 16:50:15 2014 UTC,Hey thanks!   We do use a harness. However I really think she needs walks - she's way too hyper to be worn out by simple play. She's a maniac.   But you're right - I think it's all about patience.
BullTerrier,22vhq4,luigisayshello,2,Wed Apr 16 23:25:51 2014 UTC,"I feel you so much ahah,  Mine is 8 weeks and same thing, just get her some toys and ok things to bite. He is ruff whenever he wakes up, but I put him running after a tennis ball or a old slipper I put the toy (just have one showing) in complex places to reach he thinks and puts some time into it, then I use a thick lace (like the ones on hoodies, I remove mine from an old hoddie) and play with him more, than passed 25/30 minutes sometimes more, I train him (sit, paw, come, stay) he already knows them all, then a little bit more playing and he is done for a lot of time.   Peeing and pooping, My rugs have plastic/rubber on them, but he knows his spot inside the house, monday I will give the vaccines but it still can't go outside for pooping and peeing (Apartment).  Basicly for training him words like no and drop it you need to get her attention, I use praises mixed with dog food and he learns, just repeat the words and the actions over and over (my napo only needs one day to learn, thank god).  Don't stress out too much it's normal, just teach her the words and give her some exercise and mental exercise."
BullTerrier,22vhq4,brttf3,1 point,Sat Apr 19 19:19:14 2014 UTC,"I came up with this technique and it looks like it works very well, as I had a stubborn just like yours and now I have an (INSERT SOMETHING WONDERFUL). So this is very simple, pick food, pick the leash and put it on him. Put some bites of food in your hand and make him pursue it. During this time make some pressure on the leash so he knows that he's in it but he is being rewarded . Then he will get stubborn but he already knows what to do with a leash, walk. So to correct this stubbornness, Inside the house with him/her on the leash trow single bits of food around for outside the view range of the dog. Then just push him/her anyway (if he 'stubbornize'), say c'mon or don't say nothing, and guide him/her to the bits of food. Interchange during the session to a little walk on a forbidden part of the house.  In no time he will understand that you want to drive him to someplace that is good."
BullTerrier,22vhq4,brttf3,1 point,Sat May 3 08:52:02 2014 UTC,"We have a 6 month old named matilda. She was pretty much like this at 8 or 9 weeks, and has gotten steadily better. When she is biting you give a firm ""no"" and replace with something she can bite, like a toy, or chew. Our problem with her walking was the opposite, pulling. And we fixed this with training and a harness. You have to reward her with treats. Matilda will do anything for a little bit of hot dog. Just a little tiny bit. Here is how we got her house trained. Crate training works. she goes in the crate when we leave her. When we come home we carry her to the back yard and put her in the same spot EVERYTIME. She stays until she pees and/or poops. She gets praise and a  treat when she does. If she doesn't pee she goes back in the crate. - this only happened once, because her bladder was so small she always had to pee. only once - the second day we had her - did she pee in her crate, and I am pretty sure I slept through her crying in the middle of the night. She quickly learned that to pee she had to go outside, and would stand by the backdoor to go out, but sometimes we didn't see her quick enough and she would pee on the floor. Immediately pick her up - she will stop peeing - and carry her out to her spot. Then if she pees more reward and praise. It was about 3 weeks of hard work to get her completely house broken. It is about being very consistent. She is still a little bitey but getting better all the time. These dogs are super trainable, and way too smart. it is just about consistency and rewards. (and I am no expert, she is my first puppy, though I have had other dogs.) She is very headstrong, but for a good treat she will do anything."
BullTerrier,22vhq4,fannypaq,1 point,Sat Apr 12 20:14:07 2014 UTC,"I'm glad to hear its (probably) (mostly) temporary!   We are crate training her and she's doing well baring an accident outside of her control (I think she was left too long). She is able to wake us up less often, too. We take her out immediately from the crate and wait her out. I think we just need to not give her as much freedom, tbh.   And no, hah, she won't stop peeing when you pick her up. Ask my foot. Which was peed on. But we do try. She's usually done by the time we get to her!"

Even then you can't be sure.   That puppy is what - 3 or 4 weeks old?    And if you're looking to show, you'll need to base it on other factors, not just his head.  Which one has a nice square little body with decent neck, shoulders, back and turn of stifle?   Again, you really can't tell for sure at that age.  As breeders we're lucky if there is a puppy in a litter which stands out week after week when you stack them and take pictures.  MOST of the time, they take turns being the best week to week.  And even then, his bite won't be finished till at least the adult teeth come in.  If you're just picking because you like the nice egg-shaped head, then I would say they both have nice little heads for their age (though the pictures are not shot at identical angles) and should both be lovely.

BullTerrier,219fzf,figtoria,1 point,Mon Mar 24 23:31:19 2014 UTC,"Today I visited, but I was overwhelmed by the visit and they were bigger than the picture (4-5 weeks old).The father is from a great prized kennel, and is freaking beautiful, the bitch has her body round like a barrel and the nose a little long (for my taste), but with a very decent shape but the head looked a little smaller, again she was very round. I will try to see them tomorrow again. The puppy with the more short nose is my chosen, I confirm in the page of the creator that puppies like that turn out very good with a very good head, nose, so all points out to predominant genes of the father. Father is black on top, red on usually black bullies have white.  The bitch was perfectly wealthy, all white with red ear, not a single allergy, hair, smooth as a cat, very calm and sweet.  What is square? What is a good one? I want a fit good looking guy, it's why I am still here, 4 weeks after the search that was supposed to be a pick - choose - ""Welcome Puppy"". But whenever I ""sleep on"" a new litter that showed up, 3-4 days no more puppies available. When I can they have no parents to show up, no record of health, nothing. I'm doomed!"

They make him look like someone stubbed cigarettes out all over his face and chest, and his belly gets super red and itchy. No grains or potatoes for him. We went through soooo many different foods (Blue Buffalo, Natural Balance, Science Diet, Nutri-Source, Merrick, etc) before finding he is able to eat Orijen and Nature's Variety Instinct. He has a white stripe down his face so I have to put sunscreen on his little nose if we plan to be outside for awhile.

BullTerrier,216w6z,rawcaret,0,Mon Mar 24 03:02:54 2014 UTC,"Like I said to them: Tea tree oil is only toxic in its pure form. When diluted into a shampoo or other solution, it's usually fine as long as long as it was properly diluted. I use tea tree oil on my skin a lot, I buy it pure and it's like two drops vs a large shampoo bottle. So many people make the mistake of buying it pure and using it pure, which for humans can severely burn the skin. As it even specifies at the bottom of that article, ""undiluted tea tree oil"".

It's when groomers and owners try to make their own tea tree oil concoctions (or using tea tree oil pure) that things most often go wrong. It is also always wise to test patch anything new on your pets before using a full dose of it, as some dogs are more sensitive to others and tea tree oil allergies do exist. People spreading this kind of misinformation without fully knowing what they're talking about is what caused this popular misconception in the first place."

You do what you want, though. Good luck."
BullTerrier,216w6z,Fluffers,0,Mon Mar 24 14:04:40 2014 UTC,"...I work at a pet store and literally none of our groomers have ever heard of this happening (they use tea tree oil shampoo too, different brand). As sad as it is, I also find your aunt's situation difficult to believe, especially since it's extremely hard to prove. I have been using this shampoo on three dogs for years with zero problems, and I frequently recommend it to customers and have never seen a bottle come back. But thank you for making it seem like I'm just using it to make my dog soft, when in reality it's the only shampoo I've found that doesn't irritate his sensitive skin and helps his summer/fall allergies. You can have your beliefs and opinions, I can respect that, but it makes it difficult to when you treat others like they're stupid for having their own."
BullTerrier,216w6z,plutos_kiss,1 point,Mon Mar 24 14:35:39 2014 UTC,"It is very possible that she groomer she took her cats to used a mixture that contained too much of the oil - not discounting that. However, when you take two perfectly healthy cats to get groomed, and after they return home begin to show signs of tea tree oil toxicity and then die, I have a hard time NOT believing the shampoo had everything to do with it.   My intention was never to make anybody feel stupid, and I'm sorry you took my comments that way. I guess I just hear ""tea tree oil"" in conjunction with ""dogs/cats"", and I get all freaked out, because of something directly related to the stuff leading to the death of some very dear pets. I would just hate for somebody else to go through that. I guess in trying to be helpful, I came off as a jerk and made you get defensive about your choices... definitely not how I meant for it to come out. Every animal is different, with regard to what they can handle and what they can't. It sounds like your dog is still okay after using the shampoo, so that's great."

Obsessed. Anton have any other options on what to do? Things that you do? He loves being in our backyard and outside, but it's going to have to be limited if we can't figure out a way to stop it.

BullTerrier,208dk6,luigisayshello,2,Wed Mar 12 14:54:00 2014 UTC,"i feel like i was in a similar situation when I got my bully.  I ran a similar schedule.  Every morning he would go outside and I would play with him for about 30-45 minutes before I would head out to work.  It was really time consuming and stressful during the first 3 months of having him.  I keep him kenneled when I'm not home but he only had 3-4 hours in there while he was a baby.    I would recommend finding an older bull terrier (6+ mos.)  it'll take the stress away from you of having to make your life completely about the dog (which is what is going to happen).  I have a relatively small apartment myself but he seems to do okay in it.  Now he's 9mos. and I try to take him to the park 3x a week with walks intermittently.    If you train him correctly and give him the attention he needs, you don't have to worry about him tearing up the house.  keep bones and bully sticks handy since that will occupy him enough to not go after furniture.  YOU HAVE TO BE FIRM with the breed...they will run you if you're not mentally prepared to be alpha.    Good Luck!! They're the best friend you never knew you had."

Nyla bones are amazing and this stuff i get called Yeti Dog Chew. It lasts him 3 weeks or so as opposed to a bully stick for 30 minutes. I would suggest spending 15 min a day training him, broken up to start. And lots of toys with lots of textures. I crate him when I'm not home and hide his lunch in it to engage his brain and also leave the radio on. Feel free to message me with my questions if you'd like :) good luck"

Like a small step stool. Staring at the ball that she can't get directly to, she cries. Then after a few minutes she walks around the obstacle. It's like in her head, she is saying ""oh no! I can't get my ball!"" And then after a few minutes...  ""Hey! My ball!"""

BullTerrier,1yrgyp,FACEAnthrax,5,Mon Feb 24 03:41:32 2014 UTC,"They do need a good walk at least once a day - twice is better when they're young  Mine have never had a problem being alone while I'm a work, but that's because I spend a lot of time when them when I AM home.  You can't leave them alone, and then come home and ignore them.  They do need sunblock on their pink little noses if out for any length of time with no shade.  Mine have always lived with cats with no problem whatsoever.  Ever.    Attended a good training class.  You will need to be very firm with them.  They aren't the pushovers that poodles and cockers are.  But to me, their sense of humour and comic personalities make the extra effort well worth while."
BullTerrier,1yrgyp,figtoria,1 point,Mon Feb 24 03:54:29 2014 UTC,"Yeah, you're spot on. Just to add a couple things-  I've got a standard white Bully. Make sure the breeder or you check his hearing, whites are more prone to deafness. Also, food allergies. It took us awhile to figure that out but found the proper food for him. We took ours through a local training class, he was a little to young but it helped. Helped me more than him I think.  I highly recommend kennel training for many reasons and most importantly safety. We socialized ours often. There's a dog park by our house and we took him to ""doggie daycare"" monthly. The place we go to is highly reputable, strict and has cameras you can watch live online and is reasonably priced ($13USD for a full day).  Ours is 6 years old now and lazy as shit but he still has his short burst of energy moments. He went through a rebellious adolescent stage at about 8-10 months. We would have to submit him time and time again. My wife (small Asian girl) had to sit on him for 15 min once before he took and deep breath and gave in. They stubborn at that age but it's totally worth it. I've had dogs growing up but never a connection I have with him.  Some people disagree but Cesar Millan has some good techniques. We'd pet him while eating. Take it away for a couple seconds to avoid food aggression issues later. When he was about four we got a Miniature Australian Shepherd. He was great with her; she jump all over him and he'd just lay there.       Lastly, we had a cat prior to getting him at 8 weeks old. Our cat is crazy as shit and can hold her own. We just didn't let him mess with her. She to this day runs the house.   Our Bully - Vigo  Good luck to you and enjoy!"
BullTerrier,1yrgyp,RZA816,2,Mon Feb 24 05:57:02 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the post :)  Out of interest what do you feed him? Previously we had cooked all our own food for our dogs years ago. But I have been looking at straight raw diets more and more. Any input on the subject would be fantastic :).  Crate training will be a definite, as I don't think I could ever trust a pup being left in house or yard :). But will have to find something very strong that's still stimulating to play with while he/she is in there with their strong jaws.  We have some sort of doggy daycare here, I'd never heard of it before recently, but I imagine their prices are through the roof here (NZ) lol but will definitely check it out. Lots of dog parks now days too, their never used to be which will be great for socializing.  I would definitely like to get him or her fixed, to prevent pups and help with aggression as well as other behavioral problems. When would you suggest the best time for them to be fixed (all previous were unfixed females, that were not bred from), in a male would it effect his bulky growing structure being fixed early?  Thanks, Vigo if gorgeous btw :)"
BullTerrier,1yrgyp,RZA816,1 point,Mon Feb 24 19:31:12 2014 UTC,"I'd love to be able to prepare food for him but I was always concerned we couldn't do it constantly. We previously feed him Natura but they were taken over by Proctor & Gamble (Major Conglomerate), so the boutique we buy from quit carrying it. We now use Acana - Pacifica formula. It's honestly the best food we've used. It's expensive but cheaper than Vet visits..."
BullTerrier,1yrgyp,plutos_kiss,1 point,Wed Feb 26 11:41:16 2014 UTC,"I fed my Bull Terrier a straight raw diet for over a year out of necessity due to his food allergies. He is allergic to grain and potato which severely limited the commercial dog food he could eat. I recently started introducing grain/potato free kibble as his evening meal, but he still eats raw for breakfast. He does well with Orijen (which I believe is made by the same company as Acana) and he can also have Nature's Variety Instinct. I've had others give me a lot of heat for feeding a raw diet, but you just have to learn to shrug it off and say 'to each their own'."
BullTerrier,1yrgyp,Username_uhh,1 point,Tue Mar 4 14:23:19 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the response, I had heard this breed often had problems being left alone for any period so this makes me feel more confident about it, was worried I would never be able to keep one in my circumstance.  I do plan to crate train as I have my previous dogs. My previous were ""dancers"" having been trained to perform various things. Also have been told the best time to try train these guys are when they're all pooped out as they're not so easily distracted.  Will definitely have to come up with a strict routine we can all follow before even thinking about bringing a pup home.   Any ideas on the best way to introduce a cat and a pup? As when the time comes I do think we will still have our fat house cat and she would be my biggest concern as she's not much of a fighter.  My pup will become my hobby, and I will hopefully be able to take him/her with me where ever I go (hopefully work included, but unlikely).  After being fascinated with the breed since I was really young, I feel that I'm almost ready to take one on, they are very uncommon here so I haven't actually had the chance to really get to know one well personally. But everything I've seen and heard sounds like they would be a great companion :)."
BullTerrier,1yrgyp,Username_uhh,3,Mon Feb 24 19:10:57 2014 UTC,"Crate train. Can't say that enough. These dogs are more attention hungry than any other breed I've been with and if you're going to be gone 8+ hours I'd recommend having someone come play for an hour to break it up. They are very destructive when bored and I would recommend a few walks a day or a trip to the dog park. Scud doesn't like walks, but a trip to the dog park or an hour of play will mellow him out some. We ended up getting a second dog so he could have a playmate because I couldn't keep up with our newborns here and that has helped. Most fun I've ever had with a dog, but probably the hardest to train. We won't be trusting him spending the night loose in the house for a loooong time. He's a year old and has a lot of maturing to do!"
BullTerrier,1yrgyp,Username_uhh,2,Mon Feb 24 06:20:53 2014 UTC,"Bull Terriers have a lot of energy and what seems like a never ending puppy stage. I've come home to chunks out of door frames and chewed kitchen cabinets. To say just a walk will satisfy them is a long shot, some will be satisfied, but most will not. I currently have three (7yrs, 2yrs, 6months) all with differing exercise needs, so really it comes to the luck of the draw with your puppy.  As with toys, my dogs have destroyed anything I've ever purchased at the pet store, but things that I've found to hold up to their strong jaws are kongs, deer antlers and their favorite raw frozen beef knuckles. A great toy and easy way to exercise them is a flirt pole, they go nuts as soon as I bring it out!  Any harness that is wider in the chest is a good one in my opinion, just be careful with any metal clasps, BT's have sensitive skin and can break out in a minor skin irritation if left in contact to long, same goes for collars.  Sunblock is needed on any breed of dog with little fur protection, so yes, BT's will need it on their nose.  BT's can live with any animal as long as they are raised around it. Will the dog want to chase a cat while on a walk, yes, if it runs, but that doesn't mean the dog will go home and eat your cat. We have a bunny, and so far there have been zero issues with it. There have been a couple times where they've gotten out when I wasn't home, but they still didn't bust into the bunny's cage which they easily could have.  This breed can be very stubborn, and there will be many times you might want to scream, but they are worth it all, they are a very loving, devoted breed and want nothing more then to be right at your side.   http://imgur.com/mOFcgjp"
BullTerrier,1yrgyp,Username_uhh,2,Mon Feb 24 06:11:49 2014 UTC,"Will definitely have a good look at any harness and be careful of metal clasps etc thanks, hadn't really thought of that. What's the best kind of brush to use on their short fur, something with rubber bristles I would imagine?   Deer antlers is a great idea also, that's definitely doable :) Had to google flirt pole as I hadn't heard of one before.  My plan atm would be to run him/her hard at least once a day, followed by general walk/playtime/simulation/training at other times during the day/evening. Was wondering if the strenuous run would be best before leaving for work. I would imagine so as they would be more keen to sleep and chew toys through the day while it is in the crate rather than get overly bored and destructive. Of course that will be different depending on the dog itself, but just as getting an idea of things."
BullTerrier,1yrgyp,Username_uhh,1 point,Mon Feb 24 19:47:36 2014 UTC,"I personally don't really brush my dogs out, the only time I brush them is right before a bath and I just use a rubber brush or a bristle brush. I find the metal ones a bit to rough for my liking. A good run would be perfect, the only downfall is the first year you shouldn't do any strenuous activity because they are still growing and it will do more harm then good. Also, be careful with what toys you allow them to have unsupervised, they will devour just about everything you give them. How long do you plan on crating the dog?"
BullTerrier,1yrgyp,Username_uhh,1 point,Tue Feb 25 03:32:07 2014 UTC,"While at work it would be around 8hours, so I would think I'd have to have someone to come visit or similar during the day.  I thought the metals brushes might be a bit hard on their fine coat. Interested in grooming to cut down shed around the house as I am aiming to bring a white pup home and their fur seems to also stick out the worst lol.  I imagine they get through pigs ears and raw hide chews in an instant with their strong jaws."
BullTerrier,1yrgyp,Username_uhh,1 point,Tue Feb 25 04:39:20 2014 UTC,"8 hours is a bit long, especially for a puppy, but it can be managed if you exercise before you leave and when you get home. Just leave some chews for the pup and they'll be fine. As for pig ears and raw hides, you'll find in due time that pretty much anything they put in their mouth doesn't last long, hahahaha! That's why I like to freeze some raw meaty bones, I find that lasts the longest."
BullTerrier,1yrgyp,wogvorph,2,Tue Feb 25 06:50:09 2014 UTC,"You said in a earlier comment that you had 3 BT's are they male and female?  Was interested to ask if you have found much difference in personality etc between male and female. I originally was set on a male/not sure, but have decided on a female with the chance of getting her a male friend in future to play with, I would like to keep her unfixed till maturity (2 years). Do you believe a male up to 2years unfixed would be a lot more aggressive and harder to cope with versus a female?  Thanks :)"
BullTerrier,1yqgt3,thedelo187,3,Sun Feb 23 21:36:12 2014 UTC,"Daphne has been suffering from a lot of allergies due in part to poor/improper breeding by the kennel we adopted her from. She has chronic ear infections (has been deaf since birth), fungal infections of the nail beds, and now recently the raw neck as shown in the photo. At first we thought it was environmental or possibly a nickel allergy from her collar but have since ruled that out with a new collar and just not having the collar on while indoors. We then starting changing foods to address a possible grain intolerance but no such luck (6+ months). We are no taking on a sweet potato and bean diet for a food eliminating test to try and find out the underlining cause. Me and my girlfriend love this dog like a child and feel terrible that she is suffering through all of these issues and just need help. I know with all the affection and good qualities of her breed that there are hereditary conditions with her breed but I know something has to alleviate at least some of her symptoms. Please, any and all help to give our beautiful big hearted princess a more enjoyable life is appreciated."
BullTerrier,1yqgt3,RZA816,2,Sun Feb 23 21:48:23 2014 UTC,"We have a white Bully, he's 6 years old now and we went the first several years dealing with his allergies. Whites are obviously prone to allergies and deafness. Ours has severe corn, wheat / gluten allergies and issues with certain proteins. He'd get ear infections so bad you could smell a yeast smell when we'd walk in the door. He'd also scratch until his ears would be so raw they'd bleed. Not to mention painting the walls. Tried several corn/ wheat free, they helped but he still smelled bad and his fur felt coarse. We finally found a food that works and have had no problems since - Acana. We had to take him to the vet when he had a yeast in his ears. Gave us steroids, antibiotics and a hydrocortisone spray. You can buy a hydrocortisone spray at any drugstore, this will help relieve the itching until you take care of the source of the issue. Just note, she'll not like the spray at first. It'll sting a bit at first contact but it really does relieve the itching."
BullTerrier,1yqgt3,Username_uhh,3,Mon Feb 24 03:08:07 2014 UTC,"Immediately take her off the bean and sweet potato diet, that will not fix anything and she is not getting any nutrients which can exaggerate her issues. I will bet you anything she just has severe allergies, she needs to be on a raw diet. Bull Terriers immune system takes a bit longer then other breeds to mature, so patience is a virtue in this case. The fungal infections in her nail bed is from over active yeast, another sign of slowed immune system. I would suggest giving her raw chicken, including bones and organs for a week then slowly add in different proteins. I would also recommend putting her on a multivitamin to help boost her immunity. My dogs if left in their collars will also get a small irritation from a metal clip, so I just leave the collars off when home."
BullTerrier,1yqgt3,Username_uhh,2,Mon Feb 24 01:32:56 2014 UTC,"And a great product to run on her skin irritations would be coconut oil, after a bath warm a little up in your hands and smooth it over. She'll be greasy for a little bit, but it will help out tremendously!"
BullTerrier,1yqgt3,Username_uhh,1 point,Mon Feb 24 01:35:17 2014 UTC,I appreciate your feedback. Is there a particular coconut oil product you recommend?
BullTerrier,1yqgt3,makeshiftskeleton,2,Mon Feb 24 01:50:28 2014 UTC,"It needs to be unrefined (but not necessarily organic) coconut oil, (http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B000GAT6NG). I was using a brand called Better Body that I was able to find at a store but switched to the one in the link a few months ago. After a bath, just melt a small tablespoon and rub directly on the skin and fur. You'll want to rub it in real good otherwise she will get everything oily. After my dogs have an oil rub down I leave them in the kitchen for about an hour to ""soak"" then give them a good brush through so any excess oil has been brushed out and it won't get all over my house. In less then two weeks you'll notice less irritation and if combined with a raw diet you will see even faster results. Coconut oil is also a great treat for your dog as well! I wish you luck! Let me know how things are working out in a couple weeks, would be nice to see an updated pic of a rash free Bull!"
BullTerrier,1yqgt3,ParrotWithParkinsons,2,Mon Feb 24 03:12:07 2014 UTC,"My bully has had problems with skin irritation along her belly and in the crooks of her hind legs.  We started giving her fish oil supplements once or twice a day, and added a little more meat to her diet.  After baths I slather her tummy with a sensitive formula/fragrance-free lotion for very dry skin.  This helps some, but just to the point where it's a minor rash/rustiness.  So I feel your frustration to some degree! It's an ongoing battle.   I will also give her a Benadryl if it seems to be really flaring up, because she also gets really red puffy eyes at times."
BullTerrier,1yqgt3,bigirnbrufanny,2,Mon Feb 24 03:15:43 2014 UTC,"Fish oil seems to help my parents' bullies. Grass really makes their poor tummies and armpits flare up, but our female in particular.   (Poorly bred dog) It may sound strange, but we randomly tried baby powder on her tummy and it seems to help a bit. Plus she appears to enjoy it being put on. We typically apply it before bedtime.  Raw diets also seem to do good for the two of them, bathing every few days, especially right after off leash walks. (It's in South America, on a small mountain/big hill with long grass)  Poor Bull Terriers are the poster children of skin issues :("

Instead of just giving him his meals, make him work for it (through training, or brain puzzles, such as Nina Ottosson). Can you look into an activity like nose work?   I know of people who have had success with weight pull. Many dogs NEED a job, acting out is what happens when you don't give them one. You simply will not be able to exercise the energy out.

Science Diet is not an amazing food, there are a whole lot of unnecessary carbs and sub-par levels of protein and fat. Processed carbs are turned into simple sugars in the body, which, you guessed it, can spike their energy levels.  I would recommend changing to a higher quality, grain-free food. If I had to feed a kibble, I'd go with Orijen or Acana."
BullTerrier,1y9jaw,Spunelli,2,Wed Feb 19 19:18:15 2014 UTC,"excuse my grammar, ain't nobody got time for dat. heh.  Shock collar improved several things for me. Mine wasn't never quite as energetic as yours, i think. I mean, it has always been bearable and expected(via research before i got this breed). Yes, he just goes right back to it.  For example, I'm laying on the couch, with plain site of the kitchen trash. My goal: discipline him while he is IN THE TRASH. I could never acheive this because as soon as i moved, he knew he was wrong and he'd run full speed from me. Then run laps around the house to avoid me. He's already familiar with 'stop & sit'. So, I got him a shock collar. He gets zapped when he tried to get into the trash. (He used to put both front paws on top of the can; now he walks by, sniffs and keeps walking.[no zap for that]) If he runs laps, and purposely runs from me he gets 1 chance to obey his 'stop and sit'. After that, he gets zapped. I don't have to zap him anymore, he stops and sits, now. I only had to get him good about 2 times.  Mine does get into everything when i'm in the shower, too. Here's what I did: I took several 'mock' showers. Showers where i didn't need to take and wasn't in a hurry to go anywhere. That way i could catch him in the act. I also call him into the bathroom, repeatedly. I live alone, soo i can run around chasing after my dog nekkid and keep yelling at him from the shower, all i want.  I also take him to daycare once a week. He's tired for 2 days after that.  Bull Terriers are like toddlers; if you hear nothing, there's trouble about."
BullTerrier,1y9jaw,chapastyle88,1 point,Tue Feb 18 20:45:03 2014 UTC,"Yea, mine does sit very well but that doesn't stop him from the 2 minutes I'm not looking to tear up everything.   I like the mock shower idea. Daycare daysI've also looked into. I think it might help.   Yea, no kidding about the toddler part. Mine is a mixed but he behaves all bully."
BullTerrier,1y9jaw,k-weezy,2,Tue Feb 18 23:05:42 2014 UTC,"my bully gets like that from time to time.  now he's a little more relaxed but when i first had the issue with him, bully sticks were my best friend.  they can be expensive but i buy them in bulk on amazon and theyll last a little longer.  the bully sticks are real fibrous so he won't be able to take off a big chunk and swallow.  he's going to have to break it down.  it's nice to give to him when you want a break.  also as for the kennel, i bought him a kong and i put peanut butter in it when i leave the house. he seems to forget that i've left and it'll keep him busy enough for 10 to 15 minute for you to be long gone.  he's never in the kennel when i'm home though."

If he bites I will usually yelp (like another dog would do) or I tell him no and remove what he is biting and replace it with a toy telling him this is his. I have also taught him to lick instead of biting. Patience is key, it can be hard at times but worth it. Good luck!"
BullTerrier,1xmodf,Pandora023,1 point,Tue Feb 11 18:27:49 2014 UTC,"We did the yelping, we also made sure he understands ""kisses"" and tell him ""gentle"" with treats so he doesn't take fingers off when someone hands him something.

BullTerrier,1w0put,subminimal,3,Fri Jan 24 08:27:37 2014 UTC,"My boy loves to use his nose. Whenever we can't take long walks to get rid of the excess energy, we play searching/sniffing games. I hide smelly bits of rare treats around the house and make Viktor use his nose to find them. His favourites are smelly cheeses, meat, and chicken. The smellier the better, he concentrates way better if the treat has a strong odour.  I'll take Viktor to another room, let him sniff the treat, ask him to wait, and then hide the treats in small pieces around the rest of the house. When everything's ready I go back to Viktor and tell him to search. He'll go around the house, smelling the air and the floor, and loving every minute of it.  It's also one of the calmer games I can play with Viktor. He can get pretty excited about most activities, and they easily end up with him having a little bully run of pure excitement. With the searching game, he never gets too excited like that. He's too engaged in the activity to run around. :)  Hope this helps, and hope your bully gets well soon. :)"

BullTerrier,1w0put,bullterrierlove,3,Sat Jan 25 10:52:42 2014 UTC,"Mind games, mind games, mind games - train new tricks, make him think. Instead of just giving him his meals, make him work for it (something like AceTomatoCo posted or Nina Ottosson-esque puzzles).   Spend as much time with him as you can - cuddling or giving him a massage (avoiding his injury).  If he likes car rides, maybe try taking him out and just driving around so he can look out the window?"
BullTerrier,1w0put,funkmasterdunk,1 point,Fri Jan 24 16:59:35 2014 UTC,I think I'm usually the victim of the mind games so absolutely worthwhile turning the tables as you suggest.

BullTerrier,1ufxsa,bikenoodles,3,Sun Jan 5 05:37:37 2014 UTC,"I have had pit bulls, in fact we still have one, and got our first bt this past year, she is almost 1. I feel like she is a bit more stubborn, I can tell she ignores me- more than my last pit, that I thought was stubborn. She also has been a chewer. She has tons of toys, she still is destructive the second she is out of my sight she gets into stuff she shouldn't.  We can be outside and she is happily chewing her toy. I walk in to grab something in the house and bam she went and ripped a tree out of the planter in a matter of a minute . She has chewed holes in all my blankets, she has eaten 3 pans from her crate,  lost our area rug, bf recently lost a sandal, she has pulled the entire drip system from our yard, eaten beds, that is just the things i can think of. What is hard is she knows it is wrong because she always does the pitiful thing when she sees me. I will also say she is generally not left alone because of her priors. This stuff I listed is all done when I step away for just a few minutes. My boyfriend is less vigilant thus the longer list of destruction than I would like.   Is this common to all bt's I cannot say but that has been our experience so far. I do remember my old pit being a huge pain in the ass when she was under 2 but that was 10 years ago so maybe I forgot how bad it was.  My girl is also pretty smart. Potty training was quick, she knows tricks and stuff but she is less eager to please than my pits were, she does them on her own time, unless I have treats, if there are treats then she will do anything.  My girl is also a sweetie, super cuddly,  very social, good with other animals, including cats. Low prey drive, more just obnoxious to the cat. She is bossy, vocal, silly and I love her. Everyone says they have a clown like personality and that is true. They also live up to their rep as being stubborn. I say get one, just give it lotsnof exercise and be prepaired for a very structured puppyhood."
BullTerrier,1ufxsa,k-weezy,3,Sun Jan 5 07:17:57 2014 UTC,"Thanks for all the info! I do understand that all dogs are different (even within the same breed) so if I did get one, which I probably will, then it may or may not be more difficult. I've been pretty successful with chewing problems. Until my mom's German Short haired  pointer got old and chewed on metal all the time. Your bt is still a puppy so hopefully she'll grow out of her chewing on household items. Thank you again!"
BullTerrier,1ufxsa,BTRVA,4,Sun Jan 5 07:30:38 2014 UTC,"I am the President of the Bull Terrier Rescue of Virginia and I can tell you k-weezy is pretty much right on target when it comes to bull terrorist puppies.  I will warn k-weezy that sometimes when a bt enters adolescence a prey-drive will develop, so keep an eye on your bt and cat and with proper management you could avoid a bad situation.    I've fostered over 50 bullies and have seen them in all sizes, ages, temperaments, and colors.  They are a breed that reminds me of a cross between a cat and my teenage niece - they do most things on their terms and are always pushing the limits but in silly ways.  If you want a bullie, patients, a sense of humor, and being a leader are what you need.  Bullies do great in a structured environment and do require a lot of exercise of both the body and mind. The BTRVA is located in Virginia but rescues and adopts bullies all over the east coast and have places as far west as Wyoming.  If you would like, we can assist you in finding a bullie or hook you up with a rescue or reputable breeder near you.  Please feel free to PM me if you have any questions.  You can find us at www.btrva.org or on facebook at www.facebook.com/BTRVA and like our motto says: ""Make Your BFF A Bullie!"""

We keep a bottle of hydrogen peroxide available at all times (doesn't work for sharp objects and most poisons, but is great for - - - well - - - tea lights. sigh).  She was back to hucklebutting within a couple weeks (when she was allowed to - she wanted to earlier but we had to keep her zoned out on meds in order to keep her from opening up her stitches or re-injuring herself by being batshit insane).

Our Frank has gone through plastic flower pots, shoes, leashes to name just a few things not too mention when he found his way into the trash and ate some rib bones (still dealing with the aftermath of that, hopefully his final op on the 3rd of Jan to fix his post op hernia).  It seems as if they get addicted to eating junk, we now have to muzzle him whenever he is on his own because we just can't relax otherwise when we are out without him.  Ours has absolutely no right to still be alive but they seem to be a fiercely resilient breed, yours will be just fine I'm sure of it."

You come across as very condescending however when you tell multiple people having the same problem that your solution is very simple, especially when you downvote a sensible suggestion given to me by veterinary professionals.   My dog, and others I suspect, does not differentiate between his toys and stuff he can't chew, meaning that playtime must be supervised and when he is left on his own he MUST be muzzled.    If your giving advice, give it, don't condescend or downvote without finding out where the advice came from in the first place."

Pretty condescending, maybe it's your nature.  Your method works during supervised playtime, not much good if nobody is there, make sense?  Until we can 100% trust him not to chew whatever he may find we will muzzle him because I'm not prepared to carry the financial or emotional cost yet again.  I assumed you were the downvoter because you disagreed with my method, it still makes sense to me that it would have been yourself but that is secondary to making sure problem dogs don't die because of neglectful actions."

She's best going to a home where she's the only dog, or to do a trial of her meeting a potential family's other dog. Fellow Bullies probably understand her but other dogs can't put up with her. It would require a lot of work to get her socialized to where she needs to be to meet just any dog. Hates cats and other small animals, strong prey drive. Loves people and kids, but can hucklebutt too excitedly and get too rough for very young kids.   But, very smart girl, very loving, loves to play, huge cuddle bug!  She will Bully her way right into anyone's heart.  Once her full profile is finally up on the rescue group's site I will be posting it here.

As I said, it's probably just the lighting and I don't want to be the doom monger, maybe just check yourself there by pushing your fingers into that space, if it feels soft and slightly giving then it could be a hernia.

If its a 3 or 4, I'd keep an eye on it every now and then. Higher grade than that seems extremely unlikely.  You'll likely never notice any symptoms, honestly.

BullTerrier,1rlopr,Joshhhhsays,3,Wed Nov 27 21:53:40 2013 UTC,"If your dog stood on your child's head and put an equivalent amount of weight on it, you'd (rightly) stop it very quickly, and you sure as hell wouldn't brag about it on the internet.  It's completely unfair to teach the dog to respect the child's bodily autonomy and NOT teach the kid to respect the dog's. If a dog knocks over a kid, he's reprimanded, maybe even rehomed or surrendered to Animal Control if it happens often enough or with enough force. If a kid knocks over a dog, it's cute, laughed about, filmed, photographed and even encouraged. That's garbage.  http://btoellner.typepad.com/kcdogblog/2013/04/almost-horrifying-video-highlights-why-human-behavior-is-so-important-in-judging-dog-behavior.html <-- This is the sort of behavior I'm talking about. I don't care how sweet and patient your dog is -- it's completely unfair to ask an animal to allow his body to be assaulted like that, because he has no way to say ""no."" If he gets up and walks away, he's called back to ""play"" more, because he ""can't take a joke."" If he does it often enough, the parents force him to spend time with the kid in hopes that exposure will help, effectively removing the dog's only polite way to end the situation (leaving). If he growls, he's being aggressive. If he nips or even flashes teeth, he's dangerous. I lose sleep at night because of kid/dog interactions like this.  Your dog is probably a wonderful, sweet, patient pup, and I'm sure your child adores him.  Teaching both dog AND child how to interact appropriately, politely and with respect for each other's decisions is one more way to solidify their relationship, because both parties will be able to enjoy the interaction equally."
BullTerrier,1rlopr,yosseval,-2,Fri Nov 29 05:12:25 2013 UTC,"When I say stand on his head I don't mean for minutes at a time, nor do I mean she jumps on his head, nor is she putting any direct pressure straight to his head. A one year old, however, is going to be a one year old and explore and if she has to go over a dog, she doesnt understand that yet. Rather than being quick to judge and saying that I'm bragging about my child on the internet, take a second to calm down and realize that any person who comes to a dog subreddit probably isn't going to let a dog be mistreated. Also, assuming that I'm not teaching my child to respect the dogs body is equally as crazy. We just got him, and just like he doesn't know he can't nibble on her, she doesn't know she can't do things like walk over him just yet. Children, similar to a dog, have a puppy phase called a toddler. During that time, they learn an amazing amount of information. For example, not nibbling on babies, and for her, not to step on dogs. No child or dog is born knowing right from wrong."
BullTerrier,1rlopr,plearbear,2,Fri Nov 29 12:26:39 2013 UTC,"Yes, toddlers do learn a lot during that age! Which is why you should be teaching your child how to correctly interact with your dog, instead of allowing her to do things that could be potentially harmful to the dog (AND to her), and then posting pictures of the evidence of that on the internet."
BullTerrier,1rlopr,Get__Fucked,2,Sat Nov 30 20:23:33 2013 UTC,Both my of BT's love kids more than anything.   Normally they are extremely hyper and wild but with small children they know exactly how to act. Loving and gentle.
BullTerrier,1rlopr,plearbear,3,Thu Nov 28 01:33:05 2013 UTC,Don't you think it's a little hard on your bullie's back to let a child sit on him like that? :/
BullTerrier,1rlopr,Stellaluna100,2,Fri Nov 29 02:14:36 2013 UTC,"""When I say stand on his head I don't mean for minutes at a time, nor do I mean she jumps on his head, nor is she putting any direct pressure straight to his head""..ok ..correct me if I am wrong but #1: STANDING on a dog's head requires some degree of pressure even if only for a second or two as does sitting on a dog. #2 "" We just got him""...all the more reason to be extra cautious during this introductory phase in the dog's life. The dog needs to know that in his new enviroment that his space is respected by his people. No new dog should be allowed alone long enough with small children without direct supervision, certainly not long enough to grab a photo before you hopefully removed the child. I have owned 3 Bull terriers and am involved in Bully rescue and Bullies WILL take alot but eventually even the most gentle dog will react, and that is when we get them for being behavior problems. The arguement that the child doesnt know is spot on....YOU should know and intervene before it can occur."

BullTerrier,1rlopr,lulucatt,2,Thu Nov 28 19:13:45 2013 UTC,"""Stand on his head??"" Please,please don't let your child  sit on or stand on your dog. Yes, bullies can be great with kids, but what if your child can't read the signals that the dog isn't liking it? What if you step away and something happens? What if it hurts your dog permanently (and yes, it has happened). Dog forbid your dog get annoyed, whether he doesn't feel well, or there is food nearby, or your child accidentally hurts him. Then you have a harmed, or dead, child, and guess what, your bully goes to animal control and, if he's lucky, we in rescue have to deal with a problem you unnecessarily created."
BullTerrier,1rlopr,plearbear,2,Fri Nov 29 02:32:41 2013 UTC,"Agreed. OP: This isn't demonstrating that your dog is good with children... that's demonstrating that you're teaching your child to be bad with dogs, and disregarding your dog's safety."

BullTerrier,1r8tv8,Joshhhhsays,4,Fri Nov 22 21:32:06 2013 UTC,"The main thing is do not punish for going in the house. He will not understand that you're angry because he went inside, and it's possible he might just become fearful of going potty in front of you.  Take outside frequently, to the same spot - every 30 mins to an hour - and when he goes, make a BIG DEAL out of it. Going potty outside is REALLY REALLY EXCITING! If he does go inside, take him outside and just clean it up without making a fuss.  Crate training is helpful. Dogs typically will not go to the bathroom where they have to lie down, so if there is a time where you can't watch him to prevent accidents, crate. Never use the crate as punishment - it should be a safe place, a den. Additionally, Bull Terriers explore with their mouths, so crating when you're not home can save lives."
BullTerrier,1r8tv8,bullterrierlove,1 point,Fri Nov 22 23:51:22 2013 UTC,"Take him every couple hours out to the spot you want him to use.  Kinda encourage him, wait a minute, if he goes - great.  If not, just keep an eye on him and maybe try again in an hour.  This is just my made up method of potty training my animals.  But the idea is to form a habit, get them thinking that doing business is only for outside, there is a special spot, my person lets me out to do my business and if I have to go, I should let them know.   Once they begin to seem familiar with the routine (and his bladder gets a little bigger!) you of course can go longer between trips outside or just wait for them to shows signs of needing to go.  Just like with people babies, fur babies take a lot of nonstop care and intensive attention in the very beginning, but the rewards of a happy well-behaved pup is a great reward for all your hard work!  And CONGRATS!!!! on the new bully!  Post pictures soon, and good luck!  Oh, and if yours is anything like mine was at that age, invest in lots of chew toys!  She ate my picnic table at one point..."
BullTerrier,1r8tv8,makeshiftskeleton,1 point,Fri Nov 22 22:41:51 2013 UTC,"the technique my vet recommended was great for us. puppy is always on a leash or directly supervised. if puppy starts sniffing around he goes out. two minutes should be enough time, if he does not go potty he stays on the leash until you go out again and goes potty. tell him to go potty when he is outside in your preferred spot. puppy always goes out after a nap, coming out of the crate, and eating. mistakes are your fault so do not punish him, make a note of his pattern and adjust your schedule for taking him out. try to have as few accidents as possible the less you have the faster puppy learns.  some people do not like the always on a leash thing, but my bt is and was super sneaky so the leash helped, especially for my boyfriend who would get distracted with video games and stuff so this took away room for human error. it also helped with the stealthy chewing of furniture that happened oh so quietly.  have fun and take lots and lots of pictures."

BullTerrier,1qql9f,coffeedrinking,4,Sat Nov 16 03:15:06 2013 UTC,"Sorry to hear about your sick pup. That's always tough.    To respond to your question, I have experience with both breeder-purchased and rescued BTs.   My first Bull Terrier, Archie came from a great Pittsburgh area breeder. My ex and I were in the market for a Bullie after years and years of research. We went to a dog show with the intention to meet some breeders and pet some dogs.  Instead, we fell in love with a teeny brindle boy.  We took the breeder's info down and a few wks later, we adopted him and signed a co-ownership contract which also stipulated that we had to show him. We had a lot of fun showing him and our relationship with the breeder was excellent- I still consider her a close friend of mine.  Archie turned out to be a great boy, very well behaved, and polite by BT standards.  Ultimately, I lost him in the breakup with my ex. I still miss him every single day.  I went about a year without a Bullie, and decided I needed one in my life- not that Archie could ever be replaced.  After a few months of casually browsing the interwebs, I found an ad for a 5 month old bull pup who was looking for a home. Oliver had been abandoned by a commercial breeder because his ears didn't stand on their own.  His rescuer handed him over to me free of charge after a few days of correspondence.  My boyfriend and I drove about 6 hours to get him.  He spewed every imaginable bodily fluid for the duration of the ride home, and was unimaginably difficult to potty train once we finally got him there. (He'd been kept in an indoor-outdoor run all his life... Didn't quite understand the difference between inside and outside). He was horrified of life for the first couple weeks I had him.  All he wanted was to be held, and would cower if you put him down outside.  Now, 4 months later, he is the most lovable creature I've ever encountered and fears nothing.  He reminds me of my Archie in every way, except he's much less intelligent (neither are very bright). Feel free to browse my Flickr account to see some pictures of both my boys: http://www.flickr.com/photos/burghbullie/  In conclusion, I can say that my rescued BT is equally as healthy (so far) as my breeder-bought one.  They have the same temperament and are both incredibly handsome.  That being said, you should know that unless you live in California, New York, Texas or Florida (Those seem to be big BT rescue hubs) you probably won't find a BT puppy in rescue.  Unfortunately, I've found that many adult BTs in rescue are not tolerant of other dogs.  If you plan on having your Bullie as an only dog, that shouldn't be an issue, but it's something to keep in mind.   Hope this helps. I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.  Edit: Forgot to answer part of the question. The best way to find a reputable breeder is to get in touch with your local BTCA club (this can easily be done via BTCA.com)."
BullTerrier,1qql9f,-SnarkAttack-,2,Sat Nov 16 04:10:45 2013 UTC,"I live in SF. There is a rescue here in SF, but the owner of the rescue is hard to get a hold of. She holds the reputation for having a great rescue, but they are overwhelmed. And I think I'd really love to do the puppy bit, considering where my future career lies.   Your puppy pictures are great. I love his floppy ears. Your were very insightful. Thanks!"
BullTerrier,1qql9f,TheFancifulUnicorn,3,Sat Nov 16 04:16:00 2013 UTC,"We're in southern ca and had trouble finding a breeder or a rescue when we started looking, we ended up talking to a breeder in Texas that was recommended to us from a breeder on the east coast and managed to get our Scud. He's been a great boy."

BullTerrier,1qql9f,BTRVA,3,Sat Nov 16 05:07:58 2013 UTC,"I read this and was baffled! I literally just sent Suz a FB message - she read it and responded immediately. She said she does get about 100 emails, 30 texts and 30 calls a day (from all over, not just CA) and that often people call her once or twice and her voicemail box is full, but if you have a number or email she can reach you at, she'll get back to you. I think she's a very brave woman posting her mobile number online for everyone to see.  So if you're still considering rescue, shoot her an email & include a number she can reach you at. If not, for a breeder, start with BTCA or regional club membership. If they're a member, they've agreed to abide by a code of ethics which basically says they're only producing dogs that will improve the breed - good temperament, health, structure, and conformation. Health tests - BAER test, auscultation and/or Doppler echocardiogram, palpitation for patella luxation, and UPC ratio for kidneys. You should be able to meet at least the dam of a litter."

BullTerrier,1qql9f,k-weezy,4,Sun Nov 17 08:26:44 2013 UTC,"I am so sorry that your BFF is not well.  I am the President of the Bull Terrier Rescue of Virginia (www.BTRVA.org and www.facebook.com/BTRVA) and we have had bullies surrendered to us that have championship blood lines, from backyard breeders, and from parts unknown.  The common theme we see from owner surrenders is that most people can't handle stubborn, mischievous, misunderstood dogs.  Other than their awesomely unique personalities, bullies can have chronic health issues most commonly of which are allergies, dry eye, and yeasty ears.  Other than that they are the best breed going if you like a fun, challenge!    We work with shelters, other bullie rescues, other breed rescues, the Humane Societies, and others to rescue but we also have excellent relationships with top breeders.    Having fostered and adopted out about 50 bull terriers in my home I have found that it doesn't matter much the background of the dog as does the chemistry between the dog (rescue or otherwise) and the new family.  It's hard to describe what that chemistry is but you will know it when it happens.    In your situation please keep in mind that your two older dogs may not appreciate a younger, high energy dog coming into their world.  If you choose to go forward make it a long, slow introduction period.    If you need an help, please let us know!  Thanks, and ""Make Your BFF A Bullie"""

I am in the bay area too and texas is far but these folks seem all kinds of amazing. When the time comes for another doggie I would love to do a rescue, added bonus no puppy chewing stage, omg this dog seems to chew more than both my pitbulls combined. I keep her constantly supervised and it seems like I blink and she has chewed up something...."
BullTerrier,1qql9f,jmarnett11,2,Sat Nov 16 07:18:43 2013 UTC,"My father is a breeder and he really breeds just because he loves the dogs, my bully is from him. I do admit he kind of gives customers the 3rd degree, he just wants to see the dog go to a good suitable home. He remains friends and keeps in contact with the people he sells to as well. But we have gotten rescues before, they were good but there is always a chance you run with them.  If you're looking he has 3 that are for sale right now."

BullTerrier,1q3n59,TheFancifulUnicorn,2,Thu Nov 7 15:31:39 2013 UTC,"The screeching thing that acetomato recommends is the best way to do it IMO, our puppy is 8 months now and I can't even remember the last time he nipped. It also works when he plays to rough with our lab. Really snaps their attention away from it. Providing adequate chew toys for him is important, too so he understands what is ok to teeth on. It was a hard few weeks but they're smart dogs."
BullTerrier,1q3n59,AH17708,1 point,Thu Nov 7 15:33:32 2013 UTC,My Bull terrier just had to grow out of it. He terrorized people until just a few months ago. He's one now. Buy lots and lots of chew toys and bones. If you leave them unattended they will find something to chew on. Stay consistent with telling them no whenever they try biting you.
BullTerrier,1q3n59,bullterriercuddles,1 point,Thu Nov 7 15:33:36 2013 UTC,"I would continue to tell her no, but most importantly I would be giving her plenty of toys/bones to chew on (Nylabones are great) and praising her while she chews. The idea is to teach her what's OK to chew on because she's going to chew no matter what, bullys see the world through their mouths. Starting good habits early on will save you down the road."
BullTerrier,1q35sf,xtina8925,4,Thu Nov 7 07:15:44 2013 UTC,"I agree with /u/AceTomatoCo. Beds don't go into crates. Also, plenty of exercise is needed for terriers. Even if they are left alone in a house with a doggie door, they will tear shit up if they haven't had enough activity to release all that energy. Another sign is chasing of the tail. If he spins and spins in a circle ""chasing his tail"", that's him saying ""hey, I wanna go on a walk...REAL BAD!!"". I know from experience. My bullie is much more mellow and hasn't chewed anything up, now that I take him to the park/skate/walk around the block on a regular bases, 3-4 times a week, 30 minutes to 90 minutes each time."
BullTerrier,1q35sf,MrRichardHead,3,Fri Nov 8 06:02:45 2013 UTC,We only use fleece blankets.  They were recommended by our breeder and they've lasted a long time.  http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80089927/ <- These are very cheap and good

Mine is about 9 months old and nothing is safe. She knows leave it really well, but as soon as I turn my back she grabs whatever she can. She has lots of toy and chew options but I just don't know. I am hoping she will grow out of it. I even considered posting here for some advice. My girl is a chewing maniac."
BullTerrier,1q35sf,k-weezy,3,Fri Nov 8 06:15:52 2013 UTC,"[–]BTRVA [score hidden] 83 milliseconds ago  I've fostered close to 50 bull terriers and it depends on the dog but exercise and/or stimulation is key. I have had bullies tear up and eat anything I put in their crates but if I can wear them out via exercise or give them something to do while in their crate, then they do so much better. Bullie Sticks (beef pizzle) or marrow bones work great if you can't exercise them. You could also ""hide"" food or their favorite treat around your house when they are out will help too. Mental stimulation is just as important as physical work. I would suggest ""How To Be Your Dog's Best Friend"" by the Monks of New Skete as a great starter guide."
