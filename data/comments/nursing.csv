nursing,3e3ty0,PianoConcertoNo2,6,Tue Jul 21 19:14:48 2015 UTC,I think burn out is just an incorrect work life balance - you need to prevent work from taking over your life. Easier said than done.
nursing,3e3ty0,ENRN,2,Tue Jul 21 19:26:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/ENRN.   If you are burnt out consistently, then you need to re-adjust your work/life balance. I regularly pick up extra shifts (both for the money and because I love work). Sure, the days can be long and whatnot, but I never truly feel burnt out.  On my days off, and even sometimes on work days, I'll hit the gym for a little, play some video games, even hit up the gun range. Anything that helps relieve stress.  I find that forcing yourself to do stuff, even if you are exhausted still on your days off, helps a lot with getting refreshed. I found that sitting around doing nothing on my days off just made me dwell on how tired I was from work and thinking about going back in.   I also try to schedule myself for 3 in a row typically. I'll do the beginning of 1 week and the end of the next, so I get 4 to 6 days off (depending on OT and whatnot)."

nursing,3e3ty0,Supperclub74,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:33:12 2015 UTC,My two cures for burn out are time off and learning something knew. Not sure what it's like where you work but i'll usually take a week off every 3-4 months and come back fairly re energized after that. Also found that learning something knew (doing a course) usually gets me re focused and reminds me why I love nursing. Sounds like you need to go back to college.

If there was ever an investigation because of an accident or wrongful death, the hospital would be scrutinizing everything that you did to find a way to put the blame on you.  Without having private liability insurance you would be taking a big risk.  Many times people sue the employees as well as the establishment in medical cases."

nursing,3e2x2b,pusspakmcquack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:46:07 2015 UTC,"Get your own insurance. IMO all nurses should.  Your hospital's insurance covers you only while you are physically at their facility, clocked in, and following all procedures. It doesn't cover you if you are outside the facility, if you forgot to clock in that day, if you made a mistake and went outside procedure, or if the hospital decides it's cheaper and easier to throw you under the bus.  Insurance is dirt cheap for nurses. I use NSO, and I pay about a hundred dollars a year for a million in coverage."

nursing,3e0l24,wicksa,17,Tue Jul 21 21:09:25 2015 UTC,"I've got one. For context- i'm a CNA that works night shift in a hospital with mostly shared rooms (2 people a room).    As I said, I work night shift, and this night was going by pretty easy. I had one patient who was confused, oriented to self. But not at all able to answer questions or hold conversations. He could still walk, so the bed alarm went off a few times. But he didn't have anyone in the bed next to him so besides his confusion my night was going pretty well.     0600 comes around and I think I've made it through the night. But no, what's this? SURPRISE ADMISSION!    An ER tech is waiting outside the door of my confused patients room waiting for me to help him smooth move my new surprise patient into the empty bed. The pt was already restrained, and I could see the ER had had it with him regardless of the restraints. The tech kept telling him to ""just be still and stop talking."" I learned that he was a regular in the ER. A hobo who got picked up a lot for intoxication. That night he was found passed out face down in a gutter.    So I get the smooth mover and we try to move him over to the other bed, but when I move his blankets out of the way I see bright orange, mucky poop. So I grab another tech to help the ER tech turn him so we can clean him before moving him on to the clean bed.     We get him turned and immediately I am hit in the face with odorous menagerie of vodka, doritos, and rancid diarrhea. I'm usually pretty good with poop smells, but this orange sludge ran past his knees and smelled so strongly of vodka that it burned my throat and eyes to be near it. I kept having to turn my head to let my eyes water and cough. Upon further inspection, I noticed that it was riddled with the skins of kidney beans.     So I'm cleaning, and cleaning, and cleaning, and then when I think he's done, he poops again. More bright orange, vodka, dorito, bean skin sludge. At this point the other tech I called to help us turn him can't stand the smell anymore and has start to spray air freshener directly at this guys butt cheeks- A LOT of it. So now I've got vodka diarrhea AND air freshener totally annihilating my air way. Tears are streaming down my face and I literally feel like I'm suffocating. I keep thinking of how much it smells like dorito's dipped in vodka and i'm holding back the urge to vomit.     Finally, we get this guy settled in bed, and I'm trying to ask him questions while I take his vitals. The confused guy in the bed next to us is wide awake at this point. So I ask my new patient ""how tall are you?"" and he responds with ""Garglaarhbhell"". It sounds like this guy is trying to talk to my underwater. So I ask him again- and he responds in the same way, like he's gargling water and talking to me at the same time. I ask him one more time, and my original confused patient says ""He said 6'2!""    Now, mind you, this is the same guy that we couldn't get to answer any of our questions all night. He has gone from totally unable to understand English, to fluent in hobo-gargling-sputum-english.     So, I ask my new admit his next question, ""how much do you weigh?"" and I still can't understand him. Confused patient says ""He said he's 250.""     Now I'm silently laughing my ass off at how much none of this should have or should be happening because what the fuck, but it works for me so I can't complain.     Then I start trying to work at getting my new admit to spit out some of the sputum he's gargling on, and he's not complying. I keep saying ""You need to spit so you can't choke!"" and he keeps replying in gargled nonsense. My confused patient continues to translate; ""He said to go fuck yourself"" ""He said he's gonna punch you in the face"" ""He said fuck you!"" etc, etc, etc. I'm losing it here.   Eventually it's 0700 and I have to go give report and I'm decently satisfied with how I've got my surprise patient settled in. He's clean, restrained, vitals are done, warm in bed, the works. Before I leave the room I ask my confused patient ""Is there anything you need before I go?""   He responded with a shit eating grin and a bunch of gargling sounds.

nursing,3e0l24,laurel32,7,Tue Jul 21 04:45:02 2015 UTC,"Early morning in the adult ED at my last job. A level 1 trauma center teaching facility. Also in an inner city often ranked top 10 of most dangerous places to live by crime rate.   There's two psych hospitals and a rehab nearby.   Late night an ambulance comes in, transferring a new admit to the drug rehab lights and sirens almost literally from across the street to us. Normally this facility just has a staff member and one of our officers walk the patients. Its literally that close.  Diapohoretic patient who is tachycardic and hypotensive. Afebrile. Complaining of abd pain. Skinny as fuck and reeks of stale cigarettes. We're thinking dissection of some sort. The PGY 4 on duty pretty much knows otherwise.   First thing he does after we get access and labs is shove an NG down. Cranks it up. 800-1500 mls of nasty green stuff comes out of the pt's nose and into the suction container.   Then suddenly the patient asks for a bedpan. Prior to this patient is pretty much unresponsive from the pain and takes the NG tube without even resisting. Now the patient is awake, alert, and vitals are improving.  Me and the tech stood next to the patient's bed switching out the big pink plastic bed pans. One after the other. Until there were 5 of them. Absolutely full to the brim, with solid, chunky shit with pieces of red something or other in it (tested it guiac negative btw so it was something else). Just a full straight 45 minutes of this patient letting loose and filling bed pan after bedpan until 5 were full with what looked like chili con carne with red beans.   Apparently this was someone who was such a bad heroin addict that they hadn't shit for at least two weeks. I swear it must have been that long, who decided the night before to finally go to rehab. I never followed up on the case but from the nasty stuff that came out of their stomach and the sheer volume of it, then what they put out once pressure was applied in the opposite direction and finally freed up some movement in their bowels..I'd never seen constipation that bad obstruct someone. But once they emptied out all that shit from their bowels it was like they were a brand new person. Awake, alert, vitals stable, and probably not as full of shit anymore."

I feel nursing school was a heck of a lot more difficult/stressful than working the floor. This might be for a few different reasons though.    I worked for nearly a year as an aide beforehand, so I knew what my hospital setting would be like (I got hired where I was already working). I knew my coworkers, and I had a really good team and positive orientation expierence.  I've always been bad at school, and spent just about every other week hoping I was going to pass my exams and continue to the next semester. Once I finally finished school and passed my NCLEX, that was it. I knew I had my license, and the difficulty of obtaining it was over.  Nurses work with other nurses. Again, I had a good team to work with during orientation. Never once did I feel uncomfortable in asking questions if I wasn't sure about something.    Sure, time management and prioritization can't exactly be taught, but it's a heck of a lot easier to worry about staying late to chart if you need to, rather than worrying about if your professor will fail you out of clinical, or if you studied enough for a test. Just don't be lazy, don't take short cuts, do your job right, and you've got little to worry about.  This has just been my expierence though... it's obviously different for everyone! If school has been easy for you, great! But when you start working, just have confidence in yourself, and know you have resources to go to when needed. Knowledge and skills will come in time. Don't let that stress you out. Remember, you're done with school, the hard part is over. You're a nurse now, and you've got what it takes!  my two cents"

nursing,3e1hjq,xRAPIERx,6,Tue Jul 21 05:59:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a naval officer's wife, he's not a nurse, but I work at an Army hospital. 80 percent of my co-workers are military nurses.   The majority of them seem to dislike their jobs, I don't know if it's frustration, youth, or a combination of the two talking. They work more than the average civilian nurse and there's a lot of training. I don't necessarily agree with their sentiments, but I'm not in their shoes.   The military hospital is considered a government job so over a two week period we work six 12 hour shifts with one 8, for a total of 80 hours. The military nurses sometimes have to come in for additional training or they're on call- but our leadership does their best to credit nurses for their time (ex: if they work four days two weeks in a row, on the next schedule management credits them holiday time for hours already worked). A lot of them complain about the extra hours, however, if you compare their pay to starting civilians- they usually earn more. An example, at my first nursing job in Virginia I would have made about 35k working full time. An O-1 is guaranteed 35k in a base pay, additionally they receive housing allowances, health care, food allowances, and opportunities for travel. Also, you earn 30 days of leave per year.   Your BAH depends on your locations. Google BAH calculator. My husband is an O-3, his BAH covers our rent/utilities + the mortgage on our rental property. However, we make a point of living under BAH and don't have kids. Being a military officer can be fairly lucrative if you put in the time.   As a military nurse, you'll start out as an O-1. I don't know how they rank up, however I've noticed many of the 2-3 years of service RN's are O-2's. I would guess after four years of service you can apply for O-3, but I hear it's competitive.   I work on a floor with a lot of new nurses. It's my understanding they can work on medical, surgical, telemetry, or ortho floors for the first four years of service. After that, they have more options. There's an ICU course, ER course, Case Management Course, Unit Manager, etc.. Some of them go on to start their masters education. One thing I will say is I have been very impressed with the military ICU nurses. The Army does train their people really well. In fact, from the moment you enter the army you're provided education and training.   Another big plus is tution assistance/GI Bill. My husband is on shore tour. How his designator works is he's expected to earn a masters degree on this tour. He works a management position and is going to school. His tuition is paid. At the end of this tour, he will have earn a second bachelors and masters degree- for free. As an O-3 his pay checks are 2.5 times larger than mine.   I feel like one of the biggest cons of military nursing is I know my co workers who want to leave service and transition to the civilian world are going to have a really hard time. It's not because they're bad nurses, it's because they're not accustomed to the customer service aspect of being an RN. All I'm going to say is the military hospital is a lot different than any civilian institution I've worked for.   Also, at least on my unit, we're spoiled with nurse to patient ratios. In the civilian world I could take up to seven heavy medical-surgical patients on day shift with one NA for 22 patients. Census goes down? We start sending RN's home. At the army hospital, on day shift, the most a nurse can take is four. This rarely happens, they generally carry 2-3 patients each. There's an NA for every 6-8 patients. They also have a free charge nurse at all times. On night shift, we can take up to 5 patients, but I usually have 3-4. In six months, I've taken 5 patients once, and have had two patients 8-9 times. At military hospitals everyone is salary, so they keep staff when census decreases (which can be a pro and a con). At my first job the DON served the army for 20 years as a nurse. Her unrealistic expectations make a lot of sense in hindsight. One day I had seven patients and was charge nurse- a PA was on the phone trying to make me transfer a pt to rehab who had a 101 fever, I had a patient becoming septic, another with a gastric leak, and she wanted me to give her VIP patient (my only walkie talkie) a shower. We had no showers on our unit. She talked to me about my care, I almost quit my job that day.   Another huge con of military  (that may also be considered a pro) is travel. I love moving around, however, I live seven thousand miles away from my family. My husband and I have aging parents and we miss a lot of family activities. Another thing to consider is deployment. My husband deploys a lot, it's part of being in the navy. The nurses I work with deploy less, but they still deploy. Several of our nurses are getting ready to do a few months in Korea. Some of them think it's super cool, others don't want to leave their families.   So basically, there are a lot of pros and cons to military nursing. Also, it's really competitive to get in. Some of my co-workers say they were rejected by the Air Force and came to the Army. I wouldn't become a military nurse for any other reason than you wish to serve and would like to reap the benefits of education. The money can be good, however the job can take you away from loved ones- the opportunities are endless though."

nursing,3dz8nk,Is_Butter_A_Carb,3,Tue Jul 21 22:41:30 2015 UTC,"I work nights, my husband stays home with the kids. It works pretty great because he does everything. When I am off, he is home and we have time to spend together. I do spend a fair amount of lonely nights not being able to sleep and missing my family time but that is a night shift hazard."
nursing,3dz8nk,MrsFancySocks,4,Mon Jul 20 22:08:25 2015 UTC,Best part of working in OR is normal hours. Work 7a to 3p Monday to Friday. Take call in the middle of the night after everyone is in bed.
nursing,3dz8nk,ORmurse,4,Mon Jul 20 23:43:11 2015 UTC,I worked with an OR nurse once. They said that OR nurses are so specialized that no one can just float to the OR. You basically have monopoly of overtime if you need the OT.
nursing,3dz8nk,ORmurse,3,Mon Jul 20 23:46:10 2015 UTC,It's a blessing and a curse. I could stay late every day if I wanted and work seven days a week. We have a couple crazy people who frequently work 7a to 11p and others who work 11p to 3p.
nursing,3dz8nk,Zola_Rose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:04:45 2015 UTC,"That's what's happening at one of our local (major) hospitals. Basically, one or two nurses are making a killing in overtime. Not sure how smart/efficient it is, but they get almost all of the call in the OR; they're run ragged, but making bank.   I'd think hospital management wouldn't be fond of the system, but alas, they don't seem to mind."
nursing,3dz8nk,justatouchcrazy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:41 2015 UTC,"For me the worst part of the OR is the hours.  I've already (mostly joking, but only mostly) offered to take everyone's overnight call after graduation just to avoid regular hours and early mornings."
nursing,3dz8nk,vegasaurus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:33:50 2015 UTC,"Is there only one shift you can work? I'm an OR nurse that does 3 12 hour shifts, 11a-11p. No weekends unless I take the call, no early mornings, and I'm usually only on call a couple weekdays a month from 3p-11p on a day off. I regularly get 3 or 4 day weekends which allow me to do some fun things without taking up PTO. See if it's an option where you are!!"
nursing,3dz8nk,ORmurse,2,Tue Jul 21 02:29:33 2015 UTC,"Agree. Another benefit is that we have many shift options, including 8 hours and 12 hours."

nursing,3e0maw,FishNipples,3,Tue Jul 21 01:14:17 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend shadowing an RN in the OR. I think you'd be surprised at what the do, and don't do. I'm not sure about other places around the country, but I work at the largest hospital in the region and don't see any first assist RNs. I know they exist, but round here they're PAs and NPs. Things may be different where you're at. Either way, I'd recommend you shadow before you make up your mind."
nursing,3e0maw,nerdDOC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:54:01 2015 UTC,"I've shadowed an OR nurse and while it's not exactly what I want, I love the OR. Only reason for wanting to be a FA is because I want to be more involved in the actual surgery.  Every time I told RNs/DRs I wanted to be a surgeon they would tell me not to do it. Too much money and schooling. Instead be a NP and/or FA."
nursing,3e0maw,pengigirl14,2,Tue Jul 21 03:08:48 2015 UTC,Have you considered PA school? PAs frequently work in surgery
nursing,3e0maw,frecklyface,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:20 2015 UTC,"I would caution you to be careful committing yourself to OR out of the gate. If you've done some shadowing and are 100%  sure it's what you want that is great! But if you go straight to OR and don't like it, it's extremely hard to get a job doing floor nursing without any prior experience. They are totally different worlds. Just be careful about getting too specialized right out of school."
nursing,3e0maw,ORmurse,-3,Tue Jul 21 02:52:31 2015 UTC,"Spare me. As an OR nurse, I could fake it to make it as a bedside nurse. As a bedside nurse, you'd have no clue in the OR."
nursing,3e0maw,ZeroMT,2,Tue Jul 21 14:22:59 2015 UTC,Highly doubt you can fake it as a bedside ICU nurse.

I wouldn't go into surgery with the goal of being a FA though or else you're going to spend a lot of time learning to circulate, which takes a lot of time and effort to learn since it is very different from what you've learned so far in nursing school."

nursing,3e1tit,targar1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:31:22 2015 UTC,You would need to get some experience first and then apply for a license and determine what work visa you would qualify for. Both countries require that you meet the requirements of the state / province that you want to work in as well as passing their exam. The process is long and expensive. Neither country has a nursing shortage so they are not really interested in importing nurses. The unemployment rate for new grads is very high. You would have a better chance with extensive experience in a specialty.
nursing,3e0mfe,KevinCelery,7,Tue Jul 21 01:15:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be suggesting your knowledgable on EKGs, ABGs, IV insertion, etc. There is two reasons firstly you're a students, people will be wary of someone who think they're skilled in those tasks with 0 years experience, secondly those are monkey tasks, focus on assessing the patient."

nursing,3dybfc,MillinerJones,11,Mon Jul 20 15:06:51 2015 UTC,"What are you using the hydrogen peroxide for?  It's cytotoxic and should never be used on open wounds.  As for other additions, I'd consider some antibiotic ointment, burn cream, an eye wash bottle, and a couple pairs of sterile gloves.  Sounds like you've got a good start!"
nursing,3dybfc,drgnflydggr,6,Mon Jul 20 15:28:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I would switch that out with saline or water for wound flushing.
nursing,3dybfc,Unicorn_Destruction,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:46:53 2015 UTC,"But... mah bubbles!.... In all seriousness, what do you mean by cytotoxic?"
nursing,3dybfc,Beckamahoo,11,Mon Jul 20 16:16:17 2015 UTC,"Cytotoxic meaning it harms living cells. The current evidence is showing that using hydrogen peroxide in wounds does not only not significantly change the risk of infection but may actually cause more complications/do more harm than good. You're much better off just rinsing with saline or sterile water. Hydrogen peroxide is great for getting blood stains out of fabrics though. And you can still enjoy dem bubbles, just not in someone's wound."
nursing,3dybfc,schlingfo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:43:52 2015 UTC,"Good to know, thanks! If you don't mind explaining more, what exactly is sterile water?"
nursing,3dybfc,justatouchcrazy,12,Mon Jul 20 18:04:21 2015 UTC,"You don't even need sterile water.  The literature suggests that tap water has the same efficacy as sterile water when irrigating wounds, in terms of rates of infection."
nursing,3dybfc,schlingfo,2,Mon Jul 20 18:42:51 2015 UTC,"What about in a non-medical setting, such as camping or in backwoods where it's likely a pretty dirty wound and there is limited access or ability to keep it super clean?  I'm just curious; I'm not actually a hardcore camping person."
nursing,3dybfc,justatouchcrazy,2,Mon Jul 20 21:16:15 2015 UTC,I actually haven't read anything on the use of sterile versus clean in an extended field setting.  I will see if I can find anything on it.
nursing,3dybfc,auraseer,2,Mon Jul 20 21:50:56 2015 UTC,"Not even just sterile vs. clean.  It seems like that might be a setting where peroxide might be helpful.  Yes delayed wound healing is rough, but some of the organic material that can get into wounds can be difficult to wash out and cause some nasty infections.  When I worked trauma some of the worst wounds I cared for were farm or forest related."
nursing,3dybfc,WackyWeed22,3,Mon Jul 20 22:03:54 2015 UTC,"Sterile water is exactly what it sounds like. It's water that has had all microorganisms removed or destroyed. You can buy it at some pharmacies, or online.   As /u/schlingfo says, it's not really necessary. Wounds should be copiously irrigated with clean water, but tap water is generally just fine for that purpose."

Chest/airway Supplies Marker and duct tape   EDIT: If you don't know how to use or when to use a Tourniquet then don't grab one. Worse case scenario: use your belt. It's a habit from my old gig.

nursing,3dybfc,roar-a-saur,5,Mon Jul 20 16:19:33 2015 UTC,"You should not include anything you don't know how to use. This brings up a good point: if you're going to carry any significant first aid kit, you should get first aid training so you know what you're doing with it.  Tourniquets are not as bad as their reputation, and they are no longer considered a last resort. Once you do get first aid training, it  would be a good idea to carry a tourniquet in your kit, because an engineered one is much better and safer than a makeshift one made out of your belt."

nursing,3dybfc,justatouchcrazy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:02:30 2015 UTC,A Google search may yield you some good results.  They can also be used for specific snake/ insect bites. Though I am not sure which ones. That's something I've been meaning to research since I camp/ hike a bit.
nursing,3dybfc,disturbdlurker,2,Tue Jul 21 00:29:44 2015 UTC,"No! This is incorrect. Definitely do not apply a tourniquet for cases of a venomous bite. This makes things worse.  Restricting blood flow to the area will make the venom stay concentrated in the area of the bite. The highly concentrated venom will cause more serious damage to the tissue of that area, potentially leading to loss of the extremity.  Research shows the best response to envenomation is to place the extremity below the level of the heart, control the bleeding with direct pressure if necessary, and avoid use of any kind of tourniquet."
nursing,3dybfc,campfo,3,Tue Jul 21 04:51:35 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. You shouldn't have anything in the kit that you don't feel comfortable using. Ideally you'd have some practice with everything you're packing.  But as to the tourniquet specifically - I'd leave it out. There are a lot of handy items that can be used as an emergency tourniquet (belts, paracord)."

I have some ace wraps, band aids, gauze and duct tape. The duct tape is crucial for outdoors first aid. It sticks and stays stuck and still comes loose pretty easily.    I just recently added a tick removal tool as it's much easier to get them out without squeezing them like you almost have to with tweezers. This was after struggling to get ticks off my two year old with tweezers. Eff that, get a tool.    I'm sure there's others that I can't think of right now."
nursing,3dxpyg,cazmoore,36,Mon Jul 20 11:59:52 2015 UTC,I would find something in writing before bailing. In the states you could be charged with patient abandonment if you do not transfer care to another qualified provider with a written or oral report.

nursing,3dxpyg,PRNmeds,3,Mon Jul 20 18:08:05 2015 UTC,Even if it wasn't 'patient abandonment' its definitely unethical. You should absolutely discuss this with your coworker/manager.

In addition, I've spoke with the union and this is where in our collective bargaining agreement for my my hospital, I'm protected from patient abandonment. That nurse will be written up for patient abandonment and reported to the college. Regardless, it's been unreported and now it's reported in documentation.

What have you done about this situation?  ETA and yes I totally get that this situation is bullshit and not your fault, but we are all tasked with having to confront and resolve problems constructively. Your method, even if it was recommended to you, isn't safe, and frankly it's passive aggressive. Go up the chain (supervisor, not union) and document before compromising safety."
nursing,3dxpyg,perrla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:44:22 2015 UTC,"I don't leave without giving report. We write report. I didn't state anything about that. We give report in our report book and report off to the charge nurse until the RN shows up. So what I have been doing is that, however the other day I stayed because my patient was being CCOT-ed, so I wasn't leaving. Also after a 12 hour night shift were not allowed to stay OT unless it's approved, so I filled out an OT slip in addition to all that.  This has happened to me twice, and another co worker several times. So, I'm nipping it in the bud after its happened to me twice."
nursing,3dxpyg,el_nynaeve,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:37:07 2015 UTC,"I've NEVER left without writing report. NEVER. I didn't say anything about that. My issue is a nurse coming in right on the dot or 10 minutes late and wanting me to give verbal because she can't be arsed to get to work on time and instead of looking through the bedside chart for report, that I took the time to write, wants me to give verbal. Not only that, I have to leave to pick up my kids to drive to daycare from my parents who work, and they can't leave obviously till I get there. I wanted to read our union agreement so I'm protected and I know what I need to know so when I go to my manager, who is new, I can go over this with her. She practiced in the U.S. And her hospital didn't have a union, so this is all new to her. Anyway I have a meeting with her tomorrow about it.  This isn't just about patient safety, there's way more than that. If my co worker hasn't showed up, I tell the charge nurse coming on and she already knows these patients. If I get pulled 4 hours into my shift, which happens often, because I work as a resource nurse, I have to go. I'm not obligated to wait and the charge nurse has to deal with that as per my manager. I usually write a quick report, follow up with him or her and they have to bring to attention what's happening."
nursing,3dxpyg,t0yebox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:50:03 2015 UTC,"How is right on the dot late? Why do you do written reports? I know there's some nurses that like to show up 15 min before a shift (0645 when shift starts at 0700) but that's on them. If my shift starts at 0700, then I get report at 0700, and I would hate to think that someone thinks I'm late when i do that.   Written reports sounds weird. I'm all about the quick verbal. Everything else I can read in the chart- why do you guys have to write a damn summary after each shift?"
nursing,3dxpyg,nursejacqueline,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. Sorry I made an assumption like that. Based on what you had stated in your other posts, it sounded like you were told to leave without any report.    I wanted to read our union agreement so I'm protected    I would actually look into the licensing side of this (Canada's BON equivalent) and not rely on what your union says. Usually unions are concerned with the labor rights aspect, not what your practice act states.   ETA: As far as written reports go, they may be legal, and they may be OK with facility protocol, but the gold standard is actually becoming bedside reporting and it sounds like you are well prepared to do this when you come on to shift (since you arrive early). Maybe you should advocate for this during handoff and all shifts coming in 15 minutes early, though it doesn't sound like it would solve the problem with this idiot nurse."
nursing,3dxpyg,I_pollute,4,Tue Jul 21 19:31:17 2015 UTC,Contact your licensing board and go by their answer.
nursing,3dxpyg,stiff-vag,4,Mon Jul 20 15:01:24 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised at what everyone else is saying here. On my unit there 15 minutes overlap inour shifts. If they're 10 minutes late, we call to find our where they are, how long they'll be. We inform the charge nurse, since she knows all the patients she's the one to handle them if they need meds/if they code/etc and we tell the CNA's anf if we have one, the float nurse, to give those patients a bit more priority when they call for the bathroom, etc. Report is always in the computer to refer to in addition to verbals on our unit anyway so once all this is done, we go. The patients are still looked after, it's just spread over more members of the team. People coming late doesn't happen very often on my unit this way anyway, since it seems to hold them more accountable to it."
nursing,3dxpyg,I_pollute,7,Mon Jul 20 18:11:52 2015 UTC,I know its not as thorough as a verbal report and it would take you some time to do but you could write up your report and leave on time. It may even make him/her realize you're not going to put up with it anymore. Also agree with the suggestions of speaking to management if its an ongoing thing. Good luck!
nursing,3dxpyg,stiff-vag,3,Mon Jul 20 13:51:59 2015 UTC,"At my hospital, it is acceptable to leave a Vocera message with your report and your phone number in case they have questions, inform your nurse supervisor of what is going on, then leave. However, I would still talk to your higher ups, especially if this is such a common problem."

Therefore, it would probably not work on ICU or other crit care floors..."
nursing,3dxpyg,shesurrenders,3,Mon Jul 20 18:34:05 2015 UTC,"In addition to the other suggestion (contacting your employer and the CNO), if you are unionized, speak with a rep.   Eventually, the employer may take action against the late employee. If the union is aware in advance, they will (because it is part of their obligation under the Labour Relations Act) to council the member to adhere to the policy of the employer. Also, they represent YOU, and you are being forced to stay (if that is the case). They can clarify if it is permissible to leave without being relieved under your collective agreement."
nursing,3dxpyg,PRNmeds,3,Mon Jul 20 15:59:29 2015 UTC,"If you are the only nurse there waiting for the Co worker to show up, you call your manager at whatever time your shift ends and tell them to come in and do narcotic count with you because you have to go. When your manager asks where your coworker is, tell them what's up, and it will be even better if your coworker shows up while you're doing count and report to your manager.  You do not have to spend more than 15 mins past your clock out time, and in most cases it's expected you show up 15 mins early so you don't have to stay late.   I work in Ontario.  Do not abandon your pts. Notify your manager immediately. You need to look out for yourself and no one else."
nursing,3dxpyg,babylove8,4,Mon Jul 20 17:11:42 2015 UTC,"Gosh I'm so sick of this. I know where I am I'm not allowed to leave until I get report (as others have said, it would be abandonment.)  Usually it's 15-20 minutes, at least once every 2 weeks it's 45 minutes to an hour, but I've been stuck 3, 4 hours after I was supposed to leave just because they didn't find anyone to pick up the shift.   Nobody every gets written up, it's a lot of bullshit. But, they pay well, my schedule is perfect, and I can take off whenever I want, so I deal with it.  Plus I wind up racking up some overtime?"

nursing,3dzgr2,aj0220,10,Mon Jul 20 20:00:13 2015 UTC,Certificates without experience are meaningless.
nursing,3dzgr2,conundrum2,3,Mon Jul 20 20:04:30 2015 UTC,I have to agree especially with ACLS and PALS.  You can memorize the ACLS algorithm all you want but I don't think it really truly sinks in or is understood until you have seen or been involved in a code and have given/been exposed to the medications and have experience reading arrhythmias.    I would talk about your desire to obtain certificates in your interviews but really encourage you to wait. I would think about perhaps joining some professional organizations to show interest in genuine desire to the area you want to enter. You often get magazine subscription included so you can stay up-to-date on evidence-based care.
nursing,3dzgr2,nurse_kiki,2,Tue Jul 21 00:29:31 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree.  Having ACLS before you start working isnt necessarily to know what to do during a code situation. Sure, itll help, but what it really does is show HR/management that you are willing to go out of your way to get what you need, and get it done.  Also, when you are a new graduate and the only thing that differs you from the 20 other new grads is you already have ACLS, that is a big help."

nursing,3dzgr2,frecklyface,4,Mon Jul 20 20:12:14 2015 UTC,"I also disagree, I think it would be worthwhile to hold ACLS and PALS.  More and more online applications won't even let you move forward with applying if you check the no box when asked if you have both ACLS and PALS."
nursing,3dzgr2,PRNmeds,2,Mon Jul 20 23:36:02 2015 UTC,"For new grad positions I've applied for, a lot of departments want you to have at least ACLS certification before your actual start date, so I wouldn't say certifications without experience are meaningless."
nursing,3dzgr2,hypnopaedias,2,Tue Jul 21 00:54:54 2015 UTC,"Certifications are pretty meaningful when you have zero experience.  It is a new graduate. You cant expect years of experience.  However when you look at their application and they have ACLS and the other 10 new grads dont, when all else is pretty much equal, it says a lot.  Its also one less thing the unit manager needs to have the new hire do."

I find it really unlikely that someone is willing to hire you and wait for you to come back from maternity leave to start. I think your best chances are to wait until you have your baby, and then begin to reapply for positions right after that.   However, if you work in an area that is experiencing a shortage, it may be worth it to go on the interview."
nursing,3e00hl,Nerkanon,4,Mon Jul 20 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"Yes - it's a numbers game! Keep applying to any and all acute care positions.

nursing,3e00hl,elac,2,Tue Jul 21 00:13:19 2015 UTC,"The reality is a hospital who hires out of state, new grads into the ICU is unlikely a facility with great moral, nursing care, experience, etc. You will become a better nurse staying in CA and working your way up - apply to every med/surg, telemetry, ED and ICU job - you've got your BSN. You just need to claw your way up."

nursing,3e00hl,PRNmeds,2,Tue Jul 21 20:23:49 2015 UTC,"Its all about face time, you need to meet some managers. Middle management is constantly getting rolled over, most unit managers only last a couple years. Despite their high turnover nearly every single one of them has the power to choose what nurses come to work in their unit. Find a way to make yourself more than just a piece of paper in a stack.  Find a way to go to events, walk into the HR department and ask to meet the nurse recruiter face to face. They may remember you later, or be more likely to pass on your resume. Inquire about who the active nurse manager is on different units. Getting their name should be simple, send an e-mail or call them to try to schedule a tour of their unit. Express that you're considering applying for jobs in that field/area. Hand deliver resumes during these 'tours' on stronger resume paper.  There are a lot of options, if you want it bad enough, you'll find a way to make it happen. Just casually throwing resumes into the wind is unlikely to be a winning strategy."
nursing,3dzp5v,helpisonthewayRN,2,Mon Jul 20 20:58:23 2015 UTC,"The NP's that I've seen be the most successful were ones who had recent relevant experience in the types of units they were interested in working.  example: If you want to take a job as an NP in a pediatric CVICU but have never worked as a pediatric CVICU as a floor nurse, you're likely going to have a hard time. With your experience I think it would make sense to seek work in an ED, or as an NP for a cardiologist."

Pregnant women are a huge nono in research, so a Stat pregnancy test usually meant bad news.

It can be extremely busy and chaotic but not like running around trying to hand out fists full of meds and fluffing pillows kind of busy. Give it a try if that interests you. Maybe talk to the ICU or ED manager and ask to follow around one of their nurses for a shift to see if it's a good fit. Either way, good luck."

A friend of mine recently completed an assignment and the negatives he shared with me are that the places willing to pay for traveling nurses are probably very understaffed, if you've been a nurse in any capacity you should be aware of the risks for patients and your license if you get stuck in a bad situation.

If you need to, take some time off school and work as an aide. Get focused, go to a different school, and try again. But, apply to your school's nursing program anyways.

I know healthy nurses in their 30s who are DNR because they don't want to ever end up on a vent.  In fact I call double bullshit because she wasn't a ""healthy"" 89-year-old. Not anymore. Not after multiple strokes and multiple codes. Is somebody trying to say this patient could expect a full recovery without any major chronic sequelae?  Further, if a family member insisted on interventions but refused pain medications (!), and the physician went along with it, any competent nurse should have been on the phone with the ethics department or at least the medical director within about four seconds.

It is also legal for nurses to chart in French if they prefer (though most will chart in English) and you will obviously need to know how to read those notes if they do.   I know that they have recently built a new hospital called the Glen Campus and my guess is that they are also primarily English speaking.   English, in general, in Montreal is pretty accepted, but you will have a couple of people who will either force you to speak it by only responding to you in French or people who will be rude to you because you're speaking English in Quebec. Those people are few and far between.

nursing,3dscx5,darkbyrd,6,Sun Jul 19 00:18:51 2015 UTC,"I used to do the same thing. The ONLY thing that stops me from biting is weekly manicures. I get shellac nail polish, because it does not chip.

My solution is to keep nail clippers with me at all times. You can't bite cleanly trimmed cuticles, and if I start to get a hang nail, you can just clip it away so you can't bite it. I have a set in my car, in my pencil case, in my husband's car, my bedside table.   I still stress bite at times, but this has helped me make a huge difference."

nursing,3dqdtk,RunTotoRun,23,Sat Jul 18 12:55:24 2015 UTC,I once had a family film an entire code. From us calling the initial code to transporting the patient to the morgue. I didn't even realize they where filming until TOD was called and we began to clean up. Not a word from the nursing supervisor who was in the hall the entire time and being nights there wasn't a lot (or any other) leadership around. The whole situation felt very uncomfortable and the family was very verbally aggressive and accusatory. Nothing ever came of it as far as I know but it's only been a year. The code was about as textbook perfect as we could expect to make it given the patients size and health status. I've had patients and family film procedures but this was the first and only time it was so aggressive and they didn't ask first. I'm not sure what the laws are in MO but with everyone carrying a smart phone this is just going to become more common.  Edit: Posted before finishing and providing context

nursing,3dqdtk,kb_rn,5,Sun Jul 19 04:42:20 2015 UTC,It makes absolute sense that you shouldn't be able to film. There is an absolute expectation of privacy within the walls of a hospital room. Why wouldn't this flow both ways?

On this consent it states they are not allowed to take pictures of any hospital equipment or of staff without permission.   The first time I see you take a pictures especially of a patient (Icu setting) I ask to see consent, no consent I advise of policy and ask to delete the picture. People generally do. If the answer is no or I see the person taking a picture again security can be called and they are escorted off the property. After this action if they come back on the property they are now trespassing since they have been wanted and can be arrested for such.   It's pretty effective."

I think we did have one family of a patient (I never took care of this patient) who did try to film or take photographs without consent or knowledge of the staff. It was a big issue and a lot of nurses openly voiced their discomfort to the family about it, and management was involved. I can't remember what happened exactly, but the family wasn't happy and they were difficult to work with overall."

I vowed to be as helpful as I could when I got enough experience and knowledge, and around the 3-4 year mark, I started to be able to do this with the newer nurses. I loved it. I love being able to be a resource to people if I can, and teaching honestly does help reinforce the knowledge I already have or identifies gaps in my knowledge that I perhaps didn't know I had. I also once got a hug from a nursing student once, after I spent some time teaching her some tips about being more efficient with basic tasks, like doing a whole bed linen change.  Then, about a year ago, I transferred over to a step-down unit, where I currently work, and got to experience the lost, clueless, and overwhelmed phase all over again.

Kids man, while Abby is doing okay right now, things are tough, they don't know if she'd going too make it to tomorrow or next week or next month.  You (as a nurse) do some unusual things for kids when you don't know how long they have.  I've kissed boobos, dispensed bandids like there was a battle, I've comforted and cried.  I've celebrated, I've held babies in kangaroo care while they've passed on, while they've fought addiction.  I've seen the difference a special moment has for those kids.  Meeting a hero(so many hockey players), having a special day (had a little girl be ""princess"" for a day amazing-what about being batman for a day?)  can given these kids the boost.  Her dream was to get married, a little pretend wedding isn't so bad.

This isn't about that sex is a part of marriage, or mimicking the very real problem of child brides but just the professional standards I think we need to uphold in our profession, which also include the parents not having your phone number to call and just 'chat' with before the appointment. Another example in pedi hospitals nurses were always asked by parents to 'help at home'.

The 2nd is the more important for you as a nurse, the first is more relevant to the parents.  1) Imprinting on the child that when a man is nice to you, that it's ok to give them your body. 2) Marriage involves sex and love. You can love someone without marriage. It was a ""wedding,"" which to me implies sex later that night. She was even wearing white!"
nursing,3doi9a,imanedrn,65,Sat Jul 18 02:50:39 2015 UTC,"We understand marriage as those things.  But do you think a 4 year old little girl does?  Or does she see a special celebration for herself, perhaps like one seen in a Disney movie, where a little princess marries her prince, who helped her out of a terrible situation.    To even begin to bring up sex into this conversation is kind of gross."

nursing,3doi9a,melonmonkey,16,Sat Jul 18 08:57:31 2015 UTC,"Wow. I've worked PICU, among several other areas. All I saw in this video was a 4 year old girl who doesn't have a clue what adult concepts of marriage are. It reminded me of my sister's best friend's daughter who asked her mom and my sister (both of them) to marry her. The little daughter. Who is also 4. I think it's fucking fantastic if all a little kid thinks of marriage being is a way for happy people to bond. I mean, classically speaking, this sort of magical thinking is one of the greatest parts of childhood. Esp for a siiick kid."
nursing,3doi9a,organicvegetable,-5,Sat Jul 18 08:55:47 2015 UTC,"That was my point. A 4 year old has no idea what marriage is about. This isn't two kids pretending to get married. My blame is obviously not on her, it is on the nurse."
nursing,3doi9a,imanedrn,5,Sat Jul 18 13:55:06 2015 UTC,The nurse is her friend. He remembers what it's like to be a kid.   You have your own disgusting issues and are demented for bringing sex into this. I'm worried for the kids you work with.
nursing,3doi9a,organicvegetable,0,Sat Jul 18 15:04:57 2015 UTC,I don't think any of these people necessarily pose a threat to children. I think it highlights issues that so many adults have with sex - at least in the USA.

nursing,3doi9a,dustyoldbones,-9,Sat Jul 18 04:35:51 2015 UTC,"No the 4 year old doesn't understand sex. I think people are missing my point. The adult nurse does understand, that is why I thought it was inappropriate. I just would never, ever play pretend with a kid in an adult situation."

nursing,3doi9a,ENRN,2,Sat Jul 18 14:34:55 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree. My point was that jealousy for adults is different from the way children feel it, and it's particularly heightened when we're sexually bonded to someone.

My sister married, our dog, our dad (weekly), our neighbour our baby sitter, her best friend about a million times at this age.  Its play, pretend, and anyone who thinks it's anything more than that needs to get their head examined.   As a nurse working with these kids you will do anything for them. I mean anything. Your dying kid wants to meet his hockey hero.  You call your friends brothers, ex gf  friend, sisters, friend, brother and beg him to ask him mom to ask hockey heromom to ask hockey heroto call you.  Then beg said person to get on a flight (or charter one) because at this point the kid has ~24 hours left.  (true story).    Dreams are all these kids have, batman for a day, sure, Disney world? Use all of your vacation time to go, wanna meet a princess?  I will walk through glass to make this happen.  Wanna have a pretend wedding.  Let me tell my boss and they will get the cake and flowers and make this dream a reality.   I think the nurse is sweet, he's married IRL and everyone seems to understand this is pretend."

All the stuff you mentioned about hockey heroes isn't the same as marrying a child. Also, being married to an adult has never prevented people from being creepy so that doesn't really fly with me. I work with kids sicker than this even. I have created a campout in the middle of an ICU room for a 6 year old waiting for a heart transplant. My unit created a prom for a 15 year old who missed her prom from being in a hospital. I get the make believe and fulfilling wishes. Probably more than most who are down voting me. But I am telling you, this is weird. I don't expect everyone to agree with me as I initially anticipated downvotes. People may not agree with my initial comment of why I think it is weird and that is fine too. It is hard seeing a kid that sick and our first instinct is to do whatever they want.

Then one day I applied and got a call back and they hired me on the spot. My new manager said she loves nurses with med/surg experience!  I ended up getting hired on an L&D unit within the hospital network I already worked. I think that's your best bet, though I am sure you have already tried this. It took me years, so just keep applying to every posting, days, nights, evenings, weekends, per diem, whatever they post! Try sending an email to the L&D manager at your hospital expressing your interest and ask them if they have any advice on how to get a job on their unit.  Join AWHONN, take fetal monitoring and NRP. Make some friends that work in L&D!"

How did you ask?  If it helps the patient, I try to do any and all tasks assigned regardless of what it is.   Also, I respect all my staff members regardless of CNA or nurse.   Does it have to be this hard or am I just too sensitive?   I'd need a lot more information, but based on what you said, I can't even imagine that happening where I work.  The ONLY time I felt like telling a nurse to fuck off is when they're bitching at me to ignore the patient and chart so I don't have to stay late and do it.

Although, where I work, most of us try to help each other out.

I chose to ignore her - my role hadn't changed and i basically had to make some serious eye contact every time i asked her to do her job and help me as a fellow CNA. took a few months but it worked out. i will say, i am so glad i left before i became a nurse because that would have surely gone as awful as you are saying. good luck!"
nursing,3dp75f,jareths_tight_pants,4,Sat Jul 18 04:03:41 2015 UTC,"I find stories like these shocking.  Where I work, CNAs become nurses all the time and there is always a lot of respect.  I love my CNA co-workers and they usually become good nurses.  I can only think of one case where that was not correct.  She became a charge nurse and the power went to her head.  She makes decisions not in the patients best interest in an effort to impress the nurse manager."
nursing,3dp75f,rubberduckythe1,4,Sat Jul 18 04:38:56 2015 UTC,You absolutely have the right to delegate CNA tasks when you're working as an LPN. It sounds like either they had a really bad day or they're jealous/bitter that you're now a nurse. Did you confront the CNA when it happened? I find that being direct is best. If she's just being butt hurt because she's jealous then she needs to learn how to be more professional.   The first year is absolutely the fucking worst. You'll cry on the way home. You'll cry/dread driving to work. You'll think about quitting once a week if not more. You'll wonder if you're incompetent and if you should even be doing this. These are all completely normal feelings for a new nurse.

A lot of preps will neglect psych meds, alternative medicine therapies, and isolation.  Make sure to be very comfortable with those topics too. There are some great isolation mnemonics on youtube that will help you remember things. Above all else, take your time, don't rush.  It's easy to let your nerves get to you and start clicking answers haphazardly.  You have lots of time.  Use it! If you start getting nervous, pause a moment and do some slow breathing.  If you get too anxious, maybe use a restroom break.  It's important to keep a clear head.  You'll do great! You've made it this far, so you have all the right stuff.  One more hurdle."

They have days they can request off, of course, and I do have a coworker who never works Thursday, but they aren't really given freedom to choose otherwise.   I've previously worked for a hospital where scheduling ""opened"" six weeks prior and besides your weekend commitment, you could kind of choose your days based on what was still available. You still inevitably got moved around a little bit when the final schedule was confirmed, but it was nice.  But really, it depends on the policies where you work. Mayo Clinic, for example, requires many of its nurses to swing shift - so you may work days for a few weeks, and then nights for a few weeks.   Personally, I enjoy waking up and going...enh, I have nothing better to do today, might as well work! So I call my scheduling office and they tell me which one of 22 units I should go help out on. No weekends, no holidays. System floating is the best thing that's happened to me as a nurse."

If I can't work Wednesdays, I don't schedule them, but I also put an 'requested off' on my calendar so they don't put me on one anyway.  It's more like I work two on, one off, one on, two or three off.  My hospital is very understaffed right now, so there's incentives for working OT, which I snapped up, so it's even more hectic.  But yeah, where I work, it's definitely more split up due to the weekend rules."
nursing,3dpr3v,blizzardofhornedcats,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:01:25 2015 UTC,"I'm a 7p-7a weekend only nurse. This means I only work Friday and Saturday nights and have the rest of the week off. I get 4 weekends off a year with full pay for those weekends. Fortunately, I still receive full time benefits and full time pay AND I am able to pick up extra pretty much whenever. It's a sweet schedule if you don't have a family."
nursing,3dpr3v,GorillasonTurtles,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:36:25 2015 UTC,"4 ten hour shifts, a day, maybe two at the most during the week on call, and then about one weekend a month on call.

nursing,3dpr3v,StefaniePags,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:01:01 2015 UTC,"3 12-hour shifts, every other weekend. We have self scheduling, but I am pretty open, so I let the person who finalized the schedule fit me in whatever days she needs, as long as I don't do more than two in row. Other people like to bunch all their shifts together. I work on a large unit, so its pretty easy to get off specific days for school or other commitments."
nursing,3dpr3v,jareths_tight_pants,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:36:35 2015 UTC,I work nightshift and do 2 shifts in a row max. My floor keeps us pretty busy and I just can't do 3 in a row yet. We have to work 6 weekend shifts per 6 week period. And if you call out on a weekend shift they get to schedule you for another one. Yay.
nursing,3dpr3v,wicksa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:20:05 2015 UTC,"7pm-7am every saturday and sunday with 16 hours of on-call a month.   The non weekend people work every other weekend (sometimes just one weekend day) and varying days during the week. They can put in requests for days they don't want to work, and the scheduler tries to accommodate if it doesn't leave us short staffed."
nursing,3dpr3v,Pink_Raku,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:45:11 2015 UTC,"Our department offers flex scheduling. Once a month at midnight on Saturday night you have to stay up and fight with the other flexers to choose your days for the next 4 weeks. You have to choose the shift you are scheduled (7-7, 9-9, etc,) and you have to.work 3 weekend shifts a month.    I personally don't flex and am part time. So I work 2 days a week.  Every place is different though."

nursing,3dpr3v,OBNurseScarlett,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:03:51 2015 UTC,"I worked 12 hour night shifts for almost 2.5 years. 3 per week, plus mandatory call hours, plus an occasional extra partial or full shift, plus any pre-scheduled holidays (we rotate our holiday assignments so the same people aren't stuck working the same holidays year to year). My unit does self scheduling, we had to work at least 1 Friday, 1 Saturday, and 1 Sunday each 4 week pay period. We have 3 groups on a rotation so we take turns filling out the schedule first. If you were in the 3rd group to schedule, you often worked a lot of weekends - usually 3 out of the 4 instead of 1 out of the 4 - but thankfully that happened only once every 3 months. Over the past 2.5 years, I had some months where my schedule was really crummy and I had some where it was really great.  I recently switched to a different position on my unit and I now work 5 7-8 hour shifts, no nights, no weekends. I go in at 4am and leave at 11am or noon, depending on what's going on (I usually help relieve for lunch, so I'll stay a little later sometimes to help make sure coworkers get their lunch breaks). I've been on that schedule for 2 weeks now and while I'm still adjusting to getting up at 3am 5 days a week, I like it. Being home every night, having my whole weekend off...those are both really nice. I still have to rotate my holidays and I'm supposed to take mandatory call, but having a relatively set schedule makes life easier."

If your in school and need certain days off they work with you as long as you get your hours. We have a few people who work the same schedule period due to other jobs.   at my job we only work our assigned shift (days or nights) we don't rotate at all.

It would be more rare to find a psych unit that treats ONLY depression, that doesn't mean that position doesn't exist somewhere however.  I spent a year in psych as a nurse and really enjoyed my time there. I would recommend giving it a try you'll learn skills in that field that will serve you your entire career.  Nurses play a huge role in working with patients with depression. You get way more contact time with the patients, and get the ability to develop real connections with them because you'll often spend 8, to 12 hours with them day after day."

Many didn't get back to me, but I also heard back from a few and was able to set up interviews that way.    If you have never worked in a hospital before then make sure to emphasize your clinical experiences.  If you've worked as a PCT/CNA make sure to utilize that experience to your advantage.

There's only one Children's hospital in our area though so that made it difficult to get in.    Apply to floor jobs at the children's hospital you want to work at as well and then you would be able to transfer after gaining experience.

Are they suggesting that the hospital should fire her because she made a mistake but she should be free to go work at another facility instead?  I see what you're saying about no scissors near an IV but I don't follow that myself. I occasionally use scissors around IV's/art lines when the dressings are so stacked up you simply cannot get to them. I've never gotten near cutting off anyones digit, but I can only imagine that it was a terrible accident.  If the nurse was being very careless, lazy or doing it in the dark, that is also a different story. I still see this as a really unfortunate accident."

nursing,3dnjlg,oven_toasted_bread,5,Sat Jul 18 01:58:36 2015 UTC,"cardiology is a broad term. In Acute Care, nurses do CTICU, CCU, Medical Tele, Surgical Tele, Cath Lab, Physio lab, Infusion Nursing etc.   Heres what I'll say about cardiac nursing in general. Hospitals, surgeons and cardiologists have done an excellent job of streamlining admissions for most cardiac related problems. You'll get your patients that are non-compliant or have significant co-morbidiites that change the course but for the most part, and especially at facilities that don't do high risk procedures, the care is very regimental. CTICU nurses will wean an open heart autonomously, knowing how each surgeon prefers to do so. Some docs like Propofol, some like precedex, some like Levophed, some like Epi. Some want chest tubes out post op day one, sometimes the patients are in surgical tele before they come out. You're probably not familiar with much of this but the point is day 1 is surgery, they're out at 3pm and by 8pm they're extubated and by 6am they're in a chair in their TED stockings and by 8am they're walking... time to go to the Tele!  Telemetery, Medical and Surgical or a mixture of both, are very busy units. Patient's don't typically stay long so you do a lot of admissions and discharges and depending on the unit, you can take anywhere between 4 and 8 patients!  The job is fast paced and stressful in an entirely different way than CTICU nursing but its a job to be respected and commended just as much because being on top of up to 8 patients and all the care they need and catching a problem before its becomes a big problem requires a great nurse.   Procedure based jobs like cath lab and physio lab (in many places they're the same unit) has its own subsection of procedural nurses that are in the room for the case and post op nurses who manage the patients afterwords. These jobs can be anything from relaxed to down right full tilt stressful, and the day can go from one end of the spectrum to the next in a blink of an eye. They'll also usually require you to be on call some times.  Infusion nursing is fairly new in the arena but has been a very successful program in managing things like Congestive Heart Failure. This job entails some community outreach and patient follow up, and management of patients who simply come into the hospital for quick in and out management of their disease process. Many times its just patients coming in for diuretic therapy. The part of the job thats interesting is that its a community health job and education and outreach are a big focus. Keeping patients on track with their health management is the best way to reduce hospital admissions.  Im not personally a cardiac nurse, but I've dabbled in enough fields in nursing where I've been exposed heavily to each of these areas, I'm sure someone else can elaborate.   It sounds like you're thinking about Medicine, thats a whole different point. You're going to do clinics and all sorts of other non-acute care things that a nurse who works outpatient would have to discuss."
nursing,3dnjlg,lwhatley,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:57:56 2015 UTC,Very well said. Bravo. Especially your portion about CTICU nursing...can't even thing of anything to add to it.
nursing,3dnjlg,TheSA_Node,4,Mon Jul 20 14:25:38 2015 UTC,"Overall, I love it!  On my unit, we deal with a lot of critical patients that require pretty awesome interventions to manage (i.e., IABP, VADs, Swan-Ganz/PA pressures). I also get to know our patients really well with extended stays & recurrent admits.  The down side I've noticed is it's hard not to become jaded after a while. A lot of patients are noncompliant and killing themselves slowly or have a genetic predisposition to their heart failure."
nursing,3dnjlg,ENRN,3,Fri Jul 17 20:43:05 2015 UTC,"You think cardiac patients are bad, try a renal pt!"
nursing,3dnjlg,OneWipeCharlie,2,Fri Jul 17 21:28:15 2015 UTC,"In the critical care setting, cardiac nurses have to understand the kidneys very well alongside cardio-pulmonary function. Its not uncommon to see older age post-op heart transplants  pts. with cardio-renal syndrome who may need CRRT or we may have to continue to push/pull fluids to keep that Cr in check."
nursing,3dnjlg,ENRN,2,Sat Jul 18 05:16:34 2015 UTC,"Oh I know - but when it comes to compliance, renal patients (due to the toughness of the disease/treatment) are the worst a long with psych patients. Cardiac non-compliance was always pretty minor in my experience."
nursing,3dnjlg,Nationofnoobs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:31:41 2015 UTC,"In nursing school I spent 16 weeks on a renal floor that has dialysis capabilities. Essentially, any patient with any renal condition in the entire hospital was shipped to this floor but most of the patients were CRF, ARF, And ARI.   It's so sad to see a patient basically drown to death. If the patient was lucky, the potassium would get high (or low) enough to send the patient into a code and the patient would die fairly quickly.   It wasn't until that time in nursing that I actually connected the importance of the the kidneys and urine."
nursing,3dnjlg,ENRN,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:04:20 2015 UTC,They say kidney disease is one of the more comfortable ways to die -
nursing,3dnjlg,Nationofnoobs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:30:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're right. But, I personally don't see it being a fairly comfortable way to die. Between the electrolyte imbalances and the pulmonary edema it just seems miserable to me.   But, I was only on a renal floor for 16 weeks. So, I don't have nearly as much experience in renal stuff than an actual renal nurse haha."
nursing,3dnjlg,NurseRattchet,3,Sat Jul 18 15:01:38 2015 UTC,"You post-op them from surgery, post op day 2 they get assigned a heart healthy diet, and ask for a double bacon cheeseburger. You do your best to educate, their family sneaks them one anyways.  In all reality it is very interesting, you see a lot of really fascinating procedures and get to know the preferences of the different surgeons and care for each of their patients a bit differently. You learn a lot about arrhythmias and heart meds which is really fun. The one thing that burnt me out of cardiac nursing was the compliance-these patients tended to have a lot of bad habits they weren't willing to break even when they were staring death in the face. But to be fair that happens in all areas of nursing."
nursing,3dnjlg,PRNmeds,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:19:17 2015 UTC,"It seems to be a going concern that patients don't care too much about their health. This is something I hadn't considered, but is really good to know!"
nursing,3dnd0p,Derparita,9,Fri Jul 17 17:56:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with the previous two comments. While it is awesome that you connected so well with this pt and love your job, I think there are a few red flags here. I recently had a training session where we discussed the signs of over attached caregiving. A big red flag is the thought ""I can take care of this patient better than anyone else."" If you stay in this job, you are making a pretty significant financial sacrifice, because you believe you are necessary for the pt to receive the best care, which isn't necessarily healthy. I agree with the others, give a lot of notice and train a new person, but I think its time to move on.  Best of luck with your decision - I think no matter what you sound like an amazing nurse, and there are a lot more people out there that could benefit from you taking care of them!"

You need to do what is best for you, no one else in this world will - this is especially true with employment. The concerns of the change in caregiver and the stress associated with it should be concerns for the parent and not you - you will have enough to worry about with your new house. :-)  I think it is awfully unfair that the family put you in this position - your duty to them, should never be above your duty to yourself and your family. Unless they are willing to dig into their pockets, and cover the difference I do not think it appropriate for them to even approach the subject of you not working more.  I would personally be looking for another job."

nursing,3dm137,destroyingtocreate,14,Fri Jul 17 10:41:16 2015 UTC,"Push it! A little bit of air in the GI tract doesn't matter. That's why we burp. Gravity set up just wastes supplies when the same job can be done with a syringe. If something isn't crushed up completely and is going to potentially clog my system I want to feel it when I push instead of coming back 15 minutes later and finding my gravity meds still there. You're not overfilling the patient by pushing a 60cc syringe full of crushed pills in at once. It's the same concept as if they swallowed a cup of pills and chased it with a cup of water.   Edit: Also, you push it and flush and leave. You don't have to bug the patient again by coming back to disconnect and flush the gravity set up.  Edit 2: Gravity PEG meds aren't a hang and leave thing. It's a funnel system. TIL"

nursing,3dm137,wicksa,2,Fri Jul 17 16:01:18 2015 UTC,Be aware of your non-alert patients too and their desire to pull out tubes. I'll push meds if the patient has a tendency of pulling on lines.
nursing,3dm137,Kurerabear,5,Fri Jul 17 16:33:03 2015 UTC,"I like Gravity with PEGs, goes much smoother I think, less likely to explode into the atmosphere if the syringe slips for some reason. I'll push if the meds are particularly viscous but still never forcefully."
nursing,3dm137,LadyMegs,3,Fri Jul 17 11:56:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like gravity is more likely to come disconnected, due to the patient or movement, and you come back to find a bed full of dissolved. Just hold the tip of the syringe at the connection and push gently."

If you've got a thin enough liquid you're pouring in it takes seconds to go in through the tube. We don't do a set-up and leave (at least not at my facility).
nursing,3dm137,zipsgirl4life,2,Fri Jul 17 13:39:13 2015 UTC,"Forewarning: if you use gravity without a setup but pour the meds and water in, make sure your patient isn't coughing. Or atleast have a spare set of scrubs or don't mind running to surgery for a clean pair."
nursing,3dm137,Itawamba,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:18:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, I discovered this early on, the hard way. I sort of angle the tube away from me now and I pour continuously instead of filling the syringe all at once. Thankfully none of my current pegs have coughs."
nursing,3dm137,zipsgirl4life,2,Fri Jul 17 14:57:09 2015 UTC,I see what you're doing.  Wouldn't pulling those liquids out of the cup with the syringe and then pushing them into the peg reduce your chance of spillage? I would worry about a patient arm coming up while I'm standing there holding what is basically a funnel.

nursing,3dkps2,fetalbeej,5,Fri Jul 17 03:16:43 2015 UTC,"Because the face of healthcare is changing. The terms ""doctor"" and ""nurse"" no longer always mean what people are thinking about today.  I actually went to medical school, completed a year of it, and then voluntarily left it behind because I was so disillusioned by the culture. I will preface however that every medical school is different and I am by no means judging the entire education system / profession as a whole, but I just wanted to share my personal experience.  When I went to become a doctor, I was motivated by the gentle, human level of care depicted by characters such as Dr. McCoy from Star Trek (a 60's show). I wanted to be a family doctor, someone who you would go to wholly to feel better, whether it be through medicine or alcohol; obviously this wouldn't happen in reality, but I describe it like this to illustrate the human level of contact I valued in the profession. I was pursuing an ideal, but it was a thought that kept me motivated over the grueling road that is medical school.  When I began doing preceptorships in medical school, many of the doctors would lament that the ""Golden Age of Medicine"" was over and now insurance companies follow their every movement through the mandatory electronic medical records. To doctors who grew up in job conditions where they originally had more freedom, the profession to them now felt like salty legal work. Did they click the ""patient education"" button in the EMR upon realizing they were a smoker? Did they document that they ""counseled"" the patient on alcohol abuse? Did they make a note in their chart that this patient talks too much and will set your appointments back by 45 minutes? To them, the profession was now about covering their asses so that the board wouldn't come after them. It's part of the reason why ""firing"" problematic patients is more of a thing now.  Once again, don't get me wrong. There are doctors who adapted magnificently to the changes in healthcare and do a great job connecting ""humanly"" with their patients. But as a naive wide-eyed medical student, seeing so many doctors tell me otherwise was just... disappointing.  Now the medical school culture didn't help either. I had wanted to pursue primary care from the beginning. When going through med schooling however, a ""family doctor"" is the lowest possible tier of becoming a doctor -- board scores don't have to be very high above the pass-line to become one, and some students who were originally aiming higher would later get ""stuck"" with family practice. It was a culture that looked down on one's fellow students even though they were going through the same classes as you for 8+ years. Once again, I remind you that this sort of thing varies from school to school.  At the end of the day, I just began to realize that the job I had ""signed up"" for when I started attending medical school was not the job I had in mind. Incredibly naive and wasteful I know, but here we are. Old timey doctors were different from the doctors today, just as old timey nurses were different from the nurses today. I had wanted to pursue the idea of the old timey doctors who didn't enter and exit the room in the span of 5 minutes to retain their numbers. I soon began to realize that such a role is better suited to the responsibilities of a nurse today.  So, that was long-winded of me, but I wrote all that to sort of point out that not everyone realizes the level of autonomy/practice nurses now have when they ask someone why they chose to be ""just a nurse"". And as you and I both know, things aren't always rosy in health care, even in the nursing field (heck, someone would say especially in the nursing field) -- but it sort of comes down to whether or not a field is meeting your expectations. Medical school is tough, and so is nursing school! In order to keep moving forward, one shouldn't let themselves get caught with their pants down (like dumbass me) when it comes to expectation.  Me, I wanted a career that could let me connect with others on a human level. I know it will never be to an idealistic Dr. McCoy level and I know that some patients make me want to sit in a corner and weep, but damn if I'm spending my time and money for 8+ years to become a paralegal disguised as a doctor. Some people can do an amazing job in a medical career that way -- it just wasn't something for me. Aside from my obvious value of humanity, I also want to celebrate it with the flexibility of nursing. I want to spend time with my children or teach at the community college because such things are important to me. Life is about balancing things out so that you live on your own terms, and nursing allowed me to do that far better than medicine did.  ((No disrespect intended to doctors / medicine / med school! I just wanted to share my personal experiences I dealt with.))  TLDR; Doctors/nurses in the field don't always match what people imagine when thinking about doctors/nurses. My naive self didn't realize this and left medical school because of it. Ended up pursuing and enjoying nursing due to it offering what I was originally looking for in doctors + flexibility of my time."
nursing,3dkps2,starstuff89,2,Fri Jul 17 12:39:51 2015 UTC,"Very interesting experience.  I was headed down the same road, in high school I went to a camp for kids who were interested in careers in medicine. I also shadowed a couple docs, and became an EMT. As a result of all that exposure, I discovered Advance Practice Nursing, and come beginning of my senior year high-school I decided to peruse that instead of medicine.   I have worked the past 5 years as an ICU nurse, and am now back in school to complete my advanced degree. People don't realize how much collaboration goes on between nursing and medicine."

nursing,3dkps2,fetalbeej,12,Fri Jul 17 03:34:16 2015 UTC,"thank God I work in a unit where the doctors work with the nurses to treat the illness, instead of me ""treating the patient"" who so happens to conveniently have an illness. please, keep this crap phrase on your nursing school t-shirts. I collaborate with the doctors, respiratory therapists, PT/OT, techs, and of course, other nurses, to help heal patients of their illness.   ps- I hope you don't tell your patients' families ""oh we are doing this to treat their disease."" instead of something a little more thoughtful, even illness sounds better."
nursing,3dkps2,Nicakitty,-2,Fri Jul 17 17:07:30 2015 UTC,"It's not nursing school tripe.... Doctors are primarily trained as scientists who focus on treating the disease a person has. Nurses are trained as skilled, scientifically educated caregivers. It's literally the difference between the two professions."
nursing,3dkps2,zizou21,7,Fri Jul 17 06:43:35 2015 UTC,"The two things you said are not mutually exclusive.  Both professions approach the patient as caregivers in a scientific way.  Approaching the disease does not exclude the person having the illness.  Every disease process is ""patient specific."" We all can learn all the nuances about our specialties, but we still have to cater every intervention to the patient's response.  That's all true for both doctors and nurses."

nursing,3dkps2,aj0220,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:41:36 2015 UTC,"Well for one thing nursing is a lot more patient involved. You get to spend time getting to know a little about your patients where as most doctors are in and out. Yes, doctors make more money, but are you in it for the money or because you want a job that you're going to love? Because depending on where you work and if you are a nurse specialized in one particular field (i.e. peds, trauma, etc...) you are going to think that you have the best job in the world. Also, at the end of the day it was YOUR choice to become a nurse it was what you WANTED, so to be frank it's none of their business why you didn't become a doctor."

I work 12hr shifts and they are both physically and mentally demanding. The ER I work in sees around 200-220 patients on a normal day. I have a 4:1 patient to nurse ratio, so it's a lot of moving. Traumas, codes, anything critical where I really have to think and be on my game, those are the situations I enjoy being in. A lot of that is due to the fact that we are utilized as a doctor's office for a lot of people. Makes you appreciate the sick ones. We see gunshot wounds to runny noses. Infants to geriatrics. It's like any nursing job with its ups and downs, but I can't see myself going anywhere else."

I'm an ER RN, you do catheters a lot, almost certainly more than a floor nurse will.  Why?  You'll see many more patients per day, and theyre going to be the patients with a fever (cath to get  UA/UC on the urine) or a change in mental status (cath to get a ua/uc).  Kidney stones?  cath to get a ua/uc  etc etc the list goes on."

Females I like to go semi trendelenburg to tip them up so it's more eye level, I use the spotlight to really light up my surface, and if you can't find it you just have to ask the female to bear down and the urethra generally ""winks"" at you. The best time to find the urethra is when you are cleaning with a bath wipe prior to the iodine prep It really isn't that hard. Lube up really well - it isn't comfortable but I've never had a patient tell me (personally) that it was excruciating or painful. I've actually had patients compliment me on my cath skills LOL.   Caths are easy and routine. Honestly I've never dreaded a cath and I'm going on two years in the ER - I've got hundreds under my belt at this point. The part in the ER that makes it tough is the people who abuse the system - the people that don't manage chronic conditions and treat the ER like their PCP. Other than that I generally love my job."

nursing,3djqry,sweetbldnjesus,14,Fri Jul 17 12:51:18 2015 UTC,"hello!  ED RN checking in.  So, typical shift is way different than the floor.  You get there in the AM (if it's 7 am), find out if your patients are breathing or not/what they need/what they already have done (What I am getting at here is that ED reports are a little different than the floor - less detailed).  We are very task oriented and our day usually consists of check lists such as finish triage, get line get labs, get ekg, get pee, sent pee, chart, call report.  This all goes well until you get a critical patient or difficult patient.  Often the floor asks us to hold patients until they are less busy - but in the ED, patients can't be ""held"" or wait in the waiting room.  They will come back to your empty rooms while you have an arrest. Speaking of arrests, team work is AWESOME in the ED.  (at least where I work). I work 3-12s, but often pick up a LOT of extra time, making my shifts anywhere from 3hours long to 16 maximum. ' The job is very physically taxing.  I suffered a running injury last October or December and all I need is REST to get over it now - however, on my 12 hour days I am logging over 5miles at a minimum.  You must be able to be on your feet as there is sometimes no option to sit (goes with any form of nursing I guess).  You WILL run in the ED (we need the difficult airway cart! Crash cart! Central line cart!  etc02 monitor- all conveniently located on the other side of the ED!!).  Compressions are hard work, although the guys usually like to do them - being a girl, I have to fight my way in to do them!!  With all this being said, there will be days where you sit on your ass for hours on end thinking ""Good God, will somebody walk through the door?""  But you'll quickly regret saying that.. Or saying ""quiet"" or ""slow""  What other questions did I fail to answer??  I love talking about the ED!"
nursing,3djqry,404__not__found,0,Thu Jul 16 22:17:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that detailed response! What's your work setting, is it like a big hospital in a city area or something else?What is the ED? Whats the difference between the ED and the Floor? Do you do blood work? How often do you have to put in catheters? Do you have to move patients and heavy objects? Do you think the work is worth the pay? Do you ever feel overwhelmed by all the patients and tasks you have? Did nursing school really prepare you for what the real thing would be like? How often do you go back to specific information you learned in school like the electrolytes and kidneys stuff? And lastly what motivates you to continue working?"
nursing,3djqry,404__not__found,10,Thu Jul 16 22:27:03 2015 UTC,"I work with a big name company in a hospital right outside of a major city.  We are not a trauma center, but we are a stroke center.  The ED is the ""emergency department"".  When i say floor, I refer to floor nursing, like a medical/surgical floor, telemetry, or oncology floor.    We do our own blood work and insert IVs.  We do catheters multiple times a day.   We are responsible for moving heavy patients, no necessarily objects :) It can get ugly when you don't have a lot of help - but at the same time, team work is good, ,so moving heavy people can go very smoothly and your back can be happy.  There are a couple times where a patient has attempting to hurt staff.  Most of the time unintentionally - as in, a confused patient. Do I think it's worth the pay?  hmmm sometimes yes, sometimes no.  This last week when I had two of our most frequent visitors (seeking pain meds) while having a patient on very scary medications and sending another patient that we intubated to the city via helicoptor for a massive head bleed... No.  The days where that sweet little lady gives you a hug and calls you an angel are the best!  It's totally awesome when you have a few shifts in a row that everything goes smoothly, you aren't overwhelmed all day and patients actually thank you for your care.  But, you'll have bad days and good days in every job. I used to work for a drug store as a cashier, with much less pay.  It was absolutely lovely and I'd go back there in a minute if I could afford to live off that salary now.  But for what I make, I think it's a cool job - we are pretty informal with one another.  I mean hey! You get paid money to essentially wear PJ's to work! Still people witih needles!  Do compressions!  Restrain people!    Do I feel overwhelmed? At first yes, but you get u sed to the patient load and the tasks and it gets easier and easier.  At this point, I know when I need to call the nurse up front and say ""I need help""... which I hate admitting, but sometimes, you just need help with your assignment.  At some point though,, you'll realize that you can't get all five things done right NOW that need to get done.  You learn to prioritize and what is most important.  Some things just have to wait. Nursing school prepares you for your nursing boards.  I didn't start out in Emergency - I started on a step down floor with post-surgical open heart patients.  It was such a good place to start!  I learned so much.  Nursing school teaches you how to do everything properly.  You get to the real world and you start with your own ""ways"" and ""habits"" of doing things the way you do.  Its hard to explain.  Nobody can teach you how to organize your assignment - it's something you learn.  Uhmmmm often.  learning about the electrolytes, kidneys, basic A&P - you'll use every day as you interpret labs, rhythms... scenarios... It's all included in the critical thinking you do as a nurse.  nursing is ALL critical thinking - piecing everything together.  You have to know your shit and how to apply it.  but it comes naturally... I always think nursing is such a rough start to go from school into the field, but once you've been at it for 2-3 years, it kind of ""clicks"" and you realize what you are doing what you've been doing.  One day you think ""Oh I'm giving lasix to get fluid off this persons lungs - Ill need to look at kidney function and potassium - damnnit they're gunna have to pee every three seconds"" to the next day realizing ""this person has a low ejection fraction and poor cardiac function - I'm giving this lasix in order to reduce vascular volume and strain on the heart - this is necessary if the patient to have a good outcome""  What motivates me to keep being a nurse - this is interesting to me because up until recently I was thinking of leaving nursing.  There are A LOT of lawsuits and so much responsibility on a RN.  It's a scary field to be in.  It's kinda like ""I""m trying to do good for people and make them better, but they are constantly trying to bust me and get me in trouble and sue me"" (disclaimer: this may not be how everyone else feels - I'm a worrier)  But I kind of realized that there are SO MANY nurses that have made it to their retiring years without getting fired or losing their licenses.  You just have to be so careful in everything you do and most importantly SLOW DOWN!! Just slow down and think.  Every mistake I've made is because I was rushing, skipping steps.  Remember that you are going to make a med error one day - you are going to accidently hurt somebody - but you have to think of all of the good you do too.  medicine and nursing are practices - we are always practicing to improve the profession.  Oh and lastly, I am REALLY motivated by only working 3 days a week.  That's just fuckin awesome.  Edit:  Sorry for the wall of text."

nursing,3djqry,starstuff89,6,Fri Jul 17 00:37:43 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of nurses might recommend starting on a Med-Surg floor. They sometimes call these units ""the floor."" These are units where the patients are relatively stable and won't be receiving strong medications. Other units, such as the ICU (Intensive Care unit), the ED, PACU (post-anastesia care unit), NICU (neonatal intensive care unit), or maybe even a cardiac step-down or TCU (transitional care unit) would be considered critical care units. These units have patients that are much less stable and require stronger clinical knowledge and experience. The ICUs have the most critically unstable patients. It's not to say that a new grad can't work in a critical care unit, but it's desirable for nurses to have more experience before working on units like this."

At first it seemed like a downgrade since I thought the ER was more glamorous but to be honest, the experience I'm getting now is fantastic. The assignments are more stable, you get to know your patients and connect on a much more personal level. I'm honing my skills as well and I'm already seeing my critical thinking skills improve. Just my two cents.  Nursing is awesome. I love the pay, the hours are long but I wouldn't trade my 3 12 hour shifts for anything. I agree with everyone saying shadow if you can. I didn't get to shadow first, but I lucked out and love my career now. The administrative side sucks a bit sometimes but you learn to work with your management. Good luck!"

nursing,3djqry,404__not__found,2,Fri Jul 17 14:26:35 2015 UTC,"I'm working as a patient care tech (like a CNA) on a geriatric-palliative floor, and we have a good ratio of new nurses."

nursing,3djqry,PutYouToSleep,9,Fri Jul 17 05:43:12 2015 UTC,"Quite a few of us were hired as new grads into the ER.  So no, you don't need to work your way up; HOWEVER, there is a huge learning curve.  The ER is not the floor.  It's a totally different culture.  Someone else mentioned teamwork.  The ER is much more team oriented than the floor and that goes for not only the RN's but everyone in the ER - the MD's, techs, etc..."
nursing,3djqry,STDCatcher69,3,Thu Jul 16 23:53:12 2015 UTC,"I can bring a little bit of a different perspective. I recently graduated with my BSN and my role transition was in the ER at a large inner city ER. All of these responses sound exactly like my experience. I absolutely loved my time in the ED, but have chosen not to pursue a career there. I tend to be an adrenaline junkie and the ED most certainly gave me plenty of adrenaline. I was pumped all day. I loved being on the move constantly. This was really fun for  the 120 hours I spent there, but I know that it isn't for me in the long run.  Although it was interesting and stimulating I know that over time I would wear myself out if I kept up at that pace, both mentally and physically. Also, one thing I didn't really realize about being in the ER is that they really have to focus ONLY on the problem at hand. I am extremely detail oriented and want to know everything about all of your history and everything that is going on with you..... you absolutely do not have time to deal with that in the ED. You also have to rely very much on teamwork. It is absolutely vital that you have a good team, because you cannot do everything yourself. Personally, I prefer to do all/most of my patient care. Not to say that all floors/units don't rely on teamwork. This, along with not being able to fully connect with patients was extremely hard for me to get down.  This is just my experience, of course.  I passed the NCLEX a week and a half ago and start my first job in the ICU of a local hospital on the 27th (as a part of a residency program). From a little bit of ICU experience and from what I've heard it will probably be a better fit for me.   I hope this helps a little with understanding some of the unique things of the ED."
nursing,3djqry,rubberduckythe1,2,Fri Jul 17 14:08:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this perspective! I was thinking the same thing about wearing out my body and such, but I would probably switch from ED after a while like how you did. And just curious, you get to start working before doing the NCLEX?"
nursing,3djqry,Moses99,2,Fri Jul 17 14:30:25 2015 UTC,"Where I live (Ohio) you cannot start working as an RN (legally anyway) before you are licensed. My post probably wasn't clear, sorry..... I was officially licensed on the 13th (took them a week to update the BoN site) and my job will begin on 7/27. Some places will hire you before you are licensed on the condition that you pass the NCLEX, you just cannot actually start working until you are licensed.  It used to be that most places would do this, but not so much anymore unless it's a residency program (which is specifically for new grads)."
nursing,3djqry,zipsgirl4life,5,Fri Jul 17 15:32:10 2015 UTC,"Can I ask what your experience level is?

nursing,3dmehq,joneildu,3,Fri Jul 17 14:37:41 2015 UTC,"I think if you final goal is to get a BSN, then you should start with a BSN program. Every nurse I knew who initially got their ADN and went back for a BSN regretted not doing the BSN the first time. A few reasons being that in the long run, it ended up being more expensive. I have never crunched the numbers on my own but I think a lot of the bridge ADN to BSN programs are expensive. Another issue with the bridge program is that the programs are filled with a ton of fluff and busy work classes that truly have no influence on you grasping nursing better, making you more well rounded, and/or being a better clinician. Again that is what people have told me who have gone through it. I also dated some one was doing a bridge class and the classes she was having to take I thought were a ridiculously large waste of time. Many of the classes are just reading articles and then talking about them and writing papers. You have to do some of this in a BSN program but not to the extent of the bridge programs. If you go ahead and get your BSN, getting a masters later will be much easier as well if you choose to do so. Also, a BSN will make it easier for you to get away from the bedside if you choose to do that route as well. Just my thoughts and feelings on your situation. Good luck."
nursing,3dmehq,Tucc34,2,Fri Jul 17 15:39:47 2015 UTC,"I could not disagree with this more. Do your ADN first and work through your BSN. The opportunity cost of 1-2 years of work is tremendous.  You're 25, you have some gen ed stuff to knock out. Let's say you start nursing school at 27. You finish when you're 29. You start working and making, I don't know, let's presume $50,000 a year. That's $50,000 more you're making than if you were sitting in a classroom. I finished my RN to BSN program in a year. It was 25 credit hours to bridge. Super easy. Was able to do it while working without issue. If I would have went straight to a BSN program, I would have lost out on much more money in earned wages than a bridge program would have cost in tuition, not to mention most ADN programs cost less for the first two years than a university when you're knocking out those first courses. With ADN to RN, along with finishing earlier and entering the workforce earlier, you are only paying university tuition for about 25ish credit hours as opposed to the 60+ hours for doing the BSN off the bat.   Also, a masters isn't any easier to get doing a full BSN first as opposed to bridging. A BSN is a BSN is a BSN. My BSN from my university is the exact same as the BSN from the students who didn't bridge. There's no asterisk or footnote saying I bridged. It doesn't matter if you bridged it or not. Hell, you can actually go straight from your ADN to a masters and even a FNP without ever getting a BSN. There are programs offered for that.   Don't stress about how old you are. I went from a pre-law degree to social science secondary ed to nursing. I didn't start nursing til I was 28 years old I think. As I said, knocked the BSN out in a year. Hoping to enter a ccrn (edit, CRNA...currently studying the CCRN has my brain warped) program before I'm 35."
nursing,3dmehq,manimel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:26:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input! I have definitely been thinking about this more lately unfortunately, I do live near any universities. I'm actually getting my CNA at a community college that's 40 minutes away because of the one 20 minutes closer doesn't have a good record with transferring credits. This is one of my biggest debates."
nursing,3dmehq,diadexus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:59:40 2015 UTC,"Again, if you want to do nursing then do nursing. If you decide to do a BSN and get an ADN first, you now have to cover the cost of CNA school in addition to the ADN and then the bridge program. There are a million nursing programs out there. Some better then others. But they offer options and some allow you to do some one-line stuff in combo with clinicals so it reduces that amount of time you must spend on ""campus."" But they will still be some campus days that will be unavoidable. I do not know your current living situation but if you are not near a university, you may need to relocate in order to be at a place that can give you the education you are seeking. Do some research and prioritize your goals. Once you do that, it will be easier on making a decision on what you should do next."
nursing,3dmehq,organicvegetable,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:24:13 2015 UTC,You're right. That is definitely a lot to consider and I should probably step back from all of this for a little while. It's all I've been thinking about for about a month now.
nursing,3dmehq,krzymndy,2,Fri Jul 17 19:14:28 2015 UTC,I started over in my 40's.  It is never too late to go back to school if you put your mind to it.  It was hard being a broke college kid again but I did it.  A side effect was learning to better budget my money and time.  Most BSN bridge programs are done while you are all ready working and some are completely online.
nursing,3dmehq,organicvegetable,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:54:40 2015 UTC,"That is what I've read and I think it's a better route to take than wasting money going to a university for a BSN.

Then he'll be hired on as an RN, and can do the online RN-to-BSN program online and 90% paid for by the hospital.  He also wants to continue on to the MSN, which will also be paid for by the hospital and can do the vast majority of it online (this program also includes clinicals).  It's never too late!"

I worked during nursing school and didn't find it too difficult. The times when it was stressful was when I was working close to 40 hrs and being in school. If you are able to do part time that might elevate some of that stress. Hope that helps and good luck!
nursing,3djeku,Dozed,47,Thu Jul 16 19:21:24 2015 UTC,"Oh my god don't get me started.   Meditech is horrible in every possible way, and even some ways that are essentially impossible.  The UI is ridiculous garbage that requires memorizing special keys and magic combinations. (Shift-F6 to delete a carriage return!) Mouse support is a semi-functional kludge. Keys and mouse both work differently on different pages. Information display is cramped, outdated, and badly designed in the first place.  Plus the whole thing is ungodly slow, which is especially inexcusable because it's from the freaking 90s. Twenty-year-old software should run at blinding speed even on a damn wristwatch. If it's this slow on modern hardware it must have been entirely unusable when it was released.  I was a programmer before I went to nursing school. I have seen some bad software in my years. Meditech is literally the worst production software I have ever encountered. Calling it ""bad software"" is an insult to software. It is a travesty of a tragedy of a shitpile of a torture device, and its existence is a crime against ones and zeroes everywhere. I find its use offensive on a professional level both as a programmer and as a nurse.   Avoid, avoid, avoid."

nursing,3djeku,AjaxkidRN,4,Thu Jul 16 22:16:38 2015 UTC,"I thoroughly enjoyed your rant.   Thanks, but that wasn't even the rant. That was just my basic opinion. The actual rant includes detailed functional complaints, expert UI analysis, partial reverse engineering, graphs and diagrams, several emphatic gestures, a lot more swearing, plus speculation on the ability, ancestry, and drug habits of the so-called coders responsible for the thing and the profit-obsessed business managers who keep it out of the graveyard of richly deserved obsolescence.

Now, I don't want to get into a pissing match over ICU vs ER nurses, so I am only referring to my personal experience. Getting report from MY HOSPITAL'S ER is horrendous. I tend to be given report from any nurse who is available, regardless if they've laid eyes on the patient. Many of my questions, such as which meds did patient receive in ER are answered with ""I don't know this isn't my patient.""   I know it's crazy busy in the ER, and this type of report wouldn't be an issue if I could just look up in the damn computer what was given in the ER! But the Powers That Be saw it fit to have non- communicating software."
nursing,3djeku,ICU2printer,9,Thu Jul 16 20:23:19 2015 UTC,"At my first ED job, the whole hospital had Meditech, but inpatient nurses still couldn't access anything that had been charted in the ED. Apparently Meditech uses different programs for ED and inpatient (as opposed to one program with different UI) and they could not talk to each other.  Every time I admitted a patient, I had to print out the entire ED chart and send it upstairs by fax."
nursing,3djeku,auraseer,2,Thu Jul 16 20:35:45 2015 UTC,"That's weird. We had meditech up until last spring. I work in the ED and our charting was able to be viewed by the other floors. The only thing was the hospitalists couldn't put in admission orders via meditech because those wouldn't cross so we still had to use paper orders for admission until the doctor went upstairs to put in ongoing orders.  It is a really messed up system and I'm so glad we switched to epic. But of course, as with all computer charting, epic has it's own host of problems."

We did have maybe a two month period where an ED nurse was working on a project for his Masters to see how they could improve communication with novel concepts like bedside report at handoff, featuring the ED nurse who actually cared for the patient.   Strangely enough, it worked! For two whole months! And then his project was over and everything went right back to how it was before, getting a vague fragment of report from someone who never saw the patient, and occasionally just finding out they snuck in and dumped an admit on your floor without notifying anyone they were even there. Los bastardos."
nursing,3djeku,AmnesiaLab,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:55:24 2015 UTC,I think it might be the way your facility chose to setup.  Ours has it all as one but ER doesn't scan meds so we're clueless there.

So the report problem is never addressed.  This has happened to me. My patient arrives with blood running. Oh, didn't get that in report.  Patient comes up with  neo running. Oh, didn't get that in report.  The best was, while working in PCU, patient come up with a newly diagnosed 3rd degree heart block not on a heart monitor, and with just transport pushing the bed, no ER nurse at bedside.  Here's an example of Mr. ER's power:  Our ICU is going from 8 to 12 beds. We opened with 8 beds until we get the staff for 12 beds.  We're still becoming used to all the new systems and equiment.  ER director had a shit fit, wondering what was the point of opening a 12 bed unit if we're not using it! So, less then a week after opening all the float nurses are assigned to ICU so we could open at least 10 beds. If a nurse calls out on any of the other floors, sorry, you're shit outta luck, Mr. ER wanted more ICU beds open!  I've been off for 2 days. If tomorrow, when I go into work, all 12 beds are open I'll not be a bit surprised."

nursing,3djeku,mynameismaryjo,2,Thu Jul 16 21:09:51 2015 UTC,Oh my god I'm so sorry. We use epic in our OR and a very small amount of paper. I can't imagine having to do all my charting on paper at this point.
nursing,3djeku,vegasaurus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:00:56 2015 UTC,"Omg I miss EPIC so much. I have meditech now and I want to bash my head into the key board. My fiancé is at the same hospital as me and it is his first nursing job, I honestly think his experience is hindered by the ass backward system."
nursing,3djeku,uke_cupcake_cwon,6,Thu Jul 16 22:14:13 2015 UTC,"God I hate Meditech. Oh are you looking for an order? Better look in some random place for it, and wade through all the completed/cancelled orders first. I love me some EPIC"
nursing,3djeku,cutiepatootieadipose,4,Fri Jul 17 00:30:29 2015 UTC,"I HATE meditech. EPIC is the best EMR by far.  Meditech takes so long and sometimes it's chart by exception sometimes you have to check ""clean, dry, intact"". You chart things in the weirdest places and it takes forever to find information."
nursing,3djeku,kelseykelsey4,2,Thu Jul 16 22:09:22 2015 UTC,"That's why I chart only the bare minimum with the check boxes, in fact if you just went by my check boxes you would think this person is alive, breathing, alert and aware and that's it. But I always write a detailed narrative report head to toe on admission and every shift. My coworkers know that's where to look for information and management hasn't cracked down on me yet."
nursing,3djeku,lxpatterson,2,Fri Jul 17 03:29:39 2015 UTC,I like that idea.   I wish we were allowed to do that.   We have to mark the most we can.  It has taken me a long time to be able to chart anything at a reasonable speed.  I remember in school when I was using epic how I could chart on my 5 patients in less than 15 minutes.  Now I'm lucky if I can chart on 5 patients in less than an hour (the twice daily charting with head to toe assessment).
nursing,3djeku,SailorRalph,4,Fri Jul 17 23:27:46 2015 UTC,Meditech is all I know therefore I don't mind it...  I've hard people describe it as the ford pinto of electronic medical records...
nursing,3djeku,fuck_mods,2,Fri Jul 17 01:34:03 2015 UTC,the ford pinto of electronic medical records...   Love it.   Using it.
nursing,3djeku,SailorRalph,2,Fri Jul 17 23:38:37 2015 UTC,"At least a Pinto was made by people who had made cars before, and presumably knew how to drive.   I'd call it more like a Trabant-- made out of cardboard and boat anchors by unskilled Eastern European conscripts who had only ever seen cars in drawings. It has a 0.01 horsepower engine, there is no gas gauge, and every time you turn on the wipers it shifts itself into reverse."
nursing,3djeku,auraseer,4,Sun Jul 19 16:32:42 2015 UTC,Meditech is like 50% of the reason why I went to a different hospital.
nursing,3djeku,sunispan,5,Fri Jul 17 00:20:32 2015 UTC,I HATE Meditech with a passion.  I went from using EPIC to Meditech and it was the worst!!!  If you're at an HCA facility forget about getting another EMR. HCA owns Meditech.
nursing,3djeku,Salpie22,3,Fri Jul 17 02:59:25 2015 UTC,HCA?  Time to Google or someone to save me the trouble.
nursing,3djeku,SailorRalph,3,Fri Jul 17 23:35:19 2015 UTC,Hospital Corporation of America. They own several big hospitals.
nursing,3djeku,Salpie22,2,Sat Jul 18 17:30:27 2015 UTC,Thank you!  Got distracted by the family and forgot to look it up.
nursing,3djeku,SailorRalph,2,Sat Jul 18 18:08:49 2015 UTC,"True. But persistent rumor says HCA may be moving to Epic.   They have at least two pilot hospitals that have made the change, and that's true fact. (I believe they're in Utah?) The rumor is that the rest of the system will follow, with a few other facilities starting to transition within the next two years.   I haven't worked at HCA in years, and I am unable to find confirmation or denial of the rumor, but still it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling just thinking about it."
nursing,3djeku,auraseer,3,Sun Jul 19 16:40:37 2015 UTC,"We use Cerner/Powerchart and I feel the same way. I went from using EPIC to McKesson to Powerchart, so it's basically been a long decline.   Powerchart has slightly improved with a recent upgrade to a front page called Care Compass, but it is still light years behind EPIC.   Ugly & outdated EMRs need to catch the hell up."
nursing,3djeku,dandelion_k,5,Thu Jul 16 20:03:51 2015 UTC,"I did all my nursing clinical rotations in hospitals that used the Cerner PowerChart system, so I became pretty familiar with it. Then started my first job at a hospital that uses Meditech. Meditech is definitely the worst shit I've ever laid eyes on. It makes me miss my Cerner system daily."
nursing,3djeku,nickasarbata,5,Thu Jul 16 21:33:54 2015 UTC,"What is so much better about EPIC? I work at a hospital who uses Cerner and I used EPIC & Cerner during clinicals, and comparatively I was pretty underwhelmed by EPIC. Personal preference or are there specific features you miss that Cerner lacks?"
nursing,3djeku,mountainathlete,2,Thu Jul 16 22:33:42 2015 UTC,"It's more customizable, easier to read, and is a lot more idiot proof for other users and especially our doctors that aren't everyday users. Otherwise, mostly personal preference."
nursing,3djeku,dandelion_k,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:03:54 2015 UTC,I miss being able to customize my charting in a logical fashion and have the important stuff on top for quick glancing.  I miss epic
nursing,3djeku,SailorRalph,2,Fri Jul 17 23:30:30 2015 UTC,"The main thing I like about Epic is that there are multiple ways to do everything, but you only need to know one.  For instance I can think of at least four ways to enter vital signs in Epic. You and I can pick whichever way we find most convenient. If I use the ED vitals navigator and you use the flowsheet, the vitals all go to the same place, and each of us seamlessly see what the other one entered."
nursing,3djeku,auraseer,2,Fri Jul 17 03:12:36 2015 UTC,"So meditech started a new transfusion tab not long ago, for blood products.  I hate how my vitals do not cross flow from the transfusion record over to the vitals record and vice versa.    Doesn't it make sense for data from one source to be visible by another?     Why the fuck are they isolated? !"
nursing,3djeku,SailorRalph,3,Fri Jul 17 23:34:07 2015 UTC,"Because the people who plan, engineer, and code Meditech are a bunch of fuckups."
nursing,3djeku,auraseer,3,Fri Jul 17 23:43:43 2015 UTC,"I've charted at two hospitals, one had a ""cheap"" version of Cerner (when I was a nursing student) and the other (where I work at now) has Meditech.   Overall, I would say that Meditech does leaps and bounds over Cerner. At the particular hospital that I was a student at, we charted on everything, got to do Admits and Discharges.  Where Cerner is drop down box central and menus squished all over the screen, Meditech has nice, flowing charts that make charting easy. Granted, my hospital doesn't use every single, little feature of Meditech. We're just now getting blood admin added to it. So I might not be a good judge."
nursing,3djeku,brownsn1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:19:37 2015 UTC,Flow charts?  You must be using something else.   Unless you're talking about meditech failed attempt at flow charts.
nursing,3djeku,SailorRalph,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:37:57 2015 UTC,"I mean, it works for us for the most part. Our hospital has had it for 2 years now and they're still trying to make it fit to our needs. I think it's really up to your hospital in terms of what you chart on, what the items say, etc.  They just add and drop menus and prompts until something works. Or at least that's what my hospital does."
nursing,3djeku,brownsn1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:51:15 2015 UTC,"I think you're right about that.   As much as I wish my hospital would ditch it, they are beginning an upgrade here over the next few years so I'm here to stay."
nursing,3djeku,SailorRalph,3,Sat Jul 18 12:12:59 2015 UTC,"Thank god for EPIC. We just got the upgrade that lets us customize our UI colors/themes. 😊 I'm easy to please, obviously."

I find it kind of repetitive though. We are switching to EPIC this fall/winter and I am excited and nervous. I signed up to be a superuser so I will get first chance to learn the new system!"
nursing,3djeku,wicksa,2,Fri Jul 17 02:28:55 2015 UTC,"Don't be nervous.   We were all very nervous, but Epic is actually pretty intuitive... you can figure it out. Epic also has something called Epic Playground which is a mock-up of Epic that you can mess around with and teach yourself new things.  It's not perfect (I hate the careplans) but the rest is pretty good."
nursing,3djeku,AjaxkidRN,3,Fri Jul 17 03:58:45 2015 UTC,My hospital still uses paper charting. As400 for putting in orders for labs and diagnostic studies. Stone. Ages.

nursing,3djeku,golson3,2,Fri Jul 17 23:41:03 2015 UTC,AS400?  My brother works in motor freight and is always complaining about AS400.  Seems like an odd crossover between industries.

nursing,3djeku,Itawamba,3,Sun Jul 19 18:13:07 2015 UTC,"Had to make an account for just this post.  we have laptops at bedside on a swivel, so they understandably are unplugged by accident a lot. If you're charting meds while it crashes, that medication cannot be charted for or against until IT unlocks the sessions. That's often an entire shift for me on nights. So annoying and unsafe."
nursing,3djeku,dcnurse,3,Fri Jul 17 14:04:43 2015 UTC,"THIS is why I'm going into Nursing Informatics. Well, partially. I've used McKesson and two different styles of Cerner. I'm technologically savvy enough to get Cerner to work for me, but it definitely isn't user friendly for physicians. Most other hospital systems in the area use Epic, which I have heard rave reviews about and never myself used.   I seriously cannot wait until I graduate so I can have input in this madness."

Since most of the purse strings are controlled by business experts with no clinical training, it's quite hard to make that case to them."

How do I accomplish anything with this dinosaur?  It was a maze of menu options that didn't make sense, but once I figured it out, it's actually very efficient for lab.    My biggest complaint with Meditech is how different the lab and nursing/ED modules are.  It lends to a lot of bad communication between us because not all of the lab staff understand how the use the nursing module, so if you call with a question, you may get someone who has no idea how to help you.  It's also 5x more difficult to do anything in the nursing module than in the lab module."

Greys Anatomy scrubs were the best fit when it came to this issue."
nursing,3diz7o,PutYouToSleep,12,Thu Jul 16 17:45:48 2015 UTC,Motherfucking elastic waistband! Thought based upon my school scrubs I would chronically have my crack out. Turns out thats not the case.

nursing,3diz7o,snuffles00,4,Thu Jul 16 20:42:01 2015 UTC,YES! I live in Greys Anatomy scrubs too. They are so soft and you can control the drawstring. The only downside I found is most of the bands would lose stitching and some of my drawstrings would pop out rendering the scrub bottoms useless. I would get a ton of washes and use out of them though and I could generally find them for fairly cheap.

This is no good for any of us who have any amount of butt. Medium scrub pants have the right waist size and inseam length, but they don't actually fit, so instead I buy size large and shorten the hem a bit.   Other than size I look for pockets. My current set has 13 pockets in total (8 on the cargo pants, 5 in the top) and I pretty much always have something in each of them."

Also, as a guy it's frustrating not to find scrubs that are fitted to my torso, all of the scrubs really are for rectangle shaped people. As for pockets, lots of them. And having a zipper and a button on the pants is required for me to even consider buying a pair."

We walk a LOT and my scrubs always wear out crotch first!  A nice wide elastic waistband that's flattening and flattering for our many nurses who have a few cinnamon rolls. Not like maternity pants- but something secure, slimming and flat. I HATE the bunchy waistline that plain drawstrings make. It's crinkly and scratchy and adds another ""roll"" to our waistline.

nursing,3diz7o,hyong,8,Thu Jul 16 17:43:47 2015 UTC,"Male psych nurse here. I look for two things: 1.) durability and 2.) fit.  I'll elaborate...  1.)As a psych nurse, unfortunately I sometimes have to physically take patients to the floor if they become violent. I need scrubs that won't rip in the midst of a ""wrestling match"".   2.) It seems that most scrubs are made for people with average sized legs, bottoms, shoulder width, etc. I (and many other medical professionals) work out and have larger thighs and booty. If I try on a pair of medium Cherokee scrubs, the waist fits perfectly. However, my large lower body causes the scrubs to be incredibly tight and at danger of ripping. It's ridiculous, I look like Robert Plant or Mick Jagger in these scrubs. If I try on a Large of the same brand, the waist is enormous, the butt and legs fit perfectly, and the scrubs are way too long. It's frustrating.  In a nutshell, creating different fits of scrubs would be awesome (sort of like how clothing stores have skinny jeans, bootcut, relaxed, etc.) I haven't looked at your website yet, so I'm not sure if this is something y'all already do. All I know is that when I visit scrub stores, I can never find anything like this."

nursing,3diz7o,BOOOMstick,2,Fri Jul 17 01:19:43 2015 UTC,Durability.  I was the one who said in an earlier post that I want scrubs to turn a punch and be bite-proof.  The ripstop actually works pretty well for this.  I've had kids chomp at my legs and only got small bruises through that stuff.  It's nearly as protective as denim.
nursing,3diz7o,RnJibbajabba,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:08:48 2015 UTC,Got it. Thanks for the insight!

nursing,3diz7o,Tea-and-cupcakes,7,Fri Jul 17 04:07:25 2015 UTC,I have some scrub tops with horizontal pockets and it really bugs me when the contents come spilling out if I bend even the slightest bit forward. I probably shouldn't be keeping my phone in there but I do and it has smacked to the ground way too many times. I do have tops with a single kangaroo(?) pocket but it tends to get messy and saggy.
nursing,3diz7o,Kohkan3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:58:29 2015 UTC,Thanks! This is great. Do you mean kangaroo pocket like the pockets in hoodies? We have pockets in pockets for phones in our four-pocket top which may help.
nursing,3diz7o,DS_9,2,Thu Jul 16 20:08:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah like the hoodie pockets.

I think that it would be genius to make pants for women in different ""shapes""- ie curvy fit, modern fit, etc. like many jeans do. I find that scrub pants have huge variation between different brands and having different fit styles within the same brand would be awesome. Also having hem to let out on pants in case they are too short would be nice for tall people. Also I dream of having special single pen pockets within a larger pocket. I also like pockets on my butt that are ""interior""- only the opening shows."
nursing,3diz7o,schlingfo,2,Fri Jul 17 04:03:13 2015 UTC,Curvy fit pants would be great! I size up to avoid the about-to-split-these-pants feelings when squatting or bending then have to pull the drawstring super tight.

Oh, and the elastic in the waistband needs to be strong enough to hold up the pants when you fill up those pockets.  Believe it or not, I own a pair of scrub pants with a drawstring that is so stretchy that it will not hold the pants up, therefore making the pants unusable.  Ooh and my favorite thing is when pockets on scrub tops have little dividers/sections/etc to keep my pen, penlight, scissors, etc separated and organized.  edit: Just looked over your site and your scrubs seem to fit my requirements, which is awesome.  But I figured I'd throw in a little feedback about what I look for when buying scrubs online.  It makes all the difference when buying online to have a little diagram or very clear picture so I can see what the pockets look like and how they're organized (like this).  This function of the scrubs is my main priority and is difficult to discern from the stylized pictures on the website.  The scrubs look great and stylish, but are the pockets functional?"

nursing,3diz7o,GassiestMasochist,3,Thu Jul 16 21:03:03 2015 UTC,I am with the other female commenter. I am tall and have a bit of a belly. I am in between a large and a medium. I generally have to go large for the length and because they are a little tight in the thighs when I stretch and bend down. I love soft durable fabric when working those long hours. Pockets are a must. I like to have one pocket on my left leg at least. If you could scotch guard or make them water resistant that would be lovely too. Please make sure that the drawstring is easy to remove after being tied. Our hospital issue ones get stuck all the time and we have to try to pick them out or cut the string with scissors. Those are pretty much my loves and disagreements with scrubs.
nursing,3diz7o,Bunglau,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:22:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you! For the pocket in your left leg, do you like to store larger items like notebooks, or would it be more convenient to have compartments - like a slot for specific tools?"
nursing,3diz7o,fleuvage,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:44:31 2015 UTC,To be honest I have a OnePlus Phone so I store it in there so it is out of the way. Generally I put assignments or random pieces of scrap paper with results or anything else that will not need right away in that pocket. I also love scrub tops that have the two pockets at the bottom but a pen pocket near the breast where I put my pens.

Seriously, I like a tie/elastic ruching in the back to give me the semblance of a waist and patch pockets on the front. I also like inset side pockets on pants. It's enough to have the one back pocket, but side pockets are nice. Also a seam split (I don't know the actual term) on each side on the bottom hem for shirts and on the bottom outside hem for pants so you have more room when you bend over and stuff.

I also don't want my scrubs to rip if I'm restraining a patient.   Easy to clean. We work with bodily fluids all day long. I can't tell you how many pairs of scrubs I've ruined because of blood (this is also due to the stupid color we are forced to wear but the material also doesn't help).   Leave some room for my boobs. My tops are either way too big and I end up giving my patients and coworkers a show or the tops are too tight and I look like I'm trying to show off.   Grey's Anatomy have so far been the most comfortable - the material feels like pajamas. However, they don't have the pockets I need. The thighs wear out quickly. Wonderwink has an amazing selection of pockets but they fit very weird.   Pants - I cycle. I have large, muscular thighs. I need scrub pants that won't fall off of me yet can accommodate something other than twigs. I don't care about form fitting, I work in a gross hospital, I need something functional!

nursing,3djqg2,PossibilityZero,7,Thu Jul 16 20:47:43 2015 UTC,"I'm an LPN in Canada so I've never been in your particular situation, never had to nurse family or anything, but maybe my advice from long term care will be of some use.  For meds, trying again about 15 minutes later often works. If she's really resistant, crushing them and putting them in food like jam or pudding. Some meds can't be crushed though, so you'll have to do a little research on that. Things like long acting, slow release have special coatings. You might get away with hiding them whole in a spoonful of something thick.  For when they're confused, sometimes I go along with it. I have a cowboy resident who often tells me we need to pack up camp and go home and I'll usually tell him it's late and we should stay one more night and pack up tomorrow and he agrees and we're ok for the night.  Other times I ask questions about it, like what's the dogs name, what kind of dog, where's the apartment, how long has she lived there etc, it often distracts them, tell her we'll go later.   Or redirect to some activity or topic that's completely different and they might forget about it."
nursing,3djqg2,thumbprint11,5,Thu Jul 16 21:26:44 2015 UTC,"Good advice here.  3) If she is refusing  to take meds, just keep offering. Give it a few times. If it gets too late (some medications are more strict on frequency than others) just chalk it up to a refusal and try again tomorrow. If it happens a few days in a row, time to reevaluate. Maybe the med can be given at a differet time of day or a different form. Contact the doctor for this.   4) Rule of thumb with delusions/hallucination is, if they aren't distressed, go along with it. If she says ""there is a blue bunny in the corner,"" ask if it is a nice bunny, does it have a name, etc. If she is distressed by a delusion/hallucination, try to distract her.   When it comes to food and fluids, just keep offering/approaching her. If she eats ice cream all day and that is all she will eat, let her.  Just keep her safe. You asked great questions. She is in good hands with you. Being a caregiver is very hard work, even on the best days. If you feel frustrated, be sure to get help as much as you can."

nursing,3djqg2,zeatherz,4,Thu Jul 16 22:05:39 2015 UTC,"Other people have given good advice about getting her to take medications. For food and drink, make sure she's getting things she likes. If she's nearing end of life, and not diabetic, there's no reason to not just drink soda or chocolate milk or juice or whatever. With food, you can try disquising healthier food, like make smoothies with veggies and yogurt and peanut butter. If she really won't eat, try nutrition drinks like ensure.   Also make sure food and drink are always available. Keep snacks snd  drinks around where she can get to them without asking you.   The best thing is just go along with delusions if they are not scary or harmful. Assure her that mom will feed the dog, her husband is on his way home, the bus should be here any minute, dinner is already prepared, whatever it happens to be. Also redirect here with activities and distractions. Have herbfold a basket of laundry, give her a deck of cards, put on music or TV she likes, or whatever matches her personal interests.   Caregiver burnout is a very real and potentially dangerous thing. Please make sure you are taking care of yourself.  Look for caregiver support groups who will likely have advice and resources. If your family can afford, hire some relief care a few hours. Does she need full time supervision for her safety (like she's a fall risk or might wander away?). If its safe, feel free to go out sometimes and do whatever you enjoy. And try to look at activities or places you could take her, even just going for walks. Check if theres a senior center with activities she could go to.  Also, I know when you're 19 two months can feel like forever, but remember that this is temporary, and its a good deed you are doing. Try to remember that (most) elders deserve respect and to be treated with dignity and that you are helping to keep her out of a shitty nursing home."
nursing,3djqg2,outrunningzombies,3,Thu Jul 16 23:39:30 2015 UTC,"Everyone else has given great advice about meds--I would just add that you should learn which meds are super important and which aren't a huge issue if she misses a dose so you know when you really need to be pushing the issue (by offering multiple times for example).  Find out what she likes to drink. Does she like apple juice or diet soda or whatever. If she likes to drink it, she's far more likely to drink more of it. Even a few sips is better than nothing.  If she's thinking about old memories, I usually came up with reasons that it wouldn't work. Telling people it isn't 1940 won't get you far, but telling them that it's too late and their mother is watching the kids tonight so she can relax usually works better (unless Mom was an asshole alcoholic who wasn't trusted with the kids). She really believes whatever she's telling you and she's worried and frightened and it's ok to reassure her with something that makes her more comfortable.  Some advice you didn't ask for, but something that will make your future ER trips easier--type up a list of her doctors, medical problems, past surgeries and medications (including dosage and frequency) and print out several copies. Carry one with you. Put one on the fridge in a way that it's super obvious (this is for paramedics). Include a copy of any relevant healthcare paperwork, like a power of attorney or DNR, with each copy of the sheet. This will help the nurses/doctors take better care of her in the ER.  Is someone giving you breaks? This is a very hard job, especially when it's unexpected. There's going to be a grieving process for your old life and for your grandmother and that all has to happen while you're taking care of her. Even if it's just hiring someone to come watch her for a few hours in the afternoon a few times a week so you can go grocery shopping or drink a beer without worry about her. I'm willing to bet you can hire a nursing student for minimum wage who can handle most of these tasks to give you a break."

Basically understand that people with dementia are likely to go through phases, sometimes hours to days, where they are legitimately convinced that they are in a different time and place. You have to pick your battles on when to calmly explain reality as compared to when to just go along with it. It depends on how far along in her dementia she is.   One important thing to remember is that confusion is often a manifestation of infection and sickness in the elderly. If she starts acting much outside of her usual level of dementia, do not hesitate to have her evaluated by her doctor. Something as simple as an unknown UTI can cause a serious decline in her lucidity.   You are a good person for doing this. It is a hard job and most people aren't able to do it for long. Do not feel guilty for taking a break for yourself. You need it, even if you don't realize it."

Or will a move like this basically bar me from being employed there in the future?   Just MY opinion (tends to different from management.)  But I would LOVE if someone told me the reason they were switching jobs / taking time off is due to burn out.  I'm a very patient focused CNA and if I were burned out, then I couldn't give them the care I deserve.  I'd surely hope the facility could recognize that and would appreciate that I was willing to take the time off to recollect myself until I could get back into the job and give it my all again.    Nobody here can tell you how THAT facility would react (unless they work there).  But taking time off during burnout seems like a responsible patient focused decision.  I've worked with burnt out CNAs and nurses.  Frankly, they went from being absolutely fantastic to sucking at their jobs.

However, look closely at job advertisements and see what they require. Some hospitals only hire medics now as techs. Others prefer CNAs because they don't let techs do much (my current job doesn't let techs even test for pregnancies whereas I could splint, start IVs, draw blood, as a tech). Look around since usually there are different options such as quick adult learning programs that can meet once a day. Some programs are ridiculous and you can knock it out in less than 1 month. I think the shortest program I have heard of was like 2 weeks but a lot of states have increased clinicals. Paramedic was still more useful in my opinion but it is apples and oranges. Both medics and nurses are healthcare workers but you wouldn't substitute oranges for apples in apple pie. Their roles are different.   Around here, a lot of our techs are EMTs. I was hired in because of my volunteer fire experience initially and later became a paramedc. I worked as a paramedic then in an ER and it paid very well while giving me a chance to triage."

nursing,3dkwpv,Amymars,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:22:09 2015 UTC,I had my EMT prior and fire department paid for it. I did 8 hours on Saturdays while doing pre-nursing stuff for a total of 21 or 22 credit hours. We had clinicals but they are scheduled differently than nursing clinicals.   I was finishing my last month as a paramedic student and first semester nursing student and managed to get my state cert in the final weeks of working as an ER tech before switching to unit clerk/paramedic at a different hospital. Technically my job was unit clerk but I worked more hours as a paramedic. I was guaranteed a spot as a unit clerk but they usually had the patient care tech unit clerk for me instead so I could triage.   My first job as an ER tech filtered out CNAs and went for EMTs and medical assistants. The other job used CNAs for patient care techs but put an emphasis on nursing students. My first job as an ER nurse hired only paramedics.   Unit clerk may be a better job to consider too. You are usually tied to a desk but they will usually cross train you as a nursing assistant or patient care tech. I wouldn't settle for just ER though. People transfer all the time into the ER too. Getting in system is a lot more helpful.

In general office nurses make less than nurses in the hospital. I have friends that work in various offices and make anywhere from $14-$20/hr, while the going rate at hospitals in my area is $25-$30. Being an office nurse involves a lot of paper work, phone triage, assisting in minor out patient procedures (mostly getting supplies and assisting the doc in getting set up), maybe some vitals/medical history/collecting specimens if they have you doing MA duties as well, calling in prescriptions, answering patient questions over the phone, etc. I have never worked in an office setting, but I did a few different clinical experience in different offices and I found it sort of mundane. But who knows, it might be interesting to you! You could always call around and see if you could shadow a nurse in a derm office to see if you like it.  If you can't find a derm job right away, try finding a job in a clinic or another type of doctors office (family practice, specialty, anything really) to get something relevant on your resume.

Since the school is primary care, I am not sure if I can use an ER physician or NP at all even though that will help with getting some clinical time and skills out of the way (lots of sewing and pelvics).   A good chunk of them are in the same land program and one or two are in the online program due to the land program actually being cheaper. I prefer to do online though.   I think one bonus is that I am licensed in two states.

In ICU we had a problem b/c this is not what grand-father wanted but condition is very treatable so we kept him on vent for mean time. so plost form does not guarantee that your wishes are respected.
nursing,3dgrzh,Lubuntu1410,0,Thu Jul 16 13:45:40 2015 UTC,At least you'll get to see how Game of Thrones turns out. (But you should really talk to your nurse or someone about your feelings though.)

The only ""app"" or tool I ever used was my cell phone calendar. I put all my plans in there and built my schedule around it.   The only real advice I can offer is try to do as little flipping of schedule as you can, get all your nights done first then do all your days. Then on the the next schedule do all your days first and then all your nights. That's what I would try for at least."

nursing,3digc7,epivaso,2,Thu Jul 16 15:38:04 2015 UTC,Biggest tip I have for people who are new to self scheduling is to print / look at the whole 2 month period AND the week BEFORE.  Some people forget that they signed up to work 3 in a row at the end of their previous schedule and then will sign up for a bunch in a row again. It's easy to do if you don't look at the big picture.
nursing,3digc7,yochana8,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:44:03 2015 UTC,"That's awesome advice, thank you!"
nursing,3digc7,yochana8,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:31:08 2015 UTC,"Wait, so if you're doing 4 weekends and you get 8 days off in 2 months, thats your other 4 weekends right there. So maybe i'm confused, but does that mean you're working 12 hour shifts for basically 2 weeks in a row w/o any days off, then 2 days, and then another 2 weeks of 12s? That sounds...excessive. Am I wrong?"
nursing,3digc7,outrunningzombies,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:32:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I certainly get more days off than that! Huge part of the reason I became a nurse! I meant to say we get 8 ""no work days"" per period that we use to indicate days we absolutely can't (or won't) work, so that as things get shuffled around according to need/etc..., they keep those ones free for us.   Our normal days off don't have that same protection and are subject to being shuffled slightly to meet needs. At least that's my current understanding of it. Still on orientation so I haven't gotten the chance to actually do it yet. Does that make sense?"
nursing,3digc7,Amymars,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:02:19 2015 UTC,Ok good! I'm in nursing school and for a moment was like oh god what did I get myself into???

nursing,3dkw0k,miseri6325,11,Fri Jul 17 02:28:59 2015 UTC,If I was having chest pain and arm numbness I'd take my SO's nitro.
nursing,3dkw0k,PutYouToSleep,3,Fri Jul 17 02:39:51 2015 UTC,And then take the time to call your home health agency or go to the ED?
nursing,3dkw0k,auraseer,5,Fri Jul 17 03:04:15 2015 UTC,"If I weren't clinically educated, I'd probably follow the instructions on the bottle.  Her husband's prescription may say to take a tab q5m x3, and then call EMS if the pain does not resolve, so that's what she did. The pain resolved and therefore she didn't call EMS. But some other new sensation started, as an apparent side effect of nitro, so she called you.  That's not terribly surprising or remarkable behavior from a layperson who doesn't know there is a difference between stable and unstable angina."
nursing,3dkw0k,Generoh,-2,Fri Jul 17 05:21:05 2015 UTC,"I guess I can see that. But everyone and their brother knows that you should not take another person's medications. Especially if you don't have a history of the problem that the medication is indicated for... If she had a cardiac history of some sort and was out of nitro, okay no problem. But no documented history with sudden onset of symptoms? Why even mess with that?"

nursing,3dixxn,PutYouToSleep,2,Thu Jul 16 17:31:40 2015 UTC,"A nurse should always seek to know why a physician is doing what they're doing and to be able to anticipate what the physician is going to order.  These books can help you understand the medical aspect of your nursing interventions.  Aside from that it does help quite a bit, the Pocket ICU includes explanations of vent setting and ABG results, it has typical drug dosages, it has your vasoactive drugs in comparison charts. Lots of good information."

nursing,3dixxn,medicalscrubsco,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:55:41 2015 UTC,I wholeheartedly agree with this. It's hard to advocate for your patient if you have no idea what to expect and are just troubleshooting issues before they start. Once you get oriented to the floor you'll find time and brainpower to really start noticing these things.  Also think about when your patient is ready to leave (either downgraded from ICU or discharge home/snf) both to mentally prepare the patient to leave and to advocate against longer than needed stays.
nursing,3dixxn,Kurerabear,2,Thu Jul 16 18:28:31 2015 UTC,"Hey Nhiyoka, Congratulations on your graduation! Disclaimer: I represent a medical scrubs retailer.  The gold standard for women's scrubs are Grey's Anatomy scrubs. They have an awesome fit, silky smooth fabric, and are extremely durable. Another favorite of many is Iguanamed scrubs - they use a patented fabric process that's a bit active-inspired and is really cool! Another awesome new line that just hit the market is Code Happy scrubs - these babies are antimicrobial! Some other nice things are:  good quality Littman stethoscope, cute badge reel or lanyard, good bag to hold all the odds and ends when you go to and from work. Good luck!"
nursing,3dixxn,Kurerabear,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:48:50 2015 UTC,"First off, congrats on graduating! Yay!  The gear you need is more or less dependant on what floor you'll be working on and what kind of person you are. Some nurses love having everything in their pockets whole others carry the bare minimum. I've opted to have some stuff with me and the rest in a small pencil box (spacemaker from way back when).   Just a heads up too on your scissors/stethoscope/pens/markers, you're going to lose them - a label may help for a while but everything  inevitably gets lost. Not sure if your hospital uses it but a dry-erase marker is handy too for white boards.   Good luck!"

The family appreciates any and all gestures of kindness, which isn't always the case with patients who are on their way to recovery. Last week I offered for a wife to lie down next to her dying husband. Her face lit up, and I'm sure she thought she'd never be able to do that again. Our hospice RN saw, and actually asked me ""So when are you coming to hospice?""  Death is special. I consider it an honor to be there."

One time indian tribes man was on max epi, levo, 1.0 of vaso and still had pressure of 80-90. SaO2 was 90% on max-ed out vent setting with FiO2 of 100%. During shift change doing bedside report, I mention that if you want to, we can get him off all the medication and take mask off so that he can let nature take its course.  DTR of family thanked me for talking about it because she didn't know.

My job involves a lot of sitting around on night shift, so i bring snacks and music (with earbuds) to help me stay awake.    Getting up and walking around helps.  So do micronaps/meditating.    Make sure you have somewhere dark to sleep during the day.   You will also probably be a bit loopy by the end of it.  Sleep deprivation means everything is hilarious.  To you.

nursing,3dg06f,steph_a_s,5,Thu Jul 16 02:38:37 2015 UTC,"Buy black out curtains or line your windows with foil. Put your phone on do not disturb while you're sleeping. Hang a sign on your door asking people not to ring the door bell. Sleep when you can, and take a melatonin if you need help. Working straight nights isn't as bad as rotating shifts, which just always sucks."
nursing,3dg06f,jareths_tight_pants,3,Thu Jul 16 03:22:30 2015 UTC,This is ideal. Others take what they can (blackout curtains or shades being important) and sleep whenever they can. Two nights in a row is not bad but it is very important to sleep after the first shift. Some find a heavy meal after the first night useful.

nursing,3dg06f,catsladder,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:48:41 2015 UTC,"So are you going from 1630 to 2200 that night ? Or a day between. Regardless try to sleep as much as you can before your first shift. Caffeine to keep you awake while you fight the natural sleep cycle of most mankind before you. Then when you get home try not to immediately fall asleep. Stay awake from 0730 when you get off until 1100 to 1300. Then you'll still get 8 hr unfragmented sleep.  By 11 or noon on your first day you won't need black out curtains, benedryl, melatonin, earplugs or anything!   So many of my coworkers fragment their sleep with a nap after work and a nap before work, justifying it that they have their day to do errands, but wonder why they're tired.   TLDR Try the stay up late after work, get solid 8 hr before work routine."

I have friends that had same situations in CCU, PCU, etc. My facility will pay for my bachelors after a set period of time working there.  As far as medical billing, I can't say one way or another. I know that after 2 semesters in an associates degree program most facilities will let you work as a CNA. Feel free to PM me with more questions!

Then, when he was about to start the procedure he asked me to back up a bit. So I did... into the sterile field. My realization of what I had backed into made me jump, and I KNOCKED IT OVER.

I know a lot of people think that it's pointless to visit someone who doesn't remember their family members anymore much less their own reflection in the mirror, but I've always told family members, please keep visiting.  They need that comfort and even if they can't remember exactly who you are, they know you are someone who cares about them, and that matters so much.

It's great experience to have on your resume, and probably a pretty good opportunity that they're willing to hire you without previous experience. That, and even just the thought of working med-surg makes my soul hurt. That's personal preference though. Good luck! :)"
nursing,3da6va,brbru,5,Tue Jul 14 19:50:14 2015 UTC,"If your main goal is to get your foot in the door for a nursing job, consider where it's best to work as a nurse. Tech work sucks. It sucks on the floors and on the units. It's excellent experience and I'm glad I did it, but thank God that's over. You'll be overworked, underpaid, and utterly unappreciated. But anyway.  I was in the very fortunate position of choosing between a med-surg floor and the ICU for my first nursing job this spring. I had worked as a tech on a med-surg floor, and for various reasons, I decided ICU was a better fit for me. I'm still on orientation, but so far, I'm really happy with the decision I made.  One of my main reasons was patient ratios. I just don't think I could provide safe, effective care to 7 patients at once. I have no idea how y'all do it up there, but it seems overwhelming. I like having two patients, two sets of meds, two assessments to chart, two sets of orders to keep up with. I was constantly physically exhausted as a tech up there-- so much running up and down the hall! Now I have both my patients in my line of sight. I'm 20 feet from the med room and 50 feet from the main supply room. When I need something fast, I can get it fast. When I forget something (which is often; I'm new) it isn't a huge deal to backtrack for it. I really feel like I've been able to develop a rapport with families of patients, and I'm tremendously honored to be able to spend a little extra time explaining what's going on, because I know firsthand how terrifying it is to see a loved one stuck full of tubes and sedated.  The downsides: Your patients really are very sick, for the most part. It can be challenging to stay on top of their needs, and they can deteriorate alarmingly quickly. Of course, this was one of the reasons I wanted to work in critical care; I thought I wanted things to be exciting. I was wrong. Exciting is bad. Very bad.  Sometimes we get people who really don't need an ICU bed, but the rest of the hospital is at capacity and we can't just leave them hanging around the ED all night. It's frustrating to take floor-status patients when you know someone could come in who really needs this level of care.  And this is petty, but fair warning: At my facility, nurses are expected to stay on the unit through breaks. We don't get to leave for 30 minutes and stick someone else with our patients. We get our food, sit in the break room where we can still see our patients and their monitors though the window, and try to eat. If a call light goes off or an alarm starts beeping, you still have to hop up and deal with it (sometimes with a mouthful of pasta). I don't think it's a written rule, but it is an obvious expectation.  Some old-school nurses will try to tell you that you NEED a year's experience on a med-surg floor. More recently, this has been changing. If you don't want to work med-surg, forcing yourself to stay there for a year is just going to burn you out. Lately I've been hearing a lot more people encourage new nurses to pursue the specialty they want. So far, I'm glad I did."

nursing,3d9d6v,lethal_weapon_five,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:12:51 2015 UTC,"The purpose of the filter is to filter. TPN may contain precipitated insoluble particles, and those have to be removed before infusion.  If the ""air bubble"" got larger when you drew suction, it probably wasn't an air leak. The air was probably just expanding as you decreased the pressure. When you released the plunger, did the bubble return to its previous size?"
nursing,3d9d6v,auraseer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:46:05 2015 UTC,TPN can contain particulates and large molecules and the filter makes sure that none of those get into the patient.

Sure, a few alcohol swabs and a few flushes, maybe a roll of tape ... But anything more than that strikes me as unnecessary. Are you really so busy that you can't plan a trip to the supply room?  Anything I take out of clean storage and take into patient care areas (including a fannypack/pockets) seems dirty. Fishing around in a fanny pack with clean hands (but dirty fanny pack??) is kinda gross. On my unit, once we take an iv start kit (or other supplies) out of clean storage into a pt's room we are not supposed to put it back as it has been potentially contaminated. In attempts to declutter sometimes we cavi wipe supplies and return them to storage but most things get thrown out. This seems incredibly wasteful.  In order to not waste supplies I try to carry minimum amount of stuff with me, use what excess others have brought to the bedside. I can see using a fanny pack if I'm floating, maayyyyyybbeee in ER, or critical care outreach but just random supplies on my person seems silly."
nursing,3d900i,wouldNapoleon,2,Tue Jul 14 15:10:19 2015 UTC,"If you can predict what you're definitely going to need, it makes sense to carry it around. When I worked inpatient, I'd always stock my pockets with a certain number of saline flushes, alcohol swabs, IV end caps, 2x2s, and so forth, because I needed them all the time. That one trip at the start of the night would save me at least a half-dozen trips before lunchtime.   After moving to the ED, I don't carry nearly as much stuff routinely, because I can't as easily predict what I'll use."

So rather than using the locked drawer in the room, there's actually a designated wire shelf on wheels (with brakes!) with drawers to assist with organisation.   It mightn't be logistically possible where you are but worth a trial, perhaps?"

nursing,3d89gn,morriganlefeye,4,Tue Jul 14 07:40:39 2015 UTC,"All my bosses care about are nursing certifications such as ACLS, TNCC, CCRN, Etc. If you are going to invest in Things that will make you more marketable, aim for that. Or obviously your bsn.   My thoughts on the other stuff that you mentioned are that they are worthless as far as nurse hiring is concerned. As a nurse, phlebotomy is already in your expected practice. You won't be taking X-rays or ultrasounds, and you will only mix your own meds in critical care nursing.   So IMO, there are avenues of education that you can pursue, but not the ones that you are mentioning.   Oh. Side note. If you are interested in ER, a non nursing credentialing that you might look into is EMT basic. ER managers love seeing that on a resume."

nursing,3d89gn,CalvinsStuffedTiger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:27:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think they will help tbh.  Most hospitals nowadays will throw a non-bsn resume in the trash.  UNLESS that person works in the hospital already.   My advice would be to spend the time you would otherwise have doing these certifications volunteering at a hospital you want to work in.   Or working part time as a unit sec or mopping the floors, or whatever it takes to get your foot in the door.    Definitely spend as much of your time as possible getting that BSN though, first and foremost.   Hope that helps."
nursing,3d89gn,RnJibbajabba,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:10:29 2015 UTC,"Tbh I don't feel confident in what I was taught when it comes to phlebotomy and EKG in my ASN program. I'm not saying that I learned nothing and that I can't function as a nurse, it's just that we had no experience starting IVs and only had about 3 weeks during critical care on EKG.   How can I pursue CCRN cert if I'm not working in the hospital?"
nursing,3d89gn,dandelion_k,2,Tue Jul 14 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"CCRN was a poor example on my part. You need critical care bedside experience for that one. There are other certifications that do not. Google ""rn certifications"" and see if you would be interested in any of those. There are dozens and dozens to choose from.   You may or may not be in a position to look around but IMO, almost any hospital setting will get you more experience than LTC or SNF.  There ARE hospital jobs for new grads out there but you may need to move to a different part of the country. If you are young and single, then there is no better time to strike out and grow legs!!! I can tell you for sure that there are hospitals all over Louisiana hiring new grads with ASN/ADN and they are doing it with smiles on their faces!"
nursing,3d89gn,crumblypeeps,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:17:13 2015 UTC,"No one gets great phlebotomy teaching in class. Most of us get it on the job. People will be understanding of that when it comes to hiring you as a new nurse. The best certifications are the ones that come from experience as a nurse. Even though some, like a TNCC, can be gained without direct experience, it doesn't count for much if you've never actually experienced taking care of trauma patients.   Just breathe. Employers understand that new grads need training in these areas. It's why a majority have nurse residency programs for new grads, and long orientations. You aren't expected to hit the floor running your first week."
nursing,3d89gn,massmanx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:37:58 2015 UTC,"Work on getting your BSN and try to get certified in something over the year you are working in LTC. Geriatrics would be a good one, as would palliative care or something or just become a board certified RN (RN-BC). These are more likely to show an employer your dedication to the profession of nursing (vs. just skills, like ekgs, which they will teach you for free in acute care)."

nursing,3d9iyc,dogfins25,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:04:30 2015 UTC,"I started 14 days ago in a LTC setting (I suppose it means long term care?) and even though I have a lot of experience from LTC geriatrics I do make mistakes. Mistakes I almost wouldn't make at my last LTC nursing home. Those mistakes aren't so much about my lack of skills or ability to see, but rather me being new to the nursing home. You have to remember that the other nurses know a lot about the residents background history, relatives, individual needs that you only learn by getting a trust after knowing a resident/relative for some time.  There is also the stupid routines most workplaces have, which you have to learn to ""fit in"". Routines that can be unrelated to what's important to your work and knowledge as a nurse. For some reason, these routines get highlighted as a the most important thing to get done on a shift. A typical example is the ""we do this here, we have always done it like this"". Worst thing I like hearing... What I'm trying to say is that there are a lot of things that interfere with you as a nurse in a new working place, and that makes you do mistakes or messing up. Give it time and keep it up!"

nursing,3d6ndw,cacksman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:00:05 2015 UTC,"There are accelerated MSNs that are just as quick as most accelerated BSNs.   And just because you are getting a CNL, doesn't mean you will try to be hired as one directly out of school with no nursing experience (which is what most of the advice you're getting is based off). You'll be hired as a new nurse. The benefits: higher chance of getting hired over any entry level BSN student, and you already have a Master's so they'll hire you with leadership potential in mind.   Entry level MSN programs are fairly new, and many people don't even know they exist. I think this is why there is some push back when bringing it up. I see no reason whatsoever why someone would consciously choose an BSN over an MSN, all other things (cost, duration, etc) being equal."
nursing,3d6ndw,auraseer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:01:10 2015 UTC,"For many MSN programs, a BSN will take just as long, and in some cases longer. I'm in an accelerated MSN program now and there are many BSN programs that I researched that were actually longer than mine.   In that case, why on earth would someone want to get a BSN when they could get an MSN and have a higher chance at being hired?"
nursing,3d6ndw,cacksman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:58:33 2015 UTC,"An MSN doesn't make you any more attractive for a bedside nursing job than a BSN does. When you're a new grad with no experience and an MSN, you are still a new grad with no experience. (A few managers even actively attempt not to hire anyone with too many degrees, believing they're more likely to move on from the job sooner, though personally I don't go that far.)  All else being equal, an MSN takes longer and costs more than a BSN. You could surely force the balance to tip the other way if you wanted, by choosing to compare longer BSN programs from more expensive universities, but that's not a fair comparison."
nursing,3d6ndw,auraseer,-2,Tue Jul 14 23:18:04 2015 UTC,"When applying to jobs of Magnet status hospitals, an MSN absolutely gives you a bump over a BSN applicant with the same experience.  I would be very surprised if you've done more research than me on the subject of duration of MSN vs. BSN programs. I've found many entry MSN programs to be less than 20 months in duration, some as short as 15 months. There may be a few BSN programs shorter than, but even if you find them, we're talking maybe one semester for a complete step up in degrees."
nursing,3d6ndw,cacksman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:58:05 2015 UTC,"I did a 12-month ABSN. There are a few others within easy driving distance of where I sit. They're not all that uncommon. If you aren't aware of such things, clearly you haven't done as much research as you think."

nursing,3d6ndw,cacksman,2,Thu Jul 16 09:35:36 2015 UTC,Interesting I haven't seen CNL as a separate role. I see job opening all the time that specify a BSN or MSN with non-nursing BS/BA.

nursing,3d6ndw,cacksman,2,Tue Jul 14 03:38:43 2015 UTC,But why spend the extra time and money to get the exact same job?
nursing,3d6ndw,cacksman,-1,Tue Jul 14 23:02:47 2015 UTC,"Apparently this pre-nursing student has it all figured out   I graduate from my AMSN in December. So let me get this straight, you are suggesting that the OP go get their BSN, so they can later on have their employer maybe pay for them to go back to school for their MSN at a later date? That makes absolutely no sense. Like I said in another comment, I've done a lot of research on MSN vs. BSN and you can find plenty of MSN programs under 20 months and very much in-line with BSN cost-wise. The MSN programs that cost $80k and last 3 years are definitely not the norm. How much research have you done on the subject?  And if the OP decides they need to take out loans? If they accumulated any decent amount of loans for their undergrad, all the more reason to go MSN, since the federal loan limit caps out at a total of $50k for BSN, and it goes up to $100k for a master's."
nursing,3d6ndw,cacksman,-1,Wed Jul 15 01:53:02 2015 UTC,"So what exactly is the point you are trying to make? Are you saying you shouldn't be able to get an MSN in under 20 months? Because that's not the point.   The reality is that you can, and all things relatively equal (which may not be the case for everyone), one would be a fool to consciously pass up an MSN for a lesser degree."
nursing,3d6ndw,cacksman,-1,Wed Jul 15 02:57:41 2015 UTC,"I've yet to hear or read a valid argument otherwise. The problem is that most people don't even know entry level MSN programs exist, or they take advice they receive from others (who don't know the facts) without actually doing the research for themselves."
nursing,3d6ndw,Amymars,-1,Wed Jul 15 12:30:17 2015 UTC,"Extra time and money is debatable, but:   Better chance at getting said job.  Better chance at getting promotion(s).   In the end, all you're taking is extra leadership courses, usually required to maintain a higher gpa in school,  maybe an extra semester of schooling and you already have a Master's for if and when you want to advance your career."
nursing,3d6ndw,cacksman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:26:19 2015 UTC,Downside is what if you want to go back for a MSN in a different speciality? You may not be eligible for financial aid for a 2nd MSN and post graduate certificates aren't eligible for CCNE accreditation and financial aid.
nursing,3d6ndw,usedtobecool84,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"There should be absolutely nothing barring someone with an entry level MSN from going back to school and getting an AP-MSN if they should choose. As far as aid- my understanding is you are eligible to receive federal financial aid up to a certain limit, which is 54k for a BSN, and over 100k for an MSN.   Which quite possibly is another argument in favor of MSN over BSN. If the OP had any decent amount of loans from undergrad, it's likely they would cap out going for a BSN. That was exactly what would have happened to me."
nursing,3d6ndw,Amymars,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:59:37 2015 UTC,"My school offered both a 2nd-degree BSN and CNL MSN option. Here are the pros/cons for each:   The CNL 2 year program is the same length as the BSN program (you go through the summers with CNL but not BSN at my school). So you can get a MSN in the same amount of time, but you can't really gain experience by working over the summer as a nurse extern/CNA.  CNL program has graduate tuition rates, and BSN has undergrad rates. The CNL courses are a little over twice as much per credit hour as the BSN courses. BSN tuition is also capped at 12 credit hours per semester. Also, you have to pay for summer terms with the CNL program, so it's overall WAY more expensive. If you are interested in getting your DNP, the CNL program covers a year of classes (according to my school), so you can get your DNP in three years, not four. However, that assumes you want to get your DNP at the same school you did your CNL ~ I wouldn't count on everything transferring if you go somewhere else. Many of the CNL classes are basically the same as the BSN classes (seriously, some of the syllabi are used in both with the extra CNL requirements noted at the bottom), just with more/longer papers or more references needed per paper/care plan. Basically, some extra busy-work, which I think there's enough of in the BSN program already. I spoke with a couple people who did the MSN. They don't regret it, but they felt that they were not in that much better shape in getting jobs as BSNs. They're in the same new-grad jobs that BSN's are, and they don't get extra $$$ for the masters. However, I have heard the MSN is really nice to have behind your name if you want to get promoted to management.   Obviously, not all of these points may apply to the programs your looking at, but hopefully it gives you somewhere to start in researching to make your decision.  Ultimately, I chose the BSN program because of cost. I'll pay graduate tuition rates when I know exactly what I want from grad school and hopefully have some tuition assistance from my work as well.  Also, being able to work summers is nice too, though I would have preferred to do an accelerated BSN and be done with school more quickly (accelerated programs in my area were as much or more as the CNL would be though, so financially, this program made the most sense). I'm hoping that the actual hospital experience I'm getting over the summer though will be as helpful, if not more helpful, than the higher degree in getting that first job. We'll see.  Tl;dr: BSN = $$; CNL = $$$$"
nursing,3d6ndw,usedtobecool84,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:26:11 2015 UTC,Except she wants to use the BSN for direct entry. She probably won't find a CNL position as a new grad with no nursing experience even if hospitals have a role specific to that and not more generalized positions. Downside is if she decides to go back for a different MSN specialization.
nursing,3d6ndw,naranja_sanguina,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:17:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's basically what I was saying - the people I know who graduated with CNL's got the same new grad positions when they graduated school that the new BSNs did."

Here's a nifty chart.  edited again: huh, according to this piece at American Nurse Today, it seems like the CNSes I know are really acting more like CNLs in their work at the hospital. Seems pretty fuzzy.  edited yet again: oh, I didn't realize a CNL is not an advanced practice nurse. OK! I'll shut up now!"
nursing,3d6ndw,Tucc34,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:11:23 2015 UTC,My hospitals will hire MSN direct entry as regular bedside nurses but you won't find yourself in leadership or management roles without experience most of the time.   I'd go whichever route is cheaper. You may not be eligible for financial aid unless you do the masters.
nursing,3d6ndw,DanKC,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:15:14 2015 UTC,"I graduated from a MSN/CNL program four years ago. I would def recommend getting a masters over a BSN if you have the money. My program was only  16 months but def more costly then a BSN program. When you graduate, you still have to take the CNL exam to become a certified CNL. Unfortunately, I do not think a lot of hospitals are utilizing this role and the exam is expensive. I have not taken it myself bc I have a other certs that are more pertinent to my area in the ICU and my employer only increases pay for so many certifications. Many of my class mates also have similar feelings and have not taken the CNL exam. Some have and no one that I know of except one person out of around 300 people are actually working as a CNL. Many of us received our degree to work at the bedside to gain experience before working on career advancement rather it be the leadership ladder or additional schooling.   There a lot of benefits to the MSN programs. No doubt you will have to get experience and will have to go through the new grad experience like every one else. However, having your masters allows you the opportunity to advance quickly and do other things such as leadership roles and being a professor. Also, if you are looking at doing something competitive like CRNA school, already having your masters is very well received... this speaking from personal experience. I would encourage the MSN route. Some programs are better then others but any program is only as good as the effort you put in. Good luck."

Not all colleges and universities will hire a DNP as a professor, but many only want a doctorate and don't care what variety it is.

nursing,3d617o,justatouchcrazy,3,Mon Jul 13 20:44:39 2015 UTC,"Definitely true.  However, one thing to think about is where the DNP could get you.  You can do a DNP in one year for a reasonable cost, and if you can use it to get into a permanent teaching position, even at a lower tier but still reputable school that does a few things for you.  First, it would likely be possible to teach while doing your PhD, especially if that school offers a PhD.  Sure, it might be a little rough and could add some time, but likely easier financially than not working and easier on your schedule than having a clinical position.  Also some of the DNP credits will likely transfer towards some of the early PhD courses, depending on the programs.  Also, when you graduate you'd have a PhD and several years of teaching experience, plus likely a publication or 10.  That would make you a much stronger candidate for a top tier university job, or a smaller school dean/program director position, if that's something you were interested in.  If you know for sure you want a PhD and have the ability to do it right away it probably makes sense to do it from the get go.  But I think the DNP option is probably the best indecisive decision because it strengths both a teaching and clinical resume.  Plus you might be able to find a program that would allow you to mix both DNP and a post-graduate FNP coursework into one semi-coherent schedule so you can accomplish several things at once."

nursing,3d35ew,EMERYIVY,5,Mon Jul 13 03:43:59 2015 UTC,"I was a caregiver before I was a nurse and it taught me to trust my gut, be creative, work without resources, and it taught me to respect more than I ever knew how. I did not ever ever do the same job as a nurse as a caregiver. I 'passed meds' that were pre-prepared into weekly boxes by nurses and that's it. Sure, it's not hospital experience but it's all what you take from it and how you spin it.   Walking into a hospital was a whole other world, I wouldn't trade my time as a caregiver for anything but being a CNA instead if you can be would likely be more beneficial to you in terms of seeing what nurses do and making connections."
nursing,3d35ew,NurseRattchet,3,Mon Jul 13 04:55:31 2015 UTC,"not as good as a CNA. You don't learn the skills, time management and whatnot from caregiving that you do as a CNA."
nursing,3d35ew,yeyman,2,Mon Jul 13 04:25:21 2015 UTC,"I'm currently a student like you and I work as a caregiver. The hours are very flexible if you work for a company- which is amazing, and certainly better than nothing if the long CNA shifts don't work with your schedule.   However the job is 100% different. You don't learn time management, you don't work with and have to deal with multiple patients at once, you don't have to work with a lot of equipment or medicine.   However, if you're looking to make real long lasting relationship, focus your time, energy, and creativity on one person, while having more flexible hours, being a caregiver is wonderful. To be honest, the skill level is remedial. I get stupider doing this job. But it's decent money, flexible, and appeals to my desire to connect with my patients, so it's a great options for me for now.   As far as your resume, a CNA job would look better, but even a caregiver job is better than say, the nursing student that's employed at Starbucks."
nursing,3d35ew,Hellooooooo_NURSE,2,Mon Jul 13 08:26:47 2015 UTC,Will it be worth it? Potentially but not as good as CNA work.   Same as nursing? No
nursing,3d35ew,GlossyGrace,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:00:03 2015 UTC,"If you love being a caregiver, you might make a good nurse, but it could also be a trap. You won't have time to lavish on beloved patients. If you have the talent for time management, you'll survive, and your patients will be lucky to have you. If not, you may have trouble finding a niche."
nursing,3d35ew,Uncle_Charnia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:09:14 2015 UTC,Become a CNA and work as a CNA.  You'll learn a lot and gain valuable experience.

nursing,3d4avo,girl1984,4,Mon Jul 13 20:24:57 2015 UTC,"Mynameismaryjo has a great point, but here's another caveat, PCT/CNA's are a dime a dozen, give em 2 weeks notice....you are replaceable.    Don't feel bad about leaving a job for a huge career boost such as nursing school."
nursing,3d4avo,usfdude223,5,Mon Jul 13 20:22:10 2015 UTC,I graduated nursing school with zero pct experience and did fine. School should be your #1 priority.
nursing,3d4avo,elac,2,Mon Jul 13 15:03:54 2015 UTC,"have you tried talking to your boss? perhaps they can put you on fridays and saturdays or whenever it won't interfere with your school schedule. or even drop to part time if you're FT, or per diem if you're already part time."
nursing,3d4avo,mynameismaryjo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:35:51 2015 UTC,"I haven't yet. Mostly because I know she'll be extremely disappointed, but I definitely will talk to her to see if we can work something out. It's a part time position but I don't think switching to a PRN position is possible because they've just hired some PRN PCTs. If I was just working, then this wouldn't even be an issue, but the fact that I have to juggle opposite sleep patterns is what's so difficult for me."
nursing,3d4avo,Yallah_Habibi,5,Mon Jul 13 12:41:09 2015 UTC,Maybe theres a PRN PCT that wants a part time position and you can switch with them.
nursing,3d4avo,rninnj,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:42:08 2015 UTC,"Also try to adapt your schedule for the time being. Study at night, sleep late. Take later classes during the semester. How many overnights do you do a week?"
nursing,3d47mi,Goose921,10,Mon Jul 13 11:41:03 2015 UTC,"You can make it as ""sciency"" as you want, but a lot of it will depend on yourself unfortunately. Nursing school has a tendency of just telling students how things are vs why they are down to the molecular level - this is mainly due to the fact they have to cover so much in so little time. I always say you have to remember every type of nurse can come out of the same nursing program - your skills and knowledge are dependent on A) Your drive to teach yourself and B) where you choose to work. This is why I love anesthesia - purely clinical physiology and pharmacology."
nursing,3d47mi,FrauKoko,6,Mon Jul 13 12:36:50 2015 UTC,"Or you can look into going to PA school. It's a bit more science based than nursing and NP school. CRNA has a lot of science too.   I did a bs and ms in biology before going to nursing school. Now, I'm in my final year of NP school. There are times I miss science and research (did that for 8 years prior to going to nursing school). But it was a way better fit for me to be in nursing. Looking back I should have considered PA school, which for whatever reason wasn't on my radar. I don't regret my path but I should have looked into it."
nursing,3d47mi,ancientgalaxies,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:04:09 2015 UTC,Would you recommend getting a undergrad degree in biology and then going to PA school or getting a BSN?
nursing,3d47mi,FrauKoko,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:10:41 2015 UTC,"That really depends on the person and what their goals are and what roles interest them. A good friend of mine was a nurse and now is a PA. She wanted the PA style of education vs the NP. There are pros and cons to either path. But both wonderful career options.   For me, nursing and healthcare positions were never on my radar during my bio days. I went into biology fully expecting to go into academia or some kind of research lab. I left for many reasons. So coming in as a second career, my path is different than someone who has the chance to start from scratch.    I suggest shadowing various types of positions and see what might seem like a good path for you. Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions!"
nursing,3d47mi,ancientgalaxies,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:38:32 2015 UTC,Alright thanks for the info! I'm 18 and currently attending a community college because I don't exactly know what I want to do with my life. I spent last year studying computer science and it turns out I hate programming and now im not sure what I want.   My mom is a nurse and is telling me I should become a PA. I've been looking into it and it seems like something I would be interested in. The reason I think getting a BSN would be a good idea is so I can have healthcare experience before PA school and also in case I don't get into any PA school Ill have a back up career. What do you think of this? Although I am interested in biology and would also like the path of majoring in bio but im not sure how I would get healthcare experience. Any advice is greatly appreciated!
nursing,3d47mi,FrauKoko,2,Tue Jul 14 05:50:46 2015 UTC,"IMO, that's not a bad plan. Some will disagree with me. But just don't tell anyone that's your plan. Nurses can get touchy about that stuff. Especially admissions people.   If you're interested in being a provider, I'd really try and see if you can shadow both an NP and a PA. Their roles have many similarities. The route and education is different.   One benefit of going through nursing/NP route, is once you're done you can take a break from school and work in a decent career. Pay back some loans. Save up some cash and go back to school. There are many affordable state schools out there once you're ready for NP school and some hospitals will give you some money to go back to school. So it tends to be a bit longer to your ultimate goal, but it's rewarding nonetheless.    The PA route is a bit more direct but can be more costly. But you're going to come out of the gate making a bit more. Doing a biology or nursing as your base degree is up to you. You can still get your required hours by working as a nurses aid/tech etc while working on either your biology or nursing degree.   However, if you get a biology degree there isn't much of a fall back career. Jobs in science are quite tough and very competitive.  So working as a nurses aid while getting your bio degree isn't going to be super helpful in landing you a research job.   What kind of nursing does your mum do? Is she steering you away from nursing? Have you had the opportunity to shadow various types of nurses to see what is out there? Like ICU, ER, Labor and delivery, pediatrics, med surg etc? There are so many different kinds of nursing out there. It would serve you well to look into that.    Also, just to throw another option out there. Have you looked into physical therapy or occupational therapy? That's another great field in healthcare.    My biggest advice to anyone in school is to truly spend some time shadowing people. School is expensive and difficult. I think it's best to make a solid decision based on some experience with these people. You may fall in love with a field or really say hell no to another. Don't get me wrong. I love all the education I've had. But I've been ridiculously lucky to have minimal debt through scholarships and grants. It's not as easy now to get the funding I've had for my other degrees.   That's just my thoughts. Many people might disagree with me or have different experiences than I do. I just hate seeing how expensive school is and seeing people bounce around accumulating debt. There isn't anything wrong with doing it that way. But just makes life harder down the road."
nursing,3d47mi,ancientgalaxies,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:36:04 2015 UTC,Why do nurses get touchy about that stuff? Lol I can't really think of any reason as to why. My mom is a registered nurse and she's not steering me away from nursing but she knows that nursing is not what I ultimately want to do.   According to this website: http://www.thepalife.com/who-gets-in/  many PA students have multiple years of experience in healthcare so to me it seems like a good idea to get a career in nursing for a few years and then apply to PA school.   Also do you know much about nursing? I'm pretty confused about how to get into a nursing school since it is different from just normally transferring to a four year college into some major. Thanks!
nursing,3d47mi,FrauKoko,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:31:08 2015 UTC,"Not all nurses get upset about it but some do. Admissions doesn't like it because they don't want to waste time training someone who ultimately will be a PA. May not be across the board but I know of people who talked about going to PA school during their interviews and were told they'd rather give the slots to people who want to be nurses. Again, this isn't true across the board but it's not something I'd recommend advertising. I don't think it's a bad idea but it's not something I'd easily give up. There are tons of ways to get your required experience.    It's been so long since I've done nursing school but I'm sure the process is still the same. Every school will have their own requirements which you can find on their website. But typically you'll have to complete prerequisites and maybe take and entrance exam. Not all schools will require the entrance exam. Then you apply and wait. Some schools will require interviews while others won't. Some have wait lists too. That's the generic answer. For more details, check out the school's website and they spell it out very clearly. It's impossible to know the details of all the schools because it does vary a little from place to place. Just make sure your prerequisites transfer."
nursing,3d47mi,olaoghaire,2,Thu Jul 16 20:58:39 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of applied science (microbiology, chemistry, pharmocology, anatomy/physiology) in nursing."
nursing,3d47mi,Sahnus,2,Mon Jul 13 11:58:18 2015 UTC,"Haven't done such a change but I hope this helps in some way.  Besides the study program, it depends on how well you update yourself on science afterwards. There's a ton of research papers and journals on nursing, medicine, pharmacology, nutrition, geriatric or whatever field you're interested in to keep yourself updated on. Particularly this has kept me to still be interested in nursing and made research papers more fun to read as I already know somewhat about the subject from my study program. From there on you can make it as much or less science as you feel."
nursing,3d47mi,mynameismaryjo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:58:01 2015 UTC,"I personally liked anesthesia school because of the ""science-y"" aspect of things. We had a whole course of chem and physics, plus theres always pharmacology in the whole program."
nursing,3d47mi,rninnj,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:37:42 2015 UTC,"You could take your ""sciencey"" background and work hem-onc and go into research. and you can relocate, switch specialities and all that good stuff. But you need to make sure you have the heart and thick skin to succeed in nursing. The money and flexible schedule are good, but not if you dont have the right personality!"
nursing,3d0azd,Sahnus,25,Sun Jul 12 12:22:12 2015 UTC,"ASN and BSN nurses share the same license: RN. However, ASN is a 2 year degree while BSN is the traditional 4 year degree. Same bedside/clinical time and same core classes like pathophysiology and pharmacology as well as clinical time. However, the BSN requires classes like a fine arts credit, nursing theory, and nursing leadership to make you more ""well-rounded."" A BSN is required before a masters (MSN) or doctorate (DNP) that allow you to work as a nurse practitioner, nurse anesthetist, or other advanced practice roles that often come with prescriptive privileges. There have been a couple studies that show improved patient outcomes and lower mortality among BSN nurses but it's a pretty sensitive subject and a lot of people disagree. Whether you agree with it or not, many hospitals will only hire BSNs anymore and at minimum a BSN is required for management positions. Many ASNs go back later to complete their BSN."
nursing,3d0azd,katherine_rf,7,Sun Jul 12 12:44:51 2015 UTC,I would guess a BSN is better paid than an ASN?
nursing,3d0azd,teeneyxb,6,Sun Jul 12 14:26:41 2015 UTC,Not in all areas. I'm from Indiana and ASN and BSN are at the same rate of pay. Though at many of the hospitals have a stipulation for new hires with their ASN that they must complete their BSN within 2-3 years.
nursing,3d0azd,Liv-Julia,4,Sun Jul 12 16:49:05 2015 UTC,"Not in most places. In fact, I don't know most of my colleagues' degrees. As long as they have achieved an RN designation (passed a huge nation wide test) they are my colleague."
nursing,3d0azd,newmacgirl,2,Sun Jul 12 19:10:52 2015 UTC,"Not here,  they started at the same pay. And pay is based on experience. Although the as the market is getting saturated the BSN nurse are getting hired first."
nursing,3d0azd,lacey18,3,Sun Jul 12 18:15:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, and a lot of hospitals are working on having nurses with a minimum of BSN education. So an ASN could limit your opportunities for employment if you want to work in a hospital."
nursing,3d0azd,kukukajoonurse,2,Sun Jul 12 15:06:23 2015 UTC,But an ASN would have better opportunities with nursing homes?
nursing,3d0azd,wicksa,2,Sun Jul 12 20:31:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are more frequently employed in Nursing homes, at least where I live (Midwest USA)."
nursing,3d0azd,kukukajoonurse,6,Sun Jul 12 20:51:21 2015 UTC,"Here in Norway they went away from hiring CNAs in hospitals several years ago, nurses didn't really like them and wanted nurses only. Why not! But then they figured out CNA were pretty handy to have and cheaper too. So they changed all of that, at many wards at hospitals at least."
nursing,3d0azd,wicksa,2,Sun Jul 12 20:59:03 2015 UTC,"It is a similar story in the UK. We used to have 2 levels, diploma and bachelors degree (and one university that offered an undergraduate masters but doesnt anymore), they were both 3 years but the degree programme students did more work in final year. With the evidence to show lower mortality rates when nurses have a degree, the diploma has now been abolished and new nurses only have the one option. I do think the diploma (and maybe the ASN in the case of american nurses) is a good idea though, it enabled my Mom to become a nurse when she couldnt afford to fund herself on the degree (the goverment gave small grants to students studying the diploma). And my Mom is a fantastic well rounded nurse. And I assume this is the case for people who cannot afford to fund themselves for 4 years (rather than just 2) in America."
nursing,3d0azd,Capitan_Failure,2,Sun Jul 12 12:55:22 2015 UTC,"Strangely here in the USA the Associates level nurse and the Bachelors is pretty much equal. The reason is that before you can even apply to an associates program you have to have a TON of classes already done which equal more than the first year of a BSN program.  I took all my sciences and general education classes before I applied. I applied at two schools- one was a two year associates program, and one was 4 year BSN program. I was accepted to both and would have been starting as a transfer student in the BSN program in the 3rd year (with only one extra class to take- statistics). I still would have the same 2 years in the ADN (same as ASN).  Essentially it would have taken me the same to get a BSN as it did to get ADN but had to choose the lower degree as the school was very close to home and family obligations ruled.   So yeah, I forgot to say BSN can be 3 or 4 years depending on the school.   I don't know if they have diploma RN programs anymore here in the USA but they must somewhere.   My advice to anyone thinking of nursing is start at community college to save money if that is an issue and then go for the BSN if you can. It opens more doors as Magnet hospitals will only hire BSN from what I understand, and also large cities such as Boston seem to demand it."
nursing,3d0azd,outrunningzombies,3,Mon Jul 13 03:48:31 2015 UTC,I graduated from a diploma program! We had to do all the prereqs required for the ADN programs in the area. I applied to 3 ADN programs in addition to the diploma program. I picked it because of the greater amount of clinical hours and ties to the hospital it was associated with. I had a job at that hospital immediately after graduating and they paid for 70% of my bachelors degree.
nursing,3d0azd,olaoghaire,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:55:45 2015 UTC,Was this recently? I wasn't sure they were still around!   Sounds like you got an awesome deal!!
nursing,3d0azd,auraseer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:43:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, 2012, and the school is still up and running! It's actually the oldest nursing diploma school that is still operating in the US! There are two other diploma schools within an hour from me as well. It might be more of an east coast thing, not sure!"
nursing,3d0azd,auraseer,-3,Fri Jul 17 01:54:33 2015 UTC,"Id like to add that ASN is a 2 year degree that takes a bare minimum of 3 years with a very heavy course load, it took me 5 with a lighter course load at first.   Its probably why most BSN bridge only take one year."
nursing,3d0azd,olaoghaire,3,Sun Jul 12 12:58:11 2015 UTC,"RN bridge programs are one year because they assume your 2 years of pre reqs are already done (history, science, stats) and your ASN credits count as the 3rd year.  I applied to ASN and BSN programs. My BSN program was 12-16 credits a semester for 4 semesters. The ASN programs were 9 credits a semester for 4 semesters."
nursing,3d0azd,firstsnowfall,21,Sun Jul 12 19:33:23 2015 UTC,"We have an embarrasment of choices! There are a ton of different levels:    LPN/LVN - licensed practical nurse/licensed vocational nurse, can do most things that an RN can, but can't do assessments. Can't do IVs unless IV certified. 1 year training program. ASN -- this is a 2 year training program that leads to an RN. It covers the basics of the first two years of college, plus the core nursing courses.  These are offered at community colleges or through hospital related programs.   BSN - this is a 4 year bachelors degree. It includes all of the basic general education of a bachelors degree, plus all of the core nursing classes, plus more nursing theory and more management stuff and more research oriented courses.  (For example, most will require a course in statistics, but most ASN courses won't.)   That's  the core entry level stuff. One someone has a license there are a ton of programs which allow LPNs to bridge to RN at either level, and which allow an ASN to bridge to a BSN. These usually require an additional 1-2 years of work.   At the graduate level, there are two main tracks. One track is advanced practice track that leads to licensure as a nurse practioner.  This is available at the Masters level currently, but they are planning on moving all of those over to a Doctorate in Nursing Practice going forward.     The second tract is a research tract that leads to a research PhD.  You can go straight into a PhD program with a BSN or you can earn an MSN first.  Every school has different entrance requirments.  There are also dual degree programs that allow folks to earn an MSN/MBA in management and business, for people who are on the  administrative side of nursing."
nursing,3d0azd,gynoceros,5,Sun Jul 12 13:44:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that cleared some things. But I have to ask, why have so many different nurses? Is it to delegate the more basic nursing tasks over different nurses (LPN, CNA) and have the RN do the more advanced tasks? Or is it that the bachelor course is too expensive for some and LPN or ASN is just perfect?"
nursing,3d0azd,auraseer,8,Sun Jul 12 14:24:39 2015 UTC,"CNAs are not nurses. They work under the direction of nurses to perform basic care tasks, like bathing, feeding, transfers, and lots of the other routine stuff.   The other distinctions vary between states, but here is a very general description:  LPNs are nurses, are trained in tasks that only nurses may perform, like giving medication. But they are trained to care for stable patients with a predictable plan of care. They cannot do tasks that require independent assessment, such as transfusing blood. If a patient's condition changes, they are not supposed to change the plan of care themselves, but should instead seek direction from an RN or physician.  RNs are also nurses and are trained to practice with less oversight. We perform our own assessments, respond to more changes in patient condition, and make more decisions about care. We follow doctors' orders when providing medical care (like giving drugs), but act with a lot of independence in providing nursing care.   The difference between ADN and BSN is less clear cut. They are both RNs and have the same job, or the same scope of practice. But the BSN-prepared nurse has more education in the underlying science, and is supposed to understand more about why we do what we do."
nursing,3d0azd,gynoceros,2,Sun Jul 12 16:45:26 2015 UTC,"In Norway we have something called ""hjelpepleier"", which translate to nursing assistant. Now they call it ""helsepersonell"" though, which translate to healthcare worker. I guess hjelpepleier/helsepersonell is the same as CNA in the USA. That makes more sense to me now at least. Doing basic care tasks like you said, bathing etc.  I also have the power, or you could say I have the responsibility, to follow up changes in plan of care or change them myself. I work at a nursing home and I can decide by myself if there is a need for an extra healthcare worker to overlook a resident over the night without having to confront my boss. My boss would have liked to be noticed about it, of course, but he give me the responsibility to take that decision.  Another thing. How much theory and practice at nursing home/hospital do you have on the bachelor degree program? And what type of practice do you have?"
nursing,3d0azd,Shellback1,3,Sun Jul 12 20:44:26 2015 UTC,"Theory courses directly related to nursing include classes on nursing practice and tasks, clinical assessment, pathophysiology, pharmacology, nutrition, psychiatric care, policy/legality, childbirth, pediatrics, and geriatrics. A BSN student also gets a basic background in biology, chemistry, microbiology, anatomy/physiology, psychology, and statistics. I may have forgotten a few others.  Practical experience includes actually spending time in hospital units, providing patient care. This has even more variation by state and by program, but an example list would be one rotation each in adult care, pediatrics, labor & delivery, geriatrics, psychiatric care, and community health, adding up to a total of about 1000 hours."
nursing,3d0azd,Nighthawke78,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:56:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer!  Sounds pretty much similar to how it is in Norway then. With theory and length or practice. But we had our practice divided into different levels of nursing and system in health care (periods lasting 6-8 weeks). We had 1 period in medical and 1 in clinical hospital ward, 1 period in nursing home, 1 in community based care (home care), 1 in delegating/leadership at nursing home, and 1 in psychiatric ward (I was at a deaf place, pretty weird psychiatric practice). But it all came down to luck really. Some got pediatric, some got cool clinical (organ transportation). I was lucky enough to get two periods of medical practice at hospital but no home care practice."

nursing,3d0azd,antisocialoctopus,6,Sun Jul 12 22:36:13 2015 UTC,"We use a lot of CNAs to do basic care -- baths, linen changes, vitals -- because nurses are expensive.   LPNs are used a lot in nursing homes/facilities and home health care where the patients have mostly stable and need help with treatments/med passes.  The number of training programs are a historical artifact.  Nurses were first trained in hospital programs, then community colleges got into it, and then the BSN and graduate programs were added as the profession became more professional and scoped out an area of practice that was independent of being a doctor's assistant.   None of it standardized. Nursing education is supervised by 50+ jurisdictions. Every state certifies its own criteria for the license.  Local programs have a great deal of influence in making sure that they are allowed to continue to turn out nurses or that they are allowed to offer new programs like a BSN  or an MSN.    It's really anything the market will bear."
nursing,3d0azd,bawki,3,Sun Jul 12 22:43:31 2015 UTC,The MSN for NPs isn't going anywhere. The only people calling for that recommendation are nursing PhDs with no actual clinical experience. Most DNP curriculums I've seen are jokes. Anyway every state would have to change their requirements for licensure and that ain't happening with the primary care shortage prevalent in every single state. Schools are transitioning to DNP because they're greedy for the tuition money but not all schools are following suit. It's like Associates and BSN. Both will lead to RN and maybe in some markets a BSN is necessary to land a job but that took over 30 years to happen. I doubt that'll happen anytime soon for NP
nursing,3d0azd,St_Maximus_Gato,42,Sun Jul 12 22:55:27 2015 UTC,"The American nurse education:    put students through arduous process to get accepted to program.

This can come in the form of threats of being kicked out of the program, seeing their friends get kicked out of the program, horror stories about a student a few semesters ago, making them responsible for 800 pages of expensive textbook material over the course of a six-week module, the skills practicum, or care plans. Deprive them of sleep, nutrition, contact with their families, and time to work so they can pay their bills. If they still graduate, release them into a market where there's allegedly a nursing shortage but where it can be hard to find a job without experience, even harder if your program confers an associate's degree and not a bachelor's. learn everything for real on the job."

I put in a ton of work, and there were a few panic attacks and nights where I didn't think I'd make it. Hell, there were a few people who didn't make it. But it was far from hell, and I knew it would be hard going in. Like others said, though, my classmates were bugging out."

nursing,3d0azd,kukukajoonurse,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:00:42 2015 UTC,I constantly hear these stories of nursing school hell and they sound just like most other challenging degrees that I've seen. My BS Biology was far more difficult than nursing school was. Nursing school was 50% busy work. I figure a lot of it is the field self-perpetuating this myth that nursing school is harder than everything else and a bit of martyr syndrome that also seems to be common.

nursing,3d0azd,Sarahh666,3,Sun Jul 12 16:26:24 2015 UTC,"Haha, I didn't really experience all of those problems, but definitely sounds familiar to my ex nurse students. When I started my fifth semester I worked extra as a ""nurse"" (had a nurse on another ward I could call if need) at a nursing home (delegating tasks, giving out medicine, procedures, calling the doctor if need etc.). And of those somewhat 450-500 hours I worked from my fifth to my last, sixth semester, I learnt more than my previous four semester. Weird that. So happy I had the opportunity to work as a nurse those two last semester. I would never feel as ready and confident now that I have graduated."
nursing,3d0azd,Sarahh666,3,Sun Jul 12 15:40:09 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your typical overdramatic nurse here. 1) Got accepted into a program straight out of high school with good grades.  Only standardized test I took was SAT's.  No drug testing.  Criminal background checks only after acceptance and it was hospital hospital policy for clinical not school policy. 2) Never once felt threatened by my school and was often given extra help by professors.  Course work was manageable and care plans sucked by forced me to learn necessary material.  Learned good time management skills and had a social life in school. 3) My school had a very low attrition rate.  Had 4 different ICU job offers within a month of graduating.  Everyone I know I graduated with got jobs within the first two months. 4) Learn a lot on the job, but the nursing school provides that backbone you need to excel at your job"

nursing,3d0sqj,shelbee_b,15,Sun Jul 12 15:47:16 2015 UTC,"Navy nurse here.  I would get to the recruiter NOW because once you graduate you are competing for a tiny number of spots each year (usually low double digits nationwide) against very experienced nurses.  It's a pretty great gig at times, but we just don't need that many nurses right now so your best bet is to get in as a student instead of as a practicing nurse.  Find a healthcare officer recruiter (I think navy.com lets you search by speciality) and begin pursuing them and start the process ASAP.    If you have more specific questions just let me know."
nursing,3d0sqj,justatouchcrazy,4,Sun Jul 12 17:27:52 2015 UTC,"I'm a perioperative nurse with 3 years of experience circulating and scrubbing. I have two brothers one is an E7 and the other is an E4. Ill most likely finish my MSN next year. Im planning on joining as soon as I finish my MSN and get my nurse educator certification. How difficult will it be for me to join if I get letters of recommendation from my brothers, considering my specialty, and my experience and education?"
nursing,3d0sqj,CaMurse,4,Sun Jul 12 19:14:34 2015 UTC,"I can't recall, but I think all the letters of recommendation needed to come from people that are considered your peers or from commissioned officers.  On paper enlisted, especially junior (E-4) enlisted, are not professional peers.  Plus, a letter of recommendation from a non-relative looks better, and the rules might not even allow for a relative to write one.  When I applied I needed letters from a peer/coworker, preferably a supervisor, a Naval Officer and an academic source.  Your speciality is very much in demand and that puts you way ahead.  However, we train our own periop nurses, so I'm not sure if they would accept you directly into the OR or if they would put you through their school.  But certification and an advanced degree is another huge bonus when applying.  So long as you're healthy, have good grades, have no legal issues and are able to write and interview well you should have a good shot.  Plus I think you have an equally strong chance at the Reserves, if that's something that would interest you.  However, I am not a recruiter and my knowledge just comes from talking to those that are and what I'm hearing from our leadership.  I can't be sure of the specifics of today's recruiting and manpower needs."
nursing,3d0sqj,justatouchcrazy,3,Sun Jul 12 20:27:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed. As a prior service Sailor, if it's the same as enlisted, I would suggest seeing a healthcare officer recruiter Sept-Nov when they start their quota over again.   (USS Kearsarge , HM3)"
nursing,3d0sqj,CourtM092,3,Sun Jul 12 23:02:30 2015 UTC,"See them now.  The board meets at the start of the new fiscal year (usually October or November depending on board schedule), so you want everything done by the end of September if possible.  That includes MEPS, interviews, paperwork, SF-86...everything.  Unlike the enlisted side, officers don't sign/swear in or pick jobs at MEPS, instead all that paperwork is sent up the chain for review by the board.  It's basically just medical and misc. paperwork for us."
nursing,3d0sqj,justatouchcrazy,3,Sun Jul 12 23:17:11 2015 UTC,"Definitely MEPS, that is one ridiculously long day. At the meps I went to, Commissioning Officers getting their physicals and paperwork went first -- as the fleet, so that's a plus I guess.   Just wondering, how much experience is a decent amount to Commission? And you guys don't go to OCS, right? It's just a direct Commission? I have a buddy who does Medical IT stuff in the Army who had a direct commission and he says Medical, Nursing and Dental Corps are direct commissions as well. Is this true?"
nursing,3d0sqj,CourtM092,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:36:13 2015 UTC,"We go through ODS; it's at the same training command but is much more relaxed and only 5 weeks long.  Also pretty much everyone graduates regardless; we already have a commission and our commands are expecting us right after ODS, so the delay isn't always appreciated.    You can be a direct commission, in which case there isn't a magic number of experience.  I got accepted with only 9 months of RN experience, but a solid resume with a decent amount of non-nursing experience, and others with years have been turned down.  It's the entire package they are looking at, not just your resume.  However, not all nurses are direct commission.  You can come in as a student via a few different means, so that's a more traditional commission, or there are programs for enlisted members to go to school."
nursing,3d0sqj,justatouchcrazy,2,Mon Jul 13 15:10:47 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm not OP but I'm actually trying to do the same thing, except I am only going into my Sophmore year of college.   First I went to the Navy website and found an officer recruitment office number near me, called that number and it the number didn't work. So I then called the enlisted recruiter and they then gave me a number to call for a specific officer recruiter.  I called that number, no answer. Figured maybe he wasn't in yet cause I called kinda early. I call the next day a little later and he doesn't answer again, so this time I left a message like his voice mail said to briefly saying what my goal was and some contact info.   It's been a week and I haven't heard a thing, so I don't really know what to do with this whole recruiter thing because I apparently have the worst luck ever. If you have any 2 cents to give that would be much appreciated"
nursing,3d0sqj,cmilkamp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:54:00 2015 UTC,"Healthcare recruiters can be hard to get in touch with because there is often only one for a large (multiple state) geographic area.  So when they are out traveling or doing college visits they obviously aren't in the office.  However, they should provide a cell number or email address to reach them.  If not I think navy.com has a chat feature and they might be able to point you in the right direction?    I'm not sure though, that's a crappy situation if they don't call back soon-ish."

nursing,3d0sqj,cmilkamp,5,Mon Jul 13 23:42:33 2015 UTC,"I looked into joining the navy as well as a nurse after I graduate and let me tell you: it's tough. Like, really tough. There's a program they run called the navy nurse candidate program that you start as a student and after graduation you're straight in, but given you graduate at the end of the academic year I think it's actually a little too late for you. :(  There's other options I believe but I'm not as aware of what they would be since I never looked into them personally.  My only suggestion is the same one the recruiter I was working with gave me, as well as several friends who are either currently in the navy or had previous experience. Talk with a recruiter and get an idea of what skills or specialty would make you a strong candidate later down the road, as well as anything else that may help (Mine for example stressed that he thought leadership/active presence in the community is helpful). Graduate, pass the NCLEX, and then do whatever you can to get into that position and get some experience under your belt. When you think you're in a good place, try applying and see what you can get.    Whatever you decide, best of luck to you!"

I couldn't be happier with my decision. It's definitely best to get in while you're still in school, but the process of applying/interviewing/getting clearance/being accepted, etc. took me 6-8 months, so I would definitely advise you to start now if it's something you're interested in, and then if you change your mind during the process you can go ahead and call it quits.  Get in touch with a local recruiter! That's the best way to start. If you're in the philly area I can give you the NRD info there, but otherwise search here!"
nursing,3d0sqj,islandfaraway,3,Sun Jul 12 23:03:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the oncoming wall of text....  As far as the nursing end, I can't exactly comment, but my family has tons of experience in the service (veterans of every war since WWII except Korea, in every service but the Coast Guard). For the Navy, or any service in general, take everything your recruiter says with a truckload of salt, and if it's not in writing before you ship off from MEPS, it didn't/won't happen. There are some recruiters that are honest guys, but treat them all like a car dealer honest to make a sale. They are trying to sell you on joining, and will do whatever they legally and ethically do to get you to sign on the line that is dotted. And sometimes the illegal and unethical stuff too. They are in the minority, and they have been cracking down on it, but it still happens. The best thing is to imply to your recruiter that you know your shit and can't be played, but still examine everything, and once again, get it in writing.  To make your life easy before/after you join up? Make sure you can meet or exceed the current physical standards for the service you wish to join. Research and learn as much as you can before you hit boot camp, but don't flaunt the knowledge (other sailors will use you as a crutch; and drill instructors hate nothing more than a cocky know it all). Simple stuff like knowing what symbolizes what rank, what your chain of command is, directions on a ship (port, starboard, bow, stern), and other naval terms. Bathroom = head. Kitchen = galley. Stuff like that. Be prepared, but don't act like a know it all.  After you join? Stay out of trouble. You want your superior officers to know your name in connection for good things, not bad, as that shit will come back to bite you come time to advance in rank. Don't go out partying all the time and act like a drunk, word will get around. Officers and non-comms talk about their subordinates. A lot. My brother has standing offers from tons of his former bosses for recommendation letters even after he got out because he was on the good side of things (but remember, don't kiss ass, that's different).  And mostly, if you are going to do 4/6 years? Save, save, save. Live as simple as you can for those 4/6 years. Stay on base, eat in the chow halls, drive a cheap old beater. I worked with a guy in college that did 4 years on a sub, saved about 70% of his pay, and when he got out moved back to Bloomington, enrolled in IU with his GI bill and bought a house in cash, all at the age of 22. By the time he graduated, he had no student debt, flipped the house for about $20k profit and walked into a job making low 6 figures in the IT industry. And still had more cash than he knew what to do with.  The service can be as good or bad as you make it, depending on what you are willing to put into it. You can see the world, save a shit ton of money and have your further education paid for, and even have some fun along the way. Or it can be 4 years of pain. That part is up to you."

With no experience you need to be extremely lucky, or contact them now get into a candidate program for students( I forget what they're called. The recruiter said even 3 months experience vastly increases your chances.  We had a presentation in school from a Navy Healthcare Accessions(sp?) recruiter. This is who you need to contact, don't talk to the mall recruiters unless you're trying to find an officer recruiter, specifically for healthcare, which you shouldn't need beecause you can find them through the navy website."

Also, most slings can be left under the patient when they are in wheelchairs or on the commode. But most importantly, if the patient is oriented, just ask him what works best for him. He will always be the primary authority about his condition."

We left the blisters open to air and put nonadherent occlusive dressing over the ones that popped. Dry ones get left alone. A patient with an odd skin disorder should have a dermatology note or some special recommendations somewhere. Consider giving analgesics prior to nursing care (e.g., first thing in the morning prior to their bath- Tylenol is a wonder drug). Also be aware of different pain scales so you can recognize objective signs of pain in your patient."

Her dressing changes were very extensive, but I was also told she nor her family took very good care of her condition.  I think her head was the only part of her body that didn't have some sort of open area.   It's been a few years, but I think we used xeroform and kerlix to cover open areas. She was ad lib, so we didn't have concerns about lifts and transferring. She was in a negative pressure room and was on protective isolation due to her many many open areas. I don't know any more of the specifics of her care, so I don't think I'm much help. =/ However, it certainly was an interesting case to see."

Yes, most skilled nursing facilities pay a crap wage, usually starting at ~$12 in my experience.   I can't answer the demand vs compensation question for sure. My thoughts are that CNAs are easily replaced. Skilled nursing facilities just don't have the money to start out there workers at a higher rate. It sucks, CNAs get the shit end of it a lot of times.  In addition to skilled nursing facilites I would look into hospital positions. I know it may be hard without experience, but Ive seen it done. Hospitals usually start there techs (CNAs) out at around $15.  This will also be better experience for nursing school.   I don't know if this was any help to you.

I'd like to work my way up to a hospital position, could I do this through 6 months of experience in assisted living? Are there any extra certifications or training (e.g. phlebotomy tech) that would bolster my resume as well as my chances of getting in? Are there any particular facilities that I should actively try to seek out or avoid?   Thanks!"

I would just start applying to positions, a lot of them say they want a year or two of experience, but just go ahead and apply, it can't hurt.  As far as certifications, try to get all the certifications relevant to CNA, your school should help you out with that. Phlebotomy would be a different position all together.   As far as facilities I don't have any ones to avoid."

What you could do is post a resume (one that is modified for your privacy) on Craigslist specifying how much you'd like and that you want the employer to cover the cost of those certifications.

nursing,3d28t0,TorchIt,2,Sun Jul 12 23:31:23 2015 UTC,"As others have said get a bachelors in anything but realistically focus on biology or something closely related. I would strongly recommend becoming an EMT and working a casual part time during your undergrad time. As was said elsewhere most schools require some type of patient contact time. As an EMT you will be (while at a basic level) interviewing, assessing, planning and carrying out treatments. This, while on a different level, is what you will do as a PA so it's a good base compared to a CNA. If you can transition this into a job as an ER tech all the better. Secondly I would pick being a scribe in the ER if that exists near you. Most importantly now is try and shadow a few PAs and see if that is actually want you want to do."
nursing,3d28t0,TorchIt,5,Sun Jul 12 23:22:44 2015 UTC,Alright thanks man! Appreciate the help.
nursing,3d28t0,NurseRattchet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:33:39 2015 UTC,"1) You'll need a bachelors degree in something in order to apply to PA school.  PA is a graduate degree.  2) You can major in anything.  There is no requirement for undergraduate study before you apply to PA programs, much like med school itself.  However, many programs require several hundreds of hours of direct patient contact time before they'll even interview you for a seat.  EMT, nursing, phlebotomy...doesn't really matter.  They just want people with patient care experience.  4) This is going to vary wildly based on the region and specialty.  Think anywhere between 70k-120k.  Surgery will typically pay higher, with orthopedic being the highest."
nursing,3d28t0,TorchIt,2,Sun Jul 12 23:07:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input man this really helps out a lot. I have a few questions to ask though. 1) What bachelor's degree do you believe I should focus on to help me in my future career? Subjects such as Anatomy and Psychology? 2) On a rough estimate, how long do you believe I can finish all my requirements in order to actually be employed and being paid?"
nursing,3d28t0,NurseRattchet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:30:07 2015 UTC,"There are prerequisites for getting into PA school that you'll need to take on top of your bachelor's.  Namely, you'll need Anatomy 1 & 2, Microbiology, Biology 1 & 2, Genetics, at least one Psychology, possibly Immunology, and preferably up to Calc 1 for math.    Any bachelor's that requires these classes as well would reduce the amount of time you need to spend in school by at least a year.  Nursing requires most of these, as does a lot of biology degrees.  Nursing is nice in that you'll have the opportunity to get a portion of your patient contact hours out of the way while in school through your clinicals.    The only downside to majoring in nursing for a plan like this is that it's balls hard.  You'll need a fairly high cumulative GPA in order to get into a PA program, and nursing school isn't the best way to get guaranteed As.    All in all, I plan on doing the same thing you're doing.  I'm a BSN student, and I'm going to have to work my ass off to keep my GPA up in order to get accepted.  We'll see how it works out for me and I'll report back in two years haha"

nursing,3d28t0,NurseRattchet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:00:01 2015 UTC,Physician assistant isn't a 'brand' of nursing. Nurse practitioner is.  But you and OP may want to look at becoming a nurse practitioner as an alternative to a PA program.
nursing,3d28t0,TorchIt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:59:26 2015 UTC,"I have zero interest in becoming an NP.    First of all, the curriculum for NP programs isn't at all standardized. There are programs that involve no additional clinical hours, and those that require another 700. There are NP programs that are extremely managerial and ones that are more patient based.  Frankly, nursing can't get its shit together enough to standardize an undergraduate entry degree, and things aren't looking great on the graduate side either.  NPs choose a specialty. PAs do not.  If at any point I choose to switch fields as a PA, I would be able to do so with no strings attached.   But the bigger issue to me is that PA schools are more science based.  The team building and administration focused courses just aren't present.  At most schools, PA students join the second year medical students on their rotations.    I have more confidence in the education I'm getting at that level.  I work with a lot of different physicians, and every single one of them has said that they'd trust a PA over an NP every time, and they cite the educational differences between the two as the reason why."
nursing,3d28t0,GP4LEU,3,Mon Jul 13 05:11:33 2015 UTC,"Wow. If you dislike nursing so much and are so on top of it I'm surprised you are choosing to become a lowly nurse prior to PA school instead of something more science based. In fact, I'm surprised a genius like you didn't join the medical students on their FIRST rotation.  There are benefits to both and places for both and you will not do yourself any favors shitting on anyone's profession.  My entire point in replying to this was for OP to know that you do not need to get your bachelors in nursing to become a physician assistant. In fact I think it's a rather silly way to do it. Also, a PA practices under a physician's license while a nurse practitioner is an independent provider and doesn't need to worry about your physician's opinions anyways.   EDIT: For future reference OP-this is not the attitude you want to take with nurses."
nursing,3d28t0,Generoh,2,Mon Jul 13 05:21:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not shitting on nursing, I just don't want to be an NP.  Never claimed to be a genius for that matter either...I just said that I'm not at all interested in the administrative side of an NP degree.  I want an education that's more grounded in medicine.  You told me to look into NP.  My comment was to illustrate that I already have, and it's not a fit for me for XYZ reasons.  Also, I don't think that acknowledging the problems in our field can be considered ""shitting on nursing"" either.  I'm quite passionate about nursing and I truly think that spending a few years in the field will benefit me as a PA.  Is it the easiest way to go about it? No. I admitted as much to OP up thread. But it's how I'm doing it, and if it bothers other nurses that I'm ""jumping ship,"" then so be it.  If wanting a better education from a field with clearly defined standards is a problem for some people, then that's not my issue.  The independent practitioner thing is patently incorrect, by the way. That may be how your state is set up, but it isn't in mine.  It varies.  Furthermore, I have no desire to be independent, or to take over a PCP role.  My main interest is in surgery.  As a mid level provider, I'd want an MD looking over my shoulder anyway, even if I don't want to be a doctor myself."
nursing,3cyid9,management_drone,17,Sat Jul 11 22:55:33 2015 UTC,"A lot of hospitals want BSN prepared nurses, and grades really don't matter.   Only things you can do are keep looking for jobs (either in the area or look to move where there IS a job) and go back to school for a BSN.

We're just outside a major city, so there are going to be a ton of nurses out there, and she might have to consider riding it out for a year or two while she does her BSN. She was saying she doesn't want to seem like a job hopper, but I don't think it works like that anymore. She could move to another place and work for two years and no one would really give a hoot."

nursing,3cyid9,PRNmeds,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:28:36 2015 UTC,"Lots of hospitals want BSN nurses because they're trying to obtain 'Magnet Status' which is an award granted to hospitals showing that they attract all star nurses as employees. She doesn't necessarily have to have a BSN but if she is actively working on one, she should definitely put it on her application as ""BSN in progress, completion date in June 2016"" or something like that. They will likely count that as her having a BSN when they consider hiring her."
nursing,3cyid9,lemonade4,12,Mon Jul 13 04:58:01 2015 UTC,"Let me first say how much you're already doing for her by being on her side, supporting her goals, and presumably letting her vent after exceptionally shitty shifts. In my opinion that's huge.  Its always hard to advise when we don't know the exact climate of nursing in your area. I am in Chicago, and I know most hospitals here are very BSN leaning, some of the big ones even ONLY look at BSNs. My hospital doesn't have that rule, but I still work with only one ASN, and she came from out of state with very specific experience for our speciality. If you guys think that could be the problem, looking into ASN to BSN programs might be a good stepping stone. Your role in this would be supporting her, emotionally and/or financially.  Its a tough transition for people trying to go LTC to hospital settings. I suppose making sure her resume and CV in particular make it very clear why she's motivated to move to a more acute setting.   I don't feel I've given very good or helpful advice, but I do hope you can work together to figure out what she needs to do to get to a happier place. As I said, it seems like you're doing your best as her partner, and unfortunately the rest of this will likely fall to her. Best of luck."

I was in the exact same boat for a bit before I was able to sneak into a per diem psych job and luckily move within the hospital from there.  In the meantime, go online to every hospital/hospital system in the area, apply to all available positions, write down the reference number, and call back in a few days to follow up.  When the job fair rolls around again go back and keep your fingers crossed that the recruiter recognizes your name from your persistence.

I don't know how it is for ASNs in central Florida, but as a BSN, I was getting recruitment offers with signing bonuses to go work in progressive care down there before I even had six months of experience. They just have some massive facilities that are hungry for staff, from what I hear. I didn't bite partially because I'm very happy with my crew in Pensacola, and partially because I can barely handle the climate here as it is, and there's no way I'm moving father south."

Most of us were able to get jobs at smaller hospitals.  Not having a BSN in this industry right now is a huge disadvantage, so it will take a lot of grinding it resumes, and probably a lot of rejections.  The best thing you can do right now is sort her mentally. Get her a massage and tell her hour much you appreciate the sacrifice she is making at this job.

I just graduated with my ASN from a fair sized city in Indiana, and I just took a LTC position because the hospital didn't seem interested in me. My plan is to finish my BSN online as soon as possible while working at this job. Since I'm looking at another 12-18 months to bridge, I'm going to be there for a little while, unless my dream job calls me before then. I've promised myself that I'm going to stay with this job for at least a year before I leave, because I don't believe in job hopping. A year at a facility that doesn't involve long training periods (such as 3-4 months on some hospital units) seems acceptable for a new nurse who is still figuring out where she wants to be.   Long story short, she shouldn't be managing that many patients like that. As soon as possible, encourage her to get back into her BSN program, which is completely online for a lot of places. A RN bridge program is pretty easy to find around here, look into Purdue, Butler, WGU, and ISU just to name a few. Then have her apply to the hospitals again and again until something happens.  The job field is already friendly enough for new grads (I know at least 5 girls that got positions in the hospital right out of graduation), so her extra 2 years of experience will put her above much of the new nurse cohort out now."
nursing,3cyid9,threemilesdown,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:33:24 2015 UTC,"From what she's heard in the grapevine after her experience yesterday, the reason they weren't interested in her yesterday was because she wasn't a new nurse. The hospital system holding the job fair had just cut a lot of positions that were older, higher paid nurses. They wanted nurses fresh out of school so they could make them an low ball offer and they'd accept it. She saw several nurses that were fresh off taking their NCLEX getting shadow opportunities, but after they heard she worked LTC, they suddenly had no interest.

nursing,3cykuh,Tucc34,-1,Tue Jul 14 01:42:32 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, your husband is experiencing some of the responsibility differences between CNA's and RN's. Both CNA's and RN's are vital in the comfort and recovery of a patient in the hospital setting. However, CNA's do not understand the added stress of what comes along with the job when you are all of a sudden an RN. And I have heard this phenomena from many people who have done the same transition from CNA to RN. In time, he should get use to the additional stress that comes along with nursing. And with that being said, you need to know that nursing is an extremely stressful job. And the stress is different depending on the area that you work. For instance I work in a high acuity cardiovascular ICU. I manage and deal with some very sick sick patients that are close to death most days. However I have to occasionally float to the regular floor. The patients on the floor are obviously not nearly as sick as my home unit but it's just as stressful but the stresses are different. It's a good thing bc it keeps one humble. But with all this being said, it is important that you understand it is a stressful job and it has its many challenges as well as rewards. I am assuming he is a new nurse having one or less years experience. The first year is tough and ideally he will adjust and it will get easier.       As others have said, if he has a good enough relationship with the manager, schedule a meeting with her and voice concerns. I am afraid if they have cut on staff due to funding then the problem of not enough RN's and CNA's on the floor will not improve. At the end of the day, it's your husbands license on the line. If he feels like conditions are not safe for the patients and a conversation with management concludes with nothing happening, then he definitely needs a new job. I don't care how good his manager may be, if patient harm occurs on his watch due to short staffing, it is still his responsibility and he will be the one to be in trouble. He needs to protect his license and not wait any longer to find a new job in the case that the situation doesn't change. Also, working in new faculties really helps add experience to one's belt. I wish you and him the best. But talk these things out with him. He has options."
nursing,3cykuh,AnalWhisperer,-1,Sun Jul 12 07:13:19 2015 UTC,"Two nurses for 30 patients on a night shift and he still manages to struggle?! Wow. I've got 36 beds to myself, 16 skilled and 20 LTC with two aides. Two nurses would be a fucking dreamboat. Talking to management probably won't do anything because there's no way hes getting more staff. Quitting would be the best option I think."

nursing,3cylu2,womanwithoutborders,4,Sun Jul 12 01:20:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's fantastic that you're interested in the psych NP possibility, but if you have issues around vomit, that may present a problem, especially since you say it does have some impact on your daily life. I'm not even a registered nurse yet (I'm a medical scribe) and I see vomit in the ER on a daily basis. You're going to see that in nursing school for sure."
nursing,3cylu2,firstsnowfall,2,Sun Jul 12 00:32:12 2015 UTC,"That's my concern :( I know it'd be a risk within all aspects of the medical field, but on a daily basis.. that's just something I don't think I'm capable of handling."
nursing,3cylu2,_purplecats01,-1,Sun Jul 12 18:42:57 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. I'm 2 weeks away from graduating and haven't seen any vomiting at all. Nursing programs typically do not do rotations through the ER. The only possible exposure would be med-surg rotation but it entirely depends on your unit and the type of patients there.
nursing,3cylu2,dry_wit,3,Sun Jul 12 01:45:38 2015 UTC,To be fair vomit can happen any where I had a patients family member vomit once...
nursing,3cylu2,_purplecats01,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:10:11 2015 UTC,"It's one of those things that I think I could handle occasionally, but long term or on a daily basis, I just don't know if I can manage that. It's hard to get an idea as to how often it happens in nursing school because I'm just not sure where all you have to get experience."
nursing,3cylu2,Nighthawke78,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:41:49 2015 UTC,As a PMHNP you will not be exposed to daily vomit. Even during my med surg rotation I was only very occasionally exposed to vomit.
nursing,3cylu2,firstsnowfall,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:46:49 2015 UTC,Depends on what kinda of patients you have i work on a surgical floor and those patients throw up quite often. It happens in nursing and I don't like it but I am prepared to have to clean up my patient when it does.
nursing,3cylu2,Nighthawke78,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:09:44 2015 UTC,That's a pretty big blanket statement. We had a 6 week ER rotation in my BSN program.
nursing,3cylu2,firstsnowfall,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:28:15 2015 UTC,I said typically. not all. That's great that you had that experience
nursing,3cylu2,maybethistimeiwin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:16:37 2015 UTC,It really was. I think most of us got to do 20-30 IV starts during that rotation.
nursing,3cylu2,firstsnowfall,2,Mon Jul 13 20:30:12 2015 UTC,"As for educational options, I am pretty sure you still have to get your BSN in nursing, pass the NCLEX, build up a year to three years of experience and then apply for your psychiatric nurse practitioner. If you are still up for the challenge, look up big hospitals and see if you could volunteer to assist in patient care. Get your toes wet before you decide to dive in.   None of this is true for psych NPs (or any NP for that matter) except for the passing NCLEX part. BSN is not necesssary, neither is the RN experience. Many elite nursing schools have accelerated NP programs for non-nurses with another Bachelors, and a BSN is not given, only the RN license.  I'm currently attending one and am halfway through. Nobody has any issue finding a job afterwards. Is it ideal? No. But they educate us enough so that we are prepared to practice as an NP without the requisite RN experience."
nursing,3cylu2,vigor145,2,Sun Jul 12 01:10:56 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to jack this threat but.... I'm in a similar position as OP and I have my BS in psych as well, currently a CMA and am interested in getting my ARNP. Is that similar to NP? How does one practice for the NCLEX without having gotten a BSN? Is your program online or is it something that needs to be attained in a face to face setting? Thanks in advanced for your time!"
nursing,3cylu2,firstsnowfall,3,Sun Jul 12 01:38:25 2015 UTC,"Did you mean thread? lol. NPs have different names depending on your state (annoying, I know).  APRN is one of them. There's also APN (advanced practicing nurse) and ARNP. Are you interested in becoming a Psych NP? I would suggest you try to shadow one and see if that role suits what you are looking for. BSN isn't necessary for NCLEX. You can take the NCLEX doing a 2 year associates as well, but there's also accelerated BSN programs that are one year long. My program is at Vanderbilt and the first year is essentially an accelerated BSN but you don't get a BSN (works out better this way because the full 2 years are considered graduate degree so you get more loans). After the first year you start your specialty NP year which is another year or so depending on the specialty. Psych is 2 years pretty much non-stop for the whole thing form start to finish. You need pre-reqs before you can get accepted, like anatomy and physiology, microbiology, and some others. It's an expensive program too, but it's well worth it for the income potential and the job security. You save a lot of time doing the accelerated route (and thus make more money in the long run since you'll be working sooner). Vanderbilt and Boston College are the only psych NP programs that are 2 years. Yale, UCSF, Seattle U, MGH, U Penn, and maybe a few others have same program but it's 3 years. All of these programs are face to face. I know that at my school it's possible to do distance for the specialty year but you need to find your own preceptors (which is annoying) and still have to come to campus every month for a week. If this is the route you want to take I suggest you shadow a psych NP and build good rapport to get a letter of recommendation and try to volunteer in a mental health setting. Spend a year doing this and taking your pre-reqs, get a good GRE score if your GPA isn't ideal, and you should be fine. Psych is one of the least competitive specialties because not too many people want to go into it, but it's still not easy to get in. But doable. I got into all 5 programs I applied to. PM me if you want to talk more"

nursing,3cylu2,vigor145,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:54:50 2015 UTC,"My program is MSN. The DNP isn't required to become an NP. Most people seem to believe otherwise that the requirement is changing, which it isnt. I have no desire to do a DNP.

nursing,3cuqcf,Rawrzimon,34,Fri Jul 10 22:55:18 2015 UTC,Colors are for gauges.
nursing,3cuqcf,captain_thrace,7,Fri Jul 10 23:01:54 2015 UTC,I honestly did not know that for injection needles; I knew thats how it worked for IV needles. I guess this is my first time then seeing two needles of the same gauge but different length.
nursing,3cuqcf,captain_thrace,2,Fri Jul 10 23:08:46 2015 UTC,Yeah. They actually do the same thing for IV needles. You can get them in 1 or 1/2 inch lengths.
nursing,3cuqcf,imanedrn,2,Fri Jul 10 23:45:11 2015 UTC,I don't think our hospital is that fancy to have different lengths. The PICC team probably keeps them locked up but we only have all the same lengths on our floors.
nursing,3cuqcf,conundrum2,2,Sat Jul 11 02:27:37 2015 UTC,The OR typically stocks the longer ones.
nursing,3cuqcf,ARM_rn,15,Sat Jul 11 15:46:35 2015 UTC,Why would they do that?  Color indicates the gauge of the needle.  Not the length.  The length is very clearly marked on the package.

nursing,3cuqcf,CandyCancer,2,Fri Jul 10 23:09:10 2015 UTC,Ya same here. Use them for sc injections and sometimes they get stocked in the cart by mistake and you put it on a needle and bring it to and patient and and when you are about to give it they see it and go hell no.
nursing,3cuqcf,MaK_Ultra,2,Fri Jul 10 23:14:14 2015 UTC,I try not to trust colors after hearing about the Lovenox fiasco. I only use it for guessing the gauge of an IV in an admitted patient that wasn't reported.
nursing,3cuqcf,taterhotdish,3,Sat Jul 11 09:43:11 2015 UTC,What is the Lovenox fiasco?
nursing,3cuqcf,CandyCancer,2,Sat Jul 11 10:06:47 2015 UTC,"From what I was told, nurses pulling Lovenox syringes by color only and not reading the dose on the label has lead to a significant number of deaths.

nursing,3cuqcf,CandyCancer,4,Sat Jul 11 11:04:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And when it comes to metered doses, it is important to verify. I have requested verification with metered doses (ie, 47mg at 1mg/ml) and have told the pharmacist that my pyxis dose was not metered (ie, 5mg=5ml and that is it) and the pharmacists saying ""omg, you are the first to point this out! how many times has the patient received an OD?..."" Grateful that I had a kick-ass preceptor for new-grad orientation and a culture of safety is #1 fuck everything else it does not matter."
nursing,3cuqcf,MaK_Ultra,3,Sat Jul 11 11:34:56 2015 UTC,New nurse here. Why is 5mg=5ml not the equivalent of 1mg/ml?  This was never brought up in any training in school or after.
nursing,3cuqcf,imanedrn,2,Sat Jul 11 14:07:57 2015 UTC,"1mg/1ml and 5mg/5ml would be the same, no?  Maybe I'm just missing what you're trying to say?"
nursing,3cuqcf,cjs92587,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:05:23 2015 UTC,No meter marks to calculate a partial dose.
nursing,3cuqcf,hazelquarrier_couch,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:17:33 2015 UTC,Oh... so they were giving 5x the actual prescribed dose?  Damn...
nursing,3cuqcf,DeLaNope,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:32:53 2015 UTC,"No not really. They weren't giving the partial dose as ordered.  What happens is this: you get in the habit of grabbing the say yellow 40mg dose and give the whole thing. Then you get an order for say 34mg and the yellow unmetered yellow syringe pops out of the pyxis, and give the entire dose out of habit. When really, you needed a 50mg syringe or two 30mg metered syringes to give the correct dose.  Never seen a bad outcome but it probably can cause problems in a lawsuit."

nursing,3cws4z,BrooklynRN,6,Sat Jul 11 14:17:28 2015 UTC,That is VERY low for NYC - HHC starts out at $67K and the private hospitals in the high seventies/low eighties. Even private practice and SNFs usually offer quite a bit higher than that... Are you ASN or BSN? That might be why - BSNs can usually command the hospital jobs that pay better. It's hard here for those w/ an ASN.

nursing,3cws4z,haanalisk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:51:54 2015 UTC,I do 5 8s on nights and I like it plenty. You get a set schedule that way and do less bouncing back and forth between sleeping during the day or at night (I've actually taken a course on biological clocks and keeping a consistent schedule is one of the best things for shift workers). I would probably have a harder time with 4 days off and switching my schedule all the time.

I'm from Alberta though where I worked for 5 years and  full time was 84/2 weeks (7 shifts per pay period) so basically an extra shift in a 2 week period. But I remember we had to do a similarly D/N rotation, I didn't hate it because then I didn't have to do all nights. But here in the U.S. I got lucky and snagged straight days for the last 5 years. Here it seems to be you either work straight days or nights and a few people work a variable rotation. And self scheduling is becoming more common too which is nice. It actually works out fairly well believe it or not!"

nursing,3cws4z,ENRN,6,Sun Jul 12 18:15:16 2015 UTC,Doesn't make that much of a difference - days off in this game is what you need. Especially on night shifts.

nursing,3cws4z,haanalisk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:14:04 2015 UTC,"I work nights, 5 8s and vehemently disagree with that statement. Sticking with a set and consistent schedule is much easier to sleep soundly during the day, every day. Weekends get a little weird but I've figured them out for myself. I did take a course on biological clocks in my first undergrad and our discussions and learning strongly supports what I'm saying about staying on a consistent schedule for a shift worker."
nursing,3cws4z,grooviegurl,6,Sun Jul 12 17:31:18 2015 UTC,"Are the shifts 8 or 12 hours long? What's the hourly wage they're talking about?  Unless you're getting benefits from a husband/partner, you need to opt into getting them. You need health insurance and a retirement fund. NEED."

I think the money is decent for the area (I'm from there myself) considering you're brand new and it's not a hospital.  I don't quite get the thing about benefits, is that the net after they deduct your share of benefits?  I dunno.    But yea, don't fall into the trap of 'it's night time, they'll all just be sleeping.'  I worked a night shift last night at my place where I normally do days, and man.  We had a guy they just extubated and all night he was climbing out of bed despite IV Ativan.  Did not sleep a wink.  All it takes is one pt sometimes."

nursing,3cws4z,Doublev957,3,Sat Jul 11 21:43:38 2015 UTC,Working 5 nights a week is awful and I will never do it again unless I  have no other choice. IMHO they should be paying at least 70k with benefits for you to work such shitty hours.

nursing,3cws4z,Rednights,3,Sat Jul 11 14:42:07 2015 UTC,$30/hr minimum with benefits in NJ imo.
nursing,3cws4z,auraseer,7,Sat Jul 11 17:26:16 2015 UTC,"How long are your shifts? Five days of 8-hour shifts is doable. If they're five 12-hour shifts, that's too much work in one week.   Benefits are important. To compare this to the salary with benefits, you'd need to figure out the cost for buying your own health and dental insurance, plus a deposit into a retirement account, plus the hassle of dealing with all that stuff yourself. I can't tell you if all your expenses will add up to more than the difference, so I'll work from the smaller number.   Assuming 8-hour shifts, 53k/yr works out to about $25/hour. That's on the low side for most parts of the country, especially for night shift. But long-term care tends to pay less than hospital work, so it's not unreasonable. It could be fine depending on where you are located.   An important question to ask yourself is whether you can live on that amount in your city."
nursing,3cws4z,grooviegurl,4,Sat Jul 11 13:58:30 2015 UTC,"It's also important to consider that (in my experience, where I've lived in the past) it can be really hard for a new grad to get into a hospital. However, if you can do ~1 year in a rehab/sub-acute facility, it's super easy to get into hospitals after that because you have the ""minimum 1-3 years of experience"" so many places require."

Except you usually hear about it the other way around when people decide to go per diem and get a few extra dollars an hour.  15k loss for benefits is pretty reasonable, especially if they are semi-decent and you get at least a few weeks of vacation time.

nursing,3cws4z,meagain716,3,Sat Jul 11 19:40:50 2015 UTC,"It's a great deal if you have medical benefits from another source (spouse, retirement, whatever), but otherwise usually a losing proposition."

nursing,3cws4z,MsConstrued,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:18:28 2015 UTC,Do you get a shift differential? Don't forgo all benefits and not get vacation/sick time!
nursing,3cws4z,antisocialoctopus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"That is too low for your area/field. Also if there's no benefits then you're technically PRN and you should be making significantly higher than the base rate. Anyone working over 30 hours a week is required to be offered benefits unless they waive them for a higher rate...where I am on the west coast it's 10% of the salary higher.   If it was 68k with benefits I'd say yes. Without it should be even higher. They're taking advantage of you as a new grad. Keep looking. A similar place will absolutely hire you, look for fair compensation. Do not take the first offer out of the gate. I'm only 2.5 years an ASN (from LPN that has worked in similar places) and I learned this the hard way."
nursing,3cws4z,Generoh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:02:39 2015 UTC,"I think you really need to look at what you need to get by in your area and see if that meets your requirements. I don't know how many of us can speak to the job market for ASN nurses in your area. They're pretty grim in my area, and folks wind up having to take what they can get. If you think you can do better and feel pretty confident about that, turn it down. If you're not sure, taking it and continuing to look might be a good idea.  Either way, I'd look at it from the $53k pay scale. Not having benefits is a very poor decision in any sort of long term scenario, unless you're getting them from a spouse."

Once she graduates and gets her degree she can actually practice as a nurse.

A couple things that we did that helped (not sure if they are of any help to you) -When the kids were checked in, we always went over everything with the parents. Before we would rely on previously filled out paper work, but after a couple kids that came in with a bag of pills and no instructions we stopped that. Even if the bottle said how to take it we did a med consolidation with the family. It didn't take that long but saved a lot of hassle.  -For children identification I always asked their name just so I could make sure I give them the right pills. The kids new to expect that so it wasnt weird.    When we organized the medication they were in individual bags labelled and put  in the cupboard. The whole room was locked (Pretty well all of the kids we took care of were on a controlled substance). We didn't count them. And we only let one person in the health center at a time, or two if both I and the nurse were in.    -As far as the MARs...We remade the sheets that were provided to us to decrease errors. Before you had to fill out the med and the name every time,.. our MARs made it so we just had to put the time and sign. And each MAR had one patients name and one med. Me and the other nurse rotated or worked together, so every time I was on, after am/hs round of meds I would go through my MARs and make sure everything matched up. If a medication wasn't given, ie the camper didn't come/refused, a note was made.   Ultimately, I think our biggest thing was that we had to figure out where our weak points were and we had huddles to make the system better.  I was in Ontario going about all this, so we reviewed ontario camp nurse medication administration guidelines. I wonder if there is some time of resources/policies that you could review? The organization must have something, and if not maybe call up similar organizations and see how they do things."

Luckily I was fine, it was a tiny homeless 40yo f.   I was upset but the part that made it all okay was how amazing staff was. People were hugging me and stayed by my side until I stopped crying. All my managers got involved. Called the police got her arrested. They made sure I was seen by employe health and sent me home. They called me everyday until I worked again. That made all the difference. I will never forget what having these people support me felt like.  I can't imagine having been so upset and scared with no one who cared."

nursing,3cqzk8,amberliin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:11:55 2015 UTC,"I received some crisis prevention and intervention training at my hospital last year. I'm a guy with short hair but we practiced a scenario in which your hair is grabbed by someone.   In the event that this happens, grab the attackers hands and push in at the knuckles where the finger joint attaches at the palm. While you do this, push your head into it and try to dislodge their hands from your hair.   The knee-jerk reaction is to pull away when someone grabs your hair but you have to fight this reflex as it will only cause them to grab harder.   It also helps to shout loudly as it can startle the patient (giving you a small window to react) and alert your coworkers to help you."

I don't think many of them take their jobs very seriously. I had a psyche patient last week and after I spoke to him to get his triage info, I started to leave the area and told security ""Keep your eyes on him. I have a feeling he's going to snap."" The guard chuckled at me as if I'm paranoid and naiive, and he sarcastically said ""Ok."" Less than two minutes later, the patient flipped out and attacked the security guard. What a surprise. I've worked at four hospitals as a traveler and have found this to be a common attitude among security. It's frustrating."

Then I... volunteered to help (running away won't do me any good!), and a tech introduced me to peppermint oil.  I couldn't believe how well the peppermint oil (a couple drops under the nostrils) helped.

Therefore, you have to get them a little baggy so you have room to move. With the dickies Youtility, they still feel like scrubs, but they do stretch a bit. Difficult to explain. Just buy a pair off amazon and try them out."

I wear them as a female occasionally but I haven't bought a new set for my new colors. I would buy them when they are 30-40% off.   Carhartt scrubs look nice on guys. I've considered trying out the female versions.   Jockey scrubs are great for females! These are my standard issue. However, I don't think I have ever seen males wear them but they do make male versions. All my pants have lasted a long time with an exception of one pair that seemed to be unusually thin. The other ones I have bought since then have been great. I don't know if they were testing out new material or what."

nursing,3crxyf,Seawhales13,16,Fri Jul 10 07:52:27 2015 UTC,"If I could ever find a job that was 3-11 again I would jump on it immediately. What I liked about it was the ability to never use an alarm clock. I could get home, get to sleep by maybe 1 am and then get up by 10 am and do whatever for a good 4-5 hours.... it was the best time in my life."
nursing,3crxyf,oncewoken,8,Fri Jul 10 15:45:19 2015 UTC,"I loved 3-11 and worked that shift for a while before I got married.  It was awesome because I'm not a morning person and though it did at times make social stuff hard I hung out with my friends who were my ""day shift"" people on my days off and could go out with my co-workers and party a little bit when my shift was over.  I had some unusually awesome and hilarious co-workers at the time. If in some alternate universe, I was still single...I'd totally still be doing 3-11.  You can find a lot of people out there who work a 3-11'ish shift which can make your social life pretty fun.  Another note is that I too had an awful time with 7PM-7AM.  Like a straight up overnight shift.  It really screwed with my sleep schedule and overall my body's ability to function.  3-11 is a lot closer to normal and I was actually able to sleep like a normal person and not feel like a zombie when I was on that shift."

nursing,3crxyf,hilfin,3,Sun Jul 12 12:16:18 2015 UTC,"I'm basically going to reiterate what everyone has said, however, I've had a year and a half experience with days and evenings. Day shift is great because you work when everyone else in  the world does. You get out and can still do something fun. However, you may be totally pooped and not want to do anything. You still have the option though. 3-11 is great because you can run errands, wake up refreshed, do your thing and go to work. You can even grab some dranks and get funky with your co- workers after. However.....no one else is around in the morning. You're body will love you, you're social life not so much. I do suggest trying it out!"
nursing,3crxyf,Generoh,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:42:56 2015 UTC,3-11 shift is the best for work life. Not so much for social life if a lot of your friends have 9-5 jobs

nursing,3crxyf,ENRN,4,Fri Jul 10 23:20:43 2015 UTC,It did for me - but mainly as it made daycare/family life easy. If you are single/dating/going out it may be a lot more difficult.

nursing,3crxyf,outrunningzombies,2,Fri Jul 10 12:49:26 2015 UTC,I work 4 p-2a (mostly). I miss my husband but can see him on my days off or before work on the weekend. I like alone time and would go a bit crazy if I worked the same hours as him.   I worked 11a-11p for awhile and that was really good. A lot of my friends were night owls and would get dinner with me after work. We also lived in a big enough city that we could actually go out at midnight.
nursing,3crxyf,Pikkusika,2,Fri Jul 10 23:54:02 2015 UTC,"I love 3-11. Some hospitals have odd 12 hour shifts, working 11-11 or 3-3. People who I've talked to working either of these odd shifts enjoyed them."

I'm off in the mornings when no one else is so I'm always alone because my friends and fiancé work 9-5 jobs.  I get home at midnight and my fiancé is always in bed.  My friends go out at night and I usually can't join them because I'll be at work.  Holidays suck because I don't have enough time to drive to my family and get back in time for work.  However, a lot of people love 3-11.  The things I enjoy about 3-11 are the fast paced environment, my coworkers are generally the most outgoing of the three shifts and it's nice to sleep in.  But I'm switching to days starting Monday and I look forward to being home every night with my fiancé and being able to go out Friday and Saturday nights even if I have work."
nursing,3crxyf,rockrobot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:34:08 2015 UTC,"I had a very similar experience with second shift.  I felt like the only time I ever spent with my wife was when she was asleep and I was in bed reading.  I missed a lot of holidays and time with friends.  I also hated the experience of waking up hours early and having my shift hanging over me.  I'd rather just wake up, wash up, and get at it.  I made the transition to days and have loved it.  Typically I either do 3 12's or 4 8's a week all starting at 7A.  While I am working pretty much the same amount of hours as before I feel like my free time has increased dramatically.  I think it's because I get to interact with humans I care about outside of the hospital much more often.  Although, my bank account does miss that evening differential."
nursing,3crxyf,TheToiletStore6,2,Fri Jul 10 19:54:35 2015 UTC,You hit it right on the head.  That's exactly how I feel.

You get to sleep in and still get to enjoy the best parts of the day, and then end your day with work.   Lots of part-timers at my hospital do this shift because it works with their spouses to allow them to take care of their families by splitting the days.   If you still want to make brunch or lunch plans, you can. The only downside is that my job has a tendency to make me work evenings nearly every Friday of my schedule since that's an unpopular time for that shift. But it's still sooo much better than waking up at 5:30 every day."

When I'm on evenings, I like being able to sleep in. I rarely see my friends when I'm on a stretch of evenings though.

The worst part is that you feel like your entire life is spent at the hospital. I'm married with no children. I felt like I never saw my husband because he worked and had class in the morning when I was still sleeping, and was often in bed by the time I got home. My friends all worked day shift jobs and I could never make it to impromptu outings or fun plans. I only had every other weekend off, so I was out for 50% of in prime-time hang-out hours. It pretty much killed my social life. Plus, I rarely got out on time due to the busyness of the shift. Having the most admissions and discharges in the day really sucked for charting.  I will say that the camaraderie I had with my others nurses on the shift was great, and made it hard to leave. It was also a good shift to work for someone needing experience, as it was much busier than nights and you see A LOT of different things. I also enjoyed sleeping in without the alarm clock.  Working 7p-7a has been way better. I'm part time now so I have a 7 day stretch off, and only work 5 days in a 2 week period. I pick up shifts still, but I see my family and friends more often."

It's also tough on your social life, because you can't hang out in the morning before work but get home too late to see anyone after work. You also have to work at least 4 days a week if not 5.

My Cherokee scrub tops for school look and feel like I am wearing a poncho. Even though they are sized correctly the waist area feels real wide and baggy.

nursing,3cq9k7,wizbot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:34:49 2015 UTC,i've tried carhartt and didn't like them for the same reason you stated. Material is too thick and tough and I'd probably sweat my ass off. Plus the weird stitching pattern on them makes it difficult to mix and match with different pants and shirts. The koi's are a little bit thicker material than landau but if you're looking for some scrubs that won't make you look like you're wearing maternity clothes then I strongly suggest them. They are made for guys who are more athletic so you aren't gonna have the puffing out near the waist that most other mens scrubs have.

I kind of stopped reading too when the author started getting into fetal tissue as fuel (???), but otherwise it was a really cool story.  Thanks for posting it OP.  My son was in the NICU for 5 weeks after he was born and I always thought that those incubators were amazing.  The nurses and doctors who cared for him were even more awesome but I felt a particular sense of gratitude to my son's incubator as a kind of surrogate for what my own my body couldn't provide him.  I really admire Dr.Couney for being so bold and persistent....it's like he knew with absolute certainty that his mission in life was to get these incubators out there and that he couldn't fail because of how much depended on it.  It's pretty awesome when people just know what they're meant to do and despite the crap that people throw at them, they just do the good they were meant to do anyways.  Rock."

nursing,3cuyf0,CCurves,21,Sat Jul 11 00:02:39 2015 UTC,"If you can't be supportive of your wife's life goals implicitly, you're headed for a failed marriage. Your expectations of both parents being home for dinner don't leave any room for negotiation.  You have much grander problems than shift work."
nursing,3cuyf0,Roki-B,-8,Sat Jul 11 01:52:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input, but I don't think its as black and white as that.  Its hard to read what you have written with out it sounding like I should just accept it or I'm the cause of a marriage failure.    Given that I have spent the last 15 years as a sole provider so that we could have a full time person at home ( our shared life goal ) it surprised me to see her choose a career that isn't family focused.   She was a teacher i.e 12 weeks off/ year when the kids are off.  I would love to have that opportunity.   This thread isn't about bashing her or her choices, I just want to understand more about what I'm up for."
nursing,3cuyf0,Roki-B,7,Sat Jul 11 02:07:52 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Maybe have a conversation about what her goal for being a nurse is, and what kind of sacrifices she expects of herself and of her family.  That being said, you work 3 night shift in a row you get four days off. That first day off can be rough if you switch back to being a daywalker but easy enough to be up by dinner.   Working three days a week equates to a total of 29.7 weeks off a year, though not contiguous. Compare that with the 23.4 weeks off a year (assuming 2 weekend days + 12 weeks summer per year). That, if my math is correct, comes out to about an extra full 44 days a year with the family.  Working three day shifts will give a solid four days off a week to be home with you and the kids.  Ultimately she's likely gaining more time with you and the family with the sacrifice of being gone as hell for three days out of every week. Its more unbalanced but she's going to be around more than she was previously averaged over an entire week.   I don't think you're going to have much of a problem. My advice is to play it by ear as it begins and make adjustments as necessary. Nothing, including her schedule, is going to be predictable. Time to be really flexible. On the long run though I think your family will likely come out with more time together than with her as a teacher.  Edit: This is USA nursing schedule standard. YMMV."
nursing,3cuyf0,jp611,2,Sat Jul 11 02:17:56 2015 UTC,Thankyou that was very helpful and informative.  Im sure we will adjust :)
nursing,3cuyf0,SaucyChicken,6,Sat Jul 11 02:33:53 2015 UTC,"You're not her, and you sound very unreasonable about what she wants to do.  Ever stop and think that maybe you're being a little too controlling?  It sounds like she chose a career she wants to do and you're being rude about it.  Being a nurse doesn't mean you're away from home more.  She may not be at the dinner table 7 nights a week, but if she works 12 hour shifts she will have 3-4 days at home rather then 2 on the weekend.  It almost sounds as if you're upset that she won't be home to have dinner ready.  Put on your big boy pants and make a meal a few nights a week for the kids."
nursing,3cuyf0,perrla,-7,Sat Jul 11 02:16:54 2015 UTC,"A marriage & family is not about what you want to do.  If it was I would have gone and followed my own dream and expected her to follow.  I currently cook 2-3 times a week, dishes more than that,  do all the sweeping and mopping, the yard work, renovation work, keep the cars alive one more time.  She sleeps in most days and I play with etc the kids.  I'm ok to do all that thou.  I'm not trying to be rude to her, she has damn near always gotten what she wants.  I love her very much and want her to be happy in her career.  No one wants to have a ""job"" that the only reason you do it is the pay.  I'm excited about her passion, it just sux that it comes with a cost to our family. Because I'm not happy with the cost I'm the bad guy?  I'm just trying to wrap my head around what to expect."
nursing,3cuyf0,MaK_Ultra,2,Sat Jul 11 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"Don't worry buddy. I'm not sure why people are down voting you when you're genuinely trying to understand something about nursing. I think people are coming to conclusions about your marriage based on some of your concerns being a little misogynistic. Only you guys know the actual details of your family unit. You should probably talk to her about what she wants out of it. Nursing can be very variable and can definitely be a great profession for someone who is family oriented. Keep supporting her though, nursing school is tough, and it's invaluable to have a loved ones support through such a emotionally tumultuous program and profession."
nursing,3cuyf0,MaK_Ultra,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:32:07 2015 UTC,"Thankyou , our marriage is traditional in a number of ways, and somehow nowadays that is seen as misogynistic and sexist.  She wants to get out of nursing all the things that everyone her has discussed, rewarding, varied, challenging etc, and I cant blame her for not wanting to try and teach teenagers.  I do feel that I can support her and her choice and still not like shift work thou :)"
nursing,3cuyf0,Hashtaglibertarian,11,Tue Jul 14 05:19:49 2015 UTC,"It blows me away that she is 2/3 done with her program and you are now just bringing this up / become aware of it?  Seriously? If my partner wanted to pursue a new career I would research it and look into it and talk about it BEFORE they started.   I also have absolutely no idea how you didn't know a nurse would be doing shift work. Sorry, hospital's closed, it's 6pm. :-/  And all the stuff about cooking, cleaning, letting her sleep, etc. sounds like you have a lot of resentment toward her."
nursing,3cuyf0,Thighvenger,-6,Sat Jul 11 05:04:28 2015 UTC,"I get that I probably should have known before hand.  I found out that she would be doing shift work about 12mths ago.  I know that hospitals open 24h, but my local gp has nurses and isn't open passed 6pm   Perhaps you are correct about me being resentful towards her.  We have a different level of acceptable clean for the house and I often feel that I'm the only one doing it.  It is a concern that with shift work that will be confirmed"

nursing,3cuyf0,perrla,6,Sat Jul 11 09:33:08 2015 UTC,1) I second counseling.   2) yeah she may need experience as a floor nurse for a few years (usually 2 in the states) but there's a ton of other nursing jobs out there that are normal working schedule. It depends what your wife's ultimate goals are though too - maybe she wants to do shift work. That's really up to you guys.
nursing,3cuyf0,juicyjubilee,-4,Sat Jul 11 00:25:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I'm not sure what counseling could achieve, I either accept this or be grumpy about it I guess.  Ultimately she would like to be a midwife.  Are there 9-5 style jobs in that area?"

nursing,3cuyf0,Amymars,2,Tue Jul 14 19:41:55 2015 UTC,"I can't say for Australia. I know in our area the midwives do generally work better hours (at least at two of our local hospitals that I've worked at). At our hospitals they don't do overnights and usually are out by 1800 (6:00 p.m.). One of the nurses I worked with in the ER was  a midwife and then left because the pay was really poor and she got burned out with all the drug addicted babies we see in our area. She came to the ER - did two years - and just went back to midwifery. She is doing office/clinic work only though in her new position and doesn't actually deliver babies anymore - I guess there's two midwives at the hospital and two in the office of the new practice she started with.   Counseling can help you sort out your issues though and can make it so she can see it from your side and you can see things from her side. Have you ever written down on a piece of paper what it would be like being married to yourself? Or has she ever told you what her dreams are and why? Perhaps there's a compromise to be worked out - counseling can help with that.   Also in the states a LOT of nurses do 12 hour shifts and only work 3 days a week. So even IF she's doing shift work is 3 days a week really worth it to put anger/hostility into your marriage if it's something that is truly fulfilling and hopeful to her? That's only something you can answer though. I really do wish you the best of luck. It is NOT an easy journey, and during nursing school that will also test your marriage. Her entire life is going to be nursing. She will need to study for hours on end, stay up late, get up early, etc. She can't get through that alone without your support - or she can but she really shouldn't. Life is hard enough - you have to decide how to approach this obstacle/mountain climb."

I cannot fathom how the hell she made it this far in her nursing program without you comprehending that there may be shift work involved. For goodness sakes, placements start after first semester in most programs! Nurses are kinda notorious for doing shift work.   That aside, two points. You could make shift work actually work in your favour. 3 12s in an ICU makes for a lot of days off. Alternatively, she could work in loads of areas that are waaaay more family friendly. Dialysis is mostly a day time job. GP nursing. School nursing. PACU, or theatre nursing. But I dunno why you are asking us. Ask her what she wants to do. She has loads of options, but you losing your shit on the internet and bitching about our profession probably won't get you far."

nursing,3cuyf0,lurkerRN,0,Sun Jul 12 02:42:53 2015 UTC,"That is really quite unfair.  If you reread up the top I'm not stopping her from doing this, its quite the opposite actually.  Taking 2-3years off earning an income is not something that we had intended.  I'm working 2 jobs to support her while she goes to uni.  I'm glad she has found something that she is passionate about,  I was simply asking what to expect.  Also problems for 'me' is also a problem for her, same as a problem for her is my problem too.  Thats what a marriage is about."
nursing,3cuyf0,lurkerRN,3,Sun Jul 12 06:55:26 2015 UTC,"I am a nurse in Australia. Your wife will most probably have to do a grad program to start with which takes a year (if she wants to do hospital nursing) all grad programs i know of require shift work for the duration of the program. Most hospitals will want to hire a nurse who is flexible and can do shift work, so unless she is, it will be a lot harder to get a job. Maybe she could eventually do night duties after her graduate program? That way she could still be home when the kids get home from school and for dinner. Regardless of what happens, in my opinion if nursing is her dream career you should compromise with your preferences and support her."
nursing,3cuyf0,lurkerRN,-3,Sat Jul 11 01:14:38 2015 UTC,"Thank-you for your information, I'm sure we will find a compromise that will suit us, honestly thou I cant fathom why someone would choose a hard, shift work job over teaching and having so much more time with their family"
nursing,3cuyf0,mfwater,3,Sat Jul 11 02:17:59 2015 UTC,"honestly thou I cant fathom why someone would choose a hard, shift work job over teaching and having so much more time with their family   Well gee, good thing you're the one getting the nursing degree then!  Have you talked to her about why she went into nursing? I don't know your marriage, but it sounds like there's been a serious lack of communication over a very big issue (change of career). The fact that she got 2/3rds through school without you realizing night shift work would be involved is telling.   Maybe she's sick of teaching. Maybe she wants to earn more money as an RN (and hospital RNs generally earn much more than RNs who work at doctor's offices). Maybe she wants to work set hours rather than filling in as a substitute teacher. We don't know, and from the looks of it, you don't either.   Not to mention that night shift positions generally pay better than day shift, getting day shift straight out of school is very rare, and night shift is generally better for a new nurse than days. Night shift (usually) gives the new grad more time to learn how the hospital works, how to manage time, how to handle everything the hospital throws at her. Day shift for a new grad can be overwhelmingly stressful, especially from someone who's not used to working in a hospital. Nights will allow her to ease into her new profession, until she gains more experience and can go for a day shift position."
nursing,3cuyf0,aj0220,2,Sat Jul 11 14:22:47 2015 UTC,Maybe she wants some new challenges? Nursing is very fulfilling and many people balance it with raising a family quite well. Good luck with everything :)

I take Lexapro and I know that when I don't take it for a couple of days, I feel like crap.  Her baby is all good now, by the way! Just wondering if this is a common thing?

Doing the 7on7off thing makes it feel like you never leave the hospital.   What I hate? I work 7p-7a. The 8hr shifts are 7a-3p, 3p-11p, and 11p-7a. Unless I give report to one of the few other 12hr people when I get off at 7a, chances are I'll have totally different patients the next night because when 7-3 RN gets off, they give report to a 3-11 RN and we don't switch assignments mid-shift."

I make 120k as an RT, most of the RN's make 145k (we also get like 50% of it taxed away, so don't go getting your resumes ready just yet!), and the physicians 250k+, and yet most of us live either 40+ miles away or live in a shitty one bedroom dumpster-fire. There are some nurses I work with who actually live on the other side of the country and fly in for work and stay in a hotel.   After 12 hours of crazy having to drive an hour home without swerving off the freeway is a nightmare. I'd give my left nut to only work 8 and be able to get a full night's rest.

nursing,3cqb81,StefaniePags,4,Sun Jul 12 13:13:13 2015 UTC,I work 8 hour shifts for the last 10 years in ancillary positions in the hospital. I definitely don't want to go back. I love the 12s.
nursing,3cqb81,entfromhoth,2,Thu Jul 9 22:58:46 2015 UTC,I got into nursing for 12 hour days. I could never see myself working 5 days a week as a mandatory thing. pay me overtime? sure. i like having a life though.
nursing,3cqb81,jennafezz,2,Fri Jul 10 02:23:07 2015 UTC,"I love 12s. In my hospital, ED/ICU/tele work 12s but med surg works 8s. They are scheduled 4 days a week, 64 hours a pay period. I guess they like it because it happened due to a unit vote. I think more shift reports equals poorer continuity of care. There's a lot of hospitals here in the Bay Area that are switching to 8s for everyone, even ICU/ED. It makes me figure it must be cheaper or else the hospitals wouldn't push for it, but I don't really understand how because they need more staff members for three shifts and therefore pay more in benefits. Also the 8s stay over to 12s so often anyway and then they get OT from 8-12hrs since they aren't 12 hr employees. I don't get it."
nursing,3cqb81,pandahat79,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:02:30 2015 UTC,"I'd love 8 hour shifts   12s cause me (as I'm sure they do most of us) to be sleep-deprived, etc...I know a lot of errors happen on 12s too   I know it's better for the pts (continuity of care) but I like to take care of myself too :/"

nursing,3cqt3w,averaged00d,9,Fri Jul 10 01:02:48 2015 UTC,"Fill out paperwork and throw some cash at it. Pretty easy usually. There's also the NLC which works for like 20 different states. This is all pretty easy to google, so....you should probably do that."
nursing,3cqt3w,AnalWhisperer,3,Fri Jul 10 02:15:00 2015 UTC,"Just apply for a license in the state you want to work in instead of where you're currently located.  Unless you plan on applying for jobs in the state you currently live in, in which case you can get a license in another state by endorsement after passing the NCLEX and getting licensed in whatever state you pick initially."
nursing,3cqt3w,justatouchcrazy,2,Fri Jul 10 01:18:11 2015 UTC,"So basically, just pass my NCLEX in my home state and then apply for  a license in the state I would like to apply to hospitals in?"
nursing,3cqt3w,justatouchcrazy,2,Fri Jul 10 03:32:27 2015 UTC,"That's one way to do it.  However, the NCLEX is the same test regardless of the state you went to school in, test in or apply for a license in.  So say you want to work in Ohio and only want to apply to jobs there, but go to school and live in Alabama.  You don't have to apply for a license in Alabama, just apply by examination in Ohio, get their approval and then take the NCLEX.  You can even take the NCLEX in Alabama (or any other state).  The only downside to applying for a first-time license by exam in a state that you didn't go to school in is that it may take a little extra time for the state to confirm you graduated.  This might happen because they have to contact your school first instead of automatically getting a list of graduating students like the state you go to school in might.  TL;DR: If you don't want to work in the state you're going to school in don't even bother applying for a license or paying the state BON anything.  Just apply to your desired state from the get-go."
nursing,3cqt3w,kelseykelsey4,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:43:53 2015 UTC,"Some states have a quick turn around and some don't . I know California takes a notoriously long time to get ATTs so depending on which state it is, it might be faster to apply to the state you would like to apply to jobs in."

nursing,3cqt3w,apeleggedman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:20:34 2015 UTC,"Yes. I took the NCLEX in one state (due to earlier availability), graduated from nursing school in another state, and applied for my license in yet another state. The only thing that matters is WHERE you are going to be applying for jobs.  Don't waste your time getting licensed in your current state, if you know that you will be working in another."
nursing,3cqt3w,justatouchcrazy,2,Fri Jul 10 03:37:08 2015 UTC,"The quickest way I can tell someone doesn't know they are talking about is when they tell any story that involves ""Well I took the NCLEX in X state, and they do XYZ to make it harder/more comprehensive/has a higher passing requirement.""

nursing,3cooz9,hypnopaedias,20,Thu Jul 9 15:26:45 2015 UTC,"The money is bonkers. Unless you currently work in CA or other high paying states/cities, expect to nearly double or more than double your income.   The jobs are generally not glamorous. Without much exception, you will not be working in nice, big teaching hospitals. There's a reason a hospital needs travelers and it isn't because they're doing a great job with employee satisfaction, staffing levels, or staff experience. You will also get shitty assignments. There's two experiences most travelers have: you get insanely unfair assignments with an unsafe workload, or you babysit low acuity patients for 13 weeks. You are the unit's bitch, and are compensated accordingly. I would not suggest doing traveling as tele or floor nurse unless you want to go to a state or facility which has mandatory nurse:pt ratios.  The perks are insane. You can add things into your contract such as not getting floated, not working 3 or more days in a row, not taking student nurses: whatever you want. You can work out bonuses for just about anything, and the overtime pay is absurd. A woman I work with works 6 months a year and then takes 6 months off, because financially, she can.  I have enjoyed my time as a traveler, and if I weren't moving away from the bedside I would probably do this permanently."

nursing,3cooz9,entfromhoth,11,Fri Jul 10 02:13:17 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. It's rad. There's usually two ways this goes, though. Either you get shit on, both by patients and nurses, or you get a baller fucking job where it feels like you're robbing a goddamn bank.   No doubt, you have to be in your game. Be smart. Don't fuck up. Learn all their policies. Basically, if there was ever gonna be a nurse of the month, be that nurse 3 months in a row. They want you to do your own blood sugars? Shit yeah, I'll do it. They want you to do your own vitals? AND I'll do it with a manual cuff. They want you to watch the tele monitors? ""Yo, I think your patient may be having some A. Fib. I flipped through the chart and saw there wasn't anything. So, I called the doctor for you and got some orders, too. I already gave the meds, though, so don't worry about it."" And when they ask you how you did it without leaving the tele monitor, you act like a boss and shrug your shoulders. They want super nurse. Well... Super nurse here now.   I managed to end up in an outpatient clinic in oncology as my final contract. Which leads me to next thing. If, for whatever reason, the job you do ends up being awesome, you can consider asking to make the position permanent. Yeah, you'll make less money, but this is a good entry way into an otherwise difficult to get job.   It's not for everyone. You have to be quick to learn things and have a lot of patience. You're basically walking into an established group of people, trying to be like one of them, even though you're not.   Also... A good recruiter and contact at your agency is SO KEY. I ended up with a different recruiter and a lower paying contract, only because they treated me with respect. They make a huge difference."

nursing,3cooz9,kahiggins84,3,Fri Jul 10 05:44:20 2015 UTC,"I'm originally from Ohio and I'm finishing up my second contract in California (one in the desert, one in LA), heading to San Francisco at the end of this month. My background is ER and SICU, but I'm only traveling ICU. My first contract was in a community MICU. My current contract in LA is at a Level 1 SICU.  Probably my biggest piece of advise is: UNDERSTAND THE STATUS OF YOUR TAX HOME. I had multiple recruiters from different companies incorrectly explain this. Consult a tax accountant who specializes in travel nursing. You will probably not make much money if you don't have a tax home. If you claim a false tax home (like your parents' house as one recruiter suggested to me) you could get fined so much money. I can't tell you the number of travel nurses I meet who have no understanding of a tax home. Hopefully they never get audited.  PROS: 1. You can make bank. This all depends on how you negotiate your contract. Cool cities pay less. Academic trauma centers pay less. You have to pick your priorities. 2. It's super interesting to see how hospitals do things differently. What works, what doesn't. 3. For me, it's a great way to find a city and/or hospital to ""settle down"" for a little bit. 4. Awesome way to learn how nursing differs state to state. Scope of practice is different. This is also a con because you have to know your scope; I've definitely lost autonomy moving from Ohio to California.  CONS 1. Recruiters will try to jerk you around. It is in their company's best interest to pay you less. You really have to be comfortable being aggressive about pay and negotiation. I definitely got screwed on my very first contract. I'm getting smarter. 2. It can be tough to make new friends and learn your way around a new city every 3 months. At times it's been a bit lonely. Some places the nurses are clique-y (I've found there to be a lot of racial tension between nurses in California). 3. Learning new computer systems. Ugh. Never thought I'd miss EPIC. 4. Just because you're new and only got one day of orientation is not an excuse for not knowing all the hospital policies and procedures. 5. Less schedule control. You have no seniority. You're there to fill in the holes."

nursing,3cooz9,Murphey14,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:00:42 2015 UTC,No there is no restriction but for any travel contract you HAVE to be paying rent to someone and they have to be claiming it as rental income on their taxes. If you get audited and you are accepting the free housing or housing stipend and are not paying rent back home or are just giving money to a family member/friend and calling it rent you can kiss all your money goodbye with the penalties from the IRS.
nursing,3cooz9,MsConstrued,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:48:43 2015 UTC,Even if you decide to pay taxes on it? I've heard of so many people pocketing at least some of the rent stipend by finding a cheaper place than the stipend amount.
nursing,3cooz9,Ellie-fied,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:59:17 2015 UTC,If you pay taxes on it by not claiming tax-free status then it's okay but then there is not much incentive to travel since the pay rate will be about equal.

nursing,3cooz9,babylove8,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:05:28 2015 UTC,"The reason you are provided tax free stipends (housing, a ""per diem"" or meal stipend, and sometimes mileage) is because you are supposed to be maintaining a taxed home elsewhere."
nursing,3cooz9,katherine_rf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:29:42 2015 UTC,"But, if I live with someone and do pay taxes, just not rent, wouldn't that also count?"
nursing,3cooz9,babylove8,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:32:30 2015 UTC,Travel nurse pay packages are broken down into an hourly rate (which is taxed) and your housing stipend (which is not taxed). You get a tax break on the housing stipend assuming you are paying money to maintain a permanent home and your travel home. It's supposed to make up the difference for having to pay for two housing costs. So you need to have a mortgage or rent.  You will always pay taxes while traveling on your hourly rates. The question is will your housing stipend be taxed? Maintaining two homes (two rents or mortgages) = tax free housing stipend.
nursing,3cooz9,katherine_rf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:06:11 2015 UTC,Then you don't have a tax home and don't qualify for the tax-free housing. You have to pay taxes on the income/stipend. You can research tax home. Pantravelers.org is the association we belong to that has answers to all the questions pertaining to this.
nursing,3cooz9,MsConstrued,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:52:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about not paying rent, but I used to work with a travel nurse that grew up in the area I was working...

nursing,3cooz9,siraph,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:50:33 2015 UTC,"The assignments can be a little heavier than if you were a staff nurse, but no different than a hospital hired per diem employee. The money is great, and when you get a better feel for it, you can manipulate your contract and add virtually anything you want. As long as both sides sign, you'll have no issues. I currently do contract nursing as my per diem job currently. I left it full time because the benefits are poor. I would not recommend it as a job for a newer nurse."

I input all the clinical data... and once saw a BNP of 199,000 (and some change).  We double checked the lab report. Now, I don't know how legit that was, but it was definitely not supposed to go that high."
nursing,3cord9,granolapher,9,Thu Jul 9 15:44:57 2015 UTC,"That's not exactly what that says though.  IO can best the small lumen of a CVC in equal setting, but that's not a guarantee.  Plus the larger lumens will typically blow the IO out of the water.  Where the IO is better is time and skill needed to place it.  Pretty much anyone can successfully place an IO on the first or second attempt in under a minute or two.  The same definitely cannot be said about a CVC, or even IVs in many cases."
nursing,3cord9,justatouchcrazy,2,Thu Jul 9 16:12:23 2015 UTC,"You're right, both IO and CVC are relatively slow compared to large IV's and very slow compared to rapid infusion cannulas, but IV's, CVC's, and RIC lines can be slow and difficult to place. There's another FOAMed post discussing RIC's here:  http://etmcourse.com/large-bore-iv-access-showdown/"
nursing,3cord9,justatouchcrazy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:46:16 2015 UTC,"I am a fan of the RIC, but it's hard to go wrong with a 14g if you can get one because of Poiseuille's Law and their (relative) ease of placement."
nursing,3cord9,ENRN,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:55:49 2015 UTC,"Put a 22 or 24 in a hand, instill 100ml (smaller for kids) of saline while the tourniquet is still on - makes starting a bigger IV in the AC considerably easier. We have done this a few times, and instead of a 22 in the hand, we have got 14s and 16s.   Do remember your average t-connecter reduces any large bore IV to an 18g. Place your IV tubing, or rapid infuser right onto the gelco (with lots of tape)."
nursing,3cord9,justatouchcrazy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:13:44 2015 UTC,"I read that technique earlier this week, and it really sounds like it would work out great.  Luckily on my sick traumas and other poor IVs we've either gotten lucky or been able to find an 18g or larger with ultrasound after a minute or two.  Or just drill and get a line after a few minutes or resuscitation and trying."
nursing,3cord9,Frowns30,4,Thu Jul 9 19:16:34 2015 UTC,The advantage of IO is the speed. With the gun it's easy to drill in quickly.  But when it comes down to massive transfusion in trauma nothing is going to beat a big central line run on a rapid transfuser like the level 1 which also provides the advantage of warmed fluids.   I do love the teaching point that putting a connector to a large bore significantly restricts the flow. Connect that line directly to the angiocath and drain the air out of the bag to keep it from running dry.
nursing,3cord9,auraseer,3,Thu Jul 9 19:22:58 2015 UTC,"nothing is going to beat a big central line run on a rapid transfuser   That is widely believed, but incorrect. A large-bore peripheral IV does beat a central line, given that you're using the same same rapid infuser equipment.  The length of the CVC causes an increase in resistance and a decrease in flow rate. In fact a 16-gauge CVC has less maximum flow than an ordinary 18-gauge peripheral IV."
nursing,3cord9,Frowns30,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:15:58 2015 UTC,"The time it takes to drop a 8.5 French cordis is not that significant for a skilled provider.  I would also point out the a 14g angiocath is not all that easy to place itself and almost always requires a big juicy AC which isn't always present. I just don't trust that in transport, log roll, CT, and everyone else dicking around that the angiocath won't get kinked or pulled. I also don't think the flow rate difference between the two is significant in terms of resuscitation outcome.   Not trying to argue, just my thoughts."
nursing,3cord9,justatouchcrazy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:51:10 2015 UTC,"There was a link posted above (this one) that showed that the only lines that could out flow a 14g PIV were RICs, which are peripheral, and a Cordis.  And the Cordis, the only central line with a faster infusion rate, isn't significantly faster than a 14g, especially considering the time needed for insertion.  Don't get me wrong, I love central lines, but for trauma a 14g makes more sense in the ED for a variety of reasons."

It was open about 6"" and was stuffed with surgical towels, held in place with retention sutures, and then covered with an occlusive dressing. This was before wound-vacs were used as routinely as they are now. In the process of his ICU stay and such he wound up with delirium. He was constantly trying to walk around, forgetting his catheter and i.v. pole were attached to him.   I go by his room one night and check on him before I start a medication round. He's sitting on the side of the bed. Figuring he was about to make a break for it, I get him tucked back into bed and turned on a TV show he liked. I medicate a few rooms and check on him. Guy is just chilling out, so I scan his stuff real quick and go in the room. He's sitting on the side of the bed with his dressing off, towels out, and his lap is full of intestines all tangled in his retention sutures.

She talked to me like I was her daughter and I still remember her.  She was kind and gentle and she was amazing when she helped to save my life when shit really started to hit the fan.

You can make your own schedule and pick up hours around school commitments. This definitely has it's drawbacks, agencies can be stressful to work with, they sign on clients and aren't always knowledgeable or truthful about care plans or their living conditions. The upside to this is it gives you an opportunity to practice the nursing process autonomously, I find myself recognizing things that are overlooked, making a lot of assesments, problem solving and doing casual patient and family teaching during every shift. Another benefit to this is that you can remain employed even if you take huge chunks of time off, that increases the length of your employment history on your resume with minimal effort.  Other options are volunteering at a VA hospital, if you have one close by call them directly and see if they need patient companions. The Commission on Aging hires home health aides and meals on wheels. Your local Health Department especially WIC, in my area they always need lactation consultants and if you're qualified, vitals and immunizations.  If all else fails, you can make your friends and relatives your guinea pigs, practice your vitals, head to toe assessments.

I go into the L&D, Cardiology, Oncology, and some other general units (with both short term and long term staying patients).   I advice volunteering a hospital you want to work in once you're licensed. This way you'll get to know the staff, the hospital floor the general working environment in that area. Typically you apply online, if you don't find anything under volunteering/auxillary page, you could always walk in and ask someone in the reception desk of the hospital.   Ask if they have a section with patient contact.  If you want to go into ER, let me tell you, this will help you. If you have patient contact, as my section does (I help out in the nutrition services).   I've had to help patients who are blind, drugged up on medication. I've seen patients straight out of chemotherapy, others straight out of open heart surgery.  The two craziest things I've seen was a burn victim who had no skin on his nose, had to breath through his mouth, and couldn't open his eyes properly for about two weeks and a half. Secondly, a woman without hands, they where cut off from the wrist downs.

nursing,3cg3vj,PhysicsSaysNo,39,Tue Jul 7 17:35:52 2015 UTC,"Every kind of heart block is an electrical conduction problem within the heart, where the pacing signal from the SA node is not properly transmitted through the AV node to the rest of the myocardium.  The most common cause is physical damage (e.g. from a heart attack), but they can also be caused by things like medications, electrolyte imbalance, vagus nerve overstimulation, or congenital problems.  The types differ not necessarily by underlying cause, but by what is happening to the signal on its way through the AV node to the ventricle. The P wave shows when the signal starts travelling from the SA node, and the QRS is when it has arrived at the ventricles.  First Degree block means the signal gets through successfully, but takes more time to travel. That's why the P-R time interval is increased. This can be caused by a problem anywhere in the conduction system. (Think back to A&P. Bundle of His, Purkinje fibers, all that stuff.)  Wenckebach (Second Degree, Mobitz I) is the AV node getting ""fatigued"" over successive beats. Each time a P wave arrives, the AV node is not fully reset after its prior firing, and so it responds a little more slowly. This gets worse with each beat, the AV node responding more and more slowly, until after a few, it can't respond at all and it fails to pass the signal along. This is why there's a dropped QRS. But then, since the AV node skipped firing, it has extra time to ""rest"" and it goes back to responding near-normally the next time. That's why the cycle repeats.   Second Degree Type II (Mobitz II) means that some signals are failing to get through at all. My book says this usually happens distal to the AV node. Think of this like a light bulb that flickers because it's not fully screwed in. On some beats the connection is not good enough at the right time, and the P wave never makes it to the ventricles. That's when there is a dropped QRS. (This is considered more risky than Wenckebach because it has a higher chance of worsening, dropping more beats, and eventually becoming a complete block.)  Third Degree (complete) block is when P waves are generated properly, but are never successfully transmitted. Either the AV node or some other part of the system is so damaged that it cannot conduct at all. The reason P and QRS appear unrelated is because they are literally, electrically disconnected. QRS is widened because you're seeing an idioventricular rhythm, with the atrial rhythm sort of happening in the next building over.  Does that cover what you need? Or have I made things worse?  (Edit to add) Note one common pitfall: if you don't see P waves at all, that's not a heart block of any kind. That's either A-fib or a junctional rhythm."

nursing,3cg3vj,auraseer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:15:09 2015 UTC,Just an add on for the student: A-fib=irregular and no P. Junctional=no P and regular (or inverted P)  With SVT vs AFib RVR you can tell the difference by checking regularity as well.
nursing,3cg3vj,NurseRattchet,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:56:30 2015 UTC,"That's why the P-R time interval is increased. This can be caused by a problem anywhere in the conduction system. (Think back to A&amp;P. Bundle of His, Purkinje fibers, all that stuff.)  A PR interval being prolonged does not indicate a problem anywhere in the conduction system.  The PR is specific to the pathway between the SA-AV node.  Bundle of His and purkinje blocks are below the AV node and lead to widened QRS complexes, specifically called bundle branch blocks."

Chemo is a very specific field and if you don't plan on doing it forever those skills are not necessarily helpful.  Most future jobs like a Medsurge baseline.

nursing,3cllly,60secondsoffury,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:07:08 2015 UTC,If your end goal is in mental health I would go with the gen med floor. You'll have your fair share of psych holds. The other units are a bit more specific into the area of nursing that you say you don't want to go to. You'll get a (I imagine) a broader scope of experience... Although not as specific. Also... Have you looked into any detox hospitals/units in your area? Perhaps methadone clinics? You'll get mental health experience non-stop in those places. You also won't get paid as much as an acute care RN. In the end tho... A year in any of those units will be good for you. Good on you for wanting to get into mental health.

It can change but when this type of behavior has been ingrained in people, its hard to change."
nursing,3cjhp4,oppressed_white_guy,3,Wed Jul 8 16:26:23 2015 UTC,"Well....from what I see...nursing is mainly a women based profession.  Women can be catty, judgemental, and clicky. I don't see it hardly at all with male nurses (7+ years as an RN).  That's the only thing I can really boil it down to..."

nursing,3cjhp4,StefaniePags,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:13:44 2015 UTC,"Possibly. But in my workplace the nursing ""violence"" was mainly by those nurses who were kinda bitchy in real life, talking behind ur back, etc.  The nice ones were nice to everyone."

nursing,3cjhp4,StefaniePags,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:25:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's more of an issue of comradery. A lot of hospital units have fresh employees who haven't been there for very long.... so the staff hasn't developed a sense of unity with each other. I have worked in units where employees have known each other for 10, 15, 20, 30 years and units where employees have known each other for a few months to a couple of years. From my experience,  the units with the staff who had been there for the longer period of time ran more smoothly, staff looked out for each other, and staff did things together outside of work like getting drinks or having knitting parties. The units with the staff who hadn't been there for a long time.... they didn't seem to run as well.... and people just didn't really look out for each other. I went from a long term old school unit to a brand new new employee unit and it wasn't like that at first but then I and a couple other staff started making changes like helping each other out, doing things for each other, etc.  I think you really have to work to initiate a change to make that happen... but it's hard when the turnover is high because it's like you have to break in the new employees or something. I don't know if that all makes sense."

nursing,3chx6c,granolapher,22,Wed Jul 8 01:16:48 2015 UTC,"Potentially a neat trick, but only in the right situation.  I've read this can be useful for instance in shock patients, when your IV problem is due to lack of peripheral circulating volume. Pumping saline into the vein replaces the blood that has shunted elsewhere. It doesn't seem to help with normal everyday hard sticks, where the vein is sclerosed or fragile or just deeply buried.  Personally, if I have a shocky patient without decent access, I'm probably going to grab the drill and do an IO before I mess about with this."
nursing,3chx6c,auraseer,2,Wed Jul 8 01:26:56 2015 UTC,Yep. In any situation where you don't have the ability to find a good vein and time is of the essence. Do an IO
nursing,3chx6c,lethal_weapon_five,2,Wed Jul 8 08:59:38 2015 UTC,"Useful nugget, keep in mind when the situation fits"
nursing,3chx6c,nursism,2,Wed Jul 8 13:03:45 2015 UTC,"I've never seen this in practice, but it actually makes a lot of sense.  Yes, an IO is quicker but you'll never get the same volume through it that you can with a 14g.  So this technique seems to be a good idea in a situation where you need rapid fluid/blood administration, because it probably takes the same time or less than putting in a semi-sterile central, while someone else is also putting in an IO to start with meds and some fluid resuscitation."
nursing,3chx6c,justatouchcrazy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:26:55 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I thought about doing this, but usually I've got other things that are more important.  Or, we get the doc to insert a central line."

nursing,3ckzoa,Amymars,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:17:49 2015 UTC,"It depends on how much you want to work extra I guess, and how your work week is made up in the OR. I just graduated this summer and have a 100 % job at a nursing home and work whatever extra I can manage on another nursing home. I'm lucky that my weeks circle around 4 days/week, 6 days/week, 5 days/week in that order, so on 4 days/week I gladly take extra at the other nursing home. Keep in mind I really enjoy the work environment and scope of tasks in nursing homes so I endure more without that making me want more free time. It will be tough either way but go for it if you are motivated.  As for your second concern. Think more of what you want to do with your nurse career than what others think. If you feel OR is the right thing to do then go for it. As for not hiring OR nurses I can't really see the problem as you have the same base education as a registered nurse? I'm only familiar with the Norwegian nurse education though."

nursing,3cl3vo,MeastST,2,Wed Jul 8 21:56:23 2015 UTC,Use a card with not enough money. If it tells you your card is declined you failed if it tells you you can't register you passed. I found out today I passed after 75 ....you're probably fine:)   Edit: also you need to wait 24 hrs cause it's graded twice in the first 24 hrs and your first grade can be different from the second. I checked mine with the Pearson vue trick and it was correct.

Since its scored twice your first and second score could be different.  Usually they aren't but they could be which would result in getting either the good pop up and actually failing or it taking your money and you actually passing. I know 24 hrs still sucks to wait but just try to do something fun to keep your mind off it that's what I did. Also most of the time when it shuts off at 75 you passed the system usually gives people who are struggling more time to prove themselves."

nursing,3chqu6,adrianfward,3,Wed Jul 8 00:23:43 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: researching medical/health-related info online makes patients think they're super-smart...but doesn't necessarily make them any smarter.   This conclusion cannot be drawn from your data.   You did not actually test patient's medical knowledge at all. Therefore you cannot validly make any statement about whether research truly made them ""smarter"" or more knowledgeable. That would be an objective measurement, and you didn't measure it.  You tested clinicians' perception of patients' medical knowledge, and clinicians' perception of the patients' perception of their medical knowledge. This may tell you something about clinicians' relationship to their patients and their views of self-diagnosis, and maybe that's useful.

Or, as you said it:   something about clinicians' relationship to their patients and their views of self-diagnosis   ...and I think that's very useful when we're considering how people are getting health-related/medical info, and how any differences in patient knowledge (both real and perceived) affect patient outcomes.  Thanks for the thoughtful comment!"

nursing,3chqu6,DanKC,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:25:44 2015 UTC,"I am interested in your data, how did you measure patients understanding? What about the potential for patients to not report internet research out of fear of clinician response? An example is that in my experience many nurses don't disclose they are nurses because physicians can get weird about it so its easier to feign ignorance. What about gender of patients and variation in clinicians perceptions RT patient gender or education level.  Unless the clinicians used some standardized tool to measure patient understanding /u/auraseer is right I don't see how you could claim to measure patients knowledge.   It would be interesting to see the full survey I missed it the first time around.   Also regarding the negative consequences of internet research, alot of those consequences could be framed as appropriate self-advocacy, its hard for me to accept wanting a second opinion as a negative outcome."

nursing,3chtq3,arict,2,Wed Jul 8 01:00:09 2015 UTC,"I felt a lot like you at first, and ended up shaving for my interview to make a good first impression. I haven't straight shaved since. I normally rock my beard around an inch and try to keep it moderately trimmed (maybe a trim every 2 weeks). I am at a very liberal hospital though; we don't even have a dress code and they allow us to wear any T shirt we want basically. I'm in a large CSICU and have never had a family complain about my appearance. In emergent bedside procedures like open chests I just have to be extra careful and make sure I have something that covers my whole face and not just my mouth and nose.   Sometimes other nurses make comments when it gets really scruffy, but my manager and the docs never have."

A well groomed beard is just as presentable as a fully clean shave.  During nursing school, and at my very first job, I was required to be fitted for an N95 mask. They don't seal properly except on bare skin. So for that couple of years I had to go down to a Vandyke, which was small enough to fit entirely within the mask. At later jobs I've been able to decline the N95 fit test and just use PAPR, so I went back to my preferred beard style.  Other than that, facial hair has never been any issue."

I have worked in disaster response and could have potentially had to wear a respirator so I always made it clear that if need be I would shave it at the office and even kept a razor and scissors just in case."

nursing,3chtq3,MaK_Ultra,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:52:13 2015 UTC,If you're going to have a beard make sure you keep it well groomed and trimmed.  You want to look clean and well put together for not only your boss but for your patients.    Also be sure to see if there are any policies against such things when being fitted for an N-95.

nursing,3cj0ee,amberliin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:08:14 2015 UTC,"That's a good question and it depends completely where you want to live and what your goals are.  Do you want tl work in a city in a hospital setting? If yes then you 100% need a bsn in Nursing. Most hospitals in NY and LA and Denver won't even consider your resume without a BSN unless you have tons of experience AND know someone. A lot of friends of mine graduated 4 years ago and still can't find hospital jobs because they don't hire bsn new nurses anymore. It's part of a requirement for a hospital to recieve magnet status. Unfortunately these major hospitals would rather pay a travel nurse to fill a position then hire a new nurse so you need to be marketable.   However,  if you plan on working some where less in demand. Some small town or somewhere that there is a hugh need for nurses.  Like Texas an asn may be all you need and you can get the bsn later.   I recommend you go straight for bsn so you have more options and you make yourself look more valuable.  I've never had the issue  ""but she doesn't have a bsn""  and I'm sad to say I have friends who have had this issue when it came down to getting a position they wanted. Since you already have a Bachelors. It would be smartest and cheapest for you to go a Bachelors to Bachelors program for nursing. I know they have them in cities and they are pricey sometimes but very short, 16 months or so. That way you can start working fast.    College dept is not the end of the world. I still owe a lot but you will always have a job once you start working. And you will make good money. Just make sure you include it into your budget.   Hope this helped."

The public hospitals here are way different from the public trauma center I worked at in Ohio. They still have wards instead of rooms! Nothing is new and lots of things are broken, but you'll get the sicker patients. I've been really surprised though how much less sick the patients are at Harbor than they were in Ohio. Everybody here was like ""poor little Ohio girl in the big city will be overwhelmed by the craziness"" but honestly, they ain't seen nothing. There's definitely a lack of nursing based protocols and change. I feel like a lot of my autonomy is gone. The ratios are nice. I've heard that applying for a county position as a new grad can be a very long and tedious process though. Whatever you do, stay away from Kaiser.

nursing,3cfdpw,auraseer,2,Tue Jul 7 14:56:54 2015 UTC,ATC Healthcare Services has a contract with the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections to provide medical staffing for all of the correctional institutions.  So I'm applying to this one particular correctional institution but the employer is ATC.
nursing,3cfdpw,spockrocker522,3,Tue Jul 7 15:05:17 2015 UTC,"For my job with Corrections (Canada) I had to hand over tons of sensitive info, and go through some security/medical clearances before they could give me a job offer.  BUT that was during an in person interview where they clearly were wanting to hire me. I would decline to fill some out, and if they're a valid company they should be happy to move forward with an interview."
nursing,3cfdpw,lafferme,2,Tue Jul 7 15:10:15 2015 UTC,"Okay. Still weird.  It sounds like the staffing company is planning to hire you on paper, without laying eyes on you, before sending you to interview at the work site. If the manager at the site likes you, they would want you to start immediately, so they'd want the paperwork to already be done. (That's the advantage of using a staffing service in the first place.)  But it's very odd for the staffing service not to interview you first. Most reputable recruiters don't just take any random person off the street. They usually want to check you out first, to make sure referring you will not harm their reputation. If they're not doing that, I wonder why.  Are you sure it's a W2 W4 and tax forms, and not identity forms for a background check? That would be a different situation."
nursing,3cfdpw,lafferme,2,Tue Jul 7 15:23:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's Acknowledgement and Authorization, Employment Eligibility Verification, Form W-4, their substance abuse policy and release of criminal records, and stuff like that. I made a typo, it is W-4 not W2.    Plus they want me to e-mail them a copy of my Driver’s license, SS card, EITHER a current 2 step TB test OR have my physician complete the form they attached, Current Healthcare Provider CPR. Which all seems pretty standard and acceptable, if I had at the very least an appointment for an interview.  I was thinking about visiting the facility in person even though they are not the ones hiring the nurses.  Do you think that doing so will be useful?"
nursing,3cfdpw,Sapphire_Starr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:39:58 2015 UTC,"If the facility is a correctional facility I don't think they can let you in like that, you should try contacting someone from ATC and asking if you could tour the facility, there is too much security for you to show up out of the blue for a tour"
nursing,3cfdpw,dandelion_k,3,Tue Jul 7 15:51:09 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I worked for ATC in Ohio at a correctional institution a few months ago, right out of school, and filled out all that paperwork before stepping foot inside the place.  In fact, the local office later called and asked if I wanted a tour.  I showed up and it was actually an orientation.  No interview, nothing.  Hired, just like that.  Seemed fishy but I needed the money/job.  Nothing happened, I worked for them for a couple months but moved on to a hospital job I was offered because better hours and pay.  But my limited experience with them said they were pretty legit.  My understanding of it was they have you fill out all that paperwork digitally so they can place you faster and you can get right to work when they do.  Be aware though, that there's very little training.  I got five days and was on my own - with up to twenty patients a shift that were all mine.  It was pretty scary as a new grad, though most of the nurses that worked there were willing to help me out when I was in a bind, and the LPNs did med passes and wound care, so there wasn't as much responsibility.  Anyway, if you have any questions about any of it, feel free to ask!"
nursing,3cfdpw,tennessee_hilltrash,2,Tue Jul 7 16:02:20 2015 UTC,"That's good to know!  I have the recruiter's phone number so I might call and ask for a tour before submitting the documentations (there's no harm in being extra safe right?). I'm glad to know that you had a legit experience with them though.   I asked someone else these questions, I hope you don't mind if I copy/paste them here.  Any thoughts are greatly appreciated. From your experience, what do you think about working in corrections as the first job as a licensed nurse? Is there too much autonomy for an inexperienced nurse? Is there a stigma attached that might make it harder for me to work in other areas in the future? (the last part is important for me since I am a spouse of a military member) What kind of wound care was there?  Why/how would they get wounded?"
nursing,3cfdpw,tennessee_hilltrash,2,Tue Jul 7 16:12:16 2015 UTC,"My hospital just hired someone I worked with at the prison hospital who was also with ATC and had been with them about a year.  I don't think it hurt his chances at getting hired on his floor, which is med/surg.  If you spin it right, it actually makes for good interview fodder.  Because:  The place I worked at was an actual hospital that services most of Ohio's prison population.  Anyone who can't be fixed totally in their home facility's clinic.  So we had acute and chronic med/surg patients, a long term care, and hospice.  Any shift you could be on any floor. I only worked there about six weeks but I got a LOT of experience in a lot of things, which spins into very nice experience.  Yes, it's a lot of autonomy.  It really is only a couple days of training and then it's all 'go forth, be a nurse'.  I was starting IVs and hanging blood (though that at least still required two nurses) and changing dressings and doing death paperwork/morgue care (hospice patient died on my second day on my own) and assessing and doing all of it all on my own, for the most part.  Like I said, the other nurses would help, but not always.  Sometimes I just had to figure it out.  It was scary, but I did learn a lot and in a way it was good for me because I had to gain confidence, quickly.  But I refused to do anything on my own that I didn't think I could do, even if the other nurses were busy, I would wait, unless it was an emergent situation, in which case the others would come running anyway.  I wasn't risking my license.  Wounds.  Most were decubes or due to tubes or ostomies or surgeries.  I did have one guy who was paralyzed from the waist down that decided that burying the shaft of a pen in his leg, twice, was a good form of protest.  Dude was a flat out idiot.  I didn't see much in the way of wounds from violence, though they did happen on occasion.  Where I was, there was a wound nurse, so aside from assessing the wounds, I rarely did much with them.  I would change a dressing if it needed it or in the case of one guy with ESRD and CHF whose legs wept non stop every two hours because the wound nurse couldn't keep up with him and everyone else, but for the most part didn't have much to do with them."
nursing,3cfdpw,futurebutters,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:28:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the detailed reply!  In nursing school in Ohio, did you get to practice starting an IV? The state where I'm from, they don't let you practice in school but might be able to have an opportunity to do so during practicum.  My preceptor didn't want me to do one on an AIDs patient but all of the patients that we had that needed a new IV port had AIDs so I just kinda graduated without ever having to install a new IV access site."

I worked for ATC.  They're legit. They're a little scummy, but they aren't scammy. They don't care about the RN's they are hiring - they just have to provide enough to fulfill their contracts. They didn't interview me or my coworker - they literally send nearly everyone who applies on to orientation onsite at the prison.  If you want/need, feel free to PM me. I worked for a women's prison for ATC for one year and I'd be happy to talk to you about if you have questions!"
nursing,3cfdpw,SailorRalph,3,Fri Jul 10 00:15:23 2015 UTC,What kind of place is this?
nursing,3cf90u,awleitch,6,Tue Jul 7 13:27:10 2015 UTC,"It's both. Our hospital attempts to have a ""fast track unit"" for quick stitches and broken toes, and sections with trauma rooms. Usually we work at 4:1 ratio, sometimes 3:1 with a trauma room assignment or great staffing. It's busy as hell some nights as the main thing right now for our ED is timing, get people seen quick and then out the door or up to a room asap.   So you'll be trying to call report on one that needs to get admitted to a tele bed, discharge an abdominal pain that has gastritis and needs to follow up with GI in the morning, line and lab a newly triaged altered mental status from the nursing home, and a chest pain just rolled in the door via EMS. You need to have a clear idea on triage and priorities as this situation happening all night can and does happen. The second a room has been emptied and cleaned there's a new patient in it. Then some nights you're sitting around with no patients after a certain hour and someone is making a dunkin donuts run and the charge nurse is trying to send extra nurses home.   Do you like making needed interventions, multitasking quickly, and can handle a high stress environment? Than maybe the ED is for you. If you get overwhelmed and panicky when 2 patients need something important at the same time, another patient is belligerent drunk trying to fight, there's one doctor telling you to get an intubation kit for your patient going south, and another doctor on hold on the phone for your other patient getting admitted all at the same time? Then maybe you can build the mentality you need to have if you want to work there bad enough.  Of course the best way to see what happens (and if you think with proper training you can and want do it ) is to go and shadow a nurse for a shift or three. Our hospital serves an entire county so we see nearly everything, but other counties have multiple hospitals that work differently, some busier than ours and some not so much."
nursing,3cf90u,UseUrLogic,3,Tue Jul 7 13:52:51 2015 UTC,"I was an ortho nurse for a while and decided that if a day shift ever opened up in our ER I would go for it. I did my leadership semester in the ER and was terrified of the pace and since then I felt bad for letting it intimidate me. So I got the job figuring I could always go back to ortho if I didn't like it. I am not an adrenaline junkie, nor to I crave excitement for excitement's sake. I'm really a pretty boring fellow. I have been in this Level 1 trauma ER for about 6 months now and I am never going back to the floor. I have had the opportunity to do so much that I would have never been exposed to had I stayed where I felt comfortable.  I see so much on any given day. There are slower days, but the majority of them are faster pace with a few being impossible. Luckily we have a great team in our ER and if I am stuck in a trauma room, other nurses look to my other pts."
nursing,3cf90u,mindtapped,2,Tue Jul 7 13:59:06 2015 UTC,"I work in a small Level IV critical access E.R.  Our bread and butter is:  Chest pains SOB Belly pains Headaches Lacs Traumas/code blues/med resus  I typically spend 8 hours on the floor and 4 hours in the triage booth.  Seeing 9-12 patients in that time with up to 3 other nurses, 1 tech, 1 doc, and 1 np/pa.  It can certainly be mundane and people can really be a pain in the ass sometimes.  That being said, the one or two patients I see a week that honestly need immediate interventions within an hour really keep me coming back."
nursing,3cf90u,scootermn,2,Tue Jul 7 13:38:14 2015 UTC,"Is it exciting and different each day like I'd imagine or is it more mundane with people coming in for stitches and headaches?    Yes to both.  The great majority of patients have complaints that are not critically time-sensitive. Abdominal pain, back pain, lacerations, broken bones, cough and cold, headache, etc. Mixed in randomly among them are a smaller number of ""exciting"" things like heart attacks, strokes, major vehicle accidents, gunshot wounds, and so on.   The proportion of these depends on where you work.   My first emergency job was in a low-acuity standalone ED that didn't even take ambulance traffic, only walk-ins. On average we saw 90 patients a day, 2 got admitted to the hospital, and the rest were treated and sent home. Once or twice a week we got something really critical like a stroke or a gunshot wound.  I now work in a level 1 trauma center in a large city. We get 5 or 6 major trauma patients every day, with the majority being gunshots and knife wounds, and we also get lots of strokes and chest pains and critical transfers from other hospitals. But more than 70% of our patients are still those ""mundane"" complaints that don't make for exciting stories."
nursing,3cf90u,auraseer,2,Tue Jul 7 16:18:18 2015 UTC,"I'm a level 3 ED with only one level 1 facility that's about 15 minutes away. No level 2's.  We are also the only ""Chest pain center"" in the 1 hr our radius. We get tons of STEMIs full arrests and traumas that aren't stable enough to make it 15 minutes down the road. Many times we have people that walk in the door and you know immediately ""ahhhh this one will be interesting!"" Tons of heroin ODs that refuse to call 911 and drive in a blue body. It's always exciting. Maybe not every hour but definitely every shift.  I love my job, it's the only thing that helps me survive 12 hours in a row. (I'm a sleepy person). Give it a try. You don't have to stay anywhere you don't like but you might find that you love emergency medicine."
nursing,3cf90u,insertwittyusername9,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:07:52 2015 UTC,It depends on where you work. We have a ton of hospitals in my area so it is more evenly spread out. The average shift is fairly boring. Occasionally you will get very sick patients but the average patient is stable enough. Usually by 3 am we have the place cleared out and then the city will wake up at about 10 am to start filling up the ER.   Occasionally we have interesting cases like the lady whose heart rate was in the 30s. Or the one lady who had a pe and coded every time you touched her. Or some strokes. There is a cath lab.   Majority of stuff is abd pains followed by chest pain followed by difficulty breathing. This is in the main ER and not quick care.
nursing,3cf90u,Amymars,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:34:08 2015 UTC,do you mind telling me what level trauma center it is where you work?
nursing,3cf90u,Amymars,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:35:36 2015 UTC,3 but we have a lot of trauma centers for the area. We have 3 level Is and I know another III for sure. I think there is another level III or it may be a level II too. We have a weird dynamics between hospitals and systems. Then we have a handful of freestanding er and two that aren't any trauma centers. And we are a small city.
nursing,3cf90u,pammins,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:32:07 2015 UTC,"it's mostly boring but i think ER nurses (i'm biased) are the funniest and weirdest people so you're basically getting paid to hang out with some hilarious friends.  and then yeah, sometimes shit just completely hits the fan and you're saving a life or two. it's cool, i like it."

Consider being in a situation where you are so ill that you can't even wash yourself, you know you smell, and it feels terrible on your skin.  Imagine how embarrassing it must be to be in such a situation, even if you can hide it well.  Lastly, imagine a Nurse / CNA who doesn't seem bothered by helping you with this, and how humbled and grateful you'd feel that someone would do this for you.  It's something simple but does a lot.  Any embarrassment you may have is within the patient ten fold, but they typically have no choice."

nursing,3cj401,Amymars,4,Wed Jul 8 10:35:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The great majority of ED patients are ambulatory and can clean up after themselves, but for the ones that cannot, it can get really bad. Massive GI bleeds, NH patients with C. diff all up in their sacral ulcers, patients found down at home after multiple days, drunk patients peeing all over everything, psychotic patients painting the walls brown..."
nursing,3cj401,auraseer,8,Wed Jul 8 19:06:08 2015 UTC,"For me, my initial discomfort with bathing patients was grounded in an incorrect understanding of the task and the reason that I as doing it.   It's strange to people who don't have children and aren't used to the task, but that goes away. It went away almost instantly when I more fully understood my primary function as a nurse. We all go into school because we ""like caring for people,"" ""want to help people,"" ""like all the cool shit we get to see/do.""  Ultimately, my primary role is to restore dignity to my patients, who have each, in some way, had theirs stolen. From the moment they arrive at whatever point of intake, they are admitting to us that they are suddenly unable to perform some basic function (breathing, keeping their blood or bones on the correct side of the skin, walking, speaking, eating, and yes, bathing themselves) which they may never have had trouble with in their life. My job is to help them regain that function and in the interim, perform it for them in such a way that maintains their dignity. Think for a moment of your initial reaction when you see someone wandering around who has clearly not bathed or changed clothes recently. The patient is unable to prevent this indignity, and it's my job to prevent it for them.  tl;dr: Every time you bathe a patient, you are restoring dignity which you, and they, have always taken for granted. It's a privilege to do."

nursing,3cd2iz,alethalcombination,3,Tue Jul 7 15:11:36 2015 UTC,I don't know a ton about IUDs so maybe someone with more information will chime in but I thought that it used to be recommended that these not be used until after a woman had already had one baby? Was there any particular medical reasoning for this or is this not as common-practice as I thought it was?
nursing,3cd2iz,alethalcombination,14,Tue Jul 7 00:04:59 2015 UTC,There was a line of thinking that if the os of the cervix had not stretched (through child birth) then placement would be difficult but that's not really supported by literature.
nursing,3cd2iz,zucchinicupcake,3,Tue Jul 7 00:15:41 2015 UTC,Ok. That was what I was wondering.
nursing,3cd2iz,alethalcombination,7,Tue Jul 7 00:50:05 2015 UTC,"They can occasionally be more difficult to place in women who have not had vaginal births, but they are usually placed with no issues.  There is actually a 3 year hormonal IUD (skyla) that is being marketed toward women who had not had children.  It is is slightly smaller than the 5 year hormonal IUD (mirena).  Although, there is usually no reason someone could just get the 5 year IUD even though they had not had children.  Edit: I also think it's worth mentioning that the IUD can be taken out at anytime if the women wishes to become pregnant or they don't like it.  I feel like another reason women who have not had children do not get IUDs is because they feel like they are a 3-10 year commitment, when that is not the case."
nursing,3cd2iz,perrla,3,Tue Jul 7 00:57:58 2015 UTC,"See, I wondered about that. I've had a child by C-section and have Mirena myself. No issues.

I was too busy kind of freaking out about what she was doing to listen very intently at the time. Thanks for the info. I had not heard about skyla before. I should brush up on this stuff."

nursing,3cd2iz,landpirito,2,Wed Jul 8 04:38:00 2015 UTC,"Brilliant! I'm a huge supporter of IUDs since doing a ton of research and getting one myself. I think programs like this should be universal. While they aren't for everyone, I believe an overwhelming majority of women would benefit from an IUD vs pills or other options.   There's also something that people don't talk about much, but the copper one can actually be used as emergency contraception. I could see that being a huge benefit if it was offered to anyone who sought out Plan B. Instead of a one time quick fix, they could have the immediate quick fix plus legitimate long term contraception for about the same price (or free under programs like this).  The major road block to any of this is still education. Very little is talked about with teenagers in school based sex ed and even with the 20/30s crowd GPs seem to be hesitant to bring it up. When I was researching, I talked to everyone I could about them, male and female, and the responses where so overwhelmingly positive I felt like I discovered some well kept secret."

nursing,3cd2iz,DrDeath666,2,Tue Jul 7 20:20:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't look into it too much because I was looking at Mirena but I believe that it works by preventing implantation, whereas Mirena prevents ovulation.   Edit: this is also why there's some religious objections to IUDs. Copper used to be the o my choice and if you subscribe to life from conception it could be seen as an abortion. The hormonal ones (Mirena) work on a different mechanism so that point is moot with them. Again, education required."

That's the busiest shift, you're probably opening a new pod with all new people and that's not a good ratio.  Maybe the ER isn't for you. Maybe THIS ER isn't for you.   Go job hunt. Take the time to talk to other units, maybe spend a few hours shadowing to get the feel. Maybe you need a different hospital. Maybe you need a different floor. There's no shame in saying ""Hey, I tried the ER/hospital X and it wasn't a good fit for me."""
nursing,3cg1af,outrunningzombies,4,Tue Jul 7 17:15:49 2015 UTC,"I have been an ER nurse for 9 years now in two different facilities.  My first place had one section that was 5:1 (mostly low acuity patients), but mostly 4:1 or 3:1.  My current ER is pretty strict 3:1.  With 9 months experience, you don't have any business taking care of that many patients.  I don't have any business doing it either with 9 years behind me.  It's not a reasonable load, and it reduces you from doing actual critical thinking to just straight tasked based nursing.  Take the experience you have gained and find a facility that will give you a proper patient load and you might find that you actually love ER nursing again.  Good luck!"
nursing,3cg1af,Zartanio,3,Wed Jul 8 03:25:57 2015 UTC,I support maxing ER nurses out at 5. Preferably 1:3 but 1:4 is usually manageable
nursing,3cg1af,Amymars,2,Wed Jul 8 03:02:10 2015 UTC,"Working in the ED is an extremely stressful environment, especially the one you are describing. It took me over a year to feel comfortable in the ED and I still get stressed out at times. There's so much focus on being quick in the ED but when you are caring for that many patients it is important to take a step back sometimes. Maybe take a minute and maybe make tea or have a snack to calm down and reset. I regularly take take of 8-10 patients at once for the majority of my shift and two years in it is still stressful, it is even stressful for the nurses who have been there 20 years. It's simply the nature of the beast at some hospitals.   If you truly can't handle it anymore I would stick it out until you get to 12 months and then look at internal transfers to other units, change of shift (night shift sometimes slows down after 4am) or another hospital. You will see on this subreddit there are ED nurses who max out at 5:1.   As far as the extra shifts I don't do them as they are not worth it to me. If I happen to do an extra shift I only do 8 hours since it seems like it goes by quicker, plus I'm more likely to float if I am not there an entire shift"
nursing,3cg1af,94H,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:22:41 2015 UTC,I started in NY where its very similar stress. I know you probably love your work hours but they are by far the worst. I work mid shift now but I have 5 years experience and have a patient ratio in California. Even then sometimes it gets hard.   My honest opinion is you must do 1 of 3 things because it will NOT get easier.  And high stress environments in an ER with a nww grad is a good way to make a fatal mistake and possibly hurt  someone.  1. Change shifts. 7a or 7p have a good flow and generally have down time.  (day shift has it early morning at beginning and night shift has it at the end)  2. Go to a different unit.  Maybe ICU is more your speed? They always take ER nurses and you still have the excitement in a more controlled setting.  Or pacu.  Or cath lab.  Or really anywhere is easier!  3. Consider maybe travel nursing. Get the hell out of this state that throws  7 patients at you and maybe consider moving to Cali.  Great pay and NEVER more then 4 patients. In the end you'll be happier.  But yes its a hard to drop everything and leave.  But I did  it!   Good luck to you. But bottom line. We don't change as people too easily and you need to get out of your situation before you make a mistake.
nursing,3cg1af,amberliin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:00:55 2015 UTC,Move to California.  We have ratio laws here.  The ratio for the ED is 1:4.  The hospital I work at assigns 3 patients to the nurse that has the high acuity assignments.

I generally love what I do. I have many protocols available and very good freedom to use them. However, I'm on my feet for most of my shift. Nurses, on average, have a little more time to relax on shift than RTs do, and it's much easier for a nurse to transition to another setting if they choose to.   As an RT, you can also feel like the nurse's oxygen and breathing treatment bitch. It's extraordinarily infuriating to be called multiple times per night to give nebs to patients who are short of breath due to CHF, ESRD, or other pathologies not treatable with bronchodilators.

When you are lacking in sleep and guzzling caffeine, anxiety can be exacerbated. It's important to identify the subliminal thoughts behind the feelings. For me, my anxiety stems from my constant drive for perfection as a nurse--to know everything possible about my specialty and do everything as best i can. Silly and unreasonable, eh? For now, get adequate sleep, take vitamin d, exercise exercise exercise. If possible, develop positive self-talk to counter the anxiety causing thoughts/feelings. Most importantly, dont let your brain develop a pattern of anxiety response if what i suggested above does not alleviate your symptoms. Valerian root and passion flower are two great herbal remedies that work well for some people."

Like you, once i got into work, I was pretty much fine. The hours before my shift started were always horrible.   I think that night shift was the main problem. I saw my physician, and he put me on a low-dose of Restoril which at least improved my sleep quality between shifts.  I exercised on my days off, and prepared meals to bring to work, which made a lot of difference in my overall quality of life.   I don't know if it had to do with night work, or just the nature of hospital nursing itself. Its great that you like your job, and you like your co-workers. Talking to your physician or even talk therapy might help as well. Just know that you aren't alone in feeling this way. Have you talked to your co-workers about this!

Not while I was at the hospital, but in the middle of the night when I was trying to revert back to sleeping at night. I would wake up with my heart pounding and mind racing.  Soon after, I started having panic attacks during waking hours. I talked with my PCP about it and was prescribed a low dose SSRI. My anxiety was gone and I slept better during the day between shifts.  After 15ish months I tried to wean myself off it but it completely threw off my sleep pattern and I was exhausted during my shifts, so now I'm back on it.  Nights is definitely not a forever thing for me, so I hope I won't need it once I switch to days."

nursing,3ccz3q,conundrum2,11,Tue Jul 7 00:52:23 2015 UTC,"Because of phenylephrine's alpha only effects, literature shows that it is the best to increase map and raising cpp.   The use of pressors in neuro patients is almost exclusively vascular in nature because they typically don't need the inotropic or chronotropic effects of norepi, dopamine, dobutamine, etc.   This is particularly true in SAH with active spasm.

nursing,3ccz3q,FrauKoko,3,Mon Jul 6 23:56:14 2015 UTC,"I've never seen in happen, but you'd most likely know because you'd stop getting sensible data. Your temp probe would probably stop working. Wedge pressure might read zero if the sensor broke off, or it might read very high if the sensor works but the balloon fails to inflate.  As for how to respond to the suspicion of breakage, you notify your intensivist ASAP. A broken piece would be a big honking embolus floating into the pulmonary vasculature. You'll want an immediate CXR to look for disconnected bits, and if any are spotted, the patient will probably go straight to cath lab or OR for retrieval."
nursing,3ccz3q,boatholes,2,Tue Jul 7 01:56:51 2015 UTC,"Upon removal you're supposed to look at the tip. It's pretty obvious is there is a problem. Like the balloon part is ripped up or missing all together. They are pretty tough so while it's not impossible, it's pretty uncommon.   I've seen a few scenarios where the swan ended up being sutured to the heart during surgery. One case went back to the OR to remove the offending suture so it could be removed safely. Another time it was forcefully ripped out by the attending...the patient was fine and no issues. But the swan was a gnarly looking but had no missing pieces. That's the only time I've seen a swan get mangled in 5 years in a CTICU setting."

They were receiving medication for edema, and frequent boluses.  They demonstrated deficits when their map got to 90, so it was imperative to keep their MAP high through any means possible.  Their TCDs were also shite, which explains the need for hign MAP.    This was an unusual case, but only due to the addition of vaso.  We routinely utilize, and our intensivists are very quick to add levo.

nursing,3cdx9m,Knight-in-Gale,3,Tue Jul 7 05:11:29 2015 UTC,"Nursing school sucked balls for me. I've never been super confident in things, but I have always had confidence in my ability. But school killed that. I questioned everything. Then, I got my DREAM job in the ER as a new grad. I was terrified. During orientation, I gained some confidence back. Over time, I gained more.   The biggest thing to remember in an emergency.... if you don't know, ask. If you are unsure of a patients status, ask for help. If you don't know how to do something, say so. I had a lady bradying at 32.... pass out on me. 6 second pause. I freaked and pressed the code button. She woke up as people flew in the room. Do I still feel a little silly? Yes. Was it the right thing? HELL Yes. I knew I needed help, and she did stop having a heart beat.   Just err on the side of caution. Don't get cocky, ask questions, and give yourself credit for what you do figure out. You'll learn more as you go! I took a notebook and jotted down EVERYTHING, and slowly began jotting down less and less, referring more, and then memorizing!"
nursing,3cdx9m,eziern,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:33:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you have to trust in your skills. Having that faith from your instructors is huge, as they are nurses themselves, and can usually tell when someone is or isn't right for the job (yes, there are a vast number of exceptions, but let's think ideally for a minute). Yeah, you're gonna mess up. Odds are, you're probably going to do something that will end up causing someone's life to drastically alter, or worse. It's part of the job, and you've got to get over that. You can't be afraid to fail, or else you won't end up being a hero in that emergency situation you fear so much. And also know that you're not alone in this. The fear of incompetency is something that has popped up time and time again on this subreddit. Not being afraid to fail is how you're going to get over that and learn. You are only human in the end. Good luck, and be blessed!   Also, what do they mean by ""minimally competent""?"

nursing,3cdx9m,daboz37,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:20:43 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean. I was and still am sometimes the quiet shy person. I too was not as confident as others seem. Once you start a job and go through orientation, you might start to feel better. Honestly that first about year or so is the hardest. Eventually you will get comfortable and will be able to do a lot of tasks in your sleep. Don't be afraid to do new tasks- usually my motto is see one do one. Basically see a new task done by someone, then next time you do the task yourself. Ask a lot of questions and try to learn as much as you can."
nursing,3cda08,newgradorthopedic,2,Tue Jul 7 00:37:59 2015 UTC,"My first job was on a medical-surgical floor adjacent to an ortho unit, we shared a manager, so I'd pick up over time in ortho as it was a slightly slower pace. By slower I mean the majority of patients were medically stable and there were very few total cares. In fact, in the year I worked there, I can only remember there ever being one total care patient. For some reason, our hospital sent confused little old ladies with broken hips to the medical-surgical unit. Ortho occasionally got them, but it was rare.   Our ratios were 1:6, but we could flex up to seven. The ratio was fine, what makes ortho busy is pain management. Lots of PRN pain meds, helping people ambulate, etc.. The unit will also be busy certain days because of surgeries. On busy days there would be three nurses, 13 admissions, and 10-14 discharges.   It's hospital dependent, but most weekends our ortho unit would shut down and they'd transfer their remaining patients to us. We shared a manager, so staffing was combined on weekends, the ortho nurses would come work our unit (which they hated).   As for injuries, all bedside nursing is hard on your body, you have to be careful. If you're moving someone in bed, get help.   One thing I didn't like about ortho was they got a lot of really difficult chronic pain patients. As a new nurse, it stressed me out, because I didn't understand they were never going to be pain free (they can also be manipulative).  Another con, we had some difficult MD's. Verbally aggressive, refused to follow policy (consults are supposed to be physician to physician, our docs refused to call their own consults, and would ask us to do it. One medical team started refusing the consult and we'd end up RRTing patients because home meds weren't ordered), and it's a lot of customer service. I will mention I personally tend to prefer AMS, very sick, and patients with behavioral health issues. I don't know why, but I always feel most comfortable, and enjoy serving this population. When I have patients who are independent outside the hospital I notice I feel more like a concierge/waitress than a nurse.     My only advice is as soon as you're off orientation, see if you can float. It's good to have other experiences. One of my former co-workers only worked the ortho unit unless she was forced to come to ours (in which case she struggled)- she tried working ER and ended up quitting. She's back in ortho. Don't get me wrong, ortho is a great skill to have- I work in telemetry and just last night was taking care of a total knee patient, but if you're not used to dealing with medical issues it's harder to change specialties (though not impossible)."
nursing,3cda08,mogris,2,Tue Jul 7 08:04:52 2015 UTC,"I worked on a surgical floor with a lot of ortho patients for 3 years. We got joint replacements, spinal fusions/laminectomies, fractures, etc. 1:5-7 was pretty standard. Their goal was 1:4-5, but we mostly had 6 patients. 7 patients was a rarity and only when census was really high and we were short staffed--but 7 sucks. You need to be careful about body mechanics and proper lifting technique for sure. I haven't been majorly injured (just sore muscles and stuff), but a few of my coworkers have hurt their backs and had to go out on medical leave. If you aren't sure if you need a second person, it's a good idea to get a second, or even third person to help you.   Most of the joint replacement patients were in their 50s-70s, but in pretty good health otherwise, because they had to be cleared for an elective surgery. Many of them had comorbidities (DM, HTN, OSA, etc), but were well controlled. A lot of the spine patients were younger (20s-50s)--but I found them to be the worst. Spinal surgery is painful and those patients are needy. Little old ladies with broken hips suck too, because they are often confused fall risks who become even more confused with all the IV pain meds you give them.   You will be giving a lot of pain meds. You will become very familiar with PCA/PCEA pumps, capnography, and all the narcotics. There is a decent amount of blood transfusions. Lots of antibiotics. You will become BFFs with PT/OT because they are working with all of your patients. I liked the elective joint replacements because they usually wanted to be there and you got to see them start to get better and get on their way to an improved quality of life.  Good luck. I used to really like it, but I got burnt out after a while and my body always hurt when I came home from work. It is fast paced for sure, and you will not have much time to be bored!"
nursing,3cda08,wicksa,2,Tue Jul 7 21:50:18 2015 UTC,"I work on an ortho floor, but on the days that we don't get many ortho surgeries, we get a lot of GI surgeries, and of course there's always some med-surg spill over. Ortho is fairly straight forward, IMO. We rarely get a knee replacement, but we see a lot of hip replacements, ORIFs, spinal fusions and laminectomies. For the spinal surgeries, it's helpful to know the symptoms of lumbar stenosis, and cervical stenosis. We do neurovascular checks q 4 on pretty much all of our ortho surgeries. Know what complications to look for and the s/s like DVTs, compartment syndrome (especially with the crush injuries) Pain management is obviously a huge issue, and people who come in to have spinal surgery have often been on a lot of pain medication for a long time, so their pain can generally be difficult to control. Lots of PCAs. Several JP drains and wound vacs.   The patients who come in for spinal surgery generally don't have a lot of comorbidities and they tend to be around 40-60 (they are generally more ""needy"") Lots of hip fracture patients however do since they tend to be older. We see a lot of those, and totals are common on my floor. Bed alarms and TABS monitors for days.   Our ratio is generally 1:5 or 1:6 on nights (1:4 to 1:5 on days). It definitely feels overwhelming at first, but once you get the hang of things, it's deifinitely reasonable. Hope you have a Tech! Ours is invaluable. I have hurt my back a few times, nothing major though thanks to the fact that I usually always have her around to help me.   I love it, personally. Good luck!"
nursing,3cda08,jessiday,2,Wed Jul 8 14:35:12 2015 UTC,"I work on a surgical floor with a majority of the population being total joints. Before you start, brush up on hip and knee precautions, as well as post op day 1,2,&3 protocols/plans (when does PT come to work with the patients, how are they ambulatory, BM yet!? etc)   I've found our population to be diverse, age wise. Most are older with a few comorbidities here and there, but if they have a good discharge disposition and managable pain, knees and hips tend to leave by Post op day 3.   The only reason why I'd ever have pain anywhere would be because of my mistakes. It is SO important to raise the bed and have a walker or an aide or PT assist when moving a patient who can't help you out too much on their own. Don't ever underestimate how independent a patient is or not- safety first for the patient and for yourself.  Our hospital has awesome surgeons who have brought with them awesome pain management techniques/courses used in the OR. Patients of a particular surgeon we have never require PRN doses of pain meds as the scheduled medication ordered tends to work well (usually scheduled oxycodone cr along with tramadol or lyrica, sometimes Celebrex). However, always expect to be on top of pain medication for patients who have those prns and are post op day 12&3. When I first started working I felt like a Dilaudid dealer.   Because of state budget cuts..our facility had become very strict with overtime and had limited us greatly. Our floor is also for colorectal gyno and urology patients, with occasional med overfill patients spilling in, so our ratio is ""1:6"". Now, Tuesday's are our orthro surgery days so those days are fine. But the rest of the week is hell. Between medicating, discharging, admitting, transferring, ambulating, I must chart on at least 9 patients a day - which is ridiculous. This is an issue our floor is currently trying to manage. I feel like my colleagues are burning out quickly, as a few just quit not that long ago. But again, that's more of an issue with the state healthcare budget cuts. If I just had 5-6 Ortho patients, I think my days would be so much smoother as most of the patients can assist in their care. Be nice to the aids and always offer to help because working as an aid for Ortho patients can be more physically grueling than it is for the nurses.  I'm a new nurse too, but I've been on my floor as a student for several rotations and have been working for a couple of months. Ortho is awesome!  Edit: Also, be conscious of post op complications such as hemorrhage or embolisms. Also, learn the different drains the different physicians use early on - it really helps when you have to assess or change anything on them."

Everyone should have to do a shift or two in the ED to gain some perspective.  There were things about the floor that were hard in a different sense from th ED but it was always a controlled difficulty.  There are nights I'm running with two ICU patients needing my full attention and three other medsurg level patients in need as well.  Some days I wish I still had the down time I had on the floors.  I also wish the nurses would stop thinking there is even a remote chance that I could hold on to patients until change of shift.  If the patient has been booked to your floor for hours and haven't come up its because I'm still waiting on orders from the MD to be written or because I have no transport to bring the patient upstairs and am trying to find someone who can.  There's so much more but I'll quit venting now, just came off an extremely hard shift where I had 6 patients all night with both my hallway assignments doubled or tripled at one point and 30 in the waiting room all shift.

nursing,3caqq3,Gringo_Ninja,2,Mon Jul 6 21:06:36 2015 UTC,"Getting hired is a matter of getting to know the people who do the hiring. Go to where you want to work, unit-wise, and speak with the nurse managers. Try to speak with them on a slower day, and just make a good impression while asking about jobs. Also, be prepared for MONTHS of waiting to get an official start date. In that time you could easily work a PRN job elsewhere to make sure you continue earning cash."

Someone who takes post op exercises seriously is going to be leaps and bounds better off than another person who doesn't care about getting better.  Simple things like breathing exercises, ambulation, taking the initiative to progressively do more without direct help are all going to work 'magic', and they all stem from the 'will to live'."
nursing,3cdcov,Sir_Ribosome,3,Wed Jul 8 02:19:45 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the setting and context.  I work on the 'medical' side of things and a positive attitude doesn't do a damn thing to change the prognosis.  It does change how the patient and others perceive the overall diagnosis and likely outcomes.  May not sound like much, but it makes a huge difference.  Some of my favorite patients are oncology with shitty prognoses.    I think this is more applicable to surgical specialties.  An otherwise healthy 40 year old that's in a MVA with multiple fx and prolonged hospital stays ultimately getting to walk again is much more likely than an EtOH cirrhosis patient w/ last drink a month ago getting a liver.  But that MVA patient will not walk again without a good attitude and motivation during rehab.  And well, a pet peeve of mine is that cancer is treated as win or lose situation.  Everyone tries to ""beat"" it, and everyone says you're gonna beat it.  But sometimes the battle just can't be won.  And that's okay. Palliative care and hospice care are wonderful tools when used and should be embraced, not feared.    Positive attitude in the face of likely defeat is incredibly brave, and humbling to others around the patient (including jaded healthcare professionals)."
nursing,3ccc0w,lapappendicectomy,10,Mon Jul 6 20:20:33 2015 UTC,"Aminophylline is a xanthine derivative, in the same drug class as caffeine and theobromine. The short version is that as a stimulant, it increases the activity of the sodium/potassium pump in cell membranes, bringing potassium out of serum and into the cells.  This is broadly similar to the way albuterol helps hyperkalemia, though they work on different receptors. Albuterol is a beta-2 receptor agonist, while aminophylline is an inhibitor of some other enzyme. Both wind up increasing the levels of a messenger chemical called cAMP. cAMP has many functions inside the cell, one of which is stimulating the activity of the Na/K pump."

nursing,3ce4m0,foxyhoxie113,7,Tue Jul 7 05:07:17 2015 UTC,"The busiest trauma ER in the country is approx 15-20% trauma, which leaves 80-85% non trauma patients. If you don't work there, even fewer of your patients will be traumas.   Old people are the most frequent utilizers of medical care and are the most likely to need assistance with bed pans. If you like busy ERs you'll likely be in an urban trauma center, which means plenty of homeless patients who need to be cleaned up. The drunks will puke everywhere. GI bleeders will shit everywhere. I've irrigated maggots out of more wounds than I can shake a stick at.  ER nursing is pretty cool but you will see more bodily fluids than you ever imagined."
nursing,3ce4m0,outrunningzombies,4,Tue Jul 7 06:44:56 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for everyone, but I feel like not many of us actually enjoy cleaning up bodily fluids or giving baths. I work in critical care, so I see people at their worst. So, most days there's a few bodily fluids involved. However, I don't feel like I even think twice about it any more. There are also great patient care assistants to help me out if I'm too busy to give a bath or toilet someone. All this being said, there are so many areas in nursing. It's a wonderful profession for this reason. You might also really like a busy ICU to keep you on your toes, or a neonatal ICU where the bodily fluids are miniature :) In regards to having time for your hobbies, I work 12 hour shifts at a 0.75 fte with every third weekend. So, I end up having off a week in a row every month. It's super nice. It's tough busting out 36 hours in three days, but worth the days off in my mind. Good luck in finding a good fit!"
nursing,3ce4m0,Barley86,2,Tue Jul 7 06:40:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you'll get over it really quick. There's so much more to nursing than cleaning up fluids/wounds and adl's but its something we still have to do for the good of our patients. Plus, you're helping people when you do these things don't forget."
nursing,3ccgw2,thatoneguy180,4,Mon Jul 6 20:54:55 2015 UTC,"First, become a nurse and work in the ICU - it's enough money (more than enough if ur single). However, it doesn't hurt to have ambitions beyond that. Second, shadow some Anesthesia providers. Just keep in the back of your head you aren't fully going to appreciate what all is going into what they are doing most of the time. The job is applied physiology and pharmacology - very knowledge based and patients require a lot of quick planning in order to optimize their anesthetic. When people ask what anesthesia really involves I like to put it like this: you are turning the body off autopilot and switching it to manual. It might look boring from the outside, but once ur in there and know what is involved that opinion will quickly fade.... I'll just leave it at that."
nursing,3ccgw2,auraseer,2,Mon Jul 6 22:48:00 2015 UTC,"Do you live a comfortable life as a single RN?   I can't speak to this from my own experience, because I'm not the only income in my house. But many of my coworkers are single, some of them are single parents, and all manage to survive on an RN salary. (This is in a large city in the Midwest. YMMV.)   Do you recommend specializing to CRNA?   I recommend you don't plan on a specialty until/unless you have actually seen that job at work, and think that's a way you would like to spend lots and lots of hours.  I went to nursing school with the original intent of becoming a CRNA, because I was thinking about dollar signs. But after I spoke to several CRNAs and educated myself about what that job entails, I decided I would be terribly bored if that's how I spent my time. And I was surprised to find that I really like being a bedside nurse, so I'm going to stay doing that for a long time.   Would you mind going over your salary and expenses?    Not putting that on the internet. Sorry.   Also would you recommend switching from RN to MD?   There's no ""switching from RN to MD.""The focus and specialization of education is quite different. If you want to be a physician, nursing is not a stepping stone on that path; it's a detour."

nursing,3ccgw2,EbagI,0,Tue Jul 7 00:10:27 2015 UTC,"Yes the salary as a RN is more than enough for a single man.   And don't do nursing for CRNA. Youre going through 3 or 4 years of nursing school. Then working at least 2 years as a rn before you can even think of crna. Everyone wants to be a crna at first. Job is super repetitive, stressful and has a very high burnout."

nursing,3ccasc,auraseer,3,Thu Jul 9 19:59:28 2015 UTC,"That depends on the nature of the violence.  In my prior career, a coworker got written up for ""violent activity"" because he beaned the manager with a Nerf ball. Technically it was a hurled object, but it wasn't meant maliciously and he didn't realize the target would fail to catch it. I wouldn't worry about something like that.  If it was a thrown punch or an assault with a weapon, I'd complain strongly to the union, the manager, the manager's boss, and every additional level of management up to the CNO if necessary. Trying to seriously hurt a coworker is one thing that should get you tossed out on your ear, full stop.  Most workplace violence falls someplace in between these extremes. What was yours?"

As soon as you feel comfortable (while you still have your preceptor) try to do as much as possible on your own (safely, of course).

Don't be the ""know it all"" orientee. Even if you are learning about something you know there may be a different way to go about it.    Ask questions. It is always better to ask a stupid question than make a stupid mistake.   That being said, try not to ask the same question over and over.   Relax. No one is expecting you to be super nurse right away. They are expecting you to be teachable and have a positive attitude.   Last pro-tip - avoid gossip like the plague. There is no benefit of speaking poorly about any of your coworkers. You don't know any of your colleagues yet and you have no idea who will go blabbing to someone else about what you said."
nursing,3cbayp,imnoteveneleven,8,Mon Jul 6 15:58:36 2015 UTC,There is no such thing as an international BSN. A BSN earned in one country is not automatically accepted or transferable to another country. You still need to meet the licensing and work visa requirements of other countries before you can work there.
nursing,3cbayp,notme1414,3,Mon Jul 6 18:19:55 2015 UTC,"Keeping this in mind, lots of schools have ""study abroad"" programs- so at my school you could potentially  study in Ireland or Australia.  Especially with BSN, and nursing licenses, look into your local schools and see what they offer.  Whatever you do, call the licensing board where you'll work most of your days and see if the program you choose is approved."
nursing,3cbayp,Sapphire_Starr,2,Mon Jul 6 18:49:38 2015 UTC,"Quick answer: You don't have many options  Long answer: Programs of study, licensing and even job duties vary heavily from country to country. It's hard to transfer from country to country due to this. There are some exceptions; Canada and the US are reasonably similar but still tons of red tape to exchange between the two. Some oil-rich middle eastern countries want western educated healthcare workers and will take Canadian/US trained and licensed RNs. Africa is pretty wide open in terms of laws (I know RNs over there that have a scope pretty close to a Doctor) but is almost exclusively volunteer d/t economic factors. These are all more exception to the rule more than anything. RNs are not a good job to go from country to country."

You could attach it to your waistband, but it gets covered by your scrub top and you can't really reach it without pulling up your top and possibly exposing your belly. You could put it in your pocket but again, it's hard to get to if your hands are full. Personally I just clip it to the vee of my top and wear a light tank top underneath so I don't expose the girls when I bend over.   On another issue: can we talk about nurses who wear scrubs that are so tight and fitted that you can see the color and design of their thong through their pants just by walking behind them? Scrubs are supposed to be comfortable, not sexy! You're supposed to be able to run in them, do chest compressions, bend over without ripping! Ugh."

nursing,3c8zd3,thenerdynurse,16,Mon Jul 6 00:42:11 2015 UTC,"This is a feature of any group that exists as a monoculture.  Look at professional sports teams for another example where this behavior is widespread.  Nurses are predominantly female, white and have an average age of 45 (higher for MSNs, 55 last I checked but that was 5 years ago).  The average nurse is a 45 year old white protestant woman, with a very tight distribution curve.  The more severe a monoculture, the worse the horizontal violence is.  Add to this a high-stress profession where profit-motivation and public health/safety are locked in an eternal sumo-wrestling match over the fate of your intervertebral muscles and you're in danger of having a bad time.  Nursing leadership is the strongest mitigating factor.  Microsystems that have problems with bullying/horizontal violence tend to have weak nurse managers (for either personal or systemic reasons).  Effective nurse managers solve this problem by recognizing it and not putting up with it."

nursing,3c8zd3,pernambuco,5,Mon Jul 6 13:11:03 2015 UTC,"Workplace culture plays such a huge role. I've worked in settings that I felt were on the two extremes of supportiveness of the workplace environment. A common thread I see is that if nurses don't feel supported by management, by doctors, and by the hospital in general, that feeds an environment where they're also not supported by each other. In contrast, if nurses feel supported by the hospital and by management, then I think they're much more apt to support each other.  Sometimes I think the culture of the unit is one where people feel the need to ""prove"" themselves. It's sad, but I think sometimes letting coworkers fall behind or not helping out is in a way feeding a desire to look better than that nurse. This is such a toxic mindset."

nursing,3c8zd3,destroyingtocreate,10,Mon Jul 6 18:22:15 2015 UTC,"My mom has been a nurse for 36 years - and growing up, she would tell me:   ""Don't give other people the answers/help because they'll take what you know + what they know, and end up with something better than what you have/get the recognition/the better grade, etc.""  I really couldn't believe her way of thinking.. But, she does kinda have a point. Not everyone has the Utilitarianism style of behavior/way of thinking (aka: the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people). Some people only use others to get ahead in their career.  The lesson she taught me is to be cautious, I suppose.  The other thing is - I feel like nurses have such a need to prove themselves/their knowledge, their expertise, and their experience and they (purposely or accidentally) put others down in the process. (In part, that's because it's actually part of their job.. they always have to know what's going on bc god forbid they have a moment of weakness which will result in a dr, a patient, a family member, a manager, or whoever yelling at you..)  But, what I'm referring to is when this issue of ""proving yourself"" transfers over to nurse-nurse or, more specifically, in the case of of ""nurses eating their young.""   Rather than being a mentor or a teacher, it seems like they forget that, they too, were once brand new nurses.. And the matter in which you approach situations makes a big difference.  Essentially, praise vs criticism/neglect/embarrassment, helping vs sink or swim.. and understanding the impact of your words and actions, knowing there is a lasting impression on your behaviors, attitudes, and words.  And like you mentioned - that's both in real life AND online.  Lastly, and perhaps most importantly nursing is a stressful job, nurses have to let off some steam, vent, whatever .. most nurses work 12 hour shifts, so you often develop some level of comfort with the people you work with - you may work well together, you may even be friends, or not - but generally speaking, there's probably a connection you have with the people you work with that you don't share with most other people. And similar to the way people ""unload"" on a good friend or spouse - nurses may do the same with other nurses because we know what it's like to have bad days, so we expect their understanding and forgiveness.  The bigger issue being when push comes to shove, you can (hopefully) set all the BS aside and know you can depend on each other as professionals to do their job."

There's a difference.   It's like choosing whether or not to tell someone about the new job on the unit they are interested in - and to top it off, you have a connection with the hiring manager ... you could put in a good word for this person, so maybe you do it - you hand deliver a letter of recommendation and tell the manager you think your friend would be a good fit for the job... blah blah.. and the nurse later does something (like personally offensive to you) that makes you think ""why the hell did I help her out?""

And honestly, any hospital and agency who would deem home health experience adequate for med/surg hospital nursing, when you don't even have the basic skills (like IV setting), are not places you want to work at or for.  I believe you are not an idiot and could pick up the skills quite easily, and home health is an admirable field, but you need a proper orientation and proper training before travel nursing."
nursing,3c9twx,NunsMockMe,2,Mon Jul 6 16:08:34 2015 UTC,"I would advise against this. An assignment is not the time to be learning your acute care skills, period. You should have these skills well in place before even considering traveling or registry nursing. Not to mention, so many times travelers and registry nurses get the worst of the worst patients assigned to them; the nurses on the floor will not have the time to help you figure things out either.   Have you considered a commute to a more rural area, simply for experience's sake, since a move is out of the question?"

And as someone who worked with a travel nurse who had only home health experience before she got a the peds med/surg job we really had to pick up the slack with her there.  In an orientation process you’ll have a preceptor who can devote time to you.  With this girl she had her own patients, I had my own patients, and everyone else had their own.  We didn’t have time to teach her how to do things, we just ended up doing them for her.  It wasn’t fair to her, us, or the patients."

That stigma being that they lose their medical assessments and nursing skills.    My biggest advice though would be to stay on your med surge unit for at least 1-2 years.  Get that much experience on your resume - that alone will open up so many opportunities  for you.  The majority of RN jobs require 1-2 years of acute care medical surgical experience - ride it out, try out other med surge floors by getting approved to float around and then decide after that much time has passed.  You may find that your feeling of being a pill dispenser only gets stronger once youre on the psyc floor and there are therapists and or psyc techs  that are being used in the role of talk therapy......

Ended up doing my first two years on a very busy tele/stepdown unit (similar to what you're describing) and was so burned out that I was literally getting physically ill. I just recently started working at a children's psych hospital that treats patients with dual diagnoses (both chronic illnesses like CF or diabetes, and behavioral issues) and I'm SOOO much happier. I'm glad I got the experience on the tele unit because it taught me a lot of things not only about nursing but about myself and just life & death, but I sort of wish I had saved myself the burn out experience and just went with my gut straight out of nursing school. I think the fact that it's child psych is important as well because I feel like there is hope for change/improvement in their quality of life.

There isn't a whole lot of patient interaction outside of routine assessments because there are plenty of techs and therapists around. I feel like I could positively impact patients in an ICU setting more than in psych. The grass is always greener though.  I think if you could stick out your current job for a minimum of a year that would benefit you in the long run if you want to continue on the critical care path.

nursing,3c71ky,ENRN,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:19:51 2015 UTC,"Northern Rhode Island, about 5 minutes from the Massachusetts line. And if you're familiar with RI, I'm only about 15-20 minutes from The capital, Providence!"
nursing,3c71ky,awleitch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:23:02 2015 UTC,Look at CCMC. I know they hire new grads - good hospital too.
nursing,3c71ky,ginnythecat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:26:13 2015 UTC,do you need peds BLS before PALS???
nursing,3c71ky,IAmANurse_BendOver,2,Tue Jul 7 13:40:39 2015 UTC,"If can't can't land a job in a PEDS ER, consider going to a PEDS floor for 6 months to a year. Any pediatric experience will look good on a resume."
nursing,3c71ky,IAmANurse_BendOver,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:34:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I was thinking a general Pedi Med surge would be my ""back up"" option, regardless the experience will only help me out :)"
nursing,3c71ky,IAmANurse_BendOver,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:34:45 2015 UTC,"Find out who the recruiter is and stay in contact with them. Try getting your foot in the door as a volunteer. Don't be discouraged if you don't land your dream job right away. Depending on where you live, it can be a really tough job market for specialties. Are you an RN? Specialties typically want you to have med-surg and acute care experience before they'll even look at your resume. Keep your head up, and your dreams high!"
nursing,3c71ky,sharloch,2,Sun Jul 5 14:58:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the encouraging words. I'm located in New England (45 min from Boston) so I certainly have plenty of competitive hospitals in my area. I will have my BSN RN within the year, I just wanted to get everything squared away so that I will be ready when I graduate and not trying to juggle all these last minute requirements and details. Will working as a CNA at a hospital on a med surge floor carry the same weight and count for my med surge experience? I apologize if it's a dumb question, I have a possible offer on the table right now to work on a med surge floor as a CNA at a local hospital and I'm considering it."
nursing,3c71ky,sharloch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:38:13 2015 UTC,"Depending on the hospital, CNA experience can help your base pay, but typically they want you to have acute RN experience before they'll hire you. It's a total catch 22 situation. (How do I get experience if nobody will hire me?) Definitely stay dedicated and don't give up if it's something you want. I worked in pediatric home care for a year before I was hired on to a medical/oncology floor at a hospital. After a year of medical/oncology experience I was able to transfer to postpartum/labor and delivery where I work now. You'll get there if you really want it. Just takes time and patience."
nursing,3c71ky,-ap,2,Mon Jul 6 14:58:33 2015 UTC,"That does make sense. I have a few hospitals near me (maybe 3 total) that hire New Grads but I figured I'll have to work up the food chain and gain experience along the away. I throughly enjoyed my maternity clinical and that opened up the door to me learning more about neonatology and then pediatrics, I had a great experience with it. As for acute RN experience, does that mean ICU, CCU, adult ER or is it more or less Med Surge?"
nursing,3c71ky,conundrum2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:26:08 2015 UTC,"Med/surg, basically anything in the hospital setting should count towards acute care experience."
nursing,3c71ky,-ap,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:32:21 2015 UTC,"My network won't allow anyone to start in the Peds ER, but after about a year in the ER they'll let nurses apply and put them through a Pedi-Boot Camp before starting there.  So if you can't get onto a Peds floor, consider starting in a traditional ER in a network that has a Peds ER (be upfront in the interview that's a goal of yours) and then get your ENPC to sweeten the chances of getting a transfer."
nursing,3c71ky,lethal_weapon_five,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:08:26 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thank you for the reply, so would you say it is easier to be accepted in the regular emergency room vs a pedi emergency room?"
nursing,3c71ky,ErisDraconequus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:39:08 2015 UTC,"It depends entirely on the hiring practices of the health network to which you apply.  My network doesn't allow new grads in the Peds ER - it's policy.  If a network DOES allow new grads into their Peds ER, however, why not apply if that's your long term goal?"
nursing,3c63si,smokingadvice,20,Sun Jul 5 04:35:34 2015 UTC,"I have only worked acute care but have had seemingly alert patients who would constantly ask to toilet when they did not have to go. (Sometimes there was a medical element to this but sometimes it was just a baseline underlying dementia.) Or they dribbled constantly so they did have to go, but it just was not feasible to toilet them every five minutes, indefinitely.  I guess that could be the other side of that story."
nursing,3c63si,opheliakitty,6,Sun Jul 5 05:14:37 2015 UTC,Apparently there is a patient on one of our floors who likes to sit on the BSC for over an hour at a time - and we have a policy that we can't leave patients alone on the BSC.  I have been told he does it just to irk the RN and make them behind on their other patients.
nursing,3c63si,grande_hohner,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:27:05 2015 UTC,Ugh he sounds awesome. Bedpan ftw!
nursing,3c63si,she2cute,2,Mon Jul 6 00:08:28 2015 UTC,Have also done acute care and we did the same thing for the same reasons. Sometimes the alternative would be them spending the day on a commode.
nursing,3c63si,_tarasbulba,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:54:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you - I think in your described case this would be appropriate care.   I'm not sure this was the case in the one I observed as the patient only made the request once during the 5 hours I was there. The SNF  has a very poor reputation already, and I am fearful that this is a symptom of a larger issue rather than a specific problem with a single nurse."
nursing,3c63si,auraseer,15,Sun Jul 5 19:16:25 2015 UTC,"If it seemed inappropriate to you, then do bring it to someone's attention. But don't be too terribly surprised if it turns out not to be a problem. Even slightly confused patients can make normal toileting unfeasible.   I've cared for a couple of patients who requested it literally constantly. Immediately on standing from the toilet, they would think they felt the urge again, and would want to go right back to the toilet. Following their requests would have been an infinite loop and they never would have made it out of the bathroom.   What we had to do was toilet then on a frequent schedule, and then if they requested it in between, we had to reorient them and remind them they had briefs on. They never actually used the briefs because their bladders were never actually full."
nursing,3c63si,Nyxpip,9,Sun Jul 5 09:51:35 2015 UTC,"I've had patients ask me to go to the toilet who are incapable of transferring or bearing enough weight in order to toilet safely. In fact when I did work at a SNF most of my patients were not strong enough to be safely transferred.  Like others have said, I could be someone that constantly has to go or asks constantly wether they have to go or not. It's very common for me at the hospital for someone to tell me they need to go but they've already gone.  They may have been confused, we get that a lot in the hospital with patients from SNFs who think they can get up and know when they have to go yo the bathroom, but don't.  But I don't know that particular resident in that specific instance, I could be wrong and the nurse was just plain wrong. Though I can say, I don't know why you'd rather clean someone up and change their daiper if they can use the toilet. Cleaning someone is more work for the nurse/CNA..."
nursing,3c63si,Idontknowidiot,7,Sun Jul 5 09:53:26 2015 UTC,"LVN/LPN here, many years experience in LTC.  I completely understand being understaffed, having confused patients, needing another staff member to assist with transfer, etc....  This response is common due to many reasons.  However, many people don't realize this is a form of mental abuse.  Even if toileting the person isn't feasible, stating out loud that the person is wearing briefs in front of other people can be humiliating.  There are other ways to handle this situation and staff needs to be educated on their options."
nursing,3c63si,conundrum2,5,Sun Jul 5 19:26:48 2015 UTC,"You don't know if they were alert or not.  They could not even remember who they are and think they have to go constantly but don't. They could have a nephrostomy or chronic foley and feel like they have to go , but it is only psychological."
nursing,3c63si,Delta3191,3,Sun Jul 5 06:43:44 2015 UTC,"Terribly inappropriate.  A massive part of aged care (in my opinion) is providing care effectively and efficiently in order to promote independence and maintain dignity to the highest level possible.   'Just go in your continence aid' is the opposite.  I get the care worker may have been busy, in that case it's how you respond that can make the difference.  'Sorry Mr Smith, I'm right in the middle of something, but I'll  send someone over/come right back. If you can't quite hold it, we have got some fresh continence aids we can help you with' sounds a hell of a lot more 'hollistic' and 'person centred'  Obviously asking them to wait isn't ideal, but I like to ensure that I (and staff working under me when I'm in charge) maintain thia dignity and independence for the patient/client/resident... Person.  I feel that you should address this with the facility. As an outside person watching care provided, you'll often see things we miss or think little of because we're either busy or caught up in a particular way of doing something."
nursing,3c63si,zeatherz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:33:24 2015 UTC,"The only justification I could come up with for this is if the person requires a mechanical lift/ hoyer for transfer. Its often not possible to maneuver those into a bathroom. But opheliakitty could also be correct, some people will ask for the toilet every five minutes.  Barring those two situations, this was am absolutely unacceptable thing for the nurse/CNA to do."
nursing,3c63si,sparksy1337,-2,Sun Jul 5 06:21:10 2015 UTC,"I would never have allowed this to happen when I worked at a SNF.  If the patient is alert enough to ask, they need to be taken.  That place is their home, and it needs to feel like home as much as possible.  They call the shots (assuming they're 'with it' enough to do so).  Besides, if the nurse (or CNA) has time to clean him up, then they have to put him on the toilet.  Telling someone to mess on themselves when they ask to go to the toilet is, in my opinion, very degrading."
nursing,3c63si,she2cute,-15,Sun Jul 5 05:04:19 2015 UTC,"I'd report it. Regardless of whether the patient was wearing a diaper or not, it was a request and the nurse or nurses aid should have assisted the patient to the bathroom."
nursing,3c63si,auraseer,3,Sun Jul 5 04:51:34 2015 UTC,"Even for a patient who doesn't remember they just returned from the bathroom? Even for a patient who has already been to the bathroom three times this hour, with no output?   Even for a confused patient who requests the bathroom every time he sees a staff member? (A coworker once had a patient with expressive aphasia, who kept repeating that he needed the bathroom even while he was actually sitting on the toilet.)  You're correct that OP should report it, because she doesn't know the situation. But you don't know the situation either, so you can't say for sure what should have been done."
nursing,3c63si,she2cute,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:44:19 2015 UTC,"In the case of constant reminders, I'd remind them that they just used the bathroom and ask them if they are sure. If they still needed to go, then whatever. Put them on the pan and be done with it! Put yourself in their position. I realise we don't know the whole situation, but the fact of the matter is that if someone is shot down for asking to go to the bathroom when it's obvious they can get up and to do it in their diaper? Ridiculous reasoning."
nursing,3c63si,tanukisuit,2,Mon Jul 6 00:00:01 2015 UTC,What if you have 12 LTC patients and 6 of them need help with using the bathroom throughout your shift? And what if all of them have meds due and treatments needed?
nursing,3c63si,she2cute,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:32:05 2015 UTC,Kill two birds with one stone?
nursing,3c63si,ENRN,6,Mon Jul 6 14:18:55 2015 UTC,Oh someone's new!
nursing,3c63si,she2cute,-2,Sun Jul 5 12:02:53 2015 UTC,"Not new here. Just a nurse who has an actual heart? How could anyone say that to a patient that asks to go to the bathroom. Totally inappropriate! Down vote me all you want, but that's wrong and you all know it."
nursing,3c63si,ENRN,4,Sun Jul 5 14:32:04 2015 UTC,"In many situations yes - there are exemptions, but the real issue is the chronic understaffing of SNF."
nursing,3c63si,she2cute,0,Sun Jul 5 16:05:28 2015 UTC,I agree that snf's are understaffed. Major issue.
nursing,3c63si,naranja_sanguina,2,Mon Jul 6 00:02:02 2015 UTC,What? You've never had a patient who was confused and/or so weak that s/he can't bear weight to sit safely on the toilet? Your clinicals were clearly not on the same floor as mine.
nursing,3c63si,she2cute,-2,Sun Jul 5 16:25:31 2015 UTC,"I worked on a level 1 trauma floor for 8 years and an acute care unit for the elderly for 1 year and clinical on both. I've since worked in an intermediate care unit which provides medical and pulmonary care, ccu, micu and surgical oncology as well as a peds unit. I've never once said that to a patient, even if they were confused or had a foley."
nursing,3c63si,naranja_sanguina,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:55:41 2015 UTC,"Okay, so, as the rare nurse who actually has a heart or whatever, what do you say? (Not suggesting that the verbatim response in the OP is great, just wondering how we could make this discussion constructive!)"
nursing,3c63si,she2cute,0,Mon Jul 6 03:48:20 2015 UTC,"Nothing needs to be said other than, ok, let me help you. If the patient is saying it all the time and I'm already working on a task ( like a bunch of others have said), I'd nicely tell them that I will be glad to help you the second I finish passing this medication or whatever to whomever. I wouldn't have said anything along the lines of ""go in your diaper and I'll clean you up."" That is uncalled for especially in a room full of other people! There shouldn't even be a discussion about this."
nursing,3c63si,naranja_sanguina,2,Mon Jul 6 14:26:20 2015 UTC,"My question is what you tell a patient on bedrest who gets upset if you say you'll help them onto the pan, not a patient who can reasonably be helped to the bathroom."
nursing,3c63si,she2cute,2,Mon Jul 6 14:30:51 2015 UTC,"Ah. I frequently have patients that can't get up because they're unstable. I simply put it that way. I apologize to them and simply state that they're not stable enough to get up just yet but the minute they are stable, I'd be more than happy to help them get up, until then, we need to use a bedpan. About 99% of the time, they are okay with it."
nursing,3c63si,she2cute,2,Tue Jul 7 02:16:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your advice. I know it's not a popular one, but I appreciate the perspective. The SNF has a very poor rating already (and the parent company was sued for several million a few years ago for negligence), and I fear that this is a symptom of a bigger issue rather than an individual nursing problem."
nursing,3c813u,BeatrixKidd,29,Sun Jul 5 19:38:08 2015 UTC,"Since you ask: No, it does not. Strong research shows that aromatherapy is no more effective than placebo for the vast majority of indications.  The one thing it does help with is relief of stress and anxiety. But that is not due to any special properties of the specific oils chosen. Stress and anxiety are decreased when the environment is made more comfortable, which includes pleasant odors, as well as controlling noise and light levels and so on.  Since you're in nursing school, you should be learning to base your practice on scientific evidence, not on blog posts and pseudoscience.  Edit: Downvoting me doesn't make me any less correct."
nursing,3c813u,auraseer,8,Sun Jul 5 20:23:04 2015 UTC,"Again, a great unbiased source.  They are affiliated with dōTERRA.  This is what pops up when you Google them: ""dōTERRA provides therapeutic-grade essential oils and wellness products to people who care about improving their health and that of their loved ones.""  That's no different that a drug rep telling me their new miracle drug is great.  I am almost guarantee you'd roll your eyes at a drug rep doing that."
nursing,3c813u,justatouchcrazy,6,Sun Jul 5 22:32:37 2015 UTC,"It would be different if you come in posting things like that link.  While there might still be some issues with that article it's at least in a (I assume) peer reviewed journal with references and solid methods.  Posting blog posts or personal experiences about any topic beyond those not researched (things like IV techniques for example) rarely goes over well here, because nursing is/should be evidence based using legitimate sources.  Even a cited blog post is rarely legitimate evidence.  This is especially important if you are discussing something that's not mainstream and does have a lot of mixed, refuted, or heavily biased research and statements behind it.  That doesn't necessarily mean that it's not legit and useful, but a lot of the people that advocate for aromatherapy are similar to those pushing other crazy or fringe stances, so that creates a prejudice.   Other subreddits don't have the same expectation for statements to be backed up and cited.  /r/nursing, /r/medicine, etc. are exceptions and shouldn't be approached the same as another sub.  When I post in other subs, like my other frequent sub /r/hockey, I just post whatever.  However, here I try to re-read everything I post and ensure that my statements are semi-coherent and either evidence based (and cited) or clearly state that I have no proof but it seems to work."
nursing,3c813u,justatouchcrazy,-1,Sun Jul 5 22:43:26 2015 UTC,Blog posts and personal stories are what get the conversation started. It gives me a sense of community to read nursing blogs.

nursing,3c813u,justatouchcrazy,2,Mon Jul 6 12:57:45 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not implying anything. I am explicitly saying it. Aromatherapy is pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo, and if you ""swear by"" that, then you do not follow evidence-based practice."

nursing,3c813u,blockmomNC,2,Mon Jul 6 13:48:27 2015 UTC,"The journal you first cite (Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine) is explicitly biased in favor of promoting this subject matter as its raison d'être. Further, its impact factor is only 1.8, which ranks in the bottom third of all journals published worldwide. That combination is not one to inspire confidence or demand acceptance. To put it another way: I yawned so hard, my tonsils have sunburn.  Your second link is just a Google search. Many of the results are articles refuting the effectiveness of aromatherapy. (See e.g. the first result, where the phrase ""no statistically significant difference"" makes a prominent appearance.) I'm not going to dig through the list of results for articles that support you, because that's your job. If you yourself aren't able to pick out any strong articles supporting your claim, then it probably isn't a very good claim."

I'm not opposed to things like aromatherapy, after all the placebo effect is real and the anxiolysis it valuable, but to think they can replace real medicine for actual medical disease states is a bit of a stretch."
nursing,3c813u,auraseer,2,Mon Jul 6 16:16:52 2015 UTC,"The placebo effect is still an effect.  People do all sorts of strange things that aren't effective (more effective than placebo).  As long as it isn't actively harming them and as long as it isn't replacing actual effective therapy, it's more constructive to humor them than to rain on their parades.  The psycho-neuro-immune pathway is a real thing!"

Long story short I am an Er nurse of over 28 yrs and had Cdiff from Jan 2015 until June 2015. I took months of Flagyl & po Vancomycin --yuck with no improvement until I tried essential oils internally. Oregano and Melaluca ( tea tree oil) 2xa day in a veggie cap with probiotics by mouth. 3days later I felt better, a couple of weeks later I finally tested negative for Cdiff !! So I know they work.

Note that ""true scientific evidence"" means a peer-reviewed study in a reputable journal (not Aromatherapist Monthly), which has not been retracted by the author nor refuted by attempts at replication.   Since you have founded a career and a business on this idea, I expect you have a huge stock of supporting research citations ready to hand. Right?"

When you hit adulthood and are on your own with your own career its time to say, ""fuck all that shit!"". If you have a rude roommate, move out or give them the boot. If your job sucks ass and you hate it, go get a new one in a better city, or a more interesting field. Its your life and you're in the driver seat.

On the other hand, I know for a fact that having Hopkins on my resume has gotten me jobs over other RN's. Baltimore is fairly unique in that there are TONS of really great hospitals in one small region. Don't limit yourself! Look into Sheppard Pratt for sure, too."
nursing,3c4aa7,elemen1186,2,Sun Jul 5 04:04:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Hopkins is a great resume builder and they know it so the pay will probably always suck."
nursing,3c4aa7,nt2014,2,Sun Jul 5 18:09:35 2015 UTC,It's true for anything you do at Hopkins. My sister does research and was offered a position at Hopkins and one at UMD at the same time and Hopkins offered 25% less pay and worse benefits.

nursing,3c4aa7,ENRN,25,Sun Jul 5 21:34:41 2015 UTC,"Likely you will need a BSN. These hospitals typically won't hire an ADN, especially with such a small amount of experience.   Also please be warned, big name hospitals are not the holy grail of nursing or healthcare. Same amount of problems, just not usually due to not having enough money."
nursing,3c4aa7,KzaRza,8,Sat Jul 4 17:18:52 2015 UTC,I'm a psych nurse at Hopkins. They would need you to at least be enrolled in a BSN program by the time of your start date if you were to be hired.

Obviously, I'm biased, but I thought it was a) a beautiful hospital and b) every staff member was so caring and professional.  My mom was pregnant with my sister at the time, and when we got there the staff were so kind to her and seemed to look after a panicky pregnant lady visitor of a patient as much as they were looking after my dad.  So... yeah, OP! Check out this hospital!"

I would fast track to a BSN completion program, and then start looking for jobs - or explore what positions might hire you on the condition that you complete your BSN within a number of years.   I would look at UMMC.  They have fantastic tuition reimbursement."

That said, if you've been able to complete all your work and new orders go in for a UA, or blood cultures or something like that it is a huge help to the next shift if you're able to knock those out real quick, and I know your coworkers will appreciate it.   Nothing sucks more than walking in and finding out, oh and also the MD's just ordered blood cultures, a UA, ET aspirate, a nasal swab and they want the NG to be advanced to post pyloric.. On top of your AM meds, safety checks and all the other usual tasks you have to perform.  Nursing is absolutely a 24 hour job, but if you've got the time, hook your coworkers up!"

nursing,3c57bn,mizanona,2,Sat Jul 4 22:17:30 2015 UTC,"I did a combined non-BSN/MSN program similar to the one you are doing. My background in in behavioral psychology. The program I did focused on FNP rather than PMHNP for the MSN portion.   I cannot speak for the job availability in NYC vs CA because I am not from either of those areas. From my personal experience, I can say: 1) I found a job in a city I had no connections in 100 miles from where I lived/studied because I moved there for a relationship. It wasn't easy and it required a couple of months of networking beyond just applying for jobs. That is how I landed my first RN position out of school. 2) Making connections for me was attending conferences, associations for my particular focus of nursing (emergency nurses association, for example), and speaking to several nurses there to make a 'connection'. I let people know there that I had recently graduated, was new the area, and was applying/looking for jobs. That is how I got my foot in the door for a job interview. 3) I started with the non-BSN to DNP route and changed my degree plan to the MSN shortly before completing the BSN because of the length of the DNP program. Eventually, I will probably go back and complete the DNP, but currently I do not see the benefit of the degree for me at this time. While I think the DNP as the standard of education for a nurse practitioner will come, I do not think it will be next year (or three). I do not think it will make you unemployable. You have enough to think about.  Try to get through the BSN portion. I began the non-BSN to DNP program with a total of 8 people. 3 people stopped after the BSN portion, 1 (me) switched to MSN, 1 switched to nursing PhD, and 3 went straight through to complete the DNP (an additional two years). My school has since discontinued that program entirely."

Some new grads are having difficulty with finding a job others not because of good networking, working as a tech on their unit, or just luck. Took a friend (new grad) about 6 months to get a job and her first job is in the burbs. A coworkers sister (new grad) took about 9 months to get their first job. If you're not ultra picky, it will be easier. If you've got a year or two of experience, it shouldn't be difficult at all. Also, BSN will be essentially required for the big name hospitals as another poster pointed out that most of the big ones are magnet."
nursing,3c49lj,FrauKoko,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:58:44 2015 UTC,What would be considered good networking for someone like me who is coming from another state?
nursing,3c49lj,FrauKoko,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:10:12 2015 UTC,"From afar it will certainly be more difficult. But once you're applying for jobs keep those recruiters close. Ask them if they know of any other positions that might be a good fit.  If you have any friends here, get names of management so you can email directly.   Your nursing school instructors may have contacts across the US that you might be able to tap into. One girl in my program moved to another city and was able to get in through a contact from one of our instructors. Or maybe a friend has a cousin or other family members in the city that can help you out.   If your school has a resume service, use it. Have your instructors help you if you didn't have a class or assignment on building a resume. Many of the larger hospitals use filters to sort out the resumes before it even gets to the recruiter. You need to have keywords in your resume and cover letter so the computer will flag it as good. New grad resumes are tough because you have no experience outside of clinicals.  So how can you stand out from hundreds of people like you but not look arrogant? Make it short but powerful. Capitalize on unique experiences.  Did you study abroad, volunteer with a medical mission or red cross, or were a manager at your previous job? Things that not everyone has but can also be applied to nursing or make you a more well rounded person.   Just keep your head up and do the best you can. Ask for feedback from positions you're turned down for. It's not impossible to get a job right out of the gate but it will be certainly more difficult from afar. It's really quite variable on how long or easy it is to land a job as a new grad here. The more picky you are the more difficult it will be. Doesn't mean you won't land that dream job, just be patient because it may take a little longer. Good luck!  What time frame are you looking at for graduation and moving?"

I applied everywhere in the city and suburbs. I was actually a student tech at a big hospital while in nursing school but that didn't really help me secure a job because the hospital I worked at had a hiring freeze. It is so difficult for new grads because they constantly want people who have experience. I went through 3 interviews at the time and the reason I got rejected was because I didn't have experience. If you apply to small community hospitals or SNF/LTC facilities it's easier. I almost settled for an SNF position but decided to turn it down and a month later I finally landed a new grad residency position in the city! I had a lot of experience with applying and interviewing so if you have more questions feel free to ask! Also, if you are serious about moving here to work you should take your NCLEX here so you don't have to wait to endorse it from Oklahoma. Good luck!"
nursing,3c49lj,ClimbingRhino,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:51:01 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of teaching hospitals that will readily take on new grads assuming you come from a reputable school, have good grades, and have good clinical/hospital experience. Almost every hospital in the city is a magnet hospital and a Trauma I hospital. What area of nursing are you looking to go into? That will have a big impact. Often it is easier to start in the suburbs with a job and then get into a city hospital after gaining some experience. Getting in with the Advocate Health Care system can be beneficial as it is the largest in the state and has many different hospitals offering many different things.  I'm a nursing student in Chicago and currently work as a CNA in the city so PM me if you have any more questions."

nursing,3c2fsk,handledgrenades,9,Sat Jul 4 03:26:23 2015 UTC,"Oh. I should probably chime in here as I'm former infantry making the transition to nursing but it's about 2:00 AM on America's fucking birthday and I'm not 100% sober. Damn.  So.   I don't think ER = combat. My experiences in the ER are pretty limited but ""it's not your emergency"". Also, many of the patients that present to the ER aren't emergencies in any sense of the word. It also will depend on where you work, as civilian hospitals (as you may know) aren't all equal in terms of their ability to handle trauma, and patients are transported to the most appropriate facility. Also barring a gunman in the ER you're going home in one piece at the end of the day, to your actual house - with a shower and bathroom and everything - so there's that. BSN is basically the future of nursing, particularly in for the sort of environment you want to work in. Others are probably going to tell you that getting an ASN and doing an RN to BSN course online or something is an alternative. It is, maybe, but the GI Bill will cover the entire BSN and of course you will get your monthly stipend and textbook money. If you're sure it's what you want I'd go straight for the BSN. Actually getting the GI Bill benefits is surprisingly easy compared to the massive amount of bullshit paperwork you are used to in the Army. Basically you turn in a form once per semester and money magically appears. It's great. It's no secret but BSN programs can be competitive to get in to. I took some pre-reqs with a former Army 68W and he ended up switching majors. Don't underestimate the coursework! It's very doable though. If you did ten years in a non-dumbass MOS I'm sure you're up for it. I can barely read and I'm fine.   I assume you are an older male. Basically, no one will care, which is nice, if that's of concern to you.   I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. Best of luck!  America."

I find that my military experience greatly helps me triage my care when time is short.  I also find the work to be very therapeutic. I don't regret my service, but I want to be responsible for more healing than suffering in this world, and working as a nurse allows me to do that.  I suggest all prospective nurses work for a few months as a CNA. In that role you will be exposed to the career of your choice with a minimum financial investment. You can get a CNA license in two weeks. You will also know what your subordinates are dealing with, having experienced it yourself.  Finally, look into financial assistance. You qualify for a lot as a vet, and nursing scholarships and grants will pay most of the costs if you're savvy in the system."

I'm still pretty new and only been in 3 years as an RN and I look up to a lot of prior enlisted guys turned officers with their wealth of information and even know a special forces guy that decided to switch over. You could go to the Emergency Nurse Course after a few years being med surg and if you want you could even stay mostly in the hospital environment if you are tired of being out in the field.
nursing,3c2fsk,Raisedshoulder,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:42:11 2015 UTC,"You're an Army RN? I've asked quite a few people about this already, but do you know anything about Army nurses being used for en-route critical care, as in on a Blackhawk in theater?  The Army did a study in like 2010-2011 and found that 68Ws weren't able to care for critical patients, so they put a bunch of nurses on Blackhawks. They have since changed flight medic training.  Do you know anything about what role, if any, nurses are filling now? I know they can still go to the en-route critical care course but I don't know if they are being used operationally."
nursing,3c2fsk,Bookholder,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:46:38 2015 UTC,Currently I've heard they haven't been used much in Blackhawks just because of the draw downs but I have met nurses in the past that did do that. I have seen some positions for 160th SOAR on the HRC website however I don't know the specifics of what they do. I've read requirements to join them are Airbourne school and deployment on dustoffs and they make you go through all of the other schools required to be a part of special operations like SERE and such. If you decide to go this route you have a huge leg up over other nurses. Most nurses in the Nurse Corps don't know much about big Army. Many don't even know what PMCS stands for.  There are tons of roles nurses can take in the Army. You could just stick with bedside and work your way up as a OIC of a ward to OIC of a section and even a hospital commander. You could also specialize into other fields like psych or ICU or Emergency. You could also stay med surg and be a brigade nurse where you help the PA manage medical trainings and such for a line unit. Just the first few years are gonna suck because they want you to stay regular bedside med surg nurse. You could also go to graduate school and become an NP or Nurse Anesthetist but that pretty much guarantees you won't see the field too much.

nursing,3c2fsk,Raisedshoulder,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:35:34 2015 UTC,"I want to assume that working in an ER would have a similar type of stress as combat   Though I have no military experience, I venture to say this is very unlikely. The ED isn't anywhere near as bad as that.  Stress in the ED is over doing our job well. We are very busy, we do multiple things at a time, and we are responsible for completing lots of tasks and monitoring lots of information. That sort of thing is stressful. But we're not being shot at, and we have every expectation of going home safely at the end of the shift.  Certainly we see some patients who become aggressive because they are drunk, psychotic, or otherwise disoriented, but not as a steady diet. Those patients are a minority, and when they do show up, ED staff has all the numbers and resources to restrain them for their own safety and ours.   What is the most cost effective way to get into the field?   This depends on what schools near you cost, how long the available programs will take, and whether you plan to keep working during school.  For instance if you're not working during school, then a shorter program is better. (Every year you spend in school effectively ""costs"" you the year's salary that you didn't earn.) If you will be working during school, then shorter might still be better-- but then again a shorter program might involve more hours per week, preventing you from holding down the job you want.  Some people's best solution is to go to community college for an ADN, start work as a nurse, and then get their BSN sometime afterward. Others do best by going straight to the bachelors, in any of various ways. We don't know enough about your situation to tell you which boat you're in.   what noteworthy advice about studying/nursing that isn't common knowledge   This might be common knowledge, but: Go shadow a nurse. I suggest this to every aspiring RN because it's the best way I know to get a look at exactly what the job entails."
nursing,3c2fsk,auraseer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:37:05 2015 UTC,"Prior Army, used the GI Bill, so I'm gonna weigh in on #2 and #3.  2 - I got my ADN.  This worked for me because 1) I'm in a rural area where ADNs are hired into hospitals, with very limited numbers of BSNs to compete against and 2) I have wife/kids and I needed to be able to start working sooner rather than later.  If you are not somewhere where ADNs get hired, or you can afford to go for the BSN now, then do it.  With that said, the GI Bill is going to cover all but my last semester of my RN-BSN program.  3 - Financially, just remember that the GI Bill does not count as financial aid, so, if needed, Pell Grants and student loans are options on top of your GI Bill stipend.    Lastly, bring copies of your DD214 to every interview, nursing school and beyond.  Proof that you can follow orders really does set you above a lot of others trying for the same positions."

I was always told too that second degree students could get away with a 2 page resume (which I did and got away with).   3) It's too wordy to parse out ""4th semester...."" All employers will know which clinicals you did. I organized mine like,  - Women’s Health: Labor and Delivery/Postpartum (Floor 8, XXX Hospital).  - Psychiatric: Adult/Intensive/Emergency (Floor 3, XXX Hospital)  If that's helpful to you. Just get to the meat of where you did your clinicals.   4) Show off that management experience! You have a great work history compared to a majority of new grads who haven't held a full time job yet.   Edit: Formatting"
nursing,3c2lw3,half-great-adventure,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:43:12 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your input! I do have one question for ya... This particular resume is geared towards a med-surge floor. Should I still include my OB/GYN and Psych clinical experience as well?
nursing,3c2lw3,half-great-adventure,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:11:54 2015 UTC,Can't hurt. I had all my clinicals listed on my resume.
nursing,3c2lw3,destroyingtocreate,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:15:27 2015 UTC,"Here's my two cents..   I more or less agree with /u/half-great-adventure about the summary, it's too wordy - however, I wouldn't completely take it out. I would change ""Summary"" to ""Objective"" and state something that's more to-the-point. For example:  Objective  ""Qualified Registered Nurse seeking acute care position/position on the ZYZ Unit at Hospital USA where I will function as a healthcare professional and expand on my knowledge, skills, and experience.""  And as /u/half-great-adventure pointed out, you can expand on your ""summary"" in your cover letter.  But, don't forget that your CL and Resume both may need to be altered based on which hospital and/or which position you're applying to.   After your objective, I would list in this order your:   Education License/Certifications ALL clinical rotation sites you had in nursing school (in order of relevance as opposed to chronological order.. meaning, if you're applying for an L&D job, list your Maternity experience first, followed by Pediatrics, then Medical-Surgical, and so on.) also list the hours per each clinical.  Clinical skills/training (H&P, Vitals, Meds, IV starts, Foley Caths, NGT, ... charting .. communication .. delegation .. etc.)  Work history/Volunteerism  References (name/who they are to you, e.g. senior nursing professor, phone number, and email)    Beyond that.. I would also maybe consider changing your format to be more visually attractive..   Edit: Punctuation"
nursing,3c2lw3,jennafezz,2,Mon Jul 6 00:32:13 2015 UTC,"i would get rid of the summary. i also wouldn't list every route of med when you say med administration, i think some things are just automatically understood about nursing school. also, bls has it's own line but acls and pals are combined into one line? stay consistent! good luck :)"

nursing,3c2lw3,non_nahs,2,Sat Jul 4 16:04:02 2015 UTC,"A few things that would be helpful:  Left align your headings. Putting them in the center makes it look crowded. Consider increasing your spacing and making this into 2 pages  Break your Skills    Summary/ Clinical  Experience into two separate sections and make them bulleted lists. Change ""Skills Summary"" to ""Accomplishments"" and phrase them like ""Mastered xyz by completing abc...""  Add more spacing between headings and text and after a section. After that share again."

I had one patient who wouldn't talk, except to tell you she hoped you'd get raped and die.   So it was either commit elder abuse (zero tolerance for that shit) or learn to shut your brain off.

nursing,3c04fv,FearAndLoafing,2,Sat Jul 4 02:17:51 2015 UTC,"In my experience, the patients who become violent (hitters, spitters and biters) or have the emotional outbursts (screaming, hysterical crying or just plain rage) usually have underlying mental health issues or have absolutely zero stimulation (no visitors, not able to participate in outings).   I had one pt who is partially blind with advanced dementia. She refuses to participate in group activities (getting her hair done, going to religious services), has zero interest in television or music. She has no living relatives so she really receives no visitors. Absolutely everything that works with other patients seems to agitate her. Honestly, the only time she's happy and smiling is when she has staff catering to her (bathing, changing and transport) and she gets a chance to pinch one of us."
nursing,3c04fv,whoatethekidsthen,2,Sat Jul 4 04:36:53 2015 UTC,"That's a great attitude. I had mentioned this previously but for some reason, this particular patient and her story really got under my skin."
nursing,3c04fv,SwanInThePond,10,Fri Jul 3 20:55:34 2015 UTC,"Hey there. I feel for you. It's not easy! I graduated in 2008 and in Southern California it was extremely challenging to get a job as a new grad, so long story short I accepted a position on a med/surg/onc floor with a twist... They were all state or federal prisoners. I wasn't happy about it as this was a million miles away from what I envisioned myself doing as a nurse but I stayed for almost two years. We weren't suppose to know their crimes (although if you asked any of the correctional officers they would tell you) and I think this made it much easier for me. (Very different from your situation!)   My advice? The only real thing I can say that helped me is to just keep reminding myself over and over again that these are really sick individuals, and I don't mean what they are there to be treated for... These are people who all have on one level or another some severe mental illnesses, regardless of whether or not they've ever been diagnosed... Whether it's addiction, sociopathy, PTSD, bipolar, pedophilia, etc... They are incredibly sick and even if they thought they were big and bad gang bangers I just looked at them as utterly pathetic. I guess in this way, I was still able to tap into some weird sort of empathy for them, if that makes sense.  I was always respectful but it's also important to establish firm boundaries, as with these personality types they want to manipulate. An example of how I would have handled the question about who would pay for her hospital stay, ""I'm not sure. I'm here to address your medical needs only. Any other concerns you have need to be discussed with the correctional staff from your prison."" End of conversation. The one positive with taking care of this kind of patient is that you really don't have to worry about HCAHPS scores or any other ""customer service"" BS.   Also, she has full time correctional officers with her from the prison, correct? Make friends with them, insure a relationship of mutual respect. If they are good COs, they should be worried about your safety. If you encounter a situation or conversation with this patient that makes you uncomfortable or you're not sure if you handled it well, ask for their input. The good ones will treat prisoners with respect but as I mentioned before, have really well set boundaries and not out up with any BS.   Since you have the option on your unit (and they aren't all prisoners) you need to rotate this patient amongst all staff.   Good luck!"

I work with individuals who have done pretty awful things and were considered insane and so went through the mental health system instead of jail. I also have lots of clients who have very hostile personalities or have a very unsavory belief like they're racist or misogynistic.   I am pleasant with all of them as long as they are respectful and pleasant with me. If they push boundaries by trying to engage in a discussion about something inappropriate or use j appropriate language, as a mental health nurse, it's part of my job to shut that shit down and set healthy boundaries. Partially it's to help them learn how to engage appropriately in society but also its to protect myself. If we don't set boundaries, some clients will keep pushing and do something even more inappropriate if they sense they can get away with it. Basically I work with a lot of folks with borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder."

I usually give a quick excuse of a severe situation I must attend to or ask someone else that is available to help with the situation.

No joke, I spent 7 months boiling every god damn bottle of water. I would have paid for a 0.2 micron water filter. MSR makes them, platypus makes them. They run about $70-$100 but it will seriously save your life. I cannot express how frustrating it was to be so thirsty and not be able to drink because the water was still too hot. I was constantly planning ahead.  Another awesome pickup would be a kindle. Things move in slow motion while abroad, in certain places. Some places with lots of people can be interesting but if theres a language barrier it can be tough. I read a ton of books. Its not to say I didn't interact with the locals, of course I did. That said, its nice to be able to lay back and dig into a good book in your down time.  These gifts are a bit pricey, but I wish I had brought both of these things with me. Headlamp was another good suggestion. We had the power go out in the OR one time, we closed the case by headlamp."

nursing,3bwy7m,Debtastical,5,Sat Jul 4 18:37:43 2015 UTC,"Throughout most of my career, I thought of quality of life, but defined quality to my own standard of what that word meant. But, that is riddled with problems because the word ""quality"" is so subjective. While having the health care proxy discussion with my husband, and really flushing out our values, we had come to different conclusions about our end of life scenarios. Not completely different, but different enough that it was pretty surprising to me. Then opening the conversation further with our family, we discovered that the term ""quality"" had variations from each individual.  Some folks truly value a beating heart as life (vitalists), and don't really define the concept of quality. For me, this was a slippery slope into believing in miracles....which is a discussion in and of itself.  Anyways, I can think of several patients I have cared for that were being subjected to care that was in stark contrast to my personal beliefs; where my co-workers and I have felt that ""torturing"" feeling that is often mentioned within the ethics of critical care. Where everything seemed futile (and it most cases it was). But, to the patients, and by extension their families, trying ""everything"" was what needed to happen, and perhaps that is quality to them.  Either way, there are some situations that are just heart breaking, and for that, I think that we need to do better at supporting each other when we work with these kind of ""morally gray"" or ethically challenging patients.   If you ever have the opportunity to have one of these conversations with an ethicist or with a palliative care provider, I suggest it. The lessons they can teach are so helpful."
nursing,3bwy7m,mspatria,5,Thu Jul 2 21:50:06 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what we as nurses value more. It matters what our patients value more. As long as a patient is making an informed and un-pressured decision, my values don't really enter into the equation. Even when you think a family or the medical team is pushing too far, you are there to be an advocate for the patient, not for your own values. It's all about getting to know your patients as much as is possible, so that you can better understand what their needs and wishes are."

nursing,3bwy7m,defiantgrit,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:08:23 2015 UTC,"It's not a different story, at all. ICU beds are limited. Organs are limited. Finances are limited. It's not that we would impose, as professionals, it's that reality will impose. Sometimes it also becomes necessary to triage, and that absolutely has us making critical decisions for the patient via translating reality."
nursing,3bwy7m,ticklesthemagnificen,8,Sat Jul 4 02:39:00 2015 UTC,"Quality. I'd doubt you'd find many nurses who would choose just to live. There are nightmare scenarios for me where I don't recognize myself, family, friends, have had multiple debilitating conditions (cancers, CVAs/TIAs). Cannot move, laugh. Sit in my own excrement, and am a burden. My family decides to let me live my days out with a peg tube because I can't feed myself. Multiple readmissions to the hospital later I finally succumb to a bout with sepsis from pneumonia or a UTI or an infection from my PEG tube.   I don't know why we see this as a reality for our patients regardless of their age. I think it should be perfectly legal and encouraged to speak of comfort measures the moment a feeding tube has to be placed unless that person is otherwise ambulatory, independent, and alert and needs it to live. But if they are mostly bed bound and unaware of their surroundings, comfort measures should be thoroughly discussed before the PEG is placed."
nursing,3bwy7m,nursebeast,3,Thu Jul 2 21:40:54 2015 UTC,"I think, especially in Canada there needs to be way more education on goals of care, end of life planning and DNR. Of note is how many more medical professionals have AD compared to the public at large."

nursing,3bwy7m,Liv-Julia,8,Fri Jul 3 18:24:07 2015 UTC,This is an impossible question.  There's such a balance between the quantity and quality of life for the best outcomes which is all highly individualized.  RNs and all healthcare professionals rarely judge what a patient decides to do in these situations where quality and quantity are dependent on each other. We occasionally groan when family of pts make what appears to be selfish choices.  This is why everyone should have a living will/advance directives. It's incredibly emotional time and pts families may not make choices that are congruent with the patient.

nursing,3bwy7m,AbsurdKibbles,2,Thu Jul 2 23:50:35 2015 UTC,"This is such an existential question that I could write a 20 page paper on what quality of life even is let alone at what point is it worth dying instead of living. However if you want thoughts then I can give you some from my perspective.  I work on a Burn ICU and I feel very fortunate that I work with a great staff to include the primary medical staff, nurses, PT/OT, and social workers. This struggle between quality of life versus life comes up pretty frequently with large burns, moderate burns on the elderly, and burns with concurrent medical conditions (COPD'er with substantial inhalation injuries) and its a hard thing to figure out.   Burn treatment can go on for months in the hospital and years outside of the hospital and the outcomes can be so varied that its hard to know what someones quality of life will be at the end. So we do our best to talk with the family and give them our best guess at the chance of survival, what the treatment will be like (painful), and the long term risks and results of treating burns.  We had a patient who was with us for months, suffered multiple complications, and required extensive surgery's with skin grafts. And at the end of the day he made a pretty full recovery, was up and walking/talking, and the family was incredibly grateful to still be able to have the patient in their lives. So overall, even though their were some pretty extensive life saving measures taken and quality of life seemed pretty low at times, they ended up recovering and I'd argue that they have a pretty good quality of life right now despite the injuries. So I'd say life was clearly the right choice in hindsight.  On the flip side I've seen modern medicine keep someone alive way longer than they should have been because the family cant let go. The staff all know that this person is basically slowly dying as they see each organ slowly start to fail but they have machines that can keep them alive and the family wants us to use them regardless of the quality of life. This person suffered some pretty serious inhalation burns along with 35% TBSA burns while having close to end stage COPD. We could never take him off the ventilator, he was constantly feeling short of breath when he was conscious, and at the end of the day a blood clot got him. So I'd argue that quality of life should have been the deciding factor.  So its not black or white, its grey and until we can tell the future we just have to do our best to create the best possible outcomes while also being aware of when we are just treading water in the ocean.  I think the biggest issue I've seen related to this isn't that people can't understand that quality of life is important but that no one wants to have the conversation when its clear that we are no longer saving a life but prolonging a death."

Those people are bed bound, have to be in diapers all day, and are usually confused about when or where they are.   I used to have a patient whose legs were paralyzed, barely knew how to eat, would sometimes try to eat dish cloths and plates, didn't understand a word I said other than her name, and would occasionally start sobbing for no discernible reason whatsoever. The daughter always insisted that the caregivers would transfer her mother into a wheelchair and wheel her into the living room so she could watch tv.   The patient was positively mortified of transfers and looked on at me in terror every single I would get her in and out of bed. She'd even bite, wail, and would occasionally say a phrase like 'Get out of here!'  'No!' and 'Stop it!' That was the extent of her language capabilities.  I really hope she either passed away or passes away soon. :/ What kind of life does she have in which she doesn't even recognize that plates and clothes are not food items?

Imagine living in fear for no apparent reason in other people's eyes, yet in your eyes, there's somebody trying to kill you. Again, it's subjective, but it's really disheartening to be in his position. His family, who rarely visits, pays a caregiver to have 1-on-1 with him, and I believe he is full code."

My second job I worked in sub-acute rehab as an LPN as well and I had a four week orientation.   My current job in occupational health I had about two months or so.

It's not really seen as an embarrassment or failure.    However, there is a point where the orientee needs to be ""cut loose"" and learn by fire.  More often than not, it's just nerves and the nurse performs exceptionally well for their level of experience.  You will be fine. Just remember to relax, and ask questions when they arise.

It was an incredibly real and human moment, and it really changed me in a way I didn't even realize until I began to move down the path toward becoming a nurse myself.

nursing,3bwzkr,Aquarian_Sage,6,Thu Jul 2 21:04:26 2015 UTC,"My first thought is to make yourself a sheet of paper each week, with something for the secretary to sign claiming receipt of the paperwork. Something to the tune of ""This verifies that I have received documentation from (you) on (however many) patients, including patient #123, #456, and #789 for the week of suchandsuch."" with everything close enough together they can't claim you went back and added numbers after they signed it. It would probably take time for them to check it out, but may save you more time/hassle in the long run, while avoiding names.  Edit: And if they try to have some sort of problem with this, then call them out on why they want to have a paper system without any hand-off verification process to protect you/them from playing the blame game."

nursing,3bwusm,PutYouToSleep,2,Thu Jul 2 21:23:38 2015 UTC,"Pharmacy technician seems like a better option to me. Any big chain store will hire you and the pay is better. You don't need to take any classes, just get your state license, which CVS will reimburse you for. I worked as a tech for over 5 years (only 6 months at CVS because retail sucks) with no prior experience. They started me at $10 with a $0.25 raise later (CNAs here start at $8.25). When I quit my job to go to school full time, I was making $16/hr. I paid $750 to get my CNA before applying and it was a waste of time money for me. It boiled down to common sense and common courtesy things like: wipe front to back, encourage patients to be engaged in their own care, how to make hospital corners, and how to help bathe and feed clients with comfort and dignity. All of that is very important work and impacts many lives, but I don't feel it has helped in school at all. Being familiar with various meds, what they treat, and common side effects has helped me way more because meds are a fairly large chunk of my classes so far (at least 2 med quizzes a week plus med questions on every test). It's really up to what hope to accomplish, but if you are already in nursing school getting a CNA seems a bit redundant to me. I'm not familiar with Texas, but in my area there are many direct care jobs that do not require a CNA if you are worried about experience. My mom works a 9-5 office job during the week, but has a weekend job providing care to elderly or impaired people and she has no previous experience. I would suggest concentrating on school, but again, it's what feels right to you."
nursing,3bwusm,jlyq5,2,Fri Jul 3 04:25:16 2015 UTC,"I never thought about the pharmacy tech and med tests in class before. That would be great. However to blow off CNA seems a little out there. I started at $13.something in NC.  And I still learn meds just in a different way. I personally am very inquisitive and my nurses are very informative. Ill ask why they get X or Y. Why is this prescribed over that. I get to see the results of different meds and how they interact in a live environment.   Then you have the benefit of seeing other aspects of the hospital. Transporting pts to CT, MRI, ect and seeing behind the scenes there. I've learned cardiac rhythms on my tele floor and made my way over to step down and ICU. I've sat with IVCs and been exposed to behavioral health pts.  You get to be a part of codes when those happen and get experience there.  Yeah the routine might be vital signs, comfort, and safety. But it is much more than that. I'll make sure to critically think about my PTs vitals and trends and think about what their norms should be before just alerting the nurse to a high BP, when that pt is post stroke.   Yes being a CNA can be blindly enter vitals, and clean poop. But only if you let that be all you do."
nursing,3bwusm,chrizbreck,2,Sun Jul 5 04:32:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not disparaging CNAs or the very important work they do. I was just saying that for me, getting my CNA was not a good resource for helping in nursing school. Also since it seemed like OP was already in a nursing program taking additional CNA courses wouldn't necessarily be the best use of his/her time and money since, as other people pointed out, similar material is covered in the beginning of the program. In my area CNAs mainly work in long-term care and are paid very little compared to all the work they do, but I can appreciate that a CNA working in a hospital would definitely learn more technical skills that would be really helpful in school and later in professional practice."

nursing,3bwusm,Hotkarly,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:41:20 2015 UTC,"I worked as a nurse assistant after my first semester of nursing school. Every hospital in my area has a program for students in RN programs to work part-time as student nurse assistants after they pass first semester. It involves the same duties as CNAs and sometimes even more duties added after you have passed that skill in school (IV starts, foley insertions, finger sticks, etc.) I would check into that before you pay to be certified. I really felt the experience helped me be ahead of my nursing school peers. On tests I could think of real life examples, the RNs I worked with were always willing to show me new and interesting things, I became familiar with the hospital setting, equipment, and environment, and I was always the person my peers came to for help in clinicals because I was confident and comfortable with my skills learned at work. I also got my foot in the door for a very coveted externship spot. For me, it was worth it."

On a more important note: being a CNA will help you with the social skills that a great and successful nurse MUST have. Yes, in nursing school it is all about passing those tests. But, when you go to clinicals, do you know how to have a normal conversation with your patients? Are you afraid of bathing, cleaning or walking them? Do you forget the small stuff? i.g. Combing their hair, or shaving them? I've read in several occasions that having patients feel friendly towards a nurse, is the best way to avoid law suits and patient complaints. Not that you'll become their maid, but I feel like some students only care about THE NEXT EXAM, and forget they are dealing with a human being. DO YOU WANT THAT NURSE CARING FOR YOUR PARENTS? Sorry for the small rant."

As a nurse you will be able to delegate things like baths and toileting, but let me tell you, there will be times you do things yourself.  I found I had a lot more respect from the CNAs that I worked with during nursing school when I transitioned into the RN role, especially after they saw I would still do ""the aide stuff."""

nursing,3bwusm,Unicorn_Destruction,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:20:55 2015 UTC,"This opinion may put me in the minority but--CNA work in and of itself is not that big of an advantage during nursing school. I had zero health care/patient-related (but tons of retail) experience prior to nursing school, and it has not set me back one bit. I have received glowing evaluations from all of my clinical instructors. I will admit that knowing how to talk to patients (and being comfortable in that role) from day one has been a tremendous advantage. No one expects you to enter nursing school knowing nursing SKILLS per se. But know-how with interpersonal communication will help.  Now that I'm starting my final semester, I've observed that the students who struggle the most in clinical and theory are the CNAs. In clinical, they have a hard time unlearning bad habits (read: not EXACTLY how the school/program does things) from their workplace and there's a tendency for them to think they know more than they do. In theory courses, they ask ""but what if...?"" during tests and pick the wrong answer because they consider their personal work experiences over the perfect ""NCLEX Medical Center"" that shows up on exams.  Another personal observation is that working as a CNA while doing nursing school clinicals and being immersed in nursing school can make a nursing student feel like s/he never gets a break. My best NS friend works 3-4 tech shifts weekly on top of our program--she is miserable and on the brink of burnout. One thing I love about my non-hospital job is that I can forget about the rigors of nursing school and have something else in my brain for awhile!  DISCLAIMER: I'm providing my personal experiences that don't necessarily translate to the general population. I don't think not working as a CNA will set you back. Start networking for jobs and preparing for NCLEX before your final semester, do mock interviews, polish your resume, and go forth!  Good luck!"
nursing,3bwusm,jena5111,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:22:49 2015 UTC,"Working as a CNA before becoming a nurse is something I believe to be near totally essential. It will ease your transition into nursing as well as make you a very desirable candidate for RN positions once you are graduated and licensed. some hospitals do not make you take the CNA classes or have your CNA cert if yo u are already in nursing school, so look into that option"
nursing,3bwusm,kclark17,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:18:08 2015 UTC,"Yes! Not only will you have the basic bedside skills but you have opportunities to find an RN job quicker after. Expecially if it's a place affiliated with a big network. Also, it will make clinicals less stressful in the beginning. You will have already become accustomed to communicating and interacting with pts or residents, so you will be comfortable.   I'm in Nursing school right now and have been working before and through school and I found it to be extremely helpful. Most nursing programs around me actually require the course to be enrolled into the program. But most people just take the course and don't get certified or work as a cna after the class. Also, if the nurses you work with know you are a student/perspective student, they tend to give you advice and let you observe procedures. Another tip is to work a nursing home or hospital opposed to an assisted living facility  or home care. It's more work generally, but you are exposed to so much more. Most big facilities will pay towards your education too, usually after you sign a contract to work for them for x amount of years."
nursing,3bwusm,K8rose,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:20:20 2015 UTC,"I was a network analyst before I became a nurse. I had little experience with dealing with a human at even a conversational basis for a lot of my job. I don't feel like it impacted me whatsoever when the search of a nursing job started. While it's noble to think that you should start from e try level you have to recognize they are different types jobs accomplishing a mutual task. All the skills you learn in the CNN course will be addressed in nursing school and then quickly passed up by the bread and butter of the nursing side of things. To me, it seems like wasted effort that should be applied at honing other skills. Be it clinical or management of the aides. Just my .02"
nursing,3bwusm,UiCleirigh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:02:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how it is where you are, but where I am we're considered CNA equivalent after our first semester.  Most of my class, that is not already working at a hospital, tries to get a job in the hospital as a CNA or tech."

nursing,3buhdp,flsunchick,29,Thu Jul 2 06:40:06 2015 UTC,"Someone was telling me the other day that our NICU had a father try to kill his child. On three separate occasions. I have trouble comprehending why the police weren't called the first time something happened.   Anyway, I'd go directly to management and ask the grandmother is banned from the hospital. Your co-workers need to do the same. If the requests are ignored, escalate up the chain of command. I've found management usually responds to a bunch of nurses on the unit coming to them with the same request vs. one representative.  On my last unit we had a family member threaten staff, the police (the real police) were immediately called, and a complaint made. We never saw that family member again. The best thing to do is advocate for yourself. The hospital has to get behind you once a formal complaint has been made. Allowing a family member on a unit after there's a police report stating the family member threatened to shoot staff is a liability for the hospital. Hospitals respond to liabilities."
nursing,3buhdp,mogris,5,Thu Jul 2 07:02:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. We actually have called the real police and had them come ""speak"" to this grandma about a month ago because she was yelling in the hallway, scaring other parents. Yet, this was still management's response. Some of my coworkers have already started emailing the unit manager, which prompts more of us to do the same. You're right though, this is a liability for the hospital and the next step should be going up the chain of command.  Also, that's crazy about the father trying to kill his baby. I have to imagine he was losing it from all the stress..."
nursing,3buhdp,ojuice7620,15,Thu Jul 2 08:08:48 2015 UTC,"WTF?!?!? You need to escalate this up the chain of command. In this day and age I would expect gun threats to be taken much more seriously! It is completely unreasonable for a visitor to act like that, shame on your manager for not having their nurses' backs, you have a right to feel safe at work! Shouldn't patient centered care also mean you should keep OTHER patients safe from threats like this? Especially in a neonatal unit!  I personally don't have experience with violent/threatening visitors to the level that you have, but it has happened elsewhere in my hospital. From what I hear the visitor is usually given a stern talking to by management/security about boundaries/inappropriate behavior etc. They are given a second chance, and any further violations will result in them being banned. Sometimes a sitter is placed in the room 24/7 to act as a witness and call for security asap if needed, and visiting hours are restricted. Sounds like this grandma has had one too many second chances, and should've been banned long long ago.  I certainly hope your situation gets resolved quickly!"
nursing,3buhdp,16semesters,7,Thu Jul 2 09:00:13 2015 UTC,"Ugh, and that's kind of the worst part - they're stressing patient centered care, but how ""patient centered"" is it when a neonate or parent gets caught up in this and gets shot. Not to mention if I was a parent with a child in the unit and I heard that grandma yelling and carrying on, I would seriously fear for my and my baby's lives. I would want to get transferred to another hospital. That should give us some great satisfaction scores 😑"
nursing,3buhdp,ENRN,9,Thu Jul 2 12:10:44 2015 UTC,"In the case of a threat, we are supposed to apologize for whatever mistake we made (even if we really didn't) and then tell them we feel uncomfortable with their words. Then, call security.   This isn't a bad strategy to be honest. If someone threatens violence you certainly don't want to escalate things. Regardless anyone that threatens someone should not be allowed on the unit afterwards, period. It just increases the culture of violence being an acceptable form of getting your way."
nursing,3buhdp,justatouchcrazy,7,Thu Jul 2 14:54:51 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately this is a trend among many hospitals - nurses fear gun violence, management want to deliver customer service! It will end in when there is a rampage in a NICU, Ped onc floor or similar - it's only a matter of time!"

If this was the case then it's a really bad judgement on the RN. You know your body and are responsible for it. If you're so tired you're falling asleep with pts in your hands, are you not further liable for other mistakes?   Remember the story where the RN was tired from OT and crashed her car? Most people on /r/nursing thought it was the RNs responsibility to manage what her body can handle in terms of lack of sleep. This is sort of the same."
nursing,3budpr,16semesters,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:05:24 2015 UTC,"It's a little hard to manage the amount of rest you get as a nurse. Somebody called off? Guess what, you get to stay ANOTHER 12 hrs. Get caught trying to power nap so you don't kill someone? The least you are going to get is a write up but more likely a suspension or a termination. It's even worse if you are working the noc shift especially if you are supposed to be at work. I have had to stay for 36 hrs before or worked 16 off for 4 work 16. Nurses are not considered people but a resource to be used until it dries up."
nursing,3budpr,LegginMF12,7,Thu Jul 2 17:12:21 2015 UTC,"That sounds like either the worst employer ever and/or a huge list of labor violations.  You have a legal obligation to refuse to do something if you feel it's unsafe, and being too tired to not drop a baby (as an example, after all who knows what actually happened) counts as grossly unsafe.

nursing,3bvybw,rninnj,3,Thu Jul 2 16:24:37 2015 UTC,"The scope of the LPN varies from state to state so it'll be difficult to get an exact answer here. In short, the LPN generally works with an RN, but reports all changes and information to the RN. I seem to remember learning something about the LPN not being able to 'assess' but instead can only report gathered information.  Most LPN's I meet are working to become RN's. I think there are many more RN jobs, and hospitals wanting RN's as opposed to LPN's."
nursing,3bvybw,PRNmeds,3,Thu Jul 2 16:43:03 2015 UTC,"Could be part of the state to state differences you mentioned, but LPNs in my state on my unit take their own patients and do their own assessments without reporting to an RN. They don't seem to really function any differently than an RN except they can't do IV pushes or take certain patient populations (though I'm not sure if they just haven't gotten the training?). I don't believe the LPNs on my unit are working towards their RN because they've been there longer than me; however, I know my hospital is phasing out hiring nurses that do not have their RN BSN and in a couple years you'll hit a plateau for promotions if you don't have a BSN."
nursing,3bvybw,tarandro_titters,2,Thu Jul 2 17:23:31 2015 UTC,"Thats probably a lot of it, limited upward movement. It will be harder and harder to get work as an LPN. Its even getting harder to get work as an RN with an ADN."

nursing,3bvybw,StefaniePags,3,Thu Jul 2 16:45:35 2015 UTC,"The scope does change in each province/state (some of us aren't American...), but this is how I describe the difference as it is in the Canadian system I'm in.   LPNs and RNs look at a problem from two different sides and work to middle, and are complementary jobs - one cannot replace the other, and ideally you have a team with both that work together. An LPN is trained ""doing stuff"" first, and clinical judgement is layered on that, so they will finish school likely more practiced in ""hands on skills"", and use those skills and assessments to build the picture of the patient and situation. An RN is trained to ""think big picture"" first, and clinical judgement is used to decide what assessments/interventions should be done. A new grad RN might not have had as much training on the hands-on skills (that certainly was the case where I went to school) but that's because understanding the why behind those skills is more important for that role.   The two are NOT opposites, just different, and in a good team they compliment each other."
nursing,3bvybw,teasin,2,Thu Jul 2 19:33:47 2015 UTC,"LPNs aren't responsible for initial assessments, (so your admissions), they don't do the initial teaching and they don't do the evaluation part (so see how interventions are going). After the initial assessment the LPN can do the assessment, care, dressing changes, meds etc. Same with teaching the RN would do the first lesson and then the LPN can reinforce. Also LPNs get more stable patients rather than unstable changing patients (in a perfect world ahah). In hospitals where I've been the LPN reports patient changes to the charge nurse (the RN) and they work together to make any changes needed. The last notable difference I can think of is the opportunities past working on a floor/homecare etc...with a BSN you can continue your education ie. get a masters, and you get access more leadership roles.  I hope that makes sense..cuz I know it didnt make sense to me for a while when I was in school"

In our facility, we reported changes to the MD and the DON. There wasn't a ""charge nurse"" that we reported to. When a new patient came in, we did our own assessments. I'm sure they are very different from a hospital assessment. Most nights we didn't have an RN in house.  Our LPN's (that were IV certified) took care of their own IVs and some meds (not sure which ones) through a PICC.   I chose LPN over RN because I had a small child in school and it was a year long program with plenty of opportunities in my area.  The money is decent.

nursing,3bvybw,OllyPolly,-6,Fri Jul 3 03:34:20 2015 UTC,"I don't want to sound like an asshole here, but you can google the answer and get at least ten different sites that can accurately answer this question.  An LPN/LVN is a vocational nurse who received their education at a JC or vocational school like Summit/American Career College.  We do not have a degree unless you had one before you started the program.  We can administer all meds except for IV medications, we do not perform assessments and we work under an RN.  Most LVN jobs are home health, SNIF, subacute rehab, medical specialties such as ortho or derm, and urgent care.  I have seen some job posting for lol LVNs in the ED but they are rare  An RN is someone who has has a degree from a college or university.  This can be an associates degree, but the most common is a bachelors in nursing.  Both types of RNs are licensed and can perform the same tasks however an RN BSN has more theoretical and didactic training.  It is because of this that many hospitals are phasing out RN ADNs and only hiring RN BSNs...at least here in California."

I reached out to that recruiter and didn't get great feedback from him, but one of his contacts looked at my page so I added her. She was a RN at a hospital with a job that I thought would be interesting. I messaged her asking about her position and if she had any advice for new grads. She told me about the new grad program at her hospital, which isn't usually advertised. I contacted HR about applying for it and the rest is history. I would focus on linkedin later during your RN job search."

The most I ever had in med/surg was 8. In post partum, a nurse I work with had 13 PP moms one night.   I have only heard of numbers like 42 patients per nurse in LTC, which I think is completely unsafe. I'm am pretty sure it would be utterly impossible to take care of 42 patients in acute care."

In general, afaik nurses in the United states have a lot more responsibility, knowledge and tasks than here.   Yes, I am performing care for those who need it. At the moment we have about 50% completely independent patients, 25% who are semi-independent and 25% (9 in total) who need help with everything (How do you call these? We call them A3). Medicating... I don't know, I administer i.v. Antibiotics, pain medication and everything else that is ordered (on bad nights we also may have to monitor patients who get antibodies (yay rheumatology) for a few hours).  And sometimes I control the prepared oral medication for the next day.   Assessment? No. That's done in the day, when there are about 10-16 patients per RN, sometimes we have some assistants.   Charting? Tbh... I don't know exactly what you mean. If that's documenting what we do, yes, I do that  but only the absolute necessary,that's just a few minutes.   Also, most nights I have a little help, that means at 1:00 and at 5:00 I get an assistant for about 20 minutes to help me with all the poop and stuff."
nursing,3btnjp,Kishmeth,3,Thu Jul 2 05:07:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like charting/documentation takes up a lot of time in the United States. There's so much pressure to cover your ass in the event of a lawsuit, resulting in a lot of extraneous charting.  Also, the type of patient you're referring to as an A3 sounds like they would be called a total care pt on my floor: repositioning every 2, feeding, bathing, incontinence care, etc.  It sounds like you have fewer responsibilities. For example, on my step-down unit, I have to do a full head-to-toe assessment on each patient of mine once an 8-hour shift, plus vitals every 4hours. But your patient load still sounds crazy."

nursing,3brzle,TheHourOfTheMice,4,Wed Jul 1 22:57:40 2015 UTC,"Good post. I'd also add a few mental pointers:    Do what you can in the time you can do it and in the order it should be done. Triage tasks the way you triage patients. Know when to ask for help Remove ""That's not fair"" from your vocabulary. You may get two critical patients back to back or simultaneously. This is what you signed up for. Your job is hard. Don't complain. It drags the whole department down. Likewise, a positive attitude will keep the department afloat.  Check your emotions at the door. Your department needs level headed folks that can keep their nose to the grinder. and not carry the frustrations with bed 10 to bed 8. The needs of your patients are independent of your stress level. You're coming from the floor to the ED. Your relationship with the attending has changed. You need to develop a good, working, SPEAKING relationship with all of your attending MD's. They're as busy as you are and they make mistakes. Also. the resident's are MD's, I'm sure they all graduated the top of their class from somewhere, but they are integrating their practice into a setting they may have little experience at. They appreciate your input. They don't want to be yelled at by the attending any more than you do.  Have fun. If you can't, it's not worth sacrificing your mental health."

Don't be afraid to approach the providers, I feel like a good 15-20% of my day is tracking down an doctor or PA that's ordered something weird or relaying critical results or asking for more pain meds. Also, get used to focused assessments instead of head-to-toe assessments. AND...start off with thinking of ""worst case scenario"" on every patient...once that is ruled out then go down the list. Chest pain- is it an MI? Is it a PE? Pneumonia? Pneumo? Etc.  Memorization helps too ;)"

I learned to lovd the ER after I understood the flow of care.  Talk to the doctors.  Look at CTs and X-rays. Don't be afraid to ask questions. If you don't know why a certain med or test was ordered ask. ALWAYS ask.  The ER is generally a friendly culture. Docs and nurses. Of course its important to know the skills first, but once you master skills look at why we do what we do, and why the docs order this over that.  And when you do know.  Be nice enough to explain it to your patients.   Ex: we get an ekg and trop level on every patient with CP over a certain age. In 4 hours it will be repeated again. Etc.   If you can explain why we do it to your patients they will love you for it and you'll never forget. ER isn't all skill. It's vast knowledge too. I believe learning things from the docs and nurses is what separated me from being a novice from an expert."

nursing,3bq2rd,Bedpanjockey,62,Wed Jul 1 06:04:31 2015 UTC,"I was a DON in a large ALF with a secured unit. One woman that sticks out in my mind had forgotten that her mother had passed many years ago. Then suddenly, she went through a phase where she remembered again: every night, after dinner, she would try to call her mother. When she couldn't reach her, the resident would suddenly remember that her mother had passed, and she would break down crying, grieving the loss all over again. All we could do was comfort her. The phase lasted a month or two.  I used to tell families that the hardest phase of dementia was when they (the resident) knew they were losing themselves. Once they got to the point where they no longer realized the loss, it was much easier for them. From that point on, every day was a new day, and they lived in the moment. Every meal was wonderful, folding napkins became a fabulous and important chore, sitting outside on the patio in the sun was delicious, and walking from one end of the unit to the other was a new experience each time.  Probably the most interesting aspect was that they remembered the words to songs. Even those who no longer vocalized or spoke for any reason would sing along. We had some really beautiful sing-alongs, especially at Christmas.  We had a lot of sad moments too, but it was an honor to care for those human beings in their final days."

I think I'm going to have to live in an old folks home. I don't want people to have to deal with me."" --This gentleman practically reduced me to tears. He was AOx1, but having a moment of lucidity.

We bonded right away when they came and I enjoyed them both so much. He died within a couple of weeks and she declined steadily after that. She would go back and forth between being sweet and funny and being cruel and scared. I can't remember exactly how but she developed a very bad sore on her leg which she would not keep her hands off of and it got badly infected with a couple nasty things including, of course, MRSA. It got to the point that I made a wound care referral to a specialty hospital and she ended up with a wound vac. That was a nightmare for her and for us.

Usually these people keep looking or calling for their spouses endlessly for the remainder of their lives. It's also hard to watch relationships where only one of the individuals develop dementia/alzheimers. Expecially if they end up forgetting them entirely."
nursing,3bt8m8,stillinreno,3,Wed Jul 1 23:23:13 2015 UTC,"What do you think is interesting? The tox stuff I think is fascinating is probably super boring to you. (Also we don't do randomized control trials often because people frown on poisoning toddlers)  If you have an area that you're interested in, like ICU or oncology or L&D, look for the professional organization's journal and you should find a few studies you can use."
nursing,3btmnc,Queervegosupremo666,4,Thu Jul 2 01:25:13 2015 UTC,"If you were to say ""I'm moving to Nebraska from Colorado"" I'd say go for it! You will pretty easily find a job. Going from Colorado to California as a new grad? Its possible but extremely difficult, I did a similar move from Iowa, but I already had a job lined up. Even then, they only accepted 1% of the applicants for the residency program, and I was one of only a couple from out of state. You better have an impeccable resume and a ton of dumb luck (latter is more important) because new grad programs in California have so many applicants its like throwing darts at a wall to pick who gets in. Pretty much everyone in my cohort had a 3.7 or above, ACLS and PALS, health care experience, perfect recommendations, etc. Its far easier to just get a year or two of experience and then move to California.  That said, I still was able to do it somehow. A job in California was a dream I certainly didn't expect to get as a new grad, and you shouldn't either. Apply to new grad jobs in Colorado AND California."

I found RN work pretty quick, but I had 5 years experience.   Start Networking and start early, dont move until you have a job either. Try joining the California Nurse Association, get your licenses in CA so they take you serious. Good luck! Keep us posted."

Either graduate, take the NCLEX, and then transfer your license by endorsement (which costs money). OR... You can graduate, move, and take your test in that state (which is what I did). It only took me a couple months to get my ATT and, as soon as I passed, I got a job!"

nursing,3brhxk,msega1988,5,Wed Jul 1 15:46:12 2015 UTC,"Totally depends on locale.   Some places you often have a job at graduation. Some places 6 months is expected. It's tough guaging others responses comparing different locales.  You need to be your own advocate. Network and follow up all leads. If you're in a competitive market you can't just drop off you application and expect a job, you need to find out who makes the decisions in a given organization/unit and attempt to contact them.  It's possible and you'll find a job eventually, but you gotta grind if you're in one of those competitive markets."
nursing,3brhxk,16semesters,2,Wed Jul 1 15:54:33 2015 UTC,Yah I'm in Ontario and most job postings outside of the new graduate positions are basically requiring me to have acls and experience or are casual part time (and I don't really want to move somewhere if it doesn't offer good hours).   One thing I have been getting into the habit of is trying to find out the hiring managers name for the cover letter and then trying to call them back or find their email.   Some of the bigger hospitals though they have a whole HR team so it's a bit harder when they tell you to address CLs to the hiring manager or to whom it may concern. Any suggestions when this type of situation happens?
nursing,3brhxk,snufu,3,Wed Jul 1 16:27:23 2015 UTC,Make sure you're applying for positions even if they're asking for experience. As a fresh grad last year I applied for a job asking for three to five years experience and got it anyway. I actually got two jobs asking for experience at the same time and got to pick which one I wanted. I think in reality they care about your knowledge and character more than your actual experience.
nursing,3brhxk,snufu,2,Wed Jul 1 19:14:44 2015 UTC,I always see the whole experience thing and I don't apply..HUH! Thanks so much for that advice!! Where are you working now?

nursing,3brhxk,JemLover,4,Wed Jul 1 20:30:50 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're doing what you need to be doing for now, but waiting to apply until after you took the NCLEX may have hurt you in the short term. From what I've seen new grad positions are often filled before or shortly after graduation. It's possible you may not hear anything until the next round of new grad hiring, which depending on your area could be September or even December.  FWIW, I graduated in April last year. Most of my class, including me, started applying for jobs in February or March. By graduation I had several interviews but no offers, though many of my classmates already had jobs waiting. I interviewed for my current position about a week after graduation, took the NCLEX 2 weeks later in late May, and started mid June.   Good luck to you. I remember how frustrating it was to be putting in application after application or going on interviews and not hearing anything."

nursing,3brhxk,Hotkarly,3,Wed Jul 1 16:01:09 2015 UTC,"Taking advantage of nepotism is, in my opinion the easiest way to get a job. Find someone you know who works in an area hospital, and send them your resume and cover letter. Ask them to forward it to HR with some kind of a recommendation.  Reach out to Clinical instructors that you liked. Most of clinical instructors have TONS of contacts with nurse managers. The places where you did your clinical rotations are also good places to start asking around for openings.    I've been an RN since 2008, so things might have changed a lot since then. Also, I'm male. I sincerely think that male nurses have a much easier time finding a job. I was able to get a job right away. I worked at the hospital where I did my critical care clinical rotation. I was recommended for the position by my clinical instructor.   Keep your head up. Don't be afraid to be a little aggressive with follow ups. Look for job fairs in area hospitals. Use all of your contacts: Family, friends, classmates, teachers. You'll find something.  It's only been a month!"

nursing,3brhxk,newRNny,2,Wed Jul 1 22:01:58 2015 UTC,"Waiting to hear back is incredibly painful! I'm in the same boat. I live in a saturated location, and as an ADN, despite being enrolled in a RN-BSN program, I have a snowballs chance in hell getting into an acute care facility.   I interviewed, and even shadowed for one position, and it was great. The nursing supervisor who I met with seemed incredibly happy with me, and when I checked in a week later, I heard nothing. I gave it one more week, checked in again, and still no response, not even a ""you're not the right candidate"". That to me was super infuriating.   I was offered a position at a long term facility, but there were several red flags, and they were really just desperate for a body, so I turned it down.   Today I began applying out of state. I am single, childless, and have to move on September 1st, so at this point I feel I have nothing to lose. Several people have said ""a job is a job"", and I should have taken the one I wasn't thrilled about, but as a ""non-traditional"" student in my now mid-thirties, and with a goal of eventually working in ICU/ER, I feel like I shouldn't take whatever I can get, and should aim for something that will be beneficial, and a learning experience.  The majority of my classmates, I'd say 90% were CNAs, and working in long term care, and took RN jobs where they were. The remainder have left the state.   Anyway, it's good to know I'm not the only one! Good luck in your search!!"

This got me their email or phone number. I followed up, and let them do all the heavy lifting for me. I heard things like ""These floors hire new grads and have openings, let me pass on your resume to managers on those floors."" Then I'd get a call back telling me they were interested and could I formally apply on the website before an interview that was set up for me.  It was so easy."

It was kind of interesting, because he's one of those doctors who is normally fast, abrupt, and has a very confident demeanor.  Still, it definitely beats the overconfident resident who thinks they know everything (or pretends to, anyway). I'd much rather have a resident admit they don't know something than for a resident to just guess their way through. However, I did have a resident not know, asked me what I would do, and when I admitted that I didn't have much experience with this particular diagnosis and didn't know myself, she got mad at me for not knowing :/"

As an above poster noted, medical floors really have become LTC when LTC is unavailable. It's all chronic condition co-morbidities mixed with some assessments here and there. But your population will be primarily 65+.   Oncology will also have an older population but overall you'll have a greater lifespan of patients. As well, oncology is more ""acute"" so you may have a better chance of doing more skills. Plus, the skills you learn on oncology will transfer to any other specialty you decide to do, even if you grad job is just general medicine.  Overall, both are great choices. I'd go for oncology personally just d/t the more acute nature, more exciting diagnoses, and the higher likelihood of engaging in more interesting assessments/interventions and seeing more things.

nursing,3bs6u9,duckface08,2,Thu Jul 2 12:21:59 2015 UTC,"I think it'll depend on two major factors: what do you see yourself doing once you graduate, and what types of patients/diagnoses you expect to see in each respective unit.  Truthfully, where I work, the medical floors are mostly filled with frail, elderly patients with a bunch of chronic health issues, like COPD, CAD, diabetes, etc., plus maybe a more acute diagnosis, like UTI, pneumonia, or acute renal failure. While some of them can get pretty sick, for the most part, they're fairly routine and stabilize quickly, and working there can sometimes feel like working in a nursing home. It's just a matter of juggling all the chronic issues. However, these are diagnoses you will see very commonly everywhere, even if you decide to specialize, so it's important to know them well.  With oncology, it is definitely a very specialized area and it probably won't have the broad variety of diagnoses you'll see on a general medical unit. However, there is definitely lots of skills and knowledge to be learned here, too. You will know your lab values inside and out, as chemo does whacky things to your blood cell counts and electrolytes. When I used to work oncology, I got tons of experience with IVs, central lines, trachs, parenteral feeds, and chest tubes (due to malignant pleural effusions), which really helped when I transferred into a critical care area. Also, oncology patients can get really sick really fast, and honestly, some of the sicker oncology patients I had on the floor were about as sick as some of the step-down patients I look after now. However, oncology can be emotionally exhausting and acuity can be high, so burn out is a definite possibility. Since you'll only be there temporarily, though, you likely won't be there long enough to feel it unless you are a very emotional person."

If you are burned out by LTC, chances are good you won't love being on a medicine floor, especially on those weekends where the nursing home ships out tons of people to lower their census. I hated it deeply, it reminded me very much of working as a CNA in a nursing home for 5 years."

One patient I had, with meals still took 8-16 units of U500 as part of their sliding scale coverage.  I might believe this was just a conversion to humalin.  HOWEVER, I would definable talk to the patient first and find out what he normally takes before giving anything anywhere near this amount.   Nice catch, scary."
nursing,3boxdu,hellloonurse,8,Wed Jul 1 02:34:37 2015 UTC,"I had a patient on this, and the Endocrinologist (saint of a man) had us call him for EVERY DOSE just to make sure that the conversion was correct and the guy was getting what he needed. He was on ACHS and was in for almost a week. I tried to tell the doc (after calling him at 10pm and again at 6am) that this was gonna drive him nuts, but he was adamant."

nursing,3boxdu,auraseer,-2,Wed Jul 1 02:07:49 2015 UTC,"For a very highly insulin resistant patient, sometimes very high doses are required.   I've cared for a patient whose minimum dose AC was 41 units (for BG 150-180). At HS she got 105 units of Lantus, which always required two injections because the pen dial only goes up to 80.  On the other hand I've also had a patient whose minimum AC dose was 1 unit, which hardly seems worth the trouble.  There's a reason sliding scale isn't identical for all patients."
nursing,3boxdu,NonIdentifiableUser,3,Wed Jul 1 00:30:48 2015 UTC,"I was going to say that I get SSI not being the same for all patients, but requiring 41 units as a corrective dose seems to indicate that other options should be explored or something. I've only been an RN for roughly a year though, so maybe I'm off base, that's just seems out of control to me.   HOWEVER, after thinking about it a little more, it's likely that your facility and mine do the same thing, just ordered differently. We do prandial doses + low, medium, or high dose SSI. Yours probably does the same but it's ordered together rather than prandial as one order and SSI as another."
nursing,3boxdu,auraseer,2,Wed Jul 1 01:14:20 2015 UTC,"requiring 41 units as a corrective dose seems to indicate that other options should be explored   According to her chart, ""other options"" had been tried for years without success.   Her physician wrote some pretty snarky notes about how she refused to make any dietary or lifestyle changes, and how she compensated for massive sugar intake by just using more insulin. Over time that continually increased her body weight and her insulin resistance."

Sounds like they needed their lantus increased (unless they were having hypoglycemic episodes as well). 105 really isn't that much for a day. I have out pts I manage that are probably around 140-150 a day.  Any of the fast acting insulins are just such a crap shoot. I hate them from a prescribers stand point and the patient just ends up chasing highs and lows all day.  For what it's worth, I'd verify this order too if I was the RN. While it's possible that's the correct dose, it's also unlikely and it never hurts to ask."

nursing,3boxdu,auraseer,0,Wed Jul 1 01:33:58 2015 UTC,"potentially lethal doses   That's overdramatic. It all depends on the sensitivity of the patient. As I said in other comments, some patients can receive far higher doses than this with barely a change in blood glucose."

nursing,3boxdu,auraseer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:54:40 2015 UTC,"It's not ""rolling the dice."" You don't just give a patient a random number of units of insulin. There are guidelines for where to start with insulin dosing, but if that turns out to be insufficient, the physician will slowly ramp up the dose.  Finding the right insulin dose can take months or years of incremental changes. It's not a game of chance. If you ever see somebody dosing at random, or giving one dose to all patients, then they're doing it wrong."
nursing,3boxdu,SmallTownPanther,2,Wed Jul 1 04:05:22 2015 UTC,"If I was caring for this patient for the first time and saw an order like this, I don't think it would be amiss to shoot the doc a quick call to verify the order.

nursing,3boxdu,auraseer,-1,Wed Jul 1 04:16:31 2015 UTC,"Verifying the order is sensible.   But it's not ""OMG, the pharmacy made a huge mistake which will be instantly apparent to anyone who sees this MAR entry,"" which is what was implied by OP posting the image with this title."

If I bend over for anything people see the girls and my bellybutton. Its akward.

nursing,3bnpff,just1guy93,12,Tue Jun 30 18:06:11 2015 UTC,"Its just going to take time my man, and we've all gone through it. The mindset you're carrying about worrying you'll do something to harm a patient is a healthy thing to feel. Truthfully it is very likely you will do something that hurts a patient by mistake.  I recommend this: Take your job seriously, don't be lazy, always try your hardest to do the best for your patients. If you do this, then no one can ask you for anything more than trying your best. Having harm reach a patient because you're lazy is a very different thing than having harm reach a patient because you were experiencing something new.  Learn from each patient, each decision you make and every experience you encounter. If you haven't seen something before, don't fake it, ask questions. You're like a sponge, suck up all the information you can from the RN's/RT's/MD's etc that are around you.  Giving a good report just takes practice. Foleys/foley care seems confusing because you haven't done it much. Just spend more time learning about it, working with it and it will become second nature.  Keep your chin up, you will never know it all, we are all lifelong learners."
nursing,3bnpff,PRNmeds,3,Tue Jun 30 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"1) No one can possibly know everything.  2) These things take practice.  Reading about it is one thing, but it's kind of like trying to read about riding a bicycle.  You just have to get on and petal to understand.  And you will scrape your knees eventually.   So when you make ""mistakes,"" think about why that other person pointed them out and what can you do to keep it from happening again.  Don't always take it personally, we're all under stress and can seem to snap, especially when we're worried about another person; the pt.  Granted, you won't always save yourself from a touch of guilt, but what matters is what you do with that information.  Here, you were ""all over the place"" with your history.  So the lesson is, make a standard way of giving your reports.  What's the patient's initial situation and relevant history, your interventions and how the patient responded.  Keep it simple, to the point and relevant and you won't seem all over because you're concentrating on one message."

nursing,3bnpff,aeshleyrose,3,Wed Jul 1 19:38:17 2015 UTC,"I went through this too.. I was fresh off of orientation and was giving report to a senior RN and I blanked.  Didn't know anything.  She screamed at me for a little while and made me cry and feel like shit.. but honestly it's made me a better nurse. I've been at it for almost 4 years now and it doesn't hurt as badly when you make minor mistakes.  You realize they aren't lethal and  you don't dwell on them as much.  You realize that focusing all of your attention and dwelling on the little mistakes will distract you further and make you more susceptible to screwing up again. Your best bet is to just breathe.  Slow down, and forgive yourself.  Being a nurse is all about learning - You'll never stop learning.  Also, you would rather move slower than speed through everything and make wreckless errors.  Don't worry too much! You are doing great."
nursing,3bnpff,404__not__found,2,Tue Jun 30 22:37:02 2015 UTC,"You will get better at applying your critical thinking skills as time goes on - it comes with experience.  While getting your BSN, one thing you can do to help these skills develop is to read case studies (or at least that's how they were titled in our books) where they give you a PT scenario and you have to think through what you'd do before flipping to the page with the ""answer""."
nursing,3bnpff,sharloch,2,Tue Jun 30 19:15:38 2015 UTC,"You're still really new. You dont graduate competent, no one does, it's planned that way. Keep that in mind when you get down on yourself. Also, if one teacher/helper isn't working out, find someone else. There are lots of great, good, weak, and horrific teacher/mentors in nursing - we're a huge diverse group. Find someone you can trust and learn from. It helps. I came into nursing overeducated and overexperiencted, and I still had much to learn. We all start out that way. Some people go into teaching roles for love of the role, and others merely to escape hard work. Find a few of the former, and avoid those who attack and blame learners for being learners. Good luck."

As far as phone report, are you familiar with the SBAR format of report? Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation. Look it up and keep some version of it in front of you when have to call an MD, advice nurse, or other clinician about something."
nursing,3bnpff,freshpressed,2,Wed Jul 1 04:52:41 2015 UTC,"Hang in there.. I know exactly how you feel. I started on a BMT unit directly after nursing school and was in way over my head. Nine months later its getting better every week, with set backs here and there, but generally definitely better. I left work so many times in the beginning feeling inadequite and not satisfied with the care I provided. Things that helped me:  Ask ask ask. Seriously, and if its something you've heard a zillion times,  ask again if you need to. I literally have not had a colleague tell me ""but I've told you this before"". Patient safety is the main priority, always.  After a while you get a feel for what your colleagues are like. Who will share their knowledge, who will recognise when you are having trouble, who keeps cool in stressful situations. Try to stick to those people. And eventually, try to be that type of colleague.  This took a while for me, but don't shy away from difficult patients. You are doing yourself no favors in the long run.   Be honest about your mistakes and learn from them. It happens to everyone, and if its a mistake you obviously did not do it on purpose. Don't try to cover anything up.   Read up at home. Google ALL the things.  Last but not least, leave your shift at work. After report the pts are NO LONGER YOUR PROBLEM.   I think these are things every nurse goes through. What you learn in nursing school in no way gives you the confidence of actual work experience."
nursing,3bnpff,BloomingTiger,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:03:51 2015 UTC,"The feeling of incompetence is actually one of the things that made me reconsider nursing. I'm currently ""reviewing"" for my second attempt at the NCLEX but it's difficult to get back at it with being a single mother and the worry that I'm not good enough and that if I can't even focus on studying, that I might be this way if I ever become a nurse.   Sorry I can't really relate because I haven't worked yet, but just wanted to tell you to hang in there. A lot of my family and friends have told me they've gone through similar situations like yours. I think it really is something you'll face while you're still new, but like you said yourself, you know to learn from experience. I guess all you can really do is evaluate the situation and review what you need to do - kinda like you're studying for an exam. :) /hugs :D"

nursing,3bnpff,JiLLyPooP,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:21:45 2015 UTC,"nah, i'm in Texas. I heard that they implemented even more rules there for the NCLEX though so now it's even more difficult to take it there."

nursing,3boa9p,Rk550,2,Tue Jun 30 20:32:29 2015 UTC,UWorld Nclex app is free for a month. It is helpful because it's portable (on your cell phone) so you can do questions anywhere.
nursing,3boqj8,sjb5355,4,Tue Jun 30 22:31:49 2015 UTC,"A quick google search makes me think that it is going to be difficult to become a nurse, although not impossible. You will probably get push back from your school, then clinical sites, and finally from the Board of Registered Nursing.   If I were in your shoes and was serious about becoming a nurse I would contact each and every one of those groups and ask them about it. You don't want to put in all the hard work only to hit a roadblock at a later time. Have an open discussion, and be prepared to hear stuff you don't want to hear.  Some seem to have been able to have successful nursing careers, but their DUI's were some 8+ years ago.  I wish you the best of luck, I would put some thought into abstaining from alcohol consumption as its caused a good amount of grief in your relatively short life thus far. Beyond that, its kind of out of your hands.  Best of luck!"
nursing,3boqj8,PRNmeds,6,Tue Jun 30 22:56:55 2015 UTC,This will be very difficult. Even if you got your license a job may be difficult with a record. Check with your BON
nursing,3boqj8,notme1414,3,Tue Jun 30 23:30:55 2015 UTC,"Not completely disqualified, but you have a few extra hurdles to clear.  At least one of my classmates had a DUI or two in her past. She had to do a lot of extra paperwork for the BON, and I believe that she had a moderately large amount of hassle with courts and attorneys before she even started school, but now she's a fully licensed RN.  You need to hire an attorney who has experience with nurse licensing issues. They will help you navigate the legal complexities in your state."
nursing,3boqj8,auraseer,3,Wed Jul 1 00:05:39 2015 UTC,"It is possible I suppose but it is a lot of ""Ifs""  If a school accepts you and If you can sit for the NCLEX and If you can find a job.......  All the nurses I know with DUI's got them after they had a few years experience which for some reason is much less detrimental"
nursing,3boqj8,Auto-medic,2,Wed Jul 1 09:01:49 2015 UTC,"Your responses have been very helpful and any more would still be appreciated. It sounds like it will not be easy but seeing as I am a few years off of becoming a nurse to begin with, the more time that elapses between now and then as well as other positive factor to add to my resume the higher my chances become. Even so nothing will be guaranteed, and I'm aware I will have to work harder than everyone else in order to be where I want to. Thank you everyone for your responses."
nursing,3boqj8,opheliakitty,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:30:14 2015 UTC,"Even if you can get a license, with two fairly recent DUIs, I can't see how you won't end up with a stipulated license and a 3 to 5 year monitoring program contract. I think PNAP is 3 years. Do you really want to be labeled as an alcoholic and forced into an expensive monitoring program where the next 3 years of your life will revolve around AA meetings and random UAs?"
nursing,3boqj8,auraseer,2,Wed Jul 1 22:33:42 2015 UTC,"I was unaware of PNAP. Do you have any more insight for this 'program'? It sounds like you are not fond of it. Yes I have recent failures on my record but I am currently 24. I'm not young anymore but I still believe there is time for me to make something of myself, and a nurse is a respected position I truly would like to keep my sights set on. Being labeled an 'alcoholic' doesn't flatter me, but being pulled over in college on a bike barely seems like a crime to me, and yes I admit the last one I was wrong. Nevertheless alcohol is the common denominator and I recognize that and hopefully I can make the right life changes so that it no longer adversely effects my future. If people view that as being an alcoholic than o well I suppose. I imagine most other professions would have to view me the same way. I'm going to assume the soonest I would complete nursing school would be two years from now, and more than likely closer to 3. During which time I'd beinvolved with several alcohol rehabilitation programs. Nurses make a decent paycheck for the hours they put in, but I know they aren't living the high life by any means. I plan to hold down a steady job, likely more than one during my time working toward becoming a nurse and have other means of income so that while compensation for being a nurse will be satisfying, it wouldn't be like once I'm a nurse it's easy street. I want to be a nurse so I can be apart of a profession I can be proud of. If I fast forward 10 years it is a nice thought that there is a chance I would be in a profession I enjoy and can maybe have a resemblance of a normal life. I do appreciate all the feedback thou. It does sound like that once I am finished with settling this second DUI, the best course of action is to contact a nurse licensing lawyer and get a better feel for my chances of proving I'm not a complete f*ck up. But only time will tell I suppose, and in the mean time any more feedback I really thank you all for."
nursing,3boqj8,opheliakitty,2,Thu Jul 2 02:47:14 2015 UTC,I am currently 24. I am not young anymore   This right here is a contradiction.
nursing,3boqj8,Roki-B,2,Thu Jul 2 09:20:46 2015 UTC,"Um...you might try googling it. There is a lot of information out there from disgruntled nurses in the program. I am in my own state's monitoring program for nurses because I am an alcoholic. But it's basically probation for addicted nurses or potentially problematic nurses. The first part is the program which universally involves X amount of AA/NA meetings a week, check-in meetings with the program X times a month, and calling in for random UAs every day for three years. (They screen for etg too so you have to avoid all potential alcohol sources.) The second part of the program involves stipulations on your license that makes it pretty much impossible to get a bedside job in acute care. There are fees for everything, and sometimes they make you re-do treatment which is usually also out of pocket, so it gets expensive very fast, especially because it's very hard to get a job while in the program.   None of anything else that you are saying is going to matter to the BON. If you have an alcohol problem, they want you in that program for three years. If you don't have an alcohol problem, they will probably assume that you do and put you in the program."
nursing,3bn1l5,y2kiscoming,3,Tue Jun 30 15:17:06 2015 UTC,I'm not positive because I think it varies from state to state but I looked up CA because they were the first google result and you have to be convicted before you report the arrest.  You can be arrested for anything (mistaken identity etc.) but you are innocent until proven guilty (guilty would include pleading out).  Good luck!
nursing,3bn1l5,kjrn,17,Tue Jun 30 17:48:59 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen you need minimum 5 years of separation from an event like this until you'll be licensed by the state, and probably something more 7-10 years. I'd imagine it would be similar for your school to place you in a clinical position.  We were all young and dumb at some point, and unfortunately you got caught. This reflects poorly upon your morals, ethics, and judgement, and I'm sorry but I wouldn't want you taking care of someone I love until enough time has passed without further incident that I can be reasonably sure you've changed. We've all got the same 24 hours in a day and we've all got choices to make. You chose poorly.   I got a DWAI when I was 21, a violation in the state, and I got my RN 11 years later. I wouldn't want 21 year old me taking care of patients either. I don't think this will work out for you now but perhaps you can revisit your options some years from now."
nursing,3bn1l5,taerin,4,Tue Jun 30 15:57:54 2015 UTC,"I think you make some very fair points but are likely getting down voted because it's not a sugar coated answer. You're being devils advocate but i totally agree. During my nursing school orientation the dean talked about how the BON doesn't often show leniency if you commit a crime while in nursing school or in the year or two prior. It does show poor judgement and its even worse because she had already been accepted. Good luck but be prepared for the hoops and them questioning your ""rehabilitation"" in such a short time span."
nursing,3bn1l5,mucklucklover,2,Tue Jun 30 20:08:24 2015 UTC,I definitely appreciate the honesty. I am a male by the way. I learned I had a warrant out for my arrest after I had been accepted into the program. The crime took place before I had been accepted. I was on the alternate list and honestly I had no hope of getting in the program. Do you think this fact will make a small difference?
nursing,3bn1l5,taerin,5,Tue Jun 30 21:16:36 2015 UTC,Your only hope of going to nursing school is to get acquitted. If that happens then you're innocent of the charge and you don't have to answer any other questions. Based on the evidence your lawyer will probably urge you to plea down because a conviction may very likely send you to jail. But if you plea down your chances of becoming a nurse in the next 5ish years are probably slim.  Take it as a life lesson and explore other options if it doesn't end in your favor. There's plenty of other degree programs that well accept you without looking at your criminal history.

nursing,3bn1l5,azbartender,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:51:49 2015 UTC,"The poster below is giving a worst-case scenario.   It's entirely going to be on a state-by-state basis. You need to address this with a BON-experienced lawyer which it sounds like you are already doing. You might try making an anonymous call to the BON to see if they will give you any information however the standard answer is usually ""we take things on a case-by-case basis.""  Have you already told the school? I couldn't tell from your post. The school may drop you immediately because it may be hard for you to get clinical placements.  But they might not.   On the bright side, at least it's not a DUI or drug charge! Those almost always come with the automatic assumption that you have a substance abuse problem which is an added hurdle."
nursing,3bn1l5,dandelion_k,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:53:24 2015 UTC,Thank you for your reply. I am meeting with the school next Wednesday to discuss my situation. I just got off the phone with the Florida department of health- the woman gave me a link to the CNA exemption application. She stated the CNA exemptions apply to any nursing license in the state of FL. These are all hoops I will be more than willing to jump through if the school will grant me admission. But thank you again for your words.. I know my case is not the worst possible thing that could have happened. My ethics will be questioned but I am confident I can persuade if I am given the opportunity.   Here is the link in case anyone is curious: http://floridasnursing.gov/applications/cna-exemption.pdf

nursing,3bn3hj,nurseyj,3,Tue Jun 30 22:56:12 2015 UTC,I'd be interested in talking to someone who was licensed in the U.S. who moved and got licensed in Canada as well. How does the province thing work? I know every province is different - however if you're licensed in one place can you put a request in to transfer to a different province or will they not approve the change? Very curious about this. I know you also need a bsn usually to transfer to Canada however at that point is that valid enough to test for licensure then?
nursing,3bn3hj,Hashtaglibertarian,2,Tue Jun 30 17:38:37 2015 UTC,"Every province has its own regulatory body. You need to go through their respective application process if you want to work in their province. I think the only way you wouldn't get licensing for a particular province is if you didn't meet the requirements, if you were in poor standing with the previous licensing body, or didn't pay the fees required. I have heard that some provinces will make you write some sort of testing for some reasons - I haven't had that experience.  Source - me. I've changed provinces three times in the past three years. But I've never worked in the states and have never written the NCLEX."

nursing,3blhhd,Arctic_rose,5,Wed Jul 1 07:26:28 2015 UTC,I work in an ER - flu season takes out most of our staff.
nursing,3blhhd,InkedNurse,5,Tue Jun 30 13:25:53 2015 UTC,"Hey man, don't sweat it. I'm in nursing school now, but I've been a tech for a few years and I'm pretty sure we all get something at some point. I work with some amazingly professional and educated people, but a hospital is a high traffic area and sometimes all it takes is one person. And not every person in the hospital is as acutely aware of infection as we hope they could be. You could do everything right and still get something!     All it takes is for one person (nutrition, environmental, doctor, tech, nurse, family member, respiratory, PT, even the patient, ANYONE) to not use proper PPE or hand washing techniques and bam, you've touched the same door handle that the family member who cleaned up your elderly patient with C. diff (and has amazingly not even pretending to be interested in the PPE despite the risks you've told them) has been touching.      Or the patient on dialysis with undiagnosed ESBL who doesn't wash their hands when they wipe asks to borrow your pen real quick so they can write down the channels their favorite shows are on.      Or hey, this motherfucker is getting swabbed for the flu and is kind enough to cough directly into your mouth without warning or hesitation...(he didn't even say sorry after either.)....      Or maybe, you're just using something that someone who didn't use PPE, because ""omg gowns suck and it's only a history of whatever"", before you used. They touched the patients skin during vitals, charted on the computer in their room, and left. In you come, log onto the computer using the potentially MRSA infected mouse and oh crap- you're still healing that paper cut on your pointer finger.      At one point, every person on my entire unit was one by one graced with a wonderful stomach bug. It was a quick and painful illness. Explosive vomiting and diarrhea for 24 hours followed by flu like symptoms for another 2 days, and then it was like nothing ever happened. We all knew it was going around but it didn't even start from a patient- we were getting sick from working closely with each other before we knew one another were even sick! And by then the whole nurses station could have been considered a hazmat zone.     What REALLY sucks is when you have a patient who's person and belongings are infested with bed bugs/roaches and you're not allowed to wear PPE. (This happened more than once. I'm glad I left that hospital. I have never been so paranoid in my life. Thankfully I didn't bring any home with me!)    The hospital is a disgusting place. When you're surrounded by nasty 40 hours a week for years of your life, you're gonna get some nasty on you/someone else is gonna PUT some nasty on you eventually. Not too long ago we had THREE C. diff patients on the floor and NOT ONE CONTAINER OF ORANGE BLEACH WIPES ON THE ENTIRE FLOOR. They were using the purple wipes which DON'T DO SHIT FOR C. DIFF. As a floor who uses dynomaps- this was a HUGE problem. For some reason I was the only tech who knew this so none of the other techs even knew that their use of the purple wipes on the dynomaps was totally useless. I ran my happy ass down to supply and picked us up a box immediately! (To further dismay, when I asked the charge nurse in a panic why there were no orange wipes for our 3 wonderful diffy patients, she also didn't know that the orange wipes were what was needed for them. I'm pretty sure my eyes were the size of dinner plates.)       So, in your case, your patient was not diagnosed with scabies. If he was, you KNOW your bedside care would have been different. This is what is important.    Furthermore, we're taught to control infection, but we're also taught to treat our patients like humans and not walking germs. (Some places actually encourage people to take vitals without gloves on so you don't make the patient feel ""gross"" and make them feel more comfortable.) You wouldn't don up in complete PPE with a hood for every patient- you can't. Not only do hospitals strongly discourage this behavior, but it's totally impractical. And sometimes we don't know what precautions are necessary until we've already done patient care.  When I was getting my physical done at employee health, I actually watched two doctors walk in and say they need a TB test done before they were exposed. Not even they could help that they were exposed to an undiagnosed illness!     And though your patient was already on isolation, our PPE is literally hilarious. I was excited to get a blue plastic gown with thumb holes at my new place of employment, while my last place of employment gave us transparent yellow mesh gowns, where we poked our own thumb holes to keep the sleeves down and in place. Also, did I mention it was transparent? If someone puked on me, well, I was gonna have puke on me and that's all there is to it.  Don't blame yourself, or beat yourself up. It happens. And, if you can muster the nerve, be thankful you only infected yourself! :)     Now, continue on wit yo bad self.   Disclaimer- still in nursing school, I hope my examples are appropriate!"

nursing,3blhhd,random_user_name_13,3,Tue Jun 30 20:13:32 2015 UTC,"I only had the flu once in my life, and I am highly convinced that I got it from one of the many patients at work during flu season, but I can't be sure. I always wear a mask when going into a known flu pt's room, but not everyone follows protocol properly and people are touching the COWs and companion phones constantly and not wiping them down.  A friend of mine got scabies while working in a nursing home as a CNA. Not fun, sorry you got it. Don't let them make you feel bad about it, it's not like you wanted scabies."
nursing,3blhhd,wicksa,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:02:21 2015 UTC,This happened to me this past winter.  My hospital had a sketchy flu quarantine policy and kept sending up flu suspects without precautions if their first test came back negative (many had the second send off test come up positive).   This was after I spent 6 weeks giving flu shots as a traveler and most certainly had a flu shot of my own.

nursing,3blhhd,MilitantSheep,2,Tue Jun 30 11:12:02 2015 UTC,"I haven't caught anything from a patient yet but... Your post struck a chord with me because I literally just took care of a patient with scabies over the weekend. I wore the appropriate PPE but I'm still worried. It covered my wrists but the gown still left a few inches between my knees and feet exposed. I wouldn't be so worried about myself but I have a 10 month old at home. Can I ask how long it took you to develop symptoms? Don't be down on yourself. Even with the best PPE practices, things happen. Good luck!"
nursing,3blhhd,SwanInThePond,2,Tue Jun 30 14:28:13 2015 UTC,"Don't worry too much. I work in a public school where scabies is a common occurrence. I have never had it. I am in close contact with these kids before they are even diagnosed too. And, often times, these kids have had it for weeks before they come to me with the itchiness and rash. Their classmates or teachers don't get it either. It's usually transmitted from close contact with family members. Of course, it's still possible for you to get it but unlikely."

The question is what your state BON, your future nursing school (if you're going down that road) and/or your future employers think of the program.   Call the board and ask if the program would make you eligible to take the exam. Call your school and find out if BON accreditation is good enough for them (if they have a CNA pre-req, which many do). If you have any contacts in hospitals or LTC, ask if a graduate of this program would be considered for employment. Finally, call the school itself and ask what its pass rates are.   Also, that's wicked expensive when you consider that community colleges offer enough financial aid to cover the cost and then some for most students. Trade-off is it'll take you a semester; but if you're thinking of that CC for an ADN, it can be a good way to make contacts.  Best of luck."

nursing,3bk5tn,nurseintuition,15,Mon Jun 29 21:54:21 2015 UTC,What is your position that you were rounding in the ED and encountered this situation?  How did you handle it?
nursing,3bk5tn,StefaniePags,42,Tue Jun 30 00:31:33 2015 UTC,"In regards to my position, I was working as a clinical manager of emergency room in Miami, Florida. I handled the situation by asking the nurse the following questions.  1: If it was your mother or father with a heart rate of 35 and low blood pressure, would you accept that the doctor wasn't about to come to the room. The nurse response was ""Hell No"" I would demand that help is provided immediately. My next response was that this patient isn't any different from your parents. At that point, he understood that when things don't get addressed you must escalate it up the change of command.  2: After I spoke with the physician and present the condition of the patient, he stated ""I was not told the patient was in this condition and I have over 40 other patients that need to be seen, however, he ran immediately to the room.  3: The patient situation was handled by immediately reassessing the patient to validate that the presented vital signs where accurate. Then, a crash cart was brought to the room in order to pace the patient (patient was in 3rd Degree Heart Block) to bring the heart rate up a bit. Next, the patient was upgrade to ICU and the cardiology team was notified.  4: What I learned from this situation is that the nurse was a new nurse in the United States and was used to following physicans orders to the ""t"". I in turn had to re-educated the nurse and determine if the nurse understood what was urgent and his method of prioritization.   The summary of this is that as a new or experienced nurse you must know that you are the advocate for the patient and you are 100% responsible for everything that happens to that patient during your shift. If the physician refuses to give order then escalate the issue up the chain of command starting with your charge nurse, then nurse supervisor, then nurse manger, then directors, then administrator on call, then medical director. It will always come back to you as the practitioner of what steps did you take to keep the patient safe. Again if it was your parent, what would you do? I personally wouldn't never accept no is this case."

nursing,3bk5tn,cazmoore,22,Tue Jun 30 00:25:57 2015 UTC,"In the er, you wouldn't call a rapid response. You only call a rapid response on the med surg, tele, or step down floors.

I hope the nurse at least had the code cart outside the room and the pads were on the patient.  If you're doing rounds, it sounds like you may be charge/admin. I think the nurse caring for that patient needs some guidance from you. A patient sitting with those vitals for 3 hours is unacceptable. It appears that the nurse may have some problems with being assertive. I wonder what he/she actually said to the doctor. There is a big difference between ""hey, can you come see this patient,"" and ""I need a doctor in here now, this patient is about to code."" It's not cool of the doctor to yell at someone for asking them to see a patient, but it's also not cool for the nurse, as the patient's advocate, to just let that slide."

nursing,3bk5tn,NowWithWaffles,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:08:29 2015 UTC,What about a significant decrease in LOC but with resps and pulse?
nursing,3bk5tn,adreamtomeat,4,Tue Jun 30 06:56:31 2015 UTC,"Same as above.   If its a regular unit, call a rapid. If its the ED or an ICU, no rapid.  Code is only for pulselessness or respiratory arrest. If someone goes basically unresponsive, but they have pulses and a resp rate, call a rapid.  In the mean time, do a sternal rub, check their blood sugar, give narcan if they recently got pain meds, and go from there."
nursing,3bk5tn,nurse-penguin,2,Tue Jun 30 07:09:29 2015 UTC,"In the UK we call peri arrests, it basically means this patient is about to arrest, get your ass here now.. And the whole arrest team shows up, pretty handy when your patient has a significant drop in HR or you need ITU urgently"

nursing,3bk5tn,PRNmeds,6,Tue Jun 30 01:11:42 2015 UTC,Any ED Doc alerted about this type of patient would intervene immediately.  I once had a 3rd degree heart block patient get an emergency transvenous pacemaker by the ED Doc 10 minutes from hitting the EMS bay.

When I read your follow up and the hypothetical you posed re: ""What would you do if this was your parent?"" Truthfully I cringed and rolled my eyes, kind of sounded like you were being a dick. New nurses are under a lot of pressure and need to learn in a safe environment. Instead of dealing out a lecture of some sort, it would've been very helpful if you had worked with the nurse and had them make the appropriate calls/supported them through the situation.  My fear is that this newer nurse instead of understanding that they had just participated in an important learning exercise will end up walking away with feelings of shame, instead of feelings of being empowered to utilize their resources.  That being said it's impossible for me to get an accurate picture of how things transpired, but PLEASE fellow nurses, work to help educate while building up our new colleagues. We're all in it for the patients."

It certainly needs immediate attention, but a code blue is overkill. I think even external pacing was overkill. A little atropine or dopamine is more likely what my cardiology docs would order until they could put a permanent pacer in."
nursing,3bk5tn,PRNmeds,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:25:50 2015 UTC,"Can't seem to edit my comment- I know that atropine isn't a great choice for 3rd degree, but it's worth a trial before jumping to a more painful method (external pacing)"
nursing,3bk5tn,auraseer,2,Tue Jun 30 03:30:13 2015 UTC,"Eh, if he's truly in 3rd degree atropine will be trying to stimulate his SA node and there will be a complete disconnect. I wouldn't even try atropine. Pacing seems the best option."

If my heart rate started falling through the floor (not stably low) with low pressures I'd call a code."
nursing,3bk5tn,MsConstrued,3,Tue Jun 30 22:36:00 2015 UTC,"Handled which situation?  As a nurse handling the patient's condition:  I've got standing orders that allow me to follow ACLS protocols for atropine and TC pacing. If no physician is immediately available I'll have to get the crash cart and a second RN and we'll do it ourselves.  As a manager handling the nurse:  In the immediate situation I would instruct her to go get the crash cart, and I would myself go fetch the nearest physician. I would then stay in the room and assist until the patient was stabilized, and also incidentally watch the nurse's performance    Afterward I'd have to have a chat with the nurse about the serious problem she had failed to respond to, and give her a chance to explain. Most likely she would at least require additional training in clinical priorities and in communication escalation. If she continued to fail to grasp the problem, didn't care that it happened, did not cooperate with the education, or had some other more serious issue, this might be a firing offense."

This patient seems to be having a problem but he is awake, able to complain, has a blood pressure. Things could definitely be worse. The MD may have been elbows deep in something really serious when the report of this patients situation came through. I'm sure the MD cares, it's his job. It's also his job to prioritize at a moments notice, and our job to advocate. If I were that nurse, I'd go grab some atropine and a code dose of epi for my pocket. Then I'd go get the defib pads and put them on the symptomatic patient, just in case.  Check back in with the MD if he isn't in the middle of a critical situation in 10 minutes or so. Continually monitoring the patient."

If one said no I would have gone to the next level, as I was assessing the patients rhythm and hooking them up to the crash cart. That nurse needs some retraining about what constitutes an emergency and any protocols in your institution for emergency situations."
nursing,3bk5tn,wicksa,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:32:40 2015 UTC,"Great response! Yes, in this case the nurse was an experience nurse that needed training with urgency and prioritization. In many cases, a lot of nurses struggle with prioritize took and time management.   I agree with you 100%, that retraining is require in this situation and the nurse was retrained and educated on the missed opportunities.

nursing,3bnou6,Whatavarian,13,Tue Jun 30 18:02:02 2015 UTC,"It's nicely written, but the reality of a coding pt isn't always like this.  It's more along the lines of 'this lady is 103 years old, just let her go in peace for fuck's sake,' as you futilely perform compressions and push epinephrine.    Occasionally you'll get the more dramatic, emotional code, but it's usually not like that.  It's more along the lines of us getting in the way of nature taking its course."
nursing,3bnou6,AXL434,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:31:35 2015 UTC,"Oddly, the code you describe is very similar to the one we did yesterday. This lady was pretty far gone, very acidotic. So for me, what strikes me about a nurse like Luke isn't whether or not the code was successful or even necessary. It's just the nobility of the work and the mindset that he shares when he writes about the work day. I just find myself humbled when I work with people who work so hard and care so much about what they do."
nursing,3bnou6,justatouchcrazy,4,Tue Jun 30 22:02:15 2015 UTC,"To me it's the med-surg nurses that have it tough in this situation.  In the ICU and ER we do a lot of codes and a lot of people die in those units, but they usually either arrival dead/nearly dead (ER) or are essentially dead and for the most part we are just prolonging it (ICU).  Yet, in med-surg they get more of those devastating codes that you stand out in your memory; the patient that suddenly throws a massive PE, the guy that falls out of bed and develops a devastating cerebral hemorrhage, or the lady that has an MI in the middle of the night.  Sure, it doesn't happen nearly as often, but those are all patients that were talking and joking at the start of the shift, unlike those in the ICU/ER.  Plus they know the family members as not just a sad soon-to-be widow, but as someone that was already planning for discharge and their vacation next month.    Death as a concept doesn't both me and many/most nurses, but unexpected deaths are an entirely different story."

Alive only in the sense that they have vital signs.    ... is spot on. We keep way too many people alive for no damn reason.  The even worse part is this...   they slowly realize that the fire will not burn bright again on this camping trip.   ... almost never happens.  The families refuse to acknowledge their loved one is gone while we keep an empty body alive.  I feel worse for the patients that lay there for years than their delusional families.

Mostly pyelonephritis, hyperemesis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis. I think their docs put them on our unit because their post-op patients are here too (easier to round), and supposedly we are"" cleaner""  than the other units. They always have orders for FHT q shift -even if they're 10wks-so an OB nurse is looking at them twice a day. And those nurses are always willing to come assess if we have questions. We also sometimes get overflow postpartum moms who's babies are in NICU.  I think the patient should go to whatever unit can best handle their primary problem and someone from your department can check on them as needed."

The most recent patient in question was stable from a pregnancy standpoint (or as stable as it could be considering her multiple underlying Health issues... But to phrase it another way, she was not being admitted for a pregnancy related condition, but for further medical evaluation and management of all of her issues). I think It would make more sense to be on a medical unit with internal medicine and infectious disease managing her, with OB as a consult and OB nurses coming to do the fetal monitoring. But of course, it is being approached and managed in the complete opposite way! But what do I know? I'm just a nurse! 😉"

nursing,3bkvye,cazmoore,9,Tue Jun 30 01:31:36 2015 UTC,"I wasn't a nurse at the time but I had definite ""brain fog"" for the year after my son's birth. I had to return to work 6 weeks post partum though   Personally my memory never did get the full on return as it did before baby. It did get a lot better though as the years went on - but it never went back to the way it was before. There's too many other things to remember/worry about than prebaby days.   Have your doctors checked your vitamin levels too? I was having a bad particular foggy period about a year ago and my vitamin D levels were down to a 9, my vitamin B levels were also diminished. Even now I just had my levels rechecked my and my vitamin d level is still only at a 22 and I take 2000 iui/qd.   Something else that stuck out to me in your post is your anxiety levels - is it preventing you from sleeping well? Is your body exhausted from constantly being on 'high alert' all the time because you have to take care of the baby? Do you even sleep well at all? I sometimes take benadryl to get into a full rem sleep for 8 hours (we tried sleeping pills - apparently I talk a lot on them and my husband hates when I'm on them). Can your partner help you get some days of sleep in throughout the week? Not like ""hey can you get the baby"" and you're still semi awake while he tends to her/him making sure everything is okay and you aren't needed. But more of a ""hey take care of the baby"" and you roll right back into a full sleep.  Are your hormones also level? Even if your periods are regular there could still be imbalances at play.   It does get better - but I still think at a year out you should be less foggy than you say you are in my personal opinion. There is definitely a huge adjustment period after having kids - and it will eventually get better. Best of luck to you and your little family!"

I don't take meds for anything else.

Firstly go to your program and keep your mind open about what you like in school. Then if you like the ICU/Critical care, start working a job there. You might get lucky and get a job right out of school or you may need to work another unit first. Then after two years of the ICU/CC think about whether you want to be a CRNA or not.  Until then don't worry too much about the whole thing."
nursing,3bku9m,16semesters,3,Tue Jun 30 01:35:03 2015 UTC,"Anyone on here care to give some insight on the career?   Nurse anesthesia is an advanced practice nurse trained to independently administer anesthesia of all types and all associated procedures. This includes general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, monitored anesthesia care, sedation and pain management. Areas of expertise include airway management, pain management and resuscitation. In addition to providing anesthesia in the OR, they may also provide sedation for procedures, emergency airway services throughout the hospital. The vast majority of anesthetics in the country are provided by CRNAs, especially in rural areas.  Training currently requires a bachelor's degree as well as minimum 1 year acute care experience to get into school. Schools are anywhere between 2-4 years. The minimum degree is a master's, and many programs are going to a doctorate of nursing practice.   Likes/dislikes? Pros/cons?    I'm fresh out of school but much of the training is similar to the actual job. I love it. I love the procedures, I love the in depth anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology. I always loved taking care of critical patients and now I basically make patients critical and the care of them. I have a lot of responsibility and also a lot of autonomy.  I take care of one patient at a time. I take care of them for a certain amount of time. Sometimes I just walk in and do a procedure. The charting is mostly just what you are doing moment to moment. It's still a lot of charting but only on one patient.  If there is a ""downside"" the two things would be the schooling is long and challenging, and it's not always exciting. The schooling is just a big commitment. Many programs don't let you work. It's hard going from paycheck to paying tuition with no paycheck. As for the excitement... I've done EMS, ED nursing and ICU nursing. No job iss always exciting and if it was you would burn out.   Go for it/don't go for it?   Get your ducks in a row first. Get going on your BSN and do well. Programs are competitive. Before you're done shadow a CRNA. See if you can get a couple days. See if it's what you like. Other things that I know I considered were acute care NP or flight nursing. It is a huge time, money and effort commitment do you need to be SURE it's what you want.  Definitely drop me a line any questions you have."
nursing,3bku9m,laxweasel,2,Tue Jun 30 15:46:21 2015 UTC,"This is incredibly helpful, and I will absolutely take you up on that offer. Thankfully, my husband has a great job that can support our family if I was to go for it. I'm currently a volunteer at a local hospital and have done some shadowing (not of a CRNA) so I'll try to get in towards the end of the program to check it out. Do most CRNAs do the same kind of work that you mentioned... Various different lines of work... Or do a lot just handle anesthesia during surgeries? I'm pretty used to the charting system. At the animal hospital we're required to chart vital stats... HR, BP, spo2, etc. every 5 minutes. The doctors don't have a lot of involvement until there's an emergency, but I've been doing it for 5 years so they trust me to make the right call with emergency drugs and such. Do you have any idea if my experience would help me at all when it comes to applying to school? I feel like it's actually been a burden because human medicine doesn't typically view animal medicine as comparable (but that's mostly for patient experience reasons). I'm planning on keeping my vet tech job throughout nursing school, against their recommendations, just to stay current in the anesthesia"
nursing,3bku9m,laxweasel,2,Tue Jun 30 17:01:29 2015 UTC,"Most CRNAs spend most of their time handling anesthesia in the OR during surgery, I mention the other things just to give a view of some of the other things we do.  Yes we monitor vitals and record every 5 minutes or less, but at some institutions with electronic charting the vitals automatically cross over from the monitors. Regardless, I'm not stuck writing notes at the end of the day like some areas of nursing.  As for whether the vet anesthesia will help or hurt you... Hard to say. If all you get to say is you did vet anesthesia that may hurt you because rather than training you to do anesthesia they may worry they'll have to ""untrain"" your vet habits and then train you.  However if you show that you are familiar with the pharmacology of the anesthetic drugs it may help you. It is really really key that you learn the ""why"" of what you're doing in the anesthetic if you want it to benefit you. Knowing ""if the blood pressure drops I give 100mcg phenylephrine"" isn't going to impress anybody. Knowing ""if the blood pressure drops its likely to be because of relaxation of the vascular beds and so phenylephrine is an alpha 1 adrenergic agonist which will promote vasoconstriction"" would be actually impressive.  And to your other question about Anesthesiologist versus CRNA it's...quite complex. Basically a CRNA can do any kind if anesthesia an anesthesiologist can do. However it breaks down to the laws and regulations around billing. Only in about 18 states can CRNAs bill Medicare without anesthesiologist or some physician involvement. The arrangement you'll see in more densely populated areas is where anesthesiologists may do preops and manage patients in PACU, and are then supposed to be there for ""key portions"" of the anesthetic (induction, emergence) while CRNAs are the ones managing the anesthetic for the case."
nursing,3bku9m,PutYouToSleep,2,Tue Jun 30 20:10:24 2015 UTC,Also... Excuse my ignorance... But where does the anesthesiologists job end and where does the CRNAs begin? That part is still a little confusing to me
nursing,3bku9m,justatouchcrazy,2,Tue Jun 30 17:03:12 2015 UTC,That varies heavily from state to state and facility to facility. Many places have CRNAs working independently without an MDA even on staff.  Many places have MDAs that are basically overlords to the CRNAs and do not allow for any autonomy or participation in any of the fun stuff.  And the many variations in between.  www.aana.com is a great resource to answer a lot of questions as well.  The independent CRNA practice is kind of self explanatory but you may want to google supervised anesthesia care team and directed anesthesia care team models for more info.

My very first call of my first ambulance clinical during Basic school was a mid-40s male having both an MI (LAD obstruction as I recall, but I was just a baby) and a dissecting AAA.  That was my first patient ever, and he coded a few times before dying in the OR.   My first patient as a paramedic was a homeless guy looking for food, and first as a nurse was a guy that was involved with a violent crime of some sort (likely did it), was just extubated and literally ran out of the hospital while being chased by the police.  I'm a bit concerned about my first patient post graduation, assuming I don't go crazy myself first."

nursing,3bku9m,PutYouToSleep,15,Tue Jun 30 04:40:14 2015 UTC,"I'm actually a vet tech right now and do all the anesthesia for our surgeries. I really enjoy it. I have my bachelors and masters in chemistry and (nerd alert!) the chemistry behind the anesthesia excites me. I'm aware that I have a long road, but I'm more looking for general information. I know nothing about anesthesia in human health care so I was curious if it's one of those jobs where it looks appealing, but sucks in real life. Yea the money is great and all but I'm becoming a nurse because I feel like it's the perfect balance of hands-on health care and science. As a CRNA, to me, that's the most sciency you can get."
nursing,3bku9m,macavity_is_a_dog,3,Tue Jun 30 04:55:20 2015 UTC,"Awesome! This is what this original post should have said. When I read your original post my first thought was ""oh someone saw the income potential."" That's why it's kind of a running joke that everyone starting nursing school is ""going to be"" a CRNA- when in real life they have no idea what's ahead of them.      I know nothing about anesthesia in human health care so I was curious if it's one of those jobs where it looks appealing, but sucks in real life.   It's the sort of job that looks pretty cool from the outside (a lot of people think it looks boring) but is actually friggen awesome! My advice to you is get really good grades in your BSN program, then get in an ICU ASAP. Try and shadow a CRNA or 4 if you can. If there is a local CRNA program you can contact them to see if they will work with you to set up shadowing, if not just contact a hospital."
nursing,3bku9m,conundrum2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:26:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I have some connections to a local hospital, so I'm hoping getting in the ICU won't take forever. I didn't do that great in my undergrad but have been killing it in all my prereqs for nursing school. Is this the kind of thing where they only consider straight A students. I'm doing that now... But the prereqs are easy, and I'm expecting the worst in the accelerated program"
nursing,3bku9m,Masters_of_Sleep,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:39:56 2015 UTC,"For me the pre-reqs are what killed me and my GPA.  Nursing school was far easier than any of the anatomy and chemistry courses I took, at least in my opinion.  As long as you graduate with a 3.5, can get a good GRE score and have a good resume with solid experience you have a decent to good chance at getting into the CRNA program of your choice.  Focus on school and eventually being a great bedside nurse now and worry about anesthesia later is probably the best advice.  Don't lose sight of your goal, but remember you have a lot of hurdles to clear first."

I did quite poorly in my associates degree nursing program and then did really well in my bachelor's courses and some not-required chem courses on the side. My improvement once I had set my goal to get in crna is what helped my get in.

If you're trying to get a salary that makes up for loss of 401k, health insurance, PTO etc. you'll need to be getting a hefty raise.   Probably to around 35/hr.

nursing,3bkaew,16semesters,2,Tue Jun 30 01:24:26 2015 UTC,"PRN/per diem will not offer benefits. Most places pay a PRN differential that is significantly higher than base rate, though some places do not have a PRN rate (the hospital I currently work at does not). Honestly, you usually have little say in what your rate will be, especially if you are transferring within the same hospital/network. Most hospitals have a predetermined pay scale based on experience."

nursing,3bjt8u,Kg19,22,Mon Jun 29 20:20:13 2015 UTC,Try the hand drop test. While the pt is supine lift their hand at the wrist so that it is at max height over their face. Then proceed to let go. If their hand hits their face then they are no shit impaired but if the hand falls to the side of the face they are faking it.

No one in nursing will ever be rich unless they come up with some type of miracle :) I work less than 40 hrs. a week, am considered full time and make a decent salary. I don't care if my students will techincally have higher salaries. They work 12-13 hour shifts. I NEVER want to do that again.   I am off for one month at Christmas, 4 months in the summer. I am off for every holiday. I get fall and spring breaks. Paid.  I Iove teaching. I love the time off from teaching.

nursing,3bl59p,nurseintuition,13,Tue Jun 30 02:49:03 2015 UTC,"They kind of have to be. How does anyone advance past being a novice without practicing nursing? I think they need to have a reliable resource person around, but a new grad with a proper orientation is generally able to care for their patients adequately and ask for help when they don't know what to do. No amount of classroom training is going to make you an expert nurse, you just kind of have to jump in and practice until you are good at it.  I don't think it is safe to have a bunch of new nurses working together with no experienced nurses around. I have seen it on units with high turnover rates and it is unsafe."
nursing,3bl59p,wicksa,6,Tue Jun 30 03:31:17 2015 UTC,What would you suggest a novice nurse do other than care for patients? You have to start somewhere. It's not like you cannot ask for help and guidance. It's just like being new at any job.

I also work with amazing people on my unit that encourage me to constantly ask questions when I need to. Even after my orientation, I don't feel alone. I also realized early on that I need to continue studying. I really feel that I only use a fraction of what I learned in school on the floor. I feel asking questions, learning hands on, and reading critical care books that have been recommended to me have helped tremendously."

Orientation prepared me for what I am expected to do on a day to day basis, but I learn something new everyday.    There is no substitute for experience. A nurse who has seen a disease or emergent situation 100 times is usually going to react better and more efficiently then a nurse seeing it for the first time. Luckily, when something serious is happening with a patient, the senior staff always jumps in to help. They are always open to answering questions or explaining something. I have found them to be an invaluable resource on my unit."
nursing,3bl59p,StefaniePags,2,Tue Jun 30 14:08:41 2015 UTC,"Nursing Ed and NCLEX both assume you'll be reasonably trainable on graduation, no more. Then you get trained in whatever role you get hired to do, and they teach about reality, much of which textbooks exclude.  I had stuff to learn when I started, lots of stuff - everybody does. I learned that ""should"" has very little pull in this world of ours, and there are far better paths to success. The first nurse I met in my first job told one not to mess with one aide because ""she told me if I talked to her again, she'd slash my tires."" There was some truth to it, but I assure you, I got my work done, despite sometimes making this person unhpapy, and my tires remained unslashed. I work in psych - I either convince people to do what they need to do, or I get into violence and an avalanche of paperwork. So I learned. I rarely see that sort of paperwork these days.  If a job expects otherwise, it's a bad job."
nursing,3bl59p,gregmercer601,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:09:19 2015 UTC,"New nurses are (generally) provided a preceptor and given at least some orientation time to get better acquainted to the unit they have been hired to.

nursing,3bl59p,destroyingtocreate,-4,Sun Jul 5 09:32:36 2015 UTC,"I think each new grad is soooo different. I know myself I'm graduating knowing I can independently manage an acute medical and emergency department full patient assignment (other than the nursing making the phone calls to the MDs, that'll be a bit of a learning curve for me) But I know students that still needed a lot of help from their preceptor, or students who didn't get to perform their nursing skills on patient. Also some students are more well rounded than others.. I know a grad who did like 4 rotations in neuro but the whole time wanted OB...and another student who did 3 community style rotations.   I found my last year of nursing was really valuable to help me pull it all together, but that is more how many hours I was in clinical not so much the class room. Also it depends on where the student is placed, if they are familiar with the knowledge and skills needed, and how welcoming the team of experienced nurses are. I'm super glad that there is more focus on these new graduate programs that help students transition to the work place.   if tl;dr, Every grad is different, mentors are important and at the end of the day anyone can make mistakes."

This is an arrogant attitude that will make you a pariah with your coworkers. As a new grad your most important task is to learn everything you can during your orientation.  You still need to put in the hours of studying on your days off.     I started as a new grad in the ED and the one thing I would counsel you to do is get rid of your arrogance.  You are setting yourself up for a very difficult time in the ED if that's how you are going into it.  That is, if you even get hired in the ED as a new grad.  You are no where close to being equipped to independently manage an acute full patient load.  Not by a long shot."

What I am saying is that developed strong time management and organizational skills which will help me when I start working.
nursing,3bih76,ukrainekitty,12,Mon Jun 29 14:26:50 2015 UTC,"Always ask questions if you don't understand what's happening with your patient. If someone doesn't want to explain it to you, it may mean that he or she doesn't know either, so keep asking until you get an answer. It's part of developing the ability to stick up for yourself and your patient. The ability to ask questions even when someone is trying to blow you off may mean the difference between acting on your patient's changing condition or not acting. In other words, it may make the difference between early intervention with a good outcome, or late intervention with a bad outcome. Cheers!"

nursing,3bih76,mootmahsn,2,Mon Jun 29 15:22:59 2015 UTC,The thing I first struggled with was the concept of hierarchy; you do not know even a fraction of what a qualified nurse knows yet you should always feel respected on a ward. Some mentors will push you to do things that you may not agree or feel comfortable with- for example a task that you do not believe that you have the skills to do. It is SO important that you work within your skill base and even if pushed by someone of higher authority you should never risk a patients safety- use calm and professional communication to express your fears and don't be afraid to escalate anything that is of serious concern. I have to do this on a recent placement and it was incredibly scary yet rewarding.

If they don't introduce themselves, they're Mr./Mrs. Lastname because that's the respectful default. If it's someone I'm going to be working with awhile, I'll ask them what they want to be called and make a note on my report sheet.   For the confused elderly, first names are usually best.

nursing,3bir8f,fetalbeej,5,Tue Jun 30 00:34:48 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm aware, 1:2 is industry standard for adult ICU staffing. Occasionally you might see a 1:1 for patients undergoing some kinds of complex surgeries or advanced therapies like ECMO or CRRT, but even some of those patients are doubled now that the technology is improving.  If the ICU boards step down or floor patients, it's not uncommon to triple an assignment with the lower acuity patients awaiting transfers out.  Depending on whether you have a rapid response team in place, some hospitals choose to keep their charge out of assignment to act as the ""code blue"" or ""resource"" nurse; others will even include an extra nurse just for that purpose.  I work with many hospital clients; general ICUs range in size from 10-bed to 30+beds, though most health systems that anticipate large ICU volumes will split them into smaller units that are specific to service lines, like having a MICU, SICU, NSICU, etc. rather than a single 60-bed unit, for example.  Hope this was useful, it's all fairly general information, but let me know if you have specific staffing related questions."

TBH it's not your job to prove to these people that you are worth the money you make. Just don't go there in future conversations. I know they might seem like your friends or you might feel some sort of guilt because you were in their position not long ago.

As you said I feel the pay differential is justified because of the higher amount of responsibility and knowledge base that we have. Not to mention the obvious - RN's are licensed to give patient's their medications/treatments and have the knowledge to do so safely. We didn't just twiddle our thumbs for 2-4 years at nursing school. :)  It's also hard to see from a tech prospective what the RN role really involves. Techs are more easily replaces than RNs too.

nursing,3bje69,PolyphonicGoat,2,Mon Jun 29 21:04:43 2015 UTC,"I became a tech when I was 23 years old. After 5 years of this work, I do agree that we are underpaid. I also know that almost anyone in the field have the ability to move forward from CNA work. I would have already studied for my RN if I hadn't made some very poor choices in life and landed dui's. Even though my pay is not what I believe it should be, I have never been bitter about what a nurse makes and I don't think anyone who does have a problem with it understand that nurses have to put their license on the line every day that they punch the time clock. Not only are nurses responsible for the care that they provide personally, but are also responsible for the care that techs provide. If a tech chooses not to turn a patient and said patient develops a bed sore, that is on the nurse. The nurse has so much more at stake than techs. Not to mention having the same level of accountability even if you have to take more patients than you should. I know that you have the right to refuse, but it seems like  some hospitals are happy to call somebody's bluff. I know I am barely breaking the ice with this comment, but I just want to personally say that I truly believe nurse pay is more than justified. If the techs that you work with have any idea what you all have to go through on a day to day basis, they should not criticize what you make. If there are techs that are still bitter after being enlightened, then they will likely stay bitter no matter what is said to them. I mean, they are comparing a 30 day certification to a 4 year degree. All of that being said, wages should stay confidential. Normally any employer would take action in some way if they found out otherwise. I would definitely leave these concerns up to management and save yourself the headache of this backfiring."

Can I tell the patient to stick it out for 30 min of antibiotics? Does pain indicate small infiltration that I can't feel/see?"
nursing,3bfjtb,wallbrack,8,Mon Jun 29 03:51:39 2015 UTC,"If I'm sure it's patent, I think they are just reacting to the sensation of the foreign object in their vein. sometimes I try to reposition the iv, by pulling it back a bit and retaping. or warm compress to the site while it's infusing, or run the drug slower/with NS simultaneously. Or reposition the limb, especially if it's near a joint. If all else fails and I can start a new line I will, if there's no other veins I will coach the pt to basically suck it up. Of course it depends if the infusion is a vesicant, in which case I'd be more cautious. But most people complain about certain drugs like KCl and with these methods they all seem to do ok."

nursing,3bfjtb,Jumanjis_Legit,19,Mon Jun 29 09:08:21 2015 UTC,"No! This is absolutely incorrect. You don't get to change the route of administration without an order. That is outside the nursing scope of practice.  Also, you picked a terrible example. Phenergan (promethazine) is a vesicant. Giving it through an infiltrated IV is known to cause severe tissue damage. Patients who accidentally got it through a bad IV have needed to get fingers, hands, or arms amputated.  Don't do this. Ever. Seriously."

I've also not experienced any of the bullying that some of my female colleagues unfortunately have.  You're not really tested any differently.  Some patients assume you're a doctor, others are tickled pink that they're nurse is make, most don't care either way.  You'll not be treated any differently than your female coworkers."

I'm not confrontational at all, but in both of my positions, I've had to talk to people who were giving me the gears. One I handled with the conciliatory, appreciate your experience method; the other, I was sterner and less nice, 'there is no need to try to make me feel inadequate, we are on the same team'.   I still feel weird about confrontation, but something shifts when you stand up for yourself, no matter if you don't use the ideal word or tone. Demanding respect and not taking bad treatment lying down is important."
nursing,3bgfiv,flsunchick,5,Mon Jun 29 11:25:31 2015 UTC,"Based on my observations, nurses seem to take a lot of self-righteous pleasure in other nurses mistakes.    Like any job, you will work with difficult people. However, the situations that you will find yourself in as a nurse are more intense, and the penalty for error is much much greater. This makes it important to be up-front with people and not be passive aggressive. Own your mistakes (you will make a lot of them. Everyone does) and be humble, but also hold other people accountable for how they speak to you and treat you. Don't be afraid to have a professional conversation with someone who is being shitty to you.     You will have to confront people. Not just your co-workers, doctors, and managers, but your patients as well. I HATED that part of the job, and I still do. But it really doesn't happen often. Being a nurse is great. Don't be scared!"

I feel like I got cheated out of a TON of skills knowledge (still have only started three IVs on real people) and some book knowledge. For example, my Acute and Chronic class was only 6 weeks long, with two classes cancelled and one class day being the final exam.   I've been working now for almost a year and have really only felt ""bullied"" once. A nurse who is known for being kind of vindictive gave me a HORRIBLE assignment, but in her defense I had to have the least Acute (but WORST behaving) babies because I had the least experience. Still, several people came up to help me and said, ""I wouldn't blame you for quitting after your assignment tonight.""  TL;DR: only really once in a year, and it wasn't 100% her fault."

Most of our babies in intermediate have already had their IVs removed but when I do have an IV baby, I pray their IV doesn't go bad because I literally don't know how to start one anymore and am embarrassed to ask someone to help me since I feel I should know by now.  Even though I'm nervous about it, I don't doubt most of the women on my floor would be happy to help. Plus, with babies it's hard for anyone to do those sort of skills by themselves.

And no, this was not just a new nurse having to learn the ropes, trying to get the hang of it all...my coworkers often told me (and on more than one occasion, our unit manager) that they were surprised I hadn't quit because of the way she was treating me. It started out as micromanaging and nitpicking, but there were times she put me in unsafe situations, lied to me/gave me incorrect information, and just generally set me up for failure. I really don't know why I was such a fantastic target for her, but I was...it's like she was trying to drive me away or get me in trouble. THANKFULLY she is no longer a supervisor or even a regular employee at my hospital, so I don't have to deal with her.

They had wound vacs, PICC lines and complex diabetic regimens I'd never encountered.  The biggest things to know is that you will miss things and you will make mistakes. 8 days of training is not enough, I think I had two weeks which still isn't enough. I missed things and made a med error my first week. It's going to take time to learn the routines of the facility and your specific hall but you will get there. The first couple of months will be crucial. Find a GOOD mentor nurse you can rely on for questions and support. Figure out who the good CNAs are- without them you will drown.   When you go in to work focus on your job and the residents, don't try to be buddies with staff, focus on teamwork but not friendships.   You're going to be slow, you're probably not going to leave on time. Your time management will improve. Focus on caring for the residents as best you can. You can't change certain politics in the nursing home environment or what happens when you're not there. All you can do is provide the best possible care while you're on the clock.   Family members will be tough. They will complain more than the residents. Truly listen to what they are saying and take it to heart (even if it seems silly or trivial), most of them are speaking out of fear.   You will have residents you adore and you will have residents you don't care for. That's normal.   Try not to take work home with you, though it's easier said then done.   You can do it! Good luck."

nursing,3bg38z,veryjugs,5,Mon Jun 29 00:17:51 2015 UTC,"If you can, it would be best to show up to work at least a half-hour before your shift starts and start game planning your shift.

nursing,3bffh0,TerminalHappiness,5,Sun Jun 28 19:15:02 2015 UTC,"At our hospital this is common practice for infants getting circumsized, heel lances, or shots. We just give them a few drops and hold them and they're happy babies :) During my clinicals my preceptors had us wear gloves and drop the sucrose onto our pinkies and have the babies suck on them."
nursing,3bffh0,SpicyDubu,5,Sun Jun 28 19:42:49 2015 UTC,"We use it all the time for the infants in my unit (I work in a PICU). Its great for painful procedures, eye exams, and general discomfort. Its a godsend for the pyloric stenosis babies that have to be NPO for days. I prefer drawing a small amount up in a 1ml syringe and administering it PO and then giving them their pacifier, other nurses dip their pacifiers in the cup of sucrose."
nursing,3bffh0,corshap,9,Sun Jun 28 20:01:37 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is what you're looking for, but these are tips I was taught that I pass on to other RNs. I'm a ER RN, not a NICU RN so I probably have a different viewpoint.  Bring more than you think you'll need. You don't want to be running out of the room mid procedure.  Get baby to start sucking on a pacifier first. Then gently squeeze a little in the corner of their mouth. You know you're doing it right when the baby looks a little high.   Show Mom (or Dad, but usually Mom) how to do it. That way they don't feel useless and you can focus on the procedure. Encourage other soothing measures like talking to baby or rubbing baby's head. Not sure if it makes a difference to baby if they're appropriately cracked out on sugar but it sure as hell makes the parents feel better.  As for when to use it--if you're causing pain, use it. If you would sedate an older child for the same procedure, use it. If you aren't sure, use it--it's safe and effective and no one wants to make babies hurt."
nursing,3bffh0,outrunningzombies,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:35:11 2015 UTC,This is great. What's your interval if you're giving another dose mid-procedure? Q4min?
nursing,3bffh0,outrunningzombies,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:07:40 2015 UTC,"It depends on the procedure and the kid's reaction. I've only ever used the prefilled plastic single use things. I put a drop or two in the kid's mouth before I do anything. For an IV or cath I then have Mom slowly give a few drops a few times a minute throughout the procedure, more if the patient starts fussing. I rarely need more than one container.  For LPs, I really really really want the baby to stay completely still (and I don't do them often so I'm intimidated by the procedure) so I give the baby a big squeeze as a loading dose and encourage very frequent dosing by Mom. If we run out during an LP, we open a new container and give it pretty constantly during the procedure.   The orders from the doctors are generally ""Give them however much they need,"" especially since I'm usually doing this on kids a little older than most people in this thread--usually a couple of weeks old, and I've tried it on up to 2 month olds. If you're young enough to get a full septic workup for a fever, I'll try and see if the sugar helps because I'm about to make your life miserable."
nursing,3bffh0,outrunningzombies,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:26:05 2015 UTC,Ah I see. Is 2 months the highest you've seen? I've personally heard nurses saying they'll try it up to 1 year.  Thanks again
nursing,3bffh0,ginnythecat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:32:26 2015 UTC,"I think I once did it on a 6 month old with moderate success. I don't see it as harmful so why not try on older kids.  I did most procedures on kids who were a month or two and kids who were too old for sugar. We really tried to avoid blood draws and IVs--I've given intranasal drugs instead of IV, for example. The kids who most often ended up getting painful procedures were the very young septic workups."
nursing,3bffh0,meeshh,3,Wed Jul 1 23:21:36 2015 UTC,"I use it any time I'm going to do something painful: injections, IV sticks, blood draws, NG insertions, dressing changes.  The only policy my facility has is that circumcisions must use sucrose as pain relief. But we are allowed to use it at our discretion for other painful procedures."
nursing,3bffh0,kitty-cat-meow,3,Sun Jun 28 19:43:34 2015 UTC,"LDRP nurse here. You CAN use too much. Babies will get spitty if they have a big tummy full of sugar water. A little bit goes a long way! Also, if possibly, I have mom feed before the sucrose is given, especially if breastfeeding. This way you are not supplementing a feed and masking hunger with sugar water. Also, a milk drunk baby PLUS sucrose is the best concoction for a happy/pain managed baby.  Edit: spelling."
nursing,3bffh0,meeshh,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:02:58 2015 UTC,"depends on the situation, but i'd be less keen to start an IV/do blood work or something generally painful on a baby after a full tummy. last thing you want is vomit and aspiration. but i agree there can be too much. we generally don't allow more than 2ml in a 24h period. i've also been told too much sucrose can lead to oral aversion in childhood in babes in the NICU (perhaps the connection that something sweet in the mouth leads to a painful stimuli??).  i've been told breastfeeding is a good source of pain management as well (breastfeeding while doing a heel poke or IM injection) but personally I've never tried it."
nursing,3bffh0,NYCarea_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:46:47 2015 UTC,"I typically don't deal with babies older than a couple days so there's not much in their tummies anyway.I can see that with babies older than that though, didn't really think about vomit and aspirating. Never had a newborn puke while doing procedures before! Good point! I never recommend breastfeeding for pain management, at least in the early days because some feel it can create a pain/breastfeeding association. Especially when they're just getting the hang of feeding. To each his own on that one though! There's a couple schools of thought for that."
nursing,3bffh0,laplusbellebete,2,Mon Jun 29 06:43:29 2015 UTC,"I have seen this work in rotations while I was in school when we were in the nursery for circumcisions. What they had was actually the nipple from a bottle, and we would put gauze saturated in sucrose just in the cap/nipple. This allowed the infant to get a steady stream of it and not once did they ""drink"" all of it. Also it allowed for us to soothe by stroking their heads while undergoing what I imagine to be a painful procedure."
nursing,3bffh0,SportsRFun2Watch,2,Sun Jun 28 23:47:13 2015 UTC,"I'm on Maternity/Nursery and frequently use oral sucrose--although we do have the disposable plastic droppers, and we call them ""sweeties."" I definitely second the notion that you can overdo it. Our lactation consultants educated all the RNs that the studies on newborn pain relief show that in combination with sucking, oral sucrose is actually a really good tool. So have a pacifier at the ready, or a gloved finger if pacifiers aren't available. I use them a lot for heel sticks when I do newborn metabolic screens and blood sugar checks, and when the baby is being circumcised. I'll introduce a few drops with the pacifier usually around 10-15 mins before the heel stick/circ and then intermittently give a few more drops. I have noticed that some babies seem to respond much better to it than others. So if I've given an appropriate amount and the baby is still crying, I don't keep giving it. Another important point I'd make is that this is for pain relief--not for fussy babies. I think there's a temptation in our newborn nursery sometimes when  a baby starts crying to drop a couple drops of the oral sucrose in the corner of its mouth when really it needs to eat or have a diaper change. So I think that's worth mentioning if you have a nursery component."
nursing,3bffh0,pammins,4,Mon Jun 29 21:21:02 2015 UTC,"Just dip the paci, and stick it in. I've never worked anywhere where people do the syringe bit. You get both the effect of the sucrose, and the soothing of the paci."
nursing,3bhbfg,brighteyes82,2,Mon Jun 29 05:39:15 2015 UTC,"The ESN program has limited positions and they have a mandatory minimum number of hours you would never be able to make up in a month. Typically, these spots are filled by May-ish when most universities let out. Even the students in the regular nursing program had to work either full time all summer or take shifts into the school year/over Christmas.   Your best bet would be to register as a Care Aide through http://www.cachwr.bc.ca/Home.aspx and find a facility that will hire you. You may be able to work casually throughout the year if you're interested, too. Mental health/addictions support services are huge in Vancouver and Victoria, so I bet you'd have an easy time getting into something if you wanted to stay relatively local. Ask shelters/facilities/day programs/etc if they have positions available, even if only for volunteers. It will pad your resume big time when you apply for nursing jobs. I don't know too much about what's in Vancouver, but I worked acute psych on the island and we had a lot of awesome day programs for mental health clients in the community, including yoga classes, music programs, movie nights, etc. You could definitely get involved with something like that!  Once you finish your program, you should definitely consider working up north. You'll make higher wages and you'll be eligible for a government student loan repayment plan (which Duncan is actually eligible for if you don't want to go too far).   https://studentaidbc.ca/repay/repayment-help/bc-loan-forgiveness-program   If you do register as a Care Aide, consider finding some private 1:1 care provider jobs over Craigslist or similar. There are a lot of people who have special needs kids who need simple things like tube feedings and routine turning, to elderly who want companions, to people with MS who want some assistance, to people with brain injuries who need supports and rehabilitation... There's plenty of work if you're willing! You can even get live-in positions if you want to go somewhere fresh for a month. Just be very clear during the hiring process that you are temporary. Instead of answering ads, you can always post your own. Just remember to work within an appropriate scope of practice.   Also, ask your practicum coordinators if there are any off-site positions you can apply for when the time comes. There are usually postings in the Yukon or Northern/Rural areas across Canada (quite often these are related to nursing in Aboriginal communities, so this could be a unique learning opportunity for you and would be well-suited for your background).   Good luck and have fun!"

nursing,3bgy2c,thatspreetyneat,4,Mon Jun 29 03:16:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with what others say about stress management.  Also, a bit of perspective.  Nursing school does not prepare you to be a nurse.  It prepares you to LEARN to be a nurse.  In the same way that medical school does not prepare one to be a surgeon, nursing school does not prepare one to be a nurse.  It gives you the prerequisite background so you are in a position to acclimate once you get into that environment, but the only thing will make you a nurse is practice.  You just have to do it.    With that in mind, get as much hands on time with patients as you can, and make the most of that time.  Try to challenge yourself with the patients you get for clinicals, (I occasionally took easy patients during weeks with big projects or what not.  you get the idea) and try as many things as you can.  Try to figure out what kind of nursing you want to do, but mostly just ask tons of questions and try things.  The rest will come on it's own.  Also, remember you're not alone, use your classmates/teachers/whoever as a resource, even if it's just for emotional support.    Good Luck!"

I put my lectures on my I pod and listened to them again the same day.  This reinforces info so well.  It's true that college is mostly self study but your teachers will say things that you won't get from the book.  It helps a lot when you're going over difficult concepts. I did not do this until the end of my program and that is the info I can recall the most.   I'll be at work (1.5 years later)  and I can STILL hear my professors' voices on certain topics lol  I found that taking notes during lecture actually distracted me. With the recorder I was able to   Sit back and give  my full undivided attention to the lecture knowing I had it to go home with.  Re listened to it when I studied and then took notes.  I wanted to kick myself in the ass for not getting the recorder sooner!"

On a daily basis you are more than likely coming into direct contact with multiple people with MRSA. You cant possibly protect against all of it.

Could be that you need meds or something as a little boost, but what worked best for me was forcing myself to get up and leave the house once. It felt good, but it wore me out. I made myself do it again, and this time met up with a friend. Then took a day to rest. Repeat. Now I am better at enjoying my time off instead of slumping on the couch all night by myself.  It's hard to force yourself to do things when you feel like that, but it really does make a huge difference in quality of life. Once you notice how much better you feel, it will be way easier to make yourself do things. You may not even have to force yourself anymore - you'll just want to. I made it my new years resolution to say yes to people's invitations more often, and then I told my friends about my resolution so they'd hold me to it. That helped, too.

Don't become nocturnal. On your first day off don't sleep for more than 4 hours. Get out and do something that day. Then sleep to your hearts content at night. Be active during the day time during your days off, plan your life life you normally would Start exercising, it forces you to leave your home :) Don't fall prey to the snacks people inevitably bring in. Eat well.  Talk to a doctor, see if you need some meds to give you a boost. If you struggle to sleep during the day, you might need to figure out what will help you or recognize that nights are a no go for you and adjust your schedule/line accordingly. You need to make really conscious decisions about your routine when you work nights. You have to make the effort to get into the sun, there's no way around it. Some people do better at this than others. I tend to get better sleep on nights because getting up at 530 or 6 for a day shift will drain me a lot more easily than sleeping through the day and living my life through the evening and nights.

Here's what I do, maybe it can help: 1) Attend carefully to your body's needs.  Get enough QUALITY sleep (I use melatonin+fan+eyemask+heavy curtains), drink enough water, eat good quality food (I'm bad about this one).  It's very easy and tempting to short yourself on sleep when you work nights and when you work 12s, but don't.  It'll make everything suck, and the sucking will compound the longer you do it. 2) Not everybody can do it, but I like to block my shifts together so I can go back to a normal human schedule on my time off.  The first month or two like this was a real bitch, but now I'm used to it and prefer to just get it over with so I can be done with being a vampire for a while. 3)Maintain a social life.  If that's with other night shifters, fine.  If it means getting up on your days off, fine.  Do it. You need to be part of a human community where you are more than a resource for other people.  4)Exercise.  of some kind.  Could be biking, walking, jogging, martial arts (my personal favorite, and my answer to #3 as well), yard work, whatever.  Do something non work related with your body that taxes it a little bit.  You don't have to be a triathlete, just do something. 5) Sunshine.  Getcha some.  On those days off, get into the sun for a while.  Even if you fall asleep (I doubt you will), at least get some exposure to the sun.  Failing that, maybe get one of those high power lamps for people with seasonal affective disorder.  This is a tip I picked up in depression support group, it helps a lot of people with alertness, mood, affect, and general symptom management.  I find that getting out in the sun on my days off is enough for me, but you may require more exposure.  I'm not well read on the research behind it, but anecdotaly myself and others I know find it very useful.    Good luck to you, and I hope there's something useful in this for you."

I really hit a wall around the 6 months mark, but a year into it now I'm doing fine.  You're resetting your body's circardian  clock, so it makes sense that it will take some time to adjust.  Make sure you are getting a little exercise and enough sunlight.  I make sure to go for a bike ride or walk/hike every day or at least on my days off."

I wish you the best, I'm still sorting it all out myself. The worst for me is my sleep schedule. I am too wired to sleep when I get home so I'm lucky if I manage 6-7 hours a night.   My favorite days though are the ones where I don't have to set the alarm to get up and the reminder to get dressed for work :) which was today. :D"
nursing,3bdnyu,angelforhirex,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:03:05 2015 UTC,"Don't rely on meds for your depression, that'll mess up your brain chemistry even more. At least you know the root cause of your emotions and such. I would suggest trying to switch to a day shift schedule. Talk to your manager and tell him/her what's going on. Until that's possible, try to get your schedule to be multiple shifts in a row and then have more blocks of days off so you can get back to a normal schedule in your free time. Also, make friends with other night-shifters. My old roommate was also on nights and we would go out for drinks on the mornings of our ""friday"" and we'd hang out late at night and watch movies. Just try to maintain some sort of social life.  As for your eating habits, maybe try to eat more healthy snacks instead of three square meals. On your days off you can try to go back to a normal eating habit, but when working it feels more natural to eat light snacks throughout the night IMO. Almonds, string cheese, PB & J, goldfish, fruit, etc. Are you getting enough sleep during the day?"

nursing,3bcxg7,laxweasel,0,Mon Jun 29 01:32:31 2015 UTC,"Not for a new grad.  Let me give you a good example.  Recently I was speaking to a recruiter in Cali about re-locating to the Cali area. Not San Diego or actually anywhere near SoCal. Not San Fran or in the bay area. But more like Fresno.   This recruiter, knowing I had a BSN, TNCC, 5 years experience, and a CEN could only find me 5k in a sign on/relocation bonus. So they wanted to give me 5k to relocate a 3 person family from the east coast to west coast. Then no additional sign on bonus. And no additional pay for having my BSN/CEN.   Right now the hot specialties are ICU, cath lab/interventional radiology, I think NICU but I'm not entirely sure because my specialty (ED) doesn't ever broach that specialty, and OR. As a new grad you're highly unlikely to get a relocation bonus unless its somewhere that is very undesirable to work.   My advice? Get into a teaching facilities ICU, cath lab, or OR and get about a year to two year's experience. Then you can relocate wherever. For some reason they're not really paying great sign on and relocation bonuses for ED RNs anymore, even those with bachelors, certificates, and experience."
nursing,3bckrt,squiggy241,7,Sat Jun 27 22:57:32 2015 UTC,"The Carpuject drugs I've seen always come in a three-part container. There's a glass vial containing the actual drug, a pointy green cap, and a white plastic bit in between.  The white plastic bit might seem like part of the disposable cap, but it's not. Do not discard it. It's actually the Luer adapter.  The distal end has a male Luer connector that you screw your 25ga needle onto, just like you would screw it onto any other syringe. The proximal side has a tiny recessed needle, which punctures the vial's stopper when you seat the thing into your plunger widget.   (After you do this a few times and figure it out, you may decide to act like every other nurse I've ever met, and just use a regular syringe instead. Drawing up the drug from the Carpuject vial is the same as drawing it from any other type of vial except that you don't need to inject air first.)"
nursing,3bckrt,auraseer,2,Sat Jun 27 23:50:44 2015 UTC,"We draw up at my workplace as well, but wouldn't this just be the same as putting a needle on a regular syringe? They're both luer connectors."

nursing,3bckrt,NurseRattchet,2,Sun Jun 28 05:03:17 2015 UTC,I've been told it's to lessen the risk for sticks by reducing the number of things needing to be drawn up separately as the carpujet is a 'needleless system'.

nursing,3bbvlz,ENRN,6,Sat Jun 27 20:16:19 2015 UTC,"The hospital I work at doesn't allow it. It's a smaller hospital, so it's easier to enforce. The first floor is ed/ICU, 2nd floor is med/tele/surg. Patients with PCA pumps are all labelled as high fall risks and not allowed to wander by themselves. Most patients are on tele and we tell them we lose the tele pack signal if they get on the elevator...so that usually keeps them on the floor. Most people are willing to follow the rules, but every once in a while we have a smoker try to sneak out for a few minutes."
nursing,3bbvlz,Thatsnyetmyname,6,Sat Jun 27 19:29:48 2015 UTC,"This has been a big issue for us lately. The rule at my facility is that they can come and go as they please. Technically, they are supposed to have their peripheral IV removed before they walk outside, but nobody enforces that. That would mean starting new lines on incredibly hard sticks and the patient would have to come tell you they are leaving to go smoke or whatever. They aren't going to do that knowing it means a re-stick when they get back.   The policy is they have to have been gone for 2 whole hours before we can declare them gone AMA. It's ridiculous. I ran into this recently where my patient just disappeared while I was off rounding with a physician. Had to call security and wait the 2 hours before I could do anything else.   At that point, you have to call the local police and have them try to find the person to bring them to a medical facility for IV removal. The whole thing is absurd and has led to a culture of patients thinking they can do whatever they want and spend an hour and a half outside.    I understand people have rights, but honestly if you are well enough to spend an hour across the street smoking, why are you in the hospital? The truth is these people are not well enough. I have a feeling if something happened to them outside, we would be liable because our policy allows them to go.   Idk, I just have a lot of strong opinions on this because it's causing us a lot of issues."
nursing,3bbvlz,brenna8806,2,Sat Jun 27 20:36:13 2015 UTC,"We're having this exact same issue! Last week, we had a pt who seemed to go hypoglycemic every couple of hours, and she kept wanting to go downstairs and smoke. Being short staffed on techs that day, I tried to keep her there as long as I possibly could, but she finally just left without telling anyone. So, there I am thinking that she's downstairs passed out somewhere. It's extremely concerning, and I feel like it's going to come back and bite me in the ass one day as me getting fired or a pt suing me."
nursing,3bbvlz,dandelion_k,2,Sat Jun 27 21:50:28 2015 UTC,"Chart the shit out of it, every time.

nursing,3bbvlz,Bruhahah,2,Sun Jun 28 01:04:29 2015 UTC,I don't know about your facility but we have them all sign a waiver that says whatever they do when they're off the unit isn't our fault and they accept any risks and consequences related to going off the unit. It's part of the same packet as our consent to treat and valuables inventory for new patients.
nursing,3bbvlz,dat_joke,3,Mon Jun 29 14:16:59 2015 UTC,"I'm in a locked unit, so no issue there.  For the medical side, I've heard them offer patients an AMA if they refused to follow hospital rules on safety (including staying in patient areas)"

nursing,3bbvlz,dandelion_k,3,Sun Jun 28 00:50:30 2015 UTC,"I'm on a tele unit; the entire reason you're on this unit is because there is a reason to monitor your heart. If you leave the unit, we can't do that. In some cases, the doc allows them off unit if they sign a waiver and come back within a certain amount of time.   But if they have a PCA pump or other drip, especially titrated, it's a no go. Sorry, but you can't walk around with 50mg of dilaudid hanging, even if it is in a locked case. In that case, if they insist, our doctors are typically happy to inform them that we will stop their PCA (completely) if they leave the unit. That usually gives them reason for a pause."
nursing,3bbvlz,aeshleyrose,2,Sun Jun 28 01:01:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, but there's nothing we can really do about it. I just had a methodone patient come in for preop assessment, go out for a smoke, and come back visibly intoxicated. Sucks, but I have no interest babysitting or restraining them. If the patients are bedbound (CS fractures, ICH's, etc) they get Niccotine patches to alleviate the need to go outside to smoke. Besides that, nothing else we can do."

nursing,3bbvlz,ginger__ninja,2,Sun Jun 28 01:18:08 2015 UTC,"Uhhh is it normal to confine your patients to the ward? Granted, its a pain in the arse when they don't tell you they're leaving, but if they're well enough to walk off the ward, and good enough to tell you where they are going and how long they will be, I don't see what the problem is?"
nursing,3bbvlz,jennafezz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:15:13 2015 UTC,We don't let them off the unit without a staff member present. If they want to leave they can sign out AMA. There have been a few exceptions that I've seen but that's always cleared with an MD order.

nursing,3bbvlz,Rawrzimon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:44:59 2015 UTC,We have a 2 hour limit. If the patient is off the floor for two hours we discharge them out the system. There are some patients that are frequent walkers so we'll time everytime they aren't in their room.

nursing,3bbvlz,Yappypants11,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:42:37 2015 UTC,We said they couldn't leave the hospital. If they are on any precautions or pain meds they can't leave the floor technically.

nursing,3bbvlz,duckface08,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:32:31 2015 UTC,"I'm currently on a step-down/tele unit, so none of our patients leave because they're considered unstable and need to be monitored continuously.  When I was on the floor, though, it was very situation dependent, but overall, we let people on and off the floor all the time. We had a fair amount of independent patients who were well aware of their limits and compliant with all treatments and precautions (yay, oncology), and they were often on our unit for weeks at a time, so it was nice for them to be able to get out and walk around. We had a sign in/out sheet so we knew if patients were off unit.  The times they weren't allowed were if they were confused (obviously; if they were stable, though, they were allowed off unit with a family member), unstable, had chemo or blood products infusing, or were formed for whatever reason (rare, since we weren't a psych unit, but it happened). We would let people off the unit with PCAs but we mostly used those for people who really needed it (i.e. palliative patients or those with completely uncontrolled pain) plus our PCAs are heavy and locked tight, so I don't think we ever had real issues with them getting abused off-unit.  Were there problems with people going off the unit? Of course, mostly related to people doing drugs or something in the parking lot (not drugs they obtained from the hospital; they'd meet their ""friends"" outside the hospital and return high or smelling of alcohol), but these are the people you can't change or fight and have well documented substance abuse issues. All we could do was chart and report the behaviour to the doctor. We had one patient have a grand mal seizure in the cafeteria while he was getting a coffee, but besides that, I don't think anyone had any medical issues while off the floor while I was there."
nursing,3bbvlz,Bruhahah,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:00:43 2015 UTC,"We can't legally stop them by force and frankly I don't want that to be part of my job. They sign a waiver of responsibility when they're admitted for any trips off the unit and as long as it's not a problem, that's all we do.  It has been a problem though. Had a patient getting high as a kite with her boyfriend and wandering around our massive hospital. Mostly, she was gone so much (4-5 hours at a time) that she was missing her antibiotics doses and was effectively noncompliant. We told her she had to stay on the unit or we couldn't treat her, so she signed herself out."

nursing,3b9uzj,amoonandthreestars,3,Sat Jun 27 05:24:10 2015 UTC,What kind of experience do you have to have to do that?
nursing,3b9uzj,amoonandthreestars,2,Sat Jun 27 05:34:06 2015 UTC,"The one job I'm looking into requires LTC and home healthcare experience. Familiarity with Medicare/ Medicaid billing and ICD 9 coding.   It also says there is traveling 75% of the time.   I saw the job listed in two different states, both with the same company. I'm going to apply to both. As long as it's down south and  I don't have to worry about two feet of snow falling in one night during the winter, I'm not too concerned which state I end up in."
nursing,3b9uzj,_idgie,2,Sat Jun 27 05:49:12 2015 UTC,I definitely agree about the snow. Part of why I'd like to move back to southern California or Vegas or Phoenix. Somewhere where it's highly unlikely to bring snow.

nursing,3b9uzj,CCCP85,3,Sun Jun 28 00:24:43 2015 UTC,I have been an LPN for about 2 years. I work at a LTC/subacute facility doing wound care. Taking my wound care certification in a couple weeks. Love what im doing.  Plan on starting a rn program next year

nursing,3b9uzj,The_Jaj,3,Sat Jun 27 23:13:23 2015 UTC,"If I could change anything, I would get a loan and go right for the BSN. I would have finished years ago. I've worked throughout school so it was always a money/time investment and what I could afford. As far as going one step at a time, I think it's cheaper and all of the programs I've attended are accredited so I don't think I'm at any sort of disadvantage over a straight to RN program."
nursing,3b9uzj,organicvegetable,2,Sun Jun 28 02:13:41 2015 UTC,I have a question for everyone. What's your scope of practice in comparison to RNs in your state/province?
nursing,3b9uzj,The_Jaj,2,Sat Jun 27 11:08:28 2015 UTC,"New York here - we can't touch PICC lines, can't hang first bag of IV fluids, and can't do a head-to-toe assessment. Also can't push IV meds."
nursing,3b9uzj,diatom15,2,Sat Jun 27 23:11:56 2015 UTC,"I just realized you said you aren't allowed to do a head to toe assessment. How do they support that decision? If you have patients, does an RN have to step in to do a head to toe assessment?"
nursing,3b9uzj,nursebeast,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:50:37 2015 UTC,Also can't start IVs unless your facility trains you to do it.
nursing,3b9uzj,Derparita,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:14:37 2015 UTC,A lot of it is specific to a facility. As an RPN on a surgical floor I can't push IV meds but I can hang them and start IVs. I can work with central lines and hang blood. The RNs take the more sick/unstable patients. I am undecided about upgrading to RN at this point.
nursing,3b9uzj,organicvegetable,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:05:47 2015 UTC,"That's the same where I am. Are you in Ontario?   Edit: I'm also hesitant about going to upgrading to RN. Where I am, they are pushing to hire more RPNs than RNs."
nursing,3b9uzj,seestarehotface,3,Tue Jun 30 08:51:03 2015 UTC,"Yes Ontario. I find it weird they way the jobs are going. My facility is definitely RN heavy but it's a smaller hospital, I know bigger hospitals are hiring more RPNs. My main reason in favour of upgrading would be more opportunity for full time work but then again you never know with the way the job market swings."

nursing,3ba134,celticfaye,8,Sat Jun 27 05:27:56 2015 UTC,"I honestly think you're thinking too much about it - there is a transition, but honestly as someone who works at a hospital that has everything, I take my hat off to our rural friends who do so much with so little - people think we are such great nurses being able to care for patients on IABP or ECMO but the real saving grace isn't us and our equipment but the rural nurse who was able to keep the coronaries perfusing without our fancy tools!"
nursing,3ba134,ENRN,6,Sat Jun 27 12:00:51 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a nurse who works at a semi-rural hospital in a medium sized city (in the middle of nowhere), who gets big city nurses from time to time, don't listen to them. Yes, there's things you didn't have at your hospital, but that doesn't mean you are less of a nurse. Here's some perspective --- often, the big city nurses who come to us lack basic skills like putting in an IV (because they had an IV nurse, or IV team) and/or were so specialized that they are shocked that we can manage all kinds of different issues without specialization and we have a lot of autonomy.  And yes, some of our skills are old school, but old school isn't neccesarily bad.  I previously worked in a huge metropolis and SOME, though not all, of our ""cutting edge"" nursing crap was related to cost effectiveness, not because it was neccesarily better.    Basically, these people have never worked in rural health, and have no idea what it takes to work in rural health, so don't let them minimize your nursing judgment or skills.  Rural nursing is it's own dog, and there's a reason most rural hospitals want experienced nurses only.  Your skills need to be the shit and you have to know what you're doing.  And yes, it's ""old school"" because you have to use actual skills, not technology."
nursing,3ba134,crumblypeeps,3,Sat Jun 27 14:00:23 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily agree with their distrust of you, but it is understandable. You're a nurse with experience, but...without the experience they necessarily need.  To some extent, think of yourself as kind of new again. Yes, you have patient care skills and experience, but when you're going from a hospital that was stuck in a different era to a modern one, your entire thought process has to change. Procedures are different, so your post-care will be different. Labs are different, so how you'll respond to varying incidents will be different. It takes time to relearn all that.  But I say it more because you'll have to think this way to get into the fold, so to speak. Be proactive and appear as ready to learn as a new nurse. The best way to show them you can be one of them is by striving to be that, and to show that you can adapt and change. It'll be the best way to overcome the challenge on several different levels."
nursing,3ba134,dandelion_k,-1,Sat Jun 27 12:01:36 2015 UTC,"Labs are not different in rural care, a CBC is a CBC."

nursing,3ba134,dandelion_k,-5,Sat Jun 27 14:55:51 2015 UTC,"I know what an ABG is as I'm sure that most nurses do since that is like basic nursing school education (and for the record, yes we order ABGs at my hospital all the time). Just because a hospital doesn't do them, which I question, doesn't mean you don't know what they are.  I don't think you are understanding the level of emergent care that many rural nurses are faced with. You will see some crazy stuff working at a rural hospital."
nursing,3ba134,crumblypeeps,6,Sat Jun 27 15:18:25 2015 UTC,"As I was leaving my old job they were in the process of purchasing the necessary equipment to do ABGs. Even then it sounded like it would only be used in extreme circumstances. Most of the lab personnel seemed very unsure about having it.   In my original post, I was more so just using ABGs as an example. I was trying to convey how there is quick and easy access to more specialty lab values, and how the idea of not having this, to my new coworkers, seemed like bad practice."
nursing,3ba134,dandelion_k,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:40:30 2015 UTC,"I gotcha. I hope my post didn't come as though I expect you to kowtow to the other nurses; that's not what I mean at all! Just put a fresh face forward and look forward to learning the updated procedures and labs. It's not always an easy transition, but I think nurses who have done both rural and metro nursing have some of the most well rounded skill sets."
nursing,3ba134,dandelion_k,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:19:12 2015 UTC,"My third job was working in a rural hospital. OP is the one that stated they don't do ABGs at her hospital, so question them, not me.  Again, my point is that if you aren't used to different labs during different scenarios, you have to learn when they need ordered. Even going from a metro hospital, to a rural hospital, and back again I had to relearn when different labs are expected.   What I said:     ""Labs are different, so how you'll respond to varying incidents will be different""   What I DID NOT say nor insinuate:   OP and/or rural nurses don't know what an ABG is Nurses in rural areas don't do emergent care.   Kindly get off my dick now, thanks."
nursing,3ba134,crumblypeeps,0,Sat Jun 27 15:27:57 2015 UTC,"I apologize if I sound like I'm jumping down your ass, but here's the thing.  There's going to be a transition in understanding in lab values in transition to ANY specialty. Rural nursing is it's own speciality.  It doesn't mean the nurse isn't well trained, or has an underlying lack of overall nursing knowledge, they just have a different set of priorities. I'm an oncology nurse, if I transitioned to tele, I'd have to learn to understand what labs are a priority. And good luck for anyone who wants to come work in oncology, our labs are crazy across the board.  On reading your post again, I see that I interpreted what you said incorrectly, so I apologize for that."

There's no way I can ""verbally deescelate"" a violent patient alone. If someone got violent on me,  I told my boss I am hiding and calling 911 (it was a different layout).  Especially if you work outpatient. Outpatient is very different from inpatient. Inpatient you have the training and legal right to restrain a patient or hold them down until they promise to calm down. Outpatient, you do not have the same legal rights."

nursing,3b9jge,tanukisuit,3,Mon Jun 29 01:04:02 2015 UTC,"PRN PRN PRN PRN When I do my admissions assessment and I see even the tiniest hint of aggression in their history I will make sure I order SOME kind of PRN. It's pretty much standard for all of our patients to have SOME kind of PRN PO or IM whether it's Ativan, Geodon, or Benadryl (or all 3 which we call The Hammer). If the patient is a danger to themselves or others or making active threats of violence we will attempt all of our non-physical measures such as verbal de-escalation, diversional activities, offer PO medictations for agitation, unlocked timeouts (ask them to go to their rooms to calm down). If we are unable to redirect the patient through previous means we can call a Code Atlas (combative client) and basically all male staff including security guards and police officers in the facility will respond and we will subdue the patient and take them into the seclusion room or, if indicated, implement 4 point restraints. If by chance the patient is just super violent, the RNs can make the call to place them immediately into seclusion or 4 points and give them an emergency injection of whatever PRN they have ordered for them. If they don't have any medications available our on-call physician WILL order one for you. Since our priority is patient safety which includes the safety of all the other clients on the mileu, staff on my unit will not hesitate to call a code atlas. Now, of course we stay within state and hospital protocol, we cannot leave patients unattended in restraints or a seclusion for more than an 2 hours for an adult and 1 hr for adolescents/children and we must obtain a physicians order within the first hour of seclusion/restraints. And, yes, if you are wondering if we have to do a F*** ton of documentation when these things occur. And, yes, i have clocked out 2 hrs past the end of my shift finishing up paperwork for these occurrences.   I work on Acute Psychiatric Care for Children/Adolescents and average LOS is around 5-7 days sometimes we have clients stay for more than 30 days if they are from foster care or a group home. Usually when the kids come to us they're at a point where they've caused such a terrible scene at these facilities that they are no longer eligible to return, so they stay with us for months because finding placement for them is like taking a journey to Mordor.  Also, if need be, if the clients are absolutely not responding to any of our interventions, we have a Psych ICU unit right across the hall that we can transfer them to for a more close observation/monitoring until they are stable enough to return to their previous units. Treatment, no matter what kind it is, whether its behavioral or cognitive therapy, will be ineffective if the patient's anxiety/agitation level is unmanageable. so we really try to stabilize them with MEDICINE first so that the rest can soak in better.  anyways... (sorry for the long response, i saw this as an opportunity to vent)  I just wanted to thank you for post, it made me realize how good I have it at my facility. We have so many measures and means to keep the clients (and staff) safe, BUT, there was also something you said in your post that got my attention. You stated that there have recently been more aggressive clients coming through the door which has been an increasing concern at my facility as well. I heard from my director that we've had more aggressive/combative/violent clients admitted in this past year than any other year. The kids that come in these days come in ready to **** staff up. Most present as oppositional defiant, superficial, with poor insight on their admitted issues. i was secretly wondering to myself if this was also a problem at other psych facilities as well and i think you answered my question. Yeah, I love my job at times, but there are a lot of difficult aspects I have to deal with as well. For instance last week on one 8 hour evening shift when I was charge nurse I had to admit 8 patients all at once. and they came in 2s or 3s. We had 2 RNs, and 2 MHTs (mental health techs). Our census was 16 so about 8 adolescents (13-17 yrs old) and 8 children (5-12 yrs old). Most of the diagnoses were ADHD x10000, Oppositional Defiant D/O, with vast history of aggression, past sexual/physical trauma, treatment savvy kids who have been in and out of psych faciltiies their whole lives, on top of that since they're adolescents they don't have a definitive Axis II DX, but they are definitely in the works of developing borderline traits. It was a mess... i know the words ""under staffed"" are taboo these days but damn were we... it's definitely unsafe practice... which is why if u look through my reddit history i was inquiring about legal insurance.   anyways before i rant even further I just want to say, yeah your facility sounds like my worst nightmare, but atleast in a BIG inpatient facility with LOTS of money you will have adequate staff support to address issues with combative/aggressive/non compliant patients. your post has been on my mind a lot ever since i read it, I wish you the best of luck and if it were me i would consider looking into a facility with a good reputation and turnover rate....   again i'm sorry if made you real all of that and you got nothing out of it but please let me know if you have any other questions."
nursing,3baqj4,MaK_Ultra,15,Sat Jun 27 12:09:28 2015 UTC,"It doesn't bother me.  I really have never thought about the sidebar of this subreddit. Whether or not fibromyalgia is technically a real disease, a psychosomatic or a psychiatric disease doesn't bother me either.  To that person, it's real, and it's not my job to diagnose or judge them.  When I have those patients, I maintain their current medication home regimen, when possible, and treat them like any other patient. I haven't had many fibromyalgia patients who are drug seekers.  On my floor, the drug seekers I do get tend to be actually pretty sick - (liver failure, detox, endocarditis, cancer, cellulitis, sepsis), so they're getting meds anyway so it doesn't really matter in the long run."
nursing,3baqj4,crumblypeeps,9,Sat Jun 27 13:49:07 2015 UTC,"I just wonder why that got picked as one of the few disease subreddits that we list. We don't have links to /r/dementia, /r/asthma, /r/transplant, or any of the dozens of others that surely exist. I would prefer either more disease subreddits, or none at all.  As for the disease itself, I accept that research shows it exists as a real medical condition, but I can't prove I have ever seen it. Since by definition there are no objective signs, it is a very easy condition to lie about when a patient seeks drugs or just attention. My impression is that the majority of fibro complaints I've seen in the ED have not been legitimate.  (Of course I know my sample is very biased, because most people with chronic medical problems have them managed by PCP and not the ED.)  I will say I'm happy that current research shows that opioids are inappropriate for chronic fibromyalgia pain. Once we adopted that into hospital policy, we suddenly got a lot fewer ""fibro flare"" complaints coming to ED."
nursing,3baqj4,auraseer,9,Sat Jun 27 17:56:56 2015 UTC,"It was put there years ago because someone probably asked the mods.  We get requests like that every once in awhile.   Fibromyalgia is real in the sense that the symptoms patients are experiencing are real. I doubt it's a specific and distinct physiological disease state, but that doesn't mean you don't treat them.  For what it's worth there's no evidence that benzos or opiates/opiods help what is known as fibromyalgia, so you can usually explain as much to the patients. The ones that listen to you are legitimate, the ones that just scream for dilaudid are just using it this week and will use ""bulging disk"" next week."

She quit work and went on disability. She was an OR nurse and while I know the job requires lifting and standing, she never had any issues volunteering for her daughter's school events that had similar requirements. The hospital actually sent someone to take pictures of her and she lost some kind of pension.   In practice, when I come across a chronic pain patient, they get what they take at home. The exception is if they've had surgery. When I was a new grad on a surgical floor it took me a few months to realize the chronic pain patients were working me for more pain meds."

I don't tell my coworkers about it because of the prejudice; and I never complain about my pain.  Hell, I had the same thoughts before my diagnosis...thought it was psychosomatic or didn't exist.  I don't seek pain meds.  I take Lyrica to help me make it through 12 hour shifts and I have to get my sleep.   I honestly don't see many drug seekers in PCU with FM...more with chronic back pain.

nursing,3b8ohh,OllyPolly,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:35:59 2015 UTC,Research how long it takes to get the license and how much it costs. Find this on the Dept of Health website for each state. I've held RN licences in 5 states and they cost from $45-225 and took 3-6 weeks. Keep in mind the last time I moved was 11 years ago so maybe things are faster now? In some states you can pay an extra fee to get a temporary license.  One time I was moving to Georgia near the border so I went ahead and got a Florida license as well- they were each pretty cheap so it was worth it to have both so I could start working sooner.  If you are looking at a state with a long processing time it might be worth it to apply for a license as soon as you get an interview.   I don't know anything about insurance companies or travel nursing.   Good luck- I think what you're doing is awesome and brave!

The 'junction' is the junction between the atria and the ventricles, where the AV node sits. In junctional rhythm, the electrical impulse is coming from the locus of tissue from the 'junction' between the atria and the ventricles.  Normally the impulse comes from the sa node, your hearts natural pacemaker. In junctional, this is not the case."

nursing,3b83ld,Salty_Tomato,12,Fri Jun 26 18:56:56 2015 UTC,"Well I can't talk about the 50's or 60's, but I graduated in 1971 - and it was a breeze! Salaries were more than I'd ever made before.  Worked for awhile in MGH in Boston on a male medical floor - which was, at that time, in the old Bullfinch building. Maybe a 16 bed ward.   I never had more than two patients (on day shift), and once had to actually argue with an intern that I would empty the bedpan (he did it!) Went to numerous inservices held by the attendings on subjects like malignant hypertension and rare tropical diseases some patient had. The docs would just come up and ask if you wanted to attend.   Patients got so much nursing time - that was the era of 'therapeutic conversations' - whether the patient wanted to or not lol. Everyone had help with bedbaths and back rubs were an essential part of P.M.care. Not like you were busy doing other things.  Also worked in the first NICU in our state. There was such camaraderie, with everyone working together. Nurses drew umbilical blood gases, assessed the lab results and made changes to the ventilator without ever being expected to confer with an M.D. We drew our own blood to give babies transfusions, and, although we scrubbed our hands up to elbows so often our skin was raw, we also uncapped needles with our teeth and re-capped without worry. It was a different world and one that was much more pleasant, in my opinion.  When I worked in dialysis the rats used to fill the alley, trying to get into the dumpsters for the blood. But nurses had first dibs.....we took it home to make our rose bushes thrive, and they sure did!  There is absolutely no comparison with today's nursing and I am so glad I got into it before it got to where it is now! Maybe we didn't know all the in depth answers but we all worked together, for the patient's benefit. We didn't 'cure' but we sure did have time to 'care' - and it showed.  Good luck to all you new nurses. I remember the excitement of graduation and finding out (3 months later) that I'd passed the board exam. Please always try to remember how grateful patients are for a hand being held, feet tucked in with a blanket from the warmer (ha, do they even still have those?) and that you always have time for kindness."

But with correlation from other older nurses it sounds like those still training (In Australia back in the Dark Ages, training was undertaken by hospitals) attended most patient care."
nursing,3b83ld,Secretively,5,Fri Jun 26 21:01:45 2015 UTC,"I think they were referring mostly towards the ever expanding scope of practice of Advanced Practice nurses (Nurse Practitioners etc.) as that is a common topic of discussion among MDs recently. However, I recently read a passage in ""Policy and Politics in Nursing and Health Care"" that discussed a pivotal event in nursing. I know this is a little further back than the obligatory ""old days"", but it is where nursing diverged from hand maidens of the MDs due to their own accountability:  ""The primacy of loyalty as a nursing ethic came under attack in 1929 in a most unusual place. In a hospital in Manila, The Philippines, a physician ordered a new graduate nurse, Lorenza Somera, to administer cocaine injections, instead of procaine injections, to a tonsillectomy patient (Winslow, 1984). Somera loyally carried out the physician’s order, resulting in the death of the patient. Although it was clear that the physician had erred in ordering the incorrect medication, he was acquitted of all charges while Somera was found guilty of manslaughter for failing to question the orders of the physician (Winslow, 1984). The Somera case sparked worldwide protests from nurses and served to push nursing toward independent practice and accountability.""  Since then our role as independent from MDs evolved greatly. We are our own profession, with standards that we are required to uphold, even if that means striking an MD who tries to do something that may harm the patient. (I once struck a resident who was about to shock a patient that two of my coworkers were working on without checking if it was clear)   On top of that, the AMA and affiliates have failed for years to address issues of provider shortages.  To fill this void, RNs have steadily gained increasing responsibilities.  NP scope of practice is greatly expanding as a means to fill the void left by MD provider shortages. (regulations vary state to state)"
nursing,3b83ld,Masters_of_Sleep,2,Sat Jun 27 01:36:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, they were speaking of nurse practitioners and their expanding scope of practice.

nursing,3b83ld,DanKC,2,Sat Jun 27 03:43:11 2015 UTC,"So check out Florence Nightingales notes on nursing, its pretty good (probably idealized) idea of what nursing was in 1860.   http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/nightingale/nursing/nursing.html  I wonder what the physicians were talking about, I am not aware of any point in recent history that they did much more hands on patient care. Specific procedures have gone back and forth, and example is that originally only physicians took blood pressures. In the 80s in my area it was common practice for RNs in the ER to preform sutures, chest tubes, trachs and intubation then they changed policies and now many of those skills are primarily NP and very rarely (if at all) RN skills even with extra training.  I suspect they were talking about NPs doing more diagnosing and prescribing. But even that is not as new as they might like to think, before WW2 public health/visiting nurses did alot more of that kind of work then we think of today."

nursing,3b83ld,captain_thrace,-3,Sat Jun 27 06:36:27 2015 UTC,"1887 Nursing Job Description  In addition to caring for your 50 patients, each bedside nurse will follow these regulations:   Daily sweep and mop the floors of your ward, dust the patient’s furniture and window sills. Maintain an even temperature in your ward by bringing in a scuttle of coal for the day’s business. Light is important to observe the patient’s condition. Therefore, each day fill kerosene lamps, clean chimneys and trim wicks. The nurse’s notes are important in aiding your physician’s work. Make your pens carefully; you may whittle nibs to your individual taste. Each nurse on day duty will report every day at 7 a.m. and leave at 8 p.m., except on the Sabbath, on which day she will be off from 12 noon to 2 p.m. Graduate nurses in good standing with the director of nurses will be given an evening off each week for courting purposes, or two evenings a week if you go regularly to church. Each nurse should lay aside from each payday a goodly sum of her earnings for her benefits during her declining years, so that she will not become a burden. For example, if you earn $30 a month, you should set aside $15. Any nurse who smokes, uses liquor in any form, gets her hair done at a beauty shop or frequents dance halls will give the director of nurses good reason to suspect her worth, intentions and integrity. The nurse who performs her labors [and] serves her patients and doctors faithfully and without fault for a period of five years will be given an increase by the hospital administration of five cents per day."

First vaginal exam I ever did in L&D and meconium stained amniotic fluid is suddenly EVERYWHERE. I jumped back and it only got on my shoes. I was wearing super comfy, super ugly clogs that other people had made fun of me for, but I was so glad to be wearing waterproof shoes at that moment.  There was also the patient with breasts who identified as a woman but when we went to help her clean up a massive puddle of melena, she had a penis. This was as I was dropping her off in the ICU (I stayed to clean her up--she had a massive explosion as soon as the bed entered the room) and we hadn't done report yet and the ICU RN never let me live down the surprise penis."

nursing,3b8c6v,ginger__ninja,2,Fri Jun 26 22:58:56 2015 UTC,"So you should also check your state rules/regs RT protocols/standing orders. In some states a clinician needs to have a face to face before they can legally sign orders, usually the exceptions are for EMS and Public Health. Also in most states RNs cannot legally recommend OTC meds.  The model that might be more appropriate is the model used in public schools.   The parent provides the medication in either a prescription bottle with the label or in original OTC bottle and provides a order from the physician along with a signed permission slip.   This does three things,   Having the parent provide the medications you are not dispensing (breaking pharmacy practice) Clinicians order means that you can legally administer the meds as ordered. Parents signature means you have parental approval to do the first two.   Just an FYI a prescription bottle does not constitute a legal order, so you cant administer meds based on a bottle/RX label alone."

If they're not on the floor and some shit goes down and they're still not in, they get written up for patient abandonment. I'm not obligated to stay if they're not on the unit. I don't get paid OT, I'm not obligated to given verbal report. I have gotten the ""can you give me verbal?"" When they show up at 6:59am. ""I wrote it in report""."

I have my license to work in the U.S., since I live on the border but the mat leave is horrendous there, most hospitals around where I thought of applying have no Union and I was told if my relief didn't show up I had to stay till it was covered. The wages are good though there and I know these hospitals are state of the art - you can move up the ladders real quick and they'll help with any extra education if you want to train in a certain department? I'm sure you have computer charting, too? There's trade offs. We have Stone Age charting and have to write our assessments on a stick man (seriously) and we have no PSW's. I'm a RN and I do everything. I heard over here you don't and there's plenty help.  I sometime don't get to check my labs till 11am."

I'm supposed to be signed out for 0715 every morning, but it's impossible when your relief doesn't come in until 0710 and you're reporting on two ICU patients. the worst is when your report is split, and one nurse is punctual so you think you MIGHT actually get out on time, but - wait - the other one is notorious for showing up whenever they feel like it, good luck not being forced to stay late.   people who are habitually late like this drive me nuts. it's a complete lack of respect. once in awhile? sure. totally get it. I will need the return slack when I get stuck in random traffic or sleep through my alarm. but every single day? it's basically like saying ""fuck you, my time is more important than yours."""

That same nurse (when it's time for her to go home) flags me down and summons me with her finger to come get report from her. So rude and disrespectful ... I don't like to be passive aggressive but after I realized how she is, I take my sweet time to get report from her. It's not worth it to talk to her about her behavior because she is one of those types that will be very defensive and will give so much attitude about it.

nursing,3b61vc,My-Little-Throw-Away,5,Fri Jun 26 07:01:35 2015 UTC,"Yes. In the US you will earn significantly less pay (1/2 or 2/3s less in many cases) and have a harder time finding work. Many hospitals will no longer higher LPNS and most work in nursing homes. (No LPN hate here. I love all nurses. This is just the truth) In the US the differences vary by state. For example, in Georgia an LPN cannot do the initial patient assessment as well as a few other things. In other states an LPN cannot do IV push medications or conscious sedation. Any additional certifications or degrees are helping in giving you an edge over other candidates, but for your first nursing job they are likely not going to translate into additional pay.    Good luck!"

nursing,3b61vc,monstertrucktoadette,2,Fri Jun 26 18:49:24 2015 UTC,"YAY AUSTRALIANS!  i think becoming an EN is a great idea.  There is a lot of work for EN's bc they pay us less and these days we do pretty much all the same things as an RN anyway.    Tbh the money isn't THAT much different in the early stages, especially taking into account that you won't have HECS to repay.    Pretty much all you won't be able to do is be officially in charge in a hospital environment.  I think EN's work as in charges in some aged care places though.  Check out ANF in your state for courses.   I wouldn't bother with the aged/disability course unless you think the extra study would help you.  I think if you can work now keep doing that.    I also think once you have done six months to a year of your nursing diploma register with an agency as a PCA.  The experience you get doing that will be so valuable to working as a nurse, both in terms of finding a job and actually feeling confident at doing your job.  Imo it helped me even more than placements did.    Lots of EN's get their RN later if that's something you want to do.  I'm doing it online which i find better than in person.  Even the diploma is pretty academic though."

While not everyone has trouble, it isn't uncommon. It is tough if you're a new grad without any connections.  An ASN with experience shouldn't have as much of a problem in the community hospitals, especially if they are in BSN bridge or will sign a commitment to get a BSN in X years."

They hire associates nurses because they're whole system is magnet and can afford a larger percentage of associates allowed. I know Rush Oak Park, Cook County, Kindred and some Advocate system hospitals hire associates nurses too.  It has alot to do with the magnet status and other factors.

My new unit only gave me 8 training shifts and there was no education available so I was basically thrown in the deep end and told 'good luck'. I lost a lot of self confidence and am still working on feeling competent. Definitely would not recommend following in my footsteps, however a lot of the issues are rooted in my specific employer and not in the overall idea of transitioning from one area to another.  One thing I have noticed, if you are a caring, competent psych nurse, you develop good listening skills. These are valuable everywhere and your patients will love that you pay attention to what they say rather than simply ask about physical symptoms.  Medsurg is interesting in a completely different way, but my heart is still with the psych tribe."

nursing,3azkre,autowikibot,7,Thu Jun 25 00:11:12 2015 UTC,"The Yellow Wallpaper:       ""The Yellow Wallpaper (original title: ""The Yellow Wall-paper. A Story"") is a 6,000-word short story by the American writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman, first published in January 1892 in The New England Magazine.  It is regarded as an important early work of American feminist literature, illustrating attitudes in the 19th century toward women's health, both physical and mental.  Presented in the first person, the story is a collection of journal entries written by a woman whose physician husband (John) has rented an old mansion for the summer. Foregoing other rooms in the house, the couple moves into the upstairs nursery. As a form of treatment she is forbidden from working, and is encouraged to eat well and get plenty of exercise and air, so she can recuperate from what he calls a ""temporary nervous depression – a slight hysterical tendency"", a diagnosis common to women in that period.   She hides her journal from her husband and his sister the housekeeper, fearful of being reproached for overworking herself. Because it's a nursery the room's windows are barred, to prevent children from climbing through them, and there is a gate across the top of the stairs, though she and her husband have access to the rest of the house and its adjoining estate.  The story depicts the effect of understimulation on the narrator's mental health and her descent into psychosis. With nothing to stimulate her, she becomes obsessed by the pattern and color of the wallpaper. ""It is the strangest yellow, that wall-paper! It makes me think of all the yellow things I ever saw – not beautiful ones like buttercups, but old foul, bad yellow things. But there is something else about that paper – the smell! ... The only thing I can think of that it is like is the color of the paper! A yellow smell.""

nursing,3azkre,Divisadero,21,Wed Jun 24 22:42:24 2015 UTC,"My old unit had exactly one room without a yellow sticker on it. So stupid because how do you explain to new staff --yeah this one is a fall risk (despite never having fallen before), but THIS one is really a fall risk,  and this one is going to be on the floor every single day.   Especially considering the rubric we use includes as a factor ""takes more than 5 prescription medications. "" bro do you even geriatrics? I have only once or twice had patients that took less than that."
nursing,3azkre,lavender_poppy,7,Thu Jun 25 01:37:49 2015 UTC,"Yep, sounds like our ratio! I'd love some nurse-determined true fall-risk indicator on the outside of the rooms. That way you'd know at a glance which patients to make a dive for if they're out of bed and you're not familiar with them."

As for what's cool in Boise, there is a TON of outdoorsy places and things to do. Places people often go to in the summer is McCall. There's table rock that you can hike up to, and also a brewery called table rock that's pretty good.   There is a cool cultural center for Basque and lots of great food. Go to the Idaho Pizza Company sometime, and then try Bardenay's and 10 barrel brewery.   If you like the bar/club scene... don't go to China Blue... but Tom Grainey's, Pengilly's, Neurolux (has lots of live bands too), and a bunch of other bars that I can't think of at the top of my head.   The foothills, people love hiking/running/exploring there.   If you like concerts, there's the Knitting Factory.

nursing,3b2xcg,vicnavyguy22,2,Thu Jun 25 15:15:28 2015 UTC,"What first attracted you to your job? It was my first job out of school, but I've always been more attracted to the acute care setting, I have no interest in seeing a patient more than 1 shift in a row. How long have you been in this position? 3 years now, though I was promoted to clinic manager recently, so it's a bit less patient care. What are the major responsibilities in this position? Triage and treatments mostly. What do you like most and least about your job? I LOVE that it's ""what's wrong with you RIGHT NOW and how do we fix it"".  I also appreciate that in this particular setting my skills and knowledge are leaned on by the PA's and NP's. What level of education is needed for an entry level position/ other positions? Well, I'm an LVN from a trade school, so no advanced degrees or anything, for my particular company. Do you belong to a union, professional organization, etc? Not as of yet. Do you see any major changes in this position over the next ten years? twenty years? Not likely in my state.  Not saying it's wrong or right, but the nursing union has a pretty strong foothold here and they're making sure there's not a lot of movement in LVN responsibilities.  Again, I have no qualms with that, just making an observation. What advice do you have for someone entering this career? It's easier than you think it is.  But it's also harder than you think it is. What's the most rewarding thing that's happened to you? The very rare time when someone is actually having an acute illness that is potentially life threatening that I get to help intervene with always makes you feel good when it works out. Would you recommend this career to others? Heck yes.  It's a very comfortable environment to work in."

Thus far no two days have been the same and that makes it both fun and challenging.  The thing I hate are the management who think that we are some dumping ground for the excess of the family medicine portion of our medical office building.   1 yr full time at a vocational school or 18-24 months at a JC or part time vocational school for the basic license and at least 6 months of acute care experience for urgent care."
nursing,3b2xcg,bcab,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:12:14 2015 UTC,"Title: Registered Nurse II. Workplace: Medical ICU at Level I Trauma Center  What first attracted you to your job? Its my first job out of nursing school in a tough market, so I was glad to get a job at all. But I've always wanted to be an ICU nurse because of the respect and autonomy.   How long have you been in this position? Over two years  What are the major responsibilities in this position? Close monitoring and treatment of patients with life threatening illnesses.  What do you like most and least about your job? Most: Patient care, the excitement. Least: Crabby day shift nurses  What level of education is needed for an entry level position/ other positions? At my hospital a BSN is required for all new hire RN positions.  Do you belong to a union, professional organization, etc? I belong to the California Nurses Association union and the American Association of Critical Care Nurses professional organization. The CNA ensures great working conditions for California nurses.  Do you see any major changes in this position over the next ten years? twenty years? I see more changes taking place at the advanced practice level. I think in 10 years we will see greater autonomy for Nurse Practitioners in most states. In 20 years I'd like to see NP education expanded and improved so that we see more nurse practitioners in the hospital.   What advice do you have for someone entering this career? My advice would be entirely dependent on which geographic area you are from. I trained in the midwest, where nurses aren't very respected, barely earn a living wage, and work with little institutional support. If you are from one of those states, my advice would be to move or to become an NP. But overall nursing is a great career path. You jump through the hoops of school and can get a stable career.  What's the most rewarding thing that's happened to you? The job itself became more rewarding as I became better at it. I enjoy my job and my coworkers.  Would you recommend this career to others? Absolutely."

nursing,3b200v,anxietyexists,3,Thu Jun 25 09:22:03 2015 UTC,"Watching the video, I'm not really outraged.  It appears as though their chosen method to get the patient back to the room was to pull him while having him push with his feet.  If a patient has fallen and isn't able to stand back up, a nurse shouldn't try to lift them up from the floor.  There's no quicker way to hurt your back and possibly end your career  It may not look great, but there's nothing harmful about what was done in the video.  Nor is there any evidence of a substantial amount of bleeding from the head.  The floor looks relatively clear of blood."
nursing,3b200v,schlingfo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:49:00 2015 UTC,"I'll agree that the title is quite sensational.  Even still, not really a good look to pull an outstretched arm like that.

nursing,3b200v,PutYouToSleep,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:49:21 2015 UTC,You could use a hoverjack to get them elevated up off the floor and then use a mechanical lift to complete the job.   If your facility is fancy enough to have a hoverjack.... my state has safe lifting laws so the hospitals here have to have them.
nursing,3b200v,tanukisuit,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:42:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it might not be worth a criminal charge but definitely some kind of discipline from the facility.

Could also be some political grandstanding of the AG there though."

You say they can't lift him, which I understand, but what are they doing with him once he's back in his room? Leaving him on the floor?  Is there no protocol for you guys dealing with falls? Where I've worked as a CNA, first thing is to have a nurse assess for injury. Especially with a head injury they have to do regular neuro checks. Then if they're not injured, we get them back up. I agree one person shouldn't lift him. But there are three people who together could lift him. Or they could use a hoyer, which yes do reach to the floor.  I would hate to work with any of you who think dragging someone  by the arm is an acceptable way to move him."

Most of the other nurses nap,  and they admit they come back feeling groggy and nauseous.  Lastly:  modafinil.  It's a ""vigilance drug""; I heard about it from long-distance drivers when I was in the oil and gas industry.  Decided to try it out for night shift and holy heck:  it makes the shift a breeze, and I still fall asleep really well by 9am.

nursing,3aykbr,murse101,2,Wed Jun 24 20:17:45 2015 UTC,Thank you! I've never heard of modafinil...I've never heard of it before. I worry about making it through an overnight shift since I've never worked one during clinicals and I'm more of a morning person than a night owl. I'll check it out!
nursing,3aykbr,djxpress,11,Fri Jun 26 10:05:19 2015 UTC,Try to do your 3 in a row. The first of 3 will be the hardest. Having one on and one off sucks so avoid doing that if at all possible
nursing,3aykbr,erb047,2,Thu Jun 25 01:52:04 2015 UTC,"Its brutal. My preceptor in the ER does Sun/Tues/Fri, and its horrendous. I can't wait to be off orientation."
nursing,3aykbr,PutYouToSleep,20,Wed Jun 24 16:25:54 2015 UTC,Don't get too caught up with trying to flip schedules back and forth.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with staying up all night on your nights off.  You'll feel way better if you just maintain an night schedule.
nursing,3aykbr,CaitlinPants,9,Thu Jun 25 02:42:57 2015 UTC,This is what I try to do. Plus you get the gym to yourself at 2am woo!
nursing,3aykbr,drusRN,4,Wed Jun 24 15:55:25 2015 UTC,"I really urge against this. For me, the nocturnal thing never worked. Sure it's  nice to have some alone time in the gym or the grocery store, but after a while it can feel isolating. I have found that any less than 48 hours off makes switching very tough on sleep cycles though. It's all about what works for you, and I need sun light and day time and people around me to feel normal."
nursing,3aykbr,Doublev957,2,Wed Jun 24 19:02:55 2015 UTC,Yeah when I worked nights I did the same. I would sleep like 12 hours on my night off. I did okay. I just hated it.
nursing,3aykbr,elac,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:13:49 2015 UTC,"I switch back and forth and do fine with it. Thats what most of the 10+ years nightshifters I've met do too. If you have a family, staying up all night just isn't realistic."
nursing,3aykbr,ihatetothrowitaway,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:30:11 2015 UTC,Same here. I flip flop back and forth. I'm pretty sure I'm chronically fatigued but it doesn't affect me terribly.
nursing,3aykbr,ImoImomw,0,Wed Jun 24 21:21:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed also if you have a family, significant other etc it really isn't an option.  I stay up for 36+ hours at the end of my days in a row so that I can spend all of my days off awake during daylight hours.  It can stick and I usually end up in bed around 9pm the first night, but I get quality time with my wife and daughter.  My father-in-law works nights as an ED Dr. And days as an administrator, not really sure how he does it, but he stays up for 48 his straight on a regular basis.  Most important thing imo is to know your limit and get the sleep you need.  For me 4.5 hours is the least I need to be at my best, but I need that 7.5 hours at least one every three days."

nursing,3aykbr,Wakenstein,2,Thu Jun 25 06:35:12 2015 UTC,I will definitely keep this in mind! I was definitely worried about how my sleep schedule will be impacted since I'm more of a morning person than a night owl.
nursing,3aykbr,Abzillarawr,9,Wed Jun 24 19:29:38 2015 UTC,"1) pick a day and meal prep for the week. My floors on blocks schedule (2on-3off-3on-2off) so my last night off I cook enough for a few days. 2) find a 24 hour gym, makes staying up all night in the middle of the week easier."
nursing,3aykbr,konvictkarl,6,Thu Jun 25 01:49:33 2015 UTC,"Drink WATER. As much as you may want to drink a lot of caffeine, don't. It makes it worse wen you crash. Maybe a cup of coffee at 0400 to get you over the hump, but otherwise just hydrate. You'll feel MUCH better. My dirty secret is that I take a 100mg caffeine pill and only drink water. Best of both worlds and it's the same (less I think) as a cup of coffee. I take it at about 0000 and it helps me keep my mojo until after I get home, then wears off and I go right to sleep. I also have no heart conditions or health problems that would be contraindicated, so if you do, then ignore that :)"
nursing,3aykbr,okjetsgo,7,Wed Jun 24 16:09:17 2015 UTC,"Acting like you know nothing is much better than acting like you know everything. Ask questions. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Don't feel intimidated, ever."
nursing,3aykbr,Itstheway1,5,Wed Jun 24 16:51:50 2015 UTC,"I'll echo some comments here: hydration, I aim for 1L before midnight and 1L after midnight. No coffee after 2am works for me. Light dinner around 1-2am and healthy snacks. I wake up and make a smoothie before work with lots of veges/some fruit. I've lost wt on night shift but my floor is almost never quiet. I avoid Benadryl and take melatonin 5mg sometimes if I'm wired when I get home. Dark and cold bedroom. I switch back to days after my last night, and always scheduled my night in a row.  I try my best to promote sleep in my patients at night. Not only coz it makes it easy for me but also it's better for them. Cluster care with your aide where you can. I turn out lights on the floor and try to keep the noise down. Easier said than done.  Day shift is busier than nights. I do what I can to make sure things are left in a good state for them. For example, if a patient is going for surgery in the morning, I'll make sure the patient is ready, check the chart and make sure everything is in order so the patient is good to go no matter how early the OR comes to get them."
nursing,3aykbr,Katiebug2288,7,Wed Jun 24 20:08:12 2015 UTC,"This is what I do, but everyone is different. Ear plugs are a must. The sound of a lawn mower is the worst sound after work. Blackout curtains! Keeps the room dark and for me it also keeps it cool. I eat my big meal before work and have something small during work/snack through out the night. Make sure you keep exercising."
nursing,3aykbr,yeyman,2,Thu Jun 25 02:32:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip! My mom has worked 12h nights for 10 years now and definitely told me to keep exercising to avoid ballooning up. I need the motivation again after slaving through school :)
nursing,3aykbr,NurseRattchet,4,Wed Jun 24 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"I've been on nights since March and I really like it! I've adjusted much easier than I thought I would. I work 2 on, 2 off, 3 on, 2 off, 2 on, 3 off. So 7 shifts in 2 weeks, opposite schedules each week. Here is what I do. But honestly, you'll have to find what works best for you. Everybody is different.  After my last shift I stay up until 10AM or so and sleep 4-5 hours. Then I'm okay to switch to a ""normal"" sleep schedule that night. The day of my first shift I try to be up by 0700 then take a 3-4 hour nap that afternoon. On my days in between shifts I try to get as much sleep as possible. I shower and eat something light when I get home around 0730 and then straight to bed. Sleep until 1630 or 1700. I do take Lunesta on my in between days. I've suffered from insomnia for years and it's a God send for me. I only take it on my in between shift days, so 2 or 3 times a week.  As far as diet, I've actually lost 12 pounds since switching to nights. I just don't get as hungry and don't eat as much. For me, the nights I work I am never hungry when I get up. I drink a protein shake on the way to work so I'm not starving later. I eat something light around midnight. Cheese, fruit, light carbs, that kind of thing. Then I'll usually eat a granola bar or some almonds with dried apricots around 0400. Then oatmeal or cereal when I get home. It's so easy to fall into the ""to go"" food pitfall. So many of my co-workers eat pizza or Chinese take out. Then they'll have chips and candy throughout the shift. It will make you feel like crap and gain weight. Just say no!  I have found that Military Energy Gum and sugar free Red Bull are great around 1 AM. I'm a coffee drinker but I just can't get my head around drinking coffee at 2 in the morning.  The Military Energy Gum is 100mg of caffeine and it kicks in faster than drinking something. No jitters whatsoever.   Hopefully you can find something that works for you. Everybody I know does their sleep schedule a little different. It'll all work out though! Best of luck on this new adventure!"
nursing,3aykbr,azbartender,2,Thu Jun 25 01:50:45 2015 UTC,blackout curtains. they are a lifesaver.
nursing,3aykbr,VGRonin,4,Wed Jun 24 17:36:55 2015 UTC,"CONGRATS! If you're having trouble sleeping try melatonin 3 mg and benadryl 25-50 mg.  What I usually do is 3 on and I schedule a couple weeks of 2 on 2 off 1 on because working 3 in a row all the time makes me crazy. We self schedule per 6 weeks so your mileage may vary.   Do NOT let them convince you to do any combo of every other day. That is far too taxing on your body and your sanity. When I was new I didn't know how to say no and I got burnt out real quick doing things like m/w/f nights or 3 on 1-2 off 3 on cycles. You need time to recover and live life with the daywalkers.  The night before my first on I'll stay up really late (2-3 am) and try to get up relatively early (6-7 am) and I'll take a little benadryl and maybe have a snack if I'm hungry, usually then I sleep like a champ til 3 or 4 and can get up and get ready for work. The next morning when I get home I take benadryl and melatonin if I have to work that night. When I get off on my 'day off' I won't take anything and try to sleep til noon or 1 and that usually leaves me tired enough that night to switch back effectively enough for my purposes.  Eat light, carry healthy snacks. Take time for yourself. Let people know if you're struggling or need help! Most night shift nurses are great and know what it's like and will help you."

nursing,3aykbr,wicksa,2,Wed Jun 24 20:30:26 2015 UTC,"I am actually going thru orientation at my very first job. Working nights in ED. Our schedule for nights is alittle different. Basically I work every Monday/Tuesday, I'm off every Wednesday/Thursday. And every other weekend I work Friday, Saturday and Sunday. So it's basically like 2 on, 2 off, 5 on, 5 off. I'm kind of a night owl(always have been) so I'm not sure... I may just keep the same sleep pattern even when I'm off work."
nursing,3aykbr,hello_emro,2,Wed Jun 24 17:58:32 2015 UTC,"YAAAAHHH!! Nights aren't for everybody;  but hey, if they are your thing, then great! I tried working 12h night shifts once...almost killed me. Couldn't get used to the routine.   Best of luck in your new career!"
nursing,3aykbr,haanalisk,2,Wed Jun 24 22:45:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely invest in black out curtains for your bedroom! And a fan or something to block out the noise of people mowing their lawn, or kids screaming outside (especially during summer).  If you don't have kids/day time responsibilities it works out best to stick to a modified night shift schedule all the time. On work days I would go to sleep around 8-9am and wake up between 2-4pm, shower and eat and leave my house by 5:45-6pm for work, rinse and repeat. On off days I will stay up until around 2-3 am and sleep until noon. Most of my friends/family work a normal 9-5 so I am up when they get out of work to do things. I make all my appointments for the afternoon if I can, or early morning right after work.   Stop drinking caffeine by 4am. Wear sunglasses on your way out of work, the sunlight can wake you up and make you not want to go right to sleep. Try not to eat a bunch of junk. It will make you sluggish at work and probably make you fat. Pack a healthy lunch and some healthy snacks like veggies, yogurt, oatmeal, etc.  If you are having trouble falling asleep in the beginning, try melatonin or benadryl.   Try to keep yourself busy at work. Some units will be hoppin' all night and you won't have to worry about it. There were times in med/surg when there was a nice lull between 2am-4am where most patients were asleep and no meds were due. I would stock things, clean up a little, do mandatory education on the computer, chat with coworkers, etc."

Some of the ratings on the review are floor or unit based and depend on pt surveys. So if the hospital gets a hand full of surveys back that said it was loud at night and we don't hit the goal % for noise, we lose a fraction of a percentage. I'd say half of the review works like that."

nursing,3b01eo,Tay261,4,Wed Jun 24 21:47:26 2015 UTC,"Technically, a patient cannot give informed consent unless they completely understand everything the physician tells them about the risks and benefits of the procedure.  In practice, there is never perfect understanding, and even your average fully-oriented adult probably doesn't understand all of those details. (If they did, they'd be a physician themselves.) So the appropriateness of obtaining consent depends a bit on the procedure and on what other options are available.   It would certainly be wrong if you had a severely demented patient consent to a major, high-risk, life-altering procedure, outside an emergency, if there were a DPOA or other decision maker readily available.   At the other extreme, if it's for something low-risk and straightforward such as admission to the hospital, and there is no family or DPOA, and the patient has the wherewithal to at least understand they are sick and need treatment, it's probably okay for them to consent.  Of course in a bona fide emergency, the signature is moot. Consent is implied unless there's a preexisting DNR or advanced directive. If the patient is delirious because they're septic and they need life-saving treatment, somebody may still ask them to sign the form, but that's really only for show."

Devil's advocate: Are they competent to sign out AMA as well?"

I’m a psychologist who researches how technology—particularly, the instantaneous availability of seemingly infinite information—affects what we know and how we behave.  The mods were gracious enough to let me post a survey here about how the widespread availability of resources like WebMD and /r/AskDocs affects patient knowledge and health-related behavior.  I’d love to get responses from both medical professionals (e.g., nurses, doctors, administrators) and patients (or potential patients).  I’ll be monitoring this thread as much as possible throughout the week, and am happy to answer any questions you may have.    The one thing I ask is that you refrain from discussing any specifics of the survey.  I’ll post a summary of the results this weekend, and would love to get a discussion going on then.  My hope is that your responses will be both useful for my research in this area and interesting to members of the /r/nursing community—again, I’m excited about the discussion that will hopefully get rolling once I post the results.  Finally, everyone who takes the survey will be entered into a drawing for reddit gold (10% will be randomly selected).  I think the results I’ll be posting will be rewarding in their own way, but I know I’m probably nerdier than most—and I’d like to offer a more tangible sign of my gratitude.  (I wish I could give gold to everyone, but I’m currently transitioning from a post-doc to a professorship and don’t have any research funding at the moment…so I’ll be paying out-of-pocket.)  Thanks in advance for your help!"

I'm honestly not too familiar with it, and Google isn't being particularly helpful.    My best guess (which may be totally inaccurate) is that Readability is having some issues with the survey logic I use at the beginning of the survey.  The first question asks people to report whether or not they work in the medical field.  Answers to this question determine which survey people see.  Medical professionals get a survey about their daily experience on the ""inside,"" and everyone else gets a survey about how they use / think about online health-related resources.  I'm excited about responses in both areas, but I'm particularly excited about the possibility of getting insight from people who work in medical or health-related fields on a daily basis.  They're not easy to access for research like this, and reddit is my last hope.  Okay, tangent over.  Back to your issues, the point is that I think the survey logic is creating issues for Readability.  I'll create a ""medical professional"" version of the survey without the first page and PM it to you in case you're interested--but there's no obligation, of course.  Thanks!"

My arm didn't rot off 😊...It was pretty much like the one before, a big mosquito bite basically. I was positive again of course and they said it was fine. Now they just make me answer questions each year about if I'm having symptoms. I guess the false positives just mean I'm sensitive to the Tb test? I don't really understand it."

I took my NCLEX yesterday as well and also had 75 questions. My last questions were a drag and drop followed by my only question with pictures as answer choices. I also had an exhibit question and a math question toward the end, and probably 20 or so SATA. I agree, it felt very difficult, but that's because it apparently tries to get to the point where we are missing 50% of the questions, then figure out whether that point is above or below passing.   Candidates cannot reliably identify which items are easy and which are difficult with regard to the NCLEX scale. At the end of an examination, a candidate is usually receiving items that they have approximately a 50% chance of answering correctly. Typically, candidates regard items that they can answer correctly only half the time as difficult. The candidate's sense of what is easy and what is difficult is relative to their ability. Because the examination is adaptive, both high and low ability candidates will think the items at the end of the exam are challenging.

I bought the ATI study guide, and it was useful but terribly boring. And I thought the real test was much easier than their practice tests.

I am, however, concerned about your comment about glorified CNA and aide jobs.  Have you shadowed a nurse?  Have you done much research about the nursing field?  You can bet your rear end that you'll be doing CNA-type jobs as an RN.  CNA's have a higher patient load than RN's, so if your CNA is busy with another patient, guess who will be cleaning up your patient with C. Diff diarrhea.  You will be.  Nursing is not what is portrayed on shows like Grey's Anatomy and whatever else is on TV.  You'll be passing meds, dealing with family members, cleaning patients, doing hourly rounding, assessments and vital signs.  Pretty much the only CNA-type job I've seen floor nurses not do is bathing patients."

My best guess is that your starting salary would most likely be around the $23/hr range, which would be in line with other Midwestern cities of similar size.  Employers generally start all new grads out at one base salary. They might bump you slightly for having a BSN, or a certification in your area of specialty (like CEN or CCRN), but that's about all.

nursing,3awls8,Yallah_Habibi,17,Wed Jun 24 02:17:53 2015 UTC,"Tachycardia isn't a direct result of the fluid overload. It's a step or two further down the chain of consequences.  SIADH causes fluid overload, which causes pulmonary congestion. That impairs oxygenation in the lungs. And when the blood is poorly oxygenated, the heart has to pump faster in order to supply sufficient oxygen to the body tissues.  So tachycardia doesn't show up at the initial onset of SIADH. It starts to happen once the overload is well established and the lungs are no longer able to fully compensate."

nursing,3awls8,Charlestonian,2,Wed Jun 24 18:16:08 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go against what everyone else is saying, and tell you the explanation is wrong. ADH, which we give in the ICU as Vasopressin, doesn't cause any change in heart rate, other than lower it from fluid retention in cases of hypovolemia.   The extra fluid from the SIADH would back up in the periphery, not (necessarily) the lungs. But if if the fuid overload is high enough, the left side of the heart will begin to fail. I can't find any study that shows it causes tachycardia. Where did you find this question?  EDIT: The only thing I can think of is if possibly the carcinoma is related to Grave's disease, which is hyperthyroidism. That would cause the tachycardia, not anything related to the water retention. That seems like a pretty obscure fact for an NCLEX question, but I could be wrong."

nursing,3awls8,LetMyEggoGo,0,Thu Jun 25 00:59:55 2015 UTC,"My reasoning: I thought that since there is fluid overload, which would result in hypertension, the heart rate would slow down in order to compensate.   Tachycardia seems counter-productive by the body... Am I missing something?"
nursing,3awls8,auraseer,3,Wed Jun 24 02:19:12 2015 UTC,"The only way to detect hypertension is by tracking BP.  That is why it is the silent killer.  If it caused bradycardia then the person would ""feel"" different and have obvious signs like hyperventilation."
nursing,3awls8,ajh1717,2,Wed Jun 24 04:57:19 2015 UTC,"More ADH means fluid overload, but there are other mechanisms at play. As blood volume rises, the right side of the heart gets stretched out, which is detects and responds to by secreting atrial and b type naturetic proteins. These act to decrease aldosterone secretion and increase naturesis and fluid loss.  The net result is a hyponatremic euvolemia. Due to the decrease sodium, the excess water will flow to the interstitium causing some edema. There will not be any tachycardia. This is process is called 'aldosterone escape.'"
nursing,3avegt,Melissa__Anne,6,Tue Jun 23 20:31:38 2015 UTC,"Happy to answer this one. Just a bit of background, I worked as an EKG tech and then ortho & rehab,med/surg & geri-psych as an RN. I was getting really frustrated by not being able to provide true nursing care. I mean, 1 on 1, complete head to toe care. So I transitioned to hospice this year and absolutely love it. I am a case manager and generally have a patient load of 13-15 patients. I plan my own day, and have a lot of autonomy with bedside care and nursing practice. Not all hospice agencies are the same so just beware. A good thing to do is shadow a nurse one day to see if it is for you. The pace is much different. Also, sometimes when things hit the fan, you are by yourself in the field. So you need to be confident in your skills and be able to handle emergency situations without calling for backup, rapid response, or 911. Any questions, feel free to PM me."
nursing,3avegt,Gman-RN,2,Tue Jun 23 22:55:27 2015 UTC,What kind of emergency situations just out of curiosity? Can't think of having to call rapid response or 911 for many hospice patients so I wonder what you mean by this.
nursing,3avegt,MsConstrued,4,Wed Jun 24 08:45:41 2015 UTC,"Hospice patients are not required to be dnr patients, though that is something we will encourage after admission, and spend time educating about as we continue to manage symptoms and provide care. (Though full code hospice patients really defeat the purpose, considering the focus, you know?)  I've had a few instances where I've needed to initiate emergency response to a patient location because a new admit is still a full code and crashing in their home and they or their responsible party is refusing dnr.   Then you have the staff safety issues, family members who are unstable with firearms (get out, call the cops, etc), falls with injuries (complex lacs requiring emergent care would be considered comfort and covered ... you aren't curing their cancer by stitching up their forehead), etc."
nursing,3avegt,desertilluminati,2,Wed Jun 24 12:53:36 2015 UTC,Thank you for answering my question! I have shied away from home health for similar reasons. My own safety more than a patients. I feel confident I could handle any sort of emergency for them but I am concerned  about family members and being alone.
nursing,3avegt,MsConstrued,3,Wed Jun 24 17:06:31 2015 UTC,"Those are valid concerns, I hope I can reassure you that the risk is small though.   I've come across one firearm issue in my years in the field.   Family interactions are funny things. Over time I've become more relaxed (perhaps to the detriment of my own safety... I like to think not but I'm on the inside looking out, right?) and I've found that by and large, even messed up folks with lots of issues are generally okay.   Safety is a big deal where I work, and if there is a perceived staff risk, we will buddy up or security staff will accompany. That's for things like high crime areas.  For staff safety in the home, if our staff isn't safe, our social worker will help determine if the risk extends to the patient as well, and either recommend discharge due to inability to provide safe care and non compliance with plan of care (i.e. patient's son will keep firearms unloaded and secured in locked storage out of reach of dementia patient with e.s. liver ca), and if the patient is at risk, get aps involved.  We've always been encouraged to look after ourselves first, but I know it isn't that way at every company. I've heard horror stories from other nurses who have felt pressured to do things that put their lives at risk."
nursing,3avegt,desertilluminati,2,Wed Jun 24 17:48:24 2015 UTC,"Every hospice will be structured differently, but I'll take you through what a typical day for me looked like as a case manager, and talk about some of the other positions I've had as well.  I will start my day by reviewing the call report from overnight to see if any of the patients on my case load had issues. If they did, they will go to the top of my list for follow up that morning. after that I'll look at my scheduled visits for the day and plan my route. I'm usually in the car by 0800 on the way to the first house or facility.   Each visit length will vary depending on patient needs and level of stability. If routine, I will be in and out in less than an hour, after charting at the bedside, checking to see if they need any refills, doing an assessment, and spending some time socializing.   On my way to the next patient I'm giving my Bluetooth a workout, calling updates to family members, collaborating with my care team (stna, social worker, chaplain, volunteer, etc), calling doctors, or returning phone calls.   I may be at my next visit for several hours, if there are complex issues, wound care, active dying, etc.  Rinse and repeat.  I would expect to be in the field for between 6 to 8 hours a day, and would schedule my visits around my personal appointments. I was lucky to have support personnel that would make prn visits and do admissions during the day so my schedule remained semi structured. Of course this wasn't always the case... when our hospice was small we did everything, and had to reroute frequently, which was frustrating.   I also worked as an on call nurse, and basically sat at home waiting for my phone to ring, then went out after hours to fix problems, do admissions, initiate continuous care,etc.  Both positions were salaried, mileage was a consideration, benefits,etc.  Some weeks were 60 hour weeks, some were 30 hour weeks, but it tends to average out.  I found that personal organization makes all the difference. The stress level is different but like the previous poster mentioned, if you work well independently it's a good gig."

The vast majority of Army combat medics who have actual combat experience are trained to an EMT-B level with a few differences.   The new flight medic program in the Army is training to an EMT-P level. And that is specifically for flight medics, not for the MOS in general. The wars were basically over by the time anyone from the new flight medic program might have deployed so the amount of experience they have caring for actual patients is probably pretty minimal.

This was similar to my situation and being former military can be a real double edged sword. I dealt with a lot of people who were not familiar with the kind of experience someone in my position might have or they were too familiar with how the military works and know you have a lot of leeway with how you present your experience.

The Army upgraded to critical care training for flight medics in what, 2012? How many medics that have gone through the new training program have actually deployed to combat zones since then? Also, casualties have been relatively light in that time period. The worst year in Afghanistan was 2010. Iraq basically ended in 2011, and 2007 was the worst year.  I don't think the amount of actual patient care hours that an Army flight medic gets regardless of training is anywhere close to what civilian paramedics have, let alone nurses. The patient population is also generally young, extremely mostly fit males. Civilian flight crews also handle things pediatrics and high risk OB. Most programs also have a large portion of interfacility transport calls.  Frankly I think a civilian paramedic with the typical ""three/five years of experience in a high volume 911 service"" is a stronger candidate than an Army medic."

nursing,3audx1,HippocraticOffspring,2,Tue Jun 23 22:16:59 2015 UTC,"Medic school only added an extra year for me, and in reality it probably only added a semester because I needed time to finish up some pre-reqs.  As a result of that I made about twice what anyone else in my class made per hour, and could work nearly twice as many hours as they could because of the nature of EMS.  So it easily paid for itself.    Additionally it made nursing school easier, because I had a stronger background so I knew a lot of (or had clinical experience with) the basics, and could focus more on the exceptions and details that everyone else struggled with.  Plus skills and lab tests were WAY easier as a result.  Finally, I had job offers before I graduated in some of the specialities and hospitals of my choice, while other people struggled getting a job, and all my offers mentioned my paramedic experience as being the thing that either got me the interview and/or the offer.  Essentially they got a new grad with some more advanced experience, so they were able to cut out some of orientation (a lot of the skills rotations as well as CPR, ACLS and other courses/certs I already had) but still pay me new grad wages.    I'd have to run the numbers, but even with the extra tuition and opportunity cost I think I came out ahead adding that extra year for paramedic school.  Plus it's something I like (and continue to do) and it's provided plenty of benefits to me personally and professionally."
nursing,3audx1,justatouchcrazy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:27:08 2015 UTC,I'm in CA. All my schools are impacted. Community colleges are on lotteries. We are graded based on grades and a standardized test. I got great grades but my standardized test scores are bad. Plus it takes another 5 years to retest again. So hopefully I can build a better foundation instead of jumping right in.
nursing,3audx1,Hiphopopotamus18,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:54:59 2015 UTC,"ah, that really sucks. I knew california was bad but not that bad. have you thought about moving out of state?"
nursing,3audx1,HippocraticOffspring,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:56:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have. But then again, there's out of state resident fees and plus cost of finding a place during school :/"

nursing,3audx1,HippocraticOffspring,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"In the long run you could always move out of state for a year and get residency. I lived in Va for several years, moved out of state for college and decided I wanted a different path after a year. I came back to VA but lost residency so for a year I took 1-2 pre req classes kind knew I would need at a community college for cheap then after a year I established residency and went to the university for in state rates. In the end it might be faster or cheaper than waiting 5 years to retest."
nursing,3audx1,Ronadon,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:39:20 2015 UTC,Yeah that's true. I got all my prereqs done. And I get 2 more years until I can retest...only for one school to accept them. But in the mean time I'm a street Emtb and applying to medic schools next month ...which takes 13 months and then hopefully by then I can have more things and still make income than wait and take other bs classes at a community college out of state

nursing,3audx1,Hiphopopotamus18,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:42:14 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, ""regular routine calls"" will always be there no matter your experience, but your definition of ""regular"" and ""routine"" will change. My program transports so many head bleeds it makes me ill. So many so that now when I transport a head bleed intubating and giving Keppra/Fospheny and 3% or 23%, PCC and Vit K is mundane.   What makes flight work worth it- Bad traumas? NO!! The best part of flight work is the crazy diagnosis we transport ON OCCASION Malignant Hyperthermia, Cat Scratch Fever, Ruptured ventricle (ok this one was traumatic)- those are the few and far between calls that make Flight work AWESOME. But then again my definition of routine has changed."
nursing,3audx1,Northernightingale,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:38:18 2015 UTC,Is ICU at all like street medicine?  Is it at all ok to want the end goal of flight nurse but the er/icu seems like just a hurdle to get past?
nursing,3audx1,fromthedesert,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:04:41 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, (and feel free to correct me anyone) ICU is about as far away from ""street medicine"" as it comes. It is detail oriented and meticulous and takes an organized nurse. You take a very sick patient and over the course of 12 hours, its up to you to try to improve every body system. Whether its weaning them off the vent, decreasing the number of pressers they are on, etc. Also, this is all while attending to basic needs such as cleaning, oral care, changing lines, turning etc. ICU can get intense because when it breaks bad, its bad. But overall, ICU is not flying by the seat of your pants and hoping it goes well.   As to your questions of flight nursing, ICU experience is a huge and then some work in a level 1 trauma ED is big too. A lot of flight nursing is also inter-hospital transport of very sick people. You should also know, flights are often kids so get comfortable with pedes as well."
nursing,3audx1,Bookholder,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:50:43 2015 UTC,"Based on your posts you don't really have an interest in nursing. Is there a reason you want to be a flight nurse rather than a flight paramedic? Other than the pay difference, and that anecdotally it's harder to get a flight job as a paramedic.   You say you have a science degree so academically speaking I'm sure you're prepared, but nursing school is going to be painful if you're just doing it to eventually get to a flight job."
nursing,3audx1,fromthedesert,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:16:11 2015 UTC,I second this whole heartily.
nursing,3audx1,RockYourOwnium,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:47:12 2015 UTC,"Once you finish the two week bridge program (never heard of this...I'd love to read more), you're no longer an EMT-B (It's actually just EMT), you're just a paramedic. EMT-P also isn't a title anymore.   Also, you don't list both Bachelor's Degrees in a post nominal title.  Edit: The best way to get a flight position is to be a nurse in an ICU and acquire different critical care certifications (CFRN, CCRN, CTRN, CEN... et cetera) along with reputable experience. Just having a paramedic certification doesn't mean much if you have limited street experience. It's all about scene control and overall situational awareness that comes with street experience as a paramedic.   Acronyms aren't that big of a deal as they look on email signatures."
nursing,3audx1,HippocraticOffspring,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:36:31 2015 UTC,"EMT-P also isn't a title anymore.   I believe it's NRP now, correct?"

nursing,3audx1,justatouchcrazy,2,Tue Jun 23 23:58:58 2015 UTC,That's the fun thing about the military.  We only talk in acronyms/abbreviations and everyone is constantly moving and working all over the world and bring new abbreviations with them.
nursing,3audx1,lxpatterson,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:09:05 2015 UTC,You mean there's no master list of military approved abbreviations?  I'm kind of surprised since I assume the military likes everything standardized and uniform.
nursing,3audx1,justatouchcrazy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:17:30 2015 UTC,"I doubt there is a master list, but you can happily dig through the (literal) piles of instructions, policies, memos and admin notes to try and find it.  Otherwise as long as you define it at the start of said paperwork you can basically invent any abbreviation you want.  Ya Know, Shit Is Confusing (YKSIC), so it happens."
nursing,3audx1,RockYourOwnium,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:29:53 2015 UTC,"EMT-P is only a license in states that consider it a licensure with their department of occupational and professional licensing. The national registry is an organization that provides testing standardization and scope of practice for prehospital EMS providers. It doesn't authorize anything legally. I initially tested with the national registry and earned my NREMT-P certification, and my state recognized it resulting in a state certification (EMT-P). The national registry certification makes state-to-state reciprocity simpler as the individual state EMS agencies further recognize the NREMT as the authoritative figure.   The national registry changed several things a few years ago, and NREMT-P is now NRP.   Edit: Our state's EMS certification is under the direction of the state's health department. The DOPL doesn't have any authority over my EMS career."
nursing,3audx1,justatouchcrazy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:35:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't want to get into the details of licensure vs. certification for paramedics.  The lack of any standardization is an issue within EMS, that's for sure."

nursing,3audx1,justatouchcrazy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:03:16 2015 UTC,"It's all about scene control and overall situational awareness that comes with street experience as a paramedic.   This is what so many nurses don't seem to grasp.  Yes, paramedic adds some extra skills (more airway and trauma skills for instance that most, but not all, nurses don't have), but the real value of experience and the difference between typical nursing and EMS is scene management and field logistics."
nursing,3audx1,ENRN,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:49:27 2015 UTC,He is talking about Creighton - however the reality is with flight a cert without experience is rarely looked upon favorably.

nursing,3awcub,golson3,5,Wed Jun 24 01:01:27 2015 UTC,"It's not normal, I'm sure, but the hospital I recently left was the same way. I was there for six months before I learned that, and I was astonished because I'd never heard of such a thing before.  In ED, the ICUs, and outpatient surgery, nurses start IVs and every CNA can draw blood. But on med/surg and telemetry, they do neither. They have to call a lab phlebotomist every time they need blood, and if they need a new IV they call the IV team.  What's really crazy is that the IV team is only staffed during regular workday hours. If they need new access after 5pm, or on a weekend, they're supposed to either get the resident or call a rapid response.  This seems baroque and unnecessarily complicated to me, and I've heard floor nurses complain about it, but apparently it has never caused enough of a safety issue to force a change."
nursing,3awcub,auraseer,4,Wed Jun 24 03:32:14 2015 UTC,A rapid response for a pulled IV? that's absurd and a complete abuse of the system.
nursing,3awcub,perrla,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:10:14 2015 UTC,"Rapid response only if the patient needs a stat IV medication or if lack of access places them at high risk. Otherwise, they page the hospitalist service and wait for a resident to come around.  I've never worked on the floor here, so I don't know how often RR actually gets paged for that kind of thing, if ever. I completely agree with you that it would be absurd."
nursing,3awcub,auraseer,2,Wed Jun 24 19:31:07 2015 UTC,"If I paged my nighttime hospitalist (there's 1 NP 1 doc) every time I needed a new IV placed at night there would be heads rolling around. Namely mine.   I really wish we did have an IV team though, but for extended hours, like 2 eight hour shifts. Their entire job: replace old IV's, change PICC dressings, and put in new ones. It's a pipe dream though."
nursing,3awcub,Damey,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:09:46 2015 UTC,There is a hospital near where I live that calls the RR team when a pt needs a cardizem drip started. Crazy talk.

nursing,3awcub,phidelt649,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:06:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I did find out that nurses in critical care floors start their own, but not on my step down unit or anything that isn't critical care."

nursing,3awcub,HippocraticOffspring,3,Wed Jun 24 02:07:58 2015 UTC,"Some hospitals utilize IV teams on their acute care and step-down floors with the theory that those nurses won't get enough IV practice to be competent at it. My hospital was that way but is moving toward having all nurses being trained to do IVs (while keeping the IV team around for those particularly hard sticks), which I think makes more sense."
nursing,3awcub,im_daer,2,Wed Jun 24 03:03:30 2015 UTC,Who does start the IVs?
nursing,3awcub,im_daer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:03:11 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what their background/training is, but there is a team that shows up and does it when requested.

nursing,3awcub,StefaniePags,4,Wed Jun 24 02:08:54 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it is not so much ""not allowed to"" as it is strongly discouraged. When you have a stick team, you make the patients much happier than having staff who only get to start one IV a month."
nursing,3awcub,lethal_weapon_five,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:41:28 2015 UTC,Maybe you're right.  Could be that the nurse educator just simplified it when explaining the policy to me.

nursing,3awcub,auraseer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:42:03 2015 UTC,Job security. One hospital I work for is like this. The lab techs have a monopoly on blood draws.  It's hilarious watching them try and get into a code and get blood. We just draw it then

nursing,3awcub,adreamtomeat,2,Wed Jun 24 19:39:29 2015 UTC,Wow this is surprising to me. In my hospital nurses even draw blood because they feel that using a phlebotomy tech is redundant since the Nurse should be able to get blood. The only time we call someone else is when they need a picc or other central line. IVs are a daily thing for us.
nursing,3avimx,silicondt,5,Tue Jun 23 21:00:25 2015 UTC,It means you'll earn 12 shifts of pto a year. 4 weeks of three shifts a week.
nursing,3avimx,jareths_tight_pants,5,Tue Jun 23 21:33:14 2015 UTC,"A ""week of PTO"" means enough hours of PTO that you can stay out of work for one full week of your schedule.  If your normal full-time shift is 36 hours/week, then a ""week of PTO"" is 36 PTO hours."

nursing,3avimx,Shellback1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:03:13 2015 UTC,"I don't work at Texas Children's, but typically how it works is you earn a fraction of an hour of PTO for every hour you work, and that fraction gets larger the longer you're with the company. I'd guess their advertisement is based on a 40 hour work week, but the ratio of hours worked to hours of PTO would be the same.  That said, the PTO accrual for nurses may be different than the rest of the hospital's employees if nurses there are union. Call HR. They should be able to answer any questions you have. Congrats on a new job (I'm guessing)!"
nursing,3avimx,HelloKidney,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:17:04 2015 UTC,"Usually you accrue PTO based on hours as a percent.  For instance, if you work 40 hours a pay and your rate is 0.08 then based on 2000 hours a year, you will accrue 160 hours in that year.  That is fairly generous, and generally it goes up with seniority."

Sometimes jokes just don't land the way you mean them to.   Others have suggested snacks...well, people bring us food all the time.

Repeatedly pulling lines can lead to (obviously) blood loss infinitely so if they're in thinners, infections, more pain, more internal trauma to blood vessels. restraints are a necessary part of nursing for some confused patients and especially so in an ICU with intubated patients. They're not always needed, but if the choice is sticking someone 6 times at once or putting two peripherals in and restraining them, I would personally restrain them any day of the week when compared to the alternative"

nursing,3ay2y1,PutYouToSleep,3,Wed Jun 24 14:31:54 2015 UTC,"yeah....no.  it's about keeping them safe.   the meds and equipment used in icu makes it very important to keep them safe.  if they aren't coherent to do it themselves, we need to help. Next you'll be telling us we don't need to restrain intubated patients."
nursing,3ay2y1,auraseer,-7,Wed Jun 24 15:10:45 2015 UTC,I don't bring up intubated patients because I do not work with them. Isn't that sort of straw man?
nursing,3ay2y1,mootmahsn,2,Wed Jun 24 15:50:36 2015 UTC,"If they accidentally pull a line out, for instance by leaning over and having the line caught on the bedrail, that's no big deal. Anybody can do that if they're not paying attention.  If they do it intentionally but without purpose, because they are confused and don't understand what the lines are, that's a serious safety issue and you need to take steps. That may mean protecting your lines better (e.g., mummify with gauze and Coban) or applying restraints.  Note that restraint doesn't necessarily mean arm ties or ""strapping somebody down to the bed."" It might mean placing mittens so they cannot get a grip on the IV line. Sometimes you can even place just one untied mitten, which technically doesn't even count as a restraint, because an oriented patient would be able to free himself without assistance."
nursing,3ay2y1,auraseer,-3,Wed Jun 24 19:41:42 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of mittens. One is still a restraint at my facility and state.  I prefer then for stroke patients. But they seem to be no match for a determined, confused patient with good motor skills."
nursing,3ay2y1,mootmahsn,14,Wed Jun 24 19:45:21 2015 UTC,"Here's a tactic I've used that has SOMETIMES worked well. 1 real/regular IV. 1 decoy. The decoy is just the IV cath and tubing taped to their arm/skin. They mess with that one. The real is in a less noticeable place (not on the hand, maybe AC or forearm, covered w/net or something.) They mess with that decoy all day and forget about the real one. Doesn't always work but it's a hell of a lot safer than 6 damn IV's."
nursing,3ay2y1,Crapricornia,8,Wed Jun 24 15:08:04 2015 UTC,Give them a stack of washclothes and say you're behind on laundry.  A lot of them will sit there and fold for hours.
nursing,3ay2y1,Bob_GenghisKhan,5,Wed Jun 24 16:10:17 2015 UTC,"Genius! I never thought of a decoy IV, but I can remember some patients it would have been perfect for."

nursing,3ay2y1,PutYouToSleep,3,Thu Jun 25 02:47:46 2015 UTC,"I'd put tape around the threads and over the top of the Luer lock, so it couldn't be connected to."
nursing,3ay2y1,ajh1717,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:54:07 2015 UTC,"Good call. I love this idea, I just wanted to point out that it needs to be well-communicated to prevent errors. Maybe a sign above the HOB."
nursing,3ay2y1,conundrum2,2,Thu Jun 25 02:56:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's smart ha. Since the RN's are the only ones using the IV's at my place we just pass it in report but if there was code that could be trouble."
nursing,3ay2y1,ajh1717,-3,Thu Jun 25 14:07:23 2015 UTC,Worth trying
nursing,3ay2y1,ajh1717,13,Wed Jun 24 15:44:50 2015 UTC,do not start 6 IVs.   lordhavemercy
nursing,3ay2y1,Bob_GenghisKhan,6,Wed Jun 24 14:31:31 2015 UTC,"That is horrible. If the confusion is psychiatric, you need one line if any at all. If the source of the confusions is unknown, one is fine, two ideal. Anything more is abuse unless medically necessary."
nursing,3ay2y1,conundrum2,-12,Wed Jun 24 12:49:22 2015 UTC,Hey if they aren't going to pull out your lines then you only get as many as you need anyway. Either way they tend to get stuck multiple times regardless. I'm talking more about delirious patients and folks with dementia dumped by their family.
nursing,3ay2y1,Sir_Ribosome,4,Wed Jun 24 12:53:27 2015 UTC,So it's ok to do extra unnecessary painful procedures since their family doesn't care and they don't know what's going on?  I am see some major ethical issues in this thread and some of the things you're saying.
nursing,3ay2y1,conundrum2,6,Wed Jun 24 16:06:14 2015 UTC,The fuck? 6?  Even my post-op open hearts who have like 4-6 drips dont even have 6.
nursing,3ay2y1,auraseer,3,Wed Jun 24 13:47:37 2015 UTC,well you don't usually need peripherals when you have a nice juicy cvc.
nursing,3ay2y1,ajh1717,3,Wed Jun 24 15:13:18 2015 UTC,"Dat triple lumen goodness  But even still, even if you count each lumen as its on IV, we typically only have one other IV (usually a 16 gauge for volume infusion). So that still only gives me 4 IVs on someone who is pretty unstable. 6 peripherals is obnoxious, not to mention if they blow or get pulled out you are quickly going to start running out of spots."
nursing,3ay2y1,outrunningzombies,-8,Wed Jun 24 15:26:21 2015 UTC,"Say someone has a little bit of lactic acid going, needs a bolus, vanco, and some other antimicrobial to be infused in a large volume all at once. It might justify three lines. They get pulled. Now I'm at six."
nursing,3ay2y1,aeshleyrose,7,Wed Jun 24 15:52:59 2015 UTC,"You don't need one IV per med, that is why micromedex has an IV compatibility system. See what is compatible, and go from there.   Hell, even if they aren't compatible, you need to learn to prioritize each one. Out of the example you listed, the bolus and lactic are the most important. Yeah, the antibiotic is important, but that can wait until the bolus and lactic are done. Those two will have the biggest impact in the short term, while the antibiotic can wait; especially if you are giving a fluid bolus. If it is truly a bolus, it should be done in like 15-30 minutes. The antibiotic can wait. If it is just fluids going at like 50 to 100 ml/hr, just stop it, give the antibiotic, and restart it after.    If they are attempting to pull shit out, use restraints, hell you don't even need the wrist restraints that tie them to the bed, just get those mitten/glove thingys. They are there for a reason.   There is literally no reason to have 6 peripheral IVs."
nursing,3ay2y1,conundrum2,2,Wed Jun 24 16:23:40 2015 UTC,yes.  micromedex is your friend
nursing,3ay2y1,PutYouToSleep,2,Wed Jun 24 16:34:17 2015 UTC,"Unless you're running zosyn or some other specific antibiotics, why can't you run them all in one?  having a dedicated line for every single med is preposterous."
nursing,3ay2y1,t3hnhoj,-4,Wed Jun 24 16:10:01 2015 UTC,"Vanco doesn't play well with others and some antibiotics like zithromax or cipro are higher volume as well and it's all too much for for some peripheral iv. Another scenario. Drunk dude that came in after one hell of a bender needing ocreatide drip, protonix drip, and antibiotics or ppn."
nursing,3ay2y1,erniefu,6,Wed Jun 24 16:26:38 2015 UTC,"Well, that's a pretty different scenario than what you originally posted.  Either way, 6 PIVs is retarded no matter how you shape the context."
nursing,3ay2y1,auraseer,6,Wed Jun 24 16:33:32 2015 UTC,"As far as my resources can tell me, vancomycin is compatible with many medications.  You can bolus, hang secondary meds, and y site all compatible meds through one IV.    It would not be too much for a peripheral IV.... The smallest BD catheter 24g (used this because of how common they are) has a max flow rate of 1200mL/hr.  The 20 gauge catheters can handle nearly 3500mL/hr.  So unless you're running in 4 liters all at once, it's fine.   A patient with that presentation needs central access. Why are you dicking around with peripherals?    This isn't making sense.."
nursing,3ay2y1,Pikkusika,3,Wed Jun 24 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"If he needs octreotide and PPN, he's an actively bleeding ICU patient. You stick in two 18g PIVs and run what you can, until the doc puts in the subclavian triple."
nursing,3ay2y1,auraseer,2,Wed Jun 24 19:58:46 2015 UTC,"Again, prioritize.   Sometimes you need to pause a drip (unless it is something actively keeping them alive ). The protonix drip can be paused for 30 minutes to an hour. It isn't going to make the patient any worse."
nursing,3ay2y1,auraseer,2,Wed Jun 24 20:40:42 2015 UTC,"Unstable GI bleeds get 3, at least one 18 g or larger for blood, 1 for octerotide, 1 for Protonix and everything else (or is it Octerotide that is incompatible with everything? Same difference). Can't think of anyone else who gets 3 IVs. You can do a lot with 2 lines.  Example: sick sepsis gets 2 lines as I grab cultures. Bolus the first liter in 20 min, then run the rest of the NS wide open with the Zosyn and Vanc in separate lines, above the bolus--with good 20s you'll still get 3L in within an hour, usually far less.  Don't be a shitty nurse. A good ER RN (and you have an ER way of looking at things) knows how to work smarter, not harder. Starting 6 IVs=harder. Restraints and appropriate sedation=smarter."
nursing,3ay2y1,nomercy413,3,Thu Jun 25 01:39:07 2015 UTC,I have so many questions. 1. Your SO is a nurse?  2. Are you a nurse?  3. What kinds of floors are you working on?  4. You said you have trouble starting after 4. Do you routinely start 4 IV's?? 5. What is the cause of the confusion?  6. More to come.

nursing,3avazs,TheDouglas,3,Wed Jun 24 00:27:33 2015 UTC,Do all of the Qbank and review all your rationales! I did this with an average of 58% and passed with 75 questions. It's important to focus on the strategies just as much as the content. It's not bullshit at all.
nursing,3avazs,merpalina,3,Tue Jun 23 23:09:52 2015 UTC,Had the same average and also passed in 75 questions...I agree it's not all bullcrap
nursing,3avazs,12345hey,2,Tue Jun 23 23:17:50 2015 UTC,I passed nclex first time (85 questions) and I got 60% average on qbank (I did about 900 questions). I thought the test was put in simpler terms than Kaplan questions so I think Kaplan got you ready well. I also did the readiness test during the Kaplan in-class course and got 62%. I think their stats are accurate.
nursing,3avazs,lurknomoretoday,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:23:23 2015 UTC,Yeah I got a 60% on the readiness test I did for the review class. Overall I feel pretty confident
nursing,3avazs,Dozed,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:30:25 2015 UTC,As for actual statistics. Idk but the company claims 60-65% and you are gold. I'm sure they wouldn't make this claim since they have a refund policy if you fail.

nursing,3asivx,LordeBaldemort,3,Tue Jun 23 03:58:34 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't stick because the skin was sloughing, or because you slathered paraffin all over it?"
nursing,3asivx,auraseer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:31:00 2015 UTC,"Most burns patients are perpetually coated in a film of paraffin/ Flamazine to keep the wounds moist. With all the manual repositioning, the shit gets everywhere and is near impossible to scrub off without running hot water and a wire brush."
nursing,3asivx,auraseer,5,Tue Jun 23 04:50:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize silver sulfadiazine (aka Flamazine, Silvadene) was still being used in burn units. There's no good research showing it to have any benefit, and some studies show it instead worsens healing time, But anyway.  If the problem is a film of plain paraffin or some other chemically similar (waxy) substance, you will have to clean it off the skin in any case. Paraffin is an electrical insulator. You'll have a hell of a time getting any useful EKG out of it.  Flamazine and other aqueous emulsions just make things slippery, so you don't need to scrub the skin if you can make the electrodes stay in place. You might try a wrap of Coban around the torso. It's damn inconvenient to get it in place, but once you do, you can put the electrode pads underneath. The Coban has enough texture and friction to hold them mostly still.  I just reread your OP and noted the bit about ""all the thrashing."" That's not going to let you get a good EKG even on dry skin. You'll need to give some appropriate pain meds."
nursing,3asivx,aeshleyrose,2,Tue Jun 23 05:28:29 2015 UTC,Paraffin is an electrical insulator   How in the hell did you know that? Your knowledge base is like the goddamned ocean
nursing,3asivx,auraseer,6,Wed Jun 24 00:16:08 2015 UTC,"How in the hell did you know that?    I knew paraffin is nonconductive because it's sometimes used as the cooling fluid for electrical transformers. (Those are the big metal cans you see up on the sides of electrical poles.) I remember I looked that up because I saw one of the things explode and catch fire, and I wanted to know why there was firey liquid spewing all over the place.  More generally, I guess the main reason I pick up a lot of facts is because I'm interested. I hate the feeling of not understanding, and I like the feeling of learning new things, and those impulses are great motivators for looking stuff up and learning about it.  My eventual goal in life is to learn everything about everything, though I doubt I will live long enough to accomplish it. :)"
nursing,3asivx,auraseer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:48:50 2015 UTC,"Of course, paraffin is an insulator! I don't know how I forgot this. I'm not sure of this Coban you speak of, will normal clingwrap do?  Oh we bolused the crap out of him with prop and fent. Dude was still thrashing."
nursing,3asivx,Ness51,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:40:49 2015 UTC,"Coban is a brand name for elastic self-adhesive wrap. (Is there another shorthand name for the stuff?) I think it works better for this purpose than regular kling roll because it won't slide easily and you don't have to tape the end to hold tension.   If you don't have that product, you could use kling or plain gauze or even an Ace wrap if you like. You're only leaving it long enough to get the EKG, and then you're cutting it off anyway."
nursing,3asivx,kitty-cat-meow,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:53:12 2015 UTC,"Silvadene is still being used in our burn unit-- I guess I haven't read up on any information saying that it wasn't effective. With our full thickness burns, we typically use Sulfamylon cream in the morning and then Silvadene at night before they get grafted. Once they do  get grafted we typically don't use it anymore."
nursing,3asivx,auraseer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:46:42 2015 UTC,so i know this isn't totally what you're looking for but i have this problem all the time with microprems. we coat them in aquaphor and nothing sticky sticks to them. i put leads on the upper arms and lower leg and wrap a 2x2 gauze to hold it in place since the gel is no use. is there anyway to 'tie' or bandage their leads down without being too intrusive?
nursing,3asivx,kitty-cat-meow,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:17:14 2015 UTC,"Gauze wrap is the best solution I know of.   I'm wary of using Coban on very little ones because if it's used on a narrow area, it has a tendency to fold on itself and roll up, and the self-adhesive property stops it from unrolling. Instead of a flat band you can wind up with a kind of cord shape, and I don't like to see that around tiny limbs."
nursing,3asivx,defib-the-vfib,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:31:53 2015 UTC,interesting. im not familiar with coban but i find a 2x2 dry gauze folded up with a lil piece of tape at the end stays flush to the skin not too tight and doesn't irritate their skin - provided you're rotating sites (burns from leads are awful). now those ISC probe stickers i have issues with...
nursing,3asivx,auraseer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:52:15 2015 UTC,It's mainly the precordial leads I have an issue with. So far we've been using loads of Micropore.   Premies! That's a terrifying field. I salute you.
nursing,3asivx,Ness51,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:54:15 2015 UTC,I learned a few weeks ago that you can do an EKG on the patients back instead of the front as long as you mirror the image.  I had a COPD pt that couldn't do anything put tripod so another nurse suggested we do it that way.  So if the anterior trunk is coated with paraffin you could always use the posterior.
nursing,3asivx,Ness51,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:19:21 2015 UTC,"This can be an option sometimes. But if you do place leads on the back, make sure you notify the reading physician that you've done so. Having the leads on the opposite side of the heart causes many of the electrical traces to invert. So, ST-elevation becomes depression, and vice versa. Not knowing about the changed lead placement can cause misdiagnosis."

It's our first line drug for IV analgesia because of the combination of high potency, rapid onset, short half-life, decreased nausea, and lower allergenic potential.  It does not appear to be a common drug of abuse in my region, the Midwest US. Many other opioids are easier to acquire for abuse purposes, either by trafficking or illegitimate prescription. Even when substance abusers come to the ED seeking opioids, almost all of them want Dilaudid (hydromorphone). They even tend to get angry if we offer fentanyl instead.  As of last time I checked the reports of common drugs of abuse in my area, the great majority was made up of methamphetamine, crack cocaine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and heroin, in approximately that order.

nursing,3ar3yh,scootermn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:30:19 2015 UTC,Fentanyl used for anything other than procedures is pretty much worthless imo.  A young MD told me once that Dilaudid is more effective as its more euphoric than most of the other opiates available.  If I have someone in pain (that's legitimate) I would rather start with Dilaudid for them as their pain will be better quicker and with shorter ER times.  I still like Fentanyls short acting time in traumas however as well as post RSI pain management.  I guess what I mean to say is each has their place and each is totally abuse-able.

It's a true crime novel about the killing spree of RN Charles Cullen with solid medical terminology that reads like an episode of Dateline or 48 Hours.   I've been in libraries and bookstores for years trying to find good nurse based literature, set in the medical field. Unfortunately it seems beyond a few autobiographies there are very few books, especially fiction, with nurse protagonist who are not displayed in the ""Nightingale light"" and truly reflect what we do.  In medical shows like ER, Grey's, House, nurses are still reflected as fools or handmaidens. Not overtly, but the nurse is never the hero. Beyond Meet the Parents and Parks & Rec, I can't remember too many movies/TV shows that highlight RNs in the supporting cast."

Bed Number 10 by Sue Baier & The Diving Bell and the Butterfly by Jean Dominique Bauby are both from patient point of view, focusing on their illness and the care they received but I thought they were great.  Also, The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down by Anne Fadiman was an amazing book and is a great read for anyone in healthcare.

nursing,3aqd1v,XXXMasonXXX,25,Mon Jun 22 17:31:38 2015 UTC,"so basically your blood and urine become more concentrated when you are dehydrated. thus leading to a high hematocrit, higher concentration of RBCs in your blood because of a lack of other fluids. Urine specific gravity will increase the more dehydrated you become, over 1.030.. and decrease once there is more fluid to dilute everything else. By decreasing both of these values, you are adding more fluid into the system which is the goal for someone who has a fluid volume deficit"
nursing,3aqd1v,jmerkert28,3,Mon Jun 22 18:03:46 2015 UTC,"Good answer. This would also be true for serum sodium, which will also increase in fluid volume deficit."

nursing,3aqd1v,dyskras,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:23:52 2015 UTC,The gravity is decreased because the fluid volume issue is resolved and the urine is diluted [better hydration - lower specific gravity];  the hematocrit is decreased because the viscosity of the blood is decreased as a result of compensated fluids that were lost through vomiting and diarrhoeae.    That's my POV.
nursing,3aqd1v,secpol,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:09:16 2015 UTC,"""Best demonstrates improvement"" The answer you selected is what they'll likely present with (concentrated urine and a false high hematocrit from the deficit meaning the blood is more concentrated)   When you add sufficient fluid your urine should dilute out (lower specific gravity) and your hematocrit should go down to a normal level as well as your vascular volume is now replenished.   Your thinking is right, I think, you just didn't notice the end of the question."

It always sucked that I couldn't eat dinner with my mom and she would leave to work when I got back from school. I looked forward when she would call me during her break. She's an ER nurse now that works 7a-7p days which is a million times better, IMO.   When I start a family, I hope to never work nights as it robs my time away from personal life."

Working 12 hour shifts I'm pretty much going to come home and go to bed pretty quickly either way.   Working nights I am usually able to get up by 3-4 pm, spend time with my son, have dinner, get ready, and head to work, then see him in the morning for breakfast. When I work days I see him significantly less on the days I work as I get up and leave before he wakes up and arrive home right at his bedtime. It's a little easier on my body as I don't have to switch back and forth, but I've been doing nights for 2 years now and I would say my quality of life is much better than on day shift.

He would make dinner and be there to tuck me in and head off to work. He almost always had weekends off and would switch to sleeping at night and staying awake during the day on saturday and sundays.  The only downside (for him!) was that during summer vacation I would be sneaky and ask him things like, ""Can I go over to so-and-so's house"" or ""Can I have 10 dollars to go to the movies?"" while he was half asleep and then he wouldn't remember that he gave me permission."

Honestly, for me it's been fine because my MIL and mother have watched her on the days I work since I  went back from maternity leave.   If your hospital offers day care that's usually the best option since they accommodate nursing hours.   If not, an at home sitter would be my next suggestion, since you can flex their hours to accommodate your schedule. Maybe a trusted family friend that's retired and wants to make extra money?   I live in Miami so day care is EXTREMELY expensive, that would be my third option and I would only use it as a last resort   On my days off I do a lot of activities with my daughter, we go to splash pads in the summer, museums, the zoo, parks, etc. It can get a little tiring to work full time and trying to fit in all kinds of activities on your days off, so I sometimes ask my mom to come pick her up for a couple of hours once a week or once every 2 weeks so I can  clean and run errands without a toddler whining in the background, lol.

The plan for when the baby gets here (since our son will be in school by the time I go back to work) is for me to work every other night (or just never more than one at a time) so that I don't have to worry as much about sleep between shifts, I can take care of the baby while my husband works, and nap when I can. My husband will obviously be able to watch her while I am at work and again his sleep won't suffer too much since it will only be one night at a time.   We may end up paying for childcare at some point but we are going to see how this works at first. We recently moved away from family but when we were near them they were happy to babysit when we needed it.   Another thing we have done in the past with our son was used drop-in hourly childcare.

The biggest schedule ""conflict"" I have is not knowing if I can volunteer ahead of time, or what kinds of activities I can sign the kids up for because there's always that chance I'll be called into work.

I feel stretched pretty thin since my days off I have to get up early with her and rush to do chores and so forth. It's not bad when I work daylight, but night shift..forget about it. We don't use daycare so I can't sleep and then pick her up or anything, I just go without sleep a lot.  ETA: the downside to daylight though is that I go 3 days a week without seeing her at all. She's asleep when I leave and when I get home."

nursing,3aoz2r,alethalcombination,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:40:32 2015 UTC,"Single parent to a four year old. Have been a single parent since she was about 18 months. It has been challenging since day one but it's not necessarily because of my job. In the beginning, it was really hard because I went to work at my first nursing job when my daughter was 3 months old. I was working 14-16 hours a day, hardly seeing her at all and feeling resentful about the amount of time I was spending with her vs everyone else getting to spend with her. It got a little easier as she got older but it was still hard to be away from her all the time. I was working seconds mostly but started picking up 1st/3rds for extra money. Schedule was not flexible, often had to stay over 4 hours many days in a row if the on-coming nurse called off. Child care was difficult. When I changed jobs two years later, it was better and worse. I was single, my mom was watching my kiddo, and I had a straight schedule of 2nds on rotating days off. I would work 9 in a row, off 5, work three, off one, etc. I was working 14-6 hours on shifts that were supposed to be 8 hours and had an hour commute. It was killing me within about 6 months and I looked for something else. When I found my current job, it was a wonderful opportunity. Straight shift 130-10, virtually no overtime, only Mon-Fri. Easy to find childcare now.  tldr: It really depends on your support system, availability of flexible childcare, what your shifts are like and expectations of OT, etc. Having a schedule I can count on to remain the same and flexible child care makes it easier to do everything on my own."

My husband also works nights, and the nights we overlap my son sleeps over my aunt and uncles, sometimes my cousin goes too and they have a sleep over together! On Saturday I generally pick him up around 1, and then I go into SAHM mode Sat-thurs afternoon when I get ready to go back to work. If I want to pick up more than I try to pick up when my husband is off, or my BFF watches him, etc. I absolutely love my schedule and work/mom life balance! I wouldn't trade it for anything.

I do this because the pay is very good for my area and my job is (mostly) easy.   I have a husband who works 10-6 and a 1 year old son. My husband works in education, so he has summers off. When he is working, my MIL watches my son (if I'm working, too). This is, obviously, a sweet deal. My husband and I try to share parenting responsibilities as much as possible.  The part I wasn't anticipating, though, was the loss and loneliness. I miss my son so much sometimes. I mean, I rarely have 2 days off in a row, even though I have 3 off a week, technically. When I've done a 4 day stretch at the hospital, I feel like my son favors my husband and MIL and doesn't want anything to do with me, which I'm sure is as much me using my emotional brain as truth. He also doesn't react a whole lot when I leave for work. He is so used to seeing Mumma leaving. That devastates me."

nursing,3arn98,EvilMedic,3,Mon Jun 22 23:20:35 2015 UTC,"Absolutely apply! Your EMT experience will help a lot, and grades are not the only thing they look at. It may take a few tries but if you're really interested, give it a go. Worst case you could take some science courses to upgrade your grades"
nursing,3arn98,bellajedi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:32:55 2015 UTC,Would it be better to try and go to a four year university or go to a technical school? Like I said I would be worried I put in all those years and then be told well your grades were not good enough.
nursing,3arn98,Bookholder,2,Mon Jun 22 23:38:57 2015 UTC,"Nursing school admissions criteria vary widely from school to school. I would suggest that you make a list of all of the schools you would consider attending and then dig into the admissions process for each one and see which one best fits your situation.   There are typically advisors that you can meet with, and that's the best way to get a solid answer on how competitive you are at that school. You may or may not be able to replace some of your grades by retaking classes you did poorly in depending on school policy. Some schools also calculate the GPA using only the nursing pre-req courses and ignore everything else. An advisor should be able to give you information specific to your situation and may have admission stats from previous years to share with you so you have a good understanding of how competitive you realistically are.  Some schools will require you to take an entry test and combine your score on that with your GPA to determine how competitive you are for admission. Some will also consider other factors like medical experience and even ACT scores. I know from experience that some schools go by college GPA only and don't even look at any other factors, including medical experience.  As for GPA, I know plenty of people who got in to nursing school with a 3.3 - 3.4.  I wouldn't go somewhere that isn't accredited."

I didn't have stellar grades from my first degree, but I worked in the medical field for 6 years between my last degree and starting nursing school.  I was able to get in on my first try, and managed to graduate near the top of my class.  Not saying that you'll have the same experience, but your background as an EMT will help you SO much in school."
nursing,3arn98,shitscrubber,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:51:33 2015 UTC,"Apply! Schools do look at grades, obviously, but they don't stop there. And, when people say they're 'competitive', its important to look at who's applying. Its a lot of people fresh out of high school (I am one, I'll admit) who's interest in the medical field stems from watching a lot of Grey's Anatomy. Motivation and the desire to learn is just as important (I think). My recommendation (and I make this to all of my fellow EMT/Medic friends considering this) is apply. If you don't get in at the program you wanted, go and take a science class or two at a community college while waiting to re-apply."
nursing,3arn98,dandelion_k,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:30:29 2015 UTC,"While nursing school is competitive, and some can be difficult to get into, many are more competitive when you are IN the program. Look around at different ones in your area and call for information on application if their requirements are not posted online. Most simply require passing prerequisite grades and maybe an admission NCLEX, which is very basic. If you withdrew from the prereqs, or had poor grades in them, you can retake them for a better chance at admission. Some schools don't require prereqs at all.   Technical schools can be great, and shouldn't all be lumped under ""don't have accreditation."" There are some sheister schools out there who will be happy to take your money and not let you get licensed, but most are not like that. If you're worried, online reviews, especially with the BBB are typically easy to come by. I attended a technical school for my LPN and my LPN-ADN and had a great experience.   A school only needs to have approval from the state BON for you to be able to sit for licensing. National accreditation is completely voluntary, and can take a long time to accomplish. The school I graduated with my ADN from, for example, now has a CCNE accredited BSN program. The only problems you may face with a school that doesn't have national accreditation is some graduate schools require a BSN from an accredited program - however, accredited RN-BSN pathways are a dime a dozen. You can easily save money by attending an ADN school, getting your license, and working as a nurse while you complete your BSN at an accredited program."

I have never really noticed a competitiveness of nursing school (at least compared to Med school), just find a school you like and complete their pre-reqs and then do it. Most programs I've encountered prefer prior experience in some type of health setting; CNAs, EMTs/Paramedics, etc..  My plan would be to find a school with a Nursing attachment, do the prereqs and start off with an ADN (2 year degree) afterwards start practicing and doing an online BSN program part-time. As far as the actual school, it can be tough but is totally doable. I hate to say it, but we all know that ONE nurse who we can't believe graduated, passed boards and is practicing.  You are more than welcome to message me with any questions."

nursing,3ar7na,Nethergain,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:17:49 2015 UTC,"Tell them that you feel slightly inexperienced and nervous about starting and perhaps make sure you just shadow someone for a few days. You have the experience, care work and bedside manner to do well, just make sure you understand the job role so you can work as a hca and put your student role to one side. I've worked with many people who work as a hca as a student and continue to act and practice as a student, which of course never goes down well with the other team members.   Everyone has to start new at some point and people come and go to care homes all the time. People aren't usually judgemental to the new person as long as they get stuck in and be proactive in learning the ropes. Good luck."

I'm six years in and there are still some days I don't begin charting until late in the afternoon. Do your assessments, pass your meds, put out fires. Those things come first. Charting - and getting good at charting - comes with time and experience.   Keeping your focus can be hard when bells are going off and your phone won't stop ringing, much less if there's home problems. It's another thing (IMHO) that comes with experience. We talk a lot about leaving work at work - but perhaps what is harder sometimes is leaving home at home. I know its not fully possible (either way!), but it's another thing to practice each time you're there."

nursing,3ap624,Thunderlava,2,Mon Jun 22 11:00:33 2015 UTC,"Shadow, shadow, shadow.  Shadow a CRNA if you're interested.  More than a day if you can.  CRNA is an awesome job but you absolutely need to love it, want it, and be committed to it.  The reason is the training is long (and getting longer) and requires a huge chunk of time/life commitment as well as lots of debt.  Not only that but the not-so-pretty fact that rarely gets discussed is that CRNA schools can be fairly competitive and also require nursing experience.  Therefore if you don't want to be a nurse, just a CRNA, it's going to be very, very unhappy for you fighting through your BSN, fighting to get an ICU job, putting in your time to even then possibly get rejected from CRNA school...oh and then 2-4 years of extremely hard work where you put your life on hold and go into mountains of debt if you get in.  If it really is something you want to do, make wise use of GI Bill and/or whatever the Navy has to offer.  Always get an education on someone else's dime."

nursing,3ap624,12345hey,2,Tue Jun 23 07:35:27 2015 UTC,Don't pick a career because of the salary. You're going to spend at least 2 years on the floor to get to CRNA and then even if you have your heart set on it CRNA burnout rates are high. I would only go nursing if you are truly passionate about nursing. Having the option to pursue CRNA is an added bonus

They have a year round presence in Central America and are involved in a lot of good things.  Our team of roughly 60 people spent a week in a Honduran villiage earlier this year staffing a medical/dental/vision clinic along with a food and clothing distribution.  There were also pharmacy and veterinary services as well as community evangelical and children's sports activities.  I floated around between the dental clinic and medical triage mostly, our team had physicians and seasoned nurses in the medical clinic as well as roughly a dozen nursing students from an nursing program back in the US who were in triage.  We saw roughly 3,000 patients in 3 and a half days, pulled several hundred teeth and filled nearly 20,000 prescriptions."

Worked in another ER for 6 months, just long enough to land another job because the hospital wasn't a good fit (I was interviewing at 4 months in). No one ever questioned my job hopping--my reasons were solid, I had great references and the hospital I spent 6 months at was well known for not being awesome."

nursing,3anqiu,defiantgrit,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:26:12 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on why your moving around. Might have to explain yourself. Ive worked at many places. Started in a community hospital ICU, after 1.5 years, I got bored and wanted more experience, so I moved to the local trauma hospital, was there about 2 years, then I wanted to travel nurse, so I did that for a year, then I moved to a different city, worked there only 4 months but I had some major life event changes and ended up not staying in that city to go back to travel nursing. Travel nursed a while longer, and I've settled in the last place I traveled to and been here for 5 years. Ive been a nurse 10 years, and this is the longest I've been anywhere. But all my references are great, and sometimes it takes time to find a great fit. The one job that I was at for 4 months, even if I did stay, I don't think i would have stayed in that department anyway, it was an ER, and I didn't like it, I would have transferred to their ICU eventually anyway. I think as long as you not moving around so much that it looks like your not worth the investment of training you, then your fine."

nursing,3akad4,ShryRoo,22,Sun Jun 21 00:59:40 2015 UTC,Go to CNA school first. Then pursue your nursing degree. Your homeschooling background should be an advantage as being an autodidact is a must for any health care profession.
nursing,3akad4,flamesflight,4,Sun Jun 21 01:28:37 2015 UTC,Late start? Pftt. I'm 37 and just about to graduate from nursing school. You have time.  Get a CNA cert or a tech license and get exposure to find out if you really want to be a nurse. Start all those pre reqs now too. Good luck!
nursing,3akad4,macavity_is_a_dog,6,Sun Jun 21 01:43:08 2015 UTC,"Here's your starting point: Go shadow a nurse.  That is the best way to get a short look at the job, and see if it's actually the kind of thing that interests you.   If you then want to move forward and get work experience, look for a CNA position. Some employers will hire you and then send you to the certification course. Or, you could improve your chances by putting yourself through the course, though that will cost several hundred dollars.  It is certainly not necessary to have CNA experience before going to nursing school, but it's a decent way to start, especially if you are unsure of your career direction."

nursing,3akad4,Chamiam,2,Mon Jun 22 09:31:59 2015 UTC,"Sure they do. You'll be required to sign a contract agreeing to maintain confidentiality of all patient information.  Edit: I see you deleted your further comment where you stated shadowing is illegal where you live. Why's that? If you did find a statute forbidding it, that would be news to me and I'd be interested in learning more about it."
nursing,3akad4,auraseer,3,Mon Jun 22 09:41:51 2015 UTC,"fwiw, im a previously home-schooled student that went into nursing school at your same age, with roughly ~12 credits and 0 medical experience, never worked in a medical setting before graduating and am loving it.  for me personally, just diving in and going for it worked out very well, although i did want to (and applied for) CNA jobs while in school, no one ever hired me, so i just learned via clinicals.  i knew that nursing was a good personality fit for me, and i've always been a big nerd, so i tried it out and loved it. hope that gives you some encouragement, if nothing else  with good ACT/SAT scores and a good interview with the nursing staff at your school of choice, you can look very desirable without any medical background. nursing school is different and ""harder"" than a lot of other majors, but ultimately, they still need to pick students that will get good grades and make them look good, so don't sell yourself short"
nursing,3akad4,dociletonez,3,Sun Jun 21 03:03:32 2015 UTC,"Getting a CNA cert is as simple as enrolling in a class at your local community college.  CNAs can always get work somewhere, even if it is a nursing home.  Any experience is good exp.  Work for a year or two, and take pre requisites for the RN programs in your area.    If you want to be a nurse you definitely can.  You just gotta jump througj the hoops."
nursing,3akad4,snotboogie,2,Sun Jun 21 05:08:02 2015 UTC,"Get your CNA certificate at a local community college. Start there and see how you like working as a CNA, as this is will help you figure out if nursing is right for you."

nursing,3akad4,crumblypeeps,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:27:41 2015 UTC,"A lot of people say to start as a CNA first and I may get down voted for this but I feel that would just slow you down even more if you really wanted to become an RN. Yes CNA work can give you some exposure to the nitty gritty dirty work but I think shadowing an RN would give you the best experience if that is an option for you. You can shadow a nurse and ask questions on why they do what they do and to see their rationale for what they did or did not do. I think I started nursing school at the same age as you as well. Volunteering like you said might be a good option (that way you don't have to pay to go to school to become a CNA, etc). Nursing school can be difficult but if you are inquisitive and curious and like physical/biological sciences it should be ok. Most of it is applying yourself and to try to relate the material to something you understand."
nursing,3akad4,jelsin,-4,Mon Jun 22 19:34:22 2015 UTC,First you have to accept that evolution is the foundation of all the biologic sciences.

nursing,3akad4,Ben_Afflock,4,Sun Jun 21 02:18:38 2015 UTC,"Yep. In my area gifted education is a joke, so most homeschooled kids around here are the ones being failed by the system because they are too smart."
nursing,3akad4,sophiatrix,-5,Sun Jun 21 02:54:49 2015 UTC,"Most home-schoolers are also explicitly religious and one of the reasons those people want to home school their kids is to keep them from the evil influences of the scientific method and evolution. It was not, IMO, an unreasonable assumption to think that the OP knew little if anything about biology. And let's not even talk about the way to strengthen public schools. A hint--it's not by homeschooling. Are you an expert in all the subjects you will teach your kid?"

Let's be fair, the vast majority of elementary & even middle school teachers are not experts in all the subjects they teach. Homeschooling has some definite drawbacks (e.g. my niblings are all homeschooled and while it's a great fit for the oldest, the middle child definitely has a speech impediment of which her parents are in denial.....) but expertise is not so much a qualifier considering there are people who don't even have teaching degrees (Teach for America) in public schools and parochial schools don't require degrees at all in some cases."

nursing,3akk3q,PattiePants345,6,Sun Jun 21 02:44:20 2015 UTC,"Not as a nurse but worked EMS in reserves. To start there will be a huge inconsistently in reserves and what goes on in there. Some are awesome and well run communities, and some are poverty struck areas without running water. Obviously this may not apply to your local reserves but this is what I've seen.   For typical medical problems I've seen a lot of abuse of drugs, alcohol, and people including children. There has been a lot of violence and problems with suicide. Because of lack of education in some areas there are large families and a lot of disabilities.  On the flipside they can be very caring communities who gather together to help and support their members, and members who want to bring the reserves into a better state.    Reserve work can be very rewarding and offers a lot of room for learning. There is a lot of room for educating the public and helping in ways more than just medically. There is also a very unique learning experience for medical professionals as you get problems there that you won't see in typical city work.   I 100% recommend taking a job in a reserve area for the experience. Worst thing that comes out of it is confidence and experience from difficult work. It also gave me a large respect and appreciation for what native Americans go through."

It can be depressing.  If you really want to get a taste, I'd recommend working in one of the towns right outside the res, since most people will transfer into those hospitals there since there usually aren't a lot of medical/hospital services directly on the reservation.

nursing,3akibg,Nighthawke78,2,Sun Jun 21 05:12:11 2015 UTC,Understandably so. The dressing in question was more of a scrape than anything else that wasn't in need of changing from time nor contamination but discomfort to the pt.  The nurse was swamped and I was like I'm pretty sure I can change none steriles. It just never comes up as an opportunity.  As you said 99.9% of the time it's part of the assessment.

nursing,3aier3,RunTotoRun,52,Sat Jun 20 14:10:34 2015 UTC,"I was reading on another forum about this, almost exactly what you're describing. The best answer (I thought) was they held a meeting with all the nurses on the floor and came up with a plan.  Whenever a nurse is being verbally abused by the other medical professional and someone overhears it, they call a ""code purple"" on the floor (or a color that isn't used for the hospital). Any nurse that is available grabs a clipboard, paper, and goes to the area where the verbal barrage is happening and begins quietly transcribing the altercation. No interference. Just several people writing down exactly what is being said and by whom. Making it as objective as possible.  After the incident, the transcriptions are submitted to HR.  The poster said this happened several times, then the doctor suddenly stopped."

If this happened in the hospital I was working at, I'd report those nurses for negligence towards their patients."
nursing,3aier3,tacock,8,Sat Jun 20 21:07:03 2015 UTC,This wasn't a solution for the occasional disagreements or someone having an off day on the floor. I agree that if this method was used for normal interactions it would be very inappropriate.  This was a solution for when one professional systematically curses and belittles his or her coworkers in view of others and patients. Individual reports to HR and there was no change in the offending individual's behavior over time.

nursing,3aier3,rightdeadzed,23,Sun Jun 21 01:38:19 2015 UTC,"My favorite response was to muster up the bedside voice and ask ""You seem irritable today.  Are you ok?"" and then just stare.  He either backs down on being called out, or he rages.  If he rages ""I don't think this type of response is appropriate"" and walk straight to your nurse managers office.  I had a doc follow me to my managers office raging about ""telling [him] how to behave"".  He was talked to by administration (my boss heard) and later made a meager apology (made to do so).  He was still irritable, but he certainly toned it down on my unit.  To be fair though, this had been going on for months, so I may have been a little more provoking than was needed."
nursing,3aier3,dat_joke,19,Sat Jun 20 16:29:30 2015 UTC,"Write an incident every. single. time. He abuses you. Encourage your coworkers to do the same. Also write one when he tells you not to call, as that alone is a problem. If he doesn't have someone covering him, you can't not call him.   I understand confrontation sucks, but standing up to him can not only make you feel better, but I can't tell you how many times I stood up to an asshole resident or doctor, who suddenly began whistling a very different tune from there out every time we had to work together.  But legitimately, for your safety and your patient's, his actions need to be reported. We had a group of 3 doctors that work together as a primary care group that were notorious for being dicks to the nurses, regularly hanging up on us, berating us, not answering pages, not inserting ANY orders on their own. It took nearly a year, but us all reporting the instances is what lead to them being told to shape up or ship out. Two of them made the decision to admit their patients to our hospitalist group, and one still admits to himself, but is much, much more pleasant to deal with."
nursing,3aier3,dandelion_k,16,Sat Jun 20 15:39:08 2015 UTC,"I agree.

He shut right the fuck up and came to the floor."
nursing,3aier3,aeshleyrose,2,Sat Jun 20 17:17:50 2015 UTC,I agree. You need to call him out on his shitty behavior. I had a night shift hospitalist get rude with me one night when I first came to the ICU (we only deal with them and have zero interaction with the NP or PA) and he copped a fucking attitude about my assessment skills. I've been a nurse and CNA longer than he's been a doctor. I called him out on his shit and now we're actually good friends!

We had one doc who used to literally throw temper tantrums on the floor when things didn't go exactly he way he wanted. I once saw him throw a chart across the nurses' station and almost hit another nurse. We all started making reports on him every time he pulled his shit. Administration ended up giving him a choice: he could go to anger management or lose his privileges. Needless to say, he's much easier to deal with now."

Then again I'm a 6""2' 200 lbs guy so that might work for me but not for you. A lot of those asshole doctors are just miserable little people with shitty lives who are stuck in the past when nurses were taught not to think for themselves. Just fuck that doctor.

You're a man and even though it isn't right you'll probably be treated with more respect from other men. Especially men who are smaller than you. You work in the ER, so its usually the same doctors over and over and they have to work with you. The ER also carries a sense of honesty amongst coworkers.   The thing I think is strange is that your flair says you are a Nursing Student.

nursing,3aier3,PRNmeds,6,Sun Jun 21 02:01:35 2015 UTC,"In situations like this, you need to ensure you are practicing strictly within local policy and procedure. If his behaviour causes an incident that results in a detriment to patient care, your only defence will be to go back to policy. You need to call him every time policy demands you call him, and document this. If he asks you not to call him and this is in contravention of your hospitals policies and procedures, you should request that he specifically document his instruction as it is against hospital policy. If he refuses, document your discussion, and his refusal.  In general, especially with more junior doctors who have been reluctant to come in and review a patient, I have had success with simply asking over the phone ""Okay, so are you happy for me to document I have requested a review and you have declined to review the patient?"" It might not work for your guy, because it sounds like he is acting as a law unto himself.  Finally, don't try and tackle this head on. If he has the support of management, and they have been tolerating bid behavior for years, it seems unlikely that you'll be able to effect change yourself. Make sure you are protecting yourself"

Ended up giving up and making my own decision on what to do with the patient. (Go to the ER pls.)  The next day I confronted her at the desk, asking her why she hung up on me, and why she never called back. The fricking medical director she rounds with lost his mind and started screaming that the nurses have no idea how OT do their jobs, we shouldn't be calling so late, why didn't I just treat him without calling (wut no). He stomped around behind the desk, started kicking around chairs and whatnot. At one point the nurse manager popped out of her office and then ducked back in. Thanks for the backup!   At any rate, I never reacted strongly to the tantrum, told them they needed to pick up the phone when I called them, etc etc. I later received an apology from both, and now for whatever reason, they both really like me. Go figure.  Oh- I guess they tried to report me to the DON for being ""opinionated"". Apparently the DON laughed, and agreed- then told them to answer the damn phone."

A little off topic, but I worked a few nights ago and a the new intern wrote an order for a scopolamine patch. I paged pharmacy for the dose, they need to speak with the intern for clarification. I'm busy so I give it an hour. After not hearing back, I page the doc, thinking maybe pharmacy didn't do it. No response. At this point the patient is irritated. I buy myself some time and make something up about the patch being in the OR yada yada I'm a big fat liar and didn't want to throw the intern under the bus. I get busy doing something else again, after not hearing back for 45 minutes, I call pharmacy. I hadn't looked that closely at the order and asked what the deal was. The intern ordered the patch q24h in lieu of q3days. I ask if they can send the patch and I'll make sure the order is changed. At first, they say no. Then they tell me they have four orders from other units this doc wrote incorrectly they need clarified and in some instances it's been >3hours. I explain the patient is becoming distressed and I'd appreciate if they passed the problem off to me- they agree.  I sit down and page the doc explaining what needs to be clarified. A few minutes later he calls back and is irritated: ""I'll change that order, but seriously, you need to figure this out before you page me. I'm busy up here."" I was actually speechless. I just said ok and hung up. I've been talked down to, been told to fuck off, had a chart thrown at me, but never been blamed for something that really had nothing to do with me.   A few minutes later I see the order is updated. The intern re-wrote for the patch to be changed q3hours. ""Sir, this is mogris again, please correct your order. You wrote for q3h, it needs to be q3days. Thanks so much.""   The morale of the story is, sometimes you can't control other people's reactions, you can only control your own. I've found the best way to counteract negativity is with politeness. Does it always work? Most of the time it doesn't, but going down to their level makes you look crazy.   At my last job we had an ortho surgeon who thought he was the cat's meow. On several occasions he threatened staff. Nothing was ever done- he brought money in, so the hospital covered him. Another surgeon had this thing where around the time his former wife passed away he would start making issues. The nurse handing off to me had called him at 0200 about a patient issue. At 1000 he called me for an update and I said ""the patient is now stable."" He started screaming at me saying I had no idea what happened on night shift. I told him I did, he kept cutting me off saying I wasn't told. He called the director of nursing about my incompetence. It was just a mess. I was brought into a meeting where it was explained to me around this time of year he becomes more difficult than usual. It was also mentioned they appreciated how ""pleasant"" I was with him (I guess this doc told them I was super pleasant while he yelled at me).   I don't have any solid advice for you, but I know what you're dealing with, and it sucks. I see a lot of advice to address it, I've never seen a positive outcome. People who act like this are assholes, you can't reason with an asshole. Killing it with kindness helps, but doing so is sometimes soul crushing."
nursing,3aier3,PRNmeds,2,Sat Jun 20 16:23:30 2015 UTC,The story with your intern would make me tell that story to the attending. Something with residents to remember is the patient belongs to the attending not the resident. Yes that isn't a page the attending at 3am issue but I would make it known at a better hour. Residents are in their program to learn how to be doctors not to learn how to be assholes. Make sure they know that behavior is not acceptable. Maybe my hospital has just had a great attending/nurse relationship but generally a simple page/call can make a huge difference in a resident's attitude.
nursing,3aier3,tziy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:08:01 2015 UTC,"The problem is it's a military facility, this is a military intern, and I wonder if it will get turned around on me. I work nights, our policy is we don't really have access to the attending, there is chain of command. This basically means I page the intern on call (they have the option of calling the attending), if I don't receive a satisfactory response, I call an RRT. It's the same deal on days. The attending may round, but if nursing has to call, it's always the intern you're calling.   This is my first job really working with interns. At my last job, it was the attending 95 percent of the time, or their NP/PA. When there were interns, they were on a tight leash, and there was always an attending guiding them. At my new place of employment, they're given a lot of autonomy on night shift."
nursing,3aier3,crumblypeeps,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:28:10 2015 UTC,That is a harder situation now that you throw military on top of it. I actually have a lot of experience with military intern/residents but when they did an outside rotation at a civilian hospital.   I would figure out and work the chain of command to your advantage. Find out who you need to report things to and let them handle it. If you can have the O5-6 nurse talk to the attending if able it could be more effective.

I feel like you are upset at me, but I don't know why.""  The doctor will most likely be very caught off guard and will have to put to words why he is being such an ass. There isn't a reason in which its your fault, so theres a good chance he will get embarrassed and start acting more appropriately.  I've used this move several times already in my nursing career.

It's really inspiring that you want to go to nursing school after seeing the nurses who work in cancer care. Personally for me, seeing how the nurses helped my mother when she had cancer is what pushed me into the nursing field.  Trust me, when you begin you'll feel like a fish out of water. You'll have to learn A LOT of pharmacology, pathology,  anatomy and physiology (a lot more than people THINK nurses learn). And then when you begin placement you'll feel very overwhelmed. But eventually you'll get the hang of it and it'll start making sense. You'll develop a sense of humour about it. What I'm trying to say, basically, is that it will be very intimidating and you'll feel like you can't handle it for a long time, but hang in there."

Don't worry about the ""prestige"" of any given school, as long as its not some shady for profit college its fine. I went to a no name school and still got a job at a fabulous hospital and still got into a well respected masters program.   I wish I knew what nurses did before I went to nursing school.

nursing,3agzq1,nuggero,10,Sat Jun 20 06:02:20 2015 UTC,"Essentially, and this is incredibly generalized, NPs and PAs do the same work. PAs often times can be more 'surgical oriented' and can sit as a first assist.  NPs will have a lot more 'theory' classes mixed into the curriculum. This isnt something I enjoy, I wish there were more science based courses. Clinical will also be more or less the same time wise and rotation wise.  PAs are also PAs, whereas with NP, you have 'specialties' Adult, Family, Peds, Acute, Geri, OB/GYN, Palliative, etc etc. Family being the most versatile.  NPs in many areas are also more 'indepedent', some being able to practice without any physician oversight, some are attracted to this part of it, but that's on a state by state basis.  Whenever I see this question, I always wonder what the person asking thinks the difference is. But I always say, if you have the RN, you're really over halfway there, do the NP.

That's not a life and I can't see it having a positive long term effect on you.   Don't wait until you're too far gone to be good anywhere else before you hit the door.

So, you are a normal, sensitive, caring, thoughtful person in a stressful situation. But you can correct that!  I find it helps to have a plan of some kind. Just the process of developing some kind of plan makes me feel like I can have some control over my present and future.   I also try to find thing that 'fill me up' when I am depleted- exercise, hobbies, friends, social outlets, church, music- whatever.   And maybe it is time for a change of scene.

This part, at least, is straightforward to address.  Switching back and forth between night and day shift is very difficult and disorienting for most of us. If you work nights, you'll get a lot more rest if you stick to a generally nighttime schedule even on your days off.  That doesn't mean keeping exactly the same hours you do at work. When I worked nights, my off-day schedule was to set my alarm for 2pm and then go to bed about sunrise. That way I was able to keep up my social life and interact with the rest of the daywalking world, without completely crushing my sleep schedule and trying to live on day shift. Shifting that way, by just a few hours, was much easier.  I'm not saying better sleep will fix everything. Burnout is a complex problem. But being chronically sleep deprived is unhealthy and makes everything else in your life a lot worse. Being well rested is a good first step toward solving other issues."
nursing,3ai8l2,auraseer,2,Sat Jun 20 20:01:43 2015 UTC,"This was big for me. I was having a tough time sleeping about a year ago, was taking prescription sleep meds 3-4 times a week and still struggling on my days off. It really affected my mood and being able to handle stress  Now I stay up til 4 am (so it's still dark when I go to bed) and don't set an alarm on my days off, letting my body sleep if I need to. This results in me waking up somewhere between 11 am and 1 pm and helps me to not have to force myself to function sleepless on my precious days off. It also makes working a night shift so much easier because I'm not fighting that ""it's midnight time to sleep"" feeling  I do live alone so I understand these types of sleep schedules don't always work as well for people with a spouse or children"

Even when you are new, you can put a patient on the monitor, get them undressed, and assist the primary nurse in her assessment.  This will get you oriented with the staff and they will see that you are a good worker.  Timidness and nervousness can sometimes be seen as lazy as new nurses may sit at the desk a lot because they don't know what to do.   I disagree with not triaging in the first year.  Perhaps not in triage alone, but you will be triaging your ambulance patients and often times alone. So the quicker you are exposed to triage the better.  Imo.  Eat and go to the bathroom. Unless you are in the trauma bay for 8 hours straight, titrating drips, or coding a patient there is no reason why you can't pee and get a quick bite.  Non emergent orders can wait 5 minutes.  Take care of yourself so you can continue to care for others.   If something doesn't add up or doesn't look right, double check.  Don't assume anything.    Good Luck!"

Regardless of the stature of the teacher it's unfortunately just not your place to do so this time.   I came across a similar question where there is a patient and the nurse is best friends with the patients spouse. The patient had HIV and the question was what was ethical for the RN to do. She obviously couldn't discuss the situation with her friend but the answer was that the RN could discuss the importance of notifying the spouse of the circumstance for their safety. It's a shitty situation but it comes with the job :/  In reference to the case study, I suppose you could provide information regarding abusive relationships, suggest making an escape plan, and provide resources that would be beneficial in the instance she would need them."

nursing,3ag471,ENRN,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:13:04 2015 UTC,Gotta avoid that stereotype!....Oh wait....
nursing,3ag471,flashblazer,12,Mon Jun 22 03:24:19 2015 UTC,"This is a good example of why we're not always taken seriously when we ask for a ""Seat at the big kids table"" when trying to affect change in our respective facilities."
nursing,3ag471,InTheHamIAm,7,Fri Jun 19 23:33:32 2015 UTC,My favourite ever fitness to practice hearing was heard by the NMC - a nurse was struck off for throwing apples at her colleague.

nursing,3ag471,gynoceros,6,Tue Jun 23 22:23:31 2015 UTC,I haven't read such a juicy fight report since I worked as a midwife at Sister Mary Catherine's Home for Wayward Girls.
nursing,3ag471,markko79,2,Sat Jun 20 01:00:51 2015 UTC,"I feel dumb, what does ROW stand for in this case?"
nursing,3ag471,Sorrypuppy,2,Sat Jun 20 09:35:10 2015 UTC,A row is an argument or a fight.
nursing,3ag471,misslizzah,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:07:26 2015 UTC,"It's an English word for fight,   the ""ow"" sound in row is pronounced the same as ""cow"" when it's referring to a fight."

nursing,3ag471,8spd,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:07:45 2015 UTC,"Nothing about revocation of license or probation. Maybe the rules are just strict here in CA, but I think I would've lost my license if I started a fight like that at work. Heck, I know a nurse who lost her license due to a domestic dispute that ended with a punch."
nursing,3ago0d,ImScaredPoopless,9,Sat Jun 20 00:25:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know what your state BON requires, but here in my state, you are required to report yourself within 10 days of any arrest, conviction, etc. I would check your NPA and CYA."
nursing,3ago0d,yeyman,3,Sat Jun 20 03:35:08 2015 UTC,"I second this, be up front with state nursing boards ASAP. Don't let this linger and end up getting screwed later on down the road. In many cases, a dwi does not cause a nurse to lose his/ her license, but it must be handled professionally with state boards."
nursing,3ago0d,M4D_SCIEN7IST,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:51:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip. I will call them Monday .
nursing,3ago0d,MoreWeight,3,Sat Jun 20 05:34:02 2015 UTC,"Have you talked to anyone about your nursing license and the dwi effect on it? I am in Florida and nurses who get a dwi are sent for an IPN eval. Some of which then have to go to drug treatment (some inpatient and some outpatient, depends on how eval goes). I would figure out if you need to contact someone about this, or if you can just wait and see. This would be my first step."
nursing,3ago0d,UseUrLogic,2,Sat Jun 20 02:03:58 2015 UTC,"Hi thanks for responding..My DWI was in Long Island (I'm in CT) and my lawyer regarded as a very good DWI attorney in LI) said that he's had lots of nurse clients and the DWI didn't cost them their licence. Now these were working nurses so it's probably harder to take their licenses away, and I've honestly been too scared to call up the state Board to ask how it would affect someone like me who hasnt been working."
nursing,3ago0d,quietmote,2,Sat Jun 20 02:31:31 2015 UTC,"You can call the state board and just ask. They're not going to ask for your name or hassle you over it. Zero reasons to be scared over calling the BON, you can have your questions answered without them ever knowing who you are. If you've got your lawyer on it though, you can just let him/her do that."
nursing,3ago0d,quietmote,0,Sat Jun 20 03:33:57 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll do that.
nursing,3ago0d,MoreWeight,2,Sat Jun 20 05:34:36 2015 UTC,You may also want to start looking into what options you have for getting an expungement of the dwi from your record.
nursing,3ago0d,MoreWeight,0,Sat Jun 20 04:29:00 2015 UTC,"I may be able to get it expunged after a several years. In the meantime, do you think there is any realistic chance to get hired anywhere? After 6 years of waiting with no healthcare related work experience, I probably don't stand a good chance do I ?  Edit- actually I looked it up..there's no way I can get it expunged"
nursing,3ago0d,16semesters,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:32:01 2015 UTC,"If it is a misdemeanour and not a felony you will have an easier time of it in terms of getting it expunged.  Look into finding some ways to volunteer in your community as well, showing that you are trying to have a positive impact on society is important when trying to get an expungement.  Can you look into taking a refresher course/certification of some sort? I'm not in the united states so I'm not entirely sure what's available to you but maybe showing that you've continued to keep your education current will be helpful.  And in terms of explaining your offense, you are going to be at a disadvantage for getting hired for sure, but maybe being upfront with explaining the particulars of your situation, why the dwi happened in the first place, and what you've done to change your life/make up for your offense in the meantime will be helpful.  You lose nothing by trying, if you don't apply at all you'll have zero chance of getting a job in your field."
nursing,3ago0d,eurcynia,2,Sat Jun 20 05:49:10 2015 UTC,"Its not that they will take your license (they really dont like to do that, it almost never happens), but they may make you have an eval of your substance use or lack of. I think its pretty much automatic here in Florida so I am surprised they havent contacted you. Definitely contact them, its best to be up front. Definitely your first step in getting things moving."
nursing,3ago0d,eurcynia,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:25:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I think they didn't contact me yet because I just got sentenced a few days ago even though the initial arrest happened almost a year ago, plus it was in another state. But I will be sure to contact them first thing Monday."
nursing,3ago0d,opheliakitty,2,Sun Jun 21 04:27:51 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Best of luck! I know its hard not to stress out about finding a job, but you are taking the right steps to get things moving. If you dont try, the answer is always no."
nursing,3ago0d,opheliakitty,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:30:06 2015 UTC,My DWI was in Long Island (I'm in CT) and my lawyer regarded as a very good DWI attorney in LI) said that he's had lots of nurse clients and the DWI didn't cost them their licence. Now these were working nurses so it's probably harder to take their licenses away   Losing your license is not the same as having restrictions on it. You still may have to go through a substance abuse program to be actively working it all depends on the state.
nursing,3ago0d,opheliakitty,2,Sat Jun 20 15:20:52 2015 UTC,"have you looked into HSRA Nurse Corps Loan Repayment Program for your student loan?  By committing to work for the underserved population for 2 years, a good chunk of your loan can be paid for by the program. there's nothing in the Application and Program Guidance that prohibits you from applying with your DWI (I didn't read, just searched keywords like arrest, felony).   Good luck!"
nursing,3ago0d,bradford99,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:28:46 2015 UTC,"Hey that sounds interesting! Thanks!  Edit- turns out you have to be employed full time to qualify..   You must also be a licensed registered nurse or nurse faculty, have completed training, and be employed full time at an eligible critical shortage facility."
nursing,3ago0d,bradford99,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:07:52 2015 UTC,"Ahh.  You have to be employed by an underserved population (including nursing homes, etc). But if the issue is finding a job at all, also.  Good luck!"
nursing,3ago0d,allonsy90,2,Tue Jun 23 23:42:47 2015 UTC,"If you really want to still do nursing, you need to get a lawyer that is familiar with working with the BON ASAP. If you say or do the wrong thing to make the BON suspect that you have ever had a problem with alcohol, you are probably going to get slapped with a public mark on your license (CT does not seem to have a private impaired professionals program for nurses?) and stipulations that will make it impossible for to get a job...well...more impossible given your current job history."
nursing,3ago0d,iceangelred86,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:22:26 2015 UTC,"Well I've already been evaluated by a drug and alcohol counselor in CT as part of my DWI case, and her assessment was very favorabe, it basically said that I don't have a substance abuse problems. I'm also going through a year of a probation type substance abuse program where I submit to regular drug and alcohol screenings as a condition of my sentence, so hopefully that will help. I'm honestly not in any financial position to hire a lawyer right now anyway. I couldn't even put it on a credit card if I wanted to. I'm coming to accept the likelihood that I'm pretty much ruined from this mistake. Thanks for the advice though."
nursing,3ago0d,16semesters,2,Sat Jun 20 19:48:35 2015 UTC,"My experience as a nurse who is currently in her states nurse monitoring program and who talks to a lot of nurses in other state programs is that CT will probably demand another eval from a BON approved evaluator. Consequences range from getting stuck doing a few concurrent UAs for a year to a big red probationary license with stipulations on stuff like passing narcotics and where/when you could work. Even the worst case scenario isnt usually the end of the world...there is a girl in my program who managed to find a LTC job despite having graduated 3 years ago, never worked as a nurse, and has the whole worst case stipulated license with a DUI conviction."
nursing,3al02l,kgbcat,11,Sun Jun 21 05:56:16 2015 UTC,"As someone who has worked at a 'number 1' hospital there really is no difference and it doesn't make us any better. At these places, you do some things funny and things you invent every time it is mentioned you say 'which we invented here'."

nursing,3agl59,zeatherz,8,Fri Jun 19 23:58:20 2015 UTC,"I believe your state Board of nursing should have pass rates for each schools program, so check with your state Board of nursing. As far as reviews, there is nothing outside of talking to alumni that I'm aware of."
nursing,3agl59,mackrealtime,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:19:15 2015 UTC,"Yep. Whatever your state is, look up the BON site and it will list pass rates for schools in alphabetical order. It will show number of students who took the exam, and %pass for that year.  Here's Cali BONs pass rates. But just google whatever your state is, and it should list similar info."
nursing,3agl59,destroyingtocreate,2,Mon Jun 22 02:52:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, do not use that list by I believe USAtoday, bunch of lies"
nursing,3agl59,lurknomoretoday,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:15:48 2015 UTC,/u/mackrealtime is right check BON.  I know KS has multi-year pass rates for both LPN and RN.
nursing,3agl59,MommyNurse2012,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:55:45 2015 UTC,"It is depending where you are. Where I live, the nursing union publishes the pass rates every year in a document. Schools do get reviewed if the drop out rate is very high, and end up being forced to make changes."
