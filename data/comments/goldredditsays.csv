goldredditsays,3cokia,xavierdc,17,Fri Jul 10 15:42:42 2015 UTC,"Dear Fucking Manchild,  I'm sorry I am no longer 16. I have in fact grown up, my testicles have dropped, and while I do spend a great deal of time on the internet - in fact, my job is building and repairing web applications - probably ones you might have used, I do grow weary of the internet's bullshit.  I'm glad that you've found 4chan and Reddit, but did you know, there's approximately 180 million websites, give or take? Most of them do things like sell clothes and provide news, or blog about their cat. Or porn. There's a lot of porn. You'd be surprised that desu memes, n****r jokes, and MRA brosites are a really fucking small portion of the internet. Not 0.1 percent. Not even close.  So when you talk to me about the ""real internet"" - I build the real internet. I run network cables, rack servers, parse out bad namespace errors, fix 500s, rebuild RAID arrays, and do the shit that makes the real fucking internet - where people behave just like they do in real life.  Your anonymity doesn't make you strong. It makes you fucking weak. You've decided your baser instincts belong on the internet instead of your humanity, and you allow people like Ellen Pao and Anita Sarkeesian to take the fall for you. You don't fear the loss of free speech - you fear the requirement to be an actual fucking person on the internet. To have to listen to your opposition, treat them with basic human decency and compassion and possibly change your fucking mind.  You fear accountability. I own every word I've ever said here, even words I've regretted deeply. I'm easy to reach and my real name has been disclosed several times. I'm friends with several users here. My Twitter and Google+ both disclose my real name, and most people here know where I work. If you want, I'll gladly share.  You, who would unironically use a term like hugbox, are busy raging at the loss of your own. You need the chans, because you couldn't stand with me man-to-man. You have to post ""Lol U Mad, Bro"" memes, because you're not mature enough to take constructive criticism in a stern voice.  The rest of the internet is growing the fuck up. Twitter and Facebook are spreading news and helping freedom fighters seek democracy. They were also a medium to allow hate to spread, but they're working to fix that.  Honestly, I have a new relationship, a new apartment that still needs some touch up, a full time job, and a variety of recreational activities and family commitments. Internet bullshit time is not in that list. My phone notifications are an integral part of my existence - I can't choose to turn them off for three hours. Getting brigaded doesn't make me cry, or damage my self-worth one fucking iota. It's a waste of my fucking time however, and oddly, when you get older, you start to treat it more like the precious resource it is, and mourn the time when you were younger that was wasted on things like internet bullshit.  No adult worth their salt will ever say - ""I wish I repressed more homosexuals and women and fatties on /b/ when I was younger.""  I also am getting to the point where I might want to have a child, and if she is a daughter, I want her to be able to live her life free of scorn based solely on the fact that she has a pair of tits and you're capable of avoiding my parental retribution. I do worry about what sort of internet we're leaving behind, but more importantly, what sort of people we're leaving behind. I do not want my daughter surrounded by pathetic people like yourself - people who can't handle the least bit of consternation without building a wall of anonymity and snarking or slandering in the dark. I don't fear your attitude, I fear your pervasive cowardice, and the pseudo-intellectual veneer you assholes put over it - with bullshit like the Men's Rights Agenda, and Redpilling and Egalitarianism and anti-SJW and these obsessive fucking Gates. There might be real people with good ideas in each of those groups, but you're sure as fuck not one of them.  So now, you get to look at the real internet - full of commentary and commerce, discourse and information, accountability and responsibility. You can come the fuck along, or you can run back to your hugbox, but don't blame me when the world changes around you.  Sincerely,  Justin Scott, Adult.  [Edit: As a note: I appreciate all the upvotes and Reddit Gold - seriously, thank you so much. I would a;sp appreciate that if you're coming here from another sub that you do not downvote brigade /u/Skragzilla or any other user that comments. We're here to foster healthy debate about this, and I view brigade downvoting as a silencing technique. Thanks. -JDS]"

It's kinda crazy what sort of stuff rises to the top of mostly-unregulated, free speech-based anonymous forums.  I know this isn't a deep comment and really don't want to argue with anyone. Seeing how few clicks it takes to get to the seemingly official neo-nazi party subreddit was probably the most shocking thing I've experienced here since I first decided to click on /r/all a few months back.

They are a private site, not some sort of open communication platform created by the government that can't alienate our constitutional rights. But the more I think about it, the more I feel like reddit is already using largely the right approach, as much as I hate to admit it.   Sure, it might prove beneficial to repeatedly penalize these users and make it clearer than it is now that they are unwelcome guests here, but I get the feeling that if you deprive them of their echo chambers they'll just crud up the rest of the site more than they do already. I mean, they do come to reddit to vent about their delusional frustrations with other delusional people, but the real appeal here for them seems to be the chance to indoctrinate impressionable users in other subs. If you take away their subs, they'll have no distractions from that activity.    Unless reddit goes and hires a huge team to police the site, there is no feasible way to moderate and ban a nebulous mass of assholes when they're simply woven into the rest of the site."

Unless reddit goes and hires a huge team to police the site, there is no feasible way to moderate and ban a nebulous mass of assholes when they're simply woven into the rest of the site   I don't think this is necessarily true. All it takes is for someone to report a comment (for hate speech or whatever) and even if only 20% of accurate reports end up with someone getting shadowbanned that will be enough to put a lot of people off. If there were stricter site-wide rules, mods would be able to help with deleting comments and banning people from subs. There'd certainly be no shortage of people willing to lend a hand."

It's not necessarily true, i participate in a relatively small sub (provincial sub) and occasionally we have those nationalist, xenophobic, racists, etc, that show up with their posts.   The nature of the subreddit give them an opening to speak, but they are soon called out and downvoted. If they use hate speech, their comments get deleted.

goldredditsays,3c7nik,Fairleee,9,Sun Jul 5 23:31:38 2015 UTC,"The other one they cite is that awful one from the 80s, where the author (can't remember his name) came to the conclusion that something like 60% of rape accusations are false based on looking at about 20 cases and deciding for himself if he believed the victim or not. No study with a high quality methodology ever shows double percentage figures for false accusations; the higher quality ones usually come under 5%. There was also a Crown Prosecution Service report in the UK which looked at false rape accusations (where a report was filed with the police); over 5000 rapes were reported, and I believe it was around 30 which were found to be false, and the person who filed the report was either prosecuted for wasting police time or perverting the course of justice (i.e. The same thing you are prosecuted for when filing any false report).  Bottom line is that, unsurprisingly, false rapes accusations that are malicious in intent are very, very rare."

goldredditsays,38q7lz,Gamiac,4,Sat Jun 6 02:56:57 2015 UTC,That's a good definition.

goldredditsays,38q7lz,Gamiac,13,Sat Jun 6 03:25:36 2015 UTC,That is exactly correct. It's a dialogue ending slur thought up by people who want license to be nasty without being made to feel bad for it. It's part of the culture of entitled selfishness.
goldredditsays,38q7lz,StumbleOn,10,Sat Jun 6 03:28:14 2015 UTC,"Well, my point is that skepticism of people's biases will eventually lead you to the conclusion that people naturally end up biased against groups who aren't as powerful as them, which ends up manifesting as the societal trends of misogyny and racism. Another point is that the people who use ""SJW"" as a thought-stopping, overly broad smear word end up using it in such a broad fashion that it completely loses all meaning, and then it just devolves into unconstructive out-group bashing.  But, yeah, your point about people wanting to hurt others without being challenged for it is valid, too, and many of those people are absolutely fighting against the idea that their biases must be challenged, and defeated if it turns out that their biases are, in fact, harmful, or even outright wrong. As it turns out, many of our biases are comforting, and it's very easy to simply want to roll with them without much thought, because it feels good to have our internal biases validated.  This is one of the main struggles of self-improvement, and therefore skeptical thought, because this means we're fighting against ourselves in the effort to become better, smarter, and more rational people.  It's hard, being irrational, and trying to overcome your biases. It's hard, and no one understands."
goldredditsays,38q7lz,Gamiac,3,Sat Jun 6 03:36:18 2015 UTC,It's so frustrating when people claim the mantle of skeptical inquiry to somehow insulate their own biases and assumptions from inquiry. How can someone claim to be a true skeptic if they never examine themselves?
goldredditsays,38q7lz,sydiot,2,Sat Jun 6 22:11:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is.

goldredditsays,38q7lz,DeletedLastAccount,9,Sat Jun 6 04:39:29 2015 UTC,"Issue with that is that people who criticize the unconscious biases of certain groups are often labeled SJWs, so it isn't really about whether or not they're aware of their own unconscious biases and take action to correct for them, as much as it is the fact that they dare take action in questioning others' biases that gets people labeled as SJWs.  Keep in mind that I'm being more descriptive in my definition rather than perscriptive. I'm looking at how people tend to use the word and defining it based on that."

It's more an issue with the relative ignorance of youth and the ominpresent influence of internet echo chambers that reinforce their biases. It may serve as a countermeasure to legacy bias in other populations, but it is no less insidious.  Though I'll admit that people who call others SJW's are usually as silly as the SJW's themselves.
