xmen,3e31f0,disabled_dork,37,Tue Jul 21 16:00:29 2015 UTC,"Eh, not a big deal. It was nice to have her, but the producers lucked into signing her for a multi-picture deal right before she got huge, that's all. It's not like she's betraying the long legacy of prestigious Mystique actresses before her or anything."
xmen,3e31f0,VaudevilleDada,13,Tue Jul 21 17:49:11 2015 UTC,Having multiple women play mystique would be great.  She is a shape shifter and we have seen she doesn't look the same throughout her life. She chooses a look for awhile and sticks with it. But she doesn't keep it forever.
xmen,3e31f0,dashrendar,2,Tue Jul 21 21:17:25 2015 UTC,"...or you know, they could drop Mystique and focus on.other characters.  Lets be honest, Rebecca Romjin was decent but hardly a stand out, and while Jennifer Lawrence was good in First Class, she seemed utter uninterested during the entirety of DOFP."
xmen,3e31f0,SpaZticHero,30,Wed Jul 22 03:22:24 2015 UTC,Her reason is fumes from the makeup? I'm sure they would use dangerous materials on an A-list actor for one of the biggest franchises in movies.
xmen,3e31f0,TheDarkNightwing,30,Tue Jul 21 16:16:30 2015 UTC,"There's actually something to this. FarScape actress Virginia Hey, who played the blue-skinned Zhaan, had to leave the show because of what the makeup was doing to her.    the blue makeup worn over her head and chest to achieve Zhaan's appearance caused her kidneys to bleed, subsequently causing a decline in her health.   Along the same lines, John Rhys-Davies had severe allergic reactions to the prosthetic adhesive while playing Gimli in Lord of the Rings.    Rhys-Davies suffered severe allergic reactions to the prosthetics used during filming, with his eyes sometimes swelling shut. When an interviewer asked him whether he would consider returning to the role for the film version of The Hobbit, he said, ""I've already been asked and to be honest with you, I wouldn't. I have already completely ruled it out. There's a sentimental part of me that would love to be involved again. Really I am not sure my face can take that sort of punishment any more.""   Now, granted, I don't know of any reports that Lawrence has experienced any of these things, but it's also the sort of thing she might not want to disclose. Who knows? It's also clearly a risk, so even if she's not experiencing those symptoms now, I can certainly understand not wanting to keep chancing it."
xmen,3e31f0,IHaveThatPower,13,Tue Jul 21 17:51:44 2015 UTC,Anything is toxic if you breath it long enough. Having to breath that shit for hours a day during a 5-6 month movie shoot will have long term effects on her health.

The producer for Apocalypse already said the movie ""will be centered around her"". Which seems crazy to me, to have another Mystique focused plot.  It reminds me of Halle Berry/Storm... When she joined, she wasn't a big name. Then she starts getting recognition, does some other movies with buzz and suddenly we need the plots to be changed to focus on those characters.   The actor should bend to the character - the character shouldn't bend to the actor. I feel like people go to see X-Men movies more for Mystique and Storm - not as much for Jennifer and Halle."

xmen,3e31f0,vamplosion,7,Tue Jul 21 20:02:22 2015 UTC,"Mystique's movie make-up always was silly, that bright blue tint is horrible.  Like her in the comics, don't care for any of the movie versions."
xmen,3e31f0,FluffyBunbunKittens,9,Tue Jul 21 18:37:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And I was always kind of put-off by the fact that they made her nudish with weird, slicked-back. What's up with that? What were they going for? And why not just give her the white dress with the skull belt? Wnd why try to make her such a huge part of the story? The whole thing is perplexing."
xmen,3e31f0,stratargy,6,Tue Jul 21 19:45:17 2015 UTC,"I heard in the original X-Men they hired Rebecca Romijn because they figured a model could stand to sit in the make-up, and they never intended her to have such a big role (relying on other actors to be Mystique in disguise). However, they really liked her performance and expanded it in X2. I imagine that's part of why they kept her part fairly big in the prequels.  Personally, I love Mystique, but I hated the hair too. It's terrible.  My only guess is it had something to do with the makeup and prosthetics they used originally."
xmen,3e31f0,vulturetrainer,6,Tue Jul 21 22:03:34 2015 UTC,They just wanted to make her a huge part of the story because she was their biggest star. Never really cared for her myself and her role in the movies.

She's come into her own from calling Prof. X a jerk to now being called Prof. K by the students. She's had some amazing storylines - I'm a megafan of her in Excalibur especially.

xmen,3dwaik,LieutenantDanzig,3,Mon Jul 20 13:58:46 2015 UTC,"Right, because Nighcrawler or the X-men totally forgot they met in the 80's prior to X2.  Continuity hasn't been their thing.  I would let it slip."

Generation Next is really amazing so I recommend it as well. I didn't like X-Caliber that much but I know some people did. X-Man isn't very good but you might be confused by some stuff in Omega without him. The X-Universe and Chronicles books were nice fluff but just not that important. I still say read them all though, it holds up."
xmen,3dw5c1,Zthe27th,3,Mon Jul 20 01:21:49 2015 UTC,As someone who read them all the day the came out back in the 90's I would definitely say read all of them in the right order.

They are a huge nostalgia trip for me and just the thought of being a teenager, the Prof dieing and the X-world I loved being completely overhauled and also not knowing if this was permanent or temporary was an awesome time in my comic reading life.   I personally loved the art style back then but there is no doubt that what I enjoying reading these days as a 35 year old is very different from the fond memories I have of reading this on release twenty years ago."

xmen,3dvyr0,thatsocraven,6,Mon Jul 20 00:02:08 2015 UTC,"X3 has two main problems, only one of which this rant touches on.  First, it has too many simultaneous plots going on, that have no real reason to interact with each other. First, a mutant cure is discovered by Dr. Kavita Rao. Magneto finds out about it, flips out, and has to re-form his Brotherhood with a bunch of new characters to stop them. This part of the movie is great, it continues the ""named mutants cause everything weird"" and ""the government really cares about mutants"" themes, and the action scene with Leech is also fun. Magneto gets to do an actually impressive example of magnetism, which was all over the trailers because it's the only cool use of anyone's mutant powers in the entire movie. You also see a (bad but consistent) explanation of why Magneto's Brotherhood is only half a dozen people: he is really bad at tactics, and throws everyone else's lives away for dramatic effect.  Second, Angel tries to come to terms with his new mutant powers. This is faithful to the Silver Age comics, but doesn't really make any sense these days. In real life and in all modern comics, having angel wings is just about the least threatening, sexiest mutant power of all time. And, of course, Angel never really meets any of the many other main characters involved in the Cure storyline, his scenes are just cut through the film to remind you that he's there.  Third, Jean Grey has turned into the Phoenix, immediately gone Dark Phoenix and acquired Scarlet Witch's powers, and goes on a rampage killing the X-Men. This plot is handled very poorly. She kills Cyclops off screen for no reason, except to clear the path for Wolverine to take center stage later in the movie. She kills Xavier for a better reason, but they immediately have to start retconning that one back out like he's Nick Fury. The climactic showdown with Wolverine ends in the most boring and out of character way possible: Wolverine is stronger than everyone (because this is movie continuity, he is the ultimate mutant) and just walks up and kills her. This is a complete betrayal of the dramatic potential of the best X-Men story ever written, and manages to be worse than all 3 previous endings in other media (comics, Animated Series, and Untold Story). It removes any sort of dramatic agency from the most powerful superheroine in any superhero movie so far, which is pretty consistent with her lack of characterization in the rest of this movie.  Why are these two movies happening at the same time? Nobody ever suggests that they take Phoenix down with the government's army of cure guns, not even so they can debate it and decide against it. Even when Dark Phoenix is going crazy about 100 yards away from Leech, whose entire purpose is to harmlessly stop mutants, nobody puts two and two together. Similarly, when Angel decides to embrace his mutant identity, flies out the window and sees a rogue mutant wrecking San Francisco, does he have second thoughts? The writers neither know nor care.  The effects also don't sell Phoenix's powers as being more impressive than Magneto's or Xavier's, or even Storm's. The script is all about telling you that Jean is super dangerous and out of control, but she joins Magneto basically in a fit of pique, then stays totally in control for the next hour and calmly follows Magneto's dumb orders. Why? Basically, they needed to give Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen more screen time.  Dark Phoenix is perhaps the highest-level villain the X-Men ever faced, and only gets taken down by emotional appeals to the part of Jean Grey still inside her, making for some heartfelt scenes full of acting and no special effects. You know, the kind of thing that movies are great at. Instead, the film is full of sound and fury, killing or de-powering the entire main cast except for Our Hero Wolverine, while also making no emotional or dramatic sense. They should have cut this entire plot from the movie, kept Jean Grey dead until the post-credits sting, and focused on the Mutant Cure plot line."

xmen,3dvyr0,Robyrt,2,Mon Jul 20 14:49:20 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with X3 is just all the wasted potential. X3 had everything it needed to be gigantic and great, the set-up was completely there. This really should've been the movie for Cyclops to shine and take his role as the leader. The exchange between him and Wolverine at the start is short but pretty good IMO. I believe keeping Cyclops in the movie would've helped tremendously. That said, it would've also been a different movie if he didn't get killed off.   Then there's the elephant in the room...I love Hugh's Wolverine, truly I do, but Ratner didn't seem to know who the character is and as a result he's a problem in this movie. Wolverine in this franchise has established he can lead, sure, but that doesn't mean he should. Maybe if it was handled better I wouldn't have minded but this way just didn't work for me. As much as I dislike Halle's Storm I think she would've made much more sense taking over the team after Scott's death.   In short, X3 really could've been the best of the trilogy but sadly it's definitely the worst."

Drama has to come from a wide range of areas, and character death might get you in the moment, but long term it can be kind of weak, anyhow.

xmen,3dus20,kyletj1031,2,Sun Jul 19 17:59:29 2015 UTC,I really want to read some good Chris Claremont stories
xmen,3dus20,Robyrt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:54:39 2015 UTC,"In that case, you're in luck! I own the Claremont run so let me give you the rundown.  The best run is on the sidebar: Proteus > Dark Phoenix Saga > Days of Future Past > From the Ashes > Wolverine. These stories are easy to obtain and showcase Claremont at the height of his writing power, with artists that really complement him well. If you can find the earlier stuff with Dave Cockrum, pick it up, it'll give this arc more context and start off more lighthearted than these very serious tales.  The late '80s has more filler and fewer characters you'll recognize, but delves into moral and political issues, and really tries to shake up the team in ways they won't let writers do anymore. (Ever wonder who would lead the team if Cyclops retired, Storm and Wolverine got captured, and Nightcrawler was in a coma?) I recommend picking up the Ghosts TPB; if you like it, that'll lead you straight into Mutant Massacre > Fall of the Mutants > Inferno Prologue > Inferno.   Claremont's early 90s work with Jim Lee is collected in two big omnibuses; these are notable mainly for their art, the story is all over the place. Read ""Mutant Genesis"" to get the best part, his farewell 3-parter with Magneto.  I'd also recommend tracking down Claremont's collaboration with Bill Sienkewicz on New Mutants (Demon Bear Saga or New Mutants Classic 3-5) which isn't listed, but shows you some dramatic depth with a completely different set of characters. If you're a fan of the whimsical, silly side of superhero comics, Excalibur is also worth checking out.  Since then, Claremont has tried several times to get back on the horse and write some form of X-Men, but most of that work is simply not very good. The new Nightcrawler miniseries is the best one, mainly because it reads like a couple Excalibur story arcs and mostly ignores the rest of the X-Men continuity."
xmen,3dus20,Ravager135,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:17:34 2015 UTC,"Some of these are obvious: Days of Future Past and Age of Apocalypse.  My personal favorite of all time, however, is the X-cutioner's Song.  I know the feelings towards this arc are dichotomous with some people loving it or hating it.  My opinion is that it has everything you'd want in an X-Men story:   All characters across all the X-titles are involved. A new mysterious but familiar villain. X-Force as fugitives. Professor X on his deathbed and unable to lead the team. A weakened Apocalypse unlike we have seen before. MLF and the Dark Riders as cannon fodder. Exploration of exactly who Cable is.   This might not seem like a big deal with how much has been written about the X-Men in subsequent years but at the time, this was a re-invention and merging of the X-franchises with new artists and writers at the helm."

This isn't the Apocalypse from the comics or the Apocalypse I grew up watching on TV in the 90s. This Apocalypse looks like a barely 6' tall joke. I'm sure the movie will rock, but they should've invested more time into the appearance of Apocalypse. I mean fucking seriously. It's called X-Men: Apocalypse. Don't half-ass such an iconic villain."

You would have someone come in for like one issue and then leave.   To me with these X-men movies there are so many characters to squeeze in, it is difficult to do them all justice. I felt like the way they did Quicksilver was absolutely the best way to handle this.  There were a lot of little nods to the fans, little jokes, good use of his powers, they didn't spend too long setting him up, but gave you enough that you got a sense of the character, and got right to the action. I feel like Nightcrawler got a similar treatment in X2.  I honestly would rather see more of the characters brought on screen in this fashion than not at all."

xmen,3dq2vl,spwf,3,Sat Jul 18 09:58:02 2015 UTC,"Apocalypse is supposed to be one of (if not the) first ever mutant. As I understand it, he was powerful from the get-go, but further altered himself with the aid of alien science (or something like that? it's been a long time haha) and the result was the incredibly powerful Apocalypse as mainstream X-Men media knows him to be. (if this is wrong, please feel free to correct me!)  On ""space mutants"" - I'm not sure what you mean! A bunch of mutants go on space adventures, X-Men have had space-opera level drama and adventure for a long time, Professor X himself has had a long-term space girlfriend, and a bunch of them have stayed in space for extended periods of times... But I don't think there are mutants specifically from space. ... other than Scott and Alex's brother, who was born a galaxy away, but he's still technically  a mutant-from-earth....... talking about X-Men is so confusing, and hard to explain sometimes ugh sorry!  As for what X-Men is about - well, it's about mutants! Ostensibly it's about mutants surviving in a world that hates and fears them just because they are different, but over the years they've had adventures that aren't directly related to the Mutant Metaphor. As mentioned, they've gone into space and fought/teamed up with aliens, they've gone into the Mojoverse, they deal with the Phoenix Force. They also protect the world from other mutants who have evil causes (e.g. Sabertooth isn't out to kill humans because they're different from mutants, he's just out to murder people because he thinks it's fun.) I'd say that the X-Men are more than just the mutant metaphor, but that metaphor is at the core of their stories and is what sets them apart from standard superhero stories and it's what makes their stories and characters so beloved."

Apocalypse has alien tech, Wolverine has a super soldier program, Phoenix has a cosmic life force, Magneto calls up other villains and asks for their evil super-tech to recharge him, Juggernaut and Magik make pacts with demons, Cable and Bishop have future tech, etc.  The major exception is Jean Grey, who is well-established in comics to have basically the perfect mutant genes. Her future children, clones, alternate selves, etc. are all super-powerful psychics. This allows each writer to have a new, very impressive character on the team, without having to deal with Scott and Jean's relationship drama.  There are also mutants of other species, like Warlock, Longshot and Broo, but most X-Men are just mutants on earth trying to coexist. Various robots have been declared as ""mutants"" depending on your definition of the word, but those also only sort of count."
xmen,3dq2vl,Robyrt,0,Tue Jul 21 20:18:02 2015 UTC,"A lot of the unexplained 'powers' stuff is explained via the seemingly magical 'x-gene' that is supposedly present in mutants.

That she is the basis for all of Charles Xavier's actions is ridiculous. And while she may be altruistic, she isn't an original X-Man in the way that the later series presents it and her origins have nothing to do with muntant rights. She is a mastermind thief first, a henchperson (and reluctant mother) second, and an altruistic catalytic figure in the fight for mutant rights, third."
xmen,3dnpfa,stratargy,5,Sat Jul 18 14:29:32 2015 UTC,"I'm cool with it.  She's a good actress, but it felt like she was totally phoning it in for Days of Future Past.  If she doesnt want to be there, I see it as no major loss."
xmen,3dnpfa,SpaZticHero,5,Sat Jul 18 08:22:14 2015 UTC,"Well.. she is a REAL actress now, going for her third Oscar."
xmen,3dnpfa,Exodus111,5,Fri Jul 17 20:00:48 2015 UTC,"Can't tell if your being sarcastic. An Oscar hardly defines a good actor.  Case in point; Leonardo DiCaprio.  Oscars are basically just a giant party for industry people to pat each others backs, and applaud each other for being ""artistic"" or something."

xmen,3dpmvs,reedlakes,2,Sat Jul 18 05:52:17 2015 UTC,"Well, I suppose we don't entirely know the answer to this given that it isn't out yet. That being said, it looks like Extraordinary X-Men will probably be pretty familiar for people who are re-getting in to X-Men, with a decent number of characters that are familiar (though there will be some glaring omissions... Beast, and a couple of weird questions for you if you don't look them up... Jean Grey)."
xmen,3dpmvs,connerjade,2,Sat Jul 18 07:55:33 2015 UTC,"Going off of previews, I think Extraordinary X-Men and All-New All-Different should be good or decent starting points. Uncanny X-Men, weirdly enough, sounds like it won't be the/a flagship book this time, and is only important if you want to read about a team doing the black ops and morally-questionable stuff. Interesting, certainly, but not exactly required reading when it comes to figuring out the State of the X-Books.   (I hope that makes sense!)"

xmen,3dkz8m,pharaoh94,8,Fri Jul 17 03:02:08 2015 UTC,1000x might be putting it lightly. I can't explain how my excitement for this movie got sapped when I saw what they are going to try to pass off as Apocalypse.

xmen,3dkz8m,soouttahere,2,Fri Jul 17 19:10:53 2015 UTC,Oh I'll freely admit the movie could still suck.  There's only one way to find out for sure.. see it.
xmen,3dkz8m,Biffingston,3,Fri Jul 17 19:11:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I think another part of the problem that a lot of these fixes aren't addressing is the horrible, horrible purple overtones in that scene.  The EW cover clearly shows a much bluer color that doesn't look nearly like the Power Rangers reference everyone's making."
xmen,3dkz8m,iamthebluegoose,2,Fri Jul 17 12:48:09 2015 UTC,Exactly. And people tend to forget that there will be A LOT of post production being put in this film which hasn't begun yet. This trailer was meant to be for the comic con crowd who know very well that whatever they see is nowhere near finished.
xmen,3dkz8m,pharaoh94,4,Fri Jul 17 14:36:35 2015 UTC,"Nope. Sure, there's going to be a ton of post production. However, the final look, after all that post production, would have been used for the magazine covers that are out now. It makes no sense for them to not use the actual look for him they're going to use in the hype building stage. So, yes, this is exactly what Apocalypse is going to look like.  And it's absolutely garbage."
xmen,3dkz8m,silverence,2,Fri Jul 17 14:59:25 2015 UTC,"Perfectly Put, they would never put out a cover with a unfinished apocalypse on it.  especially on a magazine like EW, that tons of people read."
xmen,3dkz8m,Irahs,2,Fri Jul 17 16:57:50 2015 UTC,"I want to be wrong so badly though. Couldn't you just like... come up with some awesome counterargument to me? Maybe ""The Studio will see all the negative backlash from their Papa Smurf-cum-Apocalypse iteration that they'll have to change it!!"" Sure, it won't happen, and studios haven't figured out how important hype momentum is, but I'd really appreciate if you tossed me a straw to grasp at here, man.  Also, total dibs on ""Papa Smurf Cum Apocalypse"" as a band name."

xmen,3dkz8m,Biffingston,2,Fri Jul 17 19:16:37 2015 UTC,"No the perfectly put was referencing how the magazine cover would never use a image of someone before post production., its not like when gollum was featured they used the image of the motion capture guy. they used what he would look like exactly in the movie.  im not sure where your "" it sucks "" is coming from, the comment i replied to never said that at all."
xmen,3dkz8m,Irahs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:43:05 2015 UTC,I was talking about the stereotypical nerd outlook that if it doesn't even remotely seem to be the way that they want it has to suck. Sorry if I implied some people were overreacting.

Hell for X1 the trailers and early stuff didn't have cyclops's eye lasers he just glowed red. Have hope they will add stuff whether it was intended from the start or due to everyone's complaints.

xmen,3dkz8m,DaCodster,3,Fri Jul 17 12:35:20 2015 UTC,Ah so leading up to the movie all I'll be seeing is people complaining about the movie and how it'll be crap. Then the movie will come out and people will love it. Like every other Bryan Singer X-Men movie so far.
xmen,3dkz8m,Biffingston,2,Fri Jul 17 17:34:00 2015 UTC,I think that actually bodes well for the movie.  It means that the fans are invested in it.   this is an issue with any beloved franchise I'm sure.
xmen,3dkz8m,IncomingPitchforks,0,Fri Jul 17 19:19:10 2015 UTC,"The only Singer movie that didn't completely suck for me was X2.   DOFP was fucking terrible. Quicksilver telling Magneto ""My mom used to know a guy who could do that"" is just an insult to the series. These directors and producers take everything for a joke."
xmen,3dkz8m,DaCodster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:11:52 2015 UTC,There is a point when you need to realize that everything doesn't have to be 100% faithful to the comics.
xmen,3dkz8m,IncomingPitchforks,0,Sat Jul 18 14:22:19 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between not being 100% faithful, and baring little resemblance at all. They both run faster and have silver hair. That's about it."
xmen,3dkz8m,DaCodster,0,Sun Jul 19 17:37:16 2015 UTC,"So what, mostly everyone really enjoyed Quicksilver and that movie in general. I don't understand why the absolute die hard fanbase of X-Men are so ungrateful?! Fox has done pretty well with most of the X-Men films and the general movie goer enjoys the movies (for the most part). But whatever website I go on that has this fanbase, they're just hard to deal with."
xmen,3dkz8m,IncomingPitchforks,0,Sun Jul 19 17:42:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe people who are ignorant of X-Men comics like the movie because they are ignorant of X-Men comics. I liked World War Z, but I understand those who read the book hating the movie saying it bared no resemblance. If they are not going to be faithful to the source material, then don't use the title. Call the kid ""Fast Man"" or some shit, because that's not Quicksilver."
xmen,3dkz8m,DaCodster,0,Mon Jul 20 05:29:45 2015 UTC,I find that statement to be a little ignorant.

xmen,3dn34y,NerdyBish,5,Fri Jul 17 16:42:52 2015 UTC,"I'd read the early X-Factor comics.  Apocalypse's first appearances in X-Factor #5 and #6 and then the X-Factor Fall of the Mutants arc in issues #18-#26.  They can be a little corny, but a surprising amount of his story and motivation is laid out there in his original appearances.    Rise of Apocalypse is a great story set in ancient Egypt chronicling his origin.   And of course, the Age of Apocalypse crossover.  I feel like you never appreciate how terrible and awesome he is until you read this."

Or they did several takes of her saying it various ways and they liked her serious delivery better.   It's not as if movie-Storm has a bunch of sassy oneliners. She played the role pretty doe-eyed-girl in general, which is why I never cared for Halle Berry/the movies' version of Storm."
xmen,3dizid,howisaraven,3,Sun Jul 19 05:45:22 2015 UTC,She definitely got better with each movie I think.
xmen,3dizid,ActualButt,3,Fri Jul 17 12:20:40 2015 UTC,"I dunno, in Days of Future Past  her face alternates between just 2 expressions: ""mild grimace"" and ""completely blank.""  Also, she looks so awkward while using her powers, she puts almost no effort into shooting her lightning, and when she ""flies"" she just kind of limply hangs in the air.  It's been a while since I saw X2 or X3 so maybe she did get better, but I think her Days of Future Past performance is definitely the worst."
xmen,3dizid,Showbuckle,3,Fri Jul 17 15:56:33 2015 UTC,"Basically, by better, I mean her part got smaller and smaller.  But in defense of DoFP, I think Storm should look she's doing things effortlessly. She's not shooting lightning out of her fingers or anything, she's commanding the elements, almost like a conductor commands an orchestra. She should be graceful and subtle in her movements. And her flight should seem more like she's hanging in the air because she's literally doing just that. She doesn't zoom around like Superman, she's being carried by the wind."

It's a matter of getting a piece that has the correct amount of tracks in it (so the hair looks full at any possible angle), probably laced so they can create their own hardlines, and a dying process that won't destroy the piece.     A wig like that can be very expensive to purchase, let alone style. The pieces they used were for more practicality then style probably. Well all of them except the first one, that one looks mad cheap."

xmen,3dixky,Suckitnerdz,3,Thu Jul 16 21:54:19 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you mean the opposite? Enthused means enthusiastic. But I agree that Fassbender's Magneto has kind of lost his sheen, and doesn't resemble Ian McKellen's Magneto anymore (whereas in First Class he added his own flair to the role, but he still looked the part of young Magneto).  I know they want to distinguish Fassbender's Magneto from McKellen's (and I really get why they would want to), but there are limits to my suspension of disbelief. It’s like they’re doing everything to separate Fassbender's Magneto from McKellen, when they should really do the opposite and make one segue into the other at some stage."
xmen,3dixky,Groosalugg,2,Fri Jul 17 10:16:55 2015 UTC,"Certainly meant unenthused. Derp.  Nice to know I'm no the only one who's noticed, though. I just can't put my finger on it. Maybe I felt that Magneto in First Class looked like he was going to tear shit up like some young rebel, and eventually become Ian's Magneto in X-men (2001) - more seasoned, calm, but equally dangerous.  But what we got was Magneto looking stoic as hell in his 30's (DOFP). Besides his little spaz scene in the airplane with Charles, we haven't scene him show any emotion. I want to see him enjoy being the fringe mutant extremist leader while he's young."
xmen,3dixky,dontuse_altaccounts,2,Fri Jul 17 16:06:37 2015 UTC,"You've touched on something I feel the filmmakers have done ""wrong"" with regards to the decade time jumps between each film - they have made both characters (Magneto and Xavier) static figures, essentially doing absolutely nothing with their time between the films.   After First Class, I would have expected Magneto to form his Brotherhood from the remnants of Sebastian Shaw's Hellfire Club. But nope, he just gets arrested a year later for the murder of JFK and is plopped in prison for 11 years. Similarly, I would have expected Xavier to establish the school and actually begin operating, but a few years later the Vietnam War escalates and most of his students and teachers are appropriated to fight and die in the war, and Xavier just shuts the school down and becomes a drugged up recluse.  The exact same thing appears to be happening in Apocalypse. After Days of Future Past with Magneto's world-wide declaration for mutants to join ""a Brotherhood of their kind"", I would have expected that would have been (ANOTHER) golden opportunity for him to establish the roots of his mutant extremist organisation. But nope, he just spends ten years living in the woods raising a family after mutants have supposedly been accepted by society as a result of his actions. The scene in the airplane was the one moment in Days of Future Past where I thought Fassbender's Magneto resembled McKellen.  Minor correction to your post, you said Magneto was in his 30s in Days of Future Past. He's actually in his forties in 1973, because in the concentration camp in 1944 he was 13 years old, or at least 10 which makes his birth year in the early 1930s regardless. Which means he's middle aged in X-Men: Apocalypse, and so is Xavier. And that is another inconsistency, they don't look their age (especially Havok who should be nearing 40 in Apocalypse)."

The look of his face and what not doesn't look good either but really the thing that i'd want to change most is his size.   Its like having Juggernaut, Darkseid, or the Hulk be 6'2. No, one of the biggest parts about their characters (same with Apocalypse) is their size, and how imposing and scary it is.

I mean at least we don't know what'll happen with Magneto or Mystique, and they're pretty important characters. I'm still excited for the new film, I was like 10 or 11 when Age of Apocalypse came out, I must've read it a million times. I still remember that awesome metallic cover and everything."

xmen,3dkqll,jman0120,2,Fri Jul 17 01:41:02 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's worth a rent, if that's a possibility. It doesn't change the story and the Rogue part only lasts a couple of minutes. The other ""17 minutes of extra footage"" are deleted and extended scenes. Having watched it, I'd say I still prefer the original cut."
xmen,3dkqll,beer_me_twice,2,Fri Jul 17 02:55:49 2015 UTC,"No not really. Yeah there more extended scenes. for the majority of the film. The Rogue portions are pretty inconsequential. It's basically oh in stead of Kitty, Rogue is there. I also prefer the climax better because the Rogue cut alters things that remove some of the emotion.  Otherwise I can see why Singer cut it. There this small sequence that exists solely to have Rogue stand around and do nothing.  Oh and it restore a nice Beast and Mystique sequence. Though it messes with another scene because it essentially has finding out information and then restating it twice more.   Then certain ""lets get's dangerous scene"" has been moved but the impact is lost because the following make the character not learn the lesson.   So yeah worth seeing once but by no means a game changer."
xmen,3dkqll,neoblackdragon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:12:07 2015 UTC,"I'm a little disappointed at the lack of special features outside of the actual extended cut. There's a 50 minute documentary that has some cool behind the scenes stuff, but that tries to squish that all in with Bryan and others talking and it winds up being the only real BTS stuff on it. There's a fun group interview with some of the cast that was a nice watch and then just stills and storyboards. Felt a little short on stuff for a re-release. The extended cut as people here have said is nice, but if you already own a copy then rent or something. The extra future scene which is the pinnacle of the changes made is cool, but it's short. Most other scenes make sense to have been left out, except maybe a scene between Beast and Mystique that would make her change-of-heart at the end of the film a bit more believable."

After over 15 years of X-Men movies, I am just hoping we get to see the classic team members (Cyclops, Jean, Nightcrawler, etc.) in some actual comic-book-inspired X-Men costumes.

She was fairly central to the first movie and was at least semi central to Last Stand's plot. I would like to see her in a more active combat role though.  Secondly, she only gained her strength & flight in the comics from having absorbed and killed Ms. Marvel. They are not a innate part of her power set. It would be nice to see her with those powers so she can be more combative.  Thirdly, lastly, and most importantly, yes she should be.

I didn't find her that central in The Last Stand though. I felt she was part of the collateral damage for the ""Oh no!

These are the first major X-Men crossovers, and give you a solid introduction to the various characters. Asgardian Wars has a lot of cool ideas that, unlike most of the '80s, haven't been revisited 5 times and made into a movie. Mutant Genesis. This gives you a taste of the '90s. New X-Men > Astonishing X-Men. These are self-contained, tightly coupled, and very high quality. Plus, the modern writing style will be a breath of fresh air. Magneto Testament. A really interesting use of superheroes to address real-world issues, and pretty much unconnected to a larger storyline. House of M > Utopia > Second Coming. This is at least a coherent storyline, although Second Coming wraps up a lot of plot threads from like 5 other crossovers so it may be incoherent. Anything else, in any order you like."

I think Whedon's Astonishing is one of the best X-stories ever -- I would put that at the top of your list. There is a motion comic based on Whedon's entire run so you could even watch that with your homie.  Magneto Testament is really good as well, esp if you like Magneto... but you need to know going into it that it is just a Holocaust story, no super heroes at all. Magneto doesn't get his powers till later.  I don't recommend New X-Men. I know it gets a lot of love but I think it sucks.  I'd go like this:   Astonishing Magneto Testament Mutant Massacre -- for some Claremont 1980s goodness Age of Apocalypse -- cuz that shit is expensive as hell, and you want to bone up on Apocalypse before the new movie.

William Stryker (Colonel/Reverend) Bolivar Trask Robert Kelly (Senator) Matthew Risman Graydon Creed   There are also a bunch of anti-mutant groups to check out. They all contain other humans who are less prominent in the comics. Some of the groups also feature mutants/machines/superpowered people that are anti-mutant for one reason or another.     Purifiers Friends of Humanity Humanity's Last Stand Church of Humanity   I stuck with groups that I know are mostly/completely human.    There are tons of humans that are anti-mutant, and I'm sure I have forgotten some of the most significant ones in this little list. These were just what I could recall from the top of my head. None of them are particularly pleasant people. Hope it helps though.  EDIT: Wording."
xmen,3d91z9,PaleLotus,2,Tue Jul 14 14:25:29 2015 UTC,Have you read the X-Terminated story arc with William Stryker as Prophet? I thought that story arc was fantastic.
xmen,3d91z9,lowmodality,2,Thu Jul 16 08:09:12 2015 UTC,"You mean X-Terminated from the AoA series? Heck yes! I absolutely loved the whole AoA storyline, including the series. I highly recommend AoA to anybody that has even a slight interest in X-Men. It's so underrated.    Serious spoiler alert! Don't view it if you haven't already read the Age of Apocalypse storyline and have any intentions of doing so. You should definitely read it in its entirety. It doesn't matter if you use the original printing or the AoA 10th anniversary version. The aniversary version has some additions that are nice, though. Heck, read both if you can. Seriously, I warned you...    spoiler     EDIT: Oh god! I've never used this spoiler tag before.  EDIT 2: Okay, I resolved the spoiler issue. Turns out, my reddit app doesn't handle this tag so well. It converts any spoiler formatted this way into a hyperlink titled ""spoiler"" that doesn't reveal the text when hovering/long pressing. It only opens the link which is a reddit 404  page. lol Now I know. Be forewarned if you use Baconreader on slightly older phones."
xmen,3d91z9,PaleLotus,3,Thu Jul 16 13:23:41 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree, it's a really interesting story arc that does a lot to enhance the complexity of the mutant/human dichotomy of the comics and the films.  I should probably tell you that I'm not generally a fan of comic books and was introduced to X-Men through the movies. But I began to trawl through and research comic books that featured my favourite character of the series, William Stryker, in order to understand how he is generally written. So I found out about this comic miniseries and decided to read it, and it conformed to every little nuance I have about the character's backstory and his inner thoughts regarding mutants. I also read God Loves Man Kills, and thought it was just as brilliant.  Warning: I am going to ramble.  spoiler  spoiler  spoiler   I also love how they aren't so much anti-mutant as they are anti-evil mutant.   This is kind of the way I see William Stryker in general, especially in the films. Seeing that explored more prominently (and explicitly) here makes me feel that that was always their intention with the character, they just succumbed to showing the more dastardly side of him.  To me, William Stryker is the polar opposite to Magneto, being the human extremist to Erik's mutant extremist, and as written have equal complexity. In that vein, I wish the X-Men films had given Stryker a solo prequel story exploring his origins, much like how First Class was Erik Lensherr's origin story, and he was a protagonist in it.   In the same vein as AoA standing out from the throng of the regular X-Men comics due to inverting the dynamic we've already been privy to, such a story in the film universe could have worked amazingly well, given there's a time period in Colonel Stryker's life that hasn't been delved into at all: Vietnam.  Taking inspiration from a multitude of Stryker-oriented comics is kind of what I've done in establishing the constituent elements of this screenplay I've been working on, and working as a more valid and faithful take on Stryker's origins than what was presented in X-Men: Days of Future Past.  I have so many different headcanons about William Stryker, which have all worked their way into what happened as interim elements of his character development between the films. I tend to ramble on for far too much about Stryker's characterisation, I could talk about him for days.   Now it's my turn to digress lol. I really absolutely recommend this comic to anyone, it's such a solidly written story arc, that really brings something new and innovative to the table. And I'm not even a regular reader of the comics. Apologies for the length of this response u/PaleLotus, I just really love the character a lot :)  EDIT: I need to figure out how to do spoilers."

Somehow I don't know how they'd keep him that way with the tone that the movies seem to be going for."
xmen,3d8hef,sunflowering,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:28:48 2015 UTC,"It'd definitely be a big challenge. As far as X-Men villains go he's one of the most OTT, but there's so much that could be done with him.

xmen,3d8hef,sunflowering,2,Tue Jul 14 11:20:35 2015 UTC,"I'm just afraid that in the interest of making him more ""realistic"" (as the movies seem to want to do), they'll take away the parts of his character that make him so iconic as Mr. Sinister!

Keep him albino skinned (Matrix II got away with it with the twins). Make him one-up Mystique with the shape shifting (by duping her, and she gives him his props on it). Have the story entail the X-Men chasing their tails and getting mind fucked at every turn. Flashback(s) of his rebirth by Apocalypse.

Unfortunately, Cable just hasn't been one of those characters they chose to focus on so far.   I think a Cable & Deadpool movie could really be awesome. They're a great duo and you could easy get a strong story out of some of the stuff that happened in their series. An X-Force movie that has Cable leading the team could be great too.

xmen,3d5wpw,VolatileCurry,2,Mon Jul 13 21:09:52 2015 UTC,Thers rumors floating around fox is developing an x-force movie. So there's hope
xmen,3d5wpw,marvel2213,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:32:59 2015 UTC,Ohhhh.... I like the sound of that. I wonder if the introduction of Psylocke might lead into that. There's potential for a great movie out of X-Force.
xmen,3d5wpw,VolatileCurry,2,Mon Jul 13 21:41:51 2015 UTC,"There have been some secretive scenes filmed for Apocalypse, so he could show up there briefly. The best shot comes from X-Force, which may or may not still be happening."
xmen,3d5wpw,Nightender,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:59:09 2015 UTC,Bring on CABLE!
xmen,3d5wpw,KratosOdinSon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:39:37 2015 UTC,"Well since we're getting an X-Force movie they're probably just saving him for later. If it were me, I'd introduce him in the after credits scene in New Mutants movie (which is next after Wolverine 3 I think?) to have him recruit them Nick Fury style. Then have X-Force be the 90s themed movie, to continue the theme of 60s movie-70s movie-80s movie."
xmen,3d5wpw,DoctorExu,-3,Wed Jul 15 00:49:21 2015 UTC,"As far as we know, Cable isn't in any of the X-Men movie continuity.  Why? Probably for the same reason Rachel Summers wasn't in Days of Future Past: the events of X3 made it impossible for them to exist, since both their parents are dead. Without the time travel and techno-organic virus stuff, Cable is just a big, serious dude with guns. If you want an antihero with mind powers, Psylocke does the same job but better."
xmen,3d5wpw,Robyrt,4,Mon Jul 13 20:27:10 2015 UTC,"But Days of Future Past negated the events of...well, the whole original trilogy. Both Scott and Jean are in the ending, and present in Apocalypse. IF Cable were to show up in Apocalypse, I could see it happening towards the end. And as stated earlier, there are X-Force AND New Mutants movies in the works. Cable was a huge component for both."

xmen,3d5s12,Comicfan1001,2,Mon Jul 13 19:15:07 2015 UTC,Right. I think it's quite the phenomenon that Singer has been able to change so many elements from the source material and manage to piss off almost no one. I feel maybe because they do so well as movies instead of just COMIC BOOK movies?
xmen,3d5s12,Rennim,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:57:10 2015 UTC,I do wish that they stay to the script of x-men because I know singer likes to put his own take on things.

xmen,3dalzy,DaCodster,2,Tue Jul 14 22:33:48 2015 UTC,"Still my favourite X-Men film personally, there isn't much I dislike about the film (other than January Jones). I love the period it's set it, McAvoy and Fassbender are my favourite portrayals of Xavier and Magneto and I think that was them at their best (so far). It was fun and very well made in my opinion and I applaud Matthew Vaughn for the movie. I love DOFP, but I love this origin story just a little bit more.  Now I'm frustrated that after so many years I still see people complain about these movies. Sure Origins and Last Stand suck and they deserve the hate they get, but by now we should realize that this property is in good hands for the time being. Just because they're not ideal for the comic book fan, doesn't mean they aren't for the movie goer. I'm hyped for Apocalypse and I think it can really be the best of the bunch."
xmen,3dalzy,dacalpha,0,Wed Jul 15 20:16:02 2015 UTC,"January Jones   What was wrong with January Jones? Sure her character was poorly done (the chain cracking the diamond for one), but it's not like villain-Emma was a particularly interesting and nuanced character. I'd say January played the ice queen as well as she could have with that writing."
xmen,3dalzy,DaCodster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:01:13 2015 UTC,"I thought she was very wooden and showed like no emotion in her performance. Like when she was being strangled by Magneto, she was just like giving a blank face."

xmen,3dalzy,DaCodster,0,Sat Jul 18 02:16:21 2015 UTC,She could've showed some type of fear that she was about to die. Magneto was moments away from doing it until Charles stopped him.

xmen,3dalzy,TheParagon_MarvelUni,0,Sat Jul 18 02:32:25 2015 UTC,"That's just how that character is. Maybe she is a bad actress, I don't really know."
xmen,3dalzy,quietly41,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:37:49 2015 UTC,"*I don't think any of the X-Men movies are actually very good, there are parts of First Class I like, I certainly think the acting is better, as well, but FOX is still stuck doing the same X-Men movies which is Mutants VS Humans, there are so many other X-Men stories out there that don't deal with racism, but that's what we get.  *I also don't like Days Of Future Past at all.  I though it was lazy of them to use Wolverine instead of Kitty, why Quicksilver couldn't stay with them makes no sense, why Xavier was unwilling to use his powers to stop Mystique is unrealistic given the stakes, and that freeing Magneto didn't do anything but create an ending that was a large spectacle.  If you really think about DoFP, there's nothing there, there isn't a climax or any real conflict, just a guy who is trying to convince people that mutants are dangerous (same tune for all the movies), and America (which is apparently the only country that matters for Mutant freedom) is deciding whether or not they believe him, and the Mutants must show them they are not to be feared.    *I imagine the Apocalypse movie is going to be the same, more mutants who are against humans and now some of them see this mutant as the mutant who is right that we have to kill them all, which in my opinion is serious level jumping.  But we'll see how they set up the time between the movies."

xmen,3d36k2,bushysmalls,5,Mon Jul 13 16:13:30 2015 UTC,"So there is a really bad X-Men story that came out around 2003 called The Draco. It involved a retcon saying Kurt was actually the half demon son of a guy named Azazel. There was also something about trying to make Kurt the pope, having poisoned, disintegrating communion wafers , and convincing people he was the anti-Christ and that the rapture happened.   It wasn't very good...  Since then fans have HATED that entire run, which also involved making Xorn more confusing that he already was, and Angel having sex with a teenage, while flying, in front of her mom. Most people would be more than happy to see it brushed under the rug and forgotten about."
xmen,3d36k2,Frearthandox,2,Mon Jul 13 16:32:37 2015 UTC,Oh so the Nightcrawler is the son of Azazel thing is only 12 years old? For some reason I thought he was for a lot longer.
xmen,3d36k2,TheDroneZoneDome,2,Mon Jul 13 16:41:28 2015 UTC,You have to remember that for the X-Men movies   Comic Book Knowledge ≠ Movie Knowledge  Actually that probably goes for any Comic Book movie but especially those that aren't made by Marvel Studios. They tend to stick to comics a little bit more but they still stray. Not as far as Sony and Fox tend to do but they still stray.

He looks better (especially his face) and more like his comic book counterpart. I understand your concerns, as he is one of my favorite characters, but I think that dark shot with Storm and Mags is just a crappy shot.  Also they did say that no post effects had been done yet.

Apocalypse is supposed to be this massive towering figure who controls (maybe creates?) matter. He looks to be shorter than Storm. I get the feeling that the pure joy and hype of being at comic-con caused folks to forget this major detail. I hope Ivan Ooze Apocalypse is better on screen than the trailer would lead you to believe.

xmen,3d1fjl,Civil718,5,Sun Jul 12 21:05:28 2015 UTC,Oscar Isaac is like 5'6 I believe. Also they will add things in post.
xmen,3d1fjl,GoldandBlue,6,Sun Jul 12 23:04:02 2015 UTC,He gets to be in X-Men AND Star Wars? I'm so envious of this man.
xmen,3d1fjl,SayAllenthing,6,Mon Jul 13 13:16:38 2015 UTC,Apocalypse is a bit underwhelming in this pic but I have confidence in Bryan Singer. The early pics of Quicksilver were widely derided and he turned out to be the best part of the movie.
xmen,3d1fjl,bigbluemofo,10,Mon Jul 13 07:21:39 2015 UTC,Not feeling apocalypse. He should be more then just a painted face.
xmen,3d1fjl,TotallyNotObsi,10,Sun Jul 12 21:22:35 2015 UTC,That's probably a stand in. He'll be heavily CGI when the movie comes out.
xmen,3d1fjl,Kupy,-6,Sun Jul 12 22:10:59 2015 UTC,"Nah, you don't go through that much make-up effort for a stand-in. That guy's make-up looks like it took hours.  Also, we've already seen Apocalypse, haven't we? At the end of DoFP? He wasn't very CGI."
xmen,3d1fjl,InscrutableTed,4,Mon Jul 13 05:00:53 2015 UTC,"That was ""young"" Apocalypse. In the comics, he's continuously adding and changing his very make up with alien technology. TL;DR The Apocalypse of old is not even close to the Apocalypse of the 20th century."
xmen,3d1fjl,juiceimortal,2,Mon Jul 13 08:11:58 2015 UTC,Singer said they will be adding digital effects. They've only been shooting for about 5 weeks.

xmen,3d1fjl,IAEL-Casey,2,Sun Jul 12 23:39:04 2015 UTC,"I guess this is in keeping with his primary power being that of persuasion, which I'm not really too thrilled with. They better have something brilliant up their sleeves if they want to turn that into an epic villain worthy of the name, ""Apocalypse"". In his comic book origin, he didn't exactly ""persuade"" himself to the top."
xmen,3d1fjl,argyle47,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:19:20 2015 UTC,From the footage that has been shown now it looks like he will just simply mind control other mutants.  Eh...
xmen,3d1fjl,IAEL-Casey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:35:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with your sentiment. A villain who essentially fights through proxy hardly seems epic. What they seem to be doing with the character doesn't do the comic book character justice. He might as well be Maxwell Lord, a Justice League villain. Wonder Woman ended up killing him, but it wasn't a matter of if she could do it but, rather, should she. With comic book Apocalypse, you get the idea that it's going to be a near impossible feat to defeat him no matter what any opponent can bring to bear."

xmen,3d3tze,Kman29,5,Mon Jul 13 08:26:33 2015 UTC,Sentinels are programmed to identify the mutant gene and terminate or capture those who have it. So yes humans should be safe among them. However I'm sure the war between Mutant and Sentinel left widespread destruction changing humans' lives as well.

I'd assume that anyone left over after that is pretty anti-mutant, if only just to survive."

xmen,3czwa9,Dig-Up-The-Dead,2,Sun Jul 12 16:37:43 2015 UTC,"""Yeah, it's sort of a strange group for the Horsemen"" That's an understatement to say the least"
xmen,3czwa9,Hopeann,9,Sun Jul 12 18:55:58 2015 UTC,Hahah Magneto will once again be the main villain mark my words
xmen,3czwa9,Satanbakesale,9,Sun Jul 12 17:23:38 2015 UTC,He'll turn on Apocalypse with his own ridiculous plan by the end!
xmen,3czwa9,trumoi,7,Sun Jul 12 18:21:28 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of conflicted about Magneto as a Horseman, mainly on the basis of his stature and that making him a minion of sorts. I'm still hung up on Magneto being one of Apocalypse's main counter forces in the Age of Apocalypse mega-crossover story event."
xmen,3czwa9,argyle47,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:43:13 2015 UTC,I think that's actually an interesting twist - Apocalypse's plan (or his *power of persuasion - dafuq?) is compelling enough to make the usually arrogant and independent Magneto into a servant.
xmen,3czwa9,mvs5191,2,Sun Jul 12 21:38:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe. But from what Magneto experienced firsthand as a Jew during WWII and later what he has seen mutants go through, this flies square in the face of what he's all about. Magneto, in his totality, is about creating a world in which all mutants are free and safe. Apocalypse's ""survival of the fittest"" philosophy is a direct affront to that since it elevates some mutants above other mutants just like the Nazis elevated some humans above other humans. Magneto holds all mutants (homosuperiors) as better than homosapiens but to be equally wonderful and beautiful as their fellow mutants. That's way beyond ""persuasion"".  Edit - Super ""persuasion"" also doesn't do it for me. That's like Maxwell Lord, an enemy of the Justice League who Wonder Woman ended up killing. He's evil, yes, but not so awe-inspiring, dreadful, and ominous as to be worthy of the name, ""Apocalypse""."
xmen,3czwa9,argyle47,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:55:05 2015 UTC,Remember X-men and X2? He became what he was fighting against.
xmen,3czwa9,neoblackdragon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:27:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'm following. We're talking the movies, right? In the first movie, I thought the idea was to make a bunch of the politically powerful into mutants, and that Rogue was seen as a sacrafice towards that end. Or, are you coming from the angle that he wants to destroy humans? If it's the latter, my take was that conflict between homosapiens and homosuperiors was inevitable on the part of homosapiens' intent on waging it, and, as such, he intended ensure that mutants win. I think his goal has always been to take care of his people. Before having the personal identity of a mutant, that would have been his fellow Jews, and, it was his fellow mutants,. That's my take, any way. Maybe I'm looking from the right angle."
xmen,3czwa9,argyle47,4,Mon Jul 13 06:19:07 2015 UTC,"A bit of a weird line-up, but it makes sense I guess.  A lot of the big name X-men, like Gambit, Sunfire, and Wolverine, have been Horsemen at one time or another. The rest of the roster are usually no-name characters that no one really cares about too much anyways.  Also reminds me a bit of the X-men Evolution cartoon, where Apocalypse made Xavier, Magneto, Mystique, and Storm has horsemen."
xmen,3czwa9,not_vichyssoise,2,Mon Jul 13 02:35:10 2015 UTC,"Yep was gonna post this.  There's some basis for the other horsemen already in other adaptations.  If X-Men: Apocalypse is similar to X-men Evolution Season 4, I'd be quite happy."
xmen,3czwa9,SmilesUndSunshine,3,Mon Jul 13 23:13:13 2015 UTC,"Angel was an obvious (and good) choice. I really like the idea of Storm as a horseman; her weather controlling powers can definitely be used in some very ominous and menacing ways we've never gotten a chance to see before (and if they go with the Death/Famine/Pestilence/War motif, I think she'd make a good fit for Famine). I wasn't sure how Psylocke would fit in, but now knowing she's a horseman I'm even more excited to see how that goes. Just bummed they're not using Wolverine. It would've been the perfect opportunity to not lean heavily on him as the main hero for once, especially with all of the new talent and new characters their bringing in (plus there goes my theory of how he gets his metal back)."
xmen,3czwa9,TransPM,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:00:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the fitting irony of Storm serving as Famine! I'm actually really excited about that. I hope they don't waste that opportunity. Also similarly disappointed that Wolverine isn't a horseman; he had a whole arc of being Death in the late 90's, so it would have suited him perfectly! I would've preferred him over Magneto, I think."

xmen,3czwa9,SuckaFreeBaust,6,Sun Jul 12 18:02:11 2015 UTC,I would totally watch a 5 hour movie about the X-men fighting Apocalypse.
xmen,3czwa9,SuckaFreeBaust,2,Mon Jul 13 19:58:46 2015 UTC,"I would too, but if you think about it, that's twice as long as an average movie, meaning the amount of times a theater can show it per day will be half the times they can show a 2.5 hr movie, which equals half the revenue (unless they double the price of tickets of course)"
xmen,3czwa9,iaro,3,Mon Jul 13 21:01:49 2015 UTC,I used to work at a movie theater. We used to just get multiple prints if either a movie was really long or we knew it would do well. The older/slower movies would just be put in the smaller rooms.

xmen,3cz3k8,IamBabcock,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:24:07 2015 UTC,"honestly marvel has had a hard on for wolverine as well for a long time.  i've seen in various (other) places how if marvel had the rights they'd do it differently and not make it wolverine and friends. the thing is, the comics themselves have long been to a certain degree ""wolverine and friends"" basically.  personally i think he's one of the few xmen characters that works well at all going solo, in both print and on the screen. xmen generally speaking is all about the adoptive family bonds of these characters and living and fighting together and against each other. sure there might be solid miniseries focusing on a particular member of the xmen on a regular basis, but these often feature said character with other characters in sometimes novel ways both teamed up and otherwise, far more than maybe a wolverine series might."

It's just too 'out there.' Guardians of the Galaxy worked because it's ""something new"" and didn't have an established franchise/fanbase from which it would be departing from.  I just watched the Phoenix arc in Wolverine and The X-Men today and I could totally see something like that being adapted. It's a lot more feasible than introducing aliens and a whole cosmic arc and is, for lack of a better term, more ""realistic."""
xmen,3d0eh8,shewhoclicksmouse,2,Sun Jul 12 21:34:51 2015 UTC,Pretty high I would say. Heres my evidence : (mught have to squint to see it haha) In the comic con trailer when apocalypse said rise up from the ashes it cut to jean. That's so totally a hint of phoenix.

It'd be cool if her potential was slightly hinted at though.  edit: not to say we'll never see the Phoenix arc on the big screen. It'll just have to be, I think, a few movies down the line or a whole reboot. Something like that really needs the proper setup."

xmen,3czt5h,theoceangrewquickly,8,Sun Jul 12 07:21:53 2015 UTC,"(Sorry for being late here.) It's tough to know for sure in the XCU what the reasoning will be for Apocalypse's prior absence in the ""bad future"" or a lack of mention if he ever existed at all in the original timeline. Having said that, a few conclusions can be drawn from the source material (comics) that could help explain it and may even be used to some extent in the movies.    I'm calling on some pretty old info here, so please correct me if I remember anything incorrectly.     In the comics, Apocalypse has been a major player in Earth's history since the days of ancient Egypt. He's been known by many names and is referenced in many legends and myths. When he feels like bowing out for a while, he uses a form of suspended animation to basically leapfrog forward in time. His most devoted followers keep tabs on things during these times.    During his most recent ""sleep"", he was awoken about a century ahead of schedule by Cable. Cable had traveled time to stop Stryfe and also (in a hilarious twist of irony) to try to prevent Apocalypse being awakened in the future so he wouldn't rise to power.    This is where things get a bit complicated because the actual cause of his awakening is believed to be the energy he felt from Cable,  not the time travel itself. There are good reasons why this would disturb him, but I don't want to ruin too much of a rather good story arch.    So where does that leave us? Well, we know an X-Force movie is in the works, but it is too far away to have any meaning on X-men: Apocalypse. They don't currently have Cable cast in Apocalypse, so it's unlikely we will see him as the cause in this case. What seems like a pretty good bet is that they would capitalize on the whole ""time traveling"" element from DoFP. I'm using ""time traveling"" very loosely there. Simply put, it could be Kitty's manipulation of time that awakens Apocalypse in the XCU. As to what exactly disturbs him is a whole other matter. It could be her meddling with time. It could be how far back she sent Wolverine. It could even be how significantly the timeline is altered. Of course,  it could be some other time traveling shenanigans that we haven't learned of yet or it could have nothing to do with time travel at all. It would just seem like such a waste of plot development if they didn't incorporate it in some way.    It should also be mentioned that the ending of DoFP confirms that Kitty is alive in the new timeline, so it's still possible that she can meddle with time if they wanna shake it up.    As for why Apocalypse didn't have a role in the bad future?... Well, I have no great ideas about that. They probably won't even try to address it in any way. A few quick ideas that may work (don't kill me for these); 1) Apocalypse was still sleeping, undisturbed, during the bad future. Not sure how Ozy or anybody else managed to let him sleep through it though. 2.) Apocalypse let the purge take place to thin out the weak mutants and leave only the strongest. He could have been waiting until the humans were weakest (full of hubris and having destroyed any alliance with the mutants) to band the mutants together and annihilate humanity. 3.) He could have been disposed of while slumbering during the purge. I say disposed of because he is immortal and it doesn't seem to be possible to kill him. The sentinels could have detected him. His existence would certainly raise some questions. In an attempt to avoid an incident,  it may have been deemed best to simply ensure he remains slumbering or is sent far away, quickly. 4.) Maybe the ripples of time echoed both forwards and backwards when Kitty intervened. Yeah, I'll say it, maybe Apocalypse never existed until Kitty played around with time. There are some other Marvel heavy hitters that played a role early on in Apocalypse becoming who he is now. In particular,  Kang. It's possible that Kitty's actions caused a chain of events that also went further back in time and resulted in Apocalypse either coming into existence or simply ensuring that he survived until his immortality kicked in. Maybe by changing the past, she ensured that someone would live who would later lead to the development of the technology required for Kang to travel back in time and kill Baal which causes us to get this version of Apocalypse instead of some other nice version of En Sabah Nur. It's not likely, knowing Baal, but it's possible. Heck, this could even make a nice tie in with the Fantastic Four since we could throw Kang in the mix and we all know that Fox isn't ready to play nice with MCU yet. At least we could get some X-men/F4 crossover action down the road.   Take all of this with a grain of salt. It's all just me having a bit of fun. Sorry for the long post."

You had a good question that I don't hear a ton of people asking yet, which is surprising considering it seems like such an obvious question. It was a lot of fun actually letting my mind play around with the ideas for a while, so thanks for asking. Here's to hoping the movie will be better than any silly ideas I can come up with."
xmen,3czt5h,Vinnie_Vegas,3,Sun Jul 12 13:21:01 2015 UTC,"Apocalypse is as far beyond mutants as mutants are beyond humans, or so he claims - He doesn't seem to really follow any understandable motivations from our perspective, and comes and goes throughout the X-Men's timeline on his own whims, to some extent."
xmen,3czt5h,one2gaming,2,Sun Jul 12 11:04:14 2015 UTC,"It is possible (probable) that Apocalypse was a threat the X-men dealt with 2 decades before X-men 1 happened.  Now that the time is altered, the way the threat is dealt with is entirely different.  But Apocalypse is a genius time traveling weirdo if the writers want him to be so who knows what crazy logic could come into play in the actual movie. However, I would assume they won't address this question very much."
xmen,3czt5h,Robyrt,2,Sun Jul 12 07:46:10 2015 UTC,"In the comics continuity, Apocalypse was awakened a hundred years ahead of schedule by Cable, time-traveling son of Cyclops. In the Days of Future Past ""bad future"", Cyclops had a daughter, Rachel, instead of a son, so Apocalypse is presumably still asleep.  In the movies, I have no idea. Maybe he was killed by Sentinels?"
xmen,3czt5h,Wygar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:15:40 2015 UTC,Apocalypse believes in survival of the fittest.  If the humans beat mutants he doesn't care so long as the strongest live on.   He could even view the humans as a tool to weed out weak mutants thus helping his cause.

Look at it this way, in the start of the story he needs bed rest to recover from ONE punch by one of the redneck Hulks (who were significantly weaker than the real Hulk) and by the end he's healing from getting riddled with bullets and cutting his way out of the Hulk's stomach after being in there for a day."
xmen,3czrch,WeaponX33,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:41:46 2015 UTC,"They mention a few times in Wolverine's comics that he ages just like everyone else, but a lot slower. I think he's just realllllly old in OML."
xmen,3czrch,Thunderstarter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:12:39 2015 UTC,"I figure the new timeline ending was in 2023. He had gray hair just like in the 2023 beginning, and Storm didn't look old. When he wakes up, I imagine his mind was flung back to neo 2023, not knowing what shifted, but due to destiny being kind of set, his 70s body itself aged and got adamantium and joined the X Men and went on business as usual until the mind was replaced overnight by 70s Logan's mind.  This makes more sense for the ending, remember no X Man was shocked by him being there. Xavier pretty much says get to class, dummy, then remembers the 70s junk and says snap, reads Logan's brain and puts two and two together. Then says let's catch you up.  On this new timeline Apocalypse already happened, Storm was a Horseman, Wade gets powers but differently, etc. But Logan in these films will by nature be erased by time travel in 2023 when 70s Logan takes over the body.  OML can still be twenty years away in 2043, after he kills his teammates (Maybe Apocalypse uses his sweet talk powers on Logan instead of Mysterio after he comes back, etc."

xmen,3czy5u,namobot,2,Sun Jul 12 08:43:25 2015 UTC,"If you want to jump right into the action, I'd recommend Messiah Complex, it's a really great crossover, leads into several cool new directions for the x-books and is full of great team moments. It may be a little bit hard to understand but all you really need to know is that there haven't been any mutants in a long time but finally a new mutant baby has been born, leading to every mutant in the world fighting to get the baby.   A slightly less action-filled but darker place to start would be with Grant Morrison's New X-Men, it features a lot of very familiar characters you'll know from the movies and is a more grounded, serious look with leather jackets. The omnibus is linked in the sidebar but you can buy individual volumes if you don't want to invest that much.   Marvel Unlimited is also a great place to read comics with a huge back catalogue for a set fee a month, like Netflix, they have a promotion where you can buy a month for a penny at the moment so you might want to take a look at that before you buy anything."
xmen,3czy5u,RaoulSeagull,2,Sun Jul 12 12:15:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. I was leaning towards New X-men, and days of futures past.

I also prefer hardcopies, of all of my reading material. Nothing is more satisfying then turning a page on a cliffhanger.   Question for you, what is your personal favorite series?"
xmen,3czy5u,RaoulSeagull,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:25:29 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of Peter David's X-Factor Investigations, it's kind of a noir detective drama starring Multiple Man and a load of obscure mutants, really well written and a lot of fun."
xmen,3czy5u,VolatileCurry,2,Sun Jul 12 14:02:24 2015 UTC,"I would say start with Morrison's New X-Men. I recommend the omnibus linked to in the sidebar. I bought that one a while back and it was very worth the investment. It follows a smaller team of core characters and it's easy to follow.   Some people are going to recommend a lot of crossover books like House of M or Messiah Complex. While those are great reads as well, I felt read those as I was first getting into the comics and they were tough for me to follow. Too many different series and teams were coming together and it was just disorienting to a new reader. I strongly recommend those books, but I wouldn't start with them.   Read Messiah Complex after New X-Men (and Whedon's run on Astonishing X-Men in between). From there, you can kind of read whatever you want and you shouldn't feel too lost."

The extra scenes were mostly useless dialogue that wasn't needed and romance that seemed forced just for the sake of having romance in the movie. That scene with beast/raven was terrible. Sure it's cool to see rogue and all but the whole breakout scene was so rushed and in the long run completely irrelevant.  Generally if things are cut from a movie it's for good reason, and I feel these were cuts that were needed and the rogue cut was just a cash grab of throwing useless 17 minutes of footage and using rogues minor appearance to bait us."
xmen,3cs9zt,TheRedditPizzaGuy,3,Fri Jul 10 11:50:23 2015 UTC,"Kinsberg discussed why Rogue was cut from the film. He talked about she was really unnecessary and her contribution really took away from the sense of urgency as the film was reaching it's climax.            The Rogue Cut was exactly that, a cash grab. That is what was so frustrating for me seeing so many people gush about it when it was announced."
xmen,3cs9zt,GoldandBlue,4,Fri Jul 10 21:08:46 2015 UTC,"I think it gave old Magneto more to do. While watching original cut i felt something was missing from his character, he didnt talk much had nothing much to do. but in rogue cut it seemed he had this side plot of breaking out rogue."
xmen,3cs9zt,TheRedditPizzaGuy,4,Fri Jul 10 17:01:36 2015 UTC,More magneto was nice but at the same time I hated that scene because instead of magneto holding back the sentinels with ease ( they were essentially in a giant block of metal ) you had bobby slightly slow them and we saw how that worked out. It's like they used a BB gun when they had a nuke available.
xmen,3cs9zt,TheRedditPizzaGuy,5,Fri Jul 10 17:09:09 2015 UTC,the metal used in future's sentinels is not affected by magneto's ability.
xmen,3cs9zt,amramahi,8,Fri Jul 10 17:23:50 2015 UTC,"No no I'm saying the rescue took place Xavier's school, specifically the basement which is a giant metal base. They got in so easy because magneto could just push down walls but when the sentinels show up he doesn't even attempt to use his powers. I feel magneto with that much metal around him should have stomped on the chasing sentinels without even breaking a sweat."
xmen,3cs9zt,amramahi,3,Fri Jul 10 17:30:12 2015 UTC,"I agree. It would have made more sense for Magneto to stay behind while Iceman and Rogue escape to the ship. Magneto could have shown us how powerful and intelligent he is by defeating them with the surrounding metal, or he could have died a hero trying to save them, which would effectively save Mutants from the future that his character almost caused in the first place. With that being said though, I did enjoy his and Professor X's last moment together."
xmen,3cs9zt,CleverZerg,3,Fri Jul 10 18:40:40 2015 UTC,"I think I prefer the original. The Rogue Cut was definitely a neat take, but it seemed kind of pointless. I mean, Bobby, Professor X and Magneto travel all the way to China and back to get Rogue since Kitty is injured, but then Rogue is only used for like ten minutes and pretty much only says ""Hi Logan"". I feel like Kitty could have made all the way through in that period of time. I did like how they explained how the Sentinels were able to find them in China though. I also like the idea of them experimenting on Rogue because it makes sense. Overall though, I think the original is good enough."

(http://brevoortformspring.tumblr.com/, which is an excellent window into what Marvel is thinking in general) The stories are already in a place where you have to extend Magneto's lifespan and or count the times he's been de-aged in order to get his WWII backstory to make sense, but that's an incomplete solution. If you want to preserve his history as a contemporary of Charles Xavier, that means you have to pin Xavier back to that era as well. At some point, his history with Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver means that if you want to keep that connection in place, those characters have to be either super old or artificially prolonged or de-aged.  At some point, you have to decide which bonds are the least painful to break, unless you want almost every character stuck pinned to a point in the past. (And that's before you start dealing with characters who have important life events pinned to other real-world events, like Punisher.)  I feel like the direction they're moving in is keeping Magneto's WWII backstory and just using a variety of methods to keep him somehow still alive, and letting his connections to other characters that that causes problems with (like being the same age as Xavier or plausibly being the parent of the Maximoffs) be the things that go away. But there's no perfect solution."

The Holocaust speaks to everyone because it is a shared event. You cannot go to school in the Western Hemisphere without learning about and being surrounded by popular media about the Holocaust. Since everyone has seen those pictures of bodies and ovens and survivors, we all understand how something so horrible could warp a child. The Holocaust is a film screen that shows scary images and lets you project the worst that you can imagine onto it as well.  Taking the Holocaust away from his character would be a horrible decision. It will happen and the same people who think that it's silly for superheroes to wear synthetic fabric, but that it makes a ton of sense for them to wear leather will call it innovative."

Without the Holocaust backdrop, it still wasn't too difficult to portray Magneto feeling towards anti-mutant persecution parallel to that which he experienced as a Jew during WWII. They did it in ""God Loves, Man Kills"". In 30 years time, the X-Men will probably have gone through at least one reboot, especially considering what's being done to the property as a result of Fox retaining the movie rights, so when that happens, Marvel can remove the Holocaust experience as a part of Magneto's origin."

xmen,3cq5da,vagabondhermit,7,Fri Jul 10 00:09:07 2015 UTC,"I think it fits. Some scenes added a bit more depth. Like for example I didn't realize that Bobby and Kitty were supposed to be in a relationship in original release, in this release it is quite apparent and I actually kinda like two of them together, so when in the end (in new timeline) Bobby ends up with Rogue, it makes you realize that things really are different from the original timeline and these are the consequences of changing the past.   Some stories I would want to be developed further. Especially Rogue being experimented on in Cerebro, I don't understand what's the deal with that. Was she there all those years? Why did they experimented on her there? It doesn't make much sense like this.   I'm not sure if it's worth buying the film again for 10 minutes of added scenes. I liked it, none of the scenes slowed down the pacing, it was a nice fit but it's nothing groundbreaking. Honestly, I think this should be the original cut of the movie."

xmen,3cqj9n,onewithgreen,4,Thu Jul 9 23:40:45 2015 UTC,"I did not like your formatting. So I did this for you:    TL:DR  - Choosing a character to be the Brotherhood's Pawn in an X-Men chess set  I have picked out the roster for both the X-Men and the Brotherhood teams, except for the Brotherhoods Pawn. The reason I am making one instead of just buying one is cause I have never felt satisfied with the sets that are out there. For example sets that have characters like Colossus playing both knight positions. The X-men have enough of a cast to put a different character in each position, and thematically a character like Colossus should be a Rook.  I'm making the board and base for the pieces on my own, but I'm using Heroclix for the characters:   King - Professor X / Magneto Queen - Jean Grey / Mystique Bishop 1 -Wolverine / Quicksilver Bishop 2 - Cyclops / Scarlet Witch Knight 1 -Nightcrawler / Pyro Knight 2 - Storm / Toad Rook 1 - Rogue / Avalanche Rook 2  - Colossus / Blob Pawn - Multiple Man / ???   I want to use Mastermind for the Brotherhoods pawn since he could create illusions of himself, but I don't like how Mastermind's Heroclix looks. I would prefer if he looked like he did in Ultimate X-men; a classy old man with a trench coat and shades. Could someone suggest a Heroclix that matches this description that I could use? Or a different Brotherhood member that would thematically fit the position? Thanks a bunch!"
xmen,3cqj9n,Raeman91,2,Fri Jul 10 10:01:36 2015 UTC,Maybe do old Toad as pawn and Mastermind as Knight since Mastermind was really useful then and Toad got ditched by Magneto on another planet.  Edit: Also Storm could be be bishop 1 since Cyclops and Storm are the team leaders and Wolverine could be Rook 1 and Rogue could move up to knight since she can fly (jumping over pieces)

xmen,3cp3e5,Nightender,5,Fri Jul 10 06:21:51 2015 UTC,The last incarnation of Gambit was so forgettable I can't even remember what movie he was in. X3? Wolverine Origin?

xmen,3cp3e5,ElvishLlama,2,Fri Jul 10 12:46:14 2015 UTC,"This might be an unpopular opinion, but he wasn't a bad Gambit.  It was just everything around the character I hated.  That he wore that hat, that it took place in the time before the x-men, that he was basically there for no reason other than to finally put the character in the movies continuity.  But he played the character well."

It certainly would not cut the damn thing in half.
xmen,3cowpb,Irahs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:43:41 2015 UTC,"Thats how big they were in the game, go play it. theyre as big as they were. Did you not play it? It would defeat the purpose to take a screenshot and rasterize it... Wolverine DID cut them in half in game, and colossus DID headlock them. Of course it was weird to me that sentinels were as big as they were, but thats just how it was!  Also that wa snot my intention, thanks for showing me that is what you think!  See?

Torres is capable of being the strong silent type with ease, but also delivers lines with such poise.  Whereas as Berry (at her best) can play coy.

xmen,3cnj0y,Black_Belt_Troy,59,Thu Jul 9 18:25:33 2015 UTC,"Storm, the character, could have an insanely awesome stand-alone movie. The powers scenes alone would be cinematic experiences. Halle playing Storm in that movie however...."
xmen,3cnj0y,mc8755,25,Thu Jul 9 10:12:59 2015 UTC,She's really bad for the role. I've always thought that
xmen,3cnj0y,1paperwings1,13,Thu Jul 9 13:38:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I love Storm, but Halle Berry has never been able to convey the depth, confidence and inner strength of the character."

xmen,3cnj0y,EVula,3,Thu Jul 9 18:19:36 2015 UTC,"I agree, but the lack of consistency kills me in those movies. Same goes with Mystiques voice. First movies had a cool effect that sounded like multiple pitches going on at the same time, which worked well since she was a shape shifter, then they just dropped the ball in later films. That shit drives me nuts."
xmen,3cnj0y,Fiend1138,3,Thu Jul 9 18:26:28 2015 UTC,"I agree, although some blame has to fall to how the character is written in the movie universe too. Thanks to DOFP's total reset of the timeline and a younger version being introduced, they have the chance to badass-up Storm... I hope they take it."
xmen,3cnj0y,mc8755,5,Thu Jul 9 14:48:05 2015 UTC,"I would actually totally watch this. No sarcasm tag! With the right script and some amazing weather scenes this could be a solid movie. Nothing Avengers-level obviously, but it could be enjoyable. She gets a lot of shit for this role, but she's also never really given the chance to show character development. There are some scenes in X2 where she is actually able to show more of Storm's personality (like with Nightcrawler), and she was totally badass on DoFP, if not the most important character. Just give her long hair and throw her up in the sky naked. Now that's Storm."

I don't think the script or the director did her justice, but a solo movie might give her more opportunity to shine. Halle's not a terrible actress :( just give her a director who actually cares about her, and making a movie that isn't all Wolverine all the time."
xmen,3cnj0y,sunflowering,3,Thu Jul 9 22:37:04 2015 UTC,She's a terrible actress and completely dead in this role. If anything hire someone new.

If there was some agreement to get the character in maybe the 'Black Panther' movie then I think there would be a definite interest in Storm appearing in a non-X-Men movie at least. Highly doubt that agreement would happen though...
xmen,3cnj0y,tonybyatt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:27:13 2015 UTC,"For black women, Storm is pretty much our version of Wonder Woman. There's plenty of demand for a Storm movie where she's more than just the Black Panther's love interest. But there's probably not much demand for a Storm movie starring Halle Berry..."

I was just pointing out that Storm is also  the only iconic black super heroine. So from a marketing standpoint, I think it would make sense to make a Storm movie. The average moviegoer might not be interested in an endless series of origin movies for the all of the various x-men, but the average black woman would love to see a superhero movie starring someone who is also black and female."

A lot of people do feel the need to identify with the characters they're watching, and Storm would be a great one to get otherwise uninterested people in to these films. I can only speak for myself, but I don't really feel the need to identify with a character to enjoy them. Just because I can't say ""oh hey, Storm is just like me"" doesn't mean that I can't learn about, understand, and enjoy the character and the culture she represents.   TL;DR: STORM RULES! ⚡️⚡️⚡️"

Not to mention the amount of teamwork involved in their battles was awesome to see. Ask most X-Men fans and they can tell you their favorite hero and team run. At times you're drawn more to their personal stories than their heroics in the field.   But unlike other superhero teams who at times have family-like bonds (The Avengers or Fantastic Four), most X-Men consider their teammates family. The X-Men/Xavier gave them safe haven when their powers manifested. Yes, relationships run deep and it can be taxing trying to keep up with all of them. At times you're frustrated by characters who continue to do the same shit, over and over.   I guess the short answer is that I still love the idea that this group was born with their superpowers. There wasn't a freak accident, supernatural, or any kind of magic involved. That's what made them extraordinary when I was introduced to them."
xmen,3clv5z,DestronTheDSTRYR,2,Thu Jul 9 01:16:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that actually gave me more interest. If I were to start now, what would be the best run to begin with?"

xmen,3clv5z,Robyrt,3,Thu Jul 9 05:15:10 2015 UTC,"So, I was considering starting to read X-Men but a friend of mine told me that it has no continuity whatsoever and that from times to times the writers just say ""fuck it"" and make something completely senseless to introduce some action or something new on the story.   If anything, X-Men has the opposite problem: it has so much continuity that there are places where it gets a little swamped in it and there are books and eras that are hard to follow completely if you're not reasonably well steeped in things that have come before. It's not like Batman, which gets completely rebooted with such frequency that there are lots of places where you can jump in and very little happens that ever has permanent consequences. (Batman has probably more truly great stories than any other character in comics (at least English-language comics - I'm not familiar enough with manga and a lot of European stuff to make comparisons), but they're not deeply enmeshed in a labyrinthine continuity. In fact, many of the Batman greats are stories that re-imagine the character largely from the ground up.)  As far as introducing things to keep the action moving goes, if you're not into that, you're going to have a very hard time with superhero comics in general, and I wouldn't call X-Men's use of that strategy ever more ""completely senseless"" than anything else.  What draws me to X-Men is that it's (on the whole) fundamentally about people and relationships between people, to such a degree that it's sometimes half-jokingly referred to as a soap opera. That's not to say that there aren't X-Men stories where something bad is going to happen and the X-Men have to be awesome enough to stop it, but even when that happens it usually happens against a backdrop of unfolding character relationships. Nobody important in X-Men gets to get away with being a shallowly-characterized nothing character. (Except Psylocke for some reason. That's not to say that there aren't any good Psylocke stories, but she tends to be much less completely drawn than anybody else.) ""The characters are actually characters instead of just powersets with faces"" is something that the series has been on the front lines of since its relaunch in Giant-Size X-Men #1, and I think it's helped push the genre forward in that regard. (Even as a huge X-Fan, I'm not going to rush to defend the pre-Giant-Size era. It's not abysmal, but it's among the least of the X-Men stuff, and also among the least of the stuff that its creators produced."
xmen,3clv5z,L00KA,3,Thu Jul 9 02:14:53 2015 UTC,"I really love series that focus on the characters and their relationships and giving them an interesting profile. That's pretty much the main reason I'm considering reading X-Men. But, where should I start? I want to catch up with the recent events of the universe, but at the same time I want to have a decent understanding of the characters background, so it's being a bit hard to find a mid ground."
xmen,3clv5z,rillip,2,Thu Jul 9 03:10:22 2015 UTC,"The Avengers Vs X-men crossover (AvX) in 2012 is probably the best recent place to pick up. At least in my opinion. Read the event comic, then pick up the Marvel Now X-books that followed. You'll have about 3 years of continuity to read before you get to today.  Either that or just dive into any x-book that looks fun and use Wikipedia to help understand references you don't get.   For the most part ""Uncanny X-Men"" and/or just ""X-Men"" are usually the central books of the X-universe.   ""X-Factor"", ""X-Force"", ""New Mutants"", and any other X-books that you come across are typically the spinoffs of the main story featuring less popular, but sometimes more fun, characters.    It's really hard to go wrong and you'll learn the universe as you go. The most important thing is to have fun reading the comics."

xmen,3clv5z,L00KA,2,Thu Jul 9 04:32:15 2015 UTC,"Quick guide to catching up:   The '60s and '90s can largely be ignored. Read the wiki page on Age of Apocalypse and you're good. The most important classic material from the '80s can be found in the Proteus, Dark Phoenix, and Days of Future Past TPBs. Chris Claremont wrote everything X-related for over a decade, but later writers tend to refer to this period the most. The only thing of note in the early '00s is Grant Morrison's New X-Men and its spiritual sequel, Joss Whedon's Astonishing X- Men. After 2005, it gets more complicated, but that should tide you over for quite a while already :)"

There's no way I can follow the entire Marvel or DC universe, but the X-men universe (for lack of a better term) is just big enough for me to handle. There's a lot of X-stuff but not an impossible amount of X-stuff. There's almost always at least one or two really good X-books being published at any given time. Never been a bad time (in my opinion) to be an X-man fan.  Character diversity! The X-universe is so packed with awesome characters from mainstays like Cyclops, Storm, and Wolverine, to the odd fan favorites like Quinten Quire, Broo, Caliban, or Strong Guy. I don't care who you are, there is an X-man character you will love somewhere.  I know the whole mutants are an analogy for minorities thing is done over and over, but it still appeals to me on some base level. I love underdog stories and the X-men are the Marvel universes premier underdog team."

From the Ashes (Claremont/Smith) - This is the early '80s team in top form, with an artist that really fits. The ""Wolverine and Rogue in Japan"" two-parter is one of the best issues of all time. Asgardian Wars (Claremont et al.) - A nice, self-contained story that answers the question, ""What if the alternate dimension we visit this week was actually better than back home and we wanted to stay?"" X-Force: Angels and Demons (Kyle, Yost, Crain et al.) - This whole run of X-Force is pretty good, but the opening arc is the best.

I'm currently waist-deep in the 90s (circa 1994) and it has gotten to be a bit of a slog.  The main problem is that there are so many different series running simultaneously (8 I think) that I may end up dropping some. There are actually a lot of great comics coming out around this time, but a lot of bad ones too.  If you are a Kitty Pryde fan I definitely recommend reading Excalibur once it starts if you can.

I read ALL X-Men related titles, all crossovers, all alternate timeline stuff.   New Mutants was my favorite to read. And Peter David's X-Factor. Jamie Madrox for Prez!!"

Early 90s?), but I'm also really enjoying the even slight difference in style between the main Uncanny series and New Mutants, not to mention the Wolverine and Magik miniseries.

So far, I've read, in the last five months, from the first appearance, up to Atlantis Attacks, some time in the early nineties.

xmen,3cg1cv,culofiesta,2,Wed Jul 8 02:15:15 2015 UTC,"Excellent! You've still got a few years left of coherent, non-overlapping plots between X-Men, New Mutants and X-Factor, before it gets really confusing.  Basically, the next few years are Claremont slowly trying out more hard-edged characters and more decompressed storylines, starting with Rachel Summers and eventually putting together a whole new team (with Psylocke, Gambit, Havok, etc.) that would be labeled ""X-Force"" these days. Meanwhile, New Mutants does its teen drama thing; X-Factor does soap opera with overcomplicated plots and Cyclops, basically what we would now call ""X-Men""; and Excalibur does the goofy, lighthearted sci-fi. It all culminates in the ""Inferno"" crossover that wraps up all the hanging plot lines, breaks down the walls between the cast, and basically leaves the creative team unsure what they should even be doing with 3 different X-Men books anymore."

It'd be a bit of a backtrack for me at this point, but it seems like a lot of things happened in that series regarding Rogue and Captain Marvel.   I'm just now at the point in the main series where Rogue shows up and inexplicably becomes part of the team, like, immediately. I will say I was surprised at how fully formed she is right off the bat, considering she was sort of a B-list villain under Magneto. But once she shows up in Uncanny and has Captain Marvel's powers, she's kind of awesome."

To be honest I don't recall them ever saying that he travels to another dimension in the comics.  They probably did at some point. Nightcrawler and Magiks abilities are similar in that they are both mutant abilities.  Other than that there isn't much in common.  Nightcrawlers teleport is basically instantaneous, requires line of sight, and he must be in contact with anyone he wants to transport.  Magik's works by transporting her or another to and from Limbo.  She does not need to have line of sight or seemingly any knowledge of the area she wants to transport to.  She just needs to know where she wants to go.  She can also move through time as well as space when she transports."

He's a great leader and a really well developed character, but he is usually cast as the authority figure and straight man, which is never the popular character in a line up. The reason I love Cyclops, however, is his willingness to be unpopular for the greater good.   I also love how he makes mistakes and deals with the consequences. He isn't always a perfect or inspiring leader like Captain America, and he doesn't have all the answers like Mr. Fantastic, but he takes his role seriously and always gets back up after a fall.   Also his recent turn over the last few years has been amazing to read! Just saying."

People give him shit for how he did Charlie in AvX, but he was jacked up on the same exact weird destruction god-force that possessed Jean multiple times, and people seem to forget that Wolverine had recently been possessed by demons and almost murdered all of his loved ones while his soul was in hell because he had killed so many people that a weird suicide cult formed with no goal other than to shit on his life, make him kill his illegitimate kids with terrible taste in superhero personas, and then kill themselves because he destroyed all of their lives that horribly in the past. Then he drowned the one kid he did know he had who reformed the Brotherhood specifically because he felt unloved and ignored (which is admittedly kinda his own fault for being basically the worst person on the planet but still). All of the mutants are extremely fucked up on levels that make Peter Parker look like the king of having a healthy social life, but for some reason everyone always dumps it all on Scott.

I liked the ones you mentioned as well as E is for Extinction because I love the original series and a lot of crazy stuff happens. X-tinction Agenda is also a really solid X book with a lot of the characters. The first issue of War Journal has a really cool X-Men story set in ancient Egypt world, I suggest checking it out."
xmen,3ca891,bdez90,2,Mon Jul 6 10:48:03 2015 UTC,"I've heard E is for Extinction is good for people who liked Morrison's New X-Men? It was okay, but not a favorite, so  I was a bit hesitant about following it lol. While I hear good things about Secret War Journal(?) and might try to hunt it down, I haven't heard anything about X-tinction Agenda! what's it about?"
xmen,3ca891,Awesome_Bobsome,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:29:03 2015 UTC,"Secret Wars Journal seems to be a bit of random smaller stories. I've liked both issues. X-Tinction agenda is based off of Havok and Rahne staying in Genosha post crossover, but then they get quarantined with a mutant plague, and no help from anyone. Here's the Marvel synopsis:   Ten years since the fall of Cameron Hodge and his fascist regime. Ten years that Havok and Wolfsbane have labored to rebuild Genosha. But their work may be for naught, as a plague has spread across their nation, infecting mutants and threatening their race with extinction. With the country quarantined and seemingly abandoned by the rest of the world, including the X-Men, old friends may become new enemies as Genosha's rulers fight to save their people! Experience an alternate future fueled by the events of the landmark first X-Crossover of 1990, X-Tinction Agenda!     That's where the 1st issue starts."
xmen,3ca891,bdez90,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:46:36 2015 UTC,Yeah its basically Havok leads a team to confront the rest of the X-Men and get some help for the plague because the world basically says they're on their own.

xmen,3ca891,pixelvspixel,2,Mon Jul 6 13:46:07 2015 UTC,Old Man Logan and Inferno have been mentioned to me a lot so I guess they're worth looking into!

I, and my wallet, will be so happy when this ends and I can go back to 10 or so books with Extraordinary X-Men leading my excitement.   X-Men '92 was way better than I expected, and I really enjoyed int. YOFP is OK. I did not care for E is for Extinction at all. Inferno is my favorite by far. Giant size little marvel AVX is fun too. X-Tinction Agenda is interesting.    Deadpool's secret secret wars is awesome. Old Man Logan is keeping me intersted as well. I hadn't read the original runaways, so this ones all new to me.   Of all the books so far, Inferno, Weirdworld and Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows are probably my top 3, outside of the main story.  Edit: I agree that CSI: Thors is a fun read."

Inferno looks fun but I'm kind of eh on Maddie Pryor on principle. But maybe I'll look into it! Little Marvel is adorable and good for a fun read, I can't believe I forgot to mention it haha. I'm still on the fence about XTinction Agenda!   Also I've heard really good things about Old Man Logan, but I'm not a fan of how his story feels ""edgy and grimdark for the sake of being edgy and grimdark"" so I don't know if I'll look into it... but since he'll be in Extraordinary X-Men I guess I might have to...? Eh.."
xmen,3ca891,jedispyder,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:23:30 2015 UTC,"OML isn't tooooo grimdark edgy. It feels more like a dirty detective western to me. But yeah, it's a lot of cash T_T.

xmen,3ca891,tsold,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:31:27 2015 UTC,"I've gotten a lot of the titles too but not all so I feel you on the wallet stress. The original OML is one of my favorite things ever. I think the new stuff is pretty good and they take him to a fitting place for how violent the book was (Age of Apocalypse) but I'm kind of bummed that the universe is being left behind and we'll never see a true continuation of the story. Regardless, OML is here to stay so if you plan on following X-Men post SW I would keep on eye on him."
xmen,3c6ys3,swtchbak,6,Sun Jul 5 13:10:18 2015 UTC,"That is a great guide for jumping in on any certain point in time.   I purchased all of these to get from where you stopped to the Marvel Now! stuff. I would also recommend Rick Remender's run on Uncanny X-Force because a lot of what happened there is SUPER important later.  Another reading guide is one that's easy to follow and goes chronologically is Crushing Krisis' guide which is one of my personal favs. I've been following this one and I've never walked into the next comic w/out knowing what was happening already.   Another shady way to get back into it is to find a torrent of all the X-Men comics and simply copy their reading order as they tend to do  it issue by issue which is very cool but super illegal if you're dl'ing the torrent. This is an example of the kind of listing/reading order a torrent will give you. That's for the storyline ""Mutant Massacre"" and is one of many storylines outlined in the torrents.   Pick what you like, it all depends on how much you wanna know really. Do you want the basics(my graphic novels + Uncanny X-Force), do you want the major plot points(Crushing Krisis' guide), or do you wanna know the full damn story and how it affected everybody ever(torrent listing). Up to you!"
xmen,3c6ys3,Frearthandox,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:53:26 2015 UTC,"First off... SUPER jealous of your collection that is impressive as hell.    That Uncanny x-force omni is hella expensive, I noticed you didn't have it in your pictures so do those trades it or is that more supplemental reading that you're suggesting?   Thanks for guides, I'll definitely take a looking at it.  I'm a long time comic fan who was forced to stop because physical comics were kind of hard to come by in my area.  I'm picking up the slack now and suffering (read: nerdgasming out) over the decade or so worth of comics I get to read now.      I know you weren't advocating it, but not sure how I feel about torrenting tbh.   Someone suggested Marvel unlimited so I might go that way if I'm going digital but I LOVE the feel of comics in my hands.    Either way if I'm reading I'm all so I guess the best bet would be to start grabbing.   ugh."
xmen,3c6ys3,Frearthandox,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:56:52 2015 UTC,"I also nerdgasmed about how much I had missed out on and how much I got to read up on. :D It's still hard to get actual comics in your hands. Most of what I have(the pic is just what I used to get caught up to the Marvel Now! stuff) is the trade paperback(tpb) stuff.   I wouldn't recommend getting the omnibus because as you said, it's hella expensive. I have the series in tpb's and I think it splits out into 5 or 6 of em. I'll make a wishlist of em later.   It is DEFINITELY cheaper to get Marvel Unlimited. I used to pay for the plus version of it but didn't see the point as it wasn't worth the extra cash year round but paying what I think is $60 a year for something like 14,000 comics is absurdly awesome, I highly recommend it but it comes with a warning label. There are missing issues and gaps in storylines and some series aren't in there at all. If you're using Crushing Krisis' guide you'll find yourself saying ""Well I guess I'll just have to skip that part"" because it's not on MU.   One thing I would say is be patient when picking up tpb's. Find your local stores and see if they're having a sale soon or if they offer a discount on old tpb's. I don't have the luxury of nearby comic shops and the ones that are nearby sell old tpb's at sticker price(usually $20 a pop). One shop had a sale where since they had been open for 22 years, everything was 22% off. I spent around $400 that day. Buying everything in tpb's will be expensive. If you can't find a shop with a sale, Amazon is your best bet as older tpb's are usually around $13-$16 + shipping.   TL;DR Get Marvel Unlimited, look for local comic sales/prices, if all else fails Amazon  Edit: Holy Hell Marvel Unlimited must be killing the tpb scene. Some of the older tpb's are less than $3($4 shipping but still). Here is an Amazon Wishlist containing the tpb's of Uncanny X-Force. The 1-7 that are on there is what I have and what I have purchased, the Complete Collections are new(to me) and have more than just buying the tpb's. Also it'd be cheaper to get them. So like I said, search around on Amazon, apparently tpb's are cheaper than when I was buying em."
xmen,3c6ys3,HxH21,5,Mon Jul 6 14:08:20 2015 UTC,"I would read the event issues of(don't worry about the tie in stuff)House of M, Messiah Complex, Messiah War, Second Coming, Avengers VS X-Men, AvX: Consequences, then start All-New X-Men and Uncanny X-Men. It sounds like a lot but it can be knocked out in a weekend. Everything is on Marvel Unlimited."
xmen,3c6ys3,Mathieulombardi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:53:41 2015 UTC,Marvel Unlimited.   o.0 I don't do digital.   Meaning to say that I don't have any tablets worth a damn so I don't look in to these things but damn.   Marvel Unlimited sounds like a GREAT way to get caught up with things and I guess let me know if I want to buy trades or if just reading through a storyline once was worth it.   Are arcs something that is done on marvel unlimited or would I need to have a reading order list next to me?
xmen,3c6ys3,Vyni503,4,Mon Jul 6 08:52:41 2015 UTC,"It kind of depends on how much further you're willing to go into it.  I started reading comics in mid march and started at house of M.  I felt that there are a lot more things that needs to be read than just the tec2030's reading guide.   I started out googling and used this post as a guide, then realized I was still missing out:  http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/4060-3173/forums/order-of-major-story-arcs-724686/?page=1#js-message-8637828  Then I used this guide, and this seems to be a great guide if you wanna read all good ones:  http://www.comicbookherald.com/the-complete-x-men-reading-order-guide-modern-marvel-comics-era/  Then I wanted more so I went with this one, and it looks to be the most comprehensive one.  However maybe you'll be like me and get stuck at certain point b/c there's just so much to read, so little time:  The most detailed reading order:  http://www.comicsbackissues.com/comic-book-reading-order/x-men-read-order-chronology/  Overall though, if you want a very good reading guide that ends pretty much after AvX (since it hasn't be updated), check here:  http://marvel.wikia.com/X-Men_Reading_Order  (start at part 13 after messiah complex)  It lays out issue by issue which one to read, as many requires you to jump from issue to issue.  As a new comic book reader, this hobby was super confusing for me at first."
xmen,3c6ys3,sunflowering,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:56:01 2015 UTC,lol keeping up with all the intertwining stories can be difficult :) but that's one of the things I LOVE about comics.  Life isn't in a vacuum and neither are these stories there are far reaching consequences.   I stopped because we don't have an LCS and my local book store stopped bringing in the comics.   Now that the comic life is picking up again(and I've got a credit card) I'm slowly making headway back into my collection and reading logs.   At this point I'm just looking for trades to get me caught up because All New confuses the hell out of me.

xmen,3c6ys3,sunflowering,2,Mon Jul 6 08:47:56 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of great guides in here so I won't link any more, but I will add that it also depends on what you want to read. It helps a lot to follow just one character, or a few characters, instead of going into a catch-up by saying ""I'll read everything!"", which is really really difficult to do nowadays as there are just so many books!   So for instance, you can say that ""I'm interested in reading about Cyclops."" then just follow the books where he's involved (usually flagship titles) This helped me a lot a year or so back when I decided to catch up with X-Books by reading and keeping up with books that Storm was in, then heading over to sites like Uncannyxmen.net if I don't understand something happening in an event."

I liked DoFP, but mostly when compared to the other movies. Same with First Class. Once I step back and consider the others and what it is I like about the 2 most recent films the franchise comes up short for me.  And I love the X-Men. Definitely my favorite comic books of all time.  I don't necessarily need for a comic storyline to be directly adapted to the screen, but I need more than what Fox has done with the franchise. And Marvel has been doing it! Their movies aren't perfect, but they're so much better than anything Fox has done with the properties they control.  We should have an entire movie universe built on nothing but X-Men titles that is better than Marvel's Iron Man / Avengers movies. Instead we have maybe 2 good X-Men movies and one ""meh"" Wolverine movie. It's a waste."

xmen,3bwx2i,detourne,3,Fri Jul 3 01:59:14 2015 UTC,"That's one of the best X-Men scenes I've read in months. Surprising that the book supposedly about Cyclops' revolution was stuck dealing with that Matthew Malloy BS, instead of actually focusing on Cyke's place in the Marvel Universe."

Particularly seeing Leading members (Cyclops, Storm, Colossus) interacting with the New Mutants and Gen-X kids who are taking the lead after them, but before the students.

The Phoenix ate a planet once just because it was hungry.  If the Phoenix decides to unmake Doom, then it's done-zo for God-Doom.  I mean kill Scott, that's fine.  I'm even a big Scott fan.  But the Phoenix is the most powerful, most terrifying villain of the X-Men stories.  It felt like a slap in the face to all of X-Men Fandom to have Doom kill our greatest terror with such aplomb.  I'm just livid... I mean so angry that I went online to EBay and bought the Coker Variant cover immediately--the one with Phoenix Cyclops.  It's pretty sweet--and it's clearly the ""correct"" cover for this issue.  But that'll show them--I'll spend twice as much money when they offend my mutant-loving sensibilities!  In all seriousness, I'm enjoying Secret Wars even more than I expected.  Especially the tie-ins, Years of Future Past, Old Man Logan, and X-Men '92 (which I enjoy in the same way as Batman '66).  As for OPs original question, yes it's confusing and I assume it has to do with the huge delay on UXM #600.  I really don't understand how they're going to make a book written before Secret Wars suddenly make sense after Secret Wars.  Unless Secret Wars ends with everyone waking up from dream... which is entirely possible at this point."
xmen,3bwx2i,Zthe27th,2,Fri Jul 3 02:07:56 2015 UTC,"Well, two things.     Killing Phoenix hosts is relatively easy. Jean-Phoenix died shooting herself with an energy beam from a turret. Xorneto killed Jean by giving her a stroke using the electromagnetic energy he intended to use the flip the magnetic poles of the Earth. An omnipotent Doom who apparently just killed a bunch of Beyonders should easily be able to kill a Phoenix host. And that's the thing. Doom has the Power of God right now. He's basically IG Thanos. He is essentially above the Phoenix power-wise. Phoenix is the representation of life and death, Doom has power over life and death. The death was sudden and sort of lame but not unbelievable."

Actually, I did hear OML was sticking around, and it doesn't surprise me at all that Laura is Wolverine. Overall, this seems like less of a revamp than I expected.

I'm more concerned about younger X-Men though, as I feel like they'll easily fall through the cracks. New Mutants, Academy X kids, the Lights, Bendis' OCs who were created for Team Cyclops just last year... Heck, we don't even know if Cable will be around.   ... I'm just worried about xbooks in general :("
xmen,3bozgw,sunflowering,2,Wed Jul 1 09:55:26 2015 UTC,"I feel. But this announcement give me huge hopes. Even if Cyclops is missing, the fact that the teams are being held together to some extent (and even that they are continuing not just 1 but 5 X-books) makes it seem like the X-Men are being pocketed within the Marvel Universe, but may be that much more accessible to fans. As far as comics go, I'm a noob, but I follow certain X-characters heavily and thus I rely heavily on some X-books and completely disregard others. This new formulation is concise enough that it gives me the opportunity to jump on all 5 titles from the get-go, which means I can improve my overall readership."
xmen,3bozgw,sunflowering,2,Wed Jul 1 19:42:04 2015 UTC,"Hey, that's perfectly understandable and totally believable! I think I'd suggest picking up only one or two of those books actually, to be easier to follow (and easier to afford haha)   At the same time, what I liked about having more than a dozen Xbooks a month is the variety it affords. I like reading about the school and the younger X-Men. I also liked reading dark stuff like X-Force. I like that you can have a book that is grimdark so that it won't bleed through to the other books. With Xbooks pared down to 5, I'm worried that won't be the case anymore. :/"
xmen,3bozgw,sonicfirestorm212,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:09:56 2015 UTC,You're right. It would be expensive.  And there could easily be a general watering-down of the entire franchise in moving to just 5 books. I'm sure they will eventually get back to that type of variety. I'm just glad to see things somewhat simplified for the X-Men. I warmed up to the idea of them being in space when that was first floated. I agree that the real measure of this relaunch may very well be how the X-students are treated.

The ""hated and feared"" angle is old, but it works because it resonates with people. The Avengers are fun but their stories don't mean much to me. (and I just don't care about the Inhumans haha)"

Teen Jean I'm a little unsure about, and keeping a version of Logan from a terrible AU sounds grimdark for the sake of being grimdark to me, but the rest of this sounds great! I really hope this works out well. It's a team that I think would work together very well but at the same time have enough conflict to keep things interesting.   Also: Storm as leader in a flagship book. Thank goodness Marvel's still doing something right."

xmen,3bli24,VolatileCurry,2,Wed Jul 1 06:09:25 2015 UTC,"I loved in the late 90s when Jean started wearing that costume again out of a desire to stop holding back. It was a sign that she was willing to be her own woman, even though she was a newlywed.  A strong, non-cosmic, grown up Jean is a wonderful character. Teen Jean is fun, but I wouldn't mind having my Jean back.  Or Hope. More Hope please?"

xmen,3bkq2m,Bodie293,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:42:14 2015 UTC,"Do you think that Fox put this relationship in the movies specifically to make people think that he's Kurt's father?   I mean, I know that us nerds know that back in 2003 we got the real origins of Kurt in Uncanny X-Men ""The Draco"" series. But to casual moviegoers they might not know that - it's never been mentioned, and there was no allusion to a Mystique/Azazel relationship.   Ok, so Nightcrawler's not big in the movies anyway, but what do you think Fox's motivations are for Mystique/Beast?   I just think Fox sometimes gets weird with things."

xmen,3bkq2m,ColleenEHA,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:25:09 2015 UTC,Lots of teleporters in the XMen comics to choose from.   But since Azazel is Nightcrawlers' dad they probably wanted him in it so it can be mentioned that he and Mystique had a baby.

xmen,3bk9j8,Awesome_Bobsome,3,Tue Jun 30 05:38:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am excited about the new X-Men team... but I'm still a little upset about the whole ""Let's kill the whole universe"" thing... but I'm reading along like a good little Marvel minion. Also, I'm not so much interested in the Inhumans/Mutant thing that they discuss in that article... I'm not a fan of the Inhumans. I feel that the Mutants have such an interesting story I think they stand alone in their little world. I wouldn't have minded if Mutants had their own Marvel Universe and stayed there. (I'm really not enjoying deaths of everyone including the MU, in case I haven't already said so...)  As for Extraordinary X-Men, I'm interested to see WHICH Nightcrawler they let live for this one. Doesn't look like Kurt Darkholme on the cover, but his gear is weird. According to the article, it's adult Kurt, but I'm interested to see what he does, what he knows, and how he acts after Secret Wars. Is he still ""healing"" as he was beginning to do at the end of the Claremont/Nauck series? Or is he back on stable ground?  TL;DR - I'm excited yes, but apprehensive. I'm very picky about portrayals of my Kurt. I'll read it and see how it goes.  Come join us in /r/Nightcrawler! :)"

xmen,3bgy5o,Rush_Moore,8,Mon Jun 29 03:17:28 2015 UTC,The Stepford Cuckoos. I thought they were the coolest since their appearance in New X-men. They're practically X-men already and should be elevated to full membership status based on all their help in each comic they're in.
xmen,3bgy5o,closest,3,Mon Jun 29 04:00:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. Though I feel like they want to kill off each one until there is only one. I hope not though. Three is a good manageable number.  The thing about being elevated to full official X-Man status, is a bit complicated right now. I think their needs to be a massive restructuring of the X-Organization and a reunification."
xmen,3bgy5o,closest,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:09:52 2015 UTC,"I'm confident they'll stick with three for a while, especially since they have a diamond form to realistically keep them safe. I enjoyed Sophie and Esme though, they had some real potential to go off on their own.  What I hate is when they're powered down. The Cuckoos are three telepathic minds capable of merging into one super mind. Even individually they're still talented, so merging makes elevates them up. I'm not saying they're the best now, but they should be powerful enough to kick young Jean Grey's ass.   Are you a big Julian Keller fan?"
xmen,3bgy5o,closest,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:19:55 2015 UTC,I would love the idea that their hive mind was technically the X-Man. All three had to be on the mission or none at all.

As for where the X-kids (not kids anymore!) can go, if Marvel decides to actually care about mutants again I'd love to see them have their own book and team where they're not stuck in school or being the ""junior"" team. Maybe a street team? The older teams can do more global, world-shaking ops, let the X-Kids be more local."
xmen,3bgy5o,Apophys421,2,Mon Jun 29 03:37:45 2015 UTC,"The X-Kids could be a recruiting team since most new mutants get their powers around their teenage years. Hell, you could have two teams.

I'll just be sitting there thinking ""why is Magic Mike throwing cards at me?""

xmen,3besqw,Great_Wave,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:40:25 2015 UTC,"First of all - blatant plug for /r/Gambit.  Secondly - I REALLY hope they dont try and make him some sort of bullshit magician. I get that sleight of hand could be handy for a thief, but it's not really necessary.  I would've assumed that any card throwing would've been heavily CGI, as Gambit tends to throw cards with an over-arm style (like when throwing a ball) as opposed to using a wrist flick (which is easier for throwing actual cards). And if anyone tries to argue ""no one can throw cards like that"" - all you have to do is say that when they're charged, they are more easily thrown."

xmen,3bdyga,monkeymosh88,5,Sun Jun 28 17:25:22 2015 UTC,I think the bigger thing would of been just less wolverine and more establishing the team/family dynamic. X1 was on the right track but then it became the wolvie show (except first class which is probably why I liked it more than the others).

I really feel like they completely overlooked Angel and Beast and I think its a shame because they both have great characters.   Beast trying to come to terms with the irony of his mutant talents vs. his intellectual interests and could add some comic relief with his overly smart comments and Warrens issues with his rich shitty family hating mutants. Like he had a rich shitty dad in X3 but that was not really the actual Angel to me just because he did not really get any characterization. I want to see them in character like this as a full part of the team not just side appearances.

xmen,3b9qoy,GoldandBlue,0,Sat Jun 27 05:14:39 2015 UTC,"I've messaged someone before and here are some bits from our messages;   I saw you post a comment on an X-men Thread where people posted their ideal X-men Teams. I wanted to get your take on an idea I've had for a little while now. What if there was an alternate Age of Apocalypse storyline with a team of psy powered characters;  Nate Grey  Stepford Sisters (Specifically Esme and Sophie with the others being back up.)  Quentin Quire  Hellion Keller  I'm inspired by sci-fi/dystopia anime where Nate would grow up in a world where Apocalypse took over the world, just like in AoA, except he's still a teen and training to be an X-man. There's some element of the series Evangelion too, where Nate is paired up with a team who have the potential to really take down Apocalypse and his Horsemen that attack the city him and fellow mutants are inhabiting. I've come up with some back stories to each of the characters, and of course there'd be some old X-men characters involved too, but the main storyline would be focused around a prophesied psionic mutant who will take down Apocalypse and usher in a new world. Nate would seem like the obvious choice, but with his group they'd be just as sure as he is that they're chosen instead. So they all try to prove themselves on the battlefield and push themselves to the limit to reach their goal. Do you think this story might have some potential?   Here is the next message after they replied;   Hopefully I can keep talking to you about my idea and flesh it out some more. Maybe I could turn it into a fanfiction and see the response I get there. Still, this idea has been in my head for weeks now and I believe has something worth reading.  I like your analysis of the characters, you've summed them up perfectly and glad you have the comic book knowledge to reference. Here is where I diverge; The story is set in an alternate reality so Julian hasn't lost his arms, the Cuckoos are still 5, Quentin didn't riot, and Nate is no where near Cable status. I'm sort of mixing New X-men and Academy X in the sense that the world is more hostile and gritty like NX but there is a loose school structure like in AX.  Also, I'm inspired by dystopian animes like Evangelion, Attack on Titan, Knights of Sidonia, and From The World. If you take a look at those anime you'll see the real darkness comes from outside the walls, where a society is safely separated from the world.  I'm also going to include more of the standard X-men lore too. Nate will be the son of Jean and Scott, except Scott will have died in a battle against Apocalypse. So this gives Nate a huge dose of pressure being the son of two fantastic X-men and will tie in the usual role he plays in every comic he is in; the mutant that takes down Apocalypse. Except I'm taking him back to where he's a teenager, so there is a real progression that needs to happen instead of him instantly being a mary sue.  The Stepford Cuckoos will also have some of their history intact as well. In my story they'll be the result of Emma Frost partnering with the Weapon Plus program to create the perfect telepath. They end up with 5 identical girls who are to be tested like all the other mutants to see if they meet expectation. I know 5 is a lot for one team, so I've cut them down to 2 for in field and 3 in cerebra. Since Esme and Sophie were the standouts in the comics, they'll also be the ones who excel more than their other 3 sisters and are given the chance to be on a field team. They all still have diamond skin, and I've only changed that they can still access the super mind no matter the distance between each other.  As for Quentin and Julian, I'm keeping their same personalities but wiping away their history. So they'll be brand new in this world. Julian is still a part of a rich family and has some of the best training, that adds in another layer of cockiness and him trying to the best out of everyone. Quentin will have lost the most, having lost his family to Apocalypse's raids and blames the X-men for saving them, so he's got a lot of pent up vengeance and attitude that the original Quentin has but with more justification.  I'm still stuck on where they live, is it a city/dome/country/etc. How much of the world Apocalypse has taken over, what kind of attacks he makes on the X-men now. And most importantly I'm trying to make sure my world doesn't closely resemble Age of Apocalypse. While they're on the same basis, and it does inspire me, the characters and focus is completely different."
xmen,3b9qoy,GoldandBlue,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:23:13 2015 UTC,"Well my question would be how does this differ from Age of Apocalypse? Have you read the X-Man series? Have you started writing anything or is it just an idea? Why just psy powered mutants? Doesn't that start to become a bit redundant?                I am not saying this to tear you down but to get you to focus more on what you want. I know this is just a summary but it feels to me like the X-Man series but his support group replaced by fellow telepaths/telekenetics. To me it sounds like you have a good idea of what you want from the characters, i would focus on how they differ from each other and compliment each other. Focus on the conflict and really establish what the rules are in this world and how they fit into it because that is very clearly the least developed part.                 If you want to continue this in PM go ahead and message me. i'll be on for a bit."

xmen,3b9qoy,jeizoe,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:06:36 2015 UTC,"It's an alternate timeline/world. So there's some new history and events happening separate from Earth 616. I chose these characters because they're all young in the comics and could realistically be the next generation of X-men.  Julian Keller and Quentin Quire are usually Junior X-men, so they're an easy fit into this storyline. The Stepford Cuckoos and Nate Grey fit in as long as Jean/Emma are older, and since they're teens in my story they'll fit with the original X-men being older adults."

And even though his first priority was always the safety of mutantkind, he also acted to benefit the world at large.  So, yes, his character has changed drastically.

xmen,3azt2u,SensitiveArtist,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:40:41 2015 UTC,"Also, the print and digital editions are different.  I spoke with the writer at Heroes Con and there is extra panels in the digital edition as it was originally conceived as a Marvel Infinite comic and not a print comic."

xmen,3avnkt,Jamie_Finch,7,Tue Jun 23 21:35:48 2015 UTC,"I read both issues of X-Men '92 when they came out digitally. They're more like the cartoon that came out during the 90s than they are like the comics that came out during the time (I believe they were meant to be more like the cartoon anyway) so perhaps if you're looking for more stories like it, you could check out the series? I think they're all on Netflix!"
xmen,3avnkt,sunflowering,5,Tue Jun 23 22:51:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people call the X-Men 90's comics bad but I read mostly everything in X-Men continuity from Days of Future Past to Present Day and by far the some of my favorite X-Men stories are in the 90's. Fatal Attractions, Age of Apocalypse, X-cutioner's song, then you had all around good comics like Cable's solo series, X-Factor, X-Man etc. If you're short of money then definitely read Fatal Attractios and Age of Apocalyspe WELL worth the money"

xmen,3avnkt,Laragon,0,Wed Jun 24 06:20:00 2015 UTC,"It's a personal preference thing. 90's era X-Men carry a different tone and writing style than more modern stuff. I prefer the writing from the likes of Rick Remender over someone like Clermont because of I feel like the characters and story are more dynamic and interesting. Generally speaking, long-time comic book fans enjoy the 90's stuff either because it's what they grew up with or because their expectations for comics books are much different than what someone like me (who got into X-Men only a few years ago) would expect."
xmen,3avnkt,VolatileCurry,3,Wed Jun 24 17:06:49 2015 UTC,the best X-Men book of the 90s was hands down X-Factor. Start at either issue #70 or #71. I'd highly recommend it.
xmen,3avnkt,living-silver,2,Wed Jun 24 01:10:31 2015 UTC,"Oh hell yeah. I went back last year and bought that entire run. I loved the whole team, the stories and became a fan of Havok big time."

xmen,3avnkt,xooxanthellae,2,Wed Jun 24 02:02:14 2015 UTC,The era in the picture starts in roughly around uncanny X-Men 260 or so.  I haven't read the Dark Knight so I can't compare the two.
xmen,3avnkt,StarsInAutumn,6,Tue Jun 23 21:46:13 2015 UTC,More like 280. 281 to be exact. That's the first issue for Gold Team in Uncanny which runs parallel to X-men 1.
xmen,3avnkt,djslife,3,Tue Jun 23 22:15:59 2015 UTC,"X-Men 1, uncanny 281, x-factor 71, and x-force 1 all kinda served as new starting points for that era, all coming within a month or two of each other. The first crossover for these groups is Xcutioner's Song. Check it out!"
xmen,3avnkt,UtahStateAgnostics,2,Tue Jun 23 22:28:48 2015 UTC,"Grant Morrison wrote a lot of Batman and he also wrote one of the best runs on X-Men, you've probably had it suggested a million times before because everyone will tell you to read it but it might be a nice bridge between Batman and The X-Men. He wrote New X-Men #114-154 so you should definitely have a look at that."

xmen,3avnkt,Mevansuto,2,Thu Jun 25 16:25:35 2015 UTC,"The picture you tweeted is from a series called X-Men '92, which is a new series focusing on the team from the old X-Men cartoon. The ""'92"" is in reference to the cartoon that it was inspired by, not the year the comic itself came out -- it came out this year. I haven't read it yet but it's seen a lot of praise.   If you're looking for darker stories, I don't think the 90's are actually the place to look. There's some cool stuff in Age of Apocalypse, like many others are mentioning, but I don't think it'll scratch the itch you're looking for after reading something like Death Of The Family.   For darker stories, I would strongly recommend Rick Remender's run on Uncanny X-Force, which follows a group of mutants lead by Wolverine, that tackle the dangerous jobs that the X-Men normally wouldn't do. Lots of moral dilemmas and great writing and art throughout.   Grant Morrison's New X-Men is a great read and puts the X-Men in a lot of difficult situations. It deals with mutant genocide, betrayal, and focuses on a small team of X-Men. It's a good jumping on point for new fans. This series is very love/hate with fans due to some things that happen later on, but I find the first story arc excellent.   Note quite as dark in tone, but Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men is another great jumping on point for new fans. Great writing and storytelling here."

The issues from 229-238, while not really collected anywhere, are pretty good too -- the Australian Outback era."

If you want to get into stuff more recent I also cannot recommend anything X-Men by Kyle AND Yost enough. Let me stress that it needs to be the both of them together, not that Yost's stuff is bad, but his solo work tends to be more upbeat.  It's pretty much just New X-Men 20-43 (the last three issues are part of Messiah Complex) All of X-Force (the 2008 volume 3)  Then the follow up X-Force series Uncanny X-Force by Rick Remender is really great and dark as well."

xmen,3avnkt,apalehorse,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:36:31 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with the otherwise great New X-Men is the art was too cartoonish compared to how darkly Kyle and Yost were writing it. Children were getting murdered left, right and centre yet it still looked like an all-ages book."
xmen,3avnkt,xooxanthellae,7,Thu Jun 25 16:23:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's true. The first half of the 90s was a period of intense popularity and some real risk taking. Some characters that are still around today (cable, gambit, deadpool) were invented then. Sure, there were too many pockets, but can anyone argue that AoA, fatal attractions, genosha, red and slim, the legacy virus, etc weren't good?"
xmen,3avnkt,Irahs,-7,Wed Jun 24 03:12:22 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more of the post-Claremont 90s, so that removes Gambit from your list. Everyone knows the 90s didn't really start until Nevermind was released, hahaha.   I actually haven't read the stuff, I'm just talking shit, but I know that Claremont was pushed out, Liefeld sucked, and then all the decent artists left, and there was a period of pushing out shiny #1s to sucker collectors. So, yeah, I think it likely was one of the weaker eras. That's not to say there wasn't any good stuff though."
xmen,3avnkt,xooxanthellae,2,Wed Jun 24 04:55:34 2015 UTC,"""I haven't read it, but its bad.""  hmmmm"
xmen,3avnkt,Irahs,-1,Wed Jun 24 15:39:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not at all what I said. I said ""The 90s is widely regarded as one of the weakest eras of the X-Men."" I don't have to read it to know the critical opinions."

xmen,3avnkt,Jumbledcode,-1,Wed Jun 24 18:16:24 2015 UTC,"I didn't say ""it's bad"". As I already said, due to losing strong writers and artists (and due to Liefeld's critically panned art), and due to a focus on making #1s with shiny covers, the 90s are widely regarded as one of the weakest eras. Now to be fair that might not include the entirety of the 90s, and I didn't say it was bad or that all of it sucked."
xmen,3avnkt,xooxanthellae,2,Wed Jun 24 18:25:12 2015 UTC,"What you did say isn't really accurate either. While there is some antipathy towards the 90s, a lot of it derives from the state of the comics book industry as a whole at the time rather than the X-Men books specifically.  The reality is that it's like most other periods, in that there's a mix of great arcs, mediocre work, and some stinkers."
xmen,3avnkt,Jumbledcode,0,Fri Jun 26 14:26:12 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. You gotta admit that a lot of talent left suddenly, though. Maybe they picked up the pieces quickly, I don't know."

If you are open to just regular hardcovers and not specifically an omnibi, Amazon separates out all hardcovers he wrote."
xmen,3ao5tr,AichSmize,11,Mon Jun 22 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of variations on what Magnetos exact goals are.  His early adaptations had him as a sort of generic terrorist mutant.  As his back story grew he became more sympathetic and was styled as more of a protector of mutant kind from human violence.  (In the OG secret wars he was put into the Hero camp to solidify this coming change in fact).  He has also ruled a fictitious mutant nation, liberated mutants, and saved the world (humans and mutants alike) on Avenger style teams/narratives.  So to your question,  Mag is probably best defined as someone who only cares about killing humans in context of protecting mutants (or perhaps making sure they are properly feared by humans).  While there is a zero-sum game of resources and space, Mag hasn't really addressed this as problematic to mutantkinds future.  Likewise I'm not familiar with him ever addressing that since mutants spawn from humans they deserve recognition - although that is some interesting nuance!"
xmen,3ao5tr,clever_usernames,4,Mon Jun 22 03:36:26 2015 UTC,"This is a good answer!    I, too, know of no reference to Magneto suggesting that humans should be kept as breeders (though I think that Apocalypse does).  And I'm not sure that the idea would hold up very well in Marvel Universe logic: aside from ethical concerns, there are mutants that have powers that make them better breeders than humans.  Angel Salvadore is an obvious example.  And, when one really wants to ""Mutant-ize"" the world, they always implement artificial birth systems with genetics technology, so widespread use of those techniques seems to only be one generation off.  I would guess that crazed Magneto would be more inclined to solutions that utilize mutants or science than explicitly keeping around humans to make more mutants.  My real reason for responding, though, is that I'd like to expand on Mag's evolving goals a little bit.  In reality of course, Magneto changed because ""DESPOTIC KING OF THE EVIL MUTANTS"" was a Silver Age concept that didn't jive with more sophisticated stories that Chris Claremont and others wanted to tell.  In comics, however, his changing motivations, when addressed, are usually explained by virtue of two things: growing wiser as he got older and psychological instability.  In his earliest appearances, Magneto was always drawn with these crazy eyes -- long before he ever removed his helmet (we think of Quicksilver having hair that's meant to be an homage to Eric, but it's actually the other way), the defining design characteristic for the character was that he looked unhinged due to his terrifying glare.  This provided a useful hook for later writers to suggest that he wasn't in his right mind then: driven mad because of the death of his first child and wife, he abandoned Xavier's dream and he let his great power corrupt his mind on his quest for vengeance.   Grant Morrison's Magneto is actually very in tune with the writing of Magneto, as his response to the Genosha tragedy is to revert to his old MWAHAHAHAHA villainy, though Morrison adds drug abuse into the mix, which makes such an implosion make even more sense.  I didn't get Morrison's Magneto at first, until I figured out that I was supposed to be watching a man with god-like power fall apart.  The other, more optimistic and more common way it's presented is that Magneto was an fiery, overly idealistic revolutionary, who eventually came to realize that, at the very least, the rhetoric he once employed was counterproductive.  And that's what you see, in, say the Magneto series that's just ending, or on Cyclops's teams."
xmen,3ao5tr,FF3,2,Mon Jun 22 15:32:51 2015 UTC,"Modern Magneto was born in Uncanny X-Men #150, anything before that I just ignore because he was basically bo bo Doom. I also find that writers who are not very familiar with him want to make him more extreme than he is (Morrison, Millar, etc.)                        Magneto has has quite a few relationships with humans including his first wife Magda, Lee Forrester, and the current girl he is seeing in his solo series whose name escapes me."

xmen,3ao5tr,ChurchBrimmer,3,Mon Jun 22 06:21:39 2015 UTC,"Magneto views mutants as the next step in evolution. The inferior human race was fearful of the mutants; it is something they don't fully understand and the potential for mutant abuse of humans and their institutions (ie, the anti-mutant propaganda of the sometimes hypotherical case in which Juggernaut or Shadowcat being able to successfully rob banks as they please). Given these parameters, it is only a matter of time until technology is developed by the humans that can counter the threat of the mutants. To ensure the success of mutantkind, Magneto wants to wipe out the humans (or build a safe haven for mutants) before this happens.   Alternate futures in which Magneto's goals are achieved show that unintended dystopias result, in which mutants and humans both lose. Xavier's pacifist notions are too idealistic and not grounded in the real world to work either; Xavier's future is one in which humans build the Sentinel program and one of many possible dystopian outcomes in which mutants lose is the result.  It is only through the union of their opposed views and methods that mutantkind stands a chance. A real-world example I personally enjoy comparing it to is the combined efforts of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr.; each would have been marginalized and not succeeded alone, but the combination of pacifist and non-pacifist methods thrust onto public awareness will always make the pacifist option more appealing than it would have been otherwise. Without one, the other is effectively powerless.  PS - The offspring of humans can be either humans or mutants; the genetic predisposition for being a mutant is passed along the X-chromosome (hence X-Men) rather than the Y-chromosome. The offspring of mutants tend to be mutants (that are usually) more powerful than the mutants born to humans). As an example, look at the offspring of Cyclops and Jean Grey."

xmen,3ajrkt,wreak_havok,3,Sun Jun 21 01:03:18 2015 UTC,It was in an arc from 2000 called The Twelve! It followed a space(? don't quote me on this it's been a while since I read that arc) adventure where it turns out Logan didn't return with with the X-Men; Apocalypse planted a Skrull to impersonate him while he was making Logan his Death.

What they are probably doing and what would make sense, is set the story in the future, and have it be an original story, as the last two xmen movies have been (as in not based on a specific comic story) and basically just allow Hugh Jackman to give his wolverine the ending he deserves.  And why not capitalize on the success of the old man Logan name?  No matter that they do for this, it will be 100 times more enjoyable than avengers 2 was."

Basic story structure mirrors the comics, but all these stories are the same structurally anyway.  sending wolverine back in time instead of kitty, it makes for a totally different story. As well as the set up for first class as being CIA agents as led by a freshly graduated douche instead of students to a Doom Patrol rip-off wheelchair guy also changes that story significantly.  To the guy who replied to you, you can stick my foot in your mouth, because I loooooove having my toes licked, and to you you who wasn't a dick about correcting me, sorry you had to know about my foot fetish.

xmen,3ad58d,Penguino13,3,Fri Jun 19 03:36:29 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what you're interested in. X-Factor is the most important in terms of the main X-Men storyline. It follows the original members of the X-Men and contains the return of Jean Grey, the introduction of Apocalypse, and some of the most crucial moments in Angel's history.  New Mutants is also significant. It's the first real younger generation of mutants, and quite a few will go on to be major X-Men, especially Magik.  Excalibur is more removed, but is a much-beloved series and involves long-time X-Men characters such as Nightcrawler, Shadowcat, and Rachel Summers."
xmen,3ad58d,Jumbledcode,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:48:24 2015 UTC,New Mutants is the most important to read along side Uncanny. X-Force has the biggest ramifications for the X-Men line post Claremont. Excalibur is delightful. Read them all and enjoy it.

She'd shoot arrows and telekinetically drive the arrows to her opponents, and maybe even telepathically ""freezing"" them (not very practical, but very cool).  That'd cement her status as Marvel Girl, or THE Jean Grey (aka Omega powerhouse of X-Men).  Then again, it might be too similar to Magneto manipulating bullets.  Also, I remember some instances where Jean threw discs at Cyclops to shoot at (I'm sure it's in the X-men Evolution series. Not sure about comics, though). That's also a less cool possibility but at least, their relationship would be more fleshed out."
xmen,3a7dzk,riddledivan,6,Thu Jun 18 04:55:49 2015 UTC,This really seems like the work of some studio executive who thought giving Jean a bow would help X-Men cash in on the popularity of The Hunger Games.

A role in which the show made her just a whipping post for bad boyfriend club of westeros but someone who has shown almost no growth in 5 seasons of a show. To playing a dominant mutant. I dont know if she can pull it off. Sometimes casting decisions like this and Tatum for Gambit make me loathe fox sometimes.

This is why I also enjoyed (and others) enjoyed The Dark Knight it wasn't just a 'superhero' film. Comic movies are stepping away from that and there is an argument to be made that Captain America had a great government surveillance theme that was appropriate.  I'm very glad X-Men has it's own film universe, I enjoy the weight of the films. Marvel studio films still hasn't made me feel the consequences, although they are fun."

xmen,3a46r4,VolatileCurry,3,Wed Jun 17 02:24:34 2015 UTC,"Morrison's New X-Men was great and largely got me back into the franchise after drifting away in the 90s.  Another strong contender would be early New Mutants.  My least favorite is the very early 90s, largely because of the abundance of aborted storylines due to writers coming and going so rapidly.  Especially with all the interesting villains getting killed off by new villains to show how evil they are, but the new ones are just horribly dull."
xmen,3a46r4,wogoat,3,Wed Jun 17 18:10:46 2015 UTC,I loved most of Claremont's run. Morrison's New X-Men was great & Whedon's run was really enjoyable. I really didn't enjoy the wolverine side of the schism in recent years but current Cyclops is badass
xmen,3a46r4,MnB_85,2,Fri Jun 19 10:06:57 2015 UTC,"Morrison's New X-Men might be my least favorite X-Men I've read. (However, I haven't read any of the 90s stuff, and I'm sure Liefeld is way worse.)  My favorite era is the 80s Claremont stuff, esp From the Ashes, Wolverine, & God Loves Man Kills. The Australian outback era is fantastic too -- great art by Silvestri. That's all the stuff I grew up on so it's the real X-Men to me. I also enjoyed the hell out of Whedon's Astonishing & Remender's Uncanny X-Force."
xmen,3a46r4,xooxanthellae,2,Thu Jun 18 08:47:57 2015 UTC,"Favorite is the Australia X-Men. What I started with. I like the recent Cyclops a lot, though.  Worst: The pre-Liefeld era on New Mutants is close. Liefeld gets hated, but Bird Brain and Star Spider Chick just get ignored. Least favorite is really probably the Austen run, though. I dunno. A lot of the '90's were forgettable."
xmen,3a46r4,Nellisir,2,Wed Jun 17 02:47:00 2015 UTC,"Agree on both accounts.

Overall I find the writing to consistently be stupid and uninspired and the art to be downright ugly.  I'm sure there are some good stories from that era, but I have never read any of them. They were mostly just stories for little kids about super heroes fighting super villains. There's a lot of really convoluted time travel stuff (to be fair, X-Men is still riddled with that) and the characters are all one-dimensional. The same can be said about most comics from that era. Grant Morrison is the earliest writer to work on X-Men that I've found any respect for. He took the characters and story more seriously and tried to create something that had some depth and intrigue, while still being about people with super powers. I consider him a true master of his craft, whereas people like Stan Lee were just making up characters for children's books with no real substance or quality. Just my two cents."
xmen,3a46r4,argyle47,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:08:14 2015 UTC,"My favorite X-Men era are the Chris Claremont/John Byrne years. Even though Byrne started doing the pencils at issue #108, it was still relatively recent that the X-Men had re-emerged from limbo, so the team was still pretty much new and there was plenty of room for the characters to be developed and defined. There was the introduction of the Imperial Guard (right at the switch from Dave Cockrum to John Byrne), the Hellfire Club, and Alpha Flight. Magneto returned after having been turned into an infant. Wolverine came into his own. Days of Future Past. It was during those years that I think the X-Men really hit their stride; to me it seemed like a renaissance. I'd love to see what John Byrne's art would look like using the current full color palette. Plus, in those days, one could keep up with the goings on of X-Men by merely buying The Uncanny X-Men; there was no need to buy a gazillion other crossover issues,."

xmen,39xlr1,yoggiez,14,Tue Jun 16 02:26:53 2015 UTC,"Still not sold on Tatum as Gambit.  Not that I think he's a bad actor, I just think he's physically wrong for the part."
xmen,39xlr1,6isNotANumber,5,Mon Jun 15 17:22:52 2015 UTC,"Well, he's tall enough for it to work, and if you watch older movies with him, like She's the Man, wherr he is thinner his physique would not be out of place.  He definitely needs longer hair, might look awful, and needs to be leaner. Hopefully he'll have the black eyes too...but I do agree that I never pictured a live action gambit with his style of face. I always thought he'd have bigger eyes...  Nonetheless if compromises will be made, which Tatum is a fan of Gambit's so hopefully they will, he could do a decent job."
xmen,39xlr1,trumoi,5,Tue Jun 16 10:51:52 2015 UTC,"agreed. so what, are they making a gambit stand-alone film? dunno if that's going to work. gambit has always been a childhood favorite of mine, but i've just been meh overall with the handling of mutants in film. i'm not expecting great things here."
xmen,39xlr1,Stereotypy,4,Mon Jun 15 17:56:59 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think the only really bad mutant movie so far was X3.  The Wolverine stand-alones were kinda meh but I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the Stryker/Team X bits.  Gonna have to wait until I can see at least a trailer for Gambit before I decide if it's a Theater must-see or a redbox rental."
xmen,39xlr1,6isNotANumber,3,Mon Jun 15 18:10:40 2015 UTC,An english director for an american southern comic book character? Im sure it can work. He hasnt done enough for me to think one way or the other if it will be good or not
xmen,39xlr1,bgrem261,7,Mon Jun 15 19:19:08 2015 UTC,That gambit they had in that terrible wolverine movie was actually spot on.

I'd rather they integrated him (Kitch as Gambit) into the regular X-Men movies they've been popping out like candy and see if there's actually enough to do a full movie. I love love love Gambit, but I'm afraid they'll ruin the character for me if they do a shoddy movie."

xmen,39xlr1,GoldandBlue,6,Mon Jun 15 18:57:34 2015 UTC,Yeah i agree with you. I love gambit and im not convinced they can write a decent story for him without it being way too stereotypically cajun. Im from new orleans. Big reason i love him and im tired of seeing this area portrayed as a place where we eat gumbo and go to mardi gras on a daily basis. Im down for him being in xmen apocalypse but his own movie? Ill see it for sure but expectations are low.
xmen,39xlr1,bgrem261,3,Mon Jun 15 20:31:12 2015 UTC,You telling me you don't eat gumbo?
xmen,39xlr1,GoldandBlue,9,Mon Jun 15 21:21:01 2015 UTC,Oh i do. But everyone who makes things set in new orleans makes us out to be drunks who regularly go to the swamp to pay tribute to our voodoo lords and eat gator gumbo with our cousins beau and belle
xmen,39xlr1,bgrem261,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:33:26 2015 UTC,I'm expecting New Orleans itself to be a major character in this film (like NY in a lot of movies).  Toughest thing will be for Tatum to nail the accent.

xmen,39xlr1,DTMickeyB,2,Tue Jun 16 05:22:41 2015 UTC,You can't blame him for Jupiter Ascending - that was a huge mistake on all fronts. He was actually not bad in White House Down.

New X-Men gave him some serious development after the 90's turned him into a boring team dad. I really like the way he was written in Uncanny vol 2 so I would also recommend that.

xmen,39no5v,detourne,2,Sat Jun 13 11:20:28 2015 UTC,"I'll take a stab at it for you. So, when Cyke's family was flying in the plane, his mother was actually pregnant. Just before they crash, Scott and Alex are pushed out of the plane with the sole parachute. Mom and Dad are abducted by the Shiar, for some reason, I forget now, I think mom dies but her unborn baby is put through a kind of incubator. Christopher Summers, Dad, runs off and becomes Corsair, captain of the Starjammers, a group of space pirates.  Gabriel Summers, Vulcan, had some bad stuff happen to him (I'm hazy on all the details) and finally comes back to earth to be recruited into Xavier's Deadly Genesis team.  Although CBG19 mentions that team was killed, that's only half true. Petra and Sway are killed, but Vulcan and Darwin go into a sort of hibernation."

For example X-Tinction Agenda occurs seven years after the crossover, in a reality where Havok and Wolfsbane stayed behind in Genosha and have kind of been ruling over it.

xmen,394ywx,VolatileCurry,5,Tue Jun 9 08:07:57 2015 UTC,"Magik was in New Mutants v3 from 2010-12 and that's a really solid and slightly more obscure book that's pretty enjoyable. There's also New X-Men: Academy X which features her comeback in it's penultimate arc and stars X-23 from #20 onwards, before that it's kind of a high school thing not unlike Wolverine And The X-Men but it becomes really dark after House Of M. There's also an X-Infernus miniseries starring her and she's in Uncanny X-Men v2.  There was a Cable ongoing from 2008-10 as well that shows where he goes after Messiah Complex and his eventual return in Second Coming which crosses over with X-Force v3, doesn't seem to be as widely known as Uncanny X-Force but it's as good imo. There have been three X-Force titles since 2012, Uncanny X-Force, Cable and X-Force and X-Force v4. X-Force v4 is really really good but very different to most X-books, Uncanny X-Force seems to be pretty divisive so I'd approach it with caution but it does star Fantomex, and Cable And X-Force is all about Cable and Hope trying to prevent crimes before they happen with a team of obscure mutants.  Nightcrawler comes back in the first arc of Amazing X-Men, which started in 2014 and has just finished, it's not as important in continuity but still a lot of fun.  Oh and Uncanny Avengers is by the same writer as Uncanny X-Force, features a squad of half-mutants, half Avengers and kind of ties up a few loose ends from the end of that book, so you should definitely give it a try. It is pretty stupid in places though."

xmen,394ywx,RaoulSeagull,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:29:56 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I read it after I had read Axis, so I knew where it was headed. I definitely feel like that was the weaker story arc though."

Like there's X-Force Volume 1 - 4, but when shopping for the TPB, I often find "" volume"" referring to the number of the trade, within the ""volume"" of X-Force. Makes this more confusing than it needs to be. I'm buying a lot of my comics on Amazon or at the local comic store. Is there a website that breaks down the series in a more digestible way so that I can shop easier?"
xmen,394ywx,RaoulSeagull,2,Tue Jun 9 17:36:23 2015 UTC,"I usually use wikipedia and go down to the collected editions section, for example on their X-Force page you can see all 4 volumes ordered and there's a name for each trade paperback, so you can just stick that name into Amazon.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Force#Collected_editions"

xmen,394ywx,ActualButt,3,Wed Jun 10 05:19:01 2015 UTC,"The New X-Men Omnibus should be good for you, because if memory serves me correctly that is where Fantomex first appears. A lot of other cool characters are introduced there too, like Beak who I personal think is rad as shit. Other than that, though, it is still very much a ""core"" book (it's mostly about Cyclops and Wolverine and Jean Grey and other well-worn characters).  X-Factor is a good book if you want to step away from the core and explore some of the less-known characters. In particular I'm thinking of volume 3 (2005-2013). Most of the characters are former X-men (or formerly on one of the X-teams) that are now working as private investigators. It's got characters from that 90s era you hate, but with much more modern storytelling. There's a bit of a neo-noir vibe at times, and the characters get a lot of depth."
xmen,394ywx,RaoulSeagull,2,Tue Jun 9 08:46:21 2015 UTC,I second all this. Especially X-Factor. But both are great. New X-Men was the first Marvel Omnibus I thought was worth buying.

xmen,394ywx,ActualButt,2,Tue Jun 9 20:22:02 2015 UTC,"I recommend X Factor vol 3. The one that has Maddrox in charge of a detective agency. They basically took a bunch of B list X characters that no one was using and created an incredibly formidable super team.  Also Wolverine and Wolverine Origins. Start with Vol. 3, then right before Civil War is where Origins starts so switch over and read all of that, then continue with Vol. 3 and Vol. 4 after that. That's how I read it anyway.  Exiles. I can't recommend Exiles enough. It deals with alternate realities and different versions of characters. I loved it.  Maybe Uncanny Avengers too which I think ties in with Magneto. I haven't read all of those yet, but they seem interesting.  I'm currently reading All New X Factor and I'm not sure if I like it yet. I'm on the 7th issue and it's been pretty meh so far.  If you don't already have it, you should get Marvel Unlimited. You can read everything there except the most recent stuff."

xmen,393ebq,discov3ry,3,Tue Jun 9 10:47:47 2015 UTC,"I have no issue with this, given how young and not-manly Jackman was when he first got cast.  But I think if they want to truly get people past Jackman they need to go back to the comics and go in an entirely different direction than the handsome tortured sex machine Jackman played.   They need to go down the route of the greasy, stubby, hairy, short, decidedly un-sexy little scrapper from the comics. The guy who'd take out a porno while Professor X was addressing the students.  If he was a few years younger I would say someone like Jackie Earle Haley."
xmen,393ebq,gothamite27,4,Tue Jun 9 05:26:17 2015 UTC,I feel like Wolverine is a hard one to cast. You need an actor who already has some age but will still be in crazy shape for a while. Taron is way too young to be Wolverine.

One of those realities is the X-Men cartoon, the characters of the show and their related contexts are now in one of the many territories on the planet.

xmen,38y1my,mc8755,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:38:13 2015 UTC,Well a long hair wig wouldn't really require going bald. If you go bald for a wig then it's likely you will have a lot of your scalp exposed. Otherwise a cap could mask it. Heck might be easier to dye as well.   So i'm betting mohawk or bald. If her character is from Africa then being bald may not be out there for her. Of course 80's and Mohawks go hand in hand.

xmen,38vkyd,bobwoodshed,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:07:39 2015 UTC,I am pretty certain the omnibus does but the graphic novels actually treat it as two separate series. So there are 2 volumes of the X Force stuff and 4 of X Statix. And yeah the current Silver Surfer is really good.

xmen,38kr4j,SmilesUndSunshine,6,Thu Jun 4 21:14:25 2015 UTC,Happy Jubilee!  Lame dad Cyclops!  Laser tag!  Codenameless-Jean-Grey!  And so much more!  Here is the thread from /r/comicbooks appropriately titled... X-Men '92 is everything I ever wanted.  One of the writers (Chris Sims) is a big fan of the 90's cartoon.  He's written an episode guide for the cartoon on comicsalliance.com.  He's also appeared on several episodes of Rachel and Miles X-Plain the X-Men.  His enthusiasm for the TV show and 90's X-Men in general spills out of the pages.  Issue #1 was great and I'm so looking forward to this series.
xmen,38kr4j,djslife,11,Thu Jun 4 21:15:32 2015 UTC,Bah. Gimme gold and blue teams drawn by Jim Lee or GTFO.
xmen,38kr4j,TheHandOfGau,3,Thu Jun 4 22:27:54 2015 UTC,"I think you will find things to enjoy X-Men '92.  In [this interview on X-Plain the X-Men], there is a lot of discussion about X-Men in the Jim Lee/post-Jim Lee era.  The reason the comic is titled X-Men '92 is because 1992 represents a year of change, the rise of the Jim Lee and his peers, Claremont leaving and the people who grew up reading Claremont now writing X-Men."
xmen,38kr4j,stormrider133,3,Thu Jun 4 23:06:36 2015 UTC,"I know you probably don't the answer to this, since its the first issue. But do I need to read any other comics before this? Or will I need to read any other series which may have tie ins? I've been away from comic books for a while and this looks like a good spot to start up again."
xmen,38kr4j,Nightender,2,Fri Jun 5 01:10:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think so.  I have not read anything Secret Wars related besides X-Men '92.  In Chris and Chad's guest appearance on Rachel and Miles, they talk about there is something called ""Westchester Wars"" that happened before the events of X-Men '92 #1, but I searched for it on the internet and found no mention aside from the Rachel & Miles podcast.  If you want some background, you can listen to the first half of the podcast.  Halfway through they start talking about spoilers, but they also say they're going to talk about spoilers so you can stop then."
xmen,38kr4j,Nightender,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:11:05 2015 UTC,"It's basically supposed to pick up where the show left of, isn't it?"

xmen,38lhkq,bushysmalls,6,Fri Jun 5 13:22:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the distinct lack of X-men is kind of angering at this point."
xmen,38lhkq,DarkGrey82,2,Fri Jun 5 16:26:02 2015 UTC,Well there's been plenty of discussion about this elsewhere but the way it's been explained is they aren't backing off of Xmen and FF (they are very central to the current event) but they aren't going to do Fox any favors by selling tshirts and toys for them.
xmen,38lhkq,Xailadrell,5,Fri Jun 5 16:07:14 2015 UTC,I'm all for X-23 being the new Wolverine as I love her character but its going to be weird if Old Man Logan was around in the main universe. I love that character and story but wish they would have just left it by itself and done a sequel story.
xmen,38lhkq,_Invalid_Username__,3,Fri Jun 5 00:02:17 2015 UTC,"The way I hope it goes down: OML tutors Laura in the ways of fistshankery and badassitude, a la Old Bruce and Terry in Batman Beyond.  EDIT: Who called it? I called it."

xmen,38lhkq,SMB73,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:39:18 2015 UTC,Ya that's what I was thinking. I know they kind of revamped her for All New Xmen but she still is essentially a veteran. Maybe she just needs a little maturity before becoming the official Wolverine.

xmen,38at8g,skolasa,19,Wed Jun 3 00:31:37 2015 UTC,"Xmen origins: Wolverine was similar.  Obviously didn't have the flow combat style, but it was basically a God of War style combat system. He had a sense mode similar to detective mode. No really much stealth, but I think I remember some sprinkled in.   I enjoyed the game and still own it.  The story was kinda Meh since it tied in a little with the movie, so you had to fight that Deadpool abomination but overall I had a blast playing it."
xmen,38at8g,IamBabcock,5,Wed Jun 3 01:40:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I thought it was a really fun game with some very satisfying gameplay.  The fact that you could unlock so many classic outfits was a definite plus.
xmen,38at8g,detourne,8,Wed Jun 3 03:17:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, that was a fun bonus. They had interesting characters too. You get to fight the blob in a supermarket. I thought the gambit fight was fun and epic on the rooftop. The falling sentinel battle. Fighting Wendigo in the forests...  Also forgot to mention it was a gory game too. Wolverine fucked people UP with dismemberment and many other fun ways to dispatch people. Plus when he took enough damage you could see his rib bones and heart beating before eventually healing up."
xmen,38at8g,IamBabcock,3,Wed Jun 3 03:25:13 2015 UTC,It's a pretty solid game for what it is. Infinitely better than it's shitty movie counterpart.
xmen,38at8g,ThoughtNinja,2,Wed Jun 3 10:35:21 2015 UTC,Well it's not like it could be worse...
xmen,38at8g,GregorF92,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:53:35 2015 UTC,Well considering how bad some movie based games tend to be it could have been but then again that movie is abysmally shit.   This game is also the only case I can think of that the game actually turned out better than the film.
xmen,38at8g,ThoughtNinja,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:12:32 2015 UTC,X2: Wolverine's Revenge was the one before it right? I enjoyed that a fair bit. More linear than Arkham though.
xmen,38at8g,Gambit791,2,Wed Jun 3 16:44:01 2015 UTC,"For the PS2?  I barely remember it so I don't know if I didn't play it or just forgot, but I do remember a little about it. I vaguely remember sneaking around in snow outside some complex and he's wearing that xmen suit from the first movie."
xmen,38at8g,IamBabcock,2,Wed Jun 3 16:58:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I think that was infiltrating Weapon X. There was an enhanced senses mechanic for stealth mode in that game too.
xmen,38at8g,Gambit791,18,Wed Jun 3 17:36:22 2015 UTC,I would take an arkham style game with pretty much any superhero.
xmen,38at8g,whiskeybill,9,Wed Jun 3 01:47:47 2015 UTC,haha yes. Spider-man with web slinging across the city and ziplining to the top of structures seems very appropriate
xmen,38at8g,mish15,11,Wed Jun 3 02:28:21 2015 UTC,I think you're just thinking of Spiderman 2 The movie game. Best sandbox game ever.
xmen,38at8g,alzger,3,Wed Jun 3 14:49:51 2015 UTC,That game was so much fun.
xmen,38at8g,revolver666,18,Wed Jun 3 18:03:58 2015 UTC,"Open world on a grand scale like GTA5. Set in NYC and Xavier's school, you can switch between a few different X-Men to play their missions/side missions/etc. which all eventually weave into one big storyline. There are tons of cameos from other X-Men and Marvel characters.  This will never happen."

xmen,38at8g,JimmyNaNa,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:05:22 2015 UTC,"I agree. Loved the first, got excited by the second but it felt underwhelming. Probably just because it was just the same game for the most part."
xmen,38at8g,IamBabcock,0,Wed Jun 3 17:00:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it felt shorter too. Kind of like they just stuck a bunch of ideas they didn't use from the first game and didn't really flesh out anything to the extent it should have been. It felt like more of an expansion pack than an entirely new game. Still worth a playthrough though."
xmen,38at8g,JimmyNaNa,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:17:50 2015 UTC,I freaking love this game. Played it all the time with buddies.
xmen,38at8g,oh_sure,10,Wed Jun 10 17:21:23 2015 UTC,"X2 Wolverine's Revenge for the PS2 was similar for that generation of consoles. You had the sneak and attack game style, the boss battles were big and the story was pretty good. Was not as open world that you get with today's games. I can't vouch for any of the other console or handheld versions."
xmen,38at8g,Camanokid,5,Wed Jun 3 01:03:46 2015 UTC,I want a Wolverine game where you strap a wiimote to each hand to have motion-control claws.

xmen,38at8g,quixotik,4,Wed Jun 3 22:37:15 2015 UTC,"HFS I want this.  Along the same lines, a Star Wars: Shadow of Mordor would kick ass. Maybe an ex-Jedi anti-hero on a one-man crusade to wipe the Empire off his homeworld or something, I dunno."
xmen,38at8g,fortalyst,3,Wed Jun 3 01:25:34 2015 UTC,Interesting idea.... The life regen mechanic would work well and you can also use his heightened senses along with a very large list of enemies & villains. I'd buy it based on the sheer volume of storylines you could build around this game.
xmen,38at8g,dodogenocide,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:57:54 2015 UTC,That would be amazing

xmen,38at8g,JimmyNaNa,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:50:33 2015 UTC,"What about X-men in the style of Arkham but with the ability to switch between characters and their individual missions like in GTA V. Yeah it would be awesome, but Marvel never gives a reasonable budget to their video games so we'll never get it."
xmen,38at8g,JimmyNaNa,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:26:00 2015 UTC,I feel like the other X men wouldn't work in the arkham style because the main thing I like about arkham is the grittiness of it and I feel like wolverine is the only one to fit the bill. I just couldn't see Cyclopes sneaking around then snapping a guys neck
xmen,38at8g,JimmyNaNa,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:40:51 2015 UTC,"True but Cyclops could be an NPC and you could have Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Gambit, Beast, Psylocke, etc as playable. Or it could lean more to the GTA style of gameplay. While Wolverine does have a stealth capability he's much more fun making a scene. I was thinking Arkham style less in the way combat was handled, more in the way it did justice to a comic based world. Either way we'll never get it unfortunately haha.  Edit. Kitty Pryde also would make a good stealth player for obvious reasons. That being said, I recant part of my statement. I think GTA style would be much better than Arkham. I don't think there's anything fun about X-men or Wolverine as a stealth game. Maybe one or two missions. But not the whole basis of the game. It's really only suited to Batman or like Splinter Cell."
xmen,38at8g,rillip,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:50:30 2015 UTC,Ohhh well I mean I think a GTA style game would be good but I really would like the arkham style game. What I mean is that think of what arkham was it was batman completely against the odds and going against all the rouges. What we could do is have all the main wolverine villains( not X men like magneto) like omega red and saber tooth going for wolverine with striker just sending them trying to capture wolverine.
xmen,38at8g,WSable,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:05:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in that sense it would have to be a Wolverine only game. That would be cool. It would be cool if they did it similar to Death of Wolverine storyline and the 6, 3 months to die. Except maybe you don't die at the end and you don't lose the healing factor. Although that would be a cool twist."

xmen,38at8g,bgrem261,2,Wed Jun 3 04:02:23 2015 UTC,"Like a lot of fans, I feel we've just been overexposed to Wolverine.  He's popular, so he's in everything.    How is this possible?  Well, we're supposed to just ""ignore continuity"" and ""enjoy the stories"".  I'm sure that works for some people, but for me it kills the immersion into the Marvel U as a whole.  And it isn't just limited to Wolverine (Spider-Man is another big culprit, but so is everyone who has a solo book and is also on a team).  That said, Wolverine would be the BEST person on the X-Men to have a solo game like this (with Gambit being second).  His skill and power set are the most conducive to a fighting game similar to Arkham."
xmen,38at8g,trollburgers,2,Wed Jun 3 14:27:54 2015 UTC,Gambit might have a game coming out. No official anything on it. Just my speculation that with Origins Wolverine came a game alongside it. Im just hoping Gambit gets the same treatment.
xmen,38at8g,WSable,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:51:02 2015 UTC,"The hardest part about the game would be the whole ""I'm going to charge up this semitruck and drive it into a building just to see what happens"" thing that people are just dying to do."

xmen,3868gm,apalehorse,3,Wed Jun 3 12:38:11 2015 UTC,"Forge  Mystique  Banshee  Polaris  Dazzler  It's inspired by the government sponsored x-factor from the 90s, the x-factor investigation and the Mystique series. Forge is hired by an anonymous billionaire to start the team, it's going to be more like private investigator work but lots of spy undercover work, less up front fighting of the x teams.   So opening prose would be Forge approaching Banshee and Polaris to join him (don't forget Forge and Banshee were the only Xmen on the team post Australian era, and Polaris goes way back with them both). So they're being briefed on their first mission which is to infiltrate some mansion to steal something Forge introduces the 4th member, Mystique. Polaris is indifferent having worked with her before, Banshee goes ape shit because Mystique tried to kill him before says he can't work with her, Forge vouches for Mystique, Banshee storms out the door and Dazzler is there she is seeking sanctuary. Forge says they don't have time right now but Dazz is welcome to stay til they come back, Banshee declines the mission he stays with Dazz while Forge, Polaris and Mystique goes on the mission. So the mission turns out to be a trap their billionaire employer tries to kill them. Banshee rethinks and decides to go back cuz he could live if they died because he didn't help and Dazz goes with him and it goes from there.   So lot of covert undercover work eg one storyline with Mystique Polaris and Banshee infiltrating a modelling agency (don't forget Mystique's supermodel persona), Banshee as the photographer and Lorna the ""new girl"", whom gets told she's too fat to model which starts Lorna's obsession with her weight again (remember in x-factor?)   Eventually I'll add Sage and Shard to the team. Sage gets killed and Forge transfers her mind to a cybernetic network (think Prosh the ship of the scummy old Xfactor) so she'll be the actual human computer, and Shard goes back to her hologram form."

AvX was a transparent Avengers circlejerk that came on the heels of the Avengers movie, so it was obvious the Avengers were going to come out on top.

Am I an X-men fan?  Somewhat.  I've only started reading comics middle of Mar, starting from House of M.  I'm an adult reader as well.  So I feel that what Marvel wrote isn't supposed to be catered to me.  It seems they just like to pit super heroes against super heroes ever so often to sale comics or to write themselves out of a funk.  I kinda get that.  I just feel what they wrote was hugely out of character for who these people are.  I may be in the minority who now despises Avengers.  But still, I gotta buy Avengers from Hickman, since he's so good.  Still, FUCK THOSE AVENGERS.  ps. Cyclops was right"
xmen,37ssin,Mathieulombardi,6,Sat May 30 06:08:19 2015 UTC,"If you want a more ""adult"" X-Men story I recommend the Wolverine: Weapon X miniseries by Barry Windsor-Smith. It has mature themes, a non-linear narrative, phenomenal artwork, and deep characterization. Plus it's very self-contained so its good for new readers.  You can also check out Uncanny X-Force, although it helps if you understand the back story of Archangel and Apocalypse for that one."
xmen,37ssin,Showbuckle,6,Sat May 30 07:23:42 2015 UTC,"I just recently read Weapon X and I wish I hadn't. Claremont was right --- Wolverine's mysterious past should remain a mystery.  I'd say Meltdown would be a better recommendation for an ""adult"" Wolverine comic. Just my 2 cents  I definitely cosign Remender's Uncanny X-Force, damn that was a good run."
xmen,37ssin,xooxanthellae,2,Sat May 30 08:10:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's surprising. I've never heard of any X-Men fans not liking Weapon X.  I tend to agree with you and Claremont about Wolverine's history (although, does a ""mysterious past"" really add anything to his character?) but I think Weapon X strikes the perfect balance between ambiguity and exposition.  Also, I've never read Meltdown because of my ambivalence for Havok's character. Maybe I should change that."

It's one of the best Havok stories out there, it's basically Havok as James Dean. Havok & Wolvie go down to Mexico to party and highjinx ensue. Good stuff"
xmen,37ssin,xooxanthellae,10,Sat May 30 08:28:20 2015 UTC,"Oh x-men is just more interesting and has better characters.  It's not that the avengers are bad guys, it's just that the x-men are better.  All the fun interesting stuff they're doing with the avengers now is because they support the movie universe.  All stuff that's been done better in x-men already."
xmen,37ssin,autorazr,3,Sat May 30 14:22:17 2015 UTC,"This has nothing to do with AvX as I haven't read much of it, but I have been a fan of the Xmen since I was a young child because of the 90's cartoon.  I like the Xmen a lot more as there are so many different mutants and different powers, the school/institute is always going through something and most of them aren't stupidly rich.  I like the Avengers too but not as much. They are a more solid team and it just seems a bit boring to me."

xmen,37ssin,capedcamish,2,Tue Jun 9 13:22:44 2015 UTC,"Notwithstanding /u/ScubaSteeeve 's excellent answer (which is really the long and short of it, from a market perspective), I think there are other fundamental differences that account for the hate.  Fundamentally, to my mind, they are opposites. The Avengers are government-sponsored, military and have an interest in the status quo. They are the equivalent of an over-weaponized police force. The X-Men whole existence, on the other hand, is revolutionary, paramilitary and predicated upon changing a world that has become a tinderbox of racial tension. They want to change the world for the better. The Avengers, however, want the world to not get blown up.  Now admittedly, this is extremely over-simplified (and more often than not, wrong, when you actually read the comics), but the cultural associations people ave with these properties usually break along these lines. The Avengers are classical superheroes fighting to defend the world from external threats. When you actually read the comics, though, they aren't the jack-booted, fascist thugs people often think of them as. They're just superheroes punching stuff.   Conversely (and funnily enough), the X-Men spent most of their early history as complete Uncle Toms, fighting to police their own race in order to protect the public from the perception that they couldn't assimilate with humans. They weren't trying to change the world--they were just trying to keep unruly mutants from hurting humans and making other mutants look bad. In the early 60's, they have no idea what to do with the first human villain they encounter. They actually let him go precisely because they don't feel right beating up on non-mutants. Moreover, the very first hate crime against mutants ever shown in the comics was in UXM #3, when the X-Men attack The Blob for refusing to join them. They make fun of his weight (which is tantamount for insulting him for his inborn mutant power) and try to beat the guy into submission. Also, the early X-Men were (like the Avengers) actually government-sponsored for a little while (and this lasted even a while after the anti-mutant hysteria angle kicked in).  All this notwithstanding, and several revisionist interpretations later, we associate the X-Men as anti-authoritarian (and sometimes, anti-government and terroristic), and we associate the Avengers with totalitarian power, the militarized police state, and the notion that our rights are subservient to our safety.  Basically, culturally speaking, the Avengers are dicks."

I remember seeing it on a card in the 90s was one of my favorite images back then. If not exact it is extremely faithful style wise to the art of that series/ artist.
xmen,37qukb,hotdoug1,3,Fri May 29 17:43:15 2015 UTC,It is part of Secret Wars. Basically they live in an area on Battleworld that is based on the cartoon series. Battle world is ruled by Doom.

xmen,37pa4f,mikeyshmikey,3,Fri May 29 09:30:37 2015 UTC,"You should judge the second trilogy separately from the first. With a story as large as the X almost everything you're mentioning is pure luxury:   Master Mold cannot be used without Bolivar Trask and the Askani. The Askani cannot be used without Cable nor Madelyne Pryor. Possibly leaving the door open for Strife, and the Legacy Virus. Psylocke must be set first if you want to portray the relationship with Archangel. You're also going to need Revanche, Kwannon, Matsuo, The Hand, The Siege Perilous, The Crimson Elixir... Moira opens up possibility for Legion, Banshee, Black Tom. And the Claremont/Lee Rubicon story.   It's not about what you consider to be essential. Movies are largely made for non-comic book fans, preserving as much as possible of the character but acting as a distilled, refined version. Same for stories. It'd take at least a decade to set up the Dark Phoenix Saga, and pretty much anything that derives from it. So what consultors and movie directors do is the difficult job of concentrating as much as possible from a character/story into a 2-3 hour format.  Your constraints are real-world ones, while your characters are not. Simple as that."
xmen,37pa4f,SexyPoro,3,Sat May 30 01:40:32 2015 UTC,"People forget that the early X-Men films were made on fairly limited budgets by the standards of summer blockbusters. According to box office mojo, X-Men was budgeted at 75 million and X2 at 115 million. In comparison, the first two Spiderman films which were produced around the same time were budgeted at 139 million and 200 million respectively. According to IMDB, the appearances of Nightcrawler and Beast in the film series were delayed because the filmmakers couldn't initially afford their special effects. If they couldn't afford for Beast to even appear on screen, they were not going to be showing sentinels. That's one of the advantages of comics and cartoons over films. You aren't constrained by real world limitations."
xmen,37pa4f,Alonna_Reese,0,Sun May 31 04:51:01 2015 UTC,"That's a very good point. But perhaps special effects money wasted on having the body of Senator Kelly turned into water, the spinning tower that gave Rogue her white streak of hair, everything related to Phoenix, etc, could have been better implemented. It's a mistake to assume that special effects and explosions amount to a successful film when there is such a rich plot to explore. Granted, scenes featuring Sentinels require vast sums of money to be executed nicely on-screen, but what is more important to the average X-men fan - special effects and explosions, or rich plots? The not-as-""nice"" plots that we got were still expensive.   PS - Perhaps hiring Frasier to play Beast was a mistake given budget constraints. Most of the casting is excellent for the movie, but tradeoffs..."

I think that he totally hornswaggled us into believing that if Mystique's X-gene were incapacitated, she would look like a baseline human. That, to me, was a serious case of white-washing. Why would her powers be both the ability to shape-shift AND an alternate form?"
xmen,37pa4f,Breezyb15,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:37:04 2015 UTC,"Yea, the portrayal of Storm,  the Pheonix saga and Havok being in the first class bugged me more than anything.

Discarding family especially is a big no no in my book as far as characters from books to movies go. I know the movies want to separate from the books but the X-men and Ironman 3 really screwed that up."

xmen,37pa4f,zninjazero,0,Wed Jun 3 12:33:18 2015 UTC,"I'd say the biggest problem is that X-men is a team franchise. It's right there in the title: X-men.   But we haven't had a proper team since X2.    X3 was The Wolverine show and sucked likewise Origins First class had a team, but they were all just terrible characters. Xavier has never been an interesting character, so making him the lead was a bad call. Magneto was good though Dofp had a mix of the above problems, but with a decent future roster that was just in the movie long enough to get slaughtered.    Thing is, save for X3 and Origins, I wouldn't call them bad, there just isn't much that's good about them. A lot of wasted potential"

xmen,37dqjc,SMB73,1 point,Thu May 28 13:27:02 2015 UTC,"Age of Ultron has a villain that poses no threat ever to the team, created by sheer arrogance and stupidity (hey, this thing has alien AI, nothing can go wrong if I fuse it and use it as my main AI for my entire robot army!).  But you don't have to believe me, head over to Rotten Tomatoes please, where your shitty Age of Ultron has 74% percent (and going lower by the day) and X:Men - Days of Future Past has had 91% for ages (slowly increasing, actually).  Avengers II is inconsecuential. Same for The First Avenger and Iron-Man 2.   Besides, it was Fox that saved Marvel's ass during Marvel's bankruptcy. It was Marvel's decision to sell X's rights to survive the  market crash they helped create in the nineties. Fox is doing a great job, while Marvel keeps cancelling X stuff simply because they can't have their characters back."
xmen,37dqjc,SexyPoro,-1,Thu May 28 20:04:22 2015 UTC,"So because in your mind they have ONE good film and Fox is totally forgiven for X-Men 1, 2 & 3, Wolverine Origins, The Wolverine, and Fantastic Four 1 & 2?!? First Class was mediocre but still couldn't even get the original team right or develop a convincing villain.   Marvel has the right to do whatever they want with their properties. They want their properties back because Fox does nothing but insult the brand with their horrible story telling. You're in the minority thinking people like Fox having the rights, it's almost obscene. I'm sorry, but it's true."

It's not like Marvel hasn't had any bad movies. In any case, they want their brand out of pure greed, if they cared about their characters Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver would still be mutants, and X's merchandise would not get cancelled this quick.

xmen,37dqjc,ChurchBrimmer,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:02:59 2015 UTC,"Is it really too much?   You tell me. Keep in mind everything you're going to have to introduce, because regular people vastly outnumbers comic book fans and you'll want to have access to that market: The O5, the mutants, Scott/Jean relationship, the M'Kraan crystal, White Queen, Jason Wyngarde, the rest of the Hellfire Club, the Shi'Ar, the Kree, the Skrull, the Blue Area of the Moon, Lilandra and the Imperial Guard, and finally Phoenix and Dark Phoenix.  You can cut the Crystal away, the Kree, the Skrulls without too much issue, but anything else and you'll end up compromising the fidelity of the story to the source.  You can cut the Hellfire Club away and use a self-fulfilling prophecy via the Shi'Ar to make Phoenix turn into Dark Phoenix (""We have come to pass judgement upon Jean Grey, earthlings""). Comic book fans all around the world will be enraged, public at large will probably point at the moral conundrum of punishing a potential threat, critics will draw parallels to the apparent morality shift of this era and, for the most part, they won't care the original story was mutilated just to be presentable for the masses and affordable by the studios.  Hard sell, tbh. Not even LotR managed to keep its integrity in its movie epic version."
xmen,37dqjc,SexyPoro,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:07:37 2015 UTC,"I never said I want it dead accurate. However is it too much to ask for a good version of the Dark Phoenix Saga? The old 90s cartoon did it very well in roughly the length of a movie, and that was on a program for children."
xmen,37dqjc,SMB73,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:37:27 2015 UTC,"For animations you need a 50-60 person team at most plus voices, and you're good to go.  For movies you're gonna need actors, cameramen, a director, a writing team, a CG team, a sound team... could be 300 to a thousand, probably more people.  Comparing the requirements of a cartoon to those of a movie is like comparing the building processes of a BMX to those of a Chevrolet FNR. Yes, both end up as vehicles, but their productions are entirely different beasts.  EDIT: Just counted the names in the post-credits X-Men animated series: 120. Pretty sure you can get by nowadays with modern animation techniques using even less. The Iron-Man movie lists 3,310 crew members; The Avengers had 2,718. Typical CG crews are around 120 (just for CG).  Entirely different beasts, pal."

Bishop in DoFP (again, with the wrong powers).  Making Emma Frost a glorified Bond Girl when she is one of the most complicated, duplicitous characters in the X-Men Universe was a HUGE fail.

xmen,3735lu,Liam4242,1 point,Mon May 25 19:31:13 2015 UTC,"Reason 1: Every mutant has limitations on their power. But when Gambit becomes a horseman for Apocalypse (I believe ""Death"", gotta double-check though), it's revealed that Gambit has no limit to the amount of energy he can charge an object with (insert loophole for never-ending increase of entropy of the universe here). He has the potential to be the strongest mutant - period!  Reason 2: The card-on-fire gimmick is kind of childish. Nostalgia aside, his backstory (regarding the Thieves Guild) and how that helped him train his stealth tactics is interesting. Even the old SNES game ""Mutant Apocalypse"" alludes to this, and note he also carries a staff. He's a versatile fighter. His mysterious backstory (unlike Wolverine's) means that you don't know whether he can be trusted or not, which is why the animated series features a plot executed by shape-shifting Mystique to frame him; no other mutant could pull this off. Similarly, who else could invade Genosha and remove the power-preventing necklaces.  Reason 3: Although I don't like him for this reason, he and Rogue make a good match.

xmen,373jyd,complexevil,2,Sun May 24 15:27:33 2015 UTC,"I would suggest all new x-men and the current run on uncanny, as it's reasonably simple, but it's quite cyclops-centric (even though I really enjoy it).  Maybe try Astonishing X-men by Joss Whedon. Thats pretty simple, and though he Cyclops does feature heavily the team dynamic is balanced, so you don't get too much of one character.   If you want really easy to follow classic stuff try early era Chris Claremont stuff.  http://www.amazon.com/X-Men-Dark-Phoenix-Chris-Claremont/dp/0785164219/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1432492203&sr=8-1&keywords=dark+phoenix+saga  http://www.amazon.com/Astonishing-Whedon-Cassaday-Ultimate-Collection/dp/0785161945/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1432492186&sr=8-1&keywords=astonishing+x-men"

Those are best but expensive to read in color unless you get the Essential volumes in B&W which I did, and hated. That being said, if you want something newer and relatively affordable I've been reading Ultimate Comics X-men which ties in with Ultimate Comics The Ultimates and Cataclysm. I'm really enjoy both series together so far, and am up to issue 21 on each. It's the only newer X-men series I've read so I can't compare to others, but I think it's good and gives you an intro to the characters somewhat. Also many of the classic characters are missing including Wolverine (but his son is there instead. I'm not sure what series he died in that led to this timeline though).   EDIT - Note this is not to be confused with ""Ultimate X-men"" it's Ultimate Comics X-men. Stupid, I know. I think Ultimate X-men is the series that led up to this timeline. Something with Magneto and a flood."

xmen,36qbad,Coding_Bad,3,Thu May 21 07:28:28 2015 UTC,"Before I write anything, I'm going to assume your friend does not read any comics and has an average outsider understand of X-Men.  Personally I still have a very very soft spot for the first X-Men and I'll level with you: it may have aged a good bit 15 years after, but it doesn't throw everything at you all at once. It eases you in, it tries to show you this reality but also with mutants, makes it a believable world, shows you Wolverine's and Rogue's struggles, the Xavier/Magneto friendship conflict, sets a lot of things up. Some of the effects date it, but the political story I think is still just as relevant now as it was then, as was the emotional story involving Rogue, and some of the action scenes still look pretty cool. If nothing else, it's an introduction and could make interesting trivia talk (""Darth Maul plays Toad, that's why he does that twirl thing with that rod."" ""Can you believe people got mad that they made fun of the comics' brightly colored costumes?"" ""Sabretooth played Michael Myers in the Rob Zombie remakes, he fits the part!"" ""See Wolverine clawing around the Statue of Liberty? Those yells were because his harness was stuck in his crotch."" ""That lightning line was Joss Whedon's only contribution to the script they kept and they said it wrong!"")  I wouldn't start with First Class because it does seem more a period piece, not just an origin movie. Unless that's something they're into? It does have the goofy yellow/blue costumes the comics, and though I haven't seen it in its entirety I've heard it's one of the best X-Men movies out there. However, it doesn't have that many recognizable characters, and I don't know. The filmverse likes to take itself seriously and I don't know if First Class would carry that tone that well; a good movie doesn't necessarily make a memorable movie, and the wrong movie might give the wrong impression about a series.  It's incredibly unfortunate that the X-Men film franchise has had as bad continuity as it has because no matter what movie you choose, when the newcomer works their way to/from Origins or First Class, they might have problems wrapping their thoughts around some of the inconsistencies. Whatever you do, don't show them Days of Future Past until the end because it really is sort of the culmination of everything in the filmverse, even as convoluted and out-of-nowhere it pulls its various workings from. It's the end of a journey: we've been through 15 years with some of these characters, the original trilogy cast worked damn hard for their emotional ending, and your friend deserves to see some of the aforementioned continuity issues before seeing them get erased. Otherwise, what's the point of seeing any of the other movies?"
xmen,36qbad,ryanson209,1 point,Thu May 21 07:59:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the very well thought out response.   It eases you in, it tries to show you this reality but also with mutants, makes it a believable world, shows you Wolverine's and Rogue's struggles, the Xavier/Magneto friendship conflict, sets a lot of things up.   Thats a very good point that I did not consider. It is a real shame that we don't see much of Rogue beyond this movie.   Darth Maul plays Toad   I had no idea! That is awesome.   I wouldn't start with First Class because it does seem more a period piece, not just an origin movie.    First Class may be a bad idea as a first movie. But it does setup the characters and it can stand independently by itself without any need to watch the other movies. I have not watched it in awhile so I'm not sure how good it still is.   Whatever you do, don't show them Days of Future Past until the end because it really is sort of the culmination of everything in the film verse, even as convoluted and out-of-nowhere it pulls its various workings from.   But its really only the end to us that have been on this ride for the last 15 years, is it not? This movie reset everything so that they could try to retell the story without so much continuity problems. In a way its a new beginning, like they are rebooting the series. Though I totally agree that ride to this movie was worth it, it may almost be pointless now except for the backstory of Wolverine.  Which is a shame to say that because there was a lot of great moments to be had in the trilogy. I think I may try to start with 1. I will defiantly have to address that this movie was made in 2000."
xmen,36qbad,ryanson209,1 point,Thu May 21 08:28:46 2015 UTC,"I actually (well, not ME but my friends and I) watched DoFP as a group on DVD and some of us hadn't seen it yet. Their reactions don't represent everyone's, but if I'm remembering right, they said they could follow the story okay but that they wish they had watched the series up to then.   To be fair, Days of Future Past doesn't have to be the last one, even though in my opinion it really feels like it could/should be. Since a new X-Men movie will be released next year involving the First Class/Days of Future Past cast and characters, you could start with First Class, continue with Days of Future Past, and then if they're interested, go to the X-Men trilogy and 2013's The Wolverine. My only problem with that is that the movie begins with the original cast and ends with an epilogue focusing almost entirely on them. But it's a new plot and most of the action does take place in the past... I guess that's another thing that's great about DoFP. Is it a series finale? Is it a reset button? Is it just another sequel? Why not all?  (Origins Wolverine is only if they're REALLY interested in being a completionist)"

Then all of a sudden he is peter dinklage in days of future past. I dont think dinklage did a good job either. Mainly cause I feel he isnt a great actor. hes done well in game of thrones but thats what the role called for i always feel like a short person in a movie is just trying to force him into a role.

These alternate cuts are typically what directors envision and what the movie should be if it weren't for Hollywood's editorial pipeline.   Film executives tend to water-down products for mass consumption. These extended editions are the original, concentrated version. If anything, don't buy the first pass; this cut has been mentioned since the film hit theaters."

xmen,36dpkc,okungnyo,27,Mon May 18 15:57:00 2015 UTC,"This is just a guess, mind you....    Secondary Mutations sometimes take a while to manifest. We know from the comics that SecMut is a thing, but it sometimes waits years or even decades before it appears.  It's possible that Kitty didn't manifest her time-tripping ability until later in life."
xmen,36dpkc,6isNotANumber,12,Mon May 18 16:49:38 2015 UTC,That and we can understand that timetravel is not this fully understood thing that they would do because they have a big problem coming up in a few years. As we saw in DOFP for a while they were on track for an even darker version of the future after changing the past for the worst. So they wouldn't even consider time travel an option until they had no other choice.
xmen,36dpkc,kill_dano,7,Mon May 18 18:20:55 2015 UTC,That's also a good point.   Time-travel should only ever be used as a last resort. The potential for catastrophic screw-ups is just too high.
xmen,36dpkc,6isNotANumber,7,Mon May 18 18:23:49 2015 UTC,"I assumed that Kitty's ability to control time is tied to her phasing ability, but she phases through not just 3 dimensions, but 4.   I don't think it requires a secondary mutation - Just greater control and discovery of her powers."
xmen,36dpkc,Vinnie_Vegas,5,Mon May 18 22:41:09 2015 UTC,"Equally possible.    See the edit...    EDIT: Upon reflection, while you could be right, I don't think you are.  Here's a couple of reasons why:  Kitty's phasing ability has always been tied directly to her physicality.  Anything she can touch will phase with her.  Her time-tripping power, OTOH, seems to work in a very different manner.  From what we're shown & what is actually said in DoFP, Kitty can only send the minds of other people backward in time, and there's nothing that clearly indicates that she's capable of sending someone forward.  Additionally, it doesn't appear that she can phase while she's ""broadcasting"" or else she & Bishop [and later Wolverine] wouldn't have needed defending when the Sentinels attacked.  To use an example from the comics, when Emma Frost shifts into diamond form her psychic abilities are cut off until she reverts [not sure how much of that came across in First Class, I'll have to rewatch it soon Thanks to /u/kenba2099 for confirming that Emma's powers work the same way in XM1C.  Nice catch, amigo!]. Based on that, I think we can reasonably assume that a Secondary Mutation cancels out the Primary while in use. Therefore, it seems to me that Kitty's time-tripping ability is wholly separate from her ability to phase and thus, qualifies as a Secondary Mutation."
xmen,36dpkc,6isNotANumber,2,Mon May 18 22:43:49 2015 UTC,"Emma says she can't do telepathy while in diamond form, and at one point she turns deliberately so Charlie can't read her mind."

xmen,36dpkc,monkeymosh88,18,Mon May 18 20:39:08 2015 UTC,"I would suggest not thinking too hard about the continuity between the X-movies.  Just try to enjoy them on their own merits, rather than trying to figure out how they all line up."

xmen,36dpkc,sirgraemecracker,2,Tue May 19 16:37:47 2015 UTC,The strength in the comics is much like the MCU captures: long term story telling. I'm just reading the X titles from 95 ish and the Onslaught story has been bubbling since 92 when Bishop first arrived.

xmen,367s63,ssjAWSUM,12,Sun May 17 10:14:27 2015 UTC,"Now I don't think that's the case. But if it did happen. I would walk out of the theater and sit down for an hour. Pay for another movie ticket and watch the rest of the film.   My mind would be slow blown that I would be unable to reconcile it all.  Now back to what I usually do.   As FC noted, she's going to age slower due to her powers. Beast tells us this. So when she loses them, her body will shift to the age it's currently stuck in. From that point forward she would have aged normally if you know the cure took.   So her longevity is mutant powers. It's the gift of her shape shifting.  Now my theory is that Mystique is just super damn good at figuring out faces. Think about it. She just needs to look at a person and she get's all of their features. It's possible that she can extrapolate what her human form would look like and also what her older adult form would.  Now obviously not hair color either.   also I bet she's altering her Mystique form as well.   Other then that, I have no clue. Too much damn coincidence."

Some people look in the mirror and imagine a person who is taller or prettier or ""cooler"" or more  desirable.  It's a given that mystique ages at a very slow rate, but that doesn't mean that she has to look her age.  This theory assumes that Rebecca Romijn  with black hair is what she really looks like. But what if that's what she chose to look like we her last bit of power?  The whole point of that scene in X3 was to show that even as beautiful as she was (or she thought she was) Magneto desired her for her power. This point is proven again in First Class when she tries to seduce him.  Mystique can look like anyone, but she doesn't know who she is. Her self image is reflected upon beauty standards, and I would imagine would also change with  the times.  With such a complex character and writing that doesn't regard its own canon there's sure to be plot holes and mix ups but I feel like they were beating us over the head a bit with her vanity"

xmen,367de9,x-mencollector,4,Sun May 17 08:18:22 2015 UTC,I would be fine with this just being the case in the MCU. The fact that there are rumors of them basically replacing mutants in the comics as well makes me hate everything about Inhumans
xmen,367de9,spreeforall,0,Sun May 17 13:03:51 2015 UTC,They are giving more atention to them because of the MCU. But mutants and inhumans are very different in the comics. The only thing they have in common is that they are powered people living on Earth.

What makes Kit Harrington a palpable  male Jean Grey? His deep, husky voice? His curly, dark-brown hair? His broad build? Are these just people that you spotted in an volume of US Weekly?"
xmen,361nj3,stratargy,1 point,Sat May 23 20:41:50 2015 UTC,"Just because his voice is deep & husky in GoT doesn't make it that way in real life. I picked him because he's young, his hair is wavy, not curly, he's of a solid, athletic build but he's not overly large (again, go google some images that aren't GoT), and because he moves gracefully which is one of the main things I felt embodied Jean Grey.  Yes, his hair is brown but how the hell does that matter in this picture when hair colour can be easily changed? Are you instead going to pick one of the many graceful, pretty and strong male redheads like Seth Green or Rupert Grint? lol"
xmen,361nj3,fortalyst,1 point,Sun May 24 00:17:00 2015 UTC,What's wrong with Rupert Grint? There is an angularity (in the face?) to Jean that may or may not be met in the genderbent form by Kit Harington. Idk. What abut Eddie Redmayne?
xmen,35zgio,GoldandBlue,11,Thu May 14 20:27:13 2015 UTC,"I'd kind of hope for the group that I think of as the core New Mutants team - Danielle, Karma, Sunspot, Magik, Cannonball, Rahne, maybe Cypher and Warlock, and I guess Magma, although she never felt as important and her visuals overlap a bit with Cannonball and Sunspot. I feel like Warlock has Groot-like breakout character potential, if they do him well.  It might be fun to mix in other ""kid"" characters from different eras - the X-movies have clearly demonstrated that they're willing to pull people from different points in chronology and have them be contemporaries - but there's nobody I'd single out. (I love Iara, but that might look a little silly on-screen, and Rahne has the animalistic shapeshifting thing already.)"
xmen,35zgio,Daiteach,3,Thu May 14 22:42:12 2015 UTC,So would they ignore the previous Sunspot like they did with Angel? Sucks for that actor. I would love to see Cannonball and Magik.

xmen,35zgio,living-silver,4,Sat May 16 08:40:32 2015 UTC,"Unlike most people who complain about the cina-x-verse, I would love to see a complete miss-mashed team of random teen mutants from various eras. we already have two fantastic series featuring the original 7; a movie is a great opportunity to explore other character dynamics (which I hope are the same character personalities).  I would love to see Multiple Man, Siren, and Strong Guy join Wallflower, Kiden Nixon, Anol, Elixer, Boom Boom, Eye Boy, and Quentin Quire. Throw in original New Mutants Dani Moonstar, Doug and Warlock and you have one hell of a crazy crew that will have no choice but to get into trouble."
xmen,35zgio,Daiteach,3,Fri May 15 04:24:40 2015 UTC,"whatever team they use, I hope they fill it with plenty of female characters. the one thing that x-books have that no other comic book franchise in history has is a buttload of awesome, interesting, diverse female characters.   Runaways is the runner up, but even they can't compete with the sheer number of great x-characters.  (Karma, Mirage, Monet, Boom Boom, Skids, Wolfsbane, Blink, Husk, Wallflower, Mercury, Surge, Siryn, Blindfold, Loa, and Wind Dancer are just a few of my favorite ""student"" characters (off the top of my head))"
xmen,35zgio,YaBoyRonJovi,3,Fri May 15 04:38:20 2015 UTC,"Icould not agree more. It is dissapointing that the franchise has Jean Grey, Storm, Kitty, Rogue, and more yet they dont take advantage of it. Especially with how much women are demanding to be a part of the superhero world. The X-Men could have delivered a decade ago."
xmen,35zgio,Helmet_Icicle,1 point,Fri May 15 06:58:39 2015 UTC,"I think Storm is sort of emblematic of the fact that, while it's great that the movies feature more female characters, they often get shunted to the side in terms of character moments and character development. In the first X-Men movie, for example, Wolverine gets to be the point of view character, the rebel, the badass. Cyclops, as his foil, gets to be pretty well-developed and fleshed out, as does Xavier. Jean Gray kind of gets stuck as just the love triangle pivot, however, and Storm is just kind of... present. It's not that they're not powerful (the movie makes it clear that Jean and Ororo are much heavier hitters than Scott), and it's not that they don't get to participate in the plot (they do), they're just not that well-defined. For Jean, that's maybe kinda understandable, since she has gone periods of time with a kind of unremarkable personality, but Ororo has always had a very strong and very clear characterization. That characterization shifts as she grows as a person (or retreats as a person) and works to synthesize the different parts of her life, but she's never just ""and this other person there to kind of fill things out."" The movies kind of miss that. (And given that we know that Halle Berry is a terrific actress with a lot of range, I don't know where exactly to put the blame for that.)  The X-Men comics (once you get out of the Silver Age) have generally been really good about making sure men and women are both present and both depicted as cool and powerful. They've also generally* been good about actually developing women characters as actual people, which is not something that superhero comics as a whole have always done a particularly good job of. Storm has never just been the generic chick or the love interest or (just) the pin-up, and while characters like that are more and more common, X-Men series have helped push the industry forward in that regard. (Not without some missteps, of course, but nothing's perfect.) The original New Mutants was a HUGE part of that. Not only does it have teens that are actually written vaguely like real teens (for teens not written even vaguely like real teens, see Silver Age X-Men**), but it has teen girls written like real teen girls.  *Generally. There's always going to be a Psylocke here and there.  ** I'm not sure what Silver Age X-Men are written like. They have a sort of odd old-timey-ness to them; Like, I realize that they're from the 60's, but even by those standards they seem old-timey. The formula for Lee-Kirby X-Teens seems to be something like ""they're basically adults, except that sometimes Bobby will do something childish."""
xmen,35zgio,bakemonosan,1 point,Sun May 17 02:41:43 2015 UTC,"That is a hollywood problem. The movies have that problem because Wolverine is our POV character. I don't count Silver Gae X-Men but the thing that made the team work was that we got everyone's perspective. First Class managed to improve this when they made the Xavier/Magneto dynamic the focal point.            In the movies, like you said, Storm and Kitty have no connection to our hero so they just exist. Fox has improved but the franchise is still carrying the anchor of the original films around its neck which is why they feel off despite improving in quality. My hope is by creating a new team they can treat it a bit more like the X-Men we know."

xmen,35zgio,TheseMenArePrawns,4,Fri May 15 02:32:48 2015 UTC,? Darwin needs to be redeemed because....? And he needs to be inflicted on the New Mutants because...?
xmen,35zgio,JZA1,2,Fri May 15 04:01:01 2015 UTC,The fact that he died was the worst bullshit I've ever seen them pull in any comic-to-movie adaptation.  Darwin's mutant power means his body evolves to adapt to ANY situation.  Darwin has survived encounters with The Hulk and yet Shaw kills him within a few seconds of meeting him.
xmen,35zgio,stratargy,1 point,Fri May 15 04:23:55 2015 UTC,"I think that his power is such that his resurrection could be easily explained (i.e. his body adapted to being blown apart and could reform itself). I also think that bringing back dead characters in movie franchises requires some solid purpose for that character to fulfill. And unless they were taking some crazy turn for a Krakoa storyline, I don't see why Darwin would be that necessary.  On the other hand, if you're saying it was bullshit that they inexplicably killed the black guy mutant first, then yeah. That was fucked up."
xmen,35zgio,JZA1,1 point,Sun May 17 14:14:25 2015 UTC,"It'd make sense given that his first real appearance in the comic was after he'd been thought long dead. It might feel cheap, but a quick handwave of ""his power fused him with"" or ""his power just turned him incorporeal for a few decades to escape"" would be an easy fix. You'd just have to have a writer who actually wanted the character back."
xmen,35zgio,stratargy,1 point,Fri May 15 11:44:45 2015 UTC,"I think they should just go with most of the original team.  Characters like Karma and Dani Moonstar have abilities relating to mind control and illusions, so these should be fairly low budget to depict on TV or movies.  Wolfsbane would probably work too since the transformation would basically be similar to what's already been done in werewolf movies.  I'd probably drop Cannonball at least until the budget increased to the point where his blast field would look good.  I'd replace him with Magik, since her sorcery and teleportation powers would be a bit easier to depict (just explain away low-budget sorcery like she's still working on her skills), plus her character is a tie-in to a character who's already shown up in the movies, and hopefully Colossus could make appearances from time-to-time too.    Not sure if it would ever happen, but I think it could be epic if they got someone like Jim Carrey (high budget) or Donald Glover (low budget) to do a mo-cap performance for a CGI Warlock character.  If not either of those, a similarly rubbery actor.  A CGI Warlock character could have plenty of cool moments in a New Mutants movie or series."
xmen,35zgio,JZA1,1 point,Thu May 14 22:30:49 2015 UTC,"I think that making the New Mutants work would absolutely depend on making the quality of the effects of Cannonball, Sunspot, Magma, and (to a lesser extent) Magik's powers comparable to the quality of the physical effects in Guardians of the Galaxy or the Avengers. Nixxing Cannonball from a story involving the original team would be weird."
xmen,35zgio,stratargy,1 point,Fri May 15 04:07:47 2015 UTC,The rest of the X-movies didn't follow similar lineups from the comics.
xmen,35zgio,mizzlemazzle,1 point,Fri May 15 04:16:24 2015 UTC,That's valid. Those movies did change lineups. But leaving Cannonball out of the first New Mutants would be tantamount to leaving Cyclops out of the first X-Men movies.
xmen,35zgio,Stjesus,1 point,Sun May 17 14:10:03 2015 UTC,Why not?  Have one of the female characters be the lead in a New Mutants movie.  I would want them to save Cannonball for when the budget can really give a good depiction of that blast field.
xmen,35zgio,JohnnyNewspaperseed,1 point,Sun May 17 19:35:06 2015 UTC,"It's has nothing to do with gender. I think that in any iteration, the story would revolve around either Dani or Illyana as the central protagonist. Cyclops was not the lead in any of the X-films, but he is a critical team member in most main X-teams. Cannonball is similarly positioned within the New Mutants."

I just hope that they team up with Marvel Studios and can somehow shoehorn this into an official MCU film. Despite my personal reservations about the treatment of this underserved but ostensibly solid team, Fox could turn the series around with this expansion similar to how Marvel boosted sales with the original New Mutants.   The New Mutants represent Xavier's dream arguably more than the original and the All-New, All-Different X-Men because they were from a distinctly different generation than their elder counterparts. They evidenced, for the first time, that the idea of training young mutants could be continued and improved. Fox first attempted a similar story with their ""Generation X"" TV Movie. Outside of that venture, these characters are stories are relatively new territory in the broader media formats.   If Fox and Marvel Studios team up for this, I would be excited to see them break new grounds in storytelling."

It was weak compared to the Sokovia scenes from Avengers: Age of Ultron and (obviously) the NYC/wormhole scenes from The previous Avengers film.  DOFP and FC are no doubt well-shot films, but there is a cumbersome and clunky nature in the production that is just non-existent in the Marvel Studios films. Part of it comes from the chemistry between the actors, to be sure. Joss Whedon is probably better than Bryan Singer at directing actors playing Marvel characters because (a) he's an actual creative storyteller familiar with producing realist superhero/action/drama (Buffy, FireFly) who is (b) also been a  comic book writer who has (c) also written stories for Marvel about (d) Marvel characters. Singer may be a big fan, and he is arguably the director who did the most to enhance the quality of superhero/comic-based movies, but that does not compensate for the fluid connectivity that Whedon is able to infuse into the production process.   TL;DR: There are fundamental aspects of both film franchises that make it hard for the current X-films to be of the exact same quality as Avengers films."
xmen,35v13k,stratargy,1 point,Thu May 14 21:22:54 2015 UTC,"I meant Avengers level in terms of outcome, not production scale which doesn't necessarily guarantee a great movie. Nothing in AoU matched DOFP or the first Avengers for me, least of all the climax that, while looking great, didn't really have the same stakes the future of DOFP gave by having the sentinels systematically kill each team member twice. The first Avengers was marginally better than DOFP for me, though beneath Iron Man 1 in the MCU overall IMO. I have zero idea what you mean when you talk about Whedon getting more realistic superhero drama - neither Avengers movie had the realism DOFP's extinction scenes had to me; doing the same storyline, an MCU movie would need to have one-liners at every turn. X-Men always seemed much more grounded, even in the original Trilogy before Last Stand went full retard.  Whedon did write great X-Men stories, though. Shame Disney are destroying that brand as we speak now for the sake of the movies Whedon makes for them."

xmen,35v13k,ILendMyAxeToAll,1 point,Wed May 20 19:25:10 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing about fan service; when you try it, it may ensure that you (as producer, director, miscellaneous creator) may get some things right because your making the story based in the original medium (books) comport to the new medium (film) even though the two mediums are different. While it may be pandering in some ways, its at least nice to know that Marvel Studios can perform fan service from a decently honest place. They know exactly how to make their stories, written by their writers and artists, comport to a film medium that may be controlled by someone from outside. What's more, they can avoid that outside hire by putting someone at the helm who has experience in both mediums (Joss Whedon) and further ensure that the fans get a film that they can relate to and appreciate for what it is (a mashed-up, live-action retelling of a set of stories the fans have poured over for generations)."

xmen,35v13k,amoretpax199,1 point,Wed May 20 15:09:07 2015 UTC,"I don't even find Mystique's character extraordinarily compelling and I think that the way that Bryan Singer has treated her (in nearly every film) as if he had never read a single story involving her. He painted her as a simpering, hot-headed lackey who is dependent on men for everything, completely ignoring the facet of her character that is her complete independence based on the fact that she can always save herself by just shifting her form to that of something or someone else. Mystique is and always has been completely self-interested (evidenced in the stories by her relationships with all of her children). This personality trait is what supplants her power-based longevity. She is most certainly a survivor. Singer made her into a weakling. Thats just one example of how the films have sacrificed character design for ... idek what."

Magik has the Soulsword and Dani uses Psi weapons similarly to Psylocke (an effect that people are probably really looking forward to in the X-Men:Apocalypse film).  Wolfsbane is still a werewolf, even if she isn't being portrayed as violently as her later X-Force missions.

Issues #71 to about #95 or so featured a couple of stories that relied heavily on Wolverine under effects of some drug or another.  71-82 was about his time in Weapon X and makes reference to the amount of sedatives they need to use to keep him under.  83 - 90 something (I don't have it to hand immediately) is a story involving Cyber and hallucinogens and it's drawn by Sam Kieth and it's awesome.

If you're talking about Uncanny X-Men volume 3 - the one that's currently running, which had its number 1 in 2013, and has run alongside All-New X-Men... you probably could, but I don't think it's ideal. You could read the current run of Uncanny without reading the current run of All-New and it would mostly make sense in most places, but you'll have to accept that in a lot of places plot developments happened in the other book. There are spans where the two books are really tightly bound together, and there are spans where they're doing completely unrelated things, but if something doesn't make sense (like a character is suddenly on a different team), you might have to check a summary of an All-New issue to get filled in."

Despite her short screen time she seemed like quite a selfless character.  Least favourite: Probably a tie between Scott and Jean. What annoying characters (especially in the movies). The attitude they have...ugh.
xmen,35nblm,elysianism,2,Tue May 12 04:35:36 2015 UTC,"Favorite: Hellion (followed closely by Banshee and Dazzler) Least Favorite: Hope Summers aka Ginger Sue  I could go one for ages about all of these, so I'm just going to leave it at this."
xmen,35nblm,eljacobito,2,Mon May 11 23:08:51 2015 UTC,"Favorite: Cyclops (always has been). Recently developed a love for X-23 as well after reading all of her arcs.   Least favorite: disregarding worthless characters, Beast. He's a freaking annoying high horsed SOB and a gigantic hypocrite as well. That being said, I enjoy the vulnerable Beast that Nick Hoult plays."
xmen,35nblm,wreak_havok,2,Tue May 12 02:07:23 2015 UTC,"My reading background is basically most of the X-Men history through 2003 (I'm currently reading New/Uncanny/X-Treme X-Men from that era, working my way to present day)...  Favorite: Kitty Pryde because Claremont/Uncanny and Alan Davis/Excalibur.  Least favorite: Empath.  What a freaking jerk with a terribly inappropriate codename."

xmen,35nblm,SmilesUndSunshine,2,Thu May 14 03:28:22 2015 UTC,"Favorite is easily Jean. - Relatable character and easy to root for with her goodness. - Entertaining or occasionally humorous with her fiery side. - Great journeys, great feats, great falls. - Phoenix (though they have spent the last decade dragging that through the mud, turning it into some parasitic bird, and still continuing it here in Secret Wars).  Worst: Quire."
xmen,35nblm,cwatz,2,Tue May 12 22:23:54 2015 UTC,Beast is my favorite. I love how he doubles as a super smart scientist and a killing machine at the same time/ His origin story is just too cool and he just rips shit to shreds. Also I like the color blue :p  Least favorite is Marrow and Maggot for being useless and irrelevant
xmen,35nblm,Thedmatch,1 point,Mon May 11 23:39:59 2015 UTC,Yeesh. I respect your answer but have to disagree about Beast.   Out of first or second tier X-characters who do you dislike most?
xmen,35nblm,wreak_havok,2,Tue May 12 02:08:29 2015 UTC,"Favorite: Wolverine  Least favorite: Sabretooth  Sabretooth is such a tool! His petty vendetta against Logan shows the depth of his maniacal character. I always dread the storylines that try to redeem Creed. He's such an evil, murderous bastard, I see him as irredeemable. On the other side of the coin, Logan is / was a murderer, yes. But he is redeemed by his heroic actions and only taking lives of bad-dudes. Sabretooth just kills whoever he wants (women, children, etc), whenever he wants."

xmen,35nblm,TragicEther,1 point,Tue May 12 13:33:59 2015 UTC,"My favorite is Cyclops. His character arc is masterful. Becoming the exact thing you used to rally against (kind of)? Just beautifully crafted.   My least favorite of the main good-guy X-Men is Storm. I feel like they're writing her only to be a strong female character without much else in mind. At least with Beast, you more character depth. The past year or so of comics has had him both literally and figuratively dealing with his past and future self and trying to reconcile the sea of differences in between. He may be a hypocrite, but he's got character. Bobby's going through the same thing, and the gay thing's kind of out of left field, but I've always had heart for him because I'm a slacker and I'd probably be the same way if I had awesome powers like that. Kitty's kind of getting on my nerves with all of her flip-flopping which side of the X-Men she's supporting, and all that. It's like the writers don't know what to do with her, so they paint her as this unlucky-in-love-until-recently lady who has strong convictions that just so happen to change constantly. Also, I miss 90s Rogue. Don't know if anyone else feels similarly."
xmen,35nblm,Lighetto,1 point,Tue May 12 14:52:46 2015 UTC,Beak is my favourite - you just can't help but feel sorry for him.
xmen,35nblm,Mevansuto,1 point,Tue May 12 18:55:16 2015 UTC,Favorite: Kitty Pryde is objectively the best. Magik is one of the most badass. Jubilee is my personal favorite (so sue me).  Least favorite: Cable. He's the epitome of trying too hard.

But criminally under-utilised she's been Havok's handbag for years (you could almost hear someone ask ""where's Alex?"" when she enters the room) and had a personality of ""Jean Grey #2"". And let's talk about the dangling plot lines that's begging to be explored. Zaladane? Malice? Her secondary powers? Did she graduate with her geology studies? Lol.   Honorary mention for (male) Banshee for being extremely hot.   Least - x23. Didn't need her then don't need her now. Didn't care then don't care now."

xmen,35lzyc,living-silver,1 point,Sat May 16 22:48:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Quicksilver has never been a member of the X-Men. He was in X-Factor( the Val version),and he lived at the X-Mansion at a point, but he was never a member of the X-Men."
xmen,35lzyc,stratargy,1 point,Sun May 17 14:05:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing, but he was an X-Man in Age of Apocalypse, and didn't he go on an adventure or two with the team while he was staying in the mansion? Shouldn't those things count for something?"
xmen,35lzyc,living-silver,1 point,Mon May 18 00:43:41 2015 UTC,"He's most certainly been an ally. No one can take that away from him. Kind of like Lila Cheney, Gateway, or Shard (although the former 2 were/are actual members of the team, despite lack of Mansion tenancy). I don't see any of those folks sketched. Also, unlike all of the mutants mentioned above, Quicksilver was a villian, not unlike Mystique, who was a formal member of the team. I just think that the character has operated in a way that is more consistent with non-membership than with honorary membership. IF all of the X-Men were an LGBTQQIAA support group, Quicksilver would be an ""A"" (for ally)."
xmen,35lzyc,stratargy,1 point,Wed May 20 04:53:53 2015 UTC,"Eh. I'm not going to let that ""villain"" argument fly: both Colossus and Bishop were major x-villains at one point, and Rogue even started out as a villain (just like Quicksilver). The whole point of Rogue joining the team was that Xavier was a fan of redemption and giving second chances. Come to think of it, Wolverine was a villain too for a minute- that why he was outed as a hypocrite for not approving of Rogue joining the team.  So maybe Pietro may be relegated to ""ally"" status, but not because he was a villain.  edit: I just remembered that Archangel, Polaris, and Gambit were all Horsemen of Apocalypse, Havok abandoned X-Factor to join Dark Beast, and Xavier became Onslaught, meaning that half of the heroes pictured were villains at one time."

xmen,35noiw,garbeezy,2,Tue May 12 00:08:57 2015 UTC,"Comics can branch out from that event.  If you like you can go into Wolverine title to see what he does after, or quicksilver (son of M) and his story with the inhumans that go into the silent war.   That inhuman story then moves into secret invasion, then later, combine with several other stories, including some x-men as war of kings.  The decimation after house of m also deals with another mutant awoken by the event.  Deadly genesis is the storyline and it's quite good.  It's also the prelude to war of kings story line.    The immediate event after house of m is the decimation of mutants and how people dealt with that.  X-men the 198 was a good short lived series about how remaining mutants were confined to a reserve.  People say decimation as an event/arc was skippable.  I think it's still quite interesting as it dealt with the ""little people"" in the marvel universe.  Not only so, I really like X-factor and the story with quicksilver.  Later on in the marvel universe he flips between good/bad guy so it's nice to see his internal struggles.    Quite honestly, it really depends on what you want to explore.  After the house of m event, you can go into the mutant world, the avenger world, or other story lines dealing with people from out in space.  I heard there was an annihilation event out there as well that I didn't go into.  I believe it has to do with nova corp and guardians of the galaxy."

Also Scott asks Wolverine to form Xforce after Messiah X in order to protect mutants from threats yet to come. Imo Wolverine's run as the leader of xforce was really good. It's not a long series but it's really good. Actually it's pretty long. It has about 8 vols. Messiah War is a good read."

And he can change his shape like Mystique! And he can make his hands into swords and axes! And he can move super fast! And make force fields, but he can also shoot them at people! And he can teleport a building! And he's immortal! And he can fly!"""
xmen,35fazv,gunslinger81,6,Sun May 10 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"This is why villains like him or Doomsday, or Bane never really become special because there is nowhere to go. Doomsday killed Superman his first appearance, now what? Apocalypse is destined to rule the world so once he is beaten he has nowhere to go.                   This is why Magneto, Senator Kelly, or even William Stryker are so much better villains. They represent an idea. You can't punch an idea. You can't kill an idea."
xmen,35fazv,GoldandBlue,2,Sun May 10 06:50:51 2015 UTC,It's my issue with a lot of character's powers if not themselves. Sometimes it feels like they throw in 'flying brick' and then add in so much more from there to where a lot of characters feel indistinguishable powers-wise.
xmen,35fazv,Mickledom,4,Sun May 10 03:41:01 2015 UTC,If you want to see some actual scans from the comics of Apocalypse's powers I made the En Sabah Nur respect thread over in /r/respectthreads
xmen,35fazv,ChocolateRage,2,Sun May 10 06:06:28 2015 UTC,"Perhaps most importantly, Apocalypse is basically immortal. His body does not age, and, with the help of Celestial technology, he can enter a comatose state to regenerate from almost any wound. His blood is also capable of rewriting another organism’s DNA, and he can interface with technology, meaning that his existence can continue outside of his own physical form.   you can pretty much atomize his molecules and he will come back, given enough time (in this case, probably a couple centuries)  Its been said that comic Apocalypse was in suspended animation or something like that before the events that led to the AoA. Does anyone know if he got his ass kicked before that, to be asleep like he was? i know he was active in ancient Egypt, but im not sure what he has been up to since that."
xmen,35fazv,bakemonosan,1 point,Sun May 10 15:35:10 2015 UTC,"Nah, Apocalypse was first introduced in X-Factor in 1985, about ten years before AoA. He transformed Angel into Archangel and he was pivotal in the X-Cutioner's Song crossover. During the previous millennia, he was active in Victorian England as well as some other places. Chances are, he spent time going in and out of suspended animation, but he was still a player well before the AoA."

Following Marvel's success, Fox has been really stepping up their game. It does Marvel good to have to compete against their own property, especially one of their biggest titles.

xmen,35am5m,WSable,4,Fri May 8 22:32:19 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, we're at a period where we're starting a new event similar to AvX but on a somewhat bigger scale. Recently, though, you can snatch up both All-New X-Men and Uncanny X-Men (written by Bendis). I would stay away from the one that's just titled ""X-Men"". I have the first four tradepapers and I regret getting them because I can't get into it at all. Amazing X-Men is decent, and reads somewhat like a traditional X-Men book, but it's not as good as All-New or Uncanny, IMO.   If you're a fan of the character (and even if you're not) Magneto has been really good so far. There's also ""Wolverine and the X-Men"" (there were two runs of this almost back to back), and some of them are good. The current Spider-Man and the X-Men is okay, it's more of a ""fun"" thing so far."

I hadn't read Xmen in years and I was so excited (I know, sad) to see something completely different.  It was great until the ""battle of the atom"" crossover event.  The quality went down after that.  Bendis was building up to something awesome but Marvel cut him short and made him wrap up the storyline he had been building to... it seemed to feel so flat.  I stopped reading shortly after; I'm waiting for compilations in digital format before I get any more.  Edit: grammar corrections"

xmen,35am5m,puzzleddaily,1 point,Fri May 8 20:23:35 2015 UTC,Deadpool doesn't count. Deadpool and Invincible are the only comics I've completely kept up with over the last 5 or 6 years.
xmen,35am5m,Dorsid,1 point,Fri May 8 21:07:19 2015 UTC,Invincible is the best. I admit though I wasn't a huge Avengers comic fan but after Dark Reign and with Hickman's run they've been killing it. Out of my pull Avengers and Invincible are the ones I look forward to most. Also Saga.
xmen,35am5m,JohnnyNewspaperseed,1 point,Fri May 8 21:55:43 2015 UTC,"Spiderman and the Xmen was awesome, but just ended. Magneto has been great as well. Uncanny and All New opened strong and had a lot of potential, but the last half of both felt like they dragged on and ultimately accomplished nothing (although Black Vortex was great again). I think the few panels of Cyclops in Secret Wars showed him to be more revolutionary than Uncanny Ever did."

I've been catching up thru major old story arcs (astonishing, AvX, Schism, Regenesis, Death of Wolverine).   But you cant really go wrong with the sister pair All-New X-Men and Uncanny X-Men (most recent volumes). I say that because throughout the two books, they intertwine stories giving the two sided perspective of Cyclops and Kitty's (wolverine's) teams. plus its really fun seeing the original x-men as their younger selves interact with the seasoned varieties.   I'd like to add also that the Magneto stand-alone is pretty much consensus amazing."
xmen,35bs0i,EndoveProduct,5,Fri May 8 20:12:53 2015 UTC,"X2 is a better movie. Now as an X-Men film, DofP is truer to the comic. But X2 is a better movie and captures the essence in a very good way as far as what Mutants have to put up with."

xmen,35bs0i,sapi3nce,9,Fri May 8 20:59:32 2015 UTC,"I enjoy the spectacle of DoFP, but X2 seemed to personalize the hatred and fear people had for mutants. Bobby's family and Stryker had very clearly defined reasons for their actions. Trask hated mutants because.... Why? I was never clear on that.   X-Men is about the alienated finding each other and making their own family. X2 carried that idea fairly well."
xmen,35bs0i,vagabondhermit,7,Fri May 8 20:50:19 2015 UTC,He didn't hate mutants; he even said he admired them. He had a scientific approach and saw them as an enemy because he thought sooner or later they would expire us / try to exterminate humans; just like Homo Sapiens ended up killing (or genetically assmilating) the Neanderthals
xmen,35bs0i,jano-man,4,Fri May 8 21:46:26 2015 UTC,"Bryan Singer said in interviews that he cast Peter Dinklage in part because of his dwarfism, he thought that an interesting aspect of the character was that Trask was himself a mutant and that self-loathing led him to do what he does, it's not explicit in the film but it's some really interesting subtext. I'm sure Dinklage was cast primarily because he's a great actor however."

xmen,35bs0i,monkeymosh88,1 point,Sat May 9 13:14:31 2015 UTC,X2 was a great movie but DoFP was a great comic book movie. it was really well done and the story line was perfect. If you go back and look at the X-Men cartoon (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDM5s_JmVzE) you can see how close they followed the script. Not to mention how well played the characters were.
xmen,35al3i,Apophys421,2,Fri May 8 14:28:34 2015 UTC,"You didn't miss a lot because it barely featured the X-Men, basically the Black Vortex was kind of a cosmic version of the Siege Perilous, you go through it and you get cosmic powers but also lose all perspective on reality and turn evil maybe. They all fuck around for a while chasing after it and in the process Cyclops, Beast , Iceman and Angel all go through it getting costume changes and cosmic powers. Beast gets a spacesuit and more clever, Cyclops gets a big gold suit, Angel gets wings and Iceman becomes like a purple ice elf thing.   Then the planet of Spartax, where Peter Quill from Guardians Of The Galaxy is from, gets encased in amber and everyone there's gonna get Brood eggs in them and they can't run away because they're all ambery and stuck so Kitty goes through the Vortex and becomes all spacey and big so she can phase the amber off the planet, releasing everyone. This is as stupid as it sounds.   Kitty and Peter get married which has been building in Legendary Star-Lord since the Trial Of Jean Grey crossover and everyone gets changed back from the Vortex, apart from Kitty, who's off in space now, and Angel, who decides he doesn't want to become the dribbling mind-wiped idiot his future version of himself so keeps the changes.   Iceman, Cyclops and Beast are supposed to have had irrevocable changes from being transformed to and from their cosmic selves but really this has just amounted to minor costume changes and some psychological effects that probably will come up later. It's possible the Vortex turned Bobby gay but more likely Bendis is trying to sell it as that's how this version of Bobby always was."
xmen,35al3i,RaoulSeagull,5,Fri May 8 15:32:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, Wow that sounds like a mess. I think it may be time for Bendis to move on to another book, I'm  kinda done with his meandering plot lines and bad characterization."
xmen,35al3i,Zthe27th,3,Fri May 8 15:40:40 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear this wasn't Bendis crossover, it was Sam Humphries. If you want to blame someone, blame him."
xmen,35al3i,sapi3nce,6,Fri May 8 16:31:33 2015 UTC,"I wasn't really trying to start a Bendis hate circlejerk. I liked some of the elements to his story, and enjoy his dialog. I guess for me the last few years he's  been at the helm has been a lot of build up and no pay off. The revolution storyline just kinda limped on and on with no real resolution. The cyclops as a villain thing was an interesting set up but it kinda felt forced. I guess that's my real problem, it's  all build up and no pay off..and I'm all for decompressed storytelling but at times the story decompressed to the point of stopping.   Also it kept getting interrupted by events.   Anyways I didn't mean to piss off any Bendis fans, but for me personally I'm  done with him writing the x-men.  I didn't read any of the black vortex other than the x-titles so I didn't know Sam Humphries was writing the story. So in that case Sam H. Shouldn't be writing the x-men either. Just my thoughts on the matter."
xmen,35al3i,RaoulSeagull,4,Fri May 8 16:54:12 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the majority of his work has been fairly enjoyable these past couple of years.  I've really liked All-new X-men so far and a lot of what's been going on with old Scott as well."
xmen,35al3i,JohnnyNewspaperseed,5,Fri May 8 15:52:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I completely understand the hate on Bendis, Uncanny and All-New have been pretty fun and enjoyable books if you accept the premise. Maybe it's because I read them all over a few weeks earlier this year and didn't have to put up with the waiting times and decompressed storytelling."
xmen,35al3i,tehvolcanic,2,Fri May 8 15:50:22 2015 UTC,It's because you read them all over a few weeks earlier this year and didn't have to put up with the waiting times and decompressed storytelling.

xmen,35al3i,stratargy,2,Sat May 9 13:18:34 2015 UTC,"Past 616's Iceman being gay is beyond stupid, and showcases everything that is wrong with Bendis' writing style: characters being out-of-character because it fits better the writer's vision.  Said vision being the sole legacy of the worst X-writer that ever walked Earth: Austen.  Of course, if they are flung into space, well, it'll be a giant FUCK YOU X-FANS from Marvel, so nothing else matters."
xmen,35al3i,neoblackdragon,1 point,Sat May 9 15:21:57 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe the O5 will be sent back and there will be enough of a blending between the old and new  by the time they get into space (Cyclops + Space explorer experience; Iceman + more self-acceptance; Jean + empathically just being the Phoenix in space.)"
xmen,35ak1i,cgio0,10,Fri May 8 14:19:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, my take is outdated, because I stopped watching X-Men after Last Stand (I just really didn't like that installment). Things are likely very different now, but based on my old opinions -   I love the women of the X-Men world. But I didn't really like what they did in the movies:    Rogue is one of the physically strongest superheroes out there. Basically Superman but with the emo-no-touching issues (current storylines obviously not included). But in the movie, they took away her strength-aspect leaving her with only her emo-no-touching issues.   Storm is one of the emotionally strongest superheroes out there. Any loss of control and the weather gets all fucked up. She has to keep a cool calm and collected head at all times. Although, they did show her leadership (sort of) after Xavier and Scott died, by saying the school would remain open – most of her lines were dumb or empty. They really didn’t delve into how emotionally strong she really is, and what leadership material she is really made of.   Jean is one of the psionically strongest characters ever. But they show her unable to control her powers, needing to be stopped, and basically reinforce the point that mutants are too dangerous to live. Even when mutants are nice, they might accidentally destroy us all.   Basically, I feel like they took three of the strongest women I've seen and made them all weak.  However, I had a ton of more issues with that movie than just the ladies. So don't think I quite watching because of that."
xmen,35ak1i,slicwilli,2,Fri May 8 15:24:05 2015 UTC,I highly recommend watching the rest of the movies. Days of Future Past is awesome. I even liked Wolverine and I usually hate his Japanese adventures.

xmen,35ak1i,DkPhoenix,2,Sun May 10 01:23:30 2015 UTC,"In the first movie they tried to amalgamate aspects of other characters into both Rogue and Jean, which muddled both of them, and then de-aged Rogue while making Jean older than her comics self, yet setting her power levels and control somewhere around the first ten issues of the comics.  Storm, well, that was just bad casting.   basically reinforce the point that mutants are too dangerous to live   The movie didn't do Dark Phoenix very well, and the point of the original story has been lost with all the retcons and general power level creep in comics since the 90s."

I just can't stand all of this oh its not fair we don't have more women in the avengers or on what ever. And I don't wanna say be happy with what you get, Im just saying a movie where they are going to have a bunch of female characters in it is probably not going to get as much love from the media because its not in the MCU"
xmen,35ak1i,GoldandBlue,5,Fri May 8 15:55:27 2015 UTC,"Because most people don't read comics, and the X-Men are basically their own thing anyways. Marvel is doing now what the X-Men have been doing since the 80's with their more inclusive policies with women and minorities but it is old news. No one talks about it because that is just the X-Men. It is like saying no one talks about the diversity on BET but they love talking about Black-Ish and Empire. Well Marvel had always been pretty white, just like Fox and ABC so when they start being more inclusive it is news. X-Men being inclusive is just the X-Men"
xmen,35ak1i,puzzleddaily,2,Fri May 8 16:25:43 2015 UTC,"yea like I saw some little girl complained to marvel their werent enough female heroes, I was like that is bull shit. There might not be as many female titles like Iron man or the hulk, but the X-men always have female heroes and most of them are very vital to the stories"
xmen,35ak1i,SensitiveArtist,3,Fri May 8 23:16:11 2015 UTC,That really frustrates me about the movies. The X-Men have maybe 3 or 4 of the 5 most popular female characters in all of Marvel and Fox does nothing with them. There is a market begging for attention and you have the dope they want.

xmen,357jyx,Dodavehu,5,Fri May 8 02:50:57 2015 UTC,"I just played this tonight for the first time. I love, love, LOVE the flavor of everything going on here, and the quality of all the pieces/cards is nopnotch, BUUUT  I didn't really like it. I feel it has too much of a penalty for losing. For example, if your hero/student is knocked out of an event (like mine was in the first round once) you're a spectator for waaay too long (30-40 mins for me). There was also a game which I didn't play where the players said someone lost a particular event (The Legacy Virus I think) which made them lose most of their Hope and their Revolution (currency and action points essentially)--which pretty much means you're out of the game--on the second turn.  Both these games took so long (being overly complicated) and punished the non-winners so hard that they both ended in mercy quits before the fourth round.   All that being said, it still looks amazing and has pretty much every modern X-Men character you can imagine (but where are the Brotherhood?!), but I'd advise anyone reading this to play it before you buy it. (Maybe with /u/ambiderpsterity or /u/charlottechewie , haha! )"
xmen,357jyx,TLG160,2,Fri May 8 03:30:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, hmm, that's interesting. I'm assuming that correlates to taking wounds in Spartacus? Which I've never really felt like was a problem, but then again I tend to be pretty conservative in combat and I don't tend to overextend myself. Do heroes not heal up with dice rolls in this iteration of the game?"
xmen,357jyx,SMB73,2,Fri May 8 05:31:46 2015 UTC,"You can either heal them after the combat event (unless they lose all their stats) or refresh any powers they used.  The problem was that the combat event is the meat of the game. The one that I got knocked out of (Swarm of Sentinels) lasted like 30 mins. I got one-shotted on the Sentinel's first attack and then got to do a lot of nothing.  Of course, I guess sending Angel in against Sentinels was a bad plan. I figured his speed would help, buuut not so much when it only takes one hit, haha."

xmen,357r0j,hyogurt,10,Thu May 7 21:29:28 2015 UTC,"I'm cackling because Marvel has been mocking X-Men fans for being paranoid conspiracy theorists afraid that the X-Men will be moved into a separate world and Inhumans will replace them in the main world. Funny how those ""paranoid conspiracy theorists"" were exactly right.  Oh and to all X-Men fans, don't buy the new comics if you don't like this direction. It would only encourage Marvel's stupidity. I'm moving to back issues permanently."
xmen,357r0j,bernex,10,Thu May 7 21:24:11 2015 UTC,"This is so fucking tone-deaf a move.  I recognize the business of trying to get your publishing universe to look like your cinematic universe (despite the fact that Marvel publishing perennially makes enough money to merit existing and nothing more), but as a consumer and reader and fan, it's not really in my best interest to care about that.  Consider this:  a storied franchise that has functioned as an effective allegory for marginalized people in society.    For years, moronic fans and editors alike have squawked about how the bigotry of the Marvel Universe ""doesn't make sense"" because the racism of 616 can't be explained rationally.  ""Why do they hate mutants but not superhumans?  This doesn't make any sense.""  This laughably puerile point has been buttressed in recent years by nutcases like Neal Adams and fools like once-head X-Editor Nick Lowe with the publication of ""First X-Men"".  Nick Lowe found it troubling that people hated mutants with ""no reason"", so they gave us a disaster that was caused by some mutants, to give some sort of 'rationality' for the bigotry against mutants in 616.    Sequestering the mutants seems like a solution to an old problem, but it's little more than a ""go back to Africa/Genosha"".  The argument can be made that the X-Men were always adventure characters first.  I acknowledge this.  However, there needs to be a modicum of goodwill involved to start believing that the X-Men are actually going to become adventure characters again.  They've been floundering back and forth creatively for years, adding dramatic tension bereft of any momentum, refusing to deliver any type of satisfying payoff.  This is not a problem fundamental to serial storytelling:  people have and do flourish in this medium, at this publisher.    tl;dr  this isn't a 'wait n see', this is dumb"
xmen,357r0j,incredibleamadeuscho,3,Thu May 7 21:24:51 2015 UTC,Marvel: How can we make the X-Men a more effective allegory for marginalized people in society. I know! Let's make them more marginalized!
xmen,357r0j,AlphaNeonic,10,Thu May 7 23:13:38 2015 UTC,This is heartbreaking.   X-men and the story and struggle of the mutants has ALWAYS been my favorite part of the Marvel Universe.   Now because of this movie rights bullshit they're just going to pack them all up and send them to a new planet?   This is horrible.
xmen,357r0j,ScubaSteeeve,8,Thu May 7 22:58:06 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have the X-Men pushed into the Ultimate universe without any Avengers or Inhumans or what the hell ever than have them leave Earth entirely. The mutant-human divide made the series what it was. Take that away, and you basically erase the X-Men's entire premise."
xmen,357r0j,iaro,22,Thu May 7 23:06:53 2015 UTC,Fuck this!
xmen,357r0j,AlphaNeonic,8,Thu May 7 21:14:29 2015 UTC,"I know. I knew they were going to do something like this. I really am not sure if I will keep reading Marvel.

I liked the pictures. 27 years of loyalty for X-Men in Space?"
xmen,357r0j,makone222,6,Thu May 7 21:20:11 2015 UTC,"They have been relegating X-men and Fantastic Four for years now.   Spider-man isn't as bad because they can work with Sony, but lots of bad blood with Fox.   No new mutants created, killed Wolverine, Fantastic Four cancelled, no licensed toys, etc.   It is my belief they intend to kill these franchises to death until Fox doesn't want anything to do with them or sells the movie and TV rights back on the cheap... then they will be back in the comic universe with open arms.   It's a damn shame they are missing from the MCU though."

xmen,357r0j,ScubaSteeeve,9,Thu May 7 22:59:55 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you. I'm speaking with my wallet here. What made the X-Men compelling was their parallel with civil rights issues. Cyclops's ""mutant revolution"" idea, though terribly executed, showed a lot of promise and would have been an excellent way for Marvel to provide some worthwhile social commentary on some current events going on.  But nope, because Marvel's pushing these Inhumans that maybe twenty people care about, the X-Men have to go leave earth. What a bunch of bullcrap. If this is true, I'm swearing off Marvel entirely, and considering I'm down to only a trickle of titles right now, that's not an empty threat."
xmen,357r0j,Wygar,8,Thu May 7 23:05:40 2015 UTC,"Without the X-Men living on Earth without humans, you can forget stories with worthwhile social commentary.  Worst part is that this all just because another company owns their movie rights. Throwing away 50 years of history because of that."
xmen,357r0j,darth-hideous,7,Thu May 7 23:12:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I don't give even one little pebble of crap about the Inhumans, and I barely give more than that about the Avengers beyond the movies. Marvel might be making a good business decision, but they're going to lose a shit-ton of hardcore fans."

You mean like how Uncanny X-Men and New Mutants fit together?!  Count me in on that!   I've always dug the idea of everyone actually reacting to the same things going on!

Maybe because she manipulates probability she actually enhanced the probability of mutants being eliminated from Earth on a cosmic level, making it near-impossible to survive by ensuring that on a cosmic level things happen to decimate the population on Earth (increased the chances of mutants becoming depowered; increased the odds of the mists interacting badly with mutants).

xmen,357r0j,SexyPoro,0,Fri May 8 23:49:59 2015 UTC,"You know, I'd be tempted to agree, except what DC did with Flashpoint and the new 52 was even worse.  Marvel will make mistakes, but eventually the superhero movie craze will die down.  At that point, the screenwriters and directors will stop setting story and character priorities for comic books."
xmen,357r0j,sw04ca,1 point,Mon May 18 21:02:09 2015 UTC,"Giving a new origin for your entire universe is worse for everyone in comparison, but at least is completely fair: no one is left behind because of shady interests and political maneuvering.  Here we have Marvel doing a similar move, but clearly disregarding fans of a specific series in favor of others to coerce a company. They use their own characters as hostages...   That decision would be Black if this was M:tG, whereas the ""new past for everyone"" is White. This is not about moviemakers dictating character development, is about a company wanting to make even more money while cutting its possible competitors behind, even if they have to undermine entire fanbases on their way to profit."
xmen,357r0j,SexyPoro,1 point,Tue May 19 00:27:24 2015 UTC,"Some people didn't make it through Flashpoint.  The Justice Society, the later incarnations of Batgirl, some of the old Teen Titans.  And that was just based on DC's senior leadership being bored by their rich history, rather than corporate machinations.  Which is worse, I can't say.  At any rate, I think that the elimination of the mutants is only one factor in the overall picture.  I think you'll find that Secret Wars makes a number of changes to make the comics more in line with the movies.  It's a process that has been ongoing ever since Iron Man became a smash hit."

It's not that important if they decide to update/change their IP's origin stories for the modern and future readers.   What should not be is trampling all over a specific IP that you can no longer profit from in movie form just to blackmail the people that bought you those rights just for corporate/economic reasons?  That's the reason Uncanny 600 is being delayed, they still are not sure if they are pulling the trigger on entire mutantkind. But it's already too late, unless they cancel it."

It has been so many long years of X-men big screen adaptations being Wolverine circle jerks.  Guys like Joss Whedon handle ensemble casts so well... no one feels less important, all the characters have a purpose and seem larger than life. The singer films... well, it seems like most of his decisions were based around ""how can we make this fit into putting wolverine on a pedestal"", which is no way to do an ensemble piece.   X-men not being in house for Marvel is such a huge loss for both the fans and Marvel... it really is a shame how it has all gone down. I would say that X-men is Marvel's most interesting property and Singer has just shit all over it. The end of the Jackman Wolverine I think will be the end of an era that needs to be put to rest."

He was upset with a lot of the editorial decisions around the end of his run with the wider X-Men universe, and to get back at them, he retconned a relationship between Jean Grey and Wolverine sometime around the Hellfire crossover.  Psylocke (post-turning Asian) was a bit of a pet project of Jim Lee, and he wanted to continue the storyline of Jean Grey and Cyclops breaking up.    Editorial was against this storyline for a time, and fought to get Cyclopes and Jean Grey married.  They were even set to get married in X-Factor right before the teams merged and created the Gold / Blue teams, but for some reason it was stopped.  (You can see canceled pages and promos of this in the Jim Lee & Claremont X-Men Omnibus hardcover.)  Shortly after Jim Lee left, Cyclops and Jean Grey did get married.  Somewhat ironically, Morrison later came along and killed off Jean Grey again, and was purportedly asked to do so by editorial.  He also set up Cyclops with the White Queen, which has been one of the more enduring and refreshing changes to come from his run on the X-Men."

It states Marvel retains all TV rights, but will obtain Fox permission before going forward with any TV projects featuring X-men.  So Fox would need to get Marvel to sell them TV rights. And I don't think Marvel wants Fox to have more rights to their characters, unless they get to use some X-men or FF characters in the MCU in return."

Then here in a few years of build up, they could introduce new actors to play the roles of Xavier, Mags, Mystique, Cyclops, Jean, Beast, etc. Then they could introduce the new Wolverine in the sequel to that, make him the dark horse but not the star, the Hannibal Lecter of the series where he's on screen for 20 minutes of 130 and the most memorable part."
xmen,34xxk1,stratargy,1 point,Wed May 6 08:31:51 2015 UTC,"I just feel like less devoted fans would be confused by this ""reshuffling"" and loss of Wolverine.  I feel that the X-men movie's continuity is almost too complicated to smoothly fit in a television show and then more X-men movies that contain characters that most potential movie goers won't be attracted to.  Not saying I wouldn't like this, but for the sake of the franchise I feel like a plan like this just simply wouldn't sell. (hey maybe we will get lucky and see a marvel studios buyout hehe) It's not easy to say, but I think the only middle ground is a full reboot. Why not? It doesn't take away from the quality of the older movies and they still exist in their own right, the good ones and the not-so-good ones.  I feel like if Fox waited long enough people would be comfortable with a reboot.  For example, sure the Amazing Spider-Man run turned out to be a dud, but it wasn't necessarily because the character was rebooted... it was mostly because of serious creative and writing problems that Sony ignored. Reboots, although somewhat confusing for some people are much more simple than fans having to keep years of continuity in mind while seeing some of their favorite characters just lose their screen time. I love all of the X-men just as much as you guys, and I also agree that Wolverine was being used too often... but let's be honest, would X-men movies without these iconic characters really sell? Would it really be good for the overall quality of the franchise? In my opinion, Fox should keep the creative teams that have been working on the recent X-men movies, and just plan ahead for a reboot in the future."

I hated how poor the effects were for the massive beach scene with the submarine... really bad CGI ruined that whole sequence for me.  But overall it was really solid. I thought McAvoy and Fassbender were brilliant choices for Xavier and Eric, and for what it's worth Jennifer Lawrence really humanized Mystique well, even if her make-up/body-suit didn't look nearly as badass as the original trilogy's."

The knowledge you have to have going in to the X-Men movies is the knowledge gained from the X-Men movies. Note how they did Magneto's origin twice. It's because they expect people to know nothing coming in to the theater.

xmen,34uto0,mc8755,5,Tue May 5 09:38:17 2015 UTC,"In X1, Mystique was a spry 70-year-old since she was born mid 1930s! Though that's explained due to her cell metabolism/aging being so much slower. It also puts Xavier at roughly the same age since they're pretty similar in First Class. Xavier being alive in DOFP's future of 2023ish makes him (and presumably Magneto) pushing 100."

Soon they were crossing lines pretty frequently though, and every major X-Men event crossed over between both books, often including other X-Titles like Cable, Wolverine, Excalibur, X-Force, X-Factor, etc.  So, yeah, I wouldn't necessarily alternate issue or anything, maybe read a story arc of Uncanny, then a story arc of Adjectiveless, until you get to a major crossover event, and then read that as one arc. Crossover events to look out for along the way are as follows:  X-Cutioner's Song  Fatal Attractions  Phalanx Covenant  Legion Quest/Age of Apocalypse  Operation: Zero Tolerance  Hunt for Xavier  Magneto War  The Shattering/Apocalypse: The Twelve  Eve of Destruction  Here's where the title is taken over by Grant Morrison and becomes ""New X-Men"". These are great stories and should not be skipped. The book resumes it's original title after that and the crossovers go on:   Decimation  Endangered Species  Messiah Complex  The title then becomes X-Men Legacy but retains the same numbering and the crossovers continue with:  Original Sin  Second Coming  Age of X  Avengers Vs. X-Men  EDIT: A good resource for which issues are included in these story arcs is www.comicbookdb.com. Just find the issue you're looking for and the crossover should be listed. Click on that and it will list everything in that story, including any pertinent annuals or one-shots (a la X-Men: Alpha for the Age of Apocalypse crossover)."

xmen,34qs4v,Troybarns,1 point,Mon May 4 02:01:24 2015 UTC,"It's only Mystique's for sure, but it's likely the flashback scene with the newspapers and stuff where Patrick Stewart is explaining will be longer in Rogue cut and show how she has been captured and experimented on to make the sentinels unbeatable.  I mean, let's be realistic... if she weren't captured, there's no way someone with her powers could really survive outside a mutant camp."

xmen,34qs4v,logangrey123,1 point,Mon May 4 01:35:06 2015 UTC,"Everything before first class would be leading up to the dystopian future. As we saw with the antidote, it was only temporary because Magneto got his powers back. The dystopian future is further into the future than Magneto's chess scene in Last Stand so we should assume that she got her powers back.  Even if she didn't (get her powers back - we'll have to wait for the Rogue cut) she still has the genes in her DNA for them to study.  But everything before First Class is considered changed now because Mystique did not shoot Trask."

The only other title I know of that she's been in was New Excalibur which, although I really like Claremont usually, was a bit shitty in my opinion, she gets a major arc throughout that and a twist I've never seen before in a comic book near the end.  I don't think she ever came into her own as a character due to lack of focus but it's fun to read about her as part of the Exiles team."

If we go by the 90s Age of Apocalypse timeline (which won't happen), the four horsemen are Mikhail Rasputin, Holocaust, Mister Sinister and Abyss. Honestly, there are better mutant powers to represent the four horsemen of the apocalypse than these, but I expect they will be fairly original selections, follow an original storyline, and generally fit the script more than the comics. Marvel doesn't have a direct hand any more in the series. They will just make hay while the sun shines and bring as many character in that pique interest as they can. Not totally disappointed with this, because they can bring a tiny bit of limelight to a bunch of underrepresented characters if they're good at it. Stoke the nerds, and they will respond with more fire."

xmen,34mq9f,Jumbledcode,2,Sat May 2 17:13:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think you're missing a lot of the best stuff and hitting a bunch of relatively cruddy runs by starting at House of M. However, your list does seem to be mostly in chronological order.  Of the ones listed, you should probably start with the Whedon run on Astonishing X-Men as it's decent and starts before House of M chronologically.  If I wanted to compromise between reading good arcs and getting caught up, I'd read more stuff from the early 2000s as well as the 80s and 90s, and skip everything between House of M and AvX except for Uncanny X-Force."
xmen,34mq9f,Jumbledcode,2,Sun May 3 20:31:54 2015 UTC,Thank you for the input however I don't have much knowledge of the older comics and I wouldn't know where to start or what order to read them in. If you know of any guides that would be great.
xmen,34mq9f,Mevansuto,2,Sun May 3 23:30:46 2015 UTC,"This is a very comprehensive listing of all X-comics in chronological order:  http://crushingkrisis.com/collecting-x-men-comic-books-as-graphic-novels/x-men-reading-order-guide/  For anything before 1990, the most important books to check out are the ones written by Claremont. Most of the time, Uncanny X-Men is the central book of the franchise. However, you should avoid it in the early 2000s as it suffered from a particularly bad run by a writer named Chuck Austen. Instead, for that period, read X-Treme X-Men and New X-Men."
xmen,34mq9f,BdaysWasTheWorstDays,1 point,Sun May 3 23:39:21 2015 UTC,"Try following this on Marvel Unlimited (only reasonable way to do this). It's missing several notable series though. NYX, New Mutants (volume 2), New X-Men (volume 2) and Mike Carey's run on X-Men and X-Men Legacy come to mind. Other than that, it's pretty comprehensive."
xmen,34mf0m,Elaol,4,Sat May 2 13:55:59 2015 UTC,"If you want to start from the very beginning, i highly recommend you check out http://www.rachelandmiles.com/xmen/  they do a podcast where they run through ALL of x-men history, and have lots of advice on jumping on points, summaries, etc. their recent annual episode is a GREAT place to get a summary of what they've done so far, get some good recommendations, etc.   plus they're fuckin' awesome and every x-fan should listen to them."
xmen,34mf0m,eremiticjude,2,Sat May 2 19:12:08 2015 UTC,"Well, there is the recommended reading in the side bar if you just want to read most of the major arcs you can follow that. If you are looking to actully buy the comics Essential X-Men is the most cost efficient method. It has all the stories but, they are printed in B&W to save you and them money. Or you could just skip to Grant Morrison's New X-Men, run which is really the start of the modern X-Men, then Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men, followed by House of M, and then Uncanny X-Men because the main book. Personally, when I decided to start reading the comics more regularly I started with Morrison and have no regrets about the decision."
xmen,34mf0m,kylesleeps,1 point,Sat May 2 16:33:26 2015 UTC,"These recommended reading on sidebar, can I read each of them individually, I mean they have separate story, right? I am familiar with X-Men, but I haven't read any comics. And what is the right order of recommended reading? Another thing: Uncanny X-Men are those issues from 1960s, right?"
xmen,34mf0m,xooxanthellae,2,Sat May 2 16:39:31 2015 UTC,"The side bar is not in perfect chronological order, so double-check with other sources. For example, Wolverine comes before From the Ashes, and Tomorrow's Brightest was written way later.  The original 1963 comics were just called X-men. Around 1982 or so they started being called Uncanny X-Men -- the same series, but it just got a name change."
xmen,34mf0m,kylesleeps,1 point,Sat May 2 22:41:21 2015 UTC,"The Side bar is in Chronological order already, you can just follow it that way. As for Uncanny X-Men that is the name of some of the X-Men books. The ones I referenced after House of M are not from the '60's they are from the 2000's. You don't really need to read the earliest run. The original X-Men run isn't that important. Claremont really resurrected and reinvented the X-Men when he took it over in his run which lasted from '75-'91."
xmen,34mf0m,thebadone411,2,Sat May 2 16:50:06 2015 UTC,There are events from the original run and from the Claremont run that are referenced surprisingly often.  The whole reason I started from the very beginning is so I could fully comprehend what the heck was being referenced. Eventually I read so much X-Men over such a long period of time that I couldn't keep track of what was being referenced. Maddening
xmen,34mf0m,kylesleeps,1 point,Sat May 2 21:59:46 2015 UTC,"There are, but I don't feel you have to read them to start X-Men. Honestly, I don't even think it's a good idea to start that far back at this point because I just feel like you would get bogged down by the weight of it. After you get into and already like it you can always circle back and check out the older stuff."

xmen,34mf0m,MajinBuddha,2,Sat May 2 17:15:11 2015 UTC,"Here's my cut & paste response for every time this is asked ---  I recommend starting with Chris Claremont's run that made the X-Men popular --- Giant Size X-Men #1, Uncanny X-Men #94-280, the graphic novel ""God Loves, Man Kills"", and X-Men: Vignettes 1 & 2.   This is an extremely helpful site: http://crushingkrisis.com/collecting-x-men-comic-books-as-graphic-novels/  There's also a good documentary about Chris Claremont's X-Men: http://sequart.org/movies/4/comics-in-focus-chris-claremonts-x-men/  If you want to skip around rather than reading every issue, here are my favorite story arcs, in chronological order:   Proteus (Uncanny 125-128) -- their first really dangerous enemy; I highly recommend the trade paperback which has some great additional stories Dark Phoenix Saga (Uncanny 129-137) -- widely considered the best ever, not my favorite though Days of Future Past (Uncanny 141-142) -- Kitty travels back in time from a dystopian future God Loves, Man Kills (graphic novel) -- possibly the best place for a newcomer to start The Brood Saga (Uncanny 154-158, 161-167) -- a mix of Alien & The Matrix, includes the first meeting of Magneto & Professor X (#161) and the first meeting of the X-men & Rogue Wolverine (Claremont/Miller limited series 1-4) -- the first Wolverine comics, must-read From the Ashes (Uncanny 168-176) -- one of Joss Whedon's favorite runs; Wolverine's wedding; Rogue joins the X-Men; Storm gets a mohawk Havok & Wolverine: Meltdown (limited series 1-4) -- highly recommended, great artwork X-Treme X-Men: Mekanix -- must-read for Kitty Pryde fans. Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men run 1-24 (the Warren Ellis run after this is also good). The Whedon run also has an amazing motion comic partially available on Netflix. Remender's Uncanny X-Force (Vol. 1)   Five great single issues:   Uncanny 117 - Professor X does mind battle Uncanny 150 - the first great Magneto story Uncanny 153 - the funniest issue, Kitty's Fairy Tale Uncanny 205 - Wolverine vs Lady Deathstrike Uncanny 268 - Wolverine hanging out with Captain America in Madripoor in the '40s   Stuff that didn't make the cut:   Uncanny 94-124 -- highlights include the Phoenix Saga (101-108, good background for Dark Phoenix) and a great Professor X story in issue 117. Otherwise you won't miss too much if you skip to Proteus. Uncanny 177-228 -- there's some good stuff here but for me it's not as good as the previous stuff. Highlights include Lifedeath (tpb), and issue #205 is a must-read for Wolverine fans. Uncanny 229-239 -- I think this run is worth checking out. It includes 3 story arcs leading into Inferno: The Reavers (and the X-Men's move to Australia), the return of the Brood, and Genosha. This would be a good time to check out the Wolverine unlimited series. There's some good stuff after this, esp Psylocke becoming a ninja (256-258) and Wolverine & Cap America in #268, but it's in a bit of a decline (although Jim Lee's art is incredible).   Grant Morrison's New X-Men run gets recommended a lot, but personally I think it's overrated. The art undergoes jarring shifts as artists change, some of the art is truly bad, and it's a damn shame how Morrison assassinated Magneto's character. And there's basically just 4 X-Men in it, 3 of them being members of the original Stan Lee team."

I AM EASILY CONFUSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T LOOK LIKE MY MOM & DAD, AND CONFUSION MAKES MY SMALL BRAIN ANGRY!"" - Mikal Hess  The X-Men fanbase is a weird place to find outage over racially inclusive casting. The entire X-Men storyline springs from a minority group (defined by their immutable characteristics) struggling against bigotry and oppression. Is not like you have to be a SJW to catch that, it is pretty superliminal.   Also, what's with the reference to Clueless? Are there any Asians in that movie?"
xmen,34gr8d,SuperSonicRocket,-14,Fri May 1 05:43:59 2015 UTC,"It does annoy me that this argument is instantly considered racist. What if I cast a white guy as Mohammed Ali? That would be ok, right? No, he's not white.  How about I make Iron Fist/Danny Rand into an Australian? NO! I think Storm should be Scottish. WHY? NO! In this case she's Asian, so she SHOULD be played by an Asian. Making Johnny Storm black to me is wrong."
xmen,34gr8d,TheUmpteenth,9,Fri May 1 08:04:55 2015 UTC,"By ""this argument"" do you mean an argument that casting should be racially accurate/authentic? Because I don't think anyone here is refuting that argument. It seems like a good general rule with a couple of exceptions. The thing Mikal Hess is doing wrong here is expressing outrage when he's factually wrong (her last name has always been Lee), and by doing so he arguably exposes assuptions he's made based on his own racial bias (probably unconscious bias, but who knows ). There's nothing wrong with expressing interest in authenticity, IMHO. If Johnny Storm was going to be rewritten in any way not loyal to the original source material (e.g. JS is rewritten as a black woman, or an openly gay man, or a fire-breathing fish) there had better be a really good artistic justification for the creative liberties taken with such an iconic character, amd it better enhance the story.   Mohammed Ali, on the other hand, is not a fictional character. A demand for authenticity/visual accuracy from the audience would logically be stronger when depicting real people."

xmen,34gr8d,TheUmpteenth,4,Fri May 1 11:22:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah Mikal Hess wasn't arguing for accuracy like other people have for other characters. He was just plain ignorant, as if Jubilee being Asian was something we should be questioning or outraged about."

Iron Fist/Danny Rand into an Australian?    Once again, his race plays a big part of who he is.    I think Storm should be Scottish.   Would throw that whole African queen thing out the door, wouldn't it?   Making Johnny Storm black to me is wrong.   Of course, it bothers you that the one character, whose race or color has absolutely nothing to do with his identity or personality, becomes a black guy.   People act like these black actors somehow saved up their money and cashed in to become these comic book characters. Like they didn't have to audition or meet certain criteria that the film producers and directors had for their vision. Do you think Michael Clarke Duncan got the role of Kingpin just because he was black? No, it was more than likely because he was an Oscar nominated actor, who had the built and physique to play Wilson Fisk, whose name doesn't really have an ethnic identity. If directors thought Oh we gotta keep Kingpin white, they could've easily casted a pro wrestler that can't act for shit. I'm sure King Kong Bundy or the Big Show weren't busy."

We're different because of our life experiences, because of our parents teachings, because of what we identify as our history. We are different, and we should embrace those differences.

xmen,34emmz,gl1tchmob,87,Thu Apr 30 15:24:08 2015 UTC,"Deep breath.  After the Scarlet Witch Decimated the mutant population leaving just a scant 200, Cyclops changed tactics from species integration to survival. Master strategist that he is, he recognized necessities of the situation that few others could, which resulted in many questioning his leadership.   Some questionable stuff sewing dissension:  Forming X-Force in secret. X-Force was a mutant wetworks team that clandestinely took care of threats to mutant survival with extreme prejudice. Headed by Wolverine, the team is a real politik response to the threat of extinction. Pisses off Beast, Storm, and a slew of others.  Training young mutants to be prepared to fight. This is what led to Schism. When faced with extinction, Cyclops rightly saw fit to train the youngest of mutants how to defend themselves. When these kids were faced with a life and death situation, Cyclops told one to use her judgment. She killed the threat. Pissed off Wolverine, who feels that only he should be burdened with killing, and Wolverine's subsequent departure splits the team.  Forming the X-tinction team. After Schism, Cyclops forms a team of mutant heavy hitters to protect mutants and the earth. This team includes Magneto (reformed bad-guy), Namor (reformed bad-guy), Magik (semi-reformed half demon thing), and White Queen (reformed bad-guy). This causes many to question his decisions - though the team does save the planet from Celestials.  Phoenix is returning. Hope has been displaying portents indicating the Phoenix force will be using her as host. Cyclops believes that the Phoenix force is returning to reignite evolution - he has his reasons and evidence for this. He is training Hope to be ready for it. Cyclops is very familiar with the Phoenix Force, having been married to Jean who was a Phoenix Force vessel, dated the Phoenix Force while it pretended it was Jean (because comics), having traveled to the future and been guided by the religious group Askani which revolves around the Phoenix, and having a daughter who was also the vessel of the Phoenix Force. He's kind of like the local expert. The Avengers find out the Force is coming to earth and freak out. Wolverine is telling them all that Cyclops is crazy and needs to be taken down. The Avengers show up with a Helicarrier on the sovereign soil of Utopia and demand that Cyclops hand over Hope. Cyclops and Captain America get into a scrape and Avengers vs. X-Men happens.   A v X. Wolverine sneaks into Utopia, while the X-Men and Avengers are fighting, to kill Hope. She's starting to show the power of the Phoenix, trounces him, and runs. Both teams start looking for her and have more skirmishes. They all wind up on the moon as the Phoenix is inbound. Tony Stark, super-genius, builds a weapon to destroy the Phoenix. His weapon doesn't destroy it, but breaks it into 5 pieces. Namor, White Queen, Colossus, Magik, and Cyclops are taken over by the Phoenix Force (Phoenix 5) instead of Hope. Now, none of these 5 were chosen, as Hope was, or trained, as Hope was, so they wind up with some stability issues.  The Phoenix 5 go about literally making the world a better place. The Avengers look at these good works and think, ""Oh hell no"". They keep attacking and antagonizing the Phoenix 5 and eventually tip each over the edge. I like to give this analogy: the Avengers saw a wasp nest and thought, ""hey that could sting us we should attack it"", so they start whacking it-stirring up the wasp nest which then proceeds to sting them, justifying their attacking the wasp nest - it's circular logic and it's crap. When one of the 5 is defeated, the remaining members take on a greater portion of the Phoenix - further destabilizing them. Cyclops winds up with all the power of the Phoenix Force in a final tussle with the Avengers, goes Dark Phoenix and destroys some stuff and kills Professor X. He regains control long enough to help Hope take the Phoenix Force. She does, fixes the shit that he'd wrecked, and then reignites the mutant population as Cyclops said she would.  Everyone stomps on Cyclops for fucking shit up while possessed and especially for killing Prof. X. Everyone ignores that the Avengers precipitated the entire thing (guided by Wolverine). Everyone also ignores he was possessed while he did the terrible stuff. Everyone also ignores how some 50% of heroes have done terrible things while under possession of some force or another. Everyone ignores that, while alive, Prof. X had been revealed to be an incredibly manipulative and douchey guy and now in death is considered a saint. Cyclops is now considered a villain and is hated by pretty much every hypocrite on the Avengers and X-Men.  But, he was right about Hope, and the Phoenix Force, and the Extinction Team, and training the kids to fight, and X-Force. Problem was, no one else could see the situation he could, or no one was willing to. Ergo, Cyclops was right.  Edit Gold!? Thank you friendly neighborhood Redditor!"

xmen,34emmz,arthur4242,9,Fri May 1 02:42:40 2015 UTC,"Really, he was only half right. In the end, yeah Hope used the Phoenix to restore mutantkind and disperse the Phoenix Force, but she wouldn't have been able to do that right off the bat despite her training. It was because of everything she learned through the event (both from seeing the Phoenix Five fuck up and from K'un L'un) and the help of Wanda/Shou-Lao (which she only sought because of the Avengers fucking things up on the moon) that she was actually able to accomplish it so successfully. Without all that, it's just as likely she would have just accepted the role of Phoenix and gone on like that until possibly/probably going all Jean Grey in the end.

The short version is that after Professor X and Magneto are no longer leading their respective groups there is a split in ideology within the xmen another mutants. Wolverine sided with the goals and aspirations that Xavier always taught while Cyclops went down the path that Magneto saw and went on the offensive for the cause of mutants.

xmen,34emmz,ChocolateAmerican,5,Thu Apr 30 23:41:35 2015 UTC,i just don't get why i'm expected to see cyclops as in the wrong here when he was the only one that acted with any amount of humanity or compassion in the entire situation and it had already worked and he was just murdered in cold blood anyway. but the book seems to really be leaning towards the idea that he didn't handle it correctly because he didn't just want to murder or erase from history or mindwipe a member of his own species

xmen,34cctn,curious_skeptic,4,Thu Apr 30 01:33:00 2015 UTC,"The reason that a lot of old comics have a lot of value is that people didn't think to save them. Kids would read them, then doodle in them, leave them on the floor, spill Kool-Aid on them, and then chuck them out. At some point, older comics started to get valuable, because they were genuinely rare. When that started happening, everyone started more carefully preserving comics, buying big batches of #1's and special foil variants and the like, and either sealing them up or at least taking reasonable care of them, in the hopes that they would someday appreciate.  The problem was that because so many people did that, the supply of comics from that era (and every era forward) is so high that they haven't appreciated in value at all, and probably never will, at least not in any reasonable timeframe."
xmen,34cctn,Daiteach,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:08:01 2015 UTC,Great explanation! I wonder when the boom of rare comics happened?   It's almost as if we can just go back to enjoying comic books without worrying about them being collectibles

There is no need, as the things that a reboot does-new cast, new continuity-have already been in motion since 2011 with the added zaniness that you know and love about the X-Men, that zaniness being tying in the old cast in with the new in DOFP."

xmen,34b67g,DastrdlyDave,5,Wed Apr 29 19:22:57 2015 UTC,"Everyone who would have any actual information has said clearly and repeatedly that the X-Men aren't going anywhere, are not being retired in favor of the Inhumans, and are not having their profile diminished.

I feel like they would never be used in movie, if marvel owned the X-men, but i don't care I really like most of the Fox movies so marvel can start their Inhuman train i think everyone knows they're knock off x-men even though Stan Lee made then only a few years after the X-men"
xmen,34b67g,cgio0,4,Wed Apr 29 19:52:49 2015 UTC,"The Inhumans, as originally formulated by Lee and Kirby and as depicted for the majority of their history, have very little in common with the X-Men.

xmen,34b67g,cgio0,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:40:44 2015 UTC,"I actually feel like the Inhumans' backstory has been neglected in comparison to the X-Men.  The Inhumans' take on their special abilities is different from being a mutant (Inhumans can decide whether they want to undergo the terrigenesis, mutants are all basically stuck with whatever they get during puberty), and the Inhuman royal court has a different dynamic from the X-men, since it relies on taking orders from a king as opposed to taking the authority of a mentor/leadership figure in Xavier.  Personally, I think there's plenty of room for both in the MCU and Earth-616."

xmen,34531a,Stereotypy,7,Tue Apr 28 13:16:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's because of the spectacular fuck up from The Joker photo not long before, but I was totally satisfied with Nightcrawler. The face looked a bit goofy but I think that was just the actor. I'm just glad that they focused on making a faithful and believable (as far as blue devil mutants go) adaptation instead of overproducing it and trying way too hard to give it a personal flair it doesn't need. In First Class and DoFP, everyone looked great regardless of how good or bad their set photos looked, so after the Quicksilver situation I need to at least see it in motion (with X-Men costumes anyway). Mystique has always kinda let me down, but that's a personal preference because I dislike the ""always naked featureless Barbie"" thing she's got going on in the movies; skull belts and machine guns are way cooler. It's worse in the new movies because Jennifer Lawrence, while attractive, does not fit the deadly seductress thing physically or personality-wise... probably also partly because I'm sick of so much focus on Mystique ever since Singer's first X-Men movie. There are way too many awesome X-Men to waste so much focus on her and it holds the movies down a bit for me, almost as much as Rogue just being mopey and sad instead of flying around punching shit and giving everyone sass.  Edit: Shit, sorry for the essay"

Rumor is that the tattoos won't be a part of the design and were just a part of the Joker 75th anniversary thing, which I hope is the case. Everyone did kinda overreact though, myself included. Mystique wasn't terrible in the first trilogy, but I still dislike the design now that I've read the comics. The focus on Mystique in the new movies is much worse. I wish they'd have cast Lawrence as a different character so the focus on her wouldn't be as grating (though admittedly the only part of hers I've really liked was in Silver Linings Playbook). She really doesn't fit the part and is about the only major thing I disliked about FC/DoFP."

So she might be an Inhuman if she turns up in film.  Not sure if Fox can use her as part of the X-men or not, like with Quicksilver in Days of Future Past. The contract allows Fox to use characters who are part of the ""X-verse"" but that seems open to interpretation as to who is and isn't included. I know when Marvel Studios began they borrowed money using the Avengers as collateral, but they intentionally did not specify which Avengers were the collateral so they could stick bank with Jack of Hearts and Scott Lang and keep Iron Man, Thor, and Cap."
xmen,346pn1,captainpostal,0,Thu Apr 30 22:00:22 2015 UTC,I think they would just add her as Alison Blaire the S.H.I.E.L.D agent if they ever use her in Avengers.

In all seriousness though, I think that just means Singer will be done, which I'm pretty sure was basically confirmed already. There is no way they'd reboot everything again just two movies after spending two hours to retcon the bad movies, and one movie after finally completing the core recasting of all the younger characters that they've been doing in this trilogy, especially considering how popular the new movies have been. Plus, there are multiple other movies in that universe still in production."
xmen,346cvc,drchasedanger,3,Tue Apr 28 18:18:26 2015 UTC,I think you're right. Singer will be done and they'll probably attempt to continue using the new younger cast with a new director.

xmen,340lwu,xargon666,16,Mon Apr 27 10:42:55 2015 UTC,"During the 'Fear Itself' event (2011ish?) Kain Marko came into possession of one of the Serpent's mythical hammers, further augmenting his Juggernaut abilities and turning him into a literally unstoppable and even more destructive force than before.  One of Cyclops' many plans to stop the Juggernaut involved sending Magik, along with Colossus and Shadowcat, to Cytorrak's domain to let the demon know that his Avatar was under the control of some other magical influence.  With this knowledge, Cytorrak removed his influence from Marko, rendering him no longer unstoppable but still under the influence of the Serpent's power.  Magik had planned to become the Juggernaut in Kain Marko's place (In AvX we learn that her powers as ruler of Limbo would have allowed her to remove Cytorrak's influence whenever she wanted).  Colossus, unaware of his sister's greater plan, intervened and became the Juggernaut instead, which allowed him to defeat Marko.  Colossus remained the Juggernaut until the end of AvX when Magik dispelled Cytorrak's enchantment."

xmen,340lwu,ScubaSteeeve,7,Mon Apr 27 17:02:57 2015 UTC,"It's kind of crazy to imagine how many transformations these characters have been through. Colossus was the Juggernaut and one of several hosts of the Phoenix. Wolverine, Gambit, Sunspot, and Archangel have pulled off stints as Horsemen of Apocalypse. Cyclops has been the sole host of both Apocalypse and the Phoenix Force, both within a relatively short time of one another.  These possessions have got to leave some sort of mental scars, especially in Colossus and Cyclops's cases."
xmen,340lwu,Zthe27th,2,Mon Apr 27 14:13:50 2015 UTC,I think they have done a good job showing how Cyke was messed up from it. Him and Jean's marriage fell apart after the Apocalypse thing and his current status quo is 100% thanks to being a Phoenix host
xmen,340lwu,ScubaSteeeve,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:25:26 2015 UTC,"A lot of people either don't realize that Cyclops was a host for Apocalypse or don't understand how much it must have messed him up. It obviously left some irreversible damage in his relationship with Jean, but I think it also forced him to confront aspects of his own personality that he's kept repressed for years.  In fact, I think what a good writer would do is bring up this fact somehow. The last few times the X-Men faced Apocalypse, nobody even acknowledged the fact that he used to be in Cyclops's body and left a scar on his psyche. The whole story was swept under the rug, as far as continuity's concerned.  But it could be used for some powerful storytelling. Maybe some insignificant part of Apocalypse has been in Cyclops all along, driving him to greater and greater lengths to ensure the survival of the ""fittest"" (mutants). It would also make the fact that it too so long to make him snap when possessed by the Phoenix a lot more poignant (he was the only one to be possessed by the Phoenix Force who didn't really do anything terrible with it - he killed exactly one person, and that was after he'd been pushed to his brink)."
xmen,340lwu,Zthe27th,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:13:03 2015 UTC,When have they really faced Apocalypse since the Twelve? There was the stuff in Milligan's run but Cyke really wasn't in it. And then what Axis where is was really Evan. I think there is a lot of potential but that story is almost 20 at this point and wasn't really good.
xmen,340lwu,ScubaSteeeve,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:26:20 2015 UTC,"That's the thing. Apocalypse was supposed to be gone forever when he was yanked out of Cyclops's body and pierced by Cable's spear. The narration even said that ""not even his soul was left."" Then, they retconned it and brought him back after M-Day, which was a really weak story in part because it didn't even acknowledge that story.  They also used a pretty old story - Xavier wiping Magneto's mind - as the basis of Onslaught. They brought back the Age of Apocalypse recently (only for it to spiral into a convoluted mess when it got prematurely canceled). Marvel has shown they have no problem revisiting old stories."
xmen,340lwu,calgil,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:10:14 2015 UTC,Horseman Cyclops was brought up recently in 'Wolverine and the X-Men'. Quire sought out Cyclops because he's the only one to know the influence of both Apocalypse and the Phoenix.  Cyclops says he broke free of Apocalypse's influence and recovered and it made him feel strong - but being possessed by the Phoenix made him realise how truly weak and irrelevant he was.

xmen,3437d7,hatebacon,3,Mon Apr 27 23:12:45 2015 UTC,"I forgot the formula but me and another guy worked it out a while back where it's something like every 3(or 4) of our years = 1 of theirs. I'll work out the math using Scott as our example since he states he's been an X-man since he was 15 and I remember the math had put him in mid 30's when we did it. H/o  Edit: Ok it was 3:1 and going from 1963 @ 15 y/o by 2014 Scott is now 32  Using the same math Kitty from 1980 @ 13.5 y/o was 24 in 2013 - soon to be 25 in '16   I have no idea how old Colossus is when he first joins and I can't find anything on it, I only know he's younger than Scott, older than Kitty, but not old enough to where people would care enough that he's making out with a 14 y/o girl. So by the time she's 14 I'm thinking maybe he's 17/18 which puts him at 27 in '13 turning 28 in '16 which sounds about right.(That math going off of him being 17 in 1983 when Kitty was 14)"
xmen,3437d7,Frearthandox,2,Tue Apr 28 13:11:47 2015 UTC,"No one knows if the universe will be rebooted, or how, or how much. Since so many Spider-series just rebooted, I doubt Spider-Man will be significantly changed.  The timeline is flexible, but I think 20 years is reasonable. The original X-Men and people of that generation are late-thirties or forties; the New Mutants and Gen-X are in their twenties (Sam & Dani are probably 29 or 30; Jubilee is probably 20 or 21); and the younger mutants are teens. Kitty Pryde would be mid-twenties; Colossus in his early-thirties."

xmen,342i5x,Woggums83,3,Mon Apr 27 20:09:33 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're jumping all over the place.   The best X-Men comics really reward dedication (unlike, say, Spider-Man, which you can usually jump into at any time).   Age of Apocalypse is overwhelming but totally worth it.   Then start with Uncanny X-Men in 1996 (you don't need to start any earlier, IMHO) and read until House of M.   Then go back and read all of Astonishing X-Men until House of M.   Then read House of M.  Finish Astonishing then, if you're not sick of it, Uncanny."
xmen,342i5x,reluctantutian,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:47:18 2015 UTC,"Astonishing X-Men (the Whedon one) is great and a good point you can just jump into. God Loves, Man Kills is a classic and is kind of a stand-alone graphic novel.  If you want to go all historical, I would say you can start with Giant-Size X-Men #1 (Deadly Genesis) and go into the Claremont era (you can skip everything before, and it's pretty much summed up in an issue at the end of the Phoenix saga, don't remember which). Be warned that to actually follow the whole story, you will have to follow along with the other X books and other related titles, which starts getting very overwhelming around the mid-eighties.  My favorite moments are usually the big events but sometimes they have quite a bit of buildup you need to follow to really get into them. For example: Inferno (one of my personal favorites).  There's a great guide over at crushingkrisis.com:  Short  Complete  I actually think this guide should be added to the sidebar."

xmen,33tc6h,DocWheatley,2,Sat Apr 25 18:29:39 2015 UTC,Yeah thanks I got it
xmen,33pi2d,Zanza00,9,Fri Apr 24 13:14:00 2015 UTC,"Overall, I felt like there were scenes missing between each issue. Anyone else feel that way?"
xmen,33pi2d,ActualButt,5,Fri Apr 24 14:47:04 2015 UTC,Yes!  Going to re read later but felt sloppy and inconsistent.
xmen,33pi2d,uninspiredalias,3,Fri Apr 24 19:49:40 2015 UTC,"I think that comes from having multiple writers.  The Nova, Captain Marvel, and Cyclops issues all kind of felt out of place."
xmen,33pi2d,tehvolcanic,2,Fri Apr 24 20:12:38 2015 UTC,I was just thinking that as soon as I hit save.
xmen,33pi2d,ActualButt,7,Fri Apr 24 20:14:56 2015 UTC,I liked it. The GoG and the x-men naturally pair well together. The cosmic transformations were well done for the most part. Not sure how I feel about Warren getting yet another strange set of powers but meh. Kind of a nar nar ending. Kitty pride becomes some sort of cosmic goddess and phases a planet. A lot of build for not a lot of pay off. I'm sure everythings going to be retconned after secret wars anyway.
xmen,33pi2d,hedgerocks,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:41:00 2015 UTC,What powers did Warren get or keep?
xmen,33pi2d,ChocolateRage,4,Fri Apr 24 22:01:10 2015 UTC,"It's not clear at all.  Visually he has light wings attached with weird metal shoulders??  In the event he had undefined ""cosmic"" powers that let him, at minimum, fight in space and be a general badass...but I don't think they were really specified.  Definitely one of the problems I had with the whole thing."

xmen,33pi2d,detourne,3,Fri Apr 24 14:56:10 2015 UTC,"I think that the premises of all new x men (teleport the first x men to the current era) is a nice twist, but in this story Cosmic Hank basically says the timeline is screwed. I don't know how that will affect the timeline but i think that it will be erased in Secret Wars.  I really liked the Cosmic version of Kitty but i liked more Gamora (with the cape that can stash a lot of weapons) and Hank (not in the appearance but in the why he shift his thinking.  In the end i liked it as a story, good but not great."
xmen,33pi2d,psychoticapes,6,Fri Apr 24 13:24:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Hank kind of realized how much of an asshat he's been for the past five years.  Also, the death of Supremor and destruction of Hala should have been a much bigger deal than how it was perceived.  I think it will all get retconned in Secret Wars."

xmen,33pi2d,t0talnonsense,2,Sat Apr 25 02:10:37 2015 UTC,"One thing that's bugging me (there are more, but this one thing at the moment, now that we have All New 40) - Angel's personality.  It was all crazy cosmic shit, then suddenly he's back to his normal self (personality wise) without doing the cosmic reversion thing (which also made very little sense...that ending felt rushed)??  What?  Same thing with Gamora actually.      And Cyclops/Iceman/Kitty's personalities never got weird?  So Kitty must not have been that special? What?  Like the whole cosmic power angle felt really half assed.   And there's a bunch of extra-buff cosmic bad guys running around now?  Although that's- also kind of inconsistent because sometimes they wore portrayed as crazy powerful and other times as ""just"" really powerful?  And the slaughter dudes didn't get personality makeovers?  ARGHHH."
xmen,33pi2d,brucecampbel,2,Sat Apr 25 02:04:46 2015 UTC,I thought every new costume/ character design that was introduced was lazy and uninspired. They had so many opportunities to come up with cool stuff and for whatever reason they dropped the ball on every single one. I'm more disappointed in the lost opportunities than the disorganization of it all.
xmen,33pi2d,uninspiredalias,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:27:04 2015 UTC,"So everyone is talking about iceman being gay, but after reading this. It's rather obvious that the black voted reversion is why.

xmen,33pi2d,MrJayOhh,4,Fri Apr 24 16:27:23 2015 UTC,"It doesn't make sense for him to be from a different universe, because then Old Cyc wouldn't have phased out of existence temporarily when Young Cyc died, again, temporarily."

xmen,33pqdw,lcrisler,6,Fri Apr 24 14:27:28 2015 UTC,"Am I the only ones who reads Bobby's past ""lady-crazy"" behavior not as immature, but rather overcompensating?    Judy:  Bobby's first noted romantic interest.  He was on a date with her (returning from watching a movie) when he manifested his powers publicly for the first time in order to stop her from being potentially raped by a bully.  Defending a woman's honor does not make you a heterosexual.  Zelda:  His first ""love"" from early continuity.  How many times does he stand her up, lie to her, abandon her during a date, etc?  I'll save you the research, it's over two dozen.  It could easily be argued that the whole reason he ""dated"" her in the first place was to keep up appearances (with a woman he knew he couldn't/wouldn't get close to because of his clandestine superhero lifestyle).  Less solid is the fact that almost all of Bobby's dates with Zelda were double-dates with Hank as well.  More solid evidence is this direct quote from Bobby to Zelda ""Y'know if you twist my arm, I think I could learn to like you!""  Lorna Dane:  Bobby is the first one to meet an amnesiac Polaris and shows her some of his trademark charm (ie, immature playacting at flirting?) but really kicks it into overdrive after she picks Havok over him.  This becomes a pattern with Bobby over the coming decades: being SUPER interested in an unavailable woman.  It could be argued that he's picking these women BECAUSE they are unavailable and this provides a great cover for his deep-seated gayness.  I'm not saying it's the only explanation, but it makes you think.  Darkstar:  After joining the Champions and meeting the lovely Russian Laynia, Bobby professes his ""love"" for her, too!  Ironic how once again Iceman has selected a romantic interest who is desperately homsick for Russia and will eventually pick her homeland over him.  Terri Sue Bottoms:  Not kidding about her name.  Bobby meets her in LA and they start dating.  Of course then he immediately moves back to the East Coast and breaks it off with her after a few months because she's ""too fickle.""  Just another unavailable girl to keep up pretenses it seems.  Moondragon:  Oh great, now Bobby's in love with a future lesbian.  Just kidding!   She was actually using low-level telepathy to convince both Bobby and Hank to ""love"" her.  These feelings were artificially induced and fade just in time for Bobby to meet...  Cloud:  A young woman (for now) with no memory.  Hmmmm, emotionally unavailable - check!  The only ""problem"" is that Cloud is also being telepathically drawn to Moondragon and TURNS INTO A DUDE in order to woo her.  Yup.  Bobby's new love interest is a woman who turns into a guy sometimes.  Bobby sticks it out and tries to help Cloud, but it turns out he/she is actually a nebula.  Don't ask.  Insectia:  Here's where Bobby falls in ""love"" with a supervillain (again the epitome of unavailable women) and when she finally moves in for the kiss (note he did not make the first move) - it turns out she was trying to use her powers on him and winds up infecting Beast instead.  Bobby feels guilty for not believing Hank that she was up to no good (or maybe feels guilty for putting his teammate in danger just to satisfy appearances?)  Opal Tanaka:  Yup, a nice normal girl.  Oh wait, she's actually the long-lost granddaughter of a Yakuza crime lord!  Oh, and someone else is in love with her too!  After winning Opal's hand and returning to America it turns out that Bobby's parents are super racist and don't approve of a Japanese/gaijin pairing - but that's OK because Opal's old flame shows up and sacrifices himself to save her life.  After this, Opal and Bobby get some distance between them and he ignores her until he's forced to try to save her life with the X-Men again.  She's not happy he's been giving her the ""cold"" shoulder (har har) and ends things for good.  Rogue:  Even though they weren't dating, Bobby's parents thought they were and again express disapproval.  What does Bobby respond with?  ""You're just disgusted with anything that doesn't fit into your limited definition of normal.  Sorry if I disappointed you, Dad.""  Hmmmmm, I wonder where all this self-destructive loathing came from!  Opal Tanaka:  Oh we're back to her again.  Turns out she had a baby and named him Robert.  Uh oh!  If Bobby thought he was the dad then doesn't that mean he's had sex with a woman at least once?  Nope!  Turns out it wasn't his and while watching the video Opal left explaing this, Bobby admits he knew the baby wasn't his the whole time.  Phew!  Bullet dodged!  Annie Ghazikhanian:  When Lorna and Alex get engaged, turns out the school nurse Annie is in love with Havok!  Look!  It's a woman who's in love with another man!  Time to make your move Bobby!  After explaining how he just wants to feel the warmth of a kiss, Bobby and Annie breifly share a liplock.  Annie of course breaks up the wedding after confessing her feelings to Alex (who returns them) and Bobby kinda says he still loves Lorna - but mostly just to stop her from going on a psychotic rampge and killing everyone.  Lorna (again):  Even though she's obviously in love with Havok, Lorna once again toys with Bobby's heart and uses him as her pawn to make Alex return her feelings (he's just broken up with Annie).  There's a kiss and a bunch of tension, but that's as far is it gets before Lorna runs right into Havok's arms where she belongs.  Mystique:  If you want an unavailable target to pine after, Mystique definitely fits the bill as one of the X-Men's primary antagonists.  After she gives him mouth to mouth and helps resussitate him, Iceman and Mystique grow closer.  Though I wonder if Mystique techically counts as a woman (shapeshifters don't HAVE to express an individual gender after all).  We finally have definitive proof that Iceman slept with a woman - but who knows what their sexual activity included.  Her skin was coated with a neural inhibitor anyway so it was all an act.  He runs into Mystique again shortly after, even though she's impersonating his ex Opal, and they have some very harsh words resulting in more poisoning attempts and the end of their relationship.  Kitty Pryde:  Briefly attempt a relationship for 13 issues after a fairly tepid first date that was more about having fun than having sex.  I mean, she jokes about letting him get to second base so they're most likely not boning.  Shortly after Kitty leaves the team and later the planet.  That just about covers it - and NONE of what I've detailed above even qualifies as a serious adult relationship (with the possible exception of Opal).  Bobby's been bouncing from bad decision to untenable love triangle to friends with very few benefits for decades.  I'd say this latest development is long overdue."
xmen,33pqdw,justicedemon,1 point,Sat Apr 25 03:12:08 2015 UTC,"This is probably the best response I've seen to the ""Iceman revelation"" yet, honestly. I'd still argue there's better ways this could have come about, but the sort of writing we're getting these days in X-Men wouldn't lend itself to this.   Could you have just seen this as a 90's Lobdell or Nicieza long con? Over about a year's worth of subplot, Bobby starts acting weird, going missing for periods of time, distracted on missions. etc? Finally, Gambit tails Bobby one night, expecting to find him meeting up with Mr. Sinister or something. Instead...MON DIEU! Bobby's...going to a gay bar!?  But nope. We get young Bobby's mind plundered by young Jean. >_<"
xmen,33pqdw,PG2009,6,Sat Apr 25 09:08:18 2015 UTC,"It seems the author of this piece hasn't been following Bendis' All X-Men run, or forgotten some of it.  Check out these quotes from the article:   So, here’s Bobby Drake, who’s been around telepaths his entire life–to include Charles Xavier, the most powerful psychic in the Marvel Universe–but only now does one pick up on him being gay? I call bullshit.    No, this is the young Bobby Drake from the 60's, NOT our current Drake.  1960's Bobby had only recently met Xavier and knew no other telepaths, AFAIK....This blogger is assuming that eventually the gay Bobby will go back in time and become the adult Bobby we know.  Several times, the series has hinted at major differences between the young characters and their supposed older counterparts.  This latest bombshell follows that trend.   We still have Jean Grey invading a person’s mind. As far as comic book telepaths go, a willingness to do this sort of crap is what defines the good guys from the bad guys.   Yes, and at several points in the series, people tell her it bothers them and not to do it.  She violates them anyway.  It's an ongoing problem and yet another difference between the young X-Men and the older ones.  In regular canon, Jean didn't even have telepathic powers in the early years, much less use them unethically."
xmen,33pqdw,PG2009,3,Fri Apr 24 17:11:27 2015 UTC,"This Bobby Drake should be the direct, past version of present Iceman. Proof? Because young Cyclops is the direct, past version of present Cyclops. Remember Battle of the Atom? Also written by Bendis, I might add. Young Scott was hurt and Current Scott blinked out of existence!   So, now that we've established they're the same person...Bendis went and did something to past Iceman that obviously makes no sense when you compare it to what you know of present Iceman. Here's a couple other examples:  Northstar came out as gay a couple decades back. It was ""cool and edgy"" because it hadn't been done before, but it was present-time Northstar revealing something about himself that added depth to the character without contradicting what we already knew about him.  Ultimate Colossus--totally gay. And it was cool because it was the Ultimate Universe and everything and everyone was being reimagined. There was no reason Ultimate Colossus being gay didn't make sense.  This Iceman thing? Is not like either of those."
xmen,33pqdw,Exodus111,2,Fri Apr 24 21:01:33 2015 UTC,"Young Scott was hurt and Current Scott blinked out of existence!   I remember that!  But it didn't really make any sense....Old Scott just blinked back when young Scott was healed.  Seems like, since young Scott was healed, old Scott shouldn't have disappeared in the first place.  It could be crappy writing, but I suspect a key eliminate of all this is that we never actually SAW how beast brought them forward in time.  Did he get the right dimension?  Maybe he just grew some  -=shudder=- clones or robots or something?  I think (hope) this Battleworld stuff is going to reveal more about their origins, and I don't think it's as clear cut as its being presented."
xmen,33pqdw,bizzals,2,Fri Apr 24 22:50:58 2015 UTC,"It could be crappy writing   Yep. Bendis has no idea how the Marvel U treats Timetravel, hence his flubbering mess that was Age of Ultron(the comic), Bendis desperate attempt at getting one of his moronic stories into Hollywood cannon. Thank god Whedon totally ignored that shit."
xmen,33pqdw,majeric,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:25:28 2015 UTC,"Crappy writing, for sure. That's part of my whole argument. I think this is the first time Bendis has stooped as low as Austen, though. =P"

The good raised in evil was her original characterization, seen in most or the original new mutants run. In my opinion all have their strengths. But the latter two are where the character's coming from these days.   I'd say that take started with an alt-reality version of the character in exiles 22. Then writers forgot about her until New X-Men, I think number 41. She was evil trying to be good until very recently where she's been more neutral and level headed."

xmen,33nlgx,SmilesUndSunshine,3,Fri Apr 24 12:14:28 2015 UTC,"Here's my cut & paste response for every time this is asked --- I recommend starting with Chris Claremont's run that made the X-Men popular --- Giant Size X-Men #1, Uncanny X-Men #94-280, the graphic novel ""God Loves, Man Kills"", and X-Men: Vignettes 1 & 2.   This is an extremely helpful site: http://crushingkrisis.com/collecting-x-men-comic-books-as-graphic-novels/  There's also a good documentary about Chris Claremont's X-Men: http://sequart.org/movies/4/comics-in-focus-chris-claremonts-x-men/  If you want to skip around rather than reading every issue, here are my favorite story arcs, in chronological order:   Proteus (Uncanny 125-128) -- their first really dangerous enemy; I highly recommend the trade paperback which has some great additional stories Dark Phoenix Saga (Uncanny 129-137) -- widely considered the best ever, not my favorite though Days of Future Past (Uncanny 141-142) -- Kitty travels back in time from a dystopian future God Loves, Man Kills (graphic novel) -- possibly the best place for a newcomer to start The Brood Saga (Uncanny 154-158, 161-167) -- a mix of Alien & The Matrix, includes the first meeting of Magneto & Professor X (#161) and the first meeting of the X-men & Rogue Wolverine (Claremont/Miller limited series 1-4) -- the first Wolverine comics, must-read From the Ashes (Uncanny 168-176) -- one of Joss Whedon's favorite runs; Wolverine's wedding; Rogue joins the X-Men; Storm gets a mohawk Havok & Wolverine: Meltdown (limited series 1-4) -- highly recommended, great artwork X-Treme X-Men: Mekanix -- must-read for Kitty Pryde fans. Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men run 1-24 (the Warren Ellis run after this is also good). The Whedon run also has an amazing motion comic partially available on Netflix. Remender's Uncanny X-Force (Vol. 1)   Morrison's New X-Men gets recommended a lot, but I think it's extremely overrated and generally disappointing."
xmen,33nlgx,TheoAdorno,2,Fri Apr 24 21:27:29 2015 UTC,"THIS.  I was going to post something very similar to this.    Start with Claremont's run that started in 1975.  Maybe not all the way back to 1975, but Proteus is a good place.  Phoenix shows up at around Uncanny 100.  Claremont defined the X-Men.  A lot of X-Men plots to this day build off what Claremont created.  I'd also recommend the Magik 4-issue mini-series (which follows Uncanny 160) and a few Kitty-centric issues from the 80's (Uncanny 143 and 153).  I cannot emphasize enough that you should at least read some of Claremont's run (Dark Phoenix, DOFP, and the Brood Saga for starters)."

xmen,33nlgx,SexyPoro,1 point,Fri Apr 24 09:22:04 2015 UTC,Excellent guide! I think this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for.
xmen,33nlgx,xooxanthellae,2,Fri Apr 24 10:55:41 2015 UTC,"Don't, get out while you still can.  I'm joking, of course. While there are many ways to get into X-men comics, I would not recommend doing so by starting with a side series (like New Mutants or Alpha Flight (especially not Alpha Flight)), crossover tie-ins, or the Ultimate universe.  Really, though, it all comes down to what era of comics you like. In my opinion, the coolest thing about the X-men is that they're an old team, and they're one of those groups that change a lot depending on what time period you read in. If you like 90s comics, take /u/SexyPoro 's suggestion and start with the Claremont/Lee run (I didn't include links for these series because I don't know how to do links that don't look horrible yet). If you don't mind 70s comics, I REALLY suggest going all the way back to the beginning of Chris Claremont's run and the introduction of the newer team (with Storm and Colossus and all). And hey, if you don't like comics older than the late 90s/early 2000s, you'd probably be better off starting with Grant Morrison's New X-men or Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-men.  The X-men universe can take some time to kind of...figure out. Shameless promotion here, but I use http://uncannyxmen.net/ to look up characters and events that I don't know/remember, especially when dealing with comics that were published before 2004 or so. IT'S A GREAT SITE.  In summary, there are many, MANY places to start reading X-men comics, and where you pick should rely on what era of comics you enjoy most. Start from there, get a feel for who the X-men are, and then branch out (if you want- another cool thing about the X-men is there is A LOT OF IT). Have fun reading, the Rachel and Miles podcast is definitely worth a look, and pay attention to the recommended reading list.  EDIT: Also, it can be frustrating, but try to be patient in regards to getting a hold of certain comics. Not sure how you get your comics (physical copies, torrenting, etc) but there are entire titles that can be harder to find, and some of them aren't even worth finding imo. Read what you can, and use summaries online to fill in the blanks until you can find the comic itself."
xmen,33nlgx,Mevansuto,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:48:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for a thorough reply!   I guess I have a confession here: This will be my first true delving into comics... Ever. I've gotten Graphic Novels here and there but most comics I've ever read have been Web Comics (Lol) or digital free copies I've picked up from random website sales. With this I don't know I have a preference of era.  I'm also loving this podcast but, of course so many of the things they hit on still feel out of grasp, so many names I simply don't know from my limited experience. But I feel like I'll stick with it.  My plans so far are hoping to find digital copies to dive into as 98% of my life is spent in front of my PC.  I'll take a nod to the era comment though and see if I can find a visual style comparison, as I don't know that I could handle the art from the stuff which was much older. Spoiled by new age graphics and the kids with their 1080p and stuff."
xmen,33nlgx,chasers_,2,Fri Apr 24 12:11:52 2015 UTC,"Well, the X-men is a...challenging place to start, in some respects, since there's so much history. Very convoluted history, at that. On the plus side, though, after Secret Wars (the upcoming Marvel event) there's going to be something of a reboot, so you might not have to worry about remembering the details too much.  That feeling of not knowing who some characters and events are is an integral part of the X-men experience. Embrace it, learn from it, use your desire to find out who the hell these people are to get through boring stories. Really, it's something that you have to deal with when reading any long-running series, but it's particularly bad in some eras.  As for era preferences...well, different time periods feature (by and large) different styles of writing, art and overall stories. This has a lot to do with what writers and artists were popular at the time. For example, the 90s featured all that grim and gritty Liefeldian nonsense that the era is well known for, and for that reason alone I know a few people who simply refuse to read a large portion of X-men comics from the 90s. It's hard to get a sense of what you like without reading stuff before hand, so if it's an option for you I'd really suggest going to your local library and seeing if they have any comics on hand (or just raiding a friend's stash, if that's an option). Also keep in mind that not all writing and art from any point in time in comics is (are?) equal- there are some things that are better than others.  I'll look around for a visual style comparison, if you like. : )"

He's ""lesser known"" because he's not the original X-Men, Storm, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Fantastic 4.

Fact: Despite what all these conspiracy theories insist, Marvel knows that losing millions from destroying the X-Men franchise in the short term isn't going to make Fox give back the rights to X-Men movies, because...  Fact: Fox doesn't need an ongoing X-Men title.  There's plenty of stories they can grab from (or just make up).  Fact: X-Men movies, with or without X-Men comics, are going to be popular, special effects-ridden action films that will pull in $200+ million anyway.  Fact: The hype of a new X-Men movie generates interest in comic books, so Marvel is still benefiting.  Why would Marvel caught off its own nose to spite its face?  Especially for film rights they will never get back?  The reason so many X-titles are being cancelled is because there's too damn many of them and some of them are treated like low-tier crap (or Marvel cuts them off because they're not making enough money quickly enough).

However, in Ultimate Marvel, mutants were revealed to be a result of a Weapon X program which release a trigger into the wild.   If they reveal a similar method of granting random ""powers"" instead of mutations, They can take the whole thing out from under Fox. But they won't be X-Men. They won't be mutants. That takes away so much of the meaning of the original, that this is a core part of who they are... and we have to start looking for new names, new faces, when we've had fifty years of material to establish connections with the comic book immortal characters.  I think the format needs a change. Comic book immortality is dying, and series like Walking Dead prove that we want a more mature and realistic approach to story telling. X-Men will never be dead to me, and I think that it has made an indelible mark on society. However, I can see your point.

Why would they? Just out of spite?   Point 1) As Chris Clairemont understands it, new characters have to be introduced through cross over events to avoid movie rights issues. Okay. First off, that's just as one guy, who is writing one book, understands it. Second off, it seems like a really easy work around. Why would they throw out the whole concept when they can get around by introducing the characters through events?  Point 2) They're cancelling a lot of shit, including Avengers, Thor, and Hulk. I don't see this as compelling evidence of anything at all.   Point 3) Yeah, this silly retcon probably has something to do with movie rights, but again, so what? I don't see how it's evidence of anything. If they actually retconned them to not be mutants it would be a little more compelling that they're trying to remove the whole concept, but as of now they're still mutants.   Point 4) This has nothing to do with anything, and even bringing it up worsens your argument. Are you trying to suggest that Bendis has some kind of personal vendetta that caused him to do that storyline and now try and get rid of all the rest of the mutants? That's a little insane.   As to your edit, wut? I don't have unlimited, but according to a search of marvel's website there's plenty of post 1991 X-Men on it. What possible good could removing some X-Men comics from marvel unlimited do them? In what possible way could it be evidence of an imminent removal of all X-Men related stuff from their continuity?   Your arguments are all weirdly emotional. It seems more like you're trying to convince me that Marvel hates mutants than that they're going to cancel their mutant books.  I'm not saying they won't, but there's not a lot of compelling evidence beyond speculation regarding movie rights, and in my mind, if the X-Men were worth publishing before Marvel even got into the movie game, then they're worth publishing now. They're a for-profit company, and it would be throwing away a lot of profit for no good reason."

xmen,33lrlp,HateKiller,2,Thu Apr 23 20:50:01 2015 UTC,"we have seen Bobby in many believable romances that left him devastated when they fell apart.   As a gay guy, I can say that the pressure to conform is immense and that relationships with women aren't devoid of emotion. One can feel love for a woman even if there isn't a strong physical attraction. A breakup can be devastating because it means that that a gay guy failed to conform and they've lost someone they truely loved. Gay guys often have women who are their best friends, and closeted gay guys trying to conform will always see their female partners as their best friend and closest confident.   That said. It would just make more sense if Bobby was bisexual. Something a 1960s Bobby might suppress and ignore while a 2015 Bobby might want to explore."

Awkward to be sure. I think they could have made him bisexual with him exploring relationships with guys without necessarily negating all the relationships with women that he's had thus far. (A 1960s bisexual may not explore same-sex relationships where a 2015 bisexual might)   If they had made Iceman gay in Ultimate X-Men, when they reboot the story I would have no problem (they did it with Colossus)   Well, in as much as I do like the Ultimate universe and Colossus, I think relegating gay characters to your secondary universe kind of sucks but I do get your point.   this is just poor execution on Bendis's part.   Yes. There's something called ""bi-erasure"" in the LGBT community where a lot of gay guys don't think bisexuals exist because a lot of gay guys use the ""bisexual"" label in their coming out process. It's all confirmation bias.  So when Jean uses the term ""Full Gay"" when Ice-Man suggests he might be ""Bi"" is kind of discriminatory."
xmen,33lrlp,majeric,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:04:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's relegating, I think it was the first ripe opportunity to start fresh.

xmen,33lrlp,HateKiller,5,Fri Apr 24 20:44:42 2015 UTC,What if this is a different bobby? What if these xmen were actually from a different dimension and not just a timeline. Maybe their universe was destroyed by an incursion and that's why they can't go back.
xmen,33lrlp,wolfharte,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:38:33 2015 UTC,I've seen this theory thrown around some but if you read this interview with Axel Alonso it seems like this will be applying to adult Iceman as well.

Gay or straight, I'd love more emotionally fulfilling stories for my favorite X-Man so I'm hoping for the best."
xmen,33lrlp,kevtron3k,-1,Fri Apr 24 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"Do you even read X-Men? Nowhere in the entire ""All-New"" arch does it mention alternate dimensions. You are building your argument on an assumption."
xmen,33lrlp,HateKiller,2,Fri Apr 24 01:17:15 2015 UTC,"I've read the entire run of this book. It's just a theory based on some very odd stuff happening in the universe. They've never explained why these xmen can't go back to their own time. I know Beast believes Doom's time machine works within a single universe.  It could very easily prove to be a false theory, but it was one that made me think. It would answer a lot of questions.   Also, I'm not making an argument here. I was presenting a theory, which I will admit is built with a lot of tinfoil."

I understand wanting to give your actors freedom to make the characters theirs - I think McAvoy and Fassbender created fantastic, distinct characters that can still believably age into their older selves. With Beast there's such a huge disconnect between the old and young that.   Maybe we'll see more growth in Apocalypse, because in Days I was expecting to see a few more Grammar-isms, classic Beast things. Its extra weird because Nicholas Hoult is British, so it wouldn't be a problem to put on that slight affectation to the voice to sound more like Grammar or animated Beast."

xmen,33in4m,Showbuckle,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:58:53 2015 UTC,"First I want to say that I love comixology.  I have all my favorite books on my phone and kindle fire. There are new 99cent Marvel sales every Monday and Friday. I only buy the 99cent comics on comixology plus I redeem the codes that come with the comics I buy as the come out (your marvel account syncs with Comixology). Super convenient.   As far as where to pick up, that's a tough question because there are so many variables.  Personally, I'd recommend going back to Messiah Complex and working forward (see sidebar).    But to be ""up to speed"" you could probably pick up Avengers vs X-Men and work forward.    Or if you don't want to ""go back"", this summer's Secret Wars seems like it will be rebooting much of the Marvel universe (x-men included).  Depending on how much damage (or change) they do, there may not be much need to read too many back issues."

Ultimately, their end goal was more or less the same, it was the methods employed that set the two apart.  Now, I don't know. I haven't bought an X comic in a very long time, but from I hear Xavier's methods seem more shifty, even downright going against the principles of what he founded the school on. I hear even less about Magneto, but from what little I have heard, he seems to go from moderate to extreme and back again. I could be wrong on that, so feel free to correct me."

xmen,33ghtr,WeavieStunder,7,Wed Apr 22 17:41:41 2015 UTC,Rick Remender's Uncanny X-Force (vol 1) was easily the best ongoing series I've read in the last decade.  The first 20 issues through the Dark Angel saga were absolutely phenomenal.  I think they released an omnibus collection but you should be able to find trades too.    Astonishing is another fantastic choice but it sounds like you already have that one on the way!

Remender's run was issues 1-35  Part 1  Part 2  What I love is that the series does a great job of building on 40 years of lore without requiring prior knowledge of any of it.  Anything you need to know to understand the story is clearly laid out.

At the bare minimum, read God Loves Man Kills, Claremont/Miller Wolverine, and Wolverine: Meltdown. The newer stuff will not have the same impact if you don't know some of the history of the characters.  here are my favorite story arcs, in chronological order:   Proteus (Uncanny 125-128) -- their first really dangerous enemy; I highly recommend the trade paperback which has some great additional stories Dark Phoenix Saga (Uncanny 129-137) -- widely considered the best ever, not my favorite though Days of Future Past (Uncanny 141-142) -- Kitty travels back in time from a dystopian future God Loves, Man Kills (graphic novel) -- possibly the best place for a newcomer to start The Brood Saga (Uncanny 154-158, 161-167) -- a mix of Alien & The Matrix, includes the first meeting of Magneto & Professor X (#161) and the first meeting of the X-men & Rogue Wolverine (Claremont/Miller limited series 1-4) -- the first Wolverine comics, must-read From the Ashes (Uncanny 168-176) -- one of Joss Whedon's favorite runs; Wolverine's wedding; Rogue joins the X-Men; Storm gets a mohawk Havok & Wolverine: Meltdown (limited series 1-4) -- highly recommended, great artwork X-Treme X-Men: Mekanix -- must-read for Kitty Pryde fans. Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men run 1-24 (the Warren Ellis run after this is also good). The Whedon run also has an amazing motion comic partially available on Netflix.

Humans get 2 copies of most alleles, and if they differ either the dominant allele is expressed or the traits blend. Men only get one copy of the X Chromosome, so whatever alleles they get are automatically going to be the ones expressed. Like a one-armed man, you don't need to guess if he is right or left handed because he has only one option."

The history of how men demonize, hate and fear women unless women are under their control would come to a head and be made obvious in a world like that. And the great thing is that the women mutants would finally have the power to defend themselves. Many of them who could hide it, would have to live in stealth. But I imagine a kind of underground railroad situation where sisters help sisters. This is similar to the idea, ""What if men could get pregnant? Then Congress would absolutely stipulate that birth control be paid for by the public."" It would put so many things on its head. I think it's a great idea ripe for its own Marvel continuity.

Irreversible as far as we know.  Young Beast used Jeans telepathy to copy all of Old Beasts mind (or just his scientific knowledge, or just his knowledge of Old Beasts unique biology). Easily fixable by a psychic.  Young Cyclops has experience and training from being a space pirate. Easily fixable by a psychic.  Young Iceman is gay when Old Iceman isn't, and as confirmed from a tweet by Bendis he isn't saying it's possible to stop being gay by choice, and as you mentioned they confirm Old Iceman isn't, so this counts as a difference. Also in Uncanny X-Men Vol. 1 the part where Old Beast appears and brings them to the future occurs in the beginning of issue 8, and in a later issue of All-New, Young Iceman says he totally touched Unus the Untouchable who they don't meet until the end of issue 8, well after the part Old Beast pulls them out of.  And finally Jean Grey, having the most prominent differences. She has those pink psionic powers from mixing her telekinesis with her telepathy, she is acting like a nosy bitch all the time despite not having the phoenix, and she got her telepathy early.  I guess Bendis' endgame is that these are not the young versions of the 616 X-Men, and after Secret Wars they're gonna stay in the present forever."

xmen,33ag9n,stratargy,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:44:09 2015 UTC,"Emma actually inhabited Bobby's mind for a while.  She knows him very well, and knowing how Emma has always used inside, discrete information to her advantage, she would have done something about the idea that he was closeted.  She didn't, he's not."
xmen,33ag9n,detourne,2,Thu Apr 23 16:31:59 2015 UTC,I took it as Bobby is bi and just closested his gay side. Remember when he overreacted when Northstar joined the team? They could somehow tie it into that.
xmen,33ag9n,jedispyder,5,Tue Apr 21 16:08:11 2015 UTC,Then Northstar claimed Bobby was definitely straight and encouraged Annie the nurse to go after him IIRC.

I think I'm going to do so again.  Fortunately the IDW Transformers series' are still excellent, so I don't have to give up the hobby completely.  And before the SJWs crawl up my butt, I'm not quitting for this alone, but this is the last in a long line of straws that have been piling up for a while now.  The exceedingly bad way they're handling not only this but X-23/Angel in the same bloody issue has finally broken this camel's back."

xmen,33ag9n,ThawbutSad,18,Tue Apr 21 17:25:29 2015 UTC,I think this Bendis run is going to go down as one of the worst X-Men runs of all time.
xmen,33ag9n,whiskeybill,8,Tue Apr 21 03:57:31 2015 UTC,"There was some good stuff in there, if you like Bendis, which I do. But nothing could be worse than Chuck Austen's Uncanny run from the early-mid 2000's. It wasn't that it was necessarily bad script writing or anything, just really terrible ideas. Did you know that Nightcrawler and Angel are from separate races of mutants that are basically actually demons and angels? Yup. Thanks Chuck Austen."
xmen,33ag9n,ActualButt,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:04:50 2015 UTC,"Haha I was unaware there were multiple races of mutants.  I take it back, that sounds way worse."
xmen,33ag9n,whiskeybill,2,Tue Apr 21 15:00:12 2015 UTC,"Not races per se, but like, lineages...or something. Kind of like there's a lineage of feral mutants that includes Wolverine, Wolfsbane, Sabretooth, Feral, Wild Child, Thornn, etc. called the Lupine. They're humans that evolved from wolves instead of apes. Or maybe that's just a lie told by Romulus, the two thousand year old feral mutant who resembles Wolverine and was trying to create a new race of feral mutants. You can blame that one on Jeph Loeb."
xmen,33ag9n,ActualButt,3,Tue Apr 21 15:12:38 2015 UTC,"See, that idea isn't total shit though.  There should be different lines of mutations. It's what happens in nature as a way to delineate species, even some differing species even adapt similar characteristics over time, like Hyenas are actually more directly related to felines then canines, yet they've evolved to be more in line with modern dogs.   The execution was bullshit, not the idea."
xmen,33ag9n,detourne,2,Tue Apr 21 15:35:52 2015 UTC,"Well, it's subjective. I think the opposite is usually true with Loeb. Crappy ideas with good execution. This one was crappy on both fronts I think.  And the way I see it, it's a really bad idea to try to inject actual science into superhero comics. It just sort of falls apart when you think about it too much. Sure, hyenas may share common ancestors with cats yet appear more similar to dogs, but Wolverine and other ""lupine"" mutants have procreated with humans and human-mutants. Wouldn't that require more precise genetic similarity than hyenas share with canine or lupine species?  It's nitpicking, but that's the nature of comic fandom."
xmen,33ag9n,ActualButt,7,Tue Apr 21 15:53:39 2015 UTC,"At the end of last year I would have disagreed with you, but they way it is wrapping up, fuck man. Just wake me when Secret Wars is over."
xmen,33ag9n,GoldandBlue,4,Tue Apr 21 06:59:00 2015 UTC,"Seriously, why bother caring about any of this when Secret Wars is just going to wipe the slate clean.  There were some good ideas in the beginning of this run but its been going absolutely nowhere for like a year now.  So disappointing."
xmen,33ag9n,whiskeybill,2,Tue Apr 21 14:59:16 2015 UTC,"He does have good ideas but they go nowhere. They all end in a dud and you are not sure,if it sticks or not. The whole Mallow arc went against everytging the X-Men stand for."
xmen,33ag9n,GoldandBlue,3,Tue Apr 21 20:00:40 2015 UTC,"A year ago, I'd have laughed at you for that statement.  Now, I'm starting to agree with you.    One thing gives me hope, and that's a theory I posted elsewhere.  The ONLY way this makes sense (because why not just wait for the Post-Secret Wars continuity reshuffle to make a change this big?), is that this another ""brilliant"" editorial mandate forced on Bendis (much like Jean's death was forced on Morrison), and that Bendis delayed it JUST long enough that he can say he complied with the directive, while knowing that Secret Wars will wipe out most of the truly inane crap of the last year.  That is my solemn hope, because if I""m wrong, Secret Wars will be the end of my Marvel tenure.  I've put up with too much of bad retcon bullshit in the last few years. I Barely tolerated the Maximoff Retcon from Axis.  This is the straw that broke the proverbial camel for me.    My inner writer is HOWLING at how badly this was done."
xmen,33ag9n,Barachiel1976,2,Wed Apr 22 22:28:15 2015 UTC,"I am fine that Marvel decided to make Young Iceman gay. What I am not fine with is the fact that the Young X-men will still need to go back to their own time eventually so the continuity remains intact. We all know that the Young X-men and present day X-men are the same,  just the younger versions displaced in time. If they return to their time, when that happens they will need to have their experiences mind-wiped by the past Professor Xavier, thus ultimately pushing Bobby back into ""the closet."" Not cool Marvel. Not cool."
xmen,33ag9n,awf7,2,Wed Apr 22 23:17:11 2015 UTC,"preface: i am quite pro gay rights etc etc. thought i should add that here due to how some points may come off.  i like bendis' work on xmen comics. but idk if it's a colouring of it by reading his blog or what, but this feels like the most shoehorned in self indulgent progressive thing he has done in his run here so far.  like i said maybe it's reading his blog that colours that - between his routine self congratulation for being uber progressive and rarely talking about xmen except to qq about fans or post release promos each week for each of his comics that are coming out. or so it seems.  i don't even mind wether young bobby is gay or not, just that is feels more tacked on and self indulgent than when kitty suddenly started using stereotypical jewish idioms for a few issues out of no where only to suddenly stop out of no where again.  all new is the series that brought me back to comics, and i greatly enjoy it even if it's kind of lost direction for a while now and become obviously a distant second to bendis' preferred series while becoming more disconnected within his overall run (ie each series being disconnected from each other only to clump back together in odd ways, despite the potentially too frequent cross overs) than axis felt from the rest of the marvel comics i was reading.  we've got kitty and magik in space in black vortex, while kitty and magik are teaming up to bring in a new mutant (another point of self indulgence - one thing bendis likes to bitch about on his blog in regards to xmen fans is his perception that fans claim he doesn't make enough new mutants, the day that issue released he was bragging up hard about making that new mutant- this is a regular point of xmen fan qq with him on his blog).  i felt like the dialogue itself was believable and in line with how it might go down in real life if a friend confronted another friend with what was very obvious to people. but on the other hand it also feels shoehorned on to this character and feeds in to at least a few overly obviously stereotypes of the try hard to appear straight repressed gay boy or the idea that sucking at romantic relationships must mean you're gay ( mean this is xmen we're talking about where the longest running romance arc in the franchise ended with scott cheating on jean with emma and jean going full dark phoenix mode and dying paving the way for emma x scott power couple of the aughts - never mind scott x maddie...).  ultimately it's one of bendis' weaknesses that for whatever reasons his editors aren't saying no to him maybe as much as they should or not guiding him as much as they should maybe idk.  though to be honest - again with his blog, he comes off like self interested self righteous dick alot of the time there outside of the limited talk of xmen, which again tends to be few and far between outside of the weekly release promo post and the occasional qq about xmen fans' qq."

xmen,33ag9n,ActualButt,3,Tue Apr 21 12:58:28 2015 UTC,"Especially X-Men. X-Men has always been one of the soapiest superhero comics, or at least one that's most about personal relationships. You can't get within thirty feet of an X-Men comic without getting hit with personal life drama stuff. That's a big part of why a lot of people like it in the first place. Even the punch-hit-shoot-stab X-Men books mix in a whole lot of that."

xmen,339ezc,WSable,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:26:33 2015 UTC,The only essential comics to read before are Wolverine v5 and v6 because they show how he loses his healing factor and then how he deals with that. Death of Wolverine is a very self-contained story and doesn't cross over with any other X-titles tbh so those two are all that's relevant to it.   However if you want a general background on Wolverine's role at that point in time you could start at Schism and then read Wolverine and The X-Men v1 and v2.
xmen,339ezc,RaoulSeagull,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:32:22 2015 UTC,"Wolverine v5 and v6, as mentioned, is a good place to start before reading DoW.

Both of those titles set up and lead into the weekly Wolverines series that is still running."

Think of it this way - if we stick with the current universe, some of the cooler characters are just teenagers or in their 20s in DOFP (Kitty Pryde, Blink, Warpath...etc). That means in the First Class world, they can't use these characters unless they want toddlers running around in diapers.  Just reboot the entire series, even with a new Wolverine (I'm afraid Hugh Jackman is going to start showing signs of aging soon).   Edit: Everyone hop onboard the downvote train!

Second of all, you are misinterpreting what ""some of the cooler"" means. It doesn't mean they are more cool than the current X-Men. It's an expression. There's some cool mutants that Fox can't use, like Kitty Pryde, because she's still young as of DOFP."
xmen,337k3o,VegaThePunisher,-2,Tue Apr 21 00:48:50 2015 UTC,"Kitty Pryde was in the original DOFP, first of all. She was featured in the future story.   Secondly, the next X-Men movie should take place in the 80s after the DOFP storyline.   Third, your opinion being disagreed with, and incorrect, is why you got the downvotes.   Kitty Pryde, Warpath (as Thunderbird), etc. could easily be in the next X-men movie.   Thridly"
xmen,337k3o,cleantoe,3,Tue Apr 21 04:25:39 2015 UTC,"No they can't. Dude, Xavier says in the first X-Men film at the end that he ""knows a little girl who can run through walls"". So she's like 10 years old or something - a kid - when Patrick Stewart was playing Xavier. For the First Class timeline, she isn't even born. And how can Warpath possibly be in the 80s when he was already in the DOFP future? Just because you alter a timeline doesn't magically mean a person can be born decades in the past."
xmen,337k3o,NunoM,-1,Tue Apr 21 12:45:09 2015 UTC,Isn't she like 40? I think Rogue needs to be recast for someone younger and with way more attitude to inject into the role.

xmen,32zz0b,JargonPhat,-8,Sat Apr 18 06:18:48 2015 UTC,I've always liked Havok better than Cyclops (most universes' cyclop's). Scott is too boring.

xmen,32zz0b,akirafryer,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:27:19 2015 UTC,"Havok (comics):       Havok (Alexander ""Alex"" Summers) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. He first appears in Uncanny X-Men No. 54 (March 1969), and was created by Arnold Drake, Don Heck, and Neal Adams. Havok generates powerful “plasma blasts”, an ability he has had difficulty controlling. He is the son of Corsair, the younger brother of the X-Men's Cyclops, and the older brother of Vulcan. He often resents Cyclops' authoritarian attitude and reputation as a model X-Man.

xmen,331ctk,sapi3nce,0,Mon Apr 20 16:45:13 2015 UTC,I think they've both been horsemen at some point. My thinking on Hank is that we might get a movie-friendly version of Dark Beast if he becomes a horseman.

Havok seems like a good contender for War, I'd put him around 90%.  I don't think Psylocke is going to be one of the four.  Instead I think she is going to come from some of the future scenes (given that Blink is back, I think we're going to get some incarnation of AoA).  Beast seems to be a possibility, playing off some of the Dark Beast tenancies from AoA.  I think we see Ink come back from DoFP to fill in Pestilence."

xmen,330m19,wellssh,3,Sat Apr 18 13:00:15 2015 UTC,Drowning him will cut off the oxygen from his brain which might prevent him from regenerating.
xmen,330m19,Mevansuto,3,Sun Apr 19 10:14:27 2015 UTC,Probably the way he killed Deadpool in The Wolverine Movie.....   Decapitation...
xmen,330m19,Gambit215,2,Sat Apr 18 13:56:10 2015 UTC,Deadpool's head was still alive.
xmen,330m19,slicwilli,2,Sat Apr 18 17:46:42 2015 UTC,It's also more difficult to decapitate Wolverine because of the adamantium infused to his spinal column. Your cut would have to be extremely precise to hit the cartilage only. Probably why it's never been done before.
xmen,330m19,SMB73,5,Sat Apr 18 19:29:21 2015 UTC,"It might be easier to do what they did to colossus, and just pull him apart, instead of cutting.  Then it tears apart at the cartilage, no need to aim.    Also, a heat beam like what hit iceman could probably melt his brain inside the adamantium and destroy it before it could heal, or melt the cartilage and his head just naturally falls off since its no longer attached to anything.  Either way it would be super gory."

xmen,330m19,SMB73,1 point,Mon Apr 20 12:41:21 2015 UTC,His cartridge is organic. It'll rip unless that's one of his mutant powers.
xmen,330m19,SMB73,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:23:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know that. The metal covers the exterior of the bone only, not the cartilage that separates each piece of the vertebrata (or any ligament in his body). If it were, he wouldn't be able to move.   So if someone wanted to cut his head off, they'd have to aim for the 1st or 2nd cervical ligaments (which only a few millimeters spaced apart), then cut cleanly through at the perfect angle."
xmen,330m19,ActualButt,0,Mon Apr 20 13:45:48 2015 UTC,His superpower is healing. His bones covered in metal doesn't mean he's invulnerable.
xmen,330m19,SMB73,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:54:47 2015 UTC,"Again, yes I know this. That's why I said ""cleanly through"". His healing ability isn't instantaneous, it takes time to regenerate. If all the factors I mentioned above were to happen, you could cut his head off."
xmen,330m19,ActualButt,0,Mon Apr 20 13:59:10 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't have to be a perfect angle. Once the blade finds it's path, it'll go through with enough force. His only defense might be to arch his neck forwards or backwards, depending on the direction of the strike. But it would be easy enough for one sentinel to hold his head and torso in place while another severs the spine. Or really, at that point, just pull his head off and don't even bother with the cut.  EDIT: Also, it wouldn't necessarily have to be at the 1st or 2nd ligaments. You could hit him anywhere between the base of the skull and the shoulder blades, really."
xmen,330m19,ActualButt,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:38:33 2015 UTC,"Once the blade finds it's path, it'll go through with enough force. No, it absolutely would not. No typical blade can harm him unless it's the Muramasa Blade and that only affects his healing. No blade has been made that cuts through adamantium. So your entire argument is null and void.    The pull would absolutely work, that's the only point you have that's correct."
xmen,330m19,SMB73,0,Tue Apr 21 16:49:33 2015 UTC,The blade wouldn't be cutting through adamantium. It would be cutting through cartilage. That's the path it would find. It's sort of the nature of physics. Try reading a book without pictures once in awhile.
xmen,330m19,ActualButt,0,Tue Apr 21 17:03:50 2015 UTC,"Anything being used to cut off his head at the neck would likely find the cartilage pretty easily on it's own actually. A blade or whatever would likely slide along the adamantium on the vertebrae and into the cartilage. You'd lose some of the speed and force of the strike, but you'd still do some damage. And with enough power behind it (something the sentinels have in spades), that damage would easily be enough to separate the head from the body. I think that's what /u/Rabid_Catbus meant.  I'm sure you read the entire statement, but maybe you ought to actually think about it for a second before making a dumb comment."
xmen,330m19,SMB73,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:35:02 2015 UTC,"A blade or whatever would likely slide along the adamantium on the vertebrae and into the cartilage.   Guess this is where we disagree. I believe any blade that doesn't hit the mark perfectly would bounce off the neck bones. And no, you'd essentially do no damage against Wolverine in this manner. You must be thinking of him without his adamantium in the past. But yet, another dumb comment."
xmen,330m19,ActualButt,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:47:00 2015 UTC,"Right, because when you slam a blade into metal, it bounces? What planet do you live on?"
xmen,330m19,neoblackdragon,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:02:03 2015 UTC,"In this real-world life, yes a traditional blade will cut into another, softer metal. But we're not talking about that world, are we? Adamantium is the hardest metal in the MU, not even the same metal will cut through it. So, yes it would in fact bounce off his neck because it's hitting against the same metal. The chances that the swing is so precise that it falls perfectly between the vertebrae and into the cartilage of a moving target is highly likely."
xmen,330875,ArdentlyCore,8,Sat Apr 18 05:59:29 2015 UTC,"I took it to mean ""if you don't let me go (and the police-government gets me) they'll experiment on and kill me."""
xmen,330875,Iron-Knuckle,7,Sat Apr 18 11:31:01 2015 UTC,"IMO, what Erik meant was that Charles keeping him there was tantamount to killing him, something that would violate the professor's moral code. And thus, Charles lets Erik go, because despite all this, Charles is not a killer.   Either that or he's trying to say that he is going to be used as a propaganda piece against mutant kind that will make all their work obsolete."

It's kind of like a film noir detective thing as he tracks down mutant haters and nazis and has some brutal scenes. Some other really dark series which feature Wolverine are Uncanny X-Force v1 and X-Force v3, both really good, uncanny's more recent but a bit mythology heavy so would avoid if you don't know a lot of X-Men back-story."

xmen,32yga5,Exodus111,2,Fri Apr 17 20:51:38 2015 UTC,"Hmm. For a more serious tone you would typically have to go outside of the Superhero world, but there are exceptions.  I would actually recommend all of Alias, a Brian Michael Bendis comic book that ran 30 some episodes. This was before Bendis succumbed to delusions of grandeur and became a plague upon the Marvel universe, back then he was actually a really amazing writer.   Also Alias follows Jessica Jones, and she is next up in the Netflix Marvel line, before defenders. That show will be entirely based on that comic, so it's about to become way more relevant putting you in before everyone else, hipster style."

Born Again is the ""conclusion"" of that perfection he managed to capture from his original run. Both heavily influenced the Netflix's series (you should watch it!).  DC's Kingdom Come. (Yes, this comes from a life-long Marvel fan). Just do yourself a favor and buy it, Alex Ross' art is as brilliant as it gets, and together with Mark Waid he writes a fantastic comic and a fantastic critique of the current conflict-for-conflict's-sake trend of comic books.  Wildstorm/Image's The Absolute Authority vol.1. So close to Watchmen, so far from DC/Marvel and viceversa, and so good. Warren Ellis and Bryan Hitch show us what an actual superhero team could do (a bold move that got into Big Two's stories about 5-10 years later), if they really wanted to change the world for good. My opinion is severely biased, since I believe Watchmen to be the absolute best superhero story ever, and this one a different-flavored-but-close second. The Absolute Authority vol.2 is also a very good comic book with the same tone.  EDIT: Still searching.... Reviewing my archive to improve suggestions. BRB."

xmen,32zplc,lowmodality,4,Sat Apr 18 16:28:11 2015 UTC,"I apologise for seeming rude, that wasn't my intention. It's just the writers of DoFP had assumed that people had seen the post-credits scene of TLS, which was present to imply Xavier had survived past what was then considered to be the end of the franchise, to bring Xavier back in Days of Future Past without explaining it outside of The Wolverine's post credits scene.  And I suppose that's one of the things left to the audience's imagination (like the return of Logan's adamantium claws), but if you want a rational explanation the comatose guy had been in the hospital bed for so long he lacked the ability to walk, so when Xavier's consciousness was transferred into it, he couldn't walk as well so he needed a wheelchair."
xmen,32zplc,NotQuiteAManOfSteel,0,Sat Apr 18 16:40:10 2015 UTC,"considering how much of a coincidence that Xavier has a brother who looks exactly like him and was also paralysed, I would have though that a nice reveal could have occurred during the Young and Old Xavier mental meet up scene. In this scene young Xavier could have sensed that Xavier was not truly himself, and his future self could have revealed he transferred himself to a new body during X3. We could perhaps see that his appearance is merely an illusion to make others feel comfortable around him. He could also reveal that he may have ironically have had his back broken again during a previous fight with the sentinels. Maybe this flash of the future could have shown the death of another character like Beast, just to really hit home how devastating this future is. They could have shown this with flashes of image as young Xavier is shown glimpses of the future, rather than simple dialogue. It would have been simple, filled in a potential plot hole and added some layers to events leading up to and during the war in the future."

xmen,32vze4,VaudevilleDada,2,Fri Apr 17 13:06:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's underrated (as is Carey's run in general, really). SPOILERS I think it suffers for being yet another ""alternate reality"" (well, kind of), plus the set-up and the title create an immediate comparison to the Age of Apocalypse, which is already setting up the reader with expectations. Having said that, though, I think it's structurally pretty sound and full of interesting bits--I love the repetitive dog tags!--not to mention it does wonders for under-served characters like Frenzy (where's she been, anyway?) and Legion (whom I would have preferred remained dead, anyway, but Age of X was a nice spotlight for him)."

xmen,32tvai,tec2030,3,Thu Apr 16 18:08:59 2015 UTC,"here are my favorite story arcs, in chronological order, slightly revised to fit the imagined tastes of a teenage boy:   Dark Phoenix Saga (Uncanny 129-137) -- because they have to know the real deal with Phoenix Days of Future Past (Uncanny 141-142) -- because you gotta read the original God Loves, Man Kills (graphic novel) -- possibly the best place for a newcomer to start Wolverine (Claremont/Miller limited series 1-4) -- the first Wolverine comics, must-read From the Ashes (Uncanny 168-176) -- one of Joss Whedon's favorite runs; Wolverine's wedding; Rogue joins the X-Men; Storm gets a mohawk Havok & Wolverine: Meltdown (limited series 1-4) -- highly recommended, great artwork Inferno -- because Goblin Queen underboob Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men run 1-24 (the Warren Ellis run after this is also good). The Whedon run also has an amazing motion comic partially available on Netflix, DVDs on Amazon. Remender's Uncanny X-Force"
xmen,32tvai,xooxanthellae,6,Fri Apr 17 04:19:00 2015 UTC,"Whedon's Astonishing X-Men would be a great run, it's pretty contemporary and familiar even if all you know are the movies."

This is what got me into them: Ultimate X-Men was the best to start out with, no longer confusing histories for the characters. After that I got into the Essentials because they were cheap and I wanted to get to know the lore. Whedon's run on Astonishing X-Men was a great entry to the more modern storylines.  Non X-Men comics I would recommend for teens are Runaways and Young Avengers. Hope that helps!"
xmen,32tvai,pinkymoon,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:54:06 2015 UTC,"Whedon's Astonishing X-Men, solid story line and most of the favorite characters looking badass.  Grant Morrison's New X-Men run too, when I was that age that was a cool book to read."

Both of those series are perfect for teens and they can be found in big volumes. Plus they deal with some mutant stuff still so its not straying from X-Men too much."

Most of Marvel's books are still building up to it.  The Old Man Logan Universe comes in because the Battleworld of  the new Secret Wars will be a- AHEM convergence of multiple Marvel Universes. The Old Man Logan Universe will be one of those. So The tie-in series will show what's going on in that universe/part of battleworld, but I'm sure the characters will pop up in a few other books as well."

Comics Psylocke has a pretty convoluted backstory with what sort of read as dubious racial overtones. (I know that different people feel differently about the cross-racial body swap thing, but at a minimum I don't think ""become a ninja by becoming Asian"" is the kind of thing most people would write today.)  I wouldn't blame them for just making Psylocke a (possibly part-Asian, ethnically) British woman with psionic powers and martial arts skills, rather than a British woman who got swapped into a Japanese woman's body under fairly confusing circumstances.   I don't know if the character's role will be large enough that they'll bother going into it at all, but if there's one X-Men character whose story I think it's reasonable to rework for the sake of an adaptation, it's probably Psylocke."

They more or less just showed up once Logan moved back out to Westchester and they hung out the entire time. Then when we got to Amazing X-Men and the return of Nightcrawler their presence was explained then."

They first showed up in continuity in Nightcrawler's 1985 series, where a dimension-hopping Nightcrawler discovered an Earth identical to the one described in Kitty's Fairy Tale. They made at least one more appearance in Excalibur #118-119 when they were henchmen of Nightmare, similar to how Azazel used them in Amazing X-Men.

Basically they had to work backwards on the script because they had to deconstruct everything. The others of First Class became disposable because they knew after that everyone else would be fair game again so it became a plot point/motivation for Magneto and Mystiques characters.
xmen,32f1mu,GoldandBlue,1 point,Mon Apr 13 08:12:42 2015 UTC,"Still, removing Emma Frost from the film series after only one movie seems like an incredible waste of her amazing character.

xmen,32f1mu,EmperorVoldemort,2,Mon Apr 13 20:34:19 2015 UTC,"This is a franchise that has turned Emma, Storm, Kitty, and Rogue into mice. I know that movies and comics are different and all things aside the X-Men franchise is pretty good but at a time when women are desperate for strong female roles in movies, it is disappointing to see what Fox has done to some of the best female characters in all of comics. That's Hollywood for you."

Sure she wasnt much in DofP but that was also due to Halles pregnancy.  Ellen Page was great as Kitty in Last Stand and DofP. Not a fan of Paquins Rogue though. she was hardly recognizable as the character and was more like teenage Kitty 2.0 or something."

Post credit scene shows that guy waking up speaking in Xavier's voice.  Comic book explanation would be that his mind was still alive on the astral plane and that guy's head was empty. Nature abhors a vacuum so he probably got sucked into that dudes head.

xmen,32a69f,Supersecretsword,3,Sun Apr 12 01:17:58 2015 UTC,"This is a really strange thing to see pop up every so often on this subreddit. People are so baffled by it, and most of the answers are something along the lines of 'Fox doesn't care' or 'inconsistent writing. But really, let's take a look:  http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/18/the-many-deaths-of-professor-x  The link describes a few major events that happen and then un-happen, and that's just Professor X. He's hardly the only character to die and return for some various excuse. Love it or hate it, you're probably still reading the comics. But when this idea translates to the movies, a place where death tends to be relatively permanent (usually?), people are at a loss for how it's possible, or act like Fox is making up the whole 'death and return' idea. If anything, it's one of the most accurate things to happen to the comics. That and the terribly inconsistent timeline that EVERYONE complains about the movies are SO SO SO X-MEN. X-men travel to the past, from the future, change all kinds of shit, swap dimensions, fight their future selves, it's all nonsense. That's part of the fun. Does it really all add up when you do the math? God no, not even close. It's all written by dozens of different people who are not by any means cooperating, they're all just trying to tell their own stories without disrupting the previous ones too much.   So why do we get all up in arms about every little discrepancy in the movies? Xavier having a twin brother that he transferred his consciousness into after dying (or right before dying) is VERY X-MEN. That really sounds like some stupid shit they would do. The fact that they mention the comatose man in the beginning of X3 means that it is not inconsistent writing or laziness. They planned it from the start. Why does he still look like himself? Legally, the actor probably has a contract. Story-wise? Maybe the comatose man was his twin brother. Maybe a mutant changed his appearance. Maybe Xavier, being the most powerful psychic in the world, is capable of making everyone see what they want to see. He froze an entire building of people in place. He wipes minds. He transferred his consciousness from one body to another! It is very, very believable that he DOESN'T look like his old self, and that everyone just SEES him as his old self. But because it isn't explicitly stated and hand fed to the viewer, we scream 'Fox just doesn't care, they just throw in whatever garbage they want!'.   It's really silly, guys."
xmen,32a69f,Outsider17,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:43:21 2015 UTC,I really like the effort you put into this. Just one question about the whole conscious transfer thing: Why is he still paralyzed in the new body?

Pre-inferno X-factor stories are ok, but nothing amazing (imo), and there isn't a lot of intersection for several years.  Even in the early cross-overs, each X-group kind of has its own story."

xmen,327dc2,jedispyder,2,Sat Apr 11 12:08:06 2015 UTC,I've read pretty much every x-comic up until 2001 so far and I read all of them alongside each other. It has its pros and con's. You could read them separately until inferno because thats when they finally meet and then start interacting more often. Otherwise you'd probably be reading those parts twice I guess.

Also after the fall of the mutants Cyke and Jean go on a hunt for Scotts son that deals with the aftermath of what happened to the X-Men in dallas during the fall of the mutants that leads right up to inferno and a run in the with the x-men.  So I would read them all side by side, to get the subltle ebb and flow between the titles.   The Judgement war you can just plow throughit was just a way to get X-factor off earth to miss The Acts of Vengance company wide crossover.  After X-tingtion agenda the teams are pretty much all back together and Scott and Jean are helping advise Storm and Cable on how to unify the teams."

xmen,326n4m,ta1976,7,Sat Apr 11 00:58:52 2015 UTC,Basicly Beast thought it was a good idea to go back in time and bring back the original x-men (namely cyclops) in the hopes it they could remind old cyclops of how he used to be and help him realize the error of his ways. Once they came to the future the didn't want to leave.

Hank felt betrayed by Scott on a very personal level, and more than anything else I think he wanted present Scott to see how great he used to be and be ashamed.

xmen,326n4m,Thunderstarter,3,Tue Apr 14 01:10:04 2015 UTC,"Basically after Charles Xavier dies Wolverine and Cyclops have a disagreement that turns into a full blown schism in the appropriately named X-Men: Schism event, Cyclops goes off on his own team while Wolverine starts the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Eventually Cyclops' team snowballs into a full blown mutant rebellion and Beast, who has sided with Wolverine to make sure the school gets it's shit sorted out decides to bring the original X-Men into the present in the hope that the younger versions of themselves will remind Cyclops of Xavier's dream and what he should be fighting for.   These X-Men just piss him off even more which Beast probably could have seen coming but hey he's going through some shit so cut him a little slack and when they see how disastrous their future is decide that they want to stay here rather than go back and be mind-wiped by Xavier so that they'd end up as the fucked up versions of themselves they've seen.    Most people were okay with them staying (In fact in Battle Of The Atom it was revealed their presence there had messed up the timeline so much they couldn't go back) but it's becoming clear it's going to have some pretty serious consequences that may or may not be addressed in the upcoming Secret Wars event.

xmen,320anl,whiskeybill,2,Thu Apr 9 20:17:13 2015 UTC,So is he not Warren? Or is he still somehow the other Ben's Angel?

xmen,320anl,whiskeybill,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:51:12 2015 UTC,"He's probably Warren.  It helps if you just ignore all the contradictions in the X-Men movie universe at this point, they are beyond redemption."
xmen,320anl,whiskeybill,2,Thu Apr 9 19:35:54 2015 UTC,thats what DofP was for - to clean up the franchise and take care of the contradictions. This is the same Angel as the one from X3 - just played by a different actor and now part of a different timeline (as X1-3 no longer exist)
xmen,320anl,whiskeybill,4,Thu Apr 9 22:49:58 2015 UTC,"Yea I get that, but the ages still don't work.  This movie is set in the 80's so Angel should be a baby if you are going by his age in X3.  Just because it is a new timeline doesn't mean their ages are any different, just look at the end of DoFP when they brought Cyclops and Jean Grey back.  Even with the whitewashing they gave the franchise in DoFP the continuity is still messed up, but who cares.  I'd much rather they put archangel in with apocalypse than try to respect a broken continuity."
xmen,320anl,Dig-Up-The-Dead,6,Thu Apr 9 23:38:11 2015 UTC,maybe in the new timeline Warren was simply born 20 years earlier than in the old timeline. changing the timeline has a ripple effect across time and space. Geoff Johns explained this very well in his Flash: Rebirth comic book.   I dont know whats your problem with Scott and Jeans appearance in DofP though. That was perfect.
xmen,320anl,sbooyah,2,Fri Apr 10 00:51:58 2015 UTC,I don't have any problem with Scott and Jean being in the new timeline.  I was using them as an example of how their ages stayed the same the same way I assume Warren's age would stay the same.
xmen,320anl,deadsy18,2,Fri Apr 10 01:55:54 2015 UTC,Like I said I think its possible that due to the timeline changes some characters were more heavily affacted then others and might have been born sooner (or later) then in the original timeline.
xmen,320anl,DarkGrey82,2,Fri Apr 10 09:56:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe, uh...hmm...maybe Warren Worthington II and his gal had their kid earlier because of the changing past. I'm gonna go with that. It comforts me."

xmen,31uxoy,geekgentleman,3,Wed Apr 8 10:33:43 2015 UTC,Why do people think that comic book sales affect movie sales.  How many Guardians of the Galaxy comic books were sold before the movie was announced?  If they did not reboot the series would it still have been a huge hit...? yes.  Movies drive comic book sales.  No 90s kid is going to care at all about what the X-men are doing in the comics when the new movie comes out.  No one is going in expecting an answer to how the OG xmen get back to their own time.  Fox has 50+ years of comic books to draw inspiration on and can make up whatever they want to.  Marvel stopping X-men books only hurts Marvel.  Disney is not this stupid.
xmen,31uxoy,bigwillistyle,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:16:01 2015 UTC,"If this is true it will be interesting to see how far the X-Men have fallen after Secret Wars.  It seems like they are really going to shake up the status quo after that event and if they really wanted to bury the X-Men that would be the time to do it.  Oh well, its not like they could do a worse job handling the X-Men than they did after AvX."
xmen,31uxoy,whiskeybill,3,Thu Apr 9 20:21:06 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping that secret wars will bring the x-men back to status quo. Wolverine resurrected, one team in westchester, time displaced mutants no longer displaced, caviar back as head master etc. one can only hope."

If Disney can manage to get Fox to relinquish the film rights to the X-Men, and get it back into their extremely competent hands, then go for it. First Class and DoFP may have had huge improvement jumps compared to the first three films, but they absolutely pale in comparison to what's being accomplished in the MCU. They should do everything in their power to make a Wolverine vs. Hulk film event happen."
xmen,31uxoy,SMB73,3,Wed Apr 8 19:28:43 2015 UTC,"Competition is a good thing.  It serves to make both franchises work harder, try different ideas and concepts.  Putting everything under one banner, would be a bad idea, on a lot of fronts."

xmen,31uxoy,SMB73,5,Thu Apr 9 11:59:52 2015 UTC,"Fox's X-Men takes a lot of flak. We wouldn't have the MCU without Singer's X-Men. Period.   Granted the franchise got derailed, but don't think Marvel didn't learn a tremendous amount from Fox's mistakes. I wouldn't want to see mutants in the MCU for the same reason I don't like them in 616. There is such a divide between regular superheroes and mutants. Merging them just dilutes both.  Now that the slate is clean, I'm excited to see what Fox will show us they've learned in turn from the MCU."

xmen,31uxoy,SMB73,3,Thu Apr 9 20:21:03 2015 UTC,Well like it says in the article the Movies are the driving factor in this as the comics are really just a drop in the bucket as far as revenue.  So until the X-Men movies start losing money Fox isn't going to give them up and DoFP made $750 million so I don't see it happening anytime soon.  If you cancel X-Men comics completely would you really put that much of a dent in those movies audience?

While We're on the subject of Nightcralwer, how about the Draco when it is revealed he is the son of the Devil who is really a mutant. You had mutant hooker and Northstar running around trying to fuck everyone. You had a dozen mutant crucified for shock value including Skin. Then have Jubliee and Paige debate whether Skin was fuckable or not while standing on his grave. Archangel suddenly had a healing blood that he kept slathering onto wounded people.

She-Hulk sleeping with Juggernaut lead to years of retcons.  Havok heals iceform decapitated Bobby by literally peeing him enough water to form the rest of his body. Xorn showed up to be super evil two weeks before the reveal in Morrison's run. Then later in his run Austen fucks up and reignited the Xorneto retcon crisis. China's state superhero mutant was revealed to be multiplication man, because China has a lot of people right?   Do We want to even talk about the the super obvious Romeo and Juliet references for She Lies with the Angels? I mean seriously Mutant hillybillies fighting against anti-mutant rednecks should be more entertaining premise. Instead We got the closing scene with Warren fucking Paige Guthrie in mid-air in front of her mother.   Read the run only twice, once when it came out and again a few years ago just to check if it was bad as I remember... it was..."
xmen,31sb24,systemstheorist,2,Tue Apr 7 21:27:03 2015 UTC,Wow crazy.  I kinda feel like I need to read it to see how bad it is for myself.  Does Austen's run immediately follow Casey's?
xmen,31sb24,YouAreSignedIn,3,Tue Apr 7 23:35:10 2015 UTC,"The issue with that run is that it's more then shitty, X-men have had shitty runs before, look at the tail end of the Lobdell Run, but the issue with the Austin run was that he is probably a really good writer, and some of the writing was really well made, it just utterly failed in every way shape and form.  A bad writer is a bad writer, but someone with the potential to be better delivering something terrible is much worse."

xmen,31me2g,_adidias11_,3,Mon Apr 6 14:58:26 2015 UTC,Well the mutants we see tend have training or engage in combat. Thus they are fit.  Healthier? Well we don't exactly get to see issues where a non X-men deals with a cold. So again we are looking at the trained folks.  Beautiful? Well even average looking people are draw pretty nice. They just don't go into the detail that sets people apart. Somehow Jean Grey turns all the mens heads but Kitty doesn't(well she but not in the same way). The drawings of their faces and bodies aren't vastly different.   Once again they are fit due to the training and many people would be more attractive if they were fit.
xmen,31me2g,iaro,2,Mon Apr 6 21:40:25 2015 UTC,It makes sense since they are evolutionary better than humans -  more fit for survival.
xmen,31me2g,dr_spider,2,Mon Apr 6 14:50:16 2015 UTC,It seems they don't age as fast either.
xmen,31me2g,dr_spider,3,Mon Apr 6 20:07:35 2015 UTC,"True, but remember that this is also a byproduct or Marvel's 'sliding retcon' method of resolving timeline problems, like how Captain America still occasionally acts clueless and out-of-the-loop (no matter what year it is or what has occurred in the past, Cap was only thawed out a few years ago) or how the Punisher is a Viet Nam vet in his early-forties, or how Stark built his first suit in a Korean POW camp, etc. Everyone gets their timelines smushed retroactively."
xmen,31me2g,captainpostal,2,Mon Apr 6 23:38:12 2015 UTC,"Even noncombatant, sedentary mutant characters sport eight-pack abs and 3% body fat, unless their mutation specifically dictates otherwise. Hell, even adolescent mutants are shredded. Obviously, this is due to the talent of the artists and the demands of the readers, but it means that yes, mutants are in overall better physical condition than is normal.  Furthermore, we see too many instances of characters making miraculous recoveries from catastrophic injuries and casually writing it off as a byproduct of some kind of healing factor or accelerated metabolism that was heretofore unmentioned. Throw that together with the simple fact that constant, never-ending hand-to-hand combat would leave the average person permanently disabled within a matter of a few short months, and you can safely say that mutants are also naturally more resilient across the board.   Hell, how many times have we seen a character dramatically fling themselves from a moving vehicle or even a flying aircraft? How many times do we see a character with supposedly no healing factor get thrown through a wall, or fall off the roof, or get shot with a laser, or get punched by a giant robot? The average person who did that even once would be looking at knee replacements, daily pain medication, back injuries, torn muscles, etc. even if they were in amazing shape. Even if it were never explicitly-stated, mutants are all way tougher than humans."
xmen,31me2g,slicwilli,2,Mon Apr 6 23:30:49 2015 UTC,They had a MARVEL based TSR game (people who make Dungeons & Dragons) and mutant characters always get bumped up one level for Endurance because they have naturally more health and stamina.  I remember Dazzler loading all her band's equipment into the van by herself and her being thankful that she was naturally stronger as a mutant.  Basically it explains how mutants can take punches from people with super strength and not die all the time.

As an aside, X-man is really powerful and in many ways similar to Cable except that Cable is hampered by the techno-organic virus that Apocalypse infected him with; Cable has to fight against this disease 24/7 using his powers which reduces the power at his command (while Nate Grey doesn't have this limitation)...... Also Nate and Nathan (X-man and Cable) have a another brother/half brother/clone/weird relationship with Stryfe (an evil, very powerful, techno-organic virus free) who is a clone of Cable... Who is a child of Scott Summers and a clone.......   Also, X-man is from a different universe than 616 and Madelyne Pryor (sp? BTW) was also created by Mr Sinister. Pryor later went on to be the evil Goblin Queen (and she was pretty powerful being a clone of Jean Grey).   I can definitely see why Marvel is soft rebooting their universe even though I freaking love the whole Marvel universe."

xmen,31ajjc,ZacPensol,2,Sat Apr 4 18:10:33 2015 UTC,"From what I recall back before the film was released -   1) Kitty gets stabbed by Wolverine 2) She's dying 3) They need someone to either heal Kitty or to take over Kitty's power (I'm rusty on that) 4) Plan is rescue Rogue. I guess Kitty dies in that then?  From what I remember - there should be scenes that are to do with rescuing Rogue from the Sentinels - Magneto goes to do it - and there's got to be some scenes with her back in the hold-out with Wolverine.   I would also imagine that if she's taking over instead of saving Kitty that there's a Kitty dies/Rogue goes into Wolverine's mind thing, which would give us a nice Wolverine/Rogue scene.    I personally really wanted more of a 'Wolverine back in the Mansion' scene at the end.  I'm probably in the minority - but I'd love a new old X-men as well as a young X-men film.  I thought that the casting was great, except for maybe Cyclops."
xmen,31ajjc,fulfilledprophesy,1 point,Sun Apr 5 19:31:52 2015 UTC,"Wow, I don't know if I read that thing about her replacing Kitty and forgot it, but I totally had that idea watching the movie.  Awesome!  Either way, I didn't know about them going to rescue Rogue - that's pretty awesome.  Having her rescued BY Magneto (given their history) is a neat thing, and seeing more of the original cast is certainly welcome.  Personally, I think DoFP should've just ended the current X-Men movie franchise and start anew ala Spider-Man and Fantastic Four.  I love the old cast, the new movies have been great, but even with DoFP the timeline is so screwed up.  Hugh Jackman keeps saying he won't be Wolverine for much longer... I just think DoFP would've been a really nice movie to close the book on."
xmen,31ajjc,ZacPensol,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:02:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it should have been in there, they said it was too complicated for the uninitiated, but I think they would have gotten it.  Plus it would have really rounded off the X-men original universe for me, we know who's dead, who's where, who's fighting.    Fuuuuuck no.  I hate them keep rebooting shit with a 'fresh new young cast' as though as soon as any of the cast hit 35, they're worthless.  I want to see relationships. Time passing, true development!   Let's see where Apocalypse goes though, that's supposed to be the last."
xmen,31ajjc,fulfilledprophesy,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:29:46 2015 UTC,"I agree about being sick of the reboots, I just feel like more than any line X-Men needs it the most since it was the first to kick off the superhero movie trend and I don't think they anticipated what they were getting into (plus, if anyone has earned a reboot, it's X-Men - 15 years of continuity is very respectable!).  DoFP would've been a good bookend for that is all I'm saying, since it gave the original cast one final hoorah.  Most of the original cast don't want to return, Hugh Jackman's interest is fading (he's said ""just one more time"" how many times now?), so it's going to happen, and I'd rather them just start anew with a new take rather than trying to recast people to play the same interpretation of the same character, you know?  Like, we've had Hugh's Wolverine - do we want to retire Wolverine or have someone else play Hugh's Wolverine, or do we just want a new Wolverine altogether that's someone else's interpretation?  I'm very excited about 'Apocalypse', I'm sure it'll be great, I just figure since so much of the cast is new anyway (young Jean, Scott, Nightcrawler, etc), it may've been better to just set it in 2015 so they don't gotta keep making everything a period piece, they wouldn't be stifled by previous movie continuity, etc etc etc.  They could just start anew knowing what they're getting into, as opposed to in 2000 when they started this thing having no idea they'd still be making the movies 15 years later!"
xmen,31ajjc,ZacPensol,0,Sun Apr 5 21:03:18 2015 UTC,"I really like that though - to me, it was really starting to feel like it had tenure!

Yeah, it's a shame to go younger, but it'll be interesting and new.   I mean, ultimately, we're all holding out for an Avengers vs X-Men, aren't we? aren't we?"

I, too, love Hugh as Wolverine - I have a hard time picturing anyone else ever playing the part buuuut unfortunately, it's going to have to happen eventually.    To paraphrase another superhero movie, ""You either die the hero or live long enough to become the villain"", and I guess I apply that to the X-Men movies: I would rather them choose to go out with us getting a happy ending revisiting the original cast, showing everyone alive and well and happy and played by their original actor, than there come a day where they're still keeping the same universe but they've got someone else playing Wolverine.  In my mind, a reboot would preserve the integrity of the original series and allow for different teams to be assembled at the same time (keep in mind that in the current universe, for example, Gambit is something like 20 years older than Rogue).  It would also allow more possibility for an Avengers vs X-Men potentiality because right now the X-Men movies are always going to have to be period pieces."
xmen,31ajjc,ZacPensol,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:41:32 2015 UTC,"Essentially for me, the three people I'm sold to are, MF as Magneto, CX whose real name escapes me and HJ as Wolverine.

That's it."
xmen,31ajjc,fulfilledprophesy,2,Tue Apr 7 01:49:25 2015 UTC,"Now that I definitely agree with you on - Fassbender just knocks it out of the park as Erik.  McAvoy is doing a good job, though I've had a hard time seeing him as Professor X though, since he has hair and walks around, you know?  He's doing a great job though and his and Fassbender's chemistry really is wonderful - as close to Stewart and McKellen's as anyone could hope to get, you know?

I lucked out and got store credit from my LCS for all 12 issues.  If you like Anole and Rockslide, read Kyle & Yost's New X-Men or Yost's Amazing X-Men.  If you like Blindfold, read Si Spurrier's X-Men:Legacy.  If you like Wolf Cub for some reason, I'm sorry.  The rest of those series are solid, though, especially earlier Gen X!"

Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men run 1-24 (the Warren Ellis run after this is also good). The Whedon run also has an amazing motion comic partially available on Netflix. Remender's Uncanny X-Force (Vol. 1)"

There is so much more before him, and so much more after.  Google ""X-Men reading list"" and multiple versions will pop up. Skim through a few and try to find a jumping on point. It's different for everyone. I started with Joss Wheedon's Astonishing X-Men run, which is pretty amazing. Other people start back near the beginning. There is no right or wrong way to do it. Skim the reading orders by looking at the major events they are cataloging, and jump on where you want. I knew a lot of X-Men storylines, even without having read the comics, so I didn't feel bad about jumping with Astonishing. Everyone's different. Find what works for you.

MU has the overwhelming majority of the entire Marvel back catalog up until 6 months ago. They release new issues every week. This past week the Sept. 24 releases came out, but if you want to start from a beginning, then you don't need to worry about being six months behind the current series.   It's a great service, especially if you plan on reading as many comics as you seem. The web browser is alright, but I think the service really shines on tablets or large phones. I do all of my MU reading on my iPhone 6+. If you have an older device, then make sure that their app is supported."

xmen,315gfh,fisheypixels,2,Thu Apr 2 05:29:49 2015 UTC,"Get Marvel Unlimited (MU).    If you want to start from towards the beginning, start with Chris Claremont's run with Uncanny X-Men #94 or #95 (technically it starts with Giant Size X-Men Vol 1 but I don't think MU has that, at least on my cursory glance).  That's the samE Uncanny X-Men that started in 1963, though #94 is in 1975.  MU has most Uncanny X-Men issues.  It can feel dated, but I think once Claremont gets rolling, it gets good quite quickly.    If you want to start early but find Uncanny #94 just looks/feels too old, try starting at around Uncanny #129 (~1980).  That's where Kitty Pryde shows up and it's right before the Dark Phoenix saga.  If you want to read Apocalypse, read the 1986 X-Factor series, though I'm not sure if MU has that.  The first couple issues of X-Factor aren't that great, but Archangel shows up soon after.  If you want to start here, I'd still recommend reading Uncanny X-Men #129-137.  If you want to start somewhere more modern, Grant Morrison's ""New X-Men Vol. 1 (2001)"" run is a good place to start, starting with New X-Men #114.  It should be in MU.  It leads right into Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men run, so you may want to read it before Whedon's run.  Note that the same Uncanny X-Men run is still going at the same time (Uncanny #394 is about the same time as New X-Men #114, and X-Treme X-Men Vol. 1 starts at roughly the same time).    Also, google X-Men reading orders.  Don't read the original 60's X-Men unless you know what you're getting into.  I also don't recommend starting in the 90's."
xmen,315gfh,Mathieulombardi,1 point,Thu Apr 2 06:00:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about Marvel Unlimited, since I really dislike digital comics.  Other people will know more about that.  But if you're looking for a good place to start, Grant Morrison's New X-Men.  It's from the early 2000's.  The art in teh first third or so of the comic I really don't like.  But it makes up for that in the story and writing.  It remains one of my favorite all time series.  Now the comic directly following that would be Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men.  Which has incredible art all the way through, and it's written by Joss Whedon.  So it's basically a masterpiece.  I consider Joss Whedon to be among the gods of writers.  From there you can decide which series you'd like to follow that are going on.  By the way, there's no way anyone could afford to read all the X-Men comics.  Lastly, your last bit, asking about the website to read it at, please don't.  Sorry if I get too preachy for a minute.  Comics isn't the best industry as you can imagine.  And illegally reading them is not cool at all.  The people in the industry rely on the sales to get money for rent and food and whatnot.  So just keep that in mind.  If you didn't mean illegal websites, sorry for the preachy moment.  Comixology is a great place with tons and tons of comics.  Otherwise try the publisher's website."
xmen,314fah,Sionly,4,Wed Apr 1 22:44:58 2015 UTC,"This is the problem with adaptations, they will never please 100% of fans which is why they do not try. They have to fit 60 years of history into 2 hours of digestible story. Personally I think the only problem with First Class was that it didn't have the First Class. If it had and had a truer Hellfire Club, it would have been even better."
xmen,314fah,GoldandBlue,0,Thu Apr 2 07:08:57 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying. There are so many characters, stories, and events that happened between '63 and now. I just dont under stand why First Class couldnt just focus on the original five X-Men.   What did you not like about the Hellfire Club in the movie? The lack of characters? The Dark Phoenix saga would have been cooler if Mastermind would have tampered with Jean, causing her to go crazy in the movies."
xmen,314fah,GoldandBlue,5,Thu Apr 2 12:48:20 2015 UTC,"Well it didn't focus on the original five because it wanted to keep the continuity of the original films.                                        The Hellfire Club just had that random tornado dude that added nothing plus January Jones was terrible.

xmen,314fah,GoldandBlue,0,Fri Apr 3 18:31:07 2015 UTC,Rosamund Pike would have been wasted in that movie.  January Jones was hot with resting bitch face. Her character was little more than a model and served little by way of plot or characterization. It was Emma Frost in name and power set only.  I enjoy watching these movies but good god they don't do much by way of characters. A good actor working with a good script and a talented director can make a character with three lines of dialogue or five minutes of featured screen time. Sometimes I wonder if Bryan Singer is using these movies to collect new fuckboys (I'm aware he didn't work on FC or either Wolverine)
xmen,314fah,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,0,Mon Apr 6 09:43:46 2015 UTC,Emma did not do much but when she did it wasn't forgettable because of the writing. It was forgettable because January Jones was sleepwalking throughout.

xmen,30yz14,xooxanthellae,3,Wed Apr 1 02:23:27 2015 UTC,She died at the end of Dark Phoenix. Claremont made the editor shake on it that she would stay dead for good. Everything after that is fanfic.
xmen,30yz14,matdabomb,3,Wed Apr 1 04:08:51 2015 UTC,No. They retconned it by saying that Phoenix put the real Jean Grey in a cocoon in the shuttle crash. She was around between the start of X-factor and the New X-Men when Magneto killed her for good.

xmen,30z95x,Mevansuto,3,Wed Apr 1 08:10:10 2015 UTC,The long answer is ultimate X-Men is not just a good place to start it is exactly where you should start. The Ultimate universe started with the three titles ultimate Spiderman Ultimate X-Men and the ultimates.   Almost the entire original ultimate X-Men Run can be read by itself. There are a few little side books along the way like ultimate hulk versus Wolverine and ultimate war that are almost entirely optional with the exception of  ultimatum but that happens at the end of the run if you get that far.   If you enjoy the ultimate X-Men books I would recommend ultimate Spiderman and the ultimates as well as both of their original runs are quite excellent but they are not essential to understand the stories in ultimate X-Men.   You should try to get through the entire Mark Millar run that ended with ultimate X-Men number 33. 34 and onward is quite good as well but the tone changes quite a bit as it starts being written by Brian Michael Bendis.

Pre-Marvel Unlimited and digital, it was pretty impossible to read older, historic issues other than spending a fortunate on any old back issues, any colored collections that were out, or those CD-ROM collections.  While not good quality, Essential books were a really cheap and easy way to read and experience the early issues.

My friend and I are always talking how the mutants don't really make sense in the context of the Marvel universe. If the public can accept Captain America, Thor, Spider-Woman and thousands of other super-powered beings then what is their problem with the X-Men? Because they're born with it? Ok. Suuuuuure.  If it was always like Grant Morrison's X-Men where there's a bunch of grody freaky looking bird and bug people...that would make more sense. But to be honest, I hated reading about those X-Men. Call me shallow.   At any rate, that's why I don't real want the X-Men movies to mix with the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They're fine being separate."

xmen,30q4oe,bubongo,-1,Tue Mar 31 06:50:14 2015 UTC,Since we know this will be Jackman's last Wolverine film it would makes sense if Mangold used elements from The Death Of Wolverine or Old Man Logan comic book storylines.   Is the author really that stupid? They can't use Old Man Logan because there's way too many Marvel characters that are central to the plot that Fox can't use. And they won't kill Wolverine because he's Wolverine! He's a cash cow. There's even less of a chance of that than OML.

I jumped on with Messiah Complex, though this may be a little later than you wanted (includes, amongst a few other X-books, 492-494) but it seemed like a good modern event to start at (I'd previously read House of M)."
xmen,30ozns,SuperRic,1 point,Sun Mar 29 12:42:00 2015 UTC,"Yea, I checked that site out and they recommend #360 or #410.  But I heard #410 was a bad spot as well since the writing sucks (as noted on that site as well).  I figured that Morrison's New X-men was a good jumping on point for the ""X-men"" title but was searching for a similar jumping on point for the uncanny x-men. Since #394 is the issue that parallels the new x-men title, I thought maybe that it may also be a pseudo reboot but from what I am gathering is that this isn't the case. I also notice the cover goes from ""The Uncanny X-men"" to just ""Uncanny X-men"" between 393 and 394, which is also what pushed me to that thought as well."
xmen,30ozns,tec2030,3,Sun Mar 29 22:26:45 2015 UTC,Like I said in the other thread...start at #444.  This still gives you plenty to read.   You DO NOT want to start reading during Chuck Austen run.  It starts at #410 and is generally accepted as one of the worst X-Men runs of all time.

I think Uncanny #94 is the first issue after Giant-Size #1.

Hell Wolverine didn't even appear until 1974. The All New team didn't bow until 1975. Sabretooth didn't show up until 1977 and it took until 1986 for him to 1st battle Wolverine. Rogue didn't debut until 1980 after Jean died for bloody sakes.

Riptide no. should have been Unis, The hellfire club because they can't use Hydra but not Emma or Shaw, should have been Baron Von Strucker or due to rights issues Count Nefaria and make it like in X-men 161."

xmen,30ly3c,whiskeybill,4,Sat Mar 28 17:37:35 2015 UTC,"As much as I want Cable to be in an X-Men film my greatest fear is that it will actually happen.  There is no character development in any of these films outside Wolverine, Magneto, Xavier, Mystique, and to a lesser extent Beast.  The rest exist simply to pop up and give a visual effect of their power and then disappear.  That more than anything is the problem with the continuity of these films.  Sure, you can put Emma Frost in First Class but the timeline is already screwed up because they just had to show a young girl turning into a diamond for like 4 seconds in Wolverine: Origins.  How awesome was Blink in DoFP?  Her powers looked amazing but did she even have a single line of dialog?  Because Singer wanted to show off Blink's powers in the future we can't see her again without it further screwing up the continuity.  I kinda went on a bit of a rant here but the point is this, I would rather have no Cable in AoA unless he is going to actually be a character with an arc and motivations not just a fancy visual effect to put on the screen between Xavier and Magneto arguing about mutant rights for the 50th freaking time."

xmen,30mhcc,motoben,4,Sat Mar 28 20:40:54 2015 UTC,"Jackman has done, especially since he's built more like Cyclops than Wolverine.  He enjoys the role and has done great things with it.  Sometimes though, actors stay in roles longer than they should, especially if the characters are supposed to be immortal or ageless.  If he steps away in the near future, Jackman's Wolverine gets to be a consistent example of how an actor can fill a role.  If he stays until he dies, he ends up playing Old Man Logan or Col. Logan as the modern incarnation.  I don't want to worry if Wolverine's hip is going to give out on him in battle.  No matter what happens, my thanks to Hugh Jackman for his fine work with Wolverine.  I recall hearing the script to X-Men didn't call for him to say ""Bub"" at any point; Jackman ad-libbed the line.  Fine work, sir."

Bendis's run on All-New & Uncanny has been decent but not spectacular; none of the other team books are even worth mentioning. I don't think they'll discontinue X-Men altogether, but I would be surprised if they're anywhere near as prominent as they've been in the past. I have no idea how they're going to resolve the whole time-travel mess; All-New X-Men feels like it's been dragged out for ages now, and there's still not a lot of resolution in sight.  Incidentally, the recent solicit for Uncanny Inhumans made me realize just how similar Black Bolt and Cyclops are. Leaders of their people; outcast; have teleporters; ultra-destructive powers that they must constantly guard against; fond of redheads....  I'm not really interested in getting involved in a new franchise, so I think when Secret Wars starts up I'm going to quit monthly comics and concentrate on building my collections collection. :/"
xmen,30driw,Nellisir,1 point,Thu Mar 26 16:35:14 2015 UTC,I expected them to send the time displaced x-men back to the past months ago but they have just been dragging them along doing nothing forever now.  How much more interesting would that series have been if it followed the time displaced x-men back in the past but with the knowledge they gathered from being in the future?
xmen,30driw,whiskeybill,1 point,Sun Mar 29 01:48:29 2015 UTC,Man I just don't care about the Inhumans at all. Find them boring in everything.
xmen,30driw,bonerjohnson,1 point,Mon Mar 30 05:54:29 2015 UTC,"Never bothered reading about them in 30+ years of reading comics, so can't say they've really perked my interest."
xmen,30driw,Nellisir,3,Mon Mar 30 14:43:22 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about in print or in film?  I can see the MCU focusing larger on the Inhumans in film because of their lack of rights to ""mutants"". I can even see them calling Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch ""Inhumans"" in film to both explain their abilities, and to provide a segway to the new Inhumans film coming out in a few years. But I can't ever see them pulling back on any of the various X-Men publications in print.  The X-Men is one of the longest running and most successful franchises in comic book history. Just because they don't have rights to the movies (yet... I'm optimistic) doesn't mean they're not going to publish Amazing X-Men, Astonishing X-Men or X-Force. They absolutely will never stop publishing Uncanny X-Men, nor will they any of the various Wolverine publications.   I wouldn't worry about it, brother. 👊"
xmen,30driw,GetHaggard,2,Thu Mar 26 16:03:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was specifically thinking of the comics. I hope you're right, as I've really enjoyed the direction things have been going after AvX."
xmen,30driw,GetHaggard,2,Thu Mar 26 16:05:14 2015 UTC,"Nah, I doubt it. We just got Jean Grey back and her new power set is unreal. They would be foolish to throw that away."
xmen,30driw,Laragon,2,Thu Mar 26 16:09:07 2015 UTC,"All-New, Amazing, Cyclops, Storm, Spider-Man and the, Wolverines and Uncanny are all confirmed to be ending after Secret Wars. I'm sure there will be a relaunch, but how many remains to be seen."
xmen,30driw,fgggr,5,Thu Mar 26 22:32:02 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing on various sites that Marvel is hoping to shift the X-Men from a major property to a minor one, with a greater focus being placed on the Inhumans. This is supposedly due to them lacking the movie rights.    It's the dumbest conspiracy theory out there that some fans keep perpetuating.  Why would Marvel choose to lose millions of dollars in revenue from one of their biggest franchises in some impossible attempt to get the movie rights back from Fox?    Fox isn't going to give them up.    The X-Men movies will still be hugely successful even without X-Men comics.    If anything, Marvel is grateful that the hype from an upcoming movie might shift a few more comics."
xmen,30driw,whiskeybill,2,Thu Mar 26 22:31:24 2015 UTC,The worst part is how do you even stay interested in what they are doing now when everything is going to come undone in secret wars.

xmen,30dmgk,deltora,10,Thu Mar 26 15:00:37 2015 UTC,"While I am aware that Chloe Bennet is half-Chinese, she is much more white-passing than Lana Condor, and I think that there's enough white-washing in the media as it is. Lana Condor was probably a good choice."
xmen,30dmgk,dacalpha,-3,Thu Mar 26 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"but jubilee has never really looked fullblown chinese to me, like here, i would also say kristin kreuk would be a good choice if you want someon emore ethnic looking, but i don't think casting should be done on ethnicity alone, skill should be a factor to and this girl has never acted before in her life. i'd rather characters be played well than just 'look the part'"
xmen,30dmgk,tony1grendel,9,Thu Mar 26 16:37:03 2015 UTC,I honestly never realized Jubilee was Asian when watching 90's X-Men  TAS
xmen,30dmgk,TheBlackSpank,2,Thu Mar 26 17:26:57 2015 UTC,exactly! what you remember is her fun punkish attitude right? i'm just worried a first time actress won't be able to pull of the attitude as well as a seasoned one
xmen,30dmgk,redgears,0,Thu Mar 26 17:48:26 2015 UTC,Does it really matter if she still has her fun punkish attitude?
xmen,30dmgk,GospelX,0,Sat Mar 28 04:40:31 2015 UTC,"just so i don't misunderstand your question, are you asking   A: does it really matter if its a first time actor as long as she still has her punkish attitude?  or  B: does it matter if she is portrayed with a punkish attitude in this movie?"
xmen,30dmgk,GospelX,2,Sat Mar 28 04:48:20 2015 UTC,What does ethnic mean?
xmen,30dmgk,redgears,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:13:48 2015 UTC,"oh, it's short for ethnicity, i guess it means you look ethnic when it's easy to tell where you are from, both of these men are from south africa 1 and 2. 2 looks more ethnic than one.   i think that's the best way i can say it, does that help?"
xmen,30dmgk,redgears,0,Fri Mar 27 03:39:58 2015 UTC,"Generally, the phrase ""ethnic looking"" is frowned upon. It's not as frowned upon as saying, ""oriental looking,"" but it's still considered a bit of a faux pas."
xmen,30dmgk,neurogloop,0,Fri Mar 27 14:29:31 2015 UTC,Is there something else I can say that can communicate my meaning in a less offensive way?
xmen,30dmgk,redgears,1 point,Fri Mar 27 14:39:27 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't think there was a less offensive way to put what you were saying. It's a tricky subject to broach when it comes to who looks more like they are from a shared background."
xmen,30dmgk,neurogloop,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:29:34 2015 UTC,"i'm honestly not trying to be racist at all or put anybody down, my basic point is just that (this is probably where i sound predigest i guess) is that Jubilee just never looked that Chinese to me so, in my opinion casting a Chinese american would make more sense in that case."
xmen,30dmgk,TheBlackSpank,0,Fri Mar 27 17:09:28 2015 UTC,"It really seems like your meaning is ""They look like what I think people from there look like."" Especially with the two examples you gave, where it seems like what you really mean is dark-skinned."
xmen,30dmgk,vagabondhermit,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:13:26 2015 UTC,"It really seems like your meaning is ""They look like what I think people from there look like.""   thats close to what i mean, if you remove the ""what i think"".  and i don't mean dark skinned at all, you missed my point if you really think that's what i meant, so here's a light skinned example for you too, this girl looks more ethnically Finnish than this girl both are finnish, one simply has a stronger Finnish look.  this Hispanic girl is more ethnic than this hispanic girl   i'm not saying anyone is better or worse than anyone else, i'm not saying light skinned people are better than dark, not at all.  my main point, is that to me Jubilee never had a strong chinese look to her so picking an actress with one seems odd when there are other actresses that are more experienced and would fit the part better, in my opinion. is that an unpopular opinion? i guess so"

xmen,30dmgk,trollburgers,2,Fri Mar 27 17:02:41 2015 UTC,"So I totally get that you're not trying to be racist or anything, but what you're saying is ""I have an idea what people from this place should look like."" and that's what you mean when you say ethnic. You could say, I never realized Jubilee was meant to be Chinese. You could say ""Jubilee wasn't really drawn to look very Chinese on the TV show."" But when you say ""This person is more Chinese looking than this other person"", you're not stating a fact, because there's a lot of variation in what people look like.   For example, does this celebrity look more South African than this celebrity. Because she is. And he's from Philadelphia. So despite him looking ""more South African ethnic"", he isn't.   Honestly, I'm just annoyed when people use the word Ethnic to mean ""Less white"", which is basically what you did here:   but jubilee has never really looked fullblown chinese to me, like here, i would also say kristin kreuk would be a good choice if you want someon emore ethnic looking..."
xmen,30dmgk,trollburgers,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:39:14 2015 UTC,"okay, i can say that ethnic does not have the definition i was using it for, that's my mistake.  but i still don't know how you think i'm saying ""less white"", one of my examples was Finnish for christ's sake.  when you say 'less white' you are acting like white is the default and i do not believe that. white's are also an ethnicity, weather they are german, american, polish or Canadian.  i've seen people get called racist because they can't tell Chinese people and Japanese people apart, but now i'm offensive because i'm saying there are in fact distinctions? that i can tell that my friend is Mongolian not just 'asain' by sight? i just don't know how to win.  and i did know Jubilee was Chinese, but her features were more  muted than let's say lady deathstrike or sunfire, she was like Nico Minoru from the runaways series, depicted with more subtlety as far as race goes."
xmen,30dmgk,doritosalsa,1 point,Sat Mar 28 03:19:26 2015 UTC,Doesn't South Africa have a significant white population? I'd probably answer Charlize if you asked me that question to be honest
xmen,30dmgk,thermac,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:09:03 2015 UTC,"There are loads of white South Africans, bad example unless you're talking about precolonisation which I think would be a bit redundant and irrelevant anyways. Like take an indigenous islander from Jamaica (most of whom have been wiped out during the 18th century) is he more Jamaican than a black Jamaican who's ancestors were likely brought there during the slave trade?  I think you're moving into dangerous territory with your nitpicking.  Also, I don't see how what OP is saying is offensive at all. White people can be ethnic too, it's just a term of categorisation.   Edit: I am ""ethnic"" by your definition, in that I'm a Middle Eastern person living in a predominantly white country. There are only a few ways using the word ethic could be perceived as insulting. It's not a slur."
xmen,30dmgk,thermac,0,Tue Apr 28 08:04:30 2015 UTC,"okay i'll put it a different way, Jubilee herself always seemed more white-passing to me, i mean, she wasn't like lady deathstrike or sunfire, she was more like Nico Minoru from the runaways series, she was depicted with more subtlety , it wasn't in your face that she was asian, someone even replied to me saying they had never noticed jubilee even was chinese!"
xmen,30dmgk,classicsonicfan,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:57:26 2015 UTC,"What does ""In your face Asian"" mean? Would there have had to be a very special issue of X-Men about Chinese new year?"
xmen,30dmgk,Civil718,2,Fri Mar 27 20:40:34 2015 UTC,"I think what OP is saying is Jubilee looks more ethnically ambiguous than Lady Deathstrike. I don't understand when people try and draw racist conclusions from as little offensive material as possible, let's just talk about the damn character. I for one would have liked to see a Chinese actress play Jubilee, but that's just me."

xmen,30a7mp,slicwilli,8,Wed Mar 25 19:39:51 2015 UTC,Finally. Jubilee.
xmen,30a7mp,rdldr1,9,Thu Mar 26 03:54:44 2015 UTC,"She was actually in all three of the original trilogy. If you blinked you missed her, but she was there."
xmen,30a7mp,slicwilli,3,Thu Mar 26 04:01:54 2015 UTC,"That didnt really count. These were just cameos. But I am curious how they will address this in Apocalypse. If Jubilee was a teenager by the time of the original trilogy, she would be like 3 years old at the time that Apocalypse takes place. That makes no sense. I know that DoFP has erased X1-3 from existence but the characters would still be the same age as in the previous timeline."
xmen,30a7mp,slicwilli,1 point,Thu Mar 26 04:51:10 2015 UTC,"I think we'll just have to accept it as unexplained. Kind of like how there have been two different Emma Frosts, two Trasks, and two Moira Mctaggerts. Among other continuity errors.   I thought they said they weren't gonna do that anymore, but well, here we are."
xmen,30a7mp,AndrewEpidemic,2,Thu Mar 26 12:58:34 2015 UTC,"The ""Emma"" in Origins wasnt Emma Frost. or at least they retconned her not to be with First Class. Thats how I see it. Trask in X3 could have been a descendant of Bolivar in DOFP. I got nothing for Moira though xD maybe she was Moira McTaggert II. or something :P  But they are not really doing continuity errors again since X1-3 have been erased from history with DOFP. So if Jubilee is in Apocalypse it doesnt really clash with the original trilogy cause in this new timeline the original films never happened."
xmen,30a7mp,Darkside_Hero,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:30:09 2015 UTC,"The movies are never canon.  Just roll with it.  X-men's first line up in the comics and X-men first class should have been the easiest benchmark to establish this point.  Beast being on the team as an almost grown man. (60's...first class) Cyclops cameo in that shitty Wolverine film (as a kid... 1980s) Angel in X3 (2000s?), no Jean grey in any prequel."
xmen,30a7mp,sleepymelon,1 point,Thu Mar 26 13:57:02 2015 UTC,"you need to differentiate between comics and movies. To me the X-Men movie universe is simply an alternate earth. According to the official marvel handbook its even part of Marvels Multiverse. And you have to create a ""canon"" within your universe. the X-Men films retconned a lot of stuff and DOFP was partly designed to streamline things more and align them more properly. So saying they dont give a crap about canon is false. Maybe they didnt in the past, but now they certainly do. I guess the whole Jubilee in the original movies thing will just be retconned. I mean it doesnt affect anything. she barely was in the other movies for like 10 seconds anyway."

xmen,30a7mp,lecturermoriarty,3,Thu Mar 26 01:28:51 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much Jubilee in a nutshell though. She's like Bobby in that respect. Capable of amazing things, but she just doesn't have the drive. As a mutant, she could have been omega level. As a vampire, she showed potential to be one of the single most powerful of them.   But all the potential in the world doesn't mean anything if you don't  push yourself to reach it. She's mostly cool with just putting in a minimal amount of work then having fun. It's a bit more serious now in that fun is playing with her fat bebbeh. But I think that's been a constant. She could be one of the big players in the worldwide battle of superpowers. She doesn't want to be though."
xmen,30a7mp,The_Sven,8,Thu Mar 26 07:42:51 2015 UTC,Useful to the team is not the same thing as useful to the storyline though. I'd much rather watch a weak character written well than have a vampire in the next X-Men movie.

xmen,30a7mp,indiekindy,9,Wed Mar 25 22:34:50 2015 UTC,no she is a teenager in her original appearances in the 90s. Kind of like Kitty in the 80s. In fact Jubilee essentially replaced Kitty in the early 90s.
xmen,30a7mp,figandmelon,5,Wed Mar 25 22:38:11 2015 UTC,"Kitty and Jubes are in their 20's now but for all of the 90's she was a teen 13-17 roughly.

xmen,30e16o,dgener151,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:59:16 2015 UTC,"From a logistical standpoint it could be good for the franchise. X-Men is so full of big name talent at this point (Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Kelsey Grammar, Halle Berry, etc.) And that means big money for contracts. It also means they'll likely be receiving a lot of other offers for work, so there's no guarantee they'll stick around any longer then they're contracts require them to (Jennifer Lawrence already expressed that she wants this to be her last X-Men film). Bringing in fresh new talent could mean a greater chance of retaining the same cast because these new actors don't have anywhere near the same stream of incoming offers. Even if 2-3 films in some of the new cast members start to make it big, they might stick around just out of loyalty because that's where they got their start.   Also, I doubt these new actors were chosen without having had to audition. Using Last Airbender as an example is pretty extreme given the many issues with that film, but in following with your example, the kid who played Aang was chosen due to his martial arts skill with the reasoning that it would be easier to teach a martial artist how to act decently than to teach an actor to adeptly handle a stick (for child actors anyway). You can't honestly think Lana Condor was chosen purely because of her race, can you? You realize there are almost more Chinese people in the world than any other kind of person? A Chinese (or at the very least Asian) actress can't be so hard to find that it would make the filmmaker's go ""screw it, just find me anybody Chinese, we'll figure out the acting bit later""."

For me, Cyclops hasn't been right for years... but you're right about Chuck being creepy and goading Scott into killing him. That book was lazily written.

The next arc, collected in the ""Here Comes Tomorrow"" TPB, is New X-Men #151-154.  The fact that Jean was the one who made Scott kiss Emma on top of her own grave, of course, is known by absolutely none of the characters, but the readers criticizing him for doing it should know better."

xmen,308wke,MrJayOhh,2,Wed Mar 25 15:35:40 2015 UTC,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD:  Okay, before I go spouting off why I think your post couldn't be more accurate, I have to say that Cyclops is one of my two absolute favorite X-Men, so there's a little bias on my end haha. ANYWAYS, I agree completely, and what is truly bumming me out more than anything else about the current X-Books is that Cyclops and his small band of mutants are the only group that resembles what the X-Men have stood for all these years. Or at least that's how I see it. And that bothers me because I HATE the fact that so many of my other favorites seem to just despise the guy now. I mean Hank and Scott are supposed to have been best friends, but Hank won't even give him the time of day! They were all there for Jean (well, not Hank, but you get it) when she was possessed by the Phoenix and wiped out countless lives, be they human, alien, broccoli or what have you. They tried to HELP her before she took things into her own hands. Why can't they do the same for Scott? I feel like if anyone has fallen from grace its the X-Men at the Jean Grey school. They seem to have a pretty warped sense of what Xavier's dream was all about, which is a shame. This was really solidified for me in Uncanny #31 when Storm forced Matthew Malloy off the property. Granted, it had appeared that he gone and killed Cyclops, Magneto and Emma Frost, but that's beside my point. There is a panel where says, ""...there's nothing for you here, mutant!"" (link: http://i.imgur.com/qX5mEaH.png). Its like he's somehow below her. I hate it. For me, that perfectly sums up the way the teachers at the Jean Grey school see things nowadays, circumstances aside. They're isolationists, just sitting idly by doing their thing, while Cyclops is out there trying to save his race.   I think you're totally right, Cyke's got some shit to sort out with himself before he can go on, but I think they're really trying to put him back on the path to making him the hero that we all love him as. There's a good deal of development on that in the latest issue of Uncanny (#32) if you haven't already read it."
xmen,308wke,JohnnyNewspaperseed,2,Wed Mar 25 15:55:01 2015 UTC,"I've read #32 - I'm want to know what happens next, but I'm worried. I don't want the revolution to end. Heartwarming reunion with Alex though.  Storm is saying 'mutant' like it's a slur. I find that really unbecoming. Also, every X-person in that school should know better than to go for a direct confrontation with someone on that power level.  There's a conflict between Cyke's and the Jean Grey School. The schism actually happened for a real reason, and being the face attached to the death of Xavier worsened it. That's understandable and legit. But my beef is that no one except for Cyke's was acting like an X-Man in that crisis, and Cyke's is painted as a villain for doing that. And I think that emotional baggage aside, he has a point that Xavier handled the situation poorly by not letting the X-Men know about the crisis he had to handle; he should have gone to his fellow mutants to say ""hey, I had to put a block on buddy because I had no other option to save lives at the moment, but what do you think we should do about him?"" And this is a very Xavier thing - he has a serious case of elastic morality and father-knows-best when he chooses to make exceptions to his principles. It's also part of why Cyclops is awesome, because Cyclops is the person on Marvel Earth who cares the most about what it means to be an X-Man - and that puts him in conflict with the others, and especially with Xavier when his mentor has moral lapses.  My problem with all this is that Bendis has a clear stance that what Cyclops did with Malloy somehow crossed a line, and that he had to pay for it. To me, that's a clear betrayal of the spirit of the series. Also, he's not writing on the real conflict with Cykes and the X-Men. They should not accuse him of having murdered Xavier; they should instead be mad that it happened as a consequence of Cykes taking his militant stance to the extreme by messing with the Phoenix Force. Although to be fair, if I remember well, they didn't choose to get possessed by it, and the AvX storyline makes a lot of hooha about Hope Summers (thank Dog she's gone) being the only one with the strength of refusing the Phoenix's power for herself. So sour feelings about what they did with that power can only go so far also.  Sorry, this turned into a bit of a rant. :P"

I also didn't care for his stint on Runaways. At the time, other books were depicting Kingpin as being in prison. Joss wanted to use him, so he disregards that. Meanwhile, the Punisher is after the kids, because that's what Frank Castle is all about: gunning down children.  My takeaway is Joss does well in his own sandbox, but he doesn't play well with others. He has a propensity for disregarding what's established about a character, rather than just work around it."

If you're trying to showcase a theme of the X-Men, and highlight mutant issues and showcase a compare/contrast between mutant minority groups, like the Morlocks and do an event like Mutant Massacre, then maybe not as directors, but I feel it would be best if guys like David Benioff & D.

The focus is entirely on the lives of mutant teenagers living on the streets in a world that hates and fears them - they've slipped through all the cracks, and not even Xavier or any X-Men swoop in to save the day (it doesn't even need to be an alternate reality from the movies as a result; their only appearance might be on the news in the background just like in the comic). The powers weren't overused and aren't of the budget-eating nature to begin with, and X-23 would finally have a chance to kick some ass on the screen."
xmen,300ody,cryrid,2,Tue Mar 24 02:56:25 2015 UTC,That sounds like a great idea.

I really like Cyclops. I literally can't remember the last time he even used his optic blasts in the comics. Almost all the character defining moments I can think of that made me actually like him didn't even involve his powers. I think he's a great character right now.   And the thing is, I'm positive I would have agreed with the author if I'd come to the franchise a bit earlier. And if I'd have received what I demanded, the character would be far far less interesting as a result.   I'm a fan, but frankly fans often don't know what we're going to enjoy. We think we do, but that's just the nature of being within an audience. Trying something new is always better than stagnating. If it comes out poorly, well there you go. But not trying means never growing or creating anything amazing. And failure just means tripping and rising back up to attempt it again later on."

Again, as much as we would like to believe these shows are for the fans they are produced to attract large audiences. These shows can be successful without the approval of the fans and Fox has proven that it not a priority. What I am saying is that there are better places for this to happen than at Fox.  Not having something happen or stagnating as you call it can be better than putting out an inferior product. Would it have been Better to release Batman and Robin by Joel Shumacher or let the franchise stagnate until a better director and script came along? That film killed the franchise and altered the publics opinion of batman, effectively keeping the character off of movie screens for almost a decade. This article says that Fox's The budget and track record do not make them the ideal platform for this kind of show. Also, the cyclops example was not specific to cyclops. It means, TV budgets take the super out of the super hero. Fox can't afford the spectacle that goes into these spectacular heroes. I want them to have dialogue heavy episodes because they are establishing characters, not because they have to talk about the cool stuff that they can't pull off."

I just copied this description of her punk look from Uncanny X-Men.net  2) After an extended stay in space, Storm changed. Egged on by Yukio during a stay in Tokyo, Ororo's internal change also manifested in her look. Having become tougher, Storm cut off her hair to a short Mohawk and wore a punk outfit, consisting of leather pants, a tight shirt and boots, matched with the vest she won from Callisto as a symbol of her leadership of the Morlocks. The ensemble was complete with strong eye-make-up and she also took to wearing different kinds of earrings with her uniform, the lightning bolt earrings eventually becoming a standard part of her outfit.

You could probably get away with black instead of dark blue for the pants and bra.  Here's some reference pics:  One  Two  To me, classic 80s Storm is the bodysuit with the leather vest and gloves, like your picture.

xmen,2zy63f,tec2030,2,Tue Mar 24 04:48:06 2015 UTC,"This may help:  Beginner’s Guide to Reading X-Men  You can jump ahead to the beginning of each section and start reading with little to zero previous knowledge. Read each section and any prerequisite knowledge you’ll need will be provided.  This guide is intended for new readers to the series. It goes over many of the main story arcs, but not every single one. It sticks very close to the main titles, and is nowhere near to all there is to read in the X-Universe. Each section also includes an optional section to help get you started in the extended X-Universe. I know a franchise like X-Men can be daunting to jump into, and I hope this entices you get reading.    The Original X-Men (1963-70) & Modern Retellings    This is the very beginning, and you’ll need no previous knowledge to start at this point. This era is different than most because you have multiple options when starting with stories of the original team of X-Men.   Your first option would be to read some of the original issue of X-Men. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created the X-Men in 1963. I would say a good intro to the series would be the first 20-25 issues. These first two dozen issues aren’t very important later on down the line, but they do introduce characters that will be with us for all of X-Men’s history. Read this if you’ve read other SIlver Age comics or if you’re just adamant on reading every issue. Secondly, we have a more modern take on Silver Age stories. It is a three volume series called X-Men First Class. It is a standalone series from the mid 2000’s that follows the original five X-Men in some all-ages adventure. This series is perfect for kids and adults looking to get into the series. Between all three volumes it is around 30 issues, but they read a lot faster than the old SIlver Age comics. You’d probably get through these faster than the original Lee/Kirby run. Lastly, your final option would be a graphic novel from 2012 called X-Men: Season One. If you’re in a hurry, then this is the quickest way to read about the original X-Men. Similar to First Class, it’s a modern take on early stories of the X-Men. It retells the first few issues from the Lee/Kirby run through the eyes of Jean Grey.   From here you can move on to the next section or take a look at one or more optional arcs that each section will have. They’re not essential, but they will introduce you to more facets of the X-Men universe.    OPTIONAL: If you want to continue on reading the original series after the first 20 to 25 issues, you can either continue reading the all the silver age issue up to #66. X-Men is put into reprint until 1975 when the title relaunches with a new creative team aka the Claremont era.    The Chris Claremont Era (1975-1991)    This is the start of Chris Claremont's time on the book. While Stan Lee and Jack Kirby invented the X-Men, Chris brought them back from obscurity and perfected them. He is on the book for 17 straight years, and his whole run is basically one very long story. Some of his characters and plot points still have lasting effects in comics that are being released today. It's best to read it all in order, but I broke it up a bit for those who want to jump around.  No matter where in Chris’ run you decide to start reading, I recommend that you all read Giant-Size X-Men #1. While Chris didn’t write this issue, it is the jumping off point for this era. Many popular X-Men are introduced included Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Storm, and Colossus.  After that you’ve got a few options as far as starting points (there may be some overlapping):   As I mentioned earlier read Giant-Size X-Men #1 first! The first era of Chris’ run includes the storylines like The Phoenix Saga, The Dark Phoenix Saga, Proteus, and Days of Future Past. The reading order is Uncanny X-Men (v1) #94-143. Issue #94 picks up right where Giant-Size X-Men #1 left off. Chris’ second era on the books begins when Kitty Pryde joins the team and Jean Grey had died after becoming Dark Phoenix. You’ll see the storylines: Mutant Massacre, Fall of the Mutants, and Inferno. The reading order is Uncanny X-Men (v1) #139-243. (Note that some arcs crossover with other X-Men titles). The end of Chris’ era as he abruptly leaves Marvel in 1991. This section includes the introduction of Gambit and Jubilee. It also includes the storylines X-Tinction Agenda and The Muir Island Saga. The reading order is Uncanny X-Men (v1) #244-280 and X-Men (v2) #1-3. (Note that some arcs crossover with other X-Men Titles).     OPTIONAL: God Loves, Man Kills: This is a standalone graphic novel that was written during this era. It's widely regarded as one of the best X-Men stories of all time. It was the inspiration for the second X-Men movie.    OPTIONAL: From here Claremont left Marvel. He was supposed to take over this new X-Men title, but it was moved over to other writers after he left. If you want to read more about what Chris would have done after #3 then read series' X-Men Forever and X-Men Forever 2. Fair warning, those were ended before he could finish up all of his plot threads.    X-Men in the 90’s (1991-2001)    After Chris leaves Marvel in the early 90's, we see a period where the now two main X-Men titles HEAVILY cross over with each other. I usually recommend new readers skip the 1990's era until you've read more X-Men, and can test that waters out on your own. After you move into the modern era most of the 90's won't be relevant anyway, so it’s not that big of a deal to skip over it.. If you’re insistent, there are plenty of reading guides available online that can help you navigate your way through the decade.    OPTIONAL: Age of Apocalypse is a self contained story that takes place in an alternate universe. It’s collected into to four trade paperbacks, but it’s almost universally accepted that you can skip Vol. 1. Read Vol. 2 through Vol. 4 for a more cohesive story.    Start of the Modern Era (2001-2004)    Grant Morrison took over X-Men (v2) in 2001 and it was renamed New X-Men for his entire time on the title. X-Men, and Marvel in general, was struggling in the ninties. This title brough X-Men back from the grave. It is what brought X-Men into the modern era of comics and is highly regarded on of the best complete runs on an X-Men title since Claremont left Marvel after X-Men (v2) #3  Read in this order:   New X-Men #114-154     OPTIONAL: Chris Claremont started a new X-Men comic around this time called X-Treme X-Men (v1). It's not as great as his earlier work, but if you're a fan after reading his first run, then it may be worth checking this out.    Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men (2004-2008)    This is a direct response to Grant Morrison's run on New X-Men, and it is just as highly regarded. Whedon is a huge fan of X-Men, and it really shows with this book. Unlike New X-Men, instead of renaming one of the main books, Astonishing is a brand new book that runs separate from the current X-Books isn’t included in any events or crossover (at least during the Whedon run). Read in this order:   Astonishing X-Men #1 - 24 Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men #1     OPTIONAL: Warren Ellis takes over creative control of this comic after Whedon leaves and is also a decent read. He writes the title from #25-35 and also for the mini-series Astonishing X-Men: Xenogenesis #1–5.    The House of M, M-Day, and the Mutant Messiah (2005-2011)    This section is basically going to be a whole bunch of mini-series and crossovers. They all fit in really well together, and they're super important in the X-Men and Marvel universe as a whole. The events here set the stage for a huge shift in the X-Universe.   Reading order:   House of M mini series Messiah Complex Crossover Cable (v2) #1-12 Messiah War Crossover Cable (v2) #16-24 Second Coming Crossover Schism mini series     NOTE: Most would say that Cable (v2) issues are optional, but I highly recommend them. They make the story a little more complete in my opinion.    OPTIONAL: Mike Carey has a great 7 year run on X-Men Legacy (aka X-Men v2) during this time period. His issues crossover with most of the X-Men events of the time, but for the most part it's easy to follow. Read in this order: X-Men (v2) #188-204, X-Men Legacy #208-216, X-Men Original Sin crossover (not related to Original Sin 2014), X-Men Legacy #219-225, #238-248, Age of X crossover, and X-Men Legacy #249-260    OPTIONAL: Uncanny X-Force (v1) by Rick Remender is one of the most celebrated X-books in recent history. It’s largely self-contained, check out #1 - 35.    Avengers Vs. X-Men and Marvel NOW Relaunch (2012-present)    Avengers Vs. X-Men isn't apart of the Marvel NOW relaunch, but it's a very important plot element that directly affects the X-Men Marvel NOW titles.  What you need to know beforehand: Scarlet Witch altered reality by deleting the X-Gene from all but 198 mutants. After a while the first mutant, Hope, was finally born. After running through time for 16 years with Cable to protect her, Hope comes back to the present as a young woman. She is now believed to be the new host for the Phoenix. Oh, also Cyclops and Wolverine are fighting and they split the X-Men into two separate teams.  Reading order:    Avengers Vs X-Men mini-series All-New X-Men #1-15 Uncanny X-Men (v3) #1-11 Battle of the Atom Crossover All New X-Men #18-21 The Trial of Jean Grey Crossover All New X-Men #25-37 Black Vortex Crossover Uncanny X-Men #14 - current All-New X-Men #40 - current     OPTIONAL: After you read ""The Trial of Jean Grey"", you can then start on Cyclops (v3) #1. This is the space adventures of young Cyclops from the past, his space-pirate father Corsair, and his team.    Congratulations, if you've read everything on the list, you are now a X-Men X-pert!"
xmen,2zy63f,tec2030,1 point,Sun Mar 22 23:19:07 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/n9IdJj7.png   This was my attempt to align some of the various X-Men titles visually based on references, character depictions, and crossover events. It's tricky to do as time doesn't move 1:1 between issues and titles.   I haven't kept it up since AXIS, but it should still give you an idea of how Uncanny, All-New, and Wolverine and the X-Men fit together for the first 85% of their runs.     As for recommendations, so far I'd definitely say All New XMen and Uncanny X-Men. Wolverine and the X-Men v1 is good too, but as you can see it actually starts before AvX so it may not be as modern as you're looking for. V2 started to set something up with Quentin Quire, but I'm not sure how far it really progressed and I'm not sure if it will be anything relevant for Secret Wars. Likewise I can't see Spiderman and the X-Men being overly relevant for SW either. I'm still playing catchup with X-Men and X-Factor, so I'm not sure how important those will be in the long run. Amazing X-Men has had arcs focusing on Nightcrawler and Juggernaut, if you're interested in the latest on those characters."

But he did regenerate nearly his whole body after the nuclear explosion in Japan; but that was instantly with his full powers. The way he died now with the virus and the elapsed time of that corpse inside the puddle of adamantium, there is no good way in the 616 universe to bring him back.  The one thing left is where they left off with Wade Wilson in his Death of Wolverne issue where he teamed up with the aged Steve Rogers. The last page leaves him sitting next to a cloning machine with a bit of Logan's unaltered DNA and Wade thinking of what he should do.. But then that would be a clone and not the Logan we grew to love."

xmen,2zufba,logangrey123,2,Sun Mar 22 00:18:49 2015 UTC,Most modern movies look good. Few movies I have seen the last 2-3 years have I walked out thinking it looked bad. The problem is that the movies themselves are often shit.
xmen,2zufba,GoldandBlue,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:38:39 2015 UTC,"Right, but as long ago as 2006 seems, especially if you were a kid at the time (I was 20, I don't mean that condescendingly, but to 29 year old me 9 years ago just doesn't seem very long at all), I thought that movie looked like shit in many areas. The effects of the bridge? Of the ""epic"" final battle? Beast obviously being on wires while jumping around? It was just a garbage film in just about every facet (some of the actors are the only positive of that film, Ian especially did a good job with Mags in that one, and Kelsey was and always will be the perfect adult Beast.)  edit: And I almost hesitate to write this, but the opening scene of DOFP always struck me as being obviously done on a sound stage. Especially Bishop, the effects around him and his gun just don't seem that convincing to me. I mostly love that movie, it's a small complaint, but there's still progress to be made!"
xmen,2zufba,ThreeHourRiverMan,4,Sun Mar 22 03:56:28 2015 UTC,That is kind of surprising to me.  I remember when DOFP came out a lot of people were saying it was the 2nd most expensive movie ever made behind only Avatar.

xmen,2zpk4a,tjj7,3,Fri Mar 20 16:15:53 2015 UTC,Magneto definitely killed him it really just doesn't make sense any other way.  I'd bet if we got to see Matthew Vaughn's DOFP instead of Singers I don't think it would even be up for debate.  I think Singer took over and liked this idea from the script but changed it to make Magneto more sympathetic.
xmen,2zpk4a,whiskeybill,8,Sun Mar 22 03:41:36 2015 UTC,"I think Mystique killed JFK. Read through [thebentbullet.com](thebentbullet.com). Magneto was following him around to protect him. In the sixties though his powers weren't as honed as they were by the time of the chronologically later movies. Remember, JFK was assassinated only a year after the events of First Class when Magneto had to struggle to move bigger items."
xmen,2zpk4a,The_Sven,2,Fri Mar 20 16:13:29 2015 UTC,When they are training in First Class Xavier won't shoot at Magneto because he knows that it isn't really a challenge for him.  That's why he has Magneto try and move that huge satellite dish because that would actually be training for him.  On the beach he can control 100's of missiles at once so I don't think JFK's assassination would give him any trouble at all at that point.
xmen,2zpk4a,whiskeybill,2,Sun Mar 22 03:45:55 2015 UTC,"I think each case is a bit different of a scenario though. Each time he knew where the objects were coming from and had time to prepare (even just a few seconds). With the JFK assassination though while he was alert and tried to be ready, without that little extra bit the bullet was able to reach it's target. He was able to interrupt it slightly thus the bullet being ""bent."""

I don't know if it's worth watching, but it's at least worth having on in the background while you're doing other things.  As for X3... I dunno.  It might be more manageable to watch knowing it's basically ret-conned in DOFP.  There are occasional redeeming moments.  I think the most annoying thing is just that it shits on the source material (ie, the comics)."
xmen,2zisue,Kupy,2,Sun Mar 22 04:06:47 2015 UTC,"I thought I was the only person who thought Orgins got too much hate. Yeah, some of the CGI was bad but the movie itself wasn't too bad."

His name wasn't Deadpool though. He was a Weapon # program mutant by Stryker to try and kill Logan but something went wrong and he basically tore himself apart by the end of the arc.  He looked a bit different but he was a amalgamation of mutant powers like they did with Deadpool I'm Origins.   I wish I could remember his name or which one of the Wolverine standalone series he was in, but I haven't read those books since the early 90s."

xmen,2zisue,slicwilli,3,Thu Mar 19 23:49:36 2015 UTC,"Watch them all in the order they came out. The reason people hate on X movies is because they don't respect the source material. You aren't familiar with the comics, so that won't matter to you.  In order to understand some of the things that happen in The Wolverine and Days of Future Past you're going to want to watch X3."
xmen,2zisue,The_Sven,2,Thu Mar 19 00:03:28 2015 UTC,"X3 bugs me a little because instead of the Phoenix Force being a demigod tied to the heart of creation it is just Jean Gray being mentally ill. But not sticking to the source material is not why I hate that movie.  I hate that movie because it was a bad movie. The acting was phoned in, the dialogue was awful, they badly shoehorned in a meme into an action scene, etc. I could go on. Like how when introducing the new characters they just said ""Oh, I'm Calipso, I run real fast. That guy over there is spiky dude, he shoots spikes."" The director is a total asshat. Singer got really screwed over by Fox.  There are many reasons to hate X3 that don't have anything to do with not sticking to the comics (the movies that are considered the good ones don't really stick to the comics either)."
xmen,2zisue,MrFrogy,2,Thu Mar 19 01:11:03 2015 UTC,"Just watch X3, it's not as bad as everyone says.  DOFP will have more meaning to you if you watch X3, but you NEED to watch X3 and then The Wolverine in that order, before watching DOFP.  You did not mention The Wolverine, but it is very well done, and a must-watch IMO.  Also, DOFP will have more meaning if you do.  Origins/Wolverine is a stand-alone movie that will have nothing to do with any other X-men movie, in regards to story arc.  Again, it has some cool moments, but it will not 'pull' you in like the newer ones.  Watch it or don't, it doesn't matter."
xmen,2zisue,Farscape5,1 point,Wed Mar 18 23:49:20 2015 UTC,"So the newer movie titled ""The Wolverine"" is well done and relates to the other movies, but ""Xmen Origins: Wolverine"" is the one that people didn't like as much and doesn't really relate? The newer one is the one that should be watched before DOFP?"
xmen,2zisue,MrFrogy,2,Thu Mar 19 00:29:59 2015 UTC,Yes and don't forget to watch the end credits of both X-Men 3 & The Wolverine BEFORE DOFP.
xmen,2zisue,princeblue,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:42:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely.  It delves into Woverine's ties to Japan, which is directly from the comic books.  It also completes Wolverine's story as it ended in X3, then the very end is a (weak) lead-in to DOFP.  lol"

xmen,2zajnh,Apophys421,4,Tue Mar 17 04:40:40 2015 UTC,I think the argument could be made that pretty much each X-Man's death is that of a Martyr for Charles Xavier's dream.   Prof X himself recently sacrificed himself to the Phoenix Cyclops to preserve the dream.
xmen,2zajnh,wellssh,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:23:12 2015 UTC,Yeah I definitely agree. But Im struggling to find specific events and comics...  aside from Professors X. Kind of new to the genera.
xmen,2zajnh,nickferatu,3,Tue Mar 17 00:57:57 2015 UTC,"SPOILER  Wolverine recently died saving younger mutants from undergoing Weapon-X style modification procedures. He clawed a big, bubbling beaker of molten adamantium which poured already his very weakened self."
xmen,2zajnh,TragicEther,2,Tue Mar 17 07:02:39 2015 UTC,It's pretty much the X-Men's raison d'être.  They protect a world that fears and hates them in the name of tolerance and equality.
xmen,2z7eu5,WSable,12,Mon Mar 16 05:45:02 2015 UTC,Warlock was a big part of New Mutants so I would read there. He first appears around the Demon Bear arc.  Wiccan was pretty much all Young Avengers so try those.  Shogo has only been in Battle of the Atom and Wood's run on X-Men.  Cloak and Dagger had a good series in the 80's but have been side characters since.
xmen,2z7eu5,Zthe27th,1 point,Mon Mar 16 11:34:33 2015 UTC,"That's the 90s New Mutants, right? Vol 3 didn't start until 2009, so was that vol 2?"
xmen,2z7eu5,Zthe27th,5,Mon Mar 16 16:31:37 2015 UTC,He was in vol 1 which was the 80's run as well as the 2009 run.  He was in All-New X-Factor as of recently
xmen,2z7eu5,Fett02,3,Mon Mar 16 16:44:11 2015 UTC,"For Warlock, that would be for Vol. 1.   Warlock also more recently appeared in Vol 3. of New Mutants (the 2009 one) starting about the Necrosha tie in arc (issue 5 of that run) until it ended, and even more recently in All-New X-Factor, which was recently canceled.    Between the those two New Mutant volumes, Warlock mostly appeared in Excalibur (not sure the exact issues, but it was later in the series), his own series, and then minorly the Annihilation Conquest event and more majorly its tie-in issues in Nova."
xmen,2z7eu5,bdez90,3,Mon Mar 16 16:49:52 2015 UTC,The only thing I can think of on your list is Children's Crusade. Features Wiccan a lot because it's about finding Scarlet Witch after M-Day. Also Dark X-men dealt with Cloak and Dagger a bit.
xmen,2z7eu5,srstone71,3,Mon Mar 16 10:38:03 2015 UTC,The first two volumes of Runaways have some pretty cool Cloak and Dagger stories.
xmen,2z7eu5,Ickulus,3,Mon Mar 16 10:51:07 2015 UTC,"The current run of new ultimates has ultimate cloak and dagger. And Wiccan was basically the focus of the Young Avengers that ended last year. Neither are x books, but at least you have those characters."
xmen,2z7eu5,Ickulus,2,Mon Mar 16 15:28:21 2015 UTC,"That's fine. I may check out Young Avengers, but I'm trying to stay away from Ultimate stuff since I've never really read Ultimate stuff and it seems as though it's coming to an end."
xmen,2z7eu5,xooxanthellae,2,Mon Mar 16 16:29:59 2015 UTC,I only started because I got marvel unlimited so it was free. I have liked some of the ultimate stuff.
xmen,2z7eu5,slicwilli,3,Mon Mar 16 17:00:53 2015 UTC,"Cloak & Dagger started off as their own team with their own comic. There's some good ones from the 80s, like Child of Darkness, Child of Light."

xmen,2z6j9v,soulreaverdan,2,Mon Mar 16 01:47:59 2015 UTC,"There were a lot of really irritating plot threads that just got derailed with Cataclysm canceling UC:X-Men. Sinister, Apocalypse, Magneto, Xavier, Magda, Wanda..."

xmen,2z4qa3,Mevansuto,4,Sun Mar 15 15:46:48 2015 UTC,"Yes. Was the first X-men series I got into and i've been disappointed with everything ever since. Story is consistently great and art is beautiful up until about issue #26 when the switch Larocca out for some shittier artist(which was tolerable, but just couldnt compare with Larocca). Trust me, it's well worth the read."
xmen,2z4qa3,nicktheman2,4,Sun Mar 15 23:56:45 2015 UTC,"Yes. I think it's a better run than Morrison's New X-Men.  However, it's not really groundbreaking or memorable. It's just pretty good and enjoyable.  Mekanix is a must-read for Kitty Pryde fans. It's one of my favorite runs. It really stands out as the best, I think.  I also really enjoyed God Loves Man Kills II. I can see why people would criticize it, but I thought it was great. It also might be the cheapest way to get the original God Loves Man Kills, since they are both together in one volume.  I enjoyed Claremont's X-Men Forever as well. Other than Mekanix & GLMKII, I think X-Men Forever is better than X-Treme."
xmen,2z4qa3,xooxanthellae,3,Sun Mar 15 19:02:28 2015 UTC,"I've been holding off on this, but I just got all the trades on ebay today. I'm really excited for them to come in. Mekanix was very expensive though! :(  X-Men Forever 1 & 2 will probably be my next big batch buy."
xmen,2z4qa3,tec2030,2,Mon Mar 16 03:24:34 2015 UTC,Yeah it took me a while to bite the bullet on Mekanix. Worth it.
xmen,2z4qa3,xooxanthellae,2,Mon Mar 16 03:35:09 2015 UTC,I managed to pick up the entire Mekanix mini-series for less than $20 on eBay. I'm pretty keen to read it.
xmen,2z4qa3,apocalypsenowandthen,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"Could you talk more about what made Mekanix so good? I remember thinking it was a throwaway series and having not enjoyed the more modern Claremont, I just ignored it when it came out."
xmen,2z4qa3,c0unt_zer0,5,Sun Mar 15 20:09:31 2015 UTC,"First, it does what Morrison utterly fails to do: explore the emotional reaction to 16 million mutants dying in Genosha. Specifically, Kitty mourns her father.   It follows Kitty as she leaves the X-Men and goes to college. She ends up going to therapy. There is a pretty significant reveal about her character, which is very brief and subtly done, but I don't know if I should spoil it.   It's Kitty growing up, written by the man who created her. And, along the way, she battles some anti-mutant hate groups and also sentinels. It's still an X-Men comic after all."
xmen,2z4qa3,xooxanthellae,2,Mon Mar 16 00:33:20 2015 UTC,That sounds awesome. I'll going to check if I can track down the issues this Wednesday when I go into the comic store. Thank you.
xmen,2z4qa3,c0unt_zer0,3,Mon Mar 16 06:56:40 2015 UTC,"Note that Mekanix the tpb also includes X-Men Unlimited #36, which is very important and ties in nicely with Mekanix. However, X-Men Unlimited #36 is also available in Marvel Visionaries: Chris Claremont. XMU 36 is basically the introduction to Mekanix, so read it first."
xmen,2z4qa3,xooxanthellae,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:28:12 2015 UTC,"First, it does what Morrison utterly fails to do: explore the emotional reaction to 16 million mutants dying in Genosha. Specifically, Kitty mourns her father.    9/11 occurred the same month that the Genoshan Genocide was published. There's a reason that entire plotline was immediately down played. Mechanix was published well over a year later."
xmen,2z4qa3,systemstheorist,3,Mon Mar 16 02:39:12 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the reasons, it's still an artistic failing of the run. And honestly that sounds like kind of a dumb editorial decision. The only reaction they show to the death is gallows humor jokes -- does that make sense after 9/11?  Wasn't there a scene in X-Treme X-Men where they're watching the news in horror at what happened in Genosha? Even that was more than Morrison did."
xmen,2z4qa3,xooxanthellae,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:09:16 2015 UTC,It also might be the cheapest way to get the original God Loves Man Kills   The paperback version of GLMK is insanely cheap. I think less than $10 new on Amazon. It's cheaper than that if you buy used.
xmen,2z4qa3,tec2030,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:27:15 2015 UTC,I've seen II cheaper than I. Currently II costs 50 cents more than I (at least for a decent copy) --- not too bad to try out a whole run for 50 cents.
xmen,2z4qa3,xooxanthellae,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:36:04 2015 UTC,Oh I got most of x-treme in a tpb bundle so I wasn't sure if the exact price.
xmen,2z4qa3,tec2030,5,Mon Mar 16 04:37:34 2015 UTC,"I for one loved it. It was the classic kind of X-Men adventures, in contrast to the trying-to-be-edgy character reinventions going on in New X-Men at the time. X-Treme X-Men was really the last time Storm was written well."
xmen,2z4qa3,hyogurt,1 point,Sun Mar 15 20:27:32 2015 UTC,You obviously haven't read Pak's new Storm solo.
xmen,2z4qa3,tec2030,2,Mon Mar 16 03:22:53 2015 UTC,So it only took a decade after X-Treme X-Men for another writer to get Storm right.
xmen,2z4qa3,hyogurt,3,Mon Mar 16 06:13:19 2015 UTC,"I'll add that his New Mutants stuff was also good, but argue it falls under the Uncanny era umbrella."
xmen,2z4qa3,daflash00,3,Sun Mar 15 19:39:28 2015 UTC,No. Most of Claremont's work beyond his main Uncanny run leaves something to be desired. The magic isn't there.
xmen,2z4qa3,daflash00,5,Sun Mar 15 16:09:46 2015 UTC,"Really, even Mekanix?"
xmen,2z4qa3,xooxanthellae,0,Sun Mar 15 18:59:20 2015 UTC,Really. Even Mekanix.
xmen,2z4qa3,daflash00,2,Sun Mar 15 19:38:01 2015 UTC,"If you're saying Mekanix isn't worth reading, you're just being excessively critical."
xmen,2z4qa3,xooxanthellae,3,Mon Mar 16 00:52:25 2015 UTC,I don't think that's fair. An opinion was asked and an opinion was answered.
xmen,2z4qa3,daflash00,-1,Mon Mar 16 06:19:09 2015 UTC,"Well, that's my opinion of your opinion. It's one thing to say you didn't really like Mekanix, but you can see that someone else might like it. It's another thing to say it's not worth reading. I mean, it's got 100% 5-star reviews on Amazon. Clearly someone out there likes it."
xmen,2z4qa3,xooxanthellae,3,Mon Mar 16 16:24:32 2015 UTC,"It's five reviews from a book from 2003. Two by the same person. So, I don't really know what to say here: You win? You're right? Of course someone is going to like it. But it's petty to keep coming at me just because I dared disagree. Leave it alone, already."
xmen,2z4qa3,daflash00,2,Mon Mar 16 21:40:20 2015 UTC,"I actually enjoyed his third run on Uncanny, especially the end. End of Greys is a great arc."
xmen,2z4qa3,tec2030,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:21:52 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with this. I read every issue of this as it came out during my X-completist years, but while I think it's  a definite improvement over his abortive return to the main titles, it has all the hallmarks of late-period Claremont: unsatisfyingly convoluted and insular in the extreme (no pun intended). Lovely Larocca art, though.  It's been a long, long time since I've read Mekanix, so I can't really comment; I liked the highly stylized Celia Calle covers, though."
xmen,2z4qa3,VaudevilleDada,1 point,Mon Mar 16 01:34:19 2015 UTC,Agreed. He continues to write like he did when he first started on Giant Size back in the 70s. Comics have changed but Claremont hasn't. No disrespect to his first run. That shit is gold.
xmen,2z4qa3,thebadone411,3,Sun Mar 15 16:43:27 2015 UTC,Claremont has been evolving the entire time. His style in the 80s was way different from what he was doing in the 70s. And I think X-Treme & X-Men Forever are quite a bit different too.
xmen,2z4qa3,xooxanthellae,2,Mon Mar 16 03:21:47 2015 UTC,He didn't write Giant-Size. That was Len Wein.
xmen,2z4qa3,thebadone411,1 point,Sun Mar 15 17:03:24 2015 UTC,That's true. My bad. Since literally right after Giant Size

Yeah, Jean's new found power set is rad, but it's offset by the shitty new mutants in Uncanny and the constant whining by EVERYONE in All-New. I can't keep throwing money at a storyline that isn't going anywhere.  Side-note: Wtf was with that girls night shopping spree issue during the introduction of the new inhuman.

I was not yet a teen during aoa and the fact that it was a different universe in a kind of ""what if"" idea made me absolutely HAVE TO read more xmen stuff so I could get A grasp on the history behind the 616 universe and beyond and put it all into categories etc. I have so much love for aoa because of it. I've even got a few of those collected gold foil covers they put out. I understand how a smarter comic fan could have been totally turned off by it though. That shit was awesome for me and sparked the collector fire from those books forward. Now I have finally downgraded to about 8 longboxes from the 80 a buddy and I bought for 2 grand from a comic store that folded. Those aoa books stayed."
xmen,2ywbfg,BullyJack,5,Fri Mar 13 14:16:12 2015 UTC,People only know like 2 Apocalypse stories and AoA is the most well known. They are just assuming. It would be weird to do another time traveling alt reality movie right after DoFP which was pretty grounded all things considered.
xmen,2ywbfg,Zthe27th,1 point,Fri Mar 13 11:23:53 2015 UTC,"""The Twelve"" being the other?"
xmen,2ywbfg,stratargy,3,Tue Mar 17 20:24:57 2015 UTC,"I would say AoA and his turning Angel into Death were the most well know. The less said of ""The Twelve"" the better"

xmen,2yw9ez,warghuul,2,Fri Mar 13 10:02:13 2015 UTC,Yes! There are trades paperback and hardcover graphic novels that collect almost all (and certainly all the important) comics you want to read.    Check out: http://crushingkrisis.com/definitive-guide-to-collecting-x-men-as-graphic-novels/  Even these can get rather expensive.  I would also consider keeping an eye on comixology --they often sell digital copies of x-men for $0.99

Seriously that's a lot of comics and unless you have amazing amounts of free time (and dedication, to avoid having to take sanity breaks) it'll take years to get through them all. In all likelyhood you're better off finding yourself a recent jump-on point and then maybe catching some classic storylines in spare time. But going for all of the comics? That way lies madness."
xmen,2yw9ez,Malek_Deneith,1 point,Sat Mar 14 14:45:25 2015 UTC,"There are several ways to skin this cat: omnibus, Marvel Masterworks, Essential X-Men (black & white, but cheap), trade paperbacks, Marvel Unlimited (digital, but might not have all the issues). I read all of Claremont's run, and I just bought a combination of the above, based on what is cheapest.  The original 1963 Stan Lee run of the X-Men gets a lot of flak. At least read the first few issues to get the origins, and then decide from there if you need to read more. Then jump to Claremont's 1975 resurrection of the X-Men.  Here's my cut & paste response for every time this is asked ---  I recommend starting with Chris Claremont's run that made the X-Men popular --- Giant Size X-Men #1, Uncanny X-Men #94-280, the graphic novel ""God Loves, Man Kills"", and X-Men: Vignettes 1 & 2.   This is an extremely helpful site: http://crushingkrisis.com/collecting-x-men-comic-books-as-graphic-novels/  There's also a good documentary about Chris Claremont's X-Men: http://sequart.org/movies/4/comics-in-focus-chris-claremonts-x-men/  If you want to skip around rather than reading every issue, here are my favorite story arcs, in chronological order:   Proteus (Uncanny 125-128) -- their first really dangerous enemy; I highly recommend the trade paperback which has some great additional stories Dark Phoenix Saga (Uncanny 129-137) -- widely considered the best ever, not my favorite though Days of Future Past (Uncanny 141-142) -- Kitty travels back in time from a dystopian future God Loves, Man Kills (graphic novel) -- possibly the best place for a newcomer to start The Brood Saga (Uncanny 154-158, 161-167) -- a mix of Alien & The Matrix, includes the first meeting of Magneto & Professor X (#161) and the first meeting of the X-men & Rogue Wolverine (Claremont/Miller limited series 1-4) -- the first Wolverine comics, must-read From the Ashes (Uncanny 168-176) -- one of Joss Whedon's favorite runs; Wolverine's wedding; Rogue joins the X-Men; Storm gets a mohawk Havok & Wolverine: Meltdown (limited series 1-4) -- highly recommended, great artwork X-Treme X-Men: Mekanix -- must-read for Kitty Pryde fans. Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men run 1-24 (the Warren Ellis run after this is also good). The Whedon run also has an amazing motion comic partially available on Netflix. Remender's Uncanny X-Force (Vol. 1)"
xmen,2yw9ez,xooxanthellae,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:33:41 2015 UTC,I'm in the process of reading EVERYTHING.   I think it's going to end up being somewhere between 5000-6000 comics total.   I'm 10 months into the project and have covered 1600 comics but only because I can read them at work.   This is going to take me several years to complete.
xmen,2yw9ez,Dylan_Innes,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:09:45 2015 UTC,"Also, skipping the shitty ones is essential. I didn't read any of the flagship series before Giant-Size (Read X-Men First Class to cover this period instead). Most crossovers before the 90s aren't worth your time, and also a lot of Excalibur I've found to be pretty excruciating so far."

xmen,2yutis,warghuul,2,Fri Mar 13 09:15:01 2015 UTC,"That film had way more continuity issues than that. Emma Frost being a villain in the 60s and then showing up as an innocent teenager in the 70s is a good example. (I know this movie was first, but XFC was much, much better.)  Really, that film is rubbish and it's been completely wiped away from continuity after Days of Future Past, so I wouldn't worry yourself about it too much. X-Men: Apocalypse might give us a glimpse of the beginning of their relationship in the new ""real"" (movie) X-Men timeline."

I don't think they're wrong, but it's not like it's any worse than the comics.  I don't think there's anything that can't be explained away with a good fan theory.   Maybe Scott just doesn't remember that one guy he saw for a few minutes however many years ago. Maybe the trauma of being kidnapped is the only part he remembers. Maybe that hot chick that turns into diamond is the only one he was focused on. Maybe some villain tampered with his brain at some point. Maybe he peeked at his Christmas presents and Xavier got a little overzealous helping him forget.  There's a lot wrong with a lot of the X-Men stuff put to film, but I don't know that continuity is one of the big ones."

xmen,2yr87g,JargonPhat,3,Thu Mar 12 13:54:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, Claremont really had a sense of ownership of the title. I wasn't until X-Factor showed up and the spin offs started to happen that he began to lose creative control. Sure he and Louis Simonson worked very well together for New Mutants X=men and X-factor but with the success of the Mutant Massacre in 86 and the yearly crossovers since then and all the success business wise because of that marvel begain to really horn in and after a while he got sick of it and then left."
xmen,2yr87g,x-mencollector,5,Thu Mar 12 16:59:10 2015 UTC,"She was supposed to be an exit for scott. The writers of xmen wanted the team to always evolve and change. Jean was dead, the professor was going to leave and Scott was the last of the originals still hanging around. So Maddy was brought in as a way to have scott exit organically.   Then the controversy of Jeans return came up and Jean returned and all of it was shot to shit. Personally I loved the original X-Factor. After the mutant massacre the xmen went to shit and xfactor filled that void. It wasnt until Gambit showed up that xmen got good again and by that time the original team was crossing over more and more."
xmen,2yr87g,x-mencollector,7,Thu Mar 12 09:57:25 2015 UTC,"Come on now.  There were 40 issues between the massacre and the first appearance of Trenchcoat McGee.  Fall of the mutants, a rumble with the Brood, introduction of Genosha, and Inferno.  I guess to each their own, but I had a blast with a lot of those stories..  I did really enjoy X-Factor too, though."
xmen,2yr87g,IamJacksUserID,2,Thu Mar 12 11:58:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I love the outback era. I think Reavers / Brood / Genosha / Inferno was the best string of story arcs they had in a while --- and I think it's the last great era in Claremont's run.
xmen,2yr87g,xooxanthellae,0,Thu Mar 12 21:25:10 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed inferno, but the Brood 2.0 had nothing on the original saga. Genosha while a great concept sucked until Extinction Agenda and that involved Xfactor and a way better xmen team.  Dazzler sucks, Longshot was a shiity replacement for nightcrawler, Psylocke 1.0 was terrible. Gateway sucked because the jet was taken out of the equation. The Revers would have their asses handed to them if Scott was running the team, Havoc was a pussy too.  Fall of the mutants blew ass, The new mutants part was terrible, the X-men side was not as bad but the one that really hit it out of the park was X-Factor vs Apocalypse and the introduction of Archangel. Does anybody even remember the Adversary or Roma anymore? Freedom Force was a joke, hell Scott and Jean by themselves whipped their asses, Scott blasted a hole through the Blobs arm and Jean tossed the others around like toys. The X-men team at the time couldn't handle those chumps and there is a reason why, they were all 3rd stringers at best. Imagine the Avengers vs that team, it wouldn't have made for a compelling x-over. Nothing from that era has a single relevance to the X-universe now. The only reason I have those issues is due to completion sake, they are apart of the 544 run and I need them for that run. In my opinion it was the worst run in the X-men line, 214-265 fucking blew.  Loosing Kitty, Kurt and Rachel really hurt the team dynamic, Excalibur was an abortion too."

xmen,2ypyfu,gothams_shadowknight,2,Wed Mar 11 21:00:25 2015 UTC,Magneto had already been enhanced by the machine. The whole series he we had seen a Cytorak infused Magneto.   Mystique? Well she's a shapeshifter. Later on in the series though she doesn't stay in that form. It's possible it wore off as well.  Though it could be that it was never drained out. Scott and Alex only lost their altered appearances after expending all of their power. It may have also been their rejection of the mental changes.   Sabretooth and Mystique though are physical mutations. Mystique probably shifted back into the form she likes. Sabretooth may have simply gotten a haircut. But they could never expend the added power like Cyclops and Havok.   And again the power may have worn off for all of them. Magneto later on needs to undergo the super soldier process because his age has caught up with him at an accelerated rate.

xmen,2ylext,chasers_,9,Tue Mar 10 20:37:17 2015 UTC,"It's such a bummer. The show was so well made, and the lead up to a AoA was so awesome."
xmen,2ylext,GirIsKing,5,Tue Mar 10 20:42:07 2015 UTC,so if Fox ever loses control of the X-Men we can have this show come back?
xmen,2ylext,chasers_,5,Tue Mar 10 21:14:47 2015 UTC,"aint no way Fox is losing X-Men, bub."
xmen,2ylext,bugcatcher_billy,4,Tue Mar 10 21:18:09 2015 UTC,"It's a tricky situation. Fox doesn't want to loose X-Men. Marvel doesn't want to promote X-Men through the things they can; toys, tv, comics, costumes. Marvel's reasoning is centered around they don't profit from encouraging people to watch X-Men movies.   Fox doesn't have licensing to create tv shows, toys, costumes, or comics. They want to use all of those mediums to generate revenue and interest in X-Men, but they can't. Because of that, Fox's interest in the X-Men movie franchise is limited, since other franchises allow them to do all sorts of licensing.   Ultimately the studios will have to determine which one is loosing the most. Fox has to push out an X-Men movie ever so often to maintain licensing. Marvel is already reducing cost on the comics, but is missing out on revenue from the X-Men fans who eat up all 20 X-Men publications, all tv shows, and all video games.  Either Fox will say it isn't worth us to produce X-Men movies anymore, unless we buy other licensing rights, or Marvel will say it isn't worth us killing an entire fan base and franchise, just because we can't make X-Men movies. Once that decision is made, one side will cave into the other. If that decision is never made, then the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters shuts down for good.   TLDR: Marvel & Fox both own different chunks of X-Men licensing, giving both of them good reason to not do anything and let the X-Men rot."
xmen,2ylext,ChurchBrimmer,4,Wed Mar 11 02:42:04 2015 UTC,"You know I still see X-Men toys in the store, I still buy X-men Comics (all of them) at the same price as other comics. I even see them crossing over with the newly incredibly popular (thanks to the Marvel Studios film of the same name) Guardians of the Galaxy. If Marvel were trying to edge out the X-men why would they do a crossover with one of their money makers instead of crossing Guardians with say...the Avengers? On top of that why would they bring is several popular X-men story universes in the mash-up of Secret Wars? Secret Wars would be the perfect time to minimize the X-men.   This whole theory is Fantastic Four fans trying to protect themselves from the truth: The Fantasic Four sucks. It sucks so bad the team left to join other teams. Yes cancelling the book was about money. It was about the fact that Fantastic Four comics don't make any. Why waste resources publishing a book that doesn't sell? It's not like they killed the characters off, they're still around, like I said they just joined other teams."

Also, who would make and distribute the comics if Fox had control?   It is a major stretch to say they don't give a shit about X-Men. They just have much more profitable avenues to be pursuing. And a lot of the characters in the big storylines are still X-Men characters."

It's clear they aren't even trying with x-men and fantastic four, there isn't some official edict saying forget about the xmen, but there may as well be given their status.  You can say, oh they're not selling as well so why bother?

My points were mainly based at the fact that Marvel aren't gonna actively take steps that will lose them revenue and/or not benefit them in any way.

xmen,2y5tap,zombie_hunterx,7,Fri Mar 6 18:43:53 2015 UTC,He's saying JFK was a mutant.  He was there to stop the assassination and was able to stop the first bullet but not the second.  Presumably the culprits were working on behalf of anti-mutant entities.
xmen,2y5tap,yellowdartsw,1 point,Fri Mar 6 18:47:30 2015 UTC,Thanks.
xmen,2y5tap,whiskeybill,4,Fri Mar 6 18:50:08 2015 UTC,"Magneto said that he was there to prevent the assassination but that doesn't really make any sense when you think about it.  If Magneto bent the bullet and it struck and killed JFK you can assume that if he had done nothing then the bullet would have missed and JFK would still be alive.  In the first X-Men movie Magneto can just stop bullets in flight so presumably he could have just done the same here if he were so inclined.    I think what really happened here is that in earlier drafts when Matthew Vaughn was going to direct Magneto was supposed to be more of a villian so he was the one who assassinated JFK, playing to the whole ""bent bullet"" conspiracy crowd.  When Singer took over I suspect they wanted to make Magneto more sympathetic and its hard to do that when you've got him assassinating a beloved US President.  So someone rewrote it to make Magneto more of an anti-hero who was trying to prevent the assassination but like I said above, it doesn't really make sense.  Then again, this is all speculation on my part so who knows."
xmen,2y5tap,theglassjaw,3,Fri Mar 6 23:18:27 2015 UTC,I think the implication was supposed to be that Magneto was trying to stop the assassination but couldn't because those behind it interfered and stopped him; presumably the same people who imprisoned him.
xmen,2y5tap,wreak_havok,3,Fri Mar 6 23:48:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I picture it as he was ""touching"" the bullet to stop it and was tackled or something which caused it to curve around as his concentration was broken."
xmen,2y5tap,whiskeybill,1 point,Sat Mar 7 00:00:27 2015 UTC,So he is trying to stop the bullet and is tackled causing the bullet to fly into the one spot he was trying to not hit?  I don't buy it.  And it doesn't change the fact that it would have missed without his interference.

xmen,2y5tap,whiskeybill,3,Mon Mar 9 02:46:31 2015 UTC,Yea but that doesn't change that if he hadn't bent the bullet the shot would have missed.
xmen,2y5tap,MrBigD77,2,Sat Mar 7 00:24:29 2015 UTC,"I think in the change of script you go from bent bullet to multiple shooters. He stopped a bullet; maybe another and somewhere in the mix maybe he wasn't able to stop a bullet or some sort of ricochet. Or you go the Winter Soilder theory, he tried to bend Buckys arm so the shot would miss and failed."
xmen,2y5tap,whiskeybill,2,Sat Mar 7 18:46:19 2015 UTC,"Well I think we can write out the Winter Soldier having anything to do with this, but honestly I think you are making this way more complicated than it is."

xmen,2y418n,brohbafett,2,Fri Mar 6 06:01:32 2015 UTC,Age of Apocalypse was an alternative reality. It's not part of the main timeline. Xavier is just being indirect. He's gently reminding Jean that the Phoenix is potentially dangerous while trying to avoid sounding directly accusatory or anything like that.
xmen,2y418n,Jumbledcode,1 point,Fri Mar 6 06:32:18 2015 UTC,Also when the Phoenix first showed up and when Jean later returned from the dead it was explained that she was at the bottom of the ocean in some kind of stasis and the Phoenix took her form.
xmen,2y418n,ChurchBrimmer,1 point,Fri Mar 6 06:42:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah but by the point OP is talking about, she would have already gotten those memories from when the dark Phoenix had taken her form. It was sometime in X-Factor Vol 1 I think."
xmen,2y418n,tec2030,1 point,Wed Mar 11 12:07:40 2015 UTC,"To build off of /u/Jumbledcode's first point, the Age of Apocalypse was an alternate reality where Xavier died and Magneto was the leader of the X-men. He wasn't as good of a leader and couldn't prevent the rise of Apocalypse. In the main time-stream, Earth 616, they still battle Apocalypse, but the fight goes much differently. I think it's The Twelve saga? with Ages of Apocalypse, where Apocalypse attempts to put himself into X-man's (Nate Grey from AoA timeline) and Cyclops jumps in and takes him into his own body instead."

Not that anyone should have expected a cosmic forth of death and rebirth to be taken care of by the likes of Hope and Wanda in the first place, but the first person to ignore ""No More Phoenix"" was Jason Aaron, who introduced the same future version of Quentin seen in BOTA in an issue of W&TXM."

xmen,2xzn44,detourne,1 point,Thu Mar 5 14:19:55 2015 UTC,"The problem is I don't know what that order is. I can't really find a good ""Master Timeline"" because the one on /r/Marvel is telling me kind of the same thing that the guy above is telling me."
xmen,2xzn44,ploftus00,1 point,Thu Mar 5 16:31:22 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's difficult to keep track of in a linear arc, because multiple titles overlap and run concurrently as major changes start gaining traction in the world of mutants. I'd say to start at AvX to understand where the big divides start, then work through Wolverine & The X-Men, Uncanny x-Men, and All New X-Men; keeping in mind that they're all going on in roughly the same period of time.  AvX leads directly into Wolverine and Cyclops coming to an impasse and setting up their respective schools, the differences in their ideology become clearer and more compelling, both characters evolve in a satisfying way through those books.  All-New X-men will set the stage a bit wider with the original time-displaced mutants in the present, and eventually lead to Battle of the Atom. It gets wonky at a few points but from there you'll have the gist of what things have been leading up to.  Beyond that point there, Id recommend Uncanny Avengers just for the political nature of the Avengers Unity Squad, and also Colin Bunn's Magneto ongoing series"
xmen,2xzn44,ploftus00,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:14:51 2015 UTC,"Okay, so here's where I have a problem, and hopefully you can help me. I just looked up all the Battle of the Atom titles and one of them is Wolverine and the X-Men 36. Except that can't be right because I started reading WXM #1 and had a problem understanding it because I had missed the events of Battle of the Atom.   Other than that I'm going to read up to the following for each book, and then read Battle of the Atom: All New X-Men 16 X Men 5 Wolverine and the X-Men 36 Uncanny XMen 12  Those are the first crossover issues, so I will read up to them. In addition, after Battle of the Atom I will read Magneto, Uncanny Avengers TP 4 and 5, Nightcrawler (I'm a fan of Chris Claremont), All-New X Factor and X Force."
xmen,2xzn44,kastroescobar,2,Thu Mar 5 17:21:50 2015 UTC,I think you started reading Wolverine and the X-Men Volume 2.  That started in 2014.  Volume 1 started in 2011 and was a pretty great series. Light years ahead of the BMB stuff.
xmen,2xxynr,ProjectInsight,7,Wed Mar 4 20:13:09 2015 UTC,"As long as Mark Waid has been a major name in superhero comics, it's almost surprising that he hasn't been tapped to write a lengthy X-Men run by now.   Waid had a run in the 90's with Adjective-less X-Men for a few issues post AoA, pre Onslaught, until he came into conflict with the X-Office over forced crossovers, IIRC.   I'd love to see Hickman pull the same dynamic as the Avengers/New Avengers with Uncanny/Adjectiveless. Give him 5 years and unlimited funds. That's all I ask."

xmen,2xxynr,detourne,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:34:27 2015 UTC,"Why would you want two writers who have gone on record that they don't get the very metaphor on which the franchise is built?  And anyway, Jason Aaron already had control of the franchise and damaged it severely."
xmen,2xxynr,BearSpeak,3,Fri Mar 6 07:18:50 2015 UTC,How did Jason Aaron damage the franchise? Are you talking about Battle of the Atom? I thought he made that story just to set up the universe so primadonna Bendis could play with his toys. Or are you talking about Aaron bringing Nightcrawler back?  In my opinion Wolverine and the X-Men was the best thing Marvel was putting out until Waid's Daredevil and Fraction's Hawkeye started.

Unless you're absolutely dying to read every single comic, I think that's the perfect starting point. I also HIGHLY recommend subscribing to Marvel Unlimited. You'll get access to every comic released up until 6 months ago, which is a super cost-effective way to catch up.   If you want to start at Schism, the following books branch from it:  Wolverine and the X-Men Uncanny X-Men  Those two books collide in Avengers Vs. X-Men, which is a really fun event and also another really good starting point.  After Avengers Ve. x-men, you have:   All-New X-Men (AMAZING story) Uncanny X-Men X-Men (all female team, very fun read)  Astonishing X-Men"

xmen,2xww6c,ActualButt,2,Thu Mar 5 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"I recommend starting with Chris Claremont's run that made the X-Men popular --- Giant Size X-Men #1, Uncanny X-Men #94-280, the graphic novel ""God Loves, Man Kills"", and X-Men: Vignettes 1 & 2.   This is an extremely helpful site: http://crushingkrisis.com/collecting-x-men-comic-books-as-graphic-novels/  There's also a good documentary about Chris Claremont's X-Men: http://sequart.org/movies/4/comics-in-focus-chris-claremonts-x-men/  If you want to skip around rather than reading every issue, here are my favorite story arcs, in chronological order:   Proteus (Uncanny 125-128) -- their first really dangerous enemy; I highly recommend the trade paperback which has some great additional stories Dark Phoenix Saga (Uncanny 129-137) -- widely considered the best ever, not my favorite though Days of Future Past (Uncanny 141-142) -- Kitty travels back in time from a dystopian future God Loves, Man Kills (graphic novel) -- possibly the best place for a newcomer to start The Brood Saga (Uncanny 154-158, 161-167) -- a mix of Alien & The Matrix, includes the first meeting of Magneto & Professor X (#161) and the first meeting of the X-men & Rogue Wolverine (Claremont/Miller limited series 1-4) -- the first Wolverine comics, must-read From the Ashes (Uncanny 168-176) -- one of Joss Whedon's favorite runs; Wolverine's wedding; Rogue joins the X-Men; Storm gets a mohawk Havok & Wolverine: Meltdown (limited series 1-4) -- highly recommended, great artwork X-Treme X-Men: Mekanix -- must-read for Kitty Pryde fans. Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men run 1-24 (the Warren Ellis run after this is also good). The Whedon run also has an amazing motion comic partially available on Netflix. Remender's Uncanny X-Force (Vol. 1)   Five great single issues:   Uncanny 117 - Professor X does mind battle Uncanny 150 - the first great Magneto story Uncanny 153 - the funniest issue, Kitty's Fairy Tale Uncanny 205 - Wolverine vs Lady Deathstrike Uncanny 268 - Wolverine hanging out with Captain America in Madripoor in the '40s   Stuff that didn't make the cut:   Uncanny 94-124 -- highlights include the Phoenix Saga (101-108, good background for Dark Phoenix) and a great Professor X story in issue 117. Otherwise you won't miss too much if you skip to Proteus. Uncanny 177-228 -- there's some good stuff here but for me it's not as good as the previous stuff. Highlights include Lifedeath (tpb), and issue #205 is a must-read for Wolverine fans. Uncanny 229-239 -- I think this run is worth checking out. It includes 3 story arcs leading into Inferno: The Reavers (and the X-Men's move to Australia), the return of the Brood, and Genosha. This would be a good time to check out the Wolverine unlimited series. There's some good stuff after this, esp Psylocke becoming a ninja (256-258) and Wolverine & Cap America in #268, but it's in a bit of a decline (although Jim Lee's art is incredible).   Grant Morrison's New X-Men run gets recommended a lot, but personally I think it's overrated. The art undergoes jarring shifts as artists change, some of the art is truly bad, and it's a damn shame how Morrison assassinated Magneto's character. And there's basically just 4 X-Men in it, 3 of them being members of the original Stan Lee team."

I fel that it is way less hypocritical than having a universe where Superheroes = Good but Mutants = Racism and Fear.
xmen,2xsnow,triggermanx97,5,Tue Mar 3 22:09:24 2015 UTC,Superheroes = Good but Mutants = Racism and Fear   Superheroes represent the best of what humans can achieve. Mutants are a reminder that humans are not the pinnacle of evolution. I actually think it fits with human pysche that within the Marvel Universe that the Avengers/FF are beloved while the X-Men reviled.
xmen,2xsnow,yourthirdbestfriend,3,Wed Mar 4 01:35:22 2015 UTC,"That's what's odd with it. You're more likely to be born a mutant than to achieve those other fears. Even a mutant with something simple, like having weird hair, is more common than being chosen for a secret super soldier program intentional designed to replace baseline humans in battle, or carelessly launch your unregulated spaceship into dangerous cosmic energies, or invent a world-changing technology with your unlimited inherited fortune."
xmen,2xsnow,Hraesvelg7,1 point,Wed Mar 4 04:09:40 2015 UTC,"Also for the most part Superheroes are usually created, Super Solider, Suit of Armor, Magic Hammer,  they are people setting out to be heroic.    Mutants are people maybe unworthy of this power, also sometimes cause get destruction when their power 1st awakens kind of like the Hulk who seems the least trusted and respected of the Avengers."
xmen,2xsnow,SparksKincade,4,Wed Mar 4 07:10:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not well versed in the comic book world, but it seems like the categorical divide between supers and mutants is:  Supers = alien (Thor)/accident (Spiderman/Hulk)/technological advances (Iron Man/BatmanDC )  Mutant = humans with genetic mutation  Now how that affects people's attitude toward them I don't know. How would anyone even know whether someone was a mutant or just had an accident?"
xmen,2xsnow,emptycalsxycuriosity,6,Tue Mar 3 23:56:42 2015 UTC,"I'm decently knowledgeable about comic books but even I don't fully understand how the people can be cool with superpowered beings but not with mutants, both sides are just as equally helpful and just as dangerous.  There are plenty of mutant heroes and villains and there are plenty of heroes and villains that got their powers through other means.  It just seems really contradictory."
xmen,2xsnow,triggermanx97,2,Wed Mar 4 00:36:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert either, but to my knowledge it's because the mutants are a different species than humans, homo superior instead of homo sapien. Mutants are the more evolved form of humans and will eventually overcome them in population. People don't like the idea of a different species becoming dominant, I guess."
xmen,2xsnow,ShelteredCanadian,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:01:15 2015 UTC,"That's always been weird. Mutants are a dangerous threat who might overpower and replace mankind; norse gods, sentient robots, all kinds of aliens, secret government modified superhumans, time travelers, and sorcerers are just fine folks."
xmen,2xsnow,Hraesvelg7,1 point,Wed Mar 4 04:05:40 2015 UTC,"It's something that has bothered me since I was a kid. They hate the mutants for being born with their pOwers (done if which are admittedly off putting), but the avengers are beloved bastions of freedom."

xmen,2xsnow,EVula,7,Tue Mar 3 17:37:06 2015 UTC,Hey ya never know. I said the same thing about Spider-Man but look where we are. Maybe AoA will be ridiculously bad and Fox will be in a similar position as Sony was.
xmen,2xsnow,The_Sven,13,Tue Mar 3 18:20:28 2015 UTC,"The situation isn't comparable, though.  Fox, as a studio, is much healthier than Sony is. Sony needed the deal because they were doing so poorly, but Fox has a more diverse number of films it is working on. The X-Men franchise as a whole has also performed much better than the Spider-Man movies have; this will still be true even if the Apocalypse movie bombs. Speaking of franchises, there are far more possibilities for X-Men spin-offs (such as Deadpool) than there are for Spider-Man (RIP Aunt May film), which should be taken into account as well when it comes to the overall health of the franchise.  There's also the fact that it'd be much more difficult, narrative-wise, to incorporate mutants into the MCU. Spider-Man? Pfft, just have him have his accident now and boom, that's why he wasn't around for any of the movies. But mutants existing for several decades and not even SHIELD knowing about it? That doesn't make sense, and would be kinda hard to work in.  If Fox decides to play ball with Marvel Studios, it'll probably be with the Fantastic Four, and that will only be if the new movie completely tanks. Even then, it's likely that Fox would just sell it outright to Marvel, rather than try to co-produce stuff; going back to my first point, Fox has more than enough on its plate as a movie studio, so they don't need the distraction."
xmen,2xsnow,EVula,2,Tue Mar 3 18:29:21 2015 UTC,Idk man.  Shield didn't even know about inhumans until recently.
xmen,2xsnow,agonistcandi,2,Wed Mar 4 03:56:40 2015 UTC,There's a huge difference between biologically-indestinguishable-from-human individuals walking around (and not having any powers until exposed to a not-widely-availble substance) and a biologically-distinguished offshoot from homo sapiens that spontaneously develops powers at a certain age.

Plus with so many mutants around, why would The Avengers have to deal with Loki in New York alone? Why wouldn't ANY mutant help?    I would prefer they just left them separate, rather than coming up with some silly explanation."
xmen,2xsnow,SayAllenthing,8,Tue Mar 3 18:27:44 2015 UTC,But...those are the same problems that exist in the comics. The X-Men wouldn't help because they got their own problems going on. Mr. Sinister or Mojo popped up that week.
xmen,2xsnow,Over_Exaggerate,3,Tue Mar 3 19:10:47 2015 UTC,"The comics crossed over and can't fix that, the movies don't have to even step into that problem.    Like why would spider-man bother chasing the Green Goblin around when he can just call Jean Grey to absolutely destroy him? I mean, they live in the same city, why can't the hulk fight Mr Sinister, and Nightcrawler teleport The Kingpin into the stratosphere?    There's too much explaining to do, and I think it's fine the way it is."

Jean Grey is a little busy having the mansion be attacked by Brood to help you catch the Chameleon on that day, it's that simple."
xmen,2xsnow,Over_Exaggerate,4,Tue Mar 3 19:28:32 2015 UTC,"Why would I wash my laundry when I can just get my friend who lives in the same city to do it?   Because New York doesn't get destroyed and people don't die if you don't do your laundry.  The idea that all villains are attacking on the same days is ridiculous. In the comic world they have to pump out monthly issues, but in the movie world big events only happen once or twice a year, they would be free and able to help."
xmen,2xsnow,SayAllenthing,3,Tue Mar 3 19:57:32 2015 UTC,That's implying that when the heroes are not on screen they are just sitting around waiting for the camera to point t them.  That's not true. See Winter Solider. Its told through exposition that Cap has been doing stuff.  Also why doesn't Cap call Ironman after he finds out that Hydra has taken S.H.E.I.L.D? Because Ironman is doing science off screen.

I loved those kids from the Weir/DeFilippis run. It was when I first got into comics and I was so sad when M Day hit because half of them were depowered and thrown into comic limbo and the other half were killed.

It all started off as a somewhat light-hearted look at the mutant school environment but M-Day turned dark and caused some major chaos. They all kind of faded into obscurity after that (Elixir was sort of important later and Prodigy came back to the Young Avengers despite being depowered, but that's basically it). Wind Dancer kind of came back in the New Warriors but the character acted and looked pretty much nothing like her."

xmen,2x6ciq,tehvolcanic,11,Thu Feb 26 03:52:06 2015 UTC,Those powers eventually faded away and his speed returned in X-Factor.
xmen,2x6ciq,HumanChicken,2,Thu Feb 26 04:11:49 2015 UTC,"I believe his power was so amplified that he couldn't use them in the conventional way, it was basically either ""off"" or in ""ludicrous speed!"" which made him able to travel through time."

xmen,2x6ciq,rillip,25,Thu Feb 26 05:11:36 2015 UTC,"Also, I don't understand these type of complaints.  They're introduced, and then one day, out of the blue, we're told 'Theyre Magnetos kids!' and just because that story was told back in the day (probably before a lot of us started reading) we accept it as fact.  But then today, they're continuing this decades-long ongoing story, and they throw new surprises at us, like the idea that they may not be mutants, and people say how annoyed they are.  Why? This is fiction, it's all fiction. It's all made up. The characters, their parents, their species and race. It's all just a story. Surprise, new character! Surprise, they're mutants! Surprise, they're Magneto's children! Surprise, they're not! Surprise, they're not mutants! Surprise, it was the Scarlet Witch's imagination all along!  The fact that they're still telling stories about the same characters for the last 20-40+ years should tell you that they're going to play around with the details sometimes."

I don't care if Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are Inhumans instead, but the reason they're doing this, in order to make everything in line for the MCU is what pisses me off. If it was just unique storytelling and trying something new and different, I wouldn't care, but they're writing two of the most prominent mutant Avengers (the only real competition being Beast ) out of canon for the sake of making the movie be sensible? Fuck that."
xmen,2x6ciq,megastonerd,0,Thu Feb 26 03:55:03 2015 UTC,"I think of it as unique story-telling born out of competition. FOX changed from Juggernaut to Quicksilver only just after it was announced the twins would be in Avengers 2.   It's a good twist, more so in the comics as it's been one of the only recent changes to long standing continuity that is revelatory and has staying dramatic power (unlike the death of the month club, see you next year Wolverine!)"
xmen,2x6ciq,sbooyah,1 point,Thu Feb 26 06:29:55 2015 UTC,"I perhaps wouldn't mind so much if being a mutant wasn't so integral to Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver's whole story arc. I mean their major character moments have always been struggling between their identity as mutants and as Avengers. On one hand they're Earth's most beloved heroes, on the other hand they're marginalized by their status as mutant, and are constantly torn between whether their time as Avengers cheapens their mutant identity. It makes things like House of M, and Son of M, and their past with the Brotherhood seem invalid all of a sudden. For these reasons I find it cheap. I wish the comic universe and the movie universe could just be separate. I wouldn't care if the twins were Inhumans in the MCU, that'd be a clever work around and still be fun for THAT story, but trying to shoehorn it into the comics is what makes me frustrated as a reader. It's like comics fans' decades of dedication to continuity is being reversed to appease movie watchers, and that feels cheap to me."
xmen,2x6ciq,MysterioTheBlack,3,Thu Feb 26 17:26:38 2015 UTC,That's fair. It's definitely frustrating when story elements are added that feel like they stem directly from movie rights rather than interesting story telling.

xmen,2x5gt1,wreak_havok,4,Wed Feb 25 22:30:32 2015 UTC,"There were two ""consciouses"" for Logan in DOFP. The original timeline Logan (A) who exists in 2023 [""like in the future fifty years from now?""] and a 1973 Logan (B) that had not yet experienced any of the original movies (he did however turn down Erik and Charles in the bar in 1963, XMFC).   OG Logan's mind (A) went back in time and bumped this '73 conscious (B) out. OG Logan (A) experiences all of the events in '73. There's a moment in Paris where he freaks out because he's getting pulled back to the future and '73 Logan (B) who has essentially been hibernating and inactive starts to take back over. B Logan is confused as to where he is and how he got there because future Logan (A) has been driving the ship. By the end of the movie, OG Logan (A) is sucked back to the time period he came from (2023), but now in a new timeline created by the events of DOFP.   So the question is what happened in that 50 years between the White House lawn events and Logan awaking in his bed again in the ""bright future""? Whose mind was controlling Logan for all of that time? It was of course B Logan. He's pulled from the river having no idea how he got there. The last thing he remembers is going to bed with a girl in New York and some weird moment in a white room in Paris with a guy named Charles Xavier. B Logan is then the character in X-Men Apoc. He will have no memories of the original timeline and will not even really know any of the people from DOFP, as that was not his mind during those events.   In fact, B Logan is the true tragic character of DOFP. He simply ceases to exist the moment that A Logan awakes in the ""bright future"" and is kicked out of control forever.  Capisce?"

xmen,2x4r1k,PG2009,1 point,Thu Feb 26 05:35:20 2015 UTC,I think the healing stuff is actually from the Chuck Austen era. That's around the same time they decided his bald tattooed head was actually a hoodie (that he hadn't taken off for 15 years) hiding glorious blond locks.
xmen,2x4r1k,_Woodrow_,2,Thu Feb 26 11:48:24 2015 UTC,"The fall of the mutants is a great series, this is basically Apocalypses introduction by writer Louise Simonson.

To get to know him better in THAT form check out Age of Apocalypse, one of the best Crossovers the X-men ever did."

On the surface it seems like it's less important than the arcs it's between and you may not be missing much plot progression wise in terms of those arcs if you skip (especially when you view the series as a whole), but you will be missing out on character progression, specifically Psylocke  and Fantomex."

xmen,2x5zks,PG2009,2,Wed Feb 25 22:58:35 2015 UTC,"Uncanny is mostly about Cyclops and his weird anti-hero angst after accidentally killing Professor X.  However, the writers seem to be shifting gears because the end of the last issue seems to have ended the main plot points that have been carrying the book so far.  Wolverine and the X-Men recently ended, because you know, no Wolverine.  But a new title that focuses on the school just started.  Only two or three issues out so far.  Spider-Man and the X-Men, no joke, is going on the premise that Wolverine contacted Spider-Man before he died and said there is some kind of a mole/traitor in the ranks of the students and wants Spidey to help uncover them.  The best part about it so far is how little Sorm, current headmistress of the school, trusts Spider-Man.  It could end up being a pretty good story but it's still a little too early to tell imo."

Considerably less popular is X-men: Legacy, which is all about David Haller (Legion) and his quest to do whatever he feels like.  I really enjoyed it.  Also, if you haven't read X-men First Class, it's fun.  It's self-contained issues of the original X-men, not much angst."
xmen,2x1w0d,goldygreen11,32,Wed Feb 25 00:03:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, sleep isn't well understood.  There are many theories about why we need to sleep, why we sleep so long, why we have REM sleep, why we only have one mode of sleep (unlike some animals that can sleep and still move or be aware) and what happens inside our brains when we do sleep.   So, it may not be a simple matter of sleep ""healing"" something."
xmen,2x1w0d,apalehorse,4,Wed Feb 25 00:29:08 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that the longer you are awake, the more of a certain chemical builds up in your brain. Large concentrations of this chemical cause some kind of health isssues, but when you sleep, this chemical gets processed into another substance that can then be converted back into the ""bad"" chemical while you are awake. So in this particular theory that I probably simplified way too much, its like recharging a battery."

xmen,2x1w0d,GoldandBlue,12,Wed Feb 25 08:02:56 2015 UTC,"He has gone through several life-threatening changes that boosted his power explicitly, so his healing factor is actually more powerful now than it was when we first saw him.  But writers still definitely take liberties."
xmen,2x1w0d,TheUncannyWalrus,12,Wed Feb 25 11:39:43 2015 UTC,"I have no idea which issue I read this in, but in one arch the more work his healing factor has to do the more sleep he needs. He was with Angel doing something and had to sleep for like two days to put himself back together. The other mutants with them confirmed that he sleeps during his more intense healing sessions. I think it says this in a novel I read too, but I don't that's considered canon."
xmen,2x1w0d,J_Cant_Box,8,Wed Feb 25 01:13:35 2015 UTC,"This was mentioned in the 'Fall of the Mutants"" arc.  Claremont was the writer then.  It was when they were at Eagle Plaza fighting the Adversary I believe."

xmen,2x1w0d,J_Cant_Box,13,Wed Feb 25 02:55:10 2015 UTC,The same reason why he drinks and smokes even though the healing factor implies that neither of those things would affect him: because it's fictional and they are plot and character devices
xmen,2x1w0d,brandofillomen,8,Wed Feb 25 02:55:56 2015 UTC,They have talked about how it takes a lot to make him drunk.
xmen,2x1w0d,xooxanthellae,8,Wed Feb 25 03:45:18 2015 UTC,I mean it's there to make him look cool.
xmen,2x1w0d,brandofillomen,6,Wed Feb 25 03:47:36 2015 UTC,"Well, we still don't know why we need to sleep.  It's theorized that there is waste in our brain and sleep gives us a chance to clear it up."
xmen,2x1w0d,StarsInAutumn,6,Wed Feb 25 00:28:05 2015 UTC,I think the main reason he sleeps as much as he does is because the body is using the minimal amount of energy which then it can put more energy to the healing factor.
xmen,2x1w0d,Glorakoth,4,Wed Feb 25 04:41:12 2015 UTC,"I had this discussion a while ago. There are times shown where he sleeps for days and other times where he seems to go for a while. The best we could come up with is that he doesn't need to sleep like a normal person. As several people on her have said a theory of sleep is that it clears out junk in the mind, however his healing factor heals his mind as well as his body. Furthermore there are several health issues that arise from sleep deprivation. The best we could figure is that he can go for a while without sleeping and then after a while the effects of sleep deprivation will take its toll and slow his healing factor. So he could go for say a couple of weeks no sleep and his healing factor keeping the health issues at bay. He does his thing fights bad guys and then after a while the lack of sleep and all the fights tax his healing factor so he goes back to the Jean Grey School/Utopia/Xavier School/Avengers Tower and crashes for a few days and is then good to go.   This would also explain him being on so many teams. He can go so long without sleep that in the wee hours of the morning when the X-men aren't doing anything he gets bored (you can only watch early morning cable and drink for so long, trust me) and goes to help the Avengers. Then if they aren't busy he does X-force things (when he still ran X-force), then failing all that he goes on a random adventure on his own."
xmen,2x1w0d,ChurchBrimmer,3,Wed Feb 25 02:31:18 2015 UTC,I thought sleep was necessary to consolidate neuron pathways and sort of like... defrag your brain?

xmen,2x1kif,IAmLuckyDuckling,17,Tue Feb 24 22:41:53 2015 UTC,"Sort of. The belabored answer is that every Marvel universe has a designate. For instance the MCU is known as Earth-199999, the X-Men movies exist in Earth-10005, the original FF movies in Earth-121698, and the alternate reality that we assume the X-Men movies going forward will take place in Earth-TRN414 as this is a divergent reality from the rest of the film's continuity. TRN stands for ""temporary reality number"" which is a number that the Marvel Database assigns a reality without an official Earth-Number so as to better classify the myriad realities that have been seen only a handful of times and thus do not merit further classification by official sources.  As far as ""is there a name for that umbrella of films analogous to the MCU"" then no, there is to my knowledge not."

Honestly, the best thing to read after that is the X-Force series by Kyle/Yost/Crain. It doesn't follow the same characters, but since it's by the same writers that finished New X-Men it is a spiritual successor to New X-Men.

That's actually what got me into X-Men over the last couple years.   Another good starting place would be Giant-Size X-Men #1, and continue from X-Men #98 onwards. This is the start of Chris Claremont's classic run and introduces Storm, Wolverine, Colossus and Nightcrawler.  I also really recommend Rachel and Miles X-Plain the X-Men, it's a podcast basically covering X-Men from the start. http://www.rachelandmiles.com/xmen"

Several of them have individual series or miniseries that can explain some of the backstory."

Azazel was always the guy who snuck in to stab everybody in the back. In DoFP, however, it was a surprise attack conducted by the U.S. Military. It's probable that they were simply surprised and overwhelmed, regardless of powers.  I agree, though, that they could have had a better sendoff, but the inherent problem with X-Men films is that there are SO MANY characters in it. And most of them were used as cannon fodder in the future Sentinel scenes."

xmen,2wmbwi,FluffyBunbunKittens,3,Sat Feb 21 05:25:31 2015 UTC,"I guess that explains that Guardians of the Galaxy issue where Captain Marvel was on the cover, but she wasn't in the comic at all."
xmen,2wmbwi,psychoticapes,5,Sat Feb 21 10:48:26 2015 UTC,Covers get commissioned many months in advance. Bendis dragged out his Last Will arc much longer than originally planned which is why the covers and solicits don't match up.

xmen,2wkj0t,wellssh,2,Sat Feb 21 03:11:13 2015 UTC,"Did we mention Marvel Unlimited? lol  I like hard copies, and I just shopped around to find the cheapest options. If you don't mind black & white, the Essential Uncanny X-Men is pretty cheap. Sometimes you can find good deals on the Marvel Masterworks. Sometimes the trade paperback collections aren't too bad. I just got them used on Amazon and shopped around for deals. I'm also an Amazon seller so I can flip the ones I don't want to keep. You can also find some at the library.   But yeah, comics can get pretty expensive."
xmen,2wkj0t,Showbuckle,2,Fri Feb 20 19:10:19 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on what your preferred method of getting comics is.   Personally, I started (many many) years ago collecting magazines. A few back issues are very expensive, but you can get huge runs of x-men for peanuts on eBay.   As the cost of keeping up with the mags increased (most new release x-men running $4) and the number of titles increased (I think someone counted something near a dozen separate x-related ongoing), I switched to trades. Usually used trade paperbacks on amazon can be found for a couple bucks. The trades also store more neatly and display better on a shelf.   Finally an option that I have found myself checking more regularly: comixology. Every Monday and Friday there is a different marvel sale that has comics for $0.99. I've picked up a good number of x-men this way. App Synchs with phone and kindle so I can read in the john or on a plane.  Tl;dr back issues can be purchased in lots cheaply on eBay; used trade paperback bargains are on amazon; comixology has sales of digital comics twice a week."
xmen,2wkj0t,thermac,2,Sat Feb 21 04:43:31 2015 UTC,If you prefer to buy physical copies you can use  CheapGraphicNovels  and  InStockTrades  They usually have better prices than Amazon.
xmen,2wkj0t,TheDarkNightwing,1 point,Sat Feb 21 13:15:52 2015 UTC,You should check out Marvel Unlimited. It's like a Netflix for Marvel comics. They don't have all of their comics but their x-men selection is pretty extensive.

xmen,2wiivr,ClumsyG,14,Fri Feb 20 04:24:53 2015 UTC,"This issue sums up all of my frustrations with the X-Men right now. The forced ""schism"", the ""evil"" Scott Summers has committed, I mean where does it all come from?                         Malloy needs help, SHIELD is going to kill him because they find him too dangerous, and Storm sides with SHIELD? It's Malloy's fault for being a mutant? I understand that he is too powerful but in what wolrd do the X-Men turn away a mutant and side with the organization that was secretly building sentinels just 2 arcs ago?                             Also, can someone please explain just what Cyclops has done to make him so evil? I hated this issue so much."
xmen,2wiivr,GoldandBlue,5,Fri Feb 20 13:13:47 2015 UTC,"It would be sort of understandable if he was at all twisted or malicious with his powers. He wasn't even presented as a Proteus or anything. He was just mutant who had way too much dangerous power, and if anything he was the complete opposite of malacious with what he did with Professor X.  Bendis (and other recent writers too) really writes these characters as huge jerks whose main motivation is to overreact. I don't know if it's intentional in a way to give Scott sympathy or try paint him more ""villainous"", but it comes off as bad characterization nonetheless."
xmen,2wiivr,Fett02,4,Fri Feb 20 15:30:18 2015 UTC,"Right? These characters are completely unrecognizable. The Jean Grey School comes off so snooty and holier than though and it isnt even trying to make their issues justifiable. Cyclops is the de facto extremist because reasons. Its very frustrating that after all that, this id how it pays off.             We still dont know shit about triage or hijack BTW. Ben still doe as nt have a mutant name."
xmen,2wiivr,GoldandBlue,2,Fri Feb 20 19:25:59 2015 UTC,"What's really frustrating is that they got this really interesting premise in Scott adopting a more extreme agenda and starting his own school, then they dicked around for like two years of crossover tie-ins and filler while doing NOTHING with that premise. Scott has not, as of yet, done anything extreme or revolutionary besides be mean to SHIELD and show up on TV cameras. He hasnt actually backed up the rhetoric with action. His students got these big huge individual introductions and then just sort of shuffled around in the background until now, when they're being shooed off stage.  I was a huge fan of Bendis' Avengers run so I was psyched for this in the beginning, now I'm just waiting for it to be over so that shit can actually start happening again. I really feel like Bendis just has not had a plan at all this entire time."
xmen,2wiivr,GoldandBlue,1 point,Sun Feb 22 04:56:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like the most extreme thing Scott has done is say mutants should not tolerate hate. And that made him ""extreme"". It all feels forced. THere is no natyral conflict so they just pretended their was one."

xmen,2wiivr,FluffyBunbunKittens,2,Fri Feb 20 16:49:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely. Everyone is 'Scott has gonne madde!', while other people are doing absolutely much more bonkers shit. Them being butthurt over him killing Xavier while possessed would explain irrationally hating Scott (they knew Xavier, while everyone else their friends kill is a stranger), but not siding with mutant-killing SHIELD or...  It's so frustrating, since Scott going his own way and making his own school was an interesting development. Him giving up on that, especially because Bell does a Hank and fucks up all of timestream is just... Argh.  And I liked Bell when her power was a time bubble and she was a student. Being a Cyclops-threatening time goddess suddenly makes her seem to be quickly written off."

The origin of modern X-Men is with Giant Size #1 and Chris Claremont's 16 year run from 1975-1991, starting off with Storm, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, and Colossus, later adding Kitty Pryde and Rogue, etc.  This is an extremely helpful site: http://crushingkrisis.com/collecting-x-men-comic-books-as-graphic-novels/  If you want to skip around rather than reading every issue, here are my favorite story arcs, in chronological order:   Proteus (Uncanny 125-128) -- their first really dangerous enemy; I highly recommend the trade paperback which has some great additional stories Dark Phoenix Saga (Uncanny 129-137) -- widely considered the best ever, not my favorite though Days of Future Past (Uncanny 141-142) -- Kitty travels back in time from a dystopian future God Loves, Man Kills (graphic novel) -- possibly the best place for a newcomer to start The Brood Saga (Uncanny 154-158, 161-167) -- a mix of Alien & The Matrix, includes the first meeting of Magneto & Professor X (#161) and the first meeting of the X-men & Rogue Wolverine (Claremont/Miller limited series 1-4) -- the first Wolverine comics, must-read From the Ashes (Uncanny 168-176) -- one of Joss Whedon's favorite runs; Wolverine's wedding; Rogue joins the X-Men; Storm gets a mohawk Havok & Wolverine: Meltdown (limited series 1-4) -- highly recommended, great artwork X-Treme X-Men: Mekanix -- must-read for Kitty Pryde fans. Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men run 1-24 (the Warren Ellis run after this is also good). The Whedon run also has an amazing motion comic partially available on Netflix. Rick Remender's Uncanny X-Force"

xmen,2we8au,nicktheman2,1 point,Sun Feb 22 17:37:49 2015 UTC,X-Treme X-Men: Mekanix -- must-read for Kitty Pryde fans.   Do have any recommendations for other Kitty Pryde centric runs? I've read Days of Future Past and Joss's run on Astonishing X-Men and I've got copies of the Kitty Pryde And Wolverine and Kitty Pryde: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. miniseries. What else am I missing?
xmen,2we8au,apocalypsenowandthen,2,Thu Feb 19 17:31:08 2015 UTC,"The initial run of Uncanny that she's in, God Loves Man Kills, From the Ashes. Claremont does some interesting stuff with her in X-Men Forever. Other than that I'm not really sure."

xmen,2we8au,apocalypsenowandthen,2,Fri Feb 20 06:38:14 2015 UTC,"There is a beginning (see the sidebar).  Back the 60's you'll find a pretty corny group of superheroes.  The old comics are worth the read for historical interest, but they are not as compelling as newer comics.    Unless (like me) you just can't get enough X-Men there is no need to read from the first issue.  It would be a bit like getting all 50 seasons of General Hospital and sitting down to watch them in order. It not needed to understand what is currently going on with series.    I would approach it as a soap.  If you're having fun with the current season, keep watching.  Turn to the sidebar and in your free time pick up a ""classic"" season or two from the past to give yourself a bit of backstory.    I would not start at the beginning of the sidebar and try to keep reading until the present series."

xmen,2we8au,BustahWoruff,1 point,Thu Feb 19 04:26:38 2015 UTC,"To be honest, you may prefer a more modern starting place since you aren't familiar with the older comics at all.

xmen,2we8au,AncientSwordRage,1 point,Fri Feb 20 08:02:18 2015 UTC,"I suggest you start with X-Men - Season One a remake of there origins. Then X-Men First class. These are some great stories about the first group of x-men.  Then I suggest Giant-Size X-Men & Uncanny X-Men #94-110. This is the start of the second x-men.  Then I would suggest, Days of Future Past, Dark Phoenix, Brood Sega and God Loves, Man Kills.  After I suggest Wolverines first series, only 4 issues. Next Fall of the Mutants, Mutant Massacre and X-Cutioners Song.  Then a Age of Apoclypse, Grant Morrison's New X-Men, Joss Wheadon's Asthonishing X-Men and House of M.  After that Decimation, Messiah Complex, Second Coming and Schism.  AvsX + Battle of the atom + current All-New and Uncanny X-Men to understand the current X-Men.  also great are Old Man Logan, Megneto Testament and current Deadpool."

xmen,2wbrmi,sapi3nce,1 point,Thu Feb 19 23:06:46 2015 UTC,YES.
xmen,2wd2tl,Poseiden9221,5,Wed Feb 18 22:30:17 2015 UTC,This is just how Bendis breaks his toys so nobody else can play with them.
xmen,2wd2tl,TentacleOni,4,Thu Feb 19 10:25:39 2015 UTC,"Well we don't know for sure that the mutant was never ever born. Still I agree, all that buildup for what?   Really have had it with Storm and Iceman. Some people were impressed with how Eva told Cyclops off. That's some grade A bullshit. She knows nothing about the situation. She's abusing her power. But then Xavier knew all of that.   Remember that AVX still happened. This X-men story was never ever during or post Axis. This was always prior.   I just can't stand the Cyclops hate. It simply makes no sense."
xmen,2wd2tl,neoblackdragon,3,Thu Feb 19 00:41:46 2015 UTC,"Eva deciding that she can go back in time and change history on a whim has made her 1000x more dangerous than Cyclops ever was.  Her warning to Scott at the end was so hypocritical.    Also I agree about Storm, she has been just awful for months now."
xmen,2wd2tl,whiskeybill,3,Thu Feb 19 02:54:01 2015 UTC,"Storm's been ok in other books. It's just the terrible Bendis writing that makes her seem nutty, but that applies to most of the other characters as well."
xmen,2wd2tl,Jumbledcode,2,Thu Feb 19 11:44:50 2015 UTC,Yeah Storm in these comics seems pretty damn militant. Even her treatment of Colossus was insane.
xmen,2wd2tl,neoblackdragon,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:45:49 2015 UTC,Her logic is much better in her own comic.  Hopefully the new Uncanny team will pick up on that.
xmen,2wd2tl,sapi3nce,2,Thu Feb 19 23:02:55 2015 UTC,"So in the new history, Xavier didn't marry Mystique? Feels like there was an awful lot of buildup just to wave a hand and undo it all."
xmen,2wd2tl,Zeus_Wayne,2,Thu Feb 19 00:29:26 2015 UTC,no fallout from AXIS   Will be handled next issue. Bendis said this arc ran an issue past when he planned it to end and the cover/solicits were already set in stone and couldn't be changed.
xmen,2wd2tl,soulreaverdan,2,Thu Feb 19 07:51:35 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm constantly getting beaten over the head with the 'Cyclops is evil!' propaganda.  Nobody seems to remember that the majority of AvX would never have happened (and Xavier probably wouldn't have been killed) if Tony Stark hadn't tried to blow up the damn Phoenix (not to mention Logan being a backstabbing turncoat, but I digress).  I get that several years have passed for Eva Bell in the interim of 1-2 issues, but her character shift seems pretty drastic and forced.  She can not only suddenly control her time travel with pinpoint accuracy, but she also suddenly talks down to Cyclops like he's nothing, where does that come from?  She hasn't even been around that long.  That entire dialogue seemed to come out of nowhere.  And how are the X-Men still putting Xavier on a pedestal when he's willing to use time travel and telepathy to uncreate someone?  That's just as bad as what McCoy did with the ANXM, just as bad as what Logan and Sue Richards attempted in Age of Ultron.  I like the premise of this arc but the characterization seemed poorly done.  Not crazy about using time travel as a plot device either but whatever."
xmen,2wd2tl,Wolff_Laarcen,3,Thu Feb 19 01:13:48 2015 UTC,"Cyclops is evil only because we have to hear over and over from the other X-Men that he is.  His actions aren't evil, hes just trying to help mutants.  Its just shitty writing, if Scott is supposed to be evil then show me why.  Don't just keep having Storm, Iceman and Beast whine about how bad Cyclops is."
xmen,2wd2tl,whiskeybill,2,Thu Feb 19 02:57:12 2015 UTC,"It's not shitty writing. Cyclops isn't evil, most Marvel writers have echoed this sentiment. People are mad at him, and he doesn't give enough of a shit to try to convince them otherwise anymore, he knows he can't do that. He's an Outlaw, and he killed someone very important to everyone he cares about. The other X-Men are too wrapped up in their own issues and hardships to really understand or forgive him for what wasn't really his fault.   Most of the X-Men don't think he's evil. Bobby kinda does, and Logan thinks he needs to get the shit kicked out of him, but the rest of them just feel betrayed are are understandably upset with him for how little they understand anything he's trying to do, so they perceive him as a threat to the X-Men's ideals of generating public support for mutants.   And they're kinda right. Cyclops is my favorite fictional character, but he's spiraling hard right now and trying to be what he thinks is the most helpful he can to mutants, but he's not taking care of himself and he can't keep this up for long."
xmen,2wd2tl,Now_you_fucked_up,0,Thu Feb 19 20:08:47 2015 UTC,They did show how he was evil. Remember when he declared his mutant revolution that so far has only caused Shield to deploy Sentinels(they bought to kill mutants and other metahumans).
xmen,2wd2tl,neoblackdragon,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:41:27 2015 UTC,"SHIELD's actions are on Scott's shoulders now? His declaration caused them to whip up sentinels of their own in two weeks, as opposed to having had them ready to go whenever their nazi asses felt the need for them?  Okay."
xmen,2wd2tl,FluffyBunbunKittens,1 point,Sat Feb 21 05:30:39 2015 UTC,Well the X-men know nothing about Xavier role in this. Actually I don't understand why she brought him to the future. He did everything in the past anyway without Cyclops teams help.
xmen,2wd2tl,neoblackdragon,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:40:14 2015 UTC,"Haha, you're right.  There really was no reason to bring him to the present.  The only reason I can think of would be to show him first hand how bad things are but he can read minds so he already knows whats happening."
xmen,2wd2tl,whiskeybill,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:11:28 2015 UTC,"I can't believe Storm (my favourite character) tried to fry Matthew Malloy with her lightning.....she's usually written to be smarter than that. Other than that, what a great issue!!!  I'm curious to see how all of the X-men integrate together now.  They've been separated for so long!!   Also, I wonder what Scott will get upto.  How very unlike Scott to take off and wallow in misery after something goes wrong.  Oh, wait a second..."
xmen,2wd2tl,sapi3nce,1 point,Thu Feb 19 00:56:34 2015 UTC,Cyclops wallowing off?  That's the only bit of writing that make any damn sense. Hell they currently make a comicbook about it. Maybe he needs to spend some time in space away from all this madness. He doesn't need a new awesome kid to make. I'm thinking Half Skrull Half mutant. Maybe Gladiator has a sister.
xmen,2wd2tl,neoblackdragon,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:48:24 2015 UTC,"HAhahah I appreciate your frustration and understand it.  Some other things I liked from this issue:  I kind of liked Eva's rise to super-ultra-powerful mutant...she effectively defeated Matthew (the strongest mutant on the planet)?  I didn't see that coming at all.  It was also nice to have Professor X back, however briefly.  Most of all, I'm excited that the two schools finally came together!  The X-men are back baby!!  PS as annoying as Scott was in the past, he recently really became awesome, so I hope the writers don't pull another ""wallow away in misery"" story line out of their asses...."
xmen,2wd2tl,sapi3nce,1 point,Thu Feb 19 23:01:37 2015 UTC,"I'm just hoping this puts them on the path to finally ending the schism. Of course they will only make up and kiss once they are all needed in the big world ending event (I mean they should right?)  I enjoyed Eva's development, and I'm sure there will be some follow up with her to deal with Hank McCoy. What I am very happy about is Xavier went back to his own time. I was so scared that he would get ""stuck"" in the present also. I'm not really surprised with how things went down, I mean you can't just kill off cyc, emma, storm and not expect some time traveling resolution to fix it all.   I'm more or less happy this arc is done and am excited to read about axis fallout and their role in secret wars."
xmen,2wd2tl,Donglovernotafighter,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:55:41 2015 UTC,Well Emma could have been put back together. Storm lived I think. Cyke and his gf(really that's what she practically is now) could have been brought back a non time travel way.
xmen,2wd2tl,neoblackdragon,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:09:03 2015 UTC,"The message at Xavier school even said that they were all dead, I'm not sure how Emma would be put back together. I'm sure there's a mutant out there that could do that. Maybe Triage. Also I just reread it and Storm's face was completely in half. But none of it matters they are all alive and well now. Sorry you're upset about all the cyke hate. I'm hoping this is the turning point for that."
xmen,2wd2tl,Donglovernotafighter,1 point,Thu Feb 19 20:43:37 2015 UTC,the turning point was when he got that new badass red costume and learned to harness his beam a little better.  Since then he's declined backed to mediocrity...

For the most part, unless it's based on a cartoon, or has the word Ultimate in the title, Marvel's stuff is all the same course of events. (At least for now) It pretty much goes like this...  The Phoenix in The Phoenix Saga wasn't actually Jean. Everyone thought it was Jean, but it was the Phoenix Force itself made up to believe it was Jean, that's why it went nuts, turned evil, then eventually killed itself.   Then a few years later we all find out that the real Jean had been sitting at the bottom of Jamaica Bay. She comes back, gets the band back together (the original five X-Men slummed around as the X-Factor for a number of years) then they go back home to the X-Mansion (X-Men #1, Uncanny X-Men #281). Jean was just Jean for a while, having the telepathy/telekinesis that we all know and love from the 90s animated series, then slowly as the years went by she started to show more and more power. Eventually she started going by the name Phoenix again, which starts to freak everyone out. That get's you to the point you're at now."

xmen,2w9qrz,WampaCountry,3,Wed Feb 18 13:20:08 2015 UTC,They really wanted to use New X-men as a jumping off point for people who didn't necessarily know all of the x-men lore so there are bits of what seem to be extraneous exposition especially early on.   Morrison makes the phoenix aspect of jean more prominent as an elemental force instead of just a power source like it had been for a while. So all of the changes she's experiencing are new even though the phoenix being a part of her is a really old idea.  Someone who read more 90s x-men please feel free to correct me on what happened before New X-Men.

xmen,2wavdf,wellssh,1 point,Thu Feb 19 13:03:45 2015 UTC,"""where to start"" is actually a kind of tough question.  The answer I always want to give is ""at the beginning"" --and that is where the sidebar starts.  Following the sidebar down from Tomorrow's Brightest to Proteus to Dark Phoenix etc would make a lot of sense.    But you mentioned that you didn't like the older comics. And as much as I love them, the really early comics are more corny than compelling.  So here's my slightly abbreviated and annotated sidebar list:  start here    Dark Phoenix Saga -- this is really the start of modern X-Men storytelling: compelling and not corny.  Days of Future Past -- So much better than the movie (and the movie was good!)  Wolverine (in Japan) -- Single biggest development of Wolverine's character Mutant Massacre --  First time I ever cried at a comic book Inferno -- Scott, Madelyn, Sinister what a soap opera!  Mutant Genesis -- Launch of the companion title.  Age of Apocalypse -- Read to be prepared for what is shaping up to be a great movie   Or, Start Here    New X-Men This relaunches X-comic books in a really cinematic way.  The storytelling feels contemporary and compelling Astonishing X-Men -- Takes cinematic storytelling and ratchets it up a notch.  Excellent reading.  House of M -- Current events in the monthlies are in some ways still touched by this event.   Messiah Complex -- Birth of the first mutants since M day.  Utopia -- The military compound  Second Coming -- Puts the Cable/Scott/Hope family dynamic at work Schism -- the split in Xavier's dream of protecting mutantkind/educating the future.  Avengers vs. X-Men -- epic battle scenes and really shows how deep the schism is.  Battle of the Atom -- The current and very extended back to the future plot begins here"

xmen,2w8v67,fgggr,1 point,Thu Feb 19 20:07:18 2015 UTC,"Schism is a pretty bad storyline.   It's basically the result of Marvel wanting their cake and eating it too, by which I mean that they wanted to keep the Utopia setting but also bring back the school.  To carry the other side they needed a popular character, and who's more popular than Wolverine? So despite the fact that Wolverine has always been a fan of tossing kids into the fray and, you know, murdering people, he suddenly launched an anti-violence crusade on behalf of kids that didn't ask for it.  What's even worse is that the entire foundation for the schism story doesn't really make any sense.  The reason Wolverine wants to take the kids away and start up the school again is primarily because he:  a) Thinks the children aren't safe on Utopia, and would be safer at the school.   b) Feels it is wrong that the kids be forced to participate in active combat.  But neither of these are true. The kids aren't safer at the school. There's a reason the X-Men left the school in the first place. Because it got destroyed on a regular basis, and because a bussload of kids were killed there by humans without the X-Men able to do anything about it.   Utopia is an island stronghold guarded by some of the most powerful people on the planet. Think of what they've endured there; a vampire invasion, undead mutants invading, super-charged Juggernaut, a Nimrod army led by Bastion, the Dark Avengers, and so on.   As for the kids being forced to participate in combat, again, that's not true. No one is forced to fight. The kids want to fight. There were loads of non-combatant civilians living on Utopia. There were even former supervillains who were allowed to live there and enjoy the X-Men's protection without actually having to fight. Hell, the event that triggers the schism and pisses Wolverine off only happens because Wolverine was out drinking instead of doing his job.   So yeah, Schism tries to weave a story where two sides are equally right and wrong, yet straight off the bat makes one position's side indefensible, and makes the person leading that side a massive hypocrite. It's a badly made story no matter how you spin it."
xmen,2w8v67,Garntus,1 point,Wed Feb 18 15:51:10 2015 UTC,Also in Wolverine and the X-men. The kids do nothing but fight for their lives. Yeah Wolverine doesn't take them out into combat situation like any regular X-men team.........but then that doesn't stop all the bad guys from going to the school.  Cyclops team with the Xavier school actually see's far less combat.  Wolverine school actually has the more powerful and better trained combat team.  Cyclops team is actually composed of stealth and support. In a straight up fight without Eva bitchy Bell. They would lose if their psychics were disabled. They have actually seen far less attacks on their own turf. The only assault was by Wolverine kids from the future.
xmen,2w8v67,neoblackdragon,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:05:13 2015 UTC,"Schism is a good storyline. It really articulates what the two (antagonistic) groups of X-Men are going to stand for.  Schism is best read after House of M and before AvX.    Schism and Kieron Gillen's run on Uncanny X-Men really lay the groundwork for AvX.  If you're interested in AvX, start with Schism.    My only complaint is the ""domesticizing"" Wolverine.  He went from cigar smokin' cursing broody man who will fight for you in the foxhole to something more like grumpy schoolteacher"
xmen,2w8v67,wellssh,1 point,Wed Feb 18 00:41:54 2015 UTC,Honestly I kinda liked what they did with Wolverine.  He actually made some progress as a character and took on some real responsibility when he saw that no one else was going to do it.
xmen,2w8v67,whiskeybill,1 point,Thu Feb 19 02:59:04 2015 UTC,"Responsibility? Cyclops did plenty of that.   I like what they did with him as long as it had nothing to do with the ""I Hate Scott Summers group""."
xmen,2w4yi0,JohnFuckingSmith,7,Tue Feb 17 00:29:14 2015 UTC,I think this next film is the perfect time to introduce Cable onto film.
xmen,2w4yi0,SMB73,4,Tue Feb 17 01:50:37 2015 UTC,"Age of Apocalypse is a perfect opportunity to introduce his character. He was created by Mr. Sinister specifically to combat Apocalypse. He spent his entire childhood and most of his young adult years fighting Apocalypse with the Askani in the future, and traveled back into the past as an adult to preserve the timeline.  Of course the movie's narrative has to be diluted, and yet his character as ""a time traveler from the future to help protect the past with ties to the Summers bloodline"" is sufficient. Even discounting all of that, he can still be established as ""the protagonist to Apocalypse's antagonism"" for the general audiences. Maybe a short scene or two in the Deadpool movie, and then from there lead into the X-Force movie with Cable in the lead."
xmen,2w4yi0,Helmet_Icicle,2,Tue Feb 17 11:32:01 2015 UTC,I forgot Stryfe (hiding out in his head) gave him a goatee.
xmen,2w4yi0,SuffocatingNostalgia,2,Tue Feb 17 10:26:32 2015 UTC,"Watching the 90s cartoons, I was a huge Cable fan. I for one will bust a nut if he's introduced in the next film! I've been waiting so long for a live adaptation of him. But the casting has to be perfect for a character like this to work."
xmen,2w4yi0,kingkhan13,5,Tue Feb 17 16:03:25 2015 UTC,"Cable is tough because he's so complicated. He's SUPER powerful. He's got Telekinesis AND he's a Telepath- super rare, but he has a techno-virus from consuming him that he was infected with as a child, so they sent him to the future where they would have a cure? But they didn't have a cure, they just taught him to control it so now he's only half as powerful as he could be from his TK, but has super healing and strength feats now. He was really created from DNA from Jean and Scott by Mr. Sinister, and if I remember right, is the reason Apocalypse is eternal. Because Cable is a time-traveler.   I love Cable a lot, but it almost seems like with his ridiculous story that he could be better as a TV show or a mini-series. Maybe a Deadpool & Cable series!?! Hahaha a fanboy can dream...   edit: and I forgot to mention he's been at war literally his entire life, from the point he got infected to when he grew up and became the chosen one. His entire life is battle and he's a hard mother fucker with a heart of gold just trying to ensure a good future for the world."

xmen,2w4yi0,WorkingReddit,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:04:21 2015 UTC,"I agree that he's overcomplicated, but I think he can be winnowed down enough to make him simple enough for a movie without losing what makes him Cable. Just make him Scott and Jean's kid from the future (forget about Madelyne Pryor and Sinister) and just say he's been at war with Apocalypse his whole life. He's got telekinesis (I actually can't remember him using telepathy any time in the last 15 years or so of comics) as his mutant power. His eye and metal arm can just be technology-based (due to injuries or something)."
xmen,2w4yi0,Magnusblitz,2,Wed Feb 18 01:17:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge Cable fan, but he could be interesting in the film universe.  Unfortunately, I don't think Scott and Jean (nevermind Madelyne) have ever really been given enough (or any worthwhile) character development to make Cable meaningful, unless he's just a random character like Quicksilver in DOFP.  Then again, AoA could be more Scott- and Jean-centic, which could introduce Cable as a viable character in the following movie."

Huge musclebound man?  Check.  Excessively large gun way too big to wield in battle?  Check.  Plenty of pouches?  Check and check.  These people are wrong though because Cable is freaking awesome."
xmen,2w4yi0,TragicEther,2,Tue Feb 17 04:58:27 2015 UTC,"Since you seem to be a big Cable fan, maybe you can answer my question;  Because Madeline Pryor is a clone created by Mr Sinister, is her son Nathan Summers named after his 'grandfather' Nathaniel Essex?"
xmen,2w4yi0,Helmet_Icicle,2,Tue Feb 17 14:51:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was like a post-hypnotic suggestion from Sinister or something along those lines.

xmen,2w4yi0,1RedOne,1 point,Tue Feb 17 09:21:12 2015 UTC,"He could now, but In the early days he pretty much never used his TK, as it was needed to combat the much more virulent techno organic virus he had when his character was new.   Sure, he's such a beastly telepath that he can maintain an island hovering for months at a time, or conduct one to one telepathy with everyone in the world when be isn't sick. The whole reason he had the virus was to restrict his abilities."

xmen,2vxh0y,ClumsyG,29,Sun Feb 15 01:21:38 2015 UTC,"Absolute bollocks.  Even with All New X-Factor and X-Force ending, there are still five X-Men books (All-New, Uncanny, (adjectiveless), Amazing, and Spider-Man and the), Uncanny Avengers and The Wolverines (which are kind of nebulous, but related titles using X-Franchise characters), and four X-solo books (Storm, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, and Magneto).  Which puts the total for X-Men character books at eleven.  I'm not sure how many Avengers, Cosmic, or Spider titles there are, but maintaining ten monthlies and a weekly is not a sign of trying to strangle a franchise.  Also, the next big event for X-men is an event that ended in December?  Also, did the author just blank out any mention of X-Men involvement in recently completed Axis, current Black Vortex, or upcoming Secret Wars events?  Moreover, shortly after announcing a deal to write exclusively for Marvel, G. Willow Wilson (of Ms. Marvel fame) announced she'd be writing an arc on adjectiveless.    I mean, obviously, there's been a shift toward an Avengers-centric focus for Marvel, because (as was mentioned clearly in the article) that's where Marvel gets its best returns.  They're not using corporate double-speak to hide a secret agenda to sabotage one of their tent-pole franchises, they just don't want to put a lot of effort into making a pie that they have to give pieces away when they could be spending that time making a pie that they keep to themselves.    But the idea that Marvel is trying to bury the X-Men is ridiculous and would be cutting off their nose to spite their face.  All-New X-Men and Uncanny X-Men are frequently in Marvel's top selling books in any given month (usually doing around 55-60K).  They might as well bury the Spider-Man franchise while they're at it."

BUT they're not going to use the existing franchise to bring Spidy in.  It's going to be all new, and I have faith in the Marvel movie system based on what they've done so far.    FF could come to Marvel as well and it'll be OK.  X-Men and mutants on the other hand would ruin both worlds.

Not to mention the New Mutants team that started Civil War. Without the X-Men, there would be no Civil War."
xmen,2vjg5s,Zthe27th,2,Thu Feb 12 08:59:22 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to think you haven't read Civil War. The Super human registration act and the mutant ones were very different, the Civil War one was about government oversight into heroes, the Mutant one was about registering US citizens based on a factor of their birth. Because of M-Day just happening the X-Men noped right out of supporting either side because at that point the government already knew who all the mutants were, all 198 of them. And it was the New Warriors who caused all the problems in Stanford that lead to the Civil War starting."
xmen,2vjg5s,codexcdm,2,Thu Feb 12 11:39:40 2015 UTC,"Funny enough, it was good for Marvel to not have their top dogs for the movie ventures. Really, would Guardians of the Galaxy be a thing at all if Spiderman and X-Men were made by Marvel Studios? Nope. A solo Ant-Man movie wouldn't be in the cards... and Inhumans would be a no-go too. I'd venture to say a solo Iron Man might not even get greenlit; he wasn't nearly as popular before the movies after all.  Marvel simply would have went the safe routes, stuck to Spiderman, X-Men. The Hulk, and maybe throw in an Avengers team film. But the various solo films, the whole Avengers Initiative, and these Phases for the films? I'd say doubtful.  I'd say we'd be seeing Spiderman and Wolverine in the Avengers: Part 2 next year, rather than something like Age of Ultron.  I'd still be weary of Marvel having X-Men and Spidey again only on the account that eventually... they could very well just go the safe route, not venture into lesser known properties like they did with Guardians, and soon Ant-Man and Inhumans. Maybe in a few years, they can reach some sort of agreement that lets Mutants and the X-Men be used, but not be soooo prominent they take over the MCU."

I get the feeling that Malloy could be an incarnation of the son of Rachel Summers and Franklin Richards. The X-men are full of refugees from the future. The Summers' family is known for having its' progeny transported back and forth through space and time. Cyclops' connection to Matthew Malloy (besides both conspicuously having alliterative names) is definitely significant to his inception as a character."

But she really nailed that role. I think Sophie Turner can really use this role to her advantage if she goes all out in it (as long as there is a script there for her).   In terms of appearance, give her a perm with big curls, some physical training and superhero poses beyond Victorian-style Puritanism and repression, and we could see the Jean Grey we all know and love."

Ugh. Get back with Gambit already.   And now my true geek is showing."
xmen,2vi7uc,uebersoldat,4,Wed Feb 11 23:26:23 2015 UTC,The movies work because 1) they are good entertaining films 2) because they get the spirit of the X-Men even if they don't get the characterization perfect. The X-Men are really a Sunday school lesson about equality dressed up in superhero's and the movies have hit that home every single time.
xmen,2vi7uc,Zthe27th,10,Thu Feb 12 12:20:36 2015 UTC,"First thing. Marvel is owned by Disney. Disney is not making the movies. Think of it like the NFL and the 49ers. Yes the 49ers are part of the NFL, but they operate entirely on their own. Marvel, Pixar, and Lucasfilm are owned by Disney but they operate entirely on their own. I know that is not what you are asking but It is something that annoys me. I do not want X-Men to get the ""Disney Treatment"".             As for the movies. You have to remember that X-Men pretty much kicked off the modern superhero movie genre. Yes it is dated but at the time the only competition was Richard Donner's Superman and Tim Burton's Batman. X2 was a really good movie. Was it a good X-Men movie? Meh. But a good movie. People need to understand the difference. They existed in a time when spandex was seen as corny, studio execs were not sure if audiences would even care to see a superhero movie not named Batman or Superman. It was a very different world.                                  You also need to understand the world where Fox is coming from. They had created this world before Marvel and exist after Marvel. So they have to try and marry the two different worlds while still making sense of the world they created. They love Hugh Jackman, he is a great Wolverine, he is a box office draw, and they will milk that until they no longer can. Because of that they can't do a First Class with Cyclops, Jean, Bobby, Angel, and Beast because in that universe they would be either infants or not born yet.           While I agree with some of your points X-Men First Class, while lacking the characters we love, definitely captured the spirit of the X-Men better than any movie before. The message, the ideology, the camaraderie, etc. The same can be said for DOFP, plus that was not only a very good movie but when you think about what it intended to do, really only makes it more impressive. Trying to create a band-aid between the classic X-Men films and a more modern take that is closer to the comics.                              So I understand that you do not like that they are not like the comics but they are not the comics. Think of movies like an alternate universe. It as adaptation. Even Iron Man and Avengers are not like the comics. I do agree that outside of Wolverine, Magneto, and Xavier, the rest of the X-Men are caricatures at best. It is hard to create fully realized characters in a 2 hour movie when you have a team of that size. Some characters will suffer. A lot of characters have suffered in X-Men. (do not get me started on Cyclops)                                        Movies and comics are two different things. It can be hard to separate the two. I love movies and comics. I can watch First Class and DOFP and appreciate how good they are as films, but also have issues with their take on these characters I love. If it makes you feel better, they are trying. Odds are Apocalypse will be the closest to the comics of any X-Men movie. Does that mean it will make a good movie? I hope so, but it's not a guarantee."
xmen,2vi7uc,GoldandBlue,-1,Wed Feb 11 07:52:14 2015 UTC,That end sequence in DOFP was so weak. Beast in the car and the sentinel and wolverine. I wanted wolvie and beast to go full on berserker mode on a bunch of sentinels.
xmen,2vi7uc,Nfgzebrahed,7,Wed Feb 11 09:30:44 2015 UTC,"Because the movie was not about Wolverine. It was about Charles and Magneto's ideologies clashing, and the clash being embodied by Mystique. Wolverine was just a vehicle to drive the story, he was no longer needed in the climax. I get that you want to see Beast and Wolverine show off their powers but it wouldn't make story wise. It would just be gratuitous action for no reason."
xmen,2vi7uc,GoldandBlue,1 point,Wed Feb 11 09:34:24 2015 UTC,"I would have been fine with almost NO wolverine.  Why does every xmen film have to be propelled by wolverine and mystique?

I wanted sentinels dropping down seemingly overwhelming the team in that stadium, and only through leadership and teamwork are they able to overcome.  The xmen are a family.

The average viewer doesn't know bishop or blink or warpath, so they like it because action and cgi, but I'd rather be emotionally invested.

xmen,2vi7uc,Nfgzebrahed,3,Thu Feb 12 13:42:16 2015 UTC,"When comparing comics to movies, I try to see them as two distinct entities that overlap at points. Very few comic book movies are 100% accurate to the source material, so let it go. You have to look at the movies, the stories they are telling, and how they are going about things.  The X-Men films definitely suffer quite a bit when compared to the comics. Wolverine is not the same character he is in the comics, and on top of that he is the focal point. That's where the films fall apart for me as a viewer. Even their version of Wolverine, as charming as Hugh Jackman is, isn't appealing to me as a focal character.  I've never been adequately pulled into that world. Well, not until First Class, which stands quite strongly as a film on its own. Making the Xavier/Magneto relationship the focal point and exploring that was a long overdue concept for the series with very well realized characters, thanks in part to the fact that the cast was relatively small."
xmen,2vi7uc,GospelX,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:14:35 2015 UTC,Had the story just been about them it would have worked but the fact it was also suppose to be the story of how the xmen first form ruined the movie for me.  Everyone has valid points to hate this movie. If you're not going to try to follow the source material why even call it xmen. Why not make your own hero movie ala chronical.
xmen,2vi7uc,mike1883,2,Thu Feb 12 01:25:11 2015 UTC,"The cynical response: Because linking it to something that already exists brings in more viewers and thus more money. It's not just an action story. It's an X-Men story. (See the twist there? It's not a story based on X-Men comics. It's a story based on X-Men characters!)  The classical response: Early storytelling involved telling the same tales with different characters or new tales with the same characters, but there was no regard to the type of canon that fans worship in the modern age. People used to appreciate tales for what they were and/or for the abilities presented by the storytellers.  The pragmatic response: Well, just don't bother with adaptations then. Changes are always made because certain things don't film well or because the people involved just have a different vision. If you want to just stick with the original vision, stick to the comics. (And even then things get retconned, changed, etc.)"
xmen,2vi7uc,GospelX,1 point,Thu Feb 12 02:42:01 2015 UTC,I don't want them to do every little thing I actually liked the guy they got to play Trask. I'm just saying  a little more details into the fight scenes or designs of the charcters. What can I say I want it all.
xmen,2vi7uc,mike1883,2,Thu Feb 12 02:56:25 2015 UTC,"I've argued these very same points many times, to the point where I have pretty much given up.

xmen,2vi7uc,raysweater,6,Thu Feb 12 00:54:55 2015 UTC,I completely agree. What baffles me the most is the art direction. With such a huge budget they manage to make beast and blink for instance worse than some cosplay i`ve seen.
xmen,2vi7uc,The0racle,2,Wed Feb 11 05:50:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  I was just thinking about it myself.  Here's our character rundown:  There have been 4 main characters in the movies: Wolverine, Xavier, Magneto, and Mystique.     Wolverine's just become way too overexposed Xavier was never an interesting character (except maybe when he was trying to atone in his Legacy run) Mystique has always just sorta been whatever the writer wants her to be in any context Magneto is the only consistently interesting character of the 4.     Then there's all the rest:   Cyclops was a little bitch Jean's Phoenix arc was totally botched Iceman was essentially Bella from Twilight (No personality, but still 2 girls fighting over him) Rogue's a little bitch. Storm was a placeholder character that shot lightning every now and then Kelsey Grammer's Beast was great but underutilized. Holt's Beast is a generic nerd Warren Worthington was a ridiculous addition to X3. Cut him out entirely and it doesn't change a damn thing in the movie. Colossus got 3 lines in 3 movies Kitty Pryde was a plot device Pretty much all the First Class mutants, good and bad, were totally expendable. I have to really strain to remember them doing anything in the movies. Nightcrawler and Quicksilver each got one scene where they kicked a ton of ass, and that's it.    The list continues, but as you said, pretty much everyone else got butchered.  X-men was always supposed to be an ensemble work (hence, X-Men), so having at most 4 characters in focus, only 1 of which works, is kind of super weak. And there were so many unnecessary changes. Why is Moira a cop who's not Scottish? Her only 2 defining characteristics were she was Scottish and a scientist. Why is the first class a bunch of no-names and Beast?  I mean, the films are at fault as much for doing things wrong as they are for just not doing things right.  Anyways, thanks for letting me vent."

xmen,2vi7uc,TragicEther,4,Thu Feb 12 01:07:44 2015 UTC,I completely agree.  I would pay so much money to see an X-Men film that is a 'coming together' film of the original five teenagers.

xmen,2vi7uc,witchsbrew,1 point,Sat Feb 21 00:39:05 2015 UTC,I am right there with you. I enjoyed the fight scenes in DOFP but every point you make I completely agree with. First Class was garbage and I don't think any of the characters were really interesting other than Magneto. The Hellfire Club was a joke.
xmen,2vi7uc,mike1883,1 point,Wed Feb 11 16:30:39 2015 UTC,Emma Frost look like a bimbo. She should have been a big player in the movie. She's a whole lot more powerful than Mystique.

xmen,2vi68r,number3LFC,1 point,Wed Feb 11 04:53:14 2015 UTC,"House of M would be a good spot to start as it leads into the whole 198 thing.  Then you can read the Decimation storyline and related books, such as Generation M and The 198, and the regular uncanny/wolverine/xfactor/xmen/etc books.  After that hit up Endangered Species. If you still want more you can continue the storylines in their release order as it's a plotline that's carried for quite a while."
xmen,2vi68r,SpeakFriendAndEnter,1 point,Wed Feb 11 07:19:56 2015 UTC,"I just finished reading Civil War and all the tie-ins (which took forever), so here's what I read immediately after:   Remender's X-Force run New Age of Apocalypse The last two runs of Wolverine so I could see some big events for him Uncanny Avengers (some X-Men team up with some Avengers under a weird Havok/Cap dual leadership) Uncanny X-Men up to the latest on Marvel Unlimited Battle of the Atom The latest Astonishing X-Men run The present and previous adjectiveless X-Men runs All New X-Men Wolverine and the X-Men   I think that's it. The X-Force stuff was my favorite, but the AoA was a slog to get through. Uncanny Avengers ain't half bad. Love the present day Uncanny X-Men stuff. I'd also read Runaways if you haven't yet. Especially before BotA, just for bonus...um...stuff. Don't worry about it."

xmen,2v7f2b,Mevansuto,5,Sun Feb 8 17:16:28 2015 UTC,X-Factor is amazing and well worth reading the complete run.  New X-Men is also pretty good as it shows how the students at the school react to M-Day and it's fallout.

It was one of my favorite fan fic's way back when because it explored some of the political elements of a Mutant Nation in a way Marvel would never have the ability to attempt.

xmen,2v0zsy,captainpostal,4,Sat Feb 7 11:28:52 2015 UTC,"Well, perfect world the rights go back to Marvel and they take control. I'm not sure I want another Phoenix saga. Remember we already saw Jean in the future happy, healthy, and free. Her killing tons of people doesn't seem to mesh with that.  Personally I hope Magneto is the one who vanquishes Apocalypse. And him being the leader of Genosha but getting too over zealous and doing Magneto things, eventually having to be stopped by the X-Men would be the best. I know the X v. Mags has been done to death, but the movies are at their best when Fassbender takes a lead role."
xmen,2v0zsy,ThreeHourRiverMan,1 point,Sat Feb 7 01:18:03 2015 UTC,I hadnt't actually thought about how that future scene sets up how the new movies would have to go if they are going to stay faithful to cannon they established...  Interesting
xmen,2v0zsy,barnes80,2,Sat Feb 7 04:51:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I personally LOVED the ending scene. But it really serves as a bookend to the ENTIRE franchise. Creating movies that happen before a conclusion we've already seen and is canon makes it difficult and limits what they can do. Obviously if anyone we saw in that scene is in life threatening danger, or talks about leaving the team, etc, we all know it's nonsense that won't happen."
xmen,2v0zsy,ThreeHourRiverMan,2,Sat Feb 7 05:12:05 2015 UTC,It's a damn shame they already played the Phoenix card and lost. I could go for an Onslaught epic or an Asgard storyline post-Marvel getting the rights for X-men back.
xmen,2v0zsy,Foozartron,1 point,Sat Feb 7 04:48:16 2015 UTC,I would love to see Genosha but keep the Phoenix out of it.  I think it would be pretty cool if they used Cameron Hodge as one of the villians.

He's in X-Force (written by Si Spurrier). //SPOILERS//  He's infected with something that causes him to explode in X number of hours. So each day he clones himself, uploads the gist of that day's experiences and then steps into a nuclear reactor to safely destroy himself. The memory transfer isn't perfect, which allows for some interesting plot points.  No interaction with Scott or any of the other X-Men.  Hope is there in a coma too.  Plus there's sexy time with Psylocke. I've really enjoyed this run, but sometimes you need to keep pushing through to get to the payoff of the arc."

And there's an ANXF shaped hole in all of our hearts that may never heal. Really, his books are kind of the weakest links. They had so much behind them and they promised so much and yet we're on the sixth month of Last Will with nary a (satisfying) resolution in sight. And All-New lost it's way around Battle of the Atom.

I mean, it's certainly true that he didn't get much attention from the movies, but think about when the movies came out.   First X-men movie debuted in 2000, a year before Grant Morrison's New X-men. Cyclops identity in the comics has been growing hugely since then, but the original trilogy was working off comics material from the 90s, when Wolverine was most popular, and when Cyclops was portrayed much more as a boyscout."
xmen,2ureux,MonkeyCube,2,Wed Feb 4 20:05:52 2015 UTC,"Wasn't this right around the time of The Twelve storyline, which was yet another X-Men storyline about how important Cyclops was?  (Admittedly, The Twelve was a crap story.)  Cyclops has always been a focal point of the X-Men, has had plenty of good characterization both pre- and post- 90s, and they did him a disservice by barely having him in the films.  I'll grant you, Cyclops had pretty shitty characterization in the mid-late 90s, but so did everyone.  For a period of time Wolverine was drawn without a nose and lived the woods outside the school with a bandana over his eyes.  Check out bad 90s Wolverine."

xmen,2uop5k,ClumsyG,2,Tue Feb 3 22:13:13 2015 UTC,"This was one of my favorite issues of any X-men comic in quite a while.  I agree with the reviewer that his series has meandered and been a little hard to figure a lot of the time, but this is only the second or third time I've been eagerly awaiting a next issue in the last year.  Are we bringing back Xavier?  Is his presence in the present going to somehow retcon the last few issues?  Is Malloy going to reboot reality?  Who knows?  But I kinda can't wait to find out."
xmen,2ul9dc,krbin,27,Tue Feb 3 02:17:58 2015 UTC,It's cannon in the comics. In an issue of X-Men in the 90's (X-Men 25 I believe) Magneto ripped the adamantium out of Wolverine's body. When he recovered he popped his claws and discovered that he had bone claws under the metal ones. Then for some reason he became more animal looking and wore a bandanna as a mask. Then Sinistester Apocalypse re-covered his bones and we got back the Logan we know and love.
xmen,2ul9dc,Kupy,19,Tue Feb 3 02:36:34 2015 UTC,"To add to your comment, it was in Wolverine #75 when he (and some of the other X-Men) learned about the bone claws during a Danger Room session. Also, wasn't it actually Apocalypse who re-grafted the adamantium to his bones again, turning him into the Horseman of Death right before The Twelve storyline?"
xmen,2ul9dc,Nephilius,7,Tue Feb 3 05:40:06 2015 UTC,You are correct... Wolverine was his second Death and he gave him the adamantium.
xmen,2ul9dc,Paperdawl,4,Tue Feb 3 05:52:55 2015 UTC,"I think I know the reason why he went feral. Adamantium is highly poisoness, so his healing ia constantly busy healing his body from the poison, when the adamantium was ripped out of his body, his healing factor didn't know what to do, so he went all beast-like."
xmen,2ul9dc,Qwintro,2,Tue Feb 3 21:34:02 2015 UTC,At the time I believe it was explained that his healing factor would slowly de-evolve him into a more ferral state and since adamantium is toxic to the body and his healing factor trying to expel it from his body if kept his healing factory from making him a complete animal. However that doesn't take into acount the 200 years he'd lived prior or for characters like Sabretooth who also have a healing factor but no adamantium.
xmen,2ul9dc,ChurchBrimmer,14,Thu Feb 5 05:44:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, they were a retcon of a retcon. Originally they were part of his gloves. Writers thought that was lame (anyone could steal his gloves and be Wolverine), so they made them implants from the experiment that gave him his adamantium. Which was fine and dandy for a couple decades. Then once Magneto ripped all that out, they didn't want a Wolverine who wasn't very Wolverine-ish, so they made them a part of his natural mutation. Him even saying ""why don't I remember these then?""  Now since stuff like Origins has been made, we've seen Wolverine with bone claws dated prior to the surgery.  Wolverine's publication history is almost as screwed up as his fictional history."

During the 80s there was so much information about how the claws were added to Wolverine's forearms during the adamantium bonding process, and how they are popped out of his hands via ""surgically rearranged muscles"", making the distinct ""snikt"" noise.  And then they turned them into bones."

It's so badass it had to be split into 2 parts with Fatal Attractions and Bloodties in the middle.   Also the very first Genosha story circa uncanny 236-237 (probably not as underrated) was great as it was the first mass slavery story to take place during the present (as dotfp is takes place in the future) therefore it's very dark. With a depowered (and dying wolvie) and Carol (in Rogue's body) as the protagonists. And Maddie kicking so much arse even while unconscious.   After that though the books went to Genosha for a couple of months every couple of months. Towards the end of the 90s I was like f- Genosha no one cares, until Cassie destroyed the country (and even then it was set after a story that took place in Genosha the previous issue)."
xmen,2ulglc,vheart,1 point,Tue Feb 3 04:48:19 2015 UTC,I was binge reading the Xmen comics when I first got Marvel Unlimited and reading through the Genoshian story made me so mad. I think I just got too attached to the mutants at that point to read that one.

Fun series which no one talks about."

xmen,2ulglc,Exodus111,5,Tue Feb 3 14:13:52 2015 UTC,"Gotta go old school with this one, but I re-read the X-tinction Agenda about every year.  It was the culmination of YEARS of build up of the Island nation of Genosha as a sort of Parable of South Africa (And Israel), a nation that brainwashes mutants into the state serving Mutates, and has no issue breaching foreign soil with their special units attacking the X-men on more then one occasion.  A nation slowly being taken over by the madman Cameron Hodge, a demon gave him immortality, Arch-angel cut his head off, so the the Genoshan state attached his head to a giant mechanical scorption contraption that makes him more then a match for all the X-men.  The whole gang gets together, many for the first time for this battle, X-men led by Storm, X-factor led by Cyclops (Since his brother Alex got kidnappend and brainwashed by Genosha), X-force led by Cable.  Coolest moment is when they are all tied up hanging from advanced shakles, and Gambit shows off his thief skills by taking a spike Hodge shot into his leg out with his teeth, dropping it, and catching it with his feet, then picking the lock freeing everyone."
xmen,2ulglc,vheart,4,Tue Feb 3 11:39:59 2015 UTC,"I just re-read that recently. I've liked it a lot more than when I read it previously. Oh and they were still New Mutants at the time. The NM part of it was IMO the weakest link due to Liefield's art.  I also enjoyed Claremont's re-take of the events of X-tinction Agenda in X-Men Forever, with a different take on Storm's mutate process. I like it better than the canon."

Alternate takes on many of the mutants in a world where the battle between mutants and humanity went a different way. Beast was beaten to death, Cyclops was forced to kill his brother and his eyelids were removed (forcing him to wear a mask to keep his optic blasts in check), and Legion is a big hero with no issues of instability.  Even though they wrapped it up nicely, I thought we didn't get to spend enough time in that sad world."

I can't believe it doesn't have its own trade -- probably just because there's one crappy unrelated issue in the middle of it (Dracula vs Storm), and they don't want to release it with that one cut out.  X-Treme X-Men: Mekanix -- must-read for Kitty Pryde fans.  Havok & Wolverine: Meltdown. Fantastic art!   Warren Ellis's alternate history endings at the end of Astonishing X-Men: Ghost Boxes. Whoa, the bleakest X-Men stories of all time.  Doop & Wolverine - Peter Milligan."
xmen,2ulglc,KingCartwright,2,Tue Feb 3 20:40:27 2015 UTC,Identity Disc - Not a mainstream X-Men book but for the most part centers around Juggernaut as the narrator.

xmen,2ujmc0,TGCOutcast,11,Mon Feb 2 18:58:01 2015 UTC,"In the comics in the 90s Magneto ripped out his adamantium in one of the best comics of the decade. He eventually got it back when Apocalypse forced him to become the horseman Death (it's complicated), as a way to again get him at full power. It seems that'd be a way to make it happen.  Personally I think adamantium is such a huge part of his character I'm getting sick of seeing bone claws. And his skeleton is hardly ever mentioned."
xmen,2ujmc0,ThreeHourRiverMan,6,Mon Feb 2 19:28:14 2015 UTC,"People get sick of seeing the bone claws because it reminds you of just how pathetic he would be if not for the adamantium.  Seeing him go up against the sentinel at the end of DOFP reminded me ""Oh yeah.  This guy is fucking worthless with bone claws.""  He was almost completely irrelevant to that last fight."
xmen,2ujmc0,jjblarg,7,Tue Feb 3 05:20:58 2015 UTC,"I'm sick of them because for the vast majority of his comics life he has adamantium. In the movies he seems to have bone more than he has his adamantium.   I don't agree with your first sentence. Part of what makes Wolverine fun to root for is that he's far from perfect. One of the most famous comics of the 90s had Magneto brutalizing him by removing his adamantium. Just recently he was killed in the comics. He's not an Omegal level mutant. He's not even the level below, like Prof. X and Magneto. He's just a fun dude to root for, with a killer attitude and a strong moral code. If we all just wanted to root for the most powerful, we'd just be Superman fans.   The movies also do a pretty piss poor job of showing what he's capable of. Even when he's fighting, Hugh (who I overall like, but is definitely flawed in his portrayal) pretty much just swings his arms around wildly and screams. That's not how Wolverine fights. He's a skilled, trained fighter, who goes absolutely beserk when necessary (and when really pissed off). He's far from worthless without his adamantium, despite what the movies show."
xmen,2ujmc0,ThreeHourRiverMan,1 point,Tue Feb 3 05:33:52 2015 UTC,"In all fairness though ""Omega Level Mutant"" is just a term a writer throws out to say ""look look he's super powerful guys"" and then another writer later says ""no fuck that"" and changes it. Thus is the way of the comics."
xmen,2ujmc0,ChurchBrimmer,1 point,Thu Feb 5 05:51:51 2015 UTC,"Very true. But Wolverine has never been one of the most powerful mutants. He's never been Magneto, for example. Magneto is a good example of the sliding scale. Is he Omega? Technically no. But he can do a fuckload of cool shit, and depending on the writer he's about as powerful as it gets. But he gets nosebleeds when he really pushes it... It seems there's a sliding scale where they all agree to just not make mutants as powerful as Franklin Richards, to let Magneto be near the top, and when they do make Omega level to just have them have some kind of handicap so they're not just walking deus ex machina for every issue (like Franklin Richards would be)."
xmen,2ujmc0,ThreeHourRiverMan,1 point,Thu Feb 5 06:34:41 2015 UTC,"Yes but even Wolverine has been shown to have sliding abilities (especially when viewed chronoligically). Also I thought that at one point (again Omega Level has been loosely defined over the years) that any character that was functionally immortal (such as Wolverine with his healing factor or Iceman in iceform) were considered Omega. Damn they really need to define that beyond ""A dude who's way more powerful than the last really powerful dude"""

xmen,2ujmc0,EricTheKlein,1 point,Tue Feb 3 13:53:51 2015 UTC,"""Fucking worthless with bone claws."" This pissed me off. Not you, but the choice to portray Wolverine's claws as useless against metal w/o adamantium. In the comics his claws are still sharp and strong enough to cut through many metals, including steel. In DoFP they are portrayed as only pointed not edged. Even with bone claws Wolverine should have been able to slice through everything in DoFP,,with slightly more effort put towards Sentinel combat. I love that movie, but like EVERY SINGLE X-MEN MOVIE EVER it has fucked up so many small things, it pisses me off. We have never actually seen the X-Men work as team. That is why they are so dangerous. A single mutant is not that threatening (below omega level) but 3+ of them working in tandem is nearly unstoppable. No film has ever capture that degree of teamwork, which is integral to X-Men. EDIT: Drunkish"
xmen,2ujmc0,2feral,4,Wed Feb 4 03:27:57 2015 UTC,I'm not a comic book reader but I think maybe Magneto or Apocalypse himself will help him getting his Adamantium skeleton back in the next movie.

xmen,2ujmc0,darthstupidious,7,Tue Feb 3 03:04:48 2015 UTC,"My theory is that Logan ends up going through the adamantium process again, with Raven posing as Stryker.   The decade before DOFP is still a mystery, so my theory is that Raven has been acting as an agent for Apocalypse or Mister Sinister, in some way, shape, or form. Perhaps unknowingly.   But I think that under Apocalypse/Sinister > Mystique/Stryker, Logan is going to end up as a puppet for Apocalypse. I really think Logan is going to be one of the villains for the flick, and then afterwards, it sets up a completely emotional ""Old Man Logan"" flick to send Hugh Jackman sailing into the sunset as Wolvy. This way, after the events of ""Apocalypse,"" he feels the need to atone and set himself apart. I also think it would very much come full circle, with Logan essentially being the same person he was at the start of the original ""X-Men"" flick (memory loss and all)."

The cast from the original trilogy (sans wolverine) are no more. Their future is set at the conclusion of dofp.   We will now follow the new cast thru Apocalypse. What McAvoy and Fassbender do after this trilogy is a good question.

Events will never line up the same way with the same characters in the same timeline. So forget about the comics entirely when talking about the movies.  Let's remember what was happening in dofp.  Wolverine's consciousness was sent back to the past into his old body. His body at that time had not yet gone thru the weapon x experiments. Hence bone claws. At the end of the movie he is returned to his new present with an alive and well Jean, cyclops, prof x, and assumable metal claws.  Then we see Stryker taking the 70s version of wolverine out of the water presumably to then carry out the weapon x program.   What drives me nuts though I'd why reveal that Stryker was actually Mystique. The writers added an entirely new level of bs with that reveal."

Cyclops' approach took equal parts of Xavier's peaceful methodology and Magneto's extremism and combined them with his own tactical and leadership talents to create a synthesis that (as seen in the current Uncanny run and AvX particularly) considers evolution and growth of the mutant species the highest good.  Unfortunately, Cyclops' idealism was so lofty and his goals were so far-reaching that few could actually follow him.  Most of the X-Men were happy to exist in the short term and deal with their own personal issues or whatever small-time threats the Avengers left them to deal with, but in terms of carving out a place in society and history for the natural course of evolution to take mutants where they were meant to go, very few were willing to do that.  Even fewer were willing to go to the lengths and make the difficult kinds of decisions that Cyclops (and to some degree Xavier) did.  TL;DR:  Cyclops was right."

xmen,2uaw2q,hiim_grouf,6,Sun Feb 1 01:01:07 2015 UTC,I think Multiple Man is my favorite. I don't know why.

I would have loved to send dupes out into the world to try all sorts of things and learn some mad skills, then just reabsorb their knowledge and experiences.   Thats just what stuck out to me as awesome about him."
xmen,2uaw2q,ithinkimightbegay,2,Sun Feb 1 01:48:31 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing. There's so much out there that I'll never experience, but he could try it all."

xmen,2uaw2q,figandmelon,7,Sat Jan 31 14:43:57 2015 UTC,"One thing I always wondered about Jean Grey was, if she had unlimited, unfathomable godlike powers, why couldn't she fix her marriage?"

xmen,2uaw2q,hiim_grouf,3,Sat Jan 31 19:58:46 2015 UTC,Because she'd always know she was living a lie. Who would want that?

xmen,2uaw2q,moowser190,5,Sun Feb 1 01:00:10 2015 UTC,Bobby Drake for sure. Coolest power on the original X-men IMO. Also best buds with Spider-Man. And is technically an Omega-level mutant.
xmen,2uaw2q,KingCartwright,2,Sun Feb 1 03:36:17 2015 UTC,"I was leaning towards Iceman as well. He's an original X-men, been there since day one. He's the most well adjusted X-men also: went got a college degree, normal job, still a team player when needed, and hasn't had a tragic death (from my knowledge). This also adds up to having him a lack of popular story lines and interesting drama. Powers are top notch and super helpful in a battle. If I'm on the school ground at recess you bet your but I have no problems playing as Iceman."
xmen,2uaw2q,redgears,1 point,Wed Feb 4 09:16:49 2015 UTC,Also it was fun to watch his growth as a character. From the pun-tastic teenager to the more mature/badass person he is today.   I think he died once in Age of Apocalypse

xmen,2uaw2q,murderofcrows90,10,Sat Jan 31 15:57:23 2015 UTC,"For a guy who's been alive for almost 2 centuries, Wolverine struck me as ridiculously short-sighted.  He could never quite learn to put aside his personal issues for the good of the team.  Sure he had essential talents and abilities, but he could never stop being a loose cannon long enough to be much good to anyone, besides being a regenerating meat shield.  IMO Laura Kinney was a better 'Wolverine' than Logan, because she was willing to take orders and function in a team framework.  I hope he stays dead."
xmen,2uaw2q,pharaohkuranes,7,Sat Jan 31 16:25:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but didn't he 'forget' most of those 2 centuries of memories?  Ha, remember after Mags pulled out his adamantium and he reverted to that weird looking 'bestial' version? Maybe his animal urges keep him from evolving as you suggest."

Colossus  1) He's an integral part of one of the most iconic X-Men maneuvers ever, the Fastball Special.  2) He's got veterancy, being from the same class of X-Men as Storm.  3) He's one of the few iconic X-Men who've had to harbor dark deithic powers, such as Archangel.  Seeing as he was Cytorrak's bitch for a bit.  4) He is in the X-Men leaderboard for hook ups, having been with both Kitty Pride and Domino.  5) The Rasputin family is one of the iconic mutant families, including the prerequisite drama.  6) He's died.  And come back to life.  Like a proper X-Men member.  7) Heroism in the face of prejudice, hate, fear, and peril.    8) The giant hulking metal man is one of the most human characters of the X-Men.  Self sacrifice for his loved ones, actual longstanding hurt and feelings of betrayal after being chewed out by Magik at the tail end of AvX, finding himself lost and without purpose when his life has collapsed around him to the point where he goes to siberia and tries to be a farmer.  9) The first big thing he did with his phoenix powers was provide free electricity to millions of people by negotiating with lightning monsters.  The second was putting giant lobster legs on whales.  He did something amazing and world-impacting, then awesome.  Who doesn't want whale sized lobster legs for lunch after freeing North America from its dependence on coal for its electricity?  So, Colossus.  The most iconic of the X-Men.  How can you argue against that?"

Just reading it I always have the thought ""stuff is going doooowwwn.""   edit: It's probably like the feeling I get watching my favorite comic book movie, the Dark Knight. Just that unnerving edge of excitement and anxiety. $@! is going down, and it makes you interested to see what happens next, but also gives you that ""oh shit oh shit oh shit"" feeling.  *I hate that a DC character is my favorite comic movie. I still swear that as much as I enjoy the Singer / Jackman Wolverine, a solo Wolverine movie where he was given the dark, serious tone of the Nolan trilogy would be the most amazing movie ever made. Unfortunately I'll be like 60 years old by the time they have a chance to do it, since it'd have to be a total reboot of a billion dollar franchise."

I just realized I have absolutely no idea how Magneto got his memories back. How did that happen? He's now like it never happened, and has been for years. I guess nothing in comics is permanent if you're important enough a character. (Wolvie getting his adamantium back, Magneto later being an ally again, etc. etc. etc. shows nothing is permanent. Prof and Wolvie will be back, as well, within a few years.)"
xmen,2uaw47,ThreeHourRiverMan,2,Sun Feb 1 05:50:04 2015 UTC,I honestly can't remeber but it was all within the 90's I just can't remember when but I don't think it stuck for more than a couple of years
xmen,2uaw47,ChurchBrimmer,1 point,Sun Feb 1 05:52:34 2015 UTC,"Supposedly it lasted up until at least the Age of Apocalypse, which is a little while after. Then Astra gave him back his memories (method never said, lol) in order to create Joseph. Joseph went nuts, Mags escaped, Joseph did Joseph things, and Magneto did Magneto things.  http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/4005-1441/  I love comic books."
xmen,2u99er,2feral,19,Sat Jan 31 00:35:07 2015 UTC,"When I rewatch it objectively without any of my fan boy resentment, it's not that terrible of a movie. Fairly enjoyable for what it is if I discount source material. And Kelsie Grammar as Beast is one of my favorite castings of all time."
xmen,2u99er,CykeWasRight,1 point,Sat Jan 31 03:22:27 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more.  Some of the moments where Jean becomes Phoenix have pretty intense cinematography (with pretty awesome music)/ALL FANBOYNESS ASIDE.  Magneto also has a few badass moments.
xmen,2u99er,sapi3nce,8,Mon Feb 2 03:43:45 2015 UTC,"I would have liked it so much better if Scott died on screen in a spectacular way instead of, ""hey, I found his glasses.""

xmen,2u5wic,Supersecretsword,4,Fri Jan 30 05:37:58 2015 UTC,The teaser would be as simple as changing their costume. Have Wolverine look at his blades and see his X-Force costume or something.
xmen,2u5wic,_Lady_Deadpool_,7,Fri Jan 30 14:04:37 2015 UTC,It would be great if AoA leads into X-Force.  I'm still holding out hope that they are going to put Cable into AoA and then they can spin him off into the Deadpool movie and have him be the leader of X-Force.

Of course, that's probably why Cyclops isn't the dead one too. Wolverine is much more a superheroic figure at the moment, so his death and eventual resurrection are going to sell more based on pure spectacle. Cyclops on the other hand is more philosophical figure, and a large part of Uncanny X at the moment is an exploration of the militant pursuit of human rights. Basically, Wolverine will sell more based on drama, and death is dramatic. Cyclops will sell more based on controversy, so he'll continue to be controversial and essentially immortal."

xmen,2u4yce,ChurchBrimmer,1 point,Sun Feb 1 03:57:22 2015 UTC,"In the original comics though, Cyclops was the impeccable moral boy scout, rendered somewhat uninteresting by virtue of not having much to say. His currently conflicted status, and what really makes me a fan, is the work of roughly 14 years of consistent, reasonably well written character development.   I could chart you a course of this character relearning his confidence, having his world shattered, having the survival of his race being put on his shoulders, learning to distrust, and becoming obsessed with survival, to the point where he becomes the traumatized militant we see today.   The controversy of whether or not Cyclops is right or a douche is something I find irrelevant, next to him slowly becoming one of the most fascinating X-men."

He is THE original X-men and practically Xavier's son (I think he even legaly adopted Scott) and he turns his back on Xavier's dream after the events of AvX and basically (in my opinion) is using his ""Mutant Revolution"" as a way to wallow in self pitty. However in all reality his revolution is 5% trying to piss off Logan's X-men (even with a dead Wolvie he's trying to piss him off), 5% actually doing Mutant Revolution things and 90% sitting in his secret hideout bitching about how much humanity hates them. Again that's just how I see it when I read Uncanny"
xmen,2u4yce,ChurchBrimmer,1 point,Sun Feb 1 04:34:36 2015 UTC,"Cyke's disillusionment with Xavier's policies actually started after the fallout of House of M, with the Vulcan story. Xavier was also a very underwhelming character while the mutants were moving towards extinction, and mostly just voiced his worries and objections while Cyclops united the remaining Mutants where he could. Where Xavier was a visionary, Cyclops was a leader, and they got on each other's nerves a long time before AvX.   As for the current Uncanny run, I agree with you. His 'revolution' is likely never going to happen, his current fugitive status is largely a symptom of his inability to stop fighting. It's more the story of Cyclops and his team trying to rebuild themselves without falling into depression than anything else, and I think that's what makes it an interesting story.  The thing I think you should consider most though, is that Cyclops becoming obsessed with survival is what allowed Wolverine to draw the line and found his own school, and both characters were written with that in mind. Like Magneto and Xavier, Cyclops and Wolverine are two halves of the same coin. A new dichotomy for a new generation."

I'm assuming he will attempt to learn his powers to try to fix some things. Could be way wrong. But there's something about him. So far no one has wanted to just help him understand his powers.

xmen,2u5q53,wellssh,2,Fri Jan 30 05:43:09 2015 UTC,Yes.  I did this back in college and it was a blast as I really only read X-Men back in the days and not Uncanny.  The writing teams did quite a few complimentary stories in that decade.  Uncanny 281 and X-men 1 came out the same month.  just start side by side from there and it's pretty easy to keep up.  Some issues even tell you that they continue in the other series.  Just don't forget to get the cross over issues with X-Force and X-Factor for Fatal Attractions and the X-Cutioner's Song.
xmen,2u5q53,SensitiveArtist,2,Fri Jan 30 03:28:18 2015 UTC,read both. Xmen vol. 2 is the best. and yeah Fatal Attractions and X-Cutioner's Song are great so youll wanna cross over with those.

I keep a spreadsheet with issue summaries, though I've been reading New Mutants, X-Factor, and X-Force side by side as well. Usually I just read a line until I realize it's referencing other issues or crossover events, then I catch up. Sometimes I'll do 10 issues in a row of one line, sometimes just 1 or 2 before switching. Don't stress out about it too much, just go at your own pace. It's a lot to tackle and it's really not worth the effort to obsess over it."

Things were happening in between movies that we didn't see. The danger room scene from X3 shows that there are sentinels and the X Men are training to handle them.  There is a promotional website for DOFP called 25 moments that explains the original timeline. Including the original trilogy.
xmen,2txsmg,slicwilli,1 point,Wed Jan 28 15:50:34 2015 UTC,It is best not to think too hard about the continuity of these movies.  They clearly had no plan to still be making these movies 15 years after the first one so things are going to be sloppy.

xmen,2trajd,benserwa,10,Tue Jan 27 03:22:31 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree!  Lately I've been thinking X-Men series need to move away from high school's ""I have angst and hair in new places, and thinly veiled sexual discovery allegories"".  I realize they're outcasts, but to me it always feels so insular and just petty, given what's at stake.  I mean, let's face it.  The way they are almost always written, teenagers are just boring.  Kids make lousy supervillains, and they can't realistically fight supervillains, either, so it winds up being just the professors who ever fight -- but their real passion is 8th grade level literature and pre-algebra.  I think it would be way cooler to focus on college aged kids.  They're still young enough to have fun and fall in love, but they're transitioning into discovering who they are as fully developed people.  Like anybody's college experience, their responsibilities are more real, and they're finding a meaningful concept of what the world is like and what part they want to play in it. And we don't have to do that condescending ""Oh, aren't you plucky, joining the fight when the chips are down even though you're 15 and pretty much incompetent?"" thing.  Am I going to get my wish?  Not a chance.  But a guy can dream."

Let me start out saying that I really, really think that the whole time shifted X-Men has long overstayed its welcome. So I was predisposed to not like the Cyclops solo series.  That said, I really enjoyed the Cyclops series so far (I've only read the first TPB so far).  It was a fun father-son bonding story.  While it was heavy on the ""life lessons"" for young Scott, the story was written so well that it never felt preachy.    Uncanny X-Men is a great series.

So let's say DOFP erased the Magneto mutant machine moment that turned her hair white. The new timeline created by DOFP has plenty of opportunities for Rogue to get he stripe (in stories that may or may not be told in future movies).  Perhaps there was another stressful event.  Perhaps her aesthetic naturally gravitates toward bleached roots and it's now just a dye job.... the possibilities are endless (and we still end up with Rogue with her stripe)."
xmen,2tssc8,wellssh,2,Tue Jan 27 04:07:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks   I watched DOFP last week with my 13 yr old daughter thinking there was zero chance she would like it. She's in love with Evan Peters, so she just HAD to see him in the movie. Turns out she really enjoyed it  and we are now starting from the beginning. To show how much she's enjoying them, she points out Rogues hair after watching the first Xmen last night. Smart kid."
xmen,2tssc8,NotQuiteAManOfSteel,2,Tue Jan 27 12:03:26 2015 UTC,"I think that producer Simon Kinberg basically confirmed somewhere (I think in Empire Magazines podcast special on DOFP) that the basic events of some of the films turns out similar, just with altered details. So in ""new timeline Xmen 1"" magneto did try to use Rogue to power his machine, but Wolverine wasn't there when she was captured in Canada and Mystique wasn't necessarily with Magneto and killing Senator's aides/kidnapping Senators because of their altered histories and personal journeys.   Likewise X-Men 2 in the new timeline may have had Striker try to invade the school and steal the plans for Cerebro but his personal link to Wolverine is probably gone. And in X-Men 3 the cure was still developed but obviously Jean and Cyclops didn't die and the whole 'Dark Phoenix' debacle probably didn't happen, or turned out very differently.   The Wolverine most likely still occurred in some fashion because Yukio could still have searched for him on behalf of Yashida due to Wolverine's actions in WW2 before the timeline shift. The bad guys plans would have been roughly the same but Wolverine's motivations and emotional journey would have been entirely different however because he wasn't dealing with Jean's death in X3.  As for X-Men Origins: Wolverine...... that movie just straight up didn't happen at all."

xmen,2tno3l,TragicEther,10,Mon Jan 26 02:12:22 2015 UTC,I feel like you can't blame Berry entirely for the wooden performance. A good director would've helped her sculpt a better (less wooden) performance.  Also - what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning? IT CROAKS!!!
xmen,2tno3l,roleplaydaddy,5,Mon Jan 26 03:35:47 2015 UTC,I somewhat agree but she was the same under Brett Ratner too. She was a tad more aggressive power wise but when Xavier was offed it felt like crocodile tears.

Maybe it's because she's been given bad roles but Bryan Singer isn't known for bringing out the best in actors.
xmen,2tno3l,Exodus111,12,Mon Jan 26 04:35:05 2015 UTC,"Yes... ANYTHING is better then Halle Berry.  I am not saying she is bad, she did win an academy award and all. She just never felt the role. Seeing interviews with her where they talk about Storm she couldn't be less interested. She was a bad pick."
xmen,2tno3l,whiskeybill,4,Mon Jan 26 03:41:52 2015 UTC,That was back in the day when they were more relying on star power to bring in audience members instead of actually making casting choices based on who would play the character best.

xmen,2tno3l,ThreeHourRiverMan,6,Mon Jan 26 04:26:35 2015 UTC,"I honestly found that article to be incredibly racist.  ""Black does not equate to all black""  “What’s the real issue, it’s not like they cast a white woman as Storm, does it really need to be this complicated?” Yeah, it kind of does. Even as a fictional character, Storm is a feminist symbol for Black Women the way that most assume Wonder Woman has been for women all these years.""  She's basically saying Alexandra Shipp isn't a role model for black women, because she is too ""light."" I would think a great actress being cast in a role would be a step forward for equal rights, regardless of her pigment count.  At some point talent wins out, regardless if they actually look like the comic counterparts. It's why Hugh Jackman is literally 13 inches too tall to be Wolverine, a MAJOR part of his character, but no one (except me to be fair) complains. An African American woman who is CLEARLY African American was cast. I don't care if she's ""lighter"" in her pigmentation, or ""darker"" in her pigmentation. If she's a good actress who will do the character justice, while actually being the right race, there is no logical reason for this to be a valid complaint. Debating if someone is validly black enough to play a black character is to look into race way more than is necessary and to cause division where it isn't warranted, fair, valid, or frankly sane to do so.  I mean seriously, if she does a great job and crushes this role, and has a big part, will any young African American girl be turned off because she's the ""wrong"" type of African American? How would that be her or Singer's fault?!"
xmen,2tno3l,Wolff_Laarcen,5,Mon Jan 26 10:19:59 2015 UTC,"She's basically saying Alexandra Shipp isn't a role model for black women, because she is too ""light.""    Not at all, you missed the point, really.  The article is saying that a typically dark-skinned character being portrayed by a very light-skinned actress is furthering the racist idea that dark skinned women are inherently less beautiful or desirable than lighter - or white - ones.  This idea is somewhat less prominent today that it has been in decades past, but it is definitely real and definitely still in effect.  The article goes on to explain how this idea is much older than X-Men comics, dating back to slavery.     there is no logical reason for this to be a valid complaint. Debating if someone is validly black enough to play a black character is to look into race way more than is necessary and to cause division where it isn't warranted, fair, valid, or frankly sane to do so.   There's also an interesting note about attempting to dismiss the issue (as you're doing) is really stating 'I don't see the difference between one black person and another'.  All that said, there's a certain degree of suspension of disbelief that is necessary when dealing with stories/movies based on comic book characters that this author might have overlooked.  For example, I personally thought Famke Janssen was a terrible approximation of Jean Grey - but whatever, I understood who the character was supposed to be.  It's just a movie anyway.  Besides, if you attempt to take note of every racist issue with comics and movies, you'll never get anything else done."

How are they going to fly a spaceship? I can tell they aren't going to take Ororo seriously and she's not old enough to even dive into her awesome back story. It's just another attempt to appeal to teens when they don't understand adults eat this shit up. There are so many storylines out there they could do with adult actors (maybe someone other than Halle Barry) that would blow the world of non comic readers away.  The way they are doing this timeline doesn't match the age they were when they met apocalypse. They probably won't even include everyone in the storyline, just whoever is convenient to get ratings.  They should've cast these younger actors in first class, not apocalypse."

xmen,2tli1x,detourne,2,Sun Jan 25 10:40:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, i think some of the Astonishing artwork looked weird. Squarish faces, flat heads, Emma Didn't look that great and Kitty was drawn a bit weirdly (her hair looked like she had always been rained on).  I like Terry Dodson a lot but when he draws female faces they all look too similar. Love his Deathstrike redesign though.   My favorite has to be Jim Lee for nostalgia. Greg Land for refreshing colors and character personality.  EDIT: I know Greg Land is a cheat and not original since he recycles and traces (a lot of the faces are porn faces), but I find his artwork quite funny because of how awful he is at anatomy."
xmen,2tli1x,logangrey123,2,Sun Jan 25 21:17:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah Jim Lee is great. I always loved his Wolverine and Beast especially. His Wolvie is how he should be - a jacked, feral runt who just looks dangerous, despite being strikingly shorter than the rest. His Beast is exactly how I always have, and always will think of how Beast should look.   Jim Lee X-Men was my first taste into X-Men books, I was born in 1985, and I was I think 6 when X-Men 1 came out. X-Men 4 was my first ever Marvel comic. So trust, me I agree on the nostalgia points for him."

He generally deals in LP's and nes snes games and accessories and has no new comics just 1990 and older that he brings in from collections he picks up.

Here is a folder with all the ones when I got them. http://imgur.com/a/qIyvR  He also had a few arcade game marquees that I'm building a light box for to hang in my entertainment room   http://photos-h.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t51.2885-15/10735020_838602546190319_656530293_n.jpg  He's a great guy and can find you anything for cheap too. I've helped finance some big silverage collections and have done ok with him. I also get 1st refusal to anything he nrings in and the prices are always very friendly. He is all about rolling stock. Especially when it comes to comics. They are a distant 3rd in his shop sales wise. The Snes stuff he cant keep in stock.  So I have grabbed him stuff when I travel to Alberta for work of craigslist. Stacks of snes stuff for 200 bucks and he in turn gives me silver age stuff as trade.  I got all this(1st Ghost rider, 1st Molecule man 1st Hulk vs Thor and early X-men for my run)  for 150 bucks worth of snes stuff. I brought in 3 systems and 27 games, some with full boxes and he was happier than hell and had it all sold very quickly.   http://photos-e.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xpf1/t51.2885-15/10547099_703270809787284_2136957832_n.jpg  Almost all my stuff is on instagram.  my user name is @69charger_rt_xmencollector if you want to check it all out."

All of her family will be killed or in hiding.  Someone will be duped into marrying a person who could pass as her sister, who will then be the victim of great turmoil and suffering.  She'll be in love with someone who takes her for granted, and will abuse his 'love' because of the leadership role he has to fulfill.  She'll be loved by the most dangerous person she'll know, and be unable to escape his draw.  Any son(s) she has will be used as a weapon by others.

Wolvie was always my favorite character growing up, and as a kid I could never afford to buy my own copies of these books. It wasn't until I became an adult with an actual income I bought them. So although combined they're worth less than $100, it was a cool moment when I was finally able to get my hands on them.   Not the most exciting, but for sentimental reasons that's my choice."
xmen,2tg6d7,ThreeHourRiverMan,2,Fri Jan 23 22:24:06 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.... I collected as a kid in the late 80s.   Claremont/Miller Wolverine 1-3 -- handmedowns from my brother (I might have to shell out for #4...)  Probably the most expensive I have is Uncanny 266, the origin of Gambit.   The best part of my collection is that I can read comics that haven't been reprinted in color yet, like parts of the Silvestri era. As a kid I thought my comics would be worth a million bucks, but now I realize the real value is that I get to read them."

There is no getting around Cyclops being screwed in these movies. Marsden was a bad choice from the start seeing that he's not as imposing next to Jackman and it's not believable that someone like him would ever have Famke Janssen as a gf especially when she's 3 inches taller than him.
xmen,2tcypa,fatalfuryguy,3,Fri Jan 23 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"I don't agree, I thought Mardsen was a perfect Cyclops he was just under utilized. Logan is supposed to be more dangerous and offsetting to be around than Scott. It's actually something Jackman didn't pull off until the last two movies he's been in (The Wolverine and DOFP). Logan should be intimidating, whereas until recently Cyclops was the normal, levelheaded hero who gets by on intellect and instinct as much as he does his powers."
xmen,2tcypa,ThreeHourRiverMan,0,Fri Jan 23 19:57:23 2015 UTC,"Where did you get that he got by on intellect and instinct? He never showed those things  he did absolutely NOTHING! He was only there to  amplify Jackman's coolness. A generic stiff for logan to walk all over.  Top it off with Jackman being a better actor and more imposing (he's 6'3 Marsden 5'9)Marsden's Cyclops never stood a chance and therefore was an awful choice. End of the day, Cyclops is the leader of the x men and even wolverine listens to his orders. You'd never get the same dynamic from Marsden /Jackman, only the other way around."
xmen,2tcypa,fatalfuryguy,1 point,Fri Jan 23 20:41:15 2015 UTC,"I was talking about comic book Cyke. He's been brutally underutilized in the movies. Logan's height is one of the big things they got wrong with Jackman, him being a ""runt"" is a pretty big part of his character, and one of the many reasons he has a chip on his shoulder. But, in the first 2 X-Men movies it's clear that Scott is the field leader and even Wolverine listens to him, albeit begrudgingly."

It's mostly based on first glance opinions, she doesn't feel entirely right for the role of storm, (this will probably come off as super racist but w.e) she's too pretty, too westernized looking with her beautiful holywood starlet looks, I can see the whole Haley Berry thing happening all over again.  I was hoping for someone similar to Danai Gurira, it couldn't be her obviously since she's too old to play the role of a young storm, but surely they could have found someone like her that actually looks like an african godess.  They say not to judge a book by its cover though. Also I should specify this is just my personal opinion I'm not speaking for that other guy."
xmen,2tcypa,RollplayNPC,0,Fri Jan 23 19:58:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's racist by saying she's too pretty. It's a legitimate gripe. Hell, Emma Watson was too pretty to be Hermione, and it's a legitimate issue - Hermione is supposed to be homely not one of the most gorgeous actresses in Hollywood.   But that being said, Storm has always struck me in the comics as being hot. I mean, there's no such thing as an ugly female superhero, really. She's consistently drawn as having a tiny waist and D cups."

xmen,2tcypa,Helmet_Icicle,1 point,Fri Jan 23 18:14:48 2015 UTC,"This movie should be really good. I watched DOFP last night for probably the 4th time, and it gets better every time. Singer really does do a good job, and it's jarring how much better the movies are with him involved.  However, I can't help but feel a little odd that this movie will be set in the 80s, and we've already seen the future. Obviously Apocalypse isn't going to take out anyone we saw at the end of DOFP, and everything is hunky dory in the future so whatever trouble they get into won't have permanent harm for any of these characters. I guess they could kill off / maim / hurt someone we didn't see in that sequence like Nightcrawler or Gambit, and we don't know what happens to Erik*, but overall it feels like reading a chapter of a book after already reading the ending.   edit: Also, Wolverine better get his adamantium. I'm personally a little tired of the bone claws in the movies, he's been without the adamantium on screen about as much as he's had it. It's such an important part of the character, if we get movies going forward where he never undergoes the treatment it'd be a weird retelling of his story. Although one of my biggest complaints is how important they've made Stryker in the films (and Mystique, but don't get me started). A way for Wolverine to get his adamantium that doesn't involve Stryker (I guess Apocalypse can get involved) would be welcomed.  edit2: If there's any justice in the world, Fassbender will get a solo Magneto movie. I want to see Magneto doing Magneto things for 2 hours, and Fassbender is the PERFECT actor. Mags is my favorite comic book character (along with Wolvie) and I feel like Fassbender personifies everything I could possibly want in a real life Magneto. Of all comic book movies Fassbender and RDJ as Stark are the two best cast for their respective roles, IMO. (Besides the obvious Patrick Stewart, although I feel like he actually is Prof X, so that's unfair.)"
xmen,2tcypa,ThreeHourRiverMan,2,Mon Jan 26 12:56:47 2015 UTC,"Fassbender's contract is up after Apocalypse, I don't think he'll be back after. And it might be good for the franchise(As much as I love him in the role), they need to expand beyond the usual X-Men fight Magneto stuff, lot of ground to cover w/ the X-Movies now that they have a younger cast."
xmen,2tcypa,TreyAdell,2,Fri Jan 23 20:03:09 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that. Crap. I personally think X-Men is at their best when Magneto is a frenemy, but I guess that's pretty much every movie so far. All the more reason for a Magneto solo film! Let the X-Men universe expand and cover new ground, and let me get my fix of Fassbender in that role doing Magneto things!  edit: I'm also really interested in how he's utilized in Apocalypse. Logic says he'll probably be their ally and help fight Apocalypse since Apocalypse is so powerful a threat. But they had him do some pretty messed up stuff at the end of DOFP, it'd kinda strain belief if Xavier just shrugs his shoulders and lets him back into their good graces. Hell, it strained belief in X2 after what he did in X1, but that was before the movies had a strong footing, and was a different era in 2000 / 2002 than currently."

xmen,2taimx,jano-man,2,Thu Jan 22 15:10:05 2015 UTC,"Yea, I get what you mean. But at least their powers ""make sense"" per se. Every other power was rooted within the individual mutants (so, I'm talking about mutant abilities. Not magic, like Juggernaut).   I just don't get how if an X chromosome changes in me, I can start making earthquakes or something. Maybe it's something the writers just didn't think about when they wrote her character, but it's just odd that every other mutant's power is centric to their own bodies."
xmen,2taimx,jano-man,1 point,Thu Jan 22 15:44:54 2015 UTC,"But you came up with a pretty good point there OP; they have ""magic"" in comic books; and so the argument of just going with it and saying hey, it works like magic is what they were going with.. The MCU is more of a universe where they try to have things make more logical/rational sense... So it's going to get interesting when the Dr. Strange movie comes out."
xmen,2taimx,bugcatcher_billy,11,Thu Jan 22 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"In the marvel universe there are forces that exist that we do not have.   These are scientific forces that can be measured by really smart people with advanced technology, but can not be generated by mere mortals. Like cosmic energy, gamma rays, psionic energy, the many forms of magic, and countless other forms of energy.   In the marvel universe, Weather is a form of energy associated with the being known as Gaia that helped bring life to the earth. This energy, like gravity, simply exist and changes based on different componets. Many people can control different aspects of this energy. Thor, whose mother was the spirit god Gaia, can also control the weather.   Storm, like all of the other energy based mutants, evolved to actually be able to feel the weather energy, and to have it respond to her will. Much like how Cyclops feels whatever energy is the source of his beams and directs it out of his eyes. Or how Magneto can feel the magnetic forces and have them respond to his will."
xmen,2taimx,Wolff_Laarcen,6,Thu Jan 22 15:48:05 2015 UTC,"What's so difficult to understand?  If the psionic/psychokinetic/telekinetic abilities of mutants like Jean Grey, Rachel Summers, Betsy Braddock, Quentin Quire and Charles Xavier 'make sense' to you, if Scott Summers' 'eye lasers from another dimension' seems ok, if people transmuting their bodies into steel and diamond and otherwise shapeshifting is fine then Storm's weather control should be easy to accept.  If you can suspend disbelief enough to accept phenomenon like telekinesis, telepathy and control of electromagnetism - or mutants in general - I don't see why weather control is such a stretch."
xmen,2taimx,trollburgers,6,Thu Jan 22 16:04:27 2015 UTC,"Ok, you start with an error in your submission.   I can understand Magneto's magnetism. Something about his atomic make up allows him to manipulate his attraction to metals.   Magneto doesn't make himself magnetic.  He controls magnetic fields.  He can manipulate the magnetic field of the earth which is why he's such a powerful villain.  In the exact same way that Magneto's brain allows him to manipulate magnetic fields, Storm's brain allows her to manipulate the weather."

xmen,2sulrf,Homiesunite,1 point,Mon Jan 19 10:16:06 2015 UTC,The ultimate universe was an alternate universe created by marvel in order to retell classic tales with a modern spin. It was made to appeal more to teenagers and in doing so made a lot of the characters teenage to do that.

Bendis' run is good, but more comic booky and they focus on the new characters more. There are some standout issues though. Bryan K Vaughan's run is great, not as good as Millar's and takes ages to pay off, but his characterisation is the best.  After that... Kirkman didn't really do his best work."

xmen,2sulrf,whiskeybill,1 point,Wed Jan 21 03:23:39 2015 UTC,This may be a dumb question but is the Ultimate X-Men the same thing as the Ultimate Comics X-Men?  Does it have Kitty Pride in charge of the X-Men and the government puts them on a reservation?  Because if so I wasn't a fan.

xmen,2sppmr,Waltonruler5,2,Sat Jan 17 17:04:26 2015 UTC,who knows though. They still may pop up in movies after apocalypse. this isn't the last of the xmen movies for sure. I wouldnt be surprised if a ProfX shows up at the end of the Gambit movie to invite him to the team. Its just up to when they time the storyline for it...
xmen,2sppmr,Emerson73,11,Sat Jan 17 23:30:32 2015 UTC,I'm curious as to how the age situation is going to work. They already used some aging techniques to add 20 years to James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender in the DOFP to try to match the same age of when the took of 20 years from Stewart and McKellen in TLS; but now the Apocalypse movie is taking place about 10 yrs after DOFP. So I guess they will just do the same as the did before to make them look older..
xmen,2sppmr,Emerson73,7,Sat Jan 17 09:16:07 2015 UTC,"I wonder if ProfX will be wearing a bald cap in the next Xmen, or just straight up shaved"
xmen,2sppmr,daavoo,3,Sat Jan 17 20:30:11 2015 UTC,"When it comes to a blockbuster type movie of this caliber, unless McAvoy has conflicts with another role, he'll likely be shaving his head. Of course I'm sure they can do a pretty good job with a cap. I remember for Lex Luthor on Smallville, the actor shaved his head daily for filming, and then they applied makeup so there was no visible stubble."
xmen,2sppmr,emptycalsxycuriosity,3,Sat Jan 17 23:05:51 2015 UTC,And then you see Michael Rosenbaum with hair in something else and it just looks so weird.

Erik Lehnsherr? I don't even know which one is canonical at this point. In his recent Magneto run he just acknowledges them all.
xmen,2sp6y7,ThreeHourRiverMan,2,Wed Jan 21 11:04:15 2015 UTC,Spoilers  It's kinda ambiguous but I always thought he used his powers when he was facing the firing squad.  I haven't read this in a while so I forget what issue that was in.

xmen,2simmq,Forfeit32,8,Thu Jan 15 16:28:24 2015 UTC,"To be fair it is hard for any mainstream movie to get the best picture nom. The reason is that the Academy see so many movies, that mainstream movies all start to look the same. They are formulaic because the formula makes money. Your avg viewer will not notice, but when you are seeing almost every moive that comes out, the patterns become visible.   Best Picture goes to movies that try to break the pattern, even if those seem a little out there.  I love the Marvel movies, but there is no way they could win Best Picture, especially with contenders like Birdman and Grand Budapest."

I understand that movies like Selma and The Theory of Everything don't appeal to everyone, but movies Birdman, The Grand Budapest Hotel and Whiplash are entertaining films worth seeing regardless of your tastes.  Personally I would've liked to see films like Gone Girl and Nightcrawler nominated for Best Picture, but you're not going to see movies like CA: TWS and GotG get recognition from the Academy, unfortunately."

Maybe he wouldn't be hellbent on a militant path to mutant supremacy.

xmen,2sde5w,imacultclassic,2,Thu Jan 15 20:14:34 2015 UTC,I didn't think knights tale would be good as joker either.
xmen,2sde5w,I_Burn_Cereal,4,Wed Jan 14 06:13:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's pretty sweet. Not excited about Tatum as Gambit either, but we can only hope for the best."

xmen,2sde5w,thatsjustmean123,6,Thu Jan 15 20:16:39 2015 UTC,Channing Tatum is gonna be such a shitty gambit
xmen,2sde5w,SMB73,3,Thu Jan 15 22:30:25 2015 UTC,Perhaps. I'll give him the benefit of doubt.
xmen,2sde5w,fatalfuryguy,5,Wed Jan 14 13:46:21 2015 UTC,I'd rather them go for someone who's more like the character instead of just a big name. Chris Pratt didn't have much star power but perfectly brought Star-Lord's personality to life.

xmen,2sde5w,taxonrestroomvisits,15,Wed Jan 14 20:59:48 2015 UTC,kicked that water bottle of the top of channing tatum's head
xmen,2sde5w,EVula,4,Thu Jan 15 20:18:05 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, I didn't even notice the water bottle; I thought he was just timing his kick to pass thru the staff's spinning without being hit (which was impressive enough on its own). Wow."
xmen,2sde5w,chamber37,2,Wed Jan 14 21:22:17 2015 UTC,I still can't see how that works. The kick just doesn't seem fast enough to pass through the staff's spinning... Looks awesome though.
xmen,2sde5w,DukesOfBrazzers,2,Wed Jan 14 16:39:43 2015 UTC,It looks like it spun around his leg a bit.
xmen,2sde5w,fevertree,0,Sat Feb 14 19:42:05 2015 UTC,That was hot. Still...I'm going to hold my opinion for a second. If Channing loses some weight and can swing a decent accent...I'll make a decision then.
xmen,2shgvi,xilajun,3,Thu Jan 15 04:49:16 2015 UTC,Cain was chosen as one of the worthy. In taking the hammer he became Kurth breaker of stone. The xmen teleported to cytorrak's realm via Magik. They convinced cytorrak that the juggernaut was no longer his avatar as he was following the commands as Kurth. Thus cytorrak granted the power to colossus. Cain was eventually taken back into custody by the thunderbolts. Towards the end of the thunderbolts run Marko was asked to reach into a parallel universe to claim the mantle once again. Although this would be only for a short period of time. At the end of the thunderbolts the juggernaut is seen wandering off by himself to reflect on his path as the juggernaut in solitude until he loses the power. Then the new juggernaut arc starts now in Amazing Xmen.
xmen,2shgvi,SymbioticAvenger,1 point,Fri Jan 16 09:57:01 2015 UTC,"Awesome, that catches me up to speed. Thank you so much for the info."
xmen,2shgvi,SensitiveArtist,1 point,Fri Jan 16 19:32:38 2015 UTC,That's pretty much it as far as I can recall.  Cain's been rather sidelined since he lost the power of the Juggernaut.
xmen,2shgvi,SensitiveArtist,1 point,Thu Jan 15 09:56:17 2015 UTC,How did he lose his powers?
xmen,2shvs9,Doctor_Sigmund_Freud,2,Thu Jan 15 07:52:16 2015 UTC,"Well there is on extensive list on the sidebar but if you are new to the comics I would suggest Astonishing X-Men by Joss Whedon is a great intro to the X-Men.                God Loves Man Kills is a one-shot that perfectly encapsulates what the X-Men are.      Also, All-New X-Men might be a bit convoluted but it is a current series that brings the original 5 to the present so you kind of learn the history with them."
xmen,2shvs9,GoldandBlue,1 point,Thu Jan 15 09:07:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I must admit I just came here and posted the question and forgot to look at the sidebar. Still, it's nice to get some comments along with the recommendation, like in your post.  The films don't explain very well why the mutations started (I think, at least) - are there any books expanding on that?"
xmen,2shvs9,GoldandBlue,1 point,Thu Jan 15 09:19:10 2015 UTC,Just evolution. Stan Lee didn't want to give everyone an origin so he just made them born that way. Honestly the First Class movie kind of covers it.

xmen,2shvs9,xooxanthellae,2,Thu Jan 15 09:43:54 2015 UTC,Well Ultimate X-Men tried doing something like that. In that series they said that mutants are the result of human engineering but everyone hated that because it kind of destroys the mutant/civil rights analogy.

xmen,2sdfl7,apalehorse,-1,Thu Jan 15 09:03:31 2015 UTC,It's pretty stupid that in the movie they use plastic weapons against Magneto when he has control over the electromagnetic spectrum and by this could toss around anything he wanted
xmen,2sdfl7,fatalfuryguy,3,Thu Jan 15 11:42:47 2015 UTC,Seemingly not in the movie universe.
xmen,2sdfl7,fatalfuryguy,0,Thu Jan 15 13:07:54 2015 UTC,Then its like leaving wolverine's healing factor out but still giving him the claws and animal senses.
xmen,2sdfl7,xooxanthellae,0,Thu Jan 15 13:28:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe they're not just plastic, but made out of a nonconductive material?"
xmen,2sdfl7,fatalfuryguy,0,Thu Jan 15 14:51:43 2015 UTC,Atoms contain electromagnetic fields which hold protons neutrons and electrons together which make molecules. He can manipulate anything really.
xmen,2sdfl7,fatalfuryguy,1 point,Thu Jan 15 15:58:14 2015 UTC,"Aren't you referring to the strong/weak forces?  I thought there were 4 forces in physics: strong, weak, magnetic, and gravity?"

xmen,2sdfl7,xooxanthellae,0,Fri Jan 16 04:33:33 2015 UTC,"Well, magnetic is the one Magneto has complete control over and that also happens to be the strongest of the four. It's what keeps everything together."
xmen,2sdfl7,Irahs,2,Thu Jan 15 18:32:52 2015 UTC,I think the depiction of Magneto and the XMen in the cinematic continuity in general probably has more reasonable limits to their abilities just to make for a more interesting movie.  How could they even create any kind of compelling conflict if Magneto is able to just go around splitting atoms whenever anyone disagrees with him?
xmen,2s6ct1,binx85,11,Mon Jan 12 16:20:00 2015 UTC,Dark Beast has always been supremely underused IMO.
xmen,2s6ct1,megastonerd,8,Mon Jan 12 18:35:04 2015 UTC,Same with Sugar man. Where did he go? Is he running around the marvel U attacking Ant-man?
xmen,2s6ct1,megastonerd,5,Mon Jan 12 19:48:00 2015 UTC,"Haha Sugarman, also known as even creepier MODOK."
xmen,2s6ct1,drchasedanger,3,Tue Jan 13 04:50:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about Sugar Man, but I'm pretty sure Dark Beast just kinda snuck into 616 and hasn't been seen since the X-Treme X-Men and Age of Apocalypse crossover a while back that ended both series and I think also ended the entire Age of Apocalypse universe. It's been ages since I read any of it though, so I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. I did really love X-Treme X-Men, though. It was pretty much just like Exiles and it gave me some kinda Nightcrawler fix while 616 Kurt was still dead."
xmen,2s6ct1,cryrid,5,Mon Jan 12 23:55:17 2015 UTC,but I'm pretty sure Dark Beast just kinda snuck into 616 and hasn't been seen since the X-Treme X-Men and Age of Apocalypse crossover a while back that ended both series and I think also ended the entire Age of Apocalypse universe.    Dark Beast was in Uncanny XMen a few months ago.
xmen,2s6ct1,topo_gigio,3,Tue Jan 13 03:37:19 2015 UTC,Both AoA Nightcrawler and Dark Beast popped up in Uncanny X-Force a couple years back.
xmen,2s6ct1,drchasedanger,2,Tue Jan 13 01:18:44 2015 UTC,I believe that was before the story I'm talking about. AoA Kurt died at the end of it to seal the rift between that universe and 616.
xmen,2s6ct1,Nellisir,8,Tue Jan 13 01:34:28 2015 UTC,"Dark Beast just died in Uncanny X-Men. It was poorly handled, IMO, but whatever.  Sugar Man, I think, was last seen in New Mutants (vol.3), and got taken away into custody? I was pretty sure he was the big baddy in the recent X-Force comic, but nope. He always had a weird set of powers. Prehensile tongue, size changing, and genius IQ? Since AoA supposedly diverged from 616 when Xavier was killed, who is Sugar Man in 616?"
xmen,2s6ct1,fatalfuryguy,3,Tue Jan 13 04:24:38 2015 UTC,Worst death for a significant character imo. He was in the book for just half a panel I think.
xmen,2s6ct1,detourne,2,Tue Jan 13 11:55:41 2015 UTC,Yeah it was absolute bullshit.  Not quite the straw that broke the camels back for me.  But I stopped buying Uncanny and All-New X-Men soon after. Fuck Bendis.
xmen,2s6ct1,fatalfuryguy,2,Tue Jan 13 15:33:11 2015 UTC,He seems to be writing everything for marvel right now. What particular issues do you have with him? Besides his SLOW ASS pacing?
xmen,2s6ct1,detourne,3,Tue Jan 13 21:50:48 2015 UTC,"Decompressed writing style and what it's done to the industry. Stories take longer to come to conclusions, so there can be much less action in a single issue. This kind of elevates the writers position over the artist, as it seems we are waiting for the writer to say something for the artist to cut loose.  The result is issues of people just talking. If there are issues of people just talking, then we don't need true artistic storytellers, just people that can make photorealistic faces.  Look at the rise of people like Greg Land, or the amount of light boxing being done by people like Mike Deodato, or Adi Granov, Salvador Larocca.  These guys can really draw, but with the decompressed writing style they are stuck making pretty faces.  His inability to follow up on continuity or previous storylines. Whatever happened to Dazzler? Why wasn't her imprisonment and torture explained further? Whatever happened to Cyclops as a mutant revolutionary? His inability to write characters with an established voice. He usually needs to interject his own snarky voice into every single character when it doesn't fit. If he is having trouble with established characters, he usually pulls some bullshit to bring the story back into familiar territory for him (usually making guest stars of characters he has created). Look at how Maria Hill became such a big part of Uncanny X-Men, or how there was a crossover with Miles Morales in All-New. Both completely pointless and sidestepping the issues at hand."
xmen,2s6ct1,megastonerd,2,Tue Jan 13 22:59:51 2015 UTC,"Dark Beast just died in Uncanny X-Men. It was poorly handled, IMO, but whatever.   Awww for real?! That sucks. I wish they would just pull Bendis off the X-Books already, Is stopped pulling both UXM & ANX a while ago and look forward to picking it back up when he's gone."

xmen,2s6ct1,teh_longinator,2,Tue Jan 13 05:28:07 2015 UTC,"The Ultimate Universe Crossover (along with budget constraints) is the reason I dropped this book. I'll get the trades when they're cheap, but I didn't feel like I got my $20 out of this arc, and no end in sight :P"
xmen,2s6ct1,megastonerd,1 point,Tue Jan 13 06:15:19 2015 UTC,"You have to understand, I really wanted to love it, I did! But after Battle of the Atom it just felt contrived and gimmicky. I also don't love the way Bendis writes the original X-Men that much. I've liked Bendis on other titles (USM, DD, New Avengers) but I feel like his tenure on X-Men has been tepid at best.  edit: Goldballs is awesome tho."
xmen,2s6ct1,drchasedanger,2,Tue Jan 13 05:36:29 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not perfect, I'm just way too into time travel so this whole first class stuck in the past thing really gets me going. The main reason I still kinda like UXM is the weird characters like Goldballs and time-girl (blanking on the name right now). I'm also really digging what they're doing with Illyana training in the past with Dr Strange (and apparently becoming sorcerer supreme at some point?). My main gripe is that it's all a tad convoluted. I totally understand where you're coming from though."
xmen,2s6ct1,drchasedanger,1 point,Tue Jan 13 05:41:43 2015 UTC,"When was is that Dark Beast died? Was it in the middle of the storyline of the future X-Men coming back? That sounds right to me, but I read so many concurrent X-books that I get confused from time to time. It's a blessing because it's basically it's own separate universe (most of the time) within Marvel, but also a curse because there's so much shit to keep track of."
xmen,2s6ct1,JohnnyNewspaperseed,1 point,Tue Jan 13 05:30:47 2015 UTC,I feel like those brief character deaths are just for show. I hope we see him again. He was a great foil character and Hank doesn't have many (if any) of those.

From the marvel wikia:   Adamantium Laced Skeleton(Possibly Formerly): several times Sabretooth has had his natural mutation boosted by having his bones and claws laced with the indestructible synthetic metal known as adamantium. Once he had been implanted by Apocalypse but soon forcefully forfeited it back to him, who then transplanted it back into Logan. The second time he had his bones bonded was when Weapon X had been reinstated and captured him to commence with said molecular lacing procedure as well as kick his strength, speed and healing factor up a notch. But unlike Logan Sabretooth's bones did not have adamantium laced cartilage and ligaments meaning that his bones could be severed at the joints. It's possible that he had lost his indestructible frame since the Scarlet Witch's Reality Warp had been undone, but the Sabretooth that appeared during M-day story-line was a clone of the original. Indicating that the real thing may still retain his unbreakable bone structure [33]."

Eventually less time was given to character development and the classic villains of the series were done poorly, Phoenix and Apocalypse especially.   Having death be much more permanent in the Ultimate series sounded great, but the writers started to more casually kill off favorite X-men characters, something that came to a head with Ultimatum."

I always found it odd that Marvel would make a big point to create this new universe with things that were different and a streamlined continuity and then.....fall back on the classic stories and just re-imagine them. Seems like the perfect opportunity for a creative team to strike out and create something new...yet they seemed to get drawn back to the classic as if they were too afraid to take a chance (even though the Ultimate universe itself was a risk).  Then they also started popping in the Ultimate version of....everyone like mad, for a stretch it seemed like every issue had to have a new character introduced....not for the betterment of the story but just to have that character sitting around somewhere, they weren't even adding depth just another name to the roster (Watch out fans...next month is Ultimate Skids! In 2 short months, because you have all DEMANDED it...Ultimate Artie!!!) they didn't fit a need or even seem to be used in any significant manner.

xmen,2s2lz4,tehvolcanic,4,Tue Jan 13 01:50:25 2015 UTC,The beginning of Ultimate X-Men with Millar on the helm is really good. It had a lot of the same feel as the rest of the early Ultimate lines. Even when Bendis and Vaughan took over it was still good. It wasn't Kirkman came on that it started to suck.
xmen,2s2lz4,Redfoxyboy,2,Sun Jan 11 18:31:24 2015 UTC,The only problem with Kirkman's run is that he didn't know how long they were going to keep him on the book.  Coleite was originally going to be the next writer after BKV but had obligations on the TV show Heroes.  So Kirkman was brought in to fill in for a few issues.  Those few issues turned into almost 30 but he still never knew when his end was coming.  That's why the Apocalypse arc is so rushed at the end.  He had gotten too deep and had to wrap everything up too fast when Coleite was finally ready.
xmen,2s2lz4,megastonerd,1 point,Sun Jan 11 19:10:11 2015 UTC,"I could totally tell it was rushed, he alludes to an evil scientist and his large-scale plans, then the very next issue starts with the x-men in the middle of blowing up the lab and shutting down all the foreshadowing he did."

The meat of the plotline, the stuff you are suppose to really enjoy reading, is just over the top violence, sex, or ridiculous premises that turn the 616 character upside down. The meat and potatoes of the X-Men, being the fight against prejudice and what to do with power when you are given it, is absent from the story.   Instead there is a lot of implied relationships and brutal murders."

These are younger versions of the characters.  As for James Marsden, I'm torn. He's a good actor, and I think he was just working with some shoddy scripts and got written out of the second and third movies. But at the same time, he's typecast as the guy who loses his girl to a hairier guy, and I'd really like to avoid another Scott/Jean/Logan love triangle, especially if Jean's going to be younger."

If the next movie takes place in the 80's, it seems like those two are the closest to their full potential, because the rest of the X-men would be relatively young and inexperienced at this point, including Professor X, who has relatively recently regained his powers and is kind of getting over a drug habit.    I'm betting Apocalypse will probably make Wolverine a Horseman and give him his adamantium skeleton, and either possess Magneto or somehow keep him imprisoned with alien technology or something.  Making both of them Horsemen would also be pretty epic and would make the conflict between himself and Xavier pretty personal.  Also, I'd love to see some kind of riff on the Dark Beast, that would be great to see here and also another potential character to use in an X-force spinoff."

Started out an arrogant asshole, learned a bit about humility and valuing other people, later was willing to die to save everyone else, started having mental health issues but finally received a proper diagnosis and psychiatric help in a real world type way rather than via telepathy or the like, and after rejoining the x-men for a bit to prove himself quit the super hero game to use his powers for general humanitarian aid in disaster areas.   There's not a lot of characters whose stories have a distinct and satisfying beginning, middle and end. But thanks to his real power of getting comics canceled the second he appears in them, he somehow managed it. It just took about four or five decades of developing three issues at a time every ten years or so.   Seriously one of my favorite characters though. And I'm still missing Exiles Mimic, who also had a really well developed arc. Even if in my opinion the end was rather stupid.

xmen,2rpwch,cmoz25,1 point,Thu Jan 8 06:40:42 2015 UTC,How did you come to that conclusion?  Who put the spell there?  I'm just confused because it seems to have not been explained at all.

xmen,2rpwch,dead_wolf_walkin,5,Thu Jan 8 07:45:09 2015 UTC,"It's a line from Beast. They translate a line of Breakworld language to Rasputin or something like that and Beast realizes it's not a reference to Colossus, but rather Illyana....who's code name was Magic. Thus he theorizes that it has magic protection...  It's confirmed by Storm and Spider-Man on Earth who note the strongest people have been affected the most."
xmen,2rpwch,dead_wolf_walkin,1 point,Thu Jan 8 16:48:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying that, I do recall this conversation that you're referring to.  That just begs the question, how did Illyana even get involved with the Breakworld?    Although I do love this run, this particular bit seemed more of a clever contrivance to explain why the Avengers couldn't do anything to the bullet.  That was a letdown to me, I was really hoping for a an epic throwdown with EMH + X-Men + Whedon-quips vs. the Breakworld.  The ending with Kitty pulling through in the clutch was pretty good, although ultimately depressing."
xmen,2rpwch,thelastdaydawns,2,Thu Jan 8 17:50:38 2015 UTC,"I don't really think she was involved....it was just a misreading on the translation. They just translated the word 'Magic"" and the computers associated it with the X-men somehow....or something.....yeah it was just a plot device."

There's several hints over those few pages that I assume is where many people got that conclusion, unless it is stated explictly somewhere:   Fantastic Four shown to be stopping the bullet only for it to show Reed is in the trance. Kitty talking about the bullet affecting her.  Spider-Man knocking Storm out of the trance and shows the other heroes. ""You saved the world, right?...So did they.""

The sad/funny thing is I've purged down at least once (completely, after HS), maybe twice before I think....     Thinking this time I'll just keep the initial runs of most of the 80s books."
xmen,2rplrq,sgt_backpack,3,Thu Jan 8 04:39:13 2015 UTC,Nothing essential but the Uncanny run after Schism was really good. Make sure you read the Rengensis so you know how everything played out.

xmen,2rpvgf,JZA1,5,Thu Jan 8 06:15:48 2015 UTC,"The problem is, the x-men comics get kind of complicated at that point with a bunch of crossovers that feature a lot of characters.  I think the next major event following Whedon's run is Messiah Complex, which is very good but fairly mired in continuity.  You could try New X-men: Academy X which features almost all new characters so it makes for a good jumping on point and it also features some great comics in general. If you like Emma Frost I recommend this one in particular.  Alternatively, you could stick with Astonishing X-men, but it goes downhill for a bit until issue 48 or so."
xmen,2rpvgf,Showbuckle,4,Thu Jan 8 08:15:27 2015 UTC,"I second Showbuckle in saying New X-men: Academy X. Great book...but you gotta give it a few issues to kick in. It started out very teenie bopper, but once you get to the Craig Kyle/Chris Yost issues (they start at #20) it's one of the best X-books ever released IMO. You could actually skip the first chunk and just start reading at the Kyle/Yost takeover, but I think reading the issues that come before make the rest of them kick that much harder.   After hitting New X-men I'd jump to Mike Carey's X-men run starting with issue #188 and ending with issue #204. These books take place simultaneously with both Whedon's books and New X-men so you could do them next as well I guess.   Whichever order you read them, once you knock out both of these you're ready for Messiah Complex.  I could also suggest X-Factor to read before jumping into Messiah Complex as these characters are involved, but not in an overly major way.  Sorry if I got a little ranty.....but this era overall was probably my favorite run of X-books ever published......I REALLY miss these creative teams."
xmen,2rpvgf,dead_wolf_walkin,2,Thu Jan 8 13:49:52 2015 UTC,"this era overall was probably my favorite run of X-books ever published   I was actually thinking about this exact thing the other day, and I may have to agree with you. Mike Carey is probably my 2nd favorite x-men writer ever.  The only other times I can think of where all the titles were consistently strong were the early 80s with Paul Smith on Uncanny, Frank Miller on Wolverine, and the beginning of New Mutants.   Or possibly the late 80s with Adams or Silvestri on Uncanny, Simonson on X-Factor, and the beginning of Excalibur."

xmen,2rpvgf,Showbuckle,2,Thu Jan 8 20:08:24 2015 UTC,"I think that is because of House of M. He was dead in that reality, and that translated into him not having powers in the regular continuity after everything was restored. I'm not exactly sure why."

xmen,2rpvgf,dead_wolf_walkin,3,Thu Jan 8 15:04:11 2015 UTC,They take place after.   If you haven't read House of M yet then the read gets a little more complicated because it hits right in the middle of all of these.   Pretty much it breaks down like this in chronological order:   1st part of Whedon's Astonishing Run 1st part of New X-men (Written by DePhillips) House of M 2nd Part of Whedon's Astonishing Run 2nd Part of New X-men (Written by Kyle/Yost) Carey's X-men Run X-Factor Messiah Complex   Edit for formatting
xmen,2rpvgf,dead_wolf_walkin,1 point,Thu Jan 8 15:24:07 2015 UTC,"House of M takes place between Whedon's AXM runs?  This would make me want to ask if Kitty Pryde is carried away into space by the retaliator bullet, does that mean they count only 197 mutants after that point?   Am I understanding that correctly?"
xmen,2rpvgf,dead_wolf_walkin,6,Thu Jan 8 15:40:57 2015 UTC,"At one point during Whedon's run Wolverine is in the danger room with some of the students and gives a speech about kids losing their powers, then clicks the lights off.....I believe it's in the beginning of the Hellfire Arc. This is a reference to the events of House of M. So basically that story took place between the Danger and the Hellfire arcs.   So yeah, once Kitty is in the bullet there are only 197 mutants on Earth, but I wouldn't get too hung up on the 198 number anyways. It doesn't take long to start going up and down constantly as people die/resurrect/come out of hiding. If you try to keep track of how many mutants there are you'll go crazy."

Now I'm getting kinda confused, because I know Magneto is around for House of M, but I thought Wolverine cuts his head off toward the end of Morrison's run...does Magneto come back in a non-X issue or something?"
xmen,2rpvgf,xooxanthellae,3,Thu Jan 8 17:54:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah.....that's a whole thing.   Basically Morrison wanted to kill Magneto and Marvel didn't. So after Morrison left they said it wasn't Magneto....it was Xorn posing as Magneto...and Magneto was in hiding on Genosha...which is where you find him at the beginning of House of M.   The they introduced Xorn again....as a good guy....but said it was his brother.   Brian Micheal Bendis tried to fix the whole thing in New Avengers, but it just ended up worse.   Xorn isn't a real popular topic among X-fans....the whole thing was just a mess."

xmen,2rnyjq,JZA1,5,Wed Jan 7 20:38:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, man.    I have SOOOO many mixed feelings about this one.  This was during a very tumultuous time during the X-Books.  This was a few years after the relaunch of X-Men # 1 (still the best selling book of all-time, penned by Claremont and Lee, who'd already left within a year of that issue's publication), but before the Morrison era began.  The books were in peril.  Marvel editorial in general was purportedly encroaching more and more on writer's plots and plans, calling into question who was REALLY writing the books and who was merely scripting plots that did not originate with them (the writers).    Public response to mutants is at an all-time low in the MU.  Half the X-Men were out in space, fighting the Phalanx in the Shiar empire.  The other half (Cyclops, Jean, Wolverine, Cannonball, and Storm... and Jubilee, come to think of it) are captured by Bastion and Operation:  Zero Tolerance.  This leave Iceman--that's right, ICEMAN--to put together a ragtag team of reluctant mutants to save EVERYBODY.    On paper, that all sounds pretty good.  The story threads had been building since Onslaught ended, indeed Bastion had been introduced in the lead up to Onslaught.  As a fan who had been collecting single issues faithfully since at least 1990, I was very much engaged in the story that was about to kick-off.  It seemed like this was meant to lead to a new, Days of Future Past style interpretation, set in the present 616.  And Bobby Drake, after a few years of character development that showcased that his character had been actively holding back in regards to his powers, maturity, and overall development, was now about to ""step-up"" into a leadership role and effectively ""grow-up"".    The result?  Kinda fell through for me, as a fan.  In truth, I was more engaged in the aftermath of this story.  Granted, we didn't get Iceman growing up or anything (not only did he suck as a ""leader"", but he left the X-Men nearly 2 issues later), but we did get the X-Men stripped of all their resources and accouterments (Bastion had taken everything from the Mansion and sub-levels, including the Blackbird, the Danger Room, Cerebro,... hell, I think he even took the linoleum from the bathrooms); Cyclops with a BOMB in his chest; Wolverine having to REMOVE said bomb from Scott's chest... USING ONLY HIS CLAWS AND SOME HOT WATER; the return of the X-Men contingent from space (sans Gambit, for reasons); the O5 leaving the mansion, all while Jean fully accepts her Phoenix history; Logan and Ororo in charge of a very bare bones X-Men team including Rogue, Cannonball, Beast (I guess ALL the O5 didn't leave right away), Cecelia Reyes, Marrow... and two other guys who should probably remain nameless.    TL;DR - If you're an X-Men completest, and can find this story for cheap, go for it.  Otherwise, maybe read the original DOFP story to feed your Sentinel itch.  Or UXM 98 - 101 (which, admittedly, begins Jean's transformation to Phoenix, but does ostensibly start as a Sentinel story).  Or anything with Nimrod (including UXM 208 - 209, or UXM 246 - 247)."
xmen,2rnyjq,JargonPhat,3,Wed Jan 7 21:38:18 2015 UTC,"Great read!  Iceman does seem like a random leadership choice, like its more borne out of havent-done-anything-with-this-guy-lately mindset.  Thanks for the recommendations regarding Nimrod as well.  I'm a little surprised and disappointed that there aren't more Sentinel-centric arcs.  I kinda wish Grant Morrison had gone all-out on a Sentinel arc and really show off all sorts of clever Sentinel designs above and beyond what he had already introduced with Cassandra Nova, nanosentinels, and fantomex/EVA."
xmen,2rnyjq,KrisNoble,3,Thu Jan 8 04:08:15 2015 UTC,The Wolverine Zero Tolerance issues are interesting in how subdued they are and have art from Lienil Yu back before he changed his drawing style.
xmen,2rnyjq,apalehorse,3,Fri Jan 9 01:51:24 2015 UTC,"Harsh but fair, although I actually did enjoy most of it as a read.  You're bang on with Iceman though, seemed like he was finally about to step up, but the fact that he ended up quitting I think (or maybe prefer to think) of it as continuing the character development a little, like he just couldn't hack it, he didn't have the maturity or whatever and bottled it."
xmen,2rnyjq,Koosh25,3,Fri Jan 9 16:10:48 2015 UTC,"well, it's basically the only time that the writers have ever allowed iceman to be useful.  so if you'd like to see iceman do something more than slide around in the background, read it."
xmen,2rfnc5,JZA1,9,Mon Jan 5 20:21:29 2015 UTC,"It was a blitzkrieg. Everything went to shit pretty quickly. And Magneto was still incapacitated from Eve of Destruction. One criticism I'd throw out there is, what about precogs (like Negasonic Teenage Warhead)? In a world where there are lots of people with the ability to see into the future, why did nobody see it happening? Why didn't Destiny write about in one of her diaries? At the end of the day it seems to be a case of Morrison needing something to really shock the status quo and set up a new dangerous world for the X-Men to exist in. On the note of it not being brought up again, while Morrison doesn't touch on it too much, there was a whole series (Excalibur Vol. 3) about the general trauma attempted restoration of the island. It also gets brought up here and there by other writers in other X-books."
xmen,2rfnc5,Paulitically_Correct,2,Tue Jan 6 01:06:39 2015 UTC,"Cool, I'll have to check for it in another x-book.  I agree with what you said about the précogs predicting the massacre.  It seems like an event like this should have compelled any genoshan telepaths to have some kind of psychic distress cry, and mutants all over the world would have responded to help.  It seems like this should've been the kind of epic battle that Morrison should've ended with."

It was remarkable in that it had an entirely brand new cast of characters that weren't invulnerable to the dangers of superhero adventures. Main characters died. A lot. Peter Milligan writing and Mike Allred on art made for a good combo.

The mutants are selfish celebrities, worried more about fame than helping people. X-Corp is run by a greedy CEO. It's some serious satire, poking fun at the commercialization of comics and American culture in general.   And, at the same time, eventually they have redeeming qualities, you end up caring about the characters, and it's a really good story.   I love Milligan.

Jean Grey, Professor X, Legion, Nate Grey, Cable, Rachel Summers, Kid Omega, Psylocke and Emma Frost would be able to hold down the Justice League with psychic power (save for maybe J'onn J'onzz, but he's easily neutralised by any pyrokinetic), and then the other powerful X-Men like Storm, Iceman, Gambit, Cyclops etc. could pretty much just lay waste to them.  For the more indestructible types like Superman, Rogue could just take their power and then destroy them with it while they're still under a psychic hold.  Of course, Phoenix-level Jean Grey could basically just wish them all out of existence, as could a couple of others who've flirted with reality-warping powers."

His uncle was a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and was ambushed and murdered by poachers a short time after his arrival in Canada. After the death of his uncle, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police sent Logan to live in a home run by nuns and as soon as he was old enough, he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force, landing in the same outfit as Creed H. Quinn. Both Logan and Creed were submitted to the Weapon X project, the Canadian Super-Soldier program. It was here that Logan had adamantium bonded to his bones and he learned of his metamutant nature.

As the character developed, his abilities were enhanced in order to maintain the interest of his audience. The extent of his powers peaked during the 1970s and 80's, to the point where it became difficult to create suitable challenges for the character. As a result, his powers were significantly reduced when his story was rebooted by writer John Byrne after the Crisis on Infinite Earths series. After Byrne's departure, Superman's powers were gradually increased again, although he still remains weaker than his Pre-Crisis incarnation.

xmen,2r8pxu,Laragon,0,Mon Jan 5 00:33:17 2015 UTC,Bullshit. That's happened many times in virtually every iteration of the DC universe.  The only reason it doesn't happen more is that powerful telepaths seem not to be a common thing in DC comics.
xmen,2r8pxu,daavoo,14,Tue Jan 6 01:31:50 2015 UTC,"I'd argue they'd do better than The Avengers.  The Justice League has Superman, Batman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Cyborg, Martian Manhunter, Wonderwoman and Hawkgirl/man/whatever.  The Psychics alone could handle the Justice League, since they aren't really all that immune to Psychic powers (afaik). If we remove the Professor X / Jean Grey types, then it becomes slightly more interesting.   Superman would obviously be the biggest threat, although Rogue could theoretically beat him I guess? The Flash vs. Quicksilver would probably end up in a victory for the Flash (dude can time travel, not sure if QS can do that). Mimic could probably handle him though. Batman is essentially fucked. Essentially any of the mutants on the team could handle him. For arguments sake, I'll mention Nightcrawler, Wolverine, and Storm. Green Lantern. Very powerful, but again, could be taken out by Vulcan or Sunfire.  Cyborg gets torn apart by Magento (if you count him). If not, well I'm sure Forge would be a great matchup, or Bishop. Martian Manhunter is weak against fire....so pick your poison there. Wonderwoman is essentially female Superman, so again Rogue would probably give her a run for her money. Northstar too.  Green Arrow is screwed vs. anyone. Let's say he fight's Cyclops or Kitty Pride, or Iceman, or Colossus.  Hawkgirl vs. Archangel would be interesting.   Again, these matchups are all moot, because once you throw in Pheonix, Professor X, Xorn (Jean Grey from the future?) and any of the other Psychics, it's probably game over.  sauce"

xmen,2r8pxu,a_random_hobo,2,Sun Jan 4 10:27:58 2015 UTC,It's also a common trope that a carefully prepared adversary infiltrates the X-Mansion and disables the X-Men one after the other. ;)

xmen,2r8pxu,Iamcaptainslow,2,Mon Jan 5 22:10:11 2015 UTC,"I agree that of the psychics were to fight, the Justice League would have a hard time winning. A few points of contention:   Superman isn't just a superhuman, he's a ridiculously powerful alien. Even if Rogue's powers did work on him, she might not be able to touch him because of his ""tactile telekinesis"" shield, the invisible aura around his body that prevents contact with anything (how his uniform stays in one piece, unless it's a really big fight) I don't see how Batman would be ""fucked."" He's fought superhumans before, and the main disadvantage he'd face against Wolverine and Nightcrawler is the lack of the element of surprise. Wolverine can smell him if he's near, and Nightcrawler can disappear and reappear any time Batman tries to attack. However, I think Batman is smart enough to figure out a way to beat them. I'm not imagining a gladiator-style battle, I'm imagining an all-out war where Batman would have full access to his wealth of technology. It's probable he could figure out a way to counteract or neutralize Nightcrawler's powers. Wolverine, though one tough motherfucker and one of my favorite Marvel characters, doesn't seem like he'd be guaranteed a victory. Once Batman figured out that he had healing powers, he'd be able to fight him accordingly and likely just enact some sort of all-out, brute-force attack against Wolverine, rather than go up against him hand-to-hand (Batman is pretty much the best martial artist around, but Wolverine is fast, strong, intelligent, experienced, and nigh-indestructible- can't kill him, so no harm in firing a few rockets at him and then freezing him with a Mr. Freeze-type cold gun). Storm... I don't see why she'd be fighting Batman, and I guess I can't really see how that would turn out. She's pretty powerful, and Batman probably wouldn't be able to get close enough for hand-to-had. Seems like Batman would leave her to someone better suited to take her down (he who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day).  Green Arrow is definitely not screwed against ""anyone."" He might not have the skill for taking down superhumans that Batman does, but he's a highly skilled martial artist, and basically the greatest archer in the world (miles ahead of Hawkeye). He can hit a moving target he size of a quarter while falling off of a roof. Cyclops may be powerful, but one arrow to his eyewear may spell trouble for him (not that I'd feel bad about that, the prick) and any other X-Men around him. Colossus, well, he's a hard man to take down, Green Arrow would have a hell of a time with that. There are his special arrows, of course (explosive, shock, net, etc.) but I doubt even the explosive ones would faze Colossus. Is he vulnerable to electricity? I forget. Either way, Green Arrow may be one of the only non-superpowered Justice League members, but that doesn't mean he's a scrub."

xmen,2r8pxu,WaitingForGobots,11,Mon Jan 5 20:45:35 2015 UTC,"I have a Question for all of the theories that Rogue would be able to steal Superman's power.  Is her power to absorb other powers limited to mutant ability? In that case, she might not be able steal a power that is related to someone's molecular density. Superman does not have mutant abilities. His power is derived from being an alien on a planet with different sun from his home planet. I think Justice League would stand strong against the X-men. I would love to see a shot of Superman's vs. Cyclops, Jean Grey vs. Martian Manhunter, Rogue Vs WonderWoman, Storm vs. Green Lantern, Aquaman vs. Iceman, And Wolverine vs. Batman."
xmen,2r8pxu,vibraxis,9,Mon Jan 5 21:15:05 2015 UTC,It's definitely not limited to mutant ability. Ms. Marvel is not a mutant.

I suspect that it'd be written as her being able to begin absorbing Supe's power, but that it'd knock her out after she wound up draining enough to make him less overpowered in the fight. Basically that she'd be used as plot point to nerf him and then removed from the fight."

In the storyline in Justice League featuring Maxwell Lord, a (compared to X-Men standards) barely passable telepath  (his powers required pretty intense focus and gave him chronic nosebleeds whenever they were used), he was wreaking all sorts of havoc and no one had any reasonable defenses against him, and the only resort they had was eventually for Wonder Woman to snap his neck and kill him. There's a very real lack of telepathic protection/preparation in the DC universe.

Superman would be the toughest out of the basic JL lineup to deal with, but if they could gang up a few X-Men on him that match some of his powers then he would fall.

Strong Guy vs Aquaman, because taking too many punches from Superman would give Guido another heart attack.  Longshot vs J'onn J'onnz, because Longshot's luck power would cause J'onn to spontaneously combust, assuming his motives were pure enough.

xmen,2r8pxu,Nellisir,2,Sun Jan 4 05:48:38 2015 UTC,"If I were overestimating the mutants and underestimating the JLA, I'd have matched up Quicksilver with the Flash.  My thinking with Shatterstar and Siryn is that out of everyone on that particular team, without throwing in ringers who were only members for a few issues (Havok) or only at the end of the run (Polaris), those two stand some chance against heavy hitters like Green Lantern and the Flash.  Neither Flash nor GL is immune to sonics.  Siryn's emotional manipulation ability, while it wouldn't take either man out, would slow them down and give her a shot.  Shatterstar can open dimensional portals that could give either a speedster or an energy wielder a bad day.  He's fast enough to dodge or deflect lasers, and when his swords are charged they can slice through things swords normally wouldn't, like energy constructs.  Neither Shatterstar or Siryn are anywhere near a slam dunk, but they at least have a shot."

It was really only to set things up for Alex's run in Uncanny Avengers, and Lorna being in the current incarnation of X-Factor.  (And maybe as a Valentine for fans of PAD's first X-Factor run.)

I'm not sure if the PAD X-Factor group (which was one of my favorite X-titles) is good for this exercise considering how all over the place the team was during the run. Rictor went from depowered back to powered; Siryn became a god; Strong Guy loses his soul and then becomes the lord of hell; Darwin becomes a god of death or something; Layla was a kid, then was gone, then was a young woman; pretty much everyone was emotionally unstable.

xmen,2r8pxu,dr_spider,3,Tue Jan 6 01:22:45 2015 UTC,"An important thing to consider is that there are far more high-powered X-Men that are willing to lead with lethal force than there are Leaguers who are ready to do the same. Many of the X-men are unrepentant killers, even the ones that bafflingly condemn those actions in others. Pretty sure even rather benign characters like Beast or Jubilee have killed people, and would do so again. Most Leaguers have a moral code, or measure their attacks until they're able to gauge the toughness of their adversaries. The X-Men have a hit squad that kills children.  Sure, you have cosmic energy constructs, Speed Force, and Superman on the League's side, not to mention Batman's power of ""being the awesomest and beating everyone, no matter what""... but when you have telekinetic psychics that have direct manipulation of matter, who have no problems with atomizing you or performing a lobotomy from across the globe as a go-to attack, well.. Not to mention the several mutants who powers involve literally creating or negating energy from nothing..  Also consider that mutants who initially display low-level power-sets are usually just one meltdown away from discovering that their abilities run a lot deeper. Iceman's power involves robbing kinetic energy from matter, without having to transfer it anywhere. Gambit has already used his powers to move through time. Cyclops's eyes are apertures to a dimension of of concussive force.. You see where I'm going here. Plus you have characters like Wolverine, who has an editorial mandate similar to Batman's. also, you have former villains like Magneto and Rogue, who have casually taken out teams like the Avengers single-handed.  The only weakness that the X-Men have that the JL doesn't is mortality. Only popular characters, like Wolverine, are allowed to be immortal on the battlefield. You can shoot, choke, stab, or break the bones of any given X-Men, even the most powerful. Superman, Flash, Wonder Woman, Manhunter.. They can soak up ridiculous amounts of damage and heal fast, so it's difficult to take them out of the game. I think that the JL could probably wear the X-men down eventually, if the X-Men failed to preemptively kill the Leaguers outright."

xmen,2r8pxu,dr_spider,2,Sun Jan 4 07:27:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes. From Wikipedia:   Appearing in the 1999 Gambit mini-series, Gambit is called New Son (Sun) (X-Cutioner II) in Earth-9923 reality. In his own reality, the New Sun's kinetic charging powers had flared out of control, burning the world and killing everyone. As a result, the New Sun hunted down and killed versions of himself in other realities to ensure that they would not repeat his mistakes. New Sun is not limited to inorganic matter and can convert matter into energy at a sub-molecular level so it vaporizes or explodes. He also has the ability to time travel, can propel himself by a wave-like aura and can transplant matter through time and space, as well as being able to biokinetically augment all his physical abilities to superhuman levels.  In this reality, New Sun was never adopted by the Thieves Guild, so his real name is not ""Remy LeBeau"". New Sun was raised with his full power and intended to become the fulfillment of an ancient Guild prophecy to create Heaven on Earth. However, things went wrong when he charged up his power in a special ritual—a chain reaction was started that caused everyone on Earth beside himself to burn up. Failing to remake time, the New Sun traveled to other universes, hoping to prevent the same thing from happening there. However, he found many worlds in ruins, often because of that world’s version of Gambit. Coming to the main Marvel Universe (616), he first attempted to create a new world where everyone would eventually be transported to, using the main reality’s Gambit to help (without revealing to him who he truly was). When he learned that his plan wasn’t possible, he tried to kill Gambit, transporting both of them to his destroyed homeworld before Gambit became a threat to the main universe’s Earth world as well. During their final conflict, Gambit finally blasted the New Sun, burning out his recently increased powers, just as the New Sun died. Due to New Sun's immense power, it is speculated that New Sun was an omega-level mutant in his home dimension, and likely mutant alpha on Earth-9923; this, however, cannot be confirmed.   Additionally, after being temporarily blinded, Gambit became precognitive; this suggests that his powers extend far beyond just making things explode, and that any existing limitations are self-imposed. The latter idea seems to extend to any and all mutants whose powers involve energy manipulation-- they're all potentially omnipotent beings who are held back simply due to physical or emotional barriers."

The thing you may not know about the Justice League is that they have faced every threat the universe can throw at them. They have a variety and flexibility at seven members most teams can only muster at double digits. They have tackled everything from a tyrant sun to the very face of Armageddon. Superman has wrestled with angels, Wonder Woman is a goddess. Batman and J'Onn combined are the masters of strategy and tactics, with mental coordination at top form. Lantern is inspiration given form. Namor, Prince of Atlantis? Meet Arthur, your king. Flash is the fastest man alive. Even without a connection to the Speed Force, he would still top out at 700 MPH on metagene alone. These seven know how to fight, and they will win.

xmen,2r8pxu,meltypeeps,2,Sun Jan 4 07:43:49 2015 UTC,"Let's use the the original members of both teams when they were first introduced:  X-men: Professor-X, Cyclops - at his most innocent, Marvel Girl (Jean Grey) - at her ""weakest"", Beast - at his ""weakest"", Iceman - when he was more snow than ice, and Angel.  Justice Leauge (of America): Superman - very powerful, but not at his ""most"" powerful, Wonder Woman - hasn't changed much over the years, the Original Green Lantern, the Original Flash, and Hawkguy(?) (remember, Batman was never an official member of the JLA, so you can't use him).  Using this criteria I think the JLA would win hands down. All the members have previous fighting experiance before teaming up. There is a mild advantage with the x-men learing to control their powers and learning to be a team at the same time, but they are still not as experianced as the JLA. Though they aren't aware of it  both Superman and Jean Grey are essentially ""invincible."" I believe it would end with Superman ""dead"" (like when he fought Doomsday), the Professor brain dead from keeping the Pheonix from awakening and destroying the universe - his consienceness now in Jean's head - and Jean in a coma helping Charles.

Outside of that, the original X-Men are literally a bunch of school children, of course there's absolutely no contest between them and the JLA. That's not even a very popular line up, let alone powerful.   The Phoenix is a sort of cosmic god that didn't even know Jean existed until the X-Men went out into space. It certainly wasn't with her during the original X-Men team line-up. During the phoenix saga, it wasn't Jean possessed by the Phoenix, it was just the Phoenix pretending to be Jean. Actual Jean with Phoenix Force didn't happen until some time after that.   All this is to say that no, Jean is not unknowingly invincible. Jean didn't have anything to do with the phoenix until long after the original team.

It was exposure to some kind of space radiation that did it in the comics.

xmen,2r8pxu,meltypeeps,3,Sun Jan 4 23:34:29 2015 UTC,"She would though; she did. The space rays made her Phoenix ""all at once"" in a similar sort of way. She used the power to save the X-Men (as I recall), repair the M'Kraan Crystal and then ""voluntarily restrained"" most of it away so she wouldn't have any problems with being too powerful, returning to earth as a still-really-powerful-but-not-godlike version of Phoenix. She did not need Professor X's help to do any of that.   So fighting the JLA, if she suddenly attained Phoenix power, she's probably use it to neutralize them and then voluntarily seal most of the power away in exactly the same manner."

xmen,2r8pxu,Slowmexicano,0,Mon Jan 5 04:08:45 2015 UTC,"Martian Manhunter has centuries of telepathic training. MMH has connected with every single living person on the planet, Xavier couldn't even do that with every single mutant using Cerebro. And Quentin is a punk who would rather use a psychic shotgun than cool psychic tricks like the Cuckoos. Comparing MMH to Xavier is like comparing a Ph.D in telepathy to an elementary school student.  MMH also counters Kitty with intangibility, and Kitty only does the molecule meld thing in dire circumstances like WWH.    Elixer hasn't been an X-man for years, and again that's not his style.    Magik tends to be pretty controlled. But if we're picking random members, Dr. Fate is basically Dr. Strange of DC, I'm sure he hard counters her. Zatanna too.    Scarlet Witch has never been an X-men."

xmen,2r8pxu,Laragon,1 point,Mon Jan 5 20:33:26 2015 UTC,"Beyond the already mentioned matchups, I'd love to see Iceman take on the Flash. People forget that Bobby is an Omega level mutant who was able to manhandle Thor (when he was controlled by Emma Frost) - it'd be interesting to see if he could ""slow down"" the Flash's vibrations.  Really though, it depends on prep time and the nature of the battle (where it's taking place, are they blood lusted, etc.). Superman and the Flash are FAST. Like, really, really fucking fast. Far faster than anything Marvel has. It's very possible they blitz the X-Men before they even know what hits them. When Flash can move faster than any of the X-Men can react, they're not going to be able to lock him down with telepathy.  If both teams are blood lusted, I have to give it to the JL. Superman and Flash will just murder them all before they can react. If not, the X-Men have some chance."

xmen,2r8pxu,Supersecretsword,1 point,Mon Jan 5 20:03:28 2015 UTC,Agreed. Any of the four are much faster than thought and could shut down the telepaths at once.
xmen,2r8pxu,Laragon,1 point,Mon Jan 5 22:41:08 2015 UTC,"Justice League wins most fights since Flash is by his very nature completely overpowered. Cable can also travel through time but he lacks super speed and he's the only X-Man who can some close to handling him just by sharing one of the reasons why Flash wins. Even if Rogue, Colossus and Wolverine can handle Superman and Wonder Woman, Flash is the single most OP character in comics. He's a win button. The only character in the Marvel U who could even be a match for Flash is Living Laser who travels at the speed of light and cant' break the Light Barrier.  And if the Justice league fought the Avengers, Magdalene is the only one who can come close to winning by virtue of time travel. Flash is able to easily solo both Thor and Hulk.  Keep in mind that this is why I prefer Marvel. Nobody is completely overpowered in the Marvel U except for villains like Dormammu, Galactus and Beyonder. The closest thing to an OP hero in the Marvel U is Sentry and he's completely insane and easy to fool. Doctor Strange is weak in a physical fight, particularly when guns are involved. Strang may know how to kick but he can't throw a punch without seriously messing up his hands. Thor needs Mjolnir or Jarnbjorn to keep his power level at peak. Hulk needs to be angry to reach his peak. Deadpool can't die but he can lose fights. Cable and Wolverine are effectively immortal but they're still killable. Spider-Man has Spider-Sense but he's lost fights to Dock Ock, Venom, Carnage and Kraven. Captain America has enhanced senses but he still dies when you shoot him. Thing, Luke Cage and Colossus are nearly unbreakable but if you do manage to do some damage, they're looking at life-threatening injuries that are slow to heal with possible internal damage that may require surgery. Iron Man can be taken out for an EMP. Human Torch isn't very smart. Storm panics in enclosed areas and is useless indoors. etc. The only hero in the Marvel U who lacks any crippling weaknesses is Daredevil and even then his powers make him illiterate so he can't read unless its braille and everyone around him dies horribly. It absolutely sucks to be Daredevil. The Marvel heroes all have drawbacks that the DC heroes don't possess. DC is a total power fantasy. Marvel is a critique of power fantasies."

xmen,2r890d,HxH21,7,Sat Jan 3 19:51:06 2015 UTC,The Mutant Massacre starts around 210 and is pretty great.
xmen,2r890d,Zthe27th,4,Sat Jan 3 20:56:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think you' ve gotten to the Asgardian saga yet, but that was pretty epic (if condensed).    Z already mentioned the Mutant (Morlock) Massacre, but I feel that the story that precedes it doesn't quite get enough press.  It's the X-Men vs the Hellfire Club (I know, you've probably seen a couple of iterations of that by this point).  I don't want to give away the ending, but you do get something new by the end.    Fall of the Mutants shortly after that.    The Outback era.    Genosha.    Inferno!    UXM 246-247 offer an amazing X-Men vs Nimrod story.    By this point in the narrative, the X-Men have seen their roster gutted.  Thus begins one of my favorite eras in X-Men history (YMMV).  From roughly UXM 250 - 275, the X-Men are all split up across the globe, some believed to be dead, others amnesiac.  Stories involve X-Men searching for other X-Men in the hopes of putting the team back together again.  (Spoiler alert:  spoiler ) All in time for the Shadow King to take over Muir Island and require all the X's (Men and Factor) to try and stop him."
xmen,2r890d,JargonPhat,2,Sat Jan 3 21:15:21 2015 UTC,"Trial of Magneto in 200. I love this story as it's a great single issue that really redeems Magneto's character. He doesn't change so much as actually grow and makes peace with Xavier. It's a great, ""passing the torch"" issue that offers closure while keeping things in character and remains bittersweet the whole way through.  X-Factor #1 (get the Phoenix Rising Trade). Yeah, it's a cop out and also the first in a long line of handwaved resurrection stories that would go on to affect Cable, Nightcrawler, Colossus and Psylocke in future stories to the point where death becomes meaningless.  Wounded Wolf in 205. This is by far one of the best fight scenes in comics period. I feel like only Stan Lee and Steve Ditko could have done better. Lady Deathstrike is introduced and proves herself to be one of Wolverine's greatest foes in a short period of time. Everything about this issue from the atmosphere to the way that panels are structured works perfectly.  Then the crossover era that ran from 1986-1997  Mutant Massacre. This is a great crossover that sets up Sinister as a future threat, introduces Sabretooth to the X-Men and crosses over with Thor, Power Pack and Daredevil. It's less about the actual massacre itself and more about the aftermath. It's about when the villains win and how the X-Men are left to deal with wounded civilians which is what makes them truly heroes.  Fall of the Mutants - This is three stories in one. I read two of them and the one running through X-Factor brings for Apocalypse in all his glory and shifts the focus away from Scott and Jean to Archangel and Iceman and it works. Uncanny's story is about Storm and is still the best Storm story to date. It deals with her without powers and how that affects her while also throwing in a world-destroying demon and a love story at the same time. The downside is that most writers after Claremont are so daunted by this arc that her character development all but stopped after he left the book. Still, this is THE Storm story.  Welcome to Genosha. At the time it was intended to be a commentary on South African apartheid. It still works today regarding labor laws in Dubai. I won't spoil much for you but I'll state outright that Rogue temporarily being depowered winds up becoming one of the most traumatic experiences of her life (thankfully the most gruesome parts happen off panel).  Inferno. What Fall of the Mutants did for Storm, Inferno does for Cyclops. The whole Scott/Jean/Madelyne thing comes to a head, Sinister's entire arc is fulfilled and somehow Jean's entire story with the Phoenix Force is simplified so she is now bonded with it and has all the memories from 100 through Dark Phoenix. It's also a fascinating look into Havok's mind and how he relates to his brother.  Judgment War - The Celestials are usually more involved with the Eternals but here they go up against X-Factor for the sake of an alien world with the fate of Nathan hanging in the balance.  Cable leading the New Mutants. Simonson doesn't write Cable nearly as well as Necieza later will and Rob Liefeld draws everyone so their body type changes from panel to panel and that isn't getting into how every villain who isn't named Stryfe or Dragoness is both an eyesore and bland at the same time. It's still an important arc, it still redefined comics and it still introduced a vital new character.  The incredible era of X-Tinction Agenda, Endgame, Muir Island Saga and then X-Cutioner's Song. This is by far one of the best eras for the X-Men period. The only downside is Liefeld on X-Force which is some of the worst art I've seen in my entire life although Fabian Necieza's writing more than makes up for it. X-Factor by Peter David is also one of the funniest X-Men comics you'll ever encounter.  Fatal Attractions is a story that most fans love but I don't particularly care for since it feels like a retread of Mutant Genesis. It has some stuff with Wolverine that really defines his character until the early 2000s but Magneto doesn't come across as being as evil as he could and seems to be somewhat justified here with the X-Men coming across as aggressors. It's not helped by the Externals and Upstarts subplots going nowhere but eating up panel space that could be used to further explore Magneto and the Acolytes. This is the part where other writers and editors really ruin Adjectiveless. Cyclops gets shipped off to Cable's solo title, Wolverine leaves the X-Men entirely and then Beast transfers to uncanny. That leaves the supposed flagship title with only Rogue, Gambit and Psylocke. Gambit gets no development while Psylocke gets put in a confusing arc with Kwannon which is beyond convoluted to the point where I still don't understand most of it. I'm also not a fan of JRJR's art on this story. I like him on Iron Man, Daredevil, Hulk and Spider-Man but the main problem with his X-Men work is that he isn't as good of a storyteller here as he usually is and his blocky art style doesn't mesh with desaturated pastel colors. Andy Kubert's early work also isn't all that great but Fatal Attractions is the point where he grows as an artist and his flaws start beginning to disappear. I'm in the minority here for not liking it so take what I say with a grain of salt. On the plus side, Fabian Necieza's Cable run takes place concurrently and that's really more of a Cable/Cyclops series that explores the bond between the two of them.  Jean and Scott's wedding. I love this arc. JRJR's art improves here, Adam Kubert finally becomes great and we get to see Jubilee's growth as a character. By this point she's finally matured and begins to stand on her own. That and Cable finally gets the closure he needs.  Phalanx Covenant. This is where Joe Mad starts drawing Uncanny and he's still my all time favorite X-Men artist. Wolverine and Cyclops reunite while Jubilee gets some new classmates to launch Generation X. The art showcased here is the absolute best it's been since the era I mentioned loving above except without Liefeld. It's three stories that all interlock but taken as a whole, I love what was done, particularly with Banshee.  Age of Apocalypse. Often considered to be an even better follow-up to Days of Future Past, this is an incredibly long story but the payoff is worth it. I'd personally forgo the omnibus in favor of the trades (including the prelude) to get the entire story in sequence. The entire Marvel Universe is reimagined and now it's up to Bishop to set things right.  Onslaught. This is more than an X-Men story. It involves the entire Marvel Universe but the X-Men are at the core of it. I'd recommend reading Fatal Attractions first just to get the context. I won't spoil it for you but we learn who the traitor within the X-Men was.  Operation Zero Tolerance. It had been a while since the X-Men fought the Sentinels and OZT is the last real Sentinel story for quite some time.  It's also the last good story period. After this, Lobdell runs out of steam, Joe Mad keeps doing gorgeous art but then his muscles grow overlarge to the point of self-parody and then the entire franchise was just drifting for a few years."

I'm wondering where to even start with regards to comics and graphic novels. I read messiah complex when it came out and really enjoyed it but that's all I've read. Should I read graphic novels or comics? Which series and in what order? I really like the more obscure mutants. I've read other posts on here talking about which to read and in what order but I still feel like I'll be missing key components because I'm new to the comics/novels. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Again sorry for the way I posted this. Thank you much. Oh and for what it's worth, favorite x-men: iceman, angel, night crawler, sunfire, banshee, jubilee."
xmen,2r890d,poonjam,2,Sun Jan 4 04:47:21 2015 UTC,"So as to comics vs graphic novels(TPB) it just depends how current you want to be. I don't mind being behind so I read TPBs. They seem to be about 6 months behind. Some series will have a hardback edition come out then a paper back a few months later. Again I do TPB because you can find them cheap online, and I don't mind being behind. Plus they look better on a bookshelf. Now, there are ways out there to make single issues look nice on a bookshelf.   Another option, if you have a tablet is Marvel Unlimited. Its $10/month of $70/year. Some people have had problems with the app, I have not. I describe to people as the Netflix for comics. Marvel puts issues up 6 months after they come out. So much like buying single issues you get new stuff to read every week.   If you just want to read X-Men A good jumping on point is Avengers vs X-Men from a few years ago. Then there was AvX consequences which picks up after that. That leads into Uncanny X-Men and All-New X-Men. I would read those in the order they were released. A good tool for that is the Marvel Unlimited app. You can see what came out in what order during each month. You don't have to pay to look the releases dates.   Iceman and Angel are running around in All New X-Men and Uncanny X-Men. Nightcrawler was in, or may still be in not sure, Amazing X-Men. This you can just go pick up. You don't need really too much knowledge before reading it. He then has his own series, but it is about to end. Jubilee is in a series just called X-Men. It is a all female team, I jumped into that without reading too much history. Sometimes I got lost just because I didn't know who some of the people were. But you can google and read their wiki page. You may also want to check out X-Men Curse of the Mutants for another story that changes Jubilee.   Hope that helps and makes sense. If you had to get one answer out of me on where to start. It would be, get a tablet then Marvel Unlimited. Put things in order of release date starting with AvX. You can see what you like. Then when you are caught up on there check a comic shop for the currents issues. Or once you get caught up with what they have on there read older stuff while waiting for more stuff to get released on there. If you want physical stuff to read. TPBs. Sometimes you can get them cheap used. Or other sites offer them cheap new. Way cheaper than a comic shop.   Also listen to Rachel and Miles Explain the X-Men. They are up to about issue 190 starting from the beginning and do a pretty good job recapping the series.     Again, I just kinda rambled here. Hope it makes sense. Anything else just ask. If you want a something like a guide on what TPBs to buy to get caught up let me know and I will work on something later today."

Nightcrawler had his own limited series back in the day and more recently. Banshee is in the early issues of Uncanny.  Here's my cut & paste response for every time this is asked ---  I recommend starting with Chris Claremont's run that made the X-Men popular --- Giant Size X-Men #1, Uncanny X-Men #94-280, the graphic novel ""God Loves, Man Kills"", and X-Men: Vignettes 1 & 2.   This is an extremely helpful site: http://crushingkrisis.com/collecting-x-men-comic-books-as-graphic-novels/  There's also a good documentary about Chris Claremont's X-Men: http://sequart.org/movies/4/comics-in-focus-chris-claremonts-x-men/  If you want to skip around rather than reading every issue, here are my favorite story arcs, in chronological order:   Proteus (Uncanny 125-128) -- their first really dangerous enemy; I highly recommend the trade paperback which has some great additional stories Dark Phoenix Saga (Uncanny 129-137) -- widely considered the best ever, not my favorite though Days of Future Past (Uncanny 141-142) -- Kitty travels back in time from a dystopian future God Loves, Man Kills (graphic novel) -- possibly the best place for a newcomer to start The Brood Saga (Uncanny 154-158, 161-167) -- a mix of Alien & The Matrix, includes the first meeting of Magneto & Professor X (#161) and the first meeting of the X-men & Rogue Wolverine (Claremont/Miller limited series 1-4) -- the first Wolverine comics, must-read From the Ashes (Uncanny 168-176) -- one of Joss Whedon's favorite runs; Wolverine's wedding; Rogue joins the X-Men; Storm gets a mohawk Havok & Wolverine: Meltdown (limited series 1-4) -- highly recommended, great artwork Inferno (Uncanny 239-243, ties in with X-Factor etc) -- typical sprawling X-over, the X-Men issues are better than the X-Factor & New Mutants etc. Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men run 1-24 (the Warren Ellis run after this is also good). The Whedon run also has an amazing motion comic partially available on Netflix."

I just don't think that anything compares to the 100-200 era, particularly the Claremont/Byrne stuff that is now so essential to the entire X-Men mythology.  The thing about 201-300 is that it begins to plant the seeds of X-Men expanding too far for its own good. X Factor, New Mutants, Excalibur, etc., was all well and good for a while. But the further the 1990s progressed, the more unfocussed and unplanned the entire X-franchise seemed to become.  Essentially, it became too big and eventually suffered for it."

xmen,2r8dxg,mcdrunkin,2,Sun Jan 4 02:14:35 2015 UTC,Word is Fox has been looking into a live action show. Perhaps based on the school but its just in talks right now. If it were to happen I wouldn't expect anything for like another 3-5 years.
xmen,2r8dxg,GoldandBlue,1 point,Sun Jan 4 05:51:35 2015 UTC,That's sorta what I meant by New Mutants. A show inside the school about a new team
xmen,2r8dxg,t0talnonsense,3,Sun Jan 4 06:57:49 2015 UTC,"I kind of hope that they don't do anything on TV, because it likely shows that the company finds a lot of value in the property. I would rather Fox sell it back to Marvel than anything else positive they may do with the franchise."
xmen,2r8dxg,JZA1,1 point,Sat Jan 3 23:44:32 2015 UTC,"If they went with TV, they could perhaps go with like X-Factor or something and pitch it like a ""mutant police procedural"".  It probably wouldn't be that far off from the concept of Bruno Heller's Gotham.  I wouldn't be surprised if Fox has been eyeing how Agents of SHIELD and the Netflix Marvel series interact with its cinematic universe, and if AoS starts to take off I'm sure Fox would follow suit."
xmen,2r8dxg,mcdrunkin,-1,Wed Jan 7 20:35:11 2015 UTC,Yeah... thats unlikely. If you haven't noticed the X franchise shits out money. Fox is WELL aware of that. I wouldn't expect this property to go away anytime soon. F.F. on the other hand might revert before too long. We'll see how the new movie does.
xmen,2r8dxg,t0talnonsense,-1,Sun Jan 4 02:13:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not oblivious to the franchise's ability to make money, but that doesn't mean that I can't say why I would rather they didn't make a tv show. The less Fox utilizes the property, the more likely they are to sell the property back."
xmen,2r8dxg,mcdrunkin,-1,Sun Jan 4 02:39:27 2015 UTC,"You can say it all you like, doesn't make it likely to happen."
xmen,2r8dxg,t0talnonsense,-2,Sun Jan 4 05:02:39 2015 UTC,"No shit. I don't really know why you are harping on this so much. All I said was that I hoped they didn't do anything beyond movies with the property. I then went on to agree that Fox likely isn't stupid enough to just sit on a possible cash cow.   My desire for Marvel to have full creative control of all of their IP does not conflict with the likelihood of Fox refusing to concede the X-Men franchise, or their decision to make any other media beyond films."

Then have Weapon X as a rival government agency from the Cold War that comprised the entire Western Bloc that has gone rogue and Mister Sinister as a villain who's motives are often unknowable and manages to be just as good a strategist as Mystique herself."
xmen,2r9u0g,Astrapicus,4,Sun Jan 4 04:43:52 2015 UTC,"Try out the first 10 issues of the original 1963 Stan Lee X-Men just to get the flavor. If you love it, keep going.   Here's my cut & paste response for every time this is asked ---  I recommend starting with Chris Claremont's run that made the X-Men popular --- Giant Size X-Men #1, Uncanny X-Men #94-280, the graphic novel ""God Loves, Man Kills"", and X-Men: Vignettes 1 & 2.   This is an extremely helpful site: http://crushingkrisis.com/collecting-x-men-comic-books-as-graphic-novels/  There's also a good documentary about Chris Claremont's X-Men: http://sequart.org/movies/4/comics-in-focus-chris-claremonts-x-men/  If you want to skip around rather than reading every issue, here are my favorite story arcs, in chronological order:   Proteus (Uncanny 125-128) -- their first really dangerous enemy; I highly recommend the trade paperback which has some great additional stories Dark Phoenix Saga (Uncanny 129-137) -- widely considered the best ever, not my favorite though Days of Future Past (Uncanny 141-142) -- Kitty travels back in time from a dystopian future God Loves, Man Kills (graphic novel) -- possibly the best place for a newcomer to start The Brood Saga (Uncanny 154-158, 161-167) -- a mix of Alien & The Matrix, includes the first meeting of Magneto & Professor X (#161) and the first meeting of the X-men & Rogue Wolverine (Claremont/Miller limited series 1-4) -- the first Wolverine comics, must-read From the Ashes (Uncanny 168-176) -- one of Joss Whedon's favorite runs; Wolverine's wedding; Rogue joins the X-Men; Storm gets a mohawk Havok & Wolverine: Meltdown (limited series 1-4) -- highly recommended, great artwork Inferno (Uncanny 239-243, ties in with X-Factor etc) -- typical sprawling X-over, the X-Men issues are better than the X-Factor & New Mutants etc. Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men run 1-24 (the Warren Ellis run after this is also good). The Whedon run also has an amazing motion comic partially available on Netflix."
xmen,2r9u0g,xooxanthellae,2,Sun Jan 4 21:58:04 2015 UTC,"This is a list made by a true mutie lover.   My first impulse was to suggest God Loves, Man Kills."
xmen,2r9u0g,fromagi,3,Mon Jan 5 04:38:00 2015 UTC,The Uncanny X-Men Omnibus is a good place to start. Claremont's run is considered a classic for good reason.
xmen,2r9u0g,Jumbledcode,2,Sun Jan 4 06:11:05 2015 UTC,"X-Men First Class or X-Men Season One is a good alternative to the 60's comics if you don't want to read silver age stuff.  Chris Claremont's 17 year run on the title starting in 75 has aged very well and is worth a read for every X-Men fan. If you don't read the whole run AT LEAST read these: Giant Size X-Men #1, Uncanny X-Men 98-100 (Phoenix), 125-128 (Proteus), 129-138 (Hellfire/Dark Phoenix)."
xmen,2r9u0g,tec2030,1 point,Sun Jan 4 07:36:13 2015 UTC,"This is entirely what I came to say. The early X-Men was so bad Marvel were in the verge if cancelling it (after years of re-printing old issues) until Chris Clairemont came in. There are good re-imaginings of the early years like First Class or Season One, but if you read the NOW All New X-Men it's the team from the 60s sent through time to the modern era."
xmen,2r9u0g,SuperRic,1 point,Sun Jan 4 20:02:35 2015 UTC,"I'm reading all of x-men chronologically.. I have read Uncanny from issue 1 to 205, about 40 issues of the new mutants and I have recently started X-Factor and am about 5 issues in with that. Reading all of X-Men from the very beginning has been a compelling experience- though it's a difficult undertaking to recommend. Basically, if you really want to do it then go for it and satisfy a personal curiosity but the truth is that a lot of the older issues, even in Claremont's run, can be boring at times. If you want to just read the recommended story arcs then you'd absorb plenty of character and history.   Prior to Claremont, it is very difficult to recommend the series when it was written by Stan Lee and a handful of other writers before it was cancelled for 5 years. It's just a bad comic book with some interesting thematic material- civil rights, genetics, alienation. There are a few stand out issues, #50-51 come to mind.. but you can get away with reading maybe just the first 5 or ten- but all the classic characters are nearly unrecognisable when compared to how they were written in the 80s and onwards.   I'm nearing the home stretch of Claremont's run now and my assessment of his tenure with x-men is that he definitely did some great work and imagined much of what is associated with the comic, but he can be hit or miss. Generally, when Claremont was paired with a gifted artist, such as Barry windsor-smith or Bill Sienkiewicz, his storytelling raised to the task but often I feel as though he was stretched too thin for too long, but all in all maintained an excellent level of quality. So go ahead, read his full run because it's worth it, but keep in mind that you will get about 85% of whatever it is you want to get out of older x-men by sticking to the essential storylines and cross over events."

It could be the way that Fantomex seems to be able to ignore injury when EVA isn't inside his body. It could also be related to the fact that he has multiple brains which can take over from each other, or his ability to self-repair by entering a kind of trance. Apparently at some time he's also mentioned having a healing factor but I've got no idea how powerful this is"

His healing is pretty strong even though its artificial for example he has even survived gunshots through the head in some recent issues Edit: another fun fact is he doesn't give off a scent meaning wolvie can't track him also thanks to his clever little nanobots I believe, and they have also in recent issues allowed him to enter the mindscape of an artificial intelligence"

They both have their moments though and can be enjoyed on some levels. Kelsey Grammer as Beast and more Colossus made X3 worth the price of admission for me.

But I feel like they could have set it up more. Remember how in the AoA:Prelude Apocalypse is really NOT in it AT ALL? Except for towards the end when the big fight out in the desert is going down? It's then he's like ""aight, mutants are out in the public so I can reveal myself now""....THAT would have been such a dope thing to put in DOFP! When everything is going down in DC between the White House and the Mutants? or in Vietnam! Those events had some news cameras on them and to hint that Apocalypse was watching and plotting then would have been awesome.  Maybe they'll bring that back in for the third one? I dunno. I quite enjoyed the AoA story line and wish they could have the film be more like that, have a whole AoA trilogy or something."

xmen,2qsr3u,Poseiden9221,7,Sat Jan 3 04:16:01 2015 UTC,"I feel like this comes up a lot....   There are the reality-manipulators, like Franklin Richards, Legion, Mister M, Jaime Braddock, Matthew Malloy, Scarlet Witch. They've typically got a lot of range and their abilities are typically pretty ""meta"". They can depower other powers, for instance. Proteus is typically lumped in this category but I'm not sure. Jaime is usually pretty hands on, and doesn't seem to have the range of other characters. Most of these could, if pushed, undo anyone facing them and arrange things so no one knew that person had ever existed. Then there are the molecular rearrangers, like Jean Grey/Phoenix, Nate Grey, Cable, Rachel Summers-Grey. They're good at destruction, but the power set is pretty physical and not as open-ended. There are also a few generic multi-faceted characters that rank up here too, like Mikhail Rasputin. Matthew Malloy could be put here on the face of it, but he seems able to pretty much just pull powers out as desired which puts him in the first tier of reality manipulators. Then there are the ones who are just ""top of their class"" in that they have a tight power set with a large potential effect or big bang. Vulcan, Iceman, Magma, Gambit, Magneto, Storm, Apocalypse, Mister Sinister, Bishop. I'd put Tempus in this category, and Hijack. They both have strong powers, but not broad ones. Edit: And Hope. Who is basically really good at copying powers, which really disappoints me. AvX was a weak end to her story. :/ Magik has a pretty tight power set (teleporter) but because of her access to Limbo, ability to time travel, and sorceress training, ranks pretty high. The Magus, and by extension Warlock, come pretty close to trumping all the physical stuff, but they have an obvious weakness to magnetism and a few other abilities. Still, if Magus can rip apart a star and travel through space, he can probably handle Iceman. JZA1 makes a good point about another class/group, the telepaths/illusionists/power manipulators. This again is a usually a pretty tight power set, but one that enables them to control opponents directly (Xavier; Karma); or by misdirection (the Mastermind sisters) ; or through power negation/control (Leech; Chance; the guy in the Marauders. Scrambler?) This turns foes against one another, or eliminates them from the battlefield temporarily. The problem is that an opponent protected against psychic control can usually take them out pretty easily (glass jaw syndrome), so on an overall power scale they don't fare too well. I think almost all of the reality manipulators are immune to this kind of stuff. Again, it's a strong power set, but not a really broad one."

Matthew Malloy 2. Tempus 3. Psylocke or Rach 4. Magick (she has trained under Dr. Strange) 5. Genesis 6. Polaris (only because I think she could have potential to have Magneto's power)    Genesis is only ranked because of hype. He's supposed to be a celestial level being, but he gets punked by average level mutants. He's never actually been insanely powerful by himself. Maybe the psychics could trade places with Magick.   .........presently, the X-men have undergone huge power nerfs. Xavier is kind of dead, Emma and Mag's powers are on the fritz, Cable doesn't have his mass psychic powers anymore, Nate Grey is MIA and depowered, Jean Grey is in an ethereal form outside as the White Phoenix of the Crown, Legion is in Blindfold's subconscious, Hope Summers is in an ethereal form, Franklin Richards and Scarlet Witch aren't really in the X-men universe, even if they are mutants....  Ice Man has the potential to be one of the most powerful mutants, but he has failed to capitalize on his potential (future him also noted this). There are some powerful students at the Jean Grey School and the New Xavier School with lots of potential, but Tempus is the only stand out currently.

xmen,2qsr3u,WaitingForGobots,1 point,Tue Dec 30 08:46:57 2014 UTC,"He was great in x-men 2099 as well. One of the biggest gimmicks of the franchise was that it was so separate from the main continuity. So having Exodus just show up was a fun shock. You get a lot of bragging rights when you're still active 100 years in the future, when most of the people from that period had been killed long before old age had a chance to get them."

I mean, sure, he's more or less impossible to kill (for more than a few issues anyway), but he isn't powerful per se. Compared to the influence Magneto, Iceman or Phoenix's powers have over their surroundings and other people, Wolverine isn't a huge amount more powerful than a run of the mill human."

There are a LOT of Marvel Now titles.  The shortest answer is read All-New X-Men and the crossover with Guardians of the Galaxy, and then the Cyclops series. You can also start with All-New, add in Uncanny after a few issues, and then read both as necessary and add in Cyclops after the crossover.  There's nothing else in Marvel Now that really matters to Cyclops."

xmen,2qo7ie,vibraxis,10,Mon Dec 29 03:07:26 2014 UTC,Yes she can... Depends on the writer
xmen,2qo7ie,Alegretron,8,Mon Dec 29 02:44:12 2014 UTC,She would be more like a Go Bot.
xmen,2qo7ie,nthman,4,Mon Dec 29 08:56:55 2014 UTC,"I think it would depend on her being able to transform into nonorganic beings and whether Transformers would be classified as nonorganic or organic. I haven't dived too deep into comics with her displaying her powers but I don't recall her transforming into non-organic things (i.e. rocks, tables). Now that I think about it, she has also never transformed into plant-based forms. (Correct me if I am wrong, please).  On the other hand, if she can mimic Wolverine's claws, even though fleshy, I guess she could look like a Transformer. Also, some of the newer writings have Mystique mentioning that she can now change mass."
xmen,2qo7ie,drobreddits,2,Mon Dec 29 05:22:46 2014 UTC,She would not be able to do it to scale since they are simply too big. But she could turn into a miniature form assuming it did not compromise her organs.
xmen,2qo7ie,neoblackdragon,2,Mon Dec 29 16:56:05 2014 UTC,"Many years ago I read a description of Mystique's powers that said she was limited to taking the likeness of persons she had come into physical contact with.  Inanimate objects, outside of clothing, weren't possible.  I think that would have excluded a metal transformation.  However, according to wikipedia, her powers are no longer limited to organic matter or her body mass due to enhancements in her mutation.  It might be possible, but it would be an extreme stretch based on what we've seen of her abilities up until now.  Edit: It's probably important to note that she only takes the appearance of objects, not their properties.  She can mimic Wolverine's claws, but they're not actually adamantium.  Even if she were able to take the humanoid form of a transformer, we're never going to see her turn into a car."
xmen,2qo7ie,ithinkimightbegay,1 point,Mon Dec 29 21:56:42 2014 UTC,Technically yes she could though she would be flesh and bone and  she would unlikely to do it as she has herself admitted using her powers are painful to use and using her powers to shape weird things (in the comics case extending wolverines claws several feet) is extremely painful

But now that she is seemingly in control of her powers, she is kinda too OP to really stay part of the Xmen.   So I'm thinking she will use her powers to do something big and that will be her endsong, or they'll figure out some way of either throwing her into some other timeline or taking away her powers.

Nothing happened when she touched them, because according to her there was nothing of the original host left. According to the sentinels themselves, everything that wouldn't be needed for hunting mutants was removed. Including memories, emotion, etc. Basically biological aspects, but little more than machines. The same would probably be true of the similar biosentinals. Especially those made from corpses. Though I'd guess that either before the sentinal programming was activated would get the memories, though nothing of the sentinel parts."

But Tempus is really a standout character.   Totally agreed. Though the first time I've really thought about the JGS originals recently came from Uncanny. Because between a teleporting demon sorceress, a super omega level mutant, and a tactical genius? None of them saw the giant ass flying aircraft carrier thing coming to nuke them. Know whose super power could have saved the day? Eye boy.   That bit of irony aside, I'm really digging Scott's students as well. The stepford's have had more characterisation than they've had in ages, even characters like goldballs have had a chance to be interesting, and I legitimately like Eva.

It's about a bunch of female staff members at the Jean Grey School. Started being decent around issue #17).   What I haven't read but have heard it's good: Cyclops (About young O5 Cyclops in space hanging with his dad).

xmen,2qhxnx,Somacron,-5,Mon Dec 29 05:32:25 2014 UTC,"The best I've heard was either he gets suckered into it anyway or ops into it, especially with his memory of what he can do with it(assuming those memories are present in his altered past after he returns to his original spot in the altered timeline.  Also the possibility of Magneto being a part of it, either by request or by force even if it just comes about without the memory of adamantium claws from the original timeline past. My personal guess with Mystique being Stryker at the end is that she might still be evil enough to take on the role of Stryker giving him his new claws as Stryker to manipulate or helpful enough to assist him with attaining them willingly somewhere down the road.  That way little actually changes, he might still think its Stryker in the former scenario(too drunk to remember the details if he even lived through DOFP).  Could still befriend him and keep it a secret for more future drama."

xmen,2q9lxt,Koosh25,2,Wed Dec 24 17:13:43 2014 UTC,interesting question. i remember an issue where she took nightcrawler and colossus's powers to battle nimrod. rogue was awesome.

xmen,2q9lxt,neoblackdragon,1 point,Wed Dec 24 14:28:19 2014 UTC,If it's got powers she can replicate them or their physical features. I think it stops at dead things though. She can also absorb multiple sources but the downside is she may not be able to contain it all. Pure energy though seems to stick to her like Captain Marvel or Wonder Man.
xmen,2q9lxt,SMB73,1 point,Wed Dec 24 15:12:19 2014 UTC,"I've always been under the impression that if the person she comes into contact with is a mutant, she steals their powers and knocks them unconscious and/or steals their powers teporarily and sometimes permanently. If the the person is human, just their life force."
xmen,2q9lxt,MysterioTheBlack,3,Wed Dec 24 23:15:05 2014 UTC,"Carol Danvers is not a mutant and she had her powers for years. She's also stolen Skrull powers, the Fantastic Fours, and several Avengers."

xmen,2q9lxt,detourne,4,Wed Dec 24 18:35:35 2014 UTC,Definitely not just mutants. Carol Danvers was her first 'big steal' which basically nailed her power set for the 80s and 90s of flight and super strength.

xmen,2q8wo7,Showbuckle,1 point,Wed Dec 24 15:03:45 2014 UTC,at the time it seemed epic. Yes it had great art in my opinion but I love kubert and joe mad. however the story is kind of weak in hindsight..very 90's
xmen,2q8wo7,Koosh25,1 point,Wed Dec 24 14:29:53 2014 UTC,It's somewhat divisive. There is some good foreshadowing and story telling for core characters but I really dislike the art. It's very typical of the mid to late 90s era when anime was becoming increasingly popular and the technology of comic production was changing. Faces don't look right. Eyes are getting bigger. Everything looks weirdly smooth. Every bad guy has sharp fingers and teeth. Characters are being modernized in unflattering ways.  I'd try to find it used.
xmen,2q8wo7,apalehorse,1 point,Wed Dec 24 05:24:45 2014 UTC,"Ok, Thanks! I think I'm gonna go for it. I found it for $20 on Amazon with free shipping/no sales tax. I've never read anything from the 90s, so it seemed like a good place to start since the Onslaught omnibus comes out next year."

xmen,2q2ejv,JZA1,1 point,Mon Dec 22 18:12:04 2014 UTC,I think it's also worth noting the irony of how the X-men animated series featured Terminator ripoffs for their DOFP future sequences.

If you were to take a pic of your comic with a pencil or something for scale I could do the same and compare.

He is emitting some kind of energy from his eyes apparently in the spectrum that we can see. We may as well call it red light. Light is a variable electric magnetic field. When light interacts with something it excites the atoms and we feel heat.  If Cyclops' eyes are red light beams then they have to heat what they interact with."

xmen,2px9r5,davoonline,19,Sat Dec 20 22:52:46 2014 UTC,The X-Men movies have some of the worst continuity of any movie series. That is the best explanation I can give you.

xmen,2px9r5,tec2030,4,Sun Dec 21 17:15:56 2014 UTC,"Listen, hear is the real explanantion - one SO SECRET that Charles has never admitted it out loud:   telepathy causes male pattern baldness.  Now, everything makes sense! I mean, look at the luscious locks young Chuck is rocking. He loves that hair, man! And when he realizes that his esp is causing baldness, he is crippled with depression. But he can never admit it to anyone because he is too vain.  So everyone thinks he's depressed because of Magneto or something. When Beast invents the serum to surpress his powers, that also has the amazing side effect of making him walk, he is set for life! He will never be bald again!  But then he realizes something EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. Without his brain powers, he sucks as picking up the ladies! All the long hair in the world can't help him.  So at last, like a real hero, he embraces his destiny and seizes his giant throbbing brain powers, which will make him bald, and also he forgets how to walk again. But he does it because he is a HERO.  But also because he can mind control chicks not to care about him being bald. GAME SET MATCH PROFESSOR X."
xmen,2px9r5,detentist,4,Wed Dec 24 01:55:24 2014 UTC,I assumed in the original timeline Xavier didn't stop using that drug until much later. That might explain why he was still walking later on
xmen,2px9r5,AlexGramBelled,2,Sun Dec 21 02:00:17 2014 UTC,I sincerely believe that the drug/walking thing was just so that they didn't have to have him in a wheelchair all movie.
xmen,2px9r5,apalehorse,3,Tue Dec 23 16:33:06 2014 UTC,"The meta answer would be, that in the original trilogy, they started out with Patrick Stewart as Charles.  When they visited Jean Grey, it was still Patrick Stewart's version.    When they made DoFP, they started off with James McAvoy's version of Charles.  It would be a weird change, that might alienate movie goers, to have Charles suddenly go bald in the interim."
xmen,2px9r5,anteus2,3,Sun Dec 21 02:52:00 2014 UTC,"My head canon is that Cortez was a student at the school for a while and made it so Xavier could walk. For whatever reason he was no longer a member of the school by the time Wolverine came around, thus Xavier was back in the chair."
xmen,2px9r5,Kupy,1 point,Sun Dec 21 03:02:13 2014 UTC,"Fabian Cortez:       Fabian Cortez is a fictional character, a mutant comic book supervillain from the Marvel Comics universe and an adversary of the X-Men.

xmen,2px9r5,autowikibot,2,Sun Dec 21 03:02:48 2014 UTC,"To answer your walking part: my theory on this continuity issue was that in the original timeline Xavier was still on the serum Hank created. Since the events of 'Day's of Future Past’ didn't originally occur, Xavier's reunion with Magneto would of been different. I imagine they didn't finally reconnect till much later in history and by then Magneto had escaped/been freed/released from the Pentagon prison and the anger Charles had for him was now in the past which is why they were teaming up again to find new mutants.  Fast forward to 1985/86 and the two meet Jean Grey for the first time which is shown at the start of 'X-Men the Last Stand'. Xavier is shown to still be walking so it’s an easy assumption that he’s still on Hank’s serum at this point in his life.  Now, this doesn’t answer your question perfectly, theirs still other small continuity issues with the opening of ’The Last Stand’ which are: at the time of finding and meeting Jean Grey we can assume that Cerebro was used in discovering her and I imagine it was used to locate other mutants like Cyclops and Storm. Also, during the meeting of Xavier and Jean, theirs a moment where Charles talks to Jean through telepathy. So if Xavier is still on the serum, how was he using Cerebro since his powers were negated and how was he able to talk to Jean while he was walking? Theirs no official answer to this, not even a hint. So my theory is Xavier was still addicted to the serum but was willing to kick the drug for small periods at a time to reclaim his powers and use them to find new mutants. After he would find them he would resume the use of the serum and now that he was powerless he would have Magneto come with him as both a body guard but also as someone who could demonstrate to any sceptics that they were indeed mutants. You can still poke holes in this as it doesn’t explain the telepathy between him and Jean so the only thing I can surmise is that Jean was using her powers on him and he was acknowledging it like Magneto did too.   To answer the question about balding, theirs almost 2 decades between the movies storylines so you can easily assume it was due to male pattern baldness."

xmen,2pv7kt,MnB_85,3,Sat Dec 20 13:19:02 2014 UTC,"I don't think it would be hard to project his politics about Palestine. Genosha almost writes itself as a fictional Israel for Marvel's mutants.   Magneto's character origin are within Nazi Germany.  Genosha is almost a parallel for this wwii-israel history. At first mutants are used as slave labor for Genosha.  Not too different than Nazi Germany.  No less than UN ceded the land to Magneto for a mutant safe haven. This is almost certainly an allegory for the UN partition plans that created Israel from Palestine.    If we carry the analogy forward, Magneto creates a mutants only refuge by forcibly removing every one else.  The parallel would be the Jewish removal of Palestinian Arabs in Israel.    Of course, once Magneto succeeds in eliminating humans from Genosha, he (in true Magneto style) tries to take over the world.  And the mutant homeland is ultimately destroyed in holocaust.  Im not quite sure how to interpret that-- but it would seem that Magneto's brand of Mutants-only zionism is punished.  Perhaps this is Marvel's not so subtle suggestion for Israel to figure out how to make a multi-ethnic state?"
xmen,2pv7kt,wellssh,2,Sat Dec 20 23:53:10 2014 UTC,I honestly don't think he has. To be honest I don't think Palestine has ever been mentioned as far as I know.

They specifically make up fictional countries, so that they can avoid addressing topics like this directly.  Although you might see parallels if you look hard enough.    If they ever did address it, I think he might care to some extent, but mutants are his new ""cause"".  He probably identifies himself as a mutant first, before anything else.  As they are fewer in number, and have less people to care for them, he feels like he needs to champion their cause."

Scott's children: Cable, Rachel Summers, Nate Grey - The problem here is we should add Stryfe if we are counting alternate reality children like Rachel and Nate Grey. Grandchildren are probably Hope and Tyler both adopted children of Cable.    Utopia: Looks to have been founded in Dark Avengers #8    Wolverine's kids: Wolverine volume 4 #1 seems to be where the 7 that he kills debuts. He does have more children though than listed. I'm pretty sure he's adopted both X-23 and Amiko.    First appearances: Wolverine was in Incredible Hulk 180, Mystique was in Ms Marvel #17, Sabretooth was in Iron Fist #14. There are a lot more X-Characters that started outside X-books.    Magneto headed the X-Men for a lot of the 80s after Xavier went off into space with Lilandra, this happens after his trial, I'm not sure on the exact issues.    Jean doesn't have 13 deaths. She might have in arc deaths like most characters where things get resolved by the end of the story, but for lasting deaths she's had 2. The Dark Phoenix plot and the end of Morrison's New X-Men."

xmen,2po516,Exodus111,1 point,Thu Dec 18 23:22:59 2014 UTC,"Well most cosmic events have been reset by altering the timeline.  The Infintity Gauntlet was reset by redoing the past 24 hours, Age of Apocalypse was undone by repairing the M'kraan crystal (spawning AoA into its own timeline).  So if we look back at the 616 timeline as one 4D line, allowing for all the repairs, but eliminating all cosmic events, how many times has she died, in the sense that it's something that retains its historical existence in the 616 timeline as we see it today?"
xmen,2po516,MysterioTheBlack,1 point,Fri Dec 19 00:16:32 2014 UTC,"If we apply that logic, are we even able to count the time she was replaced by the Phoenix and left healing in a cocoon, because by the idea of the timeline we see today she never died there."
xmen,2po516,Exodus111,1 point,Fri Dec 19 00:18:01 2014 UTC,"True, she was held in a near death suspended animation.

I don't remember how it went exactly, but I think there was an ""organization"" of people who were friends/family of people Logan had killed at some point or another. This organization somehow found Logans illegitimate children (all adults) and basically set up this scenario where Logan had to fight them, eventually kill them, then find out they were his children afterwards.  Went something like that. I'm sure someone else can explain better. I think this happened around the time he went to hell as well."

xmen,2pqm6n,DivingDays,6,Fri Dec 19 00:35:10 2014 UTC,"Wolverine's mutant powers are his healing factor, enhanced senses, and bone claws. The adamantium came from the Weapon X program.  X-Men Origins: Wolverine bascially shat all over canon. James Howlett (Wolverine) and Victor Creed (Sabretooth) are not brothers, Blob was never in a military unit with him, and Deadpool is not some mutant Frankenstein's monster (to name just a few things the movie changes from the comics).  He was born sometime between 1870 and 1890 (Late 19th century is about as specific as they get)."

xmen,2pqm6n,AlexGramBelled,0,Fri Dec 19 01:35:07 2014 UTC,In some arcs they have suggested that adamantium boosted his healing factor while others have suggested it it actually weakened it.

xmen,2pqm6n,Nellisir,1 point,Fri Dec 19 01:33:53 2014 UTC,"I think, and I'm just guessing here, that his healing factor had to work overtime to deal with the adamantium, so when it was removed, it was a lot stronger than it had been and made actual overt physical changes to his structure that took time to subside."
