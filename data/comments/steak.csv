steak,3dyx7i,zoso135,8,Mon Jul 20 17:41:46 2015 UTC,"I look at it as such:  Grass fed, store bought beef is pretty lousy.  It has a gamey, liver-like taste and the texture is very firm.  If you like that sort of thing in your beef- cool, I'd rather eat venison, and prepare it as such.  Grass fed doesn't mean that the animal was kept in better conditions (free-range on the other hand, usually does).  If you're going to go that route of a ""wholesome"" steer, then I would suggest pasture raised beef with a corn finish, I think these cattle are amazing- sometimes (and usually, in my case) the fat is yellow, from the flowers and misc. plants that they eat (BETA-CAROTINES, MT FRIEND!), they don't just eat grass- or hay and get to walk around, they are led out to a real pasture; then, when the time comes, they are ""finished"" with a corn diet to bump up their fat.  There are two problems with this:  Availibility: You have to be around/in a farming community and know your farmers  Price/storage/quantity:  You're not just buying a steak, you're probably going to have to buy at least a 1/4 side of beef- which is a lot of beef.  You're looking at at least $650.00 for a 1/4 side of beef and all the cuts that come with it- the bright side is that you can go in on the purchase with friends!  I have to say though, that the beef is amazing- on par with prime and Chianina beef for me and it comes out to less than $6.00/lb when you buy all this stuff in bulk!  Taking all of this in so account, I wouldn't say that you're alone on your island, but I will take a prime steak over a gress-fed/free range steak any day; but put prime against a pasture raised, corn-finished steak, I'd take the pasture raised steak any day."

steak,3dyx7i,v66fender66v,-6,Mon Jul 20 21:09:15 2015 UTC,"You're feeling shitty because you're attributing human like characteristics to cows. Cows are not humans, and should not be treated as such.  Ever heard of an ichneumon? It's a wasp. It captures prey by paralyzing it. It then proceeds to lay eggs inside the prey. When the eggs hatch, the babies start eating the prey inside out, but it is done in such a manner where the prey does not die and has to endure every last part of him being eaten, as the paralyzing agent slows the heart to such a rate where it will still continue to survive despite being slowly dismembered. How fucked up is that? Extremely. Does it matter? No, because that's just the nature of things. The wasp doesn't feel shitty doing this because it's practical and works wonderfully for him, and, more importantly, it has no morals.   Similarly, cows have no morals. They will not care if they are being fed corn vs grass because it doesn't make a difference to them one way or another -- food is food. Choosing how to feel about food/ similar deep insight is a uniquely human attribute. So, if a cow doesn't care about what it's being fed every day, I certainly won't. Besides, most cows are fed grass, they are only FINISHED (that is, the very last part of life) on grain--that's when they get fatty. It's not like they're just fattened from birth (unless we're speaking japanese Wagyu, but that's less than 1% of cattle).   So yeah, I dont lose sleep over eating USDA prime, and it's not going to happen ever."
steak,3dyx7i,bonoboner,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking in terms of the well-being of the animals.   I'm saying healthy naturally raised animals are better tasting, better for you, better for a lot of other things (economy, environment, etc..)   edit: I would assume that most steak aficionados know this, but have encountered the contrary."
steak,3dyx7i,v66fender66v,2,Mon Jul 20 18:44:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, and in fact Argentina mostly does too. Cows raised on the pampas are entirely grass fed, organic, and free range. The steak as a result is much leaner and the fat has a different flavor (one I prefer). USDA and Japanese high grade steak focuses on high marbling, which is extremely flavorful but IMO can be too buttery and greasy. The other factor that makes a big difference is aging. Dry-aged steak imparts different flavor and texture profiles, and I'm sure those are equally affected by the types and quantities of fats. It's a question of preference in the end. As far as which is healthier, I'd guess the leaner beef since all that marbling is a big hunk of low density lipid cholesterol waiting to clog your arteries, but it may be argued that it gets converted to something else in your body. Also, the antioxidants in red wine help avoid collecting cholesterol plaque in your arteries so red wine and red meat actually makes a lot of sense!"
steak,3e10dh,LullabyforElla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:10:47 2015 UTC,"Direct Pan sear on medium heat with olive oil is a phenomenal way to do it  If your steak is thick enough, you can get one hell of a crust on that. Just constantly flip, add butter + garlic at the very end, and you win. Finish with some flake salt for added flavor as well.  Reasoning is the usual super high heat sear to finish off a steak is too hot for olive oil. You're forced into grape-seed/ other neutral oils... These don't have any flavor! Olive oil, on the other hand, adds an unrivaled richness to your steak provided you use a sufficient enough. So, you lower the heat to allow for olive oil and fun times ensue.  If I'm dealing gas grill, I love some black n blue. Start your steak off in a pan on super low heat, just keep basting the steak on butter. Then, once your grill gets ripping hot (I'm saying near 1,000 degrees if if can, and some do!), drop the steak you've been basting with butter straight on. It should be engulfed in flames because its dripping in fat, so be careful! Normally you avoid this, but for black n blue, you want to maximize the flare-ups. Once seared the fuck out of one side (won't take long, trust me) flip and repeat. The whole process will take around 3-4 more minutes, and you'll end with an internal temp closer to 110 when all is said and done. Drop it back in the butter just for more artery clogging goodness if you want to finish it off, before plating with some flake salt sprinkled liberally overtop (key thing to do). It's a bit too rare for some people, but the consistency of biting into the crisp, burnt outside of a steak that's extremely rare is something that I've grown to love."

steak,3dutxs,random012345,12,Mon Jul 20 11:22:04 2015 UTC,"Marbling is a huge part of the grading.  Prime looks like a piece of meat-granite.  Basically, it's very evenly red and white.   And it tastes a HELL of a lot better than Choice, which is the one under it.  The nice beefy/salty/juicy flavor everyone wants comes from the fat.  When it's marbled so nicely, the whole meat is perfectly flavored, textured, and juicy.    On top of that, the prime meat cuts like butter.  Again, this is because the marbling makes the meat much more delicate since it isn't connected to other meat as well.    In the end, you have a steak that is unforgettable.  Prime is usually very expensive.  Most grocery store butchers keep it behind the counter in their display cabinet if they even get it.  I don't recall the last grocery store that kept Prime out in the pre-wrapped area.  Even Whole Foods has limited allocations of Prime per day.  I highly doubt that Kirkland carries Prime.  It isn't uncommon for a Prime Ribeye to go for $20/lb.  It's definitely a ""treat yo self"" meal, and you only go to that level when you've perfected your Choice cooking.  It's a steak you don't want to screw up.  The plus side is that even a slightly overdone Prime steak will probably be better than most Choices.  As far as the pic OP posted, that's far from Prime in any way. Select at best, which has almost no marbling.  The USDA and beef lobby is so tightly regulated in the US that as /u/moikederp pointed out, the auditors would be all over this.  I'm not huge on lobby groups, but I love what they've done for USDA beef and how consistent it may be along with how safe it is to eat in the US at even raw temperatures.  Edit: Further reading."

steak,3dutxs,crackills,2,Mon Jul 20 01:06:49 2015 UTC,"My thought as well, it also has the darker hue grass fed usually has"
steak,3dutxs,callm3fusion,7,Mon Jul 20 11:22:15 2015 UTC,That's actually hilarious. It's like some type of special cattle that was bred specifically to produce the worst steak ever. Literally zero marbling.
steak,3dutxs,crackills,5,Sun Jul 19 21:50:21 2015 UTC,Grass fed.   http://i.imgur.com/1tWZnmB.png
steak,3dutxs,misterschmoo,4,Mon Jul 20 01:07:21 2015 UTC,Is grass fed really that great as far as cooking goes? Im new to the steak world and have always wondered
steak,3dutxs,crackills,7,Mon Jul 20 02:31:29 2015 UTC,"No, absolutely not. People prefer it for several reasons including a better fatty acid profile (more omega-3) but imo its shit due to how lean it is. Grass fed is not usually graded by the usda because it gets a premium price all by itself and and grading would only hurt since the lack of marbling."
steak,3dutxs,crackills,4,Mon Jul 20 02:40:33 2015 UTC,"In New Zealand pretty much all beef is grass fed and it's fine, here is an example, http://www.campbellsbutchery.co.nz/product-category/beef/ it doesn't have to be bad."
steak,3dutxs,misterschmoo,2,Mon Jul 20 07:28:06 2015 UTC,"It all looks lean to me, better than some examples of grass fed but when compared to US grain finished beef it just doesn't have it where it counts.  Of course here in the US grass fed costs double, you're paying a premium for it. Im sure it tastes fine, i ate some the other day but if I was paying 15-17 a pound Id buy usda prime.... If I have a choice I always avoid it.   Heres what I get at a chain grocery store on sale for $5.99/lb, usda choice.   http://i.imgur.com/I8WOLHf.png"

So I have nothing to compare it to.  I've never had issue with any steak I have bought here, and we are paying $9.50 USD per pound for Angus Sirloin which is pretty high grade stuff, sounds like your beef prices are much higher than ours."
steak,3dutxs,CercleRouge,2,Mon Jul 20 09:04:32 2015 UTC,"Bottom sirloin choice grade would be around 6-8/lb I think, Angus is usually $1 more. The ribeyes I posted were 5.99 but usually 9.99-13.99.  Price is based on cut and grade. The more marbling and more tender the more expensive. Grass fed falls into the organic/paleo/health craze thats been going on and get its premium price from that, at least here in the US. Usda prime commands a high price, 16-20+ a pound but is a lot more rare and very marbled.   Heres what a prime graded steak looks like.   http://i.imgur.com/a357v9u.jpg  And $150/lb a5 wagyu from japan  http://i.imgur.com/0ojPeQJ.png  And you can see the marbling in this thick choice grade $9/lb boneless ribeye  http://i.imgur.com/mdA1VbJ.png  http://i.imgur.com/vJkaxXd.png  Taste wise... Well lean grass fed I get more gamey and muted flavor, usually a little tougher, while more marbled beef is very rich melt-in-your-mouth beefy flavor. I guess its hard to explain. I haven't eaten a lot of grass fed and.... well steak is still steak and it still taste good, I just wouldn't pay a premium price for less marbled steak."
steak,3dutxs,Spicy_Potatoes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:52:48 2015 UTC,"I understand that marbling keeps the beef moist while it's cooking, but when I see wagyu beef, it just looks like fat to me, how does it look when cooked? Have you tried it?"
steak,3dutxs,crackills,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:14:18 2015 UTC,"I just put that in there to point out the relationship between price and marbling. A5 wagyu is a delicacy and you really cant compare it to regular steak. I had a 12oz ribeye in April and it was so rich. I loved every bite but I wouldve been fine with 6oz since its so filling.   You cook it carefully on a cast iron pan with salt and pepper in a drop of sesame seed oil. There are other more traditional ways to cook waygu, even serving it raw. Fat doesn't just keep it moist, its where the best flavor comes from.   It also causes the meat to tenderize when the network of fat renders. That goes for all steaks."
steak,3dutxs,Immiscible,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:40:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I tried eating mostly grass-fed when I was doing paleo, but I like my steaks to taste good, now it's AT LEAST well-marbled choice for me."

It's a fairly tough bit of meat though so you need to know how to cook it to make the most of it.  You just need to brush with oil and season each side then cook on an extremely hot cast cast iron or black iron pan for 1–1.5 minutes a side. Let it rest and then ideally slice on a cutting board across the grain with a sharp knife before serving. A non-stick pan is not suitable due to the really high heat you need.  I find it's one of the most satisfying supermarket steaks there is.  To some extent this manner of cooking will also help cook other thinner cuts of steak too — the very high dry pan temperature helping sear the outside quicker before the heat has fully penetrated, however there's a limit to what you can manage with a 1cm thick piece!"

Get cast iron hot AF, season steak w/pepper & garlic powder, put steak in cast iron, add butter (I also toss in a smashed garlic clove & some thyme sprigs as well) and sear each side for no more than 2 minutes; baste with butter in pan to get it flav-or-FUL! Remove the magic meat, wrap in foil & let rest again for 10 minutes. Then eat dat summabitch of a delicious steak! Best cut: rib eye w/ bone-in (adds flavor and gnaw the meat off after like a caveman as homage to the first man who ate a steak)."

steak,3dfva5,The_Kitten_Stimpy,3,Thu Jul 16 04:18:01 2015 UTC,"Very nice, looks good! To be honest, the only things you really need to cook a proper steak are:   a way to sear (pan/skillet/grill/broiler/etc) a way to bring it up to temperature without burning the outside (oven/water bath/cooler side of grill/lowered temperature in the pan until cooked through/etc) a reliable meat thermometer -- the meat thermometer takes all the guesswork away, and it doesn't have to be expensive   These are all flexible, too, and don't have to be of the highest quality. Take things gently until you get a feel for your equipment (start temperatures low, then work your way up). Remember that you can fix undercooking, but you can't fix overcooking."

Cheap meat becomes incredible if you cook for 24 hours. Even cooking to medium leaves you with ridiculously-juicy steak, and it couldn't be easier. OP's model is around the same price, I think, and around the same specs, basically. It might be higher wattage, but I can't remember. Either way, the method itself is pure gold.

I sat them on there on all sides for a few minutes each along the sides of the grill, covered up while the coals were heating.   At that point I ended up putting them right over the middle to get them cooking a little more directly, alternating sides every minute or so.  Eventually I said, ""Move over, coals"", and stuck them down in the bottom and let the flames lick at them for a little while. Got myself a good crust going.  As you can tell, I don't treat it like a science, so unfortunately I don't know temps and exact times and whatnot.. It was great though!"

steak,3dbcar,collincun,2,Wed Jul 15 00:23:42 2015 UTC,"The sear could use more heat (I would try super high grill or iron skillet maxed out based on your resources) but I think the inside looks really good, not much gradient. Good internal temperature.   Did you use Sous Vide or reverse sear, because the internal color is very even?  Good job overall.  Edit: I looked at the picture again and you have zero evidence of sear on the inside, that is very interesting. How long did you sear and what temp?"

steak,3dd3e5,squigglewiggle,2,Wed Jul 15 15:05:23 2015 UTC,"salt the night before, place in fridge overnight to dry out the surface and create a pellicle"
steak,3dd3e5,jhmadden,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:31:17 2015 UTC,"I grew up cooking without a range hood so I know how much it can be a pain when pan frying anything. pan frying was still my main method of choice. I found that the more dry the steak was before searing produced a better crust this is why a reverse sear produces a good crust and salting in the fridge produces better crusts.   I also found that you really don't need much oil. A lot of people coat the pan with oil and it gets all smokey which is fine if you have a hood but in reality only the steak needs to be oiled. A small amount of oil rubbed over the steak before pan searing is fine. Excess oil leads to smoke. butter also smokes at a very low temp so if you're worried about that avoid butter it is not necessary.   I also used a fan that i'd put in the window near the stove that would suck air out of the kitchen which worked pretty well when their was some smoke.   When letting the steak rest elevate it on a rack so it doesnt sit in its own juice. This probably doesnt do much but will allow any crust that formed to stay crusty and not get soggy by sitting in liquid.  Try a reverse sear if you haven't (lowest oven setting, place steak on a rack with temp probe and wait till it reaches 120°F), use just a small amount of oil just for the steak and pan sear it very quickly. let it rest on a rack and see if that was an improvement."

steak,3cz0wp,goodnames679,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:56:26 2015 UTC,"I cooked them Sous Vide with an Anova cooker to 134 for two hours, then finished them off in a cast iron pan with vegetable oil. They were about a pound and a half each, and about two inches thick.  Yes, I know it was a shame to cook them borderline medium (they really came out more like a medium rare, they were redder than the pics would seem), but the other people eating the steaks aren't a fan of rare and I didn't know if I could cook to different temps sous vide. They were still amazing and I am extraordinarily happy with this.  I also made a huge pan of mushrooms, some corn and baked potatoes."
steak,3cz0wp,AGirlNamedRoni,3,Sun Jul 12 02:00:25 2015 UTC,What made you decide to sous vide the first steaks you ever cooked?
steak,3cz0wp,jkvrieaunak,3,Sun Jul 12 03:03:59 2015 UTC,"It seemed like a fairly easy method because you can't really overcook sous vide unless you leave it for too long in the very short searing part, and every steak I saw that way looked fucking sexy. The only downside I could find to it was that it was a bit expensive to get into, but it was worth it.  Also, I wanted to be able to make the best steaks ever because this was a practice run for my girlfriend's birthday. I want to make her something amazing for it, so I didn't mind shelling out the cash."

steak,3cu7c6,anbeav,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:48:18 2015 UTC,"Follow Anbeav's advice for cooking method.  The thicker the steak the better because it's easier to get a nice crust and keep it medium rare.  With regard to sides, it depends on how much effort you want to put in.  Easiest side I make is roasted asparagus.  Salt, pepper, olive oil -- roast at 400 for 25 minutes.  I personally don't prefer starchy vegetables like potatoes with steak, because I find them too heavy.  I prefer more steak.  I usually go with greens like asparagus, creamed spinach, or a salad."
steak,3cu7c6,Jaizeal,-1,Sat Jul 11 04:03:11 2015 UTC,"That's because potatoes are not considered a vegetable man they are a starch, you are supposed to have both.  Also it sounds like you cook the shit out of your asparagus"
steak,3cu7c6,stinkypinky12,-1,Sat Jul 11 18:00:37 2015 UTC,Potatoes are a vegetable my friend whether you want to classify them as a starch or not. Either way it's arbitrary for this discussion.  I said I don't enjoy potatoes with steak because it's heavy.  That's all. And you don't have to enjoy roasted asparagus but it's a standard recipe with standard timing.
steak,3cu7c6,Jaizeal,-1,Sat Jul 11 18:38:08 2015 UTC,"potatoes botanically are a veg yes, no nutritionist is going to consider them that though hence the word ""considered""  those things just turn into sugars in your body.  You can get diabetes from eating too many french fries for fucks sakes.  If you eat potatoes thinking they are your veg for the day you are going to turn into lard  as for your asparagus you can turn your oven up 25 more degrees and you wont have to cook it so long no longer then 15 mins and it will be perfect. thats why i dont get why you would need 10 whole minutes more for 400 degrees vs's 425 thats all"

steak,3crq3s,SLARGMONSTER,3,Fri Jul 10 06:11:54 2015 UTC,"I usually sear my steaks with a dry pan, but if you get your cast iron hot enough and you season your oil well enough, you can get some really nice flavors. I've started using a combination of oil and butter, along with whole peeled garlic cloves and fresh rosemary sprigs and have had wonderful results."
steak,3crq3s,mist3rlin,2,Fri Jul 10 13:34:55 2015 UTC,IMO if you really want that flavor in your steak you should marinade the thing.  But a marinade steak is usually a sin in my eyes.  As for dry pan I'm not sure I have always thought to add just a little oil when searing any meats
steak,3crq3s,stinkypinky12,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:27:14 2015 UTC,"I typically reverse sear and what I do is put safflower oil in the cast iron pan and get it super hot.  After I sear one side, I add in butter and let it melt, and then baste the steak with it by constantly pouring the hot butter onto the meat for the remainder of the sear.  It really helps develop a nice flavorful crust.  Plus: the sizzle is mildly arousing."

steak,3cd9qt,The_Kitten_Stimpy,3,Tue Jul 7 00:35:42 2015 UTC,"My best recommendation would be a ribeye or chuckeye as far as flavor and tenderness. The chuckeye will be a lot cheaper and nearly as tender. I would also not recommend marinating them. I don't mind it on a cheaper cut of steak, but to me at least it masks the flavor more than it enhances it. Simple is best to taste the meat. Keep some clean marinade/sauce on the side if you must, but coating and soaking it is not the best way, at least for me. But I'm getting a bit off what I wanted to say. Any of them with ""eye"" in the name are generally a good steak. Good fat ratio with less connective tissue. They seem to develop the most flavor on a rare to medium rare."

steak,3cd9qt,synackrst,2,Tue Jul 7 15:42:02 2015 UTC,"Pardon me for coming in late to the conversation, but let me disagree with the other responders.  Ribeye is indeed a wonderful cut of steak.  However, the one challenge with it is that the rendering fat tends to cause flareups when grilling.  If you're just branching out and trying a new grill, I would suggest that you go with a strip steak.  It's still an excellent cut, and you'll find it far more flavorful than tenderloin, but without the risk of massive flare-ups that you can have with a ribeye."

Like some other guys said, you might want to let it rest before cutting into it, that's probably what they're doing on youtube.  Even letting it rest usually won't keep all the juices in though, which is fine. It's just delicious, nutritious meat juice which happens to also be the source of color for the meat. Nothing to worry about."

Resting doesn't allow 100% of the juices to reabsorb, so you'll always have a little bit...  and I find no one worries about what they can't see. I still don't think I could get my brother to eat a steak as rare as I like them (and you won't catch me eating mine blue). The best solution for picky eaters who think leather (past medium) is the only way to eat a steak is to do pre-slice the meat on a cutting board or serving platter, then plate it for them. You'll have less red blood looking juice, and they'll be amazed by the flavor, and convert."

steak,3ccldo,nomnomnompizza,4,Mon Jul 6 21:27:43 2015 UTC,"I believe the answer is in the slow cooking many steakhouses do. Sous Vide is the most popular and effective way to slowly cook down the fat so it remains tender, but roasting in an oven at low temp for a period of 45 minutes to several hours also works, the trick there is to not let your meat dry out, while also keeping temperature high enough to effectively cook the meat/fat. If you're like me, and don't want to spend hours babying a steak, you probably just let your steak thaw and/or come to room temp, then slap it into a hot skillet (or grill, in my case) for 6-10 minutes, both establishing a good sear, and heating it up to whatever doneness you prefer in the center... while delicious, you'll never get your fat the often up, usually the opposite - it will dry and shrivel and become tougher and chewy - and lack flavor."

steak,3bw9p3,yetanothercfcgrunt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:50:45 2015 UTC,I think it has a lot to do with how the chicken was slaughtered and how fresh it is. Still not totally sure though

steak,3bx59s,5ft11flip,4,Thu Jul 2 21:50:30 2015 UTC,"Get a good thermometer; a ThermaPen if you can afford it. Timing and relying on your grill's thermometer will not produce reliable, reproducible results, no matter how much you practice."
steak,3bx59s,comfyhead,2,Fri Jul 3 14:11:54 2015 UTC,"If you can't afford the thermapen, get the ThermoPop. Same company, slower read time but still under 6 seconds. I have one and it's great for a budget thermometer!"
steak,3bx59s,Fingerdrip,2,Fri Jul 3 18:57:06 2015 UTC,steaks on a gasser are super simple.  i get mine as hot as possible then 3 minutes on each side. then i adjust the knobs to get my temps down to 225-250ish leaving one burner completely off.  i will leave the lid open a few after this step to help drop the temp.  i place the steaks over the burner that is off until they are done.  i have a 3 burner weber for the record.  there may be better ways but this works really well for me
steak,3bx59s,tonyled,2,Fri Jul 3 05:51:11 2015 UTC,"keep it at 425-450 degrees fahrenheit only using the three burners   Why?--I am guessing this is your problem and why you are getting grey steaks.  You need more HEAT!  My method for medium rare (4 vertical burners):  Let meat get to room temp (out of fridge for 30-45 minutes)  Preheat- All 4 on full w/ lid down.  This tops out my thermometer at over 800.  I have also used an insta laser thermometer...temp is off the charts.  Add steaks over 2 burners.  These will get turned down to about 3/4.  The other two remain full.  The preheat gives a good seer, and turning down the burners prevents burning.  3-4 minutes (depends on thickness of steak)  FLIP, turn down the 2 burners to about 1/2.  3-4 minutes.  Test for correct doneness and cook a tad longer if needed and adjust heat to avoid burning.   If I am doing a medium for someome shiver or well done, I will leave them on over low burners, or off burners while  the other two remain on or near full.  Let indirect heat do the cooking without burning.  DON""T PRACTICE ON EXPENSIVE MEAT!  Look for a managers special section in your grocers meat cooler.  this is stuff that is about to reach the sell by date and needs to move.  Still great to cook that day or within 2-3 days.  I find that Monday morning is a good time to find nice stuff on special.  Meat that didn't sell over the weekend has got to go.  Pull the steaks off just before desired doneness and let them sit for 5-10 minutes before cutting.  There could be better ways, but this is mine."
steak,3bx59s,mechesh,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:34:20 2015 UTC,"Reverse sear is the better way.  Edit: to clarify, set oven to 250°, cook seasoned steaks for 45 minutes or until desired final temperature is within 10°. Use a meat thermometer, preferably one with an alarm (got mine at Ikea for like $7.) Finish in a hot skillet. Cast iron works well."
steak,3bx59s,seanbduff,2,Fri Jul 3 21:49:28 2015 UTC,How is a reverse sear any better than a steak properly cooked the traditional way?
steak,3bx59s,mechesh,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:54:45 2015 UTC,"I'm sure your way is fine, and with practice you might get the steak right most of the time. I find that reverse sear produces perfect steaks every time. It's practically foolproof. Plus, I like the low and slow approach that keeps the steaks juicy and tender."

I was actually aiming for burgersville but came across an amazing sale of two of these huge slabs of London Broil for about $6-7 buck each. So, I loaded up and biked home and it was about room temperature from the ride. Gave it lots of Kosher Salt and some Pepper and Nu-Salt (Keto, I need that protein) and let it sit for a little bit. Warmed up the grill to 450, slabbed it on direct heat to sear then moved to indirect til about 125 degrees and took itoff to sit. Pretty rare, but the majority of it is going into pre-packed meals for the next days which when microwaved you want a rarer meat as it will cook a bit more. ends up being a good medium rare to sometimes medium after reheats :-)  But don't get me wrong, I loved that rare fresh off the grill goodness."

steak,3bjv7c,HittingSmoke,7,Tue Jun 30 00:25:04 2015 UTC,This is generally a good practice but with skirt steak it's an absolute requisite. Skirt steak is extremely tough. It's made up of extremely desne muscle fibers with a lot of fat and connective tissue in between them. It must be cooked over extremely high heat to get a proper sear without toughening it up more than it is naturally.  I'm surprised you'd be able to eat it like this without chewing on it for minutes at a time.  I just did some skirts today over my charcoal chimney while smoking some pastrami on the Weber. Had to have a small seminar when I served them about how to properly cut them. They were a huge hit.

steak,3bitzp,truthrises,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:13:26 2015 UTC,"You want the heat even lower than you describe.  I would use 2 quarts of lit charcoal on top of 1 quart of unlit charcoal against one side of the grill with a small pan of hot water on the other side. It seems like a very small amount of charcoal, this is good. You could also add a block of soaked smoking wood, if you want smokey flavor. (16 briquettes ~ 1 quart)  This will hopefully only reach about 200-250 degrees. If you can work the air vents (more air = hotter) you can get temperature pretty low.   I use a probe thermometer and try to hit 115F before I take it off and tent loosely with foil to rest for 5-10 minutes. The temperature will go up 8-10 degrees from when you pull it off, this puts as at a medium rare.  Salt, pepper, olive oil to taste.  For the sear, you will want to get a full charcoal chimney going, skewer the steak at least twice and cook it over the coals literally on the chimney. The skewers should rest on the chimney without the meat touching the coals directly. 30-45 seconds on each side."
steak,3bl2be,vendet,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:24:24 2015 UTC,It was the carry-over.  You're supposed to lightly tent the steaks to rest not seal them for this exact reason
steak,3bkpnj,macbookproearly2011,2,Tue Jun 30 00:38:26 2015 UTC,It will not dry it out.   There are two generally accepted great times to season a steak.. Right before cooking it or an hour or more before you are going to cook it.   If you choose the longer time between seasoning and cooking just make sure its 40+ minutes between seasoning and cooking.
steak,3bkpnj,platinumchef,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:45:19 2015 UTC,"""Truth of the matter is that you should salt your meat about 40 minutes before it hits the grill. When the salt first hits a steak, it sits on the surface. Through the process of osmosis, it'll slowly draw liquid out of the meat, which you'll see pool up in little droplets. As those droplets grow, the salt will dissolve in the meat juice, forming a concentrated brine. At this stage in the game—about 25 to 30 minutes in—your steak is in the absolute worst shape possible for grilling. That moisture will evaporate right off, leaving you with a tough, stringy crust. Give it a bit more time, and eventually that brine will begin to break down some of the muscle tissue in the meat, allowing the juices to be re-absorbed, and taking the salt right along with it.""  if you're gonna preseason it up to 4 days in advance, it might be wise to put in back in the fridge."

steak,3b4ykl,letthisnightexplode,10,Fri Jun 26 16:43:15 2015 UTC,"the process of reverse searing is very simple, yet extremely easy to mess up. for me, the process went something like this:   prep the steaks the night prior. pat dry, sea salt, montreal steak rub. place on a rack, put it in the fridge overnight. pull the steaks out at least 30 minutes before. gas oven. @275 for about 20 minutes on an elevated rack so the heat goes all around. these are a little on the thin side, maybe 1.5"" pulled out, internal temp was prolly around 113 (most people swear by 120-125, but i like to sear it hard and longer than most because i like my crust). DEAR GOD, LET THE MEAT REST HERE. cast iron skillet pan, about as hot as it can get. tablespoon of canola oil, couple of knobs of butter, 3 whole cloves of garlic (peeled). maybe 2 min a side, flip every 30 seconds. pull off, another knob of butter on top afterwards and serve em up"

Stoke up the cast iron pan or grill and sear each side for 1 minute.  The steak will be cooked evenly instead of at different levels.   TL;DR - Get some beef, throw in oven, finish on grill."

steak,3awc61,Zombies_Are_Dead,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:43:26 2015 UTC,"What I recommend is vacuum seal them, then put them in a cooler of ice, salt, and water. It will bring them near freezing before you toss them in the freezer. They will freeze quickly and have minimal tissue damage. One mistake people make is taking meat from the store, into a warm car, then right in the freezer. At the minimum, refrigerate again until it gets to the coldest possible temp for the appliance. The salt, water, and ice will bring it far below what your fridge would usually do. It's also amazing for chilling drinks. It gets far colder than ice alone. I learned it while working at Godfathers Pizza. We salted the ice on the salad bar and it super cooled it and kept it colder longer."

Wet Aged Beef. Most meat is shipped from slaughter houses as large wholesale cuts packed in plastic vacuum bags in boxes. If kept this way at 34 to 38°F for about 30 days, enzymes tenderize the meat, but the flavor is not as enhanced as it is in dry aging. If you buy vacuum packed beef that has not been aged, keeping it in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks may tenderize it a bit."

What sold me was seeing food inspectors using them to verify that various foods were stored at the right temperature. What really sealed the deal was that each ThermaPen has a certificate to authenticate its' accuracy. I've bought them as presents for family and friends, that's how much I love them. It's the only thermometer that I use regularly for meats...  That being said, you can probably get something cheaper than the $99 price tag of a ThermaPen that's mostly as accurate, and nearly as fast.

steak,3avpm4,therealpdrake,3,Tue Jun 23 22:06:36 2015 UTC,"i have the Thermoworks ChefAlarm and i am very happy with it. it is a leave-in probe not an instant-read, so you only poke one hole and it provides a constant temperature reading throughout cooking. has alarms to notify you when your steak reaches target temp. pretty nifty and makes reverse-searing a cinch."

steak,3avpm4,peter5ol,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:00:15 2015 UTC,"It's not clear if you're looking for just probes or a thermometer with probe.  The best meat probe I've ever used without argument is model 113-151 from Thermoworks: http://www.thermoworks.com/products/probe/tc_penetration.html (Can't link directly to products on that site)  It's needle-thin and fast when I plug it into my Fluke meter. I love it.  If you need a meter and probe together, just grab a Thermapen from the same web site. You can get them for ~$80 on sale and they're the best you can get in temp taking equipment without going up to something larger and more modular."

From everything I have read/seen/watched its more of just vacuum sealing it, setting a temp and then leaving it for a period of time."
steak,3asnvv,propellerhead92,5,Tue Jun 23 14:32:00 2015 UTC,"You don't even need a vacuum sealer. You can just use ziplock bags and leave the top open a bit as you submerge, the water pressure will push the remaining air out and you can seal it up.  The only thing you really need is an immersion circulator which are, unless you can find one on sale, about $200. There are various ways to hack the process for less and you can always just use a temp probe and just micromanage the stove. The biggest benefit of the immersion circulator is that you can set and forget while you make the other stuff."

steak,3auo3y,macbookproearly2011,11,Tue Jun 23 17:28:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're over cooking it. Medium well is at a stage where the taste and consistency of the beef itself changes completely.   On the Internet, at least, you will be told that rare-med-rare is where you want to cook a steak if it is to be properly enjoyed. I agree with this, but if you really prefer medium well then this is your choice!   I suspect overcooking will influence the juices because when you start cooking past med-rare, the juices will start pooling up on the top of the steak anyway. Coupled with the fact that there will be a bit of juices being spilled over regardless of what you do, it isn't too surprising to see that there is a ""pile"".  So, cook less, and don't do the aluminum coffin thing. Lightly cover it with foil but leave PLENTY of room for air to escape, because if you don't, you're just steaming the meat and thus cooking it further instead of trying to keep it warm while the juices come to a rest."

steak,3auo3y,GreySoulx,2,Tue Jun 23 21:44:03 2015 UTC,Try the reverse sear.  You cook the inside first slowly and then hit it with high heat for just a minute or two to sear the outside.  It also makes it easier to hit your target temp.

steak,3anu9e,MrWhippie,2,Mon Jun 22 03:00:47 2015 UTC,I was in America last year and i ordered a prime rib. I was expecting a rib eye steak and out came something that looked like yours only not as good. I was disappointed cos it wasn't a steak it was a thick slice of roast beef.   My question is to americans. This is nice and all but wouldnt you guys rather cut that up into some badass steaks and have crust all over it rather than just a ring of crust around the border?   No offense. I just think its kind of a tragedy to do this to a top cut of beef.   Can someone explain the appeal to me? I'm open to it.
steak,3anu9e,benwaaaaaaaah,4,Mon Jun 22 12:02:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I agree with you. Prime rib is delicious but I love a crispy crust on both sides and not just on the edges.  For me, it's more about tradition and convenience. My whole family comes over and a hunk of meat like this can serve anywhere from 7-13 people. With steaks, you'd have to cut them 1.75 inches or so thick which wouldn't serve as many people. And it'd be hard to cook that many pieces of meat at once and time it right. A prime rib comes out with a couple medium pieces on the ends if you cook it to medium rare so depending on your diners' preference, there's usually a piece for everyone. If I cut it into steaks, I'd be testing each one with the meat thermometer to make sure they're the correct temperature (I don't have the gift of guesswork).   Plus, you can't beat the gravy that comes from the drippings of a roast like this. But if I was only cooking for a couple people or I was getting steak at a restaurant, I'd definitely go for a ribeye instead of prime rib. If you're interested, check out my other posts, ribeyes are my favorite haha."

If you do a youtube search of Gordon Ramsay's cast iron approach, it's basically the process I've tried to emulate.  Edit:  I flip a bunch in cast iron since you're doing to get a uniform sear across the face of the steak, but if using a grill, it's a different story.  There it's grill, flip, flip + Rotate 45 degrees + flip.  That way you get the nice cross hatched grill marks."

steak,3ajb0x,YaketyMax,3,Sat Jun 20 19:15:52 2015 UTC,"Looks good. I've cooked steaks like that with great results. What I'm starting to go to though is a high heat indirect cooking on a grill.   I open all of my vents on my charcoal grill and get the temperature up to around 450f. I put the seasoned steaks on indirect but close to the charcoal and close the lid. After 8 minutes I flip the steaks and cook for another 8 minutes.  Take the steaks off and let rest 10 minutes. You'll have a nice crust with slightly pink inside. And it will take less than 30 minutes.  After eating steaks at places like Ruth Chris, I've been trying to figure out to cook a good thick steak and not spend an hour doing it."

steak,3ajb0x,DeezleDan,2,Sat Jun 20 21:28:23 2015 UTC,Replace that pan with a normal-bottomed cast iron pan. You're only searing like 20% of the steak's surface with that thing.

steak,3ak8eg,rmeds,2,Sun Jun 21 00:38:24 2015 UTC,"If you're reverse searing, no. You don't cook based off of time, rather, based off internal temperature. As soon as it hits 120 (for rare, and actually, I'll pull it at 110 because I truly love rare), that's when the meat has cooked. If you've aged it yourself, make sure you get rid of that outer-most waxy layer. That won't taste so good haha  A minute sear might be too much though if you want that true ""even"" cooking thing (which I dont agree with, because a godly crust with a slight region of well done is definitely alright, if not better. Edit: I mean better in terms of personal taste. I take a glorious sear over a 100% even red every time). Instead, try a minute sear on each side total with constant flipping. 30 seconds a flip for two flips should work wonders in terms of sear and the even cooking thing.   Or go over the fire and let the magic happen in no time! Haha. That sort of brings me to the next point: your sear time depends on what you're searing on. For example, I wouldn't sear a steak as long over some wonderful direct heat as I would over a cast iron, per sé."

Remote too. You can set alarms for when your meat comes to temp or when the barbie gets to or drops below a set temp.   Thermapen make THE most accurate domestic use thermometer there is. Its fast too. Just jab it in the meat and get real time temps real quick. Its so accurate you can watch the temp go up and down in fractions of a degree just by taking the lid off the bbq / the meat off the heat.   I own both. I highly recommend you do too.

steak,3acyy5,jonobate,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:08:56 2015 UTC,word of advice: use a good cooking thermometer. doing a proper reverse sear is highly temperature dependent so you need to be able to monitor the internal temp of your steak very closely.   this image from the subreddit sidebar is a pretty good guide for target temperatures. just remember your steak will continue to rise in temp for a few minutes after removing from the oven so you may want to set your thermometer alarm for a few degrees below your target temp.
steak,3agf32,Eggseronius,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:01:30 2015 UTC,"Tri tip is always a good bet. If you want it to be a steak I would go ribeye or strip. Not sure if you will really get the full smoke flavor if you only bring it up to ~120 in the smoker and then sear it, but it would probably be pretty darn good."
steak,3aeo8k,green_and_yellow,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:43:08 2015 UTC,"Sounds right to me; I've only done reverse sear a couple times now but I get the internal temp to about 125 then pulled them out of the oven let them rest and then seared. Worked out well for me. If you haven't gotten the steaks yet, you could always just get them slightly thinner steaks and it would be about equal time; when I grill for a bunch of people I usually just tell the people who want the more well done meat to select the smaller cuts."

Also, it cooks like a ribeye."

steak,39x1it,HerpDerpinAtWork,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:00:46 2015 UTC,"Conveniently, I've already written this up in needlessly deep detail for a group of friends. Here you go:    Initial feedback on Snake River Farms: beef was great, but I felt like I overpaid a bit.  The following review will be conducted sans-visual aids, because I got a late start on cooking and was rushing around a little to get everything finished on time. Anyway:  I ordered 4 10 oz ribeyes at $37/cut from Snake River Farms. These were their ""Black"" grade of steaks. They claim the baseline for their black grade starts at about a 6 on the Japanese beef grading system, and their (more expensive) ""Gold"" grade starts around a 9. USDA Prime, for reference, is generally going to be in the 4-5 ballpark. http://wagyu.org/breed-info/meat-grading/ has some nice reference material for beef grading if you've never taken a dive into it - really quite interesting stuff there, in particular the difference between the USDA system (and its shortcomings with respect to heavily marbled steaks) and the Japanese system. Back to Snake River Farms - they state on their site that all their steaks are aged for 28 days, although I'm pretty confident that that's wet as opposed to dry-aging, since if it was dry-aged they would almost certainly call that out explicitly (and charge even more for it).  When you order, even the free standard shipping option allows you to specify day-definite delivery, which was nice for planning purposes. The steaks arrived frozen and heavily packed in dry ice. No danger of these things arriving thawed. They were cut in such a way that they were basically a thick rectangle of meat. They were also very carefully trimmed in such a way that VERY little of the intermuscular fat (as opposed to the intramuscular fat that is the glorious, glorious marbling) that you normally see on a ribeye remained.  Pros: Basically all 10 oz of the 10oz weight was meat. Potential meh: You're counting on the intra-muscular fat/marbling to lend all the flavor. I didn't miss it personally. Minor gripe: The steaks were pretty inconsistently cut. Two were great, thick cuts (pushing 2 inches for sure), and the other two were noticeably thinner. Certainly not too thin, but given the fairly extreme degree of nontraditional trimming that they seem to receive, it was... unexpected. One one hand - let's get real - nobody I'm cooking for is going to get precious about whether or not the 10oz ribeye on their plate looks exactly the same as the 10 oz ribeye on the plate across the table from them, but at the price point these are sold at, the variation just bothered me. Plus, if you're cooking them traditionally, you have to account for the different thicknesses. A minor irritation, to be sure, but also one you don't get if you're having a butcher cut your meat for you.  Fortunately, all the little weirdness aside, they cooked up just fine. Salted 'em, let 'em sit for an hour or so, cooked 2 hours sous vide at 132F, cracked black pepper, seared on a skillet with garlic cloves, thyme, and rosemary as aromatics. Everyone raved about them, and in my opinion they were indeed very good, but my honest review is basically this:  The Snake River Farms steaks were good - great even, but I didn't feel like there was enough distance between, say, the dry-aged Prime ribeye I can have Giant Eagle [my local grocery store with the slightly better-than-average meat counter] cut me any day of the week and what I got from Snake River Farms to justify the fairly substantial price jump. Maybe I'd be more impressed by their Gold grade, but given that the price jumps another $13/cut, I doubt it.  The next time I find reason to splurge on something ""better than prime"" again, I'll be making a point to find somewhere local (Strip District Meats?) that carries beef that has a) been graded on the Japanese scale and b) that I can look at with my own eyeballs and have cut to my preferences before buying."

steak,39s0m1,dorekk,0,Mon Jun 15 13:20:42 2015 UTC,People who smoke out their houses are using too much oil or the wrong oil. I barely use any and the smoke is easily handled by the stove hood.   As long as you can get an internal temp of around 130 it won't be rare. And a good sear tastes great.   Not saying your method is wrong. Or that it tastes bad.

It's unlikely that you're looking at utility or cutter grade meat either, it's probably more like Select grade.     Edit:   I didn't realize it was a Dollar Tree in the photo.   I should look more closely.

You can throw the frozen steak (still in the vac pack) into a pot of cold water and slowly bring it to a boil.  By the time it's hot, the meat is thawed out and not re-cooked.

I lightly salt and add a little garlic and toss in the fridge(of course drippings and all).   I do a few things with it. Ill warm it up and eat it strait... Thats boring but efficient.   For breakfast Ill put 8-16oz in a bowl and warm it up. Then top it with bacon, cheese, over easy eggs, butter and all the pan grease. Salt/pepper.  Ill also make with a burger patty. For a snack Ill portion some out, add cumin, chilli powder, salt and eat it with pork rinds.     Make meatloaf. Use crushed pork rinds as a breading substitute. I like to put a bacon weave on top. Speaking of bacon weaves there are 'fatties' which are usually ground sausage but I use beef sometimes. I just stuff a loaf with cheese/ham/bacon then wrap the whole thing in bacon and cook to temp.   Theres also beer can burgers. Basically a hollowed out burger stuffed with things wrapped in bacon.

The gum thickens the drippings so it doesn't sit on the bottom of the container, it sticks to the meat.  When combined with the tiny bit of seasoning it made something like a sauce.

steak,39e7fd,Nickvee,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:10:21 2015 UTC,I out them in a good heavy aluminium or steel pan at room temp. The same properties that conduct heat in a pan should help the thawing. An inch thick steak takes about an hour.   I sometimes chat and defrost partially in a pan then put in marinade; that speeds it up a bit too.
steak,39e7fd,crepuscula,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:30:26 2015 UTC,"Echo on this. I have a thick aluminum baking pan - like 1/4 inch thick, and it thaws  and gets to room temperature rather quickly (WoHoo for Thermal Conductivity!).

steak,395xfl,biggjoe4u2,2,Fri Jun 12 02:13:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not referring to just the cut of meat, I'm talking about the entire dining experience. A dinner for two at a nice steakhouse, with appetizers and a few drinks, will run you $300+. Even though you only came for the steak, you end up paying a premium on absolutely everything - beverages/alcohol, side dishes, sauces (yes, most high end joints will charge a few bucks for a side of bearnaise), dessert, tip, taxes, and parking.  To me it comes down to the bang for your buck, and the fact that they're not adding much value to the steak. The above scenario is much easier to stomach at other nice restaurants, where you get an elegant dish that is painstakingly crafted from exotic ingredients.  I literally just finished eating a steak I cooked here at home for dinner. It took a total of 9 minutes in the over with zero effort, and I would put it up against a fancy steakhouse steak any day.  ...That being said, I know 10% price figure is a bit of an exaggeration"

There is virtually no reason to get a t-bone and a porterhouse, as they are essentially the same cut of meat(a t-bone steak with a tenderloin and a strip). Porterhouse is just cut from further down, and thus will have a larger tenderloin.

steak,397aia,momomotorboat,2,Tue Jun 9 19:42:58 2015 UTC,"At Whole Foods the meat is graded based on its 5-Step Animal Welfare Rating, it doesn't undergo the choice, prime rating (for the most part - some chops have started carrying prime beef with a Step 1 animal welfare rating). So sometimes the steaks look prime, sometimes they are more like choice. I haven't seen anything that has any less marbling than something that would be labelled choice at a conventional grocer.   So at Whole Foods, I wouldn't say the ""grade"" matters when it's dry aged, but the marbling still matters. Look at the dry aged steaks, are they well-marbled? If so, then they will taste better!"
steak,397aia,eatmeat,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:54:01 2015 UTC,Sure it does. You want a lot of marbling also a nice fat cap to protect the meat and give you less waste. Go to Costco and get a choice primal(strip/ribeye/sirloin) bone in is even better since it protects one side of the meat from air too.

Secondly... It was stupid for many reasons. Yes sedatives and any other drugs can enter muscle because they're in the bloodstream, it doesn't matter how close you cut from the organs. There are long withdrawal periods for most pharmaceutical drugs before food producing animals enter the food chain for that reason. However what would concern me more, is that meat is carefully inspected at the abattoir before it is certified suitable to eat and free of disease, and clearly your meat did not undergo any sort of verification of safety before you ate it. And something tells me that a dodgy tourist trap like this that compromises animal welfare is not the most stringent in its healthcare practices for its animals.

Let rest for 10-15 minutes to let the salt do its magic for the maillard reaction that's coming next,   More bad advice. 15 minutes is long enough for the salt to have begun to pull moisture out of the steak, but not long enough for the steak to start reabsorbing the moisture.

steak,38y0mh,dontgiveadamn,3,Sun Jun 7 20:53:40 2015 UTC,You bake it until the internal temp is 120-130 then sear it on both sides in high heat.    Sous vide is also good method but I find that they both have a similar result.

steak,38uhz1,whyisthiscat,4,Sat Jun 6 23:07:07 2015 UTC,That steak you posted in the pic looks horrible.   When i get a strip w/bone in.   It normally has a good chink a far but the steak is normally atleast an inch thick or larger.    I ask the butcher to leave all the fat it on.  I sear the shit out of it on the grill after it has reached the slightly over the rare point to hopefully still come out med - rare which is my fav. The fat comes out to melt in your mouth.

Usually that fat on steak needs to render out by standing it up on the fat side for a 2 minutes or so. Then it will be sweet delicious fatty goodness.

steak,38p9p3,TreChomes,2,Fri Jun 5 18:26:07 2015 UTC,"If I'm grilling I do the same and get my grill to at least 500 usually a bit higher. I get my steaks out and salt them as soon as I get them out then let them rest for a while, let's say 30-45 min. After that pat them dry to get rid of surface moisture. I then put pepper on the steak and a bit more salt. (I know some people say the pepper burns but I don't notice a change in taste or don't mind it) I then oil the grates using paper towel, although oiling the steak might work better. I usually do about 5-6 min per side maybe more on the first side than the second. I don't do the 45 degree turn, my marks don't show too much and that's the only reason to do it. Let it rest for about 5-10 min the chow down."

I'm still trying to get the whole thing down, but here's what I do:  *1. Same as you, let it get to room temp or colder  *2. Season with either coffee rub (something I saw from the spice lab or whatever) or Lawry's (not too much but just enough can't afford to overdo it with Lawry's)  *3 Let it set for about 15 minutes and start heating my pan so the seasoning gets in good.  *4 Put olive oil in pan and let it heat.  *5 When hot enough put some butter in pan (doubt this helps anything, just something I do)  *6 Drop heat to medium (steak takes longer to cook, but it comes out good imo)  *7 Let it cook flipping every 2-3 minutes  *8 get steak off pan, put a top over it and let it rest (credit to that one person on here that rested their steak like that... Thanks)  *9 same as your 9"
steak,38p9p3,sinistermuffin,2,Wed Jun 17 19:22:23 2015 UTC,"Butter can actually burn if you put it in too early in the process, so it might be better for you to add the butter after the steak has cooked for a little bit. You can then baste the steak, spooning the hot liquid fats over the steak, which allows any aromatics/flavoring you have in the pan to really soak into the meat, and providing a constant source of heat on the side of the steak not touching the pan (resulting in a more evenly cooked steak)."
steak,38p9p3,goldmouthdawg,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:01:12 2015 UTC,Very interesting. I like cooking thicker steaks but it always seems like one side is getting that burned look while the other side is going and yet you can tell that inside it's still too rare.   I will remember this and give it a shot next time I give it a go. Thanks.

steak,38e42g,Vostok17,2,Wed Jun 3 20:30:30 2015 UTC,"I am sort of with you.  The conventional wisdom is to get the cast iron as HOT as possible.  I have done this several times.  Most recently I put the cast iron on my high-BTU homebrewing setup, and got it ridiculously hot.  But with that kind of heat I ended up cooking the steak for about 10 seconds on each side. In just ten seconds I burnt little portions, and didn't get the sort of perfect Maillard goodness I was looking for.  Not to mention the butter could light on fire (or at a minimum, burn) at super high temps.  TL;DR I find the conventional wisdom that the cast iron to should be as HOT as possible to be quite suspect.  I'm not opposed to any process that gets me the Maillard I'm looking for without over-charring."
steak,38e42g,ConcreteKahuna,2,Wed Jun 3 21:14:11 2015 UTC,What temperature was the the surface of the pan?
steak,38e42g,snid6505,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:25:33 2015 UTC,That sounds like a terrible amount of time to cook some steaks if you're going to have to light some charcoal to grill them anyway. I'm sure it was delicious though. I'm a big fan of ATK.
steak,38e42g,BigTex666,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:33:23 2015 UTC,I don't understand the reason for this. Just get a hot charcoal grill and cook for 90 seconds on each side for a perfect steak. Why bother with the oven at all.
steak,38e42g,aznspryd,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:24:06 2015 UTC,"""Remove the skewers from the steaks and watch all of your juices run out."" You're much better off putting a grill rack over the chimney. Why complicate things with skewers?"
steak,38e42g,CercleRouge,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:25:03 2015 UTC,Yep. That's how I do.  My method:  1/3 chimney of Kingsford blue.   Get grill to 200-250.   Throw a handful or a couple chunks of wood on the coals.   Put steaks on with a temp probe in a smaller one.  Light half chimney of lump coal when steaks get to about 95-100.  Pull steaks at 115.  Put grate right on top of the chimney starter.  Sear em how you like em.  I've done it all in the kitchen. But I love the smoke/coal flavor too much to not do it.
steak,38cu7a,Chinglish123,2,Wed Jun 3 11:48:30 2015 UTC,What's a reverse sear?  Never heard of it.
steak,38cu7a,NoItNone,6,Wed Jun 3 17:07:25 2015 UTC,"Instead of the pan searing technique which can leave bands of grey overcooked meat on the steak the reverse sear is a seasoned steak put in the oven at 200°F and let to cook until it reaches 10°F below desired finishing temp. After letting it rest for 10-25 min, on a super hot cast iron pan (Usually pre heat mine at 600°F in the oven) Sear the steaks! After you develop a nice brown crust, straight to the plate no need to rest the steaks again."

steak,38cu7a,NoItNone,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:05:48 2015 UTC,"Was planning my first reverse sear tonight with some grass fed eye fillets I picked up at the weekend (250g~). Borrowed a thermometer from work, even blanched the chips too ready for the feast. Got them in a 125C oven for no more than five minutes and the other half gets in from work saying she is STARVING, and cant wait for me to keep these in the oven for ages before frying them! I managed to leave them in for another ten mins before putting them into a hot pan, thank god I put them in at room temp! Anyway, after resting mine for a while, here is the result. I was pretty pleased in the end, one of the best ones I've cooked. Thanks /r/steak for your inspiration!  Served it up with some chunky chips, salad, home made Aoli and a nice glass of Shiraz."

steak,38anei,Grazfather,10,Wed Jun 3 01:59:30 2015 UTC,The steak was about 3 inches thick so I pulled it out of the fridge about an hour before cooking to bring it to room temp. I sprinkled kosher salt on it while it sat out. Then I covered it in Montreal steak seasoning and popped it into the oven at 300 degrees until the digital thermometer read 129 degrees. It rose to 132 while it rested. Then I seared it in a cast iron skillet with olive oil and crushed garlic cloves and basted it with melted butter. Best birthday present ever!

If we got sent to a new job that was a long drive, we'd pre-cook some sides, grab a few steaks and beers, throw it all in his fridge.

steak,37ff43,jbl429,2,Wed May 27 15:23:23 2015 UTC,"Cooking your steak with a cast iron pan is possibly the best steak you'll make.  Even if you don't like a sear, you can sear it as hard or soft as you like.  Best and most consistent results will be if you use a thermometer.  I have the ThermoWorks DOT thermometer, and it's great.  Easy process for the reverse sear would be:  1) Salt the steak and let it sit for an hour.  This allows the steak to absorb the salt and bring out the flavor.  2) Put vegetable oil (or olive oil depending on preference) on both sides of the steak.  3) Put the steak on a baking rack and put the it in the oven at 275 F until the internal temperature is 115 F.  This is my preference, but most people recommend 125 F.  This may be better for you since you're likely going to sear for a shorter amount of time.  4) Take the steak out of the pan and let it sit on a plate for 15 minutes.  While it's cooling off, heat the cast iron on the stove top to top heat.  5) Put the steak back on the cast iron to sear.  Most people recommend flipping often.  If you like it medium, sear until the internal temperature is around 130-135 F. Keep a close eye on this because it can raise quite quickly.  6) Let it sit off the heat for a few minutes and enjoy."
steak,37ff43,seanbduff,2,Wed May 27 18:33:47 2015 UTC,I don't understand why this is being downvoted. The reverse sear is hands down the best way to cook a steak in a pan (assuming you also have an oven.)
steak,37ff43,supahflyTNT,2,Sat May 30 06:15:39 2015 UTC,"Well this REALLY depends on how thick the steak is in order to determine to length of time to sear. If I was searing a 1/4 inch steak I would get the pan hot. like HOT. HOTT HOTTT HHOOOTTTTTT. Slather your steaks in olive oil, DO NOT OIL THE PAN.   Sear for a couple minutes on each side. reduce heat and continue to cook through for a few minutes. while cooking pour on some butter and rosemary.  Baste the steak with the melted butter and rosemary.   Take it off once desired done-ness is reached."

A crust will form when you pan sear, but it's not some thick, hard crust or anything like that. the recipe is extraordinarily simple: steak, salt, pepper, canola oil."
steak,37ff43,William_Harzia,1 point,Wed May 27 18:32:59 2015 UTC,"Here's my method for two steaks:   Generously oil and preheat cast iron pan on med-high. Season steaks with lots of kosher salt and fresh cracked pepper. When the oil is just smoking put the steaks in. Flip every 30 seconds making sure to tilt the pan to dribble hot oil onto where the steaks are going to lay (this creates a great crust). After 6 flips add: 1/2 cu red wine, 1 minced shallot, 1 sprig rosemary, 1 sprig thyme, and 1/4 cu Worcestershire (obviously you put this all together in a bowl ahead of time). Keep flipping and tilting the pan every 30 seconds. After 10-12 flips add a knob of butter and flip one more time. Remove steaks, turn off the heat, and let them rest for 5 minutes. Pour the pan juices over top and serve.    Variations:    My wife adds beef stock or demi-glace to the pan juices and makes an awesome sauce while the steaks rest. Sometimes I'll do a reverse sear, and my wife will make the sauce on its own.   Warnings:   Use a fucking timer for Christ's sake. You can't estimate 30 seconds reliably.  After adding the liquid ingredients the pan will cool right down, so you should probably crank the heat up temporarily for 3 or 4 flips. Use a higher temp oil. I use Canola. On a room temp, 1 1/4 in steak this method should give you a med-rare or med steak. There are many variables so this takes practice. Don't try this without a heavy pan. Lighter pans will not retain enough heat to give you an even cook.   Good luck!"

Salt your steak the day before and let it sit in the fridge uncovered overnight. Make sure air can get to all sides. This will help bring the salt into the steak and dry the outside a bit to increase the sear.   Edit: I've been messing around with the oven temp quite a bit and Im pretty sure you do not need to warm the steak to room temp and 225f produces no more gradient than 170f while being a lot quicker.  I even go as high at 250f on steaks and 275f for pork without much added gradient."

Honestly I bought the biggest one i could find so that I can use it for other things. My cast iron is about 30inches in diameter(it's huge) and I've seen recipes cooking pizza in it. Looks amazing.   For meat thermometers, just get a cheap probe. If you plan on doing other things like roasts and prime rib, you can get a fancy one with an extra long probe and the device sits outside of your oven, allowing you to set an alarm when it reaches a certain temperature."
steak,373o8z,JustSomeGoon_,2,Sun May 24 16:33:08 2015 UTC,Watch out for cheap probes! If you can spare the change get a decent probe. I just bought 2 relatively cheap ones the other day. A digital probe for $15 and a leave-in probe with a programable doneness alarm plus additional wireless attachment for $30. Within 20 mins of opening the package I had slammed the leave-in and associated parts to the ground and stomped them into dust I was so pissed at how poorly it worked. The digital probe sorta works but takes like fucking 3 months to give you the actual temp and I don't think it's calibrated well.  Spend the money and get a decent one that's accurate and gives you a quick reading.  I'm ordering a Thermopen tonight.

steak,373o8z,tonsofpcs,1 point,Sun May 24 22:21:21 2015 UTC,"I've got 3 different sized cast iron pans for different purposes. I have a small one (6"") for eggs, a medium one (10"") for regular duty frying and a large one (14"") for heavy duty searing, also bacon. Two of my pans are Lodge, I forget what the other one is, but you can tell a quality pan by feel.  Your large one for high heat searing should be thick and heavy and flat. Ignore the ones with the slats for grill marks. They're a PITA in more ways than one and they make it tough to keep your pan properly seasoned. This large pan should be heavy. Like, can't lift it comfortably with one hand heavy. Remember you'll be bringing it up to 500-600 degrees, you don't want it to warp.  I use avocado oil for searing. It's the highest heat oil I could find. It's expensive, but I only use a bit at a time so it'll last a while."
steak,373o8z,TheRealMeatloaf,1 point,Sun May 24 18:32:45 2015 UTC,Can you explain exactly how you use the avocado oil and searing? Just bought some and do not want to start a fire or smoke myself out. Any advice you have would be nice.
steak,373o8z,govem,3,Sun May 24 19:10:16 2015 UTC,"Disable your smoke detectors. :p Let your steak rest on the counter for a while, depending on thickness. I usually let a 1.5"" steak rest for about 30-40 minutes, covered in ground sea salt. After the prescribed rest time, heat your cast iron until it's smoking hot (literally). I've got an infra red thermometer that tells me my pan smokes right around the 500 degree mark. With the stove element still at max and the pan still heating, hit it with a healthy splash of the avocado oil. Maybe as much as 1 tbsp. Spread the oil around the pan (use protection when you pick up the pan. Remember, hot). At this point you can sprinkle on some steak seasoning on both sides. I, myself, am partial to The Keg brand seasoning. Place your steak in the pan. I like to place it off center so I can use the other side of the pan for the other side of the steak so each side gets a good sear on a clean piece of iron. (again, for a 1.5"" steak, adjust up or down according to thickness) after about 70-90 seconds, flip your steak to sear side two. This is when I drop the temp of the burner to low. I usually sear the edges of the pan on ""clean"" areas of the iron with the residual heat. Once you've seared all the edges (especially the fat cap), drop your steak back flat on the side you seared first. Now I add butter, garlic clove, and usually thyme (sometimes garlic optional). Let the butter melt, tilt the pan towards you by pushing down on the handle. Have the steak at the 'top' of the pan (away from you) and the butter pool, with aromatics, at the bottom (near you). Now with the steak on a lower heat area, you can take some time to baste the steak by spooning the flavored butter over it to coat. Do this a few times, flip the steak and hit the other side. Liberally. Remove steak from the pan, set it on a plate and cover with tented foil to rest while you plate your sides. At least 7-10 minutes. Enjoy your (hopefully) medium rare steak!   The key is preparation and timing. All your gear needs to be ready at your fingertips before the steak hits the pan.  The timing from smoking pan to oil is about 20 seconds. From oil in the pan to steak in the pan is another 20 seconds. The small splash of oil will heat up near instantly so there's no reason to give it time.  Make sure your range hood is set on max as soon as the pan hits the burner and have a couple windows open. I have a ceiling fan in the dining room directly adjacent to my kitchen so I turn that on as well."

steak,373o8z,govem,0,Sun May 24 20:19:52 2015 UTC,"When you see the meat juices appear on the topside of the steak flip it. When you see the juices appear on the seared side, take it off and let it cool a few mins. When cooking steaks, the juice will appear on top of the steak when the heat has hit the center of the steak. Doing this will give you a rare steak! The perfect steak! :)"

steak,372lx0,swingmymallet,1 point,Sun May 24 07:33:17 2015 UTC,"Depends on the cut and how you/your guests prefer their steak cooked.  Every cut is cooked differently.  I'm guessing if it's a large gathering, you won't be buying many very expensive cuts, so you'll probably have things like T-bone/porterhouse and flank steak.  I suggest looking up how to cook each of those. Quite simply, brine/pepper the t-bone and either marinate or brine/season the flank steak.  I would suggest flank steak because it is very conducive to sharing- you cook one long piece and everyone gets a few slices- nobody is forced to eat a whole steak. So, marinate/dry rub, grill to medium/medium rare if marinated, medium rare/rare if dry rub. Really though, you're going to marinate it 9 times out of 10. Very hot grill (top open), 3 minutes each side, take it off and put it on a butcher's block, let it rest a few minutes, and then you're ready to slice."

Foles was a strange trade, I admit, but I am glad to be rid of McCoy seeing as how he as gone a bit off the rails this offseason.   Murray and Matthews more than replace him with a style of running that I prefer a lot more.  I am glad we got a few upgrades to our receiving corps, so that's good too.  Defense was clearly where we needed the most improvement and I think we got exactly what we needed when it comes to secondary, and our front 7 is looking awesome.  My only concern is that our offense is going to take time getting work together etc because almost all of the major positions are new."

steak,36wsaq,wwjjgg,3,Fri May 22 19:35:27 2015 UTC,"My family generally does a flour dredge. Take some white flour and season it with salt and pepper. Not too much. Take the steaks and put them in the flour an both sides and put them in a hot skillet with a bit of oil or lard and cook until they develop a bit of color on each side and eat. It is delicious. The flour and oil combine with the steak juices and make a light gravy on the surface. THIS is essentially the way we did it. Alternatively, if they are a bit on the gamey side, soak them for a while in milk or buttermilk before dredging. It will remove a bit of the gamey flavor and actually add a bit of flavor. I rarely ever found it necessary though."

It looks less lime green-y than the recipe you posted. I recommend this on a flank steak, seared quick on the grill on both sides, rest for 10 minutes, slice against the grain on a 45ish degree angle and serve.  INGREDIENTS  1 cup firmly packed fresh flat-leaf parsley, trimmed of thick stems  3-4 garlic cloves  2 Tbsps fresh oregano leaves (can sub 2 teaspoons dried oregano)  1/2 cup olive oil  2 Tbsp red or white wine vinegar  1 teaspoon sea salt  1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes  METHOD  1) Finely chop the parsley, fresh oregano, and garlic (or process in a food processor several pulses). Place in a small bowl.  2) Stir in the olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Adjust seasonings. Serve immediately or refrigerate. If chilled, return to room temperature before serving.   Can keep for a day or two."

This is also a good sauce for lamb (as is) or- if you take out the jalapeno and cut back on the parsley and substitute mint (I guess it wouldn't really be a chimmichurri at that point either).  I also wouldn't do this over a ribeye (my personal opinion here), I usually do a chimmichurri over flat irons, skirt, or even some braised meats (ox tails, lamb neck, pork shanks...)  it adds a real pop to the heavy, dense braised meats."

That way you can get some colorization on the steak without steaming the hell out of it from the moisture in the onions. Salting the steak in advance does help as far as seasoning it, but I don't think anything outside of actually brining it is going to do any noticeable tenderizing. Just buy a good steak, like ribeye or even chuckeye, and sear it well, both sides. Allow it to rest as you saute the onions, then enjoy a nice steak with onions."
steak,36ju6x,refrigeratorbob,1 point,Wed May 20 00:50:08 2015 UTC,"Salting for a few hours to overnight is basically brining, except its drawing moisture out. It does tenderize, it also improves flavor."

steak,36dg8f,mastapastawastakenOT,3,Mon May 18 14:43:13 2015 UTC,"Olive oil  If your cast iron was super hot (as it should be for searing), olive oil has a pretty low smoke and will react as it did. Try canola oil or vegetable oil next time, those have high smoke points and won't smoke up as much."
steak,36dg8f,v66fender66v,2,Mon May 18 14:58:55 2015 UTC,"Lots of smoke is normal. However, olive oil has a low smoke point and will actually burn pretty quickly. Burnt olive oil also has a weird taste and the smoke can be toxic. Use clarified butter or canola oil."

steak,36dg8f,canyoudiggitman,1 point,Mon May 18 18:02:13 2015 UTC,Try bacon grease instead of olive oil.
steak,36dg8f,kingbersiii,1 point,Mon May 18 16:49:53 2015 UTC,First time I used my cast iron my apartment was so full of smoke as well.  It got so bad I could barely see in it and it seeped out into my building's hallways.  I used canola oil reading that it should help the problem but it didn't.  I heated up my cast iron in my oven at 500 degrees to start and then put it over high heat on the stove top.  End product was great but really don't want to have to deal with it again.  Was it too hot or do I just have to expect that every time I use the cast iron?
steak,36dg8f,_Samiel_,-3,Thu May 21 00:03:06 2015 UTC,"No, this is normal if the heat is  right--the type of oil used doesn't matter much. I don't do cast iron inside anymore.   Edit: not really sure why I'm getting down voted unless people think that I mean oil doesn't matter much for health reasons, or something. A ton of smoke will occur regardless of the some point."
steak,36dg8f,Syde80,0,Mon May 18 15:29:23 2015 UTC,"Regarding the edit, I'll hazard a guess its because oils smoke at different heat levels.  Olive oil happens to have a rather low smoke point."
steak,36dg8f,SonVoltMMA,2,Tue May 19 02:41:50 2015 UTC,"He's still right, any oil is going to smoke like crazy once your pan comes up to proper temp."
steak,36dg8f,_Samiel_,1 point,Wed May 20 02:46:58 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. What my main point is that the amount of difference a smoke point makes is like having your apartment flooded with 500 gallons of water versus 650--regardless, a flooded apartment sucks shit and is to be avoided. If you sear a steak with proper heat with a cast iron, you will suffer enough smoke to make it annoying no matter if you use canola or flax seed oil...."

They will then be placed in a convection oven (one of those smallish ones) at 250 until the internal temp of the big one is 130 (my husband likes rare and I like medium). Then seared in cast iron with a tiny bit of bacon grease.
steak,366sso,Mr_Namaste,3,Sat May 16 18:39:26 2015 UTC,"You've pretty much touched up on it all. Grill quality will also make a pretty large difference.  That being said, I prefer these flair ups. It's a pretty unusual way to go about it, especially with everything you'll read up here, but I think those flair ups make a steak superb.  Since buying a new grill, the amount of flair ups I get have gone down. To counteract this, I'll get the grill to around a 1000 degrees and place a flat iron inside. Inside the flat iron I'll pour a bit of canola oil and melt some butter. Steak goes right in for about a minute on each side with some rosemary as well to really get some flavor. After this, I'll drop the steaks dripping with this buttery delicious coating right on the grill. It will literally catch on fire at the bottom. With constant flipping, I will allow about 30 seconds a side while flipping the steak (keeping it directly on a flame). The butter and fat content of the beef while drop into the flame, flair up, and just kiss the beef; further adding flavor. Then, when I have a perfect sear on this, it goes back into the cast iron for a quick flip in that herby/ buttery concoction and on a plate for serving. Finish it with flake salt, and it's the best steak every time."

steak,365kb4,cdecdecdecde,6,Sat May 16 10:19:10 2015 UTC,"Dry aged shrinks the beef, concentrating its flavor and tenderizing the meat.

steak,365kb4,TJnova,1 point,Sun May 17 05:58:35 2015 UTC,"Dry aged shouldn't dry out the beef. Maybe the very outer layers, but these should be removed before cooking anyways. Wet aging is aging subprimal cuts (like a ribeye or filet loin, vs a quarter of beef) packed in shrinkwrap, and is generally considered inferior,  although my restaurant does it and the beef is fantastic. Ours is both dry- and wet- aged. Our supplier butchers the cow, and dry ages for a time. The meat is then cut into subprimal (strip, ribeye, filet), and shrink wrapped. We will then age for another few weeks, aiming to get the total aging period up to about 6 weeks, maximum 25% wet aged."

steak,362ckm,petrograd,2,Sat May 16 00:32:10 2015 UTC,"Forgive me if this is a stupid question, but how did you get the even ""color"" all throughout the steak?"
steak,362ckm,petrograd,1 point,Fri May 15 21:07:47 2015 UTC,"It's not a stupid question at all.  Basically what it comes down to (as far as my experience works) is how you cook the meat, you can get this multiple ways:  One method to do this is sous vide, another is the reverse sear, and then there's the way that I like (and probably many others) to cook steak.  I have taken a lot of advice from different chefs and have really tried to put it to good use.  The first is doing a quick sear on a nice, hot pan (I favor cast iron) with some fat that can handle heat.  It is really important that the meat is dry to the touch, all fat should be in the pan, not on the meat.  I do not put olive oil or any butter on my steak prior to sear.  The longer you sear, the larger the outside ring will be (the well done part) so I limit this to 90 (max) seconds max on each side.  I then put the steak into the oven directly onto the top rack, with a foil boat below to catch juices.  Some people say you should constantly flip the steak, personally I flip once or twice.  This steak took 20 minutes in the oven at 400F (the temperature and time changes based on the size and type of meat).  I opened the door a few times to check on the meat so that probably dropped the temperature a bit.  I then let the meat rest on a rack.  All of this I think affects how the steak is cooked.  I cook directly on the rack in the oven versus cooking on the cast iron in the oven, so the steak isn't still cooking in the hot cast iron.  You basically want the steak to ""float"" in the oven so that the hot air does most of the work and not the hot metal which conducts heat better.  I also flip once while resting; it may seem silly, and I don't know if this works, but apparently it helps with the distribution of juices within the steak.  Every little bit helps, and what's the harm in flipping once through the rest anyway?  I hope this helps!"
steak,362ckm,petrograd,2,Sat May 16 00:29:05 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you!  What kind of fat do use in the cast iron?"
steak,362ckm,zeebious,1 point,Sat May 16 03:10:14 2015 UTC,"I use either duck or pork fat, I usually just render it off of trimmings when I break down pieces/birds.  You can buy it from whole foods or any thing of the like."
steak,362ckm,zeebious,2,Sat May 16 03:36:41 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely giving that a try.  So if I was to use a gas grill, I can sear it on very high heat and then leave it in there for 20 minutes on low heat?  I can use a thermometer to make sure it stays around 400"

Nearly all retail beef is wet aged, wet is when it's in a cryovac bag like subprimals are shipped. Min 14 days?

steak,35sfzw,Kgquari,2,Wed May 13 05:00:26 2015 UTC,Just read you got it from a butcher
steak,35r171,AsksAboutCheese,7,Tue May 12 20:17:00 2015 UTC,"Try cooking at a higher temp if you can, that grey strip is kind of big IMO"
steak,35r171,amberrgerr,3,Tue May 12 20:38:02 2015 UTC,"That's because this a defrosted steak and I like it more med then med-rare strips. I smoked the house out. This is actually the best crust I have gotten in a few months. The pan was hot enough, I even hold the steak for a min before flipping to let the heat get hotter to sear the other side and still be hot after it drops a few degrees."
steak,35r171,bcrabill,7,Tue May 12 21:05:27 2015 UTC,That does look like a great crust.
steak,35r171,amberrgerr,1 point,Tue May 12 21:52:54 2015 UTC,Gotcha
steak,35r171,WillyF,2,Tue May 12 22:16:33 2015 UTC,"I've found that the best way to avoid the dreaded ""grey strip"" is to flip often. This allows you to cook at a lower temperature and develop amazing crusts. It's more time consuming, but totally worth it."
steak,35r171,amberrgerr,-1,Tue May 12 20:46:16 2015 UTC,Hm interesting. My SO does the highest temp the gas stove will do and then only flips it once. Always has minimal grey area
steak,35r171,WillyF,6,Tue May 12 22:15:57 2015 UTC,"Here's an explanation from /u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt on why flipping is awesome.  I like really thick steaks, medium heat, lots of rendered fat in the pan, and flips every 30-60 seconds. The Alain Ducasse method is quite similar (here are some pictures from a guy who tried it, but I add in near constant flipping. The hidden benefit is that you don't smoke out your kitchen."
steak,35r171,amberrgerr,3,Tue May 12 22:52:49 2015 UTC,That looks friggen delicious

steak,35lh3o,ur_averagejoe4,0,Fri May 29 01:46:39 2015 UTC,18 and classier than me... alright :(
steak,35lh3o,monkeysquirts,-5,Mon May 11 18:22:10 2015 UTC,Oh the cringe. 18 years old and apparently appreciates a scotch and cigar. Never change your ideas of class reddit.
steak,35lh3o,oakattack,9,Tue May 12 09:11:31 2015 UTC,Stop whining you broke ass motherfucker.
steak,35lh3o,moistyorifices,-2,Tue May 12 20:01:57 2015 UTC,"My god Glenlivet is overrated. This post is just pandering to an audience of other 18 to 20 somethings thinking that they could some how appreciate the scotch and cigar.   This doesn't make me a broke ass motherfucker, this just shows how tacky some of the people think that this is the meaning of 'class'."
steak,35lh3o,oakattack,4,Wed May 13 08:52:22 2015 UTC,Just means you're a pompous fucking elitist who doesn't enjoy other people having fun and enjoying what they prefer.

steak,35jhjw,ryryck,2,Sun May 10 23:43:41 2015 UTC,Method?
steak,35jhjw,Broadsword24,3,Mon May 11 12:21:03 2015 UTC,"Pretty simple method. Light EVOO and rub in some salt (coarse, kosher) & pepper (again, coarse grind). Threw them on indirect heat until they hit about 110. Moved them over to the hottest part of the grill to get a crust, roughly 2 minutes a side. Pulled them around 130 after they had some grill marks. Ten minute rest under double wrapped aluminum foil and a couple tea towels over that. Result pictured (amazing!)"
steak,35j9bu,GymIsFun,2,Sun May 10 22:29:08 2015 UTC,So you post a bone?  :/

steak,35j9bu,snowboarding420,2,Sun May 10 22:59:38 2015 UTC,Good looking porterhouses!  How thick were they?   What did you season them with?
steak,35gaa6,rabbifuente,4,Sun May 10 01:50:35 2015 UTC,Dude rockin the beef flavor ramen was pretty much going to Gordan Ramsey's house
steak,35gaa6,pooplouge,3,Sun May 10 04:30:28 2015 UTC,"oh we still have plenty of ramen, but we're lucky enough to have a small, family owned butcher shop nearby that sells really great meat at very affordable prices"
steak,35gaa6,leadfoot323,4,Sun May 10 04:40:27 2015 UTC,"We do steak night at my fraternity every Saturday night so for the last one of the year we decided to go all out and have a big ""meat buffet."" The selection included: choice porterhouse, prime ribeye, prime sirloin, local raised grass fed rib eye, four racks of lamb, and 3.5 pounds of beef short ribs."

steak,35eqsg,ChitownBulls,1 point,Sat May 9 17:10:41 2015 UTC,Holy crap... I thought that was a puddle of juices.
steak,35dyle,dopadelic,4,Sat May 9 12:02:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, not quite a sous-vide in liquid hot magma, but at a nice 125F, then thrown onto a raging hot charcoal grill. I brush the exterior with oil so it catches on fire to give it a quicker crust without overcooking the inside. My favorite rub for this currently is salt, pepper, smoked paprika, and a bit of spicy brown mustard.   The choice cut tri-tip roast from Costco was decently tender and at a value price of $7/lb. It's not melt in your mouth rib-eye texture, but it's amaaazingly flavorful and juicy, and it has a good bite without it being tough. It's being one of my favorite cuts now, I dig the thickness of it, it's a great ratio of crust and pink flesh.      The leftovers are great for sammiches. Most I tried turned out bad though. Grilled cheese melt masked the flavor of the steak. But I came across this steak and onion sandwich recipe from Jamie Oliver and it was absolutely delicious. The sweet onion perfectly complimented the steak and brought out its flavor.  Highly recommended.   http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/beef-recipes/next-level-steak-onion-sandwich/"

steak,35dyle,jack_hazard,2,Sat May 9 20:10:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks. It's all in the lighting. For the steak photos, I bounced the flash off to the ceiling with a white card. That gave some good even lighting.   For the sandwich shot, it was taken by the window."
steak,35dyle,paul_f,3,Sun May 10 03:05:58 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's awesome. The natural light in the sandwich pictures is unbelievable. It doesn't hurt that the food looks delicious either"
