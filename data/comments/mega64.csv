You'll be looking at.. at least 30 hours of content, given that you watch all the episodes with their respective commentary tracks. The behind the scenes documentaries are also really great! These blu rays are also nicely packaged with a slipcover, cover art, and inside art/reversible cover. Disc art. I dare you to try to be disappointed. Especially if you're a fan of the boyz."

It's really funny. They're wrestlers but it's not really about wrestling.  Goosebuds - Paul Ritchey and Dom Moschitti of Continue? Show and Chad Quandt (used to work for Polaris, managed Continue's Youtube channel, now works for Dreamworks) talk about kids books and tear them apart. Really funny stuff.  Paranoia Shoppe - Chad Quandt and his friend Aaron Waltke talk about conspiracy theories, paranormalities, aliens, cryptozoology, etc, and make fun of them/break them down. Good for the skeptic who still enjoys hearing about the paranormal.  The Sylvester Stallone Podcast - A 28 episode mini-series done by Paul Scheer. Episode lengths range from 2 to 10 minutes, though they average about 5-7 minutes. A Q&A podcast with Sylvester Stallone? Probably."

mega64,3dro9y,welp42,11,Sun Jul 19 04:37:45 2015 UTC,"At least Mega64 is good at being the heel, telling everyone including their own fans to shut up. Too bad the ScrewAttack fans screamed stupid bits."
mega64,3dro9y,fasterballspecial,6,Sat Jul 18 23:09:06 2015 UTC,"Why don't they each pick a game and then the third game is out of a hat?  Or maybe it was all faked, I don't know.  It was entertaining, shame about Derrick Killer Acosta missing out on the fun."
mega64,3dro9y,JordanM85,10,Sun Jul 19 03:16:17 2015 UTC,"I love the boyz but they were the only good part of this. SA getting all their game choices bothers me not because they have an advantage, but because their humor doesn't play well (for me) and so it made for a boring time."
mega64,3dro9y,hatrackhotel,7,Sun Jul 19 02:56:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. Rocco and Shawn were consistently funny, and knew how to keep things entertaining. I felt like not only were screwattack not very funny, but that they were just going through the motions to get through it, and not giving something entertaining to watch."
mega64,3dro9y,AskeGuitar,4,Sun Jul 19 07:16:00 2015 UTC,Yeah. The SA guys just seemed douche-y imo. The fans on both sides were just atrocious. The announcer was so into SA it just seemed a bit pathetic too.
mega64,3dro9y,Nyphur,2,Sun Jul 19 19:30:19 2015 UTC,Well but then the boyz could complain about it which makes it better

mega64,3dro9y,RussianPoland4ever,3,Sat Jul 18 22:20:43 2015 UTC,what honestly pissed me off were the group of guys wearing the Mega64 numbered shirts getting up and doing their bits. just leave the comedy to the guys on stage.
mega64,3dro9y,SgtDrP3pp3rs,2,Sun Jul 19 23:51:43 2015 UTC,There are a bunch of random cuts in the video. Is it like that for anyone else?

mega64,3dro9y,LawrenceCat,3,Sun Jul 19 17:44:35 2015 UTC,I think some of you are putting the event under too much of a microscope and losing sight of the fact that it's just a friendly competition between friends. Personally I was able to overlook any minor annoyances that may have surfaced with the crowd and genuinely enjoyed the free hour of content I viewed.
mega64,3dro9y,ControlX,12,Sun Jul 19 22:10:17 2015 UTC,their bit got old but the best part by far was when Rocco used his Joker voice   get a load of this hypocrisy

mega64,3dp1pm,FrustratedSheep,9,Sat Jul 18 03:35:41 2015 UTC,"Mega64 may have lost the comp, but they were definitely way more entertaining and funnier than Screwattack in terms of banter. Just wish they practiced the games, though, since I'd like to see them win again. It was weird and sometimes just seemed egotistical seeing Screwattack congratulate themselves after each win when it was obvious Mega64 didn't even practice or care, but maybe it just came across as egotistical because of the fact that most of the crowd was cheering for them."
mega64,3dp1pm,TheFruityPebble,3,Sat Jul 18 03:48:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm sure it would've been a little better if games were picked that Rocco and Shawn (and fuckin Chris) were more familiar with and suggested as games, as opposed to Screwattacks picks. But hey, they were picked out of a hat, so what can ya do.  I will say tho, the new guy on the Screwattack team was pretty cocky. I mean, really though it's all good. The guys didn't really give a shit (as they tend to do), so it kinda rubbed off on me. I just had fun and enjoyed Mega64's take on if WWE was mixed with EVO in an hour-long gaming competition.

mega64,3dg3r1,Blueberryfists,24,Thu Jul 16 01:07:31 2015 UTC,"I must be retarded. A few months ago, I was unaware of the Still Waiting joke since I was several episodes behind on the podcast.  Then someone on this sub posted this very same link.  Thinking it was legitimate, I watched Still Waiting 2. I suffered though that horrendous piece of shit, hoping that Rocco would show his face as an extra or on one of the monitors used in the film. I thought perhaps that's why people were joking that he hated that film. That moment never came.  Instead, I wasted my time on one of the shittiest movies ever produced. Between the mysoginistic jokes and general tastelessness perpetuated by the sewer-dwelling cretin known as Andy Milonakis, I can genuinely say that the brief ~90 minute runtime of this film felt like an eternity. It wasn't even possible to discern for who the film was even produced. In what categories did the focus tests show positive results? Frat boys? The elderly and senile? Pets whose owners had died? Individuals in full body casts who were unable to change the channel? The only surviving patron of Still Waiting 1?   Thank you, /r/mega64 wikipedia vandal, for ruining a perfectly good evening. I stopped watching my Criterion Collection for that swill, and I hope no one else is idiotic enough to repeat my mistake."

mega64,3d2hjx,eifersucht12a,4,Mon Jul 13 02:14:54 2015 UTC,"Yeeeeaaaah. Not gonna lie, when I saw that, I assumed ""Oh, we're going to hear some real heartfelt stuff about Iwata among the usual silliness, this should be a great podcast"" then nope, they were just plugging a prerecorded thing. The former would've been tasteful, this is kind of... not so much. I mean, it's not awful of them and I'm not outraged, but it's a little awkward.  Edit: Now I know why I ""assumed"" it would be a live cast. They literally said it would be. Guess something must have come up last minute so they threw on the new Faircast instead."

mega64,3cnvvk,Dettelbacher,4,Thu Jul 9 12:13:32 2015 UTC,"So, you give the program a bunch of pictures of a dog. It studies them, knowing that the thing it has in common is the dog. It is now aware of some ""essence"" of dog. If you give it another photo, and ask if it has a dog, it will search and say yes or no. If you tell it that the photo definitely does have a dog, it will try to tell you where. It does this by finding the most doglike element of that image.  If you are being cruel, you can give the program an image that doesn't have a dog in it and then ask it to point out where the dog is. It will struggle and find something that it finds to be the most doglike. If you keep doing this, soon everything looks like a dog.  If you asked it ""is there a dog here?"" it would probably say no. But if you force it to point at a dog then it will make some weird choices."

I'll save you the full teardown, but I can offer some critique in color choice:  I'll tell you from experience, gradients look terrible. I'd pick a solid color for the blog post backgrounds and make sure the text is clearly legible above that.   Same with the Twitter widget. Use the light blue you used in the header instead of that muddy dark blue for the background, then pick a font color that fits (maybe white?).  In general, I'd stick to the four colors in your background and not stray far from that (white, black, pink, blue). If you're going to use blue/pink, make sure it's the same blue/pink throughout your design. It'll make the page look much more cohesive and less messy. If you need variations on the color here and there that's ok, but you might want to consider using the same colors with slightly different opacity rather than different blues/pinks (look into using RGBA in CSS to do this).  Also, I'd avoid putting the scroll bar inside the page like that. Might work great on a desktop, but that would be a nightmare to use on a phone."

mega64,3c6aza,Gunmansam,2,Sun Jul 5 09:10:00 2015 UTC,Has anyone deciphered what Rocco is supposed to be yet?
mega64,3c6aza,bamhurgerdeluxe,4,Sun Jul 5 15:34:59 2015 UTC,"If you look closely, you can see that the craftsmanship of the photographer is in full display. Look at how the american flag is in center focus on the bottom edge of the frame. It captures the eye's focus and then redirects it to Rocco. It is important to note that the colors of the flag are well represented on the stuff that he has slapped onto his body. His red shoes, his blue jacket, his white skin is clearly a display of his patriotism. One can conduce that Rocco is cosplaying as The Real American. Of course, it is also important to note that he is not in fact trying to make a reference to the WWE professional wresting tag team, The Real Americans. So while the absence of pants may indicate that he is prepared to wrestle, it is likely just not there due to the amount of heat that is generated when you pour thousands of bodies into a giant metal bunker on a hot summer day. Now some may ask, well why does he have gray facepaint on and a yellow helmet? To that I would say, consider the context of this photo. Given that this is a Japanese animation convention, it is clear that his facepaint is just a tribute to the webcomic, Homestuck, written, illustrated, and animated by Andrew Hussie. There are likely hundreds or thousands in attendance who have also smeared on gray facepaint in hopes of seeking companionship and/or a potential mate. As for the yellow helmet, it is crystal clear, the guy likes to protect his head. I hope we can now raise this confusion to rest and enjoy the glory that is Kevin ""Thick Dick"" Bushong."

Rocco's said the only reason he did this year's was because he had good footage like Derrick doing gunkata and kicking the camera, so I guess it'll depend on whatever footage they got this year."

mega64,3bwq3e,dalith911,15,Thu Jul 2 20:21:33 2015 UTC,"It's weird seeing them in a game show. I thought it was sort of fun but not the best way to showcase their comedic personalities. Also, you can see Rocco's head explode with information the moment that guy says The Matrix at 14:30."
mega64,3bwq3e,paull_,32,Fri Jul 3 03:12:03 2015 UTC,I thought it was a sketch for about 5 minutes.

mega64,3bwq3e,ReconEG,15,Thu Jul 2 21:02:07 2015 UTC,Something about the look and feel of the video didn't look like a game show but a parody of a game show. Not just how cheesy it was but visually. It's weird.
mega64,3bwq3e,eifersucht12a,26,Thu Jul 2 23:56:19 2015 UTC,"out of all the batman villians, i never would expect clock king to be the one shawn names first"

mega64,3bwq3e,TriggerImage,18,Thu Jul 2 22:21:09 2015 UTC,I know some will deride their involvement in this but it's harmless fun and an easy way to promote a bit. Nothing wrong with that.
mega64,3bwq3e,FruityYummyMummy,6,Thu Jul 2 21:55:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Not something I will probably watch again though. I said in the comments that I would like to see this kind of production level for an improv ""Whose Line is It Anyways"" kind of show instead of bland trivia. That fits Mega64 style better, and I would likely laugh my ass off."
mega64,3bwq3e,firethorn43,8,Fri Jul 3 00:45:47 2015 UTC,"I always thought it would be cool if the guys appeared on Rooster Teeth's ""On The Spot"".

mega64,3bwq3e,sdpcommander,3,Fri Jul 3 01:19:51 2015 UTC,"I agree, I love when the boyz are guests.  Especially when they are on their worst behavior.  But even here it's fun to watch.  It looks like they are going to be in some of the upcoming episodes as well."
mega64,3bwq3e,JordanM85,17,Fri Jul 3 02:03:34 2015 UTC,"I'm glad they're collaborating and stuff but man this show is...weird.  It's so heavily edited that it makes the pace of the show seems way too fast.  And the format doesn't really lend itself to bring out the personalities of the guests (or they just edited it out).  Also $100 prize on a production that looks that expensive seems really odd.  This feels like someone from cable trying to apply a game show model to YouTube but doesn't really understand ""today's kids"" except that they like random YouTube ""celebrities"" and need things cut down to the barest of raw content because they all have ADD."

Warner Bros. is doing it after Man of Steel and (not yet released) Batman vs Superman which will come out the same year.

People romanticize a ""cursed"" role and the idea of the method actor so ""consumed"" by a character it drives them mad. There's a reason people parrot ""Oh, you know that Joker role is what killed Ledger"" when that most probably isn't true at all. He'd moved on and shit most of another film since Dark Knight. But the idea that the role killed him adds a morbid intrigue to the movie. An already dark character suddenly gets a little extra sinister when it must have been dark enough to drive an actor to suicide.  I can guarantee as Suicide Squad promotion reaches home stretch, there will be an uptick in articles about how ""concerned"" people are for Leto's mental health or some shit. People want to believe this role is taking Leto down some dark, bizarre path."

Be sure to use a period not a comma in the weight and remember to expand the First Class option on the last page otherwise you're just getting a bunch of expensive options.

Looks like the main issue was that they let the corrupt Ethiopian government handle the donated funds instead of a charity organization, which led to very little of the money actually reaching starving, impoverished people in need.  Maybe Rocco was referring to the concert instead of the single."

You couldn't turn on the TV without seeing the video, or some behind the scenes show about the song.   It was basically the starting point for every ''(insert) For Africa!'' song or gimmick. Every single song or ringtone or whatever they're selling you to save black babies originated with ''We Are The World''.  There might have been efforts towards that goal before, but none had the impact this song had. It was a global phenomenon.  Anyhow..It went about how all the others have, Haiti and places like that demand that THEY are in charge of which money goes where in their lands...fair enough.  But, like all the others and all others to follow, Almost every cent of it was taken by the people in charge and very little if anything ever went to the common people.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AjkUyX0rVw"

If I had to continue to use my detective's intuition I would guess this video contains Garrett's longest natural dreadlock length and somewhere along the line he decided it would just be easier to add weave extensions and as far as I know there is no video documentation of Mr. Hunter's dreadlocks being any length in-between the time which the aforementioned video took place and the length he had it at the time of the accusation.

mega64,39f8b3,DustbinJ,5,Thu Jun 11 18:41:19 2015 UTC,"Version 3 was teased for years and constantly delayed. I don't blame the Boyz for that-- they were working under the reasonable assumption that things would get completed at a similar pace to Version 2, but the scale of everything got bigger which slowed things down.  I know that Rocco in particular feels strongly about not giving too much away about upcoming projects, because if you say too much and something goes wrong (it's delayed, it falls through completely, etc), all you're doing is setting up disappointment. Saying nothing or very little means people can only be happily surprised.  I would not be shocked to learn that Mega64 has moved past focusing on Version releases, but if Version 4 is being worked on at all, it's being done in secret so that any delays in the process won't frustrate the fans. They have all the time in the world to make it perfect and I prefer it that way."
