glee,3dwuwj,Bradlyballz,3,Mon Jul 20 06:18:55 2015 UTC,Guess I should finish the show. Are the last two seasons really worth watching?
glee,3dwuwj,darthjoey91,2,Mon Jul 20 20:39:49 2015 UTC,Ehhhhhhhhhhhh. I watched them but I can't say I enjoyed them as much as the first few seasons.

glee,3dwuwj,Gpr1me,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:56:14 2015 UTC,Excited about this! I only bought Seasons 1-4 on DVD and I was reluctant to pay DVD prices for the last two seasons because of the show's decline after Cory's death. At least I can stream them now.
glee,3dzb4z,Snickers1224,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:18:34 2015 UTC,Kurt was the token gay character. He was a big hit with a large part of the audience & fan base. So there was no way they were getting rid of him.  Mercedes continues on with that annoying attitude through the seasons.   She refuses to practice singing. She decides its ok to vandalize both Kurt and Sue's vehicles because she gets upset with them. She throws a fit when Will starts making them all learn to dance. After Will stands up for her so that she'll get to share the lead role in a play with Rachael she turns them down. And of course the various plot points about her weight.
glee,3dzb4z,Dark_Shroud,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:46:17 2015 UTC,The Kurt point is spot on unless they did a 360 and devolved Blaine different and didn't have them hook up..I liked Blaine a lot more...and EXACTLY right about Mercades ..ugh lol
glee,3dzb4z,Dark_Shroud,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:21:03 2015 UTC,They pushed the over all gay angle too hard. Blaine was a great gay character because that didn't define who he was while it was a big part of who Kurt's character is.  I also didn't like that Santana's character went from bi to full gay.  Don't even get me started on everything with Quinn's character.  In the end Glee suffered hard from too many different writers all trying to do their own thing instead of keeping with the established story lines.

They really didn't find a lot of good female singers as the show progressed, no offense to the original 12. Naya's Valerie is up there in my most played list.  But look at what guys they found as the seasons progressed: Blaine, Sam, all of the Warbler antagonists. Charice's cameo wasn't very memorable personally, aka, I watched it but don't even remember it.  There is a special mention for Gweneth Paltrow and Kristin Chenowith, they were solid."

glee,3ddm94,SB45,5,Wed Jul 15 13:14:31 2015 UTC,"1) I've never watched Degrassi but Glee is a comedy/drama/musical, so you can expect some drama but it's not overdone   2) hahaha she's in a few episodes (off the top of my head, she's in Audition (s.2), Nationals (s.2), and An Night of Neglect (s.3) maybe more but I can't remember.) Her character is named Sunshine.   3) I am obsessed with Doctor Who and I love Glee, they're not much alike though, Neil Patrick Harris is a guest star on a few episodes, and Glee is really funny.  4) SEASON 4. We don't talk about Season 4.   5) Pay attention to Dave Krofsky. Close attention. Big things happen. The Season 4 episode entitled Sweet Dreams is Cory Monteith's last episode (pay attention to the first thing he says in the first episode of the show (Pilot) and the last thing he says in Sweet Dreams; character development at its very best and most heart-wrenching.) ...watch for this: ""Priority 1: Help The Children"" hint... its on Mr. Schue's bulliton board, in the episodes Pilot and Goodbye.   I'm sorry for the long response. Glee is a really big part of my life lol."

glee,3ddm94,indigo_crayon,2,Thu Jul 16 03:18:19 2015 UTC,"1) I refuse to watch degrassi, but its nothing like say... 90210 or One Tree Hill... most of the time it comes closer to Saved by the Bell.  2) Charice is in ...I think literally 2 episodes. Possibly 3.  3) Out of the shows you listed, it is the most like 70's show or HIMYM (probably the most like MIMYM considering NPH shows up at one point)  4) Quality starts to dip right before Cory Monteath died (Finn), basically when the original cast graduates the show loses its way.  It was JUST getting back on track when Cory OD'd and shot all future plans to hell.  5) Just enjoy,  there are some truly great moments.  Leah (Rachel) has a really great voice (for broadway) but her character is really annoying at times,  Cory (Finn) is actually quite talented too, and singing with Rachel really makes him shine, he does not have a ""popular"" voice though.    Some of the greatest moments are the guest stars like Kristen Chenoweth, Neil Patrick Harris, Brittany Spears and Gwen Paltro."

glee,3ddm94,indigo_crayon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:24:22 2015 UTC,"1) it has a good amount of drama but not extreme amounts  2) she pops up in like 3 episodes. So no, she's not.   3) I personally love The Office and That 70's show and Glee is my favorite show of all time. But it depends obviously.   4) I honestly don't think the quality ever really dipped, but many people say season 4 after they added a shit-ton of people to the cast and didn't take the time to develop them all.   5) not that I can think of, just be ready to laugh and cry."

glee,3d6c0a,clutchyball,3,Wed Jul 15 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"I remember I was spending the night at a friend's house, away from social media and news sources, and she was scrolling through her Facebook feed and I thought I saw someone post a status saying ""the guy from glee is dead??"" First of all, that was incredibly disrespectful, I still fume when I think about it. If you don't even know his name you don't get to talk about it. Period. But back to the point, I was sure I was just seeing things. It seemed too unreal to be true, it was really late and I was extremely exhausted. I didn't think things like that could just happen.   Then the next morning we were sitting around eating breakfast and her brother shows up laughing. ""Oh my god, did you guys hear about the guy from Glee?"" That was when I remembered what I thought I read last night. My heart just about stopped. He continues to laugh and talk about how it was a drug overdose. My sister – who has never seen an episode of Glee and had no idea who Cory was – goes, ""I'm not surprised."" What the fuck drove her to make that comment I will never know. She had no idea who Cory was, what Glee was, or how much of an impact he had on the world. He was trying to turn his life around. It doesn't matter how it happened. It doesn't matter that he was a drug addict. He was someone who influenced the lives of millions of people. He was one of the most inspiring celebrities out there, and he was the face of a television show that taught people of all ages that it's okay to be who you are. He was so fucking valuable. I miss him so much."

glee,3cpgrk,No_Day_But_Today93,6,Thu Jul 9 20:42:16 2015 UTC,"I'm straight and I liked the first 13 episodes, because they were actually good. Character development, a focused story, and a reasonable number of songs per episode (episode 4 only had 1! or 3, depending how you count it.)  After that, Glee had a lot of amazing moments, right until the end. The show is populated with amazingly talented writers, actors, and musicians, resulting in some truly inspired scenes. Problem is, those scenes were standalone, and were preceded and followed by PSA's, throwaway storylines, and forced jukebox musicals. It's awful hard to care about great moments when they only exist in a vacuum, and will be quickly forgotten by the characters and writers alike.  Glee is sort of a shit show with some gems buried all throughout. But for the rest, Glee doesn't just cater to gay people, it panders to them (to the point at which most gay people I know despise it.)   I would liken it to movies and shows so bad that they hone in on a demographic instead of a story. Transformers targets men, but everyone agrees it's shit. Mad Max, alternately, targeted men, and it's beloved because they also focused on quality. Chick Flicks like Dear John are shit, but Bridesmaids is beloved and remembered because they chose a demographic AND made a good movie.  Glee didn't start off as an LGBTQ PSA, it became one as soon as it ran out of actual story to tell... right around the end of season 1."
glee,3cpgrk,NeoshadowXC,2,Fri Jul 10 00:49:23 2015 UTC,Well said.
glee,3cpgrk,Torres097,2,Fri Jul 10 02:23:34 2015 UTC,"So at what point does having gay/bi and trans characters go from being acceptable to pandering?   I know it is often seen as being too gay and whatnot, but I really don't get it. I never felt pandered to because a lot of this stuff hit close to home. I was happy to have a show that didn't shy away from talking about these issues... Though Glee did have problematic trans and gay/bi moments that weren't intentional to be turned into a plot line... But being queer does affect someone's daily life and you shouldn't shy away from talking about it just because it makes you uncomfortable. If it does make you uncomfortable, find out why it does and maybe you will learn something about yourself.   Maybe I'm wrong here, I'm usually in the minority for these things and I'm okay with that. I at no time want this to come across as an attack or anything like that, so I hope it doesn't."
glee,3cpgrk,Sato2013,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:34:42 2015 UTC,"There's no problem with Glee addressing those issues head on, but there was no subtlety to their drama. The problem is that some character gets up on their soapbox every episode and bashes me over the head with the lesson of the week.   And it wasn't just with LGBT issues-- whenever they tried to tackle race, bullying, religion, suicide, or shudder school shootings, they were so excessively on the nose and self-important that it felt like self-parody.   Then there's the issue of balance. Imagine Modern Family, where in season 2 the show-runners decide to devote double the episode time to Mitch and Cam, then cut back on everyone else. Then suddenly the stories about the two of them stop being funny and start getting very serious and indulgent. Imagine the episode of Modern Family where Mitch gets beaten up by a group of homophobes, then spends the rest of the episode dealing with his PTSD, everyone sitting around crying. But that's not the Modern Family we know and were promised in season 1: We want to spend 1/3 of our time with Mitch and Cam. And we want them to stay FUNNY. And we don't want every issue they have to come down to them being gay. There's more to them than that. In another show, a scene like that might be dramatic and great, but if I ever told you that scene played in Modern Family, it would be laughable and/or cringe inducing.  Somewhere out there there's a dramatic, engaging, funny, self-aware musical show about gay teens dealing with the world around them, but Glee ain't it. Glee is a mess that never decided what it wanted to be, bouncing back and forth in tone from season to season, episode to episode, even scene to scene."

glee,3cilxj,bellydancingwalrus,4,Thu Jul 9 00:57:34 2015 UTC,"I loved the season 6 glee club (until the warblers joined no offence) but I don't think I'd like to see a spinoff as the whole story of glee seems done, even though it would be nice to see those newer characters develop further.  I still feel that if the new newbies with kitty were introduced in season 4 (instead of what we got) and the graduated cast's stories were tied up in s3 the show would've gone on a fair bit longer. But even then there's only so many times you can go over the whole 'group of misfit kids come together to win singing competition' storyline."

glee,3cd5th,l_KNOW_ALL,12,Tue Jul 7 00:04:02 2015 UTC,"I agree. I was a close minded individual before Glee. i was a Christian and believed that homosexuality was wrong.  After watching Glee, it changed my outlook. I can safely say Glee changed my life, seriously, and I firmly believed it did a lot in regard to the SCOTUS ruling in favor of gay marriage. This was back in like mid way through season 2. I grew to love the characters and couldn't help but smile whenever I watched it.  In terms of the finale, it was decent. Decent closure for most characters. Kinda bummed there wasn't a send off for Brittana, though they were in the closing number."

glee,3cd5th,mrwhalejr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:14:57 2015 UTC,I watched glee religiously from the second episode all the way to the very end. When you spend 6/7 years of your life watching a tv show like Glee it's impossible for it to not feel like the end of an era when it comes a close. I started watching when I was 12 and ended at 18. I grew up on this show and I wouldn't change that for anything.

glee,3c1xi4,ZoruaUnited,5,Sat Jul 4 00:26:14 2015 UTC,"Can we actually predict the future?  Finn dies off the show in a way that was actually planned, giving then time to make season 5 coherent. Keep the old newbies and merge in the new newbies. Rachel doesn't quit Broadway. Slowly shift emphasis away from the NY cast. If need be send Sam and Jake and Unique to LA or something after eventual graduations for a second round of continuity. End the show when Kurt's dad becomes President."

glee,3bstg1,Snickers24,16,Wed Jul 1 21:26:41 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue was not gradually adding new characters as the show progressed. Come season 4 we added like 4-6 new people at once, when they could have joined slowly through seasons 2 and 3 degrassi style."
glee,3bstg1,No_Day_But_Today93,15,Thu Jul 2 01:36:15 2015 UTC,"THISSSSSSS. If I was RMurph, I would have 12 kids each year in Glee Club: 3 freshman, 3 sophomore, 3 junior, 3 senior. Graduate the three seniors at the end of the season, get three freshman at the beginning of the next.  Or maybe not quite this ridged with the years, but I'd rotate 3 kids per season. The show would have survived the Cory tragedy had he properly rotated the cast so we didn't have so much abrupt change at once. Fwiw Season 6 new directions newbies were so much better than the season 4 newbies and I'm really sad I didn't get more time with Myron, the incest twins, warbler girl, fat Sam Smith, and the two casual gays."
glee,3bstg1,9knives,11,Thu Jul 2 05:33:25 2015 UTC,"Have an upvote!  The other problem is that the Season 4 new kids weren't actually new kids but retreads of the existing kids  Jake = Puck  They weren't just brothers, they were both ""players""  who fell for the inappropriate-for-them girl  (Marley/Lauren - who both refused to put out like all the other girls)  Marley = Rachel  They both had body issues & had unusual family situations - although it's really interesting that Marley was picked on because of her mom but Rachel's gay dads were never mentioned by anyone but Rachel.  Ryder = Finn  They were both big goofy ""good guys"" who were ""victims"" of an inappropriate crush (Unique/Kurt) and they had similar reactions to who was crushing on them  Kitty = Santana  Saucy ""bad girl with a bad ass attitude""    Unique = Mercedes/Kurt  Unique got to do the ""Mercedes end of song vocal runs"" while taking over Kurt's whipping boy spot (like a 2 for 1 sale).   Even the new Warbler guy was a retread of Meerkat boy."
glee,3bstg1,jaimystery,3,Thu Jul 2 11:31:24 2015 UTC,"You are correct. The kids were just retreads that did not work. I love season 6 because the new students were fresh and different, not just remakes of the first generation. I really wanted more when it ended, and seasons 4 and 5, I don't even own them."
glee,3bstg1,kissofarose,2,Thu Jul 2 12:42:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its like all the old class had two or three defining traits, so they cut these rates up, threw them in a mixer and pulled them out 2-3 at a time to make the new people."
glee,3bstg1,RamenJunkie,-2,Thu Jul 2 15:43:28 2015 UTC,"This so much.  Season one worked incredibly well because it had like 5-6 main characters, 10 or so supporting cast members, and a bunch of nobodies who were essentially extras.    Then they started promoting supporting cast to main characters and extras to supporting cast.  Except they never removed any of the old main characters.  They even had a built in mechanism to evolve the cast via graduation.  Unfortunately, they didn't have the balls to dump the originals after graduations and by season 4 we had this huge ball of crap with 20-30 main characters.  No character got enough screen time to be worthwhile and most of the plot threads didn't have time to actually go anywhere.  They needed to leave McKinley behind completely or remove the graduating class, they tried to do both and it was a total mess.  Losing Finn definitely didn't help since its clear they had plot ideas for him and they tried to shoehorn Sam into some of those plot points but it just wasn't the same.  Also he had like 3 or 4 tribute episodes.  This was kind of overkill.  Especially since he kind of did it himself.  Its not like say, Paul Walker who seemed like a genuinely nice guy who got killed in a freak accident, Corey died of a drug overdose.  Sorry or whatever but this is why ""drugs are bad mmmkay"".  Its really hard to feel bad for him and having to be constantly reminded that Finn was gone was more a reminder that nice guy Finn was actually druggie Corey."
glee,3bstg1,RamenJunkie,4,Thu Jul 2 15:42:21 2015 UTC,"Cory's death was a mistake. He was trying to better himself; he was in rehab and everything. Not only that, but he was a genuinely good guy. He always seemed happy and I never heard a bad word about him. Just because he got caught up into drugs doesn't mean he was a bad person. Your comment is really disrespectful."
glee,3bstg1,MarriedToReddit,-1,Thu Jul 2 16:15:40 2015 UTC,"Mistake or not, either way he put himself into a position to relapse. Once out of rehab, you are supposed to change your environment so that reduces your chances of relapse. It seems as though Cory did not do that. /u/RamenJunkie isn't not being disrespectful, he is telling the truth.  The death of Cory was a turning point in the Glee series. He really marked the end, due to the changes that had to be made."
glee,3bstg1,techiejames,5,Thu Jul 2 21:32:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not claiming to know everything about his rehabilitation. Obviously he made mistakes, but did it make him an awful person? Either way, /u/RamenJunkie was implying that he was an awful person, and that it ruined his character, which to me is a little disrespectful.  And I agree that his death basically ended the series. Finn and Rachel were arguably the main characters, and without him, the show had to take a whole different direction. It's a shame."
glee,3bstg1,MarriedToReddit,0,Thu Jul 2 23:07:37 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily an awful person, just, its hard to feel too bad given the circumstances."
glee,3bstg1,RamenJunkie,2,Fri Jul 3 00:12:57 2015 UTC,Correct. That is what I was trying to go for.
glee,3bstg1,techiejames,-6,Fri Jul 3 00:29:03 2015 UTC,"What can I say, I have little sympathy or respect for anyone engaging in self destructive behavior."
glee,3bstg1,RamenJunkie,11,Thu Jul 2 17:09:27 2015 UTC,"Someone correct me if I'm wrong. But I'm pretty sure Glee ended as a result of Cory's death. Seasons 5 and 6 were already renewed and guaranteed during season 4, and before Cory passed. The plan at that time was for Finn to come back as the next Will and for the show to be split between him leading the new New Directions and the older ones in the city. But then after Cory's death the whole plan obviously had to change. It wouldn't have worked to shove someone else into the role that was meant for Finn so they just didn't. There wasn't a great reception to the newbies so they just cut them out completely. And eventually they decided to just not have Glee club anymore at all, which struck a nerve with me personally. I think in general it was just too hard of a thing to keep that storyline going after everything with Cory, so they moved to just following the kids in the city. But then that didn't work, and they went back to their roots.   Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that Cory's death changed everything. Glee might have gone on for many more seasons if the original plan had panned out. But it didn't."
glee,3bstg1,numberthangold,4,Thu Jul 2 04:10:17 2015 UTC,We may never know the answer but it was in a downward spiral ratings and review wise before Cory's death.
glee,3bstg1,20MPH,9,Thu Jul 2 13:35:00 2015 UTC,"The series suffered the typical show runner third season syndrome where Ryan Murphy got too busy to focus completely on glee - what with American horror story / the HBO series or movie that he developed and the other show on cbs I believe - the new normal and the glee reality show that ran on oxygen for 2 seasons. He spread himself too thin and the writing suffered on season 4. Some things got too lazy and some other things the audience didn't accept - like Rachel's sudden makeover from theater dork wearing carousel horse sweaters to a nyc fashionista in a matter of story time months.   Some of the story lines were cringeworthy at best - yeah I'm talking about you Brodie and your man whorish ways and also about Kate hudson's character pulling a complete 180 saying that she ""pushed Rachel hard because she believed in her"" at the end of the season when clearly they made her character a crazy stalker teacher who clearly knew that Rachel had a thing for the then unknown ""gigalo""  and totally inappropriately bangs him - then brags about her conquest to Rachel over the phone while she was magically teleported to Ohio for the glee clubs performance of Grease.  Ryder getting catfished for 4 episodes by unique?? Best you can come up with? Not to mention how there were a ton of missed storytelling opportunities and other elements which kinda worked but always found a way to juuuuust miss the mark. However the episode shooting star was great and so was unfortunately - the quarterback - both really well acted and well written.   And how are we supposed to buy that the badass puckerman goes from well.. Badass to I'm so in love with you Marley in like the span of 2 episodes and also how about the fact that the series regulars (Artie, Tina, Sam, Britney and even Finn) were relegated to what was basically recurring characters while the ""NYC"" characters and the new kids took center stage. And that's just season  4 I won't get into 5...  When the show got picked up for the season 5 and 6 it was apparent that the writing was on the wall for the series. There was a reason that they did the order for 2 seasons and that was so they could wrap the story up in a bow out of respect for the what the show was.   When Cory died it was like a ship that was already kinda sinking hitting an iceberg for good measure. Already going downhill but accelerating it quite at bit until the end.  Season 6 showed some renewed promise but only because the writers had to get creative due to scheduling and I'm sure budgetary constraints required it.   All in all I loved the show but realistically - it should have ended after graduation and maybe picked up with a mini series or a spin off or a movie follow up. It would have be better for the franchise."
glee,3bstg1,Cferra,8,Thu Jul 2 04:57:03 2015 UTC,"I say the writing killed it. Season 3: Here we are, driving to get married ... psych! We're at the bus station - I know what's best for you, now go away and live your life!   Give me a break. It was all downhill from there. I have limits to how much disbelief I can suspend - those limits were far exceeded by Season 4+ plotlines. But thanks ya'll for S01-S03."
glee,3bstg1,towmeaway,3,Thu Jul 2 05:02:06 2015 UTC,"Season 4 was a train-wreck writing-wise long before the stuff with Cory. The creators mainly handed it off and there were too many cooks and NO continuity. They tried to do too many things and kept writing things in and then dropping them.   Kurt works at Vogue. Then that's never mentioned for 6 months. Then he works there again, insert joke about 'where have you been?' He gets a new bf. Then said bf disappears with no explanation. Burt gets cancer. It's never mentioned again until 6 months later when he's cured. Sue has a baby. Said baby is never seen or discussed again. Marley has anorexia. It's ruining her life. Then it's never mentioned again. And on and on.  Season 5 was obviously thrown out of whack by Cory's death. The episodes once they ditched the newbies and switched to NY were pretty good. Season 6 was so ridiculous that it was actually  good again if you didn't take it seriously."
glee,3bstg1,sportsguysd7,7,Fri Jul 3 07:01:23 2015 UTC,"I think 121 episodes of any show in this diverse TV market is a huge deal and the show had just run its course.  It is rare most shows get that many episodes to begin with.  Personally loved season 4, I was happy to follow a few folks in NYC and support the new crew.    For me Glee was always about the music and as long as each episode had a few great songs / dance numbers I was happy.  Concerning season 4, I loved the way they brought in Kate Hudson, she brought a great energy and really pushed Rachael to be better.  It was the the plot point of having Rachael leave ""Funny Girl"" for a stupid reality show which was a bridge too far for me personally.    Now concerning the fans, I did read lots of critiques about the plot lines and complaints about Ryan Murphy ditching the show but if you like Ryan Murphy shows, Nip/Tuck being my 2nd favorite, then expect a roller coaster ride because everything he does is over the top.  The other part I really didn't like was bringing in new cast members for season 6.  I liked them all but we really barely got a chance to know them and I felt the chemistry to gel the team was pushed much to hard and to fast.    But in the big picture, I feel the last 3-4 episodes of Glee was almost perfection.  I have cried each time I watch the final two.  I can't image a better way to end the show.  I just wish my two girls would older, currently 7&9, so I could re-watch with them.  But I promise the shows will be on regular rotation around the time my oldest completes 8th grade."

From that point it became a bit fan-service-ish, but really the thing that suffered most was season 5 - season 6 worked better when they had more time to plan wtf they were doing with the season. Though obviously I agree it would have been nice to keep more of the newbies aside from kitty."

Story lines were getting tossed left and right and there was no juice to them at all as they were always cut short (ex: quintanna, season 4 kids' personal problems, etc). At that point the show didnt seem serious at all like it was in season 1; people would be appearing illogically in episodes and we would have no explanation for it (ex:the alluminis being ALWAYS at WMHS.), doing songs out of nowhere and no reason in contrary of having a specific purpouse for the song choice and situation/momment. In other words, the directors did not at all target the same feels and vibe as season 1 , 2 and 3. They went for a more upbeat and too joyous and musical glee instead of a drama, funny and realistic glee."

glee,3b3mqu,The_Puzzle_Maker,3,Thu Jun 25 19:29:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I'm curious to see who the winner will be, because I had banked on it being Don't Stop!"
glee,3b3mqu,turkeysrule,9,Thu Jun 25 20:41:41 2015 UTC,This is not at all what I thought would be the last match.  Wow.
glee,3b3mqu,mellowwords,4,Thu Jun 25 19:23:40 2015 UTC,I'll be sad. :(
glee,3b3mqu,The_Puzzle_Maker,3,Thu Jun 25 22:11:08 2015 UTC,"I thought it would be interesting for a vote on every character's best/favourite song. A lot of work, though!"
glee,3b3mqu,finding_jay,3,Thu Jun 25 22:50:15 2015 UTC,"I was actually thinking of maybe doing something like that if people were up to it, albeit in a smaller scale than the series tournament we've been through now. Maybe, like I said, if people were positive to the idea, and if they wanted me to do it or someone else was interested"
glee,3b3mqu,The_Puzzle_Maker,2,Fri Jun 26 10:50:50 2015 UTC,"I would definitely be down! Some characters might have somewhat predictable results (but maybe not, this tournament had some surprises) but it'd still be fun!"
glee,3b3mqu,shainab,7,Fri Jun 26 13:07:57 2015 UTC,I'm so bummed that Homeward Bound/Home won over Don't Stop Believin'. Such a disappointment.   It would have been neat to see the first and last songs of the show competing in the finale.
glee,3b3mqu,Chocobolove,4,Fri Jun 26 14:17:40 2015 UTC,I Lived has Matt. It has to win.
glee,3b3mqu,Ryuushin,3,Fri Jun 26 05:43:09 2015 UTC,I remember seeing on youtube all these flash mobs dancing to Glee's versions of Don't Stop Believing.  I get goosebumps every time I decide to look these videos up and it is definitely surprising it's not in the final match.
glee,3aykj4,TVjoker,5,Wed Jun 24 15:18:52 2015 UTC,Do we get vote counts for yesterdays?  Curious to see how bad my favorite lost.
glee,3aykj4,Ilaena,2,Wed Jun 24 16:22:52 2015 UTC,"Oh man the votes were there but I guess I screwed up the formatting or something. I won't be home in 3-4 hours, but I'll fix it then. In the meantime I'll leave an edit on the post"
glee,3aykj4,Ilaena,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:57:55 2015 UTC,The vote count is fixed
glee,3aykj4,finding_jay,2,Wed Jun 24 22:35:21 2015 UTC,"wow,  similar splits among them all."
glee,3aykj4,autumnfever,2,Wed Jun 24 23:02:09 2015 UTC,"That's what I found most interesting- there's such an even split between all the songs, it's kind of weird."
glee,3aykj4,The_Puzzle_Maker,3,Thu Jun 25 01:48:44 2015 UTC,Some tough cuts there. Sorry to see Rumour/Someone go.
glee,3aykj4,liliums,3,Wed Jun 24 15:50:47 2015 UTC,Match 1 is so hard. One of the better group numbers (and the last) against what's probably my favorite Rachel solo. I'm going to face to think about this for awhile.
glee,3aykj4,The_Puzzle_Maker,4,Wed Jun 24 18:19:37 2015 UTC,"I've seen each video 3 times already, still can't make up my mind..."
glee,3aykj4,_reccomended_dose,2,Wed Jun 24 21:00:02 2015 UTC,I voted but it wasn't easy. :(
glee,3aykj4,Harmonie,2,Wed Jun 24 21:23:55 2015 UTC,Well... I guess 1 out of 3 isn't bad.
glee,3au3ml,TVjoker,6,Tue Jun 23 14:56:24 2015 UTC,Match two is so difficult.  I love both of those songs
glee,3au3ml,broadhouse1,2,Tue Jun 23 15:31:01 2015 UTC,Agreed!
glee,3au3ml,Harmonie,6,Tue Jun 23 16:13:40 2015 UTC,Match 4 was my toughest choice.
glee,3au3ml,No_Day_But_Today93,3,Tue Jun 23 18:35:32 2015 UTC,Match 4 is pretty much Sophie's Choice for me.
glee,3au3ml,mellowwords,6,Tue Jun 23 19:29:55 2015 UTC,I think it's cool how each song encapsulates the season it was from :D Yey glee
glee,3au3ml,jamidarcy,3,Wed Jun 24 11:03:29 2015 UTC,Heads-up: the link to Season 6: 'I Lived' goes to a video of the New York Mets.
glee,3au3ml,keenman,3,Tue Jun 23 18:15:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you, it's fixed now. Seems I missed a digit when I copypasted."
glee,3au3ml,Ayazinha,3,Tue Jun 23 20:58:37 2015 UTC,I think every single song I voted for is going to lose and I'm not even mad...
glee,3apqqm,TVjoker,9,Mon Jun 22 14:37:55 2015 UTC,"I must be the only one who isn't a huge fan of Rumor Has It/Someone Like You. I like it okay, but not a whole lot. Still, I have enjoyed this whole process immensely."
glee,3apqqm,The_Puzzle_Maker,7,Mon Jun 22 16:52:11 2015 UTC,"I feel the same about I Feel Pretty/Unpretty. It's not in the same caliber as the previous winners.  Will it win?  Probably not.  Just sorta shocked it advanced, that's all."
glee,3apqqm,hoolytoledo,6,Mon Jun 22 19:53:59 2015 UTC,The Scientist is far better than I Feel Pretty/Unpretty.
glee,3apqqm,No_Day_But_Today93,2,Tue Jun 23 07:39:17 2015 UTC,I'm totally on the same page as you.
glee,3apqqm,No_Day_But_Today93,4,Tue Jun 23 04:20:30 2015 UTC,You're not the only one. I voted for two that didn't make it - actually number 3 and 4 - but these were all unexpected bonus picks anyway. :)
glee,3apqqm,keenman,3,Mon Jun 22 19:23:47 2015 UTC,I'm on the exact same boat as you man. I really found Rumor Has It/Someone Like You to be kinda annoying after a while. I think it was an okay performance at best and the song gets too repetitive for me. I really wanted either The Scientist/Faithfully to get in.
glee,3apqqm,quackyninja,2,Tue Jun 23 11:59:58 2015 UTC,"Those were the two I was hoping for. Especially Faithfully, that's probably in my top 3. But that's why it's a vote. :)"
glee,3alyer,TVjoker,3,Sun Jun 21 15:00:53 2015 UTC,"Agggggh. I had to vote for 3, I couldn't get it any lower than that. Here's hoping my very favorite of the 3 makes it in. :D"
glee,3alyer,Ilaena,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:15:29 2015 UTC,I had to vote for 4 of them...
glee,3ainrx,TVjoker,3,Sat Jun 20 15:42:45 2015 UTC,"It's so hard to pick. I feel like Take Me to Church is probably the better performance, but I Lived is obviously more emotional."
glee,3ainrx,The_Puzzle_Maker,3,Sat Jun 20 17:44:59 2015 UTC,Take Me to Church killed my favorite song so I will vote for it so that I can say my favorite lost to #1.
glee,3aer7m,TVjoker,5,Fri Jun 19 15:08:09 2015 UTC,Picking between Home and Take Me to Church was the hardest decision. I love both of those.
glee,3aer7m,The_Puzzle_Maker,3,Fri Jun 19 16:19:53 2015 UTC,"Dammit, Cool Kids lost, thats so annoying. I didn't think chandelier was that great, oh well. I Lived, take it home"
glee,3ab6my,ZoruaUnited,2,Thu Jun 18 18:02:09 2015 UTC,Thank you!
glee,3ab6my,No_Day_But_Today93,2,Thu Jun 18 19:21:43 2015 UTC,"Omg I did the same exact thing with the exact seasons    I was holding off on buying them for so long and I saw the Half Off code and completed this set, along with 5 seasons of Modern Family and some other stuff for LESS than $100"
glee,3ab6my,m182ms,2,Fri Jun 19 18:07:47 2015 UTC,Just wanted to come back and say thank you for this. I ordered mine as soon as I saw this post and received it yesterday. I spent all last evening watching the first two discs and will finish tonight. I loved season 6 and can't wait to relive it again and again.
glee,3ab6my,kissofarose,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:15:07 2015 UTC,"No problem!  My package camel on June 26th, my birthday! But, I wasn't at home. When I got home on the 28th, I was so happy with it! I'm halfway through Season 5, and it's a bit hard to get through because it's my least favorite season, but I'm looking forward to the better episodes!   Season 6 was amazing, and I can't wait to watch it again!"
glee,3aado7,TVjoker,3,Thu Jun 18 14:22:59 2015 UTC,"I'm pulling for Cool Kids. It should definitely at least win this round, Chandelier was good but it wasn't the greatest cover. I feel like I Lived will win the whole thing though, which I won't be too mad about to be honest."
glee,3aado7,majormay,3,Thu Jun 18 15:25:06 2015 UTC,"""This Time"" just punches me right in the feels every time. I love it so much <3"
glee,3a680f,TVjoker,4,Wed Jun 17 15:30:29 2015 UTC,"I Know Where I've Been was so much more powerful than Take Me To Church. I'm devastated, but I saw it coming."
glee,3a680f,No_Day_But_Today93,4,Wed Jun 17 17:07:42 2015 UTC,These are getting hard now.
glee,3a680f,jmanisweird,2,Wed Jun 17 17:20:25 2015 UTC,I want to break free survived! … ..only to get put up against another song that makes me vote against it….
glee,3a680f,Ilaena,2,Wed Jun 17 19:11:37 2015 UTC,"pretty sure that This Time is gonna win season 6.. i mean how can you not love the song by darren, basically about all of glee sung by lea.. its just so perfect."
glee,3a1q9q,TVjoker,3,Tue Jun 16 15:28:51 2015 UTC,"Take Me to Church - I Know Where I've Been  This one. I got so many chills from both of them, just different types of chills.  Dammit."
glee,3a1q9q,TPNigl,2,Tue Jun 16 21:22:49 2015 UTC,Exactly... I think Take Me to Church will win but I hope I'm wrong. I Know Where I've Been is historic performance and is amazing! 2-300 Trans person choir just gives me life!
glee,3a1q9q,No_Day_But_Today93,2,Wed Jun 17 06:44:30 2015 UTC,"Take Me to Church is my pick. I like the other performance, but damn I love Noah Guthrie and his voice, and this was easily one of the highlights for his character."
glee,3a1q9q,The_Puzzle_Maker,3,Wed Jun 17 06:51:52 2015 UTC,This is the first round of results that I 100% agree with.
glee,3a1q9q,SpencerAnne,2,Tue Jun 16 22:59:09 2015 UTC,Goodbye I want to break free….. One of 3 songs that could make me vote against it….
glee,3a27t1,Belskirnir_,4,Tue Jun 16 17:31:57 2015 UTC,"Britanna. As a young lesbian, their relationship being on TV was a big deal and they're so effing adorable."
glee,3a27t1,Benay21,2,Wed Jun 17 05:52:44 2015 UTC,yeah i know what you mean and hmm i was not happy with it to begin with because of Santana but i grew into it ahah
glee,3a27t1,rahlala,3,Wed Jun 17 11:48:11 2015 UTC,"also liked her with the beard thing, showed modern society andt he lengths people go to to avoid embaressment or haressment or something"
glee,3a27t1,rahlala,3,Wed Jun 17 11:48:39 2015 UTC,"Kristin Chenoweth got me into watching it! I was obsessed with her at the time, (well, I still am), and saw she was in this new tv show that was all about singing. Which I am SO into. Watched it, got hooked, love Kurt forever."
glee,3a27t1,rahlala,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:43:08 2015 UTC,"she is a beautiful woman! i remember seeing her and like going crazy! and yeah kurt feels like a relatable  character for a lot of people in a way , like he is gay so thats a number of people. he is an underdog, the whole bullying, coming to terms with who you are, failing at college, long distance relationship, heartbreak, most characters are realatable and get people emotionally gripped but i feel the most with Klaine"
glee,3a27t1,massholeteacher86,3,Wed Jun 17 00:46:08 2015 UTC,I relate to Rachel a ton more than I relate to Kurt - it's more that I just love his character and think that Chris Colfer is a wonderful actor and human being! I am still a huge klainer though. Such beautiful boys.

glee,3a27t1,socalcountrygirl,3,Wed Jun 17 00:50:43 2015 UTC,"Gosh, a number of things really. I used to have her desperation for love when I was her age. You remember the scene where Finn kissed her once and said he felt nothing? That happened to me when I was younger and I felt SO horrible for her during that scene! And just like, the way she wants everyone to like her but keeps just messing it up? Or being selfish? Young me, right there! I draw rather than sing, but I totally used to think I was better than everyone else but wanted to be congratulated all the time for it. Basically she's a terrible person, but I love her and always believed she'd grow eventually."

glee,3a27t1,turkeysrule,3,Wed Jun 17 01:26:45 2015 UTC,"As a former show choir/theater geek the entire show was like watching my high school life.   Surprisingly, I relate the most to Tina. From the beginning she was the underdog in the underdog club for no good reason. She was quirky, even going to great measures to try and stand out from the crowd but never succeeded. She has a fantastic voice that was overshadowed by a diva who got all the leads. She was passionate about everything she did, but it never quite worked out for her in the musical fields."
glee,3a27t1,Ryuushin,3,Wed Jun 17 01:15:32 2015 UTC,"I started watching from the very beginning because it debuted while I was still in my high school show choir, and I'd heard rumors that our show choir was going to be on the show (which it was in season 3, I believe.) Obviously it was nothing like an actual show choir, but I fell in love with Rachel, mostly because of how talented and dedicated she was to her craft and to her dream. I've been rewatching the series and it's so cool to see how she grows throughout the show, from a vain, self-obsessed complete diva to someone who's still all of those things but also more loving and compassionate to her friends."
glee,3a27t1,youngincollege,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:07:51 2015 UTC,"Ahh i see! Were they in the show? and yeah i know its completely like drama- cised ( made up word there aha) but like i guess it gives kids who were in show choirs scenarios that could be relatable or that they hoped for one day (i dunno, in england i always thought some of the drama in american films and television must be real or inspired by real life because of how crazy yall americans are ;) ) and im rewatching it currently after seeing season  6 of the show and im on season 2 finale right now and god i hate rach! i like the new one so much better!"
glee,3a27t1,JustRuss79,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:52:32 2015 UTC,"Yes! They made a brief cameo in the disco episode (I'm pretty sure it was season 3, but it could've been 2.) I liked the drama aspect of it and all the individual storylines but the thing that bugged me was the actual show choir aspect of it. Actual show choir is nothing like Glee, most show choir schools have multiple show choirs and the advanced mixed show choir of a particular school usually has 40 to 50 members. There aren't really ""leads,"" although there are soloists, and students certainly don't get a say in what their set list is going to be. The set list doesn't change from competition to competition, it stays constant and the choir works on it throughout the whole year."

glee,39x1fd,scottg11,2,Tue Jun 16 07:23:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it was the best because it's the last song. I said that it was better than Hand in My Pocket/I Feel the Earth Move and I know, unless a Britanna brigade comes in, it will win because it is a better performance in general."
glee,39x1fd,11709,5,Mon Jun 15 23:41:25 2015 UTC,If I've learnt anything from these last two seasons it is that my opinion on what comprises a good performance differs greatly from that of the majority view.
glee,39syoj,TVjoker,7,Sun Jun 14 13:46:36 2015 UTC,I just want Roderick (does anyone know what the actor is called?) to sing me to sleep every night. His voice is so dreamy.

glee,39syoj,Ilaena,2,Sun Jun 14 14:32:53 2015 UTC,"BIY was the only song of the season where I couldn't find the performance anywhere, so the studio-version will have to suffice.   Found it!"
glee,39syoj,Chocobolove,2,Sun Jun 14 15:26:02 2015 UTC,"Aside from not having Kitty, Home is easily my favourite song of the season."
glee,39syoj,sandoooo,2,Mon Jun 15 13:52:11 2015 UTC,I honestly can't stand Kitty's voice. It's so whiney and nasally.
glee,39syoj,No_Day_But_Today93,2,Mon Jun 15 18:13:37 2015 UTC,I can see what you mean. Back in season 4 I really didn't like it at first. At this point it may just be that I liked her so much more than the others in ND as characters.

glee,39pgkn,Rhyrem,5,Sat Jun 13 21:17:13 2015 UTC,Is that really so surprising? It was kind of important for Artie's character... and a pretty great performance in itself.
glee,39pgkn,Chocobolove,6,Sat Jun 13 21:48:29 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not saying that Pony isn't important for Artie, or that it wasn't good... But yes, it surprised me. Uptown Funk was great too and I thought that it'll win, that's all."
glee,39dqht,TVjoker,8,Thu Jun 11 01:56:33 2015 UTC,"It's so tough because against ANY other song this season, I would have chosen What I'm Looking For. It's a great performance and tribute and one of my favorite songs ever. But I can't NOT choose Make You Feel My Love. It just means too much. It's completely unique from any other performance Glee's ever done, and honestly one of the most genuine, heartbreaking ""performances"" in television history. It's a rare, raw display of love, loss, longing, regret, and just very much one of the most touching things I've ever seen. It will always have my vote."
glee,39dqht,glossandfloss,0,Thu Jun 11 20:30:02 2015 UTC,I have the opposite problem - it's tough because I don't really like either and would have chosen maybe a dozen other songs instead :(
glee,39dqht,_reccomended_dose,3,Thu Jun 11 21:10:10 2015 UTC,"I really wanted If I Were a Boy. Best song of the season for me, or If I Die Young."

He probably was doing a plank or table as we called it in high school.   Heathers a good sport and I'm sure everyone involved knows heather is super funny and also super hot.

glee,38jzqn,_reccomended_dose,2,Thu Jun 4 23:27:33 2015 UTC,It was a mash up.
glee,38jzqn,No_Day_But_Today93,2,Fri Jun 5 01:36:25 2015 UTC,I watched again and as far as I can tell they swapped from one song to the other directly with no real combination. Though maybe I'm just not getting it?
glee,38jzqn,_reccomended_dose,2,Fri Jun 5 05:53:18 2015 UTC,It's listed as one song.
glee,38jzqn,No_Day_But_Today93,2,Fri Jun 5 06:49:37 2015 UTC,"Like No_Day said, it's released as and listed on the wiki as a mash-up. There's really no mix of the songs though, except that the first goes directly to the second without a break."

glee,38jzqn,0ldgrumpy1,2,Fri Jun 5 06:15:35 2015 UTC,Why would that be the final match? The first loser like me didn't win its season?

glee,3831du,xDolceFalls,13,Mon Jun 1 14:21:21 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Mercedes, I wish they had never added her to the song and kept it more with Rachel/Kurt. I always will have a sweet spot for Kurt during Defying Gravity, so my vote goes with him. Rachel is excellent as well though, all of them did great.   So long story short, I think Kurt should have. He redeemed himself from that first time and I think he should be the winner despite the whole ""Showdown"" between Mercedes and Rachel."
glee,3831du,breezombiee,8,Mon Jun 1 18:28:55 2015 UTC,"Rachel's.  Mercedes' version doesn't fit the style.  Kurt's version lack of intensity doesn't make the song any justice.  Lea is not my favorite singer,but she nailed this song the two times she recorded it."

glee,3831du,unchartedcubes,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:32:23 2015 UTC,Kurt. This version is better than the Season 1 version. His voice is 'fuller' for lack of a better word. Lea's is about the same in both. Mercedes doesn't fit this song.
glee,3831du,sportsguysd7,0,Wed Jun 3 06:03:52 2015 UTC,"Kurt threw the competition, but Rachel was honestly better ... she almost has to be considering who her mother is (Lea, not Rachel... or actually Rachel too...)  Just like her doing 'Let it Go', this is really handicapped in her favor. Kurt has an amazing voice for a guy, if he were a girl he wouldn't be worth commenting about (school musicals, not broadway).  He just cannot project the kind of emotion through music that Rachel can.  Edit:  PLEASE read the whole thread to see where I admit I was an idiot."
glee,3831du,JustRuss79,2,Tue Jun 2 04:37:10 2015 UTC,"she almost has to be considering who her mother is (Lea, not Rachel... or actually Rachel too...)   Huh? Lea's mother?"
glee,3831du,JustRuss79,0,Tue Jun 2 08:20:54 2015 UTC,"EDIT:  READ THE WHOLE THREAD I ADMIT I WAS WRONG BUT DON""T WANT TO Wuss Out and Delete my entry.   original:  Lea Michelle is the daughter of Idina Menzel both in real life, and as Rachel on the show.  Idina Menzel starred in the broadway musical 'Wicked' as Elphaba, and sang 'Defying Gravity'.  She is also the voice of Elsa and sang 'Let it Go'.  Lea looks and sounds 95% like her mother, so much that its scary. So singing any song that her mother made famous is hugely tilted in favor of her version being much better than anyone else simply by being closest to the original."
glee,3831du,JustRuss79,4,Tue Jun 2 23:36:57 2015 UTC,"Lea Michele is NOT the daughter of Idina Menzel, they just look a lot alike. Her parents are Edith and Mark Sarfati."

I dont know why Will ever thought bringing her to school was a good idea, after he met her in a foreclosed house drinking wine. Love Kristin Chenoweth though. So talented. And Finn was kind of a selfish jerk in this episode. Using Rachels feelings like that. So rude."
glee,37czwp,lifeisspiffy,8,Sat May 30 00:29:56 2015 UTC,"This is another episode that explores one of the themes of the show - of being what's considered a loser or a failure by todays society - of not achieving your dreams and the fall out from even trying. There is wonderful pathos in Aprils situation that is genuinely moving.  Later on the show becomes obsessed with winning (winning nationals, everyone from a small town high school having ridiculous success) and loses some of that humble, humanness to me.   Some of the stuff they get away with amazes me - Sandy Ryerson walking out with Jacob ""Have you ever hung out at a stable?"". Emma talking about online flirting with ""Andy"" a spree killer who killed Versace (google it). The show has such a great scatter gun approach with brilliant writing and characters.  And props to Matthew. Mr Shue is really the heart and soul of the show and this episode shows how much he anchors it. Through his eyes, you believe in the kids and April and see their best come out. And Rachel looks gorgeous in this episode. There is just something about her that is real and sublime."

glee,35u9cs,turkeysrule,2,Wed May 13 22:43:33 2015 UTC,"Okay, I don't want DBS in the final. I just don't understand how LHAK/TLT I so so popular."
glee,35u9cs,Chocobolove,3,Wed May 13 22:48:27 2015 UTC,I thought the Regionals version was way better than the one in Pilot...
glee,35u9cs,turkeysrule,3,Wed May 13 23:36:19 2015 UTC,"I like this version too.. Doesn't beat the group numbers, but it's still good.   Maybe I'm biased, because I really like Lea Michele's voice."
glee,35u9cs,SpencerAnne,2,Thu May 14 11:02:59 2015 UTC,It's okay for that song to lose sometimes lol
glee,35u9cs,turkeysrule,2,Thu May 14 11:12:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but .. to LHAK/TLT?! I don't understand how LHAK/TLT is so popular."
glee,35u9cs,turkeysrule,1 point,Wed May 13 22:37:29 2015 UTC,Turkey Lurkey Time might be one of the worst songs Glee has done..  Sidenote: My username isn't related to actual turkeys at all.
glee,35u9cs,Ayazinha,4,Wed May 13 22:38:40 2015 UTC,I must be the only person who doesn't get the appeal of lets have a kiki :o
glee,35u9cs,yourpants,3,Wed May 13 23:35:38 2015 UTC,"You're not. I thought it was one of the worst performances of the season, yet somehow it's in the semifinals."
glee,35u9cs,Kopratic,4,Thu May 14 07:36:14 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much why I like the song. It's one of the only times in S4 where they don't take themselves overly seriously. The song is meant to be silly, and I like how they set up the beginning part on the phone. I didn't know the song before Glee and had no idea the phone conversation was part of it."
glee,35r047,TVjoker,3,Tue May 12 20:09:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know why, but I didn't expect Don't Speak to get this far."
glee,35r047,yourpants,5,Tue May 12 21:13:38 2015 UTC,Wait... Teenage Dream got beaten by a relatively unknown mashup? Really? I'm pretty sure this is the weirdest exit I've seen in this whole thing so far
glee,35r047,TPNigl,2,Tue May 12 21:41:35 2015 UTC,"I thought Americano/Dance Again was phenomenal (and Cassandra July was criminally underused), but yeah, no way would I have expected it to beat Teenage Dream! By quite a lot too!"
glee,35r047,Chocobolove,1 point,Wed May 13 12:11:12 2015 UTC,By quite a lot too!   Not really...it got 55% of the votes. Which is pretty close as far as winning a 1v1 vote goes.
glee,35r047,deathfire123,0,Thu May 14 11:01:06 2015 UTC,I personally prefer the slower version.
glee,35r047,hi_angie,5,Wed May 13 14:46:16 2015 UTC,Anything besides a homeward bound/ home vs the scientist final 2 would be criminal.
glee,35ps3o,Harmonie,14,Tue May 12 14:44:43 2015 UTC,Kurt doing the single ladies football kick is my all time favourite glee moment
glee,35ps3o,wewillberemembered,9,Tue May 12 19:54:34 2015 UTC,"""That was good, right?"""
glee,35ps3o,turkeysrule,13,Tue May 12 20:18:40 2015 UTC,"Oh man, this was the episode that sealed the deal for me. I loved all the ""Furt"" interactions, and watching Kurt at the end with his dad just broke my heart. I loved that Burt didn't understand Kurt, but he knew enough to just keep loving him. That's all any kid can ask for, really."
glee,35ps3o,CosmicGame,3,Tue May 12 18:53:25 2015 UTC,"This is the episode that got me addicted. Hook, line, and sinker. Gleek for life."
glee,35ps3o,fillurheartwithglee,6,Tue May 12 21:31:44 2015 UTC,"I've just found out about these rewatches but I'll definitely contribute.  The show has such a great mixture of satire and heart at this point. Kendra is viscously hilarious. Sue visiting Sandy in his kimono is one of my favourite ever scenes ""Teaaa-timeee"". Sandy is equal measure hilarious and terrifying. They pack so much in to these episodes its amazing. The characters jump out of the screen at you they are so bold and realised.      I will say though that this is a typical example of people who don't really understand sport doing something with sport that they think might work in a an ""out of the box"" way but would not work and comes across as ridiculous. Doing a dance before kicking the ball doesn't help you get it through the goals. Its quite cringey to me."
glee,35ps3o,girlsjiggle,1 point,Sat May 16 15:22:55 2015 UTC,If you took the whole dance thing seriously at any point then you clearly don't understand the show. At no point did Glee ever seriously try to do any sport (except maybe cheerleading and even that is a stretch).
glee,35ps3o,No_Day_But_Today93,3,Sat May 16 17:12:11 2015 UTC,here's a link to the episode if anyone wants.  (I hope it works).
glee,35ps3o,bellydancingwalrus,2,Wed May 13 17:33:34 2015 UTC,"Idk, I started rewatching too, but I couldnt just watch one episode a week. Or two, three, even five. I just watch them, that ended up with me being in season 5 now and I started like 3 weeks ago.. okay, thats a bit crazy."
glee,35kz4h,TVjoker,3,Mon May 11 10:25:40 2015 UTC,"Day 44   We've gone back in time!  Also, I have a feeling it's gonna come down to The Scientist vs. Some Nights."

glee,35i2ew,turkeysrule,3,Sun May 10 18:32:50 2015 UTC,"For me it was a choice of, 'which song do I dislike the least?'"
glee,35i2ew,finding_jay,4,Sun May 10 23:50:10 2015 UTC,"Really? I quite like Blow Me One Last Kiss.. I though Let's Have A Kiki was awkward though, it was a bad mash up, imo. If it had JUST been Let's Have A Kiki I would have been happy, but mashed with Turkey Lurkey Time it's just bad."
glee,35i2ew,turkeysrule,3,Sun May 10 23:57:49 2015 UTC,"Never noticed Kitty's expression during ""Let me love you"", ahah. Probably my favorite character of the new cast."

glee,35eed2,TVjoker,6,Sat May 9 15:12:17 2015 UTC,How could we lose Mine? Such a great Brittana moment!

This time around, for every round, more than half the songs I've voted for have proceeded to the next round (which rarely happened for me from seasons 2 and 3 >_>).  This round is going to be a tough one particularly - so many songs I care about than the previous part lol :("

glee,353e4s,thegoodspiderman,26,Wed May 6 23:25:06 2015 UTC,Hopefully one day we'll get a no-holding-back Glee tell-all book or something. It's just one of the shows where you KNOW there was a lot going on behind the scenes that we didn't know about.
glee,353e4s,MailTo,3,Thu May 7 00:27:26 2015 UTC,I completely agree. Do you think there was a lot of drama between the cast?
glee,353e4s,Bradlyballz,11,Thu May 7 12:32:09 2015 UTC,I remember seeing something about Ryan Murphy being an ass to many of the cast members. Maybe that's a reason?
glee,353e4s,Ryuushin,8,Thu May 7 16:08:21 2015 UTC,Ryan Murphy seems like the worst.
glee,353e4s,turkeysrule,3,Thu May 7 21:26:50 2015 UTC,"Ryan Murphy is the worst.  I think the cast, for the most part, genuinely loves each other, though? I followed them all pretty hard, haha. And of course even more so since Cory died."
glee,353e4s,thegoodspiderman,3,Sat May 9 02:33:50 2015 UTC,"It does seem like the cast has always been pretty close. At least they seemed that way when the show was airing. They always talk about how they were part of something so special and stuff..   I'm really curious about what went down behind the scenes though. I mean, there must be a reason why Diana Agron hardly came back for s5."
glee,353e4s,turkeysrule,7,Sat May 9 08:28:58 2015 UTC,"Dianna I believe was genuine schedule conflicts (though I wish she could've filmed, like, a 5 second scene of her mourning Finn, but I digress.) There were rumors about her and, I think, Ryan Murphy having tension and that's why she wasn't in The Quarterback, but those were put to rest. I don't like Ryan, but he'd be stupid AND a huge dick not to allow her in that episode.  Naya seems the most out of it with the cast. I wish I could gossip and follow them like it's 2011 again, haha. Where's my tell all book?!"
glee,353e4s,thegoodspiderman,2,Sat May 9 17:04:51 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I never saw the clear up there!   It seems like there's a core of the cast that were always quite close, like Lea, Chris, Jenna, Amber, Kevin and Darren at least! Obviously we know parts of them grew close or knew each other from before the show, like Lea and Cory who fell in love, and Lea knew Matthew and Jonathan from before Glee.  I've been rewatching Glee, and I sincerely forgot how good it was, especially season 1 and 2."
glee,353e4s,turkeysrule,2,Sat May 9 17:10:29 2015 UTC,"I'm so nostalgic right now, haha.  Right?! Season 1 is so good. I used to hate on season 2 when it was airing, but this last rewatch I wanted to slap myself because season 2 is good, especially compared to some of the later seasons/plot lines."
glee,353e4s,thegoodspiderman,6,Sat May 9 18:35:20 2015 UTC,"I love how honest Kevin McHale is. I am sure he still maintains good friendship with some of the cast, he just doesn't want to be on set of Glee because he knows the show has jumped the shark."
glee,353e4s,DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy,6,Thu May 7 07:28:41 2015 UTC,"I appreciate his honest opinion and in many ways I agree, but I also feel like if no one fights for or protects the 'legacy' of glee, it's just going to go down as a big joke."
glee,352m7q,TVjoker,5,Wed May 6 16:12:25 2015 UTC,Closer.. Glee version gives me the goosebumps. Never liked the original but theirs I love.
glee,352m7q,Ryuushin,2,Wed May 6 17:40:01 2015 UTC,"Longest Time vs Girl on Fire. Ugh. Which one will I choose? I know that many people don't like Longest time because Marley was ""screaming"" in the back (as they say), but I don't find it that bad..."

glee,34zmnm,TVjoker,9,Tue May 5 21:48:30 2015 UTC,"""Homeward Bound/Home"" is the sweetest thing. I get a lump in my throat when Cory comes out."
glee,34zmnm,glossandfloss,5,Tue May 5 23:17:21 2015 UTC,It's one of my favorite songs from the series
glee,34zmnm,hoolytoledo,4,Tue May 5 23:22:40 2015 UTC,I can't help but shead a tear everytime I hear or let alone watch the performance of it. It's an undeniably powerful song. :'(
glee,34zmnm,Ryuushin,8,Tue May 5 23:34:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly season 4 wasn't that bad after participating in these latest polls. Songs are generally really good and although character depth was lacking, it wasn't horrendous."
glee,34zmnm,jmanisweird,6,Tue May 5 22:00:23 2015 UTC,How did Oops!...I did it Again get out this early?
glee,34zmnm,hoolytoledo,3,Tue May 5 23:02:54 2015 UTC,"For me, the last match was a bit tough to decide.  I absolutely love each and every one of them.  TWYLT/YNFDWAS is a great mashup, and Everybody Hurts is sentimental and sweet, but I guess ultimately I'll have to vote for Love Song because those three have such amazing chemistry."
glee,34zmnm,yourpants,3,Tue May 5 23:44:09 2015 UTC,"Well, pack it in, everyone. ""Gangnam Style"" is gonna win this whole thing by a landslide."
glee,34zmnm,Chocobolove,3,Tue May 5 23:58:04 2015 UTC,I cannot comprehend how Footloose beat Outcast.

glee,34t7nn,TVjoker,7,Mon May 4 10:51:28 2015 UTC,I'm upset the most about At the Ballet. I always thought it was a underrated performance.
glee,34t7nn,jmanisweird,4,Mon May 4 22:42:55 2015 UTC,"I know I'm in the minority of this, but watching these performances made me forget how cute Jarley actually was.  But Kitty and Jake on that Everybody Talks performance was everything."
glee,34t7nn,hoolytoledo,6,Mon May 4 22:00:28 2015 UTC,Anything would be better than Marley's original songs.
glee,34t7nn,No_Day_But_Today93,4,Mon May 4 16:20:49 2015 UTC,I like her voice actually :(
glee,34t7nn,Ryuushin,6,Mon May 4 17:18:08 2015 UTC,Her voice was fine but her song writing was terrible.
glee,34t7nn,No_Day_But_Today93,2,Mon May 4 17:28:37 2015 UTC,Haha yeah that's how I feel about outcast but love All or Nothing.
glee,34t7nn,Ryuushin,3,Mon May 4 17:54:38 2015 UTC,"Aw, I'm sad we lost Against All Odds :/ I really loved that performance."
glee,34sz87,DayOff4Superman,2,Mon May 4 08:34:22 2015 UTC,"he did say that he originally wrote Glee to be a one season miniseries or a HigH School Musical type 3 part movie, so you might be right."
glee,34sz87,mmayor114,-9,Tue May 5 18:56:45 2015 UTC,"Also in the episode Sectionals in Season 1, Will gives Finn the keys to his car so that Finn can drive to sectionals last minute.  A sophomore would definitely not be old enough to drive by themselves."
glee,34sz87,I__RATE_CATS,6,Tue May 5 02:27:44 2015 UTC,"Well, now, that's just not necessarily true. I was born in October, and therefore didn't start kindergarten the year I turned five, but the year after. Fast-forward to sophomore year, and I was driving myself to school after that first week in October. It's not that rare; I wasn't even the first person in my ten-person friend group."
glee,34sz87,Bradlyballz,4,Wed May 6 20:40:33 2015 UTC,My sophomore year of high school about 75% of my friends and classmates drove.

glee,34plxx,Rhyrem,1 point,Sun May 3 21:54:37 2015 UTC,"Literally: Random Number Generator.  It basically denotes anything that is randomized, such as the song-pairs. I'm really bad at giving a simple explanation, though. Sorry."
glee,34plxx,Kopratic,1 point,Mon May 4 00:17:28 2015 UTC,"RNG is gamer slang for any program that creates purely random outcomes. I'm sure it's used in other computing fields, but it tends to be referenced the most in online games where percentages are based on chance. It relates to real life too, though, like with gambling."
glee,34il6y,TVjoker,4,Fri May 1 13:41:09 2015 UTC,"""Blow Me (One Last Kiss)"" is one of the rare instances where I don't really like the original song, but I do like the Glee performance of it.  Also, I'm sad that ""Unchained Melody"" lost so early."

glee,34il6y,Rhyrem,2,Fri May 1 20:07:00 2015 UTC,Some of these are really hard!  Its interesting how watching just the songs season by season shows how the show changed in style over time...
glee,34il6y,Rhyrem,1 point,Sat May 2 02:11:09 2015 UTC,"Please, explain me what do you do to the RNG to have matches like some of the ones from Season 3 and now this:   Match 16: Teenage Dream VS How to Be a Heartbreaker   I know that How to be a Heartbreaker isn't as great as other performances, but it's a very nice song and to me, this is unfair again despite I voted for Teenage Dream.  EDIT: as it seems that op took this seriously, I want to clarify that my comment was a joke as stated in the reply. I'm not blaming him as RNG is random (or at least pseudo-random)."
glee,34il6y,Rhyrem,4,Fri May 1 19:23:17 2015 UTC,"I make a list of all the songs from the season, then I give them a round with the randomizer. Really couldn't be more fair. Also, it's an elimination tournament. Only one will win anyway, and it doesn't mean jack shit to come in second place. A good song can be eliminated in the final, in the first round. Doesn't matter. If a song doesn't win it means it would've lost at some point anyway, so it doesn't matter when.    Seriously people, I don't care if you feel a randomized match is unfair, but stop blaming me for it.   EDIT: as this was a joke I apologize, but this is still aimed at those who seriously send me PMs like this."
