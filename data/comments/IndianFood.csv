IndianFood,3e3w4t,NymeriaStormborn,2,Tue Jul 21 19:29:46 2015 UTC,This is a good recipe for masoor dal.  It's pretty quick and filling.  Saag choley is another good option since your so likes spinach.   I can usually also pick up pretty good naan and papadums at the indian grocery near my house.  Happy cooking.

IndianFood,3dygc5,ChaosMotor,2,Mon Jul 20 21:51:25 2015 UTC,"If they are using packaged masala, they're all using different ones. Every Indian restaurant around here has a distinct taste.    I guess it's just not economically viable to have someone making a million different spice blends in the kitchen every week   When you're cooking at that scale, you have all the spices on hand, and grinding them or using them whole is seriously no big deal."
IndianFood,3dygc5,coldcoldnovemberrain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:46:42 2015 UTC,"Indian cooking requires all vegetables to be cooked. Very limited concept of a ""salad"", so it is cheaper to use frozen and even canned vegetables (tomato base) in the restaurant. If you think about it, everything is probably already pre-prepared frozen, and all you have to do is put the ingredients together.   I have yet to see an open-kitchen style Indian restaurant. There is a Kathi roll place in SF which has open kitchen, but everything is soaked in Garam masala, way too much of it."

IndianFood,3dmwtc,rx25,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:34:48 2015 UTC,"Some months ago there was a post in /r/LifeProTips about cooking in the microwave at reduced power settings to get better flavor out of reheated dishes.  I've got a microwave that's typically lower wattage than what I'm used to.  Still, I'm putting in a single serving/portion of indian dishes I've been making at 60% power for about 6-6.5m and it comes out fully cooked and just hot enough where it's satisfying but doesn't burn my tongue.  My latest dish was paneer jalfrezi and it worked just great, in my experience.  With that, you might want to experiment a little bit with reduced power settings at shorter durations than what I did to see how it heats up over time at different power settings."
IndianFood,3dmwtc,Buoie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:25:41 2015 UTC,Longer time on a lower power level (covered) is a good way to reheat. Strat with 3 mins on power level 3. Stir and check if it's hot enough. Then heat it sine more if it isn't hot enough. Remember to stir it through. This reheating method pretty much works for anything...
IndianFood,3dmwtc,SunMoonTruth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:33:25 2015 UTC,Cover the microwave safe dish with saran-wrap and heat away. Cut a small slit in it for the excess steam to escape.  Paneer will taste great and the texture will remain intact.

I have eaten ""bizzare"" food that's kind of ""shock value"" like in the movie. I've eaten ant eggs, grasshoppers and other bug stuff in Mexico, and I ate the head of a goat also in Mexico.  This is all currently available in some quite popular restaurants there.   In Cairo I ate brain of something- it was 20 years ago and I don't remember what or which part of town it was.   Never in Indian cuisine though have I heard of anything like what's in that movie ... I'm sure it's all for effect to enforce the ""exoticism"" of travelling overseas.  Another common mechanism for this is the ""market place"" ... you'll notice there's a recurring them in movies of showing crowded noisy marketplaces with all sorts of bizzare things for sale.  In the Carribean you can get ox tail soup.  In other parts of the world there are other equally unusual foods such as fried scorpions, fried frogs etc, but I've never come across or heard of anything quite like that movie.   Edit: the weird foods I've eaten were not created for shock value; they are very traditional foods for that region... we chose to eat them more for experimentation and their ""shock value""."

IndianFood,3cmywk,gonewilde_beest,7,Thu Jul 9 04:02:36 2015 UTC,"I have my own tandoor at home too - but we cheated and had ours shipped to the UK from India. The most important thing about cooking on a tandoor, the one that so many people forget, is the skewers - of course, this doesnt apply to veg and naan, but for meat it is essential. You need to find some thick ( 1cm square steel rod) to use, as it acts as a heat conduit into the centre of the meat, helping to cook the inside as the outside is cooked. This wake, your meat/kebab won't dry out before the inside is cooked through. They are crucial - otherwise, there's nothing making it any different from a good bbq.  Other than that, I hope your naan recipe is on point! Try making tandoori salmon, or shish (seekh) kebab. I will type up recipes for all when I get the chance."
IndianFood,3cmywk,SanjayBeast,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:57:59 2015 UTC,"True, I assume you want to leave some gaps in between the skewered meat so heat can be more easily conducted.  I'm using this naan recipe: http://www.manjulaskitchen.com/2007/05/22/naan-bread/  I'll try to go into my local indian restaurant and politely ask them where they got their naan hook/skewers, or if they could sell me some at cost."
IndianFood,3cmywk,SanjayBeast,4,Thu Jul 9 15:58:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, leaving a gap for conduction of heat between the skewers is something haven't tested. We just cook them how my dad and great uncle (who learnt to cook rajasthani food in India and ran a restaurant in the UK) were taught. The coals should be made into a flat bed at the base of the tandoor, with a small curve in them near your air inlet. Once the sides of your tandoor about 2 inches from the top reach 320C, the tandoor is ready to use for meat and the upper surface for naan. You should be brushing very heavily salted water onto the clay surface of the tandoor for your first couple of firings - it helps the naan stick in traditional ovens  To hold things onto the skewers, you can buy screw on plates that slot onto the skewer, and press up against he meat - or use a half potato, which you discard.  The skewers should then be angles across the fire, not straight up. They will therefor be spaced quite well already. They should be rotated every minute, and seekh kebab should only take 5/7 minutes on that sort of heat.   Naan recipe looks good - make sure you use real ghee to brush over them!  Glad you like it - happy to answer any questions about them, as I've cooked with one for 5/6 years now."

IndianFood,3cmywk,eastshores,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:39:18 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't season it at all, it's just a plain terra cotta pot for me.  I've heard of people seasoning with oil and pastes of food/herbs, but at the temperatures it reaches, any oil or food would just be burned off and turned to ash eventually.  If I built a tandoor with wet clay, I'd definitely look more into firing and tempering the clay, but with the pre-fired and dry clay pot, I don't bother.  I believe that for naan, all you need is a slightly sticky naan bread and a hot, clean (wiped down with a wet cloth) surface.  What would the salt water do? I might be misinformed, but I'd imagine that it would eventually dry out and leave a few salt crystals on the side, which would eventually be picked up by naan breads"

The galvanization is toxic if it gets hot enough to become vaporized (~>600 degrees F I believe). Chances of the actual bin becoming that hot are rare, as it is insulated from the fire, but not worth the risk I suppose.   As for the naan, that's what usually happens with mine, too. My chapati dough does not have this issue, very soft to the touch and rolls out with very little pressure.   By the way, not sure if you do this, but I always finish my chapati directly on the actual gas flame. One or two flips, and it puffs nice and big! Also gets some of those nice charred bits."

I can let the dough mix and work on something else. I let it mixer run for about 5-10 minutes. But, I tend to prefer the dough a bit drier compared to my mother in law.  Then the dough rests for several minutes before rolling.  And I've tried making naans using a couple of different recipes and no luck getting them nice and soft. I have also given up on making naans myself."

On the other hand dishes like butter chicken and palak paneer may be good starting points for people who want to start getting a taste of Indian cuisine and explore from there.

IndianFood,3btqfr,lovelight,3,Thu Jul 2 07:28:52 2015 UTC,The first question is how often would you like to cook Indian food? Cooking even simple Indian dishes requires you to stock up on spices that you would not otherwise use.   In any case - easy things to start with: Basic Daal Tadka (tempered lentil stew) Generic Chicken curry Aloo ki Sabzi (potatoes cooked in Indian spices)
IndianFood,3btqfr,phtark,3,Thu Jul 2 09:46:08 2015 UTC,"Start with premade mixes of masala like Shan. Start figuring out what makes it 'restaurant style' by trial and error. It takes quite a few times, but you start learning what they are doing without the recipe. Taste is so personal, what you and I like could be very different. As you build up the intuition, and that goes beyond 'oh you need these spices', you start to find your groove. I love the taste of ghee, others like various oils. What you think they use and what they do  use may be very different."

IndianFood,3b1dpi,paetrixus,6,Thu Jun 25 04:35:05 2015 UTC,"Sounds like Kedgeree, alright. If it will make you feel better, try Khichdi. This is one of those Indian dishes that was bastardized by the British (see tikka masala), enough so to make it not recognizable. It will probably be difficult to find a Kichidi recipe that is similar to your fam's, but that's the mark of an ever-evolving and fusion-friendly cuisine. Your folks just made due with what they had on hand and made it their own. Sounds delicious and comforting.   The dish that I call Kedgeree is quite a mutation, but makes me happy.  -Sauté some onions and mustard oil in a sauce pot.  -Throw in some curry spices (cumin, mustard, red pepper, whatever curry powder) for another minute or two.  -Now add basmati and chicken broth.  -Boil for ten min, or until rice is not quite done.  -Cube up frozen tuna steaks and toss them in still frozen.  -Stir rapidly while adding a couple raw eggs.  -If you time it just right, the eggs will stiffen up the whole mess into a thick porridge just as the tuna cooks through.  -Fold in some chopped parsley or other green.  -Put it in your face."
IndianFood,3b1dpi,cliteratimonster,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:29:57 2015 UTC,"Sounds like Kedgeree, alright.   lol, ""my"" dish really doesn't resemble what I've found searching for ""kedgeree""; maybe in that it has fish and rice. On the other hand, it doesn't sound all that wildly off from your ""mutation"".  Definitely one shared aspect:   Put it in your face.   Always, with good food. :D  Thank you very much for the information!"
IndianFood,3b1dpi,tryingnottolurk,4,Thu Jun 25 07:32:35 2015 UTC,This is a little more what I think of when I think of kitchari
IndianFood,3b1dpi,tryingnottolurk,3,Thu Jun 25 05:28:31 2015 UTC,"kitchari   But kitchari doesn't usually involve tuna and condensed milk, at least not in my experience."
IndianFood,3axhkm,harighotra,3,Wed Jun 24 07:56:53 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I needed another excuse to make fudge.
IndianFood,3av3n9,NigelKF,3,Tue Jun 23 19:15:52 2015 UTC,"I've never been able to find it locally, so I can't answer your question, I'm afraid. I can't imagine it's much different. Well, the quality of the ghee may change the taste and texture, and I only use ghee from local unpasteurized grass-fed butter."
IndianFood,3aph34,Tagorev,5,Mon Jun 22 13:07:54 2015 UTC,"The thing that seems to work for me is: once your meat is almost fully cooked, then remove the pan from the heat.. let it cool down quite a bit.. add room temperature yogurt/cream.. then let it sit in the dish for a couple of minutes and achieve temperature parity before gently stirring it in.. then you can slowly raise the heat only to gently simmer it.."
IndianFood,3aph34,toomatoo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:38:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll try it out next time. Though there is another thing. For something like biryanis, where chicken is marinated in yoghurt, recipes call for 5-10 minutes of high flame cooking, 15 minutes of medium flame and 20 on low flame. Do you have any ideas on how to stop curdling in a scenario like that?"
IndianFood,3aph34,texture,2,Mon Jun 22 20:33:37 2015 UTC,Are you using no-fat or low-fat yogurt? That might be your problem.
IndianFood,3aph34,NigelKF,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:35:00 2015 UTC,"Using yoghurt with 17% fat, which is the highest I can find where I live. I'm not sure if this is considered high by Indian cooking standards though."
IndianFood,3aph34,NigelKF,3,Tue Jun 23 07:36:07 2015 UTC,"I suggest mixing 1 tbsp besan per cup curd, beating it well with a few tbsp water, and allowing it to come to room temperature before adding it. I started doing these a year or so ago, and I've never had a split since."
IndianFood,3aph34,breakfastfire,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:14:23 2015 UTC,I'll try that! Previously I've only been using 1 tsp of besan for 1 cup.
IndianFood,3aph34,cardeeznutz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:25:31 2015 UTC,"Normally adding so much besan would make it thicken whatever you stir it into too much, but that's why I also use some extra water (which helps prevent it from breaking). It's worth a try, at least. Good luck!"
IndianFood,3aph34,harighotra,2,Wed Jun 24 08:30:06 2015 UTC,"I think what /u/toomatoo said is correct, keep it below the boil.  However, I just watched a Martha Stewart show where she was adding sour cream to mushroom soup and she added flour to keep the sour cream from breaking.  I had never heard of that, so maybe it will work with yoghurt too.  Finally, I am pretty sure creme fraiche will not break.  Good luck!"
IndianFood,3aph34,wlee1987,2,Mon Jun 22 19:56:16 2015 UTC,That only happens to me when I use lowfat or nonfat yoghurt.
IndianFood,3aph34,NigelKF,2,Tue Jun 23 05:23:58 2015 UTC,To add yoghurt without it curdling to a sauce you can add gram flour but I tend to do this when making a dish where the meat is marinading in a yoghurt and it's then added to a sauce like my korma. The other thing I do is make sure the heat is low and add a small spoonful at a time and make sure it's completely blended into the sauce then add another and do the same thing. Repeat until you have added it all in. This should help.
IndianFood,3aowix,brobrobroccoli,3,Mon Jun 22 08:32:06 2015 UTC,"When making dishes that contain bigger (inedible) whole spices (star anise, cinnamon sticks, bay leaves, cardamoms, cloves etc) do you remove them before storing in the fridge or leave them in?  I've been told that whole spices like bay leaves keep giving off their flavor to the point they make the dish bitter and overly spiced tasting."
IndianFood,3aowix,foragerr,2,Mon Jun 22 08:59:20 2015 UTC,"Don't know the general rule/practice, but I hate the extra shot of strong flavor you get around whole spices in stored food. I also hate having to pick them out while eating.  Needless to say, I favor ground up spices to whole spices while cooking."
IndianFood,3aowix,NigelKF,2,Mon Jun 22 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"I personally remove all whole spices whenever possible. I pour tarka through a strainer, use bouquet garnis for things like biryanis, and otherwise go to great lengths to avoid them.   As far as refrigeration with whole spices, you are right on the money. Strong spices like dalachini, tej patta, Kari patta, and laung will take over with time."
IndianFood,3ajea2,Crazy-from-Kong,2,Sat Jun 20 19:45:20 2015 UTC,"That was pretty funny, but...being that you're both white guys, how much familiarity do you actually have with Indian cuisine?  I do see that lots of people have already commented on your youtube explaining, some of these points, but what the hell:   The guy on the left is an actor Dude on the right is apparently some cricket captain ""Dil"" means heart ""dhak-dhak"" is the sound of a heartbeat, in Indian culture. The ""dh"" sound is closer to a ""th"" like when you say ""this"""
IndianFood,3ajea2,cuddlewench,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:45:21 2015 UTC,"That's a little racist. I grew up in California and live in Oregon, my skin is pale, and I know more about Indian cuisine than my Indian coworker."
IndianFood,3ajea2,NigelKF,3,Tue Jun 23 23:24:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's racist at all. If someone is Indian, there's a very high chance they've grown up around authentic, home cooked Indian cuisine. For those that don't appear characteristically Indian, there's a possibility they might be familiar with authentic cuisine from the region, of course, but it's not an intuitive assumption to draw.  Also, while really funny, one of the reviewers named the spices by color rather than name or flavor. This is the main reason I posed the question."
IndianFood,3ajea2,cuddlewench,0,Wed Jun 24 02:14:06 2015 UTC,"If you had assumed that they aren't familiar with the cuisine because they can't identify the spices, that's one thing. But the world is very small these days - there are white families in my town that speak only Hindi among themselves and eat nothing but Indian food.   It's a bit like asking if you know how electricity works because you're Indian. Many people there don't have it, so it's a valid assumption, right?   We aren't all the same, and making assumptions about cuisine because of skin tone is offensive.   Edit: it also has to do with phrasing. You wrote what could have been a very innocent question as condescending. How much familiarity do you actually have with <>, anyway? is a bad way to put it. Makes you sound snobbish."
IndianFood,3ajea2,NigelKF,3,Wed Jun 24 04:32:36 2015 UTC,"I really think you're reading into it, bud. Perhaps if I'd ended the exchange there, however, I went on to offer additional info in a friendly tone. It can be hard to judge intention in text, but I don't think it's fair to jump to negative conclusions, either. Sorry if it ruffled your feathers, that wasn't my intention.  I have to disagree with you on your other point. The fact that there are white families by you that speak Hindi fluently is great! I'm truly pleased to hear it. But we'd be deluding ourselves to use that as a sample size off of which to extrapolate that the majority of white families have experience with authentic Indian cuisine. Majority =/= outlier use cases, by definition.  Also, making assumptions about cuisine familiarity based on skin tone isn't offensive, it's a good guess. Saying white families couldn't appreciate Indian cuisine, on the other hand, is pretty fucking rude. Luckily, this is not what I said or assumed, so hopefully you can see why I believe I'm in the clear.  Btw, I realize I'm stating opinions as facts, but given this is my comment, I'm assuming we're all clear that it's my opinion being shared."
IndianFood,3ajea2,cuddlewench,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:29:02 2015 UTC,"I'll be happy to leave it at this: making assumptions about people's history or knowledge based on the way they were born is harmful and offensive, IMO."
IndianFood,3ajea2,NigelKF,2,Wed Jun 24 05:48:41 2015 UTC,"I think this is actually a good discussion we're having though, so if you'd like to continue a bit further, I'm game.   I understand we're thinking of this differently here, but in my mind, drawing basic assumptions about people is kind of a survival skill. How we look can't be hidden and plays a huge part in most of our lives. How can that be offensive? I'm not saying it's a pretty truth in this would-be melting pot world we live in (if you're in the West), but it's true nonetheless. Application and context is also important, of course.  To say ""assumptions about people's history and knowledge"" is a broad statement that sounds misleading given the context of our debate. The video reviewers being white guys doesn't mean that they can't know about Indian cuisine. But I think it's absolutely fair to say the probability of their knowing about it is significantly lowered (especially when you take the spice colors portion into account). I know the video was done at least partly in jest and I enjoyed it, but I do think my question also stands in light of the above.  Anyway, thanks for keeping it civil, hope you're having a good night. :)"
IndianFood,3ajea2,cuddlewench,0,Wed Jun 24 07:06:33 2015 UTC,"Someone's skin color does not determine what they know. Making racially based assumptions is harmful - whether true or not. It perpetuates stereotypes, like non-Indian people not knowing about Indian culture, or like Mexican immigrants not knowing how to speak English.   Since you brought up my sample size earlier, what's yours? How many white people have you talked to about Indian food? I'm guessing not very many. You're relying on what you assume to be facts. I'm not saying that most white people do or don't know about Indian cuisine - I'm saying you shouldn't assume things about people's minds because of their bodies."
IndianFood,3ajea2,NigelKF,2,Wed Jun 24 07:27:47 2015 UTC,"Of course skin color doesn't determine what a person knows, but it can be a good indicator of base knowledge (Indian people TEND to know about Indian cuisine and culture. Non Indian people TEND to not know about those things). Again, it doesn't mean they can't learn or in rare cases, have been raised in that other culture, just that it's fair to say this is not the norm.  I actually worked in a cultural center for a year and half recently, so I've interacted with a looot of white people who both knew about Indian culture or were interested in educating themselves further (not just Indian culture, either, obviously, but that's the most relevant segment for this debate). I've taken several white people (and Mexicans and Puerto Ricans, etc.) to the Indian ethnic neighborhoods and shown them around, answered their questions and discussed nuances of the culture with them. Most of these people were friends that I met through the center, but the tours weren't mandated by the job, it was just something I did to hang out.   I'm saying you shouldn't assume things about people's minds because of their bodies.   Maybe this is where our disconnect is taking place—what I'm actually saying is that you can draw some assumptions of people's familiarities with certain information based on skin color if it's relevant, which I believe it is in this case.   In the same way I could safely assume that Mexican immigrants may not speak English fluently. (I grew up around Mexican immigrants for the bulk of my childhood). This doesn't mean I'd be condescending or rude, but that I might not use colloquialisms in greeting like ""Rough day at the office, bud?"" with an immigrant woman and instead opt for a simple smile and, ""Hi, how are you?"" I don't find these actions to be racist or harmful.  As I'm brown, I've had people do the same with me but as soon as I actually speak, it's apparent English is my best language and we proceed accordingly, no issues."

IndianFood,39yjam,nomnommish,3,Tue Jun 16 22:48:53 2015 UTC,"Many good answers already. Another thing to note: If you are looking for a substitute for heavy cream, i.e. a thickener for curries, there are other vegan options besides coconut milk. Ground cashews work very well for example. So does ground roasted sesame seeds.  Another thing about coconuts: A lot of the dishes in the (coconut growing) coastal parts of India also use freshly grated coconuts. That stuff is sublime. Do get a coconut grater if you don't already have it, and try grating some. You can eat it as it is, or eat with a dusting of sugar, or garnish it on most curries in the end.  Besides fresh grated coconut, dried or dessicated coconut is also used in many curries. It has a much more intense coconut flavor - some people find it too strong but others love it."
IndianFood,39yjam,Sub_Salac,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:33:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, cashews sound like a great idea. I've used them in white sauces and stuff but didn't think to try them in curries.

I'm assuming you are more familiar with north Indian/Punjabi cuisine, so I'll list the basic ingredients for that. Mughlai dishes are also made using these ingredients, but with cashews, almonds, and heavy cream added.  Fresh produce:   Onions Ginger Garlic Tomatoes Green chilies Cilantro/Coriander   Spices:   cumin seeds (powdered seeds are also used a lot) coriander seeds (also used powdered) ""Garam"" masala (you can buy this packaged) Turmeric powder Red chili powder Peppercorns Cinnamon sticks Bay leaves Cloves Cardamom Dried fenugreek leaves   Also, Ghee (a kind of clarified butter) if you can find it.  Good luck!"
IndianFood,39thdb,hope_full_,4,Sun Jun 14 17:05:42 2015 UTC,"I just started learning Indian cooking a couple weeks ago and asked the same question. Here's some other spices that were mentioned:   Amchoor (mango powder) black mustard seeds curry leaves ( can be frozen or bought dried) Hing powder mace tamarind paste clove   While on the topic of spices try to buy the freshest available and when possible buy whole as opposed to preground stuff (buy a coffee grinder to grind your own). As soon as its ground, the spices start to lose their potency and trust me its worth keeping your spices as fresh as possible.  If you want a nice mix of convenience while still keeping quality id recommend grinding up a weeks worth of whole spices at the beginning of the week. For better flavor dry roast your whole spices before grinding. About 30 seconds on medium low heat. Just to bring out the flavor a bit you don't want to burn them.  To organize spices most Indians have what is called a Masala Dabba (this is on my wishlist)   Also I'd like to add some general tips that have helped me. First of all preparation is key. There will be recipes that have tons of spices that have to be added to the food at a certain time to develop the flavor correctly so have everything portioned out and cut/ chopped ready to be added. This makes cooking so much more relaxing and enjoyable as well.   To organize spices for a recipe I bought an ice cube tray which I have cut into 3  sections. This gives me 4 little cubes which I have found is a perfect amount for most uses. I'll just measure out the spices and put in these trays so I'm ready to cook.  You'll notice a LOT of recipes start with ginger, garlic and cumin seeds. You can buy the pre minced stuff for convenience but a microplane will make quick work of garlic and ginger and it will taste better. Also burnt garlic is very bitter so be careful not to burn it. You should only need to cook it until the raw garlic taste is gone. 30 seconds to a miutes should be plenty until you move on to the next part of the recipe.  I'm having a blast learning. Let me know if you stumble upon any cool tips or a bomb recipe. I'll keep adding tips if I think of more"

You can buy garlic and ginger pre-minced and jarred at most supermarkets/speciality stores these days which is a bit of a timesaver on the prep (just whack a tablespoon of each into your heated spiced fat and you've cut prep time by a few mins).

When I can't find good bread, I just eat rice.  Fresh roti/chappati is very easy to make. This is what we eat on a daily basis and is healthier than naan. All you need is a simple dough of whole wheat flour and water. Here's a video recipe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwtelJNe7ls  PS: terrible music and all in the video, but she does a good job of explaining the process"

IndianFood,39thdb,BeastroMath,2,Mon Jun 15 20:59:34 2015 UTC,"/u/tryingnottolurk has a good list for north Indian cuisine. I usually cook south Indian food so if that's something you're interested in, I'd also add these to the list: - Curry leaves - Ginger Garlic paste (available in jars) - Tamarind paste  - Fresh cilantro bunch - Shan Biryani Masala , not just for biryani! I like to add a little bit of this to my curries once in a while for some added flavor.  I personally prefer using Roma tomatoes when I cook. Also, depending on where you live you might be able to find uncooked chapati/roi (the stuff I use is called Desi Roti). These are super convenient to use, just pop one on a heated pan and cook both sides. Preparing the dough, kneading and making the rotis gets tedious real quick if you plan to eat them on a regular basis."

Do they literally just mean pick any type of green chili? I've been using jalapeno and serrano because that's what i can get my hands on.

IndianFood,39lk3o,speedycat2014,4,Fri Jun 12 16:09:15 2015 UTC,"I'll answer but before I do, there is some preliminary information you should know.   Indian food is different from Western food in two major ways: 1) The flavor comes from spooning in generous quantities of different spices. Not by sprinkling one or two spices/herbs. So there is multi-layered flavors that an experienced tongue can discern. 2) There is no standard reciepie for any single dish. A butter chicken in a South Bombay joint will be made differently from a butter chicken in the joint across the street. The malai kofta my mom makes is different from the malai kofta my grandmom makes. Of course different dishes also have different gravies (Saag is a spinach based gravy for example).   What is the difference between butter chicken and chicken tikka masala? I think I've heard that tikka masala includes tandoori roasted chicken, whereas butter chicken does not. Is the gravy the same?   Butter chicken is a chicken dish with a cream/butter based gravy. The chicken is cooked along with the gravy. Chicken tikka masala is a phony British invention and here's why: Chicken tikka is basically a grilled chicken dish from Punjab. Chicken cubes are marinated in yogurt and a mix of spices and are skewered and cooked in a tandoor (clay oven). Its eaten juicy dry. When this dish was served in Britain, the customer base wanted something more ""gravier"" so they took the cooked chicken tikka pieces and put them in a masala (Indian curry gravy) thus creating the infamous ""British invention"" - Chicken tikka masala. The gravy is cooked seperately and can be either cream based or tomato based or whatever.    The term 'gravy' for the sauces, is that the right term? Since I've been using it. :)   Yes, it can be used.    I once had a phenomenal dish at the Connaught Place in Fairfax, VA. (Since closed, so sad.) I believe it was called 'Paneer padji', or at least that's how it sounded. Had peas, paneer, and some other bits I don't remember. I have tried Googling this but found nothing else on it. Am I remembering it all wrong?    There is no such thing AKAIK. Describe the dish and perhaps someone can figure it out.   Why do some curries seem to have a creamier gravy than others? Some restaurants have really good, creamy gravies. Others are more gritty, less creamy. Is it just an expectation that it varies from restaurant to restaurant?   Read the preliminary information. It should make things clear.   I know chicken korma is a cashew based curry, but I ordered something very similar once called 'chicken methi korma'. The current restaurant where I order has 'chicken methi' and 'chicken korma' but not 'chicken methi korma'. Is it just that perhaps that one restaurant put methi in their korma?   Chicken methi korma is basically chicken korma with added methi (Fenugreek seeds and/or leaves) in the gravy. Chicken methi is an entirely different dish without the korma gravy but instead has a methi based gravy.  You're welcome!"

IndianFood,39lk3o,full-of-grace,3,Fri Jun 12 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"The story, as it's usually told, as that chicken tikka masala was a British adaptation of the common Indian dish chicken tikka, which was more of a dry curry without the creamy sauce. Butter chicken, or murgh makhani, was a Punjabi adaptation of chicken tikka masala—a chicken dish with a creamy curry sauce, mild enough for tourists' palates, but using more traditional Indian cooking techniques and flavours. In practice, if you eat butter chicken in the UK or Americas, you're probably getting a westernized version (a western adaptation of an Indian adaptation of a western adapation of an Indian dish) that's virtually indistinguishable from chicken tikka masala. Either way, preparations vary widely; either can have butter or ghee in the sauce, either can be booked in a tandoor oven, spice mixes vary. You from the south? People call 'em gravies there. Probably look at you funny if you called them sauces. Most of the rest of the English worldcalls them sauces. They don't usually meet the standard western culinary definition of 'gravy', but you're not a French restaurant, so who cares. Maybe paneer bhurji? It's a lacto-vegetarian adaptation of anda bhurji, which is eggs scrambled with onions, chilies, and spices. You'll see a huge variety in ingredients in recipes for either of those, too. Mainly has to do with the way the sauces are prepared. Exceptionally creamy sauces may be blitzed in a high-speed blender; the spices may be ground extra fine; they may be strained through a fine chinois. It's gonna vary between restaurants. The ingredients and proportions will affect it too, of course—a sauce based on cream or coconut cream is going to be creamier than once based entirely on tomatoes and onions. Generally, the pricier the place is, the more care they'll put into prep details, but there are exceptions. Yes, that's exactly it."

Before I left Georgia (when I was 22) and moved up to Washington, DC, to me ""ethnic"" or ""exotic"" food was sweet and sour chicken!  I moved to DC to work on building the Internet back in the early 1990's. That's when my new friends introduced me to Indian food at The Connaught Place in Fairfax.  The folks who ran that restaurant knew me, to the point that 2 years after I left in 2004, when I showed up with my husband on a trip by, they hurried out a side of chicken tikka masala for me! (The joke was that I'd order something but they knew I always wanted some of the chicken tikka masala because I raved about it on the buffet the first time I had it.)  Since then, I've had a soft spot in my heart for Indian food. Walking into a fragrant restaurant will immediately lower my blood pressure and put a smile on my face.

If you mix with the yoghurt before hand it will probably turn really bitter. Even better though I would leave the two separate so you have a green chutney (I would add a little chilli and salt to this too) which you can make before you go and a separate yogurt dip for cooling.

IndianFood,39095b,2Cuil4School,3,Mon Jun 8 13:18:38 2015 UTC,"I'd look into ones that seem to favor green chilies, ginger (maybe even in the form of ginger-garlic paste and ginger ""drumsticks"" later on), and yogurt over heavy cream.

IndianFood,38wx69,Bo_Peep,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:27:44 2015 UTC,"It was actually an accident. I had the intention of making a soup. I sauteed onions and ginger in oil, added some cumin, cayenne, coriander power and salt, then put chopped carrot and broccoli in the pot with water and simmered until the vegetables were soft enough to blend. The soup wasn't tasty enough though so I decided to try adding some turmeric, fenugreek powder, garam masala, and a bit of tomato paste to improve it. As the soup reduced into a sauce like consistency as I cooked it longer and I tasted the result, I realized I had inadvertently made something resembling an Indian carrot-based curry sauce. I suppose a more usual recipe might have blended bell peppers instead of broccoli with the carrots, but it turned out well nonetheless. It doesn't taste like carrots (or broccoli at all for that matter). The carrot base just adds body, colour and sweetness. I'm not sure what the broccoli contributes apart from making the sauce a less bright shade of orange."

IndianFood,3835an,Jodabomb24,2,Mon Jun 1 14:51:41 2015 UTC,I would like to know this as well. I made puris the other night and they all turned too crispy. I thought I was doing okay since some of them puffed.
IndianFood,3835an,Evolutionarybiologer,2,Mon Jun 1 16:06:11 2015 UTC,"I think the most important thing to keep in mind is the temperature of the oil. Make sure it is really hot and when you place the puri in the hot oil ( oil should be bubbling), gently dab the surface of the puri which causes it to rise. If your oil is hot, they should surely rise and also won't be very greasy.  Another thing that you can try is making a slightly stiffer or harder dough (little less water while kneading) for the puris."
IndianFood,3835an,gulaabjamun,2,Mon Jun 1 16:23:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn’t be too harsh on yourself - 7 or 8 out of a batch of 60 that didn’t rise isn’t bad at all. For some reason you always get a few that don’t puff up it’s a bit like the first pancake you make is always rubbish i guess. My main tips would be to ensure the dough is mixed properly, make sure you leave it to rest with a damp cloth over it for about half an hour and make sure the oil is the right temperature. Remember that after you have fried a batch the oil may well cool down so you may need to let it heat a little before adding the next batch. Always test it with a little piece of batter if it browns and rises straight away them it’s ready.  Hope that helps :)"

IndianFood,370ovv,nenid,2,Sat May 23 19:46:08 2015 UTC,Ah this recipe combines two of my favorite things - the flavors of whole garam masalas and the kick of mustard oil. Perfect !
IndianFood,36y64t,alex617,3,Sat May 23 02:38:30 2015 UTC,"Condensed milk was regularly used in home-made ice cream in western countries, before the invention of ice-cream machines. Nowadays ice cream, in general, is relatively cheap to buy from the store. So not many people bother to make it at home."
IndianFood,36y64t,knovaa,3,Sat May 23 02:53:28 2015 UTC,But home made is like 1000 times better
IndianFood,36y64t,KingJoffreyTheBaked,3,Sat May 23 11:12:24 2015 UTC,And now your life's dream has been fulfilled right?  Ice cream does that.  :)
IndianFood,36tv9p,phtark,3,Fri May 22 02:04:55 2015 UTC,"Mine's a lot like yours, except I always do cardamom and no tulsi - I've never had it with tulsi actually, but I'd love to try it! I also add a bunch of crushed black pepper, though I don't have an actual measurement for that. Maybe it's like half a teaspoon, for three cups of tea?  I never sweeten mine, and I actually simmer all the spices in a half water, half milk mixture, rather than adding milk at the end. This does mean the chai tends to get a skin on the top of it as it cools, but it's much richer, and the milkfat seems to help absorb the flavor of the spices (though maybe that's just my imagination). I've never paid close attention to how long I let it brew, but it's a lot longer than 3-4 minutes as I like mine to be very spicy. Probably closer to 15 minutes. You just have to keep an eye on it so that it doesn't boil and curdle the milk."
IndianFood,36tv9p,TinyLongwing,3,Fri May 22 03:10:58 2015 UTC,"Ah, I add black pepper and cloves when I have a flu, it's very very soothing ! (though whole black pepper instead of crushed)  Your method sounds quite enticing. I am guessing such a chai wouldn't be something you'd be drinking daily, given the time it takes to make it. I am a daily tea drinker so I need it to be ready to drink in 5-7 mins flat !"
IndianFood,36tv9p,TinyLongwing,2,Fri May 22 03:26:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's true, I don't have time to make chai like this every day and most of the time I'm very happy drinking other types of tea. But for weekends or events, I love making it that way."
IndianFood,36tv9p,kartoos,4,Fri May 22 03:31:39 2015 UTC,"Here's a round up of various spices I have had in tea in various combinations   Ginger Tulsi / Holy Basil Cardamon - green and black  Cinnamon Cloves Fennel Pepper   My ideal combo is to cook the tea with some ginger, add about a 1/3 of milk by volume, add freshly powdered black cardamon seeds (seed of one cardamon for 1 cup) once the heat has been switched off. Stir, strain, pour and enjoy!  A sweet tea I had in Rajasthan made with camel milk and jaggery was also awesome."
IndianFood,36tv9p,kartoos,4,Fri May 22 10:27:51 2015 UTC,"Black cardamom in tea? I'd never even considered that. Definitely going to give it a go.   Have you tried ""namkeen chai""? It's Kashmiri. Had it once at a Kashmiri restaurant near Jama Masjid in Delhi. Was very unique"
IndianFood,36tv9p,spetrovov,5,Fri May 22 15:01:27 2015 UTC,"Yeps, in the hilly tribal areas of J&K and Himachal tea is made with butter and salt and no milk, its certainly an acquired taste esp. if made with Yak milk.  Black cardamom seeds in tea is very nice, it matures the taste profile, and is not as aromatic as green cardamon, which can be overpowering."
IndianFood,36tv9p,spetrovov,3,Fri May 22 17:40:24 2015 UTC,"You can try putting ginger and lemon grass (no other spice, just these two, and of course, sugar and tea powder). This is more of a Maharashtrian twist to making a cup of tea. Enjoy it during rains."
IndianFood,36tv9p,thisismyaccountclean,2,Fri May 22 20:03:15 2015 UTC,That's interesting. I wasn't aware of the use of lemongrass is Maharashtra. Is it prevalent in other dishes in Maharashtrian cuisine?
IndianFood,36tv9p,NigelKF,2,Sat May 23 00:50:04 2015 UTC,"Nope. As far as i know, its just used in tea."
IndianFood,36tv9p,NigelKF,1 point,Sat May 23 07:37:36 2015 UTC,Try putting pudina in tea. Tastes awesome.
IndianFood,36tv9p,NigelKF,1 point,Thu May 28 05:25:04 2015 UTC,"I use the following for my daily chai-  Fennel, cloves, cinnamon, ajwain or black pepper, black and green cardamom, ginger, allspice, mace, kala namak, nagkesar, and anise.   I rarely use all of those, I mix depending on my mood and the weather. I use just a tiny touch of kala namak when I use it. I also sweeten with jaggery, always - it makes a difference."
IndianFood,36mrvl,225274,7,Wed May 20 15:05:18 2015 UTC,"Austrian here, however, I personally love VERY spicy food.  I've cooked Indian food for a couple of friends and my brother so far.   Here's what was really popular so far:   Butter Chicken Chicken Korma basic Chicken Curry (tomato base with cumin, coriander and Kasoori Methi) Tandoori Chicken Pork Vindaloo (although it was a bit too spicy for them) Chapati/Roti and Naan as a side are very popular   Basically anything that is rather mildly spiced and not packing a lot of heat will work from my experience."

IndianFood,36mrvl,ShotgunZen,6,Wed May 20 17:12:54 2015 UTC,Queso fresco works too. Any non melting farmers cheese works great. Just toast the sides in a skillet and add to creamed spinach then add some spices for a quick palak paneer. I know some people even substitute tofu but I have tried it and is isnt as good as using queso fresco
IndianFood,36mrvl,victoryvines,1 point,Wed May 20 18:01:19 2015 UTC,"Depends if you can get good queso fresco. The only one I can find here is way too crumbly to use as paneer. I can get good paneer here, though, so I'm not complaining."
IndianFood,36mrvl,furgots,3,Wed May 20 22:09:39 2015 UTC,I use tofu - chop it into blocks and fry it up; tastes and feels almost the same as paneer (although sadly not as rich).
IndianFood,36mrvl,penjsface,1 point,Wed May 20 18:44:57 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a good idea, I'll try it."
IndianFood,36mrvl,coolguy1793B,7,Wed May 20 19:43:50 2015 UTC,Don't do this - use ricotta salatta or make your own paneer.
IndianFood,36mrvl,pipocaQuemada,1 point,Wed May 20 22:07:34 2015 UTC,"Paneer cheese is just a pressed ricotta cheese cut in cubes... Try finding an Italian cheese shop, they might able to help.   Also, maybe a sausage dish - say a bratwurst and potato with sliced red pepper curry served with with either naan or rice. IIRC, there something called currywurst sausage, so it would be an elevation of that dish."
IndianFood,36mrvl,texture,2,Wed May 20 17:42:35 2015 UTC,"Ricotta (Italian pronunciation: [riˈkotta]) is an Italian whey cheese made from sheep (or cow, goat, or Italian water buffalo) milk whey left over from the production of cheese. Like other whey cheeses, it is made by coagulating the proteins that remain after the casein has been used to make cheese, notably albumin and globulin.   Paneer is made from milk curdled with lemon juice.  Ricotta is made from the liquid left after making something like paneer."

IndianFood,36mrvl,kartoos,2,Thu May 21 13:06:33 2015 UTC,"I think a very fragnant yakhni pulao will do very well. It's not fiery like most biryanis, it's got the kick of chicken stalk and fragrance of cardamom, cloves, cinnamon and saffron and add in fried onions for some crunch. You can make it richer by tossing in toasted nuts and some raisins. It's a good glimpse of what Indian cooking is all about and it does not overwhelm the palette."
IndianFood,36mrvl,phtark,2,Wed May 20 23:35:43 2015 UTC,"Here's an easy recipe which I make and works really well, its mild in taste and well received by people new to Indian cuisine. I call it spicy apple chicken. Commercially, you probably won't get an apple chutney (as I make it at home) but you can substitute it with a spicy mango relish or a sweet and spicy chutney (look at your Indian grocery store to get a jar)  1/2 Kg sliced paneer or 1/2 kg grilled/roasted chicken  1 teaspoon mild chili powder - or to taste  1 teaspoon garam masala  1 teaspoon minced garlic  3 tablespoons tomato puree  2 tablespoons Greek yogurt  2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander/parsley   2 tablespoons green apple chutney or mango chutney  Salt to taste - check once cooking and then add if required (as the chutney has salt)  1-2 tablespoons oil or ghee  1 green chily, chopped - optional  2 tablespoons single cream - optional  1/2 teaspoon fenugreek powder (kasoori methi)  Blend  tomato puree, yoghurt, garam masala, chili powder, garlic, apple chutney & salt. Then heat some oil or ghee and add the tomato mixture, cook this at low heat for for about 2-3 minutes-stirring occasionally. (Always keep the heat low!)  Add chicken/paneer and a little cold water,and continue to cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add chilies, coriander, fenugreek and cream, stir in well and cook for a few minutes more. If the sauce is a little thick just add water or milk to achieve your preferred consistency.  Serve with boiled rice and/or naan bread."
IndianFood,36mrvl,kartoos,2,Wed May 20 18:22:02 2015 UTC,Looks like a very interesting recipe. Does the taste of the apple chutney come through? It seems like tomato and garam masala might overpower it. I'm still going to try it though :)
IndianFood,36mrvl,FamousNerd,1 point,Wed May 20 23:39:29 2015 UTC,"I use a very mild amount of garam masala, and the curry tastes something very akin to a butter chicken but subtly different, and much lighter.    Most people can't figure out what's the slightly sweet and savory element till told, I take that as the part of the reveal.  (They can't believe it's not butter chicken)"
IndianFood,36mrvl,nomnommish,2,Thu May 21 02:44:28 2015 UTC,"I love biryani, saffron peas pulao, rogen josh. on the not so spicy side.  You don't have to go spicy to use lots of spices.. like cloves, star anise, curry leaves etc.. you'd prob know better than I.. I'm Canadian."

IndianFood,36gvsb,harighotra,3,Tue May 19 08:14:04 2015 UTC,Pretty interesting! Also love the color that beets provide to dishes.  Is there a good alternative for the gooseberries? They are actually illegal to grow in my state here in the US! (Apparently they're a carrier for a nasty fungus that's lethal to the local pine trees)
IndianFood,36gvsb,2Cuil4School,0,Tue May 19 16:14:21 2015 UTC,You could just use a green apple which will have a similar texture and add the tartness too :)
IndianFood,36gvsb,2Cuil4School,1 point,Wed May 20 08:27:51 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you. Looking forward to trying it soon (got a few beets rolling around from making ""bombay sandwiches"" here lately)."

IndianFood,36gvsb,lancairns,2,Thu May 21 08:49:54 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! It's a mixture of recipes I found online, so I can't take any special kind of credit for it.  Ingredients   1 Beet, steamed till soft and sliced thin 2 Potatoes, steamed till soft and sliced thin (I like skin on--more fiber) 1 Red Onion, sliced thin 1 Cucumber, sliced 3-4 Roma Tomatoes, sliced Cilantro Chutney Buttery Spread Wheat Bread Garam Masala Chat Masala Kosher Salt (Optional) Melting Cheese, like Mozzarella, shredded   Directions  Butter 1 side each piece of 2 pieces of bread (both, lightly, if grilling it). Spread coriander chutney over the butter. Then layer on a portion of beets, potatoes, onion, and cucumber, sprinkling lightly with salt and either garam or chat masala between each vegetable. Top with the other piece of bread and slice, then serve.  It's really nice to add some cheese (and an extra piece of chutney-spread bread in the middle for more structure), then toast it in a panini grill or pan, but that's a little more decadent, so I don't do it as often.  The above ingredients make about 5-6 sandwiches, depending on the size of the bread in question.  Since they prep fast, they're a really nice lunch. From what I understand, they're a pretty popular street/quick service food in India, so I guess that makes sense!    I hope to give the patties a shot this weekend; I'll try to leave a review on your website when I do!"

It's often a good idea to cook lentils separate from the ""main flavors"" of the dish, with just a bit of seasoning (e.g., salt and turmeric) in the water with them."
IndianFood,36g3oa,2Cuil4School,5,Tue May 19 14:33:46 2015 UTC,"masoor dhal (red lentils) in a pot with 2-3x amt of water (add more if needed), some turmeric, chili powder, salt cook till it becomes mushy.  In a separate pan, add oil, mustard, cumin seeds, then fry onions, then garlic and green chilis, methi leaves (if you want). Add ginger, tomato, spinach (a good amount of spinach, the dish is a lentil spinach curry). Now add the cooked lentils.

IndianFood,36g3oa,harighotra,2,Tue May 19 15:07:32 2015 UTC,That's a great tip! Reduces the cooking time and again the lentils hold their shape.
IndianFood,36g3oa,an8hu,2,Wed May 20 10:49:56 2015 UTC,"Here in India people normally use pressure cooker to make Dal, but if you don't have pressure cooker, here's what you can do.   Wash and soak the lentils you are using in plain water for half an hour to an hour beforehand. Now as someone pointed out don't use anything acidic while cooking the Dal, as it can hamper the process of cooking it. In a heavy bottomed pan take your soaked lentils and add 3 times the amount of water, some turmeric, and salt according to taste. Cook it on a medium flame and adjust the quantity of water accordingly until you get the desired consistency of Dal. Now in a separate pan make your tempering and add it to your Dal."

IndianFood,36g3oa,DianeBcurious,0,Wed May 20 10:21:43 2015 UTC,"If your lentils are still crunchy after 4-5 hrs(!), you definitely have a problem. Lentils and other legumes won't soften properly if they're soaked or cooked-from-dried with:  ...acidic ingredients (tomatoes, wine, lemon, etc) ...sweeteners (sugar, honey, maple syrup, etc) ...""hard"" water (those with hard tap water have to buy bottled water just for cooking legumes) ...or the legumes are just too old (they just dry out too much over a long period, or in hot conditions for a long time)  Most lentils should take 40-55 minutes of total cooking time, though red lentils at least can be done in 30 or less.  In a pressure cooker, they'd be done even sooner of course."

IndianFood,36df2t,SabashChandraBose,2,Mon May 18 18:56:40 2015 UTC,You must be confusing toor with dal makhani. Toor is always mushy.
IndianFood,36df2t,harighotra,1 point,Mon May 18 17:51:36 2015 UTC,"I too like my dhal to have a texture to it rather then being just a mush, I do think some of this is about practice and the more time you try it the more instinctive you will become about when its ready.  A few points to bear in mind - wash the dhal until you remove all the starch and the water runs clear. Start to cook it in cold water and leave it to simmer gently. Ideally with toor dhal you need to cook it for 45-1hour where as red lentil only take 10 minutes so be aware that different lentils take different times to cook.   Test the lentils by squeezing one between your fingers if it’s all soft then it’s ready and needs very little further cooking when you add your masala to it.  Try this red lentil dhal recipe as it’s a really good basic dhal recipe to start with here's the video which has lots of useful tips https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQxHojkKgO8  You can also try using a pressure cooker like I have with this recipe reduces the cooking time and again the lentils hold their shape. http://www.harighotra.co.uk/indian-recipes/mains/chana-dhal-with-pumpkin"

IndianFood,35zfwq,Yellowbenzene,6,Thu May 14 20:23:12 2015 UTC,"A simple recipe:  Ingredients-  1 Aubergine (big purple ones), 2 onions, 3 tomatoes, 2-3 green chillies, 1 tbsp ginger garlic paste, 1 tsp chilli powder, 2tsp coriander powder, 1/2 tsp garam masala, 1/2tsp turmeric powder.  Aubergine prep: lightly brush the aubergine with oil and roast it on a grill. You should keep roasting it till it becomes soft and the skin starts to peel off. Let it cool for a while, de-skin it and chop it up roughly into smaller chunks (hence the name bharta).  Cooking: in a wok/pan take a bit of oil, temper it with jeera and rai. Add onions and green chillies. Cook till slightly golden brown. Add tomatoes and salt. Cook till its easy to break it with a spoon. Add the dry masalas and ginger garlic paste. Mix and cook till there is no raw smell of the ginger garlic paste. Now add the bharta and cook for some more time. In the end add coriander leaves for a fresh taste.  Variations:  You can add a tbsp of curd or lime juice to give it an extra zing.  Pomegranate seeds to mellow the spiciness and also to introduce tartness into the dish"

IndianFood,35vig4,KioraTheExplorer,5,Wed May 13 21:24:39 2015 UTC,"I think the ""focus"" of Tikka Masala is the Tikka, ie, Fried Chicken. The fact that the Chicken pieces are Tikka-fied should really come out in the dish. Another aspect is that because original verson of Tikka Masala is probably British-Indian, the flavor should be palatable to British taste, hence, have a lot of cream and sweetness.  In Murgh Makhani, the ""focus"" of the dish should be the buttery-ness of the sauce. Perhaps enhance it with cream or make it very rich with additional chicken fat? And add more butter on top while serving, you get the picture - the flavor of butter or buttery-things should dominate.     The ingredients are near similar, and different restaurants use their spices differently, so talking about other differences will lead to a lot of disagreements."
IndianFood,35vig4,IndianPhDStudent,2,Thu May 14 04:43:26 2015 UTC,I learned the focus of makhani was the methi  (fenugreek) flavor.
IndianFood,35vig4,mldl,6,Thu May 14 20:05:47 2015 UTC,"Butter Chicken contains white butter (duh!) and (sometimes) khoya, while Tikka masala does not. In my limited experience of eating Tikka masala, it tends to have a slight amount of sweetness, while butter chicken has none. And Butter chicken is usually finished with Kasoori methi while Tikka masala is not (at least all the recipes that I've seen are not ). These variations matter because if I ordered a plate of butter chicken and I was served something that tasted like tikka masala, I would in all likelihood send it back (as would be the case with many people I know). But yes, the recipes are quite similar, and given how a lot of people tend not to follow recipes precisely, you can have variations of both that taste the same."
IndianFood,35vig4,phtark,3,Wed May 13 22:54:41 2015 UTC,"Murg makhani is a mughlai dish that was invented in the subcontinent, uses the whole chicken which marinated before being cooked in a gravy that requires a lot of tomatoes, butter, heavy cream and finished with kasoori methi.  Chicken tikka masala was invented in Birmingham to suit the English palate. It is much sweeter than murg makhani and uses boneless chicken pieces that have been grilled in a tandoor before adding to gravy."

IndianFood,35vig4,harighotra,1 point,Thu May 14 03:12:55 2015 UTC,Lots of cooks mix these dishes and different chefs have there own interpretation. But in general a tikka masala is flavoured with a paste made from cashew nuts and the chicken is marinaded in a similar marinade to tandoori chicken. This dish was created to use up left over tandoori chicken in a creamy masala to keep the dish moist. This is usually a rich orange colour.  Murgh makhani is all about making a buttery (makhan) sauce. Makhan in India is a bit like clotted cream so really rich and thick. This dish has no cashews and the chicken is added to the sauce raw to take on the creamy flavour. It's also a rich tomato red colour.
IndianFood,35vig4,phtark,2,Thu May 14 09:29:01 2015 UTC,"Theory has it though, that Butter Chicken was invented in Moti Mahal to use up left over Tandoori Chicken, so not sure if Chicken is added to the sauce raw."
IndianFood,35vig4,SteamTables,1 point,Thu May 14 20:10:18 2015 UTC,"The way my friend and I make makhani is to make a puree of almonds, masala, ginger, garlic and fry the chicken with that. Add tomato paste and cream butter after. Its great."
IndianFood,35vig4,lobster_johnson,2,Thu May 14 18:00:22 2015 UTC,"According to Heston Blumenthal, there is basically none: However, he notes that makhani has historically been used meat from the whole chicken, whereas tikka masala is always uses leg-meat.  I've seen people argue about cream, butter, different spices, etc., but I've yet to find a convincing argument, or a restaurant that makes them with any appreciable difference; throw some almonds on top and add a splash of cream, and they pretend the tikka masala is butter chicken. (Restaurants add so much butter to these gravy-based dishes that butter content can hardly be the definition.)  Considering that recipes aren't standardized, people will never stop arguing about this."

If I am really craving paneer makhani I usually make it myself nowadays - it is really easy to make but high calorie so I don't make it very often. This is the recipe I generally use but I fry the paneer in a little ghee before adding it to the gravy."
IndianFood,35vig4,samosa4me,2,Thu May 14 08:41:26 2015 UTC,I've never seen dark meat in tikka masala.
IndianFood,35vig4,nomnommish,1 point,Wed May 13 23:29:09 2015 UTC,"I always thought the biggest difference was in the way chicken is cooked. Tikka itself means that it was skewered and cooked as a kabab first (tandoori or grill), then added to the gravy. Butter chicken on the other hand, or murgh makhni, has pan fried chicken in it.  Or is that not true?"

Are these the Cardamom seeds after they are smoked?  Help and Thanks."
IndianFood,35ks0p,phtark,2,Wed May 13 18:22:26 2015 UTC,Ajwain goes nicely in an otherwise mildly flavored daal. I also like to make chapattis that are stuffed with ajwain and black pepper.   Black cumin would go well in richer dishes and most Kashmiri dishes would feature black cumin since it widely grows in Kashmir.

IndianFood,35f5qt,gulaabjamun,2,Sat May 9 22:11:46 2015 UTC,"you actually don't have to knead chapati dough very much, so i would recommend a bowl and wooden spoon or your (clean) hands.

IndianFood,35f5qt,indulgentfuel,6,Sat May 9 20:08:12 2015 UTC,I second Kitchenaid but with a caveat - it gets you 95% there. You'll still have to punch it down and form the dough ball using your hands unless you use extra water and don't mind a stickier atta dough (which you'll have to generously flour when you're rolling the roti out thus risking a more flour-y end product) if you use the mixer all the way. True atta consistency is best achieved with a combination of the mixer and hands but it does take the boring kneading part out.

That said, I'm sure that different salt mines wind up with different percentages of all the flavor compounds in black salt. Some might have darker salt, others lighter, some more sulphury, others less, etc. It might even vary year to year as the salt mines that supply the different manufacturers run through one vein and move to another.  Anyway, long story short, yeah, some black salt is gonna taste like rotten eggs. It's got lots of other interesting flavors going on in it, and it's a combination of all that that is why it's used in recipes, but--and here's the important part--if you don't like it, you don't have to use it :-D  Try reducing the percentage, or using a brand that's not as sulfur-y, or replacing it with other things you do like.

Totally agree, though I do like to try the authentic version first. Funnily enough when I get stuff with chaat masala at a restaurant the sulphur is barely noticeable. I'll ask for some masala on the side next time.   Of course, the challenge of trying an ""authentic"" version: there are likely many regional variations for the stuff, who knows what is ""authentic""."
IndianFood,355lkb,IndianPhDStudent,3,Thu May 7 21:25:43 2015 UTC,"It's a matter of personal taste. Some people just don't like the Sulphuric taste of black salt, some people do. Black salt also comes in a range from mildly bitter to very bitter, and thus it will differ from salt to salt. Go with what you like. I personally divide the salt into white and black 50-50 ratio."
IndianFood,35324n,PandorianLegend,11,Wed May 6 18:12:39 2015 UTC,"Ghee is halfway between clarified butter and beurre noisette, which means that the moisture in the milk solids has been cooked off but it hasn't yet turned brown.    If you only heat the butter for 15 to 30 minutes the moisture in the milk solids will remain.  You can skim this off or separate it otherwise, but the result will not be ghee.  In order to make ghee you must slowly simmer the butter until the moisture has been completely cooked off.  If you don't do this, the butter will not be shelf-stable and can harbor unwanted microbiology like regular butter.   Merely clarifying butter does not preserve it.  Moreover, clarified butter does not taste like ghee; and the reason is that as you slowly cook off all the moisture, it results in bits of caramelized milk which perfumes the ghee with its rich, sugary aroma.    Though this takes longer, it's totally simple.  I usually put my flame very, very low.  You may only want to use a cool pilot light, or your stove's lowest setting.  Butter goes in a fat bottomed pan, then I walk away and forget it except for intermittent checks.  The butter will melt, foam, subside.  It should just be barely bubbling, like a tired soda.  You'll see liquid milk solids separate out, and as time passes these will turn into golden brown cracklings.  When no milky liquid remains and all is a lovely, toasty golden you are finished.  Strain it.    If you are feeling extravagant, you can perfume your ghee midway through with princely spices.    It's probably a better investment to begin with good butter.  Try a Euro butter like Plugra, or if you're especially ridiculous make your own butter first from cultured heavy cream.  If, as in India you are fortunate to have some access to real dairy, use it.  The best butter I've ever tasted was in India, straight from the farm, absolutely amazing!  Having said this, I'd just buy ghee off the shelf.  Ghee is yummy, but I don't think it's essential to most Indian cooking and as a beginner it's usually not crucial to success.  Substitute oil, swirl in some butter at the end if you like."
IndianFood,35324n,nitroglider,15,Wed May 6 23:47:00 2015 UTC,"As other have mentioned, making ghee is easy. It isn't very labor intensive.  Take a deep thick bottom saucepan. I use Strauss/Irish/Costco organic unsalted butter. Place the butter in the pan, bring the heat to medium. It will star to boil in a few minutes (~15min or so). Mix it a few times. Make sure you hang out near the stove for this part. The butter will start frothing, once this happens and the froth settles, pull it off the heat.   Let is cool and filter the ghee. I make it over the weekend, the whole process took around 30 to 40 minutes.  Good luck!   Store bought Ghee works just fine too."

Re: vegetables, things like raw potatoes take the longest; carrots, cauliflower, and other ""hard"" or root veggies a little less, while smaller, softer veg like cut green beans and corn kernels take relatively little time to cook.

This one comes from the West Punjab and is called Doli Ki roti which is a fried roti like poori’s. It does take some time to prep because you have to make up the fermenting agent which they used spices for.   Boil black cardamom, 5 cloves, a tsp of poppy seeds 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 7cm piece of cassia back in about 500ml water. Cover and leave this in a warm spot for 24 hours.  Use about 1 cup of whole wheat flour and sieve the water into it making a paste that's the consistency of a thick batter. Keep this covered in a warm place for 24 hours - you should see bubbles form in the paste. This if your fermenting agent. Make up a dough with this and about 4 cups of whole wheat flour and half a cup of semolina flour. Knead with a little warm water then cover and set aside for 2 hours until it rises and doubles in size.  knock this back and make it into balls and roll out or flatten with your hands to a bout 3mm thick. These are then deep fried like poori’s.   Hope that helps :)"

I'll answer these questions as best as I'm aware since I've noticed no one else has answered yet (anyone feel free to correct me!)  1-""tandoori"" traditionally means the meat was cooked in what's known as a tandoor oven . It's a type of Indian grilling on a skewer, basically   2-""curry"" was actually a term coined when Indian food became so popular in the UK. In India, if you ask for curry they won't know what you're talking about. Curry is typically a tomato-onion based sauce seasoned with a ton of different Indian spices (tumeric, coriander, cumin, etc). If you're at a real Indian place it'll be more specified as a masala sauce, vindaloo, makhani, etc)  3-Chutney is used as a dipping sauce (think salsa) for various (usually fried) appetizers: samosas, vadas, pakoras etc. It's usually fruit based and both sweet and spicy   4-The bread you saw was naan. Other breads include roti, chipati, puri, and parathas. It's usually served as an appetizer but it's typically dunked in the sauce of your entree  5-Not much I can think of. Rice and naan is typically served at every meal  6-Basic recipes I'd say are tandoori meats, chicken tikka masala, biryani (rice), saag, korma, etc. Check out Manjula or Veg Recipes of India for some recipes :) It's really important to make sure you get your onions right over anything else when it comes to sauces. Both these sites will show you how they need to look--which is basically almost burned  7-The best way I've learned the vocab is just by looking up menus and Googling each dish I think sounds interesting. It's hard to describe the differences in things like the breads without seeing how it's made and the ingredients, etc.   Hope I helped!   edit: if you have Netflix, check out the show Good Eats. There's an episode called The Curious Case of Curry that I think will help you out too!"

IndianFood,34kf97,justabofh,4,Wed Jun 24 00:28:37 2015 UTC,"""Indian"" food is somewhat of a misnomer. There is a very wide variety of cuisines, most of which are not represented in a restaurant. Restaurant food in the west is mostly ""British"" Indian cuisine, which is somewhat representative of the northwestern parts of India/Pakistan/Afghanistan.  Tandoori is a dish cooked in a very hot clay/earthen oven, called a tandoor. A tandoor cooks at around 500C,  and quite fast.  A ""curry"" in India would be a stew of some sort, in the west it's a tomato/onion sauce.  A chutney is a dip. Chutneys may be mild (coconut based), hot (green or red peppers being a dominant ingredient), or sweet (fruit based).  A bread thing is rather hard to take a guess at, but you could be looking at a naan (leavened flatbread) or a roti (unleavened flatbread). Other common varieties of wheat based breads are chapati, phulka (tava roti), parantha and kulcha. Indians tend to use bread as a spoon, rather than as something to be eaten by itself.  Food etiquette? Not really.   Food pairings? Not really. Indian food celebrates complexity. There are some dishes Indians won't usually eat together, but that's usually because they are from different regional cuisines rather than not going well together.  If you are looking at common recipes, I would suggest starting off with books by Julie Sahni or Madhur Jaffery. They are aimed at westerners cooking Indian style food, rather than Indians teaching other Indians.  You will need to stock up on spices. http://www.ecurry.com/blog/indian/indian-kitchen-basics/the-most-commonly-used-indian-spices/ is a good list."
IndianFood,34kf97,musicmuse1122,2,Sat May 2 13:40:42 2015 UTC,"to add to the confusion around curry:  In Hindi the word for curry leaves is ""kadi-pattha"" where the d in kadi is rolled to sound like curry.  In Tamil the word ""kari (pronounced like curry with a rolled r) actually means black, or sooty, or culinarily something stir-fried and served dry (no gravy involved, it's often a vegetable blackened around the edges or a charred meat).  So, when I go back to my parents' house, we might have potato curry at dinner but it's really diced stir-fried potato with various spices.  Then the next day I might buy curry leaves at the store to make a north Indian gravy.  Then we might decide not to cook and will go out to eat Thai curry...  the word curry is literally the worst..."

IndianFood,34kf97,H20Buffalo,2,Sat May 2 18:43:09 2015 UTC,"Most Indian/Pakistani households don't serve bread and rice at every meal, it's usually just one or the other (unless there's a feast or guests over in which case, every dish under the sun is probably accounted for).  Certain salan (dishes...it's kind of a blanket term, but I'm not sure what regions use it over others) are typically eaten with a bread rather than a rice. Usually these are the drier kinds such as bhindi tori (okra, aka ladyfingers), but not always as drier chana masala (chickpeas in spices) are sometimes had with rice, as well.  There's really nothing against mixing foods. I basically mix everything and it's delicious.  As others have said, chutneys are basically sauces (some of my relatives call ketchup tomato chutney and barbecue sauce ""mithi chutney"" [sweet chutney]). Aside from dipping pakoras and samosas into it, you can pour some over rice or dunk your bread in it. It just adds flavor, if that's the flavor you feel like having.   Also, the bread is typically torn off with your hands, turned into a little scoop for the curries and delivered to your mouth. I'll see if I can find a video somewhere.   Hope that was helpful!"

IndianFood,34idee,reeblebeeble,11,Fri May 1 12:25:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying there is one right way, but I'm Indian and it ruins the experience for me when this happens too.   What  I do while cooking is go one of two ways - dry roast and grind spices to a very fine powder or leave them whole and large and pick them out before serving.  If it's just my husband and I, I may leave them whole but definitely big enough to pick them out.   Back when I was really small, or when I visit really small Street vendors in India, I've seen them leave in whole spices but all the good restaurants I go to normal serve silky smooth sauces."
IndianFood,34idee,princesspulse,2,Fri May 1 12:32:22 2015 UTC,"Ah well, good to know it's not just me. It's a shame because it was such a beautiful curry otherwise, and every other dish I've had from that restaurant has been perfection."
IndianFood,34idee,KireiBlossom,5,Fri May 1 12:52:49 2015 UTC,"In authentic Indian food, is it considered enjoyable / tasty to get bits of whole spice in your mouth?   No, it's actually considered ""didn't you look carefully before you put that bite in your mouth?"":)   While restaurants may use powdered form of spices more, home cooked food usually tends to leave out the whole spices as they are. When eating, you can pick them out if they end up in your plate. If you accidentally find it in your mouth, you aren't required to swallow the piece of whole peppercorn or clove, but remove it."
IndianFood,34idee,KireiBlossom,3,Fri May 1 14:23:58 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about quite small pieces, too small and too many to be practical to pick out, but big enough to be noticeable and give you a burst of overwhelming flavour.

IndianFood,34idee,ManfredH,3,Fri May 1 14:38:03 2015 UTC,"I guess it can happen in super busy kitchens of popular restaurants where chefs need to prepare 2-3 dishes simultaneously.   It can also occur if the blades of their grinder are not sharp enough, or may be they're using large sized equipment to grind those small spices.  And, my final guess is that the chef may have forgotten to sieve the Makhani gravy for your Paneer Masala.   So, it does seem like a kitchen error. The authentic Paneer Masala should taste smooth and silky, though its other variation - Paneer Kadai - can have some roughly ground spices.   I hope it helps. :)"

Lay it out on a few paper towels for a while before you cut it up, it'll help absorb some of the excess water. If you are using it in a curry or something that needs to cook for a while, I would add it in about halfway through. If you're doing a stirfry or something like that, I like to brown my tofu in some oil first to give it a little bite.   Chickpeas would make a good chana masala, and lentils I love in soup. How about a hearty lentil vegetable stew/soup? Or maybe coconut lentil curry. Coconut milk in anything is the best. If you can't get your hands on indian spices, it'll be tough, as there aren't a lot of western analogs. How about some homemade bread/naan? That can turn anything into a good meal!"

IndianFood,34fy8p,SabashChandraBose,2,Thu Apr 30 22:37:10 2015 UTC,"As a chef, that's pretty much sacrilege lol. Onion goes in everything!   Stock up on fresh ginger, garlic, and chilies! Jalepenos are pretty mild if you take out the seeds. Stir fries and curries are a good way to go. I just noticed it said no coconut...are they dairy free as well? Heavy cream is just as good in a curry. Maybe turn those chickpeas into some hummus and do a veggie wrap/sandwich one day? If you're good with baking, make some pizza dough and saute some different veggies for toppings."

IndianFood,340dng,2Cuil4School,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:30:55 2015 UTC,"This can vary based on the spice, but generally, any spice that gets burnt  is gonna lend a very strong bitter flavor to the dish (ditto for the onions, garlic, and/or ginger) that's almost impossible to mask.  If dry roasting, pull once it becomes fragrant/changes slightly in color. If frying, I wouldn't leave spices in hot oil by themselves longer than 15-20 seconds in my big steel pot; they tend to burn otherwise (heck, I've burn the protein particles in butter in under 45s in that pan!)."

IndianFood,33zp7s,2Cuil4School,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:26:13 2015 UTC,Thank you. Can you recommend to me any brands of wet grinder? I'm looking at a Preethi right now. What are good brands in Indian kitchen appliances?
IndianFood,33zp7s,2Cuil4School,2,Mon Apr 27 05:39:53 2015 UTC,"The Preethis on sale on, for instance, Amazon, are generally not the old-fashioned stone grinders; they use fixed or removable blades in jars, much like a more common blender.  The big differences I see are that these devices tend to have much higher wattages for their motors and often offer multiple blade types suited for different tasks. This allows them to, for instance, easily pulverize mostly dry mixtures (e.g., nuts or fried spices or even just garlic and ginger) that cheap blenders couldn't handle and most food processor bowls are just too big for.  So, my crummy $30 Walmart blender can't really get the right texture for dosas (grinding up soaked rice and urad dal with a small amount of water) without getting hot and hurting the batter (might kill the microbes that cause the fermentation if they come into contact with the hot blades). On the other hand, my relatively cheap ($100) Preethi Eco Twin can blend that mixture to a better texture in a quarter of the time (I often have to blend the rice in a regular blender for 2 minutes; the Preethi finishes it in 30 seconds).  I think Preethi is good, but I'd consider one of the higher-tier models. The sealing gaskets on the white ""flexi lids"" (that make the blending jars smaller so that reduced quantities of ingredients don't splatter everywhere and not really blend up) are just cheap plastic instead of real rubber on the Eco Twin I bought, so that plastic is now breaking down, ruining the ""seal"" on the Flexi Lids. The normal plastic ""dome"" lids that extend up off of the jar have rubber gaskets and are holding up MUCH better."
IndianFood,33zp7s,2Cuil4School,2,Thu Apr 30 15:59:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for writing all this up! I was looking at the Eco Twin models, and they are within my budget.

IndianFood,33vsop,matts2,2,Sun Apr 26 04:17:59 2015 UTC,"Greek yoghurt tends to be more concentrated and higher fat, so it will generally better. Most Indian recipes will call for ""hung curd"" so Greek is the same thing. The idea is that the increased amount of milk solids might caramelize slightly at high heat, producing better flavour. This is why some take out joints add a small bit of grated cheese to chicken marinades to get that ""burnt cheese"" flavour.   What you can do is just strain some yoghurt through cheesecloth, but either way, it's not a huge deal. The primary function of the yoghurt is to spread the marinade and to tenderize the meat with its acidic content."

Also, if I remember it correctly then it's a part of panch-puran that forms the basis of a lot of Bengali dishes.  I am not too sure about shahi jeera, but believe that it could be used in place of regular for an additional kick, as it is slightly stronger in flavor  Kasoori methi can be used to add some flavor to any dry vegetable dish, such as mixed vegetable or jeera aloo. It can also be used in dishes with light gravy such as jalfarezi or koftas.  I wouldn't really call tej patta, amchoor or hing as more exotic spices, in fact they are a part of my regular everyday cooking much more than the ones mentioned above. Amchoor is a spice that I use regularly to add some sourness to the dish. Just add a bit at the end, after to turn of the heat but the dish is still hot, like you might use a lemon. Tej patta can also be easily used in any dish to add some flavor and to give it a more 'refined' look. Just add it at the time of sautéing, along with the jeera. Hing is excellent to be used in dals, but can be used in other meat/ veggie dishes. It's used by many in place of garlic and is known to be an anti-flatulent digestive aid."

I just meant that these spices are easier to use in regular cooking, though being Indian I don't think any of the spices are 'exotic' :) Hmmm.. Kasoori methi has a very strong flavor and used in dried form unlike coriander. So you have to be selective where you would use it. Just a little goes a long way, so I would advice you on using a light hand. Also, the best way use it is to put in in your palm, rub them together to crush the leaves a bit and then add to the dish.

And while doing low carb, i found Indian to be one of the easiest. Could be because I am a vegetarian, so very few other cuisines( in my limited knowledge) gave me the option to have proteins and other nutrients in so many different ways.  As for the original question. I do think Indian food is very easy to make 'free from' but then again, I grew up with this food, so I know where to make the modifications.

Another possibility:  Does your rice at home have the fragrance you're looking for, right when you buy it, but not later?    Jasmine or basmati rice has a subtle but definite natural (in that it comes from the rice, it isn't some other spice or food ingredient that's added) scent to it.  If you buy high quality fragrant rice (such as jasmine or basmati) that's been stored in an airtight container (like a sealed plastic bag), it will have a delicious aroma that you can preserve for a while by keeping it in an airtight container.  But if you keep it in a non-airtight container (like a mesh bag or an open bin), it will lose that fragrance pretty quickly (within days)."

I never use a pressure cooker, either a rice cooker or boiling it in a open pan. I find that the using a pressure cooker makes it harder to keep grains separated and the rice is not as fluffy."

There are many ways to infuse a bit of aroma into the rice, cumin seeds, cassia bark, saffron, cardamom, cloves all work beautifully in rice. If you can get your hands on some black cardamom that gives a wonderful smokey earthiness that’s just wonderful.   The simplest recipe to try first would be jeera chaul or cumin rice. Temper your cumin seeds in some oil before adding the washed rice. Coat the rice with the oil then add twice the amount of water to rice and bringit to the boil. Reduce the heat to the lowest setting and cook for 12 minutes - http://www.harighotra.co.uk/indian-recipes/sides/jeera-chaul You can then try other spice combinations such as cardamom and cloves, cassia and black cardamom, you can also add vegetables like mushrooms, peas etc."
IndianFood,32txu2,gator_joker,1 point,Thu Apr 23 10:23:47 2015 UTC,Is there  difference  between normal cardamon pods and black cardamon? never heard of black cardamon before
IndianFood,32txu2,boredg,2,Thu Apr 23 16:32:02 2015 UTC,By normal cardamom pods are you thinking green cardamom? If that's the case green cardamom pods are used to sweeten dishes (and are used in dessert dishes) and black cardamom is used for a more pungent flavour. Black cardamom pods are often dried over a fire pit giving them a smokey flavour - and you more commonly use the seeds of the black cardamom pods rather then green pods where you can pop in the whole pod. Does that make sense?

Little things, if you can use ghee instead of butter it will provide a more traditional taste, be sure to use full fat for the yogurt (creme fraiche or sour cream are even better!).  Simmering is important to have the flavors mingle and when toasting your spices be careful about temperature and time because you can burn them which imparts bitter flavor.

IndianFood,32tg16,forthelulzac,3,Thu Apr 16 18:20:13 2015 UTC,"One thing that I've found useful is to use tomato puree. It cuts down on the need for cream, and adds a good consistency."
IndianFood,32tg16,immilaw,3,Thu Apr 16 20:49:29 2015 UTC,"I am not a huge fan of the recipe in your post.  I don't like using canned tomatoes, and I don't like the consistency of her dish.  She needs to brown the onions more too.  This is how I make it and it has turned out pretty well in my opinion and tastes very restaurant-like.   Toast whole cloves, star anise, cardamom pods and a stick of cinnamon in butter until fragrant, usually a couple minutes. Add chopped onions, ginger and garlic to the same pan and brown well.  Usually about 15 min on a med-low flame with lots of stirring to prevent burning.  Adding a bit of salt will speed up this process. Add chopped fresh tomatoes to the pan and cook down until it's thick and you can see a thin layer of oil/butter on the side of the pan. Usually takes me 20-25 min. Transfer the contents of the pan (fish out the whole spices if need be) into a blender and blend into a smooth sauce. Transfer the sauce back into the pan and add Kashmiri red chili powder (for the color and heat), garam masala, turmeric, cumin powder, coriander powder, salt and some sugar to the sauce and simmer for 5-10 min. Add paneer (that has been grilled or pan fried) to the sauce and let it warm through, about 2-3min. Turn off the stove, add cream or yogurt (I prefer yogurt for regular cooking and cream when is company is over), dried methi leaves and chopped fresh cilantro.  Stir and keep warm until you serve.

IndianFood,32h0k1,Yellowbenzene,4,Mon Apr 13 18:59:47 2015 UTC,"you are trying too hard (sorry).   you need older rice - buy a 20# bag from the indian grocery and hide it somewhere in your house for a while.  meanwhile, boil about twice as much water as the amount of dry uncooked rice you are planning to make. rinse the rice a couple times until the water runs off mostly clear. add the rinsed rice into the boiling water and let it cook until the grains are no longer floating around but have expanded.  there may be some foam on the top layer.  if you have the water proportion right (unfortunately this is an eyeballing situation as it varies between rice crops) there will be some starchy bubbling on the edges and drier rice in the middle of the pot. at this point some people like to drain off the rice into a colander and rinse with hot water to get all the starch off (this makes the rice very un-sticky - sorry, i only know the Tamil word for this concept, as I've never tried to explain cooking rice in English) - those folks usually start with more water in the pot to get the rice out easier. i prefer rice un-rinsed, so I just let it sit in the pot.  if you want to make pilaf, leave the pot uncovered so the rice dries out in the air or do the colander-draining method and let the rice air dry a little. stir-fry/toast all the spices you want in the rice in a saute pan, add in the rice, stir (not too much) = pulao   EDIT: specifically, the absorption method will make wallpaper paste."

Edit: adding in boiling water is not necessary but it speed up the cooking process
IndianFood,32h0k1,lobster_johnson,3,Mon Jun 22 04:11:30 2015 UTC,"I use Julie Sahni's recipe from Classic Indian Cooking. It's an old, unassuming book without photos, but it's one of the best.  Her method is, simplified (and after memory):  Start by rinsing, then leaving the rice in its water for 20-40 minutes.  Put the rice and starchy water in a pan (add more water if necessary; there needs to be ample amounts so it doesn't evaporate too early).  Add salt and a tablespoon of neutral cooking oil such as sunflower.  Bring to boil, stirring occasionally. When it starts to bubble, set a timer for 3 minutes. No need to stir at this point.  After 3 minutes, take pot off stove, dump contents in a fine sieve, and rinse I cold water (best if you have an aerator-type spray nozzle on your faucet) for about five seconds. This will stop the outside from cooking, and will rinse off some more starch.  Put back in stove, fluff a bit. Add a metal spacer and turn on the lowest heat setting. Let heat for about five minutes. Initially the rice will be wet; gradually it will dry.  When done, fluff and leave to rest for a couple more minutes.  The important parts here are the oil, which helps to coat the rice grains, and secondly to stop the rice from overcooking. The result is rice that doesn't stick, but has a clearly defined shape. The test is to see how a pile of rice behaves if you use a fork to sift through it. Overlooked rice will stick together, perfectly dry, fluffy rice will tumble and roll.  You can definitely combine this method with the pilau style you describe. Keep the starchy water around from when you rinsed it, though (scientifically, I'm not quite sure why, it might make no different, to be honest).  As others point out, a good rice cooker will let you accomplish the same thing (I don't cook enough rice myself to justify the purchase of yet another kitchen gadget). The important thing a rice cooker does is let the rice rest while under moderate heat."

IndianFood,32h0k1,harighotra,3,Mon Apr 13 19:19:13 2015 UTC,A rice cooker is an easy way to go about it if you don't have a lot of time. I have learnt the way to get nice dry rice is to find out he exact water ratio. I put in 3 and 1/5th cup water for 2 cups of rice and it works for me. I am sure this ratio would be different for different varieties of rice.
IndianFood,32h0k1,harighotra,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:28:45 2015 UTC,This is my basic plain Basmati rice - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feavRliVGvQ My tip would be to wash the rice till it runs clear before cooking. Hope that helps

IndianFood,32emst,I8MyHomework,4,Mon Apr 13 04:04:51 2015 UTC,"Hing is normally sold in two forms - powdered (which is easily diluted with rice flour/tumeric) and crystals of the actual latex. Obviously, the latter is better as it is just Hing and nothing else - but if you can only find the former, it's an acceptable substitute. However, it really lacks the pungency of the pure latex."

IndianFood,32emst,l0z,2,Mon Apr 13 12:03:03 2015 UTC,"There is no difference in flavor. There are some other stuff that get added to make the hing mix, the hing you have, may have some turmeric in it."
IndianFood,32emst,_pb_,2,Mon Apr 13 04:10:58 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for that ! So I should probably scale down the turmeric if I use the yellow hing.
IndianFood,32emst,falicor,3,Mon Apr 13 04:44:17 2015 UTC,I don't think it matters. You don't use enough to make much of a difference in color if using only the hing.   I would just use it as listed in the recipe or whatever you are doing
IndianFood,32emst,despardesi,2,Mon Apr 13 13:03:24 2015 UTC,"Hing is used for flavor, not color. It is very pungent, and you'd use 1/16th of a tsp usually, if not less.   Turmeric is used for color. Often I use 1/4 tsp of turmeric. It does have a slight odor, but nowhere close to hing."
IndianFood,32emst,despardesi,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for sharing.   I'm not sure about the strength of haldi vs hing, but I've seen that if I add even half a teaspoon of haldi more than needed, you can really taste it in the dish (and it's not too pleasant).  Any way, guess experimentation is the only way to find out !"
IndianFood,32d5e9,charisma_blackhole,7,Sun Apr 12 20:14:09 2015 UTC,"In most cases, those are just garnishes to make the dish restaurant - like. They aren't essential for everyday meals. I start off sautéing my aromatics in a little vegetable oil and avoid all of those. You'd be surprised how good and LIGHT the dishes taste when the real flavor of the ingredients shines without being masked by all the heaviness.   Also you can use low fat yogurt instead of cream in many dishes."
IndianFood,32d5e9,princesspulse,2,Sun Apr 12 23:09:10 2015 UTC,"This is also how I cook,  and I absolutely prefer it to using tons of ghee. Indian yogurt (dahi) is a nice way to add creaminess to (Northern Indian) dishes, even if you just serve it on the side plain or as a raita."
IndianFood,32d5e9,vanillamasala,2,Mon Apr 13 00:23:31 2015 UTC,"I always fry off the spices in a lot less oil than called for, I can get away with half or one  tbsp of oil and roll the pan to the side so the oil pools to form a bath for whole spices. A non stick pan will really help reduce the oil needed for cooking down onions and veg.  As overs have said use yogurt instead of cream.   For south Indian curries I use powdered coconut milk (10g for one cup water  = about 70 cals ) or unsweetened soy milk (if using to finish off at the end, if you boil it it may curdle! ) instead of canned coconut milk.   I have lightened up many recipes like this and I really don't miss cream and ghee and really enjoy the spices and vegetables."

IndianFood,32d5e9,justabofh,2,Mon Apr 13 03:48:36 2015 UTC,"Most Indian homemade food is not laced with ghee / cream / coconut milk. Just look for any Indian vegetarian recipe, especially Daal with rice.  In case you do want to cook up a fancy Indian dish without making it unhealthy, I usually replace cream with a thick almond paste (use skinless almonds). It adds richness without taxing your system and clogging your arteries. All you need to do is soak and peel almonds and put them in a food processor with some water."
IndianFood,32d5e9,justabofh,1 point,Mon Apr 13 04:11:04 2015 UTC,"Cooking subcontinental food will usually involve frying spices. What you need to remember is that you need just enough oil to fry the spices, not the huge amount present in restaurant food.  I cook with a teaspoon (or two) of ghee or vegetable oil. Tilt the pan at the beginning if you need to, so you can get a somewhat deep layer of fat/oil for frying the spices, but not actually using a lot of it."

IndianFood,32b728,despardesi,6,Sun Apr 12 06:24:04 2015 UTC,"most indian recipes tend not to be designed around a single ingredient. the good thing is, that means that you can use non-indian ingredients in a lot of dishes as long as you have a good feel for how the taste of the new vegetable will interact with the rest of the dish. for instance, you can use butternut squash as a straight substitute for pumpkin in any recipe (e.g. pumpkin kootu), but you can also just add it to an avial and it will blend in very well with the other vegetables. some other ideas: brussels sprouts would be good in sambar, asparagus would make a great main ingredient (see this for example), and if you google ""indian style broccoli"" you'll find lots of recipes, but i've personally felt broccoli does not really go to well with indian spices."

IndianFood,31auu3,roxus,9,Fri Apr 3 14:05:19 2015 UTC,"Enjoy! A buffet gives you a quick introduction to a variety of food from India.  Buffet food is never high-class, but at the same time it's not going to be scorchingly spicy either (its purpose is to get to back for dinner off the more pricey a la carte menu). If you're in the USA, there seems to be a domination of northern Indian food, but the buffet might have some other regions represented.  Chicken, the constant spinach/cheese dish, and lentils on a bed of rice are what you might enjoy -- nothing too exotic, but gives you a basic introduction to the seasonings used.  Ask for a mango (or salty if you like that) lassi drink -- it's soothing to the stomach.  Dessert of fruit is good too.

You'll probably be able to handle rice, and worst case, you won't waste anything too expensive if you hate it Naan is amazing. It's just bread - usually with a little butter on it. Cannot go wrong. Worst case, you won't be starving afterward Try a little bit of a few different things from the buffet. It'll help you blend in by having a full plate, but your trick is it's mostly rice and bread There's usually a regular little salad portion of the buffet. Nothing new here. It's a good space filler if you absolutely hate the indian food Easy intro: Matar paneer (peas and cheese cubes in a red sauce) is like the mac & cheese of Indian food. Really easy to make it yummy. Total comfort food. (p.s. it's nothing like mac & cheese) You won't hate it. Indian food is SO DIFFERENT from American food, but it's so freaking delicious. Don't even worry"
IndianFood,31auu3,GIS-Rockstar,3,Fri Apr 3 16:23:57 2015 UTC,Try the daals.. They will be relatively mild. Since it's a buffet you'll have to option to try a really tiny bit of the different curries before you pick one. There will also definitely be options with yogurt based sauces. Those will also be mild.

My favorites were the butter chicken and Chicken tika massalla.  The other names I can't remember, but one was a small mushroom fritter and the one I loved the most was a red chicken dish. I believe it was put in some kind of smoker.  In all, I can not wait to go back.  On a side note, I did try a desert that was aweful.  Actually made me gag.  It was a little round sweet cake thing.  Was like eating a sponge.  I never want that again.  Thanks everyone for the advice."
IndianFood,31auu3,blacknight75,2,Sat Apr 4 13:32:09 2015 UTC,"The red chicken was most likely tandoori chicken.   The desert was most likely gulab jamun.

Seriously, ask a waiter to explain what's in each dish they will. Get some yogurt if the food is too spicy, if they don't have it on the buffet just ask for it since it's very common for Indian people to have some with their meal."
IndianFood,31auu3,crapshack,1 point,Fri Apr 3 15:31:30 2015 UTC,"Chicken tika massalla/butter chicken shouldn't be too spicy (the former is actually a British dish). Everything malai has cream in it so should be less spicy. Kashmiri or Madras dishes are most probably also creamy dishes with low heat and sweet. Vindaloo should be the most spicy, so maybe avoid if you can't take it. Saag Panneer/Palak paneer is not spicy at all, creamy homemade cheese with spinaches.  Often dalh (lentils soup) are not too spicy. Also try to get some youghurt/curds to diffuse the heat. If it's not available maybe you can get some raita (mix of youghurt and cucumber/tomato/lemon)."

IndianFood,311pii,harighotra,3,Thu Apr 2 01:56:25 2015 UTC,"You'll find that the best recipes tend to use whole spices, fried in oil. However, it is a good idea to have some ground garam masala ready to go, for quick curry making, or perhaps to sprinkle on a nearly-finished dish for some extra flair. Instead of making a curry powder, I'd suggest having a couple powders:  Black cumin powder  Coriander seed powder  A powdered blend of cinnamon, green cardamom, clove, and dried tejpat leaf  Roast the spices in a dry pan and allow to cool before grinding to wake them up. If you prefer a sharper flavor, ignore this step."
IndianFood,311pii,kravingsblog,1 point,Thu Apr 2 02:38:32 2015 UTC,It's called a mix powder and it's very versatile. You'll only need to use a little less than a tablespoon per serve. Best to fry it in the oil just after adding garlic and ginger paste.  Recipe:  2 tablespoon mild curry powder  2 tablespoon Paprika powder  2 tablespoon Cumin powder  1 tablespoon Garam Masala powder  2 tablespoon Coriander powder  3 tablespoon Turmeric powder  Mix well.

IndianFood,30w57e,I8MyHomework,2,Tue Mar 31 04:39:33 2015 UTC,The reason I use whole spices is because they keep fresher for longer and they give a more aromatic fragrance to dishes. I tend to grind my own spices as and when I need them too. I think in your case it’s more important that you look after your personal well being and also make things easy for yourself in the kitchen so it’s probably better to use ground spices for all the food your prepare. What I would suggest is that if you are able to digest ground spices without any issues that you buy them whole and grind them yourself at home so you get the best of both worlds.
IndianFood,30w57e,harighotra,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:36:10 2015 UTC,"There will be a slight change in aroma, as the whole seeds be stronger, there would be negligible change in the taste though.   To get around this conundrum easily and to get best results, just invest in a small coffee grinder, lightly roast as much whole spices as the recipe calls for, and then grind them to a fine powder, add to your recipe. I usually follow this method in any case unless whole spices are a must (e.g. a biriyani)"
IndianFood,30w57e,kartoos,2,Tue Mar 31 08:31:26 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks so much for your response. I've tried this method before, and the problem was it did not grind the spices finely enough, so it was still large enough to cause irritation in my gut. Do you reckon I should purchase a more expensive grinder? I tried to use a pestle-and mortar as well and did not work out too good either."
IndianFood,30w57e,kartoos,1 point,Tue Mar 31 10:07:17 2015 UTC,"Hmm, another method you can borrow from French cuisine is to use a bouquet garni for the whole spices where required, and use commercially powdered spices when and if required.   Just use a fine cheese cloth so the whole spies don't float out, I have used this method for Kashmiri curry recipes made in milk, where I didn't walk to disturb the creamy light texture with floating pieces of spices, the method works well and makes for a very nice and cleanly textured curries.   This won't be that useful in a non-curry dish of course, use commercial ground spices there."

To be fair, they never did extensive human testing; just animal, and it took very high doses of the toxic component to express any negative effects.  If you're eating a couple of tablespoons a week, spread out through a gallon of curry each time, the chances of you being harmed by it are low (for instance, canola oil contains a much smaller percentage of the offending substance and people consume that stuff by the bucketload sometimes!).  If you want, you can sub in a very small amount of actual mustard seeds in a recipe, but I find the flavor's not really the same. It's a lot more subtle from the oil, IMO.

I'm pretty sure he told the guy that the patties were made with Chana dal. I have to think that the dal is maybe a little undercooked.   Then once cool they probably put the dal with some salt, pepper and other spices (garam masala? Chat masala? Chili and amchoor powder? Lots of possibilities) and some maybe some sort of binding agent to hold the patties together and pop that in a food processor and give it a few quick pulses. Then it looks like he dipped the patties in the beaten eggs before cooking it on the griddle.   The only thing that struck me as odd was his answer when asked what he was topping the bread and patties with.  It looked to me like shredded lettuce but he said it was onion and cauliflower.  At least that's what I thought I heard.  Onions make sense.  Cauliflower on the other hand struck me as odd.  Especially if it was raw.

I suggest a one pan thing where you get your curry ingredients going nice and toasty, throw the gobi in there get a little color on it, add the tomato paste, caramelize, cut the heat and then add the yogurt and bring it all to a simmer and let it go until the gobi is desired tenderness.  Cooking the the gobi this way will allow it to properly absorb the curry flavor and have all flavors marry very nicely.  It's one of my favorite Indian  dishes!"

IndianFood,30bfup,i_saw_nothing,8,Thu Mar 26 00:29:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this!  I love aloo gobi, and never considered a gobi masala.  These instructions look exhausting though.  Not sure about the cauliflower preparation though - they mention boiling the water and letting the florets sit in there for 15-20 minutes.  That'll make cauliflower mush.  Ironically, they also call it ""blanched"" later in the recipe, and this is far from blanched.  Blanching is cooking for a minute or two, then IMMEDIATELY cooling it in an ice bath to stop the cooking process.  I's imagine that'll provide MUCH better results for this recipe.  I've made chicken tikka masala in the slow cooker, so I figure I could use that sauce recipe, but with blanched gobi instead.  Thanks for the idea.  My kid is a HUGE fan of cauliflower, but wasn't crazy about the time I took her out for Indian.  I could make this at home and maybe win her over.  Thanks!"

IndianFood,2zvd6m,boroniaboys,3,Sun Mar 22 11:02:22 2015 UTC,"When the recipe says the balls must be 50% paneer, they are not joking. Last time I did this recipe with friends, they insisted to use more potatoes and the results was pretty disappointing, far too soft nearly mushy.  Also it can be done with Tofu but more 60% tofu, or less tofu and a little bit of tapioca starch. If you want a good recipe you cannot fail with Manjula's version. She won't use oignons or garlic, cause she's jain, but feel free to add them yourself.  I am also looking for a malai kofte recipe, but visually it was stuffed tomatoes with a kofta inside. I cannot find that recipe anywhere."
IndianFood,2zvd6m,andr386,2,Sun Mar 22 11:24:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the proportion. A lot of recipes im finding arent so specific about the amount of potatoes. 2 large potatoes? 3 medium? What this means can vary a lot so a weight or even volumetric measurements of the mashed potatoes would be appreciated.  Didn't know what jain meant so i looked it up? From my understanding, jain excludes anything that grows underground from your diet. But Manjula uses potatoes?"

It's pretty interesting stuff, however, I have some doubts about the categorization and the general cooking knowledge of the researchers.   Among the top ten ingredients whose presence bias flavor sharing pattern of the Indian cuisine towards negative pairing, nine were spices: cayenne, green bell pepper, coriander, garam masala, tamarind, ginger garlic paste, ginger, clove, and cinnamon   Putting green bell pepper (green chili?), tamarind, ginger and garlic while mentioning ginger twice seems kinda odd to me.   Also a lot of the ingredients are radically differently used in Indian cuisine than in Western cooking, which may also lead to a misunderstanding in flavor profiles.

The wet grinder is a real work horse and I use it every couple  days.   The main advantage is the wet grinder handles large volumes of food.

So far I have used it to make horse radish sauce,  ginger-garlic paste,  sarson ka saag,  various curry pastes and chocolate sauce.  I bought mine used on EBay for less than $100.

IndianFood,2zacmi,Yellowbenzene,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:18:53 2015 UTC,"I've been very happy with my Preethi Eco Twin (available on Amazon) so far. I will say that even the smallest jar with the downsizing inverted lid is still a little big for very small quantities of spices (they tend to just sort of splay out onto the sides pretty quickly), but anything over a tablespoon or two is usually alright.  I'm a little hesitant about throwing very large, hard spices (e.g., nutmegs, dried turmeric, even big cassia cinnamon bark) into it with the normal plastic lid. I broke the plastic lid of my little old Coffee grinder (from a defunct brand many years old) with that stuff :(. The ""downsizing"" lid on the Preethi is rubber, I think (it's kinda hard though), so maybe it will be safe.  The benefit is that it's also great fur chutneys, wet-dry pastes, and things like idly/dosa batter. The main 1.5 liter jar is pretty sizable for most purposes, but they recommend not running a ton of heavier things like wet urad dal through it--work in batches. You need some heavy duty industrial equipment (or one of those awesome spinning grinding-stone machines) to handle that sort of stuff more than a cup or so at a time.

Add the ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes more, then add the chilies and cook another 2 minutes.  Stir in the salt and curry powder (you can use 1/2 tsp Turmeric, 1 tsp Cumin Powder, 1 Coriander Powder, and 1/2 tsp Red Chili Powder instead) and stir it in for about 30 seconds.  Add in the tomatoes and--if it's looking a little dry and starting to stick to the pan--about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of water. Cook 8-10 minutes until the tomatoes are softened noticeably. Add in the dal and its cooking water and heat everything through--about 5 minutes at a simmer.  Stir in the cilantro and garam masala and serve hot.

IndianFood,2z42dy,mattkenny,1 point,Sun Mar 15 12:44:24 2015 UTC,"Palak paneer and saag are two separate dishes as such. Saag is more of mustard leaf with spinach than just plain spinach. Having said that I know how to make sarson ka saag. Not sure of the lamb (maybe cook it separately and just add it in the end to the saag).  What we do is- in a big vessel add tomatoes, onion, garlic, ginger, green chillies, salt, turmeric powder, chilli powder and a tbsp or 2 of besan. Pour a glass of water, cover and cook till everything is cooked. Cool this and grind it to a paste. In another vessel give ghee ka tadka and add to the saag made and cook for a few more minutes.  Fresh produce is always good while making something like saag. It gives a stronger taste. Hope this helps!"

Put the masala in a small saucepan with 1 cup of water and 1 cup of milk and bring it to a boil.

Personally I steer away from pepper and I prefer to use whole spices that have been bruised rather then a masala. The spices are added to water and as it boils with the tea leaves the tea doesn’t have a powdery taste you just get the spices infusing into the tea and then they are just sieved out.   Also I would always use fennel seeds in my Chai. http://www.harighotra.co.uk/indian-recipes/drinks/sweet-chai-indian-tea  My fav blend would be: For 4 cups of tea 3 cardamom, bruised 2 cloves, bruised 1 tsp fennel seeds"

IndianFood,2yxp4a,dontbesuchajerk,6,Fri Mar 13 18:29:12 2015 UTC,"Slight to moderate darkening of color is good. Since they're sitting in blazing hot oil, keeping the heat on till they're significantly darker (which isn't really bad) will lead to them burning in the residual heat. For urad dal (skinless for this purpose), you're looking for a darkish golden shade, while chana can probably go most of the way to light brown without being in danger of subsequent burning.   The texture will be crunchy, but not teeth breaking. I usually only use chana in something that'll get a moist ingredient added at some point (e.g., cooking it at the beginning of making potato sabzi, which eventually adds sliced onions and boiled, chopped potatoes that both give off a little moisture) to soften it slightly (even split chana dals might be noticeable in a way some would find unpleasant if just straight up fried briefly, although some recipes will call for this--it's personal preference at that point)."

The spices I use are a curry powder which has tumeric, corriander, cumin, and cardoman. A pumpkin spice which is cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice and red pepper flake.  *Chana masala:   2 large cans of chickpeas 1 large can diced tomatos 1 yellow onion, diced 5 cloves of garlic, diced A 1 inch piece of ginger, grated Some chopped fresh cilantro/corriander (I used a bunch between all three dishes)  In a large pot bring 3 tbls oil to heat, add onion, garlic, and ginger (when I make these three dishes I actually prepare two diced onions, a whole bulb diced garlic and a nice chunk grated ginger first, combine them in a large bowl and put aside)  After about a minute of stirring (never burn garlic!) Add the spices, curry, allspice, red pepper to taste, a few dashes salt and pepper. Stir and enjoy the first whiff of fragrance. Add the tomatoes, and cans of chickpeas and chopped cilantro.  Put on a back burner on medium high for 30 minutes while preparing other dishes.  I let this mixture sit uncovered until it begins sticking to the bottom and ghe water cooks out, i then let it sit off the heat until you can stir it and the brown bits on bottom come up.   *Saag Paneer.      Two boxes chopped frozen spinach (i tried fresh before, I like this consistency better) I can not make paneer at home, I tried and was unsucessful.  I instead buy a small block of spanish cheese called queso blanco thats popular. I use a large fry pan, heat 3 tbls oil, add diced onion, diced garlic, grated ginger, then add spices like in previous dish.  Cut the cheese into cubes.  Fry the cheese on one side.   Remove the cheese.  I like the spices in this dish to become a little more brown then the others to compliment the spinach.  Add the spinach, let the water cook out and the spincah brown on one side the toss.  Add the cheese back in.  Some diced cilantro, Cover and set aside off heat.     *Baingan Bharta   I use two large baingans that are light when picked up (heavy means they have excess seeds, which can be bitter) I stab a few holes in the eggplant with a fork and coat it in oil. I put the eggplant directly on the flame burner, for about 3 minutes each side, turning three or four times until it is black and the skin is blistering off and begins oozing.  If you do not have a gas stove you can broil them until they look the same, they will not have a smokey flavor from being on a flame however. Transfer the eggplant to a large bowl of cold water.  Let sit while you prepare the oil, oniin, garlic, ginger and spices like in the previous dishes.  For this one I also add a diced tomato.  While that cooks down peel the eggplant, tge skin should easily come off, chop off the ends.  The eggplant should become mushy when you dice it. Add to the pan. Let the mixture cook until the water is reduced.  Top with diced cilantro."

IndianFood,2y2efn,firstsip,1 point,Fri Mar 6 02:57:32 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering, what are your favorite restaurants in the area? (I'm also from Metro Detroit.)

IndianFood,2y2efn,firstsip,1 point,Fri Mar 6 16:09:44 2015 UTC,"NAMASTE FOREVER.  Seriously, Namaste. Cheap, delicious, actually spicy and surrounded by other Indian people. My husband and I are recognizable in there, haha... or at least used to be! We haven't gone in quite awhile, but is definitely my favorite Indian restaurant.  Otherwise, Mirchi is pretty good (Novi, they recently moved), and I like Taj in Garden City (they still have my favorite chicken tikka masala). Krisha right next door to Taj is decent, but purely vegetarian (and no naan... boo). Royal Indian in Livonia is currently our go-to purely because of location, but they are still good (and the people there are super nice, and keep reducing our price everytime we go? It pays to be distinctive looking, I guess, when frequenting places).

IndianFood,2y2efn,DamienStark,11,Sat Mar 7 12:51:19 2015 UTC,Great article. Where I live there is only two close-by Indian restaurants. One of them is fantastic and I've watched it grow over the past five years as the southeast kind of dips their toes into the waters of Indian cooking. My first time every trying indian food was when I cooked it myself at age 20. I think Indian food can be a very acquired taste for a lot of Americans. We are used to strong sweet or salty flavors and I find a lot of Indian food to be spicy and aromatic and earthy. Even most of our Mexican food really isn't that spicy or earthy to me. I think real spice flavors arent as strongly embraced in America and especially where I live- though in the west it's been embraced a bit faster than in the east.
IndianFood,2y2efn,Erotic_Asphyxia,8,Thu Mar 5 22:05:31 2015 UTC,"To say that it's a problem with salty/sweet vs spicy/aromatic suggests that the vast majority of Americans have tried a variety of Indian food and decided they don't like it due to flavor.  I suspect this is not the case for most of middle America at least.  I suspect many haven't tried it at all, due to two problems, one of which is called out in the article itself:   Price: Decent Indian food requires, at a minimum, decently expensive spices and skilled cooks.  Pizza, burgers, and Mexican food (even higher quality versions) can be put together from relatively cheap ingredients by relatively low-skill cooks. Discoverability:  Not the restaurants, but the food itself.   What I mean by that is, not everyone is happy with ""here try this!"" followed by a friend forcing a bit of completely unknown food into their mouth.  Anyone with food preferences (don't like fish, love spicy, hate vegetables, love chicken, whatever) wants to have some idea what they're about to eat before they first try it.  The examples I listed above, the super popular ones in America - pizza, burgers, Mexican food - even in the rare event you've never had them, it's pretty easy to tell what it is before you try it for the first time.  ""Oh, that taco looks like cooked beef and some sliced vegetables in a piece of flat bread."" ""Cheeseburger? Looks like a slice of cheese on top of a piece of beef in the middle of a roll""  But the first time you're trying Indian food... you have no idea what you're trying.  Most curries are a difficult-to-identify chunk of protein bathing in a difficult-to-identify sauce.  That doesn't mean it's not delicious, but by looking at it you can't tell what you're getting into, so many Americans won't."
IndianFood,2y2efn,Spartan_029,2,Fri Mar 6 13:57:35 2015 UTC,"That's a really great point. One of the reasons I don't make indian food that much also is because while stores near me sometimes carry indian ingredients, curry is pretty expensive and not very fresh if it's convenient, and the good or cheaper stuff I have to find at some obscure market that's farther away. Places like walmart sell some curries but they're expensive and very broad and I'm sure not that fresh.  I had started mixing indian spices into other foods too so curry ends up just being a flavor enhancer to other more American type foods a lot of the time, which also ends up just using up my curries. Garam Masala for instance makes chili taste so much better, and Madras curry is nice in chicken soup. Then again I also think the Madras curry that many stores carry here is probably nothing like Indian madras curry. I think I've used it to make thai dishes but I'm not sure. It's yellow and I usually end up mixing it with coconut milk."
IndianFood,2y2efn,kimkaromi,2,Fri Mar 6 21:38:48 2015 UTC,"I live in a large college town in northern Colorado, the closest Indian restaurant is soloist an hour away.

I pretty much live on what I can make myself when it comes to Indian food, and unfortunately, while I'm not exactly useless in the kitchen, it isn't nearly as good as the real deal...  I would do anything and pay almost any price for some Indian food closer to home."
IndianFood,2y2efn,ninthinning01,5,Fri Mar 6 05:09:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Indian food hasn't been popular in the States because the majority of it is utter shite. To much oil/ghee, too much heeng, too much haldi, too much cream, burnt masalas, recycled food, frozen food, microwaved food, inexplicable textures....Just a spectacular shit show of awful techniques and terrible quality.   And don't get me started on the utter fucking monotonous drudgery where Indian has to mean northern food or a dosa joint (yes that is changing).   I run into people all the time who are all, Hey...this is my favourite place!"" and the food is nasty. I remember in NYC when people were trying to convince me that Curry in a Hurry was a reasonably priced ""authentic"" Indian joint. Gag! I don't know how they're still in business.   I don't know about other cities but in NYC it's only in the 10 years that really decent reasonable and mid-range Indian restaurants have started to become the norm. And in the last 5 years, it's sped up with more and more regional cuisines and techniques starting to show up. I imagine it's partly because palates are more educated today and also the lifting of trade restrictions has resulted in better quality raw goods being available at a lower price."

I know, I know, buffet is not the best food, but it's a relatively cheap way for newcomers to see what they're getting into, and try a huge variety of dishes for pretty cheap, that way they can figure out which ones they do and don't like for a pretty cheap entry price.    Then once you learn ""ooh, I loved those kofta, and samosas, and the chicken masala, and naan.  Need some raita too..."" now you know what to order at a nicer Indian restaurant."
IndianFood,2y2efn,sleepeejack,4,Fri Mar 6 16:44:56 2015 UTC,"I'm very skeptical of this article, or at least its reasoning. There was a monumental paradigm shift in the '80s regarding food and restaurants. At the time, sushi was considered exotic and elitist. This was only 30 years ago. Asian foods, such as Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, have familiar ingredients (chicken, mushrooms, prawns/shrimp, duck, pork, noodles, etc.) and a familiar-looking/tasting finished dish, and the Chinese have been in America for well over a century. The obstacle for Indian food is not that it is expensive or labor-intensive; the obstacle is the unfamiliarity and the foreignness of ingredients and the finished dish. It's intimidating for the home cook. Further, many ingredients require trips to specialty grocery stores, and appear to be singular-dish items (how can I possibly use this ingredient some other way?)."
IndianFood,2y2efn,DamienStark,9,Fri Mar 6 14:10:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think that just because there aren't tons of expensive Indian restaurants means that Indian is unpopular in America.  Maybe it just means that Indian food doesn't get much added benefit from extra-fancy ingredients.  I've been to probably 25-30 Indian restaurants in the states and my favorites are usually in the $15-20 entree range.  I think it speaks well of the cuisine, frankly -- it doesn't have to be super-expensive to be super-awesome."
IndianFood,2y2efn,Rose1982,1 point,Fri Mar 6 18:46:35 2015 UTC,"I think you have the problem backwards.  The article isn't complaining that Indian restaurants aren't expensive enough. It's complaining that the total volume of Indian food being sold is drastically smaller than say, Mexican food.  That's definitely not because Mexican food is super expensive.  You specifically call out ""$15-20 entree"" and I think that's the problem.  My co-workers used to eat lunch every Wednesday at an El Chico - actual sit-down restaurant chain, not fast food like Taco Bell - and the entire lunch with a drink was maybe $11.  This is a case like Walmart, where by selling a much cheaper product, Mexican restaurants are - in total - making way more money due to way more volume.  Americans rarely want a ""casual"" meal where it's going to cost them $30 or more, and if they're looking for a ""fancy"" meal they're more likely to go to a steakhouse or French restaurant, not look for vindaloo and samosas."

I know a restaurant here that sells great Indian food and is always swarmed by collage students. Secret too much oil, but great flavor.  And another restaurant, which I thought how bad could it be. So I tried. The chicken was so dry and no consistency in the food at all. Totally looked like leftovers of some kitchen disaster. There are just so many times you can send food back before you, yourself start getting embarrass.  Another restaurant with the rudest service I have received. I ordered a take away and it was pathetic. They forgot to put the Sabji and Sauce. When I went back there not only they were unapologetic but they gave me an eye as if I removed those packets and came back. Seriously for their $2 chutney I will burn $3 worth of my gas."
IndianFood,2y2efn,Xpress_interest,3,Sat Mar 7 06:38:24 2015 UTC,"For some reason I just get this impression especially in trying my hand at cooking indian food myself, the flavors and textures are pretty complex and I feel like it's easy, at least in my experience to end up with something that tastes wrong, or you use too little of a spice or ingredient, or put them in at the wrong time and it ends up tasteless. I think there's so much more science to Indian food than I am used to in what I normally cook.

IndianFood,2y2efn,standrightwalkleft,-3,Fri Mar 6 07:27:04 2015 UTC,"From the article:   But the truth is that Indian food isn't anywhere nearly as popular as it should be.   This isn't a statement of fact, it's the writers opinion. Obviously, an opinion not shared by the many people who don't eat Indian food.  Personally, I'm something of a fan but as a Midwestern boy raised on meat and potatoes, Indian food takes some getting used to. A lot of getting used to, in some instances. There is some mighty strange stuff coming from NE India and some of the stuff is so hot it's better as an insecticide than food. It doesn't help that much of the Indian food in the US came to us via the Brits whose history of 'borrowing' cuisines from their colonies and fusing them into some kind of unintelligible glomp (phall, vindaloo) is legendary. Many of the spices are new, the lack of familiar spices is disorienting and the lack of meat and potatoes sometimes leaves a giant sucking hole in the menu. As an avowed omnivore, I think the religious fetish called 'vegetarian' is silly twaddle and difficult to overcome, it has taken me years to get to a point where I can look at lentils and not automatically associate them with pork.  Most people get introduced to new foods by people they know. The new neighbors kid invites you for dinner, the hot date takes you someplace exotic, etc. Tastes are like habits, they can and do change but very slowly and require repeated exposure. I live in an area where there are a fair number of immigrants from India and they support a number of restaurants that are the entryway for people like me to learn and experiment in. We're having fun with it but it also competes with so many other cuisines that the process is slower than it might otherwise be. Until it begins to become available in more areas, whiny little elitist bitches in the Washington Post are exactly that: a way for the author to show off his putative sophistication and to demonstrate how much better he is than the rubes that don't know or don't agree with him.

IndianFood,2xhlne,2Cuil4School,5,Sat Feb 28 19:46:36 2015 UTC,"2 Classic Indian Curries and 1 Delicious, Sinful Side  To be upfront, I'm able to do this in part because a very kind fellow redditor, /u/chromiselda, manager at Regency Spices, donated a sampler pack of their Indian Spices Starter Kit to me. This isn't paid advertising or anything, but I think it's right to show my appreciation to him for his awesome gift by noting where most of the spices in these recipes are from!  Now, onto the food! Here are three fabulous Indian dishes we all know and love--made a little healthier where possible. So, get ready to learn how to make Chana Masala (Vibrant chickpeas cooked in a thick, spicy-tangy curry), Butter Chicken (Tender white meat chicken simmered in a delicately spiced, creamy tomato sauce), and as a bonus, Bhaturas (Puffy, fluffy, crispy fried Indian breads, perfect as a once-in-a-blue-moon treat!).    Chana Masala (Chole)  Vibrant chickpeas cooked in a thick, spicy-tangy curry; ~6 servings; doubles well  Ingredients   ½ lb Dried Chickpeas, soaked overnight with two teabags (or at least 6 hours) and boiled with ½ tsp Salt in 1 gallon water until “squishably” soft—probably 1 – 1 ½ hours; reserve cooking water 3 tbsp Oil 2 Bay Leaves 2 1” sticks Cinnamon 2-3 Green Cardamom Pods 3-4 Cloves (Optional) 2 blades Mace 1 tsp Cumin Seeds 2 medium Onions, finely diced 1 tsp Salt 1 tbsp Ginger-Garlic Paste (or 1 ½ tsp each Ginger and Garlic, minced) Recipe here 1-2 Green Chilies, diced ½ tsp Turmeric Powder 1 tbsp Chana/Chole Masala Powder (or make your own with the below combination)   1 tsp Coriander Powder ½ tsp Cumin Powder ½ tsp Red Chili Powder ½ tsp Amchur Powder (powdered dried Mangos) ½ tsp Anardana Powder (powdered dried Pomegranate Seeds)  1 tsp Coriander Powder (Optional) ½ tsp Red Chili Powder 1 cup Pureed Tomatoes (about 4-5 Roma Tomatoes) ½ - ¾ cup Chickpea Cooking Water 1 tbsp Cilantro, chopped   Directions  As in the ingredients, soak ½ lb of dried chickpeas in enough water to cover by 2-3” overnight, along with 1-2 small teabags (just basic black tea) added in; these will dye and mildly flavor the chickpeas. The next day (or 6+ hours later), bring about a gallon of water to a boil with ½ tsp of salt in it. Add the chickpeas and cook until they are completely soft—you should be easily able to squash them between a finger and your thumb. Drain them, reserving some of the cooking water for later. You can cook the teabags with the chickpeas for a much more striking color, but I find cooking tea that long lends a slight bitter flavor, and fishing them out is sort of troublesome!  In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat your oil over medium heat. Add the bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, cloves, mace, and cumin seeds, and fry, stirring, for about 30-45 seconds, until very fragrant and sizzling noticeably. Add in the onions and salt and mix everything together, and then cook (stirring frequently) until the onions are darkening noticeably—at least 10-12 minutes. Add in the ginger-garlic paste and sauté, stirring, for another 2-3 minutes to cook out the raw flavors in the paste. Then, add in the green chilies and cook another 1-2 minutes more.  At this time, add in your dried, powdered spices: the turmeric, chana masala, coriander, and red chili powders. Stir them into the onion mixture and sauté for about 30 seconds; if the mixture is too dry and sticking badly, add water to prevent it burning, as burnt spices will make the entire dish unpleasantly bitter.  Then add in the tomato puree and simmer, covered, at least 8-10 more minutes to cook the tomatoes well. Afterward, add in your chickpeas and some of the reserved cooking water to your desired consistency. Mash a few of the chickpeas with your spoon and then boil for about 5-10 minutes until thickening and flavorful. Finally, stir in some cilantro and—if you like your chana masala tangy—1-2 tbsp of fresh lime juice. Serve hot with bhaturas and/or basmati rice!    Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani)  Tender white meat chicken simmered in a delicately spiced, creamy tomato sauce; ~6 servings; doubles well  Ingredients   1 ½ lb Chicken Breast, chopped into bite-sized pieces or thin slices ¼ cup Plain Yogurt ½ tsp Salt 1 tsp Ginger-Garlic Paste 1 tsp Kashmiri Chili Powder (or Paprika for less heat) 1 tsp Coriander Powder 1 tbsp Lime Juice 1 tbsp Oil 2 tbsp Butter 1 tsp Cumin Seeds 2-4 Green Cardamom Pods, bruised (partially crushed) 1 medium Onion, finely diced 1 tbsp Ginger-Garlic Paste (or 1 ½ tsp each Ginger and Garlic, minced) Recipe here 0-2 Green Chilies, finely diced (Optional) 2-3 tbsp Cashew Nut Paste (add small amount of boiling Water to Cashews, soak 5-10 minutes, then blend into a thick, smooth paste) 1 tsp Salt ½ - 1 tsp Kashmiri Chili Powder ½ tsp Cumin Powder 2 tsp Coriander Powder 6 (large) – 9 (small) Roma Tomatoes, pureed—about 2 cups (Optional: skin and seed first for silkier gravy) ¼ - ¾ cups Water 1 tsp Sugar 1 tbsp Kasoori Methi, rubbed to a fine powder by hand 1 tsp Garam Masala ¼ - ½ cup Cream or Plain Yogurt (healthier) (Optional) 2 tbsp Butter 1 tbsp Cilantro, chopped   Directions  Combine the chicken pieces, yogurt, ½ tsp salt, ginger-garlic paste, Kashmiri chili powder/paprika, coriander powder, and lime juice and marinate for at least 2 hours (but up to 8). When finished, heat oil in a wide skillet (or large pot/Dutch oven, if you’d like to make this a one-pot recipe) over medium-high heat and brown the chicken pieces (it’s alright if they don’t completely finish cooking at this stage). Remove the cooked chicken and reserve.  In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt your butter over medium heat. Once it mostly stops sizzling, add in the cumin seeds and cardamom pods and fry for about 20-30 seconds before adding in the diced onions. Cook for approximately 8-10 minutes until soft and beginning to slightly brown. Add in the ginger-garlic paste and cook a further 2-3 minutes to reduce the raw flavors of ginger and garlic. If using, add in the green chilies and cashew nut paste, then cook an additional 1-2 minutes. If, at any point, the mixture dries out and starts to stick, add a couple of tablespoons of water.  At this time, add in your initial powdered spices and seasonings: salt, plus Kashmiri chili, cumin, and coriander powders. Stir to combine with the onion mixture and fry for about 30 seconds. Add in the tomatoes and cook, stirring, for at least 8-10 minutes, until tomatoes are darkened and drying out. At this point, add water to achieve your desired texture (and, if you’d like, blend smooth with an immersion blender, removing the cardamom pods first).  Add the chicken pieces and simmer for 5 minutes or so to cook through and meld flavors. Add and stir in the sugar, kasoori methi, garam masala, cream or yogurt, additional butter (if using), and, finally, the cilantro. Sample a bit of the sauce to test the seasoning, then serve hot with basmati rice and fresh, buttered naan.    Bhaturas  Puffy, fluffy, crispy fried Indian breads; ~6 large pieces  Ingredients   2 cups All Purpose Flour (Maida) ¼ cup Semolina Flour (Sooji) ½ tsp Salt 1 tsp Sugar ¼ tsp Baking Soda ½ tsp Baking Powder ¼ cup Plain Yogurt Water as needed (~¼ - ⅓ cup) Oil for frying   Directions  Combine the AP flour, semolina, salt, sugar, baking soda, and baking powder in a large bowl and stir together well. Mix in the yogurt, incorporating it into the entire mixture. Then, ideally by hand, mix in lukewarm water until the mixture comes together in a stiff, thick dough. Don’t worry about making it perfectly smooth yet, but do knead it briefly—about a minute.  Cover with a little oil (a tsp or so), then cover the bowl with a dish towel or similar and set the dough aside in a warm place to rise for approximately 2-3 hours. When it’s nearly risen, begin heating oil in a large pot or deep fryer to about 350-360F. The proper temperature can be tested by tearing off a small pinch of dough, flattening it into a little disc, and adding it to the oil: if it’s the right temperature, the dough fall to the bottom of the pot, then begin bubbling and rise to the surface almost immediately.  Divide the dough into balls—somewhere between golf ball and lemon-sized, depending on your preference for the final product’s size—and roll each one smooth, then press flat. If it’s slightly sticky, barely flour it. In any case, then roll the discs of dough into thin, flat rounds—somewhere in the vicinity of the thickness of a flour tortilla or a crepe. The most important thing is to get them evenly thin.  Add each round of dough to the oil one by one. Using a spider or other heat-proof cooking spatula/spoon, press the top of the dough down into the oil. This action will eventually coax one or more large bubbles out of the bhatura; use the tool to squeeze the bubbles down to even them out across the entire surface of the dough, making a puffy balloon-like shape. Don’t worry if you can’t get giant spheres every time; even a few smaller bubbles add a wonderful texture to the finished product! After 30-45 seconds of frying (or once the side in the oil is crispy and browning slightly), flip it and cook until the bottom is also golden brown and crispy.  Fry each piece of dough similarly, and then remove each to paper towels to dry and cool slightly. Serve them, still warm, with Indian curries like chana masala.    I hope you enjoyed! If you have any questions or comments, please ask below, and I'll be happy to answer."

IndianFood,2xhbys,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Mar 3 17:50:05 2015 UTC,"Cardamom:       Cardamom (/ˈkɑrdəməm/), sometimes called cardamon, is a spice consisting of the seeds of several plants in the genera Elettaria and Amomum in the family Zingiberaceae. Both genera are native to India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bhutan; they are recognised by their small seed pods, triangular in cross-section and spindle-shaped, with a thin, papery outer shell and small black seeds. Guatemala, where the German coffee planter Oscar Majus Kloeffer introduced Indian cardamom before World War I,  has become the biggest producer and exporter of cardamom in the world, followed by India. Some other countries, such as Sri Lanka, have also begun to cultivate it. Elettaria pods are light green, while Amomum pods are larger and dark brown.

The chilies were sliced at an angle and all the spices were mixed in a bowl until well blended. My eyes were watering by the time I packed the chilies into a jar. I really enjoy hot spicy food and cannot wait to try your chili pickles.

IndianFood,2xff92,ninthinning01,3,Fri Mar 6 17:38:56 2015 UTC,"Here is how you make this amazing green chili pickle: (For more check out: http://www.peppergarlickitchen.com/hari-mirch-ka-achar-green-chili-pickle/)  Ingredients:   250 gms green chili (long non spicy ones) 2 tbsp fennel seeds (saunf) 2 tbsp mustard seeds (sarson) 1 tsp nigella seeds (kalounji) 1 tsp cumin seeds (jeera) 1/2 tbsp fenugreek seeds (methi) 1/4 tbsp asafoetida (hing) 2 tbsp dry mango powder (amchur) 1 tsp turmeric powder 1 tsp red chili powder (optional) 3 tbsp salt 1/2 tsp sugar 1 tsp vinegar 1/4 cup mustard oil   Method   Wash and dry the green chilies. If you have time in hand you can dry them in sun for a day. Cut the chilies in small bite size pieces. Dry roast fennel, cumin, mustard, nigella and fenugreek seeds slightly just so that there is is no moisture in the seeds. Grind these seeds in a coffee grinder to coarse powder. Add this ground powder in green chilies along with turmeric powder, red chili powder, amchur powder, salt, sugar and vinegar. You will need more salt than you normally use as salt also acts as preservative. Mix chilies and masala very well. Heat mustard oil till its boiling point and then let it come down at room temperature. Add asafoetida in oil at this point and pour the oil on the chilies. Oil should be enough to cover all the chilies. Store pickle in clean and dry air tight container. In 2-3 days pickle will be ready to eat, if only you can resist. This pickle can last for couple of months and can be stored in refrigerator to store longer."

IndianFood,2wkhdn,refugefirstmate,4,Fri Feb 20 22:53:35 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite stories to tell about cooking Indian food is related to that, actually!  Way back when, many years ago, I decided I wanted to cook Indian food at home, so I bought an Indian cookbook. And promptly realized my house didn't have any of that stuff. But I heard that there was an Indian grocer about 50 minutes away, so I bugged my mom to drive me there (this was a long time ago!).  I got all excited and bought a bunch of stuff to make my chosen recipe: chicken vindaloo. That place was magical; so many spices, herbs, etc., I'd never seen before! Man, talk about overwhelming. Got home, unloaded it all, cracked open the cookbook. . . and promptly realized I was actually missing like 2-3 key components. Oops!  So, I flipped around and eventually landed up on Goan Chicken, which I did have all the spices for, and mom just happened to have a big bag of dessicated coconut kicking around. So I cooked a giant batch of it. . . and promptly hated it. Mom was a real champ (she's sort of the hero of this story) and ate every bit of the leftovers, then drove me back to the Indian grocer a few days/weeks later and I got my missing spices.

Slice the onion lengthways very thinly and place in a bowl.     Peel and grate (or very finely chop) the potatoes into the same bowl. You can also use aubergines and cauliflower - chop into very small pieces.     Sprinkle all the dry spices and freshly chopped coriander, chillies and ginger into the bowl and then sieve in the gram flour - mix together using your hand.      Add a small amount of water a little at a time to create a thick batter that coats all the vegetables. Squeeze the mixture through your fingers to ensure all the spices mix through. Do not leave the batter and vegetable mixture for too long before cooking.     Test your oil is hot enough by dropping a little batter into the oil. If it browns and rises immediately then it is ready. Very carefully drop in spoonfuls of the mixture into the oil and fry until golden brown.     Using a slotted spoon move the pakora around, be careful not to overcrowd the karahi.     Once golden brown and crisp remove from the oil and set on some kitchen paper.     And lest anyone get concerned about blogspam/self-promotion, I can assure you that I'm not half as charming, talented, or photogenic as Mrs. Ghotra! Also, my kitchen is way uglier and smaller :("

(It may take a few days for the smell to dissipate.)  By the way, the other reason I'm happy to have it around is I'm really impressed with how things taste when using it.

IndianFood,2w25ig,2Cuil4School,1 point,Mon Feb 16 16:09:18 2015 UTC,"What would you consider to be the intrinsic spices/flavor bases for your favorite Indian recipes? Home-style or restaurant-style, professional or personal recipe, etc., doesn't matter that much to me. Mostly just wondering: what combination of spice flavors and aromatics really ""defines"" certain popular dishes to you?  For instance, how do you differentiate the tastes of:   ____ Makhani (e.g., Murgh Mahkani, Paneer Makhani) ____ ""Tikka Masala"" (e.g., Chicken Tikka Masala, Paneer Tikka Masala) ____ Saag/Palak (e.g., Saag Aloo, Palak Paneer, Lamb Saag) ____ Korma (e.g. Chicken Korma, Navratan Korma, Fish Korma) ____ Matar (e.g., Matar Paneer, Keema Matar, Aloo Matar)   Do you vary the spices/flavors based on the ""main ingredient?"" For instance, do you use more/different spices for a lamb saag than a paneer one? Up the flavors to compensate for beef in keema matar compared to the milder taste of potatoes in aloo matar?  I'm genuinely curious, because I sometimes find myself falling into a ""trap"" of very similar flavor profiles for different dishes. Worst case scenario is a very formulaic start to the recipe: oil with 1 tsp cumin seeds, 1 small red onion diced, 1 tbsp garlic-ginger paste, 2 and green chilies minced for the aromatics, with 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1 tsp cumin powder, 2 tsp coriander powder, 1 tsp chili powder, finished with 1 tsp garam masala at the end for the spices.  So, I'm searching for ways to make my ____ matar truly unique from my ____ makhani other than just putting peas in one and extra butter in the other.    (Worth noting this problem isn't restricted to just Indian cuisine; I run in the same sort of problem a lot with Mexican and Cajun cooking--everything's all onion/garlic/tomato/cumin/oregano/red pepper in one and onion/bell pepper/celery/thyme/parsley/cayenne in the other, and sometimes it feels like my recipes are running together a little, so I always look to others for inspiration :-D)"
IndianFood,2w25ig,brobrobroccoli,1 point,Mon Feb 16 16:31:20 2015 UTC,"Matar basically just means with peas, Saag/Palak is a dish with spinach.  Tikka Massala refers to the method: Tikka being marinated, (skewered) grilled meat thrown into a specific spiced tomato gravy, often with the addition of cream, yogurt or sometimes coconut milk.  Makhani means a butter gravy, very rich, often bright red in color. Sometimes the chicken is marinated and grilled, sometimes not.  Korma is usually rather mild in flavor, yellow-ish in color and has a creamy gravy, which is achieved with the addition of yogurt, a nut paste (cashews, almonds, poppy seeds), sometimes coconut milk or cream.  There are, however, a whole lot of versions of any of these."

IndianFood,2vzz9s,mediamaker,6,Sun Feb 15 23:33:51 2015 UTC,"You'll need:  A couple of potatoes, chopped into bite sizes pieces.   Green beans - As much as you would like along with your potatoes.   One small red onion -  finely chopped   Ginger-garlic paste - Just about half a table spoon - I have a jar in the fridge that's store bought. You could also make it fresh by grinding equal parts together or just finely chopping the two together.  Spices - Cumin seeds (1 full tablespoon), chili powder (1 teaspoon), turmeric (a TINY pinch), salt to taste, garam masala (1 teaspoon), dry corriander powder (1 teaspoon) and I used some pav bhaji Masala.   Juice of one lemon - Again, I keep the squeezy bottle in my fridge.  In a pan, heat some oil. Add your cumin seeds and let them infuse into the oil on a medium heat for a minute. When they begin spluttering, add the ginger garlic paste, fry off for a minute and then add the chopped red onion. Let it turn translucent. If you decide to skip the onion, directly add potatoes.   Now add your spices (EXCEPT the garam masala) - Salt, chili powder, turmeric, corriander powder and pav bhaji masala. Fry them off in the oil for a min along with the potatoes and add the beans. Once the veggies are coated in the spices, add a cup of water and put a lid on. Let it steam till the vegetables are almost cooked - probably about 15 mins depending on how big or small you chopped them. Stir once or twice in between  Take the lid off, add garam masala. stir and cook for a further 4-5 mins till everything is cooked through. If its too dry, sprinkle some water.   When all the vegetables are tender, turn off the heat and add the lemon juice.   For the rice I just threw the daal in with the rice, some salt and turmeric in the pressure cooker.   The rasam : Heat a little oil, add mustard seeds, cumin seeds and asafoetida when they splutter. Then I added a chopped tomato, and tamarind extract. Once this came to a boil, I added some rasam powder my grandmother made (you get ready made packs in the store) and let it bubble for a few more mins before taking it off the heat. Some people start with the tamarind extract and tomatoes and do the tempering with the spices in the end."

They'll ""dye"" the chickpeas a darker, orangish-red color, making the final dish more attractive.

Chop up a couple of small red onions, and brown them in the pan. Add chopped tomatoes (3-4) or one large tin. To this add salt to season, dry red chili powder and ground coriander powder if you have some on hand. Cover and cook for about 20 mins till tomatoes disintegrate.

IndianFood,2vpjed,noosetomeetyou,1 point,Fri Feb 13 00:56:13 2015 UTC,"In addition to Vah Chef (quite entertaining), I highly recommend you make batches of the spice mixes and sauces. Home-made ginger-garlic paste is really easy to make, and if you add some acid (lime juice, vinegar), it can keep up to a month if bottled correctly.. Same with some of the chilli sauces, coconut sauces. If I like a recipe enough to make it again, this saves a lot of time, especially on weekdays. It's way way better than the sauces you get at the store."

IndianFood,2vpjed,brobrobroccoli,11,Fri Feb 13 04:54:49 2015 UTC,"Check out chef Harpal Singh's recipes.    But you should know--the food you eat in indian restaurants really is not at all reflective of how indian people eat at home. It is far more decadent and full of cream or ghee or oil. (My mom spent years working in the kitchen of an indian restaurant, your jaw would drop if you saw how much ghee gets thrown into many of the dishes you order).  This would likely explain the main reason the good comes out so different. Jaffary is providing recipes for the home cook and not a way to replicate the restaurant experience. And you're probably better off for it if you intend to make indian food on more than just rare occasions."

Here is a recipe - http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/aarti-sequeira/aartis-hot-not-heavy-homemade-garam-masala-recipe.html  I understand of course that this relies on you being able to get cardamom, cloves and cinnamon which if you can't get garam masala might be a stupid suggestion :)"

IndianFood,2vnn0n,Jim_Nightshade,4,Thu Feb 12 15:22:36 2015 UTC,"You should be able to get cardamom at any grocery store, at least ground if not whole pods.  It's pretty common beyond indian food and it's good on just about anything that calls for warm spices."
IndianFood,2vnn0n,PandaLark,3,Thu Feb 12 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"Can confirm.  I throw a ton of garam masala into anything vaguely Indian, Mexican or American."
IndianFood,2vnn0n,sniperwolf21,5,Thu Feb 12 17:15:28 2015 UTC,"Well, you could order it online; nearly everyone has it available.  Or, if your local market has a decent selection of other spices you could make it yourself.  Try and find an ethnic market, if possible. You'll land all your spices for WAY cheaper that way."

IndianFood,2vnn0n,HardDeterminism,1 point,Thu Feb 12 15:22:57 2015 UTC,"Well, a lot of Asian markets here (Denver) have, at least, an Indian aisle, so it's worth a shot. If nothing else, they'll most likely have all the spices you need; generally for much less than any supermarket will carry them for.  I got all the necessary ingredients as whole seeds in large bags for about $15, as opposed to a small bottle of pre-mixed spice for about $7 at the supermarkets.  Buying in bulk is nice because a lot of Indian dishes take some variety of these spices, even if it's not all of them. Plus some cardamom pods and star anise makes for some tasty, tasty rice!  Good luck!"

IndianFood,2vnn0n,tjwharry,1 point,Thu Feb 12 22:10:48 2015 UTC,"If you make it on your own remember this.  Cardamom comes in three forms:  seeds, powder and pods.  If you can get it, you want seeds.  The seeds come inside the pods.  There are probably ten seeds in each pod and it is a pain to get them out.  Powder could also work, but you'll want to adjust the measurement downward."

IndianFood,2vjj8p,autowikibot,2,Thu Feb 12 02:41:49 2015 UTC,"Well, parippu is usually made with coconut, usually grated fresh coconut and I used coconut milk as a substitute.  The rest of the liquid is actually just water. You could add tomatoes and leave out the coconut I guess. For that I would fry off the cumin seeds, shallot, garlic, chilies and tomatoes beforehand, then blend up (or not) and add.   Actually you could add the mustard seeds and curry leaves in the oil before adding the ingredients that would be blended with the co conut and skip the last step."

IndianFood,2vj136,berlinCalling,1 point,Wed Feb 11 12:04:25 2015 UTC,"It's sort of difficult to tell from just a picture, but a few Indian spices are very distinct. The one in the bottom right corner is most likely red chili powder- does it smell spicy? (just a note- Indian chili powder is much spicier than your average, so if you use it in a non-Indian recipe, definitely use less) The bright yellow ones are most likely turmeric, not many other spices look that color. The dark one in the middle might be cloves? If it's a fine powder that smells sweet and intense, that's probably it. I think we need a bit more digging to identify the others- could you describe smell or taste for them? Proceed with caution if you taste though- some spices are really hot!"

IndianFood,2vj136,SabashChandraBose,1 point,Wed Feb 11 22:23:05 2015 UTC,"It's a bit difficult to tell from these pictures, as spice identification is often a matter of smell, and there's not much visual detail when they're all in bags like that. However, I'd hazard a guess that the yellow ones are turmeric (it leaves a nuclear yellow stain on your fingers and smells kind of funky), bottom right will be chilli powder (taste it - if it's very hot it will be birds eye-type chillies, if it's milder and smells a bit like paprika then it's likely ground Kashmiri chillies). The whole spices in the top middle is probably garam masala (grind before using), the one just beneath that and to the right looks like cinnamon quills, and the black bag in the middle will probably be cloves or nigella seeds. Google them to see the difference in shape. Nigella seeds smell like naan bread. Assuming he wasn't sold anything terribly unusual, the others are probably ground coriander or ground cumin. Cumin smells like mexican food, and I can't immediately think of a comparison for coriander, but it will probably be slightly paler in colour. If there are any remnants of whole spices in there, cumin seeds are long and thin, whereas coriander is small and spherical. That's probably what he has there, because those are pretty much the basic spices in Indian cooking."

It's unlikely you will find authentic ingredients in these stores, and if you do, they will be grossly overpriced due to the low demand.  Try Googling for an Indian or Pakistani grocery store in your region, where you can buy the real thing. If you have to travel to another city, you can make a list of staples used in multiple dishes (ghee, whole spices, etc.) so you don't need to make the trip again for a while. Whole spices will keep a long time in sealed containers in the freezer.  Also, Basmati rice is fragrant on its own, but is often cooked with whole spices to add to this. I add cinnamon sticks and black cardamom pods."

IndianFood,2umi63,saadakhtar,3,Tue Feb 3 11:31:33 2015 UTC,swaad= taste  swaadisht= tasty  I think that restaurant was going for something in between.. maybe just using it as a buzzword.  swaadi/swadee is not a word in the hindi vocab acc to me.  source : native hindi speaker.
IndianFood,2umi63,shwetshkla,2,Tue Feb 3 17:35:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's a typo. I've actually never heard of this dish before (I'm indian-american); but after a Google search, it seems a small number of indian restaurants serve something called chicken tikka ""sAwadee"". I think that should help you find more info. Based on that, sawadee seems to be a thai word used in their greetings; so I would suspect this dish is a thai/indian fusion dish. Again, this is all speculation."
IndianFood,2umi63,jb728,1 point,Tue Feb 3 12:41:19 2015 UTC,"Swadee could probably mean flavorful, though it's not an actual translation. I have never heard such word in my lifetime.

IndianFood,2uhzot,paukin,5,Mon Feb 2 10:40:54 2015 UTC,"Living in the UK, 'Indian' food is obviously incredibly popular and when I realised that what most restaurants serve is a narrow selection of Bangladeshi meat dishes and British versions of Indian staples, I started looking around and discovered a big Tamil community in south London and the amazing grocery shops and restaurants. I went to India (the north and Mumbai) in 2008, spent most of my time eating and discovering food and drink and talking about food as much as possible (which is a lot). I then went back a few years ago to Chennai and had some of the best food I've ever eaten (Murugan Idli Shop was up there with my favorite meals of all time) and tried to visit every Saravana Bhavan I could find (I think I went to about 7, not including the ones in London). I've always been massively into cooking, and since 2008 have mostly cooked Indian food at home. I'm getting better but still haven't made a samba as good as Saravana Bhavan. Also, I have no problems with Idli and uttapam but my dosas stick EVERY time and are always too thick. Any tips?"
IndianFood,2uhzot,princesspulse,3,Mon Feb 2 14:13:55 2015 UTC,"For the dosa, make sure your batter is not too diluted. It should be fairly thick. In fact I use the same consistency as that for uttappam. I heat a non stick pan till its hot,  reduce the flame to the lowest, dollop a ladle full of batter on and spread. Spread evenly in concentric circles.  And then I raise the heat back up to high and just let it be. Dont touch it, no oil, nothing. In a few minutes it gets golden brown, crispy and starts to peal off the pan at the edges. Then slowly flip it. Never sticks. Try these exact steps, you should have crispy brown ones like in a restaurant without even using oil. I make them at least twice a week and it never sticks.   On a side note, next time you're in Chennai don't go to saravana bhavan. They're okay but not the best. Try New Woodlands in R K Salai."

I remember the nice waiters bringing me and my sister a stool, so we could have a better view of the cooks making naan, our faces plastered to the glass kitchen divider. And they'd give us little pieces of naan, with a dab of ghee! When I became an adult, and started cooking more regularly, I dusted off some wonderful Indian vegetarian cookbooks, and tried out a few recipes. Fast forward several years, and I'm the family expert on home cooked Indian food. The thing about cooking, is that you really only get better at it!"
IndianFood,2uhzot,2Cuil4School,1 point,Tue Feb 10 00:46:41 2015 UTC,"A very good friend (who is much more worldly than me--her family traveled the world every summer, including India) insisted I go eat Indian food once when I was visiting; her whole family all got different stuff and let me try it all. I loved some of it, was totally freaked out by other parts! (I was mostly a burgers and pizza kinda guy)  Not long after that, I went off to college in a much larger city (Boston), which had a decent selection of [Americanized] Indian restaurants, and luckily, one of my roommates was Persian and loved all sorts of foods from that region of the world, so we went out to eat all the time.  When I started going home to a much more rural area of the US during breaks from school, I found I couldn't get good restaurant food anymore, but that there was a very small Indian grocer about 40 minutes away. I started stocking up on spices and buying cookbooks to learn the techniques.  Youtube was a big innovation for me; there are so many great chefs on there, and being able to see things like roasting spices, building a masala, cutting meat to let flavor in, etc., was a big deal for me. I owe a lot to chefs like VahChef, Manjula, Harpal Singh, and--more recently--Hari Ghotra.  I've since moved to a more populous area of the US with a very large Indian and Pakistani population, so there are tons of restaurants and--more importantly--Indian grocers in the area. They all compete on price and quality, so it's truly heaven for me.  I probably cook and eat Indian food about 1/2 of the time, with the rest split between Cajun (half my heritage), Latin American (the other half of my heritage), and classic Southern American homestyle cooking. It's a big part of my life, and I love learning about Indian food and culture, and spend a lot of time doing so. It really helps me appreciate what I cook and eat even more, and learn why things are made the way they are and taste they way they do. I tend to evangelize a bit about it here on reddit!"

Toward the end, adding ingredients like lemon juice (mango powder and tamarind have a similar souring effect), cilantro, cream, coconut milk or yogurt can take it to the next level."

Curry powder at local megamart doesn't even come close to it.  In the West, Indian curries have a few versions.   One is vindaloo made with garam masala, tomatoe paste, and some acidic components like vinegar or lemon juice. Made with all kinds of meats, lamb, beef, pork, and chicken.   Another popular one is Tikka masala and it's made with garam masala and yogurt or cream.   if you use that mix of yogurt and garam masala as a marinade and grill it, you get tandoori chicken.   Other big components of the flavors are the other aromatics like onion, ginger, and garlic."

IndianFood,2tpdnk,Jaypx90,3,Mon Jan 26 08:32:11 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone, I just discovered a great Asian supermarket near me where I can get some of the harder-to-source spices and ingredients!  Just wondering where the best place to start is, recipe wise? What's a good progression of dishes?  Thanks!"
IndianFood,2tpdnk,2Cuil4School,2,Mon Jan 26 16:52:05 2015 UTC,"I always think it's best to go with what you know and like, either in Indian cuisine or otherwise.  For instance, if you love Chicken Tikka Masala, try a few variations of that. Even a relatively ""simple"" dish like that can have a lot of variance (do you cook in butter or oil or ghee? Use whole spices or pre-powdered? Add some qasuri methi--dried fenugreek leaf--or not? Cream or yogurt at the end? Skins on the tomatoes or off? Etc.), so experimenting with slightly different preparations can teach you a lot about how different ingredients work together, and you can start to figure out what components get closest to your favorite restaurants (hint: butter and salt).  On the other hand, if you just really love okra, for instance, search around for recipes that include ""bindi"" (bindhi, bhindi, etc.; there doesn't seem to be a strict standard for Romanizing languages from the subcontinent), that way you can Indianize your favorites, giving you something comfortable to work from. For instance, if you really love red beans (rajma), you already sort of know how long they should cook, how long they should soak, etc., so you can focus on the ""new"" parts of the recipes (e.g., building a masala, adding a tarka, etc.).  Finally, I find that prepping a few dishes over a couple of days can give you the experience of a restaurant-style ""thali"" (multi-dish sampler) without being too onerous on any given night. Look at local Indian joint menus for an idea of what recipes ""go well"" together in that regard. Since most restaurants stick primarily with North Indian food (with hints of Bengali and Goan cuisine, it seems), you'll find a lot of overlap in ingredients anyway.  Anyhoo, some personal favorite ""easy"" recipes:   Butter Chicken (a little easier than Chicken Tikka Masala, since grilling the meat isn't as vital) - Tender chicken in a creamy, tangy-sweet tomato sauce Rajma Masala - Red beans cooked in a blend of Indian spices Chana Masala - Chickpeas cooked in a blend of Indian spices Muttar Paneer / Aloo Muttar - Sweet-and-spicy curry with peas and either potatoes or Indian cheese (or just do both!) Chapatis - Wheat flatbreads cooked on the stovetop (Easier than fermented naan or layered parathas!)   It takes a different set of ingredients (Mustard Seed/Red Chilies/Curry Leaves/Hing/Cumin Seed/Turmeric rather than Cumin Seed/Cumin Powder/Coriander Powder/Turmeric/Red Chili Powder/Garam Masala), but some S. Indian-style dishes might work well, too, as easy-to-learn:   Bindhi Fry - Sliced okra in a tangy, hot stir-fry of veggies Dal Tarka - Yellow lentils flavored with a deep and spicy ""tadka"""
IndianFood,2tpdnk,SabashChandraBose,3,Mon Jan 26 21:09:09 2015 UTC,"Made dal makhani last night following this recipe  I must say, as simple as it appears to be, it's probably the best goddang DM I have ever eaten in my life. The 100g of butter shocked me a bit though."

IndianFood,2tpdnk,ninthinning01,3,Mon Jan 26 23:39:38 2015 UTC,The key to good paneer is to bring the milk to a foamy boil.   Cook it until it is almost boiling over.   Also use a half cup of vinegar or more.   You should rinse the cheese to remove the vinegar before pressing.  Here is good method for paneer  and for queso fresco.  Also the milk cannot be ultra pasteurized or ultra homogenized.

IndianFood,2tk7ix,murckem,1 point,Sun Jan 25 17:23:32 2015 UTC,Panni means water. Puri is the cracker thing you put it in.  Together the dish is called panni poori. (Lots of alternative spellings sometimes). They are also called golgappas.    Usually you will put some spiced potatoes chickpeas or fresh onions and cilantro.
IndianFood,2tk7ix,vanillamasala,1 point,Sun Jan 25 17:51:32 2015 UTC,Add a little but of red-chilli powder and you'll get the spicy herb sauce. It's also a way of making pani puri which is very common.

Just soak it in water for a few hours and put it on/over your charcoal grill. There's several videos on youtube with instructions on how to make simple ones as well as free-standing ones that may be large enough to make naan. Look for trash-can tandoor designs, they may be large enough."
IndianFood,2te28h,SanjayBeast,2,Fri Jan 23 18:48:19 2015 UTC,"I have a tandoor at home, but before we did we used to make naan two ways. The naan we make is not as thick as some you might buy, but the best way we found was to get a pizza stone, and put it under your grill at max heat - but not too close to the grill. Then take it out after 15 mins, lay your naan on the stone and place it back under the grill. If you place it too close to the grill, as it puffs up it may touch the heating element, giving you funky char marks for 1 second, but then flaming naan the next, so be careful. It's important to flip the naan, of course. Take out once browned on both sides and brush with slated/garliced ghee, and enjoy. This works best with slightly thinner naan as they cook through and brown in the right amount of time under a grill, and thick naan work best in a tandoor where the heat is more consistent from the clay."

IndianFood,2syqog,rehanadujour,6,Tue Jan 20 21:28:28 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of answering this well is going to hinge on what you mean by ""authentic.""  For a lot of people in the US, that means restaurant-style, and the restaurants here tend to differ from those in the UK, and the ones actually in India are wildly different from either of the previous, more often than not. For other folks, it might mean replicating the home-cooked meals a friend, coworker, or even loved one let you try. And sometimes it just means you're trying to cook stuff you've never got to have before.  Another important thing to consider is that a lot of Indian recipes vary heavily. It's just like, say, red beans and rice in Louisianan cuisine. Each household makes it a little different--some folks put in a lot of thyme, others rely heavily on fresh parsley. Then consider that Cajun and Creole cuisine ""grew up"" right next to each other, but have important differences.  Similarly, in India, everyone's mom or grandma had their own special way of making butter paneer or bhindi fry, and each region (and there's many!) has its own spin on things. The spices and flavorings used by Jains in the deep South are very different than those used up in Mumbai, which are altogether different from those out in the Indo-China region in the far east.    I just put all that out there to note that ""authentic"" is a really wide spectrum, and maybe not even something worth worrying about a lot. If you cook it with heart and effort, and like it, then that's what it's really all about, even if one guy says it's just like homemade and another tells you it's not right at all :)  Now, all that said, I have heard a ton of people really raving over Madhur Jaffrey's books (that's a link to her Amazon author page), as she writes well and clearly and covers most of the classic Indian dishes that are known and loved around the world. If you want something to keep at home and work through, you'd be hard pressed to do much better than one of her popular books :)    Re: Coriander/Cilantro, it is an important flavor in a lot of dishes, but it's not vital. Remember that bit I said earlier about everyone making their dishes a little differently? Some folks add a sprinkle of fennel seeds up front, other people don't.  Although cilantro is pretty universal, it's by no means essential to most things. Obviously I wouldn't recommend making cilantro chutney without cilantro, but mint chutney would be just fine :)  It does add an herby, citrusy flair, so if you wanted to keep some of that flavor, maybe a sprinkle of fresh parsley and a spritz of lemon juice would serve as an adequate replacement. Also, I would recommend at least trying to keep coriander powder/seeds in the recipes, as (if I recall correctly), the seeds don't provide the same ""weird flavor"" that some people are genetically inclined to taste in cilantro leaves/stems."

And unless you're making traditional coriander related dishes like Coriander Fritters, Alu Vadi, etc., it should always be optional."

IndianFood,2shdlr,BunnyMuu,11,Thu Jan 15 04:17:19 2015 UTC,I have had bread pakoras at roadside stalls at least in early 80s so that makes them pretty authentic I guess. Those were without stuffing though. They are usually eaten as afternoon/evening snack.
IndianFood,2shdlr,cli7,15,Thu Jan 15 04:39:58 2015 UTC,"To get anywhere with this question, we need to agree on what authentic means in the first place.   Does authentic mean it should have existed in India for hundreds of years?  What if it was created in India in the last 10 years?  What if it was created outside India by Indian chefs, is that authentic?  Sliced bread didn't exist in India (or even the world) for very long. However, doughy deep fried potato snacks have existed for centuries. Adapting them to use sliced bread is a simple change and doesn't exactly make it un-authentic.   IMHO, if it tastes great, it's good eats. And that's all that really matters."
IndianFood,2shdlr,foragerr,5,Thu Jan 15 05:13:10 2015 UTC,"My mom makes this, it's legit but she doesn't use mashed potato.

She's been making this for I think my entire life so it probably came from India and wasn't a 'new' thing she adapted from North American cuisine."

Make sure milk does not stick to the bottom of the pan.  In around 45 minutes, milk starts to get thick. Keep stirring and let it not stick to the bottom and get burnt.  You can switch the flame to low now.  In about an hour, milk will be quite thick. It is done when you like the thickness, just keep in mind it will get even thicker after cooling off.

IndianFood,2s5c53,ninthinning01,2,Mon Jan 12 08:32:11 2015 UTC,"What are your thoughts on food coloring?   Chicken tikka masala is the only dish I've used food coloring to make dish red.  Kashmir chilies are relatively mild and contribute red color,  not bright red, but pretty good.  How is bright red color achieved without added food coloring?"
IndianFood,2s5c53,2Cuil4School,1 point,Wed Jan 14 14:17:35 2015 UTC,"I've used paprika in the past as a food reddening agent, as its sweet, mild flavor tends to meld into everything else going on in the curry without changing it too much. The amount of even kashmiri chili powder one would need to achieve deep, bright reds might be too much for some folks.  Otherwise, I think you almost need to look into food coloring. Blended tomatoes, even well-cooked, are more orange or pink--particularly if you remove the skins for texture (as you often would in, say, butter chicken). The color from red onions is minimal. Turmeric and/or saffron are good coloring agents, but only if you want gold-colored curry (and even that can be muddled to a dour brown by well-cooked onions, browned meat, and/or dried spices like cumin and garam masala).  If presentation matters a lot and your guests expect vivid colors in the sauce itself, I dunno, I guess I don't think food coloring is so bad. But I'd rather just get people used to the ""natural"" coloration of home-cooked food, if they'll let me :-D"

IndianFood,2rxm85,monalisaescapes,3,Sat Jan 10 04:19:45 2015 UTC,"I use a different, but somewhat similar recipe.  One thing I do is to use cumin seeds instead of powder.  I fry them in ghee with onions before adding other spices.  It might help to extract flavor and diffuse it throughout the dish.  I also use ginger-garlic paste.  I think grating the ginger and garlic also helps to extract flavor.  I only use a few tablespoons of heavy cream at the end as well as some lemon juice.  That's more to make it creamy than flavor, although I think the acid in the juice helps with the flavor somewhat."
IndianFood,2rxm85,BillyBalowski,3,Sat Jan 10 04:58:34 2015 UTC,I agree that mustard greens add a lot of depth to palak paneer.   To balance the dish out you might consider also adding methi leaves.   They are best if you can find fresh leaves but dried work almost as well. I made this dish without methi leaves and felt like I was eating lawn clippings.   The addition of methi  (fenugreek)  leaves balances the dish nicely.  Using ghee as cooking oil is also key to the fresh flavor you are looking for.
IndianFood,2rxm85,ninthinning01,2,Sat Jan 10 18:59:01 2015 UTC,"Recipe #1 (http://www.cookingandme.com/2013/01/palak-paneer-recipe-spinach-paneer.html):   *1 cup of cubed paneer (how to make paneer at home) {I used store bought} *1 large bunch of palak (or green spinach) *1 onion, chopped *1 tsp of minced garlic *1/2 tsp of minced ginger *1 tsp of red chilli powder *1 tsp of coriander powder *1/2 tsp of jeera (cumin) powder *1/4 tsp of turmeric powder *1 large pinch of kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) {Could not find these at the local Indo-Pak grocery store} *1 tsp of garam masala *2 tsp of ghee (or oil) *1 pinch of hing (or asafoetida) {Nor could I find this at the Indo-Pak} *1 heaping tsp of tomato paste (or 1 pureed tomato) - optional *1 cup of milk (or water) *1 tbsp of plain curd (or yogurt) - optional"
IndianFood,2rxm85,2Cuil4School,3,Sat Jan 10 04:21:11 2015 UTC,"Check online. I like Patel Brothers (http://www.patelbros.com), who have an online store. The redditor /u/chromiselda runes a really nice spice shop called Regency Spices that has asafoetida, but it is whole chunks of the hardened resin, which might be a bit much for starting out. Amazon even has some, IIRC.  Anyways, for different preparations, both of the ingredients you mention having trouble finding (asafoetida and qasuri methi) can be very important. . . but there are also recipes that lack them entirely! Since this is such a common, much-replicated dish, it can be very hard to nail down what one specific restaurant puts in theirs without a lot of experimentation.  I'll generally say that a lot of palak paneer I've had over the year is pretty heavy on garlic. VahChef and others note that Nutmeg goes really well w/ Spinach, so maybe try adding a dash of that to see if it's what you lack. VahChef in particular also really likes a lot of green chilies in his preparation, and they do add a lovely flavor. . .   Oh, and finally, the best saags/palaks I've had in restaurants go pretty heavy on butter (and/or ghee) and salt--probably more than you're thinking of adding."
IndianFood,2rxm85,furgots,1 point,Mon Jan 12 16:40:11 2015 UTC,"The milk and curd may be seriously ""washing out"" all of the heat and spice in your already lightly-spiced palak.

I would triple or quadruple (!!) the amount of garlic, coriander, cumin, garam masala, for example. Seriously. Don't be shy with  those spices. Also, don't be shy with salt.

This is crucial. I'm surprised you couldn't find it in your local Indian spice store. Also you really need to carmelize the onion, very slowly until it's a dark golden color. Also, don't overcook the greens, should just reach a bright color before blending. I also use 2% Greek yogurt and no milk. Making your own paneer is really easy too if you have whole milk, cheesecloth and lemon. Restaurants also use a ton of salt."
IndianFood,2rxm85,ChaosMotor,3,Sat Jan 10 06:37:11 2015 UTC,I also use 2% Greek yogurt   Dahi or gtfo.
IndianFood,2rxm85,kochipoik,2,Sat Jan 10 09:31:34 2015 UTC,"This is the recipe I'm making tonight which is pretty darned good. It's from the Little India (NZ) cookbook. I've summarised the instructions.   4 bunches spinach, chopped (I have no idea what they mean by this. I've been using a combination of silver beet, spinach +/- kale that I get from my CSA box, approx 300-400g, might be a bit much) 3 Tbsp canola oil 1 tsp cumin seeds 1 onion, finely diced 1 Tbsp crushed fresh ginger 1 Tbsp crushed fresh garlic 1 tsp turmeric 1.5 tsp garam masala 1 tsp salt 3 medium tomatoes, diced 1/2 c cream 400g paneer, cut into 2x2cm cubes (homemade for me) Salt and red chilli powder to tate Chopped fresh coriander to garnish (optional)   Steam the spinach and blend until it forms a smooth paste.  Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and cook until you can smell them. Add onion, stirring continuously and cook until almost brown. Stir in garlic and ginger and cook until soft/brown. Add turmeric, garam masala and salt and cook until you start to smell the spice aromas.  Stir through the tomato and keep cooking until you start to see oil separating from onion and spice mixture. Be sure to take your time with this and keep stirring so that it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan. This is called a Tarka.  Add spinach paste and cook until the spinach is fully heated through. Turn down heat and stir through cream, then slowly increase the heat again so the cream doesn't curdle.  Add the cubed paneer and cook until it's heated through and soft, ~5 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and chilli powder. Garnish with coriander if you want."
IndianFood,2rxm85,Cooksocial,1 point,Sat Jan 10 05:35:27 2015 UTC,I do not like to use coriander leaves anyway in the recipe as I think this over powers the smell and taste of Spinach. Sometimes the quantity of coriander leaves contradict the taste of the recipe. Other than that the recipe is good enough to go:)
IndianFood,2rxm85,kochipoik,1 point,Tue Jan 13 13:25:54 2015 UTC,In the recipe or for garnish? This one doesn't have any coriander cooked into it
IndianFood,2rxm85,Cooksocial,1 point,Tue Jan 13 18:17:18 2015 UTC,"I understand. Even if the recipe does not contain coriander, we should not divulge into adding coriander for garnishing purpose. According to me, the garnishing of any recipe should go along with the taste of the recipe; it should prompt gourmets to smoke the recipe from outside even before tasting the actual recipe :)"

IndianFood,2rurz9,nenid,5,Fri Jan 9 13:28:44 2015 UTC,That looks really good. My only suggestion is adding green cardomen to the gravy. A couple pods smashed up or the seeds hulled and toasted then ground with the rest of your spices. Sooo good.

Adding yogurt is quite common in some Indian dishes, although I usually eyeball the quantity or use it as a marinade. Adding water will just make it more soggy. However, since you cooked a day ahead (its true it will taste better tomorrow), the excess yogurt may dry out/get absorbed."

IndianFood,2rm8ya,Yellowbenzene,3,Thu Feb 5 12:10:20 2015 UTC,I'm going to try this.  Regarding the rice (which I always overcook in a biryani) - should each grain have an undercooked centre at the end of boiling?
IndianFood,2rm8ya,astrograph,5,Wed Jan 7 11:32:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, rice should be slightly undercooked, as i said around 80% cooked. Also soaking rice for some time helps. To prevent from over cooking, drain the water immediately as rice keeps cooking in hot water. I hope it turns out perfect this time"
IndianFood,2rm8ya,Captn_Aubrey,3,Wed Jan 7 13:15:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll give that a go next time.  I think my issue was that I fully cooked the rice causing it to overcook when I added the other ingredients."

IndianFood,2ri7pz,Mike_uxo,2,Tue Jan 6 12:49:57 2015 UTC,One thing to note - it cannot wet-grind. It's only for dry spices. No pastes.

IndianFood,2ri7pz,mango4mouse,1 point,Tue Jan 6 14:17:34 2015 UTC,"If you're interested, I just got a Preethi Eco Twin for Christmas from my girlfriend. I've made dosa batter (including grinding about 3/4 cup of dal and about 2 cups of rice total, in batches) and two chutneys (tomato and coconut) so far and have found it to be an absolute pleasure to use.  The dosa, which used to take 3-4 minutes to grind into a fairly fine pate in my cheapo blender, now breaks down in under a minute (usually under 30s). Even though I used smaller batches in the Preethi than I did in my old blender, the whole process went by much faster.  Furthermore, it broke down the coconut in my chutney way better, resulting in awesome, light, airy chutney that I enjoyed two big spoonfuls of on top of an egg dosa this very morning :-D    Word of warning, if you get one, and I made a mistake with mine: the coupler (plastic thing at the bottom of the big mixer jar) you hold onto to unscrew the blade also comes out itself (they are replaceable). Basically, the blade unscrews if you try to turn it all one way, but the coupler unscrews if you turn it the other way with a lot of force. I forgot which way the blade turned to be removed, so ended up pushing a little hard since I thought it was jammed, and unscrewed the coupler by accident.  It's a little hard to picture (or maybe I just suck at describing it--the coupler is on the bottom of the jar, and a metal rod--which the blade screws onto--extends up from it into the jar. The blade and coupler both move freely, and you unscrew one by sort of clamping down on the other and turning it), but anyway, I was taken by surprise when I tried to pull the blade off and had my coupler fall out the bottom of the jar by accident, instead.  So surprised that I didn't notice one of the little ceramic washers hit the ground, so I stepped on it and broke it. There were two more, which seem intact, and I put it all back together and it works fine, but it might not be quite as tight a fit as it should have been. Oops!.    TL;DR: Wet-dry grinders are the bomb-diggity and I totally recommend one. Just don't try to operate it without reading the instructions fully like I did :("

IndianFood,2ri7pz,Horris_The_Horse,1 point,Wed Jan 7 10:02:01 2015 UTC,The question we need to know is why you want to upgrade your pestle and mortar?  For instance do you want consistent size?  Do you find your pestle / mortar (I forget what one is the stick) heavy?   I ask as I enjoy using my pestle and mortar but it could be annoying if I'm grinding constantly.  If we know why you want to change your equipment it will help us with identifying a solution.

However,  if you're looking for a consistent small powder,  you could be grinding for a while and you would be better off  with an electric coffee / bean grinder.  These can be picked up for around £10 but I have no experience with them.  I always use my mortar and pestle,  especially since this can be used for wet ingredients (leaves,  garlic, ginger,  drops of water) as well."

IndianFood,2rdw06,distractedbunny,4,Mon Jan 5 16:35:59 2015 UTC,"I am gonna tell you how I learned masala tea. Recipe my mum follows, may not be a standard recipe though. Use Assam tea, first and foremost. I don't know how you are doing so I am going to describe very basically. Put water in a pot on stove. Water should be almost as much as you want final quantity of tea to be. If you want to have two cups of tea, put in two cups of water. Now put in the tea, this really depends on how dark/ what colour you want your tea to be, don't use too much Cs the method of masala chai makes it darker than normal tea. Put in sugar according to taste. When this water-tea-sugar mix boils once, put in whole milk 3/4 of the quantity you finally want to achieve.  Now take some ginger, little less than half your thumb, two cardamoms, one green tulsi leaf, three cloves, one or two dried black peppers..grind them with something heavy and make into a paste. Put this paste in your tea now and boil it again and again at least 4-5 times..all the while stirring it with a spoon or something so that it doesn't come out of the pot.you can use a little bit of dalchini too, if you want but just a little bit.  Masala tea is like ice tea, everybody has their own recipe. This is a north indian one. The key to masala tea I think is to add spices after you add milk and boiling it lots of times. All the best.

Mainly coz of all the spices that go into it. Most of the pickles are spicy and can be eaten with rice or rotis. Its an accompaniment to other dishes - sambar rice, curd rice, paratha and curd etc.   Plus what pickle do you get at the store? There is quite a bit difference between north indian, Gujarati, Andhra and Tamil Nadu pickles."

It is not sweet at all (although there is at least one variety of pickle that adds a lot of sugar to make it sweet).  It is very pungent, sour, hot, spicy, salty and oily.  There is nothing else to compare it to.  It's not like cucumber pickles at all.  I LOVE pickled mango though.  You add it to any dish you want to spice it up - daal, rice, vegetables, and it is amazing with paratha and plain yogurt.  Certainly there must be another store which sells smaller jars so that you can try it?  1 kg is kind of a lot.  Even though I love pickle, I don't love every type I buy.

IndianFood,2r87hl,tjwharry,6,Wed Jan 14 16:30:40 2015 UTC,"I made this recipe last night for my wife.  After reading the discussion here about chicken tikka masala I couldn't wait to apply some of the ideas to my recipe.  The result turned by out well.   Both breast meat and thigh meat were used.  The meat was cut into one inch cubes and marinated for ten hours.  We both like curry leaves so I used a long sprig.  The red food coloring is optional but it does give the dish a beautiful color.   Chicken Tikka Masala Recipe  Ingredients for marinade: 1 pint yogurt 1 tsp crushed methi leaves  1 Tbsp ginger-garlic paste  1 1/2 tsp powdered Kashmir chilies  2 tsp coriander/cumin powder  1 tsp garam masala  1/4 cup lemon juice  1 1/2 tsp salt. 3 boneless chicken breasts 4 boneless chicken thighs Cut chicken into 1"" cubes and marinate 3 Tbsp Ghee to sear chicken  Sauce:   1/2 cup chopped coriander  1 sprig of curry leaves  10 green chilies  1/2 cup tomato ketchup  3 Tbsp double concentrated tomato paste  1 pint canned tomatoes  1 can tomato paste  2 green cardamom pods, ground  4 black cardamom pods, ground  2 Tbsp garlic-ginger paste  1 Tbsp sugar  3 pieces of cinnamon bark  1 tsp garam masala  1 tsp methi leaves, ground  2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice  2 tsp Kashmir chili powder  2 purple onions  2 Tbsp cashew butter  2 Tbsp cream 1/4 cup yogurt 1 Tbsp ghee 1-2 cups water  Also: 2 cups basmatti rice  Method:      Chop and Brown Onions in 1 Tbsp Ghee.  This was done for personal preference.  In the discussion thread there were several different techniques suggested for cooking the onions.  Chop Green Chilies.  Here many green chilies were used because we both like our food hot.  Any amount from 2 or more is good depending on you taste. Add Sprig of Curry Leaves.  We like curry leaves so many are used here.  Use the amount you like. Add Dry Spices, ginger garlic paste cook until raw garlic smell passes. Add tomato paste.  Here a can of tomatoe paste and 2 Tbsp of tomato paste concentrate are used. Puree Tomatoes and Add to Pot. Add sugar,  lemon juice and cashew butter.  Simmer Tomato sauce for 20 Minutes to reduce sauce a little.  Add Cream   Add Red Food Coloring (optional).  Sear Marinated Chicken.  Sear the chicken in hot ghee and cook about 75 percent.  Add Chicken to Pot and Simmer for 20-30 Minutes.  Add Yogurt (optional).  Simmer for 5 more minutes. Serve with basmati rice and butter paratha."

Ethnic food suppliers used the cheapest plastic and foil they can find, and some of the smaller brands have almost no quality control.  A lot of the smaller brands are someone with a kitchen and sealing machine in their garage or basement.  Hopefully the situation is better in the five or so years since she told us, but I've met lots of people that make pani puris, rotis and parathas, snacks, etc in a residential garage, have no inspections or real quality control, and sell primarily to Indian grocery stores."

IndianFood,2qukrx,lobster_johnson,0,Tue Dec 30 22:06:08 2014 UTC,"My opinion: Not good recipes. There are so many bad tikka masala recipes out there.  Way too much cream and coconut milk, neither of which are necessary. Not enough onion by far (which is the thing that northern Indian cooking is based on), and 5 minutes is not enough to properly sweat the onions. No roasting of spices, and not enough spices by far. Also, way too much cardamom and cloves (neither of which you need much of for tikka masala). And the ingredients aren't blended, so you'll end up with this chunky, messy, inelegant thing, not a smooth sauce.  Way too many recipes suggest using a ton of cream. Not necessary to get a full-bodied, smooth sauce. What you want is onion, which is a natural thickener once it has been blended — you'll want to sweat the onions for an hour or so before blending them, which completely changes their flavour profile — and just a few tablespoons of yoghurt, also a natural thickener. A few tablespoons of heavy cream can help, but it's not necessary.  The recipe I use is from this wonderful book, which is by an actual British chef. Basically as follows:   Onion gravy base. This is, at its most basic, sweated onions + lots of neutral vegetable oil + fresh chili + some tomatoes + garam masala, cooked for about 90 minutes and then blended until perfectly smooth. The base smells like old gym socks and has a brown, goopy, unappealing exterior. It's used as the base for the actual sauce. Tikka masala sauce base. This is yogurt + tomato paste + spice paste + red food dye. Voigt uses a combination of several off-the-shelf Indian spice pastes as a shortcut. Final sauce = heat onion base, add a few spoonfuls of tikka masala sauce base + ginger-garlic paste + garam masala + coconut powder (aka coconut flour) + a couple of tablespoons of fenugreek leaves + crumbled paneer (optional, but does wonders) + a little heavy cream to finish. Garnish with coriander (cilantro) leaves.   (This is a gross simplification. For full recipe, please refer to the book.)"
IndianFood,2qukrx,aaarrrggh,4,Tue Dec 30 22:32:18 2014 UTC,"Always willing to try an assortment of recipe variations, but I specifically stated that the flavor profile I'm familiar with (and this seeking out to make at home) is a sweeter, coconut flavor.   Learning, from both this sub and several brief google searches, that there is no true ""correct"" recipe kind of helps resolve the issue of me thinking I'm doing something wrong in the kitchen.   But, thanks for the info on some Indian cooking basics. Will definitely work with more onions ( I will never say no to more onions). :)"
IndianFood,2qukrx,lobster_johnson,3,Tue Dec 30 23:03:37 2014 UTC,"And remember,it's considered sacrilegious to use white onions when cooking curry! But its done all the time in the west,so there's that! Lol"
IndianFood,2qukrx,aaarrrggh,1 point,Wed Dec 31 00:09:48 2014 UTC,"For sweetness, add sugar. It's that simple. Most tikka masala recipes state to add sugar. British restaurants also use coconut powder (aka coconut flour; not the same as desiccated coconut flakes), which adds some gentle sweetness."

IndianFood,2qukrx,Th0mX,-2,Wed Dec 31 01:18:22 2014 UTC,"Chicken tikka masala is absolutely an authentic Indian dish. It's butter chicken with boneless chicken, that's all.  There is a lot of confusion because two British restaurants have claimed to have invented it, while at the same time there is a pervasive myth about a customer in the 1970s wanting gravy with his dry chicken tikka, and about a chef who improvised with a can of Campbell's tomato soup and Indian spices. It's patently false: Butter chicken was invented at the Moti Mahal café in Delhi in the early 70s. They still exist, and they still make it.  And it's exactly the same thing: Chicken tikka with a rich, creamy tomato-based sauce. Which is the template (if not definition) for tikka masala as well as butter chicken. Of course there is no standard, as dishes go; but modifications such as adding bell peppers or not making the sauce creamy would be huge deviations from the norm.  Chicken tikka, of course, is a North-Indian dish, often associated with Punjab. Nowaways, tikka masala and butter chicken (with chicken pieces) are both on the menu, even though they are the same dish. I have asked several restaurant what they do to differentiate them, and the answer is usually that butter chicken has ""more butter, crumbled paneer"" or something similar and insignificant. There is no difference otherwise.  Anyway, my point in my previous comment was the recipes are simply poor. Not enough spices, not enough onion, etc. — I have previously tried to make a bunch of these odd recipes that claim to reproduce a creamy tikka masala, and they are all failures. Having struggled a lot before I finally cracked ""the code"", I can now glance at any recipe and easily see what is missing.  The principles are basically:   A lot of onions. Sweat them, purée them. That's what gives you the creamy sauce without lots of carbs and fats from things like cream. Ginger-garlic paste. Absolutely essential. Use tomato paste, not raw tomatoes. Much more concentrated. Fenugreek leaves. It adds magic to an otherwise average dish. Plenty of spices. Most recipes don't use enough. Purée your ingredients. By blending, you create an even flavour profile; you won't taste chunks of garlic separately from bits of cardamom or whatever."
IndianFood,2qukrx,jackruby83,2,Wed Dec 31 05:11:00 2014 UTC,"Sorry, but no, Tikka Masala is a British dish. It was exported back to India from Britain. It's not even disputed."
IndianFood,2qukrx,boss_of_shorty,1 point,Tue Dec 30 23:27:25 2014 UTC,"Butter chicken's origin in Delhi in the 70s is undisputed, and there are other similar dishes recorded in Bangladesh before tikka masala appeared on British menus. Anyone who has tried a good butter chicken can attest to the fact that it's basically the same dish. Of course, butter chicken may have been accidentally reinvented in British kitchens, which makes its provenance a gray area; but that in itself doesn't make it a British dish. Anyway, you might want to listen to Heston Blumenthal, one of the world's finest chefs, who did a whole program on tikka masala to discover its roots and to replicate it in his own kitchen. One may also want to listen to Julie Sahni, one of the legends of Indian cooking (her ""Classic Indian Cooking"" is, well, a classic)."
IndianFood,2qukrx,neel2004,3,Wed Dec 31 00:12:39 2014 UTC,"Butter Chicken is indeed authentic Indian, but I don't agree that it's the same dish as Tikka Masala. It's definitely similar, but it's not the same.  Anyway, thanks for the doc. I'll probably check that out."

It's a quirky little ebook written by an actual chef -- of a small British Indian (""BIR"") restaurant that serves takeaway. The recipes are top notch; he's not spewing marketing bullshit when he says they provide the ""secret"" to the most common dishes such as tikka masala.  The book is a little odd in that it's scaled to restaurant batches, but he provides smaller batch sizes. However, it does mean that he breaks dishes into reusable components: Tikka masala sauce, for example, is based on the onion gravy base (absolutely essential in many dishes) + ginger-garlic paste (same here) and a tikka masala sauce paste, plus some additional ingredients such as fenugreek leaves and coconut powder.

You can season it just like you would any rice dishes.  I imagine biriyani flavors or pulao flavors would be delicious.    Happy cooking!"
IndianFood,2qfwv1,GujuGanjaGirl,2,Fri Dec 26 13:47:13 2014 UTC,Ah ok! Thank you for sharing your thoughts:) I have one more question to ask. Did you ever try cooking Quinoa in Biriyani flavor? Does the smell of typical Biriyani come out good off the recipe considering it has strong nutty flavor?
IndianFood,2qfwv1,GujuGanjaGirl,1 point,Fri Dec 26 14:21:51 2014 UTC,I think it would but I have never tried it before.  It would taste similar but of course not the same due to be a different grain.  Hope that helps :)

The way I've had it is with a mix of currants, some berries, and nuts mixed with it. They cook really fast and have a nice mouth feel.   I have not eaten it using Indian spices though. Only more blander mixes like basic salt and pepper."

IndianFood,2qfwv1,texture,2,Sat Dec 27 06:11:26 2014 UTC,"It's extremely filling, like wild rice. If I could eat it, I'd substitute it for rice in a smaller proportion than the rice the recipes call for."

Great as a dessert at the end of the meal."

And don't forget to end your meal with Gulab Jamun/Rasgulla or Jalebi if the restaurant serves it.   P.S. Indian couple would probably not prefer dal-rice on something like a date. :)"

IndianFood,2qdn5k,purple_brains,2,Sat Jan 31 21:09:39 2015 UTC,"For starters, go with the kebabs and tandoori mushrooms - if available. Some simple papad and green chutney is also great.   Main course, order the cottage cheese/paneer since that isn't usually all that spicy, along with a basic butter chicken or chicken tikka. Some dal (lentils) along with Jeera Rice or Steamed Rice works really well!   And then for dessert, order something on the lines of Kulfi (ice-cream) or Gulab Jamun."

Entrees: I'd suggest 2-3 entrees for the two of you depending on the size and whether you're okay with sharing. Go with tarka dal, or dal makhani, both of these will be a bit milder but have a great flavor. Get the chana masala, since it's just awesome and should come with rice. For the third item, let her choose anything that looks interesting to her as this will ensure you've got two sure fire hits, and one 'exciting' dish that you didn't choose.  You should also get TWO pieces of garlic naan, even if they tell you that they are large, get two, worst case you have leftover naan.  From there you can move on to dessert if you want to, but I usually don't."

IndianFood,2q4s2f,2Cuil4School,6,Tue Dec 23 02:16:31 2014 UTC,"The Recipe  Welcome to another edition of delicious Indian food with your host, /u/2Cuil4School :). Today, I'm going to be making Pav Bhaji, a classic street food dish that's decadently delicious--a spicy-sweet vegetable curry tinged with citrus and creamy with butter, served atop (or beside) spicy fried sweet yeast buns.  Ingredients   Yeast Buns (Publix dinner rolls are perfect, but Sara Lee sweet Hawaiian-style were on sale, sooo) 1 stick of Butter, divided (give or take) 1 tsp of Cumin Seeds 2 Small Red Onions, diced 1 tbsp of Ginger-Garlic Paste (or, 1.5tsp each minced Ginger & Garlic) 2-4 Small Green Chilies, diced (Jalepenos, Seranos, Thai, etc.) 2-3 Large Carrots, diced 1 Green Bell Pepper, diced 1 tbsp of Pav Bhaji Masala 1/2 tsp of Turmeric Powder 1-2 tsp of Red Chili Powder (Kashmiri for less heat), plus more for frying Salt to Taste (at least 1 tsp) 2 Cans of Diced Tomatoes (or ~7-8 Roma Tomatoes, diced) (Optional) 1 tbsp of Kasuri Methi (dried Fenugreek leaves), powdered by hand 1 Bunch of Cilantro, washed and chopped, stems removed 1 cup of Green Peas (frozen or fresh) 3-4 Small Russet/Idaho Potatoes, boiled, peeled, and cut into large chunks 1/2 Head of Cauliflower, cut into chunks and boiled Lemon Juice Water   Directions  In a large pot, boil your potatoes and cauliflower until soft (fork pierces them easily). You can peel/chop the potatoes before or after boiling, at your preference. In either case, drain these vegetables and set aside.  In a large pot, dutch oven, or very wide, deep-set skillet, heat 2 tbsp of butter (ideally unsalted) until melted and the fizz has mostly died down, over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them fizzle and splutter, then add the diced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften (3-4 minutes).  Add the ginger-garlic paste and green chilies and cook another 1-2 minutes to reduce the raw flavors of the ginger and garlic. Add the diced carrots and bell pepper and cook an extra 3-4 minutes, then add the pav bhaji masala, red chili, turmeric, and salt. Stir to combine, then pour in the tomatoes before the spices begin to burn.  If your tomatoes are relatively ""dry,"" you may need to add a little water at this time. Bring the mixture to a heavy simmer and cook, covered and stirring very occasionally, for 10-12 minutes, or until the tomatoes have softened up and are beginning to get mashed up.  Add the kasuri methi powder, if using, as well as the cilantro (about 2 tbsp for now), green peas, and the boiled, chopped potatoes and cauliflower. You may need to add water here to keep the mixture from burning--you're looking for a thick, stew-like texture, and the potatoes are going to absorb a lot of moisture as they mix in. I also tend to mix in a little extra butter at this stage to achieve a perfect silky consistency--about 2 tbsp more.  Cook the mixture for another 5-10 minutes at a simmer, then use a potato masher to mash up the majority of the vegetables. A relatively ""fine"" one like the one pictured in the album will work best for this.  Set the pav bhaji masala (what you've just made) aside.  When you're ready to serve, heat 1 tbsp of butter in a wide skillet over medium heat until it melts. If you like spicy food, shake a few dashes of red chili powder into the butter, then cover immediately with 3-4 of your buns, sliced in half and laid cut-side down in the butter. Cook them until they become crispy and golden brown, then flip and cook the other side another minute or two.  In the same, or a different skillet, heat another tablespoon of butter. Ladle in approximately 1 cup worth of your bhaji. If it's become thick, add a little water. Heat it through till bubbling, and then mix in a little lemon juice and fresh cilantro. Serve with the buns and eat!"

IndianFood,2q4s2f,omkaram,2,Tue Dec 23 03:02:03 2014 UTC,How will the recipe work without onions? Don't really like them
IndianFood,2q4s2f,j_juggernaut,2,Tue Dec 23 14:00:58 2014 UTC,"Mostly okay. In a lot of Indian curries, onions serve two roles: aromatics/flavor, and texture/sauce.  If you don't mind the taste so much, I'd recommend a sprinkle of onion powder with the other powdered spices (pav bhaji masala, red chili, turmeric). I'd also slightly increase some of the veggies--maybe tomatoes and potatoes--to give the curry more body.  if you don't mind the texture so much, consider perhaps using a milder-tasting onion alternative, like shallots or leeks. It won't be super authentic, but at least there will still be something in there providing texture to the sauce (in a good curry, the onions will ""melt"" into the gravy, giving it a richer, silkier texture)."
IndianFood,2q4s2f,j_juggernaut,2,Tue Dec 23 15:20:14 2014 UTC,Thanks for the posts! I love pav bhaji and I need to figure out how to make it too... Guess I should start using onion powder. Will it work in other dishes too?
IndianFood,2q4s2f,zem,2,Wed Dec 24 02:20:16 2014 UTC,"Depends on the dish, mostly. Something like a korma (where onion is the bulk of the sauce) might seem a little thin, and something like vindaloo, which relies on caramelized onion flavor, would be tough. Other stuff would work very well, I think, like butter chicken. Good luck! :-)"

No doubt far from the best (or cheapest spices) you can find in India.

I used the fresh ghee to cook her favorite dish,  paneer butter masala.   Then the house smelled like cooking spices,  browning onions, ginger garlic and adjwain basmati rice.  I'm a lucky man.   There are jars of fermenting vegetables,  gallons of fermenting vinegars and bubbling wines in our house.   The unusual smells don't bother her. Personally I enjoy all the cooking smells and fermentation smells."

IndianFood,2pim1h,2Cuil4School,2,Wed Dec 17 22:31:14 2014 UTC,"Very lucky. My little apartment has very poor ventilation (all the windows are sealed shut, and bees infest the little balcony porch we have, so we never open the door to it; our front door just opens to a ""lobby,"" so no ventilation there, either), and my girlfriend hang-dries a lot of her clothes to help them last longer, so I need to be very careful about my kitchen adventures :("
IndianFood,2pim1h,Mike_uxo,7,Thu Dec 18 15:33:06 2014 UTC,Making ghee at home creates a real cost savings over store bought ghee.  To make ghee you will need four pounds of butter and a heavy bottomed pot.  The butter is brought to a boil and cooked on medium high temperature for 4 minutes until a fine thick foam forms on top.  At this point turn down the heat to medium and continue to cook for 10 to 15 minutes.  A second foam will form.  Cook until golden color is achieved.  Pour through cheese clothe into jar.  4 pounds of butter yields 2 quarts of ghee. Cost savings is 3:1.
IndianFood,2pim1h,Mike_uxo,2,Tue Dec 16 23:00:13 2014 UTC,Question - pouring it through the cheese cloth - are you not separating the milk solids from the butter?
IndianFood,2pim1h,AntiMe,1 point,Wed Dec 17 09:45:09 2014 UTC,Yes.   Separating the milk solids is the goal.   The water is driven off quickly during boiling.   The butter continues to a boil for ten to fifteen  minutes to brown the milk solids causing them to drop to the bottom of the pot.   The ghee is carefully poured into jars leaving the browned milk solids in the pot. When cooking food the ghee can be heated to very high temperature without burning or breaking down.   Ghee and  coconut oil are the two best oils for high temperature cooking as they don't break down.
IndianFood,2pim1h,ahandle,3,Wed Dec 17 11:12:36 2014 UTC,"ghee    ah, gotcha, i was under the impression that the milk solids were blended back in after the simmering. Guess i was mistaken.  One other thing though - using butter fat to oil your breadboards - surely you risk them going rancid."
IndianFood,2pim1h,mythrowaway9000,3,Wed Dec 17 11:57:06 2014 UTC,"There's actually not much risk of ghee going rancid.  It doesn't even need refrigerated.  That said, I personally use mineral oil for wooden boards."

IndianFood,2pim1h,boba-boba,3,Wed Dec 17 13:57:41 2014 UTC,"Do you use the strained milk solids for anything? If I made my own ghee I'd be obsessing over ways to still use what (in my opinion) is the tastiest part of the butter! I guess by the end of this the milk solids end up fairly browned - the flavour of these browned milk solids are a main part of the reason for making beurre noisette.   I wonder whether these would be good added back into various curry dishes towards the end of cooking (Butter Chicken perhaps), or maybe used in place of solid butter when making a dark roux?"
IndianFood,2pim1h,Hero_Of_Sandwich,4,Wed Dec 17 11:39:45 2014 UTC,"Yes,   I save the solids and use to make roux.   The browned milk solids add a unique dimension to gravey and sauces.  They are my secret ingredient in ranchero sauce in huevos rancheros."

In case you add extra ginger-garlic, squeeze some fresh lemon juice in your dish. It will help balance the taste.   And for excess salt, you may add boiled potato pieces or use ceramic dish/teacup technique."
IndianFood,2p965f,eldaisfish,2,Sun Dec 14 13:51:51 2014 UTC,use ceramic dish/teacup technique.   can you elaborate please?
IndianFood,2p965f,Jennyra,2,Sun Dec 14 19:36:45 2014 UTC,"Simply place a clean ceramic dish or teacup in your curry for a couple of minutes and it will absorb the salt, just like the potatoes.  I learned this technique from a travel food show where the restaurant chef was revealing his secret.   Scientifically, the ceramic materials do have the tendency to absorb the soluble salts.  Having said that, I'd still recommend to use ghee or potatoes as it's more hygienic option. The teacup technique should be your last-minute option when you go wrong while making large no. of dishes."

IndianFood,2omprx,coldcoldnovemberrain,1 point,Tue Dec 9 04:02:43 2014 UTC,It seems many of the dishes required vegetables to be well cooked and are generally served in red tomato gravy or turmeric infused gracy which hides the characteristics of the vegetables.   Any suggestions for recipes or serving styles which would display the colorful vegetables that are part of Indian cuisine.
IndianFood,2omprx,2Cuil4School,1 point,Mon Dec 8 20:40:52 2014 UTC,"To ramp off of /u/mauv, try (perhaps) aloo gobi (potato & cauliflower in a dry, yellowish curry w/ bright tomato chunks), bhindi fry (okra stir fry), and karela fry (if you like bitter veggies), as they are all fairly dry curries where the vegetables themselves are big stars.  A good saag/palak will of course clearly show the bright, healthy green of your spinach/methi/etc.  Also, pachadis (yogurt-and-coconut-based dishes from S. India, if I recall right) are a good base for showing colorful veggies all on their own, like this one.  I'd also say a good vegetable korma will let your veggies shine, particularly if you don't make the sauce very thick. While it's still got some turmeric to it, the cream and/or cashew nut paste common in them make it a very pale, milky gravy that lets veggies shine through."

IndianFood,2omprx,licoricesnocone,1 point,Tue Dec 9 18:40:52 2014 UTC,"I have a ton of spices, but everything I make turns out bland or over powered by turmeric. Help."
IndianFood,2omprx,2Cuil4School,3,Tue Dec 9 03:35:07 2014 UTC,"The spices could be getting old (esp. if you brought pre-powdered and they are a year or two old by now), which reduces flavor.  Also, it's usually helpful to dry roast or even oil-fry many spices (and some react to the two processes differently!) to help unlock their true flavors, so giving the spices time ""on their own"" to cook before adding other ingredients is an essential part of some recipes (like the tarkas added to many foods).  Furthermore, I find that dairy tends to deaden the flavor of many dishes, particularly cream (yogurt is at least a little tangy). Substituting it for coconut cream or a cashew nut paste might retain a little more flavor.  Oh, and sometimes, a lack of good flavor is just a matter of seasoning: try adjusting the amount of salt you add to the recipe to see if that helps!  Finally, just upping the quantity of other spices in comparison to turmeric can help, though you'll want to adjust slowly! :)"

IndianFood,2odynn,brobrobroccoli,2,Fri Dec 5 18:57:11 2014 UTC,"Recreated this one from a vegetable curry I got at an Indian restaurant. Not sure if that one even had courgettes in it - definitely had okra though - but I felt like they would fit the taste of this one. Turned out pretty much just like that veg-curry. It has a nice tangy sweet and sour thing going on.  Enough talking, RECIPE:   1 kg courgettes, cut into matchsticks, slices or any shape you want 1 onion, finely diced 1 tin of chopped tomatoes or the equivalent in fresh tomatoes 2-3 cloves garlic, finely diced 1-1.5 tsp grated ginger green chilies to taste 1/2 tsp cumin seeds 1/2 tsp mustard seeds 1/2 tsp coriander powder 1/2 tsp turmeric 1 tsp amchur 1/2 tsp garam masala 1 tsp sugar juice of half a lemon small bunch of cilantro salt to taste 1/2 vegetable stock cube (optional) 1-2 tbsp oil   Heat oil, add mustard seeds. When they start popping, add cumin seeds and fry a little bit. Add onion and garlic with some salt, fry until lightly to well browned. Add ginger and chilies, fry off for about half a minute and add tomatoes along with turmeric and coriander powder. Cook until mushy and thickened, then add courgettes and enough water to just coat them. At this point add your stock cube or not (tasted kinda bland without it), your sugar and amchur. Cook until the courgettes are soft to mushy depending on your personal taste, check the seasoning. Remove from heat, add the garam masala, lemon juice and some chopped or roughly torn coriander, stir and serve."
IndianFood,2ob2ox,mistergreen,5,Thu Dec 4 23:05:11 2014 UTC,"If you don't have a pressure cooker its no big deal. What I do is I just cook the food with water as suggested, maybe add more if it gets evaporated. Make sure to cook on low heat and keep the pot covered for a while. It takes longer, but eventually your daal and vegetables should be cooked. The only reason people use pressure cooker is it reduces cooking time drastically since it uses pressure and heat. So use this as another user suggested but on low heat and with a light lid instead. Keep stirring every now and then, and add water as necessary. Good luck!"

IndianFood,2ob2ox,Evolutionarybiologer,2,Fri Dec 5 02:03:11 2014 UTC,I have cooked daal without pressure cooker. See my other comment. Without the pressure cooker it just takes longer. It may not taste exactly the same but it is not a huge compromise.
IndianFood,2ob2ox,tarunteam,2,Fri Dec 5 02:07:07 2014 UTC,"Yea...realistically a pressure cooker dramatically decreases the cooking time. I'd suggest letting whatever lentils your cooking soak in water over night before you cook them. The idea with pressure cooker is that it forces water in by increasing the pressure. You can achieve the same results with a long soaking period beforehand. However, remember restaurant dishes tend to be more one the greasy, unhealthy side. Traditional Indian cooking won't taste like restaurant cooking because it tends to use less oil, fat and less spices for cooking."
IndianFood,2ob2ox,readmethings,2,Fri Dec 5 03:08:01 2014 UTC,"Pressure cookers really do help seal in the flavours and also help cut down on cooking time, but! it is possible to cook all kinds of Indian food (especially dal) without one.  Here's a pretty great Sanjeev Kapoor recipe that I've used when at university and nowhere near a pressure cooker: http://www.sanjeevkapoor.com/recipe/Dhansak.html   Hope that works for you and is closer to the flavours you're hoping to recreate.

IndianFood,2o98h6,major_lugo,3,Thu Dec 4 12:59:16 2014 UTC,"If you find it too tart, you can also switch the culture by using a few spoons of greek natural yogurt. You won't need anything else to get it going.  In cold weather, we usually warm up the milk very slightly, mix in the culture, and pour it in an insulated casserole, leave it to set overnight (don't move it at all), and place it in the fridge in the morning once set."
IndianFood,2o98h6,kartoos,3,Thu Dec 4 14:16:22 2014 UTC,"Thanks! I actually like it really tart. We're getting some preservers to mix in with it to give it to our kids, as they won't eat it plain."
IndianFood,2o98h6,zookeeper94,3,Thu Dec 4 14:19:59 2014 UTC,"Hi,   I'm a student living in Canada and if you live outside India in a cold environment, you need to make it slightly differently than would normally be done.   Here's how I do it:    Take a sachet of milk (usually the 3.25% one - it gives thicker yoghurt) and pour the whole packet into a glass container (microwaveable).  I put said glass container inside a microwave and heat for 5 minutes on the highest power possible. You just need it to be warm. If it gets slightly too hot, let it cool down.  I then put the yoghurt sample inside the glass container and then close it.  HERE's the TRICK: I leave a rice cooker on the WARM mode and then put the glass container inside a small towel and put the entire thing inside the rice cooker.  I turn of the rice cooker every 1:30 mins for 30 mins of heating. I repeat the process until 6 hours and then look at the thickness. If it is consisten and thick, I put it in the fridge for cooling. If not, I usually repeat the process for another 3 hours.    It takes a bit of effort. Something you can set a phone alarm for in the weekend and repeat but it keeps the milk warm throughout and that's what forms the best yoghurt."
IndianFood,2o98h6,dutchly,2,Thu Dec 4 22:10:49 2014 UTC,I make mine using a slowcooker.  I also add powdered milk to raise the protein content.  The stuff is delish.
IndianFood,2o98h6,elabuzz,2,Thu Dec 4 18:10:05 2014 UTC,"I've never added the probiotics, and I've had it turn out fine. Choose the plain version of your favorite yogurt, and you'll make a yogurt that tastes similar - you'll be adopting the same culture mix. Try other yogurts if you don't like how your first batch turns out.  My technique for keeping it warm is to put the yogurt in mason jars in a cooler with a heating pad. I fill any unused space with more mason jars filled with hot water. I have a probe thermometer sticking in there to make sure it's staying at around 100 degrees.  Alton Brown did a good episode of Good Eats on yogurt, and he had some really good tips."
IndianFood,2o98h6,elabuzz,6,Thu Dec 4 14:26:32 2014 UTC,"part of the reason we are doing it is for the probiotics for my daughter. Like I said, I've read some medical studies that show a link between gut bacteria and autism. Weird, right?  From what I read, if you just use regular yogurt culture, you are missing a lot of the other good probiotics, as a few of the main yogurt strains will win out over time, after you use the same starter for more than a few batches. So adding the probiotics to every batch helps keep the less powerful strains in the mix."
IndianFood,2o98h6,thesyntaxofthings,2,Thu Dec 4 14:30:15 2014 UTC,"Different brands of yogurts are going to have different strains, so you could just explore.

It is also very easy to make other fermented vegetables, your daughter might like pickles to start.  If you strain some of the whey from the yogurt you can use it as a starter to ferment veggies, just use a mason jar and cucumbers or cabbage to begin!  Shout out to /r/fermentation"
IndianFood,2o98h6,mykitchenodyssey,1 point,Thu Dec 4 19:47:36 2014 UTC,"Congratulations! You've likely started yourself on a lifelong (positively addictive) adventure.  We have a pot on the stove right now. Using a 2 gallon double boiler we can make a 1 gallon batch of yogurt. Used a yogurt maker before but the double boiler has really improved the process. After heating and inoculating I can leave the pot on the stove on low all day and the water jacket keeps the yogurt at a nice steady temperature. I have two probes for my kitchen thermometer and will put one in the yogurt and the other in the water so I can monitor the temperature of both all day.  To get some extra thick yogurt the easy way, just after inoculation I'll often set two glasses filled with 110F water inside to displace some of the milk/yogurt. After holding the yogurt at 105-110F for 12-16 hours I'll take the double-boiler insert that's now full of yogurt and put it straight into the fridge. The next day I'll parcel the finished yogurt out into mason jars; some get fruit preserves on the bottom, others are left plain for eating or cooking. The glasses of water are first gently removed drawing a large amount of whey into where they were sitting. This leaves a nice thick yogurt on top without having to do a bunch of straining. As I work my way down through the pot it gets thinner and thinner. When I get to the last bit of yogurt in the bottom of the pot it's sometimes really thin. I'll usually strain the last of the yogurt through muslin to make yogurt cheese, and save the whey for ""buttermilk"" biscuits or ""buttermilk"" fried chicken.  Having a wide variety of consistencies (very thick to very thin) on hand has been really nice. It works great for cooking, eating, making sauces or dressings, or as a substitute for sour cream or goat cheese."

Indian/western-known Indian Cuisine:   Cumin (and its powder) Coriander (Powder, usually) Chili Powder Garam Masala (Whole or Powder; Latter's Easier to Deal With) Turmeric Powder Ghee (Clarified Butter) Cilantro (Coriander plant) Yogurt (Plain, Whole Fat) Ginger Garlic Green Chilies Atta (Stoneground Wheat) Flour Maida (All Purpose White) Flour Tomatoes Onions Cream Basmati Rice (of course!)   The overwhelming bulk of N. Indian style recipes (particularly those popular in western hemisphere Indian restaurants) will be prepared using 1/2 - 3/4 of that list. Particularly, a mixture of turmeric, cumin, coriander, and chili powder will be added to many dishes. The aromatic base will usually consist of ginger, garlic, onions, and green chilies. Cilantro, cream, and/or garam masala are commonly used as ""finishers"" at the end of a dish. Tomatoes or onions often provide the bulk and texture of curry sauces. Atta or maida can be used to prepare the most popular Indian breads. Ghee is a common cooking fat (alongside plain old oil), and yogurt is a common marinade and sauce component.  Like others have recommended, pick a few recipes you'd like to cook and seek out their common ingredients. A lot of what I wrote up there (onions, garlic, ginger, cream, tomatoes, yogurt, cilantro) are widely available around the world, so the real trick will be getting a set of spices together (the turmeric/cumin/coriander/chili powder blend I mentioned is damn-near foolproof).  Since bulk whole spices are so much cheaper than pre-powdered, investing in a coffee or spice grinder early on and getting many spices whole (even ones you usually use powdered, like coriander seed) will save you money, though not necessarily time :)  Other things to consider picking up later include fennel powder/seeds, qasuri/kasoori methi (dried fenugreek), amchur powder, raw cashews, and common spice mixes like Chole Masala.    S. Indian Cuisine is more apt to use these ingredients (with room for regional variability; you have strict super-vegan Jains living pretty close to beef-eaters down there!):   Hing (Asafoetida powder) Urad dal (skinned black lentils) Mustard Seeds Red Chilies (Whole and/or Powdered) Curry leaves Cumin (Seeds, more often) Mustard Oil Turmeric Powder Coconut Tamarind Shallots / Onions Garlic Chana Dal (Indian Chickpeas) Toor Dal (Split Pigeon Peas) Cilantro Tomatoes Atta Flour Basmati Rice   There, tarkas are more common for flavoring: after a dish is cooked, oil is infused with spices and added in. Mustard seeds, hing, red chilies, curry leaves, turmeric, cumin seeds, and urad dal are common tarka ingredients, providing flavor and texture alike. Mustard oil gets a lot of play (more than elsewhere), but plain old vegetable is a standby, too.   Onions and garlic are still common aromatics, but the prevalence of religious/cultural traditions forbidding them means many recipes omit them. Dals like chana, urad, and toor are common sources of protein, although beef and fish are also widely consumed. While tomatoes are still used for sourness, tamarind is at least as common.   Coconut is in just about everything in some form or fashion (including many popular spice mixes like Sambar powder), and of course cilantro still shows up. Wheat breads seem to be generally more common, but that's not hard and fast.  In terms of equipment, a spice grinder is less necessary until you start making spice powders by hand (e.g., rassam, gunpowder chutney, etc.), but a shredder for all that coconut would be smart. A little tarka pan (relatively high-walled, but small, fry pan perfect for heating a couple of tbsp of oil and spices while containing spluttering) is handy, but hardly essential.    Of course, these are very broad generalizations of ancient cultural traditions and recipe families, and India is a complicated country with many different competing traditions to enjoy and learn about. Indo-chinese cuisine, Goan cuisine, Mumbai street food, etc. all vary wildly and are very deep, complicated things. The lists above are more generalized starters that I've thought about over the last several years of cooking Indian food as a dedicated, beloved hobby :)"

Add the bitter gourd and onions and fry on high heat, regularly closing with a lid to cook and mixing well when not. Bitter gourd tends to have a lot of water in it, so you will need to cook for atleast 20 mins to reach a semi-crunchy state. At this stage, add salt, chilli powder, coriander powder, sugar and mix well on medium heat. (Note: About 1/2 tbsp milk can also be added to counter the bitter taste) Once thoroughly mixed, take it off the heat but allow it to continue to cook until it reaches a crunchy state Serve with roti / rice."

Salt the bitter gourd slices (after it's been chopped & de-seeded) and let stand for an hour or even overnight, then squeeze the juice out of the slices (don't have to strangle them or anything; you just want to get some juice out of each one).

However, I'd say that generally, the one called ""Punjabi Chole"" is probably prepared in a very rich, street food-esque fashion, probably with extra butter or something.

That makes it unsuitable for high heat applications—you won't get a great sear with it and you couldn't recreate a recipe that's supposed to made in a 900°F tandoor to work on a non-stick pan.  On the other hand, that's the only real limitation with it, so non-stick pans are fine for most things. Yes, you do want to cook your spices—in some cases, maybe even verging on burning them. But you don't need extreme high heat to do that, and it won't work better somehow if they stick to the pan. Cooking spices at medium temperature is fine—just hot enough to pop mustard seeds, but but cool enough that you can monitor the development of the aromas and stop it at the right time."

IndianFood,2n0v73,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Nov 22 06:58:20 2014 UTC,"Maillard reaction:       The Maillard reaction (/maɪˈjɑr/ my-YAR; French pronunciation: ​[majaʁ]) is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that gives browned foods their desirable flavor. Seared steaks, pan-fried dumplings, breads, and many other foods make use of the effect. It is named after French chemist Louis-Camille Maillard, who first described it in 1912 while attempting to reproduce biological protein synthesis.   (p79)  The reaction is a form of nonenzymatic browning which typically proceeds rapidly from around 140 to 165 °C (284 to 329 °F). At higher temperatures, caramelization and subsequently pyrolysis become more pronounced.  The reactive carbonyl group of the sugar reacts with the nucleophilic amino group of the amino acid, and forms a complex mixture of poorly characterized molecules responsible for a range of odors and flavors. This process is accelerated in an alkaline environment (e.g., lye applied to darken pretzels), as the amino groups (RNH3+) are deprotonated and, hence, have an increased nucleophilicity. The type of the amino acid determines the resulting flavor. This reaction is the basis of the flavoring industry. At high temperatures, acrylamide can be formed.

IndianFood,2mviqi,neeshkabibble,7,Thu Nov 20 15:15:57 2014 UTC,This sounds more like the dosa I am familiar with.

IndianFood,2mviqi,neeshkabibble,4,Thu Nov 20 17:18:48 2014 UTC,Try and thin it down til its about the consistency of a crepe batter. Take a ladle full and slowly let it fall out of the ladle as you're making your concentric circular rotations small to large. It's just one of those things you'll get better and better at the more you make. Good luck!   I hope you've shoveled your way out by now!

IndianFood,2mviqi,GujuGanjaGirl,-3,Thu Nov 20 15:45:16 2014 UTC,"Well yeah true, but Dosa with Applesauce sounds like a columbsed dosa. And that is why I pointed it out. A dosa that is stripped of its culture is a culturally appropriated dosa! Of course one can eat whatever one wants and how they want it as long as one is aware aware of the intricacies involved with cultural appropriation."
IndianFood,2mviqi,Evolutionarybiologer,5,Thu Nov 20 16:59:06 2014 UTC,"Believe me,  I had no idea what I was doing the first time I made dosa batter.   The first time was almost the last  time.   The idea of fermented food caught my attention.  I ferment everything. I went through all the steps in the morning before work.   The instructions said the batter would expand.   I put the batter in a half gallon mason jar with the lid lightly attached to release the CO2.   Then I left for work.   That evening when I walked through the door I found dosa batter everywhere.   The batter expanded so much it reached the top of the jar and packed off the lid.   It built pressure until it blew the lid off.   The batter hit the 45° ceiling and ricocheted into the living room.  I'm going  to be cleaning that mess up forever.  Its a good thing I didn't quit then as dosa have become a real staple food for us."

IndianFood,2mviqi,nsfwdesi,6,Fri Nov 21 12:12:39 2014 UTC,"Dosa is a pancake made from rice and lentils. Dosa is crispy on outside and soft in the middle. The batter is fermented for several hours up to days, depending on the temperature.  For fermentation use a vessel that is at least twice the volume of the fresh unfermented batter.  During fermentation the batter more than doubles in size.  To grind the batter use a blender or a wet grinder.  If the batter is slightly grainy that is ok.     Dosa Recipe Ingredients: 2 cups Idli rice 1 cup ponni rice ¾ cup urad dal ¼ cup toor dal ¼ cup chana dal 1 tsp methi seeds ½ tsp salt (optional) Method: 1)    Place rice in vessel and cover with water. 2)    Place dal and methi seeds in another vessel and cover with water. 3)    Soak ingredients for 6 to 9 hours or overnight. 4)    Grind rice. 5)    Grind dal. 6)    Combine rice and dal and stir. 7)    Place batter in large vessel and ferment for at least 6 hours up to days. 8)    Heat non-stick pan and lightly oil. 9)    Pour in measure of dosa batter and spread with ladle in circular motion. 10)   Cook one side until golden brown and flip. 11)   Serve dosa with accompaniments.

It's basically the same masalas with the exception that one needs to add a bit of jaggery, tamarind paste and boiled corn.  Another variation would be to add strips of besan to the khadi ( knead besan, ajwain, jeera, salt, chili powder into a dough, roll out and cut into strips). This makes the khadi thicken up a bit and can be eaten as a whole meal itself."

IndianFood,2m9mnq,Vellon221,4,Fri Nov 14 07:53:02 2014 UTC,"My recipe is a combination of other recipes that I've pieced together.  I'm going to have to post & then edit this to get the formatting right so bear with me.  I've also included one of the source recipes that this is based on:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/g9j4a/chana_masala_one_of_the_best_ive_ever_had_and_i/  ....actually now that I look this over, u/smacksaw really deserves the credit for this.  I just added hing and amchoor!!   8oz. chickpeas, soaked overnight (or 1 15/16oz. can) 1 teabag 1 tsp salt 3 tbsp vegetable oil 4 medium onions, diced 2 tsp chopped/minced/grated garlic 1 tbsp ginger, minced or grated 3 green chillies, sliced (1 serrano, seeded/de-veined is fairly warm) 5 tomatoes, chopped (1 can, diced tomats) 2 tsp coriander powder 1 tsp cumin powder ½ tsp turmeric powder ½ tsp (+/-) Amchoor powder 1/4 tsp Asofoetida (Hing) powder 1 tsp red chilli powder (paprika) 2 tbsp chopped coriander leaves ¼ tsp garam masala 1 tsp toasted cumin seeds, crushed 1 tsp toasted coriander seeds, crushed 1 tbsp lemon juice (can omit if using amchoor) 1 tbsp ginger, cut into julienne strips Slivered almonds, toasted (add to finished dish)   Method (blatantly copied from the reddit post above):  Still with me? Here's the entire dish put together in the proper order.  Step 1: 250g chickpeas + 1 teabag + 1 tsp salt + 1L of water  Ok, you need at least 1L of water because it will evaporate. It doesn't say how long to simmer them. I am going to tell you. At least 2 hours. It says ""tender"" - the consistency is almost like mashed potatoes when you bite into one. You will need to keep adding water if it evaporates. That's why you don't need 1L of water, you need to have 1L of water left when you are done. You just bring the above ingredients up to a rapid boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer.  Step 2: 3 tbsp vegetable oil + 4 medium onions, chopped  Step 2 should start about 30 minutes before you think your chickpeas will be done. I use a wok. If you don't have one, a large stainless steel pan will work, or another pot if you like. Put your ghee/oil into your wok with the onions, put it over medium heat and when things start to happen, lower the heat so that the onions don't burn, just brown and go translucent. When they've reached that point, on to...  Step 3: 2 tsp chopped garlic + 1 tbsp ginger, chopped + 3 green chillies, sliced  Remember I said that everything has it's time? Ginger and garlic burn easily and you don't want to lose the oil from the green peppers all at once. Add them in once the onions are almost done and let everything finish together. It shouldn't take very long. The garlic should get mushy. I like to press with the bottom of my wok spatula. When it's creamy, the garlic is done. It all melts anyway. At least it should if it's done. Too high and it becomes sticky and burnt, so be careful. Keep it low and slow.  Step 4: 5 tomatoes, chopped + 2 tsp coriander powder + 1 tsp cumin powder + ½ tsp turmeric powder + 1 tsp red chilli powder (mild paprika) + 2 tbsp chopped coriander leaves  Reserve 25% of the coriander leaves. The tomatoes should have water. Which is good. Just be careful when you add it to your oil. Hopefully the oil isn't that hot. You want some liquid because the powdered spices need to blend. This is also when you're going to want to add some salt. Always add salt at the liquid phases. Just dump it all in and move it around to mix things up. Raise the heat up enough to bring things to a simmer.  Now, go back to your chickpeas. Using a slotted spoon or a ladle, put them into the wok. If you use a slotted spoon, it says to use a cup of the water. If you use a ladle, just eyeball it. Make sure things are at a nice, uncovered simmer and let it go for about 20 minutes. If it starts to dry up, use a ladle to add in some more of the water you boiled the chickpeas in.  Step 5: ¼ tsp garam masala + 1 tsp toasted cumin seeds, crushed + 1 tsp toasted coriander seeds, crushed + 1 tbsp lemon juice +1 tbsp ginger, cut into julienne strips  This is the final flavouring and you'll prep it as things are simmering. In a new pan, put the cumin and coriander seeds over low heat and squash them with your wok spatula or the bottom of a glass. Whatever you like. Go ahead and add them and the spices into the chana and turn the heat off. This includes the coriander leaves you reserved. These instructions on the web are a nightmare. I hope his book is better. The final step is to add the lemon juice and mix it in. When you serve them, people can have the julienne ginger if they like.  One of the things it says to do is skim off any excess oil, but I sort of like it. You may not even have any. I didn't. This keeps really well and you can freeze it and easily reheat it. I love it with naan or roti.  Notes (also blatantly copied from the reddit post above): Mise en place/how/why:  250g chickpeas, soaked overnight - wash them in cold water and then put them into a container with plenty of fresh water. You do not need to refrigerate this.  1 teabag - this is to colour the chickpeas when cooking, but also for liquid you will reserve  3 tbsp vegetable oil - only because you probably do not have ghee. If you have ghee, use it.  4 medium onions, chopped - ""Chopped"" is a funny word here. Aim for ""diced""  2 tsp chopped garlic - or, if you want to make it easier, 2 cloves, diced. I have more when we get to the tomato.  1 tbsp ginger, chopped - a good way to do it is to peel the skin off with a peeler and then peel off slices of the garlic itself and dice them up.  3 green chillies, sliced - This is vague, so I'll explain. The closest approximation to what is used (from my time learning from an Indian chef in San Diego) are green serrano chiles. Cut off both ends and slice in half lengthwise. Wash the seeds and pulp out under cold water, using a paring knife to clean the pepper out. Don't burn your skin. Then cut into lengthwise strips/julienne them.  5 tomatoes, chopped - again, this is vague. The correct term is ""concasse"", ok? Boil water. You are going to de-skin your tomatoes and garlic here. The garlic is easy enough. Just put them into boiling water and when you see the skin change, take them out. Cut off the root and peel the outer and difficult inner skin off. If you do it right, you just halfway cut the root portion and use it as a tab to pull the skin off in one fell swoop.  With the tomatoes, you want to shrink the skin off in the boiling water. Core the stem with a paring knife and then score an 'x' at the bottom so the skin will have some give. Put a bowl of ice water in your sink. Then, when you put the tomatoes in the boiling water, you'll see the skin retreat. Put the tomatoes in the ice water when the skin has retreated a bit.  Then, peel off the skins with your fingers. They should come off easily. If not, they didn't tighten up enough. Cut the tomato lengthwise on a flat surface with a knife longer than the tomato and ""unroll"" the tomato's outer flesh from the inner core and seeds. Same technique works with bell peppers. Discard the core and seeds and wash the tomato off in your ice water to make sure there are no seeds.  Then you basically chop them horizontally and vertically so they would be almost a pulp of tiny squares, which is the smallest dice you can do. The tomato needs to ""melt"" into the dish.  1 tsp red chilli powder - Ok, this is not explained. What you need here is PAPRIKA. Sometimes it's called Kashmiri chili powder, etc. It's mild paprika. It's not sweet Hungarian paprika. It's not cayenne pepper. This, like the tea is about presentation. The green chiles actually add the heat, but if it's not to your liking, the way to do it is to add chili oil after the dish is done. That way people of different tolerances can enjoy different amounts of heat.  1 tsp toasted cumin seeds, crushed AND 1 tsp toasted coriander seeds, crushed - Again, this is Indian 101 here, so let me break this down for you. Spices like to pop. As in explode. When you crush them, they don't pop on you like popcorn. Also, it forces the oil out. This is very simple. Bring a burner up to low heat, put your spices in a regular stainless steel pan and put the pan on the burner. Use the back of a spatula to crush the spices. I use a wok spatula since it has no slots. You'll know they're done by the aroma they give off. This is not a pre-prep thing, but something you do as the chana simmers."

IndianFood,2m8pan,deepicasso,3,Fri Nov 14 01:42:04 2014 UTC,"Ivy Gourd curry  Ingredients:   Ivy gourd (sigh only knew it as thondekayi till today. thondekayi has such a sexiness to its name, ivy gourd is ... subpar, no?) Onion - 1 small, finely chopped Oil, about 3 tbsp Mustard seeds Urad dal, for seasoning Asafoetida - a pinch Salt - 1tbsp Chilli powder - 1.5 tbsp Coriander - finely chopped   Procedure:   Heat oil in a pan, add the mustard seeds, urad dal, asafoetida and fry for about 15 seconds. Add the ivy gourd and onions and fry on high heat, regularly closing with a lid to cook and mixing well when not. Ivy gourd tends to have a lot of water in it, so you will need to cook for atleast 20 mins to reach a semi-cruncy state. At this stage, add salt, chilli powder, coriander, and mix well on medium heat. Once thoroughly mixed, take it off the heat but allow it to continue to cook. Serve with roti / rice.   Side note:  Somebody give me some real recipes or I'll be heating the oil and serving with roti all my fucking life."

IndianFood,2m8bx6,Pecorino,5,Thu Nov 13 23:42:24 2014 UTC,"pressure cooking can ""cook out"" certain ingredients like ginger and garlic, making their flavors almost disappear   Yeah...I don't think so.  When you cook ginger, the sharp-tasting compound, gingerol, undergoes a chemical reaction to be converted to zingerone; which while maintaining pungency, is actually sweeter tasting. A similar reaction happens with the garlic. So, there's a (faster and more profound)  development of flavour rather than a loss of one. So while one could say the flavour is ""cooked-out"", it's only cooked out in the sense that it tastes different than its raw state.  Yes, food cooks at a higher temperature but the fact that it cooks faster actually helps retain more nutrients. I've been eating food cooked in pressure cookers since my baby-food mush days. Food tastes just the same. You just have to watch your timing so you don't mess up the texture."
IndianFood,2m8bx6,kimkaromi,1 point,Fri Nov 14 00:15:27 2014 UTC,"That is an excellent response. Thank you! So apart from the advantages of time saving and retaining nutrition, there isn't much to be gained from using a pressure cooker?"

IndianFood,2m4pfe,polymeowrs,3,Thu Nov 13 00:28:00 2014 UTC,"Ew, the sweetness is definitely not from tamarind. It's from the eastern style garam masala and supplemental whole spices that constitute the garam masala - cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, bay leaves/black pepper (optional). The recipe may or may not have tomato as part of the gravy masala. I recommend against tomato.   Here's a fairly decent recipe for jhal mangsho. It doesn't look that different from how my friend's mother used to make it: Three major differences - she used mutton rather than beef; she used mustard oil to cook the meat; and after onion was nice and cooked out and caramelising, instead of continuing to stew the meat forever, she shoved in the pressure cooker."
IndianFood,2m4pfe,kimkaromi,3,Thu Nov 13 01:48:09 2014 UTC,"Just curious, why is a sweet tamarind a far fetched idea?"
IndianFood,2m4pfe,kimkaromi,4,Thu Nov 13 02:25:42 2014 UTC,"Hey, it's not to say there are no meat curry recipes in south Asia that use tamarind. There are, but proportionally, especially in the north, they are rarities. A few mughal influenced dishes, especially in Nizami cuisine (cuisine of the Muslim royal house of the Deccan) use it. But starting around the 20th parallel north it's not conventional.  Use of tamarind in meat dishes, increases the further south you go. Tons of south Indian recipes with meat and tamarind. But in coastal regions tamarind is most often found in vegetable and seafood dishes.   Also the sweetest tamarind is still quite tangy. It would not be added to a dish for sweetness, but for tang (and maybe colour).  Apart from that, there's just the general drift of a regional cuisine. While particular spice/condiment combinations with certain foods may not be heretical, they're also not customary. Sort of like how you always know that a Reuben sandwich is made with corned beef and not steak."

IndianFood,2ludkq,sadeness,1 point,Mon Nov 10 15:39:39 2014 UTC,"Its difficult to suggest any that is just a slow cooker recipe because most Indian curries or dals need high heat at some stage to break them down.  Ninja edit: The spices need to be fried as well...so I doubt if someone can really come up with a good slow cooker recipe.  However, one thing you can try is to make is ""kheer"". It requires slow simmering of rice with milk to reduce it down to a pudding consistency. It might work. YMMV."

The major key being patience. You have only one cooker and everything needs to be done in that itself, so a lot of steps would involve shifting things to bowls in between and sorta creating an assembly line.  We used to make all rice-based dishes: Pulao, Biriyani, Tomato bath (bath-any rice dish made in south indian style) and and legumes - Channa, daal, rajma etc.   What I would like to try is to make some tough meat like mutton and see how it cooks."

IndianFood,2ludkq,sadeness,1 point,Thu Jan 22 11:51:06 2015 UTC,"I once had Bengali style chicken at a friend's house and it was mind blowing. The jhol (broth?) was full of flavour. In fact, I didn't even eat the chicken much, just mixed jhol and rice. It was rich with a hint of oil and a good blend of spices.   However, every time I try to make it at home, it is either too bland, too watery, or becomes thick like gravy.   People who like to cook Bengali food, how do I get the perfect 'jhol' ?"
IndianFood,2ludkq,sadeness,1 point,Mon Nov 10 13:48:36 2014 UTC,"You need to add water as the ""jhol"" cooks and reduce to required consistency.   Can you write down how you are making the curry? Maybe I'll be able to help better."
IndianFood,2ludkq,sadeness,1 point,Tue Nov 11 00:50:57 2014 UTC,"Sure.    I heat 2 tbsp oil.  Add 1 chopped onion and 2 bay leaves and allow the onions to turn brownish Then add onion+garlic+ginger paste (2tbsp) and some chopped tomato (1/2) Add green chili (2) Allow to cook for a few minutes Add 1 cup hot water. (The recipe specified it should be hot)  Cook till oil separates from the sides. (I get it wrong at this point, it becomes thick after cooking, not the nice runny jhol I want) Add a pinch of garam masala and cook for 2-3 min.Add salt to taste."
IndianFood,2ludkq,sadeness,2,Tue Nov 11 09:41:13 2014 UTC,You should definitely add more water.  1 cup is too little for a thin curry.  Remember you can always cook it down to required consistency.    Also keep in mind that the curry will thicken as time goes by. If you are using chicken thighs they give out a lot of chicken fat that thickens the curry (the oil you are talking about).  So if you kept any leftovers in the fridge you may need to add a bit more water while heating it up for the next meal.
IndianFood,2ludkq,mastiii,1 point,Tue Nov 11 16:31:32 2014 UTC,"Ohh thanks :)  So I will add more water and if it becomes bland, I can increase the spices accordingly right?    chicken thighs they give out a lot of chicken fat that thickens the curry   I am cooking Dimer Jhol for now, but will keep this in mind for Murgir jhol."
IndianFood,2ludkq,Anunemouse,2,Tue Nov 11 16:44:45 2014 UTC,"Ohh yes, certainly. You'll need to adjust the spices accordingly. Also if you are using a pre-made ginger garlic paste, I'll suggest using fresh, it does make a lot of difference.  You might also want to add a pinch of cumin (jeera) while sauteeing your onions initially. Its not very traditional I guess (in the sense that my mom would think its weird) but it does wonders to the taste. A lot of garam masala powders actually contain cumin anyway.  Edit: by the way, use mustard oil for cooking these bengali curries if possible. Its pungency is needed for that typical flavor. Vegetable oil doesn't have that kick."
IndianFood,2ludkq,Anunemouse,1 point,Tue Nov 11 17:24:56 2014 UTC,"I always use fresh ginger garlic paste. (No big deal for an Indian kitchen, I don't understand why some people living in India would use pre-made ones.).   About the jeera, I have never read any Bengali recipe with rai and jeera ka tadka to be honest. Will try it out though.   Ohhhh mustard oil yes !!!! But won't the mustard oil overshadow the taste of jeera if it is allowed to crackle in it?   Only one way to find out ! ;)   Thanks for all your tips, appreciate it."
IndianFood,2ludkq,Anunemouse,1 point,Tue Nov 11 17:48:47 2014 UTC,"Mustard oil definitely does tone down cumin but in my experience the oil mellows down too,  So you do get a hint of cumin flavor. I like cumin in such curries due to the umami they bring in.  It's a bit understated flavor in Indian cooking even though so many of Indian dishes implicitly depend on it."

The main religion in India that does this are the Jains:   Strict Jains don’t eat root vegetables such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers, because such root vegetables are considered ananthkay. Ananthkay means one body, but containing countless lives. A regular vegetable such as cabbage has number of leaves and lives as could be counted by a layman. However, a root vegetable such as potato, though from the looks of it is one article, is said to contain multiple lives ('ekindriya') in it. Also, tiny life forms are injured when the plant is pulled up and because the bulb is seen as a living being, as it is able to sprout.[12] Also, consumption of most root vegetables involves uprooting and killing the entire plant. Whereas consumption of most terrestrial vegetables doesn't kill the plant (it lives on after plucking the vegetables or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway).   Elsewhere, some Buddhist monks also avoid root vegetables, and Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese monks will avoid eating strong-tasting things like onions that excite the senses."

Tomato Chutney  Ingredients:   5-6 tomatoes 3-4 green chilies Pinch of asafoetida Coriander leaves 1 tbsp Salt A pinch of sugar Oil Mustard seeds   Procedure:   Grind the tomatoes with the chilies, asafoetida, salt and coriander in a mixer into a fine paste. Heat up oil in a pan, add the mustard seeds, paste and fry until all the moisture evaporates and you are left with a reduced chutney. Serve alongside dry roti   Side note:   Add more chilly if you want your butt to taste it.     Onion Curry [ಈರುಳ್ಳಿ ಗೊಜ್ಜು]  Ingredients:   Onions - 3 large and finely chopped Tamarind paste / Tamarind - 2 tbsp Salt - 1 tbsp A pinch of sugar Oil Mustard seeds Rasam powder (Don't ask me how to make this, recursion really isn't my thing) - 3 tbsp   Procedure:   Heat the oil in a pan, add mustard seeds and the finely chopped onion and fry until the onions turn light brown. Mix the tamarind paste, rasam powder, salt and sugar in a small cup of water(about 50 ml). Pour the mixture into the pan and fry until all the moisture evaporates. Serve with dry roti.   Side Note:   Make sure nobody catches you eating this though, especially americans, they love them some rich deposits of oil.     Aloo Curry[ಆಲೂಗೆಡ್ಡೆ ಪಲ್ಯ]  Ingredients:   Potatoes, about 4-5 Green chillies, about 3 Salt - 1tbsp Turmeric - 1/2 tbsp Oil Mustard seeds   Procedure:   Boil the potates, and hulk smash them until they resemble paste. Heat oil in a pan, add mustard seeds, smashed potatoes, chopped chillies and turmeric and fry until well mixed. Serve (lol)   Side Note:   If you start making 'The Devil's Tower' from your potatoes instead of curry, then you will ruin your family, please don't."

I have waded through a lot on YT and these are some favourites:  Anjum Anand on BBC http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD1ABCAB810F10273  Manjula's Kitchen http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb75CvYbm5BXpbEkGqFKABw   Show me the Curry http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuLQ97B7KhgxP7aqynTyB_w  Sanjeev Kapoor Khazana http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmoX4QULJ9MB00xW4coMiOw  and last but not least Titlis Busy Kitchen  http://titlisbusykitchen.com/?cat=5 http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUuOTm1-Nhwac1vFx_h-ojQ   The main thing about Indian cooking are of course the spices. Wherever you are on the planet, try to get a hold of the basic spices, so you can make your own masalas!  The results are so much better than with the ready-made stuff. Maybe someone can elaborate on this topic?  If you want to use spice mixes and pastes, Shan http://www.shanfoods.com/  and Patak http://pataks.co.uk/ are decent brands.   And whatever you do, use ginger/garlic paste made from fresh garlic and ginger!"

I'm lucky that I have a good Indo-Pak store nearby so I can get a large selection of ingredients - everything from fresh curry leaves to all kinds of lentil to strange looking vegetables I can't begin to identify :)  I feel like I need to branch out to a recipe book where I can browse and assume each recipe is high quality, rather than finding random recipes online.  In the meantime, thanks for the recommendations for the other YouTube channels - I'll check those out."

Also, I grew up in Mumbai and have never heard of a kichada. I am familiar with a dish called kichadi but the description does not match.  Pani puri, misal pav, pav bhajji, dahi wada are typical street foods from Mumbai and are usually small/medium sized snacks rather than a full meal.  Haleem is from a different cultural group and can be very tasty if done right. Lamb biryani can be awesome if done well.

And it looks like the food is served on styrofoam. This indicates that it's probably geared toward Indians rather than white people. So the food is probably fantastic.  Always look for styrofoam plates and always look for biryani that costs less than $9.

Could you suggest a substitute amount? Where can I even purchase curry leaves? I also only have green cardamom, not black. Are they hugely different?"
IndianFood,2kulfs,2Cuil4School,5,Fri Oct 31 03:35:51 2014 UTC,Any good red dried chili will work.   1 tsp of your chili powder should give dish plenty of fire.. You can omit the curry leaves.   If you have an Indian market in your town they will have fresh curry leaves.  Green cardamom pods will work fine.
IndianFood,2kr4x3,palljonsson,18,Thu Oct 30 04:40:15 2014 UTC,"Normally the restaurants batch cook everything which means they make buckets and buckets of the sauces. The way we made CTM was using a tomato base( tomato paste, AP tomato, fresh puree, a touch of ketchup) boiled and sauteed with onion, ginger, garlic, cumin, a touch of turmeric, salt, and bay leaf. We would boil everything together and then reduce down.  The next sauce we had was the onion/tomato sauce which was diced spanish onion and cumin, ginger, garlic and everything was mixed together.   Once the onions were just translucent, the tomatoes would be added and we would increase the heat. Mix until the tomatoes were almost mushed and then we let everything cool down for hours.   When you mix everything together in a pan, you take oil/ghee and heat it up slightly and add minced garlic (use fresh not jar ones if possible). Take more tomato sauce then onion. Heat and mix. Add water to dilute and then reduce to simmer. Let it boil off. Doing this will increase the flavors.   Chicken.. biggest thing i see is when people make it is they just add grill chicken in and mix it together. It doesn't really work that way if you want it tender. **If you ever go out to eat and you bit into a piece of marinated chicken and you see a ring of color on the outside..that is food coloring. It's only there to make it look good. A full ring is a bad because chefs get lazy. I had mine use a touch but majority of the color was from the spices... Ok back to the chicken. When you grill the chicken that has been marinated, cook it a bit more than half way and let it cool down. Once that has been done, toss the chicken and masala sauce together and heat up to a quick boil. Turn off the heat and add a touch of salt/pepper/red chilly powder and mix. Add heavy cream and top with melted butter/ghee when finally bowled.   I've done this for 2 years in a commercial kitchen and 5 years as a caterer. The last time i was in an indian kitchen or even made indian food was about 3 years ago. I wouldn't use anything from jars. In the kitchen, we didn't use motor and pestel but we had massive blenders that pulverized everything. If you ever go to an indian restaurant and the sauce looks very light orange in color, thats heavy cream.   Hopefully this helps."
IndianFood,2kr4x3,khyberchef,4,Thu Oct 30 07:18:50 2014 UTC,"Hey, are you based in the UK or US? I know in the UK there's a guy called Mick Crawford who put an e-book together called British Indian Restaurant (BIR) Style Curries, based on his research into how these dishes are cooked in UK restaurants/takeaways as opposed to the authentic Indian versions.   His writing style isn't great but I found it helped me cook curries more like the ones people are used to getting here, which are usually a lot different to the authentic recipes from India which you find on the Web. Bastardised versions of the originals essentially.   Not sure whether that exactly applies here as CTM is a British invention anyway!   EDIT: oops, just saw you are in nyc. Might still be worth a try though :)"
IndianFood,2kr4x3,do_you_realise,2,Thu Oct 30 11:31:28 2014 UTC,Thanks for that. I think US/UK style curries are probably very similar so I'm gonna get that book
IndianFood,2kr4x3,do_you_realise,3,Thu Oct 30 13:15:24 2014 UTC,"Good stuff.  I must say that he goes to the length of exactly mimicing how they make a huge batch of generic base sauce (""garabi"") and then create the individual curries by adding to that. It's worth a try just to see whether it gets you where you want to be, but I've found that for a home kitchen it's easier to just start with just frying off a bunch of sliced onion until it's golden (or starting to caramelise if you want extra flavour), adding some garlic/ginger for a few minutes, adding your spice mix (he gives a couple of variations in the e-book) and then blending this with tomato paste and adding water until you've got to the same consistency. Much easier this way if you're doing these dishes as one-offs rather than bashing out hundreds of dishes in the same evening :)  Also IIRC his recipes (especially the tikka/tandoori ones) aren't shy about using pre-made curry pastes, making the same point someone made elsewhere here in that most restaurants aren't going to be spending hours making their own spice mixes / pastes etc. So you might struggle if you can't get e.g. Patak's curry pastes in NYC.  If all else fails... do what this guy did and befriend one of the guys in your local restaurant and ask for the recipe :)"
IndianFood,2kr4x3,lobster_johnson,3,Thu Oct 30 13:33:23 2014 UTC,"I have the answer for you. Yes, a lot of cookbooks and videos will attempt to give you the ""authentic"" kind; I myself was consistently disappointed until I found the key. Or keys, actually. A few things they tend to do wrong:   Too little onion. The gravy in Indian food is based on onions. It's what gives the sauce its smooth body; it acts as a thickener and a very subtle but important flavour enhancer. Can't make Indian food without it. It's not just one onion chopped and then ""fried for 5 minutes until translucent"". No — you need a whole bunch of onions, cooked (sweated) until tender and then blended into a fine pulp. Some Indian restaurants will also cook the onions with peppers, cabbage and tomatoes, among other things. Sweating the onions for 45-60 minutes is absolutely paramount. Sweated onions develop complex aromatics that taste completely differently from onions that have been just lightly fried in some oil. Too much unconcentrated tomato. Rather, a lot of recipes call for you to plop in a can of chopped tomatoes. This makes no sense: Tomatoes have a lot of water, so you don't get a concentrated gravy out of this, not unless you cook it for hours. It's the same shoddy deception as the classic cook-book illusion that pretends you can caramelize onions in five minutes. No, you need tomato paste: A really concentrated reduction of tomato. No ginger-garlic paste. One of the cornerstones of Indian food (and coincidentally also some middle-eastern cuisines and Thai) is the ginger-garlic paste, but it almos never comes up in recipes. In India you'll find jars of this in the supermarket. Making your own is better. It's what it says: Chopped garlic and ginger, minced in a blender until a fine paste. They skip the blending step. A lot of recipes ask you to combine chopped onions, tomatoes, spices and what not, and you get this chunky mess that is nothing like a true tikka masala. All the flavour is distributed in bits of onion, bits of coriander, watery tomato sauce. A great tikka masala sauce must be blended for about 5-6 minutes until perfectly smooth. Not enough fenugreek. This one is a matter of preference. I think tikka masala absolutely needs to be made with (a modest amount of) fenugreek leaves. To me, it's what turns something good into something awesome. Not enough paneer. Again, this is a matter of preference. Some cooks apparently only add paneer to butter chicken, not tikka masala. For me, the sauce is exactly the same thing (and historically, I think that is right: tikka masala is butter chicken sauce + tikka chicken). Anyway, adding crumbled paneer to a sauce makes it a lot better.   The only recipe I have found to match the stuff you find in restaurants is an ebook by a British cook named Julian Voigt: The Secret to That Takeway Curry Taste. It's amazing. (I'm not affiliated with the author, just a happy customer.)  Voigt runs a small ""BIR""-style (British Indian Restaurant, pretty much what you associate with Indian food in the West) takeout place in England. His own recipes come from recipes he learned by working in Indian restaurants before he started his own. And unlike many recipes which claim to be ""authentic"", they truly are. The book is charmingly amateurishly put together and completely unpretentious.  Voigt's recipe is basically a three-step process, from memory:   Onion gravy base. This is, at its most basic, sweated onions + lots of neutral vegetable oil + fresh chili + some tomatoes + garam masala, cooked for about 90 minutes and then blended until perfectly smooth. The base smells like old gym socks and has a brown, goopy, unappealing exterior. It's used as the base for the actual sauce. Tikka masala sauce base. This is yogurt + tomato paste + spice paste + red food dye. Voigt uses a combination of several off-the-shelf Indian spice pastes as a shortcut. Final sauce = heat onion base, add a few spoonfuls of tikka masala sauce base + ginger-garlic paste + coriander leaves + coconut powder (aka coconut flour; a BIR oddity, I believe, but it does makes the sauce mellower) + fenugreek leaves + paneer (optional, it's not in the book) + a little heavy cream to finish.   The whole book is made from the perspective of a restaurant chef, so everything is scaled to large batches. That's why the sauce bases are separate. The nice thing is that you can make 5 liters of onion base and freeze what you don't need; the onion base can be used for all sorts of dishes since it's pretty flavour-neutral.  I highly recommend the book.  Edit: Didn't read the Guardian recipe until now. Yeah, they make those mistakes. The author knows about ginger-garlic paste, but uses a can of tomatoes and doesn't sweat the onions."

IndianFood,2kr4x3,Devvils,3,Thu Oct 30 06:02:38 2014 UTC,"Just a few tips from somebody who cooks lots of curries.  Most indian restaurants cook traditional curries ""low and slow"". Say 2 hours.  Cooling to under 8 celcius with thicken the mix if you have certain veges because of resistant starch http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistant_starch and retrogradation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrogradation_%28starch%29  . The upshot is if you cook the curry +veges slowly, let it cool, then heat it again, the texture improves, and probaby the flavour as well. Most curries in indian restaurants were cooked yesterday and put in the fridge (not true for other asian curries). Some ghee/butter and proper seasoning can make a big difference too.  A GOOD commercial paste can taste better than DIY. Do you really think restaurants use mortar & pestle all day to grind spices? If its any consolation my spice grinding was underwhelming too. If my sister & I make the same recipe there is a big difference so general technique is important too.  Malaysians have red curries like beef rendang. Never really seen a red indian curry. Curries brown because of the Malillard reaction http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction and adding butter at the start makes it darker.  Cream isn't used much in indian cooking though usweetened yoghurt is. Try making a lassi, its idiot proof!"
IndianFood,2kr4x3,Devvils,3,Thu Oct 30 05:51:22 2014 UTC,"I believe what OP is referring to is what Indian restaurants in the US serve as ""chicken tikka masala"" that is vividly red from excessive use of red coloring.

IndianFood,2kr4x3,tremblemortals,2,Thu Oct 30 06:02:06 2014 UTC,"I tend to use MTR which is curry veges made in India. Just add to braised meat. The curry pastes like Pataks sold in supermarkets are ""westernised"" with extra salt & sugar. (For Thai, the Measri brand from Thailand is the best.)  The whole experience makes a big difference. I make a selection from  Basmati or Sona Masuri rice, papadums, raita, tomato + onion, banana + dessicated coconut,   Fern's pickles (indian grocer), indian flat bread (indian grocer has it frozen) + ""not perfect"" home made curry still makes a great meal.

Turn up the heat a bit and fry the spices. You should be able to smell them as they cook.  Now stir in that tomato sauce and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer that for ten minutes. Slowly mix in heavy cream. It should turn a neon orange.  Continue to simmer, and add in white sugar.  In another skillet, heat up vegetable oil. Cube up chicken and season with curry powder, then add into oil. Cook chicken until it's browned but still a little juicy. Just a couple minutes.  Add chicken to sauce.

IndianFood,2kr4x3,PlanetMarklar,2,Thu Oct 30 09:42:03 2014 UTC,"One thing about chicken: Don't use chicken breasts. Indian restaurants use chicken thighs because the fat content keeps them tender and juicy.  The problem with breasts is that they have zero fat and will dry out, so they overcook easily. Many recipes ask you to pan-fry the chicken until ""sealed"", then add sauce and continue cooking. But if you cook chicken breasts like this for 20-30 minutes, you'll end up with dry pieces of chicken. ""Sealing"" meat doesn't prevent the juices from escaping.  If you must use breasts, the best way to cook them is on skewers at about 200C/400F. In my experience, this reduces the juice loss. But thighs are much better."

IndianFood,2kg4ll,Mike_uxo,2,Mon Oct 27 15:45:54 2014 UTC,are you using dried chickpeas or canned (in water). If dried - be sure to soak overnight and simply boil for longer before adding to your sauce and be sure to simmer in your sauce also for a while to continue cooking the chickpeas and to diffuse the spices.  Your spices appear 'sharp' - assume you don't mean as in... cutting your gums - in which case buy a spice grinder :)  If 'sharp' as in 'bitter'? - perhaps you're burning them - have water to hand to prevent them from catching.  nb. Wouldn't be surprised if the restaurant was using far more ghee than any recipe you might read (which would add a rich mellowness).

I make this for my lunch regularly, so i don't want it too unhealthy so i often use only oil (rapeseed or mustard).  Picking up on a couple of other points. Pureed Onions - you mean you put them through a food processor? I find that doing this, though it saves time, ends up with a bad texture and potentially quite raw/bitter tasting onions. Better to dice or just slice them and sweat them as long as possible.  It's fine to then add the spices in on top of the onions as long as there's enough oil in the pan for the spices to be absorbed by.  Dried Chickpeas are good for a number of reasons: 1) better texture; you can tell they haven't been sat in water for months, they've got bite (in a good way). 2) cheaper 3) better flavour; both the chickpeas have a better flavour ANNND you can retain the cooking water (after skimming the scum) and add that into your dish with the tomatoes, reducing the lot down. Adding a huge flavour boost throughout.  Rick Steins recent cookbook 'India' had a good recipe for Chana Masala (which i think i'm mostly deriving my advice from here) would recommend you pick it up."

IndianFood,2kg4ll,harighotra,2,Thu Oct 30 20:36:36 2014 UTC,Are you mixing the yoghurt with gram flour (Besan) before heating it up? This might help with the Kharee recipe http://www.harighotra.co.uk/indian-recipes/mains/kharee With other recipes if you add 1 spoon of yoghurt at a time and stir until it has absorbed on a very low heat this will stop it from splitting or add a tsp of gram flour. Hope this helps!
IndianFood,2kaji2,ninthinning01,5,Sat Oct 25 15:45:19 2014 UTC,"Last year I made some amazing white wine vinegar that is mature and ready to use.  The vinegar is sour and has a depth of flavor that is complex, like a symphony in your mouth.  There isn't a better dish than chicken vindaloo to show case this vinegar.  The dish is influenced by Portuguese colonists who settled in Ghoa, India.  Portuguese sailors packed pork in vinegar to preserve the meat for long voyages at sea.  The word vindaloo is partially based on the Portuguese word for vinegar.  This recipe makes a fiery hot dish that really brings out the properties of my homemade vinegar.  Substitute white vinegar or white wine vinegar for homemade vinegar.  If you don't want the dish fiery  substitute regular powdered chili for hot powdered chili and use fewer than 10 red chilies.   Fiery Chicken Vindaloo Ingredients: 2 lbs cubed chicken thighs 1 tsp cardamom seeds 1 Tbsp cumin seeds ½ tsp pepper corns 4 cloves 2 large pieces cinnamon bark 1 tsp fenugreek seeds 2 tsp black mustard seeds 10 red chilies 3 bay leaves 1 tsp hot powder chili 1 tsp turmeric 1 tsp coriander powder 5 Tbsp coconut oil 1 Tbsp mustard oil 6 garlic cloves Thumb of ginger 2 onions finely diced 1cup white wine vinegar  1 tsp salt (optional) Procedure: 1) In dry pan on low heat toast the whole spices.  Cardamom seeds, cumin seeds, pepper corns, cinnamon sticks, fenugreek seeds, red chilies, black mustard seeds.  Let cool and  grind to fine powder. 2) Combine vinegar, mustard oil, ground spices, powders spices and chicken in bowl and mix.  This is chicken in vindaloo sauce.  Let marinate for five hours. 3) Add coconut oil to pan and heat.  Add bay leaves and brown onions, garlic and ginger, remove from pan, set aside. Add chicken and fry for a few minutes.  Saute chicken in batches so they brown nicely. After the chicken has been browned there is crust of spices cooked to the pan.  Use water or chicken stock to deglaze the pan.  Add seared chicken and onions back into pan. 4) Add balance of vindaloo sauce and water or chicken stock as needed and simmer for 20 minutes.  I like a lot of sauce so I use 1 cup of chicken stock. 5) Serve with basmati rice and paratha. Garnish with fresh cilantro."
IndianFood,2kaji2,Yellowbenzene,5,Sat Oct 25 15:45:48 2014 UTC,"The word vindaloo is partially based on the Portuguese word for vinegar.

IndianFood,2kaji2,videogamevoyeur,3,Sun Oct 26 01:45:32 2014 UTC,I know the purist will probably shout  me down but I really find the red colour of the curry you get in the restaurants more appetising. So to get this I add a few drops of red food colouring to the finished curry. Also check for the correct salt and vinegar levels.
IndianFood,2kaji2,malmn,3,Sun Oct 26 06:25:31 2014 UTC,I always wonder about how to get that nice red color.  Perhaps it is chilies with more color?  How can this deep red be achieved without food coloring?  My doctor insists I avoid salt so I always make it optional in recipes.

IndianFood,2k4xv6,firstsip,5,Fri Oct 24 10:36:48 2014 UTC,"To expand on /u/ninthinning01's point, the accordion fold > roll up > roll out can make for much, much flakier parathas (I've seen them referred to as lacha parathas, though this often seem to include maida/all-purpose flour and dairy instead of atta/wheat flour +  water).  It helps this process if you butter and lightly flour between every fold and don't roll too much when re-flattening, so that the layers are better preserved. If successful, every bite of paratha is rich with flaky, buttery layers and it's sort of the best thing on earth >.>"
IndianFood,2k5uls,wyldman27,4,Fri Oct 24 02:55:37 2014 UTC,"There are plenty of non dairy dishes, rice and dhal for one. Sag aloo, chana masala, and egg burji spring to mind, and usually anything like chicken jalfrezi and that sort of meat & gravy type of dish as well. Don't forget all the different types of bread.   In India vegan is called ""pure veg"", so look up some pure veg recipes for non-dairy foods."

IndianFood,2k5uls,2Cuil4School,2,Fri Oct 24 05:13:11 2014 UTC,"In Indian groceries in particular, yes, you could find many of those, and luckily, they'll have ingredient lists.  At Indian restaurants, things are a little shakier. Many places that are trying to appeal to the American/Western palate add lots of cream or butter to many dishes for texture/flavor/richness, even if they aren't ""traditionally"" used. So you'd have to ask.  In non-Indian places, it varies heavily. Amy's is a brand that I can easily find in most supermarkets (e.g., Walmart, Harris Teeter/Kroger), and Trader Joe's has their own brand of Indian frozen foods. In some areas where the grocery stores are smaller or whatever, you might not be able to find anything like this, though.  In that particular case, the dishes that g0_west listed might be harder to find than ""classic"" dishes like Butter Chicken or Chicken Tikka Masala, which virtually always include a lot of dairy."

IndianFood,2k5uls,piezod,1 point,Fri Oct 24 15:47:34 2014 UTC,"Not necessarily out luck, you just need to be specific in what you want. Like /u/g0_west said upthread, there are definitely vegan options at many restaurants. S. Indian cuisine is probably less likely to contain dairy overall than N. Indian, but you just never know. Some restaurants will sub coconut milk for regular milk, too.  Basically, just be prepared to ask a few questions and you should be fine :)"
IndianFood,2k5uls,data64,1 point,Fri Oct 24 15:51:01 2014 UTC,"Not at all. There are lots of things with no dairy products. A few of them are egg curry, mustard fish, kadhai chicken, sambahar with idli or doas, parathas, veg jhalfrezi, baingan bharta. Go out there and have a ball.   You're missing a few things which tend to be on the sweeter side - mughlai cuisine mostly.  Khichdi is something that is light and flavourful.  How lactose intolerant are you?

IndianFood,2jy68w,diemunkiesdie,2,Wed Oct 22 01:36:17 2014 UTC,Cubing machine has many little blades that almost mince the meat.
