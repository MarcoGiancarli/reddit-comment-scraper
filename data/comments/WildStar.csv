WildStar,3dzhco,Grota_Tankformeplz,7,Mon Jul 20 20:04:17 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's not that bad. Tanks can do the same thing that DPS do and pick up a PvP weapon for the SP it gives until something better drops. From there you are close enough that you can rune the difference. You'll be somewhat squishier, so your healers will have to pay more attention. But DS isn't impossible as a result.  Or your DPS can wait for two sunders. Either way.  Also, if your new tanks have less gear but especially less experience in DS fights, then they are already less viable than a main tank. It only makes sense to have them serve as an off tank until they are brought up to speed over a week or two, during which they can be funneled some gear to help them keep up with the already geared DPS.   Tanks don't just emerge fully formed from the womb ready to out threat god himself. You've got to raise them with kindness and care, until they grow up to be big and strong enough to laugh in the face of the oncoming deathlaser."

WildStar,3dzhco,serbaldrig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:51:04 2015 UTC,"I guess, i think it's more of a frustration rant since i've trained a new tank who despite proper gear, runes, spec and tactics, suffers from having a GA weapon.  I just really wanna see my stalker tank blossom :'( ...  Now i'm back to reality and i'm going to dig a hole due to the sheer amount of creepyness i just let out."
WildStar,3dzhco,Cammit261006,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:04:14 2015 UTC,"It's not about the weapon, it's simply about STalker Tanks having Threat issues to begin with.  Btw. Even if you put all your runes into SP your mitigation will still be higher than the one of a Engineer."
WildStar,3dzhco,Vexsin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:18:02 2015 UTC,"I geared up with my raid and have never had a threat problem. Although, burst threat is a increasing concern."
WildStar,3dzhco,stabberwocky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:50:43 2015 UTC,"Stalker threat is no engie threat - but with the proper rotation and feeding off warrior initial burst - you can do just fine.    Granted, if you don't get a lot of deflects at the start, it really does hurt TPS."
WildStar,3dzhco,serbaldrig,2,Tue Jul 21 15:32:53 2015 UTC,"Couple things here:  1) Bloodthirst threat comes from the number of people hit.  If another stalker tank is running it, or if they are out of range then the threat gen will be nonexistent.  2) You need to account for Void pact and other raid buffs on your tanks combat SP.  By that I mean, the tank is a lot farther up the DR ladder at that point.  Once deci procs, and all raid buffs are out the difference in threat between a 3100 SP tank and a 3300 tank is really not that much. If you want to ramp up threat, dumping it into sp is not the way to go (above 3100 ish).  The DR (for your combat SP) is gonna start hurtin ya.  Try crit instead at those gear levels."
WildStar,3dzhco,serbaldrig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:54 2015 UTC,"Right, thanks for the tip. I knew i should prolly go for crit instead but had little idea when to with decimate proc. So far i'm good on threat with gear alone, but the newer tanks is a whole 'nother story."
WildStar,3dzhco,stabberwocky,2,Tue Jul 21 17:50:11 2015 UTC,"Crit sounds good in theory, but unless you are getting it outside of runes it's going to be worse when you do the math for it. This is mostly because of tanks having virtually no Crit Sev naturally, which heavily devalues Crit. And SP DR doesn't start getting really bad until you get up to like 3.6k+ SP base, even with Stalker buffs. Never mind the fact that consistent burst threat from SP is superior to RNG threat from Crit. So until you get into mostly DS BiS gear, SP is going to be superior.  Some math if you don't believe me:  Assuming 12% Crit and 170% Crit Sev, 1% additional crit will give you  (100+13x0.7)/(100+12x0.7) = 1.00646 = 0.646% damage increase  Intuitively this is about as expected, as 1% Crit could give us a maximum of 0.7% damage increase. Now that 1% Crit takes 65 points to rune for, which would have given us 65x0.75 = 48.75 SP, let's call it 48 SP. We'll be assuming two different base SP levels for comparison purposes, 3.2k SP and 3.7k SP, with the following SP buffs:  25% (Decimate)  15% (Void Pact)  6.5% (PK Flame)  Total 46.5% SP  So plugging this into the AP/SP DR equation, we get:   3200 SP = 4539 SP after buffs  3248 SP = 4590 SP after buffs, 4590/4539 = 1.12% SP increase  3700 SP = 5028 SP after buffs  3748 SP = 5070 SP after buffs, 5070/5028 = 0.835% SP increase  I'll be conservative and say that 90% of damage from skills comes from SP, and the rest is base damage. This means that our two 48 SP increases at 3200 SP and 3700 SP base gives us 1.12x0.9 = 1.008% and 0.835x0.9 = 0.7515% damage increase respectively. So in both cases SP is superior both for the amount of damage it contributes and therefore threat it generates, and the consistency of the generation.   For fun I went back and threw in 100% Tech Mastery uptime (28% Tech, assumed best case of 17% SP increase), and SP in both cases still contributed more to damage than Crit did on a point for point basis."
WildStar,3dzhco,serbaldrig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:15:19 2015 UTC,"Why must you torture me so, when i'm 300km away from my spreadsheets???  Anyhow, you guys are giving me stuff to math out.  One small thing though is that Crit to SP isn't a 1:1 rune value right? If i set a SP rune into a slot and get 10 SP will i get 10 crit with a crit rune in the same slot?  Like how the conversion rate for health to armor is 21/71 or 71/21 the other way around."
WildStar,3dzhco,stabberwocky,2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:15 2015 UTC,"Already accounted for in the math. Crit:SP is 1:0.75, which is why I have 65 Crit rating -> ~48 Support Power. Also, all mathematical assumptions down there have been made in favour of Crit, so in reality SP will be slightly better than depicted there."
WildStar,3dzhco,serbaldrig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about runes, nor am I talking about crit at the expense of sp.  I'm talking about crit at the expense of d.crit rate, armor, or health in some cases (in the case of food/boosts).  There are several armor pieces with the exact same stats, except in the place of d. crit, there is crit rate.  Same with food and boosts.  Low level moxie milestones are easy to achieve."
WildStar,3dzhco,stabberwocky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:02:54 2015 UTC,"Then be specific, otherwise you are unintentionally misleading people.  I'm well aware of the couple good medium Medic DPS pieces that Stalkers can use from DS. I utilize the worthwhile ones for Engi Tank parsing myself (lol 10k DPS single target tank). Earth wing Medic Implant, and Avatus Medic Shield, plus a few marginal WA/SS from healer gear are also options."
WildStar,3dzhco,serbaldrig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:25:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not misleading anybody.  I'm relaying the data as I have experienced it.  My intent was never to tell anyone exactly what to do or use, that isn't any fun.  I'll be sure to give your specificity instructions all the weight I think they deserve.  The phrasing you use in your reply seems to have a bit of salt in it.  Rest assured, I meant no sass, just adding my bit.  I'm sure you know what you are doin and, like me, are trying to help out the newer tanks."

For the future, poorly worded advice from a position of authority can do more harm than no advice at all. It's worth taking the time to spell out exactly what you mean and ensure that it helps anyone else that stumbles upon it."
WildStar,3dzhco,somebears,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:04:47 2015 UTC,"For the future, just quoting someone doesnt make you right.  Just a heads up there.  Come down off of your shiny type-A ivory tower and re-read what I wrote.    I am telling them to 'try crit' as in, take some crit in some places and see if that helps.  It's not meant to be specific.  I'm literally NOT telling them exactly what to do.  It isn't 'poorly worded', its indistinct, for a reason.  I'm counting on the player to test, and then re-test.  Grota knows what he is doing, he doesnt need a breakdown of numbers, he already did that.  I am offering an avenue of pursuit.  If you don't like it, thats fine, no reason to turn into a quote queen."
WildStar,3dzhco,SLASHdk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:45:30 2015 UTC,"The problem is it is poorly worded. Instead, lacking a mentioned alternate after it links back to the previous statement. This makes the meaning of the final sentence   'Try crit instead (of SP) at those gear levels.'   Not quite what you wanted it to mean I imagine."
WildStar,3dzhco,SLASHdk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:16:18 2015 UTC,"It obviously depends on the class.  Engineers and stalkers should not have a hard time holding threat if they are close to the raid. I could hold threat against a few people in full DS gear. (was using the pvp weapon and a pretty weird build) so it is definitely possible. Our stalkers seem to do a lot of threat (Bloodthirst ist pretty strong afaik)  I do not know much about warriors, so can't comment on that  I had a very hard time when the raid was not close (eg phage maw)"
WildStar,3dzhco,zipn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:54:16 2015 UTC,"Stalkers might do more bursthreat with BT8 but my parses seems to suggest it's a TPS loss. The T4 bonus seems to count for both damage and the heal(leading to the threat increase you see), but it's 1-2k less TPS over time for me.  As far as i can see, stalkers need SP enough to hold threat, but once they have it, they have it.  Engi's don't need any special things they need beyond Code : Red AFAIK.  I have no idea about warriors. They also hate me so i don't think i can get any into on wheather they have the same problem."
WildStar,3dzhco,SLASHdk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:28:59 2015 UTC,"Code red is pretty good as a headstart, much like BT.Despite it being nerfed, Recursive matrix T4 still does a lot of threat"
WildStar,3dzhco,PlutoniumPa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:59:28 2015 UTC,Its not (only) the dmg/heal from bloodthirst that boost threat. Its the amount of people you buff aswell. Same goes for slinger's voidpact.

WildStar,3dwpwi,BlueBlazeIrregular88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:22:33 2015 UTC,"Didnt even thought that lopp could be made to max. For the regions, it is true that Blighthaven and R-12 are both crap to level, but the event in Blighthaven are mostly made while R-12 rarely.  I will level the Malgrave Expedition rep for sure or save up for a new one if that comes out."
WildStar,3dwpwi,seVan80,2,Mon Jul 20 04:59:51 2015 UTC,"Lopp can't be maxed. You get a certain amount by doing their quests as you level, and you can't get any more after that. Digging up the shinies in Whitevale gives Exile/Dominion rep, not Lopp rep, and they don't have a voucher trade-in NPC."
WildStar,3dwpwi,froggus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:52:51 2015 UTC,"Blighthaven is actually really easy these days, it was the first rep I got to max on my newest alt. With Scorchwing and failtree as contracts, there are a lot more people in that zone on a daily basis than there used to be, and you can usually convince a few people to do Elyona > Heart of the Swamp > Tree after Scorchwing. Plus, the new solo dailies in that zone grant a ton of rep. Defile is the second easiest, because the quests also give a lot of rep (and Lightspire is often a contract too). After that was Northern Wastes, which somehow I got to max at double the rate of Crimson Badlands which makes no sense. Star-Comm is the slowest daily zone rep-wise. If you're counting the R-12 faction, then that one may or may not be the slowest, depending on how often you can find a group for it on your server. TL;DR Star-Comm or R12."
WildStar,3dwpwi,froggus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:49:54 2015 UTC,"Guardians of the Grove is actually ridiculously easy to grind for now.  Between some solo quests for rep they added recently and an ENORMOUS boost to rep per quest (seriously, I think it's like 700 per quest,) it's one of the easiest to complete, behind the Defile."
WildStar,3dwpwi,ProxAlert,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:04:43 2015 UTC,"Is it me or is the Star-Comm Basin reputation really painful to get?

WildStar,3dwpwi,Foxaves,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:12:27 2015 UTC,Star-Comm is the newest faction with lots of (fun) solo quests. In my opinion Carbine did a good job with it. It´s ok for me you can´t max it in one week.

WildStar,3dwpwi,NekoNova,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:34:54 2015 UTC,"This is incorrect, there are now several soloable quests there, and frankly, in my opinion it is the easiest zone to max out in the game by far."

WildStar,3dwpwi,Timiniel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:20:50 2015 UTC,"Guardian of the grove is by far the easiest rep to grind now, it has 3 daylie quests each day that is super easy and super fast to do.

WildStar,3dwpwi,KUSHimaru,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:03:19 2015 UTC,The Malgrave rep technically has no daily cap. If you're good as soloing all the mobs who give rep can be solo by any class and you can get rep there all day.
