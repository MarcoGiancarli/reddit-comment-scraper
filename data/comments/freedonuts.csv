freedonuts,39av8t,nevz1983,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:45:56 2015 UTC,"from /u/tstohacker to ""us""   ""FYI the hospital quest issue was fixed back in December - they made it so that Dr Hibbert wasn't ""occupied"" by the Chester Dupuis questline and therefore could still trigger the quests leading up to the Hospital. There may be a small number of players who got him stuck prior to the bug fix, and they may still require our help. But usually when people complain about not getting the Hospital quest, it's because they need to have an Orange House in their town for one of the pre-requisite quests to fire."""

Edit your post after reading through it. Also finish off what you had written down by the feedback link. I think there are chunks missing from it  /u/mking6543
freedonuts,390f2y,nevz1983,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:03:10 2015 UTC,"Good day. You probably just copy and pasted this from the Giver Help page (I know because it's my post), but I noticed a few things you need to change in your post.   Click the ""Thumbs up"" icon - It is no longer a Thumbs up icon but an arrow up. the donut icon next to your username - This is no longer a donut. It's now an envelope. You will only be helped once per 20 days - This is now 60 days.   Also, the amounts you are allowed to give have been increased to 20K donuts and 20 million cash, if you decide you want to give that much.  Otherwise, the post looks fine.  Good Luck.

freedonuts,37lg4t,phaerietales,1 point,Thu May 28 14:09:34 2015 UTC,"Hi. I had a similar problem during the event where my Murderpuss kept punching, my Easter Island God kept rocking and a number of my houses kept spouting smoke. I also had the odd 'bits' of the wrong item overlaid around my town. I got around it be either: tapping the item or moving around my Springfield so that the screen refreshed. Since the end of the Terwilliger event, I haven't had the problem (as yet!). Hope this is of some help."
freedonuts,37lg4t,PROFessorMorrynarty,1 point,Thu May 28 18:53:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying, I've had those sort of things before and what you say to fix it has always worked in the past. But this is things like ALL my fences blinking at once. I've tried moving them and it still doesn't help any. I posted the same question on the normal tapped out thread and they said something about the update to the operating system but I don't really understand!"
freedonuts,37lg4t,PROFessorMorrynarty,1 point,Thu May 28 21:00:51 2015 UTC,"Hi. I guess what they mean depends on what you are playing it on (obvious I know but hey....!). I play mainly on an iPad 2 and that's what I had the problems on. I have updated the iOs to 8.3 and it may be that that was what sorted it. You could try a direct question to EA on their site but, other than that, I don't know what to suggest. Sorry."
freedonuts,37lg4t,justice626,1 point,Fri May 29 13:27:45 2015 UTC,you may need to uninstall your app and reinstall it and hope that helps... it sounds like your catch needs to be cleaned tho
