Kirby,3e5yev,I_want_hard_work,2,Wed Jul 22 07:06:59 2015 UTC,"-I wish the TV games came out earlier in the console's lifespan. Half the time by the time a Kirby game comes out, everyone is too busy oohing and aahing over whatever the newest system is to give Kirby the love he deserves (Dreamland 3 came out in 1997 on the SNES. Return to Dreamland came out in 2011).   -I wish more TV console games came out in general. This is thankfully a trend that appears to be changing, considering we got Epic Yarn, Return to Dreamland, and Rainbow Curse all in the last 5 years when the last Kirby platformer before that was KIRBY 64. Which came out on the Nintendo 64 in 2000 (see above gripe).   -The only thing in any of the games that irked me is how in Return to Dreamland, you can never -choose- to be Meta Knight, Bandana Dee, or Dedede. That should've been an unlockable feature after beating the game because if you're the only Kirby fan in your circle of friends, you never get to really see or use any of the other characters. You can always do it with 2 Wiimotes or hacking a code in, but those are annoying workarounds to something that should be a choice at startup."
Kirby,3e5yev,Oldneovet,2,Wed Jul 22 13:10:19 2015 UTC,"Really wish they didn't increase the knockback and make Kirby more sensitive (Anything sharp takes away abilities on the first hit. no exceptions.) in Triple Deluxe, KTD is still a really good game, though."

Kirby,3e33ne,TheDeadConspiracy,12,Tue Jul 21 16:33:51 2015 UTC,"My friend and I used to fantasize about a Wii U KAR. With the success of MK8, I think it would do amazingly."
Kirby,3e33ne,Guavajava,9,Tue Jul 21 17:02:40 2015 UTC,City Trial Online.
Kirby,3e33ne,SSBM_Ogma,6,Tue Jul 21 17:03:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, please"
Kirby,3e33ne,Guavajava,4,Tue Jul 21 17:41:35 2015 UTC,One for me as well.
Kirby,3e33ne,goldmaster11,5,Tue Jul 21 21:00:52 2015 UTC,"I would want a follow-up of Kirby Air Ride on Wii U, or NX. It should have content from the original GameCube game, and new content as well. The good thing is that they can even introduce new DLC, so the game could last longer, and stay fresh."
Kirby,3e33ne,Flare457,3,Tue Jul 21 17:31:19 2015 UTC,Someone needs to make a list of ideas for a possible KAR2.
Kirby,3e33ne,Flare457,5,Tue Jul 21 18:24:25 2015 UTC,• Online • Larger city/ More than one city • DLC maps over time • DLC vehicles
Kirby,3e33ne,Chris-P-Creme,6,Tue Jul 21 18:30:05 2015 UTC,"And maybe... • More playable characters (Helpers with permanent abilities, but unchangeable Air Ride? idk.) • Powers like in Smash Run, where it can be activated on the get go, (Abilities, Vehicles? maybe not. [like a random vehicle?] Green Box Items, Stat Boosts, etc.) • Multiple City Trial maps, or better yet, rename the gamemode so it doesn't have to be just a City. • Much more Tracks. • More Kirby colors. • More Legendary Air Rides. (8 Legendaries, and one that requires two parts, but is the hardest to build)"
Kirby,3e33ne,Flare457,5,Tue Jul 21 19:18:27 2015 UTC,"I like a lot of these ideas, but 8 legendaries is too many. 4 at the most."
Kirby,3e33ne,Chris-P-Creme,3,Tue Jul 21 20:51:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would be too many, but they should do SOMETHING about the letter concept... Wait, I got it! maybe 3 Legendaries for most modes, and when you find all the parts for them, you get a new mode where you race Legendary Air Rides. And in that mode, 5 more Legendaries are available, but only for that mode."
Kirby,3e33ne,Flare457,3,Tue Jul 21 20:57:05 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, that's an interesting concept. I like the idea of a decent sized (8-10) collection of legendaries, but each city trial-style map only features a select 3 of the collection. All the maps add to have all of the machines. In addition, there is your proposed legendary-racing mode, and each time you collect all the pieces of one in the ""city trial"" mode it is unlocked for the racing mode."
Kirby,3e33ne,Davester123,3,Tue Jul 21 21:04:08 2015 UTC,"Of course... It would make sense to give 3 Legendaries to one map. One map could have the original 2, and then the 2-Part Legendary (the most difficult to build) then 2 other maps, with 3 each. and the reason there's 9, is to follow the letter pattern they started. like Parts A, B, and C, and Parts X, Y, and Z."
Kirby,3e33ne,Forotosh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:12:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe each round, three random legendaries are available, so you can't rely on one legendary you really like, and have to understand all of them. Maybe each round, there's two three piece ones, and one two piece one. Maybe even a mode where each part gives certain ualities, and you can mix and match them."

If you owned a 3DS within the first yearish of it's release, before the price drop, you got 10 free NES games (which are now on the virtual console), and 10 free GBA games, on your 3DS.  There is no real GBA Virtual Console on 3DS, I believe it runs on the old DS firmware or something, and they've said they have no real plans to bring GBA VC to 3DS or N3DS.  So it's not likely."
Kirby,3e3gtj,KingBubblie,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:08 2015 UTC,"to add onto this, even if they added GBA VC to the 3ds they wouldnt add any off the ambassador games, and if they did there would be huge backlash as they said the GBA games would never be available to non ambassador 3ds owners"

""Omg guys Kirby doesn't stop evil very fast and he kills a tree sometimes."" aren't good arguments.  Also he has so many ""why [game character] isn't a hero"" videos that there really isn't a point to watching them. If you go out of your way to tell me that every single video game protagonist isn't a hero I'm not.going to listen to you.  Sorry OP I know you aren't the video maker but I just wanted to rant here. I'll give you the upvote though because this content is relevant to the sub."
Kirby,3dwp8v,LucentNargacuga,5,Tue Jul 21 00:58:32 2015 UTC,"All of Nicobbq's reasons are wrong in the video. They are easily debunked.   Kirby did make some mistakes, such as blaming King Dedede for trouble. But, evil cannot be simply stopped instantly, in some stories, they show that it can take some times, even years to stop. Also, he is basing this reason only on Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, and not the other games. He needed to attack Whispy Woods for self-defense. Even though he can inhale innocent characters, the game doesn't require you to inhale them. He does not puke in their mouths. He kisses them, and it regenerates the helper's health, or the health of other player characters. He doesn't completely promote fast food. In the games, some of the foods are healthy.   And finally, it's obvious in the games, and the anime, that Kirby is a hero."

Yo-Yo is generally a great power all round, I now have a soft spot for Jet as it's badass and Water and Animal were as fun as all hell to play with; Water is great for bosses and Animal is super fun when you get the scrolls in Squeak Squad. I can live without Bell, though. Unless they buff it in future, it's far too situational to be useful."

Kirby,3dmpdb,meuol,8,Fri Jul 17 15:30:28 2015 UTC,"I would reccomend kirby triple deluxe. It captures the kirby charm perfectly. There is no challenge but if you look for collectibles , the game will keep you busy. The 2 side games are also quite fun.  Also, the game takes advantage of the 3d well with the multiple planes."
Kirby,3dmpdb,noirlucario,7,Fri Jul 17 16:52:54 2015 UTC,The GBA Kirby games were amazing (the first one being a remake of Kirby's adventure). Other than those I would recommend Return To Dreamland.  Why didn't you like Kirby 64? Have you thought of revisiting it?

Kirby,3dmpdb,Karmic_Backlash,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:11:05 2015 UTC,"I was somewhere toward that awkward age where we start to be less enamored with the things we loved as a young kid, because we lose the childhood capacity for simple pure enjoyment. Then as we mature we can develop appreciation for these things in a different sense, but that is probably why I did not like it. I did not like Majora's Mask either, and looking back, it was probably the best Zelda game, but since it used bits and scraps from Ocarina, I tended to dislike how different it was. I compared it to Ocarina, which had an extremely consistent artistic and thematic direction which made the world so convincing. Majora's mask is more than one story. It's a parallel world on a cartridge. There are many unrelated things going on to enjoy. I did not appreciate its scope. I expected a tight knit single thread of a story like in Ocarina. Kirby 64 was different from the predecessors too, and I think at that age I expected game developers to just give me the next chapter in what they already gave me, and to not take things in major new directions."

Kirby,3deds4,LolwutPie,14,Wed Jul 15 16:50:22 2015 UTC,I can't wait for the inevitable Kirby's BBQ Adventure where all the characters are variations of uncooked meat.
Kirby,3deds4,TheGraic,10,Wed Jul 15 19:43:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, so Kirby's Adventure."
Kirby,3deds4,Magnemania,9,Wed Jul 15 20:37:45 2015 UTC,"So basically this, more or less?  Alternatively."
Kirby,3deds4,Cardboard_Boxer,5,Thu Jul 16 01:02:08 2015 UTC,Why are his eyes purple?
Kirby,3deds4,Forotosh,7,Thu Jul 16 02:44:21 2015 UTC,He got high from eating a substance derived from shrooms.
Kirby,3deds4,Cardboard_Boxer,4,Thu Jul 16 02:46:21 2015 UTC,"((in all seriousness, his eye colour changes depending on his mood, I think. I may be wrong))"

Kirby,3dctcv,Cardboard_Boxer,3,Wed Jul 15 07:04:37 2015 UTC,Well done! That was really well written; I'd be shocked if they didn't pick it.

Kirby,3cwvv5,KingOfRedLions,3,Sat Jul 11 15:37:35 2015 UTC,"Same here, but it wasn't just from his mispronunciation of dedede lol"

Kirby,3cwvv5,Charizard-Volt,3,Sat Jul 11 15:58:58 2015 UTC,"That might be true, but it just occurred to me that the smash announcer pronounces it Dee-Dee-Dee. So, I'm assuming the official English pronunciation is that."
Kirby,3cwvv5,JowlesMcGee,2,Sat Jul 11 16:21:50 2015 UTC,"It's sort of similar to the ""L's being R sounds"" in Japan. It's just how the language is/their accent.  Hopefully, that comes out less racist than I intended."

Kirby,3csxhs,Charizard-Volt,7,Fri Jul 10 14:48:30 2015 UTC,Remind me when Kirby has ever killed a God. Nothing is ringing any bells.
Kirby,3csxhs,Jafoob,9,Fri Jul 10 21:44:36 2015 UTC,"Necrodeus. Based on etymology, it's a god."
Kirby,3csxhs,Cobalt288,5,Fri Jul 10 23:10:04 2015 UTC,Goddess Sectonia I guess? She took over a whole planet with vines so that deserves some credit.  The clay equivalent to Master Hand in Rainbow Paintbrush/Super Rainbow/Rainbow Curse?
Kirby,3csxhs,dizzyzane_,4,Fri Jul 10 23:33:08 2015 UTC,"Necrodeus means ""Death God"" in Greek/Latin.  Sectonia claimed to be a goddess in the Japanese translation, though that just may have just been her vanity speaking."

Kirby,3ctjcs,Oldneovet,-1,Mon Jul 13 15:03:37 2015 UTC,"One of those is a port of a console game anyway, so it's not really supporting your argument.  And another is just god awful."

Kirby,3ctjcs,Higejolly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:57:10 2015 UTC,"The Hypernova ability is garbage and IMO destroys the flow of the game. The rest of the experience more than makes up for it, though; I love that game.  Mass Attack, though, is a three level minigame that was, for some reason, stretched to about the length of a full game. It's not even a particularly good minigame, and others included on the card are wildly superior (in part because they know that they're minigames and aren't trying to stretch themselves thin)."

Kirby,3ciuws,Terragatr,8,Wed Jul 8 11:28:11 2015 UTC,"Ooohhh… I'm gonna find that! Homebrew the vWii and install Nintendon't. You can play GameCube games you've ripped (or otherwise retrieved) using a Wii or Wii U's vWii. Sounds convoluted but hey, it can be uninstalled which won't void your warranty if you wipe all data of its use, unlike a mod chip or similar."
Kirby,3ciuws,TheLastDooD,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:07:55 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. I was waiting for modders to create something like this. Haven't looked into Wii homebrew in a long time. Anyway, do you know it they made the gamecube adapter compatible with the gamecube games on Wii U?"
Kirby,3ciuws,ZippoS,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:18:37 2015 UTC,Yes. It is 100% compatible with the GC adapter. … Which I use extensively to play other games including MKDD & F-Zero GX/AX.
Kirby,3cfkiq,wyndyteeee,4,Tue Jul 7 15:02:36 2015 UTC,Kirby looks so happy finding his name! He always has such trouble with the personalized pens and magnets and what not. Goes straight from Karl to Kirsten.

Kirby,3cc7at,rashid411,16,Mon Jul 6 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"If they made a sequel, I'd make a squeal."
Kirby,3cc7at,Multivers,8,Mon Jul 6 20:53:37 2015 UTC,A sequel to Air Ride and another Metroidvania Kirby game (like Amazing Mirror) is all I want in this world.
Kirby,3cc7at,Chris-P-Creme,2,Mon Jul 6 20:10:35 2015 UTC,"Amazing Mirror was the best.  It was my first Kirby game.  I was so disappointed when I played that game and then played Return to Dreamland or Nightmare in Dreamland or whatever the hell it was called on the GBA.  I expected an open world, not levels."
Kirby,3cc7at,SuperNanoCat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:53:00 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's a shame. My first Kirby game was Nightmare in Dreamland, and I loved it. I think playing NID first was good, because it kind of sets the groundwork for the franchise. It has allowed me to love the other games based on that formula, such as Squeak Squad and Return to Dreamland. But Amazing Mirror is a step up from that, and it will always be my favorite Kirby (and in my top 5 favorite games). I am still holding out for another open world title, and if there is another already out there hiding from me, someone fucking tell me."
Kirby,3cc7at,Chris-P-Creme,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:18:51 2015 UTC,"I just realized that I never finished a Kirby game other than the Amazing Mirror.  I think the whole adventure and exploration thing kept me hooked.  Levels don't do it for me.  This is why my Mario games never get finished.  It's not that I didn't enjoy the more traditional Kirby games.  It's just that they didn't hook me like Amazing Mirror did.  I still can't believe Nintendo never revisited the Amazing Mirror format, or bothered making a sequel to Air Ride."
Kirby,3cc7at,SuperNanoCat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:47:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Amazing Mirror and Air Ride are my favorite in the franchise, so I'm kind of bummed they HAL hasn't gone anywhere with either of them."
Kirby,3cc7at,Chris-P-Creme,7,Tue Jul 7 05:57:56 2015 UTC,"Same here, I want a sequel to this more than any other video game on any console/handheld.  I got all 3 checklists completed & everything."
Kirby,3cc7at,SuperKirbyFan,4,Mon Jul 6 19:58:59 2015 UTC,"My friends and I have been playing this game for YEARS, checklist completions are a dime a dozen. Honestly though, City Trial was by FAR the best mode; I don't think I'm the only one who thinks so. I really hope that if they did make a sequel they'd recognize the importance of keeping it."
Kirby,3cc7at,hcnye,3,Tue Jul 7 02:57:24 2015 UTC,"They could honestly just expand on the current formula. The same game, but bigger, more characters/stars, more copy abilities, better graphics, more tracks for the racing modes, bigger check lists, more event matches, and several more maps with the City Trial game mode. Add in online connectivity and you have a kick-ass game. I honestly think the only main change that needs to occur is a level of stat customization for the Air Ride mode. Either that or they add in an absurd number of stars so anyone could find the exact ride they are looking for."
Kirby,3cc7at,Chris-P-Creme,5,Tue Jul 7 05:27:43 2015 UTC,"A 3DS sequel that mainly focused on city trial, with more than one city to mess around in, would be my dream game."
Kirby,3cc7at,EvilSock,3,Tue Jul 7 03:10:33 2015 UTC,"I wish people didn't bag on it so much but my dream Kirby game is an Air Ride sequel, but with more charas and more good surprises in store"

Kirby,3cc7at,ZippoS,3,Tue Jul 7 13:20:01 2015 UTC,"I've said it many times to lots of my friends that this game deserves a sequel. Since the mechanics aren't too complicated, I don't see why cross-compatability be a thing with the 3DS and Wii U."
Kirby,3cc7at,hocotate,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:03:31 2015 UTC,"ehh, it was just average racing with kirby characters."
Kirby,3cdvr3,Zachabo53,4,Tue Jul 7 03:42:12 2015 UTC,"Personally, I've always been a big fan of Marx. With Superstar being my first Kirby game, I've always seen him as one of my personal enemies growing up. But as I got older, I can see that he is brimming with so much personality with his design alone and I absolutely adore it.  Plus, his theme sounds like it's a circus gone mad or something, which compliments his jester look very well."
Kirby,3cdvr3,Mr_YadoR,5,Tue Jul 7 05:50:44 2015 UTC,"Queen Sectonia without a doubt. She's really one of the the only boss fights I replay from time-to-time; The culmination of music, visuals, and atmosphere get me so pumped each time I play."
Kirby,3cdvr3,Jeff1pnt3,4,Wed Jul 8 04:45:02 2015 UTC,"Magolor, because he's pretty much Marx up to eleven"
Kirby,3cdvr3,Charizard-Volt,4,Tue Jul 7 10:11:17 2015 UTC,"Sectonia (Triple Deluxe), Lady Ivy (Mass Attack), and Computer Virus (Super Star) are all good contenders."
Kirby,3cdvr3,Cardboard_Boxer,2,Tue Jul 7 17:20:46 2015 UTC,Zero 2. It has an awesome fight theme and had a cool design.  And the blood. Can't forget about that.
Kirby,3cdvr3,MasterofYoshis,2,Wed Jul 8 02:20:21 2015 UTC,"King Dedede from the first Kirby's Dreamland.   Kind of a cliche choice, but before I got into Sonic through the S&K Collection on PC or got an N64 and LEGO Racers, Kirby's Dreamland was the first video game I played and beat start to finish, and King Dedede was essentially the first final boss fight I ever fought."
Kirby,3cdvr3,Forotosh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:08:55 2015 UTC,Nightmare from Kirby's Adventure.
Kirby,3cdvr3,sfrankdaddy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:10:13 2015 UTC,"Miracle Matter is mine. I absolutely loved the boss music from the Kirby 64 game, and his unique mechanic of only being damaged by the copy ability he dropped was pretty cool. Also because I never knew O2 existed until very recently because I neve 100% the game before."
Kirby,3cdvr3,LaserGlow_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:16:55 2015 UTC,"I've always had a soft spot for Kracko, a living cloud that wants to do you harm. A simple yet creative idea for a boss. Was great seeing him return so powered up in Triple Deluxe."
Kirby,3cdvr3,Mutasyn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:01:06 2015 UTC,"I really got a kick out of the turn-based digital boss fight in The Great Adventure in Superstar. The level up portion at the end was a nice touch.  Otherwise, I'm thinking the Meta Knight fight from Superstar."
Kirby,3cdvr3,OddballXP,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:59:21 2015 UTC,"Lor Starcutter, and then the final boss after it, Spoiler  The music for both is amazing, but I like the former more.  I certainly didn't expect a shmup in that game.  Nor did I expect Spoiler  I really enjoyed all the twists."
Kirby,3cdvr3,MeatandSokkasm,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:17:41 2015 UTC,Nightmare is up there for me; I would always see how close I could make it to the time limit without losing
Kirby,3cdvr3,NotLockedLP,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"Aside from Meta Knight, Landia from Return to Dreamland is for me. I found the fight very fun and loved how they spiced it up mid way through. I also found it to be one of the tougher bosses in the game."
Kirby,3cb065,UncannyFart,8,Mon Jul 6 14:33:17 2015 UTC,"I'd personally recommend either Kirby Super Star Ultra, Kirby's Return to Dreamland (Known as Kirby Adventure Wii in Europe) or Kirby Triple Deluxe. Depending on which platform you currently have, of course or it's up to your preference as Triple Deluxe is the most recent game so it may be the best choice."
Kirby,3cb065,LaserGlow_,5,Mon Jul 6 14:40:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know how popular this game was but Kirby Air Ride was tons of fun. Its a racing game though, not like other kirby games. i also really liked Kirby's Adventure but if you can't stand the dull colors I'd get the remake KirbyNightmare in Dream Land"
Kirby,3cb065,robskul,2,Mon Jul 6 18:33:30 2015 UTC,"Kirby Superstar Ultra! Very easy to get into, due to the game being divided into smaller games."
Kirby,3cb065,deepfriedliterature,2,Mon Jul 6 16:02:51 2015 UTC,"You can't really go wrong. Like others say it depends on what systems you own, but the games don't really follow  an overarching story or anything, so you can jump right into all of them. The only problem you might face is playing a newer game with deeper gameplay then trying to go back and play an older game. But if you have no desire to play the golden oldies, then jump right into something current!"
Kirby,3cb065,BigFudge117,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:17:13 2015 UTC,"You can't really go wrong.   Well, I wouldn't exactly go that far. Stuff like Canvas/Rainbow Curse, Block Ball, Star Stacker, Dream Course, Air Ride, Avalanche, Epic Yarn, etc are probably worse starting points, since their gameplay is so different from the normal gameplay in the series."

The final boss gauntlet at Mt. Dedede is no joke in Dreamland, either."

Dreamland was the first game I ever beat, anything else I played before was educational games, Asteroids and Centepedes, or me fruitlessly trying to make it through Darkwing Duck GB or the Game & Watch GBC games.

Kirby,3b3sas,SonicGamer74,9,Thu Jun 25 22:06:03 2015 UTC,I don't understand why I my opinion on this is unpopular but... Man they need to stop locking out features with amiibo. Its getting quite excessive.
Kirby,3b3sas,Dyxlesci,16,Thu Jun 25 19:22:27 2015 UTC,I read on /r/WiiU that you can unlock the skins doing challenges? I may be mistaken though and it might have meant an Amiibo unlocks a challenge that earns you the skin.
Kirby,3b3sas,Shoozicle,6,Thu Jun 25 20:09:18 2015 UTC,You can unlock the skins through the 100-Mario challenge as well as amiibo.
Kirby,3b3sas,Shadowclonier,3,Thu Jun 25 21:25:09 2015 UTC,"Indeed, so yet another feature that, contrary to popular belief, is available otherwise."
Kirby,3b3sas,whizzer0,4,Fri Jun 26 17:03:12 2015 UTC,The amiibo's have to do something and it's only a skin
Kirby,3b3sas,LordThaddeus,5,Thu Jun 25 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"other people have said this already but im gonna say it too,  thankfully this isnt locked to only amiibo. there are 100 challenges in the game with the 100 mario challenge, and 100 costumes, each challenge will probably unlock a costume. BUT if there is an amiibo of a character who has a costume, you can scan the amiibo to unlock the costume early."
Kirby,3b3sas,Shadowkirby1234,5,Thu Jun 25 21:30:22 2015 UTC,"My only issue in terms of that is how they handled Mario Party; hiding multiple boards behind Amiibo is just scummy.  Otherwise, the Amiibo stuff seems small and inconsequential. Nothing game-breaking."

Kirby,3b3sas,BlueJoshi,2,Fri Jun 26 01:59:02 2015 UTC,So far same characters have performed the same function in different games. You can use the Mario Party Mario to be Mario in Smash and vice versa. That will probably be the case here.

It's shown that in dreamland they need to brush and somehow Kirby sort of brushes (despite having no teeth to clean...) they need some way to keep their teeth clean or they'll just just deteriorate from bacteria breaking them down.  When it comes to Waddle Dees they really are quite unusual and with as far as I know have no explanation of how they biologically work."

Kirby,3anedi,coppytop,18,Sun Jun 21 22:46:30 2015 UTC,"Somewhat. Most of it's vague. The series is more lore based than story based.   The Star Rod was forged from a fallen star according to the manual for Kirby's Adventure. Kirby is not a native to the Kingdom of Dream Land, having rolled in one day on a puff of air. This was revealed on a figurine within Rainbow Curse. Shiver Star, a level in Kirby 64, is heavily implied to be a post-apocalyptic earth. A few official materials said that the inhabitants abandoned the planet long ago. Drawcia, the final boss from Canvas Curse, is the sister of Paintera, a minor boss in Triple Deluxe. They were separated at 'birth' and abandoned by their painter. This was all revealed in Triple Deluxe, with a bit more detail in the Japanese version.  Return to Dream Land revealed that Nova, the Star Rod, and many of the other artifacts seen throughout the series were created by a group known as the 'ancients.'"

Kirby,3anedi,Cardboard_Boxer,2,Mon Jun 22 06:52:07 2015 UTC,Sooo I'm looking for something backing up what I said and I'm not seeing it.  Hrm.  Lemme ask some of my old KRR pals about it and I'll either give you more exact information or admit I'm full of crap.
Kirby,3anedi,BlueJoshi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:36:55 2015 UTC,"Whatever happened to Rainbow Resort, anyway? The main page hasn't been updated since last October and registration to the forums seems to be disabled. Did the userbase go somewhere else?"
Kirby,3anedi,Cardboard_Boxer,3,Mon Jun 22 17:09:15 2015 UTC,"Oh man, there's a whole big story to that.  So because I guess it fucking matters at this point, I was mostly on the forum ends of things.  I mention this, because towards the end the people taking care of the site proper... apparently hated us?  I guess they were not big on the idea of ""online communities"" (so why get so involved in one?) and resented the fact that we didn't help out around the site (because they refused to give us any sort of access to the site and wouldn't explain things like how their custom comment system worked when we eventually did get access).  They also had an admitted disinterest in ever playing any of the new Kirby games, so no new info on them would be likely to ever go up.  Anyway, eventually, some of us dirty forum-goers managed to get FTP access to the main site so that we could do things like update pages and make news posts.  The guys who had been maintaining the front page for a while, despite their apparently resentment towards us for not helping out on the front page... didn't like us muscling in on their turf?  So they basically flipped the table, took their toys, and went home.  So we had to rebuild some stuff.  Around this time I found out that one of our old staff members had, for a class project, made a new page setup for KRR.  It was really cool, and I got in contact with her to see if we could actually use it, and we got the go-ahead for that.  We had a couple guys lined up to make the new layout a reality, started converting old pages to the new format (which was something, lemme tell ya, because the old pages were coded in straight HTML.  This update woulda moved all the formatting stuff to CSS, which would have made future updates wayyyy easier to implement), and even started writing some stuff for the newer games!  It was good times all around.  ...Until the site's owners, who are kind of absentee rulers, vetoed the new layout.  That was... a huge let down for me, my friends, and everyone else working on the project, and kind of killed any momentum.  The site continued slowly languishing, and... a lot of us just kind of moved on in the span of like two years.  We never really recovered from the veto, and sort of resented it, and just... moved on.  To Skype, to other message boards, to here.  It's kinda depressing, whenever I stop to think about it :/ At some point I think Disk closed registrations on the forum because it was just getting attacked by bots.  I still love KRR, and I hold no ill-will against the owners.  But I feel like due to this and several earlier decisions (which are way too long to get into here), it sorta.. missed the boat, and isn't as relevant as a fansite, anymore, or even as a discussion hub/message board.  All that story up there, btw?  You'll probably get a completely different one if you ask someone involved in the front page's community.  There was some weird antagonism there, which I thing was mostly driven by the brothers who ended up running things for a while.  I can't promise you that my version is real and their version a lie, although I'd like to think mine is at least more factual (I probably did get a couple details out of order, though, and glossed over a lot).  I might still have some saved files of little essays one of them wrote up that corroborate some of my more contentious claims, but even those could be faked, or might just be out of context.  I also have some actually cool files, like some of the new pages were were going to add, and the original draft of the new layout, which I'm not sure I'd be at liberty to share."
Kirby,3anedi,BlueJoshi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:08:14 2015 UTC,"That whole thing sounds tragic.   One concern of mine is with all the information on the website. Without anyone updating it I fear that it'll just shut down one day. It would be terrible if all the historical data (such as the instruction booklet scans, manga scans, etc.) was lost.  I wish there was some way to properly preserve all that."

Kirby,3anedi,BlueJoshi,9,Mon Jun 22 22:09:20 2015 UTC,A lot of dark matter being a dick and possessing people.
Kirby,3anedi,manfartwish,5,Mon Jun 22 00:04:14 2015 UTC,"Recent games have seen a lot of background details and story pop up if you look for it. Mainly pause screen descriptions and dialog for characters that have it (btw, any question you may have can now be easily answered with ""ancients, ain't gotta explain shit"").  Triple Deluxe is chock full of it since every boss has a description in the pause menu, and it gets crazier when you read through some of the behind the scenes miiverse posts, expanding on many of those descriptions and at times giving new stuff all together (all the different moons in the series? each canon and separate)  There's too much to go over in one post, but for example, Triple Deluxe and its final boss have some of the most extensive lore and background the series has seen."
Kirby,3anedi,dalp3000,2,Mon Jun 22 04:04:08 2015 UTC,"I had no idea that there as a behind the scenes page for Drum Dash/Fighters Deluxe. It's interesting that they gave some more information about Magolor's fate:   Magolor's whereabouts are uncertain after Kirby's Return to Dream Land, but he seems pretty lively here. After roaming around the dimension beyond space and time, he might've found an exit. When Kirby and his friends returned home, maybe Magolor traveled around building theme parks in different worlds.   I assumed that he just died. Go figure."
Kirby,3anedi,Cardboard_Boxer,5,Mon Jun 22 06:02:18 2015 UTC,"Magolor was pretty much dead after RtDL until Dream Collection showed him alive and well and making a theme park as forgiveness for the events that transpired. There was a pretty big question as to how he survived and while this slightly answers it, it puts importance to it and surrounds his return in mystery. What is the dimension beyond space and time? his body disappeared at his defeat so its not Another Dimension, it sounds like hell if you ask me. And just how did he find an exit form a place outside of time and space?  Also I really enjoy the whole mini arc of him developing a passion for theme park building. I originally thought it came out of nowhere, but if you think about the context of RtDL it makes perfect sense. Magolor retrieves the Lor and upgrades and modifies it, who knows what he added but I doubt ancients included mini games and challenge stages in their original design. These are things the Lor doesn't need yet he built and probably enjoyed doing so, and are framed story wise as attractions. Its no surprise once his universal domination plans fail he falls back to expanding on what started as a hobby. He must enjoys seeing Kirby try out his challenges, and fittingly for his character he probably takes extreme joy in Kirby's suffering through them, he even races Kirby for some friendly hurting. So the Extra Challange Stages are as much a gift for Kirby as they are one for himself. This just keeps going for Drum Dash and the Deluxe version, except tailored for Dedede this time. Some of the stages can be truly evil sometimes, its quite fitting that this smug motherfucker made them."
Kirby,3anedi,dalp3000,2,Mon Jun 22 06:41:14 2015 UTC,"Given that were dealing with dimensions beyond space and time, I'd wager the Magolor seen in Dream Collection may well be a Magolor from a parallel universe altogether. One who ultimately resisted the allure of the Master Crown and resents the fact that he tried to use someone who only wanted to help him out of the kindness of his heart. Kirby made this other Magolor realize that ultimate power wasn't what he sought, but friendship - contrary to the one we defeat in RtDL who was obsessed with power, corrupted by the thought of obtaining ultimate power. For his betrayal, although absolved by Kirby and his friends, I'd wager, he either takes the Lor with him or has Landia combine the powers of the Master Crown with the Lor's interdimensional transporter to create a portal to a completely new universe. One where he succumbed to his desires and was defeated, and one where he wants to make it up to everyone. But, since he still wants to see what Kirby and Dedede of this new dimension are capable of, he devises some courses for them to prove themselves in.  Yes it sounds like bad fanfiction, but we know the Lor to be capable of interdimensional travel and the Master Crown of amplifying its wielder's powers. It's a possibility, not what actually might have happened."

It would be neat to see that integrated into a regular game. A lack of Mirror Kirby within Kirby and the Amazing Mirror is a ridiculously missed opportunity. If they ever make a sequel, they need to bring the Mirror Ability back. Super Abilities and Hypernova need to return. I'd like to see Paint return, if only for a pause screen description to explain what in the world is going on with the attack."
Kirby,3ahu6b,Cardboard_Boxer,2,Sat Jun 20 16:15:33 2015 UTC,"Yes! Yo-yo was one of my favorite abilities playing SSU, and I hope they use the clean ability sometime again, I mean it even appeared in the anime."

Kirby,3ahu6b,fnordycrib,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:08:06 2015 UTC,"I think that's why I liked the Super Abilities: because they were spread out so much, you didn't get to use them very often, so when you did, it really felt special smashing through everything.

Kirby,39frkh,supafst,14,Thu Jun 11 12:42:52 2015 UTC,"I mean, there's the obligatory Superstar (Ultra) mention, as probably the finest put together Kirby game made.     But my personal favorite will always be Amazing Mirror.  I was surprised how well the Kirby formula fit into a more exploration type game, almost similar to Metroid.  I love it."
Kirby,39frkh,KingBubblie,2,Thu Jun 11 14:27:33 2015 UTC,"Yes! Amazing Mirror was absolutely fantastic, I actually forgot about it until you brought it up!"
Kirby,39frkh,SkyCoffee,11,Thu Jun 11 21:14:01 2015 UTC,"Return to Dreamland is really hard to beat, but i'd say Crystal Shards is very close. If it had as many extra options like Return has, i might even say it's better, but it was limited by the times. i first played it on the anniversary collection, but i wish i had played it on n64 when i was a kid."
Kirby,39frkh,pinstripedbarbarian,9,Thu Jun 11 13:04:32 2015 UTC,"Superstar (ultra) is the best. There is simply so much content in those games, as well as character. Each of the modes has their own feel, and all together it is a wonderful package.  Spring breeze- the classic Kirby experience, not hard but fun. Dynablade- a cool boss battle at the end. Gourmet Race- fun mini game with an awesome soundtrack. Great Cave offense- the caves are a great locale, and you can be Indiana Kirby  Meta Knight's Revenge- Introduction into the Halberd and Meta Knight's best villain role  Milky Way Wishes- the definitive Kirby experience, I think.  Not to mention the Arena and all of the Ultra modes, like revenge of the King and Meta Knightmare Ultra. A true classic."
Kirby,39frkh,Boogaloo17,6,Thu Jun 11 14:51:47 2015 UTC,Air Ride. 100%.
Kirby,39frkh,abudzl,6,Thu Jun 11 15:48:28 2015 UTC,Kirby's Adventure! One of the best games ever made for the NES.  Is Return to Dreamland really that good? I have it but the early levels are so simple and easy that I lost interest...
Kirby,39frkh,mikeharvat,4,Thu Jun 11 17:20:01 2015 UTC,Return to Dreamland by a long way. I've 100% that game about five times (it was also the 1st Kirby game I played)
Kirby,39frkh,Neefew,3,Thu Jun 11 12:55:59 2015 UTC,"Crystal Shards for sure, though I really liked Amazing Mirror, Squeak Squad, and the other GBA games, too."
Kirby,39frkh,SkyCoffee,3,Thu Jun 11 14:25:24 2015 UTC,Either Air Ride or Super Star Ultra. Those games have brought me countless hours of amazing gameplay.
Kirby,39frkh,ArcanianArcher,2,Thu Jun 11 17:21:44 2015 UTC,"My top three are Amazing Mirror, Triple Deluxe, and Return to Dreamland."
Kirby,39frkh,Kingfin128,2,Thu Jun 11 17:27:48 2015 UTC,Super Star (Ultra) and Amazing Mirror are definitely my favorites.
Kirby,39frkh,xwatchmanx,2,Thu Jun 11 17:44:01 2015 UTC,Amazing Mirror is top notch; I love the aspect of an open world Kirby Game and Co-op
Kirby,39frkh,Tr1pkt12,2,Thu Jun 11 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"Can't decide between Amazing Mirror and Triple Deluxe. Amazing Mirror was just so awesome for all of the things that make it Amazing Mirror. Playing through it as a child was a unique experience. All sorts of fun memorizing the map and discussing the paths to bosses with my brother. But on the other hand, Triple Deluxe just has so much charm, and it's beautiful.  And Air Ride of course."

Kirby,39frkh,SonicGamer74,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:28:02 2015 UTC,I'd go with Return to Dreamland. Just has a ton of fine touches that makes it beat Super Star Ultra in my opinion.

Kirby,39frkh,wyndyteeee,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:56:03 2015 UTC,Amazing Mirror is a very good game. It's probably one the best put together games. I had so much fun playing tag with my friends.  However Squeak Squad is a special one for me. I think it's one of my personal favorites and is actually one of the more underrated Kirby games. It had a lot of cool elements that I think worked really well with the series that I would love to see return.

Kirby,39a9mn,alan2500,4,Wed Jun 10 11:16:35 2015 UTC,"You should start with one of the following:   Kirby Super Star (or its remake, KSS Ultra): Widely regarded as the best game in the series, this game has a bunch of shorter Kirby games in one. Kirby: Triple Deluxe: The most recent Kirby game. Takes the best elements from the rest of the series and gives them a nice, modern polish.  Kirby's Adventure (Or its remake, Nightmare in Dream Land): The NES game that set the formula for most Kirby games going forward.    One of our mods, /u/TestZero, made this nifty overview of the series. It only goes up to the SNES, though."
Kirby,39a9mn,Cardboard_Boxer,2,Wed Jun 10 16:36:43 2015 UTC,Do the Kirby games not have a storyline connected in the different games? Would it not be confusing for me to start with some of the later games in the franchise?
Kirby,39a9mn,Cardboard_Boxer,2,Wed Jun 10 17:55:18 2015 UTC,"There's continuity between the Kirby games but it's not at all confusing or important to the experience. The games were designed to be easy to pick up.  For example, there's a perpetually crescent moon in the background of pretty much every Kirby game. If you beat ""Kirby's Adventure"" you'll know why immediately. It's a bonus for fans, but it's inconsequential otherwise.  The series are more lore based than story based. The story within the individual games are stand-alone experiences."

Kirby,38yyzj,IvynaJSpyder,3,Mon Jun 8 19:11:50 2015 UTC,What is the difference between this and Kirby Right Back at Ya?
Kirby,38yyzj,Cardboard_Boxer,2,Mon Jun 8 20:27:50 2015 UTC,"A ""sub"" refers to providing subtitles in a different language than the original show.  A fansub of the Kirby anime would have English subtitles that faithfully translate the original show, often keeping in things that don't really have a place in the English language like the many Japanese honorific suffixes.  Kirby: Right Back At Ya is a dub.  Dubs usually a bit more work translating so that little cultural things that make very little sense to English speakers are taken out, and they're frequently replaced by similar things in American culture.  For example, Dedede is supposed to be something of a simpleton, so he has a verbal tic (a common way to display quirkiness in Japanese dialogue) in the original version and a southern accent in the dubbed version.  Dubs are generally a better way to experience a show than subs, though if the viewer is very familiar with Japanese culture they may prefer the sub."
Kirby,38yyzj,Cardboard_Boxer,2,Mon Jun 8 20:47:38 2015 UTC,"Also, there's a difference between a fansub and an official sub. Fansubs generally have more accurate translations in the wording and keep all the culture intact. Official subs aren't as accurate and simply localize the culture (not having honorifics in the subs like fansubs do).  But the biggest difference comes in terms of legality; fansubs are considered to be an illegal product and are illegally spread (mostly across the internet). Official subs are distributed legally and generally come packaged in a dvd of the anime they are released in (e.g. One Piece). Usually, fansubs are the way to go because they are more commonly seen than official subs."

Kirby,38nqjy,SubstantialBliss,7,Fri Jun 5 12:07:03 2015 UTC,I imagine that the eyes thing in Triple Deluxe is due to how we usually see him from a sidescroller perspective in that.  Mimicking the spritework and all that.

Kirby,38nqjy,Cardboard_Boxer,4,Fri Jun 5 19:33:04 2015 UTC,"I've definitely noticed that too, his design seems to change a little bit in every single game. Personally I think his ""grouchy"" look suits his grouchy personality better, and making his beak look more like a beak is an okay change too (As a little kid I SWORE King Dedede was a frog because of his old KDL1 sprite and the Gameboy's black and white color scheme). The eyes in Triple Deluxe ARE too far apart though.  As long as he stays recognizably like the king, it's fine IMO. The only model of him that ever looked ""off"" to me was Kirby 64's, where they gave him a narrow duck-like bill for some reason."

I suspect there are also more than a few users who’d appreciate being able to freely run around a sprawling map, fighting with copy abilities.   ...   Of course, we’re also continuing to evolve the Kirby series as a whole, and I hope that one of our next challenges will be to produce a Kirby game in full 3D that still maintains the same depth of play our fans have come to expect.   Seems like just the right time to finally give the players a true 3D Kirby, specially to take advantage of the Wii U's power"

Kirby,38h5rq,Oldneovet,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:35:06 2015 UTC,"Personally, yes, I agree with this. Only problem is, Mario seems to be taking the spotlight for 3d games. We, as Kirby gamers must give positive support and feedback to Nintendo if they do agree on a 3d game for Kirby."
Kirby,38h5rq,dalp3000,2,Thu Jun 4 20:30:05 2015 UTC,"While Nintendo owns and greatly influences Hal and Kirby, they're still separate enough. Hal's almost always in charge and deciding what games get made, and yknow, actually makes the games. There's really no competition with Mario or limitation on how many 3D platformers they can make, Hal just hasn't released one for various reasons independent of other series and developers.  The real problems are more nuanced and game related, just how do you transfer Kirby's into a 3D space? We now know Hal tried once and canceled it due to it not feeling right, 3D transitions are not to be taken lightly."

Kirby,385lk3,CrackedP0t,2,Tue Jun 2 01:49:39 2015 UTC,"Whispy Woods (from Kirby wikia):       Whispy Woods (also known as just Whispy) is a recurring boss in the Kirby series. The forest king first appeared in Kirby's Dream Land and is a giant apple tree with a face and a branch-like nose. His attacks are to make apples fall on Kirby, blow air puffs, inhale him (Kirby's Return to Dream Land), and occasionally shoot his roots at Kirby in some games. The only ways to counterattack without a Copy Ability is to inhale apples and shoot them back at him or use the Slide attack. Whispy is commonly regarded as being one of the easiest bosses in the series alongside King Golem and others. This is because he (in most cases) cannot move and has a shallow range of attacks. As a result, Whispy is usually the first boss to be fought in most of games he appears in, and is the most recurring boss to be fought in the series, even more than King Dedede. This also has made him one of the most iconic and recognizable characters in the series. Whispy evidently isn't the only tree of his kind, a fact explored in in several games following his debut, most heavily in Kirby Mass Attack where similarly-named sentient trees such as Totem Woods, Giga Woods, and Floaty Woods appear. In other games, similar trees like Whispy Woods Jr., Twiggy Woods, and Twin Woods make appearances, and in the anime Whispy is shown to be old friends with another talking tree named Acore.

On the specifics, TD was released first in January 2014 in japan, meaning it finished development at the end of 2013, assuming they did the e-shop mini games on the side or a short time, a holiday 2015 or early 2016 release would give the TD about 2 years of development time. It may be enough if they've got a good workflow, which they had when they did RtDL in 1 year and a half but that had a lot of previous work behind it, not sure if the just cancelled 3D game could help enough on a new one.  As for why they would announce so near to release, its no surprise really, after the whole Kirby GCN fiasco HAL only announces games in near complete states and releasing less than half a year after, applies on RtDL, TD and RC."

I like Kirby having a more laidback, puzzle-based kind of focus. There's a really vast variety of powerup combinations with the animal buddies, too!   I really like the music as well. It has a calm, ethereal kind of tone to it that I haven't really heard in many other games."
Kirby,374xq6,jmoney777,2,Mon May 25 17:26:14 2015 UTC,"I just beat this game last week (97%, got all Heart Stars and beat Dark Matter, that's good enough for me) and yeah the Kirby games are quite magical. The music in this game is annoyingly catchy. Before I played this game I was wondering, ""why didn't they just call it Kirby's Adventure 2"" (because Kirby's Adventure was a NES game while Kirby's Dream Land 1 and 2 were Game Boy games, so naturally you'd think the SNES game would be called Kirby's Adventure 2 instead of Kirby's Dream Land 3) but the game in spirit, really is a follow-up to Kirby's Dream Land 2, in the sense that they took Kirby's Dream Land 2's gameplay concepts and expanded on it.  Also it's quite interesting to look at the progression of the early Kirby series as a whole. There was first Kirby's Dream Land for the Game Boy, and then shortly after there was Kirby's Adventure for the NES which clearly used a lot of art assets from the Game Boy game. And then there was Kirby's Dream Land 2 for the Game Boy which incorporated aspects of Kirby's Adventure, and then the SNES follow-up Kirby's Dream Land 3, which was basically KDL2 on steroids in the sense that it added more animals, more star pieces extra life requirement, and the token collectable item for every level (as opposed to every world in KDL2), and the control scheme is influenced by Kirby Super Star Ultra. It's a unique series of its era because of how closely related the handheld and console titles are (specifically in regards to the fact that Kirby's Dream Land 2, a Game Boy title that is marketed as a sequel to KDL1, had heavy influence from the NES title Kirby's Adventure), as opposed to say, the classic Mario titles in which the handheld titles felt like an entirely different series altogether, and the DKC games just had counterpart/imitation DKL titles. But with Kirby, each of the early games actually feels like an integral part of the series, and builds off another even if the previous title was on a different system."
Kirby,374xq6,UberNarwhalGuy,2,Wed May 27 07:29:54 2015 UTC,It's got the best art style out of the whole series. The hand drawn look compliments all the cute and creepy stuff perfectly.  And the final boss being pretty graphic was a fun touch...

Kirby,36xt0f,BuddyHolliday,1 point,Sat May 23 01:21:17 2015 UTC,"This is really cool for them to throw out challenges like this to the players!  I remember in Kirby's Dream Land 2 (possibly others too?), I noticed that hovering isn't so simple as it is in other games. To hover, you have to press UP while in the air, rather than simple pressing the jump button again.  To me, this felt like the developers were trying to give players the option of using hover or not. If you felt up to the challenge, you could comfortably play through the game without hovering at all; it merely existed as a handicap to help the players who needed it. More modern Kirby games seem to incorporate the float as a more essential ability, so I guess this mentality has been forgotten.  A lot of thought goes into these games to make them more difficult for people who want a challenge, yet very forgiving for new players as well. It's one of the things which make Kirby a really well designed series."

They're all just separate games with no real story line attached.  The only thing is 0 and 02 pretty much leads to Kirby and the Crystal Shards occuring after Dreamland 3.  Sure, the Dark _____ bosses can be all related/coming from 0 or something, but there is no implication of chronology, nor does it change anything.

Kirby,36wk8f,NotLockedLP,2,Thu May 28 04:56:49 2015 UTC,"It is very likely as the Japanese name for Dark Nebula was ダークゼロ meaning ""Dark Zero.""  That is why in the timeline I listed the entity to be a reincarnation of 0."

Kirby,36wk8f,Cardboard_Boxer,3,Tue Jun 2 21:00:27 2015 UTC,"Squeak Squad probably takes place sometime after Super Star, as the Halberd is in the ocean in Squeak Squad, as Kirby sunk the ship in Super Star. I guess Epic Yarn takes place after both of them since the ship is fully operational in that game."
Kirby,36wk8f,Cardboard_Boxer,3,Sat May 23 14:30:36 2015 UTC,"well, kirby triple deluxe could happen soon after SSU (specifically milky way wishes i think) due to the fact that he is shown sleeping in his house, and in milky way wishes he was shown ending it in his house, going to sleep. i think that could be right after, but maybe a coincidence"
Kirby,36wk8f,Shadowkirby1234,1 point,Fri May 22 21:35:19 2015 UTC,It's also possible that Triple Deluxe takes place before Kirby's Adventure as the moon can be seen fully intact during the game but clearly has a chunk permanently blown off during the battle with Nightmare.
Kirby,36wk8f,Cardboard_Boxer,3,Fri May 22 22:07:35 2015 UTC,"The game's creators spoke about both of these points on Miiverse.  Concerning the timeline placement:   ""The opening cutscene starts in a way that could be picking up from the ending of Kirby's Fun Pak (Kirby Super Star), in that we see Kirby at home snoozing away in bed... But when he awakes, everything's changed! And so a new adventure begins.""   Concerning the moon:   ""There are several moons which can be observed on Kirby's home planet of Popstar. For example, there's a sun and moon duo known to cycle so aggressively you wouldn't know if it was day or night, and a moon that in a previous story got smashed into the shape of a crescent. In the opening cutscene of this game, when a shooting star trails across the sky, the moon that can be seen above Kirby's house is that crescent moon.   In this game, it is a different moon that can be seen during the final battle, but the fact both a moon and finally a sun appear in this symbolic battle scene illustrates how important stars and celestial bodies are to the game's imagery.   Once you start looking, I bet you'll see stars and planets everywhere!"""

You are able to play as him in Kirby Air Ride and Kirby 64 too. :)  EDIT: Found a full list of his playable appearances;   In Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, in addition to being a playable ally in some levels of the game, King Dedede is a playable character in the sub-games. In Kirby Super Star, Dedede is playable in the two player version of Quick Draw. In Kirby: Canvas Curse, he is a Medal Swap unlockable after obtaining Waddle Dee. He is the heaviest of all available balls and sinks in water easily. He also has seven HP, the most of any other ball. When tapped, he swings his Hammer around him, which can still press down switches and stakes. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, he is a playable character. In Kirby's Return to Dream Land, Dedede is playable by Players 2, 3, or 4. He is also playable in The Arena and The True Arena after both are beaten with Kirby. In Kirby: Triple Deluxe, Dedede is a playable character in the Dededetour sub-game, which is unlocked after beating the main game. He is also the main character in the Dedede's Drum Dash sub-game, as well as the downloadable Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe. In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, he is a playable character.   source: http://kirby.wikia.com/wiki/King_Dedede"

Kirby,36g7nd,The_Nim,7,Tue May 19 04:04:38 2015 UTC,"i feel like the standard consensus is that the top three is normally some combination of super star ultra, kirbys return to dream land, and kirby triple deluxe, and those all are great kirby games so it makes sense. it really is a matter of, do you want the game to circle around one big story, or a few smaller stories, and would you want to play with friends."
Kirby,36g7nd,Shadowkirby1234,3,Tue May 19 13:03:30 2015 UTC,"For me personally, Air Ride and Amazing Mirror were my two favorites.   Amazing Mirror had some really solid platforming and puzzle solving that involved different copy abilities. It was a FAIRLY open world, and a map to plot out where you were going. 100%ing that game was sooo rewarding to me. It was a matter of knowing which doors lead to which areas, small star doors you can't go back through while large star doors you could, getting the right ability and trying to hold it until you got to the right area, plus it just looked really nice. Even though the computer players were dumb it was still nice calling them to aid you in battle. Plus the mini games were fun! I absolutely loved Kirby surfing. :)  Air Ride is pretty much everyone's favorite but it doesn't fall into the typical platformer style that the main Kirby series follows. Sure there's plenty of spin-offs in different genres but yeah. Idk. Air Ride was a solid racing game with an interesting mechanic: You're constantly moving, and you only use one button, and that's to drift/boost (also there was gliding which was pretty cool). Knowing when to drift and when to boost was vital to victory. And the simplistic controls of ""I only have to steer and slow myself down"" was just a lot of fun to learn to master. On top of that, each stage had shortcuts, copy abilities to help you topple your foes, and many different obstacles/branching paths. Not to mention there was a good variety to the ""cars"". Some were better for offense, some for defense. Some were slow but had excellent steering, some were super fast with terrible steering. And then of course City Trial, where you could go around in an open world, explore, power up your vehicle, get new vehicles, there were special events that happened in the city, you can beat up other players, special items, hidden areas, boss monsters, and a final game mode to use your beefed up star to fly the furthest distance, go the fastest, complete a lap, or destroy enemies.  Yeah, I really liked Air Ride. :P"
Kirby,36g7nd,terminavelocity,3,Tue May 19 04:59:39 2015 UTC,"My three favorites would be Super Star, Return to Dreamland, and 64.

It's what introduced me to Kirby, and I got hooked from there. It's just basic and simple, in a good way. Seriously, the ending boss battle is one of my favorites from any game.

If you can find it, Canvas curse is a brilliant spin-off, if a little short.  I don't personally, but people seem to like Amazing Mirror. That's on the 3DS eshop I think, but I got it from ambassador.   Stay away from adventure 3 if you can, that to me is kinda bad.  Crystal Shards is slow and difficult, but the gimick of it is amazing, that you combine copy powers. Don't play that first, but play it at some stage.  But really, Super Star is the Mega Man 2/ Super Mario 3/ TF2/ LoZ Lttp of the series. Plus I believe that it's on the eshop. If not, adventure 3/ Kirby Wii are there."

Kirby,364ghf,HatofulThread,13,Sat May 16 01:21:44 2015 UTC,"I personally think it would be the only possible way for it to be like 3D Land/World. The problem with a 3D Kirby would be that Kirby can float around and fly around as long as he desires. In a 2D World, this works great, but in a full 3D World like in Mario 64 as example, this would cause problems and could only prevented via invisible walls or cave worlds, which wouldn't be the most elegant solution. Another way would be to limit Kirbys flight time, but this would take away from the free control of Kirbys flight, like the way it was done in Kirby 64. Games like 3D Land do a great job with their fixed camera perspective and level design. It wouldn't feel wrong to fly away and to ""Fall out of screen"" or to find yourself blocked by a barrier, because you can see beforehand that you are too far off and that you shouldn't be there, instead of having a wall appear out of nowhere. After experimenting with a 3D Land/World like 3D Kirby game, it would make a transition into a fuller 3D experience easier with the new found experience."

Kirby,364ghf,mrtitkins,3,Sat May 16 18:36:54 2015 UTC,The obvious solution to this problem would be to limit Kirby's flight time to 5 midair jumps like in Smash Bros and Kirby Air Ride.
Kirby,364ghf,lucaspucassix,6,Sat May 16 20:04:50 2015 UTC,I personally think this takes away from the free feeling of flight of kirby games. I personally really disliked it in Kirby 64
Kirby,364ghf,Alili1996,2,Sat May 16 21:39:42 2015 UTC,"Personally I like how Kirby Fighters Deluxe handled it better. With that game, Kirby didn't exactly have a set number of jumps but it would get harder and harder to elevate after a certain amount of time."
Kirby,364ghf,Cardboard_Boxer,2,Sun May 17 03:07:37 2015 UTC,"I think the issue with flight time might also be solved with stage design? Basically the focus is not on precision jumping, but on avoiding obstacles while progressing in the stage. Even in a 3D environment, it doesn't always have to be completely open stages, as 3D Land also showed.   I do feel like they might need an even more obvious marker for what location Kirby is at when he's flying though, like a shiny circle on the ground instead of just a small dot shadow.   Anyways it's an interesting idea that I'd love to see them try!"
Kirby,364ghf,mythriz,5,Sat May 16 21:43:54 2015 UTC,"That would be great. Maybe make it more open, like 64 or Sunshine? Also, a game on that scale should hopefully have room for LOTS of copy abilities. I'd also like to see rideable warp stars (Air Ride!)"
Kirby,364ghf,Blaeeeek,1 point,Sat May 16 08:19:16 2015 UTC,"It'd be an interesting realm for them to explore Kirby in, but his game design doesn't really extend to the more open platforming world like that.  Kirby isn't so much a platformer (compared to others) since you're not really interested or struggling to navigate the map, it's more fighting enemies and finding secrets/little puzzles.  It could work in a true 3D sphere, but it'd need a lot of work to get there and be interesting."
Kirby,364ghf,KingBubblie,1 point,Sat May 16 16:33:59 2015 UTC,Upward Attacks would be a problem. How does one face upward in a 3D platformer in a way that's comfortable and easy to attack out of?

If Nintendo update the anime channel to have subtitles and JP dub then I'd happily pay some money for it on my Wii U ($1-2 AUD for the full series) if it's predownloaded and comes with higher definition output, subtitles and an editor so you can cut out pieces and copy them to an SD card etc.  Actually it'd be a great way to increase knowledge of them. $1 for an entire high definition anime with a cut and copy tool to boast without any issues, all downloaded to work offline and with subtitles and I'd take that over the torrented copy I have any day.

Kirby: Right Back at Ya is specifically the 4kids dub.  Personally, of all the 4kids dubs, K:RBaY is pretty faithful. King Dedede's southern accent is most like a product of the Japanese Dedede having some very blatant speech quirks that would not have translated, and I think it works with his comedic character. Additionally, the show seems already kind of aimed at the age group 4kids tends to dumb things like One Piece down to, so aside from the removal of Meta Knight swearing and a few names there's not really much changed, as far as I've been able to tell having watched both."
Kirby,35zcd7,JoeReviewer,2,Fri May 15 16:30:32 2015 UTC,"I just can't stand the dub. As someone with a Spanish family, Meta Knight's acccent just sounds...all kinds of wrong. Like a 1940's Looney Tunes caricature of a Castilian Spanish accent. And for some reason, King Dedede sounds like a poor man's Foghorn Leghorn. And what did they do to Blade?!

And, tbh, even though it's a 4Kids dub, it's one of their few good ones, if you can get past every character's accent.  4Kids barely cut anything out of it, as far as I know."

It could also have a puzzles based on certain abilities (e.g. Mini Kirby could shink into small places and go through a small maze), and advanced combat for more advanced abilities (Fighter and Ninja could have amazing combat areas).  It might be hard balancing the different abilities (for example, Beam might be able to get to an area that Cutter is meant to unlock), but it would be worth it. I'd be happy with only 5-7 abilities."
Kirby,35rklj,The_JS,1 point,Wed May 13 15:58:33 2015 UTC,"Come on, guys.  Fully 3D, while a great idea, probably wouldn't fit in the light of something much more important: 4-person play with the ability to be in different areas from other people a la Amazing Mirror, which combined with Squeak Squad's style of exploration to upgrade copy abilities and do other such things (and a hub to store all the copy abilities you've gotten to use later), plus MAYBE Return to Dreamland's ability to choose Dedede, Meta Knight or Bandanna Dee instead of another Kirby (but leaving the multi-kirby option in place anyway).   That way, you could have Kirby running through and getting stuff done, Dedede slacking around and clearing whatever's behind Kirby, Meta Knight taking on the tough stuff of certain areas and Waddle Dee exploring things for the others to see!  TL;DR I'm pretty sure Nintendo could work out four player split screen, c'mon."

Kirby,34wv86,ExiledLuddite,2,Tue May 5 06:41:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wasn't really digging the gameplay in the videos I saw. It seems pretty slow. The graphics are nice, though. I think I might stick with Squeak Squad. So good."
Kirby,34wv86,Oni_Kami,2,Tue May 5 06:51:20 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately... this is true.  It's the hardest of all the Kirby games, by far, which is really cool, and it's nice to have such a huge challenge... But it gets old, fast, as you're really doing the same things over and over. It's very light on gameplay.  And yes, it's entirely touch-screen based."

Kirby,34ujex,Espurreyes,19,Mon May 4 17:58:24 2015 UTC,"20th Anniversary is pretty much 7 Kirby games in one (and since one of those games is 8 games in one, you're getting a lot of games) So I feel like, if he hasn't played any of those games, that one would give him a lot to do.  Kirby's Return to Dreamland has a lot of challenges and puzzles that are similar to Adventure/Nightmare in Dreamland. Plus, it's just some solid Kirby platforming action that any Kirby fan would feel right at home with.  Either one is a good pick, but I think 20th anniversary collection would be a better deal. Plus it comes with a cool artbook! Can't so no to that!"
Kirby,34ujex,Mr_YadoR,17,Mon May 4 18:14:55 2015 UTC,"The fact that he is autistic has no relevance to what Kirby game he should play unless you can give details about certain symptoms or the type of autism since there are so many kinds on such a wide spectrum. There are too many rumors spread because people use the term ""autism"" so loosely, resulting in a ridiculous number of stereotypes and misconceptions about autistic people.   Nevertheless I would recommend Kirby superstar if possible as it is an amazing solo OR co-op experience anyone can enjoy."
Kirby,34ujex,AngryPooMonkey,5,Mon May 4 19:41:51 2015 UTC,"Despite Epic Yarn being easy I really enjoyed it. The levels are absolutely gorgeous And I love the soundtrack.  If you're going to choose between the two you stated, I'd say Return To Dreamland."
Kirby,34ujex,LucentNargacuga,5,Mon May 4 20:03:29 2015 UTC,"Kirby's Epic Yarn, without a doubt. You can't die in the game, so it eliminates a lot of frustration.

Ever since Super Star Ultra he's been on the directing role for the main platformer Kirby titles, he has expressed a love for boss battles and his games are characterized by ""soul"" forms of final bosses, as well as the script and story details he himself writes. He also voices King Dedede in Return to Dream Land and Triple Deluxe, making a nice coincidence since Dedede had previously been only voiced by Kirby's past prominent director, Masahiro Sakurai.  Considering he probably designed Drawcia, that drawing is technically official, or at least not fan art."

Today it occurred me it had his name in kanji, which I could google to find info on japanese as english searches don't yield much. It led me to the japanese kirby wiki which had a link to his site, as well as the art school he graduated from and the art school he does speaking or something of the like in (his name appears on the list at the bottom).  Google translate was of great help at all stages of this.  Spoiler"

Kirby,34l517,LitrosNub,2,Sat May 2 18:59:26 2015 UTC,That's also pretty rare. I'd hold onto it a little longer and keep it from any dust and any thing that might screw it up. It might be good in the long run. Demo's are always more rare than retail special edtions. I'd keep it until atleast when none are being talked about. Since Pokemon Diamond and Pearl had a Demo version and those went over 200+.  Hope you can make some good cash from this. Demo's are hard to come by. Since stores are picky who can have their demo's when the game is released. Sometimes even destroy them.
Kirby,34l517,LitrosNub,1 point,Sat May 2 19:38:13 2015 UTC,"From what I read, the stores are supposed to destroy them when they're done. I'm glad it's rare but I'm a little bummed I don't have the real game."

My favorite games are probably still Dreamland 2 & 3, because of the helper+ability combos, and the fact that you have to figure out which combos to use to get some of the trickier secrets (plus survive long enough without losing the ability)!  I do like how the newer games have multiple moves per ability. Still kinda miss the helpers though."

For some weird child logic (we were quite little at the time), we decided it was an important game to have. So when we did, god damn was that an experience. It was a whole world for us to explore. We would memorize routes and try to learn the map just in our heads and god damn was it an experience like nothing else. I still don't even remember it as well as I did then. Sure, now, I'm smart enough to look at the map, but I had an understanding of ""the route to this boss is this way, then this way"" and such that was so much fun in a way I can't express enough.

Kirby,33kn1o,Cartyx,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:06:14 2015 UTC,"Kirby's Adventure, the video game that got me into gaming, and the one that gives me the most nostalgia.  Got an old NES from my great-grandmother, and Kirby's Adventure along with a few other games. I loved that game. I don't even remember playing the other games very much, because that was practically the only game I played (even outshined SMB1 and Duck Hunt). Our NES was very glitchy, so the save files usually got deleted, as such, I got a lot of ""replay value"" out of it. That's probably why I remember it so well, because I didn't finish the game very often (probably only beat it 1-3 times, or even 0 if I was just watching my brother play, and I remember incorrectly), so I played it a lot. We called King Dedede ""Copycat"" because he did the same stuff as Kirby (floating, sucking in air). That led us to get Kirby Air Ride (several years later, of course), and that's still my favorite GameCube game (outshined Mario Kart and Super Mario Sunshine (we didn't have Melee, but I still like Kirby Air Ride more)). I've been a Kirby fan ever since."
Kirby,33kn1o,Onion851,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:33:32 2015 UTC,"I played a bit of Kirby Dreamland when I was really really young and sucked at it, I couldn't even beat Poppy Bros Sr. on Green Greens.

Kirby,33kn1o,Mr_YadoR,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:39:04 2015 UTC,"Not technically a Kirby game, but my first exposure to Kirby (and most Nintendo characters besides Mario) was Smash Bros. Melee.  I always loved playing as Kirby the most, because I thought it was so fun and cool how he could inhale the other players and take on their appearance and use their move.  I also dabbled a bit in Air Ride at a family friend's house, which I really enjoyed.  Quite a long time after that, I discovered Super Star Ultra.  A friend had it, and I really fell in love with the game, so I had to buy it.  The multiplayer was a ton of fun, and I've spent so much time with that game.(Perhaps a tiny bit too much?  Nah, worth it) But yeah, really what got me totally hooked on Kirby, and since then I've been getting as much Kirby in my life as possible."
Kirby,33kn1o,polhudo,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:05:53 2015 UTC,"I first saw Kirby in Smash and I never thought much of him.  One day, when I was about 6 or 7, my dad took me to Funco Land - not Gamestop; Funco Land - and was like ""Let's get you a new video game!"" So I went there and there was a super helpful store clerk who was asking whatI liked and he recommended Kirby Superstar.  I played that for a little bit, but then he decided to swtich out Kirby for Mega Man X. But I immediately wanted to play Kirby again and I went home with, essentially, my Elementary School career."

Kirby,33d2c9,FancyTea,2,Tue Apr 21 15:23:47 2015 UTC,Nice work.
Kirby,33d2c9,Cardboard_Boxer,2,Thu Apr 23 06:21:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks! As soon as I learned you could design your cars, I just had to do this."
Kirby,334tiz,PlasmaAxePlays,13,Sun Apr 19 15:39:20 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say, if you want to play a Kirby game with a friend I'd say this is the best. The fun is just playing through and experiencing it even though it isn't hard. Though it isn't traditional it is a stunning game and I would love a sequel."
Kirby,334tiz,Polonight,5,Sun Apr 19 15:46:38 2015 UTC,I can definitely agree with playing it with a friend.  I played it with my brother and it was a blast.  By myself I was never motivated enough to play it though.
Kirby,334tiz,Moaku,5,Sun Apr 19 16:39:47 2015 UTC,"It's like Nintendo Land, fantastic with friends, quite dull when alone."
Kirby,334tiz,Polonight,10,Sun Apr 19 16:44:33 2015 UTC,"I thought it was fun, and cute enough to be kirby-ish, but I didn't really see anything about the game that screamed 'Kirby' to me.  I know it was originally intended to be a new IP featuring Prince Fluff, but they decided to retool it into a Kirby game. I actually find that rather unfortunate, since Nintendo is desperately in need of a new cartoony IP. The last one of those was Pikmin, and before that Animal Crossing.  Prince Fluff for Sm4sh DLC!"
Kirby,334tiz,TestZero,3,Sun Apr 19 18:12:31 2015 UTC,"Well, they are getting Splatoon"
Kirby,334tiz,JowlesMcGee,3,Sun Apr 19 20:56:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the Wii was still relevant when Epic Yarn came out."
Kirby,334tiz,TestZero,2,Sun Apr 19 23:13:07 2015 UTC,"Nintendo has had a good handful of new cartoony IPs. Denpa Men, the Miis, and Pushmo all immediately come to mind. It's just that only a few of them have really taken off.  Still, more would be nice."
Kirby,334tiz,Cardboard_Boxer,8,Mon Apr 20 10:45:03 2015 UTC,"The game was super adorable, but it was a bit slow paced and easy for my taste.  Granted the game was incredibly relaxing without the fear of death, I could not pull myself to find the collectibles when I didn't feel motivated to."
Kirby,334tiz,Kayachlata,6,Sun Apr 19 15:43:27 2015 UTC,I agree with this this guy.
Kirby,334tiz,PsychoSunshine,7,Sun Apr 19 18:51:38 2015 UTC,"I personally really liked it. It's not the most challenging game in the world but it's perfect for a nice, relaxing game. I like to play it after I'm burnt out from especially frustrating games. Great multiplayer too."
Kirby,334tiz,Palaven,5,Sun Apr 19 20:17:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's not only one of my favourite Kirby games, but one of my all-time favourite games.  Everything about it is just so fun and cute and I love it so much"
Kirby,334tiz,FriendlyDictator,6,Mon Apr 20 01:44:00 2015 UTC,"At the time of its announcement I was confused and disappointed. I was a counsel gamer, not a handheld gamer, so I had not played a new, main-series Kirby game since the Nintendo 64.   I had also been waiting for this for years. It seemed like a cruel joke.  Eventually I gave in and tried Epic Yarn out. I disliked Yin Yarn quite a bit. He seemed somewhat...less threatening compared to the likes of Marx, Nightmare, and Zero.  I expected to hate the ""no deaths"" thing, but it actually increased my enjoyment of the game. I love collectables and 100% completion, so focusing on exploration rather than on battles made me warm up to the experience.  I actually ended up enjoying Epic Yarn quite a bit in the end. Still, a lot of the game's features (invincible main character, yarn/tongue whip, ground pound, etc.) made it feel more like a Yoshi game than a Kirby game to me."
Kirby,334tiz,Cardboard_Boxer,6,Mon Apr 20 02:34:44 2015 UTC,Such a great game to play with a gf. So adorable in every way
Kirby,334tiz,Hurricane12112,2,Mon Apr 20 05:01:26 2015 UTC,Very cute looking but super easy and I just would rather play either crystal shards for a better kirby game or yoshi's story for a cuter game
Kirby,334tiz,spasm01,2,Sun Apr 19 17:16:10 2015 UTC,general thought...amazing
Kirby,334tiz,cellenium125,2,Mon Apr 20 03:07:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely one of my favorite Kirby games. It was just full of charm and unique gameplay. Sure it was a bit easy, but that's what makes it perfect to play after a long day of school/work and you just want to unwind."
Kirby,334tiz,NotLockedLP,2,Mon Apr 20 03:14:00 2015 UTC,"It's a cute game, and I think it's worth a playthough. That said, it's literally impossible to lose and all of the challenge comes from getting enough beads to get all of the gold and platinum medals and finding all of the collectible furniture and CDs. Also it's one of the few games I think is too cute and sweet looking. It's not really a mark against it, it's just that it's as fluffy and adorable as they could've made it and then some. It might actually be too much for some people but it is adorable."
Kirby,334tiz,tom641,3,Mon Apr 20 04:35:37 2015 UTC,"I hated it. Absolutely hated it. You could not die. Even if you fell down a pit, you'd drop some gem thingies and get carried out of it. If there's an enemy with a big drill, you can go rub your face against it without anything happening. Boring dribble. Not every game has to have some big challenge or anything, but this was just a chore. Terrible game due to shit gameplay, and the yarn thing was pretty dumb because it took away Kirby's gimmick (sucking things up). It's like if you made a Mario game, where Mario's made out of rice pudding, so he can't run, or jump, or get hurt, or die, or punch, or shoot fireballs, or do anything.  I give it a 2/10, because despite being terrible, the graphics and sounds weren't bad."
Kirby,334tiz,Oni_Kami,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:11:52 2015 UTC,"It's adorable, beautiful and a lot of fun. Play it with a friend or loved one and you'll have a great time.   If you're expecting a Kirby game, though, that's not exactly what you're getting. Kirby cannot fly, inhale enemies and steal their powers."
Kirby,334tiz,ArjenDesign,1 point,Mon Apr 20 12:01:34 2015 UTC,"You'd have to be soulless puppy-kicker to not find Epic Yarn fun and adorable. It is, however, incredibly easy."

Kirby,334tiz,ColdHumor,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:27:02 2015 UTC,My girlfriend and I played this game when I visited her at her college. So much fun!
Kirby,334tiz,Magnemania,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:02:39 2015 UTC,"Probably one of the better Kirby spinoffs (it's closer to Wario Land or Yoshi's Island than Kirby, but both of those things are closer to Kirby than most of the spinoffs) and it's got a lovely aesthetic to it.  I find the complaints about the inability to die quite confusing, considering that the goal of the game is clearly to hold onto enough to beads to get the best rank on the stage.  It's not particularly slow-paced either, unlike Canvas Curse and Mass Attack."
Kirby,334tiz,Oldneovet,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:05:14 2015 UTC,"Wasn't a fan, and I'm a big fan of all of Kirby's console outings. I've tried multiple times to get into it but keep setting it down. It just doesn't have the Kirby 'charm' to me, even if the graphics are incredible. Just feels like a watered down Yoshi's Island IMO."
Kirby,334tiz,ZeroGear9513,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:53:06 2015 UTC,It was good but should never have been a kirby game.
Kirby,333vql,PlasmaAxePlays,3,Sun Apr 19 07:18:44 2015 UTC,Really cute. Some music would fit it well.
Kirby,333vql,Kayachlata,2,Sun Apr 19 07:39:54 2015 UTC,yep. only reason I didn't have music was because I made this when my internet was out. ;-;. Thanks though :D!

Kirby,32zvd1,wyndyteeee,2,Sat Apr 18 21:16:37 2015 UTC,Oh boy...that ending...
Kirby,32zvd1,Cardboard_Boxer,6,Sat Apr 18 06:26:16 2015 UTC,That's what I love about entire Dark Matter/Zero saga. It left so much up to interpretation and allowed fans to speculate on who Zero was and what his motives were.  They essentially form his story in works like these.
Kirby,32zvd1,Mr_YadoR,7,Sat Apr 18 06:38:54 2015 UTC,"I feel like Hal Labs (and Nintendo, sort of) leaves a lot of things like this ambiguous so that the players and fans can fill in the holes themselves. It's really cool watching a lot of fan theories and ideas blossom!"
Kirby,32zvd1,Oldneovet,2,Sat Apr 18 08:56:21 2015 UTC,"Really cool find!  Dark Matter/Zero was my favorite villain too. Not only was it ambiguous compared to the usual ""Muahaha, I am going to do X evil thing!"" that many video game villians do, but its Miyazaki fever-dream design felt that much creepier and more wrong in Kirby's happy world."
Kirby,32tzg6,Cardboard_Boxer,3,Thu Apr 16 18:20:39 2015 UTC,Honestly it's probably just unused data
Kirby,32tzg6,conceptgamer,3,Fri Apr 17 14:30:32 2015 UTC,"we could think that, but then why would it only appear in this update"
Kirby,32tzg6,Shadowkirby1234,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:07:48 2015 UTC,"Good point, hmm, well if it were to be DLC why would it be on disc?"
Kirby,32tzg6,conceptgamer,2,Fri Apr 17 15:39:11 2015 UTC,"well, the dlc would need to be added into the game itself, otherwise people without the DLC would end up with crashed games when people chose the DLC stages. the real question is why is there only music right now, instead of not putting anything until its all done"
Kirby,32tzg6,Shadowkirby1234,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:42:19 2015 UTC,"True, but in that case they could just release a compatibility pack for free, so the game won't crash, similar to what games like saints row do, though that really doesn't seem like something Nintendo would do..."
Kirby,32tzg6,conceptgamer,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:56:24 2015 UTC,"technically they do have compatibility packs, they just come mandatory along with the regular updates, like with mewtwo... i just want to know why they would only add part of the DLC (only the music was found) instead of waiting for all of it to be done then adding it"
Kirby,32tzg6,Shadowkirby1234,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:11:59 2015 UTC,Yeah that I can only speculate about

What could be the cause of all this? Twisting their minds  Twisting their souls Now everyone is corrupted Their behavior now destructive I must search for those crystal shards Even if the task maybe hard I'll make sure that you will all see As I set our planets free With the crystals powers that  were once completely scattered It will be the very key to  destroying each and every dark matter Destiny calls for you To fly forward Star Warrior Find the inner strength within you And bring peace from all the torture Let the stars guide you through  So Stop this never ending war Or there might be a chance our Universe will be  No More... Please Go... Restore... Our World... Angels of Darkness take flight And I'm the only one left to fight Our worlds are falling As they're engulfed in the shadows Their cries are fading from darkness Drowning in it  Consumed by it There is no more time to be scared The pain ends now, I am prepared I'll go forward with all my might To make sure you're out of our sight I'll make sure our hopes aren't shattered And pierce the evils you've gathered Even if I'm devoured in  this darkness that you've become Just as long as there's an inch  of light in me I will overcome Do not fail now The time is now To destroy the evil  This is the only chance you have Everything is up to you now Use the power Inside you And bring peace once and for all Or our future will be no more Go now and fight star warrior! So stop this war Protect our world!"

Kirby,32f14k,Zachabo53,2,Mon Apr 13 14:33:54 2015 UTC,"So far, I've only completed Squeak Squad. I'm at 96% in super star ultra though (I have like one chest left in the great maze, not sure if that counts towards 100%, some helpers that are not yet hero's, and the true arena.)"
Kirby,32f14k,MLBr0,2,Mon Apr 13 10:20:42 2015 UTC,"I have not played many Kirby games, but the ones I have I mostly 100% cuz I liked em alot-Kirby Squeak Squad, Kirby superstar Ultra and kirby 64."

Kirby,32f14k,Cardboard_Boxer,2,Mon Apr 13 12:16:48 2015 UTC,Definitely got 100%   Dream Land 2 Dream Land 3 Kirby 64 Squeak Squad Amazing Mirror Return to Dream Land   Probably got 100%   Dream Land Adventure Super Star Super Star Ultra
Kirby,32f14k,pikachufan2222,2,Mon Apr 13 15:24:37 2015 UTC,Dreamland 3 is without a doubt the hardest to complete. Some of the heart stars are like pulling teeth.

Triple Deluxe would probably be hardest but I'd have to beat True Arena and get all the keychains first!"
Kirby,32f14k,alexislightus,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:53:44 2015 UTC,lets see 100%? kirby's adventure i completed atleast 1 File 100% and the boss rush    Kirby's Super star delux i completed to 100% which took for freaking ever with some of the helper to hero runs.    and i believe i completed Kirby's return to dreamland on the wii 100% aswell im working on epic yarn right now       and my personal most challangeing was Kirby Super star delux the helper to hero ones were ALOT harder than they shoulda been for some of the powers. when i complete epic yarn itll probably be that because of the sheer ammount of time it needs to 100% it

The Dream Collection challenge stages were by far the most challenging (appropriate, right?).  I've never been able to 100% Mass Attack, because the achievement things are just so difficult to complete."

Majin Buu video (Spoilers, as that link starts towards the end of the video). I believe the voice they used comes from this character.  Kirby sometimes calls out his attacks in Smash Bros and the Japanese version of the anime but not in the main series of games.   Even so, Kirby's street-fighter referencing moves go by different names in his series. So Japanese Anime Kirby would call out ""Rising Break"" rather than ""Shoruken.""  Also, for reference:    Street Fighter Kirby    Shoruken Rising Break   Haduken Energy Blast   Flash Kick Areal Spin Kick   Thousand Hand Slap Vulcan Jab (recent versions)"

Any other villains in the series are one-time foes with little staying power, or don't stand out enough. The assist trophies are enough."
Kirby,31e641,TestZero,4,Sat Apr 4 16:04:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call dedede a villain though. both he and kirby protect dreamland. dedede just takes a more preventative approach, as opposed to kirby's destructive one."
Kirby,31e641,ZeroGear9513,2,Sat Apr 4 16:38:56 2015 UTC,"I agree, but he is almost always made to look like the primary antagonist. See Kirby's Adventure( or Nightmare in Dreamland), Superstar (Spring Breeze) , and Squeak Squad. Otherwise he's just a pwn being used by the villain. See Kirby's Epic Yarn, Canvas Curse, or Kirby 64. His methods are a bit questionable though."
Kirby,31e641,Mr_YadoR,3,Sun Apr 5 20:35:48 2015 UTC,"looking like an antagonist and bein a villain are two very different things. If he's not possesed, he's ultimately trying to protect dreamland, even if it means opposing kirby (who's erratic behavior has released at least 2 unspeakable horrors which had already been contained)."
Kirby,31e641,Mr_YadoR,11,Mon Apr 6 06:55:36 2015 UTC,"My vote is going for Bandana Waddle Dee, of course.  Magolor would be an interesting spellcaster for the roster. His Final Smash could be the Master Crown."
Kirby,31e641,Sol56,2,Sun Apr 5 07:01:58 2015 UTC,"Does bandana-dee actually do enough for a full moveset? I feel he would make for an awesome assist trophy, but as a character, is kind of lack lustre."
Kirby,31e641,Player13245,3,Sun Apr 5 07:10:29 2015 UTC,"Well, he has not only the spear, but he could also show some nods to the Parasol ability, as he can represent both sides of the Waddle Dee.  A lot of characters don't really have too much going for them, in terms of design. Marth is a pretty simple character; a lord with a sword (no disrespect). If they can make characters like him work with a full moveset, Waddle Dee could surely have a lot of creative ideas."
Kirby,31e641,NewOpinion,1 point,Sun Apr 5 07:19:54 2015 UTC,Bandana Dee has better moveset potential than most characters from Fire Emblem and look how many of those have been in Smash

Kirby,31e641,UberNarwhalGuy,3,Tue Apr 7 22:55:04 2015 UTC,It'd be cool to see Zero Squared as something like a master hand fight. They already made an awesome remix of his theme.

I'm not a fan of perpetually animated banners, but I like banners that react to the mouse, like /r/MortalKombat (granted, that has a perpetual rain animation, which I personally could do without, but you get my point).  I don't think an FAQ about Kirby in the sidebar is really necessary, because if you come to /r/Kirby, chances are you know who/what Kirby is, but an FAQ for the sub in general would be good, e.g. clearly stated rules, so that when someone breaks one we get to go ""IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE SIDEBAR!""

Kirby,31c0ca,V0ID115,7,Fri Apr 3 17:53:40 2015 UTC,Triple Deluxe for the following reasons: - unbelievably cute - relatively long (several worlds) - wonderful story - BEAUTIFUL soundtrack - keychains! omgineedthemall - challenging Arena and subgames
Kirby,31c0ca,wyndyteeee,6,Sat Apr 4 02:19:24 2015 UTC,Superstar or adventure.
Kirby,31c0ca,gregzillaf,3,Fri Apr 3 18:02:38 2015 UTC,Kirby's Adventure! Blows my mind they made that work on NES. Triple Deluxe and Return to Dreamland are amazing too... wait they all are good.
Kirby,31c0ca,aaroncosmith,3,Sat Apr 4 03:34:16 2015 UTC,Super start ultra or triple deluxe
Kirby,31c0ca,conceptgamer,2,Sat Apr 4 00:59:28 2015 UTC,I've only played the Gba games.. so far id say Nightmare in Dreamland has been most enjoyable
Kirby,31c0ca,Kizzlez,2,Fri Apr 3 20:18:59 2015 UTC,I agree with this. Its gotta be my favorite brcause how fast paced it is and how short the levels are. Great for speedrunning and just popping it in quickly to play on or two levels.
Kirby,31c0ca,quarck11,2,Thu Apr 9 05:09:50 2015 UTC,Return to Dreamland because  Amazing multiplayer  Memorable soundtrack  Great story for a Kirby game  Super abilities are fun as heck  Great bosses  OUTSTANDING finale  Has one of the best True Arenas ever in my opinion  Best overall gameplay in my opinion  Beautiful to look at  Ninja Dojo is great with friends  A little personal love since it was my first TRUE Kirby game (The only one I had until that point was Air Ride)
Kirby,31c0ca,pikachufan2222,2,Sat Apr 4 16:16:54 2015 UTC,Super Star Ultra and Air Ride
Kirby,31c0ca,Zachabo53,2,Sun Apr 5 23:59:50 2015 UTC,"Kirby Triple Deluxe and Kirby Air Ride are my favorites yet.  Here's why:  Kirby Triple Deluxe   Good story (for a Kirby game) Longest final boss fight yet (5 stages, I think?) Amazing music (Moonstruck Blossom!) Nice 3D effects Good atmosphere (in the environment that Kirby goes through)   Kirby Air Ride   Also has amazing music Fun gameplay Wide variety of Air Ride Machines Dragoon! Only real 3D gameplay in Kirby (in City Trial)   There are several other games I'd like to mention either way...   Kirby's Return to Dreamland Kirby's Epic Yarn Kirby Super Star Ultra Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland Kirby and the Canvas/Rainbow Curse"
Kirby,31c0ca,Player13245,1 point,Tue Apr 7 05:35:02 2015 UTC,Super Star Ultra because it was just great in so many ways. Also Marx.

Kirby,31c0ca,Kayachlata,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:04:14 2015 UTC,I've only played Dream Land and Adventure but Adventure is EASILY my favorite so far. To think that the NES could pull off the shit in that game is quite amazing. I still have the rest of the Dream Collection to go though.
Kirby,31c0ca,learnalilgivinnlovin,1 point,Sat Apr 18 02:15:40 2015 UTC,Return to Dreamland and Dreamland 3. Both amazing creations
Kirby,31chn4,Pavlovee,3,Fri Apr 3 20:01:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd really like to see one more Kirby rep. Why would Kirby and a franchise with three games (Kid Icarus) have the same amount of fighters?   -Marx has much unique moveset potential and is a cool design in all.  -Magalor would be awesome as well, but his evil form would be WAY too big and his friendlier form would be strange because he never fights in that form.  -Dynablade, although an awesome boss, would probably get Ridley'd.  -If only we could manage Ice Climbers, then we could also have Lolo and Lala, which would be so amazing.  -That chef boss from multiple different Kirby games and the Anime (I forgot his name forgive me) would be cool and such, but maybe too obscure?  Overall, I believe Marx and Magalor would be the best fits, but maybe also the chef. This is, as long as everyone is okay with fighting the more cuddly Magalor, and then maybe switching to his insanity form for his final smash only."
Kirby,31chn4,Pepperoni_Pizza,2,Sat Apr 4 03:55:19 2015 UTC,"Chef Kawasaki would be a bit too obscure for Smash. Marx would be really cool to see, though. I could also see Dark Matter Swordsman working well."
Kirby,31chn4,UberNarwhalGuy,1 point,Sat Apr 4 06:14:18 2015 UTC,"Well, would he really be too obscure? He's been in multiple games and almost every episode in the anime, and not to hate on Lucas (I love him too), but he was never in a American release before Brawl. But to be fair, Kawasaki never has had a role bigger than miniboss or filler element for the show while Lucas was at least playable. On another note, I hope that crazy chef is a playable character in the next real Kirby game (maybe a hidden one like Rosalina?)."
Kirby,31chn4,Pepperoni_Pizza,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:47:04 2015 UTC,"People who aren't avid fans of the Kirby series wouldn't recognize him, and he isn't particularly iconic. If Kirby were to ever get another character, they'd have to be decently important. Kawasaki would just seem out of place among the Smash roster."
Kirby,31chn4,UberNarwhalGuy,3,Sun Apr 5 04:15:32 2015 UTC,"I personally believe that if a Kirby villain is to be included, it should be Marx"
Kirby,31chn4,bananarealm,1 point,Fri Apr 3 20:02:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can totally see Marx as well. I like Magolor more, but would love either of them on SSB4"
Kirby,31chn4,Shadowkirby1234,3,Fri Apr 3 20:08:12 2015 UTC,"personally i want bandanna dee to be the fourth kirby rep, simply because then we would get the full gang together. but if they were to add another character after that,  then it would need to be magolor.  his attacks could be based off of his boss fights, only smaller, his up special could be a warp, his down special could be the vines he shoots out, making them appear in the ground below him, shooting of diagonally to the sides, his side special could be that one laser attack, where he could shoot it infront of him, and maybe if you input the other direction during the attack, a portal will appear to warp it behind him. standard special could be a charge dark magic shot, or perhaps a non charged one that can be aimed slightly, similar to pits arrows.  his smash attacks could incorperate the super abilities he uses, with up or side smash using the sword, and down special using the hammer, with ice spikes shooting out the other side of him. his final smash could be magolor soul, where he could either just unleash a powerful attack, or be powered up for a time, OR his final smash could be the lor starcutter, since that would be an interesting final smash and not have any spoilers.  he could also have customs to change them into other attacks he used, with maybe his down special changing to a counter, where he gets his star sheild, and then if he is hit while its there, the enemy freezes then gets hit by a magic blast.  TL;DR i want bandanna dee first to complete the gang, but magolor is a close second with a good moveset possibility."
Kirby,31chn4,ZeroGear9513,2,Tue Apr 7 15:46:12 2015 UTC,"Marx is clearly his own thing while Magolor was sort of a medley of various Kirby bosses and would be a better rep for all the different bosses. Not to mention Magolor can actually do shit without a powerup from his macguffin. Plus he doesn't look like one of Kirby's copy abilities. I figured all the attacks he uses while wearing the master crown he could do before just on a much smaller scale. I was also disappointed by the lack of a stage representing KRtD, instead we got another fucking Superstar stage. I wanna see Egg Engines or Nutty Noon get a stage! No grasslands, No wispy, and no fucking caves, you get enough of that from Metroid. They're not very interesting to look at anyway."

Kirby,30tvrs,conceptgamer,4,Mon Mar 30 17:54:16 2015 UTC,I love Mass Attack! It's in my 3DS right now. I can understand why it's not the most popular among the series; it's quite the departure from the traditional Kirby game. Some may also find the stylus-driven gameplay more frustrating than enjoyable at times. Mass Attack does have the best sub-games though!

A lot of people dislike it just because it's more of a management game than an action game, which is how traditional Kirby games play.  To me it was pretty charming and pleasant, though 100%'ing it would be ridiculous. The minigames were the best part of it because of all the cameos."

It's kind of made worse by the fact that some of the other minigames in it are WAY better, so it's a shame that Mass Attack was the one they stretched out.  If it had just been a minigame collection where all the games were on an even footing, so to speak, it would be so, so much better."
