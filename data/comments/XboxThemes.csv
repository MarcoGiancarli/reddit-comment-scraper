You also want to keep in mind the overlay placement of the Xbox icons such as controller battery/category headers, profile icon, etc. For example, your center text and the logo will always be covered up.

All these great games came out in the first 2 years of the Xbox 360 and we are approaching 2 years with the Xbox One and what do we have to show for it?  Don't get me wrong I like playing MCC every now and again, I like playing the new NBA2K games, Watch Dogs was kinda cool but none of these things are new ideas."
XboxThemes,39zb6j,JumpingPotato1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:58:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah the first year of 360 was so great, with ports of original Xbox Titles like, Gun, NFS: Carbon, and more... /s  Love how everyone puts on ""Nostalgia Goggles"" and loves to compare a console from last gen, at the end of its life cycle, after a BUNCH of games and updates came out for it; to a new console, that's only a fraction as old.  Xbox 360 wasn't just chain releasing Block Busters, had it's fair share of bad releases... Also, it really shouldn't have been a surprise, since at E3 2013 Phil Spencer said it would be about a year or two until we start to see games that take full advantage of the new console.  A lot of what held games back, was developers choosing to develop the game on last gen and current gen (which was the case for BOTH of your examples...)  Anyway, circling back to what Phil Spencer said about it being a year or two until we start to see truly great games... this year at E3 here's what was shown, Syndicate, Halo 5, Fable Legends, Tomb Raider, Gears Ultimate, Forza 6, Battlefront, and Fallout 4 are all launching this Holiday, with numerous titles coming in 2016 (including The Division on March 8th and Ghost Recon: Wildlands in 2016), and more games such as Scalebound, Quantum Break, and the new Crackdown being shown at gamescom.  I guess what I'm getting at is, every single Xbox 360 idea wasn't a ""new idea"" either, and also, the launch year of E3, that they said they were going to keep supporting the 360 for another year or two, which would mean releasing games on both platforms, can't really make games with amazing new features, when they need to be released on both platforms. A great example of this is Shadows of Mordor, that game released on both generations, however, last generations version, had the ""Nemesis AI"" completely removed from the game, which is literally the only reason I bought that game. That AI system was really cool and advanced, and made the story pretty unique, some random grunt orc kills you in a crowd, he gets promoted and becomes a character, people remember you running away, or them running away from you, etc. That system in it's entirety, didn't exist on 360. So, clearly once they stop supporting 360 in it's entirety, game quality will drastically increase."

While working on these, it struck me that they look like construction paper, so I added some textures to them that make them more interesting. I also darkened them up significantly, so they aren't so distracting.  Here are the other versions I've made - most should align with the existing Xbox theme colors:   Green glitter Blue glitter Purple glitter Pink glitter Red glitter Orange glitter Yellow glitter Gray glitter Dark blue patterned Dark green patterned Dark yellow/tan patterned Dark brown   If there are any other colors/patterns you'd like to see, please let me know and I'll craft one up for you.

XboxThemes,336kxk,Justice_Nugget,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:09:10 2015 UTC,"Rorschach test:       The Rorschach test (/ˈrɔrʃɑːk/ or /ˈrɔərʃɑːk/,  German pronunciation: [ˈʀoːɐ̯ʃax]; also known as the Rorschach inkblot test, the Rorschach technique, or simply the inkblot test) is a psychological test in which subjects' perceptions of inkblots are recorded and then analyzed using psychological interpretation, complex algorithms, or both. Some psychologists use this test to examine a person's personality characteristics and emotional functioning. It has been employed to detect underlying thought disorder, especially in cases where patients are reluctant to describe their thinking processes openly.  The test is named after its creator, Swiss psychologist Hermann Rorschach.    Image i     Interesting: Rorschach Test (band) | Beautiful Midnight   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

XboxThemes,31juec,IHateCats84,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:55:02 2015 UTC,"It's not necessary... as long as the text looks uniform enough to look like it belongs together. Like don't mix serif and sans serif font.   Sometimes having contrasting styles can work for your design because having the text all matching might make it blend together. That's why you'll often see titles and subtitles be different sizes, stylings, etc while still keeping continuity with one another.   I can see if I can find a few design power points you can go through to get some basic design tips."

This is a background I created using Blender and Photoshop as a recreation of the ""flower field"" level in Toejam & Earl 2, which would frequently occur right before the end of each stage.  I'm not sure if there are many people out there who will like/appreciate this, but it's something that reminds me of fun times, and so after creating this image, I thought it'd be nice for an Xbox theme to share with everyone here. I haven't done much to my original image, aside from adding a small shadow for the Xbox logo, but I think it's enough.

Second of all, this looks great! In all honesty I was actually speaking about you modifying the original one you created because I appreciate the minimalism of it. But with it being a black background it almost needs the extra red peelings.   Thank you so much! Yet another FredFredrickson theme is now set on my Xbox One.  P.S.- I saw in the other comments you talking about adding the neon lighting or at least something to that effect. You should TOTALLY explore that. I don't think it would clash with it at all. Also some other color experimentation perhaps?   Just some ideas. :)  Thanks again!!!"

But it's normally quite simple to fit it in so just ask if you want it in! I'll be saving the .psd for each theme, so if you want that I could upload it somewhere. Again just ask.  I try to keep the layers separate, so most things can be changed pretty easily. Just ask if there's any changes/additions/deletions you want!

XboxThemes,2vujvq,Deer-In-A-Headlock,3,Sat Feb 14 05:34:06 2015 UTC,"I thought this would be a good idea, as you can just add this in front of a normal computer wallpaper to make it look a little more.. themey on your Xbox One.   The .psd is here, and if you know at least know a little bit of Photoshop you should be able to customize a bunch of stuff on it.   If you don't have photoshop, you should still be able to add the transparent image in front of a wallpaper in some photo editing program, and then save it and use it on your Xbox. It didn't seem to work on paint, but i managed to get it working on Microsoft Word, so im sure an actual photo editing program will easily do it.   If you don't have photoshop and want me to create it with a certain colour or with some changed or put it in front of an image for you, then just ask :)"
XboxThemes,2vujvq,rustypennyy,1 point,Sat Feb 14 05:40:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you take requests, but would you mind matching the transparent title's (the extra thing you added) and make the it the color Violet? I'd prefer it to match the exact color as the color you can choose to have on your Xbox. I'm not photoshop smart, sorry haha. I noticed you have a Blue, Black, and White version, I was just curious if you wouldn't mind changing the color."

XboxThemes,2v7eep,Seahawk59,11,Sun Feb 8 17:10:35 2015 UTC,"Tox770 says ""pain in the ass"", I hear ""challenge"".  How about this? http://i.imgur.com/uwSttF5.png  By the way, I cleaned up some stuff from the original - the masking on that black bar was horrible, and there were bits of it left all over Mac and Charlie. It was also not aligned very well with the menu items, so I added a bit to the top of it.  I do agree with Tox though, it's always easier for the person who originally made the image to make these sorts of changes. I'd recommend getting in touch with them (if you can), if you don't like my edits."

This reminded me that this is their first year in the B1G, I don't see them doing much better than 4th in the East anytime soon, they're a great filler team for these stupid conference rules they've been adding that you need such and such teams to qualify for this or that or have a championship game. I don't understand or want to know an explanation as to why Nebraska, Rutgers or Maryland are in the Big Ten other than money.   The NCAA is just weird. I mean Syracuse and UConn don't even play in the Big East Tournament anymore. Because of Football. I'm complaining about basketball now.  As for Michigan, thank fuck Hoke is gone. The program has been the shits for years now and we've been routinely getting beat by conference teams that we should beat.  Initially my OP was more of a I love how you're teasing the fans of the bigger teams in the conference, myself included with the lesser of the teams wallpapers first, I failed English today and didn't elaborate enough I suppose and hell I didn't even notice that they were being posted in alphabetical order either.
