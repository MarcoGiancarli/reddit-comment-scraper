I think this video I found does better justice to the craziness of the climb. If you fall you are either dead or gravely injured.  I visited Mooney falls over a year ago, before they had those nice wooden ladders at the bottom (I recall rusty metal ladders with rungs the thickness of rebar), and I remember my legs trembling from a combination of the exertion and the adrenalin.    What's hard to tell in the video is there is only one way up and down, so not only are you stumbling to get to the bottom but you are also having to make way for others who are returning back up to get to the camp sites.   It definitely makes for some great photography."

crazystairs,3a28k0,vtjohnhurt,9,Tue Jun 16 20:20:30 2015 UTC,"I would participate if I still lived in Pittsburgh.  It's a shame that so many of the steps have crumbled.  They are a valuable resource and they encourage people to walk to the bus stop.   ...Pittsburgh has 739 sets of city steps — 344 of which are legally considered streets — comprised of 45,454 individual steps.    Back to OP's observation.  One reason why the steps are considered legal streets (and used by OPs GPS) is because there are/were many houses that were only accessible by city steps.    On the Southside, the flat land at the base of the hillside was crowded with factories.  The slopes were healthier places to live largely due to water and sewerage runoff.  Typhoid and cholera outbreaks on the flats spared the people who climbed the steps home every day.    I lived on the lowest tier of the slopes about 100 feet in altitude above Carson Street.  An 80+ neighbor granny (Dorthy) walked down the steps every day to attend mass.  One day my dog escaped my yard and followed Dorthy to her dentist's appointment on Carson Street, waited outside, and then followed Dorthy back home."

A cablecar was constructed by the French company Poma from nearby Zhangjiajie railway station to the top of the mountain. Tianmen Mountain Cableway is claimed in tourist publications as the ""longest passenger cableway of high mountains in the world"", with 98 cars and a total length of 7,455 metres (24,459 ft) and ascent of 1,279 metres (4,196 ft) The highest gradient is an unusual 37 degrees. Tourists can walk on kilometres of paths built onto the cliff face at the top of the mountain, including sections with glass floors. An 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) road with 99 bends also reaches the top of the mountain and takes visitors to Tianmen cave, a natural hole in the mountain of a height of 131.5 metres (431 ft).   A large temple is also located on the summit with chairlift or footpath access. The original temple here was built in the Tang Dynasty. Today a more recent construction with Tang dynasty architecture occupies the site and includes a vegetarian restaurant in the 10000 sq mi of setting.

It’s where the Tar Heel State and the Palmetto State meet. It’s where families and friends bond over thrilling rides and entertainment. Carowinds will now unite its storied history with its future as the standard for thrills by unleashing Fury 325, the world’s tallest and fastest giga coaster.   Fury 325 will simulate the wild, daring and spontaneous flight of the hornet. The new ride will be visible from uptown Charlotte, renewing the park’s skyline and serving as a symbol of changes to come. Fury 325 is part of a planned $50 million dollar multiyear investment to bring new life to founder Pat Hall’s original vision for Carowinds. The park will be revamped from top to bottom to celebrate Carolina culture including new rides and attractions, signature Carolina food offerings and entertainment. Opening in Spring 2015, Fury 325 will be the centerpiece of a new 8.2 acre main entrance plaza that includes a state-of-the-art ticketing and season pass processing area and expanded guest service facilities.   “Starting with Fury 325, we plan to make Carowinds a destination for thrillseekers to celebrate the Carolinas,” says Mike Fehnel, Carowinds vice president and general manager. “The new ride will build on the heritage of the park, creating new memories and traditions for our loyal fans and future guests from around the world.”  Riders will board into three 32-passenger open air trains and begin their ascent to the top of a 325-foot (over 30 stories) hill. This immense hill is followed by an exhilarating 81 degree first drop. Like an angry hornet chasing its target, Fury 325 will race through a series of hills, curves and quick transitions while reaching speeds of up to 95 miles per hour. Riders will speed along 6,602 feet of track during the nearly three and one half minute ride.   “The tradition of the park is so important to those who have grown up here,” says Fehnel. “It’s long overdue that we gave our fans a new energy surrounding Carowinds, which will build on our legacy as the premiere entertainment destination for generations of Carolinians.”  Those who can’t wait until Spring 2015 to experience Fury 325 can take a virtual ride at carowinds.com/fury325 where they can also check out photos, virtual renderings, ride stats and more. This Fall, fans can purchase a 2015 season pass or renew current season passes for the lowest price of the year at carowinds.com. Fury 325 is designed and manufactured by Bolliger and Mabillard (B&M) of Monthey, Switzerland, a recognized industry leader in roller coaster development and the same firm that brought Vortex to Carowinds in 1992, Afterburn in 1999, and The Intimidator™ in 2010.  Carowinds is owned and operated by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, a publicly traded partnership that is listed for trading on The New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""FUN."" In addition to Carowinds, Cedar Fair owns and operates ten other amusement parks including Cedar Point in Sandusky, OH, three water parks, one indoor water park, and five hotels. Cedar Fair also operates the Gilroy Gardens Family Theme Park in California under a management contract.  And a view in the other direction: http://i.imgur.com/2HGGPa4.jpg"

crazystairs,2svinv,lazespud2,1 point,Sun Jan 18 23:06:03 2015 UTC,"A) Christian Richter is an amazing photographer and B) If I ever seen another god damned HDR photo I'm gonna kill myself.  I had to do some stuff with real estate web sites for a while recently and literally every single frickin photo series of homes for sale is chock full of the worst HDR you've ever seen. These are just lame empty modern homes; but the photos all look like bad acid trips.  like 20 years from now they will be able to easily date photos from 2011-2014 because so many were god damned terrible HDR.  And it's the terrible stuff that unfortunately makes me hate all of it; even the good, incredibly subtle and restrained stuff by Richter.  BONUS: My fave richter photo:  http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/074/2/4/mg_3483_88_89_90_91_tonemapped_bearbeitet_by_christian_richter-d5y351r.jpg"
crazystairs,2svinv,--o,2,Mon Jan 19 06:07:02 2015 UTC,"That doesn't sound like HDR, it sounds like slapping an ""overdriven HDR"" filter on low dynamic range images.  ...or someone took a lot of time/fancy camera to take all of those."
crazystairs,2svinv,lazespud2,3,Mon Jan 19 13:34:38 2015 UTC,"A little from column A and little from column B.  Some are clearly HDR, where the photographer clearly fancies themselves as a modern day ansel adams; taking several shots to get the dynamic range and building it later (rendering normal looking houses basically like haunted houses).  Others are absolutely just low grade HDR-mimicking filters.  Honestly they are all, generally, terrible, and even if they are good they have no place on a Century 21 Real Estate sales site."
crazystairs,2svinv,--o,2,Mon Jan 19 17:46:58 2015 UTC,I could see a few legitimate uses... But of course those would involve decent tone mapping that would not stand out in any way.
crazystairs,2svinv,lazespud2,3,Mon Jan 19 18:00:21 2015 UTC,I don't necessarily disagree; it's just that the people doing it on real estate sites generally have zero talent for subtlety. I can post the images of the site I worked on (kinda want to continue to have the job of working with them). But here's examples that are not to far removed from what I'm talking about:  https://places2explore.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/falconhead-hdr-05.jpg?w=640  http://theboken.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Castle-Point-in-Hoboken-Nice-Home-Series-_2-HDR.jpg  http://www.point2.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/hdr-curbed.png  http://www.point2.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/hdr-lovely-listing.jpg

crazystairs,2q4us6,frululu,10,Tue Dec 23 12:09:12 2014 UTC,"Excuse my english.  I assume they have too little space to make one set of stairs from one floor to another. If they do that the stairs would be at a high angle, let's say more than 45 degrees.  So they make the stairs go up on the small wall but only at 50% of the height between two floors, and big stairs on the big wall.  I don't know if i explained right. But that's the idea."
crazystairs,2q4us6,jacobo,6,Tue Dec 23 04:38:01 2014 UTC,Interesting. Why not have a shorter stair with a longer flat landing?  Are the stair sizes pre-made and did not fit the building?

Because this way of doing the plexes, some neighborhoods or specific street decided to keep their staircases inside, to attract more fortunate tenants and less ""poor"" people, since these outside stairs where merge in public opinions to poor neighborhoods."

Only 2.5% of listed buildings are Grade I.   A building is listed to protect its heritage, therefore there are certain restrictions put in place to stop any authorised work to the building. ‘Listed Building Consent’ is needed for any work to be carried out that would affect the building’s special character and/or appearance in any way. Performing works without consent is a criminal offence.  I'm not expert on the matter; I've paraphrased the above from various websites.

I thought that it was neat, but I didn't know that England used 3-1-1 like Americans and Canadians do. So I looked up the wiki article, which has the following:  ""Currently, the UK government is implementing a plan that when complete will allow all local police departments in England and Wales to be contacted via the single number 101. The number, which costs 15 pence per call from both landlines and mobile phones, is intended for reporting of minor or non-emergency crime.""  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-1-1  Okay, so that's not it.

The number format follows the N11 code for a group of short, special-purpose local numbers.  The number 3-1-1 is intended in part to divert routine inquiries and non-urgent community concerns from the 9-1-1 number which is reserved for emergency service only. A promotional website for 3-1-1 in Akron described the distinction as follows: ""Burning building? Call 9-1-1. Burning Question? Call 3-1-1.""   Many cities also accept 3-1-1 comments through Internet or smartphone interfaces. On March 3, 2010, the Federal Chief Information Officer of the United States, Vivek Kundra, announced the creation of a uniform Open 311 application programming interface for these services.  The online 311 service SeeClickFix is available across the United States but does not connect to municipalities with their permission or knowledge except in a few select cases.

crazystairs,2e3unz,strolls,6,Thu Aug 21 13:25:57 2014 UTC,"I was interested in a little more information.  Apparently the stairs were originally built to allow radio antenna cables to be strung across the valley, and then also access related to the Naval radio station there.  Regarding the closure:  In 2003, the stairs were repaired, costing the city $875,000. As of early 2012, land usage rights issues have not been resolved. The City and County of Honolulu has stated that there is currently no plan to open the stairs for public use, citing liability concerns … Dozens of people, however, routinely hike up the stairs every day. In August 2012, singer and comedian Fritz Hasenpusch died of a heart attack during his Haiku Stair climb. As recently as early December, 2013, a guard had been posted at the base of the stairs."

The tunnel which is 2,000 feet (610 m) long, took two years to build at a cost of £1300, and first opened to the public in 1837.  This cave was first mentioned as being a chapel in the year A.D. 305 and excavations, in which Romano-British pottery has been found, have revealed that it has been both a holy place and a place of refuge at various times in its history. Although the cave is in limestone, there are few formations in the natural passages.

crazystairs,1sm0ds,contemplor,29,Wed Dec 11 04:39:46 2013 UTC,"Hoo boy. Tip for anyone visiting Barcelona: do not climb the towers in Sagrada Familia unless you are absolutely certain you can handle how narrow and winding they are, that you're in shape enough to make it up all the way, and that you're completely okay with heights and enclosed spaces.  I say this because I learned the hard way that you can't wuss out halfway up for whatever reason. You climb up the stairs in one tower, cross a walkway to the opposite tower, and climb down the stairs in that one. There is absolutely no room on those stairs to climb back down while all the other tourists behind you are still going up.  Since I possess exactly zero of the traits I mentioned above, I was not a happy camper. I think I only made it because I was too stubborn to let anyone see me have a nervous breakdown over a goddamn staircase.  If you can handle it, though, definitely do it. Fantastic view."

crazystairs,1sh9kp,ethan_kahn,16,Mon Dec 9 18:29:03 2013 UTC,"small album here. source wiki. Prabalgad Fort is located between Matheran and Panvel in the Indian state of Maharashtra, at an elevation of 2300 feet in the Western Ghats. It was built on a plateau very close to Matheran, but unlike Matheran it does not have a good source of water. It was known as Muranjan until it was taken over and renamed by the Maratha forces under Shivaji's rule.The fort contains a temple to Ganesh and some stone ruins. Its sister fort is Irshalgad. Around 1458 Malik Ahmad, the prime minister of the kingdom of Ahmednagar, took over the fort during his conquest of Konkan. The Mughals took control of Prabalgad along with Kalyan, Mahuli, Karnala and a number of other forts after Sambhaji's death. The fort was conquered by Shivaji from the Mughals in 1657, after he establishing himself in the Kalyan-Bhivandi area. At the time of the attack the fort was governed by Kesar Singh, a Mughal sardar, and was the only fort to put up a strong resistance. On seeing the signs of defeat the women in the fort performed Jauhar, a tradition of self immolation to ensure an honorable and respectful death. Singh died during the battle in October 1657. Singh's mother hid herself and her grandchild during the attack. Shivaji in an act of kindness made sure the lady and the child were allowed a safe passage out. In the year 1826 Umaji Naik, a freedom fighter, and his associates are believed to have made this as their home for a brief period of time."

Winchester’s Building Methods  According to legend, Mrs. Winchester enacted a nightly séance to help with her building plans and for protection from “bad” spirits. While she sometimes drew up simple sketches of the building ideas, there were never any blueprints….or building inspectors! In the morning, she would meet with John Hansen, her dutiful foreman, and go over new changes and additions.  During the early years of construction, this resulted in some awkward and impractical concepts such as columns being installed upside down – though some suggest this was done deliberately to confuse the evil spirits.  But this is how the Winchester Mystery House™ became known as “the house built by the spirits.” John Hansen stayed with Mrs. Winchester for many years, redoing scores of rooms, remodeling them one week and tearing them apart the next.  It is doubtful whether John Hansen ever questioned his boss. Mrs. Winchester may have been trying to confuse evil spirits, or simply making mistakes, but there were no budget ceilings or deadlines to meet. This resulted in many features being dismantled, built around, or sealed over. Some rooms were remodeled many times. It is estimated that 500 rooms to 600 rooms were built, but because so many were redone, only 160 remain. This naturally resulted in some peculiar effects, such as stairs that lead to the ceiling, doors that go nowhere and that open onto walls, and chimneys that stop just short of the roof!"
crazystairs,1s47lf,SpudgeBoy,4,Wed Dec 4 23:28:53 2013 UTC,"I have been to the Winchester Mystery House three times over my life. I first heard of the house when I was young. I saw a segment on That's Incredible. On one of our family trips when I was 13 we went and toured the house. My brother, his room mate and I took a trip up to SJ when I was 19 . Then when I was in my thirties, I was doing a trade show in SJ, so I talked some co-workers into going.  It is fascinating and beautiful. There are Tiffany stained glass pieces everywhere worth millions. With some butted up against walls, so the sun will never go through them. Trap doors, one way passages, seance rooms. It is really cool.  The cool thing is having gone over many years, I have got to see them fix the place up. The first time I went, it was pretty beat up. The last time I went, it was very much better.  8/10 Would go again (and will)"

Influenced partly by the fact that Gregory was the son of his father's enemy, he ordered Gregory imprisoned for twelve (some sources indicate fourteen) years in a pit on the Ararat Plain under the present day church of Khor Virap located near the historical city Artashat in Armenia. Gregory was eventually called forth from his pit in c. 297 to restore to sanity Tiridates III, who had lost all reason after he was betrayed by Roman emperor Diocletian. Diocletian invaded and vast amounts of territory from western provinces of Greater Armenia became ""protectorates"" of Rome.   From wikipedia. Creepy, to say the least.
