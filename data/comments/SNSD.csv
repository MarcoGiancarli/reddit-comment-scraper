SNSD,3e0e8s,tFaYue,2,Tue Jul 21 07:04:32 2015 UTC,here is the original picture that I used. It's one of my all time fav pics because it uses up the entire frame well and displays each girl evenly.   http://i.imgur.com/NEW68fY.jpg  This is what my poster looks like. As a frame of reference I put it directly on my window .

SNSD,3dxpsc,oblivious247,2,Mon Jul 20 19:48:31 2015 UTC,"She's been receiving nonstop hate since her dating scandal last year.  Things only escalated further with Jessica's departure.  You've got a bunch of people thinking she's a ""sly fox"" that orchestrated Jessica being kicked out.  I don't  have screencaps but it's everywhere.  Girl can't do anything anymore without antis trying to make it something more than what it is.  And they're not stopping at her.  A while ago they chased her brother off instagram."
SNSD,3dxpsc,danceydancetime,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty new to listening to SNSD, what was the dating scandal? Is it just that people were mad about her dating?"
SNSD,3dxpsc,oblivious247,4,Mon Jul 20 22:39:46 2015 UTC,"She was the last in a string of dating announcement for the girls and I think people just lost it.  What they'll tell you is that Taeyeon was using her instagram to send secret messages to her boyfriend instead of doing stuff for her fans.  There was a lot of talk of Taeyeon owing everything to her fans and that what she did was a betrayal of everything they've done for her, all the money they've spent on her,etc....  I don't buy that shit.  I think after several dating announcements fans were looking for anything to start shit over.  That along with her dating a member of a boy band known for having probably the most insane fans, giant recipe for disaster.  You don't date in kpop without shit hitting the fan.  Taeyeon was just unfortunate enough to be the straw that broke the camel's back for a lot of so called ""fans"""
SNSD,3dxpsc,Ifromjipang,2,Mon Jul 20 22:52:44 2015 UTC,"I think Taeyeon always had the most ""possessive"" fans, people liked her because they perceived her as different/special (not saying she isn't), someone who they wanted to protect and have a unique relationship with, in their fantasy anyway. Also she was always the most popular member. EXO are ridiculously popular as well and female fans tend to be the most hateful towards female idols out of jealousy. Then of course she's the leader of the group so more ""responsibility"" falls on her.   I was a little surprised people didn't care more about Yoona, but I guess they'd already been vaguely established as a couple on many broadcasts. And Sooyoung/Hyoyeon just aren't that popular, sadly. Not sure about Tiffany."
SNSD,3dxpsc,oblivious247,2,Tue Jul 21 00:07:37 2015 UTC,"I think, much like Yoona, it was expected with Tiffany.  Rumors about her and Khun had been going around for years so it wasn't a surprise to anybody."

Also, almost anything a celebrity does will be connected by haters or fans to anything else going on so unless it's been confirmed, this ""shade"" is nothing more than illtimed posts with a ton of speculation. As much as it seems like it, we can't know for sure it was her total intention.   Today Shaq and Scottie Pippen got into an argument over who's alltime greats would do better from their respective teams. It started off as some shade by Shaq then escalated into a full blown arguement that confirmed his bashing on Scottie. That is the type of stuff that we can call out without a doubt"

SNSD,3dxw5b,hatsuyume,4,Mon Jul 20 13:52:42 2015 UTC,"Things have just gotten pretty damn serious. Taeyeon has spoken regarding the malicious and hateful comments that have been posted to her Instagram lately (you can check her comment’s translation here: http://tl.gd/n_1sn42eu), and she said she and SM will be taking legal actions because some of those comments threaten not only her own peace of mind, but also the well-being of her friends, fans and even FAMILY. Moreover, Flying Petals will also be suing anyone who posts hateful things to Taeyeon’s pictures. So, if you see any comment of that kind, screenshot it and email it to petals309@gmail.com so she can use those screenshots as proof (remember Taeyeon also encouraged fans to do this in her statement). Taeyeon’s fandom is NOT small and we can all help make a difference and protect Taeyeon, it doesn’t matter where we are from. Let’s not only love her from a distance, but also fight side by side and show her our everlasting support.    Source"

This is the same person who took the nuclear option deleting pics of her in SNSD after the split. Considering how close she is with her sister, I think it makes a lot more sense that it was directed towards the nutters on her sister's account.   Even if Jess did get wind of the situation with Taeyeon, the ""karma"" statement could just as easily be directed towards the anti-fans (jail time and fines being the what comes around part).

SNSD,3duw0j,SNSDave,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:44:16 2015 UTC,man i've out of the loop. Thank you for the info!
SNSD,3duw0j,Tur7leSensei,2,Sun Jul 19 18:51:15 2015 UTC,That episode of running man was amazing. The last game they played was amazing to watch. Just before that seeing Sooyoung dance her heart out to not get the block she needed made me sad :(
SNSD,3duw0j,Enrys,2,Sun Jul 19 23:27:01 2015 UTC,"Eh, I only liked the last game.  Tetris was alright and mud game was kind of a let down.  It was made worse by seo and tae's injury."
SNSD,3duw0j,Tur7leSensei,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:09:38 2015 UTC,Yeah fair enough. Poor Taeyeon got next to no screen time.   I am looking forward to their own show though so I'll be keeping an eye on soshi subs.
