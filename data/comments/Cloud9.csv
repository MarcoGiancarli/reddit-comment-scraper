Cloud9,3e41lg,ruskininja,4,Tue Jul 21 20:06:44 2015 UTC,"Cloud9 at 5th. That's insane, 3 weeks, 3 2nd place finishes is also insane. I'm glad C9 are the NA dream team."
Cloud9,3e2xbu,F1R3BL00D,3,Tue Jul 21 15:30:39 2015 UTC,"Should be able to make out of that group, but Liquid might surprise."
Cloud9,3e2xbu,II_Shwin_II,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:45 2015 UTC,"C9 is like a 95% favorite to get out of the group. I don't think TS or Noble will surprise. Maybe TL in a BO1, it could happen. but if it's C9 vs TL in a BO3, there's no way TL can win. C9 are just on fire at LAN."
Cloud9,3e2xbu,Razgrizacez,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:08:42 2015 UTC,"Im going to give my analysis here about these groups.  The way group A should be going is Cloud9 with #1 seed and Liquid/Tempostorm with #2 seed. The reason I am saying this is because you can't underestimate the fragging abilities of Roca, Autimatic, and Shahzam. Also on top of that Liquid aren't solid at lan at all next to their online play so the #2 seed for this group will be confusing  Group B should be #1 seed would probably be Counter-Logic Gaming and #2 be Luminosity/ Nihilum. CLG are looking like a better lan team than the rest of the teams in their group will ever be. On top of that Luminosity kicked their strongest fragger NAF for an IGL, Devilwalk and their using set executes and their aim isn't going to be amazing. Luminosity also have a 0-13 lan record since the first lan they attended, Cevo season 6 lan. Also Nihilum can surprise and take the #2 seed from Luminosity.  The way to get to the lan works is that there are 2 spots for NA teams and the #1 and #2 seed from each group will battle for that spot in a Best of 3 Format.   So I am predicting the games to be:  Cloud 9 vs. Luminosity/Nihilum -------> Nihilum would be the easiest team for our boys in blue to defeat because their play style is more of a pick and play kind and seeing their recent game against SKDC, their CT side is lacking, which Cloud9 can take full advantage of. Luminosity we can't forget about Devilwalk, he was the coach of fnatic till he left to play CS again and he can come up with some good executes. But his team is lacking on aim which Cloud9 can take full advantage of. But even with this, Cloud 9 are the favored team to beat either of these teams and secure a spot in the major.  Counter-Logic Gaming vs. Liquid/ Tempostorm--------> If CLG have to face Liquid, it will be a cointoss because even though liquid should be better, liquids most recent lan performance makes me wary of how they'll perform, but maybe they'll show some strength at CEVO lan on friday. But CLG vs Tempostorm, I can see Tempostorm beating CLG because they have amazing fraggers such as Shahzam, Roca, and Autimatic who can all be star players and carry their team if they need to. So pretty much the second best of 3 will be a big cointoss, all it matters is who gets out of the group in which seed."

Cloud9,3dvdey,enerccio,3,Sun Jul 19 22:15:59 2015 UTC,You need to stop and rethink what you're typing. CLG had better team fights this game then any other game they've played for a long time. Yeah it sucks that C9 lost in the end but acting like a child here doesn't make it go away.

Cloud9,3dvdey,DrSoap,5,Sun Jul 19 21:02:23 2015 UTC,I think we have to win all of our games and Team 8 lose
Cloud9,3dvdey,spacejam98,6,Sun Jul 19 21:03:29 2015 UTC,pretty sure we have to go atleast 1-1 and T8 goes 0-3 to have a tiebreaker which is highly likly considering T8 schedule

With both our games being on Red side next week, I'd say it's unlikely unless Team8 goes 0-3, and they've been pretty good recently. So this is the game that pretty much puts c9 in relegations...  I know they are playing against 3 tough teams, but still, you can't just assume they will lose all 3 especially since they've been able to win some big games and are also fighting for their lives as well."
Cloud9,3dvdey,Novarix,14,Sun Jul 19 21:14:04 2015 UTC,"Agree with everyone  so far in the thread, the game was amazing, Inc's solo kill on Poebelter when Xmithie ganked.... Holy crap.

Cloud9,3dvdey,thezaitseb,3,Sun Jul 19 21:36:52 2015 UTC,"That game was really good, but it snowballed off an early DIG mistake. Now, admittedly, C9 pressed the advantage home absolutely brutally to close it out fast. That was really well done, showing a degree of decisiveness they were lacking earlier in the split."
Cloud9,3dvdey,TheIconoclasticFury,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:54:16 2015 UTC,"And they played better in it then they did today, they had a 5k lead at one point fairly early."
Cloud9,3dvdey,thezaitseb,0,Mon Jul 20 01:51:09 2015 UTC,"At about 10 minutes C9 was up ~1k gold. This was mostly Sneaky's CS differential over CoreJJ.  Then DIG flubs the engage onto Hai/Lemon/Incarnation (blowing flashes on Lemon and Hai), Kiwi kinda over-extends, and some tight team-fighting from C9 and ""I think I can"" from DIG later, and C9 has 3 kills, mid outer tower, and a 3.3k gold lead. Kiwi over-extends again 5 minutes later, and by that point C9 has the 5k gold lead."
Cloud9,3dvdey,ImperialDeath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:02:45 2015 UTC,"And C9 punished them properly and played out their comp well. Today they had Baron and barely got anything done with it, let Azir clear a massive top wave for free because Balls couldn't split ? I dunno, but to say c9 played better in this game then they did vs Dig is ridiculous. Sure this game was more entertaining, but there are a lot of small mistakes in this game that CLG was able to take advantage of. Jensen caught out and having to flash once, Jensen getting caught out and killed (leading to Balls tping and doing nothing buy being killed).   They played better last week against Dig which is why they closed out their lead. They played better against Team8 the first time they played them as well."
Cloud9,3dvdey,thezaitseb,11,Mon Jul 20 04:26:53 2015 UTC,"CLG fan here from the clg r, but, GOD DAMN, everyone on your team literally played their best game the entire split. This had to be the most intense game of the entire split as well, wish you guys best of luck moving forward,and hope to see some more dank play from Jensen as well in future splits, and, dw, there is still a chnace for a worlds spot, and I know for sure you guys aren't getting relegated."
Cloud9,3dvdey,enerccio,-17,Sun Jul 19 21:09:23 2015 UTC,"Not really. Our best game the entire split last week was vs Dig. Balls was shit this game, this is an insult to consider this game our best split when we lost..."

Cloud9,3dvdey,Yatlol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:28:14 2015 UTC,They would've atleast had a chance if they just left baron at the last team fight. Trapping themselves in against azir is complete suicide. Overall you cannot be pissed at cloud 9 unless you have insane expectations. This is the team that had been losing almost every game to every team besides the worst before this.

A feeling of relief and even some laughter as the child calms, but a sense of uneasiness remains. What would happen if it ever got out of its cage? O the carnage it would bring."

Cloud9,3dvdey,iramo94,3,Sun Jul 19 21:05:58 2015 UTC,Sooo close. They were too spread out at times before team fights and CLG used that to keep getting back in the game.   That early game was masterful though. I really thought they could snowball the win from there.

Sneaky going super saiyan like always and almost pentakilling after beeing stuck in a 1v4 situation. Just a body slam away from getting it. Incarnati0n playing another great game with confidense and getting a huge lead on Pobelter, too bad they had Azir which can do work even that far behind. And ofc HAI! THE FUCKING MAN. He played a great game in the jungle putting pressure everywhere and giving the team what they need to get on top.

Cloud9,3dvdey,Therealslimshado,3,Sun Jul 19 21:23:20 2015 UTC,The Kalista was key for them this game. Maybe not let Doublelift pick it but they shoudn't have picked it themselfs.
Cloud9,3dvdey,Pedarsen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:31:59 2015 UTC,but sivir would have given them so much engage and took so much disengage from clg they wouldnt even need those 1 vs 5 from sneaky
Cloud9,3dvdey,Therealslimshado,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:34:07 2015 UTC,They already had a lot of engage with Glory/talisman/Karma shield for the way they wanted to engage (just running them down).
Cloud9,3dvdey,Pedarsen,0,Sun Jul 19 21:37:20 2015 UTC,yea but they still couldnt kill the sivir. any other adc would have died from those engages so its about taking the sivir away and she can also be secondary engage and she provided tons of disengage for clg
Cloud9,3dvdey,CamelCaseSwagMaster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:43:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i guess you're right. Hard to tell since the game would have been so much different with the pressure lemon and Sneaky did against rush hour.

Cloud9,3dvdey,shakyturnip,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:47:01 2015 UTC,"Balls just singlehandedly lost that game, horrible decisions on who to for in teamfights etc.  They created the comp to apply early pressure and get the lanes ahead which worked out perfectly but it was completly realient on balls enganges in the midgame/lategame and he is just SO BAD at this.

Cloud9,3dvans,lysdexic_mule,10,Sun Jul 19 20:36:51 2015 UTC,Yeah after Hai came in and gave some structure back to the team he's been playing with a lot more confidense.
Cloud9,3dvans,Pedarsen,5,Sun Jul 19 20:50:51 2015 UTC,Maybe because he gets ganks from Hai :)  Not saying meteos didnt ganked him but man Hai lived in the mid lane in the game against clg
Cloud9,3dvans,C9_Moon_Hype,4,Sun Jul 19 23:36:55 2015 UTC,He lived in all the lanes tbh. He's the complete opposite of Meteos. High farm and low ganks (Only the ones he find 100% certain) versus low farm and a lot of pressure. Meteos' style worked better with Hai because Hai didn't need or want that much attention. With Incarnati0n you need a little more pressure like Santorin does for Bjergsen.
Cloud9,3dvans,Pedarsen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:18:21 2015 UTC,I think another thing to keep in mind is - Hai was originally a midlaner so he understands how to jungle from a laner's perspective -> more about getting/pushing leads rather than farming. In addition - I sometimes feel like incarnati0n was used to playing a carry type of role in soloQ and when he first joined c9 i think he tried to be a part of the team as opposed to THE team (soloQ mentality) and now that c9's dropping and failing he's returned to the mentality where he has to carry.  It was so sad to see incarnati0n's face at the end of the match yesterday. breaks my heart.
Cloud9,3dvans,cneogy,8,Mon Jul 20 14:18:45 2015 UTC,He has been playing out of his mind and its because C9 finally has some direction as well as Hai playing the supportive jungle role. Thats what both the team and Jensen needed to really be able to shine. Jensen got an amazing 2v1 play and it really shows how much potential he has. In the off season i hope they pick up a strong shotcalling Jungler who is willing to support the team like Hai is right now because if they do they will get back to the top spot easily.
Cloud9,3dvans,Bloodtotem193,6,Sun Jul 19 21:06:27 2015 UTC,"What do you mean pick up a strong shotcalling Jungler? My Hai is not going anywhere, I'll tie him up if I have to.      Baby never leaves."
Cloud9,3dvans,Trithen,3,Mon Jul 20 00:38:47 2015 UTC,"Credit to Incarnation where it is due, but Hai's been exerting so much pressure on the map and around mid. It looks like it's really enabled Incarnation to step up and play confidently and aggressively in mid."
Cloud9,3dvans,TheIconoclasticFury,6,Sun Jul 19 21:51:45 2015 UTC,"^ This  If the team stays the same (unlikely) it would be great to get some international experience for Incernati0n and Hai in the Jungle, but even if they plan to do roster changes isn´t is possible do play with the roster they want for next split. Of course only if all players are free agenst at that moment (Looking at Mata, Kikis, maybe even buy aphro if CLG dont make it to worlds)"
Cloud9,3dvans,C9_Moon_Hype,8,Sun Jul 19 23:06:26 2015 UTC,"I did feel really bad reading all the comments early on in the split about how Incarnation was the problem. He was new, adjusting, and there were things to work out on the team. It looks like his style and Meteos's didn't suit each other, and that makes sense. You can't expect a Bjergsen-level mid unless he gets Bjergsen-level resources, namely ganks, lane presence from the jungler, tabs on the enemy jungler, lane pressure in bot and top to keep the enemy jungler's attention split, vision... Now, with Hai, it seems like there is more synergy between jungle and mid lane and more direction for the entire team overall. It's bittersweet: I'm sad to see Meteos gone, but I'm happy to see Hai back and hope his health has improved and that he can stay. In the end, this change seems best for Cloud9 overall, and I'm glad the current results are revealing that Incarnation isn't a ""problem."" He's really showing up and contributing majorly to the team's revitalization."
Cloud9,3dvans,PeskyRixatrix,4,Mon Jul 20 01:58:30 2015 UTC,"To be honest I feel he should be put on a challenger team to grow and getting used to competitive play. I don't feel he is the problem, but do think a shotcalling mid and support, if Lemon retires would be nice and have meteos come back and only have to worry about his play and not shotcalling. Hai shouldn't be destroying his when he retired to avoid it."
Cloud9,3dunpy,FraanSozzi,5,Sun Jul 19 17:23:21 2015 UTC,Just make the gauntlet and C9 has a chance of keeping Sneaky otherwise gg !
Cloud9,3dunpy,PershingSt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:11:30 2015 UTC,"I think Sneaky wants to stay on a team with Meteos. I think they're both open to seeing what happens with roster swaps in the offseason, but obviously both considering leaving as well."

Cloud9,3ds8e7,Imarriedzelda,4,Sun Jul 19 04:52:58 2015 UTC,After seeing how C9 has played the last two games i had high hopes for maybe a playoff run so this is a little sad. Still don't know if going to worlds would be good for C9 because they are way under the international level and would only be counter-productive to be there. Though most teams in NA isn't going to do much at worlds.
Cloud9,3ds8e7,Pedarsen,10,Sat Jul 18 23:31:02 2015 UTC,"I'd like to go into the gauntlet for the fact that it would give some Bo5 experience to Incarnati0n...to see how he does playing the same guy back to back to back in a lan setting, though I agree going to Worlds is counter-productive.

Cloud9,3dqz4t,ItzzBlink,2,Sat Jul 18 18:28:57 2015 UTC,I wonder what they are going to have in store for TSM?
Cloud9,3dqz4t,yoonaya,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:35:01 2015 UTC,All depends on the maps. I'm actually surprised it was so close on their best map (train) but it was a convincing win on their worst (mirage). I definitely think C9 can win if everyone is on point.

Cloud9,3dtsa8,INF_Ezay,3,Sun Jul 19 11:36:16 2015 UTC,Giving Lemon back the P&B is best move Jack made all year ...
Cloud9,3dtsa8,PershingSt,-4,Sun Jul 19 17:03:37 2015 UTC,"The Rumble pick was actually quite bad in that composition. They had the DMG they needed already with a semi dmg Shyvanna(which deals a shit ton), Kalista and an Ahri. All they needed was some hard CC and Shen was open which is one of the, maybe THE best, champ to play with shyvanna. I suspect that balls just didn't practice him enough, which is quite bad of him. You could already see in that game that they lacked A. tankiness, Hai got destroyed while jumping in, and B. Hard CC, to let shyvanna deal the dmg her targets need to stand still for a second since she's kited or focused very easily.  All these problems would have been fixed with a Shen top pick, i hope they realise that. I kind of do understand the Braum, since karma is not as good as he is together with kalista (and i believe C9 didnt even expect to get Kalista). And again i hope they prepared Tristana+Karma for the event they do not get the kalista. Another option for support is still the nautilus, which in both situations is fine. Since Orianna was banned Ahri is fine, too. The incredibly bad master yi pick made it extremly easy for him in lane so it didnt even really matter what he picked. (Enemys should have gone for Victor if they really gave a shit about the game)  It kind of bothers me that there was a way better comp available with the Shen which is basicly the same style of play just way more solid and NME made this easy mode League of Legends anyway with their horrendous team comp."
Cloud9,3dtsa8,CamelCaseSwagMaster,4,Sun Jul 19 12:23:28 2015 UTC,Ballz did the most damage to champions in the game ... Plz stop typing stupid shit ...
Cloud9,3dtsa8,PershingSt,0,Sun Jul 19 17:15:26 2015 UTC,Not to mention they had kickass disengage/engage synergy with their comp
Cloud9,3dtsa8,funkosaurus,3,Sun Jul 19 18:37:36 2015 UTC,"I can only partly agree with you here. I think the Rumble pick was just locked in, because Balls feels very comfortable on the Rumble. Also I really like the synergy with Braum and Shyvana. In my opinion, Hai should have taken a tanky build path in order to not lack the tankiness. You're right with the hard cc though. An Orianna pick would have been great as well, but apparently NME banned that champ.  I think Balls has to prepare some more champs to play on stage. The only champs I saw him playing this split were Rumble, Fizz and Maokai. He has a quite small champion pool imo..."
Cloud9,3dtsa8,thezaitseb,0,Sun Jul 19 14:17:12 2015 UTC,Disagree big time. Balls did a shit ton of damage this game and blew people up. Rumble is super strong on this patch and one of the best ways to snowball a game to end it before 30 minutes.

C9 wasn't making crazy mistakes, so the casters weren't calling out C9 players on bad plays, they were just praising TSM for playing absolutely beautiful CS.  Sure C9 has some room to improve, but TSM were just flat out nuts this game both strategically and aim wise.

That said, it really sounds like Sneaky (and probably Meteos) voted for Pobelter instead of Incarnati0n for the new mid. I'm not that surprised. I am sure if you watched Sneaky's stream at the time of tryouts you saw Jack (off camera) talking to him for HOURS one night with the mic silent. Sneaky seemed a little down. I have to think Jack was explaining to him why they were going with Incarnati0n."

Cloud9,3do2b5,thezaitseb,-1,Fri Jul 17 21:47:13 2015 UTC,"They made it to Second place in their First LCS Split, surely that isn't all because of individual skill right?"

Cloud9,3do2b5,Alcoholic_Satan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:25:27 2015 UTC,"I agree to have lemon as coach, imo, I just dont like charlie, I think if Lemon does retire, he should be a coach, he seems mature, his teammates seem to look up to him, and he is really up to date with the meta.   On the other hand, isn't kikis with g2 atm, not sure if it's a contract or not.  I don't think he would be a good pickup for c9, he is a good jungler and all but his playstyle is different than what c9  in general does.  but as you bring up in the last paragraph, he was the shotcaller for uol, and if he can adapt to c9 playstyle, he could be a good pick if not signed to g2.    No idea on who they would have for a new support, I think CLG will have aphro, as he and zion are the only good and consistent players on that team in my opinion.  I think TIP Adrian will still be on TIP, just have Bake on as a sub.  They may try like sheep from their challenger team, if he synergies with the team of course, that could possibly be a last resort."

Cloud9,3doptb,julioquasar,2,Sat Jul 18 03:48:31 2015 UTC,C9T aren't even guaranteed to get into the promotion spot yet and c9 isn't even guaranteed to be in a relegation spot yet...
Cloud9,3doptb,thezaitseb,-8,Sat Jul 18 00:27:38 2015 UTC,"The likely hood of Cloud 9 going to relegation is almost a guarantee though. Team 8 essentially just needs to beat TDK this week and they can secure 7th.  Cloud 9 Tempest beating Coast is a bit of a stretch but they could do it. Cloud 9 would need to 2-0 Coast and have Imagine drop 1 or both games to Winterfox in order to make it to the promo tournament because Imagine 2-0d Cloud 9 before so if they and Cloud 9 Tempest tie for record, Cloud 9 wouldn't go to the promo tourny."

Cloud9,3doptb,XstarD,-8,Sat Jul 18 01:02:33 2015 UTC,"Challenger has playoffs?  And Cloud9 currently sits at 8th with a record of 4-10. They play Enemy, CLG, TDK, and then TSM. I'm assuming they are going to lose to Enemy and everyone else besides TDK, but anything is possible. With only a win over TDK for their 2nd to last game, they finish 5-13.  Team 8 currently sits in 7th at 5-9. They're going to beat TDK, and then lose to Gravity, Liquid, and CLG. They would finish at 6-12, securing 7th place. If they were to lose against TDK, then they'd tie for C9 for 7th and they'd play a tie breaker which solely lies on Nien showing up and going Super Sayan which he's capable of doing."

Last year specifically, it was clear that Rush Hour was distinctly stronger than Sneaky and Lemon, but the rest of CLG wasn't enough to make them a world class team, even without the choking. I'd argue Lemon isn't bad enough to warrant such a roster change and possibly screwing up what frail synergy they have, for a chance of something somewhat better."

Lemonnation should become an analyst for the team, he has the brains for it, maybe he can help with finding a new support that can help with shot calling. Also i agree that Hai should move into a coaching role at C9, maybe he can be assistant coach with Charlie, then go full time.

Cloud9,3dlo1u,Hameli0,3,Fri Jul 17 18:33:01 2015 UTC,"Incarnation should definitely stay in mid. Honestly the only 2 roles worth changing if any are balls and lemon. Balls has been having another lackluster season and even though he has shown moments of brilliance on some occasions, his overall play is still significantly worse than before.     Lemon is just.. nowhere near the top of supports in NA atm, with Bunny having a phenomenal season (his last season was great too actually). Aphro, Lustboy, and others are also doing a lot better than Lemon so far. I still think Lemon is core of C9. He has great theorycrafting when it comes to items and patchnotes and I would love to discuss teamcomps with him. His mechanics just seem to betray him a lot of times, and he needs to work on his skill order and summoner spells/item casting during clutch fights.     I would probably keep Hai in jungle for now (Sorry Meteos :( ily ). As far as replacements go, idk who C9 would want for top. Someone who can definitely go in and is comfortable enough to make plays along with Hai would be optimal. A ballsy toplaner who doesn't afraid of anything.   Aphro would be a great addition to the support role for C9 though. Moving Lemon to coach is also a good idea. C9 needs a better and bigger support staff as far as I can tell though, if they want to stay relevant.      It's funny though because the type of smart and ballsy toplaner is definitely something Meteos can pull off, but I am not sure if he's even interested in something like that. I hate top personally myself, it's more of a feast or famine role which relies on laneswaps and good starts to function even remotely well. Smart teleports also help in that regard.     Whatever C9 decides to do, I will still support my favorite team so I'm not too worried. It's weird though, people who are fans of other teams mention how C9 should worry about being relegated and the whole drama with C9T team and subs (which I know doesn't matter, there's no way Jack would do something so despicable), but here I am, without a care in the world. For some reason I still feel like things will be just fine when it comes to C9. I know we can come back from this and take our rightful title back as the kings of North America once again."

Cloud9,3dlo1u,SmokingTheReefer,5,Fri Jul 17 18:53:12 2015 UTC,"i think that all of you who say incarnati0n should be replaced are just buying into rito's stupid analysis. He has NOT been behind in cs every game as they would like you to believe ( not even close to being true ), and also those stats from the jatt video on cloud 9 should be taken with a grain of salt, it's easy to say he does this much damage compared to other mid laners and is the first in mid lane deaths when u'r whole team is struggling. From the stats i've seen he has often outperformed sneaky in damage dealt to champions on cloud 9, so i think that is a lot to say when we think how good sneaky is. He has performed very well, for his first competitive split. The only person i would like over him is bejrgsen because he has a lot more experience and is a shotcaller, and even that is up for debate as i've seen incarnati0n outplay and solo kill bjersen in solo queue. i know solo queue isn't the best indication of anything but it is a good gauge for mechanics and pure lane presence. Sorry for the long post, just my 2 cents."

I believe that LOD carries sheep in some of the games i watched of the NACS. Adrian does get caught out sometimes for warding or etc. But being part of bot lane duo with sneaky is way better than being in the bot lane with apollo no offense.

Cloud9,3dlo1u,Windsigh,-1,Fri Jul 17 09:11:46 2015 UTC,"Cloud9  The most important thing here is to keep the synergies between the strong players together. (Meteos + Sneaky) Lemon moves to a coaching position to control P+B while you basically fill the roster with what works. Adding Aphromoo would be such a smart choice because not only is he a shotcaller, he already has synergy with Sneaky, or at least from what I can tell with youtube videos and streaming. Charlie moves to the analyst role, keeping his importance and intelligence on the team but allowing lemonnation to have an unbiased P+B   Coach: Lemonnation  Analyst: Charlie  T: This is undecided. I think that Dyrus would work wonders in this role because he isn't a hard carry but he fits the meta well and works with it. I think the attitude and more team resource would help him be the best he can. (his contract ends in 2015) I don't think balls would like having a new Mid laner, but if he does, he should remain top. (Only reason I say this is because it's kind of Meteos+Sneaky+Aphromoo best buds and Balls might fell left out)  J: Meteos. Meteos, to stay at top tier, would have to change to a more gank centric play style. As it is now with tanks in the jungle, farmed junglers aren't needed as much as tanks are. So either he changes, or the meta changes.  M: This is where you would spend your money. Dade. No, seriously, if you can pay Dade enough, he becomes the dream player for C9.

Cloud9,3dkprw,102WOLFPACK,5,Fri Jul 17 01:37:19 2015 UTC,Logic? NO! This clearly means C9 is giving up and hoping to boost the shit out of C9T! /s  But the thread over at /r/leagueoflegends is absurd with all the conspiracies they're coming up with. People aren't even looking at the C9 LCS page...
Cloud9,3dkprw,shishkebob83,2,Fri Jul 17 01:58:06 2015 UTC,"I really doubt any major changes are happening. Best case is they're doing it for sub reasons, or someone screwed up somewhere on lolesports (very likely). Worst case there was too much arguing between the players on C9, and they're moving Solo, Yusui and LOD to the main roster. However, LOD and Solo aren't on the main roster for subs, so this is really unlikely."

Cloud9,3dkprw,MLSxDumpster,-1,Fri Jul 17 08:21:58 2015 UTC,"There is definitely more to this than meets the eye here. If they drop half of c9, they lose ALL chances of staying in the LCS as Cloud 9 G2A. However good I think C9T is, I think they still will lose to T8 and TDK who are both looking strong after this past week. If they go throwing these curveballs this late, they are only shooting themselves in the foot."
Cloud9,3dkuek,OmegaApple,2,Fri Jul 17 02:14:05 2015 UTC,I don't quite understand the reason for doing this. If Jack is worried about C9 getting relegated and failing to get back into the LCS then why would he think putting his 3 carry roles onto the challenger team who is only 4-4 is going to do anything? I don't know can someone explain what is happening and why exactly?  Was just reading the same post in the League subreddit and Jack comments really far down saying that the original rosters did not actually change and this is just subs.  https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3dkm9u/balls_incarnation_sneaky_and_westrice_are_now_on/ct67m7g

He is right, Cloud9 has fallen off, but it isnt because they are falling, its because all of the other team got better. the only reason things this split have been so bad is because of this combined with the lack of strong shotcalling.  Give the team time like they will get in the off season and im sure we will be a top team again, whether or not we become as good or better than we were will depend on the drive of the team."

They can push Jack to make support staff changes. Hai can really make an effort to take someone under his wing as a shot caller instead of leaving them trying to emulate.  But will they? Have those legendary players had their run and are content with this being their end? I hope not. I want to see this roster push towards the end of the world's bracket. I want them to go out with respect and love they garnered in the first two splits. But do they?"
Cloud9,3dgeos,FalsifyTheTruth,7,Thu Jul 16 03:26:33 2015 UTC,I don't necessarily agree that the C9 of old is gone for good. I know this might be foolish fanboying but I really believe that C9 has the potential to come back stronger than ever and dominate once again.
Cloud9,3dgeos,Trithen,3,Thu Jul 16 06:24:47 2015 UTC,"But not in the same way. They won't be able to win purely off of Hai level (ayyy) level shot calling. Or have the best pick and bans because lemon has a notebook. No, the team must adapt. The players can get back to form, but they are going to have to figure out how to be dominate again."
Cloud9,3dgeos,FalsifyTheTruth,7,Thu Jul 16 13:42:05 2015 UTC,"You know what I hate about all the casters when they talk about Cloud 9? All they can do is talk about is C9 and their decline. They are so fascinated how C9 was dominant for 2 years straight without any competition that they only think ""Yeah we don't care who is 1st at the moment, we only care about why it isn't Cloud 9"". Same thing was happening last split even when they got 2nd. Also, after every loss C9 gets, they talk more about C9 for losing than the opposing team for winning (90/10).  We get it. (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻"
Cloud9,3dgeos,Tominater85,3,Thu Jul 16 05:17:49 2015 UTC,"Because a team getting better is logical. You make roster swaps, you add coaches, etc... No one is surprised that the top of the board is what is (except for GV. Didn't see that coming in the way it did).  What is surprising, is that the most dominant team in Western league history went from being a team that could beat anyone to a team that loses to everyone in such a short period of time. People want to know how they got there and how they get back."
Cloud9,3dgeos,FalsifyTheTruth,2,Thu Jul 16 05:25:26 2015 UTC,"the most dominant team in Western league history went from being a team that could beat anyone to a team that loses to everyone in such a short period of time. People want to know how they got there and how they get back.   Absolutely. I don't think the idea that ""oh, they've been in decline for a while now"" really holds water.  Sure, they weren't dominating splits like they used to, but look at the past few splits.    Summer 2014? 18-10 (64.3% wins), 1st place at the end of regular season, 2nd place after losing to TSM in the finals.  Spring 2015? 12-6 (66.6% wins), 2nd place at the end of regular season, again 2nd overall after losing to TSM in the finals.  The numbers look weird, because there are more teams and less games per team, but C9 actually did BETTER (66.6%) than the split before (64.3%).    And then this split? 4-10, gonna end up maybe 5-13, 6-12 if they're lucky.  A sudden drop from a regular 1st/2nd place, mid-60% win ratio team suddenly struggling to place 7th with a 30%~ win ratio? From a team as well established as C9? That IS stunning, and worth talking about quite a bit."

Ok, so this really confuses me. The way that Hai phrases it, makes it seem that he played in some of the scrims which resulted in much better games and attitudes, and THEN they asked him to play in the LCS after Meteos left. Did Hai scrim as the jungler? Is it possible that Meteos was upset that games were going better without him?   3:19 Hai says that after the season they will figure out whether or not he will be the full time jungler or to find a replacement.   While I am sure everyone enjoys having Hai on the team, we really do need to find a full time jungle main providing Meteos does leave the team for good."

Cloud9,3d40h7,xcipher64,2,Tue Jul 14 02:25:05 2015 UTC,"As far as LoL goes, it wasn't just the Dig game. They showed a very, very strong performance in the Gravity game, despite some unfortunate (albeit admittedly silly) early game and draft errors. Playing versus, I would argue, the current best team in NA. Even with just a week of practice, Hai is starting to show why he was such a dominant force for such a long time. They played incredibly from behind, and were honestly only one team fight (which, again, we admittedly misplayed heavily) from taking the game out of Gravity's reach. As I think Zirene pointed out, Baron was going to be the game winning objective for whoever ended up getting it first.  It seems pretty clear that Hai doesn't plan on staying in the long term, but I think we have a good shot at making 7th place. And if we don't make 7th, I don't think we have much to fear from challenger teams (maybe Renegades) with the way we've been trending. Charlie clearly has too much on his plate, but assuming he gets the support he needs, and assuming that we can find a new jungler who's enough of a shotcalling force, I think we could make a run for the top again next season. It's depressing how far we've fallen this season, but I'm optimistic that things will work out in the long term.  As for HoTS....I'm gonna agree with /u/MCXI that I wouldn't mind getting into that shit. Only played a couple dozen games of HoTS but I can't even imagine how that game would work on a competitive level, heh. Anyone got the hookup on how to get started with HoTS?"

So happy to see him perform. 60 CS up and getting such great kill participation, I'll always vouch for this guy. This is why you keep the faith. I still fully believe in him and the boys. Beyond ecstatic today.    I wanna point out that C9 flourished because they played aggressive. NA as a scene is awful at being aggressive, forcing advantages, and taking everything. Incarnati0n, and the team as a whole stomped because they went all out, and forced everything. It's the style they play, and they make work. When they take the game by the throat and play it their way, they own it, and take every once away from their opponents. It won them this game, and it can lift them in the standings if they keep playing this style, with this confidence."

I think this roster as is has potential and before the next /r/LoL circlejerk brings the next player down, I would like to see how this roster performs in the coming weeks.

NME is a very important game but TDK is a must win. Taking a game from the other 3 would be a nice bonus. NME has a tough schedule as well (GV, TL, us, TSM, Dig) so if Cloud 9 passes them we can just choose to play C9T and have relegations be irrelevant."

Cloud9,3d1t57,Hamilton33,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:52:35 2015 UTC,"Well, most tournaments are offline events, but seasons are all online. Their lineup has changed over the course of the past year, losing Hiko and picking up Shahzam and then losing Shahzam and Semphis and picking up Freakazoid and Skadoodle. /r/cseventvods is a good place to watch matches.   For online events, they are almost all BO1 events, some online tournaments are BO3, and qualifiers can be either BO1/BO3. As for tournaments, the group stages of most recent tournaments are shifting towards BO3 groups, but previously it's a BO1 group stage. This usually pans out with a winners match and a losers match, then with a BO1 from the loser of the winners and the winner of the losers.  If you want to start watching some games even from when C9 was struggling with this current lineup, Gfnity Spring Masters 2 was the first tourney with this lineup, they were only a three-day old team or something like that. These are all BO3 matches. A more recent one is the Gfnity Summer Masters 1. These have BO2 group stages. Most of the matches they have played with this lineup are online, that's in the ESL ESEA Season 1 Pro League (not finals).  The most recent result is their ESL ESEA Pro League Finals run, which they had the best outing for a North American team. Then right now (the finals is live) is ESWC, where they also are doing well for an NA team.  If you want to see highlights, check out the C9.gg youtube channel, I know Calle is doing an amazing job of working on some highlights from their team. Also there's the old Hiko clutch from ESL One Cologne.. Anything else, let me know!"

I'm not hating on C9, but I certainly had higher hopes. Didn't we all though?  On a side note, I assuage my feelings by watching our CS:GO team. They look great and play great."
Cloud9,3czx9l,Ace_Machine,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:30:02 2015 UTC,"I strangely don't mind it as we likely would have been stomped at playoffs/worlds based on our play. I try to take it as a humbling experience as other teams did a combination of synergized better/worked harder/drafted better/ and had strats that helped them succeed.  All in all, makes management take a hard look at personnel and the surrounding cast to figure out what changes may need to be made. Long term, it's for the best. Short term it's obviously depressing as sin though."

Cloud9,3cybdl,theggthdoctor,7,Sat Jul 11 21:51:38 2015 UTC,"Watching C9 lose is so heartbreaking. And honestly I feel like all of us fans feel the same way. Idk why Nien blew the whole flaming thing out of proportion, literally every other team's fans are a lot harsher to their teams than we are here. I see all of us fans as part of the C9 family, sticking together and consoling each other... while watching our favorite team crumble before our very eyes.The Balls equalizer was very frustrating to watch, but it's okay, we could have dealt with one mistake. The problem happened when Sneaky decided to tumble around their frontline to try and delete Altec. Sneaky's Vayne was actually a great pick. GRV was full of low/midrange champs, and Nid doesn't do too well in teamfight unless she has already softened up the enemies with spears.      Why dive around their frontline if you're on a low range adc yourself? As a Vayne with botrk you have 2 forms of HP damage. just take advantage of that and delete their frontline before Sivir deletes yours. Those fights are essentially freebies because the Nid will hesitate to go in unless her spear or trap lands, and we can use that time frame to fight the other players on GRV. We won the teamfight previous to that one with Sneaky getting the kill on the tankier champs first before killing Sivir and it worked out very well.      The baron fight with multiple people making errors really hurt us big time, and GRV used the buff very well to push objectives. I was also frustrated when nobody was trying to defend the 2nd inhibitor.. and then the third...At least make some sort of ditch effort guys. By some miracle of Odin you might have been able to defend it. But staying near nexus and letting everything die without contesting sucks so much.      I loved watching C9 because they always loved fighting even when they were behind in gold, beating enemy teams with their superior teamfighting strategy. Now I more or less pray that we don't end up losing a big teamfight badly which ruins the game for us. And so far all this praying is not helping. C9 pls."

They could've easily steam rolled this game by building pure armor, all they had to do is NOT feed nidalee or not completely fuck up that team fight at baron.  People acting like Gravity had some super comp. The comp isn't even that good, they just are all playing comfort champions and C9 suck ass now, but people are trying to blame P&B as a reason they are losing.  P&B had nothing to do with this game.   Edit: Because rage post"

Cloud9,3cybdl,Choad_Warrior,6,Sun Jul 12 11:13:25 2015 UTC,Better game and against a top 3 team so deffinitly something good to take from it. The overall team fighting capabilities of the team is really low though.
Cloud9,3cybdl,Pedarsen,7,Sat Jul 11 21:55:31 2015 UTC,The pick and bans are so freaking bad...
Cloud9,3cybdl,2ylo,5,Sat Jul 11 21:57:08 2015 UTC,"Jack needs to fucking do something about this shit. Charlie is a horrible coach who fails p/b every game. He should have been fired weeks ago. The team has no cohesion, no plan, no shotcalling. None of the teamplay we saw with C9 of old.   At the beginning of the season, I'd be ok with this because of a new midlaner+shotcaller, but this team is showing NO improvement. It's the same damn thing every game. Honestly, the commenters here are being too lenient and passive. No, firing Charlie is not too far. No, this team is not improving. No, the games aren't looking better."
Cloud9,3cybdl,BItchesBeOnMyD,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:11:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know about 'not looking better'. I'd say their games with Hai have shown a marked improvement. They very nearly took games off of both Gravity and Impulse and did pretty well against Liquid. Previously they got completely wrecked by weaker teams than those and didn't seem to put up nearly as much of a fight.  A lot of the same problems are still around though. P/B, some team-fighting, unforced individual errors. But the shot-calling has markedly improved, they seem to put up more of a fight when losing, and I feel like Hai's jungle performance is improving (as well as can be expected all things considered)."
Cloud9,3cybdl,TheIconoclasticFury,13,Sun Jul 12 10:45:35 2015 UTC,It was a vastly better game from C9 than many I have seen from them. I'll take it.  That Rumble ult fucked us.
Cloud9,3cybdl,Ace_Machine,10,Sat Jul 11 21:53:48 2015 UTC,"""Sneaky is really good at Vayne"" ""that rumble ult fucked us"" Sneaky's positioning in that fight lost the teamfight. No excuses. His positioning was absolute shit. Tumbled right into shed taunt. I don't even.."
Cloud9,3cybdl,funkosaurus,-4,Sat Jul 11 22:00:09 2015 UTC,"It would be impossible to teamfight vs. that team... are you stupid?  Shen, Sivir speed, Maokai, Urgot, and a nidalee that one shots you without her team's health."
Cloud9,3cybdl,miztah1999z,10,Sat Jul 11 22:02:08 2015 UTC,Are you an idiot? Gravity face checked into C9 with rumble/Braum/Viktor and Sneaky tried to stealth past their front line. If you can't win a teamfight with that comp when the enemy team face checks you then you're never going to win a team fight
Cloud9,3cybdl,funkosaurus,-4,Sat Jul 11 22:07:33 2015 UTC,You try playing vayne versus that comp. Just playing against a maokai as vayne is painful.
Cloud9,3cybdl,miztah1999z,6,Sat Jul 11 22:08:58 2015 UTC,"? Maokai ignored Sneaky the entire game lol. Which, honestly, he can do if the vayne is tumbling into your shen taunt/ignite and running through your team"
Cloud9,3cybdl,funkosaurus,-4,Sat Jul 11 22:11:19 2015 UTC,"When you are grouped like that, it's hard to dodge the shen taunt."
Cloud9,3cybdl,miztah1999z,4,Sat Jul 11 22:13:25 2015 UTC,"He tumbled straight into the enemy team into the shen taunt.  I'm sure his thinking was ""I'm going to stealth through Gravity so I can get onto Altec and kill him while the front line is focused on my team"" but Bunny saw the tumble coming and intercepted him and ignited him so Altec had vision.  Rewatch the fight, it's not hard to see how bad of a play it was.  Had it worked out, he'd have been a god, but it didn't. At all."
Cloud9,3cybdl,funkosaurus,-1,Sat Jul 11 22:17:23 2015 UTC,I haven't seen Balls do well with that rumble skin...  Balls if you are reading this please go back to using rumble in the jungle so you can hit ults like this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKXDkfAFf8c&t=68m50s
Cloud9,3cybdl,miztah1999z,3,Sat Jul 11 21:57:03 2015 UTC,"I was really dissapointed with Lemon this game... actually tbh, this seems to be a theme. He was constantly being chunked out and having to back or couldn't contribute to the upcoming fights, he was completely useless.   Also, the P&B was really bad. We ban Kalista, leave up Sivir and then don't first pick it. I realize balls wants Rumble, but it's not that much of a contested pick, so why not just pick it later and get sivir, which is honestly a much more important pick.   I don't mean to jump on the band wagon, but you can't ignore that C9's pick and ban is truely horrible and we're never going to be picking up wins if this continues. If Jack doesn't step up now and get in someone that can do a better job, C9 WILL get relegated. At some point you've got to put friendship aside."
Cloud9,3cybdl,synackSA,2,Sun Jul 12 06:35:39 2015 UTC,"If we brought Hai back, why not try the original team of Balls, Meteos, Hai, Sneaky/Lemon? Might as well just try it and see if it anything changes? I mean with only 5 games to go, not much to lose anymore."

Cloud9,3cybdl,PershingSt,4,Sun Jul 12 04:59:36 2015 UTC,Incarnation is not the problem and he's probably the most consistent person on the team atm.

Cloud9,3cybdl,PershingSt,4,Sun Jul 12 08:24:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly C9 didn't have a bad pick ban phase. GV just got some stuff they wanted because of the circumstances that C9 was under.   -Here's a comment from the post game thread that I thought analyzed C9 pretty well: ""Piggy backing off of this to highlight c9's reasoning behind these picks. The one thing c9 did that CLG and TSM did not last week was pick vayne. Vayne beats sivir and shen in lane really well, and in theory should do well against a team with higher health targets. You'll also notice rumble rushed a liandries here and it worked well int he early mid game vs the tanky comp of gravity. On top of this, c9 picked up braum, that does wonders at holding off GVs only significant siege tool, nidalee. Every other memeber of GV has really low range, which is why they only opted to siege when they had baron. If sivir and urgot got in range to attack tower, a rumble/ braum ult followed up by reksais secondary engage would offer vayne and viktor plenty of time to deal their damage, as GV had very low disengage tools. This team comp was actuallly well drafted by c9, and it was working very well in the midgame until the baron fight that c9 misplayed horribly. Particularity, Balls started off the fight with a poor ultimate, that could have easily hit 3 members instead of one in a facecheck by GV. Also, Sneaky went deep way too early after being chunked down by GVs frontline. If c9 had played that jump on GV properly, it could have swung the game in the opposite direction, and it would have been difficult for GV to comeback form a baroned up c9.""  -Here are my thoughts: It's not like they could have banned Urgot, Sivir, Shen, and Nidalee. C9 were unfortunate to be blue side. This means they had to ban Ryze and Kalista, the 2 most powerful picks in the current patch LCS is played on. If you look at the first 2 games played (Enemy v CLG and TL vs TDK), blue side banned those 2 champs as well. This leaves C9 with only 1 ban. C9 banned Naut, a powerpick that shits on Vayne. Even if Vayne buys QSS, not much she can really use QSS for, whereas for Shen, Vayne can immediately QSS Shen taunt. C9 could have banned Urgot instead, but Shen still gets first picked. C9 could have first round taken Sivir and Nautilus. But C9 values the Rumble a lot on Balls and maybe Reksai is Hai's best meta champ that he can work with. Not taking Sivir is the only legit criticism I see for C9's pick ban, but Vayne is seen as a decent pick into Sivir. Unfortunately, C9 had a tragic lvl 1 which prevented C9's bot lane to fully use the potential of their laning phase. Overall, C9 could only ban 1 champ away from GV, but could have picked the Sivir for themselves, which they probably should have over Reksai (but even then Reksai is probably Hai's best meta champ). Sivir is the only criticism I see for C9's pick ban phase.  If C9 won that fight near baron, could have been a C9 win. They lost that fight, GV ran away with their advantage. Honestly, it was mainly the Shen and Nidalee that won GV the game."
Cloud9,3cybdl,ElBluntDealer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:38:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I agree with you. I think C9 should have picked up Sivir in the first rotation. Instead, we go for Balls' Rumble... Gosh. And he didn't even land the ult properly in that teamfight."

Insted he dived the back line and got bursted without getting a kill because of the she ulti that should have been timed out. Sneaky is my favorite member of the team but it seems his late game misplays are loosing alot of games.   Edit clarity"

Cloud9 LoL has Charlie and maybe one other analyst (?) as far as a support squad goes. They have been far surpassed by pretty much every major org in terms of coaching, analysts, support staff, etc..., assuming what we know is all they have.   I feel like they didn't adapt with the scene with this stuff because it didn't seem like they needed it because Hai seemed to do all of it. So now that it's clear that they do need it, I except to see Cloud9 grow in that way. I'm not scared about heavy roster swaps. Those players know what they COULD do if they can get into form."

Cloud9,3cqvq6,Razgrizacez,2,Sat Jul 11 02:08:19 2015 UTC,Yeah should be a good series considering how even the series between both teams has been online.

Cloud9,3cqvq6,Razgrizacez,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:21:38 2015 UTC,"Predictions :  Group A - 1)C9 and 2)KeyD, because F3 is playing with an American standin, Hiko (they're Russian). I think we're the clear favorites to advance, but it's still BO1.  Group B : 1)NiP and LDLC.white. 2)LDLC can beat TL, they're a T2 European team, and have come close to beating EnvyUs, so I would put them ahead of TL  Group C: 2)Titan and 1)Na'Vi. That's easy, their group isn't that strong. Luminosity/SK could upset, but I don't see that happening.   Group D: 1)EnvyUs and 2)CLG. Renegades hasn't shown me that much to be hyped about, yes I know they're ex VOX, but they only took one map off fnatic, I wouldn't consider them that good. Also Bravado still has miles to learn.

Cloud9,3cmzlo,necroGG,2,Thu Jul 9 12:45:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe there is a correlation between him only playing Leblanc and Zed in EU, which are now doodoo and nerfed, and now he is playing more sustained damage late game carries? He also trolls a lot in solo q."
Cloud9,3cmzlo,FraanSozzi,3,Thu Jul 9 16:00:47 2015 UTC,"That's because on C9 Jensen he got higher MMR from start of playing in NA than TOP 10 people in NA challenger. Basically, he's playing with/vs high challenger, have MMR as high challenger but his league is master."

Cloud9,3cg9ix,XstarD,11,Tue Jul 7 17:58:54 2015 UTC,"Completely disagree with the Hai part. It's not like he keeps coming back constantly... It seems as if it was desperation to not get auto relegated and he was basically the only one who could really save us. You also have no idea if he can make the change to a jungler. I think its wrong to say Hai can't be a jungler and never will be one. There are a lot of pro-players that have switched roles and it worked out pretty damn well.   Hai at Jungle is actually very good. Especially since we can keep his world-class shot calling and its not that mechanically intensive. It doesn't require tons of SoloQ practice since its more about knowledge of the game, which he has A LOT of. The main reason we all loved Hai on C9 was because of his shot-calling, and it started to be irrelevant when he couldn't keep up with mid. So we replaced him with an up and coming star Incarnati0n. He'll be able to take over the mid lane role and he has better mechanics, but at the same time, we don't lose Hai's shot-calling if he stays at Jungle. Meteos at support seems weird, but I actually think it could work out since him and Sneaky have a really close bond, plus he was always good at maintaining vision control around the map."
Cloud9,3cg9ix,ObamaAteMyChicken,4,Tue Jul 7 22:51:23 2015 UTC,Irony is hai was a jungle main before meteos joined.
Cloud9,3cg9ix,WrongWayBo,2,Wed Jul 8 12:51:08 2015 UTC,Really good post!  I have to agree with you that right now (besides from shotcalling issues) Lemon is the weakest link.  The ideal setting would be a replacement for Lemon that can shotcall.
Cloud9,3cg9ix,Pedarsen,2,Tue Jul 7 20:57:19 2015 UTC,Hai is more of a jungler than a mid laner.
Cloud9,3cg9ix,mekalb,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:36:36 2015 UTC,I'd agree with you.
Cloud9,3cg9ix,synackSA,2,Wed Jul 8 15:32:39 2015 UTC,"Meteos - Honestly feel as though the pressure of shotcalling has affected his playstyle through the split. Instead of his usual farm heavy style he seems to be feeling the need to gank even when it's better for him not to   Have you and I been watching the same games? I mean I could be 100% wrong and I'd have to go back and look, but I feel like since he's been shot calling, he's been in even more of a farm mode than before and his vision control has slipped too.   Charlie (coach) - Not impressed but can make a case to justify him. He never signed onto C9 to be a coach, he's always been an ANALYST.   This is no excuse, because being an analyst would suggest that he would have done his research into the opposing team and the current meta and would be able to do an actualy pick and ban phase that didn't fall flat on it's face. In my honest opinion this the biggest problem C9 face with Hai back in the team. Their pick and ban this whole split has been horrendous and as a analyst, it should be your job to come up with good pick and bans as well as be able to layout a good early game for the team by analyzing what your opponents are doing in previous games. From what we're seeing, this isn't really happening, bar the last early game vs TL."
Cloud9,3cg9ix,yes_its_him,5,Wed Jul 8 15:16:38 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue is rotations and teamfights.  Incarnation is not doing very well at these.  Even when he gets damage down, it doesn't result in kills (he has the lowest KDA for a current mid by quite a bit), and he's not helping with objectives in most cases, he's just laning.  Part of the problem is that when not everybody is playing as a team, it detracts from everybody's performance as well.  Why should someone rotate if someone else isn't?"
Cloud9,3cg9ix,TheGeoninja,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:45:53 2015 UTC,I think that might be because he plays teamfights a lot like a solo queue game. In some instances he will jump in when the odds are terrible or he will pull out at the slightest loss.

This makes sense. Lane bullies don't work any more, because of the league of tanks TM stopping their damage. Ad carries need to be either utility (sivir, corki) or large game monsters (jinx, kalista, tristana) in order to work in this meta. There is nothing he can do about it."
Cloud9,3cg9ix,blitzKriegzzz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:18:06 2015 UTC,I don't see all of his streams because of awkward times for me so I didn't know he said that so thanks for pointing it out. I understand that he's not a priority pick but even last split when he was pretty shit when Sneaky picked him up he did well.
Cloud9,3cg9ix,pearl2201,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:34:15 2015 UTC,"Balls was never one of the best tops in world, in NA yes not the world. He hasn't been on the same level since the Shyvana/Renekton/Mundo meta.. in which meteos would gank top lane everygame and no one would counter. NA LCS has since become better in which that won't work anymore. Balls has been good on Fizz.. but he has had his issues. Often time he is given the lead through lane swaps and doesn't do anything with it. Of course now is not the time to change him, but after relegations they should check.  I don't think Meteos' farm heavy style will work anymore. He has always been a good play maker and has had good vision control though, which may lead him to transfer to the support role.  The meta doesn't favor incarnation. I think everyone expected him to be as good as bjergsen, but that doesn't look to be the case. But you want to give some one a full split. I disagree with how he was picked for the team though. If C9 did better in scrims w/ other tryouts then why weren't they picked for the team?  Sneaky has still been good. The meta doesn't favor adc's though so he cant carry as hard.  Lemon made mistakes as often as Hai ( getting caught ). I think this is a role they can experiment with.  They should bring in more staff, as a lot of teams have multiple analysts and such."

Charlie is an analyst not a coach, Jack needs to step up as owner.  Oh, and we should get Mata or Aphro to replace Lemon, but keep Incarnation cuz he's just ramping up.

Cloud9,3cezy8,MCXI,2,Tue Jul 7 16:10:44 2015 UTC,"Well Mata is one of the best players ever so it's hard to say he is a bad puckup, the big issue I can think of is hai's shot calling is based on info fed by the other players constantly throughout the game and a language barrier would make that difficult. Also hai has bad wrists and I would hate for him to get injured but playing for c9 for too long if he starts hurting again.   Also gonna but funny if c9 snags a danish mid and then turns around and gets a Korean support, gonna hear salt from tsm 4 ever lol"
Cloud9,3cezy8,djanulis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:21:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think Swaping out Incarnati0n  for a Korean mid may help as well, it would give mata someone to relate and speak to on the team. The language barrier could be small for in game stuff since Mata would be here for around 6 months before LCS, if this was to happen."
Cloud9,3cezy8,XstarD,2,Tue Jul 7 16:13:05 2015 UTC,Let's say we did pick up Mata and a Korean mid. This doesn't automatically mean they will get along. Piglet and Fenix didn't even talk for a good month or so when they first joined Liquid because Piglet was a world champion and Fenix wasn't. Incarnati0n has NO reason to be kicked.

Personally, I'm a jungle main but have generally performed better on support, so I could see this working out. I don't think it's necessarily easier than jungling; I just feel less pressured playing support, allowing me to go for plays more fearlessly. If Meteos is a slightly more aggressive support than Lemon, this could be great."

I remember watching live post game interview of Balls and Lemonation, after their win. It was funny, awkward but I liked the team. I remember their heartbreaking loss to FNC in game 3 of season 3. I remember the final fight between C9 vs TSM game 5 in season 4 summer finals, where turtle crit sneaky twice to force a flash. Darn RNG. It wasn't and won't be same without Meteos, Hai, Lemon or anyone. The C9 I love is the C9 with all 5, kicking ass, playing like a true team.  Thanks for all the memories.. C9 has been a big part of my life, in the last 3 years, where I have personally been doing some soul searching... Thanks for all the entertainment over the years, when life can be pretty tough.I hope the team can somehow get to worlds one last time, with the 5 people who I have kind of grew up with/ and learned to love. I hope the team can finish strong, make it to worlds, with the retro 5, that made us c9 fans, one last time."
Cloud9,3c8vif,hologramlcs,2,Mon Jul 6 01:20:19 2015 UTC,"Where is the support? I remember when my local football team only won 2 games in a season. They won their first match, then their last match. Still every week I believed a win was attainable. The season is over when it is over."
Cloud9,3c8vif,cacduy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:10:54 2015 UTC,"I have supported too many losing teams in life, and I question if 'support' is really helpful or even necessary. You just have look at CLG, to see my point. I think the ultimate fate of success or failure is hardly ever determined by the support, i.e. external motivation, but rather determined by the fire from the within.   In C9's case, because they beat a Korean's team, their will to win was not the same anymore. That was kind of their goal. If C9 and its fans are okay with that, then what would motivate them to improve?   In of the best MMA knockout ever - Gary Goodridge vs Paul Herrera. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1QaZYB-xzA  In order to train against Paul, Gary believed that Paul was in KKK and a racist. This gave him a fire and motivated him to work hard and fought with zeal.   I think as fans, we would do more harm if we were to support complacency and expect that they somehow will figure it out. I think we should demand C9 to get into semi finals in worlds. We should demand C9 to achieve higher. We should demand and expect excellence.   In the movie 300, the men at the end just had no energy left even though their heart wanted to fight. I was watching Hai's stream, he said that 'it felt like a lot of work' after a win, and I think this is just a symptom that he is getting too old for this game. So I don't want to expect too much because there are physical limitations. Even if the hearts want to, the body, the body can still say no."

Even though I was passionate, I was never closely attached personally like I was with the team C9. The guys in C9 I guess are more relatable. With C9's end of dominance, so ends a phase of myself.   Oh, if they don't make it to playoffs, I hope they at least do a kennel/zac/kha'zix/ashe/zyra tribute game to finish the season... and I wish riot will do a hall of fame, team based one, instead of individual one... so that all 5 members of c9 can be remembered...   one day, there will probably a league of legends lcs hall of fame in LA. I will probably be old and have kids/grandkids(?), and I hope to see a hologram/videos of the 5 c9 players that had forever changed na lcs.. speaking of which, i wonder if riot should do 360 degree camera shot of c9 to prepare for the future...    i guess no matter what happens in the next 3(?) weeks, worlds or not.. their legacy are already set.. I wouldn't mind if they want to delight their fans one last time though in worlds, and avenge against the FNC loss. Either way, thanks c9 for the last 2-3 years..."

I'm positive we can win to stay in the LCS, but the off-season has to be full of change.   Lemonnation and Balls need to show extreme improvement or they need to be taken off the starting roster. They've been really bad this split and for Balls it's been a problem since last split as well. It's extremely unacceptable for a guy to constantly win his lane and carry games to just play like this now in a meta where top laners are carries!  Sneaky really needs an aggressive/mechanical support to work with him. Lemonnation isn't bad at all, but his lack of mechanical skill really hurts Sneaky and the team. He needs to move to analyst because he can really shine there.  The support staff really needs to improve as well. Someone pointed out them looking to Korea and getting a coach that's similar to the ones those top teams in LCK have. Not someone that's going to be buddy-buddy with them. They need a coach that's going to tell them ""You don't wanna play this? Tough. Play it or you don't play at all"" or ""You don't know how to play this champ? Learn it; problem solved."""

And lemon, well cba to comment on his gameplay. Even with all of this, i think the game could have been won if hai would not have been caught mid with incarnation top, which translated into an ace + baron for t8. Really fucking disappointed with this split. Let's hope for the roster and management changes we need for next split and you'd better pray this team doesn't get relegated, because i think sneaky will leave if that happens."
Cloud9,3c8vif,tehcatsmiaw,3,Mon Jul 6 16:14:07 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to think about it, but I now think that Balls should be replaced. He's fallen behind far too much this split and also in the spring split. Incarnati0n, and Sneaky hopefully will stay. I'm kind of mixed on the Lemon situation, on one hand the bot lane chemistry shouldn't be broken, but Lemon's mechanics aren't the same as before. The team is in need of serious changes, both to players and staffing. Hopefully they can escape getting relegated."
Cloud9,3c8vif,A_Sea_Change,2,Mon Jul 6 00:21:34 2015 UTC,Honestly... If it meant getting a reliable shotcaller and a decent pick/ban coach i would want hai on support and lemon as coach.

Cloud9,3c8vif,kripis,2,Mon Jul 6 03:43:30 2015 UTC,"Game was entirely the fault of whoever decided Rumble over ez, and then whoever decided Zed.  Zed was a terrible choice in that comp.  Shen +thresh lantern makes Zed's ult useless immediately."

Cloud9,3c8vif,PershingSt,-1,Mon Jul 6 00:12:38 2015 UTC,"Everyone played poorly this game. Balls getting caught out AGAIN in bad places. Sneaky had issues - trying to take a needless 1v1 Shen and in the mid lane team fight, he could have flashed the taunt and lived to prevent the Baron. Lemon I think didn't play awful this game, he initiated the one fight C9 won. Hai was pretty MIA.  In some ways, Incarnation probably played the best on the team - he made very few mistakes realistically. He played the role well - he won lane pretty hard and applied strong split push pressure. The one catastrophic fight where C9's four died - that was them getting caught while Incarnation played his role well. The other four made a critical mistake that threw the game.  However, not using your ult a single time, even if it's a suboptimal ult, just bugs me. You can use the ult to burn cooldowns - flashes, heals, QSSes, Shen ult - and set up for the rest of the team. Maybe use it while they are doing Baron and try to make an outplay. At the end of the day, if you don't even try to make a play, you're going to lose anyways, so why don't you at least try?   Hai had games where he went like 0/7/2 on Zed and he was always trying his best to win the game. He knew if he played safe, the team would straight up lose. You think he would have let an entire game go by with out using the ult? No.  I don't really know what the point of this post was besides venting. I don't think Incarnation played that poorly, but it did feel like he went full Shiphtur mode and rolled over to let his team lose, which I think is worse that making mistakes."

Cloud9,3c8vif,raptearer,0,Mon Jul 6 00:58:19 2015 UTC,"I honestly think he was just waiting for Hai to tell him to ult.  The TF ults last game when they were making trades were probably Hai telling him to ult there while they tried to slow down Baron.  Honestly, I wasn't expecting much; they didn't scrim as a team for an entire week (the whole team probably, since Meteos quitting happened abruptly). It was definitely too much to expect Hai to be the godsend of C9 without any practice, especially if they team mental state was already shitty.  GG, we're probably going to relegations."

Lemon has been pretty  unimpressive (for example their first game this week against Team Liquid, he fucked up the guaranteed first blood on midlane at the start of the game, he literally just had to either pulv the yasuo dash or simply headbutt him into the team) aside from his off meta picks he practices, and has never been able to play the high skillcap supports like thresh to where they are actually worth picking, and I think that most of the greatest strengths that Lemon brings to the team could also be brought to the team from a coaching role."

Cloud9,3cc1ib,wayavas,8,Mon Jul 6 19:10:09 2015 UTC,"I'd argue it's not just one person's fault. The team started to become complacent. A lot of their faults were masked by the lack of competition in NA after they burst onto the scene and changed the way Pick and Bans, Shotcalling, and Map control was basically done. As other teams started to catch up the infrastructure behind Cloud9 never grew to support them moving forward. Charlie is a great analyst and has potential to be a good coach, but like we've seen recently players make the best coaches which is why I hope Lemonnation is brought on as a coach and a long term shot calling solution is found whether it be a shot calling support or a shot calling jungle. Balls has fallen off recently as well. Sneaky remains one of the consistent ones on the team but you can tell they are struggling."
Cloud9,3cc1ib,Flangebro,3,Mon Jul 6 19:17:48 2015 UTC,At this point all we can hope for is that C9 doesn't get auto-relegated

They called Hai in Thursday, so he had time to practice Friday ( a new competitive roll, too). So coordination and practice just were not there for the team.   Sure, Saturday was promising, but I also think TL is overrated a bit, and they enemies room, and C9's coordination was not completely there. Sunday? That was a p/b failure. Zed in a extremely unfavorable meta, and the enemy team itemized accordingly. These are issues that happen when your jungler is ""new,"" and unpracticed."
Cloud9,3cc1ib,Ace_Machine,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:57:29 2015 UTC,"I think the Balls hate is a little unjustified. People keep saying that he is doing bad but is that really his fault? if we look at the past couple of splits he has been forced to play certain champs mainly because of Hai's champion pool. And now that he has Incarnati0n in the mid lane he has been having some better games on different champs. I think a lot of his ""bad"" games are mainly because of the team doing bad and not because he is doing poorly.  Also, fucking Piglet showed him some huge respect saying that he is the best asset on Cloud 9 for multiple reasons. when someone that good says something like that there has to be some merit to it."
Cloud9,3cc1ib,Bloodtotem193,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:50:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah but there have been some very big misplays on his part as well..dying very far up in the T8 game for the first blood and just walking by his own bush and getting popped by porpoise, which I'm sure he wasn't expecting but maybe should've been cautious of since they seemed to be focusing him already. I think it would be great for C9 for balls to become the top lane monster again."
Cloud9,3cc1ib,Cptsaber44,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:16:26 2015 UTC,"This so much. From complacency in the roster to a lacking infrastructure. On paper, Cloud 9's roster is a top-tier group easily, but practically nothing has been done to support the team and C9's infrastructure is probably one of the worst right now.   The issue with Balls is something that should have been solved at the end of last split and in playoffs, it seemed like it had been solved. To go from a top laner that dominates the top lane to one that you need to hope doesn't lose his lane isn't acceptable.   Even Sneaky and Meteos looked a lot worse this split. This is a really good lesson for the organization and the roster. You can't just hit the top and then think that's the end of improving. Teams will catch up, and you need to be consistently improving if you want to continue to be at the top. TSM is pretty good example of a team that's constantly looking to improve and very rarely becomes complacent. C9 should compare themselves to TSM right now in where they need to improve and then look to Korea on what's ideal for a support staff. Charlie is a good analyst, but when it comes to coaching it looks like he's lacking greatly because the team is consistently losing p&b and the team isn't performing at a level they should be."

If this is what the team looks like right after Hai got put in, with what I suspect is with little to no prep, then the future of this team looks to be a lot brighter than before."

Cloud9,3c56ka,miztah1999z,9,Sat Jul 4 22:10:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was the engages that were bad, I think the entire reason c9 didn't win was Fenix's windwalls. It completely neutralized Sneaky and Incarnation."
Cloud9,3c56ka,Diamond_Dartus,4,Sat Jul 4 22:12:06 2015 UTC,Fenix is the WHOLE reason TL came back and won the game. if he was not playing Yasuo that game would have been won by C9
Cloud9,3c56ka,Bloodtotem193,2,Sat Jul 4 22:20:45 2015 UTC,Windwall AND that baron fight imo. Lemon was so out of place.
Cloud9,3c56ka,Pedarsen,2,Sat Jul 4 22:21:58 2015 UTC,Yes the Lemon play at baron was bad but that was not a big enough play for TL to have come back. it was really Yasuo and the teamfights that ultimately won the game.

Cloud9,3c56ka,Rebooturtle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:19:41 2015 UTC,Yeah he played Yasuo. God I hate Yasuo. :P
Cloud9,3c56ka,Darkoth225,5,Sun Jul 5 03:56:28 2015 UTC,"Lemon missed so many combos that game, and he even knocked the sharked target out of like 3 fights... And people will still blame Incarnation :("
Cloud9,3c56ka,ObamaAteMyChicken,4,Sat Jul 4 22:14:13 2015 UTC,Is Hai temporary? I really hope he stays.......
Cloud9,3c56ka,Bennyboozle,9,Sat Jul 4 22:27:39 2015 UTC,same (meme intended)
Cloud9,3c56ka,OmegaApple,4,Sat Jul 4 22:31:19 2015 UTC,So close damnit. Putting Lemon on other side of baron to zone was the death of them. Doing that fully committed to baron and didnt give option to back off. Early game was really well played.
Cloud9,3c56ka,arbitraryasian,3,Sat Jul 4 22:11:21 2015 UTC,he decided not to flash over for some reason.
Cloud9,3c56ka,Kalsion,2,Sat Jul 4 22:13:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that call was pretty greedy. I understand the thought process there but I guess they didn't have enough power at the time."
Cloud9,3c56ka,scrubbub,4,Sat Jul 4 22:12:46 2015 UTC,"Definitely an improvement, though not a win. Against a worse team i think they'd have stomped. Hopefully Hai can at least pull C9 out of relegation and maybe into playoffs. :)"
Cloud9,3c56ka,Tarheels96,2,Sat Jul 4 22:11:32 2015 UTC,I think if we don't get relegation we can maybe qualify for worlds through gauntlet? FAITH
Cloud9,3c56ka,UrSh4d0w,2,Sat Jul 4 22:20:20 2015 UTC,Seems better. Can maybe make a run. happy about it
Cloud9,3c56ka,BarelyLegalZ,2,Sat Jul 4 22:11:29 2015 UTC,"Such a huge improvement from the last few weeks, just some individual mistakes in the mid to late game."
Cloud9,3c56ka,A_Sea_Change,2,Sat Jul 4 22:11:52 2015 UTC,"Glad to see Hai's shotcalling back in the C9 comms, but lemon's mechanics were a bit off at times.  The first 4 man gank mid would have gone off perfectly, but lemon was just slow on the combo. Pissed me off the second I saw it"
Cloud9,3c56ka,Bloodtotem193,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:13:17 2015 UTC,So Meteos support Lemon coach?
Cloud9,3c56ka,KayleOnly,2,Sun Jul 5 05:16:33 2015 UTC,"Cloud9 was looking better, even though they lost it was nice to see C9 actually doing something. Before C9 matches looked like C9 was just slowly dying, and nothing would happen in the games. This game looked like C9 was more confident and actually taking risks. Looks like Cloud9 may start to do well now."
Cloud9,3c56ka,Atrane_xD,2,Sat Jul 4 22:13:53 2015 UTC,"This was an AMAZING improvement. The early game was amazing, a lot of calls were very C9 again and i loved it. The game turned and was lost SOLELY because Yasuo got a monster teamfight and TL was able to come back big time off of it. Was a slight misplay and that can be easily cleaned up when Hai has a lot more time to get used to playing in the Junlge.  This game has given me some hope again and i think the team will at least be able to come out the relegation spot if they continue to play like that."
Cloud9,3c56ka,dalearny,4,Sat Jul 4 22:17:03 2015 UTC,dont think ill ever understand the fizz pick with every top laner except rumble/naut taking. Would have loved a shen pick but gnar/mao/hecarim anything else woulda worked better imo
Cloud9,3c56ka,PM_ME_LUX_HENTAI,7,Sat Jul 4 22:11:28 2015 UTC,"The fizz pick did work this game, he just got greedy with his build and was pretty squishy in team fights"
Cloud9,3c56ka,Bloodtotem193,-4,Sat Jul 4 22:13:08 2015 UTC,The fizz did not work.  The fizz pick made teamfights almost impossible to win.
Cloud9,3c56ka,dalearny,8,Sat Jul 4 22:14:19 2015 UTC,They weren't trying to win teamfights with that comp....
Cloud9,3c56ka,Bloodtotem193,2,Sat Jul 4 22:18:40 2015 UTC,"I disagree, i think the team comp that TL had was just a really good counter to C9s comp as a whole and they showed it by blowing them up in the teamfights. The fizz pick worked for what they were trying to do with the split pushing."
Cloud9,3c56ka,Pedarsen,2,Sat Jul 4 22:18:46 2015 UTC,This current meta favors teamfighting over split pushing.  A gnar or even hec would've still had split pushing power and would still be able to teamfight. Even if Balls had built more tanky.  Corki and Yasuo are to mobile to be killed as well as the about of peel they had.
Cloud9,3c56ka,II_Shwin_II,2,Sat Jul 4 22:24:22 2015 UTC,"Hecarim i agree with, but not Gnar. Gnar is more of a teamfighter than a split pusher because he doesnt normally build Triforce. Hecarim on the other hand would have done a great job but there was probably a reason they did not pick it up."
Cloud9,3c56ka,richc3,2,Sat Jul 4 22:27:52 2015 UTC,"The Fizz pick is good, he just shoudn't have went for the Blade. Trinity > tank is much better and he died too fast."

Overall though, REALLY impressed with early game and just felt like after one choke around baron compounded into more and let TL back in."

Cloud9,3c56ka,OmegaApple,8,Sat Jul 4 22:13:37 2015 UTC,"I hate when people say this about these guys, particularly about balls, roughly half the bans against c9 all season have been against Balls, dude demands respect and has dominated his lane the past few games. Recently it hasn't translated into wins but it's more the teams fault than his."
Cloud9,3c56ka,XTartarusX,6,Sat Jul 4 22:26:25 2015 UTC,"Guy up until recently was undefeated on rumble, drawing many bans. He has been (maybe not this game but for the most part)  destroying team fights with fizz. What game are these people watching.   Hai only just found out he was playing Thursday evening, this game really shouldn't have been close as they had no time to prepare and the team showed up. Nothing about this game deserves a witch hunt."
Cloud9,3c4f6b,XUlquiorras,5,Sat Jul 4 17:57:53 2015 UTC,I thought I could handle a rocky split from cloud9 but the collapse that has happened.. I'll be a c9 fan until the end but if they get relegated any motivation I had to watch lcs will be gone. I hope cloud9 can fix this team

IMO it needs to be a good Jungle player who will be able to shotcall because Balls, Lemon, Sneaky, and Incarnati0n are all players who are really good at following a good shotcaller without hesitation."
Cloud9,3c57na,Bloodtotem193,2,Sat Jul 4 22:25:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not so much.  Now Balls is playing like a Bronzie.  How does a pro overextend without even so much as a single ward?  He died twice to not having a clue what was going on with the map.  And Incarnation stomps lane so that he can ... farm harder.  Hai played fine, but not better than Meteos - and the worst thing in this last game was the shotcall to take the 4v5 fight.  That threw the game.  Lemonation seems completely donezo.  He's depressed.  Saying he's retiring is not a joke.  I can't imagine he has any interest in dealing with this ""coach"" another game.  And yeah, Charlie.  This dude is trash.  He has no idea what he's doing in p/b phase and he's certainly had zero impact in turning the solo queue hero Incarnation into a team player.  Relegations.  It's happening.

Cloud9,3c34uq,TheHardButton,3,Sat Jul 4 08:33:07 2015 UTC,"C9 fighting! In the last 4 matches vs CLG, Cloud9 has won them all, and Cloud9 just took two maps off the third best team in the world. However CLG beat the best team in the world on their best map, so it's obvious CLG isn't going to be a stomp, also they've had one extra day to see what C9 is doing and anti strat.  Hoping for a 2-0, I'm sure this lineup can do it too! :)"
Cloud9,3c34uq,Razgrizacez,2,Sat Jul 4 09:10:02 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely be interested to see what the veto looks like. There is no way Mirage gets played, so I wonder what CLG will go after for their map pick.   Also of note, we haven't played CLG since steel became their coach, who seems to have improved CLG's overall strategy massively.  Either way, it'll be a great match to watch! Fnatic v. VP is after our match as well, which should be a fun match to watch as a neutral observer."
Cloud9,3c34uq,Razgrizacez,2,Sat Jul 4 09:22:59 2015 UTC,"Copied from a csgo bet analysis. I agree with this.  The maps for this match will be picked by this format:  Team A Ban  Team B Ban  Team A Pick  Team B Pick  Team A Ban  Team B Ban  Last map is map 3  Here is what I'm expecting to see during the veto process    C9 Ban Mirage  CLG Ban Dust  C9 Pick Cache  CLG Pick Inferno  C9 Ban Overpass  CLG Ban Cobble  Last map is Train  These 2 play a lot of similar maps (dust, cache, train, Overpass), but here is my reasoning for these maps picks and bans.  C9 will ban mirage first. They don't really play it and it's CLG's best map.   CLG will the ban dust, because they haven't really been playing it much lately + their results haven't been that impressive + C9 are really good on dust.   C9 will then pick cache, and CLG will pick inferno. Both these maps are good for both teams, and both like to play it.   C9 will then ban overpass while CLG ban cobble. This could happen the other way around, but I feel like both teams would rather play train then any of these maps.  That leaves us with Cache, Inferno, and Train. I find it hard to see CLG winning on cache after watching C9 play on it. Even when skadoodle was under-performing they still beat nV on Cache, which is saying a lot. Inferno is CLG's best chance imo, and I do think that C9 will win train. I haven't seen CLG play train in a while, while C9 have looked very impressive on it. Overall I see this game going 2-0 or 2-1 for C9."
Cloud9,3c34uq,Razgrizacez,2,Sat Jul 4 09:33:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with this for the most part.  Cache seems to be the home map for C9 at this point, so I think they feel confident enough to pick it whenever it is available to them.  C9 has seen decent results in the NA leagues on Inferno, but got absolutely smashed by EnvyUs on it during Gfinity. Add in to this CLG's proficiency on the map, it gives an advantage to them and high odds to take the map. One thing to note though is that the AWP is generally hard to use on Inferno T side. This could be an advantage for C9 since Skadoodle is less reliant on the AWP than jdm.  I think CLG will be more inclined to ban Train with their second ban. C9 seems to be really strong on Train and I don't think CLG will want to risk playing them on it due to their overall lack of good results on the map. I think C9 will know this and ban Cobble, since they don't seem all that practiced on it. That would leave Overpass as the final map. C9 seems to have a good grasp on how to play Overpass, they just lacked the execution when they played VP the other day. C9 could have easily had a 10-5 T half against VP. I do not have any info on how well CLG has done on this map, but I think C9 would have a strong chance to pull this map off.  I'd predict a 2-1 for C9 with wins on Cache and Overpass and a loss on Inferno."
Cloud9,3c34uq,IreliasMyWaifu,2,Sat Jul 4 09:53:59 2015 UTC,"C9 would start CT-side on Inferno, because CLG would have picked the map, so maybe they could pull it off if they have a strong CT side. (Looking at C9 vs EnvyUs)"
Cloud9,3c34uq,Razgrizacez,2,Sat Jul 4 10:01:55 2015 UTC,Also a good point and something I forgot. Could be a 2-0 if that is how it plays out. So stoked for this series to happen!

Cloud9,3c34uq,gamestar_21,3,Sat Jul 4 17:28:59 2015 UTC,"So who would we rather face in grands, fnatic or vp? Cause fnatic is fnatic but vp also usually beats us."
Cloud9,3c56vc,dalearny,5,Sat Jul 4 22:13:18 2015 UTC,"While I haven't been a fan of their pick ban lately, today was totally fine. The team wasn't built for teamfighting, it was built for split pushing and map pressure, and was the perfect counter to a team like Liquid that really wants to teamfight you since they're good at it. If they just executed a little better in the late game they would've won."
Cloud9,3c56vc,TheN1temare,5,Sat Jul 4 22:38:11 2015 UTC,100% agree. Seems like everyone just wants to make pick/ban complaint after every game.
Cloud9,3c56vc,Pedarsen,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:08:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly, their p/b gets a lot of flack, but a lot of times it's the execution that is lacking. The problem for C9 was they had a lead and they thought they could take a teamfight even though their comp was weaker for it(and were obviously wrong). I think mistakes like that stem from the fact C9 has been struggling a lot and up until that fight C9 were back in their old form. They were out rotating and trading better objectives. The players probably got caught up in all the excitement of finally doing as well as they could and made some cocky calls."
Cloud9,3c56vc,1237239879334,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:10:42 2015 UTC,Honestly... I liked this pick ban phase. IF the shotcalling and pick ban were this good all split... We would be 7/5
Cloud9,3c26aw,II_Shwin_II,8,Sat Jul 4 01:52:04 2015 UTC,"I worry about the League team. Hai is back, but the meta has shifted, and the shot-calling early game has changed a reasonable amount as well. He has shown in the past that when he can tilt, and when that happens the shot-calling tilts as well. I just am concerned they may throw 3 jungle bans out, first pick a jungler, and then focus Hai on an unfamiliar champ in an unfamiliar position when he wasn't expecting to be playing. I really am not confident that this is going to be an improvement off the bat. Meteos may end up having really screwed C9 depending on how the rest of this split plays out... But I also believe Hai can step up, and the pressure is on! Go Hai!"
Cloud9,3c26aw,PM_ME_THE_BEST_STORY,3,Sat Jul 4 03:56:57 2015 UTC,"Thinking on it from Hai's point of view, I would expect him to be prepared to play a pocket pick for exactly that reason."

Cloud9,3bytvw,sabrius,3,Fri Jul 3 20:43:39 2015 UTC,Worried that they're losing two bans because of this according to the lolesports Twitter. I hope that doesn't trip them up too much.   ETA: link
Cloud9,3bytvw,Tu2,3,Fri Jul 3 07:21:50 2015 UTC,What if they are bringing Hai back to see if it's all about shotcalling?
Cloud9,3bytvw,Pedarsen,5,Fri Jul 3 07:39:20 2015 UTC,"Sneaky was just talking on stream about how the lineup with Incarnati0n hasn't really ""clicked"" and Hai was such an outgoing shotcaller who knew what he wanted to do and how there's really nobody to fill that void.  Idk how this opinion will go over here, but I think if C9 had picked up Link instead of Incarnati0n, they'd be 2nd or 3rd right now."
Cloud9,3bytvw,Steelersfanmw2,4,Fri Jul 3 08:21:33 2015 UTC,This seems a bit weird in the prospective of hais wrist injury... Did it miraculously heal or did they lie about it being a problem...  So either it's a short term move or either they made up the story so they could bring in incarnation
Cloud9,3bytvw,landoindisguise,6,Fri Jul 3 13:57:38 2015 UTC,"I think his problems are still there. His problem was not beeing able to play at all it was not beeing able to effectivly play multiple games in succession. After a bo3 he would be hurting and probably the contant straing on his wrists daily was bad for him.  The wrist problems wasn't the sole reason for him retireing, probably a defining factor but i think Hai knew something had to change."

Cloud9,3bytvw,Aiendar1,6,Fri Jul 3 07:07:48 2015 UTC,"What could have happened?   Well it was bjerg that spilled the beans that metoes left.  He was talking to Dyrus and said something along the lines of ""yeah meteos just randomly left""  So I'm assuming that C9 and TSM were having a scrim session today, and the scrim was going extremely poorly for C9. This coupled with how C9's season has gone so far pushed Meteos over the edge.  Just a hypothesis.   I'm sure we'll get more info tomorrow morning."

Cloud9,3bytvw,ventsol,3,Fri Jul 3 12:24:15 2015 UTC,"this has to be temporary.if any of you think hai jungling is the long term solution to the team problems, well u are just flat out wrong. This team needs to sort it's shit out this off season. This is getting ridiculous. Real roster changes need to be made that think of the future not just the now. The only people that should be untouchable are Sneaky and incarnati0n, the rest of the spots should be fair game and some extensive tryouts need to be held. Just my opinion."
Cloud9,3bytvw,bakadaragon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:31:03 2015 UTC,Ofc Hai isn't going to go in as a permanent jungler. That would be stupid because of his retirement. They either need to fix things with meteos or start thinking about getting in someone that can shotcall properly.
Cloud9,3bytvw,Aftert1me,2,Fri Jul 3 14:30:26 2015 UTC,"Not only because of Hai's retirement, but his reasons for retiring. I mean, the guy literally can't  play as much League as he needs to."

Cloud9,3bytvw,Squirrelschaser,3,Fri Jul 3 08:43:09 2015 UTC,"Why would they swap a new player that's hunger to proove that he's one of best and want to carry them? Yes Meteos was heart of C9 but he was holding (not only one) back the teams progress in terms of adaptation and that was pretty clear in the Thorins interview. It's probably best for the team, but we have yet to see..."
Cloud9,3bytvw,K0R0I0Z,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:53:01 2015 UTC,"I actually think swapping out Meteos instead of Inc was a good idea. If you saw the interview, it was pretty clear that their styles were not and will not work together unless someone changes. Incarnati0n is new and has the hunger. He clearly wanted more midlane focused gameplay and was confident he could be among the best if he got it. With the way things were going, I don't think C9 would have even made playoffs."
Cloud9,3bytvw,MCXI,2,Fri Jul 3 09:01:06 2015 UTC,"But swapping Meteos for Hai fixed nothing long term and is dubious short term. Swapping Incarnation for Hai at least pretty much guarantees that C9 sees some revival of their former self, even if it's just in confidence of having their successful roster back.  Sneaky seemed pretty dammed pessimistic at the end of his stream. A donor said he's hoping they can knock off TL, to which Sneaky said it was doubtful.   Fuck, man."
Cloud9,3bytvw,C9Superfan,2,Fri Jul 3 09:13:40 2015 UTC,"Swapping Incarnation for Hai at least pretty much guarantees that C9 sees some revival of their former self, even if it's just in confidence of having their successful roster back.   That's not really even guarenteed at this point. Hai hasn't been playing competitively for half a split now, and midlane is way harder to play than jungle if you're out of practice. Plus, we know that Hai makes great calls and is a weak laner, so maybe jungle will work out better for him AND the team, since we'd get to see how Incarnati0n plays with focus on his lane.   Keeping Meteos fixes nothing short-term or longterm unless he changes his jungling style, which I doubt he would. Plus, this is all assuming that C9 benched Meteos themself, and he didn't just leave after getting frustrated."
Cloud9,3bytvw,xxh2p,2,Fri Jul 3 09:22:02 2015 UTC,"Back In season 2 and early 3, pre meteos, hai was the jungler"
Cloud9,3bytvw,Razgrizacez,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:46:53 2015 UTC,"Swapping Meteos with Hai fixes everything. Meteos just 24/7 powerfarms all day with absolutely no lane pressure whatsoever.  Hai is selfless and very aggressive player, so he'll definitely gank more. Meteos is ass at shotcalling. Hai is a beast at shotcalling.  There was disagreement within the team and certain team members (most likely Meteos, as he is one of the more vocal members of the team and also known to have disagreed with Hai in the past about a jungler's role) loss faith in Hai's ability to shotcall. Now, Meteos is not on the team anymore and Hai is.  Hai's wrist injury inhibits in mechanically but jungling is less mechnically intensive than playing mid.  This is honestly the best swap that can happen, and I have thought about this possibility ever since C9 has started shitting the bed. I hope C9 tries out this roster extensively."

Cloud9,3bytvw,kripis,-1,Fri Jul 3 08:19:58 2015 UTC,"I really wish we could just go back to the C9 lineup we all know. Incarnation is a gifted player who is a decent addition to C9, but I don't think it just works out as great as the old roster.   I really don't want to see Meteos leave, he was awesome. Hai leaving already brought me down as the roster I know and loved was never going to be the same. This isn't any better to me. It seemed that even before when they were having issues, they still kept together and pressed on. I don't know what's happening this time."
Cloud9,3bytvw,PershingSt,2,Fri Jul 3 12:37:29 2015 UTC,True fans don't leave after a roster swap and a (seemingly) temporary substitution. As long as the last player from the C9 Golden Age is still around I will support C9
Cloud9,3bytvw,MLSxDumpster,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:37:24 2015 UTC,"Well I will too but I support them because I love all the players of the team. Even if some leave, I'll stay a C9 fan, but the less of the originals there are, the less of I'll really care.   I didn't like C9 because they were good, or because they were popular in NA. I liked them because the players were some of the coolest I've seen. I also liked them because C9 always seemed to have a bond much stronger than most other teams. Like you had actual friends playing together, not just teammates."
Cloud9,3bytvw,blitzKriegzzz,-1,Fri Jul 3 17:41:52 2015 UTC,"I hope Meteos comes back, what kind of person would he be if he forced Hai to have no hands for the rest of his life...  And another thing, no one should be forcing him to shotcall on his own. Everyone on this team is really timid, and it's really unfortunate that he has to shotcall for the first time under the stress of making wrong decisions. Everyone should be helping him out, shouting ideas or whatever for him to get a final pick in.  This is extremely unfortunate that Hai is basically being forced to play again, can we not be like an attached ex-girlfriend?"

Cloud9,3bzysa,ObamaAteMyChicken,3,Fri Jul 3 19:13:23 2015 UTC,"Hai is temporary, his wrists are still injured. He was forced to play because he was listed as a sub. There's no way this is actually good in the long run. We'll still have the same problems when Hai leaves again. I agree that it was too much for Meteos with the whole shot-calling thing and that he couldn't focus on his own play it seemed, but we just lost a super-star player and now have an injured Hai who is only temporary."
Cloud9,3bzysa,Shirkmortality,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:18:50 2015 UTC,"How long is somebody a star player though ? When he left he was not a start player. C9 with Meteos seemed like Gambit in 2014 Summer, absolutely lost, and you wouldn't called Diamond a super star player by any means."
Cloud9,3bzysa,akim1026,2,Fri Jul 3 19:20:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said. Meteos looks like a completely different player this split and has seemingly gone from king of the highlight reels to an insignificant advantage. There seems to be the lack of backbone,  confusion in team fights,  and unnatural feel of his play not adapting to the new meta champions. (Meteos Elise were the days) I also don't like Charlie...at all"
Cloud9,3bzysa,thezaitseb,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:32:55 2015 UTC,Regarding item 2 though if they want to win worlds they will need a mechanically strong jungler though

Cloud9,3bzysa,LuCactus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:21:54 2015 UTC,Also I would add that Charlie gets help back in picks and bans. I would imagine Hai (in his controlling nature) was able to advice Charlie into what kind of comp they needed to win against certain picks the other team was throwing out.
Cloud9,3c22j9,Mendezdude13,5,Sat Jul 4 01:14:39 2015 UTC,"I mean we'll never know what happened unless someone comes out and says it, and I think that is not really how c9 has been.   Could it have been a player on the team? Yes. Could it have been someone else, like Charlie or Hai (who might have been giving shotcalling advice?) or maybe a new coach? Yes.   The team was getting better then this week something changed and it seemingly escalated quickly.   I think  based on past interviews from Meteos and others on c9, when Hai made a call everyone just did it. Sometimes when 5 people listen to a 'bad call' together they can still come out ahead if they catch the other team off guard (as many people aren't anticipating a bad call to be made and won't have a plan to react perfectly). It sounds like this wasn't the case in the Meteos shotcalling era. I dunno how he could have done a decent job last split (in some games) and how he could have done decent at All-Stars but struggled more now. Did the team having a rocky start just tilt some people to tune Meteos out? Did Incarnati0n struggle to understand how to follow calls or ignore them? Did Charlie and Meteos disagree on ways to play the game? We really don't know. To me the team could have tried some more stuff (winning through early game comps just try it once please). I hope everything works out and there's no bad blood between the team and some of the players though.  We can speculate forever but it's probably for the best that we don't know. We don't need transparency, we're not running the team, we aren't paying the bills. We're here to support them and I think it's important to keep doing that as best we can."
Cloud9,3c22j9,thezaitseb,2,Sat Jul 4 01:27:14 2015 UTC,I think it's even weirder because they had link sub in at allstars and they did more or less pretty well. Something this split is happening.

Cloud9,3byzzk,brakeline,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:05:53 2015 UTC,"What you're suggesting is just throwing players around into different positions. And while they may have skills that compliment those areas they aren't actually trained.   To use an American football analogy, that's like telling the QB to coach, the right guard to go middle line backer and the wide receiver to play running back. They all have physical skills that might help them in those positions but it's unlikely to go well."
Cloud9,3byzzk,gingerfr0,0,Fri Jul 3 19:55:08 2015 UTC,"Don't compare fisical prowess with mechanical and with knowhow. The support plays a more macro/intelectual game that hai already proved he can do. Some of the top supports are good because they make plays, the majority of the others are good because they establish vision and provide map assistance. In this case, even if a so-so support, would provide the shotcalling the team needs while retaining one that is arguably top2 jungler in na. As I said the best actual supports are former carrys and I only know one former top mid going jungle and he's not doing terrible well at it   Oh, and Btw, for much that I like lemon... He isn't that great of a mechanical support either"
Cloud9,3byzzk,brakeline,-17,Fri Jul 3 20:49:49 2015 UTC,"Jack made a bad call to go with a rookie over veteran LCS players like Alex Ich or even POB , now they are paying for it ..."
Cloud9,3byzzk,PershingSt,13,Fri Jul 3 08:46:27 2015 UTC,but that really isn't the issue here
Cloud9,3byzzk,BoogerHD,-7,Fri Jul 3 08:49:24 2015 UTC,Looks like it has created a major issue here . . .
Cloud9,3byzzk,PershingSt,9,Fri Jul 3 09:18:36 2015 UTC,"except that incarnati0n has very little to do with this issue here. The people at cloud 9 had made it clear that they weren't looking for a shotcaller and that Meteos would take over that role. While incarnati0n hasn't been incredible, he's played decent enough and has shown improvement. The issue here is that Meteos just couldn't shotcall at the level that the team needed."
Cloud9,3byzzk,BoogerHD,-8,Fri Jul 3 09:32:17 2015 UTC,"Incarnation was supposed to actually win lane too but that doesn't happen either , whatever Jack made the incorrect replacement choice period."
Cloud9,3byzzk,PershingSt,5,Fri Jul 3 09:59:22 2015 UTC,"That's not Incarnati0n though, he still has the play making style, but LCS is a different place and if he wants to do that Cloud 9 has to adapt to him. Problem is, the team, and Meteos especially, are not adapting to their new midlaner which forces Incarnati0n  to be far more passive than he otherwise would be."
Cloud9,3byzzk,Mysterlina,-3,Fri Jul 3 13:35:11 2015 UTC,"Ya since all the other great mids are playing assassins, oh wait no they are not everyone is playing poke.  Just admit kid is not very good !"
Cloud9,3byzzk,PershingSt,2,Fri Jul 3 16:51:28 2015 UTC,"In some of their recent games, he has literally been the only one who has been out-csing his matchup. He knows how to position and doesn't lack the mechanical skill to outplay his opponent. I don't understand how you can say he's not very good."
Cloud9,3byzzk,ParanoiaComplex,-2,Fri Jul 3 17:44:09 2015 UTC,You are watching different games and maybe you should re check that math . . .
Cloud9,3byzzk,PershingSt,3,Fri Jul 3 18:49:41 2015 UTC,Incarnati0n isn't the problem. The team wasn't clicking and apparently meteos was a big part of it. Seriously read up on the situation before commenting  besides Meteos has been underperforming a fuck ton since the start of the SEASON. Hes not the same jungler as he was in s4 or s3
Cloud9,3byzzk,frizzykid,2,Fri Jul 3 15:21:49 2015 UTC,Are you a headless fucking chicken? Because you sound like one...
Cloud9,3byzzk,ininjalol,-4,Fri Jul 3 11:54:31 2015 UTC,"I'm confused by the downvotes.  Bringing in a rookie and just forcing a shotcaller that isn't natural is the problem, without question."
Cloud9,3byzzk,Geofferic,3,Fri Jul 3 09:20:36 2015 UTC,"because Meteos wasn't meshing well with the team. Performance wasn't the only problem here.    Incarnati0n is a huge step for c9 to return to how they were in s3 and s4 because they can turn incarnati0n into the player they want him to be because hes never played professionally and doesnt really have a set playstyle.  imagine a midlaner like pobelter is a pile of clay. Now throughout his time on teams like Curse or EG he was molded into a statue. Now when clay dries you can't really mold it anymore. He has adapted a certain play style and it is very difficult to change it  Now we look at Incarnati0n, who is a brand new pile of clay right out of the arts and crafts store. C9 can take this clay and morph it into whatever they want, and when it solidifies he will be exactly what c9 wants.    Its going to take time for incarnati0n to get to where he needs to be, c9 said that when incarnati0n joined they weren't going to do well, they expected to probably be around the middle of the standings, there have obviously been a fuck ton of other problems going on within the team as well such as some problems with people working together (As stated by sneaky during his stream)   The problem isn't incarnati0n. Hes just a new player that C9 is trying to turn into a decent one.   Meteos has been underperforming since the end of season 4. The stats are all infront of us on lolesports. If hes underperforming and not working well with the team, it only makes sense to dump him"
Cloud9,3byzzk,frizzykid,-2,Fri Jul 3 15:30:20 2015 UTC,"METEOS wasn't meshing well?  He was for years.  This is bullshit.  Incarnation, the toxic law breaking solo queue hero who has not been worth his salary is what's changed."
Cloud9,3byzzk,Geofferic,2,Fri Jul 3 16:06:29 2015 UTC,No hai leaving is what changed. Had nothing to do with incarnati0n coming in
Cloud9,3byzzk,frizzykid,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:52:41 2015 UTC,You make no sense.  It's as if the actual events aren't real for you.
Cloud9,3byzzk,Geofferic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:30:04 2015 UTC,I guarantee any midlaner that came to c9 the team would have had the same team problems
Cloud9,3byzzk,frizzykid,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:43:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because Alex Ich or Bjergsen (eg) don't have more shot-calling experience than Meteos or Incarnation.  That's just demonstrably false.  There are mids out there who would have been a better fit than Incarnation.  Hell, Pepiinero would be a big improvement."
Cloud9,3byzzk,Geofferic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:52:56 2015 UTC,"God, do you really think thats all that matters?  Hai's personality helped hold the team together. He was extremely outgoing and was a friend to everyone on the team. C9 is the only team I can think of besides maybe OG or FNC that all the members of the team are actually really good friends and not just team mates."
Cloud9,3byzzk,frizzykid,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:09:00 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think that's all that mattered, but it's completely illogical to believe that Meteos was an important and impactful member of the team until Hai left.    Bringing in a substandard replacement for Hai is the problem.  Trying to force Meteos into a roll he's not comfortable with is the problem."
Cloud9,3byzzk,Geofferic,-10,Fri Jul 3 23:19:39 2015 UTC,Truth is hard people get mad ...
Cloud9,3byzzk,PershingSt,4,Fri Jul 3 09:29:11 2015 UTC,Your logic doesn't make sense. You bring your veteran mid in and they still get stomped because they have no shot calling.

Cloud9,3c11xe,LuckMaker,2,Fri Jul 3 20:01:55 2015 UTC,I think that one thing that you are overlooking in who you want to jungle is that we need a shotcaller. I don't know how many of the players listed are shotcallers but I know that Dom doesn't do all the shotcalling and also to others suggesting that we get hard from c9t the problem is that he doesn't shotcall despite being a very good jungler
Cloud9,3c11xe,gamestar_21,3,Fri Jul 3 23:33:57 2015 UTC,You would really trade Meteos for fucking Air and Kikis? I'm so glad you're not the owner of C9. Santorin doesn't do anything but wait for Bjergsen to get ganked and hes there to save the day. How about we just rebuild the roster and not put Meteos in a position to fail.
Cloud9,3c11xe,ObamaAteMyChicken,2,Fri Jul 3 20:20:42 2015 UTC,"People need to stop looking at Meteos as this ""godlike jungler who can never be replaced"". He isn't, and never was."
Cloud9,3c11xe,multres,3,Fri Jul 3 21:53:01 2015 UTC,"LOL, he fell off cause he has to shotcall a team that doesn't know what the fuck they're doing. It takes away from his overall skill. You're in denial if you think he is easily replaceable."
Cloud9,3c11xe,ObamaAteMyChicken,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:23:28 2015 UTC,He was a really strong junler who was ahead of is peers most of the time. He has been since he joined the LCS back in Season 3. The issue this split was that he was put into position that required more than he could do and that hurt his gameplay.  I think if we put him back on the team we need to make sure we have someone else to shotcall because Meteos isnt suited for it.
Cloud9,3c11xe,Bloodtotem193,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:09:36 2015 UTC,"They'll probably get Hard as a sub. He shotcalls for C9T, and is already the best Jungler in Challenger. The only reason I'm hesitant on this, is what they're gonna do with C9T, as Hard plays a vital role there."

Cloud9,3bv9gu,ruskininja,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:04:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely something that they need to work on, but for now, it looks like they know it's a weakness, so they're just playing it smart on ecos and saving fully until they can figure it out.  I think it's pretty smart realizing their biggest weakness atm and just sidestepping it in a big tournament and working on it elsewhere."

Cloud9,3bvlxp,Razgrizacez,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:45:10 2015 UTC,"VP played well. At least many of the rounds were close. Also, the last few times I have seen C9 play overpass, it was not so hot."
Cloud9,3bvlxp,Ace_Machine,2,Thu Jul 2 20:23:57 2015 UTC,"That first half could have easily been 10-5 C9 instead of 10-5 VP. So many close late round situations that were lost and we were close to breaking their economy on multiple occasions. Overall a pretty good performance, imo.  Jordan seemed a little lost based on what I heard listening to the POV stream. Just gotta iron those things out.   On the bright side, Freak seems to be playing pretty well."
Cloud9,3bu833,TheHardButton,4,Thu Jul 2 04:50:59 2015 UTC,"Their showing at GFinity was pretty good, if both shroud and skadoodle show up, this game could be ours!  Also note it's a best of 1, which always has the highest chance of an upset (in favor of C9) GET HYPED!"

Cloud9,3bu833,MCXI,2,Thu Jul 2 12:58:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they knew exactly how to handle those A pushes from Envy in the later rounds of the game. Ska was anchoring A site so well too with the AWP."

Cloud9,3bq168,xxh2p,7,Wed Jul 1 05:50:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting, he just mentioned that he would consider leaving c9 if they get relegated."
Cloud9,3bq168,Pedarsen,3,Wed Jul 1 06:17:46 2015 UTC,I think that if that would happen then most of them (Probably not Incarnati0n) would at least think about that seeing as it would be a good time to do it and let C9 rebuild in challenger with maybe some other players. Really would depend on how hard they then got relegated. If it looks like they have a chance to come back strong or if it's just hopeless as it is.  Ofc i'm not thinking they will be relegated and i think they just need time right now. :)
Cloud9,3bq168,kaijinbe,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:42:15 2015 UTC,Sure. We all known that. Esport players have a very short competitive play time in compare to real sport. Its just natural for them to move on. They have to make money too.
Cloud9,3bq168,damonsloverr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:50:12 2015 UTC,"You'd think I'd be shocked to hear it, but its been a pretty bad first half of the summer split that I'm not even phased by it. I hate the thought of it, but I think we fans did not expect c9 to have such a hard time. We knew it would be difficult, for sure losing against the top teams, but to be so..indecisive in games and losing big leads to the weaker teams baffles us. I mean, I was one of the people who said not to worry that they would be at max top 4 or 5 by the end and probably have a good play off run, but now I just dont know. I mean I'll keep rooting for them until the split is over, but its not unrealistic for me to see them on the path to relegation if luck is not on their side. I really want them to pull through and I hope sneaky doesnt leave. I want to give them another split to prove that they can be top tier again, but they need more time than we realized and thats okay. Hard work and time can pay off eventually. Let's hope it does for them."

Cloud9,3bo1en,ryemcdev9,3,Tue Jun 30 21:17:33 2015 UTC,"Same boat as you guys, just wanted to put it up there. All I want is improvement and at least 7th place so that they can stay in the lcs. If not, it will be sad but I will still be there to support :D."

Cloud9,3bjnkz,Cptsaber44,4,Tue Jun 30 22:39:51 2015 UTC,"First of, sorry if my english is not the best, not my mother language...  Didn't want to make this a long post, but ended up like that trying to make a decent debate on the current C9.  Agree with you in something, C9 dont need to change members. But I think the main problem is in the pick and ban phase, not because of ""this pick is good and this is bad"" but when the pick and ban phase concludes, you should have a general idea of the teams strenghts, and I cant see C9 executing those...   For example: in last game (vs TIP) C9 had a Jinx and a Victor, which are really good in a long tf or pocking the enemy team, they also had a Rumble, that can help in initiation or disengage with his ult.   But THEN, C9 also picked Annie, after the enemy team had Alis + Siv + Lee (which together have a really strong initiation, Maokai was picked after, IIRC).  So at this point C9 had a really strong poking comp, with a strong initiation (which is not the best synergy in a comp orientated to poke).  Im not considering C9 order pick, with the exception of Annie, because I guess C9 went with a general idea of what they wanted to do and their carries in that game should have been either Jinx and Victor as how they picked, or maybe a team with a focus on assassination, as they had a noc, annie, and maybe they could have changed the last pick for an assassin.  Anyway I'm not really liking those P/B, they seem like a mumble jumble team without having a general strategy when going on stage.  Anyways, as all weeks I hope they win the next games, GG HF  Also, this is only my opinion as a player in a plat team, of course pro teams should know better the games than me, but again, this is only personal opinion."
Cloud9,3bjnkz,Lobolp,3,Mon Jun 29 20:44:25 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about language, it was good but even if it wasn't, it's easy to grasp understanding anyway :) I don't care about long posts, it makes it better to talk.   Yeah I'm not liking our P&B's 100%. I hate the Azir pick when they keep doing it. I think they didn't want to pick an assassin because they are completely out of the meta at the moment, even LB has fucked off because of nerfs."

Being objective includes levying criticism.  The reason it is out of place currently for C9 is their history of good performances and the recent roster changes. Expecting Incarnation to be a world-beater, ""second coming of Faker"", is so unrealistic. They need time to find themselves as a team then gel together. That's going to take more than a split."
Cloud9,3bjnkz,Lobolp,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:16:09 2015 UTC,Cloud 9 fans aren't used to losing. Maybe the whiners and winner pickers  can leave so the real fans can hang around and wait for the team to adapt.
Cloud9,3bjnkz,my_elo_is_potato,2,Tue Jun 30 03:07:10 2015 UTC,"Speaking seriously, all the post about what they are doing wrong or good, are because the followers (myself included) think C9 have the potential to win these games, but unfortunately the team is not winning.  You may see it as criticism or whatever, but you shouldnt see them as that, they are single fans hoping for they team to improve in what they think are the biggest mistakes the team is making, I dont think noone in C9 will worry about those comments, and if they do, they shouldnt because noone else than them knows what they need to do to win."
Cloud9,3bjnkz,theggthdoctor,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:55:24 2015 UTC,Armchair generals telling them what to do every other post isn't going to be better then them analyzing games. I'm sure they know what is going on better then us and don't need our opinions to improve.

Lemon isn't the issue, and people keep ignoring the fact that Hai can't exactly play due to his wrist injury. What C9 needs right now is a coach who can actually help the team during the pick and ban phase, instead of picking and banning whatever is in the meta right now."
Cloud9,3bjnkz,PershingSt,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:20:42 2015 UTC,People only want Hai to be the support for his shot calling without thinking about the mechanics behind it.

Saying that Sneaky's attitude is wrong for saying ""if we go to relegation"" is not right. These are the guys on the team and they need to be acutely aware of the position they are in right now, otherwise they can't improve and practice accordingly.  I'm a C9 fan and I really hope that we don't go to relegation, but quite frankly, if C9 don't improve, we will go to relegation and that's the cold hard truth. I have faith that C9 will improve, but it doesn't change the current situation."
Cloud9,3bl3i8,synackSA,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:23:49 2015 UTC,I don't think they need to be worrying about relegations though. It adds an unneeded amount of stress when we have a perfectly good chance of avoiding relegations all together.

I respect him and would love for him to stay on as an analyst but i dont think he really fits the Coach role.
Cloud9,3bl0k1,Bloodtotem193,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:08:08 2015 UTC,I want to see a real coaching staff under Cloud9. They've never needed one and now they have been far out paced by nearly every well established org in this area. Give them time and a staff they're comfortable and that team will find itself.

Teams such as C9, with good communication should have an advantage. Shoutcalling will be put to the test.  Patch 5.13 will be a game changer. AP items are getting massive changes, which will come into play in LCS Week 8/9. Also I have seen junglers soloing Baron with this new/changed jungle item. 5.13 will be very interesting. Team that can adopt the fastest will come ahead. C9 is one of the best analytical teams in the LCS, it will be an advantage for them.   Lastly I want to mention that C9 has 70 points already. It guarantees them a spot in the 3rd spot qualifier. No pressure. #IGotFaith"

Cloud9,3bk2iu,ItzzBlink,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:12:15 2015 UTC,The main issue is that C9 has ALWAYS played in a way that they usually get a little behind early. Now they just don't have a way to come back anymore.

While every sp grows stronger and stronger he basically stays the same if not worse. Just look how Bunnyfufuu alone keeps GV ahead. Mata gives the best example for the important of a worldclass sp and C9 just need a good one now. E: Ofc its not Lemon fault alone that C9 lose. I just say my opinion regard this point.

Cloud9,3bgv5f,StraightFomKILL,19,Mon Jun 29 02:48:32 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people think it's Hai's responsibility to fix C9. He have another job in the organization now. The LoL team has their own coach, analysts and its own infrastructure to improve itself. There are even hours of team comms from past game if they want to learn from what Hai used to do. Why is it his responsibility when C9 clearly have their own resources? He's retired. He even said himself that he doesn't want to coach. What's the point of forcing it on him? Is he not allowed to have a life beyond league of legends?"
Cloud9,3bgv5f,rinkaname,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:40:02 2015 UTC,"I agree that it isn't his responsibility to fix everything, but I would really like to see him being a bit more hands-on with the team. He certainly has knowledge that could help them out, at the very least something to help Incarnati0n get acclimated. Just my 2 cents though."
Cloud9,3bgv5f,Flamoctapus,5,Mon Jun 29 04:48:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I understand why people would want him to. I just find it really absurd that some people are talking about the situation as if he ""abandoned"" the team. They're not his children nor are they his responsibility. If he wants to help then he can, but it's not like he's a heartless bastard for wanting to do other things in life.  :/"
Cloud9,3bgv5f,rinkaname,10,Mon Jun 29 04:57:35 2015 UTC,I think swapping Hai with Charlie will help a lot. Charlie honestly doesn't seem to be to good with picks and bans. Maybe that's just me.
Cloud9,3bgv5f,slothninjaHD,3,Mon Jun 29 03:08:40 2015 UTC,Not going to happen. Hai is essentially moving back into an owner position as it was Hai who created the team and Jack still highly respects his opinion.
Cloud9,3bgv5f,Alcoholic_Satan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:07:15 2015 UTC,Yeah sadly. I'm fairly certain in saying I'm not the only one who thinks picks and band have been garbage this split
Cloud9,3bgv5f,slothninjaHD,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:31:30 2015 UTC,"If we can't adapt to change then we don't deserve to be in the LCS, it's fairly simple. Cloud 9, as much as I love them, needs to find their footing. They still don't have a full time coach. Charlie is primarily an analyst, not a coach. They need a coach and most likely a better support staff. There's no reason for this team to not be winning right now."
Cloud9,3bgv5f,Alcoholic_Satan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:07:24 2015 UTC,I thought it was Lemon who does picks and bans while Charlie is more-so just the final say -IF- other players contest Lemon's recommendations.

Cloud9,3bgv5f,slothninjaHD,5,Mon Jun 29 05:39:32 2015 UTC,"This is making me kinda mad so beware the oncoming rant.  Does anyone actually respect the opinions of any one who is complaining about Hai's decision? Not only have I heard mostly overwhelming support from the fan base, but anyone with half a brain can understand that C9's staff isn't just sitting on their asses. If you REALLY think that you know more than the players, analysts AND coaches about how to run a professional team then please make an official application to Jack. If you're not going to do that,  a) then keep cheering for the boys,   b) keep quiet  or  c) find a new team  sigh /rantoff  Edit. For the record I'm not mad at OP. He's allowed to get married now and was only asking questions."
Cloud9,3bgv5f,gingerfr0,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:27:34 2015 UTC,"TL;DR : People just can't move on.   If people really supported C9, they'll do it without hating on Hai. Hai is my favorite player in league, ever, and I respect his decision, even if it shook C9 a little bit (okay, maybe a lot). But that's the thing. They'll have bad games, but soon enough, they'll come back, and maybe they'll come back better than ever. Maybe that wouldn't have happened if Hai stayed. Maybe if Hai stayed, his wrists would just go worse, and he (and C9) will be in an even worse position than they are now."

Cloud9,3bgv5f,Vaynetek,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:10:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's Hai's resposibility to ""fix"" C9 but i truly hope he is helping them in some form. He and the rest of the gang are friends and i don't think he would want to leave them hanging when they are in such dire need for guidance. Hai is/was one of a kind when it comes to leadership and he has a lot of experience that any team would improve from.  I think we all just need to give it more time, like OP said. C9 will bleed for awhile, but hopefully when enough time has gone by C9 will rise again."
Cloud9,3bgv5f,Pedarsen,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:48:05 2015 UTC,"People don't like change I guess. Nobody has a reason to be mad at Hai. He's retired, he has no influence of what goes on with C9's results right now. People are flakking him for no reason. There is no logical or valid reason to hate on Hai."
Cloud9,3bgv5f,Alcoholic_Satan,0,Wed Jul 1 00:19:14 2015 UTC,"Cause his ability as a leader can put C9 at the top of the standings. Also, I'd like to point out that none of us want him back in the mid-lane, but we would rather have him at support. You put a stronger mechanical player in Incarnati0n at that role, and now you can have Hai's knowledge and shotcalling ability at the support position. There's a good chance the synergy would be back, Meteos could focus on being Meteos and Hai could shot-call the team to Worlds.  If his wrists are too injured to play, I understand, but if there is even a slight possibility he could return... I think he should come back. At the very least, he could be a coach for this team. I just think a lot of us are unhappy with how he's just not part of the team anymore in some way, and since they're failing, it brings up more questions as to why he isn't helping."
Cloud9,3bgv5f,ObamaAteMyChicken,2,Mon Jun 29 02:55:10 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's pretty easy to understand why he's not helping. He got a lot of community flack for his play, including by us, his fans. Not only that, but we know his teammates lost trust in him, which definitely played a role in his decision to step down. We also don't know what happened behind the scenes, and if he was also getting flack from the rest of his team or even just got frustrated that no one was listening to him anymore because his mechanics weren't up to par, it's no wonder he wouldn't jump at the opportunity to help out, especially since he said in his last interview that a little piece of him wanted to see the team fail a little without him. It's kinda unfair to force him to help out again after all that.   Of course, I could be dead wrong and there's other reasons. We may never know."
Cloud9,3bgv5f,Hartlock,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:50:17 2015 UTC,"The possibility they could be auto-relegated? TDK, T8, and NME could beat them easily if they play like this. Especially with only 8 games remaining. If Hai really cares about the team he brought into the LCS, he'll do something for the team."
Cloud9,3bgv5f,ObamaAteMyChicken,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:58:17 2015 UTC,"But that's the thing. IF he really cares anymore, which he may not if they played a hand in him stepping down. I don't pretend to know everything, so there could totally be other reasons or we could totally be getting an announcement that Hai is the new coach or replacing Lemon soon. I agree that something else needs to change before the end of the season, and I hope Hai plays a hand in it. I just don't know if he will or not."
Cloud9,3bgv5f,Hartlock,2,Mon Jun 29 04:07:33 2015 UTC,"If he doesn't... Well, I don't know if the roster will stay the same. You can almost guarantee that TSM or CLG will bid for Sneaky, Meteos, and maybe even Balls. If i'm not mistaken, all of their contracts expire after this split.  Edit: Not sure if they'd make an offer for Balls. Maybe if Dyrus decides to step down if they under-perform at worlds."
Cloud9,3bgv5f,ObamaAteMyChicken,0,Mon Jun 29 04:11:46 2015 UTC,"Hai was the backbone of C9. Now he's gone. C9 isn't doing so hot without their shotcaller, so everyone wants him back."

Last week everyone here was giving c9 flak for picking sivir over jinx, for picking azir, and not having Balls on a comfortable champion. Guess what? They drafted NOT-AZIR (it was banned), they drafted Rumble for balls (Which people were saying equaled a free-win for C9) and JINX. Needless to say, C9 got shitstomped, which proves the main problem is not ""bad pick/bans"" like most people here blamed c9's losses on."
Cloud9,3bfsmk,multres,3,Sun Jun 28 21:06:50 2015 UTC,The bad p/b was letting tip get sivir on the second round and picking noc instead of her. Tip who looks awful without sivir.
Cloud9,3bfsmk,goldman105,2,Mon Jun 29 02:03:29 2015 UTC,"You do know pick and ban isnt one sided, they gave TIP all comfort picks, there is no reason Ali should not be banned and Apollo should get Sivir when he plays two champions.  That being said C9 tried to save spell a lot, like in the gank on XWX that basically turned the tides of the game Incarnati0n didnt ult until after the turn around shockwave. Didn't level up gravity field when he knew they were going to come back for another gank, he could have easily got a 2-3 stun since there were 3 melee and possibly a revenge kill. Lemon flat out leaving sneaky when he had stun, and they had Balls willing to come, and then he was just relevant for a large part of the following fight."

We dont have coaches that oversee everything, instead coaches are just people who help out here and there and let the players make all of the major decisions. You dont see top teams in Korea and china doing this, they have the coaches who say, your playing this and this and this and get good.   As much as i hate to say it Reginald is the closest thing that NA has to this and its the whole reason TSM has been doing well over the past couple of splits. He has taken on the role of Leader and made decisions that have made his team better. Hai needs to either step up and start doing this or he needs to find someone who will for them."
Cloud9,3bfsmk,Slitted,-1,Sun Jun 28 21:29:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with your first paragraph, but   As much as i hate to say it Reginald     Why do you hate to say it? There hasn't been any animosity between C9 and TSM. In fact, they were almost like sister teams prior to expanding to other games.  Unless you meant that as a personal bias against Reginald."
Cloud9,3bfsmk,Bloodtotem193,2,Sun Jun 28 21:35:06 2015 UTC,"its a personal bias, i dont like reginald as a person. he seems like a straight up gankster wannabe asshole. But i never met him so theres that.  but as the owner of TSM he is one of the smartest people in NA. He IS the reason TSM is still relevant in esports. people think that Bjergsen is so good but if it wasnt for Reginald picking him up and showing him how to play in TSM then there wouldnt be a good TSM anymore."
Cloud9,3bfsmk,Slitted,0,Sun Jun 28 21:39:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree Reginald's support helped out Bjergsen a lot initially. It's also a reason why I find Hai's behavior odd. If he was just a player who got benched, then his actions could be reasoned for. But he's not just a player who got benched, he's also a co-owner of C9, and his inability to mature up and take the circumstances seriously is part of the reason this team is not improving.  Then again, a hands on approach could go well like TSM/Regi or it could end up as CLG/Hotshot situation where substantial progress is never made (although I like their chances this split)."
Cloud9,3bfsmk,Bloodtotem193,2,Sun Jun 28 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"The problem with Hotshot was that he wasnt hands on enough, he didnt push as hard as reginald did and it turned out badly. Atm we are heading in that direction and i really hope Hai sees that and starts making a move soon."
Cloud9,3bfsmk,CelticMyth,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:47:04 2015 UTC,I haven't been paying as much attention this split due to irl stuff but I really thought Hai would perform a role at least similar to Regi when he stepped down. That he's not is surprising to me. I would have at least expected him to help Meteos with shot calling.

But mid game they just dont have focus, dont known what to do and so on and got completely destroyed. To me it feel like they just play a solo queue game with 5 solo queue player. Strategy is a huge part of the game right now. I really dont known if Charlie doing a good job anymore.  And last thing for me. I like Sneaky but I dont like his Jinx, I cant remember a dominating game with Jinx, but I remember a lot of Lucian games. Even if Lucian is not OP now. Sneaky is super strong with him.

During hard times they usually bandwagon other teams. They basically have no real loyalty to the team, but still manage to get better seats than you at the game. Strangely they mysteriously vanish at the first sign of trouble.     Fair weather fan: ""OMG what a comeback! That was amazing!""  Regular fan: ""How would you know? You left right when Favre threw the pick six in the 2nd and if I recall you didn't even start rooting for Green Bay until 2 weeks ago.""  Fair weather fan: ""... GO PACK!""

Gota switch over to have something to brag about!""  Tbh with that attitude just support SKT since no matter who wins NALCS they aint guna beat that team from what ive seen."
Cloud9,3bfsmk,LoL_tillu,-5,Sun Jun 28 22:36:26 2015 UTC,yeh ofc im going to support the winning team why would i support a losing team? or a weak team and for skt i have always supported them and will continue to do as long as they have faker.

Cloud9,3bftpf,Delay559,10,Sun Jun 28 21:33:20 2015 UTC,"So... the early game was actually pretty decent, except that dive on incarnati0n. We kept it pretty even until 15 minutes. After that The whole team just seemed 1 to 2 seconds behind each other on the those mid dives where they messed up. Other than that, it was not too bad. Most of that was TiP just having more synergy and knowing how to snowball. Also, the draft was pretty shitty. TiP had so many comfort picks.  It was GOOD to see us try things in the early game."
Cloud9,3bftpf,Ace_Machine,3,Sun Jun 28 21:18:49 2015 UTC,"Relative to the last few weeks, I was impressed by our early game as well. We felt reasonably confident and aggressive, making plays we likely wouldn't have in the past -- we were matching TiP quite well and gold was even for awhile. Sadly, momentum shifted and afterwards everything after that just seemed to be all reactionary plays.  Like you, wasn't a fan of pick and ban as well."
Cloud9,3bftpf,richc3,4,Sun Jun 28 22:17:34 2015 UTC,"It doesn't help that TIP is really aggressive and will fight you no matter what, especially when you are behind."
Cloud9,3bftpf,Ace_Machine,5,Sun Jun 28 22:25:02 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to become numb to the losses. That's good, right? Honestly I don't see the team getting better with only 8 games remaining, we will definitely miss worlds this year unless a miracle happens. Hai returning to support would be the only thing that could probably fix this mess."
Cloud9,3bftpf,ObamaAteMyChicken,7,Sun Jun 28 21:17:20 2015 UTC,"You lift my spirit, and then you crush it again the next day. Had high hopes for today, but i guess the TDK win didn't change anything. :/  Not much to say about this game, just got outplayed like crazy. Maybe not go for Nocturne if you're either way going tank? There are better options. Rest of the picks were okay."
Cloud9,3bftpf,Pedarsen,4,Sun Jun 28 21:18:21 2015 UTC,"Here's my two cents. TiP is the worst opponent for C9 to face right now. Against a team with an issue of shot calling, an aggressive and decisive team will absolutely dominate especially with a comp like they had. They put up an effort to try and outagress them early but the one failed dive meant the rest of the game was kinda in the bag for TiP."
Cloud9,3bftpf,julioquasar,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:18:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly I think we will do the worst against TiP any day of the week. Reason being C9 currently has poor early game shotcalling against very aggressive play styles. C9 won against TSM because TSM played passively early. TiP never does. You can actually see how C9 does well when they are allowed a slower early game. I think C9 needs to try to slow the game down significantly and play to their strengths, an amazing team fighting team when not faced with a 5k+ gold deficit."

Azir, Viktor, Cassiopeia, and poke champs are the strongest mid lanes picks. Every mid around the world (except Faker) consistently play these champs."

Cloud9,3bftpf,Cptsaber44,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:20:10 2015 UTC,"So I'm convinced that Hai did all of C9's thinking for them. Can we have him back please? I mean not because Jensen is a bad player, but we just need him to actually be the smart one on this team and actually win them some damn games!"
Cloud9,3bftpf,Qant00AT,10,Sun Jun 28 21:14:51 2015 UTC,"Getting him back only solves things temporarily. His injuries will still affect him for the days to come.  To be honest, C9 should rear back and learn the shotcalling on one or more of the members. If that means taking a whole split to learn, it may be better in the long term and give a good roster."
Cloud9,3bftpf,Fushhy,-1,Sun Jun 28 21:17:02 2015 UTC,"But at least C9 would be playing like C9 again. I don't know who the fuck this current team is, but they sure as hell aren't Cloud 9. I don't care if we have to give the man robo wrists, this situation clearly shows that Hai was the complete brains of this operation. Their strategies are weak, their P/B's are horrendous, the way they play the game now is a complete slop fest. Hai needs to step in now, or step in more than he currently is, cause these five are at a complete loss without him."
Cloud9,3bftpf,Qant00AT,5,Sun Jun 28 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"TBH bringing hai back would be so bad long term like it would break the team IMO. Lets say, for arguments sake, we do bring hai back for the next few weeks. Some how the team works again even thought hai hasnt practiced for months with the team and we win games. Great. Now 3 weeks have passed and hais injuries are catching up, he cant practice as much and needs to take a break. Whos going to shotcall? Meteos? hell no. By brining hai back its a straight slap in the face that not only the other 4 players dont trust him but not even the C9 organization does, so meteos is done. Lemon and balls both said they cant, and sneaky probably cant either due to the nature of ADC. Incarnati0n being the new guy probably wouldent be better then we have now.  So even if brining hai back was an option, and even if by doing that he someone fits right back in with the team. Youd ruin meteos's confidence and would also ruin incarnati0ns since he got benched for a retired players esentialy fucking over the team long term in so many ways.  Could he come back as an analyzer or outside the game help to get them back on their feet? Sure. But i really really really think if he goes back into the game cloud 9 would never recover and theyd split."
Cloud9,3bftpf,Delay559,3,Sun Jun 28 21:27:41 2015 UTC,"That's a good argument and you're very much right. But sometimes you need to slap your players in the face. Look what TSM is doing with Turtle. They practically told him, ""Hey look.... we're gonna start actively looking for your replacement only five weeks into the split. But you can still try to keep your job if you want to."" Next game, Turtle goes lights out.  They gave him motivation to try harder and get better. Professional teams do it all the time. They sit players down and speak plain: Step up or get out and let the next guy do it. If they're motivated enough they work harder, get better, and excel. Otherwise they fizzle out and they trim the fat. Right now the team needs that or else... well we've already seen the results today.  So fine, Hai can stay at his cushy management position with the organization and just let the team crash and burn, or he can actually be a part of the team like he said he would and help them get their act together."
Cloud9,3bftpf,Qant00AT,2,Sun Jun 28 21:41:09 2015 UTC,"Do you really want Hai to really injure his wrists? I'd rather have him be an analyst/co-coach for the team.  Side note: P/B did look fairly better. Only real questionable pick was the Nocturne. If C9 didn't collapse early in the game, I feel we could've won..."
Cloud9,3bftpf,Ruler_of_Dunes,2,Sun Jun 28 21:17:55 2015 UTC,P/B was better? We quite literally handed impulse the best Bot lane in the game on a silver platter.
Cloud9,3bftpf,HeyItsBooger,3,Sun Jun 28 21:23:13 2015 UTC,We also handed them the one thing that completely shuts out Rumbles effectiveness in a team fight.

Cloud9,3bftpf,Amsement,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:18:41 2015 UTC,"That was simply demoralizing. Wouldn't want to be at the C9 house for the next few days.  Hai needs to sit down with the team and take them to school. It's easy to sit back relaxed and watch your old team get roasted without you, but it is absolutely apparent that Cloud9 simply cannot exist without Hai.  Shit needs to get fixed before morale falls even further than it already has. If this continues there may not even be a Cloud9 next split."

Cloud9,3bftpf,Aiendar1,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:23:00 2015 UTC,Just another game which C9 lose to shotcalling. It hurt to see that the team which almost always win a game with team fight now lose a game once team fighting started.
Cloud9,3bftpf,kaijinbe,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:23:43 2015 UTC,"C9 lost that game in pick/ban. Giving any team Sivir is questionable, but giving TIP Sivir is an especially bad idea. Giving TIP Sivir so that you can pick Nocturne in the first rotation? That's just insane."

Not saying good or bad, but when the team is lacking coordination a hard engager support ends up looking really bad, when a disengagin support can save the team from a bad positioning...   Overall, I think C9 performed way better when he picked Karma, but maybe Janna or Lulu, or even a more neutral like Morg/Tresh, could help the team to initiate when they need to, and not get initiated so bad...  Edit: Not mentioning Alistar because of the almost always ban, but also a good choice."
Cloud9,3bfve6,KayleOnly,10,Sun Jun 28 21:26:15 2015 UTC,"There are a few things to explain it  1: Bjergsen had some LCS experience before he joined TSM. I believe he played on CW in EU before he moved here.  2: Incarnation isnt a shotcaller for the team, Bjergsen is.   3: Bjergsen's transition was REALLY rough if you look back to his first split. Its not as bad as the current transition for Incarnation but it is also because of how bad NA was back then compared to how NA is now. A lot more teams know what they are doing other than 1 dominate team, which was C9 back when Bjergsen came over.  4: The teams as a whole is doing bad for C9 compared to how the TSM was doing back when Bjergsen move over. Not to mention the game is completely different now. Its a team game after all and there is only so much one player can do to carry."

Cloud9,3bfve6,sunstersun,-2,Tue Jun 30 06:07:02 2015 UTC,"Gotta disagree with TSM being weak they were 1st place in the regular season up until the last week. The league has def. gotten stronger and Bjergsen did have LCS experience which is a decent factor but Bjergsen didnt have the pressure of being a shotcaller until the Summer split, just thought how far C9 has dropped doesnt make sense to me. To go from 2nd place to 9th with the change of 1 player."
Cloud9,3bfve6,thezaitseb,3,Sun Jun 28 21:41:27 2015 UTC,"Bjergsen wasn't really doing that well in big games. He gets remembered for the Karma Penta but that was really only a possability because Xpecial brought them back into that game and series, they almost went out 0-2. Then CLG went full tilt and gave away game 3 before the teams even loaded in. After that series they went on to play c9 where Bjerg did pretty much nothing against Hai in all 3 games. It def wasn't flawless. Regi even played in a lot of games as a sub and TSM didn't miss a beat without him, remember reading some posts that if TSM was just going to keep losing to c9 why did they even make the roster swap. Things got better when they brought in a new jungler, kind of, but it wasn't really until Lustboy joined the team did TSM start to tower over the NA scene."

Cloud9,3bfve6,Delay559,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:25:03 2015 UTC,"you actually did say that it was nearly flawless which is the exact point that I am disputing. TSM wasn't  seen as a better team that split compared to the TSM that played in Fall 2013 (with Regi). TSM was 1-1 against CLG (with full rosters) and looked far from stellar against them in the playoffs, against C9 in the finals Bjerg did pretty much nothing (which is what Regi had done the split before). If you forgot, Bjerg had 2 kills in 3 games against Cloud9 in the finals. There isn't a lot of room to do worse then that, as Hai had 0 deaths in the series.  Follow that up with the next split when Gleeb and Amazing are playing TSM isn't even near the top of the standings, it's not until Lustboy's arrival that TSM started to take over NA LCS. Bjerg's move over from EU LCS wasn't an instant success, TSM had to replace 2 other players on the team to trigger the payoff, which is my point, Bjerg was brought in for the long term.  Did it go better then C9's roster move? Well yeah, pretty much the only roster move that seems to have ever been worse impact right away is Tabzz for Rekkless in the EU LCS."
Cloud9,3bfve6,Delay559,0,Mon Jun 29 05:51:51 2015 UTC,"1st place in a region with nothing but bad teams aside from 1 other team, which i dont believe they beat once that season, doesnt mean much. Not to mention there was NO mid lane pressure at all that season."
Cloud9,3bfve6,Bloodtotem193,6,Sun Jun 28 21:48:51 2015 UTC,"I just think C9 relied on hai a lot more then TSM did on regi, they have had hai for literaly years to tell them all what to do and be the brain/nexus of the team. Rip that out and throw them in the LCS with just a month of practice and clearly its not going so well."
Cloud9,3bfve6,PershingSt,-1,Sun Jun 28 21:30:21 2015 UTC,"not really sure, regi was pretty big for c9 especially when you consider the other players on the team at the time, also c9 seemed to do fine at allstars with link mid and meteos shotcalling, what was different from then vs now. The month of practice is a good point tho, im pretty sure TSM had from the end of worlds till the start of spring split to practice with Bjergsen.   That being said does it frustrate anyone knowing that C9 chose to go with incarnation when they said that they were having better scrim results with pobelter."

Been sticking with the C9 CS team since ESL One Cologne last year,  hoping they can beat tier 1 EU teams and win a major or place in the top 4 in an international tourney.  Also will not give up on this C9 League team that I watched from Summer Split 2013, I definitely think C9 has what it takes with this lineup to be a world's contender, they just need time and practice. I hope they take a split off of the LCS to compete in the Korean LCK or other leagues to get better, I want to see an NA team win Worlds. :)"

Cloud9,3bc528,rrrogan,5,Sat Jun 27 22:07:10 2015 UTC,Bruh. I have been watching league of legends NALCS for one year. The answer is clear. Meteoes just needs to make the right calls because it's super easy to do. And they need to get Sneaks on Vayne. The team only cares about Chipotle. They are obviously not trying to win.
Cloud9,3bc528,dalearny,-6,Sat Jun 27 22:38:11 2015 UTC,I'm not asking for domination I'm asking for change.  The team looks the same week to week.  I want to see some changes even if they don't win. I can't root for a team that makes the same mistakes over and over again without change.
Cloud9,3bc528,rrrogan,3,Sat Jun 27 22:37:21 2015 UTC,If they played everyday it would be a different story. Give it time. If they show zero improvement by the end of the split then it's time to worry.

Cloud9,3bdg9h,supergamerz,2,Fri Jul 3 17:11:26 2015 UTC,"The thing is Cloud9 has a big following of fans, more so than just the ones you see posting and typing negative comments. Go look at any organization that has many followers, there will always be the hardcore fans who stay positive and there will always be the fans who either hate and disagree with every change made to that organization, or freak out at the first sign of a sinking ship.  As far as the way Lemon's spotlight was, yea it did seem a little discerning but have you ever seen Lemon be really positive about anything? Go watch his after game interviews with Travis, whenever Travis ask if he has anything to say to his fans he always replies with a nope. Lemon has never really been like that, so don't take that as a sign for anything.  In a perfect world every C9 fan would be positive, accepting, and supportive of every change the team makes but that will never happen, some people just don't have the rationality. For all that we know, C9 could go through multiple roster changes before they ever get back to the top class team they once were.  The best thing a fan could do is always be supportive of your team in anyway that you can or would like to."

Cloud9,3bfwa2,Hameli0,14,Sun Jun 28 21:33:19 2015 UTC,"C9 needs to do what they have always done. Look to Korea. not in the literal sense of pulling players from there but in how they coach. They NEED a REAL coach. One who is willing to make the hard choices and tell people what they need to do. Too long have we let the players make all of the hard decisions and look where it has gotten us.  I love C9, their love for their fans and their semi-carefree attitude has been the reason i fell in love with the team. But if they really want to be back on top. Then they need to make some major changes, and it might completely change the team in the long run."
Cloud9,3bfwa2,Bloodtotem193,3,Sun Jun 28 21:44:56 2015 UTC,"I wanted to say that Lemon was kinda on par with some Korean coaches, but I thought it sounded waaaaay too cocky. I'm glad to see i'm not the only one thinking the same way about C9 coaching."
Cloud9,3bfwa2,Bloodtotem193,4,Sun Jun 28 21:48:11 2015 UTC,"Lemon would be an amazing analyst, and would be good for picks and bans, but he would not be a good coach in the sense that im talking about. He doesnt have the leadership attitude that i think we need in a coach."

He seemed to be getting shit done even when the team was behind. He may not have quas level consistency, but he has been  showing his colors these past few games"
Cloud9,3bfwa2,deejay7220,7,Mon Jun 29 05:55:34 2015 UTC,"Al right I'm getting tired of all the arm chair coaches on this sub. C9's  problems aren't top/jungle. Their only problem is lack of a DECISIVE shot caller. From the comm's alone you hear the lack of ""everyone do x, then y follow up with z"". That was hai's playstyle, he was basically micro managing 4 other players while he played and that was what made C9 such a dominating force. With his departure and without bringing in a shotcaller mid they needed to get someone else to step up as a shotcaller and that is Meteos. Now I'm not saying he's bad at shotcalling but he just doesn't have Hai's ""Do this now"", from the comm's it's more ""I think we can do x? Yeah let's do x"". I don't think that C9 actually needs to replace anyone as it won't make a noticeable difference overall, we just need a more confident shotcaller."
Cloud9,3bfwa2,Razgrizacez,2,Sun Jun 28 22:24:19 2015 UTC,"I would disagree and say that they have more underlying problems than their shotcalling jungler.   Pick ban phase? Why is Meteos on Nocturne? Why did you give Incarnati0n a scaling AP mage again? These are questions I ask when Cloud9 is playing vs another team. And it stems from Charlie, maybe his theory crafting is off, but I think we need to give Incarnati0n a reason to be feared. XWX picked Orianna with this comp, I don't see why C9 can't do the same thing, pick a high burst assassin to dominate the midlane, and try to help him if he gets ganked, build a team around a high engage comp like Sivir Naut, and just engage on them.  Yes, an in game problem is the shotcalling. I don't disagree, but it stems from the fact that C9 never gets ahead in lane, and feel pressured to make a play and then try to do crazy things that might not work like dive. If you start with snowballing one lane, the team can be immensely helped out, as the pressure is taken off of the other lanes. Sure they need to do team fights and call better, but it stems from a weak early game and not knowing what to do from behind mid and late game when you're behind so early."

Nocturne worked well with what they built to comp to do, they built it around engaging from long ranges. Nocturne ult into a flash Annie ult with Viktor and Jinx poke would have been impossible to deal with if they could have set up properly. Unfortunately TIP picked a really, really good comp to deal with this.  Incarnation was known for being a god on assassins because that was what was meta when he got banned. The meta mid's at the time were Zed, Ahri, LB, Fizz, Kass etc. and those were what he was known to play. Unfortunately the meta has shifted away from assassin's in competitive play and they don't work well in competitive anymore. If it were possible for C9 to run his meta high burst assassin champs then they would, I guarantee you that they aren't holding him off those champ for any reason they just don't win you competitive games anymore. They work wonders in solo queue but against team's with communication you aren't going to win."
Cloud9,3bfwa2,Razgrizacez,3,Sun Jun 28 23:11:37 2015 UTC,"I think these are the kind of threads that Lemon looks at and why his general demeanor is so negative or sad. C9 knows they're struggling, we don't need the idea of their fans wanting to replace all of their members to hinder their progress.   I know it seems like one step forward and two steps back when we lose a game that badly, but I don't think you can blame them. They seem to be practicing all they can, they just can't figure it out yet. And while a roster change might be good for a split or two, it would take a while for them to synergize better. Their lineup is fine, I just think they need to import more coaches so they can understand what to work on. Charlie seems lost, I think, and it's clear they don't have the perfect synergy, yes. But taking all of this away? Not a good idea in my book."
Cloud9,3bfwa2,Ace_Machine,3,Sun Jun 28 21:55:57 2015 UTC,"They expected this coming into the split. They will get better. Today's game was TiP know how to snowball and forcing teamfights against a team that was behind. None of that was c9 being bad, but, rather, TIP playing well."
Cloud9,3bfwa2,Razgrizacez,3,Sun Jun 28 22:02:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and that's why I'm confident in our team. They knew this would happen, and while it seems as bad as it is, Cloud9 isn't a team of bad players and dumb insight, as long as C9 can stick around in the LCS, or go to another league (maybe the LCK, because they were invited once), have no reason to believe they won't become a dominant team again.   It's definitely a struggle though, and I have faith in our boys to pull out some wins. I'd definitely wouldn't oppose the idea of more infrastructure though, to make the team synergy a lot better and somebody to help tell Meteos or Charlie how to fix their mistakes, as it seems to happen more often than not, which is why I think C9 is losing."
Cloud9,3bfwa2,Amsement,4,Sun Jun 28 22:07:29 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that everyone is trying to stay optimistic, but I'm certain that not even C9 expected to be 3-7 at week 5. The team looks lost in games like these and it's really really bad.   Consistently giving up power picks, losing picks and bans, and consistently being behind. Hai or no Hai, new shotcaller or not, you can't preform at a level like this.   The in-game performance will improve. But Cloud9's drafting problems have been present since last split. Sure there's always gonna be the ""Should'a banned Kass"" or ""Should'a banned Trist"" but stuff like that was rare.  I respect Charlie as a person because he is quite frankly a very nice guy and obviously very lovable, but he's not working out at all as their coach. C9 needs to pick up a coach. They need someone that's going to tell them what they're doing wrong, where they need to improve, and also show them what they're doing right. You want someone that the roster both respects as a superior, but also someone they can respect as a friend? Lemonnation seems perfect for that.   C9 tried to pick up Mata, but just like Dade, it didn't workout. Sneaky also said (according to Thooorin) that he could be a really dominant ADC with an aggressive support. So there are multiple positives of Lemon coaching the team.   While I don't think C9 is going to be able to pick it up this split, they should really use the off season as time to improve and make a lot of changes. Me personally would prefer Lemon being their coach, but if he still wants to play for the team I'm 100% supportive of that since he's not at all a huge problem for the team at the moment."
Cloud9,3bfwa2,Bloodtotem193,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:58:43 2015 UTC,"They need change, whether or not that is a roster change or a change in the support staff is up to them but something needs to happen NOW. its been long enough that they need to realize that what they are doing isnt working and they need something new to help them change that."
Cloud9,3bfwa2,Razgrizacez,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:06:20 2015 UTC,"I mean, sure, you can argue they need to drop their entire lineup and change to build the team around Sneaky, Meteos and Incarnati0n. I just don't think there's a world where this C9 doesn't stomp them without proper infrastructure. Sure the C9T team is doing well, but that's NA challenger level teams, look at TDK for an example of why the NA LCS is far better than the NA CS.   I'm all for adding more coaches. I'm not all for dropping this lineup. It's one thing to say C9's lost all mechanics and understanding of this game, but when you look at it, I don't think you can truly say they did. They want to win and to come back. That starts with adding more coaches and helping Charlie smooth out their P/B and helping Meteos get more confident in shotcalling, which I don't think they are doing enough of."

Cloud9,3bfwa2,Delay559,0,Sun Jun 28 22:44:03 2015 UTC,"So you like the brand/logo more than the team? I find it hard to do that, because Jack and Hai actually made C9 by themselves. It just seems like Hai, Meteos, Sneaky, Balls, and Lemon are C9. Them leaving would take away what makes C9 great."

Cloud9,3bfwa2,Bloodtotem193,3,Sun Jun 28 21:49:40 2015 UTC,Incarnati0n isn't the major issue. He's on the contrary getting better and the only one trying to do something right now.

Cloud9,3bfwa2,Bloodtotem193,3,Sun Jun 28 22:07:29 2015 UTC,"I dont think its his addition that caused the problem, rather the leaving of hai. I really think no matter who, alex/POB/incarnati0n/yusui it would be the same story. Hai is gone."
Cloud9,3bfwa2,PershingSt,-1,Sun Jun 28 22:29:46 2015 UTC,"but the difference between Incarnati0n and Pob/alex is that they have shotcalling that they can bring to the team where Incarnati0n can only bring his skill. Not to mention Incarnati0n had no prior professional experience playing while the other do. I just feel like his addition was brought on by the hype around him and not neccesarily because it was the best choice for the team.  but thats neither here or there, we need to focus on what is going to be done to fix the problem."
Cloud9,3bfwa2,tehcatsmiaw,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:51:41 2015 UTC,"They were pretty clear as to why they chose incarnati0n i dont know why your saying it was for the hype, they didnt want a shot caller so alex/POB being able to do that is completly useless since it was going to be meteos either way. They wanted a strong player, all 3 fit that. But most importantly they wanted something long term that they could form into a C9 mid and not someone that already has their style. Short term? yes POB or Alex probably woulda been better, long term we dont know and C9 are telling us incarnati0n is better. Time will tell but i have more faith in them then anyone else."

Cloud9,3bfwa2,PershingSt,3,Sun Jun 28 21:59:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know what games u'r watching if you see him losing lane every game. the only game he got outplayed was his fist lcs game vs tsm. in every other game he is ahead or even with his counterpart on the other team(which is something that never happened with hai). Jungle pressure and the other team doing better things than cloud 9 is what makes incarnation eventually seem like he lost lane. I'm not an expert, but as far as my eyes can see, the reason why they are losing games are mainly meteos, balls and lemon ( i think sneaky and incarnation are the only ones performing decent, not without mistake, but at least decent). 1st. I think balls should be replaced as he seems to be constantly underperforming. Just my opinion, take it with a grain of salt. 2nd. Lemon has to go as well, his individual skill is lacking and besides that i also see him making positioning mistakes and mechanical mistakes( i remember him faling at least 3 flashes in the final against tsm last split aka flashing away from sion ulti, but still in his path which made me facepalm). 3rd. I still think meteos is the most talented jungler from NA in terms of mechanics, but his playstile needs to change. He needs to learn to put pressure much more oftern on the opposing laners ( like he did vs TDK). Teams have gotten much better and you can no longer win by just powerfarming the jungle for the first 10 minutes. And also probably one of the thing i've seen in a few games that blows my mind to see at this level is HIM INVADING AND GETTING KILLED BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO VISION COVERAGE AND NO IDEEA WHERE MOST OF THE OTHER OPPOSING PLAYERS ARE. This happened today and it also happened in other games like the game he played Nunu ( i fotgot vs what team, i think it was TL but i might be wrong). So no more invading without vision coverage, play junglers that can put pressure on the opponents early (gragas, rek'sai, lee sin, j4) and also use them to actually gang ... 4th. and probably the biggest problem is their lack infrastructure( like monte said in a video). They need a better head coach (it's OBVIOUS to me, but maybe i'm wrong), hire analysts and assign them with different tasks to help the team (i'm pretty sure they don't have any, at least that i know of). I don't think these problems will be fixed this year and maybe players step up and replacing them is no longer needed after this split, but this is how i see things at the moment. I don't know about names to replace balls or lemon as the NA talent is really thin so they might need to look in other regions. Sorry for the long post."

Like i said before, jungler pressure and the other team doing things better than cloud 9 is what makes him seem like he is losing lane.

Cloud9,3b9juh,dalearny,3,Sat Jun 27 02:55:50 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt Hai would return. After the way we treated him? This sub, which is supposed to be filled with C9 supporters, mumbled pessimistically about him for months before he stepped down; and then, when Incarnati0n leaked, there was so much excitement. It was embarassing.  Anyway, especially now that he has a cushy job under an owner who adores him, I'd think Hai is enjoying how much less stressful his life can be working a more traditional job, bringing home a steady income."
Cloud9,3b9juh,idiotness,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:13:50 2015 UTC,Ya it was more of a joke/fantasy but c9 really needs a leader to step up.  If meteos doesnt shot call well then try some1 else.  I think Incarnation should be that leader.  He's fresh so even though he doesn't have much experience he will bring fresh air to the atmosphere. I could be wrong though.

Cloud 9 is struggling halfway through their first split without Hai. Even if this split ends up being a bad one Meteos and Sneaky wouldn't realistically leave after one split of struggles. From there contracts go for a whole calandar year so we are talking about 2 and a half splits before you have Sneaky and Meteos hypothetically leaving Cloud 9 for better offers. A lot can happen in that amount of time, clickbait much?  Thorin is good at being entertaining and this feels like one of his grand hyperbolies in text form."
Cloud9,3bchhg,INF_Ezay,16,Sat Jun 27 22:26:22 2015 UTC,Are people actually putting the losses on Incarnati0n?
Cloud9,3bchhg,funkosaurus,10,Sat Jun 27 23:11:09 2015 UTC,"It's really stupid honestly. If he didn't show up on Azir, fine they you can say he shouldn't pick it. However, Incarnati0n has shown up on Azir time and time again. It's not his fault that the team doesn't know how to follow up or chooses not to in general."
Cloud9,3bchhg,Amsement,3,Sat Jun 27 23:45:30 2015 UTC,"No people just don't like how we are doing in Azir comps. Theres a difference from disliking the champion, disliking the player, and disliking the comp with said champion.   Personally I think it's not helping us in Pick/Bans cause we give away so much to get it, and we havent established Incarnati0n on other champions that can draw bans (and some strong champions missing from our teams pool we are losing out on bans against top teams that can play them)."
Cloud9,3bchhg,thezaitseb,8,Sun Jun 28 04:18:09 2015 UTC,Except Incarnati0n on Azir hasn't been the reason for losses. He's actually played exceptionally well on Shurima.
Cloud9,3bchhg,MelGibsonDerp,2,Sun Jun 28 00:38:49 2015 UTC,"It's not that he's bad at playing Azir, it's bad when they don't fit a comp around it. Do you guys remember when he made all those plays with his ult, and then there was literally no damage to follow it up? Yeah, we had a Maokai, Sivir, Nidalee, Thresh... Just think how nasty it would've been with Jinx, Annie, Fizz, Sejuani."

Pretty soon they'll want him removed from the team, even though they aren't fans of C9 in the first place... He has a reason why he thinks that and no one on C9 really talked about it, so I believe its been one of their secrets they just don't talk about.  If you think about it, it was probably really common to help out your own region so they'd have the best chance of winning."

Looking back at the pick/bans.. I think Fnatic firstpicking Kassadin is surprising since it wasn't really firstpick worthy up to that point and C9 is not known for picking Kassadin.  It's possible Gambit had told Fnatic Hai had picked up Kassadin and was doing well with him in scrims.  Therefore Fnatic were ready to pick/ban Kass away (they banned 3 midlaners and picked Kassadin).  Of course, this is all speculation"

Cloud9,3ashvo,s7ev,4,Tue Jun 23 04:27:06 2015 UTC,"Plenty of international LANs coming up for the boys to test their mettle. Strong showing overall so far, though Liquid has been a bit of a challenge for us recently in league/tourney play."
Cloud9,3ashvo,TheHardButton,3,Tue Jun 23 04:34:49 2015 UTC,The new roster gave the team a true entry fragger and the best AWPer NA and gives them some balances carry potential
Cloud9,3ashvo,aztechunter,3,Tue Jun 23 14:30:19 2015 UTC,"Not only did the new players help out, but I feel the roster change helped cement solid roles.  Before Shazam, seangares was the dedicated AWPer on the team, with Shazam, he was playing support, and now he looks like he really is doing the lurk role well now.   With Hiko and Semphis playing lurk roles, seangares just was sort of there... Making calls but never having any impact individually, now that's different.  Definitely nowhere near the level of a lurk like Hiko, but if the whope team is comfortable with their roles, they'll go farther than having star power alone."

Cloud9,3arnzp,djanulis,21,Mon Jun 22 23:26:33 2015 UTC,"I am not too worried about worlds. I simply want them to improve. They are doing better than week one, but they still have a long ways to go."
Cloud9,3arnzp,Ace_Machine,14,Tue Jun 23 00:21:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, but with all the negative post around I wanted to make a positive one."
Cloud9,3arnzp,kaijinbe,3,Tue Jun 23 00:26:10 2015 UTC,They just need to take a place in playoff then win. Enough point for World. They wont win world but they will get alot of experience.
Cloud9,3arnzp,mathbandit,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:55:40 2015 UTC,It'll be tough for them to get to Worlds without going through the Gauntlet. It would require C9 to outperform TL and have TSM win Summer Split.
Cloud9,3arnzp,synackSA,3,Tue Jun 23 12:30:19 2015 UTC,"As much as I love C9, I would rather see a team go to worlds that has a chance to do well, so even though C9 has a chance to go, I would rather see TSM + Liquid/TiP/CLG go as there's a much better chance of those teams getting past the group stages."
Cloud9,3arnzp,mayank27tiwary,2,Wed Jun 24 16:00:31 2015 UTC,"Not TiP, I think they'd get annihilated at Worlds. Wouldn't mind ClG/TL/TSM"
Cloud9,3arnzp,yungnight705,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:37:56 2015 UTC,did you see how TSM performed and MSI? They're the reason EU thinks NA is trash. I think Liquid or CLG can make it but i don't think TSM can get past group stages based on what we saw at MSI. Just my opinion of course...
Cloud9,3arnzp,synackSA,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:13:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I suppose you might be right. When I look at Fnatic and at TSM, it just looks like Fnatic would steam roll them. I even think that OG and H2K would do well vs them. OG bot lane would steam roll TSM's."
Cloud9,3arnzp,yungnight705,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:19:16 2015 UTC,Yeah exactly. I really hope that whoever goes to worlds for NA performs well though. All I want to see is an NA team beat a Korean team or a Chinese team. I think it's possible but we'll have to see.
Cloud9,3arnzp,Shootix,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:24:00 2015 UTC,The only LCS team that will do well at worlds will be Fnatic. Any other LCS team will get smacked. Most promising NA being Liquid or CLG.
Cloud9,3arnzp,2ylo,2,Sat Jun 27 01:26:54 2015 UTC,"Trust me when i say: ""TSM vs C9 in playoff finals summer 2015"""
Cloud9,3arnzp,duremville,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:39:42 2015 UTC,I really don't want them at Worlds unless they are at least 3rd place this split.
Cloud9,3arnzp,Badbaseball,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:32:50 2015 UTC,"Here is the issue and I am sure most of you will agree. Going to worlds is a great achievement for any time but what good does it do if you are immediately expected to go no where in it? I mean at least the top western teams are expected to make it out of groups....  For example: C9 picks up their shotcalling and their gameplay overall and finishes 3rd at the end of the split barely squeezing through. Well guess what, that team that just finished 3rd gets destroyed at worlds.   Lets just wait and talk about the team actually improving first before talking about worlds. Remember that's months away."
Cloud9,3arnzp,dezzyezzy,0,Tue Jun 23 19:30:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I do not want them to make it to worlds. Why? Because even if they DID improve and they DID make it back to the top of NA,  will they really be ready for the competitiveness and experience of these Chinese and Korean teams? If they get demolished in worlds, it will be a HUGE blow to the team confidence.  They should just keep improving, find their team synergy again, work with what does work and what doesn't and keep Worlds as a last priority."
Cloud9,3arnzp,kaijinbe,6,Tue Jun 23 15:35:09 2015 UTC,"The reason why China/Korea team are so strong is because they play against strong opponent. Hide behind your region dont make you a better player or team. Confidence or not, even if you dont play vs China/Korea team, watching their game and you known you are behind or not. One a time C9 fight vs SKT (which was not even in their prime at that time), C9 known they still will lose but Hai said before the match that will be ok. They will learn from that and improve which they did."
Cloud9,3arnzp,GreyFox860,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:02:32 2015 UTC,Agreed. Best case scenario is they grind their way into playoffs and get a spot in Worlds. I like the fact that they'll play every region. Plus the boot camp for world's will expose Incarnation to the best midlaners in the world.
Cloud9,3arnzp,LtGaymer69,0,Tue Jun 23 19:21:34 2015 UTC,"ick, they would be the worst team at worlds if they don't improve by the end of the split"
Cloud9,3arnzp,MihoTheRipper,2,Tue Jun 23 00:14:36 2015 UTC,If they get to worlds wouldnt that mean they improved?
Cloud9,3arnzp,CertusAT,-1,Tue Jun 23 15:37:45 2015 UTC,"I do not want C9 at worlds, unless they improve tremendously (extremely unrealistic) they are gonna get their teeth kicked in.  I want to focus C9 on fixing a new problem every week, go in with the mindset of improving every week. They should focus on rebuilding and they should work towards next year."
Cloud9,3anf0s,Cptsaber44,12,Sun Jun 21 22:52:50 2015 UTC,"Just sucks how the season is turning out, here's to a better second half of the season"
Cloud9,3anf0s,Asentry_,5,Mon Jun 22 00:59:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm sure the team knew it would be difficult to replace Hai, but they can make it. I'm just glad they seemed pretty happy before the game (Sneaky seemed to be cracking jokes or something), so the team environment seems to be pretty good, which is obviously a must for good performance."
Cloud9,3anf0s,dardios,4,Mon Jun 22 02:02:42 2015 UTC,I think that fan vote at the beginning of the game proves we have faith...
Cloud9,3aoove,Badbaseball,3,Mon Jun 22 06:35:57 2015 UTC,"Well, when one team is the best in a region other teams will try to do same things to catch up with that team to get better. I think NA right now is not a weak region, just because they don't know which team is the best in NA yet so they're playing their own style. Like C9 and TSM: throwback when C9 was 1st in NA, TSM and C9 have scrimed each other a lot so TSM had some inprovements and more than that they beat C9 and became 1st in NA. NA's style was kinda like farm till 20 mins and fight but it doesn't work when you play vs other regions, because of that TSM was crushed at MSI. After that a lot of NA's teams try to change it so many matches looked so messy. About C9: they were the team that has better vision control, great objectives, and Hai's insane shotcall but now all C9 do are farm, get caught, lose dragon and lose team fight and shotcalls were so bad but I still have faith and hope they get bettter."
Cloud9,3aoove,QuinnDole,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:40:30 2015 UTC,It's got nothing to do with Hai leaving C9. It's just a coincidence that both things happened at the same time.  Hai affected C9 and that's about it. The fact that the games are decided by huge clusterfucky team fights is due to the current meta.
Cloud9,3aq3hh,jackieson13,4,Mon Jun 22 16:19:04 2015 UTC,"I think Lemon would be a great shotcaller, and Meteos seems like he just isnt comfortable with being the shotcaller"
Cloud9,3aq3hh,murpington,4,Mon Jun 22 16:36:50 2015 UTC,Lemon himself has said he wouldn't be a good shotcaller because he isn't decisive.
Cloud9,3aq3hh,rustrustrust,3,Mon Jun 22 16:41:05 2015 UTC,"My bad, didnt know Lemon had said that, but i just feel like Meteos cant do his thing when he is trying to shotcall at the same time"
Cloud9,3aq3hh,murpington,3,Mon Jun 22 16:44:49 2015 UTC,"While the shotcalling isn't up to snuff just yet, I'm not sure we've seen enough.  There has obviously been improvements in the last couple weeks.  It can really destroy a player's confidence mid split to remove shot calling duties."
Cloud9,3aq3hh,Androidconundrum,2,Mon Jun 22 17:05:14 2015 UTC,"I do think yesterday was better for him but his champion pool is messing with me, he is a gragas/sej god and they always used to revolve around teamfights"
Cloud9,3aq3hh,Delay559,2,Mon Jun 22 17:20:06 2015 UTC,"i would have loved to see him play sej this week, especially over nidalee as a double take away from dom."
Cloud9,3aq3hh,rrrogan,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:31:45 2015 UTC,I feel part of it is the pick/ban. By the time shot calling really matters they are so far behind.
Cloud9,3aq3hh,thezaitseb,3,Mon Jun 22 17:27:47 2015 UTC,"Meteos was doing fine shotcalling at All-Stars, I honestly think its the team comps."
Cloud9,3aq3hh,XstarD,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:49:15 2015 UTC,The Azir pick is not working. At all.
Cloud9,3aq3hh,kaijinbe,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:59:34 2015 UTC,I also think the shot calling roll doesnt fit meteos. It was shocking how low the reaction of the team was.
Cloud9,3aq3hh,ArcheronX,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:49:45 2015 UTC,It should be Incarnati0n running the shot calls but i think they should make lemon coach and find a support who can shotcall as there would be less pressure compared to other roles Example Yellowstar of FNC
Cloud9,3ancfp,Razgrizacez,27,Sun Jun 21 22:28:36 2015 UTC,"Oh look we picked Sivir and Azir again. Wow, lets just keep doing the same thing over and over."
Cloud9,3ancfp,thezaitseb,13,Sun Jun 21 22:29:21 2015 UTC,I saw the Azir and started screaming internally
Cloud9,3ancfp,102WOLFPACK,2,Sun Jun 21 22:34:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if Azir precisely is the problem. C9's problem with Azir is that he's not really a play-making mid laner. He throws down his turret, his dudes, and he zones the enemy, but he rarely can start or end fights singlehandedly. His damage is consistent, but not out of control. He has engage, but it's finnicky and risky. Azir is a champion that the rest of the team needs to babysit, and Cloud 9 has never really needed to babysit their mid laner like this. Even when Hai wasn't doing great, he rarely got much focus from Meteos. Meteos was either farming like hell, or camping the side lanes to help them recover/get ahead. Hai almost never had a CS lead by 12 minutes, but he almost never allowed the enemy laner to get out of control. Hai's midlane was the rock that the rest of the team balanced on.  Now you've got Incarnation, who is definitely a superior laner, but he's not as rock-solid. When he loses he loses badly, and when he's ahead, he doesn't support his team as much as he draws from them. They just can't keep going with this three-carry strategy between Meteos, Sneaky, and Incarnation. All three of them are weaker because of it."
Cloud9,3ancfp,Narokkurai,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:47:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like we just dont win when we play farm up champs, like our players play that style on their own. We need champions that can fight early to keep other teams from taking over via map pressure and if the other team doesn't respect us then they get punished."
Cloud9,3ancfp,thezaitseb,3,Mon Jun 22 02:53:45 2015 UTC,^
Cloud9,3ancfp,C9Superfan,18,Sun Jun 21 22:31:36 2015 UTC,Sivir and Azir are the two strongest picks in the meta right now. C9's draft was pretty good. The issue was Meteos and Lemon not taking advantage of Xmithie camping top.
Cloud9,3ancfp,ishmammahmud17,6,Sun Jun 21 22:34:17 2015 UTC,"What makes you think Sivir is? I don't see it. We need a hyper carry, because this team doesn't know how to dish out damage properly. Sneaky played Jinx against Team8 and crushed them, why stop playing it?"
Cloud9,3ancfp,ObamaAteMyChicken,3,Sun Jun 21 22:37:00 2015 UTC,"This. Sneaky and Incarnati0n have a wide variety of champions. You picked up a midlaner who has a wide variety of champions to replace your low-champion variety midlaner, and we've only seen him on four champions so far.  I want to see Charlie bring out the LeBlanc, Ahri, Corki, Lucian or any other damn champion besides Azir and Sivir, it's not working. Regardless, the fact that Incarnati0n is getting more confident and Cloud9 as a team are doing better shows me that they are improving, and will improve."
Cloud9,3ancfp,Delay559,5,Sun Jun 21 22:41:17 2015 UTC,"Sure they have deep champion pools but you also have to consider the meta, there is a reason ahri and lucian have either not been seen in many if any games and when they have been seen they get rekt. They are just not good in the meta. Although i agree it is kinda pointless to repeat the same comp over and over when it never works.  As aphro said after the game, C9 seems to just be copying other teams and not inovating which was a strenght they had before. They need to find that and hopefully sooner rather then later to start being succesful again."
Cloud9,3ancfp,Delay559,2,Sun Jun 21 22:49:02 2015 UTC,"If Cloud9 are just going to sit there and play Azir Sivir the rest of the split, I guarantee you they will lose all the way until week 9.  None of their lanes get ahead at all, and you can't expect to win when you're not ahead. If you put Incarnati0n on one of his best champion that is a good early/mid game presence, he can help other lanes and help Cloud9 win the rest of the game. I still don't see the reasoning behind putting him on AP mages that do nothing for the team.   And yes, I agree with the entire stick to the meta shtick. Cloud9 is known for that and they've been doing that. But when they found success with Hai, it was with a single target CC comp with Liss, Maokai, Vi and just a strong botlane from Lemon/Sneaky. I know the meta doesn't favor that, but when you're down 2-6 and you keep playing the same picks, something needs to change, and it all stems from this bad excuse of a pick-ban phase."
Cloud9,3ancfp,Wtangelo,2,Sun Jun 21 22:54:22 2015 UTC,"We cant lose all our games, we have to go against TDK again hueheuheuhe.  But seriously ya, our pick and ban is looking shaky especially yesterday with that awkward nidalle wierd comp. I still feel like putting incarnati0n on the now nerfed leblanc or now nerfed zed or the very weak ahri in this meta isnt going to help us at all. THose champions just are not good in this meta.  Something needs to change but i dont think its to do with mid, hes doing fine on azir i feel like its more bot lane and jungle focused. Switch out the sivir, and meteos for the love of god gank someoen before 20 mintues jesus."
Cloud9,3ancfp,Delay559,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:57:18 2015 UTC,"I'm just salty because they have this so called god of a midlaner who's been hyped up for his awesome mechanics, who's supposed to be the person that brings C9 to victory over the lackluster mechanics and low champion pool we had before.  Instead, we get him to play scaling AP mages and have him become passive-aggressive when it comes to teamfights, instead of his assassin, heavy burst AP mages he's used to. I just want to see one game where Charlie lets him pick whatever he wants, instead of Azir, and then I'll shut up.   Meteos is also a very farm-heavy jungler, he's stated that when they won before, he'd just farm up and their lanes would win, and they can't do that now at all. So, yes, I do want to see meteos switch it up, but this mid lane power of yours has to be a dominating force to help your team."
Cloud9,3ancfp,thezaitseb,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:02:04 2015 UTC,"The metas all well and good but when you've tried to play the meta and can't win, at least once give the man his comfort champs and see what happens. Zed wasn't meta when Hai played it and they took wins with it. Same with mid Kennen. The meta is great when it works but if you can't play it try something else. See r/unicornsoflove"
Cloud9,3ancfp,Delay559,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:30:26 2015 UTC,"I dont understand why everyone is assuming incarnati0n isnt comfortable on azir, sure hes KNOWN for the assassins but it doesnt mean hes uncomfortable on azir, the past few games hes looked strong. And comments from bjergsen saying in scrims/soloq incarnati0n is a strong azir player."
Cloud9,3ancfp,ishmammahmud17,2,Sun Jun 21 23:34:23 2015 UTC,Cause his winrates on it in SoloQ (and now LCS) are bad in comparison to his win rates on many other champions in the game.
Cloud9,3ancfp,thezaitseb,0,Sun Jun 21 23:47:45 2015 UTC,http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+jensen  LB has lower winrate then his Azir...
Cloud9,3ancfp,thezaitseb,2,Mon Jun 22 00:32:04 2015 UTC,Sivir and Khalista are the two of the highest contested picks in every region. Has been picked or banned in nearly every game in NA and EU for a reason. C9's comp this game didn't have enough peel for a jinx. Also Sneaky was down 30 cs in lane. If he was playing Jinx he would be completely useless in those mid game fights that C9 won.
Cloud9,3ancfp,Patata__alVapor,2,Sun Jun 21 22:43:02 2015 UTC,which mid game fight did c9 win? They had one 3 for 3 that kind of felt like a win cause they lost so many others. They took no objectives after any team fight except that 2nd dragon after the misclick from CLG.
Cloud9,3ancfp,ishmammahmud17,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:48:28 2015 UTC,Jinx is a much better pick in this comp. Imagine all those 3-4 man azir ults followed up with rockets...
Cloud9,3ancfp,Pedarsen,2,Sun Jun 21 22:41:45 2015 UTC,"There were so many opportunities for Sneaky to have used his rocket in those fights. CLG would have been dumpstered if they picked Jinx, I'm sure."
Cloud9,3ancfp,CertusAT,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:43:25 2015 UTC,"I realy don't get why Meteos and Incarnati0n didn't dive mid when Rek was top. Azir and Ekko can easily dive him, it doesn't matter if he sees them come, just dive him, put the aggro on Ekko and ult when you want the turret focus to change."
Cloud9,3ancfp,Delay559,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:27:48 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing. Lemon and Meteos should have dived immediately after Ekko hit level 6.
Cloud9,3ancfp,CertusAT,-1,Sun Jun 21 23:31:07 2015 UTC,But it actually worked fine today. I think mainly the problem today was the calls.
Cloud9,3ancfp,thezaitseb,4,Sun Jun 21 22:33:56 2015 UTC,"It worked fine if you ignore that they fell behind in CS, played a passive early game, and didn't really win any ""fair"" team fights. The only fight they really won was the one where CLG ran in to them for no reason after dragon. Everything else was either even or we lost."
Cloud9,3ancfp,Delay559,2,Sun Jun 21 22:39:01 2015 UTC,I mean to be fair the only person NOT to fall behind in CS was the Azir... although he was against a kogmaw >>
Cloud9,3ancfp,thezaitseb,3,Sun Jun 21 22:41:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, incarnation was up in CS...against a Kogmaw with a Azir. It's good that he did his job, but it's not really hard considering the matchup."
Cloud9,3ancfp,kroncw,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:43:53 2015 UTC,Going even against Kogmaw is pretty much losing. YOu can't provide better objective control late game then a Kog'maw that's farmed.
Cloud9,3ancfp,thezaitseb,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:42:53 2015 UTC,"He didnt go even, he was ahead in CS thats my point. But yes it was a kogmaw so it was expected but dont make it out to be worse then it was its not like POB was down only 5 CS or even."
Cloud9,3ancfp,kroncw,2,Sun Jun 21 22:46:45 2015 UTC,"it worked fine? Cause you know we lost every team fight except the one where their jungler misclicked and rode a tunnel halfway across the map from the rest of his team...  Sivir is super low range relative to the other ADC and pushing people around with a good Azir ult often makes it hard for her to position, not to mention she has little peel today, so azir pushing players into her is kind of risky..."
Cloud9,3ancfp,thezaitseb,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:39:21 2015 UTC,"Agree, Incarnation played really well on Azir today, went pretty close to turning teamfights around. Besides they needed a team comp that could exploit the immobile backline of CLG and Sivir helped complement that comp.   Still they definitely needed to work on mid-game rotations and team-coordination. Especially Meteos who really should step his game up."
Cloud9,3ancfp,kroncw,-1,Sun Jun 21 22:40:51 2015 UTC,"Watch every time he ults and watch how long it takes Sneaky to re-position. It's not a good combo. Jinx is tons better to play with an Azir, push multiple people together? Rocket time. Push one back to her? Mini-gun and bring on the resets...  Fizz flanked and even with speed boost Meteos didn't get to dive well without his flash...so the Sivir ult didn't really pay off. Also theres an item called Righteous Glory that would allow Meteos to speed boost on engage (and it would have been better then what he actually built 2nd)."
Cloud9,3ancfp,Slitted,3,Sun Jun 21 22:44:37 2015 UTC,"Sneaky might have been unwilling to play Jinx into an Ashe/Alistar combo with a Reksai jungler. Besides, C9's thought process might have been that unless Jinx could get a reset or Ecco/Fizz could kill the backline fast enough, Jinx might be a bit too vulnerable to Kog-maw's long range artillery.  I think the problem was that C9 expected to kill CLG's backline within the duration of Sivir's speedboost, but when that didnt work out, Sivir was left very vulnerable since the team already used most their spells and could offer very little peel/disengage."
Cloud9,3ancfp,thezaitseb,-1,Sun Jun 21 22:59:22 2015 UTC,"So there is no good pick for their best player and their plan didn't work, sooooooooooo their pick and ban is terrible, yep point proven all around."
Cloud9,3ancfp,Amsement,2,Sun Jun 21 23:45:06 2015 UTC,"Another big problem was Meteos's early game, during which he was unable to exploit Xmithie's focus on top and the Azir vs Kogmaw lane. He arguably could have at least set the Kogmaw much further behind but failed to do so. One has to keep in mind that when playing against a Kog, if you go even early game, you're very likely to lose the game."
Cloud9,3ancfp,Pedarsen,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:53:36 2015 UTC,"You're right about the offense capabilities of Jinx, but you're ignoring the fact that a Jinx pick would be eaten alive by Gnar and Rek'Sai and would force an early QSS buy for the Ashe arrow."
Cloud9,3ancfp,D-Hastes,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:49:00 2015 UTC,Oh yeah Sivir is a huge counter to 3 forms of CC....sighhh. At least Jinx has some peel for herself and can STAY further back at the start of fights.
Cloud9,3ancfp,Pedarsen,12,Sun Jun 21 22:52:50 2015 UTC,"You guys are salty we lost, but that was a hell of an improvement. Cloud 9 showed some considerable improvements this game especially over last game. This game actually gave me a lot of confidence for C9 to try and bounce back.  Granted I don't want to see them sacrifice inhibs for Dragon. Next time they should just have the dps and jg to take it down quickly then have the others back to defend the inhib."
Cloud9,3ancfp,D-Hastes,17,Sun Jun 21 22:39:13 2015 UTC,Waaaaay better game than yesterday. Some weird fights and decisions but overall an okay game.  Incarnati0n seemed more confident on Azir this time around and Balls did great on Fizz.
Cloud9,3ancfp,Pedarsen,7,Sun Jun 21 22:31:28 2015 UTC,This game gave me a LOT of confidence for the future. We have to remember that that was against the top team in the league right now and we put up a fight. Incarnation finally making some plays. I really hope they're starting to gel.
Cloud9,3ancfp,D-Hastes,2,Sun Jun 21 22:39:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, against any team other than TSM, CLG or TL this would have been way more in favor of C9 i think."
Cloud9,3ancfp,Slitted,4,Sun Jun 21 22:40:32 2015 UTC,"I could see a TL performance from C9 this split, barely making it into playoffs then getting 3d or 4th potentially putting them in reach of worlds."
Cloud9,3ancfp,thezaitseb,2,Sun Jun 21 22:49:51 2015 UTC,As long as that is achieved after playing good games i'm all for it! Just don't want them to barely getting it and then doing terrible.

Cloud9,3ancfp,Slitted,-1,Sun Jun 21 22:42:09 2015 UTC,"Being okay with losing to a top team, means you are okay with not being a top team. Sounds like something a CLG or Curse fan from last year... this team should not be okay with that kind of results."
Cloud9,3ancfp,kroncw,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:51:34 2015 UTC,"I think that at this point, after losing the best shotcaller in the west and one of the best in the world, it's ok to not be a top team if you're using that time to work towards becoming a top team again. If C9 became a top NA team in the first half of the first split with their new line up it would've been one of the most impressive things ever seen imo."
Cloud9,3ancfp,Amsement,-2,Mon Jun 22 00:11:42 2015 UTC,"Not really. NA is a bad region, if you made the move to compete at the Worlds Level you should expect to be able to be a top team in this region. If you aren't going to go after winning worlds then why even replace Hai? This move was made to compete against Koreans, not play Azir."
Cloud9,3ancfp,ObamaAteMyChicken,6,Mon Jun 22 00:42:04 2015 UTC,"It's ridiculous that Sneaky didn't use his scrying orb on the bush which lead to Lemon's death.  On the other hand, Jensen getting confidence and a good game.  I'd like to see the team do the Pick/Bans, or at least the Picks, themselves.   Edit: the comms during the later fights were eerily quiet (barring Meteos)."
Cloud9,3ancfp,landoindisguise,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:34:42 2015 UTC,I think Sneaky's orb was on cooldown but the team wanted to rush it because they feared losing baron?

CLG is about 2k ahead in global gold and they ahve a tower  Minute 16:30: fight developes on bot lane, junglers are bnoth there, tops port in and mid comes as well, C9 gets a kill on zion and gets a tower  CLG takes dragon at 17:50, absolutely uncontested. Balls is down 15cs, incarnation is up 20 cs and sneaky is down 30 cs.  Minute 21: C9 trys to get zion, failes but gets tower, Dlift gets bot Tower  Fight at 23, CLG trades 1 death for 2 kills and a tower, CLG was pushing mid tower, they have 4 towers dead to c9 3.  Minute 24 Dragon: C9 contests dragon and thanks to incarnations insane skills they trade 3 for 3 kills. Balls flanked Dlift perfectly Sneaky fucked that fight up big time, meele fighting zion....  C9, again, played a passive laneing early game and again got behind right away. The only laner who could keep up with the CS was Incarnation ( who actually got a cs advantage) but both Balls and Sneaky where down a considerable amount of cs (20+ at some points)  Meteos passive as fuck in the early game and the only reason they didn't outright lose the game was incarnations plays and balls very competent fizz plays this game.  That whole strategy that they tried to do with Fizz flanking and killing, yeah good idea...if you have FEED FIZZ who can actually do that dmg and get out, but no, he couldn't. Every time they did it didn't really, it somehow worked but not really and it got progressively worse as they fall behind farther and farther.  Good for us CLG threw so hard in that play hunting C9 down from dragon, but fear not CLG fans, C9 is still 8k~ gold down. Really no reason to further analyze this game, C9 is dead and will get choked out no problem from CLG.  C9 is not gonna make playoffs and they could even get relegated. They are still playing almost the same as in week 1, they still make the same mistakes every game. There are no improvements besides Incarnation who plays for some reason only scaling mages instead of the early/mid game dumpster mages he is known for."
Cloud9,3ancfp,CertusAT,6,Sun Jun 21 22:29:20 2015 UTC,"Sadly, at least T8 and TDK are doing poorly enough that C9 won't fall into auto-relegation, but still."

I'n not following T8 or TDK closely as I'm from EU and follow that scene pretty closely, so I can't say if they have shown any improvements at all.

Cloud9,3ancfp,CertusAT,3,Sun Jun 21 22:34:47 2015 UTC,"TDK is 0-8, and is still yet to have their full roster. Seraph, who the team was built around, is still hit or miss, and Kez looks lost at times, and takes too many kills from his laners.  T8 has Goldenglue subbing for Slooshi until further notice. Nien looks disappointing compared to Maplestreet. Calitrlolz looks to be tilting, and Porpoise looks just as lost as Kez when jungling. Dodo was never special.  C9 should be able to have a big enough gap to stay out of 10th."

Meteos was pulling a Santorin.    They chased too far in that last team fight which cost them.  incarnati0n and Balls looked good.
Cloud9,3ancfp,Bennyboozle,3,Sun Jun 21 22:39:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, the only reason C9 didn't get stomped harder was that Balls got those return kills on 2 of his 3 ganks. I simply can't fathom how meteos could ignore the toplane so much considering how integral a strong Fizz was to the game plan."

I wish they would just DO IT in the earlier parts of the game. :/"
Cloud9,3ancfp,NordischKatze,3,Sun Jun 21 22:36:29 2015 UTC,Actually was a much better game from C9. Incarnation also finally playing his style I am now cautiously optimistic.
Cloud9,3ancfp,Delay559,3,Sun Jun 21 22:42:56 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the hate for the sivir pick. The point of the pick wasn't for sneaky to play as the sole damage source, he was the set up to get to the immobile backline. The comp really required the fizz to get going, and because of the strong ganks focused at balls, that never happened."
Cloud9,3ancfp,hydrohydro,4,Sun Jun 21 23:38:24 2015 UTC,Actually this was a REALLY good game. Incarnati0n finally making plays. Playing really good actually.   Now what i would love to see it some early preasure from meteos. Cause his ganks are pretty late into the game.

Cloud9,3ancfp,ObamaAteMyChicken,2,Sun Jun 21 22:45:18 2015 UTC,Agreed. Have to sett reasonable expectations.
Cloud9,3ancfp,Choad_Warrior,-1,Sun Jun 21 22:46:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry I don't have such low aspirations for a team that has yet to place lower than 2nd place. ""avoiding relegation"" is a trap. 1. I doubt they would every go to the challenger scene and 2. I expect more than this from them. I have been a fan of C9 from the start. So excuse me if I don't set the bar that low from them. C9 was a world class team. This play is not acceptable. Being a fan, doesn't mean making excuses. It means supporting them yes, but also holding them accountable. They're making really bad choices, that the worst lol players can see. Bad trades, and poor rotations. Something needs to change. Anyone who says this was a good game isn't a real fan. Ask any of them right now. I can PROMISE no one on C9 would say, ""we played a good game"". Did they play better yes. Good. If that's good, they'll never avoid relegations. I guess I just have better standards."
Cloud9,3ancfp,Talos_the_Cat,2,Sun Jun 21 22:43:10 2015 UTC,"I guess so. I am happy to see improvements in the team i love, even though they are minor. Not saying this is was a good game, just saying i was way better than yesterday when they didn't do anything."
Cloud9,3aos29,gm4n22,3,Mon Jun 22 07:21:30 2015 UTC,"I really agree with the whole support staff thing, but do you really think having a good champ select will fix most of the problems?"
Cloud9,3aos29,Razgrizacez,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:22:06 2015 UTC,"I think I've stated this a lot. I'm so flabbergasted on why Charlie won't let Incarnati0n play LeBlanc, Zed, Yasuo, Ahri, Riven, or any of his signature champions. Instead, we get him to play scaling AP mages and have him become passive-aggressive when it comes to teamfights, instead of heavy burst assassins he's used to. I just want to see one game where Charlie lets him pick whatever he wants, instead of Azir, and then I'll shut up. Meteos is also a very farm-heavy jungler, he's stated that when they won before, he'd just farm up and their lanes would win, and they can't do that now at all.   We're 0-4 on using Azir, 1-1 on Kog'maw... We're not winning our lanes or vs the other snowballing AP mages, which is why we're losing most of these games. If you can't shut down a Kog or Azir with a kill or two during laning phase, it's going to be really hard in the late game. Putting Incarnati0n on a stronger champion is going to help them as it relieves the pressure on all of the other lanes which are even, and it will make Incarnati0n more confident in his plays and have a bigger presence."
Cloud9,3aos29,ArcheronX,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:05:26 2015 UTC,I think meteos is the problem. He has been consistently been hard farming the early game but does not put down proper vision for side lanes which leads to heavy ganks by the other jungler. This causes meteos to lose jungle pressure and his hard farming goes to trash. Then the shot calling during team fights is very subpar which leads to even more gold behind and a result 6 losses
Cloud9,3aos29,HopePrevail,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"What I think is, and I do hate to think this, but the shot-calling meteos is worse than when someone else calls the shots. I think it'd be good to bring in a good shot caller in a lane. That should help a little right?"
Cloud9,3aos29,Bloodtotem193,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:39:54 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe that if C9 are forced to play in relegations this split they won't make any changes. A change as huge as this one is going to take time, and the  offseason between this summer and next spring will be perfect for them to figure things out.  Worst case, they could even comfortably try out players during this period and still have plenty of time left to decide on a change with months to work with as opposed to a couple of weeks.  Pressure is at an all time high, we're looking worse than ever, but a change like this is LONG TERM. Good things will come, give it time."
Cloud9,3aova0,2ylo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:09:59 2015 UTC,"Losing hai shouldn't have hurt our pick ban to this extent, it feels like, hopefully it gets better."

Cloud9,3ao1au,thezaitseb,2,Mon Jun 22 02:57:38 2015 UTC,"You are right on Balls and Incarnation. Sneaky could be doing better but i feel like he's very team-oriented so if his team starts doing well, he'll get better as well.  The only person im worried about is Meteos. He used to be a top tier jungler but now with shotcalling duty on his hands, he hasn't been performing up to his same old standard anymore. He's the one that really need to step it up if C9 is to improve.  Edit: spelling"
Cloud9,3ao1au,kroncw,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:08:07 2015 UTC,Shotcalling takes a huge toll on you playing. you have a lot more that you have to think about and consider. Not to mention he is almost brand new to a lot of it.  I think given time he will begin to perform again but only time will tell.
Cloud9,3anm1z,thezaitseb,4,Sun Jun 21 23:57:48 2015 UTC,"Incarnation did well on Azir honestly, I can't be upset with how he is doing overall.   He tried to be a playmaker too. If only LoL had champions that could make it easier to do this on. Alas, clearly it doesn't. Let's hope Xerath next week goes well!  (Forgive me for sarcasm. Really bad weekend for all C9 teams minus Smite and thanks to C9 giving Pobelter so many points I lost my fantasy LCS week)"

Cloud9,3anm1z,XTartarusX,2,Mon Jun 22 19:39:04 2015 UTC,"Here's my problem with it. We lost picks and bans quite a bit towards the end of last split because our opponents didn't need to spend bans on the non-OP champs (non t1 champs), as Zed fell out of meta (far below t1 champ) the need to ban him disappeared and allowed teams more freedom against c9. This allowed them to target ban a certain lane to gain an advantage or take away a C9 advantage. While c9 was stuck with playing around the bans the other team wanted to use. In the finals c9 still tried to take over picks and bans and make them about the support position, but Lustboy was able to play Kennan and c9's plan backfired.  If you also look back into the time where c9 was back in last split winning more games they were getting opponents to spend bans on Lemon. Right now there are 2 supports that draw bans (Alistar and Bard) - Lemon doesn't play one of them so we're vulnerable there as well. If he played both we wouldn't need to ban either until our opponents showed their hand a bit, and worst case scenario he just gets whichever of the 2 supports is leftover.  So what we really need to do is to get Incarnation winning consistently on a champ that gets people to BAN it. We need someone to start forcing bans somewhere other then Balls on Rumble."
Cloud9,3anm1z,Slammin_Shaman,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:46:36 2015 UTC,"I think the comps they build around it are questionable, that being said I'd like to see incarnati0n on other champs even if he showed a lot of improvement on azir."
Cloud9,3anm1z,WrongWayBo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:57:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the team seems to do better when he is the one that initiates (similar to Hai), just based on the team fights that they've won. It would be nice to see him on a champ that blows up a priority target and to see if his mechanics were able to allow him to escape with his life to provide a ton of objective control."
Cloud9,3anm1z,kaijinbe,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:09:09 2015 UTC,I believe in an interview or something Incarnati0n said he likes to take charge of his lane and snowball with kills. Why not put him on Zed? Ahri? LB? TF? Where are the mids that allow him to move around the map and help the side lanes and get kills?
Cloud9,3alxcx,cbigs97,8,Sun Jun 21 14:49:53 2015 UTC,They'll bounce back eventually.  It'll take time to fill the void hai left.
Cloud9,3alxcx,rhiehn,3,Sun Jun 21 15:52:58 2015 UTC,It's amazing how big that is too. Everyone was giving him all kinds of grief and yet here we are struggling to keep it together. If not for his wrists I would still prefer him there. Hai for life.
Cloud9,3alxcx,brokenheartedsmile,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:09:06 2015 UTC,"If not for his wrist we would still be on top of NA, hands down.  If you look back they were one of if not the best teams in the west, and they were still not at their peak. I would definitely say they would be as strong if not stronger than Fnatic is right now."
Cloud9,3alxcx,Bloodtotem193,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:35:36 2015 UTC,I think they were at their best right before Hai's lung collapsed. We got better after that but it was never the same.
Cloud9,3alxcx,brokenheartedsmile,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:39:16 2015 UTC,"Well consider what might have happened if his lung didnt collapse, he would have gone to Paris, played against faker, come back, played against a Bjergson and XWX at their prime, and then gone to Worlds even stronger to play against the likes of Pawn, Dade, and some of the other strong mid laners there. the potential is crazy for what he could have become."
Cloud9,3alxcx,Bloodtotem193,8,Wed Jun 24 02:59:54 2015 UTC,"Well to be honest, I thought that once Hai stepped down he was still going to be involved with the LoL team and help coach Meteos and teach him how to shotcall. But it seems like he completely disassociated himself with the team, which was the completely wrong way to do it IMO."
Cloud9,3alxcx,DrSoap,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:29:37 2015 UTC,This right here. He should have stayed for the split to help them adjust. Felt like he left to soon.
Cloud9,3alxcx,ventsol,5,Sun Jun 21 19:11:34 2015 UTC,"That's completely unfair to him, he retired from the team, his job isn't to make the LoL team the best in the world, he's learning the management part right now, isn't he?"
Cloud9,3alxcx,Manlymysteriousman,2,Sun Jun 21 21:34:02 2015 UTC,He is still young and can learn the management part when he left the team in a good condition. It feels like he left the team broken.
Cloud9,3alxcx,ventsol,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:58:39 2015 UTC,"That's the team's dilemma to solve, you do understand their dynamic without him is different as well right? They don't play the same, and it's not like he can tell Meteos how to think about the game, purely because the way he and Meteos thought about the game was fundamentally different. There's no way that he can tell him that his way is better while retiring, let Hai do Hai things and let the C9 LoL team find their own new path."
Cloud9,3alxcx,Manlymysteriousman,2,Mon Jun 22 21:03:25 2015 UTC,"I'm being honest, I'm always going to love C9 - but I dont think without Hai, they can become a top tier team again. Meteos is trying to recreate Hai's shotcalling, but he's not like Hai, so its not working completely.  To help with this, they need a better coach, more analysts, more people to help them in these ways."
Cloud9,3alxcx,ItsDusk,4,Sun Jun 21 17:21:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed, coaches and analysts are very important in the modern Esports. Cloud9 got ahead of teams in the NA due to being able to adapt to the Koreans (Macro play and infrastructure). They are a talented bunch, but without the right support they can't really up their game. It seems as if they got no game plan before heading in to games. Someone in the supporting staff needs to push them on to be more proactive and create their chances."

And even if we go into relegation the top contenders are renegades and C9T. Considering even with our new roster C9 is doing very well vs C9T i dont see them dropping out of the league."

Cloud9,3apeh7,bolofoo,2,Mon Jun 22 23:28:23 2015 UTC,I think Charlie should be the analyst and Hai the coach. Yes this was suggested several times before but it's just the best option possible. Or at least let Lemon do the Pick/Ban Phase.
Cloud9,3apeh7,einbroot,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:34:16 2015 UTC,"Sneaky is one of the best ADC in NA. The loss are hardly his fault. C9 have to change with the time. To be world class you need to have world class player in every position. It would be bad to replace a good ADC just because you have a good Mid.  Imo Ball, Sneaky, Incar did well. Meteos is just a shadow of himself in some game. Lemon did ok like he always did. But Jungler and Support playing a great role in game. Even Faker lose lane if his jungler/sp doesnt support him well enough with gank and ward.  C9 player are good in team fight but not in mech. Time to put both things together. After 2 World we already known that just with one of this aspect you not gonna win anything."
Cloud9,3apeh7,kaijinbe,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:29:31 2015 UTC,If C9 gets relegated out of LCS ... C9T would probably make the LCS.  Team8 / TDK .. are still worse and C9 could probably beat out NME by the end of the split.  Also steelback is so overrated ..
Cloud9,3apeh7,blitzKriegzzz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:02:16 2015 UTC,"Steelback is bad, no. He wouldn't even be top 5 in NA, so he'd get shit on in lane most of the time. Why are we even having this conversation? We're not getting relegated and I doubt Meteos or Sneaky would leave C9 in the first place to join another team. I think they'd rather retire or go back to college."
Cloud9,3ak74h,Rozuem,17,Sun Jun 21 00:25:34 2015 UTC,"It's not that. It's that they're no longer showing any signs of improvement. They draft shitty team comps, lack objective control, and are on an overall tilt. I'm still going to support them as much as I normally do, but people on /r/lol are saying that we might be relegated: and the harsh truth is that with our nonexistent improvement, we might actually struggle to stay an LCS team"

My second fav team throws vs TSM and then I settle in to watch the C9 game and I get to watch them run around like they had their head cut off. I don't know what happened in pick and ban, but I feel like they were planning on picking up Jayce themselves, but go beaten to the punch and were simply out drafted... again. I'll support C9, all the way, but as a fan, I'm genuinely worried that we might get relegated at this point and I really don't want that. C9 as a team and I'm including the support staff here, need to step up and do it quickly. From the videos coming out of TSM and TL, I feel like they're miles ahead in how they approach things as a team, or at least that's how it seems from the outside."

So Hai is growing Cloud 9 in games other than just League of Legends, but man its still heartbreaking to see Cloud 9 perform so poorly without the shotcalling to back them up.  I doubt that Hai's shotcalling can be taught, and shotcalling does not correlate to coaching (Source: am a Coach), but I definetly would like to see the introduction of more coaching staff.

What really is hurting C9 is the shot calling, no doubt. In 2 of their last 3 games they have been out rotated mid-late game so hard, like today NME just rotated as 4/5 people to Top tier 2 and took it off C9 while they were still running across the map to get there. These type of hard out rotations were the sort you would get from CLG when they were in thier prime last split, but C9 is getting out rotated by NME is really worrying"

Getting a good team comp is so fucking important in LCS, and right now, it's all about team fight comps. Get the hyper carry Jinx, LeBlanc, Sejuani, Annie, Alistar, Braum or any champion that all the other teams are playing. Why is C9 trying to invent their own style and be the most stubborn team in NA. Surely one of the members have brains and think the same thing. Charlie is a moron if he's the one behind the picks.  Edit: They rolled over and died because they had no tools to win fights against NME. If you engage, you lose and if you don't, you straight up lose everything on the map."

Cloud9,3ak81r,Pedarsen,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:38:35 2015 UTC,"Sivir is for a team comp that wants the instant lock down engage. Maokai fits in with that style, but Nidalee? Wtf?

If they were seriously going to go for the poke/siege comp, with sivir kiting and mao for peel, I would have LOVED to see this team comp: Mao, Nid, Jayce, Sivir, Karma, poke all day, kite away with Sivir and Karama team speed ups."

If you pick the Jinx, you can get Meteos on Sejuani and the team comp works from there."

Cloud9,3ak81r,1vs1mebro,3,Sun Jun 21 00:36:16 2015 UTC,"Charlie is behind the pick and bans. It has now been 7 games of questionable drafting and they no longer come out of it with an advantage. When Lemon was in charge of it and when Hai was on the team, they almost always had the superior team comp. They played with Jinx last week and we've seen Meteos do really good with Sejuani, Gragas, Rek'Sai, it has worked before. To be honest, it seems like they're straying away from those comps after finding success with it."
Cloud9,3ak81r,ObamaAteMyChicken,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:15:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Nidalee pick was necessarily bad. The problem with Meteos on Nidalee today was that he played it so much differently competitively than he does in SoloQ. In SoloQ he's incredibly aggressive, and today he passive farmed for twenty minutes. I'm not exactly sure why...  But if we don't see Sneaky on Caitlyn and Incarnati0n on Ahri/Zed I'm going to have a stroke. C9 needs to start relying on some strong comfort picks instead of trying to force stupid 'meta' things like Azir.  If C9 can pull out a team comp like Balls on Gnar (or Hecarim or Rumble), Meteos on Gragas (or Sej or Rek or Zac), Incarnation on Ahri (or Zed or LeBlanc), Sneaky on Cait (or Jinx or Sivir), and Lemon on Morgana (or Naut or Janna) I can almost guarantee they'd be far more confident and ready to control the game."
Cloud9,3ak81r,Waygzh,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:47:09 2015 UTC,They need to have an aggressive play-style. Put Incarnati0n on assassins and let Meteos camp him or camp bot. They need to start dominating their lanes.
Cloud9,3ak81r,ObamaAteMyChicken,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:52:26 2015 UTC,"I updated my post quite a bit. The team comps I think C9 should be going for are a mix of what follows:  Balls: Gnar, Hecarim, Rumble  Meteos: Gragas, Sej, Rek  Incarnation: Ahri, Zed, LeBlanc  Sneaky: Cait, Jinx, Sivir  Lemon: Morgana, Naut, Janna  Stick to those picks and swap them out depending on lane matchups and bans and I think we'd be seeing a completely different C9 right now. Maybe things are going differently in scrims, but I certainly don't believe that Balls playing Mao, Incarnation playing Azir, and Lemon playing Thresh are anywhere near their comfortable picks."
Cloud9,3ak81r,Waygzh,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:05:01 2015 UTC,Those champions are being used by almost every other team. I don't know why we haven't used them by now. We can only hope they'll pick it tomorrow against CLG.

They really expect to rightous glory/sivir ult right into an annie/rumble/sej??  No locket built.  Tilt level over 9000  So painful to watch them in game because even when they were ahead in the beginning I knew they were going to lose becuase they were not playing as a team that wants to win.

Cloud9,3ak6l4,kripis,3,Sun Jun 21 00:22:15 2015 UTC,"Incarnati0n wasn't the problem, and he wasn't using his ult wrong. He was using it in the only way possible, except for pure disengage. If C9 had a long range ADC that could stand back and auto safely from behind bird ult, then he could use it more defensively to disrupt the opposing team mid engage. The problem is that Sivir having an auto attack range of 500 prevents her from doing damage if he does that."
Cloud9,3ak6l4,Aiendar1,2,Sun Jun 21 00:25:35 2015 UTC,They really need to start putting him on his more signature champions even if they don't fit entirely into this meta. Rather have him on something he's comfortable on untill he learns the meta champs properly.
Cloud9,3ak6l4,Pedarsen,3,Sun Jun 21 00:50:09 2015 UTC,"fuck the meta champs, look at hai, he was nowhere close to trying azir cause he knew he cant handle it and c9 were doing just fine even with that small champ pool of hai, incarnati0n is nowhere close to handling that champ either, atleast not at lcs level"
Cloud9,3ak6l4,kripis,3,Sun Jun 21 00:28:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah i agree. Hai's champion pool was hurting C9 but at the same time they did okay without him having to be able to play that many champions and they didn't force him to play something he was bad at.  Maybe Incarnati0n is playing way better in scrims? If so he's probably not used to LAN yet wich is really bad.  But again, have to take into account that Hai made up for everything by beeing probably one of the greates shot callers in the game."

And how is Nidalee useful in that. Also, why pick Sivir over Jinx... You JUST won last week with it and got insanely fed.

Cloud9,3ak6l4,TweetsInCommentsBot,3,Sun Jun 21 00:51:38 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think this game was lost in the first rotation of pick-ban. Obviously plenty of mistakes were made later, but the Nidalee pick was the biggest.    Just poking with spears is never going to win games in the current tanky meta, especially with her spear nerfs By picking her so early, they allowed NME to pick a team comp with both lockdown and poke, ensuring that Nidalee was never going to get anywhere near them in teamfights. By the end of pick/ban she was guaranteed to be basically useless as long as NME played fights correctly.    Total waste of a pick and completely out of place in the comp IMO. Obviously there are other problems too, but C9 is not going to win many games even with great rotations if their draft continues to be this bad.   I also really don't get why they don't let Incarnation play his best champs. Isn't the guy supposed to be a god on LeBlanc? She's a decent pick in the current meta, and she could have been useful against this NME team to quickly dive the backline and delete Jinx, Annie, or Jayce in teamfights. I really want to see Incarnation on a midlaner that's not a long-range DPS/poke mage like Azir or AP Kog. And I don't get why they keep picking these comps when they're losing in the LCS and (to hear Lemon tell it) in scrims as well. What's the harm in trying something new?"
Cloud9,3ak6l4,landoindisguise,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:51:47 2015 UTC,"You don't understand,  the coaching staff (aka the nonexistent one) is to balls deep with all the sponsors."
Cloud9,3ak6l4,Tominater85,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:54:00 2015 UTC,"These pick /bans have always been bad since Charlie took the reigns as coach. I think that if Lemon were more decisive about the pick/ban phase, Cloud9 would be a much more solid team. Or maybe even Incarnati0n wants to play Azir? Not sure why he wouldn't feel comfortable on LeBlanc or Yasuo, he's definitely better than most LCS laners on that champion. I'm hoping C9 can return to proper form, 6th place the dream right now."
Cloud9,3ak6l4,samsolo97,2,Sun Jun 21 00:58:48 2015 UTC,Dang. At this point I think C9 would be better off being relegated so they can hit the breaks and reorganize themselves. Of course that's only if the team would be willing to stick together through that.
Cloud9,3ak6l4,ThatQcSkinnyGuy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:03:19 2015 UTC,"I think many games this season start pretty well, and then following a single event everything crumbles. See the start of this game, they were making confident rotations and nice moves, I was thinking it was their game. Then it just seemed like everything fell apart after the first pause, like they lost momentum."
Cloud9,3ak6l4,magmavire,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:30:30 2015 UTC,"This isn't something I thought I'd ever say, but I think cloud 9 needs another roster swap. It's pretty clear that they need another great shot caller to get back to form, and I don't think anyone on the current roster fits the bill."
Cloud9,3ak6l4,C9Superfan,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:03:49 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say they don't need one. If you've seen Summoning Insight (the recent one), Cloud9 has had to make zero changes in their lineup, which is why they only have one coach we know of, Charlie. So they don't have the infrastructure built to familiarize another roster change, while a lot of other teams have had to make changes and constantly update their infrastructure by adding coaches and analysts. Yes, they need a good shotcaller. Who's to say Meteos won't be their dominant or near Hai's level in the next split? He's been thrust this role of responsibility and needs some guiding, and I don't think another Hai is going to show up in North America, not a chance."
Cloud9,3ak8mx,zeklol,6,Sun Jun 21 00:40:48 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that was over a season ago, when most other teams were really bad at pick/bans. It's not that Charlie is necessarily worse, its just that everyone else has gotten better, and C9 no longer has that unique advantage."
Cloud9,3ak8mx,shishkebob83,3,Sun Jun 21 01:10:07 2015 UTC,"I remember someone from C9 either 1 or 2 splits ago saying they dont want the players to have final say in the draft, having a coach have the final say reduces the conflict that can occur between players on a bad pick/ban"
Cloud9,3ak8mx,Anonymous157,2,Sun Jun 21 01:13:20 2015 UTC,Lemon is a smart guy but he is not decisive enough (from what i heard in his interview). He's a guy who suggests things but can't quite make up his mind in a heated situation. That's probably why he's ok with letting Charlie decide picks and bans.
Cloud9,3ak8mx,kroncw,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:52:06 2015 UTC,I thought they said he still does them but Charlie has the final word if they argue about what to take? I guess giving Lemon all the power would help.  Lemon has always had a good sense for the game.
Cloud9,3ak6nv,C9Superfan,13,Sun Jun 21 00:20:56 2015 UTC,"Why is Charlie a coach for this team? That has to be the shittiest team comp I've seen in a long time. Sivir, Nidalee, Maokai, Azir, Thresh? Where the fuck is the damage in that comp. You had a chance to pick a hyper carry like Jinx, LeBlanc was up, Alistar was available and Sejuani. Their team comp just doesn't make any sense and it's so frustrating to watch the team that use to be kings of NA, and the team that would always get the advantage in P/B's fall so hard.  Edit: Alistar was banned, my bad, but you can still pick Annie or Braum??? Hell, even Janna against that heavy engage comp."
Cloud9,3ak6nv,ObamaAteMyChicken,2,Sun Jun 21 00:24:05 2015 UTC,Alistar was banned by NME
Cloud9,3ak6nv,MrScruff95,2,Sun Jun 21 00:27:06 2015 UTC,"You and I have been criticizing Charlie for weeks. Every single game C9 seems to want to handicap themselves by picking a disjointed comp. All the high Elo Azir players will tell you that the most common mistake new players make is trying to use Azir ult to make flashy plays when most of the time the thing to do is to use it for safety and peel. However, Sivir is too short range to benefit from having a wall to stand behind, so the only thing he can do is try to insec the enemy team."
Cloud9,3ak6nv,Aiendar1,2,Sun Jun 21 00:28:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, assuming Charlie still has the final say I don't know what he's doing. I'm not sure how much more time you need to give Cloud 9 to mesh as a team, but that comp looked terrible. When it came down to Incarnation's pick I was basically screaming inside for them to not pick Azir/Kog. BIG changes need to happen with the way the team is looking now."

Even if their current play extends to the end of the season (which is starting to look like a very real possibility), are you actually going to sit there and tell me they'll NEVER play well again?  What kind of time traveler do you have to be to make an incredibly raw statement like that?"
Cloud9,3ak6nv,tarvoplays,3,Sun Jun 21 00:23:58 2015 UTC,"The thing is, whenever they are down, they improve. They haven't been improving. They have the EXACT same issues. Nothing is getting better, same/similar picks, playstyle, objective control. Nothing is getting better."
Cloud9,3ak6nv,Pedarsen,0,Sun Jun 21 00:26:17 2015 UTC,"Nothing is getting better right now with they staff/players/resources they currently have available.  But that's for the immediate future.

Cloud9,3ak6nv,DashShift,2,Sun Jun 21 00:33:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldent say to ever again, but if management isint willing to make some changes nothing will change. C9 needs another coach, or analyst because that team comp was awful.  We could see the same problems with team comps being bad at the end of last split. They almost always have a lack of damage and never play the comps out properly. Its just getting really sad at this point, if c9 doesn't get more support staff they will not do well."

Is Charlie the one picking these team comps? I've never seen such horrible choices before this split. They seem to be picking half poke/half dive comps every game. Incarnati0n has played horribly on Azir every game I've watched. He made some plays today but it seems like he just AFK farms in every other game with Azir and makes no impact.  I also see zero prioritization(spelling?) for Sneaky. This is not the Sneaky from 2 years ago where it was ""put him on Ashe, who cares how he does in lane he has arrow."" Sneaky is BY FAR the highest performing member of this current roster, and if he is put on an ADC that can make a difference we've seen what can happen.(9-1-9 I think on Jinx?).  My biggest question is this: does Hai not want to coach? It seems the logical step for him. He still stays as an integral part of the team, already 100% knows the strength and weaknesses of 4/5 members, and he can help coach Meteos in shotcalling and Incarnati0n in how to adapt to mesh better with the rest of the team.  I haven't done any research on this sub prior to this post, so again, apologies if anything I've said seems dumb or misinformed. I just needed to vent after watching that last game. So frustrated."

DAE posts are usually shitposts   I didn't even realize I phrased it that way in the OP, I edited and reworded it so it's not such a ""DAE"" post.  Your response in this comment are what I expected the discussion to be. I could definitely see Balls and Lemon retiring and Sneaky and Meteos moving on to other teams or games.

Cloud9,3a4hsp,Nitefall24,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:07:24 2015 UTC,It is the interview with Travis. The one where he wore a suit.
Cloud9,3a4hsp,Ace_Machine,3,Fri Jun 19 16:58:50 2015 UTC,"He also said that a little part of him wants to see C9 do bad without him. He would probably feel too bad to come back now. https://youtu.be/_niq5iktu3M?t=26m43s  He goes on to say he wants them to win but you can tell there is that small part, the ""I told you so"" part."
Cloud9,3a4hsp,Diamond_Dartus,6,Sat Jun 20 17:35:45 2015 UTC,My best guess is that he either thought Charlie was better at the job or simply did not want to be a coach. Maybe he likes his current position more?
Cloud9,3a4hsp,kroncw,2,Wed Jun 17 04:12:45 2015 UTC,"Except Charlie isn't really the coach, he's the analyst. Also you can have more then one coach/analyst - so Charlie having the job doesn't mean Hai isn't able to take a role with the team.   Hai isn't involved because it wasn't the right move to make because of the issues in the team behind the scenes, which I think were much worse then we suspected."
Cloud9,3a4hsp,thezaitseb,2,Wed Jun 17 18:22:53 2015 UTC,"Its all about where they felt the problem was. The team as a whole felt that Hai's inability to keep up his mechanical skill was the issue the team needed to fix. They felt that they needed a mid laner that had the ability to practice as hard as the other players on the team. This is why they had Hai step down.  On the other side, no one felt that Charlie's coaching style was an issue and still feel that he is a great coach. If his coaching ability was called into question, then they would have probably tried Hai as a coach in an attempt to fix this. However, since they like Charlie and still feel he is doing his job well, the team doesn't need him to step down.  My guess is that if they feel Charlie is the issue, that Hai will be given an opportunity to try coaching but I don't see the team feeling like Charlie is the issue any time soon."
Cloud9,3a4hsp,UrSh4d0w,2,Wed Jun 17 08:12:23 2015 UTC,"Hai was in disagreement on how the game should be played, and there were a few arguments about it. On top of that, we know the players lost confidence in him. So why would he want to put himself in that environment?"

Cloud9,3a4hsp,ObamaAteMyChicken,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:59:31 2015 UTC,Source? Cause from Hai's retirement interview it leads me to believe the opposite.
Cloud9,3a4hsp,thezaitseb,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:26:02 2015 UTC,"he said he had too much pride in the interview but I believe it's probably because he didn't think it would lead to a good team environment for him to immediately move to coach. It would be hard for the other players to see him as the coach instead of their team mate and also those that had disagreed with him about how the game should be played would probably feel the way they did last split, so the potential for future disagreements would be high.   I think if Hai is to come in as a coach it's good they explore it now (or later) as he gets more distance from his teammate career.  I don't think he has to remove/replace Charlie if he does. I think we saw from the past that Hai wasn't the guy for picks/bans really - he always deferred it to Lemon. So I am not sure he would be an all encompassing coach for the team that would fix everything anyways. He can't go into the game and shotcall for them.... What is the main issue you think Hai would fix in the team if he was brought in as coach? From all accounts most of his advantages were from being in game, I don't think he can tough a magic crystal and pass his shotcalling down to the next guy. I've played in shotcalling environments (MMO raiding) and you really can't pass that crap on and you can't teach it. I've tried for years. It's like a puzzle solver mindset really, you gotta have the mind to look for the solutions everywhere."
Cloud9,3a4hsp,thezaitseb,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:38:23 2015 UTC,"I dont think Hai needs to become Coach, but i wish Hai was at least helping out Meteos in his shotcalling, that is clearly the main issue at the moment and i hope that one of them is reaching out to the other for at the least, some advice."
Cloud9,3a4hsp,Bloodtotem193,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:37:14 2015 UTC,They need to move on and figure out how they need to play the game with Incarnati0n playing mid and Meteos shotcalling. Incarnati0n and Hai don't have the same strengths and weaknesses.
Cloud9,3a4hsp,IreliasMyWaifu,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:08:31 2015 UTC,"I dont think Hai as coach solves C9s problems this split, you either want Hai to coach Metos's shot calling which will take time to improve even with Hai and Pick/ban was controlled by Lemon and Charlie even when Hai was there.   What C9 needs if they want to not get relegated is Hai to play with the team in LCS, either take over Support or something idk, I mention support as it does not require as much mechanical skill as Mid or any of the other roles and this would bode well with Hai's injury while still allowing him to shot-call with not much other pressure to make plays.  I know this is all very wish full thinking but at this stage this seems like the only solution to C9s problems this split"

I remember there being quite a bit of awe and appreciation for that artwork, many commenting how it feels majestic and appropriate for the leader to have his backs turned in the center of the scene, that he is leading the way for his people and that he has trust in them(not to stab him in the back is the basis of the principle, though in the storyline he trusts them much more greatly than that).  Thanks for the the memory trip - two of them in the matter of fact. I still miss Hai and will probably continue to for what he was to the team, and will continue to support C9 in their new adventure with what could be a new centerpiece to the team. I haven't thought of FMA in such a long time and oh man suddenly I miss that too ;w ;"

Cloud9,39u2lj,yoonaya,2,Sun Jun 14 19:54:16 2015 UTC,"On a related note: we needed this. Looking at the C9 TL Postgame here, so much positive and constructive comments were downvoted. I didn't even want to get involved. This though, this I can dig (no pun intended). #ScrewYouAzingy"
Cloud9,39u2lj,PastyDeath,14,Mon Jun 15 16:04:13 2015 UTC,"We looked so, so much better other than that part of the game where they randomly got aced. Really nice to see aggression instead of passive play, we goin up from here!"

If Slooshi hadn't gotten hit into the turret he would've died immediately, which would've stopped the overstay, the 4 man pulverize, the emperor's divide, and the absolute zero landing which would've meant no ace."
Cloud9,39u2lj,elyndar,9,Wed Jun 17 10:41:55 2015 UTC,"Other than that one misstep in the mid game, C9 looked in great control. Incranati0n with the engage"
Cloud9,39u2lj,Ace_Machine,9,Sun Jun 14 19:54:44 2015 UTC,"Finally, a game where Sneaky doesn't get camped, and him and Lemon are allowed to take control of their lane 2v2."
Cloud9,39u2lj,mcshuggets,2,Sun Jun 14 19:54:44 2015 UTC,"A heavy threat incarnati0n is definately the key to this!  If he can keep eyes on him, the rest of the lanes can play the game they always have."
Cloud9,39u2lj,PastyDeath,9,Mon Jun 15 16:05:30 2015 UTC,I hope Incarnati0n's play today is a trend. :)
Cloud9,39u2lj,Diamond_Dartus,4,Sun Jun 14 19:55:26 2015 UTC,I think we all do. This was a very impressive game by him and i really hope that we continue to let him play aggressive engage heavy champs so he can do what he has wanted to do from the start.
Cloud9,39u2lj,Bloodtotem193,3,Sun Jun 14 20:01:09 2015 UTC,"If he can just start being a nuisance mid, dragging jungle attention and roams his way and freeing up sneaky and lemon to dominate lane like usual, we will play much better.  All while winning lane I might add. (The reason we picked him up or so I thought)"
Cloud9,39u2lj,Diamond_Dartus,5,Sun Jun 14 20:04:06 2015 UTC,"Meteos is a gragas god, and Incarnati0n really showed up this game. Really proud and hopeful for next week!"
Cloud9,39u2lj,ItzzBlink,4,Sun Jun 14 19:59:37 2015 UTC,"Incarnation showed up today and showed why everyone touted him as an elite midlaner. Before he played like a shitty Shiptur, only caring about his KDA and not making any plays or impacting the game significantly. Watching him flash-ult Nien was really great to watch, and shows that he is comfortable on stage now."
Cloud9,39u2lj,Jixxur,8,Sun Jun 14 21:22:44 2015 UTC,"This better shut up all you naysayers. This game was really good and the only bad part was the one teamfight that was just a mistake. They look so much better this week than they have the past 2 weeks and they are only going to get better from here.  If that game doesnt shut people up think about the schedule that we have had the past 2 weeks. facing 3 top teams in TL, TIP, and TSM, winning against TSM, losing to a surging DIG that beat TSM as well, All with pretty much a brand new roster so i think we were all getting a little ahead of ourselves thinking that we were on this great decline.  GG WP cloud 9, hope you guys continue to rise as the rest of the split continues.  Edit: for those who didnt listen in after the game, there was a clip of one of the teamfights later in the game with the comm sounds and it was mostly Meteos doing calls and he sounded a WHOLE LOT more confident in what he was calling. I hope this is a good sign of him coming into the shotcalling role."
Cloud9,39u2lj,Bloodtotem193,9,Sun Jun 14 19:57:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think any of us are naysayers, we are all c9 fans, we are just worried. I'm never jumping ship, I'm blue through and through, can't mean I'm not worried about our performance.  To your point I think we will continue to get better and better, Meteos still has access to Hai as Hai is still in the c9 organization. Shotcalling is a learning process."

Cloud9,39u2lj,Bloodtotem193,2,Sun Jun 14 20:17:11 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, okay I understand. No we most certainly will not be in relegations this season, but if we don't keep improving I really doubt we'll finish anything higher than 3-4. Lucky us, there is still a lot of time."
Cloud9,39u2lj,CertusAT,3,Sun Jun 14 20:21:54 2015 UTC,"A lot better. Their shotcalling still needs a bit of work but there are signs of life. There was that failed engage on Slooshi from Meteos in the midlane and after they won the teamfight at the raptors, they ran back and forth between baron and nexus."
Cloud9,39u2lj,NoteCyclone,3,Sun Jun 14 19:55:19 2015 UTC,"Looked a lot better even though it was just Team 8. Incarnati0n needs to work on his skill shot accuracy, missed a lot of the early arrows in lane and one huge miss on his ult when they got aced (Was like seeing Xmithie).  Loved that it seemed like they went for plays without hesitating. The play in top lane and the play near mid right after were Meteos flashed in.  Step in the right direction!"
Cloud9,39u2lj,Pedarsen,2,Sun Jun 14 20:00:39 2015 UTC,"That ult miss was tough, if he didn't bump into the dead tower it would have been spot on."
Cloud9,39u2lj,yoonaya,2,Sun Jun 14 20:03:16 2015 UTC,"If you saw Sneaky shot the exact same shot as Inc did, just with his W. Seems everyone on c9 thought that's where he'd land lol."

Cloud9,39u2lj,Bloodtotem193,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:02:31 2015 UTC,"What we were was a top NA LCS team, but with never hope of wining or doing very well at worlds, the plan for the team now is to change that, so hopefully in a few splits maybe the team can grow to be a world contender. I do think this roster has a few splits left with the older players like lemon to become a stronger team then the hai era."
Cloud9,39u2lj,Delay559,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:06:21 2015 UTC,"That's 100% false. We could have performed at worlds with Hai, if his wrists let him play enough. 2014 meta was unfortunate for us, since it placed a HUGE emphasis on mid lane picks and if your mid got fed, you would probably win. Hai was weaker mechanically than most mids they played, so that's why they didn't do as well at worlds.   Now the meta is more focused on top snowballing, and I believe we could have done better at worlds this year."
Cloud9,39u2lj,miztah1999z,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:41:14 2015 UTC,"Well ya we coulda if his wrists were fine, but they arnt, so we couldent. By the time worlds would roll around hai would either have destroyed wrists, or would have to do so little practice in order to stay fine that he wouldent be able to compete so either way no we couldent have done super well at worlds this year."
Cloud9,39u2lj,Delay559,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:15:09 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, this was a vintage monster performance from Sneaky, and that is exactly what Cloud 9 needs. Having Incarnati0n play the aggressor and having the mechanical skill to make plays will take eyes off of Sneaky and hopefully that will enable more games like this one. The boys looked more comfortable this week. Sure yesterdays game ended poorly but we saw improvement...if Cloud 9 is as bad as everyone else believes this would have been a far closer game."
Cloud9,39u2lj,dardios,2,Sun Jun 14 20:06:28 2015 UTC,"Having Incarnati0n play the aggressor and having the mechanical skill to make plays will take eyes off of Sneaky and hopefully that will enable more games like this one   I couldn't agree more. It's an entirely new game style for c9; hopefully their coaching staff can see this is the way things have to be. Highlight incarnati0n, which in turn frees up sneaky (lemon) and balls to beastmode."
Cloud9,39u2lj,PastyDeath,2,Mon Jun 15 16:10:50 2015 UTC,"This was necessary. I'm so glad they were able to not only win, but able to win in a commanding fashion. That has to feel good for them."

Cloud9,39u2lj,gamestar_21,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:15:09 2015 UTC,Great win even if its against Team 8. I really liked their team comp with the double AD and Ardent Censer Karma.  Every one played great and they seemed more like a coordinated team in rotations and fights.  Also I thought it was funny how indifferent they were after they won
Cloud9,39u2lj,Battle_Toaster,2,Sun Jun 14 20:03:54 2015 UTC,"Was this the first time Lemon played Karma in LCS? I don't remember him playing her before. I was concerned because it was (as far as I can remember) a new champion for him. However, Lemon has traditionally done well when playing a champ the first time in LCS."
Cloud9,39u2lj,bcbenton,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:15:37 2015 UTC,"It's definitely the first time he's playing the new Karma.  I think I remember him playing it once or twice before a while ago, but I'm probably mistaken."
Cloud9,39u2lj,Battle_Toaster,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:42:50 2015 UTC,I feel like Inci (I call him like that okay? ;-;) finally found a play stile that fits what Hai used to play. He now has a reliable engage like Hai liked and can start getting more confident because he knows that he can make the plays and get out of it if he messes up but is still able to stay in the backline.

Meteos was talking 90% of the time and the other members gave him quick updates the other times, making the comms very clear with meteos selecting targets and them telling them to push mid. Was much better shotcalling then the TSM game we heard where it was more chaotic and meteos even hesitating, he sounded a lot more confident.   Although its just a clip but stil!"

Look I know they have been inconsistent, but what you have to realize is this team, as talented as they are on an individual level for the last 2 years have had Hai in game to lead 100% to call flash engages to tell each player in every lane what they should be doing, not that they have lost an ability, its just they are kinda having to relearn to play the game without Hai, it sounds weird I know. They are getting better each and every week, they are learning how to play the game with each other, they have tons of talent in each of the play making positions now its time to harness the talent and turn it into wins. BUT MY GOODNESS WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS NON-SENSE ABOUT NOT THINKING WE CAN BEAT NME???? SERIOUSLY???? Trashy-Trash Meteos will shit on him Otter-Sneaky will shit on him, leave kalista up, bait the vayne pick. Flarez-depends who he plays if balls gets a 1v1 and can bait flares to play aggro early meteos gank can snowball the lane for balls no probs. Incarnation getting better and better each week and he has yet to play one of his good champions.  Screw the haters we got this."

I think the main factor this game will be pick and ban phase, because there are some important things to notice:   If Trashy plays an aggressive jungler and is able to shut down Sneaky/Lemon it will be hard. I don't see C9 winning a game with Incarnati0n playing Azir... I'd like to see his Varus/Kog again, but I'm open to new picks, especially assassins like Zed and Fizz. Obviously if Balls gets Rumble they will likely win, but I don't see that happen. Nonetheless I'd love not to see Balls on Maokai once again, but rather in Hecarim (if that gets through bans) or Gnar. Probably Enemy will have a ban on Karma concerning Lemons performance and that she is hard to lane against. Meteos please don't play Nunu. Just seems not to be his best pick.    I think they can take the victory though."

Cloud9,39ref5,MLSxDumpster,2,Sun Jun 14 05:15:54 2015 UTC,Especially when LB was open. There's a reason LB is usually banned before they pick Azir.  It's kind of shocking that inc did as well as he did vs LB at all.

We're relying too much on late game and thus constantly falling behind early."
Cloud9,39ref5,arvinarvin,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:11:00 2015 UTC,"The strong mid presence used to be what allowed meteos to camp balls - when hai had his pool exposed, balls also suffered since meteos had one more lane to have to keep a tab on (since hai would often roam or ward after shoving).  I can see balls bouncing back this split since the meta seems to be shifting again towards more top lane carry champions that aren't really CC bots like earlier (he was really good on AP tops like ryze/karth/vlad/rumble earlier in the team's career - which allowed hai to focus on his AD champ pool like kha/zed/jayce)"
Cloud9,39ref5,heymomimonreddit,3,Tue Jun 16 13:11:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as I see things:  Balls is in a HUGE slump, stop giving him carry chars and just give him shit that can't fail.  Incarnation is playing well, but he keeps getting chars that are supposed to scale up, stop that! Give him chars that have strong early/mid game.  Meteos needs carry junglers, and he needs to focus gank for MID!!! and bot, balls needs to survive on his own until he gets out of this depressing slump.  Sneaky.....just be sneaky.  Lemon, dude, can you play ANYTHING but nautilus? I mean maybe you force yourself in to the pick because nautilus can operate as a ""tank"" but please, yesterday it was clear that the enemy team would be charging IN to you, so you needed disengage. Instead you keep picking nautilus almost every game, it makes me sick."
Cloud9,39ref5,CertusAT,2,Sun Jun 14 08:41:38 2015 UTC,Agree on Lemon's point. His champion pool seems very limited this season for some weird ass reason. He should try some other champs. I would like to see something like a Kalista/Thresh lane from which Sneaky can carry hard
Cloud9,39ref5,mayank27tiwary,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:54:58 2015 UTC,They keep giving inc late game champions then being suprised when the enemy invades them level 1. Maybe pick a better early game.

Cloud9,39ref5,miztah1999z,2,Sun Jun 14 16:27:44 2015 UTC,Because lane =/= game. Naut is a off-tank + good cc/initiator. But in this specific game they clearly needed some disengage. It starts to feel like as if lemon can't / won't play anything but naut.
Cloud9,39ref5,CertusAT,3,Sun Jun 14 16:45:16 2015 UTC,I think hecarim needs to be banned or picked by us. IMO (and I'm only silver 5 so take this with a grain of salt) he is a completely brainless champion whose ult turns fights AND is easy to hit

Cloud9,39ref5,DrSoap,2,Sun Jun 14 06:35:52 2015 UTC,"Might be something they have to sacrafice sadly for a strong 2016 season :/ They might need a full split of stage experience to get going and then in 2016 they will turn it on right from day 1. Obvs it would be great to see them in play offs and even worlds and it would be great experience but i wont lose hope if they dont even make play offs this split, nex season however there arnt anymore excuses"
Cloud9,39ref5,Delay559,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:41:58 2015 UTC,"We'll all be sad if that's the case, but keep in mind that competitive League is here to stay for at least a couple more years, so we'll have to think more long term. Every failure is a learning experience, and with patience they'll eventually come together even if it takes more than one split to accomplish it."
Cloud9,39ref5,kroncw,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:47:07 2015 UTC,"The good thing about this split though, is C9 still has a strong possibility to auto-make worlds as long as they can make playoffs, based on their points. Even if they don't qualify automatically by winning playoffs or having the highest points, they can still make it through the bracket for 3rd place, as they'd have a fairly high seed in that. I feel as long as C9 makes playoffs, there's a strong chance we'll see them at worlds."

Cloud9,39qzdl,ImArkadius,11,Sun Jun 14 06:18:18 2015 UTC,"I was pretty happy with the improvement, considering the level of play from the previous weeks. Definitely optimistic!  Seeing sneaky getting caught was a weird sight.  Given meteos played nunu, we finally got dragons!  Balls played damn well, imo. In the fight by red, he seemed to be the only one doing damage."
Cloud9,39qzdl,uhmareikuh,3,Sat Jun 13 22:20:03 2015 UTC,"I noticed when sneaky got caught near the baron pit, the whole team was split up and meteos was poked hard and running away. Presumably the team comm was in disarray at the moment thus leading to sneaky's death.   I'm more glad that this game Incarn and Balls played pretty well. Especially Incarn who's probably getting more comfortable to the stage."
Cloud9,39qzdl,kroncw,7,Sat Jun 13 22:26:52 2015 UTC,Thoughts on Nunu as a pick for Meteos (not as a pick for the team)?  I don't think its the greatest of picks for Meteos.
Cloud9,39qzdl,Slitted,2,Sat Jun 13 22:21:23 2015 UTC,for that team I feel it was picked too early without any information.  They ended up having no lockdown outside of lemon for a very mobile team. I also don't feel it's a strong pick with the way they've had incarnation on passive late-game carries - invading without back up as just seen doesn't work and is easily abused by a team with multiple ways to control your movement. It worked extremely well with Hai because Hai's main goal in lane was shove up and look for a play/set vision - incarnation isn't the same way.  Would like to see them at least try a more aggressive comp with incarnation on a non-mid/late champion though.
Cloud9,39qzdl,indecisionn,2,Sat Jun 13 22:29:06 2015 UTC,"Trying out roam oriented mid laners could be interesting, since it would supplement an invade strategy more than an Azir pick."
Cloud9,39qzdl,Slitted,2,Sat Jun 13 23:14:32 2015 UTC,I would have really liked to see incarnation on leblanc instead of azir.
Cloud9,39qzdl,TOSHINO_KYOUKO,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:30:20 2015 UTC,I think Lee Sin would have been a better pick.
Cloud9,39qzdl,SmokingTheReefer,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:33:28 2015 UTC,"They picked Nunu as a take away from Dominate. The 2 top jungle picks at the moment are Reksai and Gragas, with some teams picking up Lee sin depending on the Jungler. I think the issue was the Fizz pick, its not a terrible pick but isnt as strong of an engage tool as Hecarim is and we know that Balls can play a good Hecarim."
Cloud9,39qzdl,Bloodtotem193,2,Sat Jun 13 23:04:07 2015 UTC,I don't know if Dominate would have picked Nunu (unless Meteos picked Ekko) since Dominate has been spamming Ekko hard.
Cloud9,39qzdl,Slitted,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:34:31 2015 UTC,"Don't think it's a bad pick for him, maybe not the best. But the problems that cloud9 has right now lies with the shot calling. You can see how un-cordinated they are at times. We need the decisive shot calling that Hai brought. (As mentioned on Summoning insight, they lack the confidence to just do something without thinking)"
Cloud9,39qzdl,Pedarsen,6,Sat Jun 13 22:30:01 2015 UTC,"Meteos with some pretty questionable invades, teamfighting still doesn't look very good but we didn't get smashed. Must win game tomorrow."
Cloud9,39qzdl,IreliasMyWaifu,7,Sat Jun 13 22:22:35 2015 UTC,"From what I saw Meteos' shotcalling was a lot better, but his personal decision making suffered.   I don't know how the team is going to adjust to incarnation still. I'm losing hope week after week because Hai was always the guy to set up a team fight for success. The general c9 layman would say ""Hai sucks he dies so much!"" But I've always said, he rushes into fights and either completely locks down or eliminates the enemies team fight win condition, even at the cost of his life. You see this constantly. Sure after his lung collapse and wrist injury he wasn't the same laner, but he always had the mentality of what can I do to win this team fight for my team, and he would do it.  Incarnati0n just doesn't have the same mentality. He never peeled for anyone but himself with ult this game, sure we traded up mechanically, but c9 has never been a mechanical team, we have been a set of workhorses, shoving the game down the enemies throats and strangling them, then when we have the lead due to rotations, denial and shotcalling, we have the chance to make slight mistakes during team fights and still come out with an ace.  We lost one of the best shot callers in the world, and gained an amazing solo queue player. Week after week though, this game included, we don't have that person to say, I'm going in, I'm going to die, but I will shut down their strategy.  Sorry for the rant, I just love c9, they're my team damnit I want them to win!"
Cloud9,39qzdl,Diamond_Dartus,2,Sat Jun 13 22:32:57 2015 UTC,I remember specifically Hai winning a team fight in one of his last games with the Jarvan pick because he used flag and drag to counter/prevent a Lissandra from clawing into the mass of C9.
Cloud9,39qzdl,rukez,3,Sun Jun 14 01:50:05 2015 UTC,"Yea i think the main thing to take away form this game is that we are looking a whole lot better than the past few weeks. Of course we need some more time but i am starting to hope again.  The main issue i had with the game was that we picked fizz, i think we should have taken Hecarim in the first rotation. Balls has proven that he can be deadly on that champion if given the chance."
Cloud9,39qzdl,Bloodtotem193,3,Sat Jun 13 22:19:28 2015 UTC,It's getting better. The team fighting and getting caught out killed us.
Cloud9,39qzdl,Ace_Machine,2,Sat Jun 13 22:17:43 2015 UTC,"C9 looked a lot better. Sneaky out of position a lot, and Meteos didn't really use an ult in the latter teamfights. I'd really like to see Meteos on a more impactful jungler than Nunu, perhaps Zac or Sej, etc.  Still really sad that we're losing. Waiting for C9 to come back to form, I know it'll happen soon."
Cloud9,39qzdl,Razgrizacez,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:21:55 2015 UTC,"Meteos held on to his ult because of the potential CCs coming from TL that could disrupt his channel. (Hecarim, Alistar, Ekko), i think."

Cloud9,39qzdl,ObamaAteMyChicken,0,Sat Jun 13 23:20:42 2015 UTC,Dont really know how you are seeing no improvements. Incarnati0n was actually doing well in lane against Fenix and was even making aggressive moves in the late game. The team looks like they somewhat know what they are doing in the mid game instead of looking like ducks with their heads cut off. And balls was actually doing stuff that game instead of being dead weight.  It will definitely take some more time to get better but this is a good start compared to the past 2 weeks.
Cloud9,39qzdl,Bloodtotem193,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:30:43 2015 UTC,"No.. They tried to avoid every team fight possible. In order to get an objective trade. They lost every team fight that happened, and the only thing that extended the game from being a complete stomp was the baron. .   They got dragons but thats meaningless, they need to fight and win fights but they're playing scared.   You also seem to forget that these pros practice all week in between lcs, from 7-10 hours a day as a team, the improvent that should be shown is actually non-existent to how much practice they should be putting in.  Team gravity lost saint, a shot-caller, and cop, and they look cleaner and more dominant than c9. So why is c9 a special occasion, and need so much time to make drastic improvements."
Cloud9,39qzdl,1vs1mebro,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:40:20 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree with you on the game. They were playing the comp right, it was a pick comp not a 5v5 teamfight comp. And we did a lot better in the mid game than we have in the past couple of weeks. the fact that the baron kept us in the game was more because we were still close in gold to allow a baron steal to bring it back.  And its completely unreasonable to compare us to Gravity. Saint may have been in a similar position as hai in terms of shot calling on the team but he was nowhere near as good. Not to mention they arent making as big of a change as we are because Hai playstyle is completely different from Incarnati0n. Our team is going from having one of the best shotcallers in the game and a mid laner that was selfless with his gold to a new shotcaller and a mid laner who pulls in resources instead of giving them to his team. and Cop didnt really do anything imo, he was a good adc but wasnt as good as the one they have now."
Cloud9,39qzdl,Bloodtotem193,-1,Sat Jun 13 23:12:10 2015 UTC,"c9 will never be as successful than when they had hai on the team. at least with incarnation they wont.   By successful i mean in terms of team strength, that doesn't necessarily mean win %.  I don't care if c9 wins/losses, it's how they win/lose"
Cloud9,39qzdl,1vs1mebro,3,Sat Jun 13 23:18:33 2015 UTC,"Thats a pretty bold statement for only 5 games, 2 of which are against very strong teams like TSM/TL. How can you possibly know what the team will be like in a few months? Its not like TSM's first weeks with bjergsen were good/as good as their proevious weeks, same with TL. C9 has never rostered swap and have been used to a godly shotcaller, you cant possible be dense enough to think that just based on 5 games you know they will never be as good/better then with hai."

Now the biggest problem I feel besides the shot calling, was Meteos getting caught out/Nunu pick. In theory it wasn't bad but it just doesn't do much in terms of team fighting which that is what TL wants to do. The early drags were good though. Idk, I'm just so bummed and get so sad watching C9.

If it was necessary and beneficial to the organization Jack would have implemented new analysts and coaches a long time ago."
Cloud9,39q6jg,StraightFomKILL,2,Sat Jun 13 19:12:35 2015 UTC,"You know the team they lost to today, Team Liquid? Yeah, pretty sure Piglet's roster change started off worse than this; they're not benching Incarnati0n for a sub. They have kinks to work out, and it's amplified by the main shot-caller not being around anymore. The strategy is only a minor part of the issue--you might have a great strat but if you are unable to react properly to a curve-ball it will all be for naught. If it were someone like Balls or Sneaky being replaced, someone who doesn't do major shot calling in the mid-late game, it wouldn't be going as bad. TSM was able to get away with it when they replaced Reggie because Bjerg was a shot-caller in his role with CW/NIP. But even then, they still had some adjusting to do, as he wasn't the primary shot caller and it still took getting used to. It worked out in the end, and it probably wasn't as rough as the level of competition at that point in early S4 was still very much lacking; you had XDG, which basically imploded from Vulcun after the Zuna/xmithie swap, EG was barely an improvement and would have certainly been knocked out of LCS if they lost their last game to XDG and had to play against LMQ in the relegation match (this was also Snoopeh/YellowPete's last full competitive split), and then CRS, DIG, and CST were all mediocre, sitting around 10-12 wins and 16-18 losses. CLG was a solid third, and only CLG/C9 were really any true competition for TSM that whole split. The skill level in LCS has risen tremendously since coaches and analysts have become more common (also resulting in C9 losing their lemmon advantage, as his pick/ban strats were far and above any other LCS teams' ability to pick/ban).   Is C9 doing well right now? I actually don't think they're doing terribly. They're making some mistakes that wouldn't happen with Hai, but others still very well could have (Sneaky getting caught out of baron pit at the end of that game). Their loss to Dig doesn't seem as bad now that TSM also lost to DIG, TL is also tied for 1st with DIG, and Gravity/Impulse were top 5 teams last split, and each are sitting at 3-2. 1-4 sucks as a start for C9, but it isn't panic time and it isn't the end of the world. They will not have an easy split, and it will be their worst record yet, but they're improving any game and will be better and better as the split continues"
Cloud9,39q6jg,Arctic_Wolf_lol,2,Sat Jun 13 22:32:06 2015 UTC,"Perhaps a fake fan such as yourself should go to the TSM page, UOL page, or whatever team is currently flavour of the month (perhaps DIG?). I read your post in its entirety, but shot-calling is not the same as ego; I apologize for the way I refuted your assertion that C9's current start is worse than TL's last split, it was done haughtily and with derision, and perhaps it should not have been. Nor did I ever blame Meteos--in fact, if YOU read MY post you'd see that I did not even mention Meteos. I was simply stating a fact that losing a shot caller (hai) is a bit more difficult to overcome than losing an ADC (cop), especially if that shot caller who was lost is/was widely regarded as one of the best (if not THE BEST) in the game. And lastly, how do you judge C9 as terrible off of 5 games? Simply because they went 1-4 it's the end of the world, C9 needs to get new staff or bench Incarnati0n? (yes, I am well aware you said right in your post you weren't saying to bench Incarnation, but logically that would be the next step if new staff didn't work?) What you don't seem to realize is that 5 games, especially at the start of the split, doesn't mean squat. Yeah, it's definitely helpful if you win them all. But at least have some faith in your team! (or might I redirect you to my first point?) Last split, C9 had a rough start, still ended up in 2nd place (split and playoffs). Gambit lost 5 games strait last split and ended up going on a 7 game winning streak following that. First LCS split ever CRS and DIG had godly starts, CRS ended 4th (of course) and DIG even got sent to the relegation tournament along side CLG. Last split CLG looked incredible to start and they ended up being 3-0'd by the 6th place team which barely just squeaked into playoffs, after failing to secure a bye which was theirs to give away. It's not how you start, it's how you finish. To condemn C9 as trash, their roster swap as a failure and their staff as outdated and in need of replacement AFTER 5 FUCKING GAMES IS FUCKING INSANITY! Please, Mr. Fair-weather fan, don't bother posting in the C9 section again. Real fans have faith in our teams."
Cloud9,39q6jg,Arctic_Wolf_lol,-1,Sun Jun 14 01:07:33 2015 UTC,"I actually feel Incarnati0n isn't doing that bad. Sure he's playing like shit compared to how he was hyped. He's playing like a mid of the road mid laner right now, hopefully there's only room to improve."
Cloud9,39q6jg,SmokingTheReefer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:07:48 2015 UTC,"It seems like no matter who they're against, C9 loses the pick and ban phase and the early game rotations. I think they need two analysts and a coach; one analyst for each team they face during the week. I don't know how good Charlie is at analysis, but his pick and ban phase is awful compared to the rest of the region."
Cloud9,39q6jg,Aiendar1,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:55:23 2015 UTC,but he's no Bjergsen and I highly doubt he'll ever get to that level in this split.   Bjergsen sucked major dick in his first NA split. Maybe he IS a Bjergsen.
Cloud9,39q6jg,sandr0,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:37:37 2015 UTC,"I mean, if by ""sucking dick"" you mean coming in and pretty much immediately dumpstering every other mid laner in the region at that time then yeah. Bjergsen definitely sucked a lot of dick."
Cloud9,39q6jg,Codeik,0,Sat Jun 13 22:50:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't think having an entire crew of analyst and coaches would do all that much. I believe that there is more than just one or two easy to solve problems that coaches can just fix or even work on over time. We are still only 2 weeks in to the split and while there have been struggles I think we need a few more weeks to see some synergy come together. It may just have been Hai that was replaced, but the entire team dynamic has changed and that is going to take a lot of adjustments."

Cloud9,39e1qn,MCXI,13,Thu Jun 11 03:05:04 2015 UTC,"I think everyone wants to say ""Give them time"" But are secretly panicing while their fantasy team crumbles.   Do you know why Hai got a promotion by Jack when he stoped playing? Because he was that team. He put them together, got them in to the LCS. Quantic anyone? He earned that right, and i think the world of Jack being an actual good owner who cares.  The thing is, The core of the team switched. It's C9 without Hai. That means a new mid laner and a new shotcaller. You have Hai, a selfless strategic and tactical midlaner who's whole game in mid was setting up for objectives. Then you have Incarnati0n, a SoloQ player, who is highly mechanical, and who's strength lies in winning a lane, and snowballing, so he can control fights. Then you have Meteos, who's very much ""win condition"" orientated, like hai, but has only a tiny bit of expierence that he gained while i was there to pick up the slack on any fuck-ups.  The problem is, as i see it, is that they are trying so very hard to be Cloud 9 with Meteos playing the role of Hai's brain, and Incarnati0n as his hands. They are doing what they think Hai would do.   Meteos needs to learn his style of shot calling using the team he has now, not the team last split, and Incarnati0n needs to play his game. I don't think it will happen for a few weeks, but when it does, it will show in the score of the game."
Cloud9,39e1qn,shade4x,9,Thu Jun 11 05:18:46 2015 UTC,"Sneaky was asked about it on his stream last night, and he answered with something similar. Along the lines of ""weve just been doing the shotcalling wrong, like we wouldent always listen to meteos which isnt correct. Weve basicaly been trying to keep playing like hai was there but he isnt. Weve changed that now and scrims have been going a lot better. I think we are heading in the right direction now""  Seems like they were in fact playing like they still had a hai, but are now changing that so hopefully everything works out."
Cloud9,39e1qn,Delay559,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:56:23 2015 UTC,Do you know what time on the stream/VOD he said it? I'd really like to hear his whole view on it.
Cloud9,39e1qn,ObamaAteMyChicken,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:31:08 2015 UTC,"The big thing on my mind is that before shot calling can do anything, whether he copies hai or not is incarnati0n needs to learn how to think like a pro. Things like know when he can back that won't be punished by 5 coordinated players ect.. but like it's been said, takes time ;p"
Cloud9,39e1qn,Ace_Machine,6,Thu Jun 11 06:21:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know if we are in a community agreement based on some comments, but time is what is needed. The team needs to find an identity. Kobe and Phreak said the same thing happened to TSM when they got Bjergsen."

Cloud9,39e1qn,miztah1999z,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:31:05 2015 UTC,Alot of people have been making that comparison. My first thought is that bjergson had been play professionally already when he cam to NA. I guess you could compare it to meteos picking up the shot calling role though.
Cloud9,39e1qn,pyrojackelope,7,Thu Jun 11 03:33:17 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I don't know if shotcalling can be taught. Incarnation will probably start playing better, but if you look at Balls, meteos sneaky lemon, they are all playing a lot worse than before.   It is like Hai was micro managing all of their lanes, from mid"
Cloud9,39e1qn,Goorag,7,Thu Jun 11 03:37:32 2015 UTC,"Thats reminds me that I used to discribe c9 as hai using 4 mechanicly talented people following his brain cuz he can't control 5 champs. Maybe it's more true than I thought. I have hope, they showed in game one that on instinct they can rotate and have good teamfights. I belive they can figure it out."
Cloud9,39e1qn,Bennyboozle,2,Thu Jun 11 03:46:52 2015 UTC,"Two things I've seen so far:   They give up too many dragons.  They used to pretty much get them all, or at least the first one.  This split they're just letting their opponents have them and they get punished hard for it. I'm still not convinced they're going in the right direction with their champ picks.  They keep grabbing a bunch of stuff that they're comfortable on while everyone else tailors their team-comp to counter."

Cloud9,39e1qn,XstarD,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:45:08 2015 UTC,"What people need to realize is that Cloud 9 were in this position before with Hai as the shotcaller back when they originally tried to qualify for LCS with the roster of Hai, Lemon, Yazuki, Wildturtle, and Nien.   Hai always brings up the base race call he made that caused his team to lose their LCS qualifier game, and how it forever shaped him as a shotcaller and taught him many things that he would need to know to improve. Now if we think about Cloud 9 from season 3 through 4, we think of a dominant team with many selfless players that have incredible strategy and control of the game, mainly due to their high-class shotcaller Hai and their fantastic players.   Hai learned from his mistakes and worked his hardest to patch the holes in his leadership role, which led him and his team to victory. So as a C9 fan, I'm expecting their roster to do poorly for a period of time, but once they learn from their mistakes, they will become the C9 that everyone knows and loves.  Also, people tend to forget that Incarnati0n did coach a team for a while, so he obviously knows a lot about the game and can definately become a great shotcaller. Currently Meteos is the shotcaller, but as time goes on we will figure out what changes happen to the C9 team structure."

That being said, I do wish they would put Incarnati0n on some assassins and diversify their play style to help him adapt to the team; I think it would be something the other four could adapt too/are used too from when Hai played Zed a lot and they could pick up a few wins on that comp while they work on their synergy."

Cloud9,393083,rukez,2,Tue Jun 9 14:19:53 2015 UTC,Incarnati0n also has a very different play style than Hai.
Cloud9,393083,Ace_Machine,4,Mon Jun 8 22:28:13 2015 UTC,"If you ever saw Incarnati0n on solo queue, he is a hard carry type, Hai on the other hand was the complete opposite, he was a leader, and legendary shotcaller, but never had the carry playstyle. I think with Hai gone, Meteos or Lemon will have to step up and become the leader. Meteos would be a great leader as well, he just needs to learn and practice. No one can expect Cloud 9 to thrive so soon after losing such a critical player."

As a fan, you should be concerned. If you've watched the last four games, you should be concerned. If you've listened to some of the in game team chats, you should be concerned.   Our boys are hurting out there! I dont think its fair to cite excuses for why they are doing poorly now and then talk about how great they were last split. Right now they have a lot of problems. Right now, no one is near the top in their positions. And right now is when we should be discussing what is going wrong. I'm not abandoning the cloud9 ship anytime soon, but it's time to start talking about what course its decided to take.   Apathy, excuses, and hiding behind victories of yesteryear allow a team to be knocked down and never get back up."
Cloud9,393083,Rozez,2,Tue Jun 9 07:51:52 2015 UTC,"No one here is being apathetic, and there's a difference between excuses and legitimate reasons for failure. I do agree that there's no point in bringing up past success, but realistically there's not much else fans can do. The fact is they lost a world class shot caller and primary engage in Hai and are struggling to find a new team identity without him. That said though, it's far too early for significant changes to be suggested, and right now we only have a few performances by the team to judge them on anyway."

The focus is best put on what I, as a fan, can positively contribute. Blind faith? Harsh criticism?  Study hard, become a league coach and get a job with Cloud9? Defend Cloud9 when haters are talking?  Everyone just wants to gossip, predict, and panic about the future of their fave team, when what really helps is improving the way we are as fans.  TL;DR: OPs main point is improvement comes over time, especially when making big changes, give c9 space, not doubt & concern. I totally agree."

Cloud9,393j9x,kroncw,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:10:47 2015 UTC,I thought he was the coach for the Halo team? does he happen to do both or something?

Cloud9,393j9x,kroncw,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:40:04 2015 UTC,"Chipotle, why hire a nutritionist?"
Cloud9,393j9x,BengiPrimeLOL,0,Wed Jun 10 07:10:12 2015 UTC,"I just think they are playing the game wrong.  Not as in, they are doing wrong stuff, but I feel like they are doing the wrong things for this team/lineup.  Incarnation is a SoloQ palyer, a VERY strong one. He can shit on people, hard. So let him do that. Meteos can play a very aggressive jungle and Balls can dominate top lane. Do that, play a strong Jungler and a strong mid/top lane. Let sneaky and lemon grind the shit out of bot lane and win the game either with an early game advantage  because either incarnation, balls or meteos will go off, or, go at least even early and win the game with aggressive and good play int he mid game.  I'm just sad when they play passive a fuck early game and keep playing save mid game and get choked out because of mistakes because they got no pressure eon the map and let the enemy abuse them. They should be the ones pressuring the enemy and with that pressure force mistakes / bad plays."
Cloud9,393j9x,CertusAT,2,Tue Jun 9 22:00:29 2015 UTC,I have to agree with this. When meteos is on a strong early game jungler they can do wonders. lets start putting Balls and Incarnati0n on some play making champs and see what they can do. I feel like they are wasted resources at the moment.

Cloud9,38zafs,kroncw,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:50:49 2015 UTC,"Even then though, I don't think having Hai come in to help analyze and coach would be a bad idea. Say what you will about Hai's champ pool, his laning, whatever, but the guy's shotcalling is among the best in the world and his understanding of the game is on a different level. Meteos made a lot of heat in the moment plays that Hai would make, but out of desperation. A call for Baron or Dragon at C9's position when against TiP's comp would never have happened with Hai. Back then when C9 went for these insane calls, the enemy team was extremely reluctant to go in or if they did Hai would just have the team peel off or jump on them.  I really feel that if Hai was analyzing/coaching for them they'd not only improve much faster but they'd be a lot stronger in general. Charlie hasn't seemed to have stepped up that much as a coach and this is really the time where everyone in C9 really needs to. The C9 drafting has been really questionable and it was pretty questionable last split as well."
Cloud9,38zafs,NordischKatze,7,Tue Jun 9 03:42:07 2015 UTC,"It's only 2 weeks into the split. Remember that at this time last split they had the same record too. Meteos is still new to the shotcall role and Incarn is new to the LCS stage, just give them time to adapt."

Cloud9,38zafs,YukiiAzure,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:22:15 2015 UTC,I think they need to sit down in front of a TV and watch some games. Pause the video every once in awhile and ask each of them their call. Do this for 4 hours a day and they will all be on the same page. Then they can play together and not win based on just skill but their cohesion as well.

Cloud9,38xx1q,Delay559,5,Sun Jun 7 20:17:16 2015 UTC,I've never been a shot caller in high pressure situations. It has to be difficult. That's EXACTLY what Hai did for them.
Cloud9,38xx1q,Ace_Machine,3,Sun Jun 7 20:10:06 2015 UTC,"I think that the time should be this whole split, it's incarnation's first split with a new shotcaller for the team. I think we should just focus on fixing our issues, avoid getting relegated and next split come out swinging."
Cloud9,38xx1q,gamestar_21,2,Sun Jun 7 20:46:00 2015 UTC,"I think if we aim for a 4th-6th place finish its pretty realistic and good for the team, dont expect 1st or 2nd like we usually do with C9, but getting into playoffs and not only giving incarnation and the team BO5 experience but also being the end of the season they should be doing better so we can see what the real C9 or at least more of it is capable of ."
Cloud9,38xx1q,Delay559,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:59:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely, at this point the more experience we get, the better. I definitely don't see c9 going 1st or 2nd unless we have a playoffs TL experience soon but if we can squeak into playoffs that will be good."

Cloud9,38xx1q,gingerfr0,2,Sun Jun 7 20:16:56 2015 UTC,Hai endured months of that circle jerking without it going anywhere the thing that eventually made him go was his medical problems.

Cloud9,38xx1q,Pedarsen,17,Sun Jun 7 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"They took incarnati0n for his solo-q skills, and because he had far less competitive experience. The goal is to mold him to be the mid-laner we need. His on stage laning is getting better. His team fighting will get better as he gets more scrims and games on stage.   The big concern is shot calling. Early game was better, but there have been lots of neutral objective fights, or rushes that make me yell when they go for them..."
Cloud9,38xx1q,TheWillRogers,3,Sun Jun 7 20:10:38 2015 UTC,"Much better early game, but then we collapsed in all other areas. Never imagined losing hai would be so detrimental."
Cloud9,38xx1q,jloysnenph,6,Sun Jun 7 20:02:58 2015 UTC,"I must say that the early game was really good. Thats the good thing. The issue is the shotcalling, that dragon fight that turned the game was SO BAD. The casters were talking about this after the game, what is going on aside from Meteos being the head shotcaller? Is the rest of the team feeding him the appropriate information? Is there a secondary shotcaller who is assisting in bouncing off ideas for what to do next?  I want to believe but if things dont start to turn around by week 4 we might have to really worry"
Cloud9,38xx1q,Bloodtotem193,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:11:47 2015 UTC,"Yea I think that'll be the deciding time for me as well. If C9 is still looking this shaky by then, I'll be worried. For now, I'm cautiously optimistic. We DID look better today."
Cloud9,38xx1q,rogue252,4,Mon Jun 8 00:45:29 2015 UTC,"Whoever the c9 analysts are and whoever has final say in pick and bans is doing a terrible job. If you compare TSM's caoching staff, C9's is non existant.   Haiforheadcoach"
Cloud9,38xx1q,Tominater85,2,Sun Jun 7 20:23:38 2015 UTC,"Isn't it Charlie? I was so angry after the P/B phase. They passed on Rumble to pick Gragas. They picked Azir blind while Leblanc was still up. Ever since coaches were allowed to weigh in on champion select, I thought that the reason C9 looked bad in P/B was because everyone caught up. Now I'm starting to think they've actually gotten worse as well. To compound this, it seems like they have a very predictable early game strategy. Everyone else seems to mind game them. Yes, this game was an improvement, but Meteos still got three buffed."
Cloud9,38xx1q,Aiendar1,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:55:45 2015 UTC,"I think we all agree the picks and bans have been terrible recently. If it was up to me,  If they wanted the Azir, they should have gone with the nunu 100%. Nunu ult would have also been great in the fights vs sivir ult. Would have aslo secured dragons faster avoiding rumble.  Also cloud9 really likes to lane swap, but have you ever seen them 5 man into the enemy jungle and get deep ward vision? Rarely.   They tilted harder than my flaccid dick after watching that game. Coach needs to make the team environment stable and perfect which explains the success of Finattic and TSM."
Cloud9,38xx1q,Tominater85,12,Sun Jun 7 21:18:25 2015 UTC,I really don't know what to say.  This team looks completely lost.
Cloud9,38xx1q,Jorojr,8,Sun Jun 7 20:02:03 2015 UTC,Team looked fine before the dragon. They look discouraged after that fight. Gotta grind it through.
Cloud9,38xx1q,wkong3,5,Sun Jun 7 20:44:35 2015 UTC,Much better early game but now we failed at the late game decisions. We are taking steps in the right direction but still a while to go!
Cloud9,38xx1q,Pedarsen,3,Sun Jun 7 20:11:53 2015 UTC,Why is balls building armor against a heavy AP comp! !
Cloud9,38xx1q,Axyx,3,Sun Jun 7 20:18:38 2015 UTC,They did great early game.  Glad that Meteos visited lanes and early rotations were good.  The dragon fight they lost from bad positioning put TIP from 2k gold down to 5k gold up.  It was over then.  Hoping they learn from that.  No way they're going to fight or catch Leblanc and they couldn't force a 4v5 due to Janna disengage and Sivir wave clear.
Cloud9,38xx1q,Battle_Toaster,3,Sun Jun 7 20:22:26 2015 UTC,"Yup..... Cloud9 looks worse than they ever have at this point. I'm not confident in their ability to pull ahead this split. Of course C9 will still be number one in my heart, but I have a feeling it'll be a few months before they look anything like the C9 with Hai."
Cloud9,38xx1q,samsolo97,3,Sun Jun 7 20:49:08 2015 UTC,"I think that Cloud9 still has this. They fell this badly last split and everybody was wondering whether Cloud9 would fall down into 6th instead of return to form. It'll take a week or two, but Cloud9 will definitely return to their form. This was a good start, they didn't lose the early game so hard and only lost the mid game based on little vision control and not respecting XWX's LeBlanc.   Gotta have faith though. If you don't have faith, why are you here?"
Cloud9,38xx1q,Razgrizacez,3,Sun Jun 7 20:55:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not that impressed with Incarnation. His early game has become a lot better, but he's late to a lot of the fights which is really bad considering they're putting him on carry mids, he really needs to step  it up and get on the same page. Also, if you're going to play Azir, learn how to defend with him, he was doing zero zoning with his soldiers. That dragon fight was very bad on his behalf.  Then there's balls. First item Frozen heart vs a very heavy AP team. It seems like he's on auto pilot and on tilt or something, because honestly I expect better from balls.  Meteos looks like he's still trying figure out the balance between being the active jungler he wants to be and doing shot calling. Honestly, I wouldn't mind if he farmed more to concentrate more on shot calling, but only if he controls vision better and is there for the counter ganks.  Overall, the team seems to have a lot of work to do, but I'm still confident that they will be able to pull it together, it's still only week 2 with the new roster, so long as they don't tilt, we should be okay in the long run."
Cloud9,38xx1q,synackSA,4,Mon Jun 8 18:01:56 2015 UTC,"They looked just as bad this time last year with their only win on 1-3 when Piglet forgot his masteries (or runes?). It's def not over, but theres a lot of work left. To me the biggest worry is actually Charlie. The early game has looked bad (it wasn't that great today - we salvaged it with the dragon though overall kind of lost it).  I think Charlie has been pretty bad at team comps, vs Dig and vs Gravity I felt we lost picks and bans really hard. This game we left Rumble on the table for Gragas (yeah okay)."
Cloud9,38xx1q,thezaitseb,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:06:47 2015 UTC,"Charlie sucks. I don't know why he is a coach on that team. He's hurting the team at the pick and ban phase. Their comps are always outclassed so far, and that's a huge problem. He allowed Balls to pick Mao over Rumble today... What?"
Cloud9,38xx1q,ObamaAteMyChicken,4,Sun Jun 7 20:17:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah no Rumble ban and they first pick Gragas, non-carry champ for c9. You can't be using a first pick as a take away, jesus. TiP won picks and bans right there. Charlie's love of Gragas cost them a real shot in the finals last split too. I don't get why he is obsessed with the champ, it doesn't fit their style."
Cloud9,38xx1q,thezaitseb,2,Sun Jun 7 20:31:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think Charlie actually makes that call.  I asked Hai abt prioritizing Gragas over Sej in g2 of the TSM series in the finals. He said that Meteos was worried abt the Gragas from Santorin. I think Charlie works as a mediator, but I don't think he's dictating picks."
Cloud9,38xx1q,WebLlama,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:29:06 2015 UTC,"Quite possible, I know Hai mentioned it in his AMA that Meteos liked Gragas over Sej, but they made a big deal out of Charlie having final say, so it does ultimately fall on him if it's true."
Cloud9,38xx1q,thezaitseb,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:16:36 2015 UTC,"True, but I think it's good he trusts his players instincts.  Personally? I've really liked every draft this season. I thought we always came away with a comp we could win with, but we haven't executed."
Cloud9,38xx1q,WebLlama,2,Mon Jun 8 03:29:40 2015 UTC,So you liked the draft against Dig with Ashe + Kog? I guess we'll just have to disagree.
Cloud9,38xx1q,thezaitseb,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:42:01 2015 UTC,"I see the downsides, but the comp has pretty sick kite. Lay down the Kog slow, use the Ashe slow, put the box down in the middle, and attack move backward. Meanwhile you've got a knockup in Rek and a root in Mao for peel and lockdown.  The problem there to me wasn't the comp. It was they horrendously misplayed the Ashe lane."
Cloud9,38xx1q,WebLlama,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:23:37 2015 UTC,But Zak can jump over the Kog slow and then hold them in place till the carries get there...
Cloud9,38xx1q,thezaitseb,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:23:57 2015 UTC,"Ashe + Kog isn't necessarily horrible because CLG pulled it off pretty well, but drafting that when the Kali, Naut, and Zac have been locked in is really risky. On top of that, C9's early game was shit there. Sneaky's positioning in lane, lack of early game wards, etc. C9 looked more like then underestimated DIG which is what lost them the game."
Cloud9,38xx1q,Amsement,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:47:56 2015 UTC,"And that underestimation started in champ select with the last pick Ashe. They hesitated on it (from what it looked like) cause they probably knew it was bad and they still went with it (maybe cause they were just playing Dig - who knows). They picked Kog first probably to say 'We can Juggermaw here' but Dig called them out on it knowing they wanted to put Kog mid and c9 just went with it anyways. Dunno who's call it was on the last pick Ashe, Sneaky or Charlie but if Charlie is goign to claim to have final say, he let the rest of the team down by going with that comp."
Cloud9,38xx1q,thezaitseb,0,Tue Jun 9 05:58:26 2015 UTC,"I honestly have only seen a degradation of strategy since Charlie joined the scene. Now I'm not saying it's because of him, as it was probably a contribution of many factors. But I think the players aren't getting enough input as to the strategy or team comps they want to play. Their strengths aren't being taken into account and it's damaging their play."
Cloud9,38xx1q,gingerfr0,2,Sun Jun 7 20:15:08 2015 UTC,"The picks have certainly been worse, theres no question in that. It helped team morale in that the team didn't blame lemon if he lost picks and bans, but it didn't help the team actually earn stronger team comps."
Cloud9,38xx1q,thezaitseb,2,Sun Jun 7 20:29:57 2015 UTC,Boy...this is ugly.
Cloud9,38xx1q,landoindisguise,2,Sun Jun 7 20:01:18 2015 UTC,"Man it really shows the absence of Hai, incarnati0n is doing better mechanically abit but man the team seems crippled without Hai's shotcalling, hope meteos learns quickly"
Cloud9,38xx1q,NordischKatze,2,Sun Jun 7 21:29:05 2015 UTC,"I love you guys. We are all supporting our team no matter what and that's the way it should be.

Cloud9,38xx1q,Cptsaber44,2,Mon Jun 8 02:48:27 2015 UTC,"The teamfighting at dragon was really bad and ultimately cost them the game. I like the progress though, early game looked better than the last. Hopefully they keep improving."
Cloud9,38xx1q,IreliasMyWaifu,2,Mon Jun 8 16:23:12 2015 UTC,Why didnt they fp rumble?? All balls knows how to play is rumble. Sigh.
Cloud9,38xx1q,OmegaApple,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:04:10 2015 UTC,"I was wondering that too. They could've gotten him, but gave him to TIP..."
Cloud9,38xx1q,Gobizku,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:08:28 2015 UTC,"I imagine TIP had both a strategy to deal with rumble and a strategy to pick rumble.  If C9 picks rumble first, that gives TIP an entire pick phase to counter it.  Conversely, if the TIP gets it, it's unlikely C9 had a strategy to specifically counter it."
Cloud9,38xx1q,Rozez,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:22:52 2015 UTC,"Rush is a beast on junglers on aggro champs, and it just so happens gragas gets to do that and scale into a late game cinderhulk monster. C9 purposefully took the gragas away from Rush."
Cloud9,38xx1q,ObamaAteMyChicken,0,Sun Jun 7 20:28:23 2015 UTC,"He probably wanted to, but Charlie had one of his great team comp ideas. I really don't know what that guy does for the team, but it seems like nothing. He's the main voice in champ select and allowed Balls to pick Mao over Rumble? What in the fuck..."

Cloud9,38xx1q,yoonaya,10,Sun Jun 7 20:05:05 2015 UTC,Hai can't continue playing because of his wrists.
Cloud9,38xx1q,julioquasar,2,Sun Jun 7 20:07:15 2015 UTC,One change caused this sort of disjointed team. Now you propose three more changes. They made the decision and just need time and experience to get back to being on top.
Cloud9,38xx1q,Hameli0,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:09:04 2015 UTC,Support don't really need the same amout of Mecanics as a midlaner. Hai were just a perfect fit for C9 when he used to roam/ward and have his insane shotcall sense.  Lemon is well known as the brain maker. Both of them are fitted for those roles.
Cloud9,38xx1q,ObamaAteMyChicken,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:16:20 2015 UTC,Yes please. Charlie is fucking terrible. Telling Balls to play Maokai over fucking Rumble?
Cloud9,38xx1q,Hameli0,2,Sun Jun 7 20:15:28 2015 UTC,Balls making a FH over LB Seiju Rumble wasnt that smart either.
Cloud9,38xw4p,Erickjmz,11,Sun Jun 7 19:52:50 2015 UTC,"I don't really think that game was on him. Sneaky gave a kill to XWX then Balls gave him a kill both doing very dumb things, XWX started to snowball the game because of them and then we lost because the team chose to play for dragon (and gave rumble a ton of farm to get it despite him having TP as well), which resulted in sneaky face tanking Sejuani."
Cloud9,38xw4p,thezaitseb,2,Sun Jun 7 20:01:50 2015 UTC,"The dragon fight onward he (incarnati0n) played the team fights really bad, especially the baron fight. It was a team effort to throw the game but incarnati0n doesn't get off either."
Cloud9,38xw4p,XTartarusX,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:11:28 2015 UTC,"The dragon fight was game over, they were 3k up and ended up 9k down in the spawn of a few minutes. Meteos has a bit to learn still...One fight shouldn't swing the game that much...and if it has the chance to, you don't take it."
Cloud9,38xw4p,thezaitseb,7,Sun Jun 7 20:28:40 2015 UTC,Tbh I feel its not even so much of incarnati0n underperforming that game but c9 shotcalling and decision making look insanely questionable. A lot of the rotations or teamfights look chaotic and not in sync.
Cloud9,38xw4p,Sparkaton,3,Sun Jun 7 20:01:53 2015 UTC,"Incarnati0n had AWFUL ults with azir. The teamfight that C9 lost around dragon, he was useless and flashed away to still die(choke flash). Then when they went for the baron He literally throw the tanks right the front of sneaky."
Cloud9,38xw4p,DeceiverSC2,2,Sun Jun 7 20:07:37 2015 UTC,He did win the first dragon (TIP had already killed the drag) fight with a good Azir ult.
Cloud9,38xw4p,Sparkaton,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:26:44 2015 UTC,"Again i dont think it was just him to blame for that. His initial positioning when the fight broke out was yes bad, However, that should have been a better setup for c9. They focused dragon after impact started his tp and the collapse was coming from both sides forcing them into the entrance to dragon pit. Meanwhile, drag was still around 1600-2000 health. It mean nothing to try to burst it down and turn for a teamfight because then they would've had no spell rotations. Therefore, as soon as sej was moving closer they should've expected a rumble tp and turn immediately. It was the game turning fight but a team doesn't really get ace'd and not get at least a few kills back because of one person messing up."
Cloud9,38xw4p,Ghostkill221,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:13:38 2015 UTC,"It's also the shotcallers job to tell the team when to start positioning around an area for fights. If inc was slow, that was on him but if he didn't get the message in enough time than it's not."
Cloud9,38xw4p,kripis,7,Mon Jun 8 20:15:26 2015 UTC,"its less about incarnati0n really, more about shotcalling itself, sure incarnati0n aint hai, he don't ward sides, he don't roam, basicaly he has no impact early game...  c9 baron attemt? was good idea, besides maybe do it when lb is taking inhib, isntead of waiting till she finished and then go for it, and they had that information, they were just dancing around and when lb started to walk back they decide to go for baron...  sure early game was decent, but this split c9 has huge problems, it looks too big to fix them so easy"
Cloud9,38xw4p,Ghostkill221,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:03:08 2015 UTC,It's odd. C9 used to force those type of calls from enemies. And always won that way.
Cloud9,38xw4p,DeceiverSC2,0,Mon Jun 8 20:16:06 2015 UTC,I think that's a team decision though with Incarnati0n having no impact early game.  He was famed in EU for being crazy aggressive all the time so I'm just assuming that the team is telling him to focus on utility based midlaners.
Cloud9,38xw4p,vGhostiev,2,Mon Jun 8 12:27:38 2015 UTC,"yeah, I was really excited for Incarnati0n knowing that it would be a slow start, but seeing how good Pob is doing makes me think what if?"

C9 put themselves into this hole. Sad thing was that this game vs tip everyone played well up until the time when they just let rush walk in and sej ult sneaky at melee range. sad game.
Cloud9,38xw4p,chalupa699,2,Sun Jun 7 19:55:49 2015 UTC,"Jack preferred Incarnati0n over Pob.  c9 has been the team in recent years to underperform, and then win almost all games"
Cloud9,38xw4p,Joolazoo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:02:09 2015 UTC,"I'm a CLG fan (You can read my recent posts in CLG subreddit), but C9 wasn't dumb for taking incarnation. Pobelter has a history of being the mid laner on horrible teams. THat's not the kind of player you replace your shot caller and all star mid laner with. Everyone thought incarnation would be amazing."
Cloud9,38xw4p,bolofoo,0,Sun Jun 7 20:00:40 2015 UTC,"No pobelter has had a history of being a mid laner who had horrible teams around him. Plus c9 was dumpstering kids when they had pobelter on their team. And pobelter was doing better than incarnation even when he played in clg. Dude even yusui outperformed incarnation in scrims, c9 still ended up going with incarnation for whatever reason. Just sad."
Cloud9,38xw4p,Joolazoo,2,Sun Jun 7 20:03:30 2015 UTC,"People always choose which of those two they want to pick. If they like the player, their team is the reason they suck, if they don't like them, they are the reason they suck. Believe me, as a CLG fan I know how this rotation on blame works. Almost no one was talking positively about POB before this split. It's easy to play Monday morning quarterback and pretend as if Incarnation was obviously an inferior pick to POB. IIRC almost everyone on the CLG subreddit was annoyed that CLG couldn't get incarnation, and the view on Pobelter wasn't positive at all until the season started. There were many threads with mixed feelings about whether Pobelter was even better than link."
Cloud9,38xw4p,bolofoo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:33:24 2015 UTC,"I've always been huge on pobelter dude. I've never been a proponent of the belief that a player cant be good on a bad team. I've always believed in pobelter and altec, and I really wanted him on c9!!"

Cloud9,38xw4p,Delay559,2,Sun Jun 7 20:07:45 2015 UTC,"Thats a risk C9 is taking and knows, like they said many times they prefered incarnati0n because they can mold him into what they want from the team instead of POB or yusui which are already established and would need the team to work around them. Will the risk pay off? time will tell, but 2 weeks and 4 BO1's in, of course its looking bad, just a question of getting better."
Cloud9,38xw4p,bolofoo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:57:01 2015 UTC,"How are pob and yusui established??? What do you even mean by that? Can you please elaborate on that point? Why do you think that pobelter and yusui, young players who are similarly mechanically strong to incarnation, would not be able to adapt to c9's style of play when they were able to when they were scrimming? You realize that c9 did worse in scrims with incarnation compared to their other tryouts?"
Cloud9,38xw4p,Delay559,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:20:43 2015 UTC,"I meant as in their playstyle, the way they like to do things. Theyve been on teams before and have learnt how to team play in their teams/in their way. Even though C9 did do better with POB in scrims, they wanted someone they could mold, that had no previous team experience, a blank slate if you will. Incarnati0n is that, since hes never had to be on a team C9 can mold him into a C9 midlaner, if they had taken POB that would have been harder and theyd have to play around POB style more, incarnati0n has no style.  This isnt coming from me btw, this is from meteos/incarnati0n/balls/sneakys streams when people asked them why they didnt choose POB."

So as much as i want to think that they really did think about the other players in the tryouts, the decision was probably already made."
Cloud9,38xw4p,bolofoo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:14:25 2015 UTC,"Yea which in hindsight was stupid. They got stuck in the sunk cost fallacy, should have gone for pobelter or perhaps even yusui."
Cloud9,38xw4p,bolofoo,0,Sun Jun 7 20:17:54 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that Incarnati0n is a better player than Pobelter, he is a fucking beast mechanically, I've been watching his games for a long time and he has a lot of outplay potential, he is one of those players who can make fast decisions that ends up in amazing plays. The problem is that he hasn't made it on the stage. The only game that he looked well was against TSM and it was just that he played Kog'maw, got crushed in lane and then out scaled TSM really hard. I still think he is a beast, but I believe he choking so hard."
Cloud9,38xw4p,enyaliustv,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:02:41 2015 UTC,"LOL. As if pobelter isn't a fucking beast mechanically??? did you even watch pobelter in kr solo q and what he did against top tier kr mid laners? Mechanics isn't pobelters problems. Idk how you can just say  shit like ""I know incarnation has better mechanics""."
Cloud9,38xw4p,Docnasty8404,-2,Sun Jun 7 20:04:43 2015 UTC,"Pob has mechanics, thats for damn sure, but hes not even close to Incarnati0n. Let Incarnati0n play KR SoloQ and see what happens. You gotta open your eyes. You are just on the Incarnati0n hate train simply cuz of poor TEAM performance and it hurts to read comments like yours."

Its our first roster line up change and both mid laners have very different styles. Give the team some time to adapt and they will pull through"
Cloud9,38u3h9,Asentry_,-1,Sat Jun 6 21:03:46 2015 UTC,we can support and criticize what is wrong. Obviously there are some issues and they can grow and there still is time. But grav and dig losses are pretty bad.

Cloud9,38u3h9,StephentheGinger,0,Sun Jun 7 00:01:21 2015 UTC,"Idk man. I really don't know. last year c9 had a shaky start, But they still had good early game, and they actually lost later parts of the game.   Jatt would point out how they would manage laneswaps very well, and come out with leads on balls (balls getting cs up).   This season they are just straight up losing.   I mean historically, teams that have roster swaps usually have immediate improvement, or they don't make much of a change/or worse all together. - If you reasonably go through all the teams in your head since season 3 (or from even seaosn 2), you can list off in your head roster swaps that work out perfectly from the start, or roster swaps that just fail. I haven't seen yet a roster that, swaps players, then has a shaky start, then picks it up to their fullest ""potential"" yet. The closest example is gambit gaming, when alex/genja/darien were replaced, and even THEY still ended up changing rosters AGAIN.   I'm still going to be a c9 fan because they changed the way on how i view the game, but I'll be surprised if they make top 5 this split.  Also, if you remember what hai said in his last interview review his life as a pro, he said that meteos did not favor mid lane attention in this meta, and  hai did. If people are going to keep tilting incarnation, like what keane just did. he's going to fold before he reaches week 6."

I want this team to get comfortable and improve. I don't expect immediate results because a pretty big change in the mid lane and terms of shotcalling. You just gotta stick with, you cant be a real fan for starting to doubt them after 3 games, gravity is a team that did get better, we beat Tsm and maybe the dignitas was a hiccup but oh well, teams will lose and will win but as long as this line up learns and starts to polish up their play then all will be well, you just gotta be patient, a 2 year line up that just recently experienced a new change in midlaner and shotcaller will be hard to replicate good immediate results. All we can do is give our support and patience to the C9 players."

No, because they are not good at the game, and because of that, no one watches them.    this team has shown none of the qualities old c9 or even quantic has.  Before Quantic even got in the LCS they were stomping LCS teams in scrims.   The decision making of this team is awful.  Even after that ugly TSM win, they looked very bad."

So what about fnatic, Origen TSM that immediately swapped out gleeb for lustboy, Gambit swapping out for Betsy to go on a 7 game win streak, World Elite who at the last minute swapped rosters to beat GE tigers, and get better in their own split. And so on, i can name alot more teams who had roster swaps, and had the same/less amount of time c9 did to prep with incarnation, and do well almost right away.   In league, there's team that click, and if the right 5 people are together, they can dominate.   If you look at things objectively, teams don't improve as the split goes on after major roster swaps, because other teams are improving as well.   Idc if c9 loses or wins, what matters more is how they lose/win.  their 3 games, they seemed very off, like they're not even playing.   Also, it doesn't make sense to me. Maybe im biased that i want Hai to stay on the team, but right now, it just seems like their in the same position as they are with hai, and they're ""working kinks out"" .. I guess hai's wrists were bothering him also, but i really don't know. Guess we'll have to wait."

It looks like most of C9 is learning how to transition in to a new team without Hai. Keep in mind, Hai was way more then just a shot caller to C9. I really think they need to get comfortable with the shot calling and comfortable with Incarnation. ATM he has 0 presence, which i'm thinking is about 50% his fault. Meteos's shot calling is really unsuccessful. I truely hope he is simply learning what works for his team and what doesn't. Honestly C9's best hopes rely on playing together as a team in scrims and soloQ till something breaks, either them or this grade school team awkwardness that plaques them now. Lets face it, C9's biggest weapon was their coordination."

That lane swap fucked up their early game, red stolen + tower all thanks to the lane swap. After that ryze gets almost NO farm while maokai is farming up a strom and incarnation is losing the farm game in mid. He is 10~ cs down even before the gank.  I don't know what they are doing, it feels as if they are playing scared, why is that? I want meteos to start picking aggressive jungles, I want lane pressure in the early game, come on boys."

Cloud9,38xx1r,shadowofdeath13,7,Sun Jun 7 19:59:52 2015 UTC,How did he lose every game? His worst game so far was the game we won. Last game was Meteos being greedy and taking wolves which left Balls out to dry on getting the big wave (and super far behind). This game was Sneaky getting caught out and giving away pressure (which allowed Rumble to get back into the game).
Cloud9,38xx1r,thezaitseb,-7,Sun Jun 7 20:04:34 2015 UTC,Did you see the team fights? That dragon fight he didn't peel at all. The casters just said it all
Cloud9,38xx1r,thezaitseb,9,Sun Jun 7 20:11:20 2015 UTC,"The dragon fight in which TiP attacked from 3 sides? Yeah that was all on one player not peeling properly. ""The caster"" aka Jatt has a habit of picking the storyline before the match and then twisting everything to fit that storyline. He was blaming Incarnati0n for everything and giving other players free passes. He said that TiP was hiding in the brush and thats the only reason Sneaky got caught and killed (his first death) then when replay showed there was a ward he admitted it was a bad play. With Incarnati0n he does the opposite, assumes bad play. Watch Sneaky's positioning in that fight...please go watch it...picking on one person for that disaster...yeah okay. Pretty much everyone played it poorly but Meteos (who moved into to block Sej ult which Sneaky found away to get into anyways). You shouldn't really use Captain Bias as a source..."
Cloud9,38xx1r,Komparativist,0,Sun Jun 7 20:24:18 2015 UTC,jatt is shockingly poor caster
Cloud9,38xx1r,TheWillRogers,5,Fri Jun 12 15:50:40 2015 UTC,"They took incarnati0n for his solo-q skills, and because he had far less competitive experience. The goal is to mold him to be the mid-laner we need. His on stage laning is getting better. His team fighting will get better as he gets more scrims and games on stage.   The big concern is shot calling. Early game was better, but there have been lots of neutral objective fights, or rushes that make me yell when they go for them..."
Cloud9,38xx1r,ventsol,10,Sun Jun 7 20:10:19 2015 UTC,Calm down. C9 had a bad start last split as well.
Cloud9,38xx1r,ObamaAteMyChicken,4,Sun Jun 7 20:03:02 2015 UTC,"This is completely different. They are completely lost and don't know what they're doing. They're also not on the same page, EVER. They're failing hard in team-fights and with rotations. Last split was the same team that won LCS Splits, and you could still see flashes of them, but they were just being inconsistent. I don't see how they improve this split and in the upcoming weeks. It's really really bad."

I think everyone should just take one step back, relax and watch as C9 wins playoffs.  Also, I disagree on the Pob > Incarnati0n.

Cloud9,38fh2s,LuckMaker,18,Wed Jun 3 21:32:02 2015 UTC,Have said this since we got new mid it's going to take some time. New shotcaller and learning how to play with new mid and the midlaner has never played at this level before. I have faith that we will be where we need to by end of season but I expect some bad performances to accompany the growing pains.
Cloud9,38fh2s,Bennyboozle,5,Wed Jun 3 21:34:27 2015 UTC,"Incarnati0n also has a lot of hype behind him. I cannot imagine the weight on his shoulders to perform. It has to be stressing him some. I don't know if you watched the interview with Kiwikid and Travis, but I think Kiwikid was right about Incarnati0n just wanting to play League.  It will take time."
Cloud9,38fh2s,Ace_Machine,8,Wed Jun 3 21:47:31 2015 UTC,"It was more of a case of a bad draft (C9s comp had very little mobility against such a strong AOE, CC, Dive comp from DIG) and DIG knew what their advantage was and how to play it. I say the only real mistake about this game (not talking about in game decisions which we know were bad and will take time to improve) was not letting Incarnati0n play a mechanically inclined assassin, you'd think against DIG (who is touted as a low tier team, no offense) they'd let him show off his carry prowess instead of just sticking him on a late game scaling champ like Kog'maw. This is just my opinion on something that could've been done outside the game that I would've liked to see and that could've prevented such a strong counter comp from DIG."
Cloud9,38fh2s,F1R3BL00D,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:54:34 2015 UTC,C9 picked same Mid/ADC as CLG who rekked DIG. That was such a stupid move to think they will make the same mistake twice.
Cloud9,38fh2s,Hameli0,3,Fri Jun 5 21:26:36 2015 UTC,I simply think the Ashe pick was baited out and C9 was punished for it. Hopefully they learn from the experience and it doesn't happen again.
Cloud9,38fh2s,Integralds,4,Thu Jun 4 02:26:03 2015 UTC,"The main problem i have with Week 1 is that we saw Incarnati0n play the same champion 2 games in a row. I wonder if it was just him being scared to try something else or the team going with what worked the other day, which would be an issue since it didnt really work.  To be worried at this point is a little pointless since we only have 2 games to go off of, but if this trend continues for multiple weeks then i would be worried."

Cloud9,38fh2s,Novarix,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:23:49 2015 UTC,"Just believe man. Not in blind faith, but our meme-lords.   But srs, play-offs will decide, C9 can and will place in top 3 maybe come first if they realize that Incarnati0n completely shitfaces on anyone when he's on assassins. Like. Completely. It's scary watching him in soloqueue."
Cloud9,38fh2s,waddles42,0,Fri Jun 5 22:33:35 2015 UTC,"Nah no worries. I think they will still be around top 3 as long as Incarnation can chill and get over his nerves as well as Meteos having more decisive calls.  If they keep beating the top teams, they'll be fine. I remember when TSM got bjerg and it wasnt until the end of spring 2014 did they do ""ok"" and landed top 2. Then in summer 2014 they placed 1st. C9 can do it, we gotta have faith."

Cloud9,38dwb0,gamestar_21,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:31:17 2015 UTC,"Taking a look at both the accounts there are some interesting similarities and differences between the two. One important similiarity is that incarnation has flash on d which is there on both accounts, the runes that c9 jensen runs are the same ones that are on c9 incarnation(idk how significant this is). The mmr for c9 jensen seems to be about the same for c9 incarnation seeing the people that both accounts played with and against. One difference that confuses me is that incarnation(the person) usually only has one mastery page but the c9 jensen account has 6 mastery pages.  so yeah, idk if c9 jensen is actually him or not, that's just what i found after a few minutes of searching. Hope it helped!"

Cloud9,38bhcs,mayank27tiwary,4,Wed Jun 3 14:45:38 2015 UTC,Maokai fits into the playstyle of C9 a lot of the time so they would need to pull out some other comps that work together. I don't think they're are that many other scaling tanks like maokai that he can play at the moment so it is on balls to expand to something else though I'm unsure what it would be.
Cloud9,38bhcs,jkallaround,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:42:14 2015 UTC,"yeah i totally agree, not sure what else would fit the role that maokai brings, but i really feel like its up to C9 and balls to figure it out. I feel like other teams have adapted playing against it by now."
Cloud9,38bhcs,BittenBySleep,3,Wed Jun 3 05:56:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's just an extremely reliable team pick for all pros right now, not just Balls. The change to his ult was a huge pick up for the Warrior enchant meta when junglers had the damage to jump on you, but maybe not the survivability. Now, in the cinderhulk meta, it's even better for keeping your tanks healthy as well as giving the enemy a frontline they can't really ignore. He's been a contested pick since IEM San Jose (or even before, IIRC)."

Cloud9,38bhcs,Amsement,2,Thu Jun 4 03:13:01 2015 UTC,"His Hecarim and Irelia were beast mode when he played them and his Gnar improved with each game. A lot of his comfort picks aren't very strong atm, but Shyvana getting a nice buff which may make her meta again. I'd like to see him on Irelia, Hec. and Gnar again though. The Maokai is really stale and he can't carry on it if he does well in lane, but the other lanes aren't doing so hot."

It's alright, C9 will come back, I know that will happen, Meteos will work on his shot calling and we'll see the old Cloud9 back in form."
Cloud9,38025m,Razgrizacez,3,Sun May 31 21:17:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with the first part, I wish we could have gotten the viktor out of Jensen, that would have been fun"
Cloud9,38025m,gamestar_21,6,Sun May 31 22:22:26 2015 UTC,"Sneaky and Lemon played that lane too aggressive with too little ward coverage, could have been countered by meteos not playing so passive, but he opted to farm instead and as counter balance C9 gave incarnation a really weak early game mid laner...what?  Yeah, this draft combined with the early game strategy was very exploitable and DIG did just that, they exploited them hard.  After that, DIG just choked them out of the game slowly. No real comeback opportunity, maybe a risky baron all in but besides that, nothing was left for C9. Really stupid early game plan and well executed ganks for DIG."
Cloud9,38025m,CertusAT,2,Sun May 31 21:37:06 2015 UTC,"This is what I have a problem with. Between Rek'sai and Ashe, they should have had NO problems with ganks and getting vision, but as it was pointed out on stream, they really didn't use the vision correctly on Ashe and Meteos was way to busy farming."
Cloud9,38025m,synackSA,5,Tue Jun 2 16:15:59 2015 UTC,"Dig's Azingy played really well, and Meteos definitely should've played better. I say this game's a good learning experience for our new team shotcaller."
Cloud9,38025m,kroncw,4,Sun May 31 21:20:15 2015 UTC,Probably shouldn't pick a bot lane that is vulnerable early if Meteos is planning on only farming. DIG exploited that well with Zac. I think Balls and incarnati0n played well
Cloud9,38025m,Battle_Toaster,3,Sun May 31 21:22:39 2015 UTC,i thought meteos could have came top after sneaky and lemon got ganked the first time. at least he could have cleared the wards or something. but nope he just went back to farming
Cloud9,38025m,richards2kreider,3,Mon Jun 1 00:58:34 2015 UTC,Only farming on Reksai ... so fucking bad lol
Cloud9,38025m,PershingSt,3,Mon Jun 1 00:03:03 2015 UTC,"Better get the losses out of the way early than late in the season when we're fighting for playoff positioning. I stated in a different thread that Meteos needs to learn how to shotcall when really far behind, so hopefully they can take this week to learn from this game. Wp by DIG."
Cloud9,38025m,arvinarvin,3,Sun May 31 21:20:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah pretty bad Idea picking Ashe last pick with that comp, Looked like Sneaky was half asleep all game going Melee range a lot then prolly tilted. Good thing this happened thought great learning experience :)"
Cloud9,38025m,vGhostiev,2,Sun May 31 21:30:34 2015 UTC,"Ashe kog against zac was really no good, wasn't feeling that draft"
Cloud9,38025m,Cptsaber44,2,Sun May 31 21:15:08 2015 UTC,It's OK games like these are actually great to learn from because you can clearly see what mistakes you made and what the enemy team did well. WP Dig
Cloud9,38025m,Crazzluz,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:53:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think much can be pulled from this game. Azingy had some really solid ganks to completely shut down Sneaky and get CoreJJ rolling, and they snowballed the game off that. It was WP by Dignitas and a good learning experience for Meteos on learning to shotcall from behind, but it's certainly not anything more than that."
Cloud9,38025m,OmegaApple,-3,Mon Jun 1 01:06:56 2015 UTC,c9 plays so fucking passive holy shit. Incarnati0n their assassin player on a passive champ?? Meteos you need to fucking do something in the early game stop farming jesus christ. Im very angry just knowing that these passive na teams are going to get shit on by eu and other teams.

Cloud9,37zz6z,IreliasMyWaifu,3,Sun May 31 21:21:46 2015 UTC,"Clearly, the real issue was the hawkshots...."
Cloud9,37zz6z,w0ok,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:47:16 2015 UTC,"That's so true, I feel like Sneaky didn't use them to her full potential. The global hawkshot can give the team so much vision over the map, but Sneaky was like ""nah I'll just take a look at this bush here mmm yeah dat bush"""
Cloud9,37zz6z,theggthdoctor,5,Mon Jun 1 02:00:19 2015 UTC,"C9 picks and bans.......it's like giving a crackhead a pound of crack and telling him not to smoke it.   Their picks/bans are so predictable......so bad. I don't understand why they can't adapt and change what they're doing after being bitten in the ass countless times......especially in international play.  Balls has been counter picked in 99% of their games for the past year and people wonder why he isn't carrying games anymore. He played Hecarim 1 game and totally carried on it. Dyrus played it once and fed his ass off......yet they ban it.  They don't flex pick anything. They refuse to counter pick mid like every single other good team does when they can, especially on red side. It's like they are still stuck in their ways of a ""priority pick/ban system"" that they used before teams learned the importance of it 2 years ago.   Why first pick Reksai when Meteos hardly ever ganks early?   Why pick Kogmaw in the 2nd rotation only to last pick Ashe.....? If you're going to pick Ashe even with the Zac/Kalista why save it for last pick???? If you saved mid for last pick.....you could pick Cass to counter Vlad and completely shit on him.   You have a superstar mid laner.....let him play. You don;t have to hide your mid laner like you have in the past. Play different champions to counter your opponents (not just for shits).  I'm just baffled that they don't get someone or something to at least help with if not solve these problems that have been so familiar since Season 3 Worlds when they just couldn't ban Kassadin.   In the end, they lost this game because Lemon was awful on Thresh. He blew his flash for trying to face check a bush instead of using Lantern. He let Sneaky die twice because he threw the Lantern 200 range too short."
Cloud9,37zz6z,iwin555,2,Mon Jun 1 09:08:10 2015 UTC,"Ultimately I'm not too upset at this game, this is simply what happens when a snowball truly gets rolling (it ends up making the game look a lot worse than it actually was).  That being said, there definitely was a lack of respect for the early Zac ganks (the only part of the game he can efficiently have an impact on).  I'm sure C9 is well aware of what happened and hopefully they don't take this one too hard.  All in all, check your ego at the door and remember that you're playing Ashe/Kog.  Respect the early game, hold out to win later."
Cloud9,37zz6z,Volitaire,2,Sun May 31 21:21:40 2015 UTC,"This. My thoughts exactly. They didn't really get outplayed so much as they just didn't really play lol. No true weakness was shown, just a bad early game that got worse fast. Props to dig for not letting them find a way back."
Cloud9,37zz6z,MCXI,2,Mon Jun 1 04:19:44 2015 UTC,Hated how we did picks. Dig called us out on the willingness to flex Kog to adc...
Cloud9,37zz6z,thezaitseb,1 point,Sun May 31 23:43:59 2015 UTC,"i wish we could have grabbed naut to fuck over kalista, i feel like that might have made killing her easier assuming we didn't get dumpstered in laning phase like we did."
Cloud9,37zz6z,thezaitseb,1 point,Sun May 31 23:46:18 2015 UTC,"Think lulu in last pick was the right choice as well. Protect the adc kog, I wasn't feeling it either before the ashe pick, tbh but i flet that was the one that made the game really tough. You are also right that thresh didn't fit the comp in hindsight at the end of the draft, but early on I think it was a good pick. The kog ashe combo at 4 and 5 kind of gave me the 'Oh well. We're doing it anyways cause Dig sucks vibe.'"
Cloud9,37zz6z,Pedarsen,2,Mon Jun 1 01:09:11 2015 UTC,Expected this before the game started. DIG usually takes the first game of the season against C9. Don't read into it.

Cloud9,37zz6z,Bennyboozle,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:56:38 2015 UTC,Lemon is playing one of the worst games of his career. His Thresh looks absolutely terrible.
Cloud9,37zz6z,mcshuggets,4,Sun May 31 20:55:16 2015 UTC,"From what I can gather, he seems really inexperienced in preventing Zac ganks. Every time Zac ganked, he walked away from Sneaky to try to lantern him to safety, instead of sitting on him and flaying away Zac when he E'd in to prevent any damage or CC from coming through."
Cloud9,37zz6z,Bennyboozle,1 point,Sun May 31 21:10:18 2015 UTC,Not a very good excuse though he has played against Zac plenty of times in his career on Thresh. He missed flay early and that killed sneaky and he missed lanterns all over the place where if he just walked further the lantern would have saved teammate.
Cloud9,37zz6z,blitzKriegzzz,1 point,Sun May 31 21:16:08 2015 UTC,Meteos shouldnt pick reksai since he usually just hard farms. Sejuani was open. I also don't understand picking kog maw again when incarnation has repeatedly said he likes playing aggressive.  It seemed like C9 did not respect DiG in this game and paid for it. Playing to your opponents level shows your either not taking them seriously or aren't focused.

Cloud9,37vq28,Trazn,2,Sat May 30 20:26:51 2015 UTC,Early game Kog is like impossible to bully so wasn't too surprising. This game just told us they can stall a game and outscale if they have a better late game comp. Now let's see if they can win fights with two comps that are equal in strength at the same points in the game.
Cloud9,37vq28,Trazn,14,Sun May 31 05:50:46 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised he didn't die in lane to Bjerg. He did well in the mid-late game but I would like to see more during lane, especially against other teams."
Cloud9,37vq28,droppinbabies,10,Sat May 30 20:25:04 2015 UTC,"He knew how to play passive, which isn't something which you do see a lot in soloQ so to all the people saying he won't be able to play a team environment... Fuck them."

Cloud9,37vq28,arvinarvin,3,Sat May 30 20:37:35 2015 UTC,"One thing to remember is viktor with the upgraded E does way more damage than he should, so that had to be one of the worst lane matchups he could have had as a kog."

Cloud9,37vq28,Vaynetek,3,Sat May 30 21:56:42 2015 UTC,"Super close game, and C9 still won from a monstrous early deficit in mid lane. I expect it to only get better from here as Incarnation gains LAN experience."

Cloud9,37vq28,Kiraven,1 point,Sat May 30 20:28:11 2015 UTC,I wouldnt really say monstrous. I think the lead at its peak was something like 4k-5k. which is big in the current meta but with cloud 9's teamfight prowess and knowledge of the game isnt that big.
Cloud9,37vq28,PershingSt,1 point,Sat May 30 20:42:24 2015 UTC,I mean he was down 40 farm at like 10 min. That's a huge deficit mid and they said he was down 1.4 k gold at one point

Cloud9,37vq28,Lshrsh,3,Sat May 30 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"I say we're hella proud. He didn't die in a losing lane to, currently, the best NA midlaner.   During the early game I feel like Meteos was just wandering around aimlessly. Maybe the pressure of being the sole shotcaller for the first game was hard on him (and we won't talk about that one engage by dragon.....) but all in all, C9's teamfighting was superb, mid game rotations were very nice, and they played fairly well.   As soon as incarnati0n learns the ins and outs of playing as a team and not SoloQ I think he'll be the best mid NA and C9 will be back to being fairly dominant. The fact that they were still picking only the good teamfights, and teamfighting well without their main shotcaller was very reassuring. Also, Balls Rumble is hella OP"

Missed lots of cs before first back and kept walking into Viktor's ray. Of course he'll deal a lot of damage later, but not because of his play, but because he's Kog Maw. He started to pull his weight when the team got him back in the game. He's still super good, but needs to work on the nerves."

Cloud9,37vpxw,katnizz,9,Sun May 31 19:37:50 2015 UTC,"I won't discredit Balls, as his ults were amazing, but TSM literally asked to be ulted multiple times that game."
Cloud9,37vpxw,Trazn,5,Sat May 30 20:38:32 2015 UTC,Another play I saw was the fight before first baron where he flashed on Wildturtle. I thought that was pretty cool too. But yeah chokes=death

Those fights were similar to what Hai called. I'm glad they kept it cool, glad they're near the same exact team. Hoping for Cloud9 to retake the number one position in the LCS! :)"
Cloud9,37vpxw,arvinarvin,11,Sat May 30 20:23:10 2015 UTC,What a great game! My reaction every time TSM walked through a choke for Balls' ults or when Incarnati0n got a big hit: http://giant.gfycat.com/SaneBewitchedEasternglasslizard.gif
Cloud9,37vpxw,Ace_Machine,15,Sat May 30 20:16:55 2015 UTC,What a heart stopping game. I was on edge for so long.  Edit: great team fighting! Imagine if the lane phase had gone slightly better.
Cloud9,37vpxw,kripis,10,Sat May 30 20:14:32 2015 UTC,"totaly, incarnati0n in bad matchup, vs mvp midlaner, surely hardest game for him in this split, since its his first game in lcs overwall, his teamfighting was good tho, thats what matters the most, since c9 has allways been all about teamfighting and member synergy... im so happy that they won, in last teamfight equalizer was huge, other than that, that was pure team synergy that won the game  Edit: perfect twitter post ""not even 100 cs diffrence in midlane can make balls loose his perfect rumble record"""

Cloud9,37z45q,Gobizku,7,Sun May 31 17:24:20 2015 UTC,"TiP is looking strong.  Many other teams are trying out new players as well who will get more synergy over the course of the split.  MSI showed that TSM hasn't adapted as well to this meta either, so I see them dropping more games as well.  I don't think undefeated with a new midlaner in his first LCS split is reasonable."
Cloud9,37z45q,Androidconundrum,1 point,Sun May 31 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"I will admit, I couldn't tell if Bjerg really was shitting hard on Incarnati0n, or if he was giving Bjerg a lot of respect and playing safely, or a little of both. I guess undefeated is an overstatement, but top 2 is reasonable, no?"
Cloud9,37z45q,XstarD,4,Sun May 31 17:15:21 2015 UTC,Nervous as fuck. First game on stage. Had no flash from early on. No blue buff. He did well considering all the odds stacked against him. Undefeated is an overstatement but coming first isn't.
Cloud9,37z45q,Androidconundrum,1 point,Sun May 31 17:46:33 2015 UTC,"This roster is really talented.  If incarnation can get a little easier early game and shake the nerves and if metros can practice his shot calling we'll be in great shape.  We can definitely come in first, I just don't think its necessarily a good expectation to have, especially undefeated."
Cloud9,37z45q,NonNisiTe,3,Sun May 31 19:07:26 2015 UTC,"Every team will have a bad day versus a weak team. There is really no chance for C9 to go undefeated. Even in their prime, C9 lost 3 (25-3) games in a split. I don't see them ever losing less than that."
Cloud9,37z45q,PershingSt,2,Sun May 31 18:50:59 2015 UTC,"No incarnation was down almost 100 + cs at 20 mins , C9 was lucky to win a game that TSM basically threw ."

Cloud9,37z45q,TajMaral,1 point,Sun May 31 18:23:20 2015 UTC,If Lcs was bo3 format or even the 'bo2' format we have here in Brazil I feel we could. But with this format all it takes is a bad draft/patch and Dignitas suddenly can take a game from us.
Cloud9,37z45q,arvinarvin,1 point,Sun May 31 18:30:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, and it's not even a bad thing, we need to see how this roster deals with losses. And I'd like to see Meteos shotcall more from situations where we are behind, yesterday was a small taste of it but we had the late scaling Kog so it was just a matter of staying alive and getting farm when possible. I'd like to see how Meteos reacts to situations like the Coast game from 2014 spring where C9 was down 20 kills to 10 or something like that, and Meteos had to backdoor on Nocturne to win the game, or the games this past worlds where Hai and Balls had to keep splitpushing to stay in the game."

Cloud9,37wdkw,MCXI,2,Sun May 31 13:51:56 2015 UTC,"I love the confidence...but let's get there first, bud."
Cloud9,37wdkw,Trazn,1 point,Sun May 31 00:49:22 2015 UTC,Saying top 3 straight up might be a bit much but I feel that a little blind confidence is healthy and motavational.
Cloud9,37wdkw,MCXI,1 point,Sun May 31 13:54:47 2015 UTC,Umm who other than Bjergson do you suggest is even remotely comparable? Incarnati0n is an incredible player and NA isn't particularly deep in terms of mid lane talent.
Cloud9,37wdkw,gingerfr0,2,Sun May 31 06:47:17 2015 UTC,"We've seen him exactly once in an LCS game on a very unique champ. We can't tell yet what his lane mechanics were, and anyone is going to get great stats in the late game on Kog. It's simply too early to tell if he's even as good as Link."
Cloud9,37wdkw,moderatorrater,2,Sun May 31 08:32:46 2015 UTC,"To be fair, his mechanical skill is already regarded as one of the best to come out of the western scene. This has been proven time and time again over his solo queue career. The only thing that's in question is how well he can  A) perform on LAN against professional teams  And  B) communicate and work with his team  Given that today, he faced the strongest NA mid laner in a very unfavorable matchup and managed to keep his cool is a very good sign. There were also some very synchronized fights and rotations made in their game against TSM that further proves his growth in these areas. If he continues to improve and as he does grow more comfortable, I have no doubt that Incarnati0n will be in contention for the best western midlaner by the end of the season."
Cloud9,37vgto,jloysnenph,3,Sat May 30 19:04:44 2015 UTC,"What up TSM! Good games to both teams, so glad we came out on top!"
Cloud9,37vgto,Razgrizacez,2,Sat May 30 20:12:39 2015 UTC,This game was SO DAMN CLOSE. But god damn i am so happy to see that Cloud 9 still has the teamfight and map synergy of the past.

Cloud9,37g85j,TheOnymous,1 point,Wed May 27 16:03:10 2015 UTC,"I first picked Febiven last split because he came from C9E (well, he came from H2k, but that roster is basically C9E), as well as Fnatic being my 2nd favorite team. That paid off very nicely."

Cloud9,36si23,VanHooliganX,1 point,Sat May 23 01:38:44 2015 UTC,"I'd love it too, but at the same time I look at Smite (my main game) and see that not only did C9 get a skin for winning the Smite World Championship (though not technically theirs because they became C9 after winning), but later on the developers released like 8 different team skins, first for the top 4 teams from the SWC and then just 4 for random teams. It really seems to reduce the value of the skin Cloud9 got (known then as CoG) and the skin TSM got the year before. Not only that, but TSM got a second skin for no good reason."

Cloud9,36sr17,gamestar_21,2,Thu May 21 20:41:33 2015 UTC,It's too bad he spent so much time helping Joe talk trash about League of Legends.
Cloud9,36sr17,TheTommyMann,1 point,Thu May 21 22:38:16 2015 UTC,"From what i saw, they were mostly ignoring league because joe hadn't heard about league and didn't really care. But it was fun to see joe's mind being blown by pretty much anything on twitch and to see that he was actually receptive to the idea of gaming as a career."
Cloud9,36p1dm,LtGaymer69,3,Thu May 21 00:12:13 2015 UTC,We won! btw how good was the team we were playing? I don't follow the scene too heavily
Cloud9,36p1dm,gamestar_21,3,Thu May 21 00:59:52 2015 UTC,"Keyd Stars are a really solid Brazilian team. They made it out of groups in the last major tournament, which was a huge surprise considering they were relatively unknown and expected to drop out early. Fallen, one of their members, was a legend back in the 1.6 days. They are one of the best teams in the ESEA Pro League atm. Overall huge win for us as we stay undefeated and gives us a good bit of security going into the rest of the season."
Cloud9,36p1dm,TheHardButton,5,Thu May 21 01:36:54 2015 UTC,"Sweet! I love when we beat teams that are good, and I noticed fallen was beasting that game. How's the new lineup looking? I know that some people here were saying that we were a bit inconsistent  in the last major lan we went to, have we figured out that problem yet?"
Cloud9,36p1dm,gamestar_21,2,Thu May 21 02:01:20 2015 UTC,"Our CT side looked a lot better. Looks like our comms were a lot better with some nice, crisp rotations. Freakazoid was playing a lot more mobile on CT side, which was good to see since that is his strength as opposed to just holding a site. Sean was fragging like a monster, which is unlike him but really nice to see especially against a solid team. Ska was missing a few shots he normally doesn't, but he did just switch mice so that may have had some effect. I definitely saw a noticeable improvement of our CT side, which was good to see. Our mid round decision making also looked a lot better.  It was only one map though, so I can't really say what our consistency is at this point. What I have seen so far looks really good though. Really excited to see what we can do at the next LAN."
Cloud9,36p1dm,TheHardButton,2,Thu May 21 02:37:24 2015 UTC,"Sounds like improvement to me. Also since you seem to know a bunch, do you know which maps this team is good on and was this one of them?"
Cloud9,36p1dm,gamestar_21,1 point,Thu May 21 03:09:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say our ""home"" map is Nuke, which sucks because it is no longer in the active rotation (no longer played in pro matches, basically). I'd say at this point our best map is Cache with Dust II coming in second. We don't seem to be all that good on Train at the moment. Hard to judge other maps due to small sample sizes with the current roster."
Cloud9,36p1dm,TheHardButton,2,Thu May 21 08:36:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for answering! Btw why was nuke taken out? Also I'm pretty sure I heard that the American teams aren't that good on cobble and train, how true is that?"
Cloud9,36p1dm,gamestar_21,1 point,Thu May 21 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"Happy to answer any questions to the best of my ability :)  Nuke was INCREDIBLY CT sides, to the point where it was a good half T side if you won 3 rounds. The structure of the map allowed for quick rotates from the CTs and easy angles to hold. Valve will be making changes to the map, so I am excited to see what they do with it.  I'd say NA teams aren't as good on those two maps because they just don't get played all that often, though that seems to be changing from what I have seen in both CEVO and ESEA-P. Cobble seems to be getting played a lot more, which is good to see. Train is the map that replaced Nuke in the rotation, so most teams are still a bit rusty on it."
Cloud9,36p1dm,TheHardButton,1 point,Thu May 21 18:03:25 2015 UTC,"3 rounds being good is insane, makes sense why it got taken out. And i guess we can hope that we can get better on train so we can go farther in majors and compete with the best."
Cloud9,36p1dm,gamestar_21,1 point,Thu May 21 18:18:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe 3 rounds being good was a bit of an overstatement, more like 3 rounds was considered normal for the map, which still reveals a huge flaw in the map design.  I think as this team plays more together, their map pool will grow. I could see Cache being their home map with an improved CT side. Same goes for Inferno. I could see us being good on Train but that will take some time."
Cloud9,36p1dm,TheHardButton,3,Thu May 21 20:24:29 2015 UTC,Solid win by us!
Cloud9,36psmx,Joebidensthirdnipple,2,Thu May 21 03:51:01 2015 UTC,I would love some weekly updates. I watched their first match in Pro league last week but it's hard to follow all C9 teams as they keep expanding.

Cloud9,36o4vs,jenadactyl,1 point,Wed May 20 20:56:38 2015 UTC,The only way I could see it being not too expensive is to buy it and ship it to someone in the US that you trust. Then have them ship to you as cheaply as possible.

TSM and C9 are my favorite CS:GO teams, but they're only second fiddle to their MOBA squads in terms of popularity.  Going over and watching a MOBA stream bores me to death though :/  At the end of the day though, I'm more of a fan of the players on the orgs than the orgs themselves."

Cloud9,36e5wg,droppinbabies,3,Mon May 18 18:22:39 2015 UTC,"I still follow competitive CoD quite closely, and it's been quite the opposite. Over the last two years, it's been growing quite a lot. It might be at a stalemate of growth, but it isn't dying. Me, and a couple others that I know at least, have stopped following it as closely since some don't enjoy Advanced Warfare, but it isn't dying at all."
Cloud9,36e5wg,droppinbabies,2,Mon May 18 18:27:52 2015 UTC,"Well that's good, I'll probably start watching it if c9 has a team. But yeah, advanced warfare turned me off of the game a bit. I hate the jumping stuff lol"
Cloud9,36e5wg,xgenoriginal,2,Mon May 18 18:32:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know what you mean. Kinda the reason I stopped playing CoD competitively and switched to League. The Exo's are more luck based and annoying rather than skill imo. So far, Black Ops 3 should help competitive grow once again."
Cloud9,36e5wg,Paytonzane,1 point,Mon May 18 18:42:56 2015 UTC,is it streamed on mlg mostly?
Cloud9,36e5wg,Paytonzane,1 point,Tue May 19 03:37:43 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Tourneys, League Matches, and 2K's / 5K's can only be streamed on MLG"
Cloud9,36e5wg,SeaSquirrel,0,Tue May 19 04:21:42 2015 UTC,"Is it still as bad as those videos that circulated around a few years ago, where it was nothing but teenagers screaming f-bombs and insults the entire match at each other and then even more so afterwards? Or have they finally learned to chill out about it all?"
Cloud9,36e5wg,MagicalQazq,1 point,Tue May 19 08:16:58 2015 UTC,"At the professional level it isn't like that at all anymore. MLG's put a stop to all that, at least on the pro level.  At open bracket events where its all AM's though, the same can't be said."
Cloud9,36e5wg,Bates220,0,Tue May 19 15:30:32 2015 UTC,"Okay, then this is good for the C9 organization! I'd love to follow a professional CoD team."
Cloud9,36e5wg,gamestar_21,1 point,Tue May 19 17:39:03 2015 UTC,that video was some amateur euro tournament that went viral.  I'm not going to pretend that competitve cod is as mature as golf but it's pretty average with esports.    /r/codcompetitive
Cloud9,36e5wg,MyNameIsHeretic,3,Wed May 20 06:11:10 2015 UTC,I think MLG's poor streaming platform ruined it's potential. But it's still a fairly supported scence.
Cloud9,36e5wg,MyNameIsHeretic,2,Mon May 18 18:28:00 2015 UTC,"The MLG thing did hurt it, which stopped a lot of big orgs joining (because of their Twitch sponsorships), but C9 doesn't have Twitch as a sponsor so they should be good to go."
Cloud9,36e5wg,MyNameIsHeretic,2,Mon May 18 18:41:02 2015 UTC,It will most likely grow larger because the scene will actually get developer support from Treyarch which is the studio that's making the next game.
Cloud9,36e5wg,Bates220,1 point,Mon May 18 20:49:11 2015 UTC,I think that a big reason why you haven't seen any comp cod stuff lately is that mlg made all of the cod pros stream on their site at mlg.tv and they pros are not allowed to stream on twitch.Also all cod events are streamed on mlg.tv
Cloud9,36e5wg,MyNameIsHeretic,2,Mon May 18 22:16:29 2015 UTC,"E6 is an interesting choice.  No reason they couldn't get a bigger team.  I know they had an impressive showing at the recent UMG, but who knows if that's replicable with essentially amateur players when they're are teams like Denial, propH, Elevate that they could easily afford."
Cloud9,36e5wg,LuckMaker,2,Mon May 18 21:15:50 2015 UTC,"C9 is an org known for being respectable, and most of the CoD pro's wouldn't fit that standard imo.  You can always tell someone to clean up their act for a reasonable amount of money, though."
Cloud9,36e5wg,LuckMaker,3,Mon May 18 21:23:33 2015 UTC,"The only players out of the 3 teams i just mentioned that may not seem respectable are Aches and TJ.  Classic, Temp, Aqua, Remy, Apathy, Kap, Clayster, Replays, Attach (Maybe him not so much), who stands out as that awful there?  Denial would be the ideal pickup for them IMO.  They can certainly afford it."
Cloud9,36e5wg,bigfootbro,1 point,Mon May 18 21:44:30 2015 UTC,"Attach isn't that bad.  Well what I mean is, C9 is known to be a respectable org with respectable players. And most of the community is know to not be respectable ina  sense that could hold up to C9 standards (still love em all though). Denial could also be a possible team to pick up, but I don't think their owner wants to sell that team, seeing as they just became world champions.  Also, Jack's known to pick up lesser known teams and make them known (look at the LoL roster for example)"
Cloud9,36dst1,LuckMaker,8,Mon May 18 16:21:31 2015 UTC,"There's a reason Incarnati0n has so much hype surrounding him. He was always a phenomenal technical player, despite the ban hiatus. When Riot started letting him play solo queue again, he duoed with Rekkles and hit the top of the Challenger ladder in a week. On top of that, he was the coach for SK last season, and they managed to get to worlds.  His attitude has definitely improved since his ban, and I'm sure part of that is due to the fact that he was 14 when he was first banned from competitive play and he's 18 now. Those 4 years make a lot of difference. He seems to get along really well with Sneaky and Meteos, who are the most polarizing personalities on the team. There will be some growing pains for sure, but he's focused, motivated, skilled, and has a great team and organization backing him now. Cloud9 is definitely looking at a top 3 finish this split."
Cloud9,36dst1,GSUmbreon,2,Mon May 18 18:32:22 2015 UTC,He's actually 20
Cloud9,36dst1,SmokingTheReefer,1 point,Tue May 19 00:33:57 2015 UTC,"Ah, ty. Still, 14 to 18 and 16 to 20 is still a big jump either way."
Cloud9,36dst1,GSUmbreon,8,Tue May 19 00:41:12 2015 UTC,I expect minimum 1 Penta/2 quadra's a game. Pretty fair IMO
Cloud9,36dst1,droppinbabies,6,Mon May 18 19:17:40 2015 UTC,"I haven't been watching his stream, but I've seen YouTube clips of him duoing with Sneaky, and he's an amazing mid laner. He's apparently getting along well with the team, and it's the team synergy that could bring Cloud 9 back to the top. Hai was a good shotcaller, but his plays began to worsen as time progressed. Incarnati0n is really talented, so I'm expecting for C9 to be back at the top for this split and many to come. Lemon and Sneaky, in my opinion, is the best bot lane in NA, and Balls and Meteos both are just great players themselves. I'm excited to see what happens to them this split, and how they face against other teams with this roster change."
Cloud9,36dst1,theggthdoctor,4,Mon May 18 16:47:09 2015 UTC,back to the top   i love how being #2 isnt top.

Cloud9,36dst1,supergamerz,1 point,Mon May 18 21:16:36 2015 UTC,"UM, Meteos is definite #1 jungler."
Cloud9,36dst1,Bloodtotem193,3,Thu May 21 23:15:37 2015 UTC,I hope for him to be good but I also understand it's his first competetive split and he needs time to adjust. I think it'll take a bit for him to preform on stage.
Cloud9,36dst1,MagicalQazq,3,Mon May 18 18:24:15 2015 UTC,I hope he will end up like bjergsen and take c9 back to the top. He is a talented player and i think in the best possible team to make him the best.
Cloud9,36dst1,MihoTheRipper,3,Mon May 18 18:25:49 2015 UTC,I don't have much for this first split. Him and the team need to adjust.
Cloud9,36dst1,my_elo_is_potato,2,Mon May 18 18:51:11 2015 UTC,"If it was CLG, i wouldn't expect much.  But you have to assume C9 knows what the fuck they're doing, they've proved it before.  Top 2 again is a must, 1st place being a realistic possibility.  He doesn't even have to shit on Bjerg, he just has to not get shit on. Getting rid of the Bjerg-hard carry win condition for TSM when we have arguable a stronger roster in 3/4 of the other roles would be huge."
Cloud9,36dst1,MyNameIsHeretic,1 point,Mon May 18 21:18:39 2015 UTC,I expect great mechanics early on and hopefully as the split progresses he will become a great professional league of legends player. This will be his first time playing professionally so I hope Meteos can help him settle in as quickly as possible.
Cloud9,36dst1,Bennyboozle,1 point,Mon May 18 21:25:14 2015 UTC,"Since we are talking about Incarnation on c9, you have to also look at who he is replacing with.  From the hype, it seems he is a technical upgrade.  But the new team, including him now, also need a short caller and someone with map awareness."
Cloud9,36dst1,gobio,1 point,Mon May 18 23:59:16 2015 UTC,"Mechanics alone don't win you games. We know that Incarnati0n is skilled enough to hold the #1 EU soloq spot and has the knowledge to be a coach as he has been for SK. We know that many top players have given incarnati0n props for his skill in lane and that he's bested some of the best (Froggen according to brokenshard).  All that said and done, we don't know how well that will translate into competitive. We don't know how good his competitive team fighting will be, and we don't know how his synergy with the rest of the team will be.  Don't set yourself up for disappointment and get TOO hyped. Remember when Santorin replaced Amazing? Dyrus said that Cloud 9 would dominate the spring season, and we all know how that went (2nd place still woo). Realistically you need to give them some time to gel. Remember, this is an astronomical change to the roster: A different team captain, shot caller, and mid laner."
Cloud9,36dst1,Rozez,1 point,Tue May 19 07:42:42 2015 UTC,I remember Dyrus saying Liquid would be #1 over C9
Cloud9,36dst1,XelaTuobdog,1 point,Thu May 21 19:14:47 2015 UTC,"I personally expect a stronger mid laner, but I also expect strategic part of the game to be weaker than last split so perhaps a team that will team fight better, be better at the laning phase but on the other hand had issue in terms of finishing the game or taking the right objectives at the right time."
Cloud9,36dst1,Komparativist,1 point,Wed May 20 16:38:33 2015 UTC,"I honestly expect C9 to look pretty sloppy at first. As the split progresses, they will slowly take shape and get 3rd or 2nd.   Mechanically I think Incarnati0n will be sound."
Cloud9,36dst1,Savoir_Faire,1 point,Wed May 20 23:05:30 2015 UTC,"I think it will all come down to how well the team has found new leadership. This will be the factor that determines if we rise or fall this season.  Everyone has praised Hai's shotcalling for a reason, but my question to that is how much of it was purely Hai, and how much was the team as a whole knowing what to do?  If i remember correctly, at Cloud9's highest point, the comms were pretty silent during one of the teamfights that was linked in one of the mic checks and it was them completely wrecking a team. I really wonder how much of the team's strategical mindset was the team, or Hai as the Leader"

Cloud9,36co6u,Thunderized,14,Mon May 18 09:21:39 2015 UTC,"My hope is for them to place top 3 this split, with that placement it will secure them for Worlds :D I dont want to put TOO much pressure on them just yet. But I do have faith and it won't waver. Switching players between splits is soooo risky, but it can work towards the end so we'll see.   I have been watching their streams too so I do see a lot of good! I'm definitely pumped for LCS next weekend :D"
Cloud9,36co6u,damonsloverr,6,Mon May 18 09:27:25 2015 UTC,He is the exact opposite of Hai. He just dumpsters people in lane and his mechanical godness helps in out in team fights to 2v1 but from what i've seen from his and sneaky's stream is that he is not very good at the objective game. He would always be asking sneaky how many Dragons the enemy had and other things like that. So i want to wait and see how Meteos does at shot calling before i can make any judgement about this team but i am really excited for this next split.
Cloud9,36co6u,GI_jim_bob,2,Mon May 18 19:21:45 2015 UTC,"Hai used to dumpster people in lane, including Bjergsen, before his injuries."
Cloud9,36co6u,miztah1999z,2,Tue May 19 04:21:04 2015 UTC,"well, kind of. Hai had a very aggressive style for his early lvls in lane. He would always go all in at lvl 2-3 forcing his lane opponent to to back to base far earlier then they where use to, which opened up Hai's ability to roam and start to snowball his other lanes.  Two things changed through the years tho, 1 people in the LCS got use to that play style and played around it better, making it less and less likely to work, and 2 the meta shifted towards hard caring mids and if Hai didn't getting a kill mid he could be set very far behind with his strats.   Hai was always a good player but his laneing was always his weakest aspect. But he was able to make up for it in other ways so his team didn't suffer, Roaming and buff control being the 2 biggies, But as the season went on Hai's lack of a good laneing phase has put him farther and farther behind going into the mid game hurting his team.  Now don't take this as me trashing on Hai, He is the reason i watched C9 i have watched him play all the way back when he was playing for No Fear and streaming from his dorm room from MSU but he had faults just like everyone else and because of those faults and his wrist problems it was time for him to move on and that kills me but it is whats best for the team.  Now lets just hope Incarnation is the extra kick the team needed to  be back on top of the LCS and winner of worlds :)"
Cloud9,36co6u,GI_jim_bob,1 point,Tue May 19 06:06:13 2015 UTC,"Last week Bjergsen said on stream that Hai was still the best laner in NA LCS, laning has never been his weak aspect"
Cloud9,36co6u,XelaTuobdog,1 point,Thu May 21 19:21:07 2015 UTC,"Well Bjergsen has had a lot more experience laning vs Hai then i have so i can't argue with him on that.  But after your comment i went back through last splits games and counted how many times Hai was winning lane (by being up in CS by the 10 min mark) and the data shows Hai in a negative manner :/.  Over the course of the 19 games he played in the Regular season (18 regular games and the Tie breaker with CLG) Hai was loosing in CS 10 of the 19 times so only a 47% of the time did he win lane.  So after that i was like maybe he didn't try as hard in the regular season he only played his best in the playoffs we all know that's when C9 shines. Well, Of he 9 games they played in the playoffs Hai Won 3 lost 5 and managed to Tie in one game. So that equals out to be about 33% of the time winning lane eeekk :?.  Then i was like fuck that, I'm going to go back last years worlds to prove this last split was a fluke.... Ya. Over the course of 11 games played at worlds Hai won his lane Twice...18% win rate.  Like i said Hai is and always will be my favorite player but over the last year or so Hai has been average to poor in the mid lane for C9 and worst vs better mid lanners. Combine his waning performance with his wrist problems switching out for incarnation was the best move. ;("
Cloud9,36co6u,GI_jim_bob,2,Thu May 21 22:16:02 2015 UTC,Let's be realistic: if they make it to the semi finals like last year I would already be really proud of them.    Edit: Or at least group stage with a good performance but just outplayed by a better team.

That said I am not foolish to think there is no drama, I think the c9 players just respect the org too much to let it get out. I think there were a few hints that Hai was unhappy with the roster move (the biggest being Xpecial's blog when Hai was in house, where he stops halfway through a sentence about Hai/c9 and says something like 'I can't really talk about it').

Cloud9,35x8qx,Darkoth225,7,Thu May 14 13:26:31 2015 UTC,He has been a man carrying the NA jungle since he put on the C9 jersey.
Cloud9,35x8qx,Bennyboozle,1 point,Thu May 14 16:33:28 2015 UTC,Step up? The only period of Meteos' career in which he wasn't definitely the best jungler in NA was Summer 2013. I think after that he is pretty much the undisputed champion.

Cloud9,35x8qx,Darkoth225,0,Fri May 15 02:10:24 2015 UTC,Pretty sure TiP Rush is gonna take that title soon when he starts having consistency
Cloud9,35x8qx,NordischKatze,3,Thu May 14 16:53:53 2015 UTC,Possibly. He has been super impressive. I think it relies one two things:   Him continuing to play aggressive junglers so well for as long as the tank meta continues. His team allowing him to actually play the junglers he is good at (no nunu ever again please).   Beyond that I could see it going either way. TIP were looking insanely strong before playoffs.
Cloud9,35x8qx,TheOnymous,2,Thu May 14 17:35:43 2015 UTC,"He won't, because all he can play is damage/carry junglers, and those won't be in the meta for long, because teams need tanky champions, unless you build warriors enchantment on everything. I don't see TiP being very successful this split, and I think XWX isn't as good as he was with LMQ, and Apollo isn't even top 5 in NA."
Cloud9,35x8qx,ObamaAteMyChicken,6,Thu May 14 18:43:27 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he would do well on C9... sometimes it's just the team that's holding a player back and I think that's been proven multiple times now with CLG honestly...
Cloud9,35x8qx,Komparativist,5,Thu May 14 11:05:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah this was hard to read. I mean I did see Link as a ""choker"" because I believe what I see. CLG didn't perform in their playoffs the past 3 splits. But then I wondered about his time with c9 at paris and he did really well! They beat some foreign teams so thats why I always wondered why he didn't perform on playoffs for clg. But seeing his POV on how horrible the team atmosphere still is...I dont blame him for leaving. I wouldn't want him to stay there. I feel bad for everyone bashing him, I always have, but even more so now.   I will always respect him and thank him for accepting c9's offer to step in when Hai couldn't. He did our fav team a huge favor when he didnt have to and I'm glad he has a good relationship with the C9 guys. I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors."
Cloud9,35x8qx,damonsloverr,4,Thu May 14 09:27:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly it basically confirmed what I was thinking about clg this entire time. IMO the only way to fix the problems clg have is to get a full b team, then when anyone is getting uppity or lowering morale just swap em out for their bench member whether they are doing good or bad. Seems like clg has some serious authority issues from management. Management needs to put its foot down and say no, you will not do this and remain part of clg. Once players start respecting the authority of the management then management will be able to start working on all the other problems the team has."
Cloud9,35x8qx,elyndar,2,Thu May 14 09:25:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I wasn't necessarily surprised by his part about Cloud9 but it was really crazy to hear just how different the environments were. To me it really reinforces one of the main reasons I am a Cloud9 fan. It isn't just about their play, but also about the team's attitude.  The part regarding coaching I found particularly interesting as well. It sounds like none of their coaches ever really had a chance of effecting positive change on the team. The team refuses to listen then blames the coach for not making them listen. Seems to be their core issue along with no generally getting along.  Maybe CLG should just pick up Keith."
Cloud9,35x8qx,TheOnymous,1 point,Thu May 14 16:45:15 2015 UTC,"Nothing in there was even a little bit of a surprise to me. I seem to be on the same page as Link. Doublelifts response was basically ""I'll listen when we find someone worth listening too"" - lol, guy still doesn't get it."
Cloud9,35x8qx,thezaitseb,1 point,Thu May 14 19:02:25 2015 UTC,He was in Cloud 9 for like a week or two and expects every single team to have our magic. The problem is he sees the Cloud 9 fantasy world and never got to see the members having and working out problems.   God what a whiny bitch! The one thing that tl;dr post insures is that he will never play League of Legends professionally again.
Cloud9,35wils,Shadystan,1 point,Thu May 14 02:29:29 2015 UTC,"For those of you unfamiliar with csgo and its competitive scene, it is very hard for me to describe just how skilled he is. The EU scene is miles ahead of the NA scene (where c9's csgo team is based), and in this clip they play against (at the time) two of the prestigious teams in csgo.   NiP- ninjas in pajamas, have probably the most successful legacy in CS history. They had one of the top 3 CS 1.6 teams and in CSGO they hold the record for the longest win streak (89-0 in maps played). The second team in this clip is LDLC (now team EnvyUs), the best french csgo team and probably 3rd in the world behind fnatic.   These clips are amazing to see because shroud completely man handled them here, his aim, precision, and gamesense are rarely seen in NA players.

I wouldn't be surprised to see him take over the shotcalling for a while, with Incarnati0n taking over it later (he has coaching experience and is very intelligent on the game as a whole, even helping other members of the team out on their builds in solo queue). Lemon will also step up for the time being.  Basically, I don't expect things to go perfectly smooth at the beginning. I expect Lemon and Meteos to take over at the beginning of the split (sharing the responsibilities). By take over I mean shotcalling and captainship. I, however, expect Incarnati0n to take over those responsibilities in the more long run.  Early in the split, things might be a tad rough. Later in the split, I expect verrrrry big things and am very excited to see how things play out. :)"
Cloud9,35sd0i,TheHelpWouldBeNice,7,Wed May 13 02:43:16 2015 UTC,"Lemon or Meteos, also Incarnati0n has a lot of game knowledge wouldn't be surprise if he ends up being the shotcaller."

The rest of C9 are already best in their roles in NA except support and maybe top ATM. They are going to fucking destroy everyone if incarnation is as good as we've heard

I don't have HIGH hopes but im excited to see how well he does, cuz he is bae :)  Let's all be there for each other c9 fans.

Do they focus on Mid to help Incarnation, or just let him roll face on his own and focus on other lanes."

He has since reformed, riot allowed him to make play/stream, and eventually he was unbanned from competitive play after an evaluation by riot. Prior to getting unbanned, he was apparently in talks with Jack (the early bird genius) and joined the team as you see it is now after hai's retirement.  This is a player whose skill was pretty well respected by top pros where both Diamond and Rekkles (and maybe Forgiven?) have spoken highly about him, and I've heard that he's bested many of the top EU mids in lane as well including Froggen.

Jack is a team manager and Owner. The brand is growing and he will now be grooming Hai to take over a bigger role in the org (Hai himself said he will need help learning what to do). I am sure he will always help out as much as he cans (booking travel, engaging fans at big events, supporting the team), but for the brand to continue to grow the support staff around the teams will need to grow as well."

Someone who really understands what's going on, but also may not be directly involved with any problems will have a much better chance at recognizing them and fixing them quickly.  Jack and Charlie may fit this roll a bit, but having someone constantly working with the team with authority (and having that sole job) is important. Jack has other things he has to focus on, since he manages all of C9's teams and the brand, and Charlie does a lot of analyst work."

I heard that they are bringing Rekkles back into the line-up and i dont know how well that will go over. I know that his best games were with FNC and with Yellowstar, but will he fit into the team well because he is a Doublelift style player who pulls a lot of resources from the team."
Cloud9,35g1dg,Bloodtotem193,2,Sun May 10 01:34:45 2015 UTC,"I feel like if there is one org that can make rekkles mesh into the team smoothly, it's fnatic. Their infrastructure is very good."
Cloud9,35g1dg,gamestar_21,2,Sun May 10 05:04:43 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about this. And a lot of people have theorized that the reason Rekkles worked so well with fnatic is because their solo laners (soaz and xpeke) go HAM and draw so much aggro during teamfights that Rekkles can do what he's good at: Staying at the edge of the teamfight and output damage. Elements was different, where everyone just played very far back.  If I look at the fnatic that we have now, it looks a lot like the playstyle the old fnatic had. Solo laners going crazy and drawing all the aggro. The major difference is the jungle, as RO is so much more aggressive than Cyanide. I am still not sure whether this is a good thing (another player that draws aggro) or a bad thing (another player who won't support rekkles, since Yellowstar usually plays engaging supports)."

Cloud9,35g1dg,guaranic,2,Sun May 10 04:48:09 2015 UTC,He was a utility carry for long time. That doesn't make him bad.

I'm also curious to see how much the team changes with the new mid laner. I just hope that he doesnt become a doublelift type carry where he pulls in too many resources from the rest of the team.
Cloud9,35ghrt,Bloodtotem193,2,Sun May 10 15:33:21 2015 UTC,"I am really looking forward to how Meteos will play this next split. Hai discussed in his retirement interview or maybe in the AMA that Meteos seemed to prioritize champs that early game gank pressure so that opponents couldn't pick the champ and use it to gank Hai (ex: Gragas).  As we know Meteos has always been better on team fight oriented champions and not so much on ganking. He plays a more control style game that will only really try to counter-ganks by taking something across the map or take dives that are nearly guaranteed, while farming heavily to be the stronger jungler when it comes to fights over objective. So early game champions that gank aren't really his style and I feel like that contributed some to Cloud9's struggles this past split.  The current meta is about snowballing top lane and team fighting - that's classic Cloud9!"

At least with C9 they gank balls to help him out if he is on a carry champ or is in need of help. TSM just leave Dyrus on a complete island then people expect him to do amazing."
Cloud9,35c44d,MrMonday11235,1 point,Sat May 9 04:51:53 2015 UTC,This really hits the nail on the head.  There is something fundamentally wrong with the way TSM uses their jungler and support to pressure lanes.    TSM needs to either have the jungler there to prevent the 3v1 dive or move the support and jungler to do something else away from Dyrus.  C9 doesn't have this problem because usually Meteos is so on point with map pressure.
Cloud9,35c44d,iNachozi,2,Sat May 9 05:00:41 2015 UTC,"""Relentlessly feed"" would imply that he does this on purpose. Santorin is never on the top side of the map for the 12 minutes of every game, so Dyrus never gets counterganks. Poor guy is left there by himself, and his options are risk his life for exp and farm or stay on fountain and cry tears, because Santorin doesn't even want to give up his jungle camps.   Moreover, the international teams see that Santorin is never there and specifically decided to exploit this by relentlessly diving Dyrus to throw him on tilt. The Fnatic game was a great example of this, with turret dives ending in red flashes for all involved after a dead Dyrus. Not something you'd normally do, but Santorin ain't there, so might as well take dat sweet, sweet free gold."
Cloud9,35c44d,gingerfr0,2,Sat May 9 09:04:59 2015 UTC,"I think part of it is also the lack of counterganks. If TSM lets Dyrus get 3-manned, there's not much he can do about it"

TSM has always depended on Dyrus to be at least ""ok"" in his lane phase with a couple of deaths as long as everyone else stepped it up. They never really needed Dyrus to be a carry, but that doesn't work internationally. That last game against  EDG was a slaughter. Look at how Clearlove would NOT leave Dyrus alone and that wasn't enough for Santorin to go and help his friend like...idk I would have been so tilted that game. I think its the team plan more than Dyrus. Dyrus does his job according to the plan. TSM needs to change their plan."

Cloud9,35c44d,VehementPhoenix,2,Fri May 8 22:09:45 2015 UTC,"TSM have a long track record of not competing well against Asian teams. Their style just seems very tailored to grinding inferior teams into the dirt. If a team has either better mechanics or strategy, TSM doesn't know how to cope with either."
Cloud9,35c44d,gingerfr0,2,Sat May 9 16:28:26 2015 UTC,They seem really really lost. They dont have ANY of the decisive early map moves or passable champ select they showed they had in the LCS. C9 is a worse team than TSM and I think they would have put up a better fight against FNC.
Cloud9,35c44d,-GregTheGreat-,1 point,Fri May 8 22:17:12 2015 UTC,Aren't we 2-2 vs FNC at the moment? I may be wrong... But I think C9 would have had a much better Pick Ban phase. That was embarrassing.
Cloud9,35c44d,Bloodtotem193,7,Fri May 8 22:51:25 2015 UTC,To be fair that was verses a completely different fnatic roster
Cloud9,35c44d,relaxitwonthurt,1 point,Sat May 9 01:10:18 2015 UTC,"depends, are we talking head to head wins from Bo3s or wins in games overall?  because if we are talking game wins then i believe it is 4-2 in favor of cloud 9. 1-2 worlds S3, 2-0 Battle of the Atlantic, 1-0 All-stars 2014."
Cloud9,35c44d,Bloodtotem193,3,Sat May 9 04:58:00 2015 UTC,"You forgot their match at IEM Katowice where Fnatic won 2-1. So they are 2-2, and 5-4 in terms of total games for C9. But like the other person said that was with a 80% different roster."
Cloud9,35c44d,gamestar_21,1 point,Sat May 9 11:35:34 2015 UTC,"yea, and after the series i just watched the new roster is looking stronger than ever."
Cloud9,35c44d,Bloodtotem193,2,Sun May 10 01:27:49 2015 UTC,"I feel almost happy that we didn't go to msi because tsm's getting ripped apart everywhere and i kinda feel bad. Dyrus needs to work on champion pool (weird to say, i know) and wave management. Well, at least we now see some weaknesses of tsm and hopefully cloud9 can capitalize on these in the next split."
Cloud9,35c44d,gamestar_21,2,Fri May 8 22:19:44 2015 UTC,"TSM doesnt do well unless they have a good grasp of a team and knows how to exploit weaknesses. thats the whole reason that they won this season.  They got to MSI, scrimmed Fnatic a little and the rest of the teams litterally just got there this week. So for the most part i believe they went into most of these games only getting information from VoDs, which isnt too helpful in game other than pick/bans"
Cloud9,35c44d,TheOnymous,1 point,Sat May 9 04:59:46 2015 UTC,"That would explain their weakness to cheese. I also think that teams finally figured out their weakness but different to teams in lcs,  they properly snowballed their lanes off of tsm's mistakes and that cost them the game in the end."
Cloud9,35c44d,TheOnymous,1 point,Sat May 9 05:57:56 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know what Dyrus could have done. The games against TSM all saw like 6 top lane bans and they specifically took away his Lulu, which has been his most impactful champion when he gets camped and put behind.  Usually the enemy team lose interest in camping Dyrus after killing him three times and pushing 1 or 2 turrets in his lane, but I think the weakness in TSM's jungle and duo were revealed against higher caliber laners who were able to really exploit the lead they can get off of camping Dyrus.  Santorin buys a ton of wards, drops them all around mid lane, and then sits on the duo lanes side of the map to countergank for WT/Lust and Bjerg. They aren't even giving Dyrus vision to see the ganks coming. Absolutely nothing. At this point I think he is just trying to play like flame. He's trading his life for as much farm as he can get and pushing as hard as he can to force the enemy into his lane while letting his bounty get reduced to the point where he isn't worth camping. Unfortunately if their duo is also losing this doesn't help anyone.  The fundamental problem is with TSM's strategy. This problem isn't new and it was really frustrating to me that Loco got coach of the split when there was no evidence that it was being addressed. Meanwhile other teams like Impulse and T8 made huge and obvious leaps in their strategy (except those god damn Nunu picks for Rush)."

Cloud9,35c44d,gingerfr0,6,Fri May 8 22:15:07 2015 UTC,"While i agree that Dyrus isnt the best top laner, he is still good. The real problem is that TSM doesnt care about him AT ALL, which is extremely sad.  I feel like if Dyrus was put on a team that would actually help him out he would show up a whole lot better than he does on TSM."
Cloud9,35c44d,WashedLaundry,1 point,Sat May 9 04:55:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, if Dyrus was getting solo-killed all tournament long - it would indicate there's a problem with him.

Cloud9,35aapw,gingerfr0,6,Fri May 8 18:46:18 2015 UTC,I don't think it was a coincidence that he was unbanned at the very end of a split. It makes sense for Riot to make him available during the time when teams are looking for new blood.

There are many reasons I love C9, but one of the primary ones has always been the way they carry themselves. They're humble, diligent, and seem to be an all-around classy bunch. They're just really easy people to like. Incarnati0n? A question mark.  Here's to hoping he's a cool dude."

Cloud9,35aapw,TheOnymous,3,Fri May 8 13:25:41 2015 UTC,It is actually official and Lewis reported this way back in April before C9 even admitted they were trying him out. I really don't understand where all this hate for RLewis comes from.  Really excited about next split.
Cloud9,35aapw,rrrogan,6,Fri May 8 14:16:00 2015 UTC,He is a polarizing figure and some people can't separate his opinion from his journalism. He's a good journalist and we need them in esports. He's just a dick sometimes.
Cloud9,35bsor,thezaitseb,5,Fri May 8 20:18:14 2015 UTC,"His time will come for sure. I don't think he was the right choice for this team at this time, but I have a lot of faith that he will be seen as the best NA midlaner at some point before all is said and done. He'll turn around the thought that NA will never have good mid-laners."

I have no doubts whatsoever that Yusui will eventually become a world class mid :) He performed ridiculously well in tryouts even while not being able to play the game as other players because he's in high school."

Cloud9,359cyd,miztah1999z,17,Fri May 8 04:54:53 2015 UTC,This is not the TSM that beat us in the finals. IDK where the real TSM is right now because not in Tallahassee.
Cloud9,359cyd,Bennyboozle,10,Fri May 8 06:00:26 2015 UTC,"Sneaky said on stream tonight that they were beating TSM before they left to Tally. Said it was the first time in awhile they were.  (He didn't say this, this is me) TSM really just knew how to exploit certain weaknesses over c9 and they used a lane swap in every game vs c9. They did standard lanes both times they lost today. Was really sad we didn't go for standard lanes once against them in the finals."
Cloud9,359cyd,thezaitseb,18,Fri May 8 06:35:15 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that C9 knows how to come back from deficits better than TSM. And seeing how junglers are so powerful this patch, Meteos could have carried some games. However it's hard to say these things with any amount of certainty. There are so many incredible mid laners at the tournament that I feel Hai might have been unable to compete."
Cloud9,359cyd,gingerfr0,6,Fri May 8 05:06:48 2015 UTC,Also I want to point out that TSM shines when they play multiple games against the same opponent.  Best of 1's really aren't their thing and never have been.
Cloud9,359cyd,Aushin,3,Fri May 8 15:42:04 2015 UTC,C9 is also well known for doing well in longer series. I feel like the whole 1 game format is dumb. I'd rather have multiple matches happening at once than results being decided in a single game.
Cloud9,359cyd,gingerfr0,8,Fri May 8 22:53:20 2015 UTC,"So things to keep in mind, when looking at these results (ignoring Beskitas, so I'll just talk about the two we care about).   TSM was RED side both times today, meaning they had to try and counter pick. Outsmarted themselves in Picks and Bans? I think this was the case. I think TSM went into the day thinking they could get Bjergsen onto Urgot if they let something else meta through. In the first game they banned out top lane, assuming this would mean Huni goes for Gnar (the only meta top laner left) to get an advantage over Dyrus. Against SKT they left open Hecarim (since Gnar wasn't appealing enough previously). Both times their opponent went for Urgot and played him bot lane, so they didn't get the pick they wanted. Also part of me thinks TSM had a counter ready for Urgot mid, but they didn't get to use it (maybe the card up their sleeve was some OP Urgot counter, then a stronger top lane champ). TSM was not ready to adapt to the win conditions of their team comp. Not really a red side problem, but more of a problem when you don't get the picks/bans you expect. So Fnatic didn't take Gnar and SKT didn't take Hecarim, so we picked them. Okay now what? Well both games had win conditions that required jungle attention top (Cassio can't get going and Hecarim needs to get going). They did not put jungle attention top in either game. What can we learn? Well it's hard to say. Cloud9 did exploit the camp Dyrus in their match in Week9 of LCS, they weren't really able to do this in the finals though. In fact, they left Dyrus alone later in the series and he made them pay for it. TSM must have adapted in scrims somehow that forced C9 to get away from this strat. It's always the case though that TSM is really bad at adapting to strategies they do not expect. This is why c9 was able to beat Bjergsen when he first came over, it was why UOL were able to beat them in IEM San Jose. Until TSM fixes these issues, C9 should continue to throw new things at them in matches (not scrims)."
Cloud9,359cyd,thezaitseb,0,Fri May 8 06:45:55 2015 UTC,"I think there are some real positives TSM can take away from this.     Bjergson appears to truely be in contention for best MID in the world.  Which is scary for other NA LCS teams in a carry mid meta. these poor performances were definitly on the coaches/ game plan preppers shoulders.  TSMs strategies were abyssmal and the fact they were unable to adapt strategies once it had been shown how horrible the strategies were , indicates poor coaching(which can be changed/adjusted relatively easily I imagine) Dyrus is not a carry top laner and doesnt have the best dueling lane mechanics..... but you dont need a carry top laner in this meta.  So as long as TSM actually plays around this(you know instead of putting him on a carry with NO escapes.. not even challenging smite;) put him on a top laner who has escapes and is support carry..... and then put your carry mid on a champ that can carry... or at least your adc/jungle on carries."
Cloud9,359cyd,biorhyming,7,Tue May 12 16:06:14 2015 UTC,"As a fan of both TSM and C9, this is about the same level we saw from C9 at IEM. Bo1s are a bitch."
Cloud9,359cyd,gahlo,5,Fri May 8 13:50:52 2015 UTC,"More a fan of TSM, you're half-delusional because IEM was a bad tournament format where not every team faced each other. TSM might have made it through just because the stronger teams fluked out in Bo1s. Remember TSM lost to YFW in first game of bo3, imagine if that were Bo1, C9 did too and C9 faced a well-prepared GE Tigers.  Let's put it this way, sure they might be equally bad, but TSM could've done much worse at IEM if the tournament format was fair."
Cloud9,359cyd,BurningApe,1 point,Sat May 9 12:57:35 2015 UTC,"I posted this before day two started, which comprised of losing to Fantic and getting stomped by SKT with a side of beating Wildcard. I think that matches up well with losing to Yoe, since coming into the tournaments most people weren't hyping up Fnatic or Yoe, and getting stomped by a Korean team while playing poorly and awkwardly."
Cloud9,359cyd,gahlo,2,Sat May 9 14:55:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's lan jitters that are affecting santorin/ tsm as a whole which is weird considering how well they did at iem katowice. They're just screwing the early game up so much that they can't come back from the deficit against teams that are good enough to not let them do that. I hope to see them doing better tomorrow because they played so badly today.  As a side note, have we found the chink in tsm's armor? Ban out Dyrus, force him onto something less than optimal and then camp him as usual? Or are we just seeing that lustboy and turtle are not able to make up for dyrus dying in the toplane with drag control and early pressure in these games?"
Cloud9,359cyd,gamestar_21,3,Fri May 8 05:25:42 2015 UTC,"The reason why it's working IMO is that Bjergsen is on the same level as the rest of the mids in this tourney, unlike in NA where he is clearly above everyone else. This means the teams don't have to worry as much about him snowballing out of control, so they can focus Dyrus more and still be fine. If Incarnation lives up to the hype this could be a viable strat for c9 as well."
Cloud9,359cyd,-GregTheGreat-,1 point,Fri May 8 15:01:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the mids can hold bjerg in check and dyrus doesn't play shyvana as far as we know, which means that teams can exploit dyrus and snowball from toplane. I hope incarnation can hold up to bjerg, if he does we have a real shot at taking back the throne from tsm."
Cloud9,359cyd,gamestar_21,2,Fri May 8 16:20:08 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say Santorin is outclassed. He's had a lot of great games. I'd honestly put him as the #2 jungler in NA behind Meteos.

Cloud9,359cyd,OmegaApple,2,Fri May 8 05:52:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't put Dominate behind Meteos, Rush I'll take at number 3, he really stepped up in the later half of the season. Dominate has a lot to work on. With Piglet showing up to play during the playoffs, Dominate is their weakest link atm in my opinion. I'd honestly put Santorin in front of Dominate because Santorin's had a hell of a lot more solid play this split than Dominate. Can't really comment on the bottom 3 as I don't know much about Porpoise and Azingy, but I will say Xmithie is, well.. bad for LCS standards. Ahead of Porpoise and Azingy though."
Cloud9,359cyd,Alcoholic_Satan,6,Fri May 8 06:37:31 2015 UTC,"It's easy for Santorin to look good when Bjergsen wins every lane. I don't think his play has been very impressive almost ever. He farms and does well in team fights, but his map pressure is awful.  Dominate, otoh, straight up carries games. Not always for sure, but he is actually an impact player, unlike Santorin."
Cloud9,359cyd,hardythedrummer,0,Fri May 8 16:08:30 2015 UTC,TSM is a one carry team. Bjergsen is their only carry while Lustboy does all the support for the team. Dyrus Santorin and Wildturtle are distractions/meatshields for Bjergsen. The only reason it works in NA is that Bjergsen is simply a cut above the rest of the mid laners. Frankly I'm surprised it has worked this long.
Cloud9,359cyd,elyndar,1 point,Sat May 9 03:44:38 2015 UTC,"He's good in certain team comps, but he's also got relatively strong lanes by NA LCS standards so it's a lot less pressure on him."
Cloud9,359cyd,thezaitseb,1 point,Fri May 8 06:33:18 2015 UTC,"Bjergsen can obviously hold his own against world class-mids, but he's not dumpstering people like he can in NA - and thus the rest of TSM is getting exploited."
Cloud9,359cyd,rukez,1 point,Fri May 8 18:40:49 2015 UTC,The only time TSM wins is when they clearly out class teams or when they know the team well enough to play their own game and take advantage of their weaknesses. In this case they don't know enough about these teams to do the latter and they don't outclass them

Cloud9,354a6u,VehementPhoenix,3,Thu May 7 02:00:35 2015 UTC,"Yusui is doing well overall lately but I don't know if he has the game knowledge/experience quite yet. Even in duo Sneaky asks Incarnation for advice on builds etc, it seems like he has a good amount of respect from the c9 players already on game knowledge, and I think that will be big (considering they will want him to replace Hai in some aspects on that)."
Cloud9,354a6u,thezaitseb,1 point,Thu May 7 01:52:44 2015 UTC,"Sneaky recently asked Incarnati0n when he was going to stream. He replied with: ""In a few weeks""   Seeing it was during Sneaky's stream (time zone etc) i am assuming he meant streaming for NA audience... so i think incarnati0n would stay in NA for quite some time?"
Cloud9,354a6u,2ylo,1 point,Thu May 7 04:25:37 2015 UTC,"maybe he means after Nic goes back to EU first and then comes back to NA, because a few weeks would be after LCS starts no? So maybe he wants to get settled in NA officially before streaming.  And at this point, I'm sorry, but Yusui isn't getting the spot. Incarnation already has a good relationship with at least sneaky, probably meteos, and maybe the other members. I don't think C9 wants a 17 year old kid in the house, it might mess with the dynamic of college aged kids hanging out"

Cloud9,350p5t,Pedarsen,1 point,Wed May 6 07:59:37 2015 UTC,"I actually became fan of C9 besides loving their game style, precisely because they never talked about themselves even though they were so successful. I never understood the appeal of TSM or CLG that are so all out, loud, almost obnoxious in how they work and in terms of how huge (and annoying) fanbases are. I'm actually worried about C9 now that main subreddit gets filled with Sneaky Meteos Incarnati0n videos, I don't like teams with ""personalities"", I'd rather have successful team that succeeds and doesn't make huge fuss about it."

Cloud9,34f9r5,XstarD,0,Thu Apr 30 18:56:24 2015 UTC,"yea.   One thing is for sure... He definitely wont be outclassing Bjergson.  Bjerg is potentially the best mid laner in the world who can throw down and get the best of faker... reliably.   XioWeiXiiou or however you pronounce his name, has shown he can consistently out farm the best mid laners in the world; and often can dominate team fights.  TLs mid has shown to be a very versatile and solid mid.  Gravitys mid has shown the same to a slightly lesser extent.    Incarnation is an untested rookie.  If he can at least hold his own(ie keep comparable farm, not be a liability in getting lane killed, and provide pressure in lanes) then he will be a huge success."

Yes he's the best mid laner in NA and maybe, maybe the best player but he's not the best mid in the world. Faker, Easyhoon, Pawn, U, We1less, Corn, Cool, Febiven(time to embrace the hate) are all better than him. Hopefully it's only a matter of time before Incarnati0n is as well. If he's better than Hai then he will be an improvement in my opinion and hopefully we get back to the top of NA and challenging the world soon with him."
