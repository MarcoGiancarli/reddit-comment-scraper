He's dedicated to what he does and although this dragged a bit and his hair is gay as shit I still enjoyed it. He's dope AF and I couldn't expect less from me m80. Hair is gayer than when I remembered him from tho. PRINCE EA out"

crappymusic,3dj5ey,aryafenrir,6,Thu Jul 16 21:37:43 2015 UTC,quality find. the part that makes videos like this so strange to me is the fact this clearly has a large-ish budget. This was a very calculated bid for fame that multiple people were involved in.
crappymusic,3dj5ey,SpanishMosque,3,Fri Jul 17 03:51:29 2015 UTC,I wondered that too. I did a little digging and it looks like shes from a Spanish speaking country and she is trying to break into the u.s. market. Except this did not translate very well at all. Im assuming most of the people involved in this also did not know English very well.

Me bitching - i write my shit on a five dollar acoustic my pops got me from a yard sale and a nylon string i got from a buddy for two cans of joose. I'm very envious of what this guy owns.  And, no homo, he's a good looking dude so when he started to play it took a while for my brain to catch up. He really is very bad. Like. /r/delusionalartists bad.  I kind of have sympathy for him, maybe he's never been told how bad he is...  Then again i've met people who really were that far up their own asses.   His ''hip live trailer'' video looks like it was filmed at an open mic - goddamn that's brutal. My ears and face would be red with cringe/embarrassment if i was there.   This person is a very unique character to say the least.   Who knows, maybe he'll get good someday - you have any idea how long he's been playing?   It took me five years before i was okay at covering songs and another two - three before i had a voice and my own sound.
