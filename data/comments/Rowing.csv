It's not that it doesn't elicit them, it's just that it is not the efficient way to elicit them. 30r20 is in this zone. 2 by 20@20 is in this zone. These are tiring workouts, but you can bet your shirt that they'll make you very fit. Many collegiate programs rely on UT1 for a considerable portion of their miles.    good place if you want to worm om both the aerobics and the back end of AT   I dunno what you mean. If you mean getting comfortable at that pace, sure. But past that, I think there's too much support for polarization (make your light really light, your hard really hard and short, and eliminate everything inbetween) for me to defend that particular zone as worthwhile.  But honestly, if I really wanted an answer, I'd go stir the pot in the rowingillustrated physiology forums. Those guys are great with the actual physiological mechanisms, and could probably answer your question in a far more elaborate way."

I changed my training alot this year, mainly making my longer rows easier but longer, going from 10-12/15k @2k+18-22 to usually 60-80 mins @2k+25ish.  So I swapped ut1 for ut2 work and didnt see quite the improvement I thought I would on race pace stuff. I did a lot more meters than past years, the intensity of my current coach's program is much much less intense than my previous coach's.  So I wonder if Thats something I should look into adding back in and maybe cutting out one erg."
Rowing,3e2fce,Eightplusandunder,3,Tue Jul 21 15:13:06 2015 UTC,"Has your volume increased to a big enough degree that you would benefit? The tradeoff with decreasing intensity is volume, and you might find that you can do more than you are doing.  Also, how much did you improve? It does taper off after a while.    thought i would on race pace stuff   Maybe you should do a couple weeks of harder stuff, little taper, then 1*2k@ballstowall and then see if you still didn't improve as much as you did. Polarized/Low intensity approach, in my opinion, is better, but you have to do a little more ""construction"" to get to a high intensity performance."

McChase has shared some great information, specifically, as well as bloomp (who posts here under a different name)."
Rowing,3e2fce,Tsav150,2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:47 2015 UTC,"I made this post partly because of some conflicting philosophies and data I saw on there. We mostly see scientific support for polarization as well as some anecdotal support for. That board is not heavily populated so varying opinions are few and far. Irl life though, I have friends who row at fairly successful programs and spoken to a few guys at GF schools who say they dont do that much easy work, workouts that are long miles are generally harder.  Personally I have been competitive with Mcchases boats. In high school I did almost no ut2 steady state outside of second rows in summer. So at the junior level to say that you have to miles of steady state I know is untrue."
Rowing,3e2fce,Tsav150,4,Tue Jul 21 15:26:16 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it comes down to your volume of training. I'm no expert, but take a look at someone like Conlin McCabe or even Henrik Rummel. They both make their 2k scores public so you can track their performance through the years at different levels of training.  McCabe pulled a 5:48 senior year at Crash B while at UW, he is now 10 seconds faster, which at those speeds is a ridiculous improvement. I'm sure the level of volume and the ""science"" behind the training program he now follows at the Canadian national team is more advanced that what he did at UW.  Same for Henrik Rummel. If I'm not mistaken from a post of his on here he said in college his PR was 6:00, his national team PR is 5:48. Again, a tremendous improvement. He has also shared the training the nat'l team follows - you can find it searching through his posts. Anyway - I'm sure he's also doing a significant amount more volume and follows a more structured training plan than he did in college.  So if you're doing lower volume you can do more hard workouts. The more volume you do, however, the more you need to do SS work otherwise your body simply will not recover and will not be able to handle the training load.  So I don't think training in the 2.0-4.0 mmol lactate zone is bad or that you can't gain improvements from training there. I just think it's hard to train in that zone extensively if you're doing a lot of volume because your body won't be able to handle the intensity workout after workout. Hence polarization - which almost every single national team program follows."

So at the junior level to say that you have to miles of steady state I know is untrue.    I think you want to be somewhat careful to keep fitness (erg score) and how fast you move on the water separate if you are interested in how to train for fitness. MChase did have a chart on rowingillustrated that showed that the kids he coached did not improve watts when they trained at too high of a lactate level over about 2 1/2 months. Last time I looked  the chart is was not there as some stuff was lost when they went to a different server.

I'm not discounting MChase's training methods at all, they obviously work.   If you are warning against assuming fitness/erg scores=speed then I agree. We get way too wrapped up in ergs around here and more   SS isnt always the answer to getting faster. More drills and being purposeful would help just as much around here.   Im not sure I follow your warning though.  How steady state and polarization vs training harder more frequently impacts race mindset, function under press, and technically proficiency at race pace though would be a nice discussion."
Rowing,3e19ed,Eightplusandunder,12,Tue Jul 21 04:33:48 2015 UTC,"Great post.  The only caveat I have is that it might be worth suggesting weekly volume.  The saying about elite athletes doing their easy workouts easier is (in my experience) true because they also do an enormous amount of volume; hence the intensity drops to compensate.  That bit is sort of left out of the quote.  The only reason I say this is because I have watched people do easy ss or ut2 workouts when they're only doing 2 erg sessions/week, in my opinion you might as well up the intensity if you're only doing such low volume.  Maybe I'm nitpicking; great post that collects quite a lot of good information in one place."
Rowing,3e19ed,nckthrn,5,Tue Jul 21 07:14:21 2015 UTC,"No this is a valid point. Truly, there are two training zones that make up ""steady state"" UT2 and UT1. UT2 needs to be minimum 40-60' minutes to be at all effective and really should be in the 60'-90' range. I approximate this intensity as 140bpm max heart rate. UT1 is slightly more intense, in the 155bpm max heart rate range and is more effective to train in 45'-60' workouts either as 5x12' with 1' off or 4x15' 1' off type workouts. UT1 is where most junior and college training programs do steady state (juniors because what 14 year old is going to stick around if he's doing 90' sessions, and college teams because the NCAA caps practice time at 20 hours per week), but more elite athletes do more UT2 work and up their total weekly volume significantly."

Rowing,3e19ed,sissif,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:11:43 2015 UTC,"I seem to remember that there was a recommendation along these lines in one of the Concept2 training plans.  There's a possibly useful concept from cycling power training, that I have used personally in rowing - Training Stress Score.  It is a way of calculating the tradeoff between intensity and volume; 100 TSS is defined as 60mins at threshold (~roughly 30R20 in my experience).  The actual equation is:   TSS = 100x(Duration in hours)x(intensity as a % of threshold)2   So more intensity or more duration = more TSS points, but intensity has more of an effect the higher you go.  The theory is that it is a way of comparing the training load, effect and recovery requirements of different workouts.  Anyway, bringing this back to the erg, and adding some numbers - say for a 250w threshold (or ~1:52 splits), a workout of 50 TSS would be:   60mins at ~70% or ~175w 45mins at ~80% or ~200w 30mins at 100% or 250w   These seem reasonable to me and hopefully illustrate the concept.  There are then a load of heuristics that have been developed around weekly and seasonal training loads in terms of TSS.  Awkwardly however, cycling references everything to threshold (40min-60min) power, whereas rowing usually uses 2k power if at all... it is all a little bit unwieldy."
Rowing,3e19ed,nckthrn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:55:54 2015 UTC,"TSS is a fascinating concept that I've read a fair bit about. However, this is some pretty deep shit. I know the Danish lightweight programs do something similar, but I'm not even going to attempt to replicate such a thing. While I understand the concept, I'm trying to apply recommendations of building volume in simple ways to people who need simple recommendations and guiding. IDK enough to try to build a system for integrating SS volume around it."
Rowing,3e19ed,sissif,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:27 2015 UTC,"I've never read about this, but as eightplusandunder says, the Danish have a similar way of comparing total stress between sessions of varying intensities, they use stroke rate, power per stroke, total time and physiological category to determine the load. Check out Rojabo for a rough idea of how they do it.  As for TSS, can you further explain how it is calculated? It looks like 'TSS = 100 multiplied by time in hours, multiplied by percentage of threshold power squared. Is that right? Does it then spit out a score from 1-100? Or perhaps higher?"
Rowing,3e19ed,rbkillea,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:40:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, sorry the formatting got slightly messed up.  That's exactly right - the key bit is that the intensity is squared, whereas duration is linear.  It doesn't have to be from 1-100, it can be higher - usually if the duration is significantly longer than an hour.  Hmmm actually, if you assume that threshold ~= 70% of 2k power, then relative to 2k power TSS becomes:     TSS = 200x(duration in hours)x(intensity as a % of 2k)2   That's a good point regarding the effect of stroke rate too though.  I've seen Rojabo but never actually used it myself."
Rowing,3e19ed,rbkillea,2,Wed Jul 22 05:38:02 2015 UTC,"Great post. Better articulated than anything I would've written.   Edit:  This is the picture I have of why SS is good.   Roughly, training that develops the aerobic system improves the density of mitochondria (power producers in the cells, from my poor biological knowledge), this allows the athlete to produce a greater amount of power aerobically, thus upping their total power output.   I think two terms used are peripheral and central adaptation. Generally peripheral adaptations are adaptations that occur in the muscles, while central adaptations occur in the heart and lungs. These central adaptations occur when athletes do high intensity work, which heavily taxes the heart and lungs, forcing them to deliver as much oxygen as they can to the working muscles. Since this system is relatively small, and unique, the adaptations can occur quickly but platau quickly as well. That's why HIIT is great for Joe Schmoe, because it works quickly and is effective when you're doing very low volume, but doesn't help that much for well trained individuals.   SS adaptations primarily occur in the muscles, and in rowing we use most of the major muscle groups, this means that endurance adaptions have lots of 'space' in which to develop, the benefit of this is that SS adaptations can continue to occur after months, years and decades of training. The downside is that these improvements take a long time to occur (6 weeks after starting SS, according to what's his name on rowingillustrated).   Think of SS as the means by which you build a big engine, but a big engine is only useful if you can deliver the fuel it needs to run at 100%, which is why intervals (15mins to 30 seconds) are important, they train the body to deliver oxygen, they develop a strong heart (both ventricles need to be strong, the sucking one and the pushing one, and they prepare the lungs for those huge breaths you need to take)."

Just something I've done in the past for my erg work for SS is blocking out the split on the ergo monitor. Sometimes the erg can do you in terms of your mental game, this just eliminates that and gives you a truer base of what you can do. Linked with heart rate work as well helps with gaining more meters per week."
Rowing,3e19ed,jawocha,0,Tue Jul 21 16:33:54 2015 UTC,I dont have a lot of time to read this over right now but off the top of my head -- what is it about 2:00 that just screams SS to some people? I would make a note in that last section that 2:00 is not a universal split & that people will be better off performing SS work in a range based off their 2k split as you briefly discuss above.
Rowing,3e19ed,acunc,2,Tue Jul 21 11:33:26 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but the sample volumes given are on the lower end for SS. Depending on your level of training/goals, you need to be closer to 15-20k per session."

There are many college club programs and many more HS programs and even more masters/non-affiliated rowers who don't have a dedicated strength coach/program. Of course, a D1 school would be welcome to read and implement this, but that's not my target audience as I assume they already know all this stuff."
Rowing,3dzcfe,exlaxbros,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:23:25 2015 UTC,"The only reason I ask is because at a couple D1 programs I'm familiar with, including ours, the coxswains don't really go to the lifts because they're not needed/wouldn't have anything to do anyways and the strength coaches don't want any extra people milling about in what tends to be an already tight space. For a club program though that doesn't have that I guess it makes more sense that they'd be there."
Rowing,3dzcfe,readyallrow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:44:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of it depends on the facility and schedule available. For me working with a club program, the team is on their own to group up and get the work done a lot of the time, so they form 4's basically (rowers...) and go that way."
Rowing,3dzcfe,exlaxbros,3,Mon Jul 20 21:49:45 2015 UTC,"I like this quote from the crossfitlondon.ca link: ""Strength increases do not occur with the high repetition, low resistance  training common in strength endurance programs. Strength endurance training without  adequate strength only means you are getting better at being weak."""
Rowing,3dzcfe,enohcs,3,Mon Jul 20 22:37:43 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah... that's Ed for you. When we do high-rep, low resistance work (or body weight work), we call it ""core"". Lots of burpees & split jumps & one leg squats on ""core"" days."
Rowing,3dzcfe,enohcs,2,Mon Jul 20 22:48:45 2015 UTC,"I wish someone would just publish ""do these lifts, follow this schedule, become big strong rower, the end."""
Rowing,3dzcfe,exlaxbros,3,Mon Jul 20 22:55:22 2015 UTC,":D Well that pretty much assumes that there is a schedule that fits all rowers. There isn't.   If you want to become a big, strong rower then you're going to need to do a lot more work than this reading entails.  That said... - squats - bench pull - deadlifts - lift 2-3 times a week - core 2-3 times a week - row or x-train 10-12 times a week"
Rowing,3dzcfe,enohcs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:00:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's not that hard to learn to program. There are basic exercises and accessory exercises that rowers should be doing (squats, modified deadlifts, injury prevention specific exercises), and basic ways to put them together (links above showing periodization schemes that provide sets/reps/intensities), then you just have to figure out how to make it work for your practice, training, and competition schedule. Not to continue to hammer my manual (preview linked above, should be out early next month), but that's really what I tried to do is put all that stuff in one place so you don't have to flip back and forth from 10 different tabs. I do provide exercises, and I do provide set/reps, so it should just walk you through how to individualize it to your schedule.  But, you could also hire someone to write an annual program for you, and then you would have ""do this, follow this, here ya go."" Just costs more $ than learning to do it yourself."

I do pullups, upright rows, and lat pulldowns at the boathouse. For the most part I try and lift 2 - 3 times per week, but I go with the mentality that any lifting is better than no lifting and end up doing the lifts I haven't done recently. Unfortunately, I am chronically stuck with a miserable squat. I've done 5x5, I've done the 20 rep max...I have yet to find the magic program."
Rowing,3dzcfe,Vespoli151,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:52:36 2015 UTC,"Well, there's your problem---the only magic program is consistency! There are good ways to train and not as good ways to train, but the biggest factor is what you put into it. Sounds corny, but it's true."

Rowing,3e1dek,ooccooco,6,Tue Jul 21 05:14:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think going to 6:30-6:35 is realistic. Also, why do you want to drop your 2k? You are talking about your bodyfat alot, so you might want to ss just to get your bf lower. I have no idea what you are capable of because I don't know you at all, but in general, 40 seconds in 6 months is impossible."
Rowing,3e1dek,GPier,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:47:55 2015 UTC,I'm looking to potentially join a team and I'd like to drop my body fat as (correct me if I'm wrong) I believe if I lose fat (while muscle is conserved) it would slightly help my split in the long run  Thank you for the honest response. I want to drop my 2k for college recruiting (colleges recruit in January/February right?)
Rowing,3e1dek,Rhinocalypse,2,Tue Jul 21 13:42:49 2015 UTC,"Losing fat just to lose fat is not going to help. The reason why most rowers are long and lean is because they put in hundreds of miles of SS a year. You will, most likely, lose some fat as you start putting in your hours of SS to get your aerobic ability to the necessary level.  You benefit on the erg, more than on the water, by being bigger if you can move the weight. A bigger person has more weight to leverage into the drive if they know how to apply the pressure (and if you have the stamina and power to do it for a 2k)."
Rowing,3e1dek,Mc1234ab,4,Tue Jul 21 14:57:04 2015 UTC,Is your thinking lower body fat leads to better splits? My concern is that you seem to be driven by body fat and splits are secondary. Talk with your coach about how you can best work on your goals.
Rowing,3e1dek,qwertymnvcxz,3,Tue Jul 21 09:31:52 2015 UTC,I think we have a lot in common here. I'm 6 ft 5 and 19 and started rowing about 8 months ago. I also came from a weight lifting background and pulled 7:14 after a few weeks of rowing. About two and a half months ago I pulled 6:33 and hoping to pull a sub 6:10 by the end of the summer. So yes it is definitely possible but they key in your long term plan should be a ton of UT2 ergs and see if you can get any technical help on the erg from someone experienced. I'm really no expert but this would be my advice. You're not gonna drop that many splits with just a weight program. Your ergs should come first and the weights used as a compliment.
Rowing,3e1dek,qwertymnvcxz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:22:40 2015 UTC,Okay thank you I hope I'm in the same position as you in half a year... What's the general consensus on the ideal spm during UT2?
Rowing,3e1dek,Patrikx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:35 2015 UTC,18-20 spm with a heart rate of 140-155 depending on your max heart rate. I'm gonna say at this stage of your preparation your going to want to be doing an hour or so of UT2 a day.
Rowing,3e1dek,Patrikx,2,Wed Jul 22 07:38:42 2015 UTC,"It's hard to tell without knowing what base you have. You could be naturally strong, hence the 500m split, but have no aerobic base meaning you'll quickly burn out on the longer 2k piece."
Rowing,3e1dek,AverageSculler,2,Tue Jul 21 12:33:51 2015 UTC,I believe this may be the case... Is steady state the best way to increase my aerobic base? And also would that increase my VO2 max?

Our stroke had a room for the third night but no one else did ... and so on for what would have come out to seven nights worth of rooms. It made absolutely no sense and of course, the hotel was completely booked. Luckily though they were able to call in a favor at the Independence Park Hotel near Independence Hall (legit amazing hotel, 10/10, would recommend if you're ever visiting Philly) and get us three rooms. All four guys ended up sharing one room, our coxswain and I shared another, and our other coach got his own room.

Rowing,3dy964,jawocha,2,Mon Jul 20 18:43:10 2015 UTC,If you have enough time between sessions you will be okay. Doing a sprint session everyday or even every other day while lifting and in summer may be very tough to recover from. Adding in an interval will help you tremendously in a few months though. So maybe once a week do a 2k pace workout and another day Ut1 type work and it should help. Adding Intensity AND volume at the same can be disasterous. Add one at a time then adjust.

Rowing,3dxshv,hullo-reddit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:41:55 2015 UTC,I would recommend just taking a caffeine pill or two before hand. I've been doing this for a while and really believe it works. Caffeine is one of the few ingredients in most pre workout drinks that is applicable for rowing type workouts/tests. Its been proven (if i recall correctly) to lower perceived exertion. Be careful with the dose though. too much and I've found that it can lead to a fly and die race or piece. I usually take 200mg pills. 1 or 2 of them is plenty.

Not to mention the army had to ban certain pre-workouts because they killed people. Not all pre-workouts are bad, but if your not used to them they can fuck up your 2k. Taking caffeine/pre-workouts can cause arrhythmia's and raise your heart rate. When your trying to setting into a rhythm, you don't want to feel like your heart is going to explode 2min in.  When I race I drink about 1-2 cups of coffee 2 hours before race time. Caffeine is going to make you go to the bathroom, so its better to give yourself more time to deal with that and re-hydrate."

Im saying don't use caffeine or pre-workouts if you've never used them before. People who are sensitive to it or have never done it before are more likley to see problems than most people.   OP is asking if its ok to take caffeine/pre-workouts before a 2k. My answer is yes, but you need to make sure your comfortable with it. I would avoid pre-workouts because they have other chemicals in them other than caffeine that can have undesirable effects, like killing you after you've been marching for only 10min.  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/business/a-soldiers-parents-take-aim-at-gnc-and-a-supplement-maker.html?_r=0"

Rowing,3dwiej,thatstubbornthing,2,Mon Jul 20 02:58:53 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as over-training, just under recovering. Once you start to stress the body more than it can recover from, you get injured. So you could either stress it less or recover better. Stressing it less involves, well, doing less work. Recovering better involves eating more, sleeping more, lowering stress in other parts of your life, ice baths, etc.  How to tell if you're not recovering enough? If you stop progressing for a period of time (everyone has a bad day, but you'll see a trend). If you are more fatigued all the time. You could also do things like test your vertical jump or grip strength.  As for your progrmaming, it doesn't sound like you have a coach. So get on a premade program. Concept2 has an interactive program that you should check out. Another good one is the Pete Plan for beginners.  5x5 is good for lifting.  Good luck! Feel free to ask any questions you may have."

I'd say a competitive time for a freshman racing in the 1F8 at ACRAs would be about 6:40 so shoot for that over the next couple of years. If you're not quite there by the time you get to college don't worry, you'll likely pick up a ton of speed from all the training that you'll do. Good luck!"
Rowing,3duep8,promitchuous,3,Sun Jul 19 16:54:58 2015 UTC,"This is pretty spot on. I'd say medal-level speed for the 1F is getting faster and faster and is probably closer to 6:30 or below now, but as pointed out above You can row at ACRA programs with pretty much any 2k erg. I wouldn't stress about your times, I'd just have fun with it and see where it takes you.

I'm sure even the good ACRA teams like Michigan and UVa would make sure you get a spot if you have some experience. My head coach is a former Michigan rower and said there 1F8 and 2F8 are usually filled with people who rowed in high school."
Rowing,3duep8,Reddit_WhoKnew,2,Sun Jul 19 18:55:32 2015 UTC,"I am not aware of many ACRA schools that have the ability to cut someone during tryouts. Most club teams outside of Michigan, UCSB, Purdue, and Virginia don't have 30 guys coming in every year and make cuts because they have too many bodies. So long as you show up, work hard, and aren't completely incompetent, almost all ACRA schools will keep you on.  Now, if you want to make the top boats and win races, that's a different story. As a freshman you need to be in the low 6:40s to compete. To win, 6:30s. By the time you're a senior, if you want to compete with Michigan, Virginia, and GVSU, you need to be in the low 6:20s or under."

You can have Olympic level skill but will never reach the top boat with a 7+ time.   That being said, you have a ton of time to train correctly and lower your split. A daily intense training program, with lifting, is the only way to improve.  I would suggest researching a few teams you're interested in, looking at results from any regatta you can find ACRA Champs. Orange Coast College won the MN8 Grand Final with a  6:00.7 just as an example. Granted everyone in that boat doesn't pull a 6 min 2k, but its damn close."

Once we start with that, we could continue to have discussion about other things we want, and as a community, decide what to put in there. We can't rely on the mods to do everything for us (They have already been helpful getting a basic guide to SS on the wiki already).

Rowing,3dv141,HotChestnutMan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:15:43 2015 UTC,He I don't know why someone down-voted this?  I used to row when in college (2-) a long time ago and recently bought a concept 2 row trainer to shape up and better my condition. Since I saw that you don't like questions about ergometers on /r/rowing I thought it was a good idea to start a specific subreddit for it. So what up? (Edit: grammar)
Rowing,3dv141,readyallrow,3,Sun Jul 19 20:04:19 2015 UTC,"It's not that people don't like questions about erging, it's just the consistent stream of the same ones over and over that gets old after awhile. It's a problem (hopefully) solved by having a better Wiki and getting people to actually go there, not fragmenting an already small sub by creating another sub that very few actual rowers will use. It'd be a good idea for the occasional /r/fitness person that wanders over here but it probably won't do much for the /r/rowing crowd."
Rowing,3dsqwt,bud_city,3,Sun Jul 19 02:31:07 2015 UTC,"I think a medium grip gives you more leverage through your inside arm, but allows you to still lean towards your side. It really is personal preference though. Jut try both and find what YOU like more."
Rowing,3dsqwt,captiancurtains,2,Sun Jul 19 04:19:50 2015 UTC,"physics. The shorter your grip, the more leverage you have I think, and it makes sense. Guys that pull a lot with their inside arm usually have a wider grip, but that's bad practice around here, and we prefer not to do that... so -> short grip or medium grip. A wider grip may solve some technique issues in some cases"
Rowing,3dsqwt,JoaoCGA,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:58:42 2015 UTC,"You most likely want to go with a shoulder width grip as the starting point, and adjust form there. Short grip allows you to get more reach over the hull and therefore more leverage."
Rowing,3ds8it,pretzelgel,5,Sat Jul 18 23:26:11 2015 UTC,Your best bet is to reach out to the coaches at the school and let them know you're interested in walking on/trying out and what they recommend doing to be ready
Rowing,3ds8it,ltwtsculler91,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:32:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, will do!"
Rowing,3ds8it,fecklessreckless,2,Sun Jul 19 22:52:23 2015 UTC,"I walked onto my collegiate rowing team, and it was a great decision. Most collegiate teams have a novice program and then you might get moved up to varsity if you work hard enough - I'd just contact the coach and express your interest. I just emailed the novice coach at my old university, and she sent me all the details I needed about tryouts etc.   I know nothing too specific about the competition level at that particular school, unfortunately. As for how to prepare, I'd say just stay fit, and if you can do a bit of erging on the side, do it! Rowing on the water, I'd say do it if you can, but they might change your technique a lot novice year, so I'd almost think focus more on fitness at this stage. Try not to build bad habits, ya know?    As for if collegiate rowing is worth it, I definitely think so. It allowed me to structure my classes and homework and social time around something concrete, and while it was definitely a lot of work, I think I got more out of college because of it."
Rowing,3ds8it,fecklessreckless,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:02:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply! I definitely agree that rowing too much could form bad habits, but erging is a great idea. I love the idea of being part of a serious sports team in college, athletics have always been a major part of my life and I've been really disappointed at the thought that they might be gone soon.  In your experience, how many novices are moved up to varsity after freshman year? What happens to those who don't make it, are they cut?"
Rowing,3dqnp3,hennnnndo,10,Sat Jul 18 14:51:38 2015 UTC,"On the women's side they are improving year to year fairly consistently. Colin Truex is going into his fourth year as their head coach and they've been focusing more on recruiting which seems to be helping them.  On the men's side, they are not particularly fast to be honest. As has already been said they're not the best bet for consistent IRA performances. That being said, the team is very tight knit and there is always room for guys to have an impact from their first day on the water to their last, which is something worth thinking about. Personally I've really enjoyed my time there, and I chose it over some other schools that are a lot better as far as results go, and I never have regretted my decision. Hope this helps!"
Rowing,3dqnp3,Scott_Kennedy,3,Sat Jul 18 18:20:39 2015 UTC,That kinda depends on what you're looking for in a team. If you want to go to IRA's every year they're not your best bet.
Rowing,3dqnp3,KaiserReisser,2,Sat Jul 18 15:01:51 2015 UTC,I went on an official there and really liked the team atmosphere and thought their location in mission bay would have been an incredible place to row.

Rowing,3dm6oc,czechm8e,2,Fri Jul 17 14:10:32 2015 UTC,"The cameras on higher end drones are typically mounted on brushless gimbles, that automatically compensate for the pitch and roll motion of the drone. A second camera feed(or sometimes a downsampled version of the main camera feed) is transmitted back to the operator real time and used to fly and orient the drone/camera. Easily a one person job. The actual difficulty of flying depends on the drone, but frankly having onboard processing is so cheap (financially, mass etc) that many drones can effectively fly themselves."
Rowing,3dm6oc,Frackadack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:15:04 2015 UTC,"The phantom is an incredibly stable platform and the conditions look so calm that there shouldn't be too much shaking.  They might have also gone with a higher end camera than a go pro, maybe a black magic or something."
Rowing,3dm6oc,campizza,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:35:55 2015 UTC,The camera is mounted on a gimbal which moves the camera independent of the drone. This translates to the ability to have very smooth video with it pointing towards the target not towards wherever the drone is pointing.

Everyone on the team is experienced enough that that's really all we need to do but I know some places are a little more in-depth about it (i.e. they'll make you wait until conditions are windy/choppy (nothing ridiculous, just not flat water) and making you do it then to prove you can handle the elements should they come up on you suddenly). I don't know anywhere that DOESN'T have a policy like this in place though so it's surprising you're getting resistance for it. I think returning their money until they complete a flip test is a smart idea, at the very least for liability's sake."
Rowing,3dofl6,readyallrow,2,Fri Jul 17 23:06:32 2015 UTC,"I think the key phrase here is ""for liability sake."" Tell them if they don't want to do the flip test, they're welcome to buy their own boat."

No flip test though."
Rowing,3dofl6,flyingmountain,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:01:30 2015 UTC,"Most clubs in the UK should follow the British Rowing guidelines which are probably somewhere in RowSafe, although I can't find a link on my phone. Typically involves being made to capsize and shown how to get back in the boat as well as some information on the dangers of cold water and capsizing etc   Oxford has a quite specific capsize drill. It's a (not so) brief talk about the dangers of capsizing (hypothermia, concussion etc) and the dangers on our own stretch of river. Then you have to demonstrate your comfortable capsizing a boat. We don't teach people to get back in because our stretch is so short and so heavily populated with boats it's easier and safer to just swim to the side and get back in there. The main thing is that the person running the drill must have an appropriate qualification (level 2 I think) to be allowed to run it, also we do the drill in the swimming pool with a life guard there.   I would continue this by saying that I don't think such a drill is sufficient to know someone is safe to go out on their own. It's a basic requirement but not the only thing. Being safe in a single is not just about knowing how to get in but also knowing how to avoid circumstance that might result in your going in in the first place."

Very hard to enact change on that muscle with just stretching.

Staying on it now and doing stretches, exercises, and manual therapy will greatly speed up your recovery, though it's impossible to give you an exact timeline."

Having been grown in an indoor environment most never even see water until after purchasing them these days, we're long past the days of free range oars it's just not economical anymore. So biting the oar is teaching it that the rower is in charge and that it needs to square properly when the rowers signal.

Rowing,3di5p3,coanbread751,6,Thu Jul 16 13:45:46 2015 UTC,"Distance rowing - what we here usually refer to as ""steady state"" - is the building block of fitness and rowing success. Doing the distance days will help make you better at the interval days. I won't go into too much detail, but unless you're planning on rowing competitively, they're not a huge necessity. However, cardio is always good for your overall health.  The biggest thing is making sure you eat enough! Rowing burns a lot of calories (upwards of 1000/hour) and if your goal is to put on muscle (""tone"") you'll need to eat your daily amount (~2000) plus the amount you burn rowing plus whatever kind of surplus you want. 500 extra calories per day equals a pound of weight loss per week.  But overall I'd recommend doing both weight training and rowing. Just doing one or the other won't completely satisfy both goals of getting muscle and getting healthy cardio."
Rowing,3di5p3,el_vetica,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:55:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I used to run cross country in high school, so I understand your point about the importance of steady state rowing. But, I don't plan on rowing competitively and instead I chose the ergometer because I hate running and feel like I am getting a much better all around workout on the erg.   I see what you are saying about weight training as well. Although just a month of rowing has already started to tone my arms, I suppose that you can only do so much without adding in the weight training."
Rowing,3di5p3,Scott_Kennedy,3,Thu Jul 16 14:58:37 2015 UTC,"I would say that a solid option for muscle toning oriented training is to find a combination workout that works well for you. Do your distance erging more often, I know that sucks and you are saying that its starting to get boring, but trust me, at a certain point it actually begins to get easier. I would also say since you're not planning on competing I would top out the distance training around 10k.  So that's the distance part. Then pretty quickly afterwards, (don't let your HR dip below around 60% of max to stay in a cardiovascularly active zone). Get some interval stuff, 250's high drag or 500 at a typical drag are good (That being said I don't recommend high drag training unless you've had specific erg techinical coaching in the past). So after the distance erging, getting in another 1K-2k meters at high intensity will really tear up the muscles because your body has run through its initial supply of Glycogen will have been used on the steady state. Once you're done there, you've now spent around an hour in a cardiovascularly active zone, and during the time you've torn up your muscles in a high rep/low weight style.   If doing that much erging isn't your cup of tea, replace the first erg with some other cardio (running, biking, honestly anything in the proper HR zone), and if you'd rather just do the first erg, switch the intervals for some light weight quick rep style weight lifting.  I train lightweights a lot of the time, so obviously this is the type of workouts you need to have them run because they need to be as light but as muscular as possible. That indirectly leads to them being extremely toned atheletes.  TL;DR Combine the two into one workout, or at least get the ideas of both workouts into every workout.  feel free to message me with other questions."

Rowing,3dgzgn,triggahtrey,10,Thu Jul 16 04:56:59 2015 UTC,"SS == UT2 training, which equates to around 55% of max heart rate. If you don't have a heart rate monitor, you can get a reasonable approximation in 2 ways:   by going at 55% of your max 2K watts. Take your most recent 2K erg test split if you have one (or ""acquire"" one if you don't), plug it in here to get the equivalent watts, then do your steady state at 55% of the result. In the absence of any kind of measuring device, go at a pace where you can just about hold a conversation.   SS should never be to the point of exhaustion. It is a bit more than a recovery piece, but not much. You should feel fatigued, but still reasonably fresh afterwards.  Also, it helps to do it in batches of 10 - 15 mins. Between each, take 1 - 2 minutes to stand up, stretch the back and legs, and take on some fluid."
Rowing,3dgzgn,kitd,4,Thu Jul 16 09:36:28 2015 UTC,"55% of max heart rate? That doesn't sound right. Isn't it more like 65%-75% of max heart rate, and roughly 52-55% 2k watts? Or 1.5-1.8mmol lactate?   Many rowers have max heart rates of roughly 190, making SS for them roughly 105. Doesn't that seem very very low?"
Rowing,3dgzgn,sissif,2,Thu Jul 16 19:57:04 2015 UTC,"The HR band normally claimed for UT2 is 55 - 70%. I always quote the bottom end though because IME no-one (even myself) can resist pushing just a bit too hard. Aim for 55. Chances are you'll spend most of the time at 60-65, which is fine too.  But you're right that the true definition of UT2 is based on lactate, with 1.8-2.0 being the range I have seen stated most often. Since most people don't have lactate testers, HR is used as an approximation, but it can be a poor one, especially in the conditions /u/Bermuda_rower was quoting."
Rowing,3dgzgn,kitd,2,Fri Jul 17 09:11:59 2015 UTC,We erg in 90%+ humidity and 28 degrees - would your advice be the same?  I guess the HR% would still work and take account of local conditions.
Rowing,3dgzgn,Bermuda_rower,5,Thu Jul 16 12:25:23 2015 UTC,"I was going to sympathise but then I saw your username!  Obviously heart rate will be adversely affected in those sorts of conditions and you can't use it as a reliable guide. The true measure (in fact the definition) of UT2 uses lactate levels but I'm assuming you don't have access to lactate testers.  In which case, in those sorts of conditions I think your breathing intensity is actual the best gauge of how hard you need to work, which makes sense because it is the oxygen-based systems that you are training and AIUI, breathing patterns are less affected by environmental factors. Breathing should be deep, but not panting such that you can't speak properly. If you are training in a group, you should be able to chat with the person next to you, while still rowing a proper length stroke. Your watts on screen may be down a bit but don't worry about numbers. The purpose is to work slow and steady for a sustained period of time, rather than aim for a particular watts target number."

Rowing,3dgzgn,Bermuda_rower,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:19:53 2015 UTC,I did have a heartrate monitor and it would always worry me because I would hit anaerobic mode with about 4 mins left and broke 200 bpm a few times. My coach was a little crazy and so I assumed he would never want us in the 55 percent range so I guess my whole team was doing it wrong. Are their still as much gains when doing the 55 percent steady state.
Rowing,3dgzgn,RandomSculler,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:54:53 2015 UTC,"Do any kind of training and you will make gains (as long as you dont end up overtraining!), however its whether you could be making more gains by training in a different way is probably the better question. From your description about how you are hitting high HR's it sounds like you are/were following a Threshold training programme, in that you spend a long time at or around the 4mmol blood lactate level to try and make improvements, what your friend is describing, with much lighter long sessions, sound like a Polarised (POL) training whereby he was doing workouts closer to 2mmol most of the time, but probably some high intensity intervals as well from time to time.  The link below discusses a study where several training programmes (including Threshold and Polarised) were compared in a group of cyclists:  http://www.joefrielsblog.com/2014/10/polarized-training-update.html  The results showed that all made improvements, but that on average the Polarised group made more improvements in the time frame than the Threshold, so on average it suggests that the most gains can be made following a proper Polarised Plan   NOTE: Just to note however, we are all different so in no way am I suggesting that switching to a Polarised plan will instantly make you drop 30 seconds from a 2k, we are all restricted by our genetics! However this (and other studies) does suggest that training with a Polarised training plan gets the best bang for your buck.

Rowing,3dgzgn,fecklessreckless,7,Thu Jul 16 15:20:51 2015 UTC,"I went through a training spell where we did MEGA steady state. One of our coaches made it to London, and swore up and down that it was steady state that got her there. We all did it based on heart rate, and I'd definitely classify it on the relaxed-endurance side rather than kill-yourself pieces. Under my definition of steady state, if I'm collapsing after 60' at ss, I'm going WAY too hard. Mine heart rate range for ss was 155-160 but not sure if that's useful at all. Max HR 191 if that helps? It was fairly peaceful, but still sweaty.  As for workouts, mostly we just did a 60 min, 20k, or sometimes we did 2x65' with some rest, I can't recall exactly how much. I never got off feeling like I couldn't pull another stroke, but I definitely was always ready to get off the erg."
Rowing,3dgzgn,enohcs,2,Thu Jul 16 05:37:23 2015 UTC,I love this training calculator. It programs a lot of SS work and provides splits and HR based on your current 2K time: http://indoorsportservices.co.uk/training/interactive
Rowing,3dgzgn,acunc,4,Thu Jul 16 14:10:49 2015 UTC,"The majority of less experienced rowers do not do SS properly. The gains of steady state are a function of duration more so than they are a function of intensity. There is no need to go 'hard' on SS - it's meant to be easy. You should never 'collapse' after a session of SS.   And yes, tons of SS will drop your 2k significantly, especially if you've never followed good SS guidelines before."
Rowing,3dgzgn,McRoosta,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:26:22 2015 UTC,"I'll jump in on this thread and ask for some advice.  5'6"", 63 kg, male, still quite beginnerish and hence not particularly fit.  Last (and first) 2k I did was 8:07.5/2:01.8 3 months ago or so, so based on this split calculator, I've been aiming for a 2:30 split at r18 over long periods.  However, my HR seems higher than it should be, see this graph from two days ago.  (A zoomed-out version is here in case the changes in HR seem too drastic in the first.)  The UT2 range (grey box) is based on these calculations.  I'm not exhausted after these sessions, so it doesn't feel like I'm obviously putting too much effort in.  The two options currently on my mind are:   Continue doing long pieces at a 2:30 split, and keep tracking HR.  In theory (I would hope), there will be a downward trend in HR as I get fitter to a more reasonable-looking range, or Just do a higher split until my HR is in the right range.   Which one of these (or some other unconsidered) options sounds best?  Also, secondarily, is the kind of graph shown above still beneficial, or is most of it ""wasted"" in some sense?"
Rowing,3dgzgn,Eightplusandunder,2,Thu Jul 16 14:29:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I like using HR, which doesn't seem to be the cool kids thing on this board. However, there are rare exceptions to HR being applicable for the whole ""HR155 all day"" thing. 2k+28 at an 18 (also less than 55% of your 2k watts) is fairly light steady state. If I were you, I would stick with your plan for a month or two and see if your HR drops. If it drops, you can sustain the volume you want, and you don't have crazy wacko technique to pull 2:30 right now, I would stick with it."
Rowing,3dgzgn,bud_city,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:13:51 2015 UTC,You should be able to talk after a SS piece without collapsing to the ground. You will sweat but it shouldnt be to the point where youre collapsing at the end

Steady state is very relaxed. I always use my heart rate (75-80% of max) to determine my split. I haven't tested my 5k or 2k recently enough to give you exact answer of what splits to hit, but if you just set your erg for ah hour plus every day, put your screen down, and go to HR155, then you'll end up in a good place"

I also hit all my PRs those years by significant margins and lost a lot of weight in the process. I can't say its exclusively because I stopped eating meat, but more so because I paid significantly more attention to what I was eating and when I was eating it. I also felt like I had a lot more energy when I wasn't eating a ton of meat products and focusing more on eating a diverse range of vegetables and legumes. I wasn't winning IRAs or anything, but I managed to go sub 6:10 on my 2K and medal (and win) at several races in the process.

Rowing,3dfto0,TitanUp9370,2,Thu Jul 16 00:59:54 2015 UTC,"Rowers are primarily fueled by carbohydrates. Obviously we have protein needs but these can be met with vegetarian sources.

Rowing,3dfto0,OARneryRower,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:39:11 2015 UTC,"Actually, once properly trained up, won't a rower use fat as fuel for the most part? The only exception would be when doing high intensity work that taps into the glycogen reserves (supplied by carbs) which tend to be depleted quite rapidly... Don't quote this as fact though...this is simply what I recall learning way back when."
Rowing,3dfto0,enohcs,3,Thu Jul 16 14:05:37 2015 UTC,"Your thoughts have been proven by the research done by Phinney and Volek. At first fat adaption was thought to be a last resort for couch potatoes to fight Diabetes. Then ultra distance runners started to reveal that they had been using high fat diets to fuel several impressive wins. Low carb high fat is now a widely accepted diet for endurance athletes.   Recent research is revealing that spending more time in a fat adapted state allows the athlete to do increasingly intense exercise while still using fat as the primary fuel source. This means that a rower will preserve more and more muscle glycogen when racing and training in a fat adapted state. They will require less refueling and will recover more quickly between sessions.   Anyway, you have 2,000 calories of glycogen stored in your body and it will take a lot of races before you bonk. Even if Phinney ands Volek are 100% wrong, your only risk is that you don't refill your glycogen stores between workouts and bonk more quickly. Even this is a small risk as you can restore glycogen levels while in nutritional ketosis - the most extreme and restrictive form of LCHF.   Tldr; research is showing that even an intense sport like rowing could very likely be done at a high level while dietary carbohydrates are restricted."
Rowing,3dfto0,Quatroux,0,Thu Jul 16 22:10:14 2015 UTC,We train as endurance athletes and carbohydrates are definitely our primary fuel.
Rowing,3dfto0,OARneryRower,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:45:18 2015 UTC,The primary fuel source at 60-75% max HR (steady state) is fat. You can't sustain an hour+ of work on glycogen alone. You don't really start depleting your glycogen stores until you get into the higher heart rates.

Rowing,3df5fl,burnshimself,19,Thu Jul 16 00:29:06 2015 UTC,"I have to tell you having rowed at a EARC school in college that you have absolutely no idea the hell that rowing is if you haven't done it intensely yet. I was a walk-on but was in the first boat and it is a slug. 20-30hrs/week dedicated to the sport per week just in erging/training/lifting and transit to/from boathouse. And to be competitive you have to be on the higher end of that scale. More importantly, you will wake up early every day and go to bed early every night except Saturdays, meaning you will be on a completely irregular sleep schedule compared to your non-athlete peers and be incapable of participating in normal parts of undergraduate life. Practices are usually around ~7AM or worse, meaning you have to be up and moving by 6AM, so to get 8hrs of sleep (if you row you will LOVE your sleep so this is a must), you have to be in bed by 10PM. The sport basically comes with the commitment level of a full-time job at the highest level (which is the only level that would really off scholarship money). So just thinking about it from a commitment perspective, are you content with giving up the features of a traditional college experience in exchange for super early mornings and few late nights out, with taking on essentially a full-time job which you must balance with your classwork, and being completely barred from participating in almost any other activities or campus life on account of your rowing commitments? I feel as though you are treating these demands very flippantly and suggesting that rowing a mediocre 500m piece and going to a camp once is enough rowing experience for you to make a four year commitment to a notoriously grueling sport. More importantly, it is a little insulting that you believe you could get scholarship money for the sport after competing in it for under 6 months.  The naval academy is interested in coaxing your interest for a few reasons. First of all, no school is going to spurn a prospective walk-on. The sport is built on them at the collegiate level due to rowing's high cost and low exposure to high school athletes. If you get into a school on your own, the coach would almost certainly like to have you at least try out and it can't hurt to build good relationship capital from the coach's perspective. But they wouldn't dream of giving an athlete with no actual rowing experience a scholarship unless you were pulling freakishly fast times on the erg. The navy coach doesn't need to think about 'scholarships' because all of his athletes are paid for by the federal government, but he's not going to give a non-rower with little experience a recruiting slot. And the same goes for any other school, they're not going to give you a recruiting slot or scholarship money (if they have it, which for most schools is not the case). It is basically up to you to get in on your own and secure financial aid off your academic merits or need basis.  If you want to walk on to a rowing team any team would be happy to have you if you were willing to work hard. And, if you are willing to make that commitment, it is a very rewarding experience. You could develop into a good rower if you have the right mindset. But if you're just in it for the scholarship money or don't have the right mentality (which, let me remind you, you are not going to get despite anyone on here's comments to the contrary), the sport is going to chew you up and spit you out in a month at the top collegiate level. The mental fortitude and sacrifice needed to row at the top level collegiately is unbelievable, probably the hardest thing i've ever had to do is rowing."

He would need to accomplish both of those things to even have a chance to get looked at, let alone get scholarship money, and there's no way he can. This is just a last ditch hail mary effort from a moderately athletic high schooler looking to backdoor his way into college, but the door is already closed for this avenue to him.  If he has actual financial issues with paying for school, resting his hopes on accomplishing some rowing pipe dream in under six months is not the way to relieve those financial problems. He's better off making some money working a job right now to lower the potential financial burden in the future and looking for need based aid or seeking out state schools with lower tuitions."

Rowing,3df5fl,2kIrezumi,2,Thu Jul 16 00:31:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert on the matter, but I do row for a club team so I can offer some insight. For starters, club teams are teams that don't get (most of) their funding from the school (Michigan, Grand Valley, Minnesota, etc). They're typically made up of athletes with little to no previous rowing experience, but that differs from school to school. They compete mostly in club team-specific regattas like Dad Vails and ACRAs. What you could call ""D1"" rowing is when teams are funded through their university, recruit high school rowers, and compete in regattas like Eastern Sprints and IRAs (Harvard, Yale, Washington). Rowing for a club team in the fall won't make a difference to coaches and will cost you more money, as well as time away from training with their programs.  As far as I'm aware of, there aren't really ""scholarships"" for any level of men's rowing. For ""D1"" teams, rowing coaches might be able to help you a little bit to get into the school, but you'll still have to earn your spot and funding through merit.  Since you've never rowed before, it will probably be tough to get the attention of most of those ""D1"" schools. There are a few schools that like to recruit some non-rowers, like Wisconsin. But plenty of those schools will take walk-ons - just talk to the coaches. If you can pull a fast 2k time, they'll be interested - ""fast"" meaning under 6:20 after a few attempts. I would shoot for under 7:00 your first time, based on your 500m time. However, make sure you're training properly. Get your form down! Try to find a local rowing club in your area and talk to a coach about technique and potentially getting some time in on the water."
Rowing,3df5fl,sheesh999,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:43:48 2015 UTC,"To piggyback off this comment, most IRA (formal varsity status) schools have men's rowing scholarships.

Good luck if you want to try for a scholarship, it's extraordinarily tough to come across one as a male rower."

But honestly that doesn't even matter because there is no way in hell this guy lands a rowing scholarship off of rowing 6 months and touching water for the first time during head race season. Even if he pulls monster erg times (which I doubt), ergs don't float and without on the water experience nobody would recruit you. I don't know why anyone is still stringing him along.

Ever since the '98 helium scandal, the rowing world has been cracking down on helium usage by lightweight rowers. To get around this, lightweights have been injecting helium into their veins but this unfortunately can prove fatal. However, there was a breakthrough at Eastern Sprints in 2011. The stroke of the Princeton light 2V used mirrors to make the number on the scale appear to be 159.9, when it was actually 199.5. While the effectiveness varies from boathouse to boathouse, mirrors are much more preferable to intravenous helium injections."

Rowing,3dcm33,triggahtrey,9,Wed Jul 15 05:38:21 2015 UTC,"Continue doing cardio. You're trying to get faster at an aerobic sport, aerobic exercise should be your first priority at all times.  The reason people say 'cardio kills gains' isn't because doing cardio prevents you from building muscle, it uses up calories that would otherwise help build muscle. The solution? Eat more.  You should aim for ~500 calories more than your TDEE (that's including exercise). For a LW, an hour of SS will burn roughly between 500-700 (I'm guessing). Eat more accordingly."
Rowing,3dcm33,BenW1994,6,Wed Jul 15 11:21:46 2015 UTC,"Are you trying to become a fast rower, or a power lifter?  If the former, then do cardio. If the latter, then stop rowing altogether and lift away.   Your 2k is going to suffer greatly if all you're doing is lifting."

In correlation analysis the closer the r coefficient is to 1 the more closely the two variables are related.   I'm not saying ignore cardio, you can't do anything in this sport without a strong aerobic base. Other studies suggest that in a 2k rowing race the physical demand on the body is roughly 75% aerobic and 25% anaerobic.  So while this is more of an aerobic sport your 2k can only be so low based on how much power your body is able to generate.  If you're serious about getting to the next level do your homework kid."

You will need carbs thrown in there as well so you can complete cardio workout without losing gains, but be careful toeing the line between an increase in carbs and too many"
Rowing,3dcm33,bjm94,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:45:00 2015 UTC,There are a couple of studies feature in 'Rowing Faster' that talk about the correlation between quad girth and faster 2k times.

In the photo finish, the pixel at the tip of Austria's bow ball was white and the pixel for the USA boat was grey (in the next frame they were both white), so they deemed Austria the winner.

Rowing,3dcfhn,Yellow130,6,Wed Jul 15 04:50:19 2015 UTC,"Keep up the steady state and set a more reasonable goal. Dropping 20 splits in a year is very significant, even for novices. Maybe try to aim for say, 8:40 or even just breaking 9, which are still big drops, but depending on how experienced you are now it could likely happen if you're dedicated enough. Also, how much do you weigh, if you're very light you could probably bring down your times a lot by lifting and putting on mass."
Rowing,3dcfhn,determinator007,4,Wed Jul 15 05:02:18 2015 UTC,"Build up the strength in the legs and try to do at least 4 (I'd recommend 6) 60' cardio sessions a week, not necessarily all erging. Also spend some time at your goal pace a couple times a week to get more comfortable with holding that split. That's a ton of time to drop so you might not be able to do that much. At the same time that increase is only about 80 Watts, the same as going from a 7:20 to mid 6:40s, which I did in a year of rowing, so it's very doable if you stick with it. Best of luck to you, train hard and smart."

Rowing,3dc2lr,OARneryRower,6,Wed Jul 15 16:31:49 2015 UTC,"That's an amazing score for a first try 2k for a lwt male. To give you some perspective, for the lwt male class, the following benchmarks apply:  -sub 7 to 6:50 is respectable. Not scoffed at, but not admired either  -6:40-6:49 is quite solid  -6:30-39 is strong  -6:20-29 is incredibly competitive  -sub 6:20 is considered elite/verging on elite at the U23 level  You have huge potential. Granted, being able to row and having a big erg score are two different things, but once you get some good coaching and learn how to row you can do some seriously good stuff with rowing.   Seriously, go find a rowing club in your area and start rowing. Or join your university's novice team in the fall.  Edit: I realize how vague these evaluations of 2k scores are, lol, but hopefully it gives you an idea of what experienced rowers are pulling. Keep in mind, as you obviously know, that success with these ergs is attained in conjunction with good technique."

Personal (completely uneducated) theories are:  1- Tendonitis (inflammation in the tendons of the hands.) hurts, but unless you tear something shouldn't get much worse.  2- Stress fractures. This is what I fear I have. Years of gripping loosely like a hook on the oar puts all the pressure on the finger bones between the first and second knuckles. Those bones just aren't meant to bear that much pressure.  3- Arthritis. I'm 26 but all my joints started aching in my early 20s, and it started in the fingers. If this is it, there's not much we can do.  Good luck buddy, I hope someone with better answers than mine shows up and tells us it'll be ok lol."

I asked my friend about it, and he told me that I'm everyday life, people really mostly on their index, middle, and pinky fingers to do all the gripping they need. The ring finger is just kinda there unless you use it specifically. And when you erg, it can be easy to also put all the stress in those fingers. When they get tired, all the work then falls on your ring finger. Now I don't know if this is correct, but I focused on using all my fingers together and the problem went away!"

This could come from oar length (inboard, outboard or both), foot stretcher positioning, or where your oarlocks are (span).   I would have someone knowledgeable at your club take a look at the rig on your oars first. If you're borrowing oars from an eight while you row the pair, try throwing on some clams to see if things get any easier.   I would suggest moving the feet back only as a last resort, as length to the front is very important (though too much is detrimental!)"

Rowing,3d8tdk,manofoar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:59:43 2015 UTC,"The first step is to create in your mind a good example that you want to emulate in the real world. Let's break down what a perfect catch is.  I think it's fair to say that a perfect catch would be one where the blade is instantly buried, with zero slip, and instant power application right at the moment of instant burial.  Now, this perfect catch is, technically, impossible to do in the real world. Tthe boat is moving, the blades don't go from zero to infinity in speed while being buried, power application doesn't go from zero to max in zero time, etc.  So, the next step is to observe and experiment.  Each person's body is different from everyone else, but by trying out what other people appear to do, and then tweaking that adjust to your own ability is how you create the best catch for you.  Having a coach who can observe what you are doing and letting you know when you are doing something that doesn't help is beneficial.  And finally, the numbers are what make the final decision - if it makes you faster, keep doing it!"
Rowing,3d6vze,jspross93,5,Tue Jul 14 00:06:36 2015 UTC,"Tricky question, I've been wondering the same thing. I guess if you keep training in the single, you will be fitter (if you're training enough).   However, keep in mind that rowing the single should ideally be teaching you how to move the boat over making you fitter. Obviously, you're probably getting fitter as well (there's no such thing as an easy row in a 1x), but your true focus should be on being more efficient in the boat as opposed to hitting a certain HR.  What I'm doing this summer is still doing a few erg pieces a week (you only have to do 1 or 2, if you want), just to keep an eye on how my splits are progressing over the summer and have an idea of what I will pull on fall tests."
Rowing,3d6vze,MightyLighty,2,Tue Jul 14 00:23:48 2015 UTC,Rowinginmotion app has an efficiency stat and I watch that the most for the reasons you say. Stream/wind affect 500m splits too.
Rowing,3d6vze,zknarc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:06:18 2015 UTC,Thats actually a great idea. I already do an AT piece on the weekends so maybe I'll throw in a steady state or something to benchmark
Rowing,3d6vze,OARneryRower,3,Tue Jul 14 11:21:33 2015 UTC,"If you work well with numbers/data (I am a data freak myself so I sympathize), you may want to consider investing in a GPS watch so you can track your training. I LOVE my Garmin Forerunner! It allows me to track my speed during workouts (in real time) as well as HR, distance rowed etc. I can then upload data to the Garmin Connect app and store info there about training sessions. The watch (forerunner 15) was less than 200$ and comes with a HR belt. A few other girls around the center have this same watch and we all appreciate the pace feature (it will give your speed in time per 1000m (easy to convert mentally to splits))."
Rowing,3d6vze,RandomSculler,2,Tue Jul 14 02:07:55 2015 UTC,"Agree with this, currently there's no reasonably priced reliable power meter for rowing so the best way to measure performance is by tracking boatspeed and comparing it to HR. Remember that HR is a notoriously inaccurate measurement and also drifts up over time so I would try and keep the boat speed the same and look at comparing your end avg speed and end avg HR and see how that improves over time. Just make sure you're not overcooking the pacing (i.e. if youre ending up spending a lot of time with your HR a bit close to your HRmax!)   One other point to add is that a GPS is great on flat water but if you row on a river with a current its a lot less useful (as it will show you going slower upstream and faster downstream), so in those cases I would recommend getting an NK Speedcoach with an impeller.  If you can afford it then the NK GPS 2.0 is the best to get, like the Garmin you can connect a bluetooth smart HR belt and then track your HR, and after your outing download the workout and upload it to Garmin Connect/Training Peaks etc in the same way"

Rowing,3d5zxu,halogen1212,3,Mon Jul 13 20:09:36 2015 UTC,"Calories are a good measurement. The way they work is a little tricky though. Basically you are rewarded for going harder...for example (using made up numbers) if you row 500 meters at paddle pressure, it will take you 3 min and you will burn 20 calories, but if you row 500 meters at a 1:30, it will take you half the time, and you will burn 40 calories...HOWEVER...a trained rower vs a crossfit class will be able to smoke everyone on the erg. Don't kill yourself on the erg, and save yourself for the other exercises."
Rowing,3d5zxu,enohcs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:19:38 2015 UTC,Cool pretty much what i thought but how does rate come into it. I was rating very high 38 spm while the others where rating fairly slowly about 18 spm. Was there slower rate with possibly harder pressure making the calorie counter tick slower but the distance go faster?
Rowing,3d5zxu,catandDuck,2,Mon Jul 13 20:22:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, the lower rate will make the distance per calorie higher.  Take the example above- if you're rowing slowly at a 3 min pace, after 1:30 you will burn 10 calories and travel 250 meters. If you row at a 1:30, after ~23 seconds you burn 10 calories, but travel only 125 meters.   This is because it takes 8 times as many watts (and calories) to half a split time. By that, I mean rowing at a 1:00 requires 8 times the power as rowing at a 2:00.  In the end, calories aren't the most helpful indicators of how you're erging, but can certainly be a great way to mix things up (like you did at crossfit)."
Rowing,3d5zxu,enohcs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:38:07 2015 UTC,"not sure...you've reached the limit of what I discovered while erging in crossfit. Unfortunately you can't ""game"" the erg. Just row at a comfortable rate/pressure and don't kill yourself on it. Killing yourself on the erg will kill the rest of the workout. If it's an egring only workout, then go all out."

Rowing,3d5zxu,BaraccoliObama,5,Tue Jul 14 00:49:59 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this exactly answers your question, but the Performance Monitor calorie counts on the Concept 2 rowers are based on a 175 lb person. They offer a calculator to figure out how much you have burned if you weigh differently here.  Did some digging and came across a post on the C2 forums that pointed to an equation from C2 which is used to calculated displayed calories. The PM displays a calorie value based on wattage and time.  So it's only bullshit in the context of the metric of the workout. People would have burned more or less calories relative to what the PM was displaying depending on their weight/size. But at the end of the day if all you're worried about was getting a workout in it was fine; if you're worried about making sure you're faster than other people then pace/watts would be better."

Rowing,3d6ewo,pagregs99,2,Mon Jul 13 22:03:37 2015 UTC,"Resting HR should ideally be taken right when you wake up and are still in bed.   Keep in mind that you sitting on a yoga mat after practice is not your resting HR, despite the fact that you are resting.   If this is your true resting HR, then yes, it is higher than one would expect it to be, but I don't think it's high enough to be concerned. If your resting was 90-100, that would be a different story.   Maybe try taking it a few more times in different conditions (making sure you hydrate well, right after waking up from a good night's sleep, etc.) and see if there are any changes. If it's still really worrying you, go talk to your doctor, not some random folks on reddit."
Rowing,3d6ewo,MightyLighty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:27:50 2015 UTC,"That's fairly normal to be honest. I wouldn't start worrying until it hit 100  If it's suddenly got a lot higher, then you might be overtraining or getting ill. Or had too much coffee that morning. Or been worried about something. Or your blood sugar might have been low."
Rowing,3d6ewo,SidViciious,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:35:33 2015 UTC,"When and how did you measure it? It's very possible that's not your true resting HR.   If it is, it's higher than ""normal"" but by itself I'm not sure it's a sign of imminent health problems."
Rowing,3d5df0,enohcs,3,Mon Jul 13 17:33:36 2015 UTC,It'll probably take about 10 minutes. Increases after that are either due to (1) the intensity being too high for the length of workout and/or (2) cardiac drift.
Rowing,3d5df0,acunc,0,Mon Jul 13 17:50:33 2015 UTC,"so if it takes 30 min, then the SS intensity is not enough? I'm new to this HR thing. I did a 40min piece at even 2:00 splits. Based on feel, this is where I put my SS pressure at. It took 30min for me to get up to 150bpm, then my HR settled between 150 and 155. For the last 10min I had no problem keeping it in that range at my 2:00 pace."
Rowing,3d5df0,ThunerboltRiley,0,Mon Jul 13 18:02:40 2015 UTC,"If your SS heart rate range is between 150-155, you have serious control over your heart lol. It's right to say about 10 minutes sometimes less or more. A SS range could be from 135-155 or 145-165 or even 130-150. It all depends on your body type and your current condition. If you naturally have a low resting heart heart like sub40 then maybe try to stay in that 130-150 range. If your rhr is over 60 I would definitely shoot for the 145-165. Regardless within ten minutes maybe even 5 you should be at the bottom of your range, whatever range that may be.  To be even more accurate:  you want to NOT exceed certain lactate levels so good job on starting to use the heart rate for ss but your still guessing in the dark sorta until you get your lactate levels tested.  People do it all the time without, though."
Rowing,3d5df0,acunc,3,Tue Jul 14 11:48:54 2015 UTC,"I think that if you erg in a well ventilated, cool-ish (below 80 degrees) room, it's not all that difficult to keep your HR in a tight band when doing SS. I generally keep my HR between 138-143 with some minimal variation (it'll creep up in the last 1k or so usually). I always erg with fans on and try to stay well hydrated.   /u/enohcs/ If your HR is still rising after 30 minutes you may be going too fast, not too slow. Like I said above make sure you're in a well ventilated room and the temp isn't too high - both those factors could make your HR keep rising during SS if not kept under control."

Rowing,3d3xxw,christopherbird,13,Mon Jul 13 09:27:57 2015 UTC,"for the 3 seat ""tale"", In a club crew (or really, any crew not considered high performance), where the difference in technical ability, rower to rower, can be quite large, 3 seat is most likely the position you are going to put them. 3 seat is a meathead seat, in that, there only real responsibility (other than staying in time) is to drive the boat.  In squads where the top 8 is full of guys who are as good (or pretty close to being as good) as each other then it doesnt matter at all and you seat people more on what seating order is going to make the boat go its fastest.  As for the bow pair ""tale"", most people who have rowed in top 8s (nationally or internationally) can tell you that there is a significant amount of damage a rower rowing in bow or 2 can do to the set of the boat by throwing his hands all over the place. Yes you are right that if you put a boat with no oars in it and no people and then pushed on different riggers it would equally affect the boat. however that is a pointless example because that isn't an accurate representation of the forces in play whilst rowing. I don't have any articles or enough of a scientific background to give you the whys behind this. I am purely speaking from experience. I have spent a number of years rowing top 8s and am  currently a member of the NZ elite rowing team."

Rowing,3d3xxw,NeedsmoreCELLTECH,6,Mon Jul 13 17:59:52 2015 UTC,"As I understand, the width of the boat is greater in the middle compared to either end, so an equal outward force would cause varying effects on balance, depending on where in the boat the force came from. This means that you should put more technical / lighter rowers at either end of the boat, and less technical / heavier rowers in the middle. It will only effect balance, however.  Also, the further forward someone is, the more people who are trying to follow their rhythm, the greater their 'influence' on the rest of the crew (with the stroke man having significantly more than the rest).  These two factors combine to mean that the 3 man has the least combined responsibility over balance and rhythm."
Rowing,3d3xxw,BenW1994,-5,Mon Jul 13 11:44:37 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with your point about rhythm and the importance of having a good stern pair that the rest of the crew can follow, but I don't understand your first point.   Imagine a boat sitting in the water (no oars or people in it); if you apply a downwards force to, say bow's rigger, would that not have the same effect as applying an equal force to the 5-seat rigger? The boat is a single system, so assuming the oarlocks are all an equal distance from the centre of the hull, I would expect the same effect at each seat."
Rowing,3d3xxw,BenW1994,2,Mon Jul 13 12:55:31 2015 UTC,"I haven't studied statics, and haven't studied any mechanics in years, only read this theory which fits in nicely with what I've heard about seat positioning and have observed myself. You need someone else to answer all of your questions."
Rowing,3d3xxw,jscaine,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:59:14 2015 UTC,"The boat is widest at the center though, not sure 100% that this means oar locks are farther out, but I think they are, which would mean equal force wouldn't have the same effect. There are also issues about torque laterally across the bow. The farther you are from the skeg, the more torque you exert laterally across the boat, and thus if you screw up, you upset the point more the farther you are from the skeg."
Rowing,3d3xxw,coxcoxcox,2,Wed Jul 15 06:04:04 2015 UTC,"The position of the pin (centre of the oarlock) is measured from the centre line of the boat, not the side of the boat. This means that the oarlock is not further out in the middle of the boat than the ends."
Rowing,3d3xxw,zknarc,3,Wed Jul 15 12:10:15 2015 UTC,Bow pair are furthest from the fin so put the greatest amount of torque on the boat (think longer screwdriver = more torque).
Rowing,3d3xxw,petersculls,-3,Mon Jul 13 11:45:05 2015 UTC,"I'm confused by your screwdriver example. Do you mean 'longer lever = greater torque'? A long screwdriver is no better at turning screws than a short screwdriver.  I think your point is that each rower in bow pair has a greater ability to turn the boat than someone in the middle of the boat, which is absolutely true (and is the reason why coxes have bow pair make adjustments when sitting on a start line). But I don't see how that relates to an increased ability to balance the boat."
Rowing,3d3xxw,jscaine,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:03:33 2015 UTC,The boats today are stiffer then the some of the wooden ones of the past. You could have the stern set/level and the bow not set/level by how the rowers controlled the handles. So I think zknarc is saying that the fin can help set the boat in the stern but as you get more to the bow the flex in the boat could allow some twist.
Rowing,3d3xxw,luieisawesome,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:37:24 2015 UTC,"Aside from the fact that the lateral torque itself can slow the boat down and upset the point, it can upset the set in a similar way as taking a right turn can upset the set."
Rowing,3d3xxw,Lorenzostarboard,3,Wed Jul 15 06:06:48 2015 UTC,"The blades of the bow pair have to face the most wind due to the movement of the boat, and so they ""carve"" out a path in the air that the rest of the rowers oars can slip stream in, so if they are waving their hands around everywhere it has the largest effect, having said that if anyone is doing it then it's not going to help."
Rowing,3d3xxw,dunkster91,-1,Mon Jul 13 10:28:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea, but I'm not really convinced; even in a headwind I can't imagine that there would be a significant slipstreaming effect, given how low the speeds are, the (relatively) small size of the spoons, and the distance between each oar. Anybody with some fluid dynamics knowledge want to comment?"
Rowing,3d3xxw,kitd,3,Mon Jul 13 12:48:47 2015 UTC,"You are wrong to not be convinced. It does not matter what we all tell you, it's a matter of experience. Anyone who has spent time in each seat can tell you exactly how each position contributes differently. These are not myths."

Rowing,3d3xxw,coxcoxcox,6,Mon Jul 13 15:56:43 2015 UTC,"A couple of potential reasons to have a technically proficient bow-pair:   The bow porpoises in and out of the water through the stroke cycle, making bladework a little trickier. Rowers that are better technically can minimise the porpoising by staying horizontal, and not let it affect their stroke. Bow pair are furthest from the stroke so it's easier for them to get out of time, particularly with rush."

It's also way harder to make weight for international competition for many of the erg heavy hitters. The US LM8 pieced Columbia and Harvard before they both left for English Henley and beat them pretty badly. Considering the US's LM8 record at worlds the past few years, collegiate ltwt 8's would not be competitive."

Rowing,3d1w9l,theicemanguy,6,Mon Jul 13 02:14:02 2015 UTC,"""Political system""? Do you just mean system in general? I don't think that's the case, although it's obvious that funding is a huge obstacle to success. I simply think that if you're going to represent your country at Worlds you should actually be of international standard."
Rowing,3d1w9l,petersculls,2,Mon Jul 13 07:20:38 2015 UTC,"No, I meant political system. It is a world stage. Perhaps not at the Olympic level where countries are much more aware of the propaganda value of winning gold medals and the count. After all countries reward the sports, athletes, and coaches that perform well with added funds. For the USA the US Olympic Committee holds some of the purse strings.   Was 1936 Berlin a show case. China, US, Russia that much different in wanting a show case? The truth is though I wanted to know what is your embarrassment as some people have taken this same argument (embarrassment) to the point of only the Olympics count and only a gold is good enough and if you can't get that then you should stay home. Myself I think you don't get any better staying home."
Rowing,3d1w9l,theicemanguy,3,Mon Jul 13 17:12:30 2015 UTC,"Because as someone who competes for my country (not the USA), I would hope that if my crew couldn't put up a competitive time in training then we wouldn't go race. It is a matter of pride. If I see a crew do as badly as the US LM8+ have done then it reflects incredibly poorly on the country and rowing federation in question.  I think the argument that only a gold matters is absurd, we're talking about a completely uncompetitive crew racing at Worlds and representing their country."

Rowing,3d0wr5,steelcurtain09,5,Sun Jul 12 18:05:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the best tip I can give isn't about the stroke at all. You can know how to row a stroke perfectly, but if you don't learn how to retain your technique when you get tired, it won't make any difference during a race (when it actually matters).  My advice would be to find out which components of your form are the first to suffer during the final stretch of a hard piece or the sprint of a race. Do you start to slouch? Is your slide controlled, or are you yanking yourself up to the catch? You need to remember to analyze yourself on the brink of over-exertion, when the only thing in your head is surviving long enough to cross the finish line.  Once you've located your vice(s), accentuate them during practice. For example, if you're slouching, maybe exaggerate your lay-back a little and focus extra hard on keeping a flawless posture. Doing this will build muscle memory as well as muscle mass, so you'll be stronger in the places that are first to give out.  TLDR; Find out what deteriorates first when you get tired and accentuate good form in those areas during practice."
Rowing,3d0wr5,neidlint,3,Mon Jul 13 00:31:48 2015 UTC,"Big emphasis on the drive. Backing the blade in, straight arms to the finish, and strong exit to set up for the next one."

General advice would be lots of steady state, then more anaerobic threshold and vo2 max pieces as the 2k approaches. But you can get more out of your training if you identify your weakness and work on it.   Look up (can't recall where I saw this now, but it should be relatively painless to find) what the relationship between each test (peak power, 1min test, 2k, and 6k) should be for a perfectly well-rounded individual. Then see where your times are lacking the most, and place most of your focus on improving that area.   For example, if you're at 82%% GMS for your peak power and 83% for 1min test, but 71% for your 6k, then it would be your aerobic base that needs the most work, so your prescription would be mostly steady state until it's time to sharpen up for a 2k.   Keep in mind, though, that regardless of what your fitness profile is, your aerobic base can probably use developing, unless you came from 10 years of competitive cross-country skiing or something.

Dik-diks stand about 30–40 cm (12–16 in) at the shoulder, are 50–70 cm (20–28 in) long, weigh 3–6 kg (7–16 lb) and can live for up to 10 years. Dik-diks are named for the alarm calls of the females. In addition to the females' alarm call, both the male and female make a shrill, whistling sound. These calls may alert other animals to predators.

Rowing,3cta0u,honestlyduuude,25,Fri Jul 10 16:25:42 2015 UTC,I find it crazy that the Huskies and other top American universities can bring over their entire squad yet the national team struggle to make U23 Worlds due to financial issues.
Rowing,3cta0u,ManBearSloth,12,Fri Jul 10 17:15:00 2015 UTC,"Alumni donations.... definitely a shame that funding would be an impediment for any US rowing team at any level (U23, senior, junior)."
Rowing,3cta0u,acunc,5,Fri Jul 10 17:44:30 2015 UTC,"It's cool to see (from working with them) that USRowing makes as big of an effort as possible to provide grants especially for junior athletes. We issued some sizable grants to junior national camp invitees who otherwise would not have been able to afford it.  It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that any high schooler that rows is well off enough to pay for a trip to a national team camp, but upwards of $5,000 including travel costs for a camp would be a burden on most people.  It's definitely still tough on all levels though and, again, just a shame that money can be an obstacle that stops an otherwise amazing athlete from succeeding. The beauty of non-revenue sports, huh?"

Rowing,3cta0u,avo_cado,2,Fri Jul 10 21:52:46 2015 UTC,"It's tough. There isn't necessarily that same connection. The number of athletes is fewer. People feel less connected to the ""system"" than to their colleges which provided them with an ""experience."" It takes a long time to set up an endowment with enough money to support all the travelling. Etc.  At the end of the day, rowing's your job. It's a great job, but it's tough to get people to cough up for what's essentially your employer."
Rowing,3cta0u,theicemanguy,2,Sat Jul 11 01:26:15 2015 UTC,"Also, the people who row at top universities, then go off and start working for the rest of their lives will likely make more money than those who spend the most productive years of their lives on tiny sports grants.

Take a look at some results from races like Masters Nationals. Potomac Boat Club in DC dominated last year. Saugatuck and Maritime Rowing Club in Connecticut are solid programs. Vesper Boat Club and University Barge Club in Philly does well. Just naming a few that I've seen firsthand.  I'm doing some rowing with a masters club while I have a summer internship and it's not particularly competitive. They attend a lot of races but especially on the men's side, pretty lacking in the young strong talent department.  It can go either way with masters, so just take a look at their races and results!"
Rowing,3ctl3t,barelyheavyweight,4,Fri Jul 10 17:56:58 2015 UTC,"Masters is a big tent. If you call anything post-college masters, then you're including Riverside high performance group, this year's university barge club eight from Henley, union's eight that won San Diego Masters A, etc., most of which are solely focused on a level of performance somewhere at (beyond?) the top of Vails, eights going around 5:40-5:45 or so. Then there are club like Marin and Potomac (shameless plug) that (try to) do that but within a much larger group that includes competitively-focused (ie, let's medal at HOCR) masters and senior masters crews. Then there are also lots of masters (sometimes specifically labeled ""competitive masters"") that are often affiliated with a learn to row program and act as the next development step for folks coming to rowing post-college or that come from less competitive backgrounds or are looking to be less intense at their stage of life."

Now there are handicaps based on boat age (first across the finish line doesn't always win), and sprint races are only 1000 meters (which is actually a lot of fun). The coaching programs are more tailored for the working person who isn't the young kid who has national team aspirations. We row 3 mornings a week, and that's probably most of the working out a masters athlete does in a given week. It's a laid back group who still enjoy the sport, and competing, but now has other work/family obligations that can take priority at any time. For the over 23 group who still has that drive to compete at a high level, RBC has the open group which has the expectations of daily workouts on and off the water.

He doesn't really 'fill' the silence, if that makes sense, doesn't say lots of things within each stroke (i.e. no 'catch, send'). Another really great example of this style of coxing is the Australian LM8 at 2011 World champs (it's on youtube)."
Rowing,3cucfi,jawocha,3,Wed Jul 15 13:15:20 2015 UTC,"I disagree , sometimes the silence is okay and a way to let us  just push ourselves and the boat move. When the boat is pushing a long  nice  the cox cam let the shell slice through the water. On the other hand if the boat sucks it fan good for the cox to stfu after awhile of failed calls to get it back. The silence probably shouldn't be more than like 5-10 strokes (10 would a be a lot, but if you're crushing it who cares  ).   This question is a toughy though because so much in regards to coxing is opinion changing bared on crew"
Rowing,3cucfi,JFang16,4,Fri Jul 10 21:49:51 2015 UTC,"To me, you need to be on top of your crew, keeping them focused on technique, and the way they are moving the boat. If you let them break focus they start to think about the pain or the other boats, and their job is just to push and trust you to tell them what they need to do. So keep them as engaged as you possibly can."

Rowing,3cucfi,imdblurker,3,Sat Jul 11 13:04:45 2015 UTC,"It's usually preferred to constantly speak, but I think tone is much more influential. Changes in the way you talk are more indicative of when to make moves/shift during races because a rower wont necessarily pay attention to every individual word you say. But if you manipulate your cadence and verbal rhythm to match the importance and meaning of what you are saying, it's a cue that they won't block out."
Rowing,3cucfi,morpen8,2,Sun Jul 12 20:35:11 2015 UTC,"I think this is subjective. It really depends on the way your crews compose themselves mentally.

Rowing,3cucfi,pagregs99,2,Sat Jul 11 14:11:23 2015 UTC,"Our coxswain would utter a slow, non-stop murmur of calls giving us location of other crews, technical focuses, etc. The constant noise helped distract from the pain of lactate throughout the race, and allowed us to ensure that we kept our technique together."

As mentioned before, it depends where in the word you are and who you are coxing (men's/women's, novice/seniors etc)  I prefer the latter or silence between calls when rowing assuming a call will be every ten strokes or so. No matter what you do, you need to give the rowers time to make the changes you are after and to work on those changes. Basically repeat them until the changes happen. If you keep swapping your focus, it's really distracting. Also, use short phrases or words that sound distinct to one another. Full sentences or streams of consciousness just don't get processed in my head mid-race. Cut the motivational crap and tell me how to get faster in the shortest way possible"

I like it that way because it keeps you in the zone and lets the crew stay in unison.

You don't want to be screaming and yelling for the whole race, that can irritate a lot of rowers. Your tone should directly correlate to what you are trying to get across. For example, the start should be intense and aggressive, then through the body of the race I like to be intense but relaxed with my tone while making technical observations or giving positions. WHen I make a move or call power strokes, bring the tone and volume back up to show that it is time to move. Obviously the ending sprint should be about the most adrenaline pumping part, so give it all you got. This is just specific to my boat this season, everyone is very different. The best thing you can do is ask your rowers ahead of time and work the kinks out in practice. My guys would ask me for certain calls and at what point they wanted to hear them before a race. That seemed to work really well knowing what to expect but still having some on the spot calls as well."
Rowing,3cucfi,twicemoneyswagg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:37:22 2015 UTC,"IMO a good coxswain does three things (besides steering the boat) during a race:    Keeps the crew informed about where they are in the race in terms of distance and margins. Coordinates with the stroke seat to execute the race plan (keep the boat at or around a certain rate, adjusting for moves or pushes, etc.) Uses their voice to make technical corrections, and to keep the boat calm, organized, and motivated.   In my experience, a good coxswain fills basically the whole of the race by completing these three jobs. A moment of silence can be a way to bring focus back in (""Where did the angry voice go?"") before issuing an important part of the race plan or some other key call. Besides this, however, I can't think of a good reason for a coxswain not to be saying something at basically all times during a race.  Listen to a good coxswain recording - there are plenty on the internet, and most of them feature very little silence during races."

Rowing,3cr19i,KanyeChex,11,Fri Jul 10 02:12:17 2015 UTC,I would say 24k a day is the most you should do consistently.
Rowing,3cr19i,IamTheMath,0,Fri Jul 10 02:29:55 2015 UTC,Maybe 24k in your long workout of the day.
Rowing,3cr19i,SareonInBC,4,Fri Jul 10 15:44:08 2015 UTC,"A phrase mentioned to me previously ""There isn't such a thing as over training, only under resting."""
Rowing,3cr19i,Patrikx,2,Fri Jul 10 11:36:52 2015 UTC,"Follow up question: Is there is a set ratio between meters vs rest time? Or is it completely dependent on the rower's experience, strength, etc.?"
Rowing,3cr19i,determinator007,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:20:19 2015 UTC,Depends mostly on intensity
Rowing,3cr19i,Ctheo32,2,Sat Jul 11 17:33:59 2015 UTC,"SS is very beneficial as it builds your aerobic base, helping you to power through the body of the 2k.  The good thing about SS is that you can do a lot of it and be able to recover from it very quickly.  However, SS doesn't hurt you if you practice proper technique.  If you think you are hurting yourself from SS, you might want to take a good look at your form, because that is the only reason you could be hurting.  Finally, there is not really a limit of how much you can do before you hurt yourself, so feel free to do as much as you want... 38k SS in one day isn't a lot compared to some of the work teams do training for nationals, so consider yourself lucky.   I wish you the best in your training endeavours."
Rowing,3cr19i,bloodisblue,19,Fri Jul 10 04:56:46 2015 UTC,To add a counterpoint to ctheo's very good points. The national team has built up to that level over years of training doing small amounts more per week or month. A near 100% increase in volume in a week is not sustainable. I would recommend much smaller increments in training volume on a week to week or month to month basis.  Edit. Looked at your comments and found that you're 15.5 years old and this workout will take well over 2 hours for you or nearly anyone. That seems quite extreme and if a coach is telling you to do that workout.
Rowing,3cr19i,smokebathsalts,7,Fri Jul 10 05:30:05 2015 UTC,"Bloodisblue is right. Takes a while to get there. After 7 years rowing, most of those at a grand final d1 school, 38k would still be considered a long day, and at the height of our training I doubt we'd hit that every day of the week.  That said, there were times when we hit numbers in the 50k range, but never was that ever all on an erg. Not even close"
Rowing,3cr19i,Tsav150,3,Fri Jul 10 06:41:30 2015 UTC,"I was told in a conversation with a past gold medalist in the olympics that the top guys in the single (xeno muller, rob waddel, mahe drysdale ) would normally do about 160k per week in the single when not racing. plus a couple weights sessions and some biking."
Rowing,3cr19i,SidViciious,2,Fri Jul 10 16:23:16 2015 UTC,"Update: It's been a while since I posted, so here are my current numbers: *16 years old *130 lbs/~59 kg *best 2k split: 1:55.5 *height:165 cm/~5'5'' About the 100% increase: it's more closer to a 200% increase."

Rowing,3cqlwu,steelcurtain09,2,Fri Jul 10 09:09:42 2015 UTC,"You've been doing stronglifts and averaging 120k per week for 5 weeks now. It's gonna be hard to keep increasing your lifts and still do your 2x45'. There just won't be enough time for your body to recover. I've been quoted that it takes your body about 12 hours to recover from proper steady state, but it takes longer than that for lifting. So your body has slowly been accumulating fatigue but it hasn't been a problem because the weights were low and you could handle it. I would definitely recommend deloading to see if that helps. If it doesn't then you either need to lower your volume a bit to keep increasing the weight in your lifts or accept slower increases if you want to keep your volume the same."
Rowing,3cqlwu,SareonInBC,2,Fri Jul 10 15:28:17 2015 UTC,"I've read similar papers suggesting a 12hr timeframe for recovery from SS. I'm going to deload and hopefully see how that goes. If I fail again, I might switch to a periodization program. I refuse to change my SS volume. Thanks for the advice. And H2P"
Rowing,3cqlwu,promitchuous,2,Fri Jul 10 17:12:24 2015 UTC,"Linear programs are good for rowers who have never lifted but it becomes quick to plateau as you cannot recover properly when you are doing 2-3 cardio sessions a day.  It's normal to feel like you did, deload try again.  Once you get caught in a fail-deload program you need to look at a weight training program that is more cardio friendly, something with a longer periodization and smaller increase in weight."

I am largely sedentary at work, though I do have to walk there (about 15 min). I've been putting on 2lbs a week for about 5 weeks now. I am 20, 5'9"" and weigh 151."
Rowing,3cqlwu,Patrikx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:40:52 2015 UTC,Have you been doing this training plan for a long time? It's quite a bit of volume so if you just started doing it then your body might just be adjusting to the amount of work. Otherwise it might be a matter of getting enough good sleep. Either way there's no shame in deloading your weights until you break through a plateau. You're still building muscle even as you decrease the weight a little. Have you noticed it being harder to hold a certain split for the SS pieces? Or have those been going okay?
Rowing,3cqlwu,graphitical,2,Fri Jul 10 00:53:52 2015 UTC,"I've been on the program for a month now. I ramped the volume up slowly to try to avoid that, and I  started with lighter weights for the lifts. As for sleep, I get between 7-8 hours a night. It's hard to get more. The SS pieces have actually been progressing really well. I set a new personal best each week."
Rowing,3cqlwu,Kaertske,2,Fri Jul 10 01:07:39 2015 UTC,"Then I wouldn't worry too much. You're definitely making strength gains and the muscle is definitely growing. Stick with SL 5x5 making minor adjustments as needed until your numbers get a little higher, then I'd recommend checking out the mad cow 5x5 program. It's a bit tougher than SL but you'll see major improvements. Cheers!"

Rowing,3cpnp9,acunc,3,Thu Jul 9 19:54:27 2015 UTC,"Mono is tricky because people react to it in drastically different ways. I've known people who noticed dips in their physical performance, chalked it up to a little overtraining or something, and only found out months later from an unrelated blood test that they had mono. I've also known people who were essentially incapacitated for a couple of weeks, and dropped significant weight because their appetite dissolved.  If you aren't eating enough, lack of exercise will probably result in some level of muscular atrophy and strength loss. If you keep eating enough to cover your caloric needs, preferably with at least a gram of protein per pound of bodyweight, you are putting yourself in the best possible position to retain your muscle mass.  Given the choice, I would take keeping the muscle and putting on some fat over losing muscle mass at the same weight. It is generally easier to lose fat than it is to gain muscle, and that is especially true in the sport of rowing, where high levels of calorie burn come with the territory of daily training.  I'm not a doctor, so take everything I said with a large grain of salt."

Rowing,3cor8s,enohcs,3,Thu Jul 9 16:00:05 2015 UTC,"So I think this comes down to a matter of preference (unless your coach tells you a number - then do that).  I have heard from friends that Xeno advocates doing long distance pieces at a high DF, with a specific HR target as well as optimizing DF on an individual basis for test pieces.  Other friends have told me that when training in New Zealand they did many pieces with low DF to emphasize the initial phase of the drive as well as get more work in without injury.  The two most relevant pieces of literature I have found on the subject are: http://www.biorow.com/RBN_en_2011_files/2011RowBiomNews01.pdf and the other one is now taken down, but is called ""A Discussion of Fixed vs Dynamic Ergometers"" by Ivan Hooper where he studied the Australian national team and drew conclusions about rate of injury due to peak force on the lumbar spine. Basically he advocated lower DFs as key as well as transitioning a lot of training to dynamic ergometers."

If you cut down on salt consumption, your body will retain more salt.  If you eat things with lots of salt, your body will get rid of the excess to keep it at equilibrium.  Sure, salt retains water.  But lots of people neglect the fact that your body does a pretty good job of regulating its salt content.  Do you just have to be under 160, or do you have to be lighter to make a 155 boat average?  If it's just a 160 limit you're shooting for, just maintain it for this week and cut down on liquids the night before.  Don't do more than you have to!  It's perfectly acceptable to cut it close and weigh in at 159.9, so no need to be more than a pound under.  You want to stay as hydrated as possible while staying at weight."

Sub 160 is a different story. If you just need to drop .3lb eat a lighter meal than you usually do a couple of times and weigh in before you eat if possible.

You'll only want to eat so much of them before they taste like shit. This may not be the healthiest,  but it works.  Source: I wrestled and frequently cut 15 lbs."
Rowing,3cpd25,blue___sea,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:47:13 2015 UTC,"Dropping weight fast is all about manipulating your water and sodium levels. It's counterintuitive but it works- If you're cutting salt you need to OVERFLOW your body with water so that it starts flushing (i.e. aim to pee every hour). By drinking lots of water early on you down-regulate aldosterone, a hormone that acts to conserve sodium and secrete potassium. So just say you have weigh in on Friday - you cut salt and drink a shit load of water Monday - Wednesday so that you're peeing hourly. From Weds to Thurs you want to drink enough so that you're peeing every 3 ish hours. Then 24 hours before weigh in you start tapering off. Your body will be used to flushing so you should expect to get in a good pee friday morning and then don't drink much until Friday weigh in. When you reduce water towards the end of the week your body will still be ""flushing"" i.e. you'll be peeing regularly even though you're hardly drinking any water.  Cut fibrous foods 24 h before weigh in. Focus on eating lean protein and fat, i.e. dinner before weigh in: chicken breast with 1 cup of white rice with 1/3 avocado.    If you're cutting salt AS SOON AS YOU WEIGH IN (assuming you don't have another weigh in) it is VERY important to get your water-sodium levels back to normal. Chug and water w/ a electrolyte tablet and continue drinking water and having electrolytes/salt. Goal is to pee every 3 hours."
Rowing,3cpd25,acunc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:04:19 2015 UTC,Anything processed. Just make your own food and you're pretty much guaranteed to cut out the vast majority of your salt intake.   Just don't give up salt completely - your body needs a certain amount of it.

Rowing,3cm0dh,Cwcarter,7,Wed Jul 8 23:18:38 2015 UTC,"Hey!  1) y'all need to nail down the borrowing boats policy- I don't see how you can have a rowing team at all if there's no boats to row in. See if the college coach (I assume LSU or Tulane?) will put it in writing: what boats are allowed to be borrowed by your club at what times, so there is no confusion. If possible, you might offer something in return as a token of gratitude, such as helping the college team fundraise or saying that each team member will volunteer to help out at a local regatta for X number of hours.  2) y'all absolutely need a coach. I respect your efforts as a captain for sure but there is just no way that with 0 experience you will be able to make any meaningful progress, or even stay safe on the water, without a coach. Even if it's just a varsity rower from the local college who volunteers... you need someone who can teach your guys what they're doing. Unfortunately, Louisiana isn't a big rowing area, so it might be hard to find someone, but I'd start by reaching out to the college team with whom you have a relationship and also advertising on Row2k, maybe you will get lucky and find someone in your city with rowing experience!   3) it's hard to advise you further on workouts without knowing exactly what equipment is available in terms of boats, how much water you have to work with and how many athletes y'all have. As a very general plan, you may want to start with a lot of long rows/ergs/runs and technique work days, so that your team can build its base fitness, and learn to row well together. as you get more experience, try adding in some harder interval work on the water and on the erg. A good goal for your crew might be to compete at a spring regatta if y'all can afford it (the closest races to y'all are likely in Texas, Alabama or Tennessee).   4) juniors typically get most of their funds from either their school (if it's a school sport), their parents, or both. Depending on how affluent your teammates' families are you might be able to fundraise enough to start your program just from parent/family contributions- (i.e. putting together a small salary for a coach, buying a couple used boats). Also, try reaching out to local businesses such as restaurants, doctors' offices, etc. that may be interested in sponsoring youth sports. Try running a fundraiser, too- some common ones are rent-a-rower (where you farm out your teammates to do manual labor such as yardwork in exchange for donations to the team) or an erg-a-thon, where your team ergs for X amount of hours or meters in exchange for donations.   Good luck! and if you have any other questions let me know, I hope your team is successful in its goals."
Rowing,3cm0dh,oneseat,4,Thu Jul 9 02:10:40 2015 UTC,I think the first thing you need to do is find someone who is willing to help you in a coaching capacity.

Feel free to send me a pm with any specific questions and I can help you out as much as possible!
Rowing,3cm0dh,pinkgazelle,3,Thu Jul 9 02:07:04 2015 UTC,"I really respect your commitment to your team and to taking charge. I think it will be hard to maintain a program without some kind of adult involvement to maintain continuity and free you and the other rowers to focus on school and rowing.  Otherwise, you'll face repeated transitions when your captain graduates, leaving the underclassmen ""without a clue.""  Are there parents who'd be willing to help?  Another option would be to see if there is a masters club nearby that doesn't have a juniors program but would like to give back to the sport by supporting your club.  You don't have to surrender all leadership to the adults if you go this way, but shared responsibility can help you build the club beyond what you could do on your own."

Rowing,3cm0dh,readyallrow,3,Wed Jul 8 23:44:33 2015 UTC,"You definitely need to get a coach, if nothing else for the safety aspect of it. It seems crazy that your high school would allow you to have a team without one to begin with. I would ask the college coach if he knows anyone since there might be some alumni from the team that are still in the area that could help you out."
Rowing,3cm0dh,dehydratedsquash,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:40:38 2015 UTC,"I would agree with the others on here who suggest that you prioritize finding a coach. Someone who will have some vision for the team and will look to build it over time, because the 4 year turnover of athletes makes establishing a consistent program very difficult if they are the only ones in charge.   Also, it has been my experience that the more instruction and guidance given to new rowers, the more likely they are to stick with the sport. Therefore, I recommend securing all of the coaching help you can find. If you have 30 people on the team, one coach will be hard pressed to teach everyone adequately and this could result in higher turnover rates and energy wasted on novices who won't return.   Keep good records, so that when the team makes progress, it becomes measurable and doesn't get forgotten and lost later on.  If you have limited resources, foster commitment and the ethic of everyone working to make the team work. The more people involved and invested in the team, the more you can accomplish.  As to workouts, I recommend investing in ergs as soon as you can. If you can train on an erg, you can build the fitness base and strength (including supporting muscles) that prepare you for a boat. You can also establish standards and goals for competing down the line. Without ergs, you can still get fit by running and making do with core, push ups, pull ups, body circuits, etc. However, I came from a small program with limited equipment and when we bought 8 ergs it allowed us to start serious preparation for racing.   Good luck!   P.S. If you would like to talk more about rowing in college and the breadth of programs that exist for rowers of all levels, PM me with your questions and I'd be happy to share more!"

Rowing,3clyxf,sixandthree,7,Wed Jul 8 23:07:01 2015 UTC,Biggest takeaway is that he should move his foot stretcher toward the bow - he's finishing into his body and rowing a short finish.
Rowing,3clyxf,acunc,4,Wed Jul 8 23:43:39 2015 UTC,"Are his feet out of his shoes? It looks like his lay back is very tentative.   Definitely agree with /u/acunc, push the foot stretchers towards the bow a couple notches.   Additionally, get a boat one weight-class heavier? It looks a little low in the water. (Is that a 90s Hudson?)  Aside from that, I would have this guy do some 1/4 feather drills to keep his blades mostly square. It will help with his stability during the recovery and to keep his handle heights a bit more consistent."

Rowing,3clyxf,irrelevantPseudonym,2,Thu Jul 9 02:36:23 2015 UTC,I think there could be more separation off the finish. At the moment it looks like the legs and back go at the same time and before the arms are straight. Would help a lot with catch work.
Rowing,3clyxf,dccardsfan,2,Thu Jul 9 06:44:58 2015 UTC,"It looks to me like he has good posture and body angle.  I thought he was rowing it in at the catch early in the video.  Less so later on, which is good, but there still might be some room for improvement and getting the blades buried before the drive is really important to a good stroke. I've found the catch slap drill helpful with that.   Catch slap  Description: In a normal stroke after arriving at the catch position lift hands up to put blades in but keep the blades feathered so that they “slap” the water then square and put them in the water.  Purpose: To assist in learning to raise the hands to drop blades into water; to assist timing of the catch in a crew boat; to stop the legs coming on before the catch, i.e. to separate the catch from the leg drive."

Rowing,3cmbay,acmccoy,4,Thu Jul 9 00:45:36 2015 UTC,"A few notes for the catch:   Don't be afraid of the water pushing back. A lot of rowers tend to shy away from a direct entry thinking the water will feather their blade unintentionally, splash too much, etc. Just be quick and direct, without chopping at it too much. A simple ""unweighting"" of your hands is all it takes. A little backsplash is even encouraged. See if you can maintain a sense of still rolling up the recovery as you enter the water, instead of entering once your forward momentum has stopped. A lot of coaches will say ""the catch is the last part of the recovery"", which is a good way to think about it. You shouldn't be driving your legs until the blade is already buried well in the water. There is a distinct difference in the feeling of rowing it in versus driving a locked-on blade. The difference in boat speed will be noticeable as well. Don't be afraid about ""over extending"" with the oar handle. If you were to drop the blade in at the front end and let go completely, the boat would carry the blade through the water and bring the handle back to you anyway. With this in mind, get a feeling of ""outward momentum"" on the handle while maintaining vertical control as you approach the water. This will allow you to enter at the longest point of the stroke, which maximizes length.  Lastly, (This may be a bit of personal experience talking), if you want to get a bit more feel for your entry, try widening up your grip on the oar handle. This will give you a bit more ""fine"" control over the motions of the blade. You may feel like you're losing some leverage, but if you're only rowing at around SS pace, this will be negligible for the time being. The gain in boat speed from a tidy catch will certainly offset the minor increase in leverage from a narrower grip.    This info will hopefully put some ideas in your head about how to approach the front end, but without seeing some video, I can't comment on how your posture, rigging, or other influences are affecting your ability to cleanly enter the water. Let me know if you found any of this helpful!"

PLEASE if you do squats, get someone to teach you how to do them correctly. Correct form and range of motion are far more important than the weight you throw on the bar. I'd also incorporate pullups, upright and bent over rows, back extensions, bench pulls, bench press, and shoulder press. as much pulling as you do with your upper body, you're going to want to balance that out with pushing movements in the gym. You can keep the things simple by doing 3 sets of 10 reps, or 5 x 5...the internet is full of good info on rep schemes.

The goal is to do your best, work your hardest, and row your butt off, so as long as you can prove and show that to the coaches they will want you on the team.  In my opinion and from what past rowers have done for 2k's in order to get into college rowing programs, I would recommend trying to get a sub 6:30 time, as 6:30 is generally closer to the slowest coaches will want their rowers to be.

I know that the ""strength standards"" which circulate around the rowersphere have very low BW multipliers for squats & deadlifts, but I've always taken those to be minimums..."

Rowing,3chshp,husky_notbigboned,3,Wed Jul 8 04:45:53 2015 UTC,"Not in the least bit.  A 2k is aerobic.  Look at some of the top lightweights, or any junior lightweight in the A-final at youth nationals.  Most of them couldn't do a 270lb deadlift, but they're faster than 6:40."
Rowing,3chshp,rbkillea,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:15:05 2015 UTC,"Interesting, however we'll have to agree to disagree unless you can substantiate your claims about said A-finalists, which would be hard given that I know one who contradicts them. FWIW, 270lb at 150 BW is just above novice male as far as strength standards go, and my personal experience having been a youth lightweight (when the weight was 160) is that most everyone was hitting >1.8x BW max if they knew how to do the movement (a big if).  Also a 2k being aerobic doesn't mean that it won't benefit from muscle. If you have the muscle to pull a 6:40 you have the muscle to DL 270. ""Slow twitch"" dominance won't change that.  EDIT: Sorry for being a dick, I just found your answer slightly abrasive."
Rowing,3chshp,husky_notbigboned,3,Wed Jul 8 04:44:41 2015 UTC,"And speaking from five years of coaching junior rowers, I can safely say that plenty of guys that are 6:40 or faster either never lift, or don't even get close to lifting 1.8xBW.  You need to learn how to deadlift before you lift something as heavy as 270lbs.  No amount of rowing speed teaches you the form to lift heavy weights.  Could they do it with a resistance training plan implemented? Absolutely.  But a strong deadlift is not requisite for a fast erg score."
Rowing,3chshp,notjohndoetoo,2,Wed Jul 8 23:58:02 2015 UTC,But a strong deadlift is not requisite for a fast erg score   Beautifully said.
Rowing,3chshp,rbkillea,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:46:53 2015 UTC,"I guess when I say someone ""has a deadlift"" of a given weight I assume they are going to at least learn how to perform the lift without injuring themselves or performing a movement fundamentally different from the DL. I wouldn't say they need a plan to do that, but yeah they've probably got to learn how to do it before ripping it off the floor if they're trying to find a max. Maybe I should have written ""is capable of producing in their current physical state"" instead of ""has""."
Rowing,3chshp,WolfThawra,-4,Thu Jul 9 03:01:37 2015 UTC,"Well no, you're wrong.  My 2k is well below 6:30 and I can't deadlift 1.8xbw. Even taking into account I could lose up to 10kg (I'd be quite ripped then though).  My rowing buddy's 2k is above 6:40 and he can easily deadlift 2x his body weight. We're the same height, I've got a slightly broader build."

As we have said a thousand times on this sub, weight-lifting will not improve your times, but provide a good base and help prevent injuries. Compound lift are for the whole body, like the rowing motion. So just to throw my two cents in there."
Rowing,3chshp,morkus_from_orkus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:38:24 2015 UTC,"Weight lifting will absolutely improve your speed if done correctly. Unlike other endurance sports, rowing has a very low turnover rate (number of repetitions per minute is low compared with running, swimming, biking) so greater strength is required to maintain speed. Strength training is a great way to increase your potential speed over 2km (where you will struggle if the wattage you are attempting to hold is more than 55% of your peak power) -- though of course aerobic conditioning will determine ultimately if you are able to meet that potential."
Rowing,3chshp,caulfim,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:33:34 2015 UTC,Deadlifts put a lot of stress on your back; if your form breaks down you can easily hurt yourself. Remember stronglifts is for working toward a one-rep max and not to help you row better. I went from 185 to 375 in a little over six months doing one deadlift workout a week with a 1x5 set. That's it.
Rowing,3chp5w,grasshopper_legs,7,Wed Jul 8 00:10:24 2015 UTC,"I've had my share of issues, and have seen a bunch more. In my personal experience, rowing done properly, does not cause problems, but can exacerbate pre-existing issues, or point out weaknesses in your physiology. For example, in my first year of collegiate rowing, my hip flexors were so tight that they caused pain in my lower back, while rowing. a few weeks off of rowing and daily rehab got me back healthy and I've never had the same pain since. There are a lot of injuries like this, that rowing with tight hips or hamstrings, or a weak core, leads to problems.   The one injury that I do think is actually caused by rowing is spinal stress fractures. I've seen a lot of guys with this and theres nothing to be done, but take time off."

Rowing,3chp5w,yalik3that,2,Wed Jul 8 01:13:01 2015 UTC,"Everything's connected man. My back injury started because I had a cut on my foot. I limped which caused strain on my back. Next I shoveled some dirt and further strained it. In retrospect I should've taken time off and not rowed until I was healed. I continued to row hard despite the strain. The first 2k of a 10k pulled the muscle, the next 8k did irreversible damage. PT has helped end the constant pain but my back will never be the same. Lesson I pass along to anyone who rows is taking a week off can save you a lifetime of pain."
Rowing,3chp5w,Coonark00,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:18:00 2015 UTC,"I have a similar problem that just happened 2 weeks ago but it was caused by tight hamstrings pulling on my lower back and durning  a ""boot camp"" we were doing sprints and I just felt my back rip I should have gone to the doctor earlier because my back has bothered me for about half a year now but I can't bring myself to quit. I have been to the doctor and my PT says I should be able to row but there is only a 50/50 chance of full recovery and if I continue to row throughout high school(I'm an uprising 10th grader) it may cause my junior arthritis to worsen and I should expect discomfort when rowing. Are you still continuing rowing or because this was ""irreversible"" did you quit? I want to continue but my be forced to quit by the constant sharp pain in my lower back."

Felt it start to ache but thought I'd just power through, and then after one of the strokes I just felt it go. Utter pain, had to be rowed back and I could barely walk for the next few days.  Took a couple of weeks to go completely and luckily no long term problems.  I think most back problems in rowing come from either poor technique, poor core strength, or an injury caused by land training (ie during weightlifting). I'd say flexibility and core strength are key to injury prevention."
Rowing,3chp5w,Innos245,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:25:33 2015 UTC,"I've been fortunate enough to not suffer any injuries at all from rowing (knock on wood), but backs are the most easy to hurt.  I suffered a nasty back injury in high school and once that happens, you realize how much every movement is connected to your back. Rowing is the same.  Any type of bad technique can put unnecessary strain on it. Over-reaching, stiffening your shoulders, opening your back too early on the drive, etc., everything.  Just be mindful of how your body feels. A correct rowing stroke should put most of the stress on your strongest muscles. If something new begins to get sore or feel really strained, something is probably wrong.  Force good habits and stretch your back out a LOT!"
Rowing,3chp5w,enohcs,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:05:00 2015 UTC,"I've had back and rib issues, probably exacerbated by rowing. Generally I have poor posture, which translated into poor rowing form early on. Two things significantly helped my comeback years after ""retiring""...1) I got really strong in my core, 2) I met with a physiatrist (It's like a chiropractor but with an MD, and they often focus on sports specific issues). They physiatrist put me back together. I went to him with my back/rib issue (costochondritis) and he traced the issue to a hip issue that was the result of a knee issue, that was the result of an ankle issue. Not only did my back costochondritis get better, but I got all kinds of mobility back in areas I didn't know I was missing it.  TLDR, get super strong in the core, and get evaluated by a physiatrist. Insurance should cover it."

This article details some of the friction between the two sides, mainly the 2- and Mike. Rowing Canada seems to be doing alright without him though - the M4- and 4x placed 3rd at the last world cup and guys like Conlin McCabe are pulling sub 5:40."
Rowing,3cgbbt,nurfhearder,5,Tue Jul 7 20:02:05 2015 UTC,"This should be higher up.  It was a pretty large controversy within Canadian rowing.  The article focuses more on Spracklen's side than the opposition, but it should be pointed out that (apparently, as I certainly wasn't involved) Spracklen's rejection of sport science and/or transparency in selection (depending on who you ask) was a large factor that drove a break into the training centre."
Rowing,3cgbbt,dunkster91,7,Tue Jul 7 20:34:50 2015 UTC,"There's a delightful story where a coach I know was training a U19 W4x for Canadian Henley, and after the 4x's first early morning practice on Elk lake, Spracklen charges up to the coach and girls' crew and demands to know how much the opposition is paying her to ""fuck with my practice.""  There are also some criticisms that were expressed by Darren Barber (after Spracklen left) about Mike's safety record. He intentionally coached some practices in conditions that were patently unsafe (can't find my source, right now, but it's out there.)  My understanding is that you were either in his boat(s), or you were the enemy. This made for some fast crews, but a lot of detritus along the way, as guys burnt out, or fell off the wagon. If they weren't ""with"" Mike, they turned into the enemy, too. Rowing Canada Aviron could look past that when he was winning, but their attempts to modernize Canadian training (in line with GB, Australia, the Kiwis, and Germans) was at odds with Spracklen's old-school approach.   My guess: between the disappointment of the LW2x in London, the scandal of Tracy Cameron's departure, the silver finish in the M8+ at London, plus all the athletes who hated him—it was the easiest time to fire him and make a fresh start."

Rowing,3cgbbt,pagregs99,3,Wed Jul 8 04:40:01 2015 UTC,"Nicely sums things up.  I personally think Mike was let go because Rowing Canada management had several concerns. They wanted to become competitive across boat classes, not just in the eight, and Mike's track record only supports success in the eight (save the four in 2004). They also realized that Mike had a shelf life (he's in his mid to late 70's) which meant that he would be done after 2016 (who knows at this point, he's got a point to prove after leaving Canada). They also realized that Mike hadn't set up a system which other coaches could come in and take over. He's got a particular way of motivating and coaching rowers, and it's not as though you can simply look at his training log and understand what makes his crews quick.  There was also all the controversy with other athletes, and there was also an effort to modernize training at the junior and U23 levels, which didn't mesh with Mike's methods."

In fact, most years the 4- is the priority boat for the top countries, (Australia, Canada, USA, GB, Netherlands, Italy, Greece). And for a few others, the pair is the priority event. In fact, less counties at the world level prioritize the eight BECAUSE it is less competitive.   If all they wanted to do was win more medals they'd prioritize the 8, it is far far harder to win a medal in one of the small boat categories.   Case in point: GB's 8+ last year was their second priority boat, yet they still won gold over countries like Germany and Russia that prioritize it.   So if they could win gold with the 8+ as their second boat, yet can't win gold in the pair even if they tried, then it goes to show that the eight is much easier to medal in than most events"

This should only be enough to get the blades out of the water to a level where you are able to square at any part of the recovery.  A good drill is rowing on the square."
Rowing,3ch0eb,sixandthree,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:05:09 2015 UTC,Keeping light but steady outward pressure against the oarlock will help with getting the blades off the water.

Rowing,3ch0eb,pagregs99,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:59:45 2015 UTC,"Well depending on the type of boat, you shouldn't have the oars pressed into the gunwale of the boat. If you did, the blades would just be way too far up into the air. I think a good rule of thumb is to just have the oar shafts parallel to the surface of the water (if the water is flat, of course) when you're on the recovery.   But if the water is super choppy, for heavens sake, it's okay to drag the blades across the water! People are saying it's not a good habit to get into and that you just shouldn't do it at all, but if you need to to keep your balance, go for it. Treat them like training wheels on a bicycle. Do it when you need to, but when the water is flat, practice balancing the boat by not letting the oars drag on the water. Dragging the blades will affect the speed of the boat, for sure, but if it's already super choppy out, you won't notice too much of a difference."

Rowing,3chtrr,acunc,2,Wed Jul 8 03:46:01 2015 UTC,"As much as people like to shit on crossfit, it is an effective form of training. The problems crossfit runs into is related to its culture of not training smart and safe. Crossfit is literally just doing multiple exercises with the goal of training specific muscle groups or ranges of motion.   I do crossfit, but only 30-60min at a time and on exercises I can do without risk of injury. It is a good mental and physical break from rowing, and it can remind you how strong or fit you are compared to other athletes.   I think it would be good to incorporate a 30-60min workout once a week that is safe and doesn't involve heavy weights. Ask a crossfit coach to make a workout, or join a beginners-intermediate class. Make sure your gym and coach have results to back up their training. If they don't, go somewhere that does."

Work on getting a little backsplash so you know your blade is going in at the very end of the recovery, not after you've already started driving. I wouldn't say you're releasing too early at the finish, you're just not drawing up. You're more dumping into the lap. Pull up at the finish and through with your arms, not down"

Rowing,3cf0lb,jspross93,2,Tue Jul 7 23:51:31 2015 UTC,How much skimming the water on the recovery is acceptable in the single? In rough waters I do it more obviously for stability and sometimes when I look behind me but should I work on not having my blades touch the water at all? I just started a few weeks ago and was not specifically taught to not skim the water.
Rowing,3cf0lb,acunc,2,Tue Jul 7 22:00:25 2015 UTC,"I think that, when starting out, you shouldn't worry about your blades being on the water. It's one less factor to worry about as you get comfortable with sculling and with being in the single.  Once you get more comfortable, though, you definitely want to try to get the blades off the water. It's not so much that the blade touching the water slows you down (it does to an extent), but more the fact that you're going to have to lower the handles to get clearance to feather the blade before the catch. Usually what ends up happening is one of two things - (1) you flip-catch or (2) you sky the blade and don't initiate the drive on time (i.e. you miss water).   It's best to come into the catch with blades off the water, handles steady, feather, and place the oars at the top of the slide."
Rowing,3cf0lb,Bermuda_rower,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:06:56 2015 UTC,"Scullers vary between driving with slightly bent arms and those who hang with straight arms and 'horseshoe' shoulders, then pulling shoulders back for a fast release.  Is this just personal preference?  Bent arms looks (more) painful but seems to work very well for some."
Rowing,3cf0lb,acunc,3,Tue Jul 7 14:00:20 2015 UTC,"I think bio-mechanically it's most efficient to have straight  (but not locked out) arms, but may not be the most comfortable. Any bend at the elbow is sacrificing length (however small) and also sacrificing your ability to ""hang"". Again, the differences at the top level are very small - it's mostly about what works for the rower."
Rowing,3cf0lb,enohcs,4,Tue Jul 7 15:28:13 2015 UTC,"The bend acts like a shock absorber that reduces the efficiency of your drive, especially if the arms are bent at the catch. You're also likely to fatigue sooner. Think of dead hanging from a pull up bar. Are you going to last longer with straight arms or bent arms? You can also look at olympic lifters as a great example since a lot of what they do mimics the rowing drive. Their arms only bend at the conclusion of their leg drive."
Rowing,3cf0lb,pagregs99,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:35:09 2015 UTC,"Unless your legs can compensate, having the arms even slightly broken can set the run of the shell off while sculling."

Rowing,3cf0lb,mbtags,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:32:13 2015 UTC,"This morning at practice, my coach was telling me to get more body angle on the recovery. I've been rowing for 6 years and haven't been able to find a way to get a good stretch in my hamstrings on the way up the slide. Once the rate comes up, I feel like I don't have enough time to get a good angle."
Rowing,3cf0lb,supercompu2,3,Tue Jul 7 16:21:08 2015 UTC,"Adjust your seating position so that the seat is more towards your thighs than your back (if you get what I mean). Basically, if looking at your body from the side, rotate yourself forward towards the foot stretcher a bit.   From what you're describing, it sounds like you have a bit more of a reclined posture, which makes laying back super easy but getting to the front a bit harder. This puts pressure on your hamstrings when attempting to get more body angle at the front, as you kind of need to bend in half to do it.   Try this; next time you sit in a boat, reach out towards your toes with your knees completely down. Adjust the way you're sitting until it is as comfortable as possible. Once you're there, take note of how your sitting and see if that new position enables you to better get forward body angle. Row like this for a while, and if it feels better, you've identified your problem. If you still have difficulty even after doing this, you may need to lower the foot position on your foot stretcher a bit (though I would consult with your coach first before making a rigging change!).   Common side effects include less lay back initially, and an uneasy feeling in the core/lower back. This is normal, as you've likely not needed to engage them as much previously. A little repetition and practice is all you need to sort those feelings out."

Rowing,3cf0lb,lightsweeps,13,Tue Jul 7 12:40:00 2015 UTC,"It's in the leverage. You get a bit more leverage keeping a narrow grip at the end of the oar instead of wide gripping it. The trade off is the oar feels harder to control and rotating becomes more of a task.  I prefer the narrow grip style. I feel that it keeps the stroke nice and light and allows me to have more control on the rate. It had a learning curve to it when coming from wide grip and it reappears when you switch sides after being one sided for a while.   If you feel like your upper body is burning out faster than you want it to during a race, try narrowing up on the grip. If you feel like you're digging or not getting the reach out of the shell you want, widen up."

Rowing,3cf0lb,Vigorous_Vertigo,2,Tue Jul 7 14:22:00 2015 UTC,I am a bit confused by what you are asking. There are 2 ways to go faster - apply more force and/or increase the range of motion (longer strokes). The goal when you are sprinting should always be to increase force (push harder) over the full range of motion (row full length) and take as many long and forceful strokes as you can (increase rate).
Rowing,3cf0lb,acunc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:51:16 2015 UTC,"There is a third way:  reduce the recovery time to increase stroke rate.  In the last few strokes of a race when the rower is putting everything they got left into the drive, they will naturally lengthen a little to get that extra force.  Since the end of a sprint is also at a typically higher stroke rate, the recovery time has to be reduced:  it is the only variable left."
Rowing,3cfty0,germanysch,5,Tue Jul 7 16:10:55 2015 UTC,Your body needs a break.  You should be careful when drastically raising your volume - it can easily lead to injury/overtraining.

Rowing,3cb36w,Coachingthrowaway,7,Mon Jul 6 14:57:48 2015 UTC,"My HS coach made us row by 6s with square blades for weeks and weeks at the beginning of each season before we were allowed to row by 8s. Once we were allowed to row by 8s, we still kept square blades for a few more weeks. I recall a few head races done with square blades. By the end of the season we had a crazy solid set, we had incredible synchronization in our swing...We ended up being NY state champs in the open 8 my senior year."
Rowing,3cb36w,enohcs,2,Mon Jul 6 20:08:40 2015 UTC,"Also...don't forget to yell and scream...a lot. I'd say invest in a few plastic cone style loud hailers so you can throw them around your launch in a fantastic rage. Bonus points for shattering one. Maybe single out one guy every once in a while, tell him the boat would be better as a 7 than with his dead weight...pull him and his oar from the boat and make him sit in awkward silence in your launch."

Rowing,3cb36w,captiancurtains,6,Tue Jul 7 17:31:39 2015 UTC,"Technically, keep it simple. Take one or two points and focus on it for nearly the entire year. Mentally, make them competetive as fuck by racing them against eachother every other training from the start. Make sure you don't overtrain them either, more outings does not mean your boat will row faster.  source: I have coached a freshman's eight this year, they became second in the national competition. Other boats from our club with a similar strategy also performed top 5."
Rowing,3cb36w,milkpizza,6,Mon Jul 6 15:49:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other poster about keeping it simple and focusing on the one or two things for a really long time, and just teach them to race. They won't become master technicians in one season, no matter how good you or they are, what you can do is teach them to race, this will be the best thing you can do for them before you hand them over to the varsity coach in a year.   I would also add that, though you'd hope that college age novices are more coordinated and athletic than their high school counterparts, they may not be and building body awareness off the water can be extremely helpful. Coaching land training with the same level of attention to detail that you apply to the stroke on the water can help them to think about how they move their body, which makes making technical changes on the water easier. So for example, coach their jumpies, pushups, core work, to make sure they can think about making adjustments to their body position through another athletic motion. Coach their stretching so that they feel exactly what happens when they change position. These sorts of things, in my experience, can help develop athletes with body awareness which aids tremendously in making technical changes on the water."
Rowing,3cb36w,624mark,3,Mon Jul 6 16:44:57 2015 UTC,"This was my exact situation last summer with youth rowers. I think the same mindset applies for the most part.  There's not particularly a lot of time to make huge leaps in fitness, especially when you have to focus on teaching them to row from scratch.  Since they're in college, you can be much more straight forward and clear about what you want (no need to sugar coat or dumb down some things as you might with young kids).  I like the idea of keeping it VERY simple. Teach the stroke as plainly as possible. Let them just do it, then make little adjustments. Allowing things to come naturally to them by making sure they know how it should look and how it should feel is huge.  In the early goings, I did a lot of photo and video review of individuals and their strokes. Not picking them apart frame by frame, just a general overview. I tink novices seeing themselves row is very helpful.  There's nothing more rewarding than seeing your own novices go from taking their first ever strokes then hitting the water for a real race. Be patient, be smart, and make them fast!"
Rowing,3cb36w,zknarc,3,Mon Jul 6 18:08:45 2015 UTC,Less about technique but a good read about novices (and sparked from a discussion here): https://readyallrow.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/teachable-moments/

Rowing,3cb36w,FlightyTwilighty,2,Fri Jul 17 23:41:23 2015 UTC,"Spend some time on the erg with beginner rowers, and don't just walk around the erg, but row with them, and make them copy your body positions by putting the erg in front of them or next to them. This will help them sort out the whole ""slow up the slide"" because they'll have a good model to observe when working on the ratio of the stroke. Especially for the first or second class, erg is great because they don't have to worry about all that ""boat stuff"" and can just focus on the basics of the body."
Rowing,3cb36w,AlexG55,-2,Tue Jul 7 01:05:58 2015 UTC,"Please, as a favour to everyone your rowers will share a lake or river with in what will hopefully be long, enjoyable and successful rowing careers- teach them to stop the boat properly from the start.  By this, I mean ""over-feathering"" or reverse-squaring so the blade digs into the water, rather than putting it flat on the water and trying to square it.  I see way too many novice coaches teaching crews to stop the boat the wrong way, so it becomes instinct and they have to unlearn it later."
Rowing,3camw3,iLove2ks,2,Mon Jul 6 12:26:07 2015 UTC,"In the face of this, I'd be curious to see what's the communities' take on the Concept Skinnys?"
Rowing,3camw3,mmiyagi13,3,Wed Jul 8 13:15:47 2015 UTC,"Based on personal experience, stiffer shafts require a greater initial leg push to get the oar moving at the same speed as the boat. Softer oars are lighter at the catch but require a stronger mid-drive to get the same acceleration as stiff blades. As such, lighter crews or smaller boats tend to favor softer blades and the heavyweights tend to favor stiff blades. The empirical data is important but I think the rowers' feel of the oar is far more important."

Rowing,3cayct,hammock94,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:39:13 2015 UTC,Hehe. Sacrificing this year would result in a nice win next year hopefully then.
Rowing,3cayct,Harryofsol,7,Mon Jul 6 14:47:35 2015 UTC,This does in fact motivate people. On our team we had a rough year but all of us are coming back this year and are extremely salty about last season. Some people I thought would never train over the summer are actually turning into fitness nuts.
Rowing,3cayct,captiancurtains,7,Mon Jul 6 16:26:24 2015 UTC,"Not everyone does this sport to win races. Some just need somewhere to hang out and have fun. If they aren't into it, don't make them do anything. If you want them to start doing more, lead by example. Either they'll do nothing, or they'll join you. Either way, it's their desicion."
Rowing,3cayct,Reddit_WhoKnew,6,Mon Jul 6 17:58:11 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, you can't make people do anything they don't want to do. If they are just there to get out on the water and have a good time, they probably won't amount to much in the long run when it comes to producing fast boats.  It boils down to 2 types of motivated people in my mind. Those who are internally motivated and want to do well for themselves, and as an extension, for others. And those who are externally motivated, who want to do well almost because of peer pressure, so that others do well, which results in them doing well.  The best way we got some of the fringe people to work harder was to bring them into the fold, both in workouts and socially. If the top erg scores were all erging in the first row of ergs at practice, we tried to get that guy who could get there if he tried a little harder in the row with us, or right behind us. Either way, he'd see the top erg scores and eventually would start to try a little harder to compete with us. And in between pieces or water breaks we'd include them in the conversation about our times or how we approach things. We'd also invite them to our extra workouts  saying that ""All the top guys erg together Wednesday evening, we'd like you to join in and get faster with us."" Giving them more knowledge and opportunity helps bring some people out of their shells. Sometimes people don't try as hard because they're scared or embarrassed that they don't quite know what's going on and would feel stupid to say something.  The same went for on the water. If we had the top guys in an 8, we'd talk back and forth during breaks and try to get the other guys going. Not by making fun of them, but simply by encouraging them. If they were the 2V, we'd tell them that other 2V crews would be withing 5-6 seconds of us over 2k (scaled down for shorter pieces obviously) and that if they could get within that same difference, they could be really competitive too.  Mostly we got those fringe people to try harder by including them. It was annoying and tiring sometimes, but if the person was really worth it, we'd put in the extra effort to include them and show them what dedicated people could do. At regattas, our top 8 always hung out together and had a good time, not only because we liked each other but because we were competitive too. As captian said, lead by example and those who are willing will follow along. I think it's also important to say that if someone just won't put in the effort no matter what you do, don't waste your energy. Don't push them away, but you need to put energy into your results and spending more time trying to drag the bottom guys up won't benefit you."
Rowing,3cayct,revolucionario,3,Mon Jul 6 19:30:30 2015 UTC,"Make them competitive with each other – on the erg, and if you can, on the water.   If we're talking about an eight, take them out in fours, race them against each other. If they swing that way, maybe even singles or doubles. If you don't have smaller boats, or you want to go out in an eight, you can still do drills where pairs or fours take turns in picking up speed.   My girlfriend and cox says: if you have a group of men and you want them to do something, call them Team A and Team B. Better, make two teams compete for being Team A."

Rowing,3cayct,supercompu2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:38:33 2015 UTC,"Passion breeds from inspiration. You can be that inspiration, or you can foster the growth of the inspiration amongst the club as a whole.   One thing that really perked up our team were individuals who went the extra mile who made people want to be in their boat. Knowing those guys were going to make their boat fast made the prospect of rowing with them much more appealing, so aspiring to their level was desirable. This made a bunch of guys step up and work hard, so that they could fill the seats around those really hard working few, making for a decently fast boat overall.   We've had these individuals row for real good clubs and USA at U23s, so being able to come back with those kinds of stories and experiences opened some eyes to what can happen with hard work. I know my work ethic personally improved knowing my team mates were national teamers, and I should be stepping up to not slow them down!"

Rowing,3caepc,Corbab,4,Mon Jul 6 11:40:53 2015 UTC,"Plenty of people (myself included) have rowed marathons on the erg, which entail about three hours of rowing.

I've regularly done two hour sessions either straight through or as 3x40 or 2x60 minutes and it hasn't bothered me a bit.

Rowing,3c74qi,Rower6969,6,Mon Jul 6 02:44:15 2015 UTC,I thinks its important to remember that Yale had nothing to celebrate after IRA's. Washington did a victory lap while Yale was probably working hard. I think some of UW's flaws are starting to creep on them this year. It will be interesting to see how they do in 2016.
Rowing,3c74qi,captiancurtains,11,Mon Jul 6 04:35:43 2015 UTC,That Yale boat was stacked af their smallest guy is 6'5 but they rowed such an amazing race. They looked way more on sync and had better run. It sucked that they choked up in IRAs

Rowing,3c74qi,DRower8,4,Mon Jul 6 18:30:37 2015 UTC,"If you put aside the possibility of UW just having a bad row and Yale just having an especially good one, this is side by side racing and not 6 lanes. So no one to see once you are down. No silver medal. Only the wash of the other boat.  They are on a river with boats going past making waves. So not an empty lake. The stream is against them but is worse for each station at different points. This affects tactics. It also means the races are at least 30 seconds longer than otherwise. Plus it is slightly longer than 2K.  Differences can affect you. It isn't impossible that these played a part."

Craftsbury was an absolutely amazing experience. The coaches there are very passionate and love rowing. When I went as a novice, they taught the basics of sculling very well and campers became comfortable very quickly. There are many group sessions, and one-on-ones, so during my second summer I made just as many improvements.   The water is clean, flat, and oh so fun to flip in (flipping is encouraged!). The food was absolutely incredible. Much of it is locally grown, so it's very fresh and healthy, and its all-you-can-eat. A lot of off-water activities happen, namely the most epic capture-the-flag match imaginable.   There's so much more to it that's not shown on this post or even the website. I'm entering my 6th year of rowing and am certain I could benefit from the camp as much as when I was a novice. If you want more details, pm me!"

If it is set for the arms it is too easy for the legs.  In the US sometimes you can find the old C2 model ""A"" ergs for $250. They would be better then what you have in the link."
Rowing,3c7xwm,petersculls,2,Sun Jul 5 19:29:43 2015 UTC,"The one you linked is nothing like a Concept 2 so if getting a real erg is what you're after, this shouldn't be on your list. If you're just going to use it to workout then you're probably better off going to a gym and using the C2s they have. It is very, very, very, very unlikely that you'll find something similar for $250 or under.

It really doesn't matter to me if what I buy is similar to a Concept 2 or even similar to actual rowing. Literally all I want is a good workout. I get that they may be the best in the business, and one day when I have more money I will probably buy one. For now I am just looking for something that will give me a decent workout for a decent price.  The reason we are looking into rowing machines specifically is because my husband has a foot that he broke a while back, and it gets very sore if he runs too much. So we have been interested in getting a row machine instead of a treadmill/elliptical so he can use it. It also just looks like generally they give you a good, well rounded exercise."

Of the reasonable options, rowing is probably the best because it is done seated.  As I mentioned in my other comment, I would try and find the best piece of used equipment you can find in your budget range.

Rowing,3c7d8j,BenW1994,2,Sun Jul 5 16:06:07 2015 UTC,I agree. Only thought is that they were far over for the majority of the race. They did move when asked though.
Rowing,3c7d8j,petersculls,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:16:05 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand what they did wrong.   I would think if you row in someone else's water and put puddles where a crew that is behind is placing their blade that could be considered interference. If it is interference the question does it get called. Here is what I read ""Competitors are notified that Rule 41 which governs the conduct of racing at Henley differs both from the British Rowing Laws of Boat Racing and the F.I.S.A. Rules of Racing. In particular:–– (a) Interference is not defined, but is left to the Umpire’s decision. (b) There is no obligation upon the Umpire to warn a crew that it is out of its proper course before disqualifying it for interference"""
Rowing,3c7d8j,BenW1994,5,Sun Jul 5 19:18:29 2015 UTC,"The way that the commentators were talking about it, it sounded to me like that was part the spirit of Henley. Secondly, there were many other instances where other boats did the exact same, or worse, for no punishment, or not even a warning.  I saw crews not give the boat behind them wash, and commentators say they should have. I've seen crews send wash back and they said it was 'a sign of respect', that they were worried about being caught up. And I've seen crews start diagonal and almost hit the other crew if they hadn't moved over, with consequent warning.  I get that the rules essentially say 'umpire does what he wants' but there's no fair way to DQ St Pauls but not even penalise Cal (against Newcastle)."
Rowing,3c7d8j,petersculls,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:44:25 2015 UTC,I am not familiar with Henley racing so I don't know what the limits are and the spirit of the unwritten rules there. Maybe someone that has a history of knowledge of racing there can confirm. I have only watched a few replays so I have no reference.
Rowing,3c7d8j,Timothy_Claypole,5,Sun Jul 5 20:11:10 2015 UTC,The limits are literally what the umpire will allow. That is the rule. And they can warn in the race but DQ afterwards just fine.   This is not a FISA or British Rowing event so their rules don't apply.
Rowing,3c7d8j,maxai,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:15:37 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think its in the spirit of Henley, I have no idea why commentators kept going on about 'giving the other crew dirty water' being a good thing. If the stewards get angry about crews getting beaten by too much (a minor part of why people slow down when they're winning, its considered disrespectful to attempt to hammer the other crew by 10 lengths), then I can see why they also wouldn't like people getting in the other crews lane.  That being said, fair enough to Paul's, it was some great coxing and if you can get away with it why not. Westminster got freaked out and they capitalised!"

Rowing,3c7d8j,readyallrow,3,Sun Jul 5 19:48:12 2015 UTC,"I think the commentators were right when they said that they did just enough to agitate Westminster but not enough to upset the umpire(s). Dick move or risky strategy, who knows, but the coxswain did what they were required to do by responding to Pinsent telling them to move over. It wouldn't make sense for them to respond immediately every time to Pinsent telling them to adjust their point and then disqualify them for their steering after the fact."
Rowing,3c7d8j,Timothy_Claypole,2,Sun Jul 5 16:19:59 2015 UTC,"It was the rough and tumble of racing, not outright impeding.  I wonder what the umpire would have said had the stroke man of St Paul's raised his hand in triumph before they crossed the line....?"

He's a very experience steersman can pretty much hit a dead straight line if he wants to.  Fair enough its part of the Henley racing situation, but if the other crew had protested then any other crew probably would've been DQ'ed. The issue is one squad boat would never protest about another, and it's much less likely the Stewards would uphold a protest against a GBR selected boat."

Rowing,3c58zb,spsrower,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:57:04 2015 UTC,There was a brief bit of commentary from MP at the end of the livestream yesterday after they replayed the Grand - he explained that St Paul's steered a 'better line than Westminster' and that their victory was never really in contention. It was certainly a scary moment when he reached for that red flag though! Must just be a formality of the contest process.

Rowing,3c5d5o,boccaraben,4,Sat Jul 4 23:18:33 2015 UTC,"Ok so across the board it seems like you guys are spending a ton of time at the catch before getting your blade in--something that'll lead to the ""hang and bang"" phenomena which slows the boat down at the catch and will increase check. Try and focus on getting the blade in as you get into the catch to allow for a quicker and more efficient/seamless turnaround"
Rowing,3c5d5o,FatherSonBrolySpirit,5,Sat Jul 4 23:32:06 2015 UTC,"Try a little more set up. You're leaving too much motion to happen right before the catch. You want your arms stretched out and your body over earlier to minimize the movements made right before the catch. This is the most critical thing to work on at low rates, because if you're not doing it at low rates, I guarantee you it's worse at high rates. Watch the video below and notice how little movement of the body there is to put the blade in   https://youtu.be/siclYOIa3Zs?t=46s   Looks like you're taking a bit too much in the shoulders. which will make it harder to get an efficient hang. Contrast that with your 6 seat who has his outside shoulder low and forward once the blade is in the water Looks like you're curving your back a bit too much and hunching down at the finish instead of pulling through a good solid position. The below video is great for this. They're both drawing through and their bodies rotate back, but they don't dump down   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XG4yxuXUVg"

Maybe 70% of my erging is SS (usually around 14K - 16K) but I'm finding the 2000m of cumulative sprint pieces the most helpful. Eventually I'm going to lower the rest periods until I can hold my target split for a 2K. Again, this may not be very helpful but I just thought my game plan was similar and you'd appreciate the opinion. Good luck!"

Rowing,3c3ptd,BiggerBlackerPC,2,Sun Jul 5 02:30:48 2015 UTC,"If you feel the oar less, the oar feels you less. You'll lose power and increase crabbing potential. This, instead of calluses that protect you later is not a good trade off."

Basically we got really lucky. Riggers, wooden seat, shoes, and seat tracks were all free.   From start to finish, it took my dad and I about 5 months to build the entire boat in our garage.

Seeing as Gonzaga didn't make the A final at Youth Nats, I'd wager for an average of low to mid-620s at best. I know that Shawnigan (one of the selected crews, were upset by BC High on Thursday) had one kid 6:16ish, another 6:28ish, a few in the 6:30s, and a stroke who went low 6:40s."

Rowing,3c0xfc,outsideflanker,4,Fri Jul 3 19:26:37 2015 UTC,"If a universal race plan existed - you have described it. Just keep it simple and make calls that are meaningful to you and your partner (not just inspiration, tech checks as well). If you are young and/or new to rowing then my best advice is to get speed with composure (stay calm, race your own race, ignore other boats until the last 500 where you can race off them if you are within 2 lengths), length (quick catches, pull all the way through to the finish, stay together on the drive), and power (focus more on strength during the drive than quickness, do not rate high for the sake of it, length and strength will get you much further than high rate in the early days of your rowing career). Otherwise, stay relaxed, have fun, and practice getting into the starting blocks/stake boats if you are going to have them. Practice backing, practice port and starboard, practice steering."

I would think that 1/2 would be better as your first stroke since its only half pressure then go to 3/4 with more power and speed. I always loved the 3/4, 3/4, lengthen, full start. First stroke being half pressure."
Rowing,3c0xfc,drmann,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:16:08 2015 UTC,"It's not pressure it's slide length (half slide, not half pressure) but the reason many crews do 3/4 1/2 3/4 is because speed is about rate as well as power and when the boat isn't moving fast it's often better just to get a quick half slide stroke in to get the boat moving rather than going all the way to 3/4 and muscling it.  The main reason is the time you save on the recovery, which isn't an issue on the first stroke anyway. You're also in a position with more leverage at the catch for a 1/2 slide stroke, contributing to the added power.    Lots of crews don't do any 1/2 slide strokes and it works for them, it's all about what works best for a crew"

I had also signed up for a marathon to prevent me from skipping days and followed the Hal Higdon Novice 1 Plan.

Say a crucial member of the 1st boat goes down, you could take a peek at an aggregate score, and see rower X has 89 points and rower Y has 85, so you go with rower X first to see if they make the boat better/worse.   Obviously its hard to quantify technical ability and how they will get along with the boat, but even if this value was an afterthought, it may prove useful somehow."
Rowing,3br317,jurgenater,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:54:13 2015 UTC,"I like this idea, maybe a 'suggest rower' feature for a boat, this obviously eliminates people based on if theyre too high a level, wrong sweep side, not a sculler/sweeper etc   Once those able to row in the boat are determined maybe the suggestions are done based on height, weight, power to weight ratio etc so they are similar to the rowers already in the boat. And they are scored in terms of %compatibility.  Just spit-balling, I like the aggregate score, but I also like the idea of determining their compatibility with the boat.   Ultimately the numbers can't really determine who will best help the boat, but it could be used for guidance.   Thank you for the suggestion! I will update the original post"
Rowing,3br317,jurgenater,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:00:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The score (which could also take side compatibility into consideration) would only be a suggestion given their potential in the given boat.

Every coach has had that moment when they're thinking of the best person to give a shot, and the obvious answer was hidden in plain sight for a lot longer than they should have been."

Rowing,3bsm7g,FatherSonBrolySpirit,5,Wed Jul 1 20:33:20 2015 UTC,A half split is immaterial. The C6 training band is some 6-10 splits wide.
Rowing,3bsm7g,OARneryRower,3,Wed Jul 1 23:44:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is a specific band, but you need to do lactate testing to figure that out (and even then, the number of watts you're able to pull at a given heart rate would vary from day to day). For your purposes, no - half a split is basically irrelevant anyway.  There is, however, a good reason to try and be really consistent - it prepares for you the way you want to row (and test on the ergo!). It's much more efficient to simply row a flat pace in those situations."
Rowing,3bsm7g,theicemanguy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:39:30 2015 UTC,"I would be more interested in your heart rate while doing steady state. The point of steady state is to build an aerobic base. You do that by getting your heart rate to about 75% of your max (~150-160 bpm in high school and college) and holding that for a sustained period of time. So if your heart rate is in that range for both splits (which if you are in shape it probably will be), then you should be fine either way.    I also used to think about steady state in terms of splits as well. That if I wasn't below 2:00, I wasn't trying hard enough. But I finally realized that I should be focusing on my heart rate instead of trying for the best split possible."
Rowing,3bsm7g,steelcurtain09,2,Wed Jul 1 21:01:36 2015 UTC,Right. I mean I just will sit down for a long session and pull a 2:01 without much thought and I guess my heart rate is low enough/in that range but I'm always super skeptical about HR because there can be so many confounding variables

Rowing,3btsd6,supercompu2,3,Thu Jul 2 19:17:38 2015 UTC,"Lucky for you, most DIII schools don't have a lightweight team, and if they even enter a lightweight event, it's just because they happened to have a bunch of light guys all at once. On a team with no weight division, you'll be judged for your boat-moving abilities.   Depending on where you're interested in going, different coaches at different schools will have different standards."
Rowing,3btsd6,flyingmountain,3,Thu Jul 2 02:33:30 2015 UTC,"Sub 5:40.   Kidding of course. While the top end 'D1' (NCAA) doesn't really regulate men's rowing, schools are looking for rowers sub 6:25. At a DIII or club team, 6:45 would probably be decent for a freshman."
Rowing,3btsd6,DRower8,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:25:34 2015 UTC,I started as a college freshman in boston with a 6:45 as an open weight (many incoming freshman were in the 6:20s) and did just fine. Just work hard and don't slack when it comes to the weight room.
Rowing,3btsd6,enohcs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:15:03 2015 UTC,"You really aren't in a bad position. You have two things going for you...one, you do still have time to grow and get taller. I grew significantly between my sophomore and senior year of HS. Two, you still have tons of time to bring that 2K down. I rowed (heavyweight) at a DI school, and I can guarantee you that you would have a legit shot at it if you brought your 2K down just a bit. I had a lot of friends who had a similar build and times to you coming into college and were able to drop their 2Ks to the lower 6:40s, so maybe make that a goal. Even if you stay the same height, a 6:40ish 2K coupled with good technique will make you a competitive athlete at a lot of schools. Maybe not in the 1v, but maybe so. Besides, winning a race in a lower boat is better than losing a race in a 1v (in my opinion anyway). Sorry for the long rambling response haha I guess my advice would be to shoot for a sub 6:45 2K and focus on rowing well. A combination of strength, finesse, and dedication will allow you to row at a ton of schools and beat out bigger, stronger, and heavier guys."

Rowing,3bqg33,readyallrow,2,Wed Jul 1 09:42:38 2015 UTC,"Rowing for a long time, or coaching for a long time, you're able to get within about 2 spm of a rate visually without much issue.   You learn to base your guess of the time gap between strokes (seems a bit obvious, but bear with me), as the number of strokes in a given period is harder to quantify than how long goes in between strokes. By only going by the time gap, you can guess fairly accurately with only a couple strokes versus having to take 3 or more with a watch or something.   If you've been in a boat for a while, knowing certain ratings by how long it takes on the recovery becomes something of a sixth sense."

Rowing,3bnteg,rowerldn,0,Tue Jun 30 19:51:18 2015 UTC,"You'd effectively only need to find time for two races. Most of the crews in the Remenham are of Ladies Plate-equivalent standard. So you would have an eight-boat ""Gentlemen's Plate"" in the time currently taken up by the Remenham. The Remenham would then be the equivalent of the Grand, and like the Grand would only have 2 or 3 crews in it."
Rowing,3bnteg,AlexG55,3,Tue Jun 30 21:17:05 2015 UTC,"Doesn't the remenham do a great job in its current format? National teams compete for the title, top clubs compete to qualify and experience the pomp and ceremony. HRR is about celebrating excellence, and unless you're going to devalue WHR there should be careful consideration about adding new events just so more women go home with medals (for similar total participation numbers)."
Rowing,3bnteg,mcdom69,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:42:21 2015 UTC,"No. No one gets super excited about winning the open events (except for the rare year where there are no national team entries). It's just another race, a bit like a World Cup. Winning Henley is actually a bigger deal for the intermediate/student/club crews, so giving them their own events is important.  By your logic, why not cut a bunch of the men's events? Maybe combine the student and club events - after all, shouldn't the crews who couldn't win just be ""happy to experience the pomp and ceremony?""  Adding a women's intermediate event isn't enough. There should be women's events to match the international boat classes - there's no 2x, 2-, etc., and ideally you'd even include student, club and/or junior events in the 8+. I know people will cry foul at this (I'm a man, for the record) because that would necessitate cutting and/or downsizing some of the men's events, but this is the 21st century and for all of Henley's (fantastic) eccentricities incredible degrees of gender inequality shouldn't be one of them.  And for those that say we should just build up Women's Henley, that entirely misses the point. It is a great event but it is nowhere close to HRR as a spectacle, and, honestly, it probably never will be."
Rowing,3bnteg,theicemanguy,0,Wed Jul 1 10:38:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I am going to cry foul at cutting men's events at HRR for women's events- it is essentially saying to some of the men's crews ""sorry, you don't get to go to Henley any more so some more women's crews can go twice"".  I don't agree with building up HWR either. As long as it stays when it is and the size it is, it will never be equal to HRR- the time means that some crews won't be able to make it and some events are qualifying events for HRR, and the size means it can't be over the full course.  What I think should happen is to still have two regattas, but split them by something other than gender. Potentially have Henley Small Boats regatta (including 4x and possibly 4-) and Henley Fours and Eights regatta, both over the full course, with equal numbers of men's and women's events at both."
Rowing,3bnteg,AlexG55,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:18:24 2015 UTC,"While your proposed solution is equitable (and much better than what we have now in that respect), it also isn't realistic. Henley Royal Regatta will always have the prestige, the social cachet, the atmosphere, etc. Even if you somehow managed to split the regatta in two (a change the Stewards would never in a million years endorse), I doubt you'd manage to generate the pomp and circumstance for both weekends.  You can't think of competing at HWR & HRR as ""going twice."" They're two completely different events that just happen to be held at the same venue (although in many respects it's not the same venue, given much of what makes Henley special is absent). The former is not comparable to the latter. If men's crews are upset at being excluded, I'm sure they could organize some kind of Henley-lite before or afterwards (or even include men at HWR). But even if they couldn't, that shouldn't stand in the way of gender equality."
Rowing,3bnteg,theicemanguy,3,Wed Jul 1 23:50:31 2015 UTC,I'd prefer to see a club/student M4x event first.

Rowing,3bnteg,SidViciious,5,Tue Jun 30 18:49:45 2015 UTC,"Unless Womens' Henley is given the same status as HRR, I hardly think it's fair to act as though they are equal. I don't mind whether you move closer to parity through increasing womens events at HRR or increasing the size of WHR, but let's not pretend that things are currently equal."
Rowing,3bnteg,BenW1994,2,Tue Jun 30 18:59:37 2015 UTC,"To give some context, I competed in Henley Women's this year.   I would rather a separate regatta that was given more prestige than shoe-horn a single race into HRR."
Rowing,3bnteg,SidViciious,2,Tue Jun 30 19:02:15 2015 UTC,"Do you mean move all women's events to WHR, hopefully raising the status of WHR closer to that of HRR? I could agree with that, although I'm not sure how you could a) ensure elite athletes turn up + b) get others to treat them equally. Definitely a better overall solution though."
Rowing,3bnteg,BenW1994,3,Tue Jun 30 19:40:13 2015 UTC,"I do, yeah.   Women's Henley still has this sense of ""oh shit, I'm rowing at Henley"". It's an amazing event in it's own right. And I think it is a disrespect and a disservice to women's rowing to say we can't have our own regatta and need to tag along with the men. We manage at The Head just fine.   One of the main problems this year (not sure about other years) is that it was the same time as WC2. But also, Women's doesn't have the same prestige purely because it's not as old and not on the social Calender -- which is a really important part of why HRR is so big. You can't force prestige. It will happen eventually.   We can help that along by making women's something worth winning it's own right. The obvious solution to that is money. I would hesistate to use it as a pre-qualify to HRR events because it cheapens it a lot in my head. How can they be equal if one is a way to get into the other???   I don't have an answer as to how to ""fix"" women's sport. Honestly I don't think there is a magical way. Like I said, I think it will happen eventually. We just need to be patient and help it along when we can"

Rowing,3bnuto,enohcs,4,Tue Jun 30 18:44:01 2015 UTC,"Sounds like some folks are rushing the recovery.  If others get to the catch before everyone else, those still on the reocovery will feel a bit of a hiccup on their own return.  Since you're stroke, one luxury is that you are NEVER late to the catch - you set the pace, so if they're early, that is something they need to focus on to fix, and your coach needs to call 'em out on that.  With that said, don't get high and mighty.  If the coach sees that people can't adjust to your rythmn, he may well pull you out and try someone else instead. So, as stroke, focus on not only having a repeatable rythmn, but also one that is one that your crew can follow."

Rowing,3bnuto,macca_chris,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:09:18 2015 UTC,"I've had this before as well. It's absolutely killer in a long head race. My diagnosis was a combination of 2 things: I wasn't in time with the others coming into the catch (too slow off the back), and lacked flexibility (probably hip flexors). The timing reason is because it feels like I've been left behind on the slide, the others are reaching front stops and decelerating, making it harder for me to get up the front of the slide (feels like you're having to pull the boat underneath you). To counter this I get my hands away and rock over quicker, giving me more time moving up the slide. Flexibility issue is easy enough, just stretch them more!"

Rowing,3bjg3m,pagregs99,2,Mon Jun 29 18:48:03 2015 UTC,"You're from Vic City? There are some really solid coaches there. You're already in luck.  That being said, the simple answer is continuous effort >40 minutes.   2k+20 for 10k for you would do well (though if I were you now, I'd get used to doing steady state by minutes), no rest.   2*6k with 30 seconds rest at 2k+20 is good too.   Over work periods of an hour/15k+, do 2k+25 and keep rest under 45 seconds in ratio to 20 minutes of work. I like 5k/4k/3k/2k/1k with 15 seconds of rest, 44k with 30 seconds, 53k with 15. As long as you keep the HR up, little breaks to rehydrate don't matter.  The longest I would go if I was new to this type of a stuff would be around an hour of work to avoid back injury. For now, try to start with 30k a week and work your way up slowly, maybe 5% per week.  If you want to wear a heart rate strap, it's a useful tool to understand how fatigue/intensity affects you. I did all my SS at HR 150 last year (almost exactly same scores at 70ish kg), and it worked for me pretty well. What you learn is that it varies depending on how much sleep/last meal/salt intake/temperature/humidity.   Last thing - read more. If you actually want to get good, you can make great bounds by learning how to train well. As previous, Vic City is a great club with a very competitive atmosphere.

Rowing,3bihni,acunc,4,Mon Jun 29 14:53:11 2015 UTC,"Our first practice back last fall at the beginning of the semester was a 20K test...even though none of us had ever done a test of that length (almost all of us never even a piece of that length) before. Just the sheer length of time on an erg made that miserable.  I used to fear the 2K more than anything. I would cruise through 6Ks with no anxiety, but now I'm just the opposite for whatever reasons.  We do a lot of interval work during the fall at ""threshold pace,"" our coach calls it. Essentially 6K/5K pace or a couple splits lower, depending on the length: 5x11min, 4x10min, 3x15min, 4x16min, 9x1500m (woof), shit like that."

Rowing,3bibso,sissif,7,Mon Jun 29 13:37:27 2015 UTC,"Watch the bows of the boats as they race. To me this is one of the best indicators of efficiency. The German mens eight, for example, always rows a stroke where the catch is timed perfectly with the point at which their bow has risen to the highest point. Contrast that with the harder stroke of say, the Canadian eight in 2012, where the bow rises to the highest point and begins to sink back down just as they catch. It's very noticeable in the heat - less so in the final, but it's there.  Another good example of both are the GB woman's pair and the NZ woman's pair at London 2012. The NZ pair really rushes the slide, killing the run by checking the boat and throwing off a well timed catch, whereas the GB pair picks the boat up while it's still running, creating a really smooth efficient stroke. The same was true of the Aus men's pair in 2008 and the NZ mens pair of 2008. Erg scores were comparable (Bridgewater is a beast), but the Aus guys just row so well that their efficiency gives them, what, a ten second victory?"
Rowing,3bibso,zknarc,6,Mon Jun 29 16:44:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, watching the bow at the catch is a really good indicator. I wish they had more data from the boats like they do in motorsport or america's cup so you have a good idea why one crew is faster than another.  A lot of guys very hung up on erg scores ITT."
Rowing,3bibso,sissif,3,Mon Jun 29 18:40:44 2015 UTC,"The Germans actually have a system which assigns certain pitches to certain speeds, they use it in the boat so the rowers can literally hear when they're slowing the boat down. A far easier way to gauge changes in boat speed and where they happen than trying to monitor by eye the change in boat speed while in the boat oneself. It's a great idea, and typical of the Germans to think of it.  I still think the main reason the German eight is so good is because they have better boat run than any of the other eights, especially the crews from 2011 and 2012."

Rowing,3bibso,BenW1994,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:06:04 2015 UTC,"Very good point. Now that you say it, it's surprising that rowing does not have more specific data on things like that, especially at an Olympic level, considering how equipment-intensive the sport it. It would be very interesting to see individual power curves, watts, stuff like that on the water from these athletes."
Rowing,3bibso,kitd,2,Mon Jun 29 19:07:33 2015 UTC,"I would expect that they do have that data, but it is only given to the individual countries, not public data. You can generate the data (and more) through telemetry."

Rowing,3bibso,supercompu2,2,Mon Jun 29 18:31:00 2015 UTC,"You can't. At least not the full race.   But here, compare these two videos:  Australia, smooth boat run, mostly still heads and good catches: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTWfBNWXzdk  And the New Zealand pair, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAcD39OStEw  Or better yet, their race in 2007: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCnrXM_oknU"
Rowing,3bibso,The_crew,6,Tue Jun 30 04:45:43 2015 UTC,"Another area of particular advantage can be pairing your crew to the correct equipment. Specifically, the way they work with a particular shell, blade, rig, etc.  Some coaches adopt certain equipment for the wrong reasons (new, shiny, brand loyalty), but a good coach can identify what equipment will make their rowers fly. For example, a coach who notices their guys tend to rip their finishes might opt for a C2 Fat blade over a Smoothie to lighten the finishes and firm up the front ends. Coaches who notice their guys have difficulty with entries, but haul ass through the rest of the stroke, might instead opt for Smoothies or Big Blades.   Some crews have exceptional symmetry and balance, and can row very well in tippy shells. Others may just be a bunch of brutes lacking finesse, and may need a more stable platform. When stability can sometimes come at the price of drag, little bits of speed lost here or gained there begin to add up.   A crew with a well-matched shell and oars to their rowing style will excel versus a crew who takes whatever equipment they may get. Over the course of 2000m, this pairing could easily make up 2-4 seconds."
Rowing,3bibso,acunc,6,Mon Jun 29 17:53:51 2015 UTC,"Technique wise, A lot of is is blade work and connection through the water. Sometimes it doesn't look as ""pretty"", but if the blade work is there it can still work.  Otherwise it comes down to experience and ""drive"""
Rowing,3bibso,squarebladesfeetout,10,Mon Jun 29 13:43:25 2015 UTC,"Technique, yes, but don't underestimate the difference erg scores will make.   Yes, most elite guys are all really fast, but a ten second erg difference isn't going to be overcome very easily just on technique. If you prioritize, say, the 2-, you could have a Bond/Murray who are both low 5:40s racing another 2- with ergs in the mid 5:50s. Good luck with that!"

Describing GB as having more of a ""surge"" and how that reflected their technique during the race while the very isolated sequencing of the French meant that they were really getting out of the way of the boat/letting the shell work to their advantage"
Rowing,3bibso,determinator007,3,Mon Jun 29 23:29:26 2015 UTC,"All of them! Listen to Martin Cross talk about how the Sinkovic brothers pick up the boat at the catch, or in the 8 he calls out someone for looking out the boat, or in the 2xs how rough the Italians look, or in the 4- how he talks about the US's rhythm. Literally every race has something."
Rowing,3bibso,tandemrigged,0,Tue Jun 30 01:31:08 2015 UTC,I mean most crews typically ask one question: will it make the boat go faster? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n-G91HGegQ
Rowing,3bk38a,F20Tigershark,4,Mon Jun 29 21:35:09 2015 UTC,"For the life of me I cannot remember who said this originally, but to paraphrase a great quote about the catch, it is not a sharpness but a readiness.  I think the most important thing to remember about catching is that it happens as a boat. The classic analogy of pushing a stone up a hill applies here - you want all eight guys pushing at once, not pushing one at a time. Then assuming you aren't sitting stroke, the crucial thing is that you be ready for the catch, anticipating it, not trying to quickly react when you see the moment arrive.  Rowing with the eyes closed is a classic drill to ""feel"" the entry, but my favorite might be rowing continuously with different entry points on the slide - this drill teaches you that it is less about putting your blade in at one particular ""spot"" on your recovery, and more about feeling when the oarsmen in front of you are going to place, and being ready with them.  I hope this helps, good luck!"
Rowing,3bk38a,twicemoneyswagg,3,Tue Jun 30 01:04:58 2015 UTC,"I would disagree. It's quite possible for stroke to be late/early to the catch. Ultimately the catch timing isn't dictated by the rowers but by the boat. So when you row eyes closed you aren't anticipating the people in front of you, but the actual boat. Off the end of the drive the boat is Riding high out the water and as you slow down the bow start to drop. You should be in the water to anticipate the bows dropping, not everyone else's catches. Have a look at the German VIII who I think are quite good at this.   In terms of your body: get prepped by quarter slide, square early, raise your hands as your heels come off the footplate, rising into the catch."
Rowing,3bk38a,SidViciious,3,Tue Jun 30 07:33:06 2015 UTC,"Watch the greats training and dissect what they're doing, really drill down on it, to develop a model for your own catches. The watch video of yourself and keep molding yourself to that image."
Rowing,3bk38a,squarebladesfeetout,2,Tue Jun 30 10:31:01 2015 UTC,The catch is by far the most vital part of the stroke in terms of moving the boat well and the stroke data I have taken from the 1x shows this in spades. The difficulty is that it is a feel thing and very difficult get by observation/explanation it took me probably about 1.5years to learn to get really solid blade-bedded-in-concrete feeling catches.   Key things:  1)  When you put pressure on the footplate you oar needs to be in otherwise all that energy goes into checking the boat (very easy to feel as a cox) 2)  Pressure needs to come on the instant the blade starts to enter the water so it locks instantly without starting to slip  Practice with the timing and only ‘landing’ on the footplate with pressure just as the blade touches the water. Do it right and it will feel like the oar is so solid it is like is bedded in concrete as the pressure comes on exactly at the right time.  With good crews you’ll see a ‘v’ splash: a touch of backsplash first followed by front splash the pressure comes on which happens quick enough it looks like a ‘v’.
Rowing,3bk38a,zknarc,2,Tue Jun 30 12:30:28 2015 UTC,"The visual that helped me get this sorted out was the idea of backing the blade in.  I noticed earlier you mentioned that your own coach's analogy didn't work for you (my coach's analogy was ""hooking telephone poles"". WHa...?), and this might not either, but that was it for me.  In terms of execution, I spent one practice totally overdoing it.  I literally pushed my blades in for the last inch or two of the recovery to get the feeling of the handles giving a jerk in my hands, and then the next practice finding the middle ground.  ""Activate a push to get the blades in before the pull"".  It clicked!"
Rowing,3bk38a,2dnburied,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:04:46 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by placement? How compressed you are each stroke?   If that's what you mean, maybe you can try this: in compression, you may feel a ""knees to chest"" or ""gut to thighs"" type of feeling. Feeling for that can help you get into full compression every stroke."
Rowing,3bk38a,Arina222,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:21:11 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I wait until the end of the recovery to drop my blade in the water, so I have a bit of a pause.  This doesn't give me enough backsplash. One coach said you're supposed to visualize dropping your oar in between two concrete blocks going by on a conveyor belt.... that didn't do a lot for me.   Everyone has a different way of explaining rowing so I was wondering if someone else had a visual image that helped them know when to drop the blade in the water."
Rowing,3bk38a,OARneryRower,2,Mon Jun 29 22:57:55 2015 UTC,"One thing that I like to emphasize is ""hooking"" the water instead of dropping the blade in/quick catches. Sometimes with dropping the oar in you end up pausing or catching late or rowing it in or ""killing fish"" by hammering the blade into the water. With hooking the water you want to think about using the oar to grab a ""chunk"" of water that you then accelerate the boat past. You will need to square up early enough that you approach the catch on the square and then loop your hands up and out so that the blade travels back and in. Try Russian catch drills for a while to get a sense for what it feels like to hook the catch with the full weight of the boat. A mental thing that helped me early on was to think about reaching back and wrapping your oar around a stake in the water. The stake is stationary and so your blade stays in one spot while you pivot the boat around it. Kinda like a punter or a gondolier plants the stick in something solid and then pivots forward."
Rowing,3bk38a,NeverNervous1,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:51:26 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with the concept of ""hooking"" the blade into the water.  Try using visualization,  it should be a simple picture in your mind of what the perfect catch looks like and then replicating it with the blade through the input your hands are giving to the handle.  The hook is how your hands feel as they are reaching out for the water as you square and drop the blade in (creating the ""backsplash"" that we all talk about).  OARnery does a good job of explaining it through the looping of the hands. This concept worked the best in improving my catch."
Rowing,3bk38a,gigantuar,2,Tue Jun 30 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"Imagine you're holding a tennis ball, and you want to drop this tennis ball into a bucket while it's moving forward. You don't wait until you're over the bucket to drop the ball, momentum will cause you to miss. Instead we have to release the ball early so that it carries into the bucket.   The catch is the same thing. You need to anticipate the catch and bring your hands up at the catch so that momentum carries the blade into the water, otherwise you'll essentially be putting on the brakes with every stroke."
Rowing,3bk38a,Arina222,2,Tue Jun 30 02:55:55 2015 UTC,"Has anyone tried ""hands rising into the catch"" or ""backing the blade in"" or ""aggressive catch"" or ""right into the water""? Another issue might be that the rest of the crew doesn't deccelerate the last quarter of the slide as much as you do.   Another possible strategy is to find a target on the back of the rower in front you and aim your hands for that target each stroke. It's typically used for balance, but it might get your hands moving more like the rest of your crew."
Rowing,3bk38a,petersculls,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:09:21 2015 UTC,With a square blade while the others set the boat (the boat not moving) you can do the last six inches of slide and practice a few catches. No drive just the entry into the water. You can look at the blade to see that you are doing it right and if not make corrections. You can also do the same thing but start at the finish and go though the feathering and squaring action on the recovery before you drop it in. Again no drive you are just working on getting the motions of putting it in the water. Then you can try some strokes with the drive and see if you can do that as the others set the boat.
Rowing,3bgzkg,SackNicholson,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:32:21 2015 UTC,One of the main benefits of SS is that you can build your aerobic base without needing more than a day to recover from each workout. I'm not sure either cat 5 or 6 will do you much good if you're only doing it once a week.
Rowing,3bgzkg,nish26,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:48:32 2015 UTC,I would consider switching up HIIT for aerobic training. Would 3 times a week do it? basically every other day
Rowing,3bgzkg,nish26,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:09:11 2015 UTC,"Depends what your training goals are and what you're training for. If it's just to improve aerobic base, then 3 times per weeks is fine albeit on the lower on end.  Stick to Cat5 if you only do SS 3 times per week, and throw in an occasional AT or sprint workout either in addition to or instead of a lifting session."
Rowing,3bgzkg,OARneryRower,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:55:08 2015 UTC,isnt cat 6 75% of your heart rate? whats the purpose of 5?
Rowing,3bgzkg,OARneryRower,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:35:38 2015 UTC,"Take a look at my comment history for an erg split calculator based off your 2k pace. You will see that category 5 is essentially hard SS. There is also a description of how you benefit physiologically from the different training zones. C6 is useful because it allows you to skill build by putting miles behind the oar with minimal damage and a much smaller recovery period between workouts. Unless you are doing 2 or more sessions a day, you are getting 24+ hours recovery between workouts and you can do your miles at a higher intensity for a greater physiological benefit in a shorter period of time. Also, the erg requires less technical skill so even if you were training every day you would probably be better off doing 45"" at C5 or faster than 75"" at C6."
Rowing,3bgzkg,OARneryRower,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:21:41 2015 UTC,"makes sense. Thanks for the post, I saved your post with the split calculator. I will download when I get home. So you are saying that If i am doing SS between my lifting sessions every other day (3 a week) I should be doing Cat5 based on a split instead of HR. In my case I will have 24 hours in between each workout (Not rowing workout. I will have 24 hours until another lift and 48 hours before another row) Too many outside factors impact HR so you are better off getting your body used to split?"
Rowing,3bgzkg,radical13,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:41:50 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's a pretty good synopsis. If you are doing 6 total workouts a week then you might want to throw in some interval training (C2-4) for a bit of variety. C6 is probably a waste of time for you unless you start adding some cardio around your lifting or doing more than 1 workout a day."

Rowing,3bg9ef,SackNicholson,3,Sun Jun 28 23:26:28 2015 UTC,"There are 6 traditional training categories that people refer to based off the national team's training programs, calling them ""cat"" for short. Cat 1 being the most intense, cat 6 being the least intense.  There are essentially 3 broad training zones (it gets narrower and more specific than this, but I'm oversimplifying to give you the basics).   Anaerobic: done at or above race pace (32+ SPM). This is your top end sprint work. Simulates the intensity of racing, these are the workouts where you go really hard and learn to embrace the pain of rowing.  Sample workouts: 6x500m w/ 2' rest, 12x 1' on 1' off, 3x1000m w/ 4-5' rest, etc.   Anaerobic threshold: done ~4-6 SPM below race pace. Very firm pressure type pieces where you are pushing hard, but the effort has to be sustainable as well. Not balls to the wall sprinting, but more of a long and strong type idea. Strength endurance work.  Sample workouts: 2x20' w/ 5' rest, 3x15' with rate changes, etc. SR for these would be anywhere from 22-28, depending on the person.   Aerobic: done at 18-22 SPM. This is your steady state training. Meant to build your aerobic capacity without interfering with your other training (doesn't require a lot of recovery time).  Sample workouts: 2x40' with 2-4' rest, 15k, 3x6k.   Most club athletes I know are training about 10 times a week. The breakdown is something like:  -1 anaerobic workout  -2 anaerobic threshold workouts  -2 lifts   -5 steady state/aerobic workouts  Give or take, of course. Depends whether it is racing or training season, etc."

Aerobic capacity improvement is possible, but with higher HR workouts. I do HIIT so I like to think that workout does the trick for capacity. I will add in 2 Cat VI workouts a week for myself. Cat VI can be done basically any time even on a rest day correct?"
Rowing,3bg9ef,determinator007,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:38:11 2015 UTC,"It's relative depending on the individual. Sure, the national team can do cat 6 workouts on their rest day, because their ""rest day"" involves one workout that day as opposed to 3. For someone that trains ~6/week like yourself, I would not recommend a cat 6 erg/row on your rest day.   Either take the day completely off, or if you really need to do something, cycle for maybe half an hour at a light pace and do some core."
Rowing,3bg9ef,macca_chris,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:43:00 2015 UTC,sounds good. So to the national teams that workout is so light that their bodies can just recover even on a workout like that. Makes sense.

Rowing,3bcspo,readyallrow,11,Sun Jun 28 01:39:51 2015 UTC,"It's different competition. Usually high school teams prioritize an 8 so you're going up against stronger competition.   Also, four people moving a boat well doesn't mean those 4 people plus another 4 will move an 8 well. You could have two gold medal fours that don't move an eight well if they row differently."
Rowing,3bcspo,acunc,3,Sun Jun 28 01:40:27 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd say it probably more has to do with going up against tougher competition. I had a year of youth rowing where we did fours maybe once every other week and always won by healthy margins when we entered fours events. Prioritized the eight but still had much more trouble in those events just because most of the faster crews also prioritized that boat
Rowing,3bcspo,determinator007,6,Sun Jun 28 11:48:56 2015 UTC,"How fat is the cox? Just kidding, in all seriousness it could be an inability to move effectively in the 8. For instance, some of your basic fundamentals could be flawed - rushing the slide, not connecting to the water, gassing out during the race. I honestly don't know without a video..."
Rowing,3bcspo,notjohndoetoo,7,Sun Jun 28 01:32:08 2015 UTC,Interesting question! Is there any difference in the boats? Are you using top of the line fours as opposed to an older eight?
Rowing,3bcspo,alh9h,2,Sun Jun 28 01:41:33 2015 UTC,well it is harder to get all 8 rowing together in a 8 boat.
Rowing,3bcspo,bud_city,4,Sun Jun 28 20:42:24 2015 UTC,"It might be to do with your style of rowing. You could be technically stronger than the other crews, but just not have enough raw power to haul the 8 along. The 4 normally feels heavier, so you need to accelerate through the drive, rather than just slamming the legs down straight away. Maybe when you're in the 8, you're still rowing it like a 4 and not applying pressure fast enough. Because of how fast the boat is moving, things like catch speed tend to matter more in the 8, whereas in small boats you can afford to be slightly more gentle. Similarly, the 4 takes longer to complete 4km (because it's moving slower obviously), so maybe you are fitter than the other crews, but they are stronger."
Rowing,3bcspo,coxcoxcox,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:40:09 2015 UTC,Have you tried comparing gold medal times of your 4+'s and the 8+ to check you really are under performing in the 8+?   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_records_in_rowing  As mentioned it could simply be that the standard of the oppo is higher in the 8's than the 4's rather than you are doing anything particularly wrong
Rowing,3bcspo,A_Rower,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:58:38 2015 UTC,Power to weight ratio perhaps your fours are lighter boats and suit them better and your eight is a lugging battle ship?

You would have a hard time competing with the guys who are up at 185-200 lbs.  That being said, I wouldn't worry much about your weight at all until Spring racing starts.  For the novice guys especially, the first semester will be spent learning techniques and building strength endurance.  Your lineups for regattas will be fairly random, and you might be rowing in mixed boats (heavy and lights together) anyway."

Rowing,3bdx9c,cookiesandscream,2,Sun Jun 28 15:12:25 2015 UTC,"So we always had two practices every afternoon, usually around 4 and 6 pm.  You're encouraged to attend the earliest one you can make each day.  So you would probably go to the 4:00 except for the one day you have late class."

Give it a crack, if you train smart, eat well, and rest, you could become a lean machine while at 160, and have a hell of a lot of fun along the way (:   Hope this helps in some way!"

Rowing,3bciqy,MightyLighty,9,Sat Jun 27 22:38:19 2015 UTC,Not sequencing the drive/recovery. probably the biggest slow down to a boat as it causes the boat to bounce and pitch about.
Rowing,3bciqy,Tsav150,5,Sat Jun 27 22:45:22 2015 UTC,"I have to fully agree with this, not properly thinking about how a boat moves and simply throwing your weight around in a boat is a common problem for erg behemoths who haven't rowed/sculled a lot."
Rowing,3bciqy,_2147483647,2,Sat Jun 27 22:49:34 2015 UTC,"I finally got this after four years when I switched to the single after being on a sweep team for 5 years. My coach immediately pointed it out, and once I got that and better leg application, I dropped about 1:03 on my SS splits on the water."
Rowing,3bciqy,DancingBlades,6,Sat Jun 27 23:41:57 2015 UTC,"Catch accuracy + quick application of power. Until the blade's in the water and you're both connected and shoving, you are slowing the boat down, not speeding it up."
Rowing,3bciqy,Almostanathlete,3,Sat Jun 27 22:53:55 2015 UTC,Balance - If the boat isn’t set no one can properly put any power down anyway Crew timing - if they crew can’t row in time it just won’t move well Timing at the catch - not getting pressure on at the right time means you are holding the boat up on every stroke and the blade won’t lock on for a solid connection.  I’ve coxed a boat with erg behemoths with questionable technique. During a racing start there was so much check on the boat I thought I was going to get thrown out of it and there was so much water thrown around the crew may as well have.
Rowing,3bciqy,zknarc,2,Sun Jun 28 10:56:08 2015 UTC,"I would imagine that most speed is lost between the catch and finish. Getting the blade in and out leaves a lot of space to take away power that would otherwise be used to push the boat forwards. Plus allowing for the change of direction of the rower, lots of places to slow the boat down."

Rowing,3bciqy,youtubefactsbot,2,Sun Jun 28 13:25:13 2015 UTC,"Certainly the biggest flaw that will stop you in your tracks (aside from the absolute lack of ratio) is the lack of acceleration.  You want your blade to be moving its fastest into the finish.  Since the boat is moving relative to the water, whenever the blade is connected, the boat cannot go faster than the fastest the blade is moving.  So if you leave the boat going slower at the finish than at halfway through the drive (or some other point), you have essentially put a brake on the boat.    I liken this to any number of sports that many rowers have done.  It's akin to the follow through when pitching a baseball or golfing or literally any sport where you are transferring momentum from one object to another.  A baseball pitcher doesn't slow down his arm into the release - and rowers should not slow down the handle into the body.  Second thing I'd emphasize is getting power down together.  If you have eight rowers applying forces at different times during the drive, you are losing a lot of speed and likely causing set issues.  Back down on the leg drive when you're trying to get a crew to row well together and focus on just planting the blades together, then getting acceleration with the torso and arms.  Once you get the catch and acceleration, you can up the forces with the legs.  If you watch many lower-level crews row, you'll see how obvious this is with the legs getting down at different speeds.  That's a huge issue when we want to get every part of the stroke together."

Generally, if the 4 people in a quad are decent scullers and have big ergs, the boat will be pretty fast. I think the technique/power application part is nowhere near as important in a 4x as it is in a 1x or 2x. For that reason, the fact that they have been rowing together for a while wouldn't be that much of an upside for me, and is kind of wiped out by the fact that they're slow.   What is the potential double partner like? I know you said he hasn't sculled in a year, but was he really good before? Or did he only scull for a few months and then switch back to sweeping? If you feel like he's someone that you can learn from, this could be a decent option.  I would probably go for the single if I were you. There are still ~6 weeks til Henley, so you can get loads better if you start now."

Rowing,3baqx1,MightyLighty,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:40:19 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you have DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness).   I think the consensus uses to be that it was caused by excess lactic acid after a particularly hard workout, but it may actually be caused by microtears in your muscles.   There doesn't appear to be any proper treatment for it apart from rest. You can google and find different solutions, but from my experience rest is the only real one. You should start feeling better after 2-4 days.   If it makes it any easier you shouldn't feel it this badly next time you have a big leg workout (unless you leave ages between the workouts)  In the meantime enjoy going to the toilet ;)"

Take a day off from lifting and rowing if you're reaaaally sore and just jog it out. If that doesn't work you need to take a day off completely and rest. Make sure you're taking in protein immediately following your lifts, so you can jump-start the repair process. Definitely helps."

Rowing,3baqx1,husky_notbigboned,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:15:03 2015 UTC,"As everyone has stated, you have delayed onset muscle soreness.  Usually hits its worst 24-48 hours after the activity that caused it.  DOMS is just a product of the eccentric lengthening of your muscle fibers.  Each fiber gets repeatedly stretched at a high tension as you perform the downward motion of a jump squat, and the individual fibers will tear and inflame.  Once you tear the fibers, there's nothing you can do but eat well and keep active.  It's a natural part of muscle repair and regeneration.  In the future, for the same workout, you'll have significantly less damage to the muscle and likely not feel this way."
Rowing,3baqx1,-not-a-serial-killer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:42:20 2015 UTC,"If I have a particularly strenuous workout that I can tell is going to give me bad DOMS, then I will put on some compression shorts (my favourite is the 2XU Elite MCS Half-Tight) straight afterwards. I used to think that they were only useful during the workout, but to avoid DOMS, it can  sometimes be better to keep them on after the workout, sometimes even over night.

I hate to break it to you, but experience really is the best teacher: You can't just hear about boat terms and then be able to perform them. Your boat wasn't going to be set whether you talked about how to set the boat or not.  I'd also say calling out individuals isn't really easy when dealing with set unless one person only is doing something wrong in an obvious way. People naturally try to compensate by doing weird things; you just have to all work towards getting a feel for balance in the boat and those compensations will decrease. Also, at the speeds a noob boat will be going at, crabs aren't dangerous. Heck, I've been in a boat where someone caught a fairly bad crab in the last 300m of a 2k (that was a horrible feeling) and he probably didn't get more than a bruise.  Not to say that the coaches and coxswain couldn't try a little harder to communicate better (especially after being a part of rowing for a while, it's easy to forget that most people don't know port and starboard, much less catch, way enough, check, etc.) but this definitely isn't a completely unheard of method of teaching the first time."
Rowing,3b9ila,vis9000,7,Sat Jun 27 05:23:04 2015 UTC,"I was about to make a list of everything you should teach novices before they get in a boat and then suddenly realised how long the list was getting. There's a lot of basic knowledge and terminology you have to be comfortable with to start getting a feel for it, and honestly it can be overwhelming for someone new to the sport. Even things like getting boats in/out and set up can be quite complicated and to be honest, it's probably better to get you on the water and don't something rather than worrying about it too much.   But also keep in mind that most coaches are just good rowers who want to earn some cash or give back now they are no longer competitive. They aren't necessarily good coaches for novices, because it can be so obvious to us and we don't get why you don't know something. And keep in mind the purpose of a ""Learn to row"" course -- it's not really to teach you to row (well), but really to get you happy and comfortable in a boat so you want to learn to row well (:  My advice would be to ask as many questions as you can. The rest of your crew will appreciate it, I'm sure. The other bit of advice worth having is to always assume that you are the one causing the problem in the boat and try to work on it even if you aren't specifically called out on it"
Rowing,3b9ila,SidViciious,3,Sat Jun 27 09:04:16 2015 UTC,"Oops I wrote a novel.  Sorry!  LTR coach here, though I will say that I only instruct quads.  It sounds like your own coach might be a little disorganized, but truthfully I don't think you're far off from a standard LTR. To directly address the concerns you mention here: The truth is that everything is so new when you start rowing, and there is so much to learn, that there is no way that participants can pick everything up before they hit the water.  The best thing to do is get everyone in the boat (safely, of course), and just start (lesson 2 for me).  I say things like ""I want you to take 5 strokes on port, that's your right hand"" because not a single new person is going to remember port from starboard on that first night.  Trying to learn to sync up on an erg is pointless.  ""Your job is to follow along with the person in front of you.  Ready, row.  Screwed up on your first try? Stop, try again.  Ok, you two are done.  Next pair!""  Teaching a group of new rowers to turn a boat is hilariously difficult.  You absolutely have to put them in and force them to do it.  They do not understand a single word of what you are saying until they have an oar in their hand and simply follow your directions word for word.  Regarding the feet, setting up your feet in the water is pretty much a required skill.  I prefer to do it on the dock with the noobs, but it can scrape up oars on the dock, and it may be club policy that you never ever adjust feet on the dock.  You waste time and space, so...just get out and do it.  From the coaches perspective, we're under a time crunch.  Not only do I have to make sure that they immediately have all skills required to safely get a boat on and off the water (turning, etc.)  I have 5 lessons to get these people feeling like they know how to row.  I'm blitzing through absolutely everything to make them feel like they haven't wasted their money, they've had some fun, have learned a new skill, and want to keep giving my club money so they can keep rowing.  Chances are good I have at least one problem child that can't tell their ass from their elbow, now I need to deal with the fact that someone needs extra attention, and everyone else is sitting around getting bored.  I have to prioritize individual skills and technique, as well of the needs of the boat as a whole.  It is unfortunately not always an easy task.  Ok...I know you don't really care what the coach is going through when you've paid a lot of money to learn how to row.  I just wanted you to know how many moving parts there are.  My advice to you is pay attention (even when the coach isn't talking to you directly), do your best, try to trust that you will improve as you continue to row over your next few sessions, and have a bit of fun.  Learning to row is hard, and probably unlike anything you've ever done before.  Try to have an open mind, and a positive outlook.  Relax and you'll start to get it.  Unless you're that damn problem child...then there's no hope for you ;)"
Rowing,3b9ila,2dnburied,3,Sat Jun 27 18:40:58 2015 UTC,"Your first priority should be taking as many strokes as possible.  The downfall of many coaches teaching folks to row is that they give out too much advice and offer too many corrections.  Just let the novices take a lot of strokes and once they can competently put their blade in the water with 7 other people, then try and refine it.  Naturally, some things like how you are gripping the oar should be taught early, as well as differentiating between what either hand should be doing while sweeping.  But for the most part, the best way to learn is to just stick your blade in the water, push, pull, remove blade from water and repeat ad infinitum."
Rowing,3b9ila,husky_notbigboned,2,Sat Jun 27 15:30:58 2015 UTC,"at our club our novices  1)erg 2)Move to tank to synchronize 3)Go out in 4x/Quads and 8+/eights with varsity rowers spread throughout the boats, or varisty coxswains 4)Proceed to entirely novice 4x's and 8+'s"
Rowing,3b9ila,DILAPIDAT3,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:40:47 2015 UTC,"I've been rowing for three years, and as someone who is now a coach for the same Learn to Row that once taught me, I can inform you that the learning experience varies based on the program. When I was first learning to row, we spent the first 3 days off the water practicing on the ergs, and going over the equipment and safety precautions. It is essential to know the commands a coach or coxswain might give to their rowers to ensure success and safety. Your coach may have excellent skill at rowing, but could lack in the communication skills needed to teach the sport. One of my previous coaches was very similar to what yours sounds like. He was an excellent rower, but was very awkward socially, and always had a hard time telling our team exactly what he wanted to focus on. Because of this, many our guys left because our boats weren't improving.  As for practicing in an eight on the first day, how many people were rowing at once? When I was first taught, we were out in an eight shell, but we only rowed by pairs so that the boat would be set for the two at a time that were on. Since I first learned, our team's purchased a ""Barge"", which is a boat for eight rowers that stacks them in 2 columns of 4, with room for the coxswain and/or coach to walk between. This setup allows me to walk down the deck closely checking everyone's technique. As a novice rower, you should priOARitize (sorry, I had to) timing and handle heights. While there are many factors that compile the perfect stroke, your position seems to be one in which multiple pairs or all eight are rowing and are having a hard time keeping the boat set. Although I could go in depth of what proper handle hight is, I recommend asking your instructor about anything you aren't 100% certain with. Even if you have to talk to him before or after the class, it's crucial for you to get your technique down pat if you have any interest of ever rowing at a competitive level.  I admire your efforts in wanting to get better, and I wish you the best of luck in your rowing career!"

Even though the first week can be boring, its important to go slow and reinforce basic technique - in the end though its important to simply get a lot of strokes in. Heres a sample of our first week  Day One: didn't go on the water, practiced carrying oars, carrying boat and getting it in and out of the water, talked about safety, spend a considerable amount of time on the ergs, and introduced the kids to the varsity rowers who will be their bow pairs, stern pairs and coxswains over the next few weeks  Day 2: Reviewed technique on erg, took rowers out in Barge, transferring technique onto erg and explaining differences necessary to move boat on water (dropping blade in at catch, tapping handle down at finish, demonstrating how to set the boat even though we were in barge)   Day 3,4: more review on erg at start of each day, take out 8s and begin rowing by 4s on the pause, row continuous if they seem to be getting it.   Day 5: Row in 8s, more drills by 4s, row stern 6 with varsity rowers setting up the boat in bow pair, do some power tens so they get a taste of what its like to go a little faster"
Rowing,3b9ila,_endurance_,-3,Sat Jun 27 17:53:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  This is what I was looking for, this kind of building block approach that builds up the skills before you try to put them all together at once.  This sounds like a much more effective and enjoyable way to learn to row.  I know that not all clubs can have access to ""training wheel"" equipment like tanks and barges, but there must be other ways to practise these skills in isolation to build up basic technique.  I think I might need to look around for a programme that has something more like this approach.  Thanks again."

There have been a number of responses and you chose this one, just to validate your original opinion.The most important thing as a novice is to accept that you suck.

Rowing,3b450w,rowerldn,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:03:33 2015 UTC,"I don't have the results for the race with me, but if I recall the overall rankings were adjusted to reflect penalties but the times weren't (Brookes had the second fastest time but came third, or something like that). I think you're also overrating the strength of the scratch ""squad"" crews from Leander etc. - Oxford and Cambridge routinely beat them in fixtures."
Rowing,3b450w,theicemanguy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:08:57 2015 UTC,"Brookes were still figuring out their fastest crew at that point the year I believe, while OUBC were much closer to their peak. If a full strength blue boat raced a full strength Brookes boat, it would be closer than Reading."
Rowing,3b450w,BenW1994,3,Fri Jun 26 22:16:24 2015 UTC,"Remember that many many Oxford and Cambridge rowers are much older than American university rowers - Americans typically only have 4 years of university rowing while any student at Oxford or Cambridge is eligible no matter what they're studying.  Case in point: Caryn Davies stroked the Oxford women's blue boat this year (2015). She finished rowing at Harvard in 2005, but has still been studying post-graduate so is still eligible for a Blue Boat."
Rowing,3b450w,CAPTAIN_TEATIME,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:26:39 2015 UTC,"As was already mentioned, both Oxford and Cambridge are very fast and would be competitive at the IRAs. Washington beat Cambridge a couple of years ago by a pretty large margin at the Windermere Cup, after beating them pretty handily earlier that year in Cambridge's longer home course in preparation for their Boat Race, but that was also a very fast Husky crew:  http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-huskies/huskies-crews-cruise-in-windermere-cup/  They beat Oxford the previous year at the Windermere Cup: http://www.gohuskies.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30200&ATCLID=208024717  Before narrowly losing to the British National team last year: http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-huskies/2014-windermere-cup-uw-crew-splits-with-great-britain-in-feature-races/"

Rowing,3b450w,Harryofsol,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:49:39 2015 UTC,"The winner of the IRA is likely slightly slower than the winning Blue boat, with few exceptions.  Though you really cannot compare the two, as boat race crews are not made up of the same kind of students as IRA crews (post-grad vs undergrad)"
Rowing,3b450w,The_crew,3,Fri Jun 26 09:31:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'd agree that the IRA winner is slightly slower than the winning Blue boat, as the strength of championship crews (on both sides of the pond) varies perceptibly each year. Oxford did edge Washington in 2009 in their Boat Race tune-up, but that was on Oxford's home course where being familiar with the currents and minutia of the course is a tangible advantage. It was also against a young UW squad that, while talented, did not have the speed of subsequent UW squads (see 2012, 2013), racing 10 minute pieces in the midst of heavy training for a 2k racing season. Thus, this deserves to be thrown out as much as UW’s victory over Oxford and Cambridge at the Windermere.   Consider instead that Washington's 2012 IRA time of 5:21.482 was a mere two seconds shy of the Canadians' current World Record of record of 5:19.35. UW then went to Henley the following year and were within a boat length of the British National Team –a would-be course record had it not been for the Brits setting a new course record just ahead of them.   Unless you're stating that the Oxford and Cambridge boats are consistently faster, or at least equal to, the world champion British squad that narrowly beat IRA winner Washington, one could argue that the inverse is more likely (at least in these days of heavy international recruiting to top U.S. schools): The winner of the IRA is likely slightly faster than the winning Blue boat.   Granted, Washington have won an unprecedented five consecutive IRAs, sweeping all five events three of the past four regattas in dominant fashion, and can therefore be considered outliers to a degree. Nevertheless, that's the bar these days to win the Championship in the U.S, and with Cal and others following close behind, I'm not sure Oxford and Cambridge's success in even cracking the top three would be as assured as your statement suggests."
Rowing,3b450w,Gr8tDane,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:49:04 2015 UTC,I'm just confused about how British rowing operates. Do Oxford and Cambridge go to any other regattas besides the Boat Race?
Rowing,3b450w,kitd,5,Fri Jun 26 22:30:38 2015 UTC,"Not seriously.   Bear in mind that being a top athlete can actually work against you at Oxbridge. Boat Race training takes up so much time that when it's over, the university expectes the athletes to knuckle down to their academic work. Sustained periods of training and racing outside the BR season is frowned on unless there aren't too many other academic commitments. There are exceptions for NT athletes but they tend to be doing their own thing anyway.  As for the rest of the UK, you can equate UK uni rowing clubs (even the best ones) to US club programs. The university (normally) provides them with no money, funds coming from membership fees, sponsorship and in some cases the Students Union (the national student body)"
Rowing,3b450w,AlexG55,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:57:48 2015 UTC,So is the boat race the only event they compete in all spring?
Rowing,3b450w,comonXsense,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:33:03 2015 UTC,"The boat race is their season, everything else is training for it.  They are very careful not to have the two crews compete directly against each other before then. Sometimes they'll do another head race- for instance OUBC did Reading this year, and a few years ago CUBC entered Head of the River.   They will also have their ""sparring"" fixtures on the Tideway against either top British clubs (Leander/Molesey) or crews from abroad The year before, they tend to send several fours to Fours Head, which is an early indicator of the strength of the squads.  But you are correct in thinking that the Boat Race is the only event that both universities send full crews to. The other big reason for that is college rowing- after the boat race, the Blue Boat rowers traditionally go back to row for their colleges."

Rowing,3b4thv,OARneryRower,3,Fri Jun 26 00:05:56 2015 UTC,"You could just jimmy rig a yoga mat seat pad with some duct tape to add a velcro strap that wraps around the seat.  There has also been some real progress made in seat design in the last few years. My Croker women's seat is pretty crazy comfortable. The ideal for me would be to have the wheels on an adjustable mechanism so that the seat could be easily used in more than one boat. I.e. My empacher has tracks that are wider than the Hudson 2- that I row. It would be cool to be able to take the seat out, adjust the wheel base quickly, and put it in another boat."

Just looking at the beginner plan, any of these pieces can be absolutely medieval if pulled at the right intensity.   The 5000m pieces are supposed to be SS. If 5000 is too short a distance, you can increase to 7500 or 8000 (or even 10k). If you're out of shape, you'll find your HR will increase steadily if you hold the same rate over 30-60 minutes.  Definitely do the optional workouts.  I'd recommend just sticking to a stroke rate for a specific workout and adjusting your drive thru the legs as needed. Sometimes locking into a rate is enough to get a feel for a piece's intensity. As you get stronger, you can drop hammers.  Here's what I'd do for week 1 if I were doing this:   5000m @18 6 x 500m / 2min rest @30-32 (34-36 if you want to get used to higher rates) 5000m @18 [20min] @22-24 (Like the 5ks, but a little snappier) [2 x 10min / 2min rest] (24-26) (Or 26-28)   What the hell am I talking about, he tells you what to focus on right there on the page. Just follow the plan. If you're new, you don't need extras yet.  If you can, find someone who knows what they're doing to coach you thru a few pieces. The first few of 6x500m pieces can definitely make you puke if you don't know how to pace them."

The winner of each event, if from the UK, are probably the fastest student crew in the country in that discipline. There are also other students that are racing in the higher up events because they are ineligible in the student events (e.g. previous winners).  There isn't really a non-top event at Henley.

It is based on the Canadian National Team training standards. - http://www.reddit.com/r/Rowing/comments/31waji/erg_split_calculator_and_training_guide/  I've said it before and I will say it again - determining your effort based on heart rate is not the best way of going about training. In part this is because everyone has different heart rate bands and in part it is because your heart rate is strongly affected by things like temperature, humidity, and fatigue. FYI I wear a heart rate monitor during training but I have done 1000m pieces at a 185 and I have done 20k SS rows at a 175. I find it useful to monitor HR as a way of tracking changes in environmental stimuli and individual fatigue.... but I have gotten really far doing watts/splits based training. No national team coach is going to take your HR during a piece and say ""oh man, you should definitely not be pulling so hard"". They might take your HR or lactate and  say ""you need to sleep more, you need to drink more water, and we should probably flip a fan on in here""."

I bike to and from practice 2x a day, and for some reason my HR wasn't going past 120 on the bike ride today, whereas usually it's around 135.   But regarding your question about your SS pace being 2k+30 (though it's better to determine off watts since splits don't have a linear relationship), that's probably about right if this is your first time training seriously at a SS pace. Most people are mind-blown by how slow true SS is when they first start doing it."

Rowing,3b3ils,OARneryRower,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:55:32 2015 UTC,Isn't there a general guideline as in add x number of seconds to your 2k split to do 10k SS in? It'd be much more sense to a new rower like me.
Rowing,3b3ils,Oskaznoqetsocj,3,Fri Jun 26 01:17:32 2015 UTC,"splits don't have a linear relationship :) So - just for example.   1:55.0 = 179.2 watts 2:00.0 = 202.5 watts 2:05.0 = 230.1 watts   So this means that going from 2:05.0 to 2:00.0 means an increase of 23.3 watts and going from 2:00 to 1:55.0 means an increase of 27.6 watts.   You can generalize these training bands but it's pretty easy to just fill in your 2k score, have the spreadsheet calculate your split bands, and go from there."

Second, you say heart rate isn't an accurate way of determining effort when you went ahead and put it into your spreadsheet you linked me.   So are you trying to mislead people by putting it in there? Because I honestly don't know.  Third, you say fatigue is a erroneous factor, when that is THE factor that is trying to be assessed.  Maybe the mods haven't stickies your post because it is filled with inaccurate and incomplete information.   Also there is a winning in rowing, I just don't think you've ever reached it."
Rowing,3b3ils,OARneryRower,10,Fri Jun 26 01:41:43 2015 UTC,"Rawr.  Heart rates are in there because that part is copied from an old rowing Canada document. Heart rate is a decent way to track training but I still don't believe it is a good way to determine exertion.  Fatigue is not the only thing that affects heart rate. It should certainly be taken into account when writing a training program and when evaluating what an athlete is able to do. I do not think workouts should be made easier because of high heart rate alone. If you are too fatigued to complete a C6 workout at a reasonable pace, you should certainly re-evaluate your training program and how you schedule rest.  You know nothing about me. As a matter of principal I refuse to get into pissing contests with teenaged boys.  If you don't like my advice, don't follow it. Simple as that.  To answer your original question, it seems perfectly normal for someone with a resting HR of 65 and a max of 208 to do SS between 25 and 30 split seconds above their 2k pace."

Rowing,3axtha,AverageSculler,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:36:51 2015 UTC,"In my clickings around the internet, it looks like the Olympics have some sort of regulation regarding clearance that wing riggers address, but that being said I couldn't find any hard evidence that they're better. Although I did check the world championships (I don't know if they have the same regulation on clearance) and like the olympics, they too all have wing riggers.  It's just been me doing some light googling, so please, if you have any links or anything let me know."
Rowing,3axtha,TheeSweeney,2,Thu Jun 25 14:26:27 2015 UTC,"No links for you, but as I understand it, wing riggers allow the pressure to be applied into more evenly into the shell of the boat, while 3 stay riggers apply it into 3 smaller points. This means those points need reinforcing with a shoulder. In a wing rigged boat, you can put all that carbon somewhere else in the boat, to get a stiffer boat, for the same weight. There's definitely more to it, but that's one advantage."

Rowing,3b074l,NeverNervous1,3,Wed Jun 24 22:31:08 2015 UTC,I have used them. I own Croker S4 full carbon and have always preferred them to any other oar. I tried out the arrows for a few days and found them pretty odd. They are weighted differently from the S4s and to me felt more like C2s. I doubt the performance difference is staggering when you compare a well rigged pair of C2s/S4s/arrows etc. But I am one of those people who thinks that improvements brought on by a change from one good piece of equipment to a slightly newer/perhaps slightly superior piece of equipment will be insubstantial in most cases. Generally... Learning to use the gear you've got is going to make a more significant difference. I believe the cost is about 150 more than S4 blades but dont quote me on that.
Rowing,3b074l,OARneryRower,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:21:44 2015 UTC,Thanks!  The upgrade would be from S4s.  I am handing the S4s down to another rower so am torn between another pair of S4s or the Arrows.The rower is a lightweight so weight would have an impact.    I think a demo would be appropriate (just need to find a pair!).  I agree the S4 is a great oar but if the new ones are to be used for the next five years and there is even a small increase in performance with the Arrow my gut says to go with the upgrade.
Rowing,3b074l,tandemrigged,2,Fri Jun 26 15:55:50 2015 UTC,"The first thing you notice is how much lighter and skinnier they are. For me this was a massive boost to my rowing as I found the oars were easier to move through the stroke. Also the catch connection with the blade face is very noticeable and you can really make sure you lock into the water before the drive phase begins.  I still rate C2 over Croker for Sweep oars, even though I used Arrows for my entire First VIII season. However now I'm rowing club you seriously can't go past sculling with a nice pair of Arrows!   Hope that helped! :)"
Rowing,3b074l,Tsav150,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:06:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input.  I think I will need to demo a pair of these.  The  rower who would be using these is a lightweight and rows at a fairly high cadence so weight and shaft aerodynamics will actually have an effect (especially if there is a head wind).
Rowing,3b074l,petersculls,2,Fri Jun 26 15:47:34 2015 UTC,How do they compare to the C2 skinny's? I sold my fat2 skinny's and went to smoothie 2s with stiff shafts because the skinnys had wayyyyy to much flex in the shaft. I am waiting for the day that they make the skinny shaft but with much less flex and I am wondering if the arrow may have finally done that?
Rowing,3b074l,Tsav150,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:53:50 2015 UTC,I think you had the soft flex skinny C2. I don't know if you tried the medium flex and what you would have thought of those.

Also, you need to be benchmarking for performance, not theoretical weight class and speed. Currently your physique is that of a heavyweight world champion woman. Your rigging and race strategy (rating closer to 30-32 than to 34-36) should reflect that.

The workload is fairly light - you don't get much lactate. It's an AT workout, not AN/max-level effort. You could do these 3 times a week alongside 10+ hours of steady state and not wear out."
Rowing,3azm56,polyfonik,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:24:01 2015 UTC,What kind of technical changes are you particularly looking to make?
Rowing,3azm56,2dnburied,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:25:01 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it's not really one thing in particular.  Upper body relaxation, drive/catch timing, clean finishes... name any common technical focus and I probably have room for improvement in that area!"
Rowing,3azdde,chaseperrin,3,Wed Jun 24 18:47:12 2015 UTC,Likely from feathering and probably just a case of toughing it out until your hands get calloused again. I used to get this from the ridges on the wooden handled oars.
Rowing,3azdde,zknarc,2,Wed Jun 24 19:48:57 2015 UTC,It's probably from your feathering action - I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. Just consciously make an effort to change how you grip with the inside hand as you feather.
Rowing,3azdde,acunc,2,Wed Jun 24 18:57:10 2015 UTC,Just on your inside hand? It's from feathering and will form there until the skin toughens. I have a callous there and a line of tougher skin along the length of my thumb.
Rowing,3av2ch,acunc,3,Tue Jun 23 19:07:13 2015 UTC,"For someone who has no real knowledge of British university rowing, what is it that makes a crew eligible for the Temple at HRR? Because, at least from what I've seen here, it seems like Oxford Brookes is one of the top crews in the country, so why don't they go for the Ladies Plate? Their crew last year seemed to breeze through the Temple with no real challenge (I know it's not the same crew this year since athletes can't repeat that event)."
Rowing,3av2ch,QueenCitySabre,10,Tue Jun 23 19:14:21 2015 UTC,"I honestly think they raced Temple last year because they wanted a win in an 8. They hadn't had one since 2006 and they probably wouldn't get one in the Ladies. They might have also stacked a 4 for the Albert this year with anyone who won Temple last year, in the hopes of getting 2 wins, but that's just speculation."

Rowing,3av2ch,hullo-reddit,4,Thu Jun 25 15:47:53 2015 UTC,"The Temple puts restrictions on the standards the competing athletes have reached previously. Eg, no previous HRR winners above the junior events, no Oxbridge Blues/UL Purples, no U23 national team members, no winners of the various top US championships.  The aim is to keep the event for students below the top levels, ie the 1V of smaller unis, or JV etc of the bigger ones. The problem is that Brookes can turn out a brand new set of athletes every year who have a realistic chance of the title. I'm not sure I necessarily want to stop them atm. My hunch is that others need to raise their games and any rules aimed at preventing a Brookes dominance would just look arbitrary and unfair."
Rowing,3av2ch,kitd,8,Tue Jun 23 21:31:02 2015 UTC,Brookes don't have anything like the resources of the top US units. Coaching and other support resources are rubbish. They just work their nuts off and have been lucky with athletes over the last couple of years.  All last year's Temple winners have left so they were back to square one this year.  If they do manage back to back wins this year they'll be back in the pack for a while.
Rowing,3av2ch,mekkrage,3,Tue Jun 23 21:54:06 2015 UTC,"Because they're eligible for the temple and they can win it, rather than the ladies that they probably can't.  Pretty simple to me!"

I noticed that some manufacturers allow you to specify dimensions for rigger height, etc. and I figured if I'm going to purchase a personal build, I'd want to configure it to fit my body, but I'm not sure if there are places that let you test different specifications"

Rowing,3awcgn,acunc,2,Thu Jun 25 14:42:47 2015 UTC,"Rowing a 2x as a 1x is a terrible idea. You're not going to be able to carry it, and should you ever flip it you're not likely to be able to flip it back by yourself.   Smaller boats aren't as rugged as big boats, so definitely be aware of that. You can damage a 1x pretty easily if you run into something.   As for building a boat through Vespoli - I would try a few boats out first, get your sculling to be semi-good, then think about purchasing one. For what it's worth Vespoli is not renowned for it's sculling boats."
Rowing,3awcgn,acunc,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:21:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I had a suspicion that rowing a double as a single would be a terrible idea, but I just wanted to know if it's plausible at all.   I'm actually experienced with sculling, as I did a few months of it while I was rowing more regularly. Is there a way to try out boats outside of joining clubs and trying the boats they have?  I have also heard that Vespoli isn't the best manufacturer of single sculls. Do you have any recommendations? What I've researched online seems to say Hudson and Wintech make better single sculls, but I'm not too familiar with other brands."
Rowing,3awcgn,ScaramouchScaramouch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:42:19 2015 UTC,"I think first and foremost it's a matter of ""fit"". It could very well be that a Vespoli fits you and your rowing style best. That being said, there's a reason you don't see anyone rowing a Vespoli 1x at the elite level. That also being said, you're not trying to win the Olympics....  So again, at our level it's mostly a matter of finding a boat that matches your price range and that you feel comfortable in.   As far as demo-ing shells - contact your local rep from Wintech, Hudson, Vespoli, etc. and ask them when they'll be around your area or at a regatta you can go to. Tell them you're looking to buy a boat but want to try it out first (usually called demo'ing in rowing).   You should be able to find out who the local rep is and their contact info. through their website."

My favorite part though is found under lightweight four: "" I am mainly open to taking a four from a single institution, including their coach as an assistant.""

From what I read there's definitely a selection process. Video, coach reccomendations, and previous national/international results, and just because you ""make the erg standard"" doesnt mean you're in.  So your idea of if you pay you get to be on a ""fake national team"" is a crock.  Yes, im sure not all the guys will be quick but from the roster it looks like a really strong group. The point of the University Games Camp two years ago was to get guys international racing experience and development. One of those guys made it to the training center and some of them are still racing, I'd say while the result two years ago wasnt good that it still did its purpose of developing guys for their future rowing careers if they so choose to continue training.   Besides, I'd also point out that there are U23 boats that win trials, sometimes uncontested go, and dont do well. Do you consider them the ""fake national team""? I bet not.

The selection process is for which boat you go in for the priority stack, not whether or not you get to race.   And as for the trials issue, I would actually pay attention the GMS (That little time percentage on herenow). If they aren't within 95% of it, you don't go. A 95% off the GMS is MAYBE an A final appearance. So if I were in charge of USRowing, the only boats I'd send to worlds would be the camp boats. None of the U23 winners were at 95% or better of the GMS. I feel that the uncontested/TT to final trial boats are also ""pay to go"" boats. So yes, also fake national team.   Why people are willing to spend thousands of dollars to row get stomped on internationally for an organization that doesn't care about them escapes me."

Rowing,3at4lh,OARneryRower,2,Tue Jun 23 17:37:47 2015 UTC,"I get your point, and personally a decision like the one the man made doesn't paticularly make me respect him, but I still will respect his right to make that decision. If my grandma died right before a huge race of mine and I chose to go to her funeral rather than the big race does this make me inflexible and unwilling to sacrifice for others? What if we had a shot of winning but now the boat can't do well or even be raced at all? I mean she's dead, so me going to the funeral is really just some form or ritual and spiritual satisfaction to me, not a strictly necessarily thing to do. This sounds really extreme and stupid, but my point is that you simplify have to do make decisions for yourself and at some point you sort out your priorities and nobody's will look the same. It's not right to impose your decisions on others, but it is ok to explain why you made them to others. If you disagree with the message it's not going to be fun to listen to, but the reality is a lot of things are biased in this world and its ok, and even interesting, to hear what others have to say."
Rowing,3at4lh,Agent_Fuzzy_Socks,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"FWIW, there's a big difference between respecting someone's right to make a tough decision, and supporting them in giving a speech saying how proud they were of that decision. Imagine if someone in the audience was in their team? They might have supported them in their decision, but it's a huge slap in the face to then be told that it felt good - it's supposed to be a tough decision."

I would just focus on pulling in high - this is something you can work on while on the erg - keeping both elbows up and parallel with the torso, the hands pulling into the sternum.

Rowing,3atkof,OARneryRower,2,Tue Jun 23 21:55:47 2015 UTC,"A lot of newer scullers think about stacking their hands which pushes the right grip down further than it needs to go. If your hands are stacked, you will generally be offset to port, dig deeper on the drive with the port oar, and struggle to come out square on port side. A fix is to think about the right grip chasing the left. To create space your right knuckles will sit around your left wrist on the recouvery. You will want your right hand to slightly lead the left on the drive. Give it a go... I think it will be a quick fix for a lot of your problems."

Rowing,3aqvxu,jawocha,2,Tue Jun 23 17:10:15 2015 UTC,"That doesn't mean how your body works changes. Maybe extended training in one type of shell will affect where your heart rate falls relative to your lactate, but switching boats does not change that correlation."

Rowing,3aqvxu,Eightplusandunder,2,Mon Jun 22 21:42:51 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't. Lactate levels should correspond with about the same heart rate zone regardless of the boat you're in. Being in a boat with less people has a similar effect to increasing the drag factor on the erg, shouldn't change your training zone. Your heart rate could be affected by different rates depending on what you're comfortable with (my heart rate is usually lowest around a 20, but I know people who do better at 16 or 18), but the lactate levels should change along with it."
Rowing,3aqvxu,determinator007,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:33:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think the zones change, but it's much easier to have a higher HR in a small boat, from my experience.

It really depends on the other members of your club's/university's team at the moment, in regards to boating. Obviously you won't win the openweight women's single at the moment, but if you can be a good bow seat in an 8+ then why not? If you can weigh 67kg and not worry about food and still succeed, that sounds pretty ideal to me. Why struggle to lose those extra 15lbs? Because I'll be honest, losing the weight will not be easy. It won't be impossible, but it's not something you will want to put yourself through unless it's necessary.   I would say just focus on rowing and eating well, and see what happens.

Rowing,3aldl3,stevenson44,3,Sun Jun 21 16:20:55 2015 UTC,"Epic, a fellow Kiwi - now I must make more effort with my post!  Erging is such a mindset activity, you can make it your worst enemy or your best friend, depending on how you view it, some torturous monotonous process or a way in which you can become fitter, faster, etc.   With regards to your actual question, I personally found tracking progress helped immensely, that way you aren't just sitting on there getting tired for an hour or whatever, you might be 1.5% closer to your goal for example, for an hour @ 2:00 towards a million meters. It gives an additional sense of 'purpose' above and beyond just doing it in the hope it will make you fast months down the track. Like this, for example  Also, music. I enjoy nothing more then just cranking away on the erg with speakers pumping my new favourite songs in an empty room knowing that I am making gains, but if that isn't an option, earphones down the back of your singlet (so they don't get caught by the handle etc etc) and a little ipod shuffle does the same, Focus on your favourite tunes and let the meters tick away!   Or if all else fails, spam all your friends with snapchats of your workouts and make them feel shit for not erging as much as you are, bam - now you're accountable."
Rowing,3aldl3,preworkout-then-SS,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:46:39 2015 UTC,Oh yeah its totally just a mindset thing for me. I suppose tracking progress isn't something I've tried in off season. I just usually stay fit by other means if I get sick of erging.  But yes music is needed.

Rowing,3alkcn,Account_Eliminator,12,Sun Jun 21 12:02:29 2015 UTC,"I got beaten a lot in the novice single event at my local regatta last year, in front of family members I got beaten by 8 lengths over a 750m course. It was pretty embarrassing, and I was rowing pretty badly for someone who had been rowing on and off for five years by that point.  After a year of training, and working hard to get rid of all my bad habits from 5 previous years of uncoached leisure rowing namely opening up off the catch amongst other novice/ uncoached rower problems, namely with the help of the club coach. Also I've dropped fat from 86kg to 79kg, and put on some decent muscle mass.  The semi final: I sculled against two other guys, we rowed up to the top of the lake together and I could tell they weren't very good, well the older guy seemed steady but not fast at all, the young university guy was zig zagging which is never a good sign. I smashed them both off the start, then chilled out relaxed and rowed it in infront of my family my friends, and fellow club mates all cheering me on. Felt so good, even managed to have a bit of banter with people on the side after I won, before turning around and sculling it back up the lake again. (internally I was wary of the other semi final winner having too much time to recover).  Got up the start for the final, and I didn't get away from him after the start, and he kept right with me for 600m. Internally I just calmed myself down, and though ""I can keep doing what I'm doing, I just need to hope he can't"". Then I upped the rate for the last 50m probably from about 30 back up to 34 and finall, finally, got half a boat on him, and felt I had it won.  I got a giant trophy for it, (it's in memory of someone), which is currently on the table next to me as I write. It embodies a year of training and taking rowing more seriously, and it's one of my favourite accomplishments in life."

Rowing,3akti6,RowingRelated,3,Sun Jun 21 04:31:18 2015 UTC,"Whatever rate you are most comfortable at will work.  I've done 6 marathons, all were around a 22 rate.  That worked better for me than going lower.  I mentally broke the piece up into 4x10k + 2195m - never stopped, but pushed through each block, then gave myself a few easier strokes to 'rest' afterwards.  The 4th 10k was by far the hardest.  The most important part though is proper preparation.  Carefully select your clothing so you don't chafe.  You can also put a little vaseline or other lube on any parts that rub - back of knee, armpit, inside of elbow, etc...  My upper arms and knees rub slightly when I'm erging.  Normally not even noticeable, but the first marathon I did,  I ran out of sweat and got crusty with salt, which then rubbed all the hair off the sides of my knees.  Was not fun.  Another time, I was wearing a tank that rubbed the inside of my armpit a bit - ended up being painful, red and swollen by the end.    You should also eat and drink during the marathon, it helps tremendously.  On my best one, I had 2 full water bottles, and a large gatorade to drink during the piece.  I also cut up a couple power bars into bite sized chunks that were easy to snack on while rowing."

Rowing,3akti6,anerdson,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:17:13 2015 UTC,"I did an erg marathon over winter break with some teammates. I stayed around a 22, but the men were usually at a 24. Getting the wheel spinning a bit more than steady state will be a lot easier than muscling it out every stroke. It's like an oar circuit with light weight, high reps - sure, a higher split than steady state feels easy at first, but even at the one hour mark you'll still have a long way to go. To break it up mentally I started out by pulling 10K straight, then 2x5K, then 2K on 30"" off 3K on 30"" until the home stretch. Make sure you have plenty of water and fruit handy for the rests!"
Rowing,3akti6,BonaFideFaith,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:02:10 2015 UTC,"When I did mine, my average split ended up being steady state +1-2.  My average rating was around a 22.  Going into it, I had a plan for the splits I wanted to hit, but I didn't plan a rating.  The 22 just ended up being the best option for me to keep hitting my desired split for about 3 hours.  It felt ridiculously easy for the first 20k or so, but then the fatigue started to set in.  Make sure you eat a lot beforehand and give yourself plenty of time to digest before you start.  You will get hungry and thirsty during the piece, so I'd suggest setting up a little table with electrolyte drinks and some cut up power bars or shot blocks.  During mine, I would quickly grab what I needed for a few seconds and then take a few hard strokes to get back into it.  And yes- like people have said, definitely have something like a folded up towel to sit on."

Rowing,3akti6,majaspl,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:52:54 2015 UTC,"If you want to go straight through, I would recommend 20-24 at firm steady state pressure for your first try (you can always do it again buy you are less likely to if you bail/fail on your first go). It is helpful if, for example, you alternate rates for 2-4km pieces without stopping or if you treat it like a giant power pyramid 6-5-4-3-2-1-2-3-4-5-6 and then whatever it takes to get over the line. I liked this last approach best and i did undulating rates, going up and down depending on what my body needed. Ps. Lube up your upper thigh/lower ass with some of the slick stick you can use for running... Ass chafe is no joke."
Rowing,3akti6,OARneryRower,3,Sun Jun 21 11:21:35 2015 UTC,"Along those lines, you may want to try using a seat pad or a thin towel - your ass is going to hurt big time.

Rowing,3ai9h5,SackNicholson,8,Tue Jun 30 20:55:22 2015 UTC,"Calories burned is a function of intensity (HR) and duration of workout. The higher the intensity, the more calories you burn; the longer you work out for, the more calories you burn.  Therefore if your primary focus is calorie burning, you should do long workouts at the fastest pace you can hold for that length of time."
Rowing,3ai9h5,acunc,3,Sat Jun 20 15:16:31 2015 UTC,"I find no matter what workout I do, I end up burning around the same amount of calories each session. This is assuming you do full, proper workouts. Obviously a long session of steady state will burn more calories because you'll be erging for longer than a 2k, but you have to keep in mind how much you're exerting yourself during the rest periods of an interval workout and whether your HR is elevated above the norm after you're done exercising.   If I do an hour of steady state, then my HR is around 150 for that hour, without any warm-up or cool-down. If I do something like 6x500m with 3' rest in between, then I have 6 work periods lasting about 1:50 (totalling 11') where my HR is around 170-180, then 18' of rest where my HR is about 130 (paddle during the rest). Also, higher intensity workouts require a warm-up and at least a short cool-down, so there's about 15' where my HR is ~140. In all, I'd end up burning ~100 cals more during the SS workout, but I would also be on the erg for ~15' longer.   Don't worry so much about burning calories during your training, just do the training you think will best benefit your performance."

Rowing,3aivat,tokepair,2,Sat Jun 20 17:41:19 2015 UTC,"Adding to this, it should be ok to do a comparable time e.g. 40 min bike instead of 40 min erg. If you can keep HR the same they should give the same cardio workout."
Rowing,3aivat,irrelevantPseudonym,2,Tue Jun 23 13:05:16 2015 UTC,"I would compare biking time to erging time instead of distance. The most comparable workout on the bike is an equivalent time at the same rate of perceived exertion. The bike is better than nothing, but it's no substitute for the erg or getting in a boat."
Rowing,3aivat,handsNfeetRmangos,5,Sat Jun 20 21:43:31 2015 UTC,"The bike is actually a really great substitute for getting on the erg. It uses the same main muscle group in a very similar way (quads, glutes etc.), but with a much higher RPM, therefore more contractions of the muscle. It doesn't put as much stress on the upper body, and therefore is really good for managing upper body injuries (which it seems OP is at risk of). It's also a great aerobic fitness tool, because it's much more achievable to go for a 3 hour cycle, than a three hour row; a lower perceived rate of exertion, but  comparable fitness gains, making it easier to increase overall volume. I'm not saying to complete replace erging with cycling, but it is definitely an effective training method.  Someone please give me a sales job already."
Rowing,3aivat,coxcoxcox,0,Sun Jun 21 09:48:03 2015 UTC,"Biking mainly targets your quads, while rowing also targets hamstrings, back, core, and biceps. So rowing a 10k can be considerably harder than biking 10k. A better measure would be to try to maintain the same target heart rate range on the bike as you would on the erg. For example--say you do a 10k on the erg in 40 minutes, holding a HR between 155 and 170 bpm. You would get the same workout by biking for 40 minutes at an intensity that forces you into that same heart rate range.  Depends on the work you do. I find that working out daily with one rest day is a good way to challenge yourself but also avoid overtraining.  Erging is a low impact exercise. I would say be careful mostly of knee and lower back pain. Make sure you stretch for 8-10 minutes after every erg session, as flexibility is key to maximizing stroke length.    Hope this helped!"
Rowing,3aivat,Bert_is_the_word,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:25:46 2015 UTC,"I would also say cycling (with feet strapped in) required greater use of the hamstrings than rowing. You definitely use them in rowing, but they're not one of the main muscles. Cycling is much lower impact. I haven't really heard of many rowing-related knee injuries (the impact isn't really on your knees?) but back, rib and shoulder injuries are fairly common."
Rowing,3aivat,coxcoxcox,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:58:53 2015 UTC,"I actually meant biceps. Pulling exercises target the lats and biceps, while pushing exercises (I.e benching) targets the chest and the triceps."

Rowing,3agqsl,tokepair,9,Sat Jun 20 00:54:12 2015 UTC,Having connections with the national team and gaining the experience of training at the national level (and observing the coaches at that level) will no doubt be of great help. I'd recommend checking out the bios of the coaches at the colleges and clubs you'd like to coach. See what path they took to get where they are.  Good luck!!
Rowing,3agqsl,dansad,4,Sat Jun 20 05:03:45 2015 UTC,Training for a national team is such a physically and emotionally consuming pursuit that I wouldn't recommend undertaking it for anything other than the reward of competing at that level.
Rowing,3agqsl,squarebladesfeetout,3,Sat Jun 20 23:30:28 2015 UTC,"As someone else said, elite level rowing doesn't make you a good coach, but it does give you a good understanding of what it takes to succeed (fitness, technique, mentality).  Lots of good coaches weren't elite rowers, but they would have a decent level of rowing experience... at least 5+ years I'd say. You also can't go straight into being a head coach, you need to go through the ranks. I would start coaching HS crews, but simultaneously volunteer at a higher level, e.g. collegiate. Find a coach you admire and shadow them for some sessions. Focus on becoming a good coach, because coaching is a constant process, not just an end goal, and you have to do your best at every point in time in order to get to that level.  I coach and cox (but am at a much higher level at coxing), and I am always thinking of what I like and dislike in my coaches, and then carrying that into my own coaching. I take note of the drills they use, their technical models, their coaching styles..."
Rowing,3agqsl,coxcoxcox,3,Sun Jun 21 09:22:37 2015 UTC,"In my experience, athletes who have performed at an elite level themselves are looked on favourably when it comes to coaching. It's a good line to have on your CV. And training at an elite level as a rower will expose you to more of the finer points of rowing physiology, technique, etc.  On the other hand, there's no guarantee that it will make you a good coach. Understanding what to do and conveying it to others is 2 completely separate skills. I think good coaching is about communication and managing group dynamics. You don't learn that stuff by rowing, only by getting in and coaching.  And you don't simply land a head coaching job. You start low down and work your way up by proving your ability, getting results, and making connections."
Rowing,3agqsl,morpen8,3,Sat Jun 20 04:23:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sure credentials wouldn't hurt at all, but think of it this way. What if you started out coaching juniors for a few solid seasons and developed a track record that way? Then you could advance up the ladder to perhaps collegiate or whatever level you want to go to?"
Rowing,3agqsl,Doctorje24,2,Sat Jun 20 04:08:42 2015 UTC,"As someone with similar aspirations, I've found a couple of things.    Connections are key, so rowing for a long time helps in a big way with that. The more people you row with/for makes a big difference. This also helps expose you to many different coaching styles which can help you synthesize your own philosophy.  Coaching jobs are hard to get, good ones at least. If college coaching is your dream, then you're joing to have to pay your dues for a while. A lot of college coaches start as volunteers for a college program. You might have to suck it up for a couple years and do that. Alternatively you can start with junior programs and try to leverage that succes into a college job, this may be harder to do though.  There is the coaching education program at CRI in Boston. I know a couple of people who have done it and have gotten jobs afterwards. I think at this point though it's unproven and still not 100% useful. But it's probably worth looking into at least.    Hope this helps."

Rowing,3adfk3,avo_cado,3,Fri Jun 19 12:49:46 2015 UTC,My coach didnt give me the Pete plan to follow last winter break but instead gave us her mix of the Wolverine plan and some other workouts. I followed this plan for about 2 months and managed to shed around 10 seconds off my 2k. Granted I wasn't insanely fast before but I had a decent time. I would guess the Pete plan is similar and would have great results as long as you follow it accurately and don't skip workouts. The more you put in the more you get out I guess.
Rowing,3adfk3,BenW17,3,Fri Jun 19 14:25:52 2015 UTC,"It's a really good framework for training. Over time you may tweak parts of it depending on your age/physique/work ethic, but it gives you a really solid outline of what a good training plan should look like.  As far as results, you get out what you put in. As long as you follow The Pete Plan honestly and earnestly, putting in quality meters and supplementing with plenty of sleep and good nutrition, you'll get great results."

Rowing,3adfk3,rbkillea,2,Fri Jun 19 16:18:17 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt anyone has done a proper scientific study of the Pete plan. The thing about rowing is that there is no real secret to what makes people fast -- one part natural talent & lots of hard work. People want a definitive answer to ""how can I drop my 2k"" and ""train more, train harder"" isn't sufficiently specific so pre-fabbed plans are suggested. A big part of this is just that writing a training plan is a lot of work and most people on this board who are qualified to do so (those of us with lots of years of rowing experience and at least a level 2 coaching certification) aren't going to write one from scratch for every person asking how to shave a minute off their erg score. Ergo: Pete Plan and other pre-written plans are suggested because they give structure and don't require any work from the person making the suggestion. Could they be improved upon? Of course! Personalized plans will always be better as no two athletes respond the same way to the same stimulus."
Rowing,3adfk3,OARneryRower,3,Fri Jun 19 14:25:54 2015 UTC,"You know this already, but just in case others don't- the Level 2 Qualification (UKCC one at least) does very little to directly guarantee that your coach knows the sport, the stroke and how to push the human body to get results. It does however guarantee they know how to safeguard children, address emergencies such as injury or capsizing. As BR puts near the top of the info page- 'The Level 2 Certificate in Coaching Rowing is the first award for coaching individuals on the water and is aimed at beginner coaches.'  However, any coach with qualification should more likely than not be given hefty credit- the course is ridiculously hard to complete, the difficulty being either the price (£425) or availability for the required four day session. In short, if a coach has it, you know they're very committed to coach either semi or fully professionally."
Rowing,3adfk3,Wazulu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:47:45 2015 UTC,"Certainly I am not implying that a coaching certification implies a person is qualified. In Canada, level 2 is the first cert level where you actually study program development. Maybe it is the fact that I am a graduate student but I believe some level of scientific study is necessary above and beyond practical experience with program development. The best programs I have trained under were written by coaches with practical and academic experience."
Rowing,3adfk3,OARneryRower,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:55:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not remotely suggesting you're not qualified, but having a coaching certification means squat as far as someone's ability to write a good (rowing) training plan.  As /u/wazulu said, there's many coaches out there with a certification that don't know much about the actual science behind a training plan. Conversely, there are many extremely qualified people without a coaching certificate who have the knowledge/experience to write a good plan."

Rowing,3abvwm,bud_city,11,Sat Jun 20 16:03:04 2015 UTC,It's arguably stylistic. But if they're closer you could technically apply more power since both hands are closer to the end of the lever.

"" Dr. Fritz Hagerman, an exercise physiologist at Ohio University, said he had learned from more than three decades of studying world class rowers that the whole idea of a formula to predict an individual's maximum heart rate was ludicrous. Even sillier, he said, is the common notion that the heart rate is an indication of fitness.   Some people get blood to their muscles by pushing out large amounts every time their hearts contract, he said. Others accomplish the same thing by contracting their hearts at fast rates. As a result, Dr. Hagerman said, he has seen Olympic rowers in their 20's with maximum heart rates of 220. And he has seen others on the same team and with the same ability, but who get blood to their tissues by pumping hard, with maximum rates of just 160.   ''The heart rate is probably the least important variable in comparing athletes,'' Dr. Hagerman said. ""  Dr. Fritz Hagerman was the doctor for the US national team. One of the kids I coach told me he hit 224 rowing this past year.  I had heard when you are younger your heart rate may be higher as the heart may not have reached full size."

Rowing,3adm9m,petersculls,3,Fri Jun 19 08:45:34 2015 UTC,It could be your heart growth has not kept up with the growth of your body so it pumps quick to get out the blood volume needed during exercise.  I know a rower where the doctors brought his heart rate up to 292 to test it. They used chemicals to make the heart rate go up while he was under. That was as high as they dared to go. It did not fail.

Rowing,3adm9m,Jwillsking,3,Sun Jun 21 03:03:50 2015 UTC,"Welcome to rowing. Also, the base maximum target heart rate for your age is around 200-210, so 220 for a few minutes shouldn't kill you or be anything worrying. Keep an eye on it obviously but don't worry"

Rowing,3aa5fh,scrubbucket12,6,Thu Jun 18 13:15:29 2015 UTC,The PA is massive this year
Rowing,3aa5fh,IKnoUrRedditUsername,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:22:39 2015 UTC,How big was it last year Andrew?
Rowing,3aa5fh,SazedStreams,4,Sat Jun 20 09:12:26 2015 UTC,"With the increasing interest in the PA I think the Stewards need to seriously think of increasing the number of available spots. Saying that its going to be a very expensive trip for some people with potentially 6-8 crews prequalifying (Edinburgh, Brookes, Imperial, Newcastle, Washington, Harvard, Cal Berkley, maybe Yale) are the ones I guessing leaving very few spots left open."
Rowing,3aa5fh,SazedStreams,3,Thu Jun 18 21:08:38 2015 UTC,Not certain where you find the extra spaces - maybe you could take 8 from the wyfold. Given that we regularly see schoolboy second eights in the temple though I think the qualification standard to get into the student events is about right - the rising interest in the PA has just been because it's been significantly easier for UK crews to win for years compared to the Temple - the irony being that I will bet the house on Washington taking it whilst potentially someone like cornell could overturn Brookes in the Temple.
Rowing,3aa5fh,BenW1994,3,Fri Jun 19 05:00:37 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't count out the likes Edinburgh, Brookes or Imperial for contention they were scary quick for a 4+ at met and with marlow this weekend will be interesting to see what 3 weeks have done to their speed. In terms of the Temple I just think Brookes are just too fast again this year for anyone to get that close to them given the entry list."
Rowing,3aa5fh,DUMBGENIU5,2,Fri Jun 19 07:49:03 2015 UTC,"Last year Cornell LW lost to Brookes by 1/2 a length, they were 2nd fastest. But this year they've mixed HW + LW, or so I've heard, and they want to win. I'll be interested to see what happens."

Rowing,3aa5fh,hrr150,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:24:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think it should be any bigger. The PA is open to any academic institution, which a large percentage of Henley crews are. It has always been a type of ""JV"" race for a lot of crews for this reason. Take this year: Phillips Andover, Gonzaga HS, BC High, and Salisbury school all have entries. Why? They are all competing for the Princess Elizabeth, that's their real event. These entries are their spares, guys from their JV boat. Now they're competing against guys from Harvard's JV, and UW, Yale and Cornell's JV (or possibly lightweights). If any of the aforementioned high school crews qualify, it would be miraculous. They are filled with spares, and possibly 1 or 2 kids who are too old to meet the schoolboy requirement. But by entering them in the regatta, these spares have a compelling reason to train hard for the month between the end of the high school season and Henley. Now sure it would be fun for them to race, but should an event really be opened up so you can watch the Harvard JV smash some high school 4 to bits? Probably not.   I was one of these high school spares a few years ago, it was a fun trip, and we lined up for the qualifying time trial with Harvard B in front of us and Goldie (essentially Cambridge's 2nd boat) right behind us. We didn't have a chance. But we rowed hard and had fun. So that's why I say don't expand the PA, you'd let in too many spares and second rate crews."

See the bottom of this page.  In all other cases, alumni clubs are just clubs and HRR don't treat them differently.  If you have any doubts about any of the crew members in the club events being imported students, notify the Steward's."

Rowing,3aa5fh,DUMBGENIU5,2,Thu Jun 18 14:39:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, this was not aimed at stamping out alumni crews though.   I am not strongly for or against the alumni school/university crews in the Thames, on the one hand I think it makes the racing better as these crews are often very quick and on what grounds should they be excluded? On the other hand it must be an extremely bitter pill for the clubs to swallow after a year of slogging through winter training, up and down the country to regattas to finally get beaten by a bunch of lads seemingly out for a laugh.  I was merely pointing out that the stewards have not brought in any laws banning them despite what I imagine must have been huge pressure after Griffen won two years ago"
Rowing,3aa5fh,rowerldn,2,Thu Jun 18 16:00:22 2015 UTC,"The rule clarification was to ensure that alumni crews that were in the Thames were in the spirit of the event and clarify, given that all three club events went to alumni clubs that year, one of which was pretty much like a normal club crew (Tyrian, it's an open club) one of which was borderline (Griffen, as they had all gone to Abingdon but several had been rowing in the states that year) and one of which ran a pantechnicon through the loophole (the ringertastic bunch of guys who hadn't heard of Taurus until about 3 months before the event).  The pressure was in part from the Griffen boat, but I'd argue Taurus were mostly to blame for putting in a crew which I think I'm right in saying wouldn't have been eligible for the PA (if composites were allowed) due to it containing hwt varsity oarsmen."
Rowing,3aa5fh,DUMBGENIU5,2,Thu Jun 18 16:56:48 2015 UTC,"I may be missing something, but don't we actually have less than last year (Nonesuch, Sabrina and Ursus compared to Nemesis, Nonesuch, Griffen and Warwick Uni Grad Assoc last year)?"

Admittedly there's more of them in the brit and wyfronts this year - although some of them are beginning to pop up elsewhere on the regatta circuit and in the head season.

Rowing,3aa5fh,tikimanify,2,Thu Jun 18 14:05:51 2015 UTC,"It was openly stated by Abingdon that the Griffen boat that won the Thames  had only been training together for a couple of weeks prior to Henley. All those guys were part of the Abingdon crews that won the PE for the 2 years prior and no doubt will have been training and racing elsewhere all year round yet they are allowed to enter, it's a joke."
Rowing,3aa5fh,frt6354,2,Thu Jun 18 14:29:45 2015 UTC,"And since then the stewards have made clear that another crew like that (full of students who've rowed for their unis) would almost certainly get bumped to the Ladies.

Rowing,3aa5fh,tikimanify,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:34:32 2015 UTC,"That was 2 years ago and the rules have been tightened.  The fact it's an alumni club isn't the issue. You can't just point to clubs names on a list and say ""it's a joke"". The Steward's consider alumni clubs to be perfectly normal clubs.   It's the make-up of the crew that is their concern, and as I have been repeating here ad nauseam, they have tightened up on who they consider to be eligible members, with last-minute imported students being unwelcome."

Maybe go to gym and do some erging if they have an erg or a run if the option is available, but one week on holiday enjoying yourself will have a far better impact on you than trying to train twice a day in the middle of winter.

Also, make sure you keep a stroke rate that you can maintain throughout the piece - not too high but also not too low.

When you do interval/high intensity workouts force yourself to row them at high rates. Do pyramids of 26/28/30/32 and back down, or something similar.

Rowing,3aak7b,zknarc,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:45:23 2015 UTC,"I used to have terrible ankle flexibility, combined with over-compressing at the catch. I would try to squeeze further forward, my heels would lift far off the foot plates, and my shins would be angled forward rather than straight up and down.  This meant that all the force at the start of the drive went straight to the balls of my feet rather than the heels, and my shins would take the brunt of the punishment rather than the quads. I would have sore ankles and shins after every workout.  Keeping your shins vertical at the catch and driving fully off the heels puts all the power load on your quads and heels, which makes driving quicker, and therefore rating higher, much easier.  Simple stretches like deep body weight squats (keeping feet straight, heels planted flat) were great to improve my ankle flexibility.  In general, while rating higher on the erg, speed up your movements at key points. Keep the aggressive, quick, immediate drive right when you hit the catch; this will keep the flywheel spinning and make it easier to maintain the rate. Quickening the hands helps as well, finish quick into your body and quick hands away, although not just throwing them away and letting it rush the rest of your recovery."

Rowing,3a7prp,iPwnForYou,6,Wed Jun 17 21:50:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, your HR will vary based on numerous factors. Such as hydration, stress (not physiological, but like anxiety), how hot it is, medications, etc. I personally train with my HR monitor and notice fluctuations in my splits depending on how hydrated I am, how I slept the night before, and how hungry I am. The goal of HR training is to stay in the range. Don't focus on the split (but I'd record it or meters so you have something to measure your daily improvement), and stay hydrated!"
Rowing,3a7prp,Vespoli151,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:06:07 2015 UTC,"Can you give a little more detail on what affects your heart rate and more specifically how it affects it? I'm guessing a good nights sleep and hydration make your heart rate lower but not sure about hunger. Id like to be able to pull as hard as I can with being in the heart rate zone to get the most benefit out of it, so knowing all the details from someone that has more experience with a HR monitor would be great."
Rowing,3a7prp,acunc,3,Thu Jun 18 02:19:26 2015 UTC,"The biggest factors that will negatively affect your HR (i.e. make it higher) are temperature and hydration level. If you want to keep your HR as low as possible at a given intensity then (a) erg somewhere cool (b) use some fans (c) hydrate well throughout the day, everyday.   Even then there will be slight variations in your HR, but they shouldn't be huge. My HR is almost always around 140 bpm during SS give or take a beat or two. My resting HR is 40 bpm and my max is 192 bpm."
Rowing,3a7prp,Vespoli151,2,Thu Jun 18 12:16:10 2015 UTC,^ what he said. That's basically the two big factors. Heat and hydration are the easiest to control in session. Drink during your workouts (10s to take a sip won't kill your HR or split for a long row) and wear light clothes when you can't control the temperature.

Rowing,3a5ne2,powertenz,15,Wed Jun 17 12:36:11 2015 UTC,"Its a combination of a lot of things, including coaching. You are not going to win or make A final without good coaching but there are a few other aspects. Having a continually good recruitment of novices with potential is vital for sustained success. Having a good team culture is also vital. And coaching is not important just for the top 8 or top boat, its important to have a good set of coaches from novice all the way up that coach the same stroke. And really the history of success oddly enough helps too. Nobody wants to be the year that drops the ball and doesn't do well. It also helps that all of those teams you mention race really top notch crews in close races throughout the year.   I know thats a jumbled paragraph but really it all needs to come together to have a winning season."
Rowing,3a5ne2,rowrowawayaway,6,Wed Jun 17 12:48:55 2015 UTC,"Well-said. It really comes down to consistent coaching, culture, and recruiting. These teams are also in rowing hot-beds. New England, northwest, west coast are all just teeming with great young rowers. And they will flock to the clubs with histories of success.  Once there, it's all about keeping everyone on the same page, and making sure everyone buys into the mentality that winning a championship is the goal and nothing else will do."
Rowing,3a5ne2,Socialist_Bassoon,5,Wed Jun 17 13:12:18 2015 UTC,"I would also think that having a large reach/good advertising (which comes from the things you discussed) is also very important. If you can advertise enough to get the best people you can, then that will help a lot."

Rowing,3a5ne2,acunc,11,Wed Jun 17 18:58:38 2015 UTC,"Culture Coaching Resources Athletes   Once you build a culture of success, it takes a lot to stop being successful. Just look at the college ranks - UW breeds a culture of winning - they win with different coaches, different athletes, across different events (V8, 2V8, 3V8, F8, V4). Culture is by far the most important thing.  Having nice equipment, a good coach, and good talent is also necessary and important but nothing beats culture."
Rowing,3a5ne2,sherman1864,9,Wed Jun 17 13:11:55 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that recruiting athletes is actually #1 most important for success.  Doesn't matter how good your coaching/equipment is if you don't have the right athletes.  As for culture, I've seen lots of differences in culture at different levels that are all successful, and wildly different.  Some commonalities are present, but again, without good enough athletes, it doesn't matter."
Rowing,3a5ne2,acunc,3,Wed Jun 17 16:00:02 2015 UTC,"We're talking high school here (at least the OP did) - the ""talent"" of your athletes coming into the program doesn't matter as much. Even in college you can be very quick with walk-ons (Wisco anyone? or Michigan/UVa?).  I think I should clarify what I mean by culture: not just how the people behave or the kinds of personalities or how people get along. Rather, a culture of working hard, winning, being fast. If you row at a club where going sub 7:00 is fast, you're not going to win. But if with time the standard for speed at that club becomes sub 6:20, now you changed the culture and changed the expectations."
Rowing,3a5ne2,sherman1864,2,Wed Jun 17 16:36:33 2015 UTC,"I don't mean recruiting rowers, I mean recruiting ATHLETES.  Most people never rowed before 9th grade (maybe a camp).    However, there is a massive difference in the kids you can be recruiting.  Have they ever done competitive sports before?  Is this their first sport?  How tall are they?  How much do they weigh?  Were their parents athletic?  The successful programs are consistently recruiting kids who have the potential to pull 6:20.  Just having a culture of 6:20 being the goal, does not make it possible.  Not even close.    Kids come in a huge range of sizes and abilities.  While I believe many people can become good rowers given time and effort, to get there in 3-4 years during HS requires good genetics and a good background.  Again, your coaches/culture/equipment doesn't matter at all if you aren't consistently recruiting 9th graders who have an athletic background, have decent size and a good work ethic."
Rowing,3a5ne2,tikimanify,6,Wed Jun 17 21:33:37 2015 UTC,"how my friend explained it to me was, a major part of why those crew do so well is that they have large areas to recruit from with no competition, except for SRC. While a crew like Oakland has all of Oakland to draw from, crews from Seattle for example, have to deal with competition from 4+ crews just within the Seattle area.  that's just how my friend explained it to me though, so don't take my word for it."

And they are on opposite sides of the bay.   If you're saying Marin is that close, then add in NorCal, Pacific, Stanford, St. Ignatious, Palo Alto who are also bay area teams."
Rowing,3a5ne2,pullhardgofast,3,Wed Jun 17 19:56:29 2015 UTC,"Several athletes from Strokes, and 2 from the 1v that just won, travel over 40 minutes to get to practice.

Rowing,3a5ne2,solonggehboy,2,Wed Jun 17 21:05:41 2015 UTC,"Do they pass any other sub par teams on their way to the boathouse? Or is it because that is the closest?   I understand they might pass Artemis, Tech, etc. But they are on the same water.   If they are coming from East Alameda area, it's 40 minutes but thats because there are no clubs there."
Rowing,3a5ne2,NeverNervous1,2,Wed Jun 17 21:31:13 2015 UTC,"whoa, whoa, whoa,  let's pull back on the ""sub par"" terminology.  Yes, Oakland and Marin usually sends strong 8s and 4s to Nationals but there are a ton of good clubs in the area.  Stanford sent 5 entries, Berkeley sent 4 entries, Norcal sent 3 entries (won MLwt8), Pacific sent 2 entries, and Artemis sent 1 entry.  One could argue that Stanford is on the cusp of being the sculling equivalent to Seattle in the SW region. Artemis is only 4 yrs old and has 70 rowers.  Norcal is pretty big as well.  I think you will see these other teams drawing tons of talent and all it takes is a few years of good results (like Stanford) and all of a sudden you are on the map as a ""power""."
Rowing,3a5ne2,solonggehboy,2,Fri Jun 19 18:03:04 2015 UTC,"True.. I wasn't trying to bash on the teams speed or success by any means. They are very competitive in their fields. Speaking from a fully run organization aspect. Coaching, funding, equipment, boathouse, etc."

Rowing,3a4ukc,sierra448,4,Wed Jun 17 08:18:55 2015 UTC,"It depends on the rowers in it. Basically, if you aren't sure if you need to bucket rig, you don't need to bucket rig"
Rowing,3a4ukc,Pointwest418,4,Wed Jun 17 08:05:17 2015 UTC,"The underlying theory behind bucket rigging is that people farther to bow have more turning power. The most common bucket rig I've seen is PSSP in fours; with that rig, the ports have more turning power than the starboards in bow pair but the starboards have more in stern pair, so the boat goes straight. However the most important factor is where power lies, because that's the biggest factor in turnint. Last year a girls eight on my team did a bucket like this; PSPSPPSS since the ports were much more powerful than the starboards in bow four and their coach was not a huge supporter of switching sides. And then there's the ""battleship"" rig which is an animal of its own which I never really understood.  As far as cons go, the only ones I can think of are readjusting the rigging (which I don't think is easy, given the very precise nature of how riggers are built) and figuring out how you want to do the bucket to achieve whatever you want (the PSPSPPSS rig I saw last year was not the first bucket rig they tried)."
Rowing,3a4ukc,eitheroar27,2,Wed Jun 17 11:27:46 2015 UTC,"I've been told a few times that 4s that are bucket rigged are faster because they go straighter? But if this is the case then why aren't more of them bucket rigged... I'm still skeptical that this is ""the reason"" for bucket rigging. My experience has been sometimes it just works better with the rowers, with balancing strengths or weights across the boat.   We had an eight that always got pulled around to starboard in starts, so we bucket rigged 7 and 6 seat together on port side, so bow would be starboard and help even that out. Seemed to help."
Rowing,3a4ukc,fecklessreckless,3,Wed Jun 17 09:03:15 2015 UTC,"'Straighter' isn't really the right word. The theory behind this though (someone else posted the link), is about minimizing boat 'wiggle'. It's a really interesting read, but not really practical. In reality, the main reasons for bucket rigging are to get certain people in certain seats (e.g. the lightest person in bow) or to get two people to match up really closely."
Rowing,3a4ukc,coxcoxcox,3,Wed Jun 17 09:47:43 2015 UTC,The centre of effort for each side in more matched but like you say the differences between crew members are far greater. Our 4+ is bucket rigged so that the best person for bow can be at bow (he only rows stroke side).
Rowing,3a4ukc,zknarc,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:50:30 2015 UTC,"Ah yes okay - that makes a lot more sense to match the rigging to the human aspect of the boat instead of trying to improve the path through the water.

Rowing,3a2ktl,MightyLighty,3,Tue Jun 16 19:01:02 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert on power curves, but I'm pretty sure to get a power curve that looks like a reflected version of the Adam style, you would have to not be driving hard enough with the legs. The trunk and arms just can't provide that much force. A stroke that focuses more on the finish would look more like DDR or Rosenberg style. I'm not sure it's really possible to feel it out in the right way on an erg, just because of the way its resistance works; I could be wrong on that, though."
Rowing,3a2ktl,vis9000,3,Tue Jun 16 19:16:50 2015 UTC,"One thing I have noticed when going from a bigger boat to a single is that you can apply much more useful power (or at the very least more noticeable) through the middle of the drive, rather than right at the catch.  For example, in a collegiate 8+, we are taught a VERY catch-heavy stroke. Very aggressive, lots of backsplash, very aggressive on the front end with most of the power coming from the catch to the middle of the drive.  In a single, this kind of aggressive catch has the potential to hurt you much more. With a more relaxed, scooping catch, try to over-emphasize driving harder from the middle of the leg drive to the point where your knees drop, then finish through aggressively but relaxed to your body.  It's a difficult thing to put into an explanation, but just think of it as not sacrificing an all-around smooth, powerful drive but rather emphasizing power at a different part of the stroke: Think squeeze through the middle-to-end of the drive."
Rowing,3a2ktl,acunc,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"Actually, a ""catch-heavy"" stroke is most efficient. The most efficient part of the stroke, due to the angle of the oar blade in the water, is at the catch. At the middle of the drive, when the oar is perpendicular to the boat, you're the least efficient.  Valerie Kleshnev has some pretty technical articles on this on his website.  http://www.biorow.com/"
Rowing,3a2ktl,kitd,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:56:17 2015 UTC,"If you're talking purely about efficiency (energy out/energy in), then you're absolutely right. It becomes more nuanced though when you take the rowers biomechanics into account.  Singles accelerate much more slowly than big boats, and trying to jump on oars at the catch which aren't moving in response means that a greater part of your effort is being spent in a biomechanically weak position. You do need to apply power at the catch but it is much easier to overdo it in a single than a 4x.  It's a difficult thing to judge and depends a lot on the athlete."
Rowing,3a2ktl,Mighty_Ben,3,Thu Jun 18 11:09:03 2015 UTC,"You want a front loaded power curve (see this: http://www.biorow.com/RBN_en_2006_files/2006RowBiomNews06.pdf), as much as you can get away with. That last part of the statement is why it changes with boat size.  I smaller boat has more comparative inertia compared to size of the blade(s) face(s) in the water. If you front load your power curve too much, you rip through the water, wasting energy.   As a result in a 1x you need to be a bit more gentle with the power application at the start, but as long as you're not ripping through the water, you still want want it front loaded.  The only caveat I personally find (I can't find anything to back this up, I'm assuming because it's hard to model) is that a stronger finish to the stroke helps reduce bouncing the bows deeper into the water.  Feet out erging might help with that."
Rowing,3a2ktl,eitheroar27,2,Wed Jun 17 10:49:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about the power curve--I've rowed with it but never looked at it as separate to different boat classes--but I agree that less catch emphasis is important. I was in a very similar situation a few weeks ago, where I'd been in a quad all season, hopped into a 1x for a local race, and it was a disaster. My coaches advised me to concentrate on the finish, and finesse the catch. You can't blast off the catch in the 1x like in a 4x because it has less momentum and thus less stability. Instead, it's better to really start to push once you're past half slide (and the hands start to come together) and you get some stability derived from having your blades locked. Once the hands start to separate again I would once again focus on connection rather than power; you have to come out cleanly so that you have set on the recovery. Don't rush it, focus on tapping down with your wrists. You can't rip the blade out like you sonetimes can in a 4x; the boat has less momentum and you'll wreck your set.  Basically, keep the entries and exits clean. It's hard to apply power without a stable platform to apply it from, and if you can make your entries and exits without disrupting the boat it gets easier."
Rowing,3a2ktl,onya_moatey,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:27:31 2015 UTC,"peoples power curves generally stay the same no matter what boat they are in. The feeling of being ""catch heavy"" in a bigger boat is mostly due to the boat moving faster, so you need to have faster movements around the front turn."
Rowing,3a2ktl,SidViciious,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:41:15 2015 UTC,"Couple of things I try to get my crews to think about in order to achieve a finish heavy stroke   Zero pressure catches -- Gently. Like you treat your girlfriend Flex/bend on the blades -- most blades have a little bit of give in them as you load them. Load up the blade by being light at the catch and when you have the blade completely in flex, then push and let the blade unflex at the finish, like a spring/ruler hips/glutes thru the second half of the drive -- see flair patience with the arm draw -- strong finishes don't mean you have to smash the arm draw. Just let it carry on at the same speed as the backs but maintain pressure on the blade. Stupid long part of the stroke really compared to the rest Quick back -- I find it helps with the above moving the boat around a fixed point, rather than throwing water away from the stern -- just a mental thing that really makes a lot of difference to how you row IDK it's a call that works for pretty much every crew I've ever been in"
Rowing,3a2ktl,zknarc,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:26:54 2015 UTC,"A strong finish and hard catch are not mutually exclusive by any means and it is vital in any boat to load the blades immediately so they lock instantly at the catch. I run rowinginmotion in my 1x and I get by far the highest stroke efficiencies when I can do this (see  ‘catch through the stretcher’ biorow article.)  In the 1x you may need more patience through the drive as it is moving that much slower and that may be what you coach means; not opening up and pulling with the arms too quickly. The absence of a strong finish in the 1x is more obvious because without it, keeping balance through the finish consistently without a blade touch is almost impossible. A strong finish comes from good sequencing – don’t yank."

What I do is wrap my hands well and practice hanging like you said. Mainly, let the skin heal all the way and keep it dry when possible. Sometimes if I don't wrap until it's too late, the skin just comes off without fully callousing over, especially if it's damp.

Rowing,39wvs2,theicemanguy,7,Mon Jun 15 22:45:06 2015 UTC,I wonder (and hope) if rowers/teams are becoming more open to sharing their scores outside of the team. It really is great being able to see what these guys can pull.
Rowing,39wvs2,acunc,3,Mon Jun 15 14:55:56 2015 UTC,"Many oarsmen are pretty happy to be open about their individual erg scores. It's only because we're told not to disseminate that information publicly (by the powers that be) that more don't do so. It's not as if knowing a few of the opposition's ergos is going to change your training, if you didn't believe that your training was the best possible preparation you wouldn't be doing it."
Rowing,39wvs2,LeopoldTheLlama,-3,Mon Jun 15 15:19:13 2015 UTC,"Perhaps we need to start an anonymous site where rowers across the world can submit their scores. Similar to how journalists don't reveal their sources because the source isn't allowed to comment on a given story.  As you said there really isn't any disadvantage to sharing a score - it's probably just the coaches not wanting scrutiny that may come from what could be perceived as ""bad"" or ""slow"" scores. Ultimately I think it encourages transparency, however."
Rowing,39wvs2,iamkingoftheworld,24,Mon Jun 15 15:56:06 2015 UTC,"Somehow, I feel like if this were anonymous, we would miraculously see a lot of people with really low erg scores."

Rowing,39wvs2,Rummelator,3,Mon Jun 15 22:36:44 2015 UTC,"That's tremendous.  There's an interesting point about big erg scores (currently being discussed on Rowing Illustrated), which is that many experienced rowers and coaches believe that athletes only have a small & limited number of big physical exertions in them per year, and that performance drops off when you have used up your quota.  You really need to pick the right time to break your PB or go sub 5.40 like this. Is the start of the season that time? Was this part of national trials? Will he have enough later in the season when the serious business of competing starts?"
Rowing,39wvs2,kitd,4,Tue Jun 16 08:37:16 2015 UTC,"If that were the case, why would people enter into three world cups and a world championship, each of which has 2-4 races per competition, not counting their national trials or erg tests? And why would people discount Josh's one erg test given that no one knows how many 2ks he's done this year, or will do? I call bullshit. I've never heard anyone complain of losing in August becuase they went down the track too many times"
Rowing,39wvs2,Rummelator,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:04:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not discounting this test. As I said, it's tremendous. But you can't pump out stressful, A-final-type exertions at the drop of a hat, and I'd put a 5.40 time in that bucket.   There are only so many points in the season when it's worth it: maybe 2 big erg tests/NSRs (for making the team), national trials (for making the top boat), World Championships (for securing next year's funding). + Olys (for everlasting fame). Teams differ.  As you obviously know, for most top rowing nations the World Cups are seen mainly as preparation. Sure they're hard work, but the stress is on the World Championships.   So I think the well-prepared will focus on half a dozen big performances per year. I was just wondering whether this was one of JDS' big ones, or whether he just did it anyway."
Rowing,39wvs2,macca_chris,2,Wed Jun 17 13:58:31 2015 UTC,"Discounted was the wrong word, but still I think it's a bit silly to question whether doing a 2k erg test now is going to hurt them in August/September"

Rowing,39yuwl,DRower8,7,Mon Jun 15 22:16:58 2015 UTC,"My guess would be yes. And, once someone breaks 5:30, it will become more and more common place. Running a 4 min mile was deemed impossible, and then Roger Bannister broke it and now it is a standard. That record has been dropped by 17? seconds over the past 50 years.   Humans get stronger, better, faster every generation. Its only a matter of time until some kid who isnt born yet to come in and make history."
Rowing,39yuwl,archane,13,Tue Jun 16 00:47:03 2015 UTC,"5:30 I think is possible, but I do think that's approaching peak human capacity. This guy explains how improvement in sport can be explained by a few factors, and humans aren't really getting much stronger, better, or faster, we just get better at finding the people who can set these records. https://www.ted.com/talks/david_epstein_are_athletes_really_getting_faster_better_stronger?language=en"
Rowing,39yuwl,TrillbroSwaggins,5,Tue Jun 16 02:29:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting talk. I think rowing will benefit a lot from bringing in the right athletes. At the moment rowing is an expensive sport which is only widespread in some developed countries. And in those countries, most participants come from private schools and colleges. When rowing is accessible to a lot more people in a lot more countries, we'll have a stronger pool of athletes competing against each other and driving the quality up."
Rowing,39yuwl,morpen8,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:42:48 2015 UTC,"very interesting, thanks a ton!"
Rowing,39yuwl,jaredl77,5,Tue Jun 16 21:10:38 2015 UTC,"There's a few important differences worth pointing out though.  1) As explained in the TED Talk someone else linked, a lot of the 4-minute mile improvement is down to technology. I can't imagine any single technological advancement having a big impact on erging. Records must be set on stationary Concept 2 ergs.  2) In 1954, we had much less understanding of human physiology and the limits on performance. So the idea of a 4-minute barrier had very little scientific basis and more to do with it being a nice round number. The record is now 3:43.19, approx. a 7% improvement in speed.   3) Diminishing returns. In 1954 there was still a huge amount to learn about training the human body and getting the best out of it. Bannister wasn't even a professional athlete, he was fitting in training around work/study. With the amount of testing going on at the moment, we're a lot closer to optimising the human body for the specific sport. We're not there yet, but we're closer. There's less room to improve.  4) Erging doesn't improve in a linear fashion. If Waddell improved his power output by 10%, his final time would only be 3.3% faster (5:26.0). This is because ergs simulate actual rowing, where more speed = more drag. The faster you go, the harder it is to improve.  5) 5:35 has never been perceived as a ""barrier"" in rowing in the same way the 4 minute mile seemed to be. Yes, Waddell's record is an amazing achievement, but I don't think there's a perception that it's unbeatable.   So I doubt the first sub-5:30 is going to open the floodgates. Whoever achieves it will have produced 5.9% more power than Waddell. That improvement would be almost unheard of in other sports."
Rowing,39yuwl,morpen8,2,Tue Jun 16 05:17:44 2015 UTC,"Looking at Waddell, it's hard for me to imagine someone outputting 5.9% more power while being able to move a boat effectively. I can imagine an athlete who didn't row or was very large could do it, but might have to sacrifice efficiency on the water."
Rowing,39yuwl,TrillbroSwaggins,3,Tue Jun 16 14:06:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's perfectly fair to compare it to breaking the 4-minute mile, since that was 61 years ago, a whole different generation of athletes.   2k testing on Concept2 machines has become the standard only in the last 20 years; it would be interesting if we could look at the 2k scores of Olympic rowers from the last 100 years in the same way we can with running."
Rowing,39yuwl,el_vetica,6,Tue Jun 16 02:34:46 2015 UTC,"5:35, yes. 5:30, highly doubtful. Unlike running, every second you drop in rowing requires exponentially more watts. Just think about how many years of training it took Conlin McCabe to go from a 5:48 at UW (2011 CRASH-B) to a 5:39. Four full years of national team training, after already having trained at UW for another four years, to drop 9 seconds.   And every split after that becomes harder and harder than the one before it."
Rowing,39yuwl,acunc,3,Tue Jun 16 11:52:02 2015 UTC,Relevant TED talk
Rowing,39yuwl,el_vetica,3,Tue Jun 16 02:30:44 2015 UTC,"There are probably several people alive today capable of breaking 5:35, but they just don't row as their main sport. If erging was as popular as Football/Rugby is, you'd see a much larger number of gifted people doing 2ks, and somebody would break it. Eventually the right person will come along who rows instead of playing another more popular sport, and I think will break Waddel's record."
Rowing,39yuwl,CoverDrive1,2,Tue Jun 16 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"Very interesting question.   I agree with the previous poster, as records in other sports reveal the same trend (athletes get faster each generation).   Why is this, though? Are we just learning how to train smarter due to advances in science that enable us to monitor/perfect training plans?"
Rowing,39yuwl,MightyLighty,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:59:30 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. The problem is, as the record gets faster, it will require bigger, heavier athletes. Boat moving is related to power to weight, so the heavier athletes need to become to beat the record, the further erg records will move away from the reach of on water elite rowers. I suspect that 5:30 would require a someone far heavier than is efficient for on water rowing."
Rowing,39yuwl,hullo-reddit,2,Tue Jun 16 13:43:26 2015 UTC,"However, there are currently very few athletes who specialize in erging who do not row on the water. The ideal erging body is much larger than the ideal rowing body."
Rowing,39yuwl,hullo-reddit,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:52:35 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I mean - it will get to a point where someone will have to specialise in erging to beat the record. But they'd rather do better at the Olympics etc!!

Rowing,39ziko,shrillpetrol9424075,4,Tue Jun 16 01:28:26 2015 UTC,Improvements in form should increase efficiency (allow you to row faster with the same exertion) and decrease your risk of injury. Given that you are not being coached you might want to consider whether your form is as improved as you imagine it to be.
Rowing,39ziko,OARneryRower,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:04:54 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I've attempted to lean forward from the hips a little before unlocking my knees coming out of each drive to get a longer sweep, but perhaps it's too exaggerated if not completely wrong. Seems to increase my heart rate, but I felt like that might be ok if it results in less back rounding at the catch."
Rowing,39ziko,acunc,3,Tue Jun 16 12:44:35 2015 UTC,"Better form should make you faster, not slower. As for a higher/lower HR it can depend - not all bad form makes your HR higher."

Rowing,39x559,jawocha,2,Mon Jun 15 15:01:46 2015 UTC,"Can you measure heart rate? A strap and an app would set you back $50 or so. There are heart rate based training programs. I see them most often in rowing books, but you could search online.   If heart rate isn't an option, research perceived exertion. A good program might be tabata intervals once per week at max effort and then focus the rest of the week on longer, easier rows. Start racking up meters/time on the erg all week and then kill it during interval training."

Rowing,39th91,AutologicalUsername,11,Sun Jun 14 16:52:09 2015 UTC,"Tons of Olympians don't start til college. Try doing some squats, deadlifts, bench press, pull ups. Make sure you focus on rowing well at this stage, rowing hard will come later. Sub 7 (1:45 sec/500m) is a good goal 2k, maybe try breaking 7:30 first (1:52.5). Follow r/Rowing religiously, and do more steady state."
Rowing,39th91,TrillbroSwaggins,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:46:30 2015 UTC,"If you started rowing I'd suggest to start with steady state, instead of using weigths. Yes if you start training anywhere pre 20 with spending much time and dedication you can still reach the top.   I can't really give you a time to aim if I don't know how fast you go now. You could use a heart rate monitor and do some workouts at 160 bpm. Increase the workouts from something like 40 minutes to 60 minutes. Your time should decrease to somwhere around 2:00."
Rowing,39th91,GPier,2,Sun Jun 14 21:49:14 2015 UTC,"Most kids don't start until high school (7th grade at the absolute earliest usually) so you're not even remotely far behind! In fact, most rowers start in college and played other sports in high school. And rowing is one of those sports where your improvement is proportional to the amount of time and work you put in to getting faster. And if you're looking for times to use, my younger brother is a 16yo/6'0""/136 rower and pulls a 7:34 2k on the erg so eventually you should be able to be faster than that (you should most likely be able to go sub-7 once you're in top shape). BUT before you start trying to get fast, please make sure your technique is in good shape. Otherwise, you'll just hurt yourself. Good luck to you and hope you're enjoying rowing!"

Rowing,39th91,-not-a-serial-killer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:16:26 2015 UTC,"As someone who didn't start younger, how good is it reasonably possible to get?   You're starting younger than me, I only started around my 19th birthday and I got invited to trial for the national team soon after turning 20, so don't even worry about your age.    Is there anything at the gym that could help alongside using the rowing machine- anything I should work on more?   For me it was (and still is) cycling that got my fitness to where it is now. I found that I could just go out and cycle for hours, doing hundreds of kilometres every week, while still enjoying myself, whereas ergs make me want to kill myself (luckily, I train on the water enough that I no longer erg outside of testing). In terms of weights, the most important things to focus on are deadlifts, then squats, then bench-pulls.   Any tips to help avoid stupid rookie errors?   Remember that you suck. Listen to your coaches and don't get arrogant. My coaches have said that the reason that I have come this far in so little time is that I am so coachable. If my coaches wanted me to change something or focus on something, then I would do it without question, knowing that they knew more than me. Far too often, you will see novices, who have read something online or watched Will it make the boat go faster, who will contradict or ignore their coaches. These guys never get fast. Don't be them.    Could someone give me some reasonable rough target times to aim for on the rowing machine?   If you can get your 2k below 7:00, then you will have made the first step towards being a good rower and you will have a good base to work off. If you are still a long way from there, then don't worry, I was pulling 7:40+ only a month or two before breaking 7:00. You're young and you're a novice, so you can improve at a rate that most of us can only dream of.  Also, always remain aware of your goals and of the progression as you improve. If you eventually want to make the national team, then you should be starting to find out how to get into the state team, or at least progressing to the top of your club. Also, try to spend as much time as you can in small boats, preferably a single.  If you have any questions or want some help, then I'd be more than happy to."

So pretty much two options left:   Eat less Eat different   If you are certain that you eat the right food; just start eating a little less bit by bit. I'm not a big fan of counting calories but it is the most effective way.  If you feel it is too hard to start eating less, be creative and eat differently. Pick foods that make you feel you are full. Stay away from easy sugar snacks (fe granola bars, sweets..)  For more info I would recommend this book."
Rowing,39v4r9,fristicake,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:21:25 2015 UTC,"Yea im starting to realize maybe just start eating less and cut all sources of junk food. Its hard to get away from it when you still live with parents. Im gonna order that book seeing how cheap it that, I think that may help. I had some bad eating habits before I started to row and I guess it followed in when I started this sport. I definitely changed my habits since I started and I did lose wight during my first year but it did stall. I told my parents to stop buying junk food now and they agreed so thats a right step in the direction. Im doing summer, fall, and my school season of rowing so I think workouts are covered. Thanks for the info."
Rowing,39v4r9,beef_burrito,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:11:38 2015 UTC,"You need to lose fat in general, you can't target specific areas. Just keep rowing, don't eat like a pig. If you really want to, you can estimate your daily calorie consumption and subtract 250-500Cal from that to lose 0.5-1lbs/week. 0.5lbs weight loss per week seems to be well tolerated without decreases in performance, more than that and some people find their performance drops off a bit, more significantly at higher rates of fat loss. I wouldn't worry about it too much, I generally have a hard time eating enough not to lose weight during the summers."

Kind of annoying because in singles i steady state like 2:18 - 2:24 yet my 2k is close to 7:20...

This row (Christmas of 2013) lit a fire under my ass and by April 2014 I was erg testing. Did well enough on the erg test to make me want to actually train and here I am... In a year I have bought a boat, raced all over north America, moved home, and started training in earnest. It is definitely possible to come back to the sport and to hit the ground running!"

Part of it is fueled by the desire to be fit and train everyday regardless of rowing success. Like, ""what else would I do?"": running and cycling are bad options for someone so heavy and tall.

Even if they can't help with funding, it might help cut costs elsewhere (e.g. uniforms, free gym access, food), or they could give you something to auction off. I think fundraisers are normally more successful if people  feel like they are getting something in return too, not just giving their money. So like silent auctions, some rowing lessons, a signed uniform etc. Also, their are heaps of grants available, you just have to spend time searching online and applying.  Good luck!!"

Rowing,39rhm0,NFsG,0,Mon Jun 15 11:03:27 2015 UTC,"Sub 6 boat average. The middle 4 are probably in the low 5:50s, maybe even with a couple guys in the high 5:40s end pairs are probably 6:00 plus or minus 5 seconds. That's a very rough estimate, but that's what you tend to hear about the top schools' 1Vs. This is not specifically for Yale."
Rowing,39rhm0,crewniac,13,Mon Jun 15 15:09:53 2015 UTC,"I think having multiple guys in the 5:40's is very very unlikely. You get your freaks like McCabe once every so often but it will never be the norm at college level when guys are 19-22 years old.  I expect the average is around 6, possibly over.  Washington I expect to be sub 6. But again not below 5:55 average."
Rowing,39rhm0,rowerldn,7,Sun Jun 14 01:35:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would generally agree with this and say that it isn't the norm by any means, but looking at the specifics of the varsity (height and weight) this seems a pretty accurate estimate. Their six seat is the U23 champion single sculler. But, I don't necessarily agree with the placement of the erg times. You'd be surprised how many collegiate crews have their own idea of where the most powerful people in the boat should go. I know Washington tends to place some of their faster ergs at the front or in the stroke seat so that the rest of the boat feels an ""impulse."""

Rowing,39rhm0,jaliston12345,3,Sun Jun 14 05:28:35 2015 UTC,"Not a chance. When McCabe and Stuzyna were both at UW they were the fastest college rowers at crash-b and they went 5:48 and 5:52, respectively. On any given year I think you're more likely NOT to have anyone sub-5:50.   You can easily check this by looking at the V8 erg average of Brown at crash-b, since they send most of their top guys (as does Harvard). Brown is a grand final crew and, at least based on their crash-b results, they don't come anywhere close to matching what you are saying.   For those interested in checking their results, keep in mind they compete at ""unaffiliated"" at crash-b (as does Harvard), so you'll have to do a roster check."
Rowing,39rhm0,acunc,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:31:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but I think even since then, that recruiting has gotten so much better. Wyatt Allen said that at Cal he could bring in a few freshmen every year that were sub 6. Granted, this is Cal, but Gladstone does an amazing job recruiting as well. There are only two Americans in that boat and the average height and weight is something like 6'5, 215. Not inconceivable to have one or two guys in the high 5:40's."
Rowing,39rhm0,jaliston12345,5,Sun Jun 14 12:25:14 2015 UTC,"I think you are underestimating how hard it is to go sub 5:50.   The U.S. National team doesn't have that many - the vast majority of guys are in the 5:50s. So yes, there are some monsters in the sub 6 range, and most of them are at cal and UW, but sub 5:50 I have to disagree"
Rowing,39rhm0,acunc,2,Sun Jun 14 16:46:25 2015 UTC,I know how hard it is to go sub 6... but at the same time you've got to consider there are some freaks of nature out there. The six seat in that Yale boat went 6:07 his sophomore year in high school. He also happens to be the U23 champion single sculler. He's probably sub 5:50...
Rowing,39rhm0,jaliston12345,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:53:08 2015 UTC,"For Yale, a big crew where the average crew weight is ~100kg, you're looking at mid-to-high 5:50s average. That's the exception though: many of the recent Sprints victors have been significantly smaller, with an erg average just over 6:00."
Rowing,39rhm0,theicemanguy,0,Sun Jun 14 16:50:22 2015 UTC,Both top crews (WU and Cal) do have one or 2 guys going sub 5:50 I would say. The rest of the guys in the 1V should be around 5:51-5:58.

There is no ""one HR fits all"" number for steady state that can be applied to all individuals, but through monitoring your own training you can figure out what a good intensity is for you to build your base without overtraining.   2) I like to have a look at my HR during high rate/intensity pieces. If you have a good idea of what your max HR is, and you see that you're 10 beats below when doing time trials, then you can mentally be like ""alright bitch, pull harder because you know you've got it in you""  3) Everyone loves seeing that they burned 2300 calories on their double practice that morning and can therefore eat all the food with none of the guilt."

Rowing,39nick,bballdeo,3,Sat Jun 13 18:50:59 2015 UTC,"highschool, club, college, v, 3v. Anyone mind to explain me the American rowing system? You start as a junior, then highschool, then college? what's clubrowing? What do the best rowers in university  row?"
Rowing,39nick,ConstipatedDuck,3,Sat Jun 13 14:30:17 2015 UTC,"Junior and high school are the same... High school is scholastic and junior is for anyone under 19 years old. Club rowing is non-scholastic, so you row for a team in your area, not you're school. College teams are usually broken into 8's where the top is the varsity or the V, the second is the 2nd varsity or the 2v, and the third, the 3v, etc."
Rowing,39nick,sheesh999,2,Sat Jun 13 16:15:22 2015 UTC,"To explain further - rowing is too expensive for many public schools to subsidize. Thus, private junior rowing clubs formed where there were no scholastic teams. This is very common in the newer rowing hotbeds such as Florida and California.  Most rowers start out either for a junior club or a high school scholastic team. Then everyone moves onto college, which is a more unified system.   College teams are usually broken into 8's where the top is the varsity or the V, the second is the 2nd varsity or the 2v, and the third, the 3v, etc.   Also, many large club teams and scholastic teams at the junior level who are primarily locked into eights also do this. Winter Park, Thomas Jefferson are good examples."
Rowing,39nick,Jojomats,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:26:54 2015 UTC,"To explain further - rowing is too expensive for many public schools to subsidize. Thus, private junior rowing clubs formed where there were no scholastic teams. This is very common in the newer rowing hotbeds such as Florida and California.   The American scholastic rowing system in a nutshell:   Middle school: Grades 5-8. Ages 11-14. High school: Grades 9-12. Ages 15-18. ""College"" for Brits. Where school rowing programs don't exist, people row for (mostly) private clubs, same as above. College: Usually 4-year undergraduate/bachelor's degrees. ""University"" for Brits. Ages 18+. The best of the best are recruited to row for varsity programs at NCAA Division 1 teams (for heavyweight women). Or IRA teams (for all men and lightweight women). These programs generally receive sizable funding from participating colleges.   The reason NCAA rowing does not exist for men is that any school with varsity programs has to have (by law) a 1:1 ratio of male:female athletes. Because most schools with varsity programs have American football teams, that means they have to have a bunch of women's sports to balance out the huge football rosters.  IRA exists because rowing is an old boy sport and tradition dies hard for old boys.  Colleges that do not have varsity programs have rowing clubs that compete in ACRA (basically a junior varsity league). These clubs don't usually compete with NCAA or IRA schools and are usually subsidized entirely by their rowers. That said, clubs do on occasion produce Olympic-caliber rowers.  And as an aside to what the last guy said, American public school ≠ British public school. American public schools are publicly funded by state governments. The American equivalents to schools like Eton are called ""private/boarding/[college] prep"" schools."
Rowing,39nick,IStrokeBoats123,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:21:09 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, university sports programs in the U.S. are typically divided into ""varsity"" and ""club"" teams. The varsity teams are supported (and governed) by the athletic department in accordance with how important the sport is to the school (although many top varsity rowing programs also rely heavily on alumni for additional financial support). Club programs have much less support from their school and you have to pay a membership fee (and hit up the alumni), although some top club programs rival certain varsity programs in terms of equipment and facilities.  So when you hear about ""club"" rowing in the U.S., that may be a reference to a non-varsity college team, as well as private clubs that are not associated with a school."

It's hardly cheating if it's the industry standard.  He also had a VO2 max over 80ml/kg/min before he started doping. That would put him around 5:55 for 2k at 75kg.
Rowing,39jytk,RIP_WSAD,18,Fri Jun 12 13:00:39 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely still cheating even if it's the industry standard.

Rowing,39jytk,RIP_WSAD,19,Fri Jun 12 14:12:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not discounting the fact that he's a world class athlete. But he's also a world class cheater. Regardless of how arbitrary you feel the PE line is, he signed up for it and agreed to adhere to it. He's a cheater, plain and simple"
Rowing,39jytk,Rummelator,2,Fri Jun 12 16:25:22 2015 UTC,"He is a cheater for sure,  breaking the rules intentionally is cheating.

Rowing,39jytk,campizza,4,Sun Jun 14 04:16:02 2015 UTC,"Respect for him cheating better? No. I give him no respect for that.

Rowing,39jytk,Rummelator,-1,Sun Jun 14 05:01:22 2015 UTC,So you think. Of course he fooled hundreds of medical professionals over the years. Maybe he fooled you also. He's like Barry Bonds or ARod.

Rowing,39jytk,morkus_from_orkus,7,Fri Jun 12 15:00:37 2015 UTC,"What are you even saying? I've never denied his doping. I know his test results from before he was a USPS rider. Meaning before he had access to that kind of sophisticated doping program.  He was not doping as a junior triathlete, if that's what you are suggesting.  People often forget that even doping requires insane training. Lance would go to France and do mountain repeats. Shit that no other cyclist could feasibly do.

Rowing,39jytk,acunc,-1,Fri Jun 12 15:37:07 2015 UTC,"easy to judge someone like that. But if everyone is using and it's what you have been training for your whole life, it's your lifestyle, your way of income, it's not that weird to use it aswell.  Like said before, he was a great cyclist even without doping. but if you want to be the best, it's hard to beat others if they do use it."
Rowing,39jytk,GPier,4,Fri Jun 12 14:25:59 2015 UTC,"An argument about the ethics of doping is way out of the scope of a rowing subreddit, so let's put that aside and just focus on the fact that, as I mentioned in a comment below, he ruined people's lives.

Rowing,39jytk,campizza,0,Sun Jun 14 04:18:19 2015 UTC,"Oh - so where do we draw the line on ""performance enhancing"" means? Gatorade is certainly performance enhancing and involves using exogenous substances. How about caffeine? Or food? Electrolyte tablets? Training at altitude? Living at altitude and training low? Resistance training certainly can help facilitate increases in growth hormone and testosterone.  From the Wikipedia article on doping at the TDF: Of the cyclists who finished on the podium in the era in which Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times (1999–2005), Fernando Escartín is the sole rider not to be implicated in a doping scandal.[43] With ""20 of the 21 podium finishers in the Tour de France from 1999 through 2005 directly tied to likely doping through admissions, sanctions, public investigations or exceeding the UCI hematocrit (a blood test to discover EPO use) threshold"", Escartin's third-place finish in the 1999 Tour de France stands as the lone of the 21 podium finishes that was untainted, during the years (1999–2005) in which Lance Armstrong finished the Tour de France in first place.  Quite literally nobody good was not doping. Not only that, something like seven or eight of the top ten finishers in the years that Lance won were found guilty of doping at a later point in their career. Just because their place wasn't vacated at the TDF doesn't make them innocent.  That's why the TDF never replaced the name of the winner of all the years vacated by Lance - EPO was that common.  So sure, I don't know anything about sport, maybe. But I certainly can recognize reality and know that sometimes our ethical standards are outdated and/or mismatched."

From the Wikipedia article on doping at the TDF: Of the cyclists who finished on the podium in the era in which Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times    Yeah you may notice a correlation between success and doping. It makes you able to beat non-dopers handily! This is why the good guys doped - doping made them the good guys.    Oh - so where do we draw the line on ""performance enhancing"" means?   Irrelevant to your point that Lance may not be a giant cheat. He signed up to an anti-doping code and broke it. That is cheating. If everyone cheats then it is still cheating.  But Lance was special. He actively went after journalists who exposed the lie. He lied in court under oath. He made a LOT of money on the back of his lies. He treated people disgracefully. And he is still lying today about the extent of his cheating.   So sure, I don't know anything about sport, maybe.   Clearly not."
Rowing,39jytk,Timothy_Claypole,-5,Fri Jun 12 20:20:40 2015 UTC,"Except that the distance between those top cyclists and everyone else was not small. Certainly greater than the benefits of EPO.  If you wanted to be competitive, you doped. Hell, they still dope now. It's just easier to avoid getting caught because there's more money paid for helping cyclist cheat than detecting cheaters.

Rowing,39jytk,Timothy_Claypole,2,Sat Jun 13 09:14:35 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying, but your PEDs aren't great examples.  I believe caffeine is banned beyond a certain level - but it is naturally occurring in foods in levels that can provide some benefit (doesn't have to be synthetically produced/concentrated to achieve).  Electrolytes are a nutritional need - would be like banning water.  Altitude training is a physical training method so is resistance training, not cheating.  But sometimes the line between supplement and performance enhancer can be thin.  Some better examples might be creatine, beta alanine and quercetin.    Fortunately however, there is an answer to your question.  To not be a cheater, in any sport, you follow the rules.  The rules for not doping is right here: http://list.wada-ama.org/  I think we can agree intentionally taking a prescription medication  (EPO) that is on the banned substances list and can be lethal when abused is not an ethical gray area."

Rowing,39lni7,nux12345,3,Fri Jun 12 16:32:01 2015 UTC,We always used watts in high school for steady state because we lactate tested and you were basically given a set wattage to hold for steady state every day and it generally increased by 3~ watts per 8 days +- a couple watts.

Rowing,39lni7,MightyLighty,2,Sat Jun 13 02:03:39 2015 UTC,It was interesting in the fact that we probably did about a 90 - 10% ratio of steady to hard pieces maybe even a bit more. 6 days a week 60:00 + steady plus whatever anyone did extra.  Not the best technical coach but my high school coach has talked for usrowing on physiology and is pretty well known for lactate work.

Rowing,39lni7,campizza,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:25:28 2015 UTC,Made nats in the heavy 1x as a 143 lb lwt. Did not get to race unfortunately due to a traumatic injury to my back/stomach and a surgery. No idea where I would have placed but I had done pretty well being undefeated in my region until regionals and I was 6 seconds back from the eventual bronze medalist at youths when I raced him. All in all not a bad senior year until my accident
Rowing,39lni7,Tsav150,2,Wed Jun 17 03:03:41 2015 UTC,Watts are slightly more precise so I find them useful if I am gunning for a 1/2 split (i.e. 1:41.5).  Sometimes I also think there is a psychological benefit to seeing a higher number when you are rowing faster.
Rowing,39lni7,OARneryRower,2,Fri Jun 12 16:35:49 2015 UTC,Additionally as you get faster difference between two consectutive splits increases.   From 2:00 to 1:59 is from 203W to 208W. From 1:45 to 1:44 is from 302W to 311W.
Rowing,39lni7,Jedwindx,2,Fri Jun 12 17:13:01 2015 UTC,Watts are more precise than splits because splits do not progress linearly. IE 2:00 to 1:55 requires much less power/wattage increase than 1:30 to 1:25. This also makes it much more useful for max power tests.
Rowing,39lni7,iPwnForYou,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:39:11 2015 UTC,My coach had us train in watts this past spring to help with mental barriers for 2k's. That way we didn't really know what splits we were pulling and we just had to hit our goal wattage.
Rowing,39l3wx,Nebbaj,3,Fri Jun 12 14:12:50 2015 UTC,"If it's this type of equipment: http://www.hypoxico.com/  Then yes.  That equipment changes the concentration of inspired gases - less oxygen and more nitrogen - so you have the same response as being at altitude where the partial pressure of oxygen is decreased.  If it's this: http://www.trainingmask.com/training-mask-2-0/  Then, no.  If you want the sensation of the latter - buy nose plugs and breathe through a straw while you row.  You are still inspiring the same oxygen content, just making it more difficult to expand and compress the lungs."

Rowing,39f798,trekbeer,3,Thu Jun 11 10:33:45 2015 UTC,What level are you? If you've been rowing for only 2 years you might get better results with just timing your catch since most still tend to catch during the stroke when getting tired.

Rowing,39f798,bud_city,3,Thu Jun 11 12:10:01 2015 UTC,"Going wide grip helps you rotate out of the boat. When you're talking about ""reach"" the thought that comes to mind for me is trying to get further to stern, which will result in an inversion of your shoulders (inside shoulder down, outside up) because your outside hand will try to pull you to stern, which is not a strong position.  If you look at the arc of the oar handle, as it pivots around the pin it's obviously leading you out of the boat and if you were to follow it, your outside hand would eventually end up outside of the gunwale. Wide grip helps rotate your shoulders, which is controlled by your core and a strong rotation through your thoracic spine. Moreover, if you rotate out at the catch, your weight will not be pushing down into the hull causing check. Instead, it will be swinging out to the pin, which won't upset balance.  Think of how a fighter jet banks on a turn. It drops it's inside wing (shoulder) and makes an arc around a point to turn. Apply that same motion with your shoulders."
Rowing,39f798,TrillbroSwaggins,2,Thu Jun 11 15:23:34 2015 UTC,I only do it during the warm up just to open my body up and it helps with the catch too. Means you are relying less on your inside hand to do the catch.

Rowing,39hqli,Parkess,5,Thu Jun 11 20:11:10 2015 UTC,Lol as a bunch of people will come on to this and say Steady State please just take it and stride. You need steady state on the erg. The erg is not rowing on the water but it's the only land training that works the same base muscle set. Erg as much as you can. Buy yourself a HR monitor and then erg.  Elite rowers ~100k steady state per week Collegiate rowers ~60-100k steady state per week Competitive Clubs and HS rowers ~30-60k steady state per week   These are just averages I have come to know but many programs differ: elite rowers can do over 150km in SS one week and collegiate rowers can do only 10km one week. It just varies with each program.  Also know who you are. I'm in high school but I have done a couple of 100k steady state weeks. Overuse injuries come and go. Build up to the volume you are motivated to do and go for it.  I brought my 2k down from a 6:58 to 6:44 in the month of January. I rowed about 300k.  Just keep your goal in mind and erg. Every piece you do just remember that your future 2k would have been slower had you not sat down on the erg for that piece and the rest of all those meters.  FYI: that's 300km outside of practice. I probably did around 500km of total erging.
Rowing,39hqli,ThunerboltRiley,3,Fri Jun 12 01:18:21 2015 UTC,Mind if I ask to borrow your training plan for that month?
Rowing,39hqli,thatfgtnextdoor,2,Fri Jun 12 02:40:56 2015 UTC,"I'll be pretty honest though that I was lacking SS and not strength so if you need strength as well, it will take you longer.  My SS began at 2:10 and ended at 2:06. My squat was 205 4x10. Barbell Rows were at 150 6x10. Deadlift was 265 4x10. Bench Press was at 150 6x10.  Lifted 2x. I erged up to 6 times but at least three times. I practiced 4 times.  Lifts were the basics and each lift was done as a superset with a calisthenic. Push ups, pull ups, Box jumps, etc. I changed the calisthenic a couple times just to keep it fun as long as the main lifts progressed.  Schedule:  M: Erg T: Erg Practice  W: Erg Lift Th: Erg Practice F: Erg Practice Sat: Erg Practice Sun: Lift  Practice was mainly hard SS or AT work or endurance weights. Erg was always 2x45"" @ 18-20 spm w/15min of rest below 160hr no matter what through the entire piece. Also understand I didn't always have time and  I wasn't always rested enough to do SS. Just make sure to do it at least three times per week. If you find you have time to do some SS but not 2x45"" which happened to me quite a bit, then do distances like a 10-15km straight. I liked 12km.    Keep in mind if you want the fastest results you must be consistent in all areas: SS, lifts, flexibility, technique, and AT/VO2Max.  I would recommend you find your own lifting program. Mine was very specific to me. I was trying to define the muscle I already had and make steady slow progress. If you want to make progress faster then lowering the reps and increasing the load would be beneficial but find a program for you. Or make your own then post it if you feel it may not be on your target. Just make sure you squat and pull something. If you lifted a few things up off the ground, it wouldn't hurt. Find what best works for you."
Rowing,39hqli,ThunerboltRiley,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:15:22 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for the long reply! Motivated me to do more SS for sure.
Rowing,39hqli,thatfgtnextdoor,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:36:56 2015 UTC,In terms of SS work would something like 3×25 minutes at 2:00 splits sound about right? Could probably do that about 3 times a week so that's about 45-50km?
Rowing,39hqli,ThunerboltRiley,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:42:21 2015 UTC,If your going by splits then I need to know your 2k? Steady state isn't defined by split but by a percentage of intensity using lactate acid or hr or in your case speed.  If your steady state is a 2 then I'm going to guess your 2k is somewhere between 6:30-6:40 given you have decent strength.  If your 2k is not that then you need to change.  I would not recommend going by speed because people vary by how strong they are. So if your cardio sucks then you might be adding 30-35 seconds to your 2k splits just to hit your zone but if it's great then you could be adding 15-20 seconds (elite rowers). Personally I add around 25-30. My pair partner added 20-25. He could hit a 2:00 but only squatted 160 for reps. I could hit a 2:03 but I could squat 280 for reps. He was about 8 inches taller than me but we managed. We weighed the same-170. My 2k came out to be 6:36.7 and his came down to a 6:49.9! And yet on the water our technique was by far superior to both of our times and we could row fast.  I would just buy a HR monitor.
Rowing,39hqli,GPier,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:38:30 2015 UTC,"To add: if you do ss make sure to try to increase the duration rather than your watts. Untill you do 1hr/1hr30 atleast.   Also, do you mean 100k ss on an erg/week? that's besides the rowing right? I also think this differs alot between each nation"
Rowing,39hqli,ThunerboltRiley,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:38:01 2015 UTC,"This differs based on nation because of funding and depth.  Crews around the world never even touch an erg.  100k SS can be on the erg or water but if you row your SS in bad conditions, it will screw your training. You want to keep as many things constant as possible. So if your going to do SS on the water then make sure you do it the same time every morning.    On the water you have to have the right equipment. Your stroke coach has to tell splits and hr OR you have to come up with a method to do both. Timing is simple. You could go by distance but flow and current will change that.  And hr could be stored on the watch sometimes.  It is possible but it's a lot more complicated. If you simply do not care about seeing your progress it's actually a lot simpler but keep in mind you won't be able to project your 2k which could be detrimental."

Rowing,39dnq7,captiancurtains,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:25:54 2015 UTC,"Don't do that, the workout can take a different toll on your body depending on conditions you're rowing in and how well rested your body is. Heart rate is a good indicator of that as it will tend to increase proportionally as your body is fatigued. If you stay at the same split with a higher heart rate, you are no longer training the same zone."

At the end of the day, your 2K or 6K time is what will determine it. Steady State rowing is DELIBERATELY reduced intensity so that your HR stays in a different training range than race pace.  Don't worry about what your steady state pace is, so long as your HR is in the desired range when doing it."

Rowing,39d4tc,holysoles,4,Wed Jun 10 23:31:46 2015 UTC,"I would stay off the erg (indoor rowing machine). It seems like a good idea because that is the standard training tool outside of the boat, but you can build bad habits if you haven't been coached, and there are plenty of other ways to build some solid fitness.  I would work on creating a base level of strength and fitness over the summer. If you check out /r/fitness they have any number of recommended strength programs, and beyond that I would just try to be as active as possible, getting in some decent length cardio workouts a couple of times a week.  Don't stress and try to overdo summer training - your novice fall will help you build fitness in a big way, just being fairly fit and strong going in will help you out a ton.  Best of luck!"
Rowing,39d4tc,twicemoneyswagg,3,Thu Jun 11 01:55:21 2015 UTC,"I would definitely agree in staying off the erg until after the fall season starts. There are certain bad habits you can pick up (gripping with the arms at the catch, not enough rock over at the catch, too much layback, etc.) that you won't really understand are wrong until you have an idea of how it feels to be in a boat.   Just stay active this summer. Do some running and cycling. Most people over-estimate how difficult it is to make their school's novice team. Also, try and make sure you're doing some additional workouts at least 2-3x a week during your novice season (if you've got the time!) to keep your fitness up. Your novice season will not make you fitter. You will spend so much time learning technique (some of the time you won't even be rowing because half the boat will be rowing on the square while the other half will be holding levels, etc.) and you won't yet be proficient enough on the water to get a workout while rowing.   If you're not trying out for your school's novice team, and already know how to row from high school, then go for the Pete or Wolverine plan. Also, the Alex Krupp lightweight plan is pretty effective if you really want to develop an aerobic base. Best of luck!"

Rowing,39czpp,FatherSonBrolySpirit,2,Thu Jun 11 00:03:34 2015 UTC,"Each school is going to be different, some lightweight schools this year gave as few as 12 OVs and some giving high 20's and im sure certain heavy programs give more.   Likely letters were contingent upon committing to the school ED in my case. They give you one if you give them one. I have not heard of anyone getting screwed over by Ivies though so letters are more ceremonial, but other D1's have decommitted kids  What /u/fathersonbrolyspirit said is also true, its a small network when it comes to the end of recruiting time"

Rowing,39czpp,rowerdell,0,Fri Jun 12 16:49:23 2015 UTC,"Official visits are like a really long, fun, job interview. It's for you to see if you like the school, but also for them to see if you're a good fit for the program. To get an OV, you need to have already ticked all the boxes (academics, rowing ability etc.). They wouldn't waste their time and money on you if they weren't interested, but it's by no means a guarantee at all. Also, programs have less likely letters than recruiting spots, so they might not be able to give you a LL, but they might still support you through admissions. Because of this, they often save LLs for students that really need it in order to get in."

Rowing,3965qd,plups,3,Tue Jun 9 15:21:37 2015 UTC,"I understand it's a presentation by nutrition students, but I don't completely agree. If you do fasted cardio you promote fat utilization, which is not a bad thing - in fact, it may be beneficial. I wouldn't so strongly say that you should definitely eat before exercising - erg or otherwise."
Rowing,3965qd,acunc,3,Tue Jun 9 17:13:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe not before exercising, but you wouldn't want to try and race a 2K on just fat alone.  Fat burning works well for long distance (think ultra marathoners), but you'll never race your fastest rowing time trying to do so just on fat stores (unless you're doing a trans ocean row or something)"
Rowing,3965qd,chrispyb,3,Tue Jun 9 18:08:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, absolutely. For an SS training session it's really not a big deal, and like I said, could even be beneficial.  For hard workouts, races, and tests - you DEFINITELY want some carbohydrates beforehand."
Rowing,3965qd,acunc,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:29:56 2015 UTC,"Well there is that, but surely it makes sense to just train on a bit of calorie deficit if you're training like 2 sessions a day, you'll get more gains while also lowering fat %?"
Rowing,3965qd,plups,5,Tue Jun 9 17:27:50 2015 UTC,I generally wake up and eat a piece of toast with some nutella on it and have a glass of water about an hour before practice starts.
Rowing,3965qd,TheLoneDonut,8,Tue Jun 9 15:16:55 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of bad information in the previous comments. A little good, but a lot bad. First let me say that I have lived with, rowed with and trained with world champion oarsmen and women, and none of them skip breakfast. Ever.   The number one reason younger and less experienced rowers don't eat before training in the morning is because they don't feel good after eating and then training. There are two factors in play here, one is that they are eating the wrong thing. There is no magic formula ""everyone should eat X before practice."" Everyone is different and what your stomach can tolerate, another person's might not. So try something different if you don't feel good during practice. Generally, carbs are what you primarily want to be consuming. Two of my favorites are a sweet potato or a bowl of oatmeal. Both options provide a few hundred calories of complex carbohydrates. I also sometimes add a few hardboiled eggs to my meal, but this is less likely to sit well with most people I think.  The other thing is not eating early enough. My general rule of thumb and what a lot of my teammates and friends would do, is to wake up an hour before you have to be at the boat house, and eat immediately. this gives you over an hour to digest before starting to train.   Next, fasted cardio. Pure bro science. You are an rower, not a bodybuilder. You are erging to get faster. The training benefit is significantly minimized if you run out of gas half way through the workout. If loosing fat is a concern, thats a whole other issue, but don't use your training to create a deficit. Cut calories from the rest of your day rather than around your workout.  Definitely don't skip breakfast. Keep doing what you're doing."
Rowing,3965qd,624mark,3,Tue Jun 9 17:42:39 2015 UTC,Thank you for your insight.
Rowing,3965qd,acunc,4,Tue Jun 9 18:14:38 2015 UTC,"If you eat regularly (as in, you ate normally the day before), you're NOT going to run out of gas doing SS in a fasted state. Your body contains enough fat-derived calories to power you for a REALLY long time. It's not bro science, even if you've trained with world champions.   Fasted cardio promotes more fat utilization, which in turn leads to a lower HR at SS intensities. This is actually a benefit.  Now, if you're training 2-3 times a day, everyday, yeah you probably don't want to be skipping any meals because you're burning so many calories a day and there are only so many meals you can fit into your day. If you're NOT training 2-3 times a day, everyday, fasted cardio is fine."
Rowing,3965qd,624mark,4,Tue Jun 9 18:33:28 2015 UTC,"I see your argument and agree that some of the studies that you posted seem to support your claim, but I can tell you, this just isn't what elite rowers do. Even lightweights concerned about making weight don't skip meals ever, especially breakfast, and therefore I cannot recommend not eating before a morning training session. Having bonked, I can tell you that fat derived calories do run out during aerobic exercise. Eating pre-training is always a good idea."
Rowing,3965qd,acunc,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:55:19 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I don't question the fact that elite rowers/athletes don't workout without eating beforehand.

Rowing,3965qd,acunc,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:54:51 2015 UTC,"I remember in college when we would have morning practice (5:30 or so) most people wouldn't eat, but afterward we would head straight to the dining hall and have a huge breakfast, followed by regular meals the rest of the day. Ultimately it's a preference thing - some people have a hard time eating right after waking up, others can't exercise without eating something first.

I definitely agree with eating at least an hour before. I eat 5 eggs toast yogurt plus oatmeal if I have 4 sessions but those days typically only come in near the end of a season. On days I have 2-3 sessions I have just 5 eggs toast and yogurt. On 1 session days I have 3 eggs toast yogurt OR just oatmeal. And off days I have cereal.  Idk why but eggs do it for me and a toast is enough carbs to get through the first workout but those 4 session days I usually have a 2 hour break between morning practices so the oatmeal is required for me to make it through both workouts.  Just thought I share for those reading this wanting to eat more. LW can do this as well just make sure you are actually having 4 sessions that day before eating that much food.  I scramble my eggs, but feel free to do whatever."

I would do 6x1k with 2' rest and would go 1:40.3 when my 6k was 1:41.2 (as a lightweight).  Absolutely no way I'd be able to do 6 more 1ks at 1:41."
Rowing,393k4g,jawocha,4,Tue Jun 9 04:07:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're just a pussy.   Yes and no,  if you can complete  it right at 6k you can probably go faster on 6k. A lot depends on your fitness profile though. The difference between 6k and 10 is only a couple splits difference though and this workout is 10-12k with 1:20 breaks."
Rowing,393k4g,jawocha,2,Tue Jun 9 12:35:37 2015 UTC,Exactly. Just because you can't do it doesn't mean it can't be done. Not that different from 8x500on/3:30 rest
Rowing,393k4g,jawocha,2,Tue Jun 9 12:52:53 2015 UTC,"here is an unrelated question that I have about this workout. Are the 500s all out sprint, or do you go slower, like 2k pace?"
Rowing,393k4g,jawocha,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:57:56 2015 UTC,"Totally depends on the purpose of the workout. If the goal is to build pace confidence then reduce the rest slightly and do them at pace (a good one is to do them as the different 500s in the race in pairs... So 2 @ 1st 500, 2 @ 2nd 500 etc). If your goal is to get some solid C2 work in, do them as fast as possible starting @ 2k pace and trying to negative split slightly each time."
Rowing,393k4g,kickAhoeNdaFace,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:56:10 2015 UTC,8x500m with 3:30 rest is much easier.  If you wanted a better comparison do 8x500m @2k with about 1:20 rest (assuming you go 1:35 for 2k).  That way you're keeping the same work/rest ratio as your other workout.

Rowing,391dkf,captiancurtains,6,Mon Jun 8 15:28:21 2015 UTC,Some junior rowers may have a heart rate that is high for the lactate results.

Rowing,391dkf,Eightplusandunder,4,Tue Jun 9 03:52:54 2015 UTC,I would say you should lift before erging. You don't want to have fatigue while lifting because then form usually falls apart and can lead to injury.  You should base your HR off of your max. Find your max HR and then take a percentage of that to get your target SS HR.
Rowing,391dkf,914Gangles,5,Mon Jun 8 18:23:47 2015 UTC,"The strap should be right below your pecs, not around your abs."
Rowing,391dkf,avo_cado,5,Mon Jun 8 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"1) Personally, I wouldn't say ""at least an 18"", rather, keep it below a 20. I do most of my SS at a 16-18. 2) If you're taking a few hours of rest in between, I don't think it matters. If you're doing them back-to-back (which I highly discourage), then lift first, erg after. 3) Just tighten the strap more. 5) Buy or make your own seat pad. I use a hand towel that I fold in half. 6) I wouldn't do power 10s every time you do SS. Every now and then it's fine, but certainly you don't want to do that each time. I would also wait longer to do them - as /u/captiancurtains said, this may be why your HR is so high."
Rowing,391dkf,acunc,2,Mon Jun 8 16:06:58 2015 UTC,"160bpm could be too low for your steady state pace. Most people fall within 140-160, but there are always outliers.  If it's the same session, lift first. If one is in the morning and one is in the afternoon, it doesn't matter. Move the strap higher. If it's still happening, look at getting the Polar FT4. It has a much more flexible strap than the plastic on the FT1. Seat pad I do 10-20 every 5 minutes."
Rowing,391dkf,lightweight-ish,2,Mon Jun 8 19:18:35 2015 UTC,"1) Try basing your steady state on % watts of 2k instead of heart rate (anywhere from 45%-55%) Heart rate zones are different for everyone. I just did a 10k at a 167, and I was definitely feeling it (usually steady state around 150) whereas some people's HR hits 160 as soon as the start pulling on the handle.   2) I would erg before lifting. I find that when I do deads or squats before erging, I feel really fatigued on the erg. To those saying that you don't want to be worn out from erging as it may impair lifting form, this is true, but your SS intensity shouldn't be so high that you feel worn out 6-10hours afterwards."

Sorry, I don't understand this part. Are you saying your normal % watt range for SS has your HR around 150, and your 10k at 167 caused you to 'feel it'?    Or are you saying that your % watt zone had a HR of 167 and you were feeling it, whereas 150 is the normal SS for most people?    If it's option 2, surely this goes against all schools of thought in the sense that you shouldn't have to work hard for SS?"
Rowing,391dkf,Patrikx,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:49:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry, that was kind of unclear because I left the ""I"" out of ""usually steady state around 150"". I usually pull my steady state around a HR of 150. This is a bit lower than most people, as I have many friends that are around 160-165 for steady state. To illustrate how HR zones vary from person to person, when I hit a 165 HR (like I did on the 10k I was doing yesterday), then I really feel like I'm working. As such, matching up my HR with the HR of others would definitely put me out of the target effort zone for steady state."
Rowing,391dkf,MightyLighty,3,Tue Jun 9 12:55:47 2015 UTC,One. Get a lactate tester so you can check your own lactate and see how that compares to your heart rate.   Five. Try different seats to see if you can find one you like. At one regatta the Croker rep was selling seat tops and some rowers tested out the different widths by sitting on them.   Six. It would be interesting to do some lactate testing on that to see what the change is by doing a test before and after the 10.
Rowing,391dkf,petersculls,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:03:27 2015 UTC,"Upgrade to the polar ft4. It has a completely flexible strap so its a lot more comfortable. Also, it is coded, so if you're in proximity to someone else with a HR monitor, it won't pick up their signal and give an inaccurate result."

For each race I have to lose 2-2.5 kg, I reduce that weight by eating pancakes and drinking water/tea. I like pancakes because they taste nicely and are easy to make and don't contain fibers, which increase water retention.  this is how my eating and drinking works when I race saturday:  wednesday: dont use to much sodium and drink 3-4L  Beginning at dinner you stop taking in sodium. I eat 4 pancakes at dinner (make pancake mix you rself so it does not have sodium in it).

Rowing,390uj3,abitofsky,3,Tue Jun 9 16:32:52 2015 UTC,"2kg above weight when you wake up in the morning? If so, then you'll be able to artificially drop the weight with no issues (as listed before- cut out sodium 48hrs prior, and drink lots of water, eat a lunch and dinner lower in carbs than usual the day before your weigh-in, and sweat row or cycle the morning of).   These methods (in tandem) can be used to cut about 1.5-2.5kg of weight with pretty much NO ill effects to performance. Test drive them later this week, as though you were about to weigh-in, just to make sure you know how you're going to feel.   Good luck!"
Rowing,390uj3,MightyLighty,3,Mon Jun 8 14:33:39 2015 UTC,"Do a sodium flush two days before (minimal sodium, 1oz water/kg of bodyweight), eat low residue foods the day before/day of weigh-in (google for list of conforming foods), and sweat row the morning of weigh-in (garbage bags and all).  I wish I could be more helpful, but I'm at work right now. Good luck!"
Rowing,390uj3,nish26,2,Mon Jun 8 14:13:07 2015 UTC,Start drinking a lot of water and do a sodium flush this alone will probably drop that weight. If you're still concerned you can start also eating more fruits and vegetables as a substitute for heavier foods like meats and carbs since these contain more water and will keep you more full while helping you cut. With the water thing try to drink close to 7 liters of water a day(2 gallons). This will keep you very full but you may put on some weight. But starting the day before you weigh in that morning cut your water intake to about 1/3 of this. This along with the sodium flush will make you excrete all this water and you will be well under weight. Just be smart if you need to sweat any weight since it is really bad for you. Look up some passive sweat techniques if you really want to.
Rowing,390uj3,BenW17,2,Mon Jun 8 15:28:48 2015 UTC,"there is nothing wrong with actively sweating. It has never been an issue for me, nor anyone I've raced with, so long as you keep it within reason. also adding a bunch of fiber to ones diet is horrible idea with only two weeks to go to race day, as fiber increases water retention."
Rowing,390uj3,624mark,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:52:12 2015 UTC,"Not that it is going to kill your race, but it has the potential to tire out your muscles and draw water from your muscle as opposed to passive sweating like sitting in a sauna or hot bath which will make you just sweat out excess water with minimal muscle use and loss of water in your muscles."
Rowing,390uj3,BenW17,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:40:44 2015 UTC,"having done both, theres nothing worse than passive sweating, psychologically, its a complete drain. you're just sitting there worrying whether you're going to be light enough in time, rather than actually working to get lighter. Plus, what race course has a sauna? you don't want to dehydrate too long before a race with a 2hr window. so something you can do, i.e. running or erging, at the race course is best, so you can hop right on the scale, and spend as little time as possible dehydrated."
Rowing,390uj3,624mark,-1,Mon Jun 8 17:53:02 2015 UTC,You're supposed to dehydrate the night before a weigh in passively so you can also weigh in yourself just to check. And how is frantically running around to cut weight before you race not mentally worse? Also if you dehydrate the day before as soon as you weigh in you can just drink water and be fine. I'm not saying dehydrate a lot either you don't want to dehydrate more than 4-5 pounds max 8 otherwise it is unsafe.
Rowing,390uj3,BenW17,3,Mon Jun 8 18:21:30 2015 UTC,"staying dehydrated for long periods of time is really really bad in my experience and is not something top lightweights do. at US national team trials, you'll see guys sweating out day of, no ones doing it night before. and dehydrating 8 pounds is insane. 2 kilos is the maximum safe amount with at 2hr window between weighing in and racing. you can't reabsorb more than that in 2 hours."
Rowing,390uj3,624mark,2,Mon Jun 8 18:27:19 2015 UTC,"if you're using a fisa weigh in protocol, (72.5 kg max for men, weigh in opens 2 hrs before race, closes 1hr before), 2kg is fine. Watch your sodium intake, like zero 2-3 days before race. Drink lots (1-2 gallons per day) of water until 12hrs before race (then zero, you should keep peeing it out), this should put you under 2kg over the morning of, then for the last little bit, layer up and go for a run to sweat it out. MAKE SURE YOURE DONE SWEATING BEFORE THE WEIGH IN OPENS. if you weigh-in right at 2hrs pre race, you have exactly enough time to re-hydrate effectively. you are down 2kg of water and need to put that much water back into your body. you can absorb 1kg of water per hour, so you need both of them. This is the strategy I've used my entire rowing career and its worked out very well for me, never missed a weigh in or had it affect the outcome of my race, despite having a natural weight more like 175."
Rowing,390uj3,624mark,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:50:09 2015 UTC,"Assuming your weigh in is on Saturday, here's what you do. On Sunday, double your water intake. Wednesday, cut sodium. Keep the water doubled through Thursday. Weigh in on Friday morning gauge from there how much you can eat/drink that day. At this point, calories don't matter, but the physical weight of the food does. Aim to be fewer than 1.5 pounds over by the time you go to bed and you should be good to go.  Also, keep in mind that it is better to eat more and drink less the day before. You can replace a decent amount of water before your race, but your body won't be able to digest enough carbs in time to be as close to 100% as you can be before your race."
Rowing,390uj3,lightweight-ish,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:29:23 2015 UTC,"Welcome in the sometimes frustrating but often awesome world of being a Lwt!  First: many people confuse losing weight for racing day with losing weight in the long run. If you want the latter- find a nice diet :). In short: you want to get rid of all the water in your body by cutting sodium intake.   My plan is about the same as paulvvh has stated. Do note that it will only work for a couple of days. Don't start cutting sodium earlier in the week as your body will adapt. Also: the results vary per person, it highly depends on your regular sodium intake.  Week before a race on saturday:  Mon / Tue: As usual. Wed: Double your water intake (3/4L) Thu: No more sodium (there is sodium in pretty much everything, so be prepared to spend more time on cooking! Watch out for pretty much anything you did not make yourself), at least double water intake. Fri: No sodium, at least double water intake, eat food that will give you lots of energy without weighing too much. Pancakes with syrup are fine.  Stop drinking water 12-14 hours before weigh-in. This should do it, easily. Still have problems? Slow steady state on the erg with as many (rain) clothes as you have to sweat untill you reach your target weight.   If you have more than 2kg to go, or are not as sensitive to the sodium-free diet.. Do all of the above but from wednesday on: cut as many fibers from your diet as possible. No big salads, whole weat bread/pasta.."
Rowing,3916kt,ThunerboltRiley,5,Mon Jun 8 14:29:10 2015 UTC,"I'm a strength coach for my university (club) team and don't use any Olympic lifts besides the high pull for my guys.  Cons of the O lifts   Triple extension is extension of the hip, knee, and ankle joints and is a huge part of the O lift, but not at all a part of rowing (unless you catch a monster crab!) They are vertically-oriented, rowing is horizontally-oriented, so the upper body action in particular is different and hip extension is severely limited in rowing. They're technical and take time to instruct to do them correctly with near constant coaching and oversight even after the initial instruction. With any lifting, there is an injury risk, so I want my lifting to be as simple as possible so my guys can master a lift and get full benefit from it with minimal injury risk.   Pros of the O lifts   Power development once you are proficient enough in the lift to go heavy enough to develop power You could argue ""develop muscular coordination"" here, but I'd counter that it's more of displaying muscular coordination as I'm not convinced that O lifts inherently develop muscular coordination.   Any athlete time that I take is time that the HC doesn't get on the water or that the rowers don't get to go home and eat/sleep/recover. With this in mind, there are plenty of other exercises that can develop power in the weight room more safely and simply to save athlete time for the water/recovery.   Other exercises you can do to develop lower body power   Clean High Pull the simplest Oly lift and the only Oly lift I use Regular squats/deadlifts Speed squats and speed deadlifts/block pulls   Realistically, if your lifting numbers on squat/deadlift are accurate, you're as strong as you need to be for rowing aka the point of diminishing returns. Gains from here are going to come from speed endurance (how consistently you can maintain your power output) and technique, not necessarily from pushing your max higher. PM me and we can talk programming if you'd like. NSCA-CSCS, USAW1, BS Kinesiology if you care.  Editing to add that the coaches and athletes who are pro-Oly lifts tend to be already proficient in the lifts before coming to rowing. They already have the form down and are able to go heavy enough to truly develop power, which might lead some to believe that Oly lifts develop power in and of themselves. Realistically, it can take several weeks to months of coaching time to get someone good enough at the lifts to go heavy safely and effectively. Once you're there, sure, they can be useful, but I'd rather that my athlete spend those weeks to months on the erg, water, or squat rack."
Rowing,3916kt,exlaxbros,7,Mon Jun 8 16:29:58 2015 UTC,"I completely agree (also CSCS, masters in Ex. Sci).  Focus on the big three lifts (squat, bench, deadlift) for gains and then add in supplemental work around those.  The program I ran my collegiate guys through this last year had zero power work, but lots of heavy lifting, mobility and flexibility and tons of hamstring/glute strengthening work.    I can snatch and clean no problem.  My clean PR is 245lb, 225lb with the jerk.  Snatch is only 175lb.  I know that in the limited time given to me as a strength coach, plus the generally fatigued state my athletes are in, I will never be able to both properly instruct them on form and get their load up high enough that it's beneficial.  Something like a loaded jump squat or a bench pull is much more intuitive - and the bench pull is so applicable to the sport.  If you were to only have two exercises available to most benefit your rowing, I would say the deadlift and partner hyperextension would be the most valuable.  Bench pull and squats right after that.  If nothing else, the squat reveals which rowers are generally capable of supporting load and even though the drive is horizontal, you are still supporting a load through a closed kinetic chain.  Instabilities at a joint, or the lack of mobility at a joint during the squat usually indicates that someone has to compensate coming up the slide on the water."
Rowing,3916kt,husky_notbigboned,2,Tue Jun 9 12:40:23 2015 UTC,"My numbers are high because I'm short. I'm 65 inches tall. I have big torso so my body can handle a rather larger back load and my legs are short so they can also handle a larger load.  In terms of building a program, I need erg time. So I wanted to build my max weights which I can do pretty well, and then maintain weight through the season.  What is the best way to maintain weight?   I have struggled with this the most. Currently I squat, bench, barbell row, power clean, overhead press, and deadlift. I split between two days and I do a good bit of accessory work on top of all that for each lift ending up with two 3 hour lifting sessions.  I row/erg the rest.  When I go to maintain, I really want to be able to stick my workout to two ~90min or less lifting sessions and be able to workout hard the next mornings on the erg or water.  Thank you so much for the reply."
Rowing,3916kt,OARneryRower,3,Mon Jun 8 20:00:10 2015 UTC,"From your numbers it sounds like strength is not your limiting factor. What can you do for a max drag test? If the watts on your 2k are less than 50% of your watts on a max drag test, you probably want to focus your energies on improving aerobic fitness and technique. Time on the water > time on the erg > time on the bike/running."
Rowing,3916kt,NeedsmoreCELLTECH,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:13:46 2015 UTC,"My max watt is somewhere around 750, depending on the drag factor. It's just my short stroke that limits me so much.

What are some advanced ways to gain flexibility that directly correlates to achieving a greater arc length in the boat?   My lay back is excessive and I match most at the catch with some curvature in my back. I know the ideal is little lay back and good posture at the catch so already I'm off, but I find if I can do it without disturbing the flow then I can make a positive change to the boat-increasing boat speed."

Rowing,3916kt,polyfonik,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:15:04 2015 UTC,"You're strong enough. You could quit all weight lifting for a year and still be strong enough for your lifts not to be your limiting factor.  If rowing is your top priority:   Go lightweight. 6'1 - 6'2 is borderline light/heavy, your height is clearly decent lightweight material and coming with your strength and erg score you'll be a beast. Stop lifting for now and just scull/erg.   If it's a nice side-thing, and you really like weight-lifting for its own sake and would do it regardless..   Get a strength coach who knows rowing, or failing that Go into higher rep ranges and build power-endurance. Train with 1-3 sets of 15-35 reps with a weight that feels natural. Do high boxjumps and plyometrics to develop explosiveness and quickness."

I meant that anyone under 6'2 should consider going lightweight (doesn't necessarily make sense for your body type or rowing goals/life goals). Anyone that much under 6'2 should be lightweight, at least from a rowing perspective.   My former heavyweight pairs partner, at 6'1, went from a decent 98kg rower to a beastly 72.5 kg rower."

Rowing,3916kt,captiancurtains,0,Wed Jun 10 14:35:02 2015 UTC,"Cleans are very different from DL or squat. It takes a lot of training to get them heavy. Cleans will help with speed and power, but they shouldn't be done heavy.   You should be able to catch the weight mostly standing. A bit of knee bend is fine, but try to focus on making it one movement. You shouldn't be catching the weight in a deep squat.  Focus on speed and technique. Those are going to give you the power and speed you need more than the raw strength that you can get from DL or squat."
Rowing,3916kt,archane,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:53:12 2015 UTC,"Umm...cleans should absolutely be done heavy, granted your form is good."
Rowing,3916kt,captiancurtains,2,Mon Jun 8 14:56:19 2015 UTC,"I'm saying it shouldn't be so heavy for you that you can't catch it standing. Cleans aren't essential for rowing, so it's better to use them as a speed/power movement over a strength movement. The risk of injury is lower and teaches your muscles how to fire faster and harder."
Rowing,3916kt,archane,2,Mon Jun 8 15:00:43 2015 UTC,"Practicing going speed/power at a lighter weight is not going to build speed or power.  And the clean is applicable to rowing because rowing is a sport that requires power. The reason the power clean is so applicable is it's a scalable way to develop power.  There will be a weight OP can handle correctly, however heavy, that can be slowly increased resulting in more power development.   In rowing you need to be able to exert a force rapidly, so your force curve is a spike in the beginning at the catch. The power clean will directly help with this."
Rowing,3916kt,acunc,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:45:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it's not applicable, it's not essential. Meaning you don't have to do them to be fast. Doing heavy cleans with bad form is a good way to get hurt.  I'm saying to do them in a way where your not sacraficing speed for weight. I'm not saying he should be doing 70lbs really quickly. Rather use a weight that can be handled quickly and doesn't sacrifice technique."

Rowing,390uem,Thatotherhippy,6,Mon Jun 8 12:45:49 2015 UTC,The announcer at the 2011 US Club Nationals stated in the JM2X race that you burn as much energy in a 2000 meter race as two full games of basketball. I don't know where the announcer got it from. Anyway it goes back at least to 2011.
Rowing,390uem,petersculls,6,Mon Jun 8 15:39:11 2015 UTC,"That's an even worse thing to say. If by ""burn energy"" he meant ""calories"" (which is the only thing he could have meant) then it's not even close. You really don't burn all that many calories over a 2k, considering it's over in 5-8 minutes."

Rowing,390uem,ekacnap,0,Mon Jun 8 20:28:00 2015 UTC,"Ya, it cant possibly be correct because 2k are fairly anerobic, last i check the estimate was you couldnt burn much more than 200 calories during your race which could in no way measure up to aerobics of 2 basketball games. Maybe its purely on the strain experienced by all your muscles to where your muscles will be strained/ damaged to a point similar to after a basketball game?"
Rowing,390uem,acunc,17,Mon Jun 8 22:42:13 2015 UTC,That's a meaningless and stupid comparison to try to make. There is no proof and I have no idea who came up with it or why/how.
Rowing,390uem,FatherSonBrolySpirit,6,Mon Jun 8 12:49:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Hitting failure in only 6 minutes has with it that desperation of lactic acid setting in and literally having nothing left. It's not exhaustion per say, but you have literally nothing left from exerting so much in such a small frame of time. On the other hand, 2 back to back basketball games sounds like it would induce a sort of exhaustion but it is definitely not like a 2k"
Rowing,390uem,abitofsky,10,Mon Jun 8 12:55:46 2015 UTC,"The phrase appears in Boys in the Boat   When you row, the major muscles in your arms, legs, and back — particularly the quadriceps, biceps, deltoids latissimus dorsi, abdominals, hamstrings, and gluteal muscles — do most of the grunt work, propelling the boat forward against the unrelenting resistance of water and wind. At the same time, scores of smaller muscles in the neck, wrists, hands, and even feet continually fine-tune your efforts, holding the body in constant equipoise in order to maintain the exquisite balance necessary to keep a twenty-four-inch-wide vessel — roughly the width of a man’s waist — on an even keel. The result of all this muscular effort, both on the larger scale and the smaller, is that your body burns calories and consumes oxygen at a rate that is unmatched in almost any other human endeavor. Physiologists, in fact, have calculated that rowing a two-thousand meter race — the Olympic standard — takes the same physiological toll as playing two basketball games back-to-back. And it exacts that toll in about six minutes.  http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/an-oarsman-is-a-verb-meaning-to-row/   Which physiologists calculated that? I have no idea. I don't even know if this is the first place it appears.  It also pops up on US Rowing's Quick Facts page   Physiologists claim that rowing a 2,000-meter race - equivalent to 1.25 miles - is equal to playing back-to-back basketball games.  http://www.usrowing.org/about/rowing101/quickfacts   They again cite these mythical ""physiologists.""  And here's Resolute Racing using it again: https://twitter.com/resoluteracing/status/468770743380369409  I think it's just something someone at one point said, and it's just been repeated along using only the justification that ""physiologists claim."""

Rowing,38wrfw,Timothy_Claypole,2,Sun Jun 7 22:39:22 2015 UTC,"I have no idea, but I would imagine the easiest options are cameras at the start, at the markers, in the umpire boats and some extras around the finish. There will be commentary because I know some of the RegattaRadio people applied.   TBH, I don't think you'd need much more for now. I'm not even sure there'll be any extra padding with an on-screen presenter, interviews etc. I think the key audience ATM is the rowing community around the world, rather than all & sundry BBC-style.

Rowing,38xbrn,determinator007,3,Mon Jun 8 14:27:31 2015 UTC,"Belen's got fast erg scores and they row well together, especially at the start of races.  Generally they seem to appear as though they're going to demolish the competition at Youths because they race slower scholastic teams all year and no one knows how to compare their 1500m times to everyone elses' 2k times.    Basically, this year isn't much different from last year.  If Belen can hold on for the whole 2k with the same vigor and form that they begin with, then they've got a solid chance, but if history is any indicator then they'll likely have trouble."

Rowing,38wras,DRower8,5,Sun Jun 7 14:18:44 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the event... I'd say that there are Canadian heavyweight boats that could give some of the top American schools a run for their money (e.g. the Shawnigan eight this year), but in the lightweight events, schools like Belen would give us a royal ass whooping. It's also hard to compare the two seeing as almost all Canadian races are 2ks, whereas my impression is that most American scholastic races are 1500m.  Edit: The UCC lights beat the Canisius lights by 21 seconds at CSSRAs today, so if anyone raced against them at SRAAs, that's how the cream of Canada's lightweight crop stacks up."
Rowing,38wras,lebleugar,2,Sun Jun 7 16:39:01 2015 UTC,You have to remember though that lightweight at CSSRA is 150 vs 158 at CSSRA. The American lightweight teams are at a huge weight disadvantage against Canadian teams.
Rowing,38wras,lebleugar,2,Sun Jun 7 17:06:50 2015 UTC,"While that's true to an extent, 8 pounds does not a 21 second gap make. It's also impossible to say whether or not American crews are still racing as 150 lights by the time that they get up here two weeks post-SRAAs."
Rowing,38wras,jaredl77,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:02:12 2015 UTC,but 8 pounds x 8 people is 64 pounds... THAT can make a difference.

Rowing,38wo92,theicemanguy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:57:42 2015 UTC,"I don't actually agree with this. Harvard looked reasonably well connected - laying back a bunch is not the same thing as rowing longer. They did not row particularly poorly. Yale were significantly more powerful, rated 2 beats higher (you're never going to be in the race if you're underrating a more powerful crew by 2 beats down the track), and raced with much greater tactical nous."
Rowing,38wo92,kickAhoeNdaFace,2,Sun Jun 7 16:00:43 2015 UTC,"Yea, I don't think Harvard looked that bad by comparison but like I said in my earlier comment, the lower stroke rate was doing nothing for them. I don't know how much they changed the lineup between what they had at IRAs and now but I imagine it's still a relatively young crew so that probably played a part in it too. Not to take anything away from Yale though, they looked pretty damn good from start to finish. /u/MtcGoodman's finishes = ridiculous."

Those boats could have thrown down at youths had they made the trip. Undoubtedly the biggest question mark will be Gonzaga's ability to adjust from 1500m to 2000. I am not so sure 3 weeks of training will be enough to serve them well for this regatta. Gonzaga will still do well -- this year's crew has easily handled WP (who beat Sarasota) both match-ups this season -- but the change in course length leaves me unsure if they can go top 3. Do not sleep on them, however."
Rowing,38v6sl,TITZnASSS,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:49:52 2015 UTC,"If you compare Gonzaga crews to crews at Youths using teams that they beat as constants, last year's crew was probably the fastest considering they beat a Central boat by 5 seconds that was 5 seconds out of 1st at Youths. So, mathematically (one race being 1500 and the other 2k), they would've gotten 1st or 2nd last year. That being said, rowing isn't done on paper, and it has yet to be seen if the scholastic teams can adjust to 2ks after racing 1500s all year long. I actually wonder why that crew didn't make an attempt to go to Youths or Henley. This year I certainly have my doubts that they can compete with Oakland's beastly squad, but I think they'll be in the running for a medal. Also, I very much appreciate your name haha"

Rowing,38s6lf,kitd,12,Sat Jun 6 17:35:53 2015 UTC,"Single scullers IMHO have a much better appreciation of how their momentum interacts with that of the boat. They tend to sweep with greater poise and body control, generally resulting in a faster boat.  I suspect that the same would be true for sweepers who have spent the vast majority of their time in pairs from the outset.  In summary, it's the big boats that dull a rower's sense of boatmanship."

From experience I have found easier to learn how to sweep, my first day out my coach informed me that I have near perfect form with no instruction, granted this is after three years of sculling. Neither is necessarily better each have their pros and cons but scullers have been known to go faster against sweepers in sweep events.

But really, if you have the strength and fitness, and you have the flexibility to get the right arc length, technically there's no dealbreaker.

The body is part of the level too, and if you're knees come up too high in relation to your body (at the catch), then you can't maintain full body length. this is easily fixed by lowering the feet or raising the seat, which would make it a less horizontal stroke. Short torso does give the benefit of less weight though. I wouldn't say having a proportionally short torso is problematic, I just don't think it's beneficial?"

Rowing,38oygk,stevenson44,0,Fri Jun 5 22:11:02 2015 UTC,"well it really doesn't. Rowing is all about power (assuming technique and everything else is equal) it's just more likely that a 6'5""+  is more likely to pull 500W for a 2k . If you found a 5'0"" person pulling 500W 2k and a 6'5"" with the same power and weight. With the right rigging they'd go about the same speed if not faster (depending on the wind)  there are quite a few very successful rowers who are ""short"" by rowing standards but they also have monster erg scores"
Rowing,38oygk,wildhnybadger,2,Sat Jun 6 00:17:57 2015 UTC,I agree with you. My opinion comes from seeing shorter rowers getting cut regardless of scores the further I progress in the sport. I've noticed that 6'1 is sort of like a minimum/too short to be put in certain boats.
Rowing,38oygk,stevenson44,2,Sat Jun 6 03:52:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. It's true there is a minimum because the faster boats are usually made up of taller guys so when a short guy pulls a bigger erg he still won't be put on because his height disrupts the flow. If faster boats were made up of 5'5-5'10 guys, a 6'3+ with a bigger erg wouldn't be put on because he would do the same as the shorter guy previously."
Rowing,38oygk,ThunerboltRiley,2,Sat Jun 6 04:06:13 2015 UTC,"You can't assume same technique though... taller = more leverage, it's simply not possible for a shorter person to get the same arc, without either sacrificing efficiency (e.g. going past vertical shins) or moving the pin closer (which makes it heavier). You simply can't assume everything else is equal unfortunately.   At the same time, it's a sport where having the right mentality and technique have a huge effect, so it's not selective to the point where you have to be a specific size, you just have to be within a range."
Rowing,38oygk,coxcoxcox,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:28:33 2015 UTC,"Actually taller =/= better technique all the time.

Rowing,38oygk,coxcoxcox,0,Sun Jun 7 12:36:48 2015 UTC,"I think you're mistaken. taller does NOT equal more leverage if anything taller = less leverage. rigging can be accommodated for any rower by either changing the inboard, outboard ratio , have shorter inboards for people with short arms , change the span of the pins , change the blade area or if they are really short making a custom sized boat or something.   the reason why a taller rowers fare better is usually because they can produce more power (larger heart + lungs + more muscle mass ) and because rowing isn't a direct correlation between power to weight  it benefits them.   If you can produce power + have good OTW technique height is irrelevant. OTW you only need to acheive a certain ARC (measured in degrees or radians aka dimensionless NOT cm)  by your logic lightweight women  would NEVER be able to reach proper catch and finish angles which is complete bullshit. However they do produce much less power than the male counter parts and are therefore slower  edit: oh and while I'm here i'd like to address the issue of shorter rowers with taller rowers. easiest example is the Danish lwt double Mads Rasmussen( 1.83m) and his partner Rasmus Quist (1.73m)  so they are 10cm apart in height yet they still manage to win an Olympic gold medal a long with being very successful rowers altogether  TL;DR: height doesn't matter but it usually corresponds to more power = more speed"

Any of the adjustments you mentioned DO allow shorter rowers to get ideal length, but would also increase how 'heavy' it feels, which means you would need to make corresponding adjustments (shortening the outboard/oar length) to bring it back to the same load. Shortening the ootboard = shorter arc.  In lightweight rowing it's pretty common to have height differences, because you have one person who provides length, and one who provides power. Because of the weight limit, the taller person simply won't be able to have the same amount of muscle as the shorter one, and the shorter one's rigging will allow them to have the same length, with greater loading. Obviously some crews are very evenly sized, both ways can work."

I think you just explained it well there yourself.  moving the pins in gives an increase in catch angle , following the 1/cos relation allows for more ""gearing"" - hence allows for more blade loading.    Shortening the ootboard = shorter arc.   This is true, but it doesn't really affect overall speed.  If it did then all rowers rowing at the same rate with the same oars would go the same speed. which isn't the case because of drive speed (which ultimately comes down to power).   In lightweight rowing it's pretty common to have height differences, because you have one person who provides length, and one who provides power.

Rowing,38oygk,wildhnybadger,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:21:05 2015 UTC,"More blade loading isn't always a good thing. If it was, we'd all be going out to buy infinitely long oars, and cutting our inboards in half.   Shorter arc DOES matter, that doesn't mean that power doesn't. Obviously someone rowing with length, but little power, will go slower than someone rowing short but with power haha. If two rowers could produce the same force, but one was doing it for longer, the one doing it for longer would go further.  And no, it doesn't prove your point, because lighties have a limitation. So you can choose to put together a crew of equal height and power, but you will get neither ideal (relative to the crew) length or power. Or you can put together a crew where they are not matched evenly, but you get both ideal length and power. It's just not a valid argument for 'height doesn't matter', because in lightweight rowing there is a trade-off between height and power, whereas there isn't in heavyweight.  If you still don't understand, I think we can just agree to disagree here?"
Rowing,38oygk,coxcoxcox,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:20:32 2015 UTC,"blade loading (a front loaded stroke) is always a good thing. but yes you're right blade loading(having too much of a gearing effect isn't always a good thing).   sorry your arguments really aren't convincing.   Obviously someone rowing with length, but little power, will go slower than someone rowing short but with power haha   Exactly. So the determining factor is power.    If two rowers could produce the same force, but one was doing it for longer, the one doing it for longer would go further.   Joules = (Force) x (meters) so of course if they produce the same force one would go further because he's doing more work and at the same stroke rate that also means more power surprise surprise  lightweight rowing isn't a trade-off between height and power it's a  physical cap on power. there is no ""Ideal length"" length doesn't move the boat, power does. Of course power is a combination between Force x length / time. Time will correlate with force since for any given rower their stroke length is fixed  and will then be due to the acceleration of the stretcher + handles"
Rowing,38oygk,wildhnybadger,-2,Mon Jun 8 13:55:25 2015 UTC,i still saw that slouching isnt that bad if you're just starting out because you get more resistance and you get stronger faster and you can also learn that its not good in the long run but also makes you daster :))) glad this helps
