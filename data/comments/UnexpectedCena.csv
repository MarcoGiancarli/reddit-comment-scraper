Since it wasn't mod-approved, he didn't get banned, but he did go over there.   The other guy straight up lost his bet, he did get banned for 3 days"

Isn't that kind of the point of these videos, though? The people who upload these to youtube give their videos discreet titles and purposefully mess with the audio levels to make the viewer max out your volume (then of course comes the inevitable ultra compressed +100 gain John Cena clip).

UnexpectedCena,3c0bgd,The_Magic,4,Sat Jul 4 22:06:26 2015 UTC,This is my new favorite subreddit.
UnexpectedCena,3c0bgd,Ghetto_Alchemist,2,Tue Jul 7 02:28:27 2015 UTC,Definitely not bombs in the 1940's
UnexpectedCena,3c0bgd,20inones,2,Thu Jul 16 07:40:54 2015 UTC,we beat japan on sunday night at soccer
UnexpectedCena,3c0bgd,frederickdiggory,-2,Tue Jul 7 16:32:34 2015 UTC,The women's World Cup final
UnexpectedCena,3c1hs3,ignika98,5,Fri Jul 3 22:08:04 2015 UTC,... That was deeper than expected...
UnexpectedCena,3c1hs3,BayLeaf-,5,Sun Jul 5 12:04:10 2015 UTC,Clearly you haven't actually watched Evangelion.
UnexpectedCena,3c1hs3,killthealias,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:47:58 2015 UTC,Not in the slightest!
UnexpectedCena,3c1hs3,BayLeaf-,2,Tue Jul 7 19:46:40 2015 UTC,"Dude, watch it! Great show.  But watched it subbed. Please, for the love of god, watch it subbed."

UnexpectedCena,3c3e7a,Remmyram,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:11:01 2015 UTC,It would probably taste like rancid potato salad.
UnexpectedCena,3c0xej,TheRedTurtleShell,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:26:25 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness, who can watch these shows? That was such an over the top reaction."
UnexpectedCena,3bx0fa,ffngg,2,Thu Jul 2 21:11:14 2015 UTC,"saw this in /r/montageparodies first, so it truly was an unexpected john cena"
UnexpectedCena,3bw8uh,IntergalacticRice,-9,Thu Jul 2 17:45:28 2015 UTC,"its way too loud and distorted to even make out ""cena"", turn that volume level down seriously."
UnexpectedCena,3bw8uh,HowlingPantherWolf,21,Thu Jul 2 17:54:48 2015 UTC,The louder and more distored the better.
UnexpectedCena,3bw8uh,BennyTheBomb,0,Thu Jul 2 21:49:34 2015 UTC,"Like HowlingPantherWolf expressed, a few subscribers and potential visitors are saying they are getting tired of it rather quickly. I sent a PM to you about it and also posted a sticky asking for opinions on the subject."

UnexpectedCena,3bgb00,420assblaster69,11,Sun Jun 28 23:41:30 2015 UTC,I did not think my speakers could go that loud jesus fuck
UnexpectedCena,3bgb00,notverycreative1,4,Mon Jun 29 02:11:01 2015 UTC,always put your volume on 1 when browsing unexpected cena lol
UnexpectedCena,3bgapn,Rabaxis,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:38:52 2015 UTC,Wow Ben. Nice vid.
UnexpectedCena,3b0ubc,420assblaster69,10,Thu Jun 25 01:44:01 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or is the distorted sound the unfunny part of these?  It works on the montage parodies but it's not the reason John Cena is funny, especially when it gets pushed to unlistenable levels.  I have a degree in memology."
UnexpectedCena,3b0ubc,ithinkimtim,6,Thu Jun 25 09:01:36 2015 UTC,"Agree with you, no need to be excessively loud."
UnexpectedCena,3aycmh,secretholder,6,Wed Jun 24 14:14:31 2015 UTC,What a brave guy. Props to him

UnexpectedCena,3apu8m,ffngg,5,Mon Jun 22 15:07:45 2015 UTC,"When you link the video anywhere they title it as ""My Name is John Cena"" and that kinda takes a way from the unexpected part. :<"
UnexpectedCena,3ah8s0,Anthrex,18,Sat Jun 20 04:01:58 2015 UTC,"I like to think that under every drawing of a girl anime character, there is a layer that is just John Cena."
