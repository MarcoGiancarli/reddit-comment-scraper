Triumph,3e2vk6,Scramby900,2,Tue Jul 21 15:17:44 2015 UTC,QQ:  Are you unable to put saddle bags on the Triumph Scrambler due to its exhaust?  Thinking about picking one up this/next week...  Thanks!
Triumph,3e2vk6,KirbyinAustin,2,Tue Jul 21 21:54:15 2015 UTC,Not sure about bags (doubt it because its not offered on the triumph website) but you can get the seat with the rack on the back so you would be able to strap a pack to it with ease.
Triumph,3e2vk6,ARedditingRedditor,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:11:29 2015 UTC,I believe you can put one the side without exhaust. I've seen other scramblers with one.

Triumph,3e41yx,anthony412,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:56:32 2015 UTC,I've got nothing but good things to say about these guys. Ken in particular has been a big help making sure I'm getting the right parts. They've even sent me some specific screws I was looking for for free. They are fairly expensive but the products are high quality. Enough so that I just invested in their performance package for my 2013 bonneville.
Triumph,3e41yx,Bailulus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:19:23 2015 UTC,"Get in contact with them, i would say that one or more of the parts are on back order but they haven't told you.  I had a bit of trouble with some parts.  Their stock levels were all wrong, shipping was slow and communication took days.  When they did eventually get back to me they were apologetic, helpful and refunded quickly.  I ended up getting the same parts from Revzilla for the same price.  The parts are great and the people are great.  I would say that they might be experiencing an increase in demand for their parts and having trouble keeping up."

Triumph,3dztz7,cptncrypto,6,Mon Jul 20 21:32:40 2015 UTC,"Bell helmet here. I haven't had that problem personally. Especially when I had the stock lollipop mirrors on. As far as the gauges, I couldn't tell you to be honest. I'm always shifting my head and eyes around every 3-5 seconds to make sure I'm aware of my surroundings and I don't fixate on any one target. So I do naturally tilt my head as I look down. When I ride home here in a bit, I'll try and see if I notice anything when I ride.  Also, if you doubt your helmet fit, you should be able to go into any decent motorcycle store and ask them to review the fit of your helmet. Just say something along the lines of, ""Hey, I'm a new rider and I wanted to make sure my helmet fit was safe and proper."" No one will say no to that."
Triumph,3dztz7,minus0,2,Mon Jul 20 21:41:46 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to add that it can depend on how tall you are. I'm fairly little, and haven't had this problem with the mirrors on any bikes but I couldn't see the clocks on my TT600 without looking wearing an Arai. I can imagine something like the ST, which is quite small (in size only I might add), with a tall rider, might make things difficult. You could try swapping your mirrors out, if they are folding have a play and see if you can get an idea of where you would rather they were. The clocks, for me, are something you consciously check and once you get used to the bike, the engine and how fast it goes and what it sounds like in each gear, you'll only want to take a peek at the speedo when you're in towns/near speed cameras/the police. And to make sure the oil light hasn't come on, as it is a Triumph. :)  And I also wanted to echo what minus0 said about your lid. If you're not 100% sure, get someone at a good dealership to check it for you - they will be happy to do this. I was always told it should move the skin on your face left and right, and up and down, without being uncomfortable, and with the chinstrap done up tight barely move on your noggin at all - but all without being uncomfortable. Crushed ears after a few hours on the motorway is just excruciating. It's really important to get it right, a helmet which moves around on your head can be dangerous for obvious reasons in a crash, and less obvious reasons i.e. getting pulled up over your face by the wind at speed!"
Triumph,3dztz7,easywormfood,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:57:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies!  I'm also a short rider at 5'7"" so it's not a height thing. The mirrors are stock, and not seeing them is my biggest issue. The gauges would be nice to see, but like you said, looking at them is more of a conscious effort and isn't as big of a deal.  I believe my helmet fits well as far as safety, but the chin part of it seems to angle higher than I'd like, which blocks a lot of my lower vision. I'll make it a point to try on helmets the next time I'm at another dealer, and specifically any Bell helmets they have."
Triumph,3dztz7,minus0,2,Mon Jul 20 22:13:57 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I hate my Bell Vortex. Worst helmet I've owned. I actually just ordered a Schuberth c3 pro since I wanted something quieter for my commute. But check out the Shoei rf1200 or the Scorpion line as well. Also remember that safety is about vision just as much about fit."

Triumph,3dztz7,minus0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:58:37 2015 UTC,Interesting and good to know. I have a buddy who is your height that has taken my bike for a spin but never said anything about that. Definitely worthwhile data point.
Triumph,3dztz7,easywormfood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:03 2015 UTC,"It might be that the fit is too 'high' perhaps? I would say the top of visor should be level with the eyebrows, and the chin bar well around the chin, if a little below. Some helmets have much bigger chin bars, often the cheaper a helmet is, the bulkier and heavier it might be because of the materials used, but you said you tried an Arai are pretty top-end. Shoei are awesome too. Like minus0 said above, safety is just as much about vision as it is fit and helmet make, performance, comfort."
Triumph,3dztz7,minus0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:32:04 2015 UTC,"I think you're right about the fit being too ""high"". The top of the visor is well above my eyebrows and the chin bar barely covers the bottom of my chin, if that. I didn't ride today or I would post a picture of the fit, in case that would be helpful.  Thanks again for all the replies so far. I've googled this a ton but couldn't find anything."

I have bar end mirrors and had to tilt my head backwards to not be able to see them or the instruments. Now viewing angle on the bar ends is different than the stock lollipops, but I can still see them in my view. With the lollipops, I never had a problem at all."

I know your new and you're worried about what gear your in or rpms, etc. but keep your head up, that split second you look down is important to your reaction time. Use your ears and ass to feel out what she's doing.  Secondly it's pretty normal to have to move around to use your mirrors. On my Daytona I have to physically move my upper body/arms to use them. Personally I just turn my head."

In both my Shoei RF1200 and AGV K4 Evo, I can see the gauges by moving my eyes but I typically move my head if I'm not just trying to get a quick glance at speed/RPM.  I've tried bar end and regular mirrors on this thing, in all cases I've had to move my head. I make a pretty good habit of turning my whole head to see behind me before changing lanes/etc. anyway so I don't mind."
Triumph,3dztz7,aDDnTN,2,Tue Jul 21 05:04:27 2015 UTC,"On a bike you need to keep your head on a swivel anyway, and get used to watching both sides of the road as well as mirrors and such.

Triumph,3djigr,TridesH,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:02:59 2015 UTC,Evans peak is closed for the current season but I would imagine that you could downshift on your way down to take some of the strain off the breaks.

Triumph,3diw2w,minus0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:27:47 2015 UTC,"I have almost 22k miles on my bike (sold my car since I never drove it after getting the bike). I've done a few thousand total miles with a passenger.  I've done plenty of 3+ hour trips with a passenger as well. In my case the passengers were always 100-120 pounds (just worked out that way).  Out biggest issues we face are:   Our suspension systems weren't really meant for everyday riding for people of our weight class. I've noticed an increase sag when riding and need to readjust my suspension. In talking with my dealership they have recommended getting stronger springs to properly account for my weight + luggage of the every day use. Every bike has a max allowed weight. I don't have my specs off hand, but the simplest thing to do is see what the tires are rated for with it's max weight, minus the bike's wet weight, minus rider(s) + gear+ luggage. I think mine is something like this (all rough numbers): 800 lbs max weight on tires - 400 lbs wet weight - 230 lbs for me - 10 pounds for gear. That gives me 160 lbs. to play with for either luggage, a passenger, or both.  I have rode fairly aggressive with a passenger on the bike with no problem but it took my skill set improving (added weight makes a difference) along with their skill set of being a ""good"" passenger."

But if I go flat on the tank, my head is above or in front of the speedometer.   The reality of the situation is, yes, your legs will get uncomfortable at times. But stretching them out or standing up is a quick fix. I've done 8 hour straight trips with no real problems. I also do plenty of stretching while riding though to make sure I stay ahead of any problems. As a tall person, its better than being a car with no ability to stretch. In fact, I would put it in this order (worst to best): Flying Coach, back seat of a car, front seat (unless I can really stretch out), Street Triple.

The street triple is a 675 cc engine, it's much lighter, easier to throw around in the corners and more geared for city riding. The speed is a 1050cc, with a higher seating position (I think), much more torque and is better for longer rides/interstate. I personally got the speed because my previous bike was a gsxr 600 and I didn't want anything less for power than what that had."

Triumph,3dicth,jjanzer,2,Thu Jul 16 16:00:27 2015 UTC,"Seems like a decent price to me. Predators are pretty popular and pretty expensive ($500-$700), I have them on my bike and I wish they were a little quieter. I'm guessing the dealer mapped it properly (probably the arrow 2->1 map?) so you shouldn't have to muck around with that (tuneecu if you want to).  The stock suspension is pretty lackluster, so, provided they didn't screw anything up I would definitely understand them completely swapping it out. It's unclear if they replaced the rear suspension but if they haven't I would recommend doing something to match so your suspension/handling is correct (maybe see a suspension shop?). There are a million options for rear suspensions as bonnevilles are really popular for modding though.  As for dirt? The bike sits very low and the suspension travel is very poor in stock (especially the front with their garbage springs), not sure how a cbr600f would affect it for dirt. I don't like riding my bonneville in dirt/grass, it seems to handle poorly on it or taking it over small lips (eg: grass->driveway). That said I have street tires so I'm sure knobbies work way better. I think the scrambler is very close in height but the pipe sits up much higher. Bonnevilles have a pretty low pipe (it's as high up as the rear axle) and I could see it getting very beat up on rocks, branches, etc. There is also some chrome on the bike and I'm guessing you'll start getting rust from all the nicks (predators are stainless steel btw). However I can easily stand up on the bike when going over odd bits, but I'm pretty short (5'6"").  I love my bike for the street, but I don't love taking it on dirt. It's also very expensive for parts and the parts take FOREVER to ship (you probably want to pick up a spare clutch/brake lever). The clutch is very easy to work though which makes it a bit easier to handle there."

Triumph,3dicth,quattromila,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:36:20 2015 UTC,The stock front suspension (rear too) is absolute garbage....there is an on going debate about a damper versus a brace versus just swapping the front springs and oil...A lot of guys are just putting GSXR front ends on em...its practically bolt on with a different $45 upper bearing.   Basically with stock the front end is loose as fuck. A friend has the bitudo gas cartridge front inserts and it handles better but he says around 100mph it gets woobly again and is considering a brace.

Bolt on parts that are made for the Bonneville are one thing, but stuff from other models worries me.

Triumph,3db39h,thirdGEARchirp,2,Tue Jul 14 22:07:53 2015 UTC,I would imagine that having brake lights in your headlights is illegal.
Triumph,3db39h,thebravelittlenublet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:26:01 2015 UTC,I did some research on this guy and supposedly he did like 4 street triples and has since stopped doing them. They also took months to complete is what I found out but I'm not sure how legit that information is. If there was a kit for it I'd buy it in a heartbeat because it look so badass.
Triumph,3db39h,ragnarock46,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:38:33 2015 UTC,What type of research did you do? How reliable was it?

Triumph,3db39h,ragnarock46,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:04:24 2015 UTC,I started reading various posts about his work.  Seems like it took months to receive the headlights back. Even then a few people had fitment issues.   That sucks.   Then others said the quality of work is great and took a few weeks.
Triumph,3db39h,cr0ft,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:05:20 2015 UTC,Just something to note after I was reading what other people say my brother has an xb9r which has projectors and at night he can't see shit. So maybe something to keep in mind. They still look cool though
Triumph,3db39h,faceroll,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:55:20 2015 UTC,"HIDs are illegal and suck. They blind on-coming traffic and spew light all over the place if they're not projectors - projectors are still illegal but at least if they're done right they can be kept out of poeple's eyes, but most people do a shitty job at the conversion, which is non-trivial.  Get LED reflector inserts. You'd have to switch to round headlights though to fit JW Speaker 8630's or a single 8700 Evo 2 7-incher."
Triumph,3db39h,Crossgolf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:30:23 2015 UTC,"projectors are still illegal     No, they're not.  At least in the US.  Thy're required for HIDs to be legal, many are DOT approved.  HIDs in reflector housings are illegal.    I converted one of my old zx6r's headlights to a HID projector.  It's very easy to level and was not any more blinding than any car that comes with them OEM.  It was one of my favorite mods I've ever done to any bike.  The light output is amazing.  I would do it again to my triumph in a heartbeat if the work weren't so involved and there was an easy place to hide the wiring."

Triumph,3db39h,aka_mank,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:39:57 2015 UTC,"Don't know where you are but in the EU HIDs are illegal unless you have self levelling headlights, and probably illegal full stop on bikes.

Burnt out completely, so it was recommended by a fellow Daytona rider online that I upgrade the stator. New stator burnt out new rectifer.  I don't think this is typical of the MOSFET parts, but I didn't want to continue to dig into my wallet, and decided to go back with OEM. My dealership stressed that they've seen this too many times and would have been smart to come to them first."

Due to the longer stalks, these mirrors are much easier to use while still retaining original styling. No more doing the ""chicken dance"" to see behind you.  These will fit directly on the 06-08 bases, perhaps the newer models as well if the base is remains the same. The only downside is these mirrors are extremely difficult to find in used condition and are $86 each on part websites. However, I highly recommend them if you don't enjoy looking at your shoulders."

Triumph,3d5fxx,gilvoth,4,Mon Jul 13 17:50:52 2015 UTC,"You'll never know unless you shop their competition.  Most dealers are willing to do a little negotiating if their competitor has a lower price.  Go in and tell them you have cash and you want their best offer because you're going to ""Stealership across town"" for their best price."
Triumph,3d5fxx,loadedmind,3,Mon Jul 13 19:51:46 2015 UTC,"I think this will vary dealership to dealership. Our dealership doesn't like having prior model years on the sales floor so they have really good sales when the new bikes start coming in. My husband got a new bike (not a Triumph) from the previous model year for cost plus setup fees BUT this was our second purchase from there and the staff were all aware of who we were and we make a point to stop by often.  On opposite end of the spectrum, one of the Triumph dealers in my area has new 2012's sitting on the floor and won't budge on price at all (hilarious)."
Triumph,3d5fxx,IdLikeToBuyAVal,2,Mon Jul 13 19:45:21 2015 UTC,And then will never sell those 2012's at full price.  They'll sit on them as lost assets and write that shit off.  Seems like a terrible business practice IMHO.

The ""deal"" that the dealership is telling you about is actually Triumphs deal, meaning ALL dealerships are offering this on their 2014 models.   Getting an actual price reduction will be somewhat difficult, but they are trying to get rid of those models. Like some others said, try and shop around and say that X dealer said they could get it for me at this price, can you do any better?"

I called all the dealers in the area.  Found the one with the lowest price, called my local dealer back and they went and picked it up for me and sold it to me locally."

They're supposed to not run if the key is not close. Sometimes even having both too close together will keep it from running. If you'll get an alarm system get something they links to your phone.   Also, Gratz on the rx. I wanted one of those so bad but i found a good deal on a 14 r instead so i went with that. Be ready to wait like a month on whatever parts if they have to be ordered though.

Triumph,3d2kzp,AyooNisto,11,Mon Jul 13 00:44:36 2015 UTC,"It isn't a choke, it is an idle advance. Triumph actually tells you to pull it out to the first position when you start the bike(second if it is under 25c outside).   They could have programmed the EFI different or just set the idle faster. I think part of it was to keep the looks up."
Triumph,3d2kzp,ccosby,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:01:34 2015 UTC,"Or they could have installed an idle air control (iac) valve. I guess the simple solution is to not have one. Hence the manual idle advance. At least it means we'll never have a plugged IAC valve. Still annoying, but I just got used to pulling it out at least a notch on startup."

Triumph,3d2kzp,Chefdoji,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:57:18 2015 UTC,Its a fast idle and I use it frequently when starting the bike cold. The EFI versions of these will randomly not start sometimes or puts around trying to. I found with it on ( I use the partial way out setting) it starts every time and idles better instead of low for a few moments. If you own one you know what I am talking about.
Triumph,3d2kzp,SMORKIN_LABBIT,3,Mon Jul 13 15:57:45 2015 UTC,"I use mine all the way out on a cold engine, even when slightly warm, all the time. Push it to the first stop after I've got my helmet and gloves on, and the all the way in before dropping into first gear. If I want to bump up the idle because it's very cold outside, say under 10C, I pull the knob back out to the first stop after shifting into first gear, otherwise the gearbox makes too big of 'clunk'."

Triumph,3czlku,rockingmoses,2,Sun Jul 12 05:36:09 2015 UTC,"The proper way to do it is to wire the lights outside of the normal harness. Leave the normal harness/connectors alone and optionally use those to actuate relays to provide the actual power.   The Bonneville is probably not that sensitive to work on the harness, but if you have a bike with CANBUS any messing around with it can be bad.  The basic form of this is to get a headlight relay kit from someone like http://www.easternbeaver.com - he makes ready to install kits you can wire directly to the battery as the most basic form. This is a good idea for anyone, getting ""pure"" power straight from the battery often makes the headlights brighter because there's little to no voltage drop (as there can be via the stock harness).  If you need more power outlets and more circuits than one, the best way is to install a fuse box or a power distribution module and wire everything to that.   The ""deluxe"" solution is a http://pdm60.com - fully electronic, no fuses but still cuts out in case of a short. They're pretty awesome, I have one myself.   A cheaper alternative would be an http://www.easternbeaver.com/Main/Wiring_Kits/Fuseboxes/PC-8/pc-8.html for instance; a normal analog fusebox and relay that turns on when you turn the key on. Personally I really like the design of it, the fact it has both positive and negative screw terminals makes it an absolute doddle to install things right, just wire both cables (pos/neg) to the fuse box and you're done."
Triumph,3czlku,cr0ft,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:02:37 2015 UTC,Not exactly. What you CAN do is get the matching connectors to the stock harness and wire THOSE to whatever custom lighting you want to do. Or you can use these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0041PF5QY/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1436685692&sr=8-1&pi=AC_SX200_QL40&keywords=wire+splice+connector&dpPl=1&dpID=31ZzK1y1qoL&ref=plSrch) to leave the wiring intact.
Triumph,3czlku,savethemolarbears,2,Sun Jul 12 07:23:51 2015 UTC,"Those connectors do work but they're also crap. :) You can get a much more reliable and easy to install (and easy to remove, as they do no real damage to the existing wire)  Posi-tap from http://www.posi-products.com   The Posilocks are also outstanding for removable splices, basically as reliable as soldering but done in seconds without tools.   But one should be cautious about tapping leads with anything that draws real power. The original harness is designed to do what it does, not provide many amps more power to some new accessory. Accessories need to be wired in via an auxiliary fuse box/relay to do it right. You do need to still tap one wire to activate the fuse box though - for instance, the wire for the rear light which is on when the bike is on. But that draws no real power, it just serves to tell the fuse box to activate the relay (real or electronic)."
Triumph,3czlku,cr0ft,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:04:18 2015 UTC,"Yea. I figured he was replacing not adding more electrical draw, so I didn't bother getting into creating a whole new circuit. And yes those things suck, but you can get em anywhere and they will get the job done for what he's trying to do.  There is definitely more correct ways to go about it, but I'm guessing he's not going to go through all that trouble seeing as how he's asking for plug and play solutions on reddit. But thanks for showing me up, jeeeez!! <3<3"
Triumph,3czlku,savethemolarbears,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:12:48 2015 UTC,"Hehe.   Seriously, the Posi lineup of connectors are fantastic. Just used a bunch of them to wire up two driving lights, a power distribution module and to tap into the rear light wire on mine and every single one of them worked perfectly out of the gate. Unlike the crimp-on products, no worries whatsoever about the cables coming loose or not connecting properly.   Whoever came up with that concept is a genius. The only thing I wish would exist would be a ring terminal with the screw-on solution of the Posilocks, had to use the crimp type of terminal for that."

I do enduro and occasionally motocros and lately have been thinking about a road bike.   I'd like to know if this bike is a good one for trips with the lady. What's the range you can do without feeling exhausted. I don't like open helmets much and I want to get the best gear for me and my GF, what should I look into? Unluckily I only know offroad gears. Considering that i can handle a bike, I still don't want to get a bike that has too much power or that can put me into dangerous spots, is this a bike that is considered easy to drive? This beauty here is a 2012/4 without carburetors (injection), has about 8k km (5k miles) and is full optional. sells for about 7500 eur (8400$) is it too much?

Triumph,3cx9va,Free-k,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:27:02 2015 UTC,Supply and demand.  The Bonnie is a super popular bike in the states.  So there's always a ton of them available on craigslist (at least in my area).  This makes the owners compete against each other and drives the price down.
Triumph,3cx9va,Free-k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:06:05 2015 UTC,"You will love this bike. Has plenty of power for two up, and is very easy to ride despite its weight. My GF and myself each have our own version of this and can easily go 500 km a day without feeling tired. Make sure you get a windscreen though, that helps alot.  Pricing sounds about right for this type of bike in europe. They tend to be more expensive over here than in the states. Try to talk the price down to 7250 (or lower even :)) and you got yourself a good deal for sure. The engine on these are very reliable and there is a lot of after market support for the bike.

There is a high demand for used Bonnevilles that exceeds the number for sale, so the prices stay moderately high.  If you do not want the T100 and just want to trade up to a Scrambler, why not look for a more affordable model starter bike? If you get something that people frequently buy to learn on then sell when they outgrow it, you can get a good deal, ride it for a while, then sell it to the next generation of learners and get the scrambler you want.

Triumph,3cqlai,TheBlueCricket,2,Fri Jul 10 02:47:25 2015 UTC,"Cool thanks. I'm thinking about getting an exhaust, but just trying to figure out which one. Did you do the arrow tune with it?"
Triumph,3cqlai,BAM1789,2,Fri Jul 10 03:10:49 2015 UTC,"It's a great pipe, totally worth the money.  I haven't put the Arrow tune on it, the bike runs great as is and my dealer is almost an hour down the interstate which isn't worth the trip to me."
Triumph,3cqlai,TheBlueCricket,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:29:31 2015 UTC,I didn't do the tune. I read somewhere (can't remember where) that someone did the tun and experienced no performance difference. They also recommended to just let the bike idle for 15 minutes post install to let the ECU adjust air readings. Not sure on the validity of all these but I did it just because...
Triumph,3cqlai,TheBlueCricket,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:02:46 2015 UTC,I loved the look which is why I was attracted to it. Sounds pretty mean too! I have the baffle installed which actually isn't too loud. I noticed the loss in weight as well...definitely an improvement over stock!
Triumph,3cqlai,cr0ft,2,Fri Jul 10 03:09:43 2015 UTC,"I bought mine for the exact same reason, can't say I've had any issues with the exhaust other than the aforementioned loudness.  Unfortunately I can't say the same for their tail tidy, the build quality is really lacking."
Triumph,3cqlai,physics-teacher,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:26:17 2015 UTC,I finally took the baffle out and I'm glad I did. It's not too loud (may I'm deaf haha) and sounds so much more narly! I bought the R&G tail tidy and quality seems top notch.

Triumph,3cnjnj,michelangel0,2,Thu Jul 9 21:13:52 2015 UTC,I've been thinking about getting TEC shocks myself. I was skeptical about their products seeing as how cheap they're priced compared to the competition but overall I've heard nothing but good things from people who bought them. I heard they're manufactured in China but assembled in the UK which probably allows them to price them much cheaper while maintaining build quality.

It looks like your front wheel is bigger than his and tank may be shaped differently.  Is this just a difference between the years or is it just the angle of the photo?

Triumph,3cnjnj,shuck-n-jive,2,Thu Jul 9 19:00:14 2015 UTC,"I've had it coming on 2 years. I've had every type of bike pretty much and I'm a big fan of functional style. I had a Harley before and it looked awesome but handled like a bag of shit. My favourite things with the Bonnie is it handles brilliantly, once you removed the 02 sensor, remap and some over bits to the engine it pulls amazing, and is a awesome all rounder.  The whole time I'm riding the bike It gives me a sort of cool vibe about it. It's low slung and obnoxious, the modded exhaust note turns heads every where and the riding position feels awesome.  Least favourite? I'm very biased cause I'm a massive fan but standard they are just a bit boring, bad exhaust note and up right boring riding position. This stuck out most when I was chatting to a older guy with a Bonnie and he couldn't believe the difference between mine and his when he sat on it."

Triumph,3cnub1,LoTGoD,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:03:12 2015 UTC,"True. The 8630 Evolution model is outstanding and I've seen some fit them, most recently a guy with a Rocket III. Of course, at $400 a pop you're looking at a total of $800 for that.   Also, the buckets on these are kind of shallow. Possibly too shallow, I haven't measured but the LED headlights do require a bit of depth, so something that should be investigated first I suppose.  Plus, frankly, in my opinion the 8630 Evolutions aren't that attractive. They output huge quantities of light, yes, so they're great headlights, but the previous gen 8630 was available in black and chrome just like the 8700 Evo 2 is, and two of those in black should have looked fantastic on the round-headlight Triples.   So this is an option for people who'd like to do a single-headlight conversion and optionally move their instrument cluster lower, they have a complete kit for that. You can also choose to not go with LED, they sell normal headlight reflectors too."

Triumph,3cnc7y,baldheadslick,3,Thu Jul 9 06:18:58 2015 UTC,"Ow boy, suspension settings. Best to regress back to the factory defaults (check your owners or service manual) and start over from there.  Learn which screw adjusts what and always adjust only one property at a time (preload, compression or rebound dampening).  If you adjust the front, you need to adjust the back as well so it behaves the same I.e. Has the same rate of change response as the front so it does not unsettle the bike going over bumps, diving into a corner or driving out of one to name a few.  You can start learning about this topic here:  https://www.ohlins.eu/en/motorcycle/technics/ Something to try out for your bike: http://youtu.be/PZhoRuUoC3k but if you can't figure it out head over to s mechanic or better yet a suspension tuner.  Good luck!  Edit: just realised I posted the adjustment video for the standard triple, not the r with öhlins as you have.."
Triumph,3cnc7y,AbandonedLogic,3,Thu Jul 9 07:05:20 2015 UTC,funny thing. i have been looking up suggested settings for my bike and i found out that i am not sure which suspension my 2012 has. is it the 2011 suspension or is it the 2013 suspension? weird.
Triumph,3cnc7y,AbandonedLogic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:10:55 2015 UTC,It mostly comes down to rider preference. Some like a softer bike (lower preload and less compression dampening) others a firmer feel. Just make sure the front behaves the same as the rear in terms of rebound dampening. Not adjusting this correctly often leads to wobbles.
Triumph,3cnc7y,cr0ft,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:36:53 2015 UTC,"I would have to disagree on the whole rider preference thing. Depending on what one means with ""comes down to"". Optimal settings can be determined partly by the sag of the suspension with the rider's weight on it.   http://www.motorcyclenews.com/new-rider/choosing-kit/2006/november/feb23-05-how-to-set-suspension-sag/ discusses it.  The suspension has an optimal range during which it maximizes the handling of the bike on the road, and to achieve that the pre-load has to be set right. Damping then has to match the pre-load.  But basically, setting anything except pre-load shouldn't be done if you don't know what you're doing. The result will be random and quite probably bad."
Triumph,3cnc7y,AbandonedLogic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:53:46 2015 UTC,Fully agree with you on the sag settings having an optimum. If I recall I didn't mention sag in my previous post just for this reason.   Compression and rebound is where customer preference comes in :-)
Triumph,3cnc7y,cr0ft,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:22:28 2015 UTC,"Well yes, and a little no. :) I mean, the job of the suspension is to keep the wheel in contact with the road at all times, and to do that well you need a setup where both the spring load and damping work together to make that happen. But I suppose you can choose to have worse grip and handling in favor of comfort. Not sure if that makes any sense on a Striple though which is very much a performance machine."

Triumph,3cnc7y,TKM_PT,2,Sun Jul 12 13:05:19 2015 UTC,"If you're not sure of what you're actually changing, it's better to stop, get the user manual and read what thing does what job. Even if you don't have the manual, Google is your friend and you should have no problem getting a hold of one.     I adjusted only the 5 screws on the bike.   There are 6 screwdriver adjusters, 3 pre-load adjusters and 3 high-speed compression damping adjusters* on the bike:    On the top of the front forks:   2 Pre-load adjusters on top, turned by a wrench 2 Rebound adjusters on top of the pre-load adjusters, turned by screwdriver   On the bottom of the front forks:   2 High-speed Compression adjusters* on the side, turned by a wrench 2 Slow-speed Compression adjusters on the side, turned by screwdriver   On the top of the rear suspension:   1 Pre-load adjuster on top, turned by a hook and pin wrench 1 High-speed Compression adjuster* on the side, turned by wrench 1 Low-speed Compression adjuster on the side, turned by screwdriver   On the bottom of the rear suspension:   1 Rebound adjusters on top of the pre-load adjusters, turned by screwdriver (you probably missed this one)   * This is only on the '10+ Daytona suspension. I don't know if the newer Street models have this adjuster or not. In any case, you won't be adjusting this if you're ridding street.  It's recommended that you start your suspension adjustment by setting sag (pre-load) and only then go with adjusting the rest. Check this quick totorial on how to set sag. Then, if you want to learn more about suspension, check this great lesson by Dave Moss."

Triumph,3ch1pk,FarShot1984,7,Tue Jul 7 21:12:58 2015 UTC,"First off I'd get one with a tach on it(the lower end ones don't have it stock but they have a kit to add it).   Anyway the bonneville class of bikes(including the scrambler and thruxton in this) are pretty good bikes overall. For a first bike I'd say if you do pretty good in the MSP class go nuts. They are pretty forgiving bikes and generally have a reputation for holding up well.   That being said they are built to a price point which means they did some corner cutting on them. Most of this is easy to fix over time though.   Cheap/shitty bolts. For the most part this isn't that big of a deal although a lot of people have broken the pegs off these bikes(including myself).   Suspension stock really isn't good. Replacing it really makes a difference in how the bikes handle. Plus you can get it tailored to your weight if you replace it. Even cheap shocks apparently can make a big difference(I personally went with one of the better progressives in the back and their front springs).   Brakes could be better. It isn't something I'd worry about early on, just put better on when you wear them out. A nice set of EBC pads and maybe a floating rotor in the front is a nice upgrade.   Emissions system on these bikes is annoying. If you are in an area when it isn't tested you will find many remove the secondary air injection system and end up removing the o2 sensors and putting on a new ecu map to get around them. This does bring up a nice feature though. Triumph uses odb2(same as cars) so the 50 dollar scanner from a carparts store can read error codes on them. A 20 some dollar usb odb2 cable and free tune ecu software is all it takes to reprogram these bikes(not all of triumphs can be programed with tune ecu but the bonneville class can).   Might seem like a lot of problems but these bikes are seemly built to be modified and have been out long enough and have enough of a following that the aftermarket area has a good amount of options. I'm happy with my t100 and would recommend one.   Kinda surprised that no one has posted the honest review video in this thread yet.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsKFsce5phw  Guy jokes around in the video but his complaints and compliments are pretty spot on(although that engine mount is black now that he complains about)."
Triumph,3ch1pk,ccosby,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:10:55 2015 UTC,"Yes! I have seen the video and researched the flaws of the bike extensively. From various forums and videos, I have came to the conclusion that the suspension and brakes are a must to replace. I haven't heard how the bolts are cheap, however, and have only read a little  and watched a few videos about removing the air injection system. Believe me, this is not an impulse buy whatsoever. This will be the biggest purchase I've made to date, as I'm only 20. I've begun saving a percent of my check bi-weekly and I hope to have the funds for the parts that I need to make this bike great. Maybe you could give your opinion on what I've picked out or possibly some more affordable solutions? Modifying this bike isn't very cheap from my perspective! Haha.  http://www.newbonneville.com/html/ohlins_suspension.html The more affordable suspension.   http://www.newbonneville.com/html/ebc_brakes.html Brakes.  Both off of the same site, but I've heard this is a great site to go to for reliable and efficient parts. This is my main goal once I get the bike."
Triumph,3ch1pk,Yetibike,2,Wed Jul 8 05:42:23 2015 UTC,"You don't need Ohlins on a Bonneville. There are lots of cheaper options that are perfectly good enough such as Hagon or Ikon. As a new rider are you going to get the full benefit of Ohlins?   you really don't need to worry about the brakes, they're perfectly good enough. I'd certainly wait until the stock pads are worn out before thinking about upgrading the brakes."

Triumph,3ch1pk,Artax09,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:05:51 2015 UTC,"Newbonneville is good, as it british customs, bellacorse, etc. I got the same brake setup up front on my t100 and like it. As far as the shocks I can't speak from experience on them but they should be good. The triumphrat forums have a lot of info on these bikes. A lot of people seem really happy with the 200 ish dollar hagons.  As I said the brakes are something I personally wouldn't worry about until you wear the stock ones out. For suspension you might be fine with it. Even for the upgrades a bonneville isn't a performance bike, you don't need to go too crazy to get a nice setup. Now if you get a thruxton with rear sets and want to make a hard cornering bike maybe. Also don't forget springs in the front as an option. The stock springs are not progressive wound.   I pulled the AI pretty early on and ended up doing the o2 removal, upgraded exhaust(arrow 2-2), TTP tune, gutted the airbox, etc at 6 months when I did the 6k mile service. I was having some issues when my bike wasn't fully warmed up and switched between the o2 map and standard map and kinda went all in. I have to say I was very happy with the results.   Also since you mentioned trips it is worth saying that these are really around town bikes. I'm not saying you can't take them on long trips, you can. Just that they have no storage on them, no fairings so you get wind drag, and I personally think the mounts for most bags look like complete crap on them. You can get windscreens for them though."

Triumph,3ch1pk,SuicideKlutch,3,Fri Jul 10 20:21:45 2015 UTC,"I've got a t100. They're fun bikes. Maybe not as good as they should be right out of the box, but still good. Pretty forgiving and not too crazy. Stupid easy to work on. I sometimes miss the fancy stuff it doesn't have (ABS, better gauges, a brighter headlight, etc), but mostly it does just fine. It's a fun ride. On the other hand- maybe get something used first instead? My first bike was a bit of a beater- which was good. I dumped it a couple of times, clipped it on the garage backing it out, scratched up the tank accidentally, that kind of stuff."
Triumph,3ch1pk,GodRibs,2,Tue Jul 7 22:24:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you guys got me thinking about it. Haha. I think it is so appealing because of the low interest rate (1.9%) and Triumph gives me a 500$ voucher for equipment and stuff. I'll have to save up for some good leathers and a helmet. Also find a dealership with a bike I like. Thanks for the thoughts bud. It surely got me thinking."

Triumph,3cf4wb,thomasstryker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:47:27 2015 UTC,"I wouls opt for a handlebar with more rise, than bar risers, honestly. The stock bar isn't bad, but omg there are so many better bends out there that also make the bar wider, and get rid of the stupid fucking bar end adapters they stick in there. Also, my ProTaper just feels nicer. I think the aluminum is a bit thicker and cuts down on vibes ever-so-slightly.  My bar though is flatter than stock. The factory ergonomics are very reasonable, IMO. If anything, if ergo is a concern for you, I'd look more into adjustable rear sets, as the leg position would be more of a bother than handlebar height... At least in my humble opinion."
Triumph,3cf4wb,keboh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:42:43 2015 UTC,I installed ROX bar risers and they've been awesome. You just have to exercise care in routing the cables and ensure they don't snag when twisting the handle bars. It's been a worthwhile upgrade given the extra comfort they've given me. Go for it!
Triumph,3cf4wb,LordKingDude,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:40:47 2015 UTC,What was the height adjustment for you?
Triumph,3cf4wb,LordKingDude,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:01:43 2015 UTC,2 inches ...any more than that and you'd have to install longer cables.
Triumph,3cf4wb,cr0ft,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:52:15 2015 UTC,"Another option might be fully adjustable clipons. I don't have a Striple so can't recommend it based on personal experience, just something that seems to make sense.  Apex, for example, makes clipons that have up to 4 inch risers that are infinitely adjustable in height, not sure it would work for you but might be something to look into. They also allow you to adjust the angle of the actual grip up/down etc.   http://www.apexmfg.com/all-products/apex-clip-ons  Apex Riser Clip Ons Review from SportbikeTrackGear.com  Edit: Apparently, they also can be set up so they clear the tank and instruments."
Triumph,3cf4wb,InDurdenWeTrust,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:53:36 2015 UTC,"I know your thread is from 3 days ago, but I just wanted to let you know I just removed my 2"" risers this evening. I got the Rox 2"" pivoting risers in clear anodized: Revzilla link. Here are the pros and cons:   TL;DR: found them ugly, the cons outweighed the pros. Still a good, solid product though.  Pros  1) Seating position is more upright, easing pressure on the wrists. I'm on the shorter side (5'7""), so the stock bars are a bit of a reach. Overall, this improved the ergonomics and comfort of the bike.  2) Easy install. I have the shop manual for my bike, but it wasn't too difficult to do. Install was 15 minutes.  Cons  1) They're ugly. I replaced the stock mirrors with bar end mirrors and found the risers looked out of place.  2) Installation required re-routing of the front brake line, and it was a bit on the tight side. I was concerned that the brake line could come under excessive tension if I hit a pothole.  3) I found it made accessing the ignition (key hole) more difficult than it already is.  4) A 2"" rise puts your head ~2"" higher up. I also have the front flyscreen cowl. On the highway if I sit back and lean forward a bit I can get pretty good wind protection from it. The risers made it more difficult to tuck into this position."

I'm not necessarily trying to duplicate that bike, I just like the style. I knew about the powder coating and headlight but hadn't thought about the thicker 17"" rims. That's definitely something to consider if I'm going to remove the front fender. It might feel too light up front without it. Thanks for the feedback!"

Triumph,3bqb2a,sabertoothplatypus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:27:27 2015 UTC,"It's still there but I use clip on bars so I tilt it down a bit. The lever is also tilt down. It won't affect anything at all, its actually very comfortable because when you slow down your finger would kinda automaticly land on the lever so it helps a lot with braking"
Triumph,3bqb2a,heyitsmeriz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:01:23 2015 UTC,"I used to have a t100 modified to a cafe too, I still have it but its no longer a cafe, and only bit of advice I might add is if you find the riding position a bit uncomfortable with the more aggressive styling, relocating the rear sets/pegs could make it more comfortable. Its why sport and naked bikes have pegs further back. Good looking bike though."

Triumph,3bmp5t,bobthemunk,2,Tue Jun 30 13:39:04 2015 UTC,"Just got done with my first ever track day! Pic is from Barber Motorsports Park turn 14. Awesome experience! If anyone has been on the fence about doing a track day, go for it.  Also, $45 well spent with a suspension tech dialing in the R's damping and pre-load. The springs in there are super heavy. We had to take almost all of the pre-load out, and I'm only 175 lbs in gear!"
Triumph,3bmp5t,gcxandrew,3,Tue Jun 30 13:39:24 2015 UTC,how much sag did they give you?
Triumph,3bmp5t,gcxandrew,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:51:58 2015 UTC,"For the stock oil/springs on the 2013 STriple R, they took ALL of the preload out of the front and I only show about 3 threads at the top of the rear shock now. I was pretty apprehensive about taking all of that preload out since I'm not a tiny guy (5'11"", 170ish pounds in gear), but the tech said that was the proper amount of sag. The rear tire also had a terrible wear pattern, basically skipping/sliding across the pavement. I wish I'd taken a picture, but it basically had a steady pattern of heavy wear, then little wear, 2 in. across each. Wild.  I can say this dramatically improved the handling, especially turn in and holding a line. You'll read a lot about stiffer setups from people on forums etc., but for me the plusher setup was way more appropriate."
Triumph,3bmp5t,gcxandrew,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:36:52 2015 UTC,that's really interesting. im about 135 pounds and have about 4-5 rings in the rear and about 8 full turns out on the front preload and my sag is about 38mm front/34mm rear which i thought was a lot.

Now, before I am skewered, I did this because it was the only way I could get my wife to ride with me.  I did it with the caveat that in the spring, I would be able to buy another motorcycle and she could keep and ride the spyder.  I will say it is actually enjoyable to ride albeit different and it's extremely comfortable. I said all that to say that I haven't been reaching out to people as much to ride in groups since most people aren't keen on riding with spyders.  The CMA chapter I ride with in Sugar Land has been really cool about it, but others usually aren't.

Bearings shot. Valves bent. Cylinder scraped. Rods bent. Cam toasted. I mean, it can just go on and on and on.  I think you are getting the better end of the deal, but i have no idea how much credit they are gonna give you.  If you want to ride, this is probably the most painless way.

Triumph,3bkzyj,gallegoshank,3,Tue Jun 30 05:28:37 2015 UTC,"When you buy the new gear selector pedal made sure to get new shift linkage as well. It bends super easily and I can guarantee from experience its bent. If the shifting is slightly odd after replacement you may have bent the rod that goes across the entire engine....its a 120$ piece and its very common to bend on Thruxton's its designed to bend easily to not damage the cams. Its a bit of a bitch to replace because you drain the oil and take the side plates off both sides but you can do it on your own.  I went down on a brand new 2015 at 45 mph because a car came out on me through a red light and I swerved into an exposed sewer (massive pot hole on the edge of a sewer to the steel pipe wall was exposed about 6inches high) hit the steel and locked up the front wheel causing the rear wheel to go out on me (I cut the throttle and avoid getting high sided somehow) and end up in a low slide. Bent the handle bars, gear shifter, broke clutch lever off, dented the gas tank, Signal and headlight fucked up. Fixed it all myself you can't even tell it ever went down. You will be up and running soon."

Triumph,3biuo0,TridesH,2,Mon Jun 29 16:13:40 2015 UTC,I did mine myself.  I also purchased the cable thing to reset the Service Indicator thing but total cost of everything was about 80 bucks.  Every oil change after has only been about 35 now.  I don't really care for others to do my work so if something goes wrong I can only blame myself AND I feel most places are in the business of trying to rip you off.

Triumph,3biuo0,ctesibius,2,Mon Jun 29 21:52:19 2015 UTC,"I would be inclined to get the dealer to do it on such a young bike. Recently I had an intermittent lighting fault caused by a break in a wire leading to the ignition switch on my Explorer. It was over three years old at the time. I wanted to get all three locks changed to match rather than just changing the ignition lock, and as it has an immobiliser I would have to pay the dealer to do at least the re-programming. Triumph picked up the cost of all three locks - I hadn't even asked the dealer to ask them. I'm pretty sure that if the bike had not been dealer serviced there wouldn't have been any good will.  I do work on my older bikes - much cheaper, of course, and no-one's going to pick up the bill for a failure on a 1995 Daytona!"

Triumph,3biuo0,OprahShitfree,0,Mon Jun 29 17:19:13 2015 UTC,I'm inclined to do everything myself. The warranty on my bike is however expired so no issues there. If the bike isn't dealer maintained they can void the warranty.

Triumph,3bfnxb,yepthatguy2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:30:06 2015 UTC,"It’s perhaps prescient that Triumph killed the big Daytona that originally spawned the Speed Triple years ago, and yet the naked bike that was originally merely a spin-off from that machine has gone from strength to strength.   hinckley speed triple was around before the daytona, so maybe they meant the older daytona's?  other than the '91 Daytona 750 that came out before the '94 Speed Triple 750 and the stronger T595 Daytona's concurrent with the less radical T509 Speed Triples ('97-98), they have been fairly lock step engine-wise as long as Triumph made them both.  The big daytona always gets a hotter cam profile and has a bit more on top with gearing to use it, but it's a different bike for different application.   personally, i'm hoping for a big daytona hyper touring bike based on the 1200cc triple. something in the category of a blackbird, zx-13r or 'busa."

Triumph,3bg7ag,mrbbrj,3,Sun Jun 28 23:41:36 2015 UTC,"I've got almost 40 thousand miles on my Bonneville (bought new in May 2009) and have always used the cutoff switch. I've even got the original battery.  The only time I've ever had trouble starting it was one morning in Mississippi when it was incredibly humid.   Since this switch is required by the DOT, and since every training class I've ever heard of teaches people to do it this way, if this actually is a problem, it should be considered a defect and Triumph should fix it.  What is the point of having a cutoff switch if you can't use it?"
Triumph,3bg7ag,eshemuta,3,Mon Jun 29 11:35:07 2015 UTC,It's an emergency cutoff switch to use in a crash.   I don't know what harm it would do to the bike although I've heard it can affect the ECU.   Funnily enough in the UK I've never heard of anywhere teaching you to use it rather than the key.
Triumph,3bg7ag,Yetibike,2,Mon Jun 29 14:21:01 2015 UTC,I think it's a relic from before fuel injection. If Triumph wants us to use the key they should put it in a better location.
Triumph,3bg7ag,eshemuta,2,Mon Jun 29 14:32:34 2015 UTC,really?  I've been using the kill switch on my thruxton for months...
Triumph,3bg7ag,I_got_bs_ideas,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:21:48 2015 UTC,Yeah its in one of those caution boxes through out the manual on the page about starting and shutting off the bike. When I was learning to ride I was taught to always use the engine kill switch
Triumph,3bg7ag,stujiro,2,Sun Jun 28 23:30:20 2015 UTC,There are a lot of posts on different triumph forums about people who have bikes that develop starting issues.  The common factor that they all cite is that they use the kill switch instead of the key or kick stand.  Something to do with the way the computer clears the memory on shut down.
Triumph,3bg7ag,DocOne,2,Mon Jun 29 00:14:15 2015 UTC,I just use my kickstand
Triumph,3bg7ag,d3v1c3,2,Mon Jun 29 04:50:04 2015 UTC,I believe it has something to do with clearing out the ecu cache or something.  It supposedly leads to shortened battery life.  I stopped using it on my Daytona and street triple as well.
Triumph,3bg7ag,aDDnTN,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:50:01 2015 UTC,could you just hook up a battery tender every once in a while to restore that life?
Triumph,3bg7ag,d3v1c3,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:39:59 2015 UTC,Probably.  I noticed a degraded battery life on my triple after having it for a while.  I always used the kill switch.  Unfortunately my parking garage doesn't have an outlet for my tender.  After purchasing a new battery and changing my shut off method it seems to stay charged better.  Doesn't start as hard.  I still have some time left on my experiment but everything I have read about the kill switch showed some battery degradation as the main side effect.
Triumph,3bg7ag,b-r-a-s-s,2,Mon Jun 29 15:19:07 2015 UTC,"This is in the manual of every current triumph. I have a 2014 Tiger Explorer which shares exactly zero parts with a bonnie and it says not to use the kill switch too. As did my previous street triple. Nobody had ever given me a good reason for this, but I've just got into the habit of using the key."
Triumph,3bg7ag,TheFirstRuKuS,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:57:33 2015 UTC,Yea I was told the same when i bought my Bonnie. They said that the switch just is poorly made and wont last nearly as long as the key switch will.

I don't think anyone would blame you for buying one, and in fact, I think i would encourage you to because they're just that good (as long as you don't look at the front of it too much)    I really can't recommend a Speed Triple if you're coming from a Street and interested in a S1000R. The SIIIs handle like they weigh 220kg... because they do weigh 220kg, which feels like you're riding a small continent compared to a ST3, and despite having a bit of a facelift in the past few years, you are buying a 10 year old bike for 2015 prices.  SIIIs are hardly cheap. Compared to something like an S1000R (or a V4R) they are seriously long in the tooth and you'd have to simply want a SIII in order to buy one.   I'm not saying they are bad bikes because they aren't bad bikes at all, I'm just saying that a 2005 bike cannot compete with even a base model 2015 bike.

However, if getting a Triumph twin is a thing you want then they will do pretty well in the role. They're not too heavy, and the engine is torquey rather than a high-revving monster that delivers power only when revved."

Triumph,3b7rbj,basheep,3,Fri Jun 26 17:29:18 2015 UTC,"I had a 2012 Street Triple and now I have a 2013. The 2013 is noticeably less twitchy when starting off because I think they changed the ECU profile or something. A lot of bikes are twitchy at low RPMs, but honestly I find my current Striple to be pretty tame.  The solution may be better throttle control (assuming nothing is wrong with it mechanically)."
Triumph,3b7rbj,audiosf,2,Fri Jun 26 19:55:15 2015 UTC,The 2013 and newer have a taller first gear which makes them a bit more tame off the line.
Triumph,3b7rbj,faceroll,3,Sat Jun 27 00:01:08 2015 UTC,Have you tried adjusting the chain then?? Is it fine when  you apply a bit of throttle as you let the clutch out
Triumph,3b7rbj,G-wow,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:33:14 2015 UTC,"The chain looks to be adequately tight. I can still feel it a little bit while slowly rolling on the throttle, however by around 4k I can't really tell anymore."

Triumph,3b7rbj,d3v1c3,2,Fri Jun 26 18:45:54 2015 UTC,My Daytona was very jerky at low rpm due to a lean condition.  It would smooth out in the higher rpms.  It made city riding awful.  Have you done any performance mods?
Triumph,3b7rbj,BruisedGhost,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:51:12 2015 UTC,"That sounds similar. Nothing big, just an SC Project conic exhaust."
Triumph,3b7rbj,bdjfzg,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:59:27 2015 UTC,I doubt a slip on would hurt you that much.  I put a full system on deleting the cat and exup valve.  Blocked off SAI and tossed the charcoal can.  Definitely needed a dyno run after that.  Perhaps you need an updated tune?    Last time I had my 13 striple in they updated the tune for me.  Edit: just noticed it was used.  Does it still have a cat?  Is the SAI blocked off?   What kind of air filter?
Triumph,3b7rbj,Jachyrax,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:02:53 2015 UTC,"This was happening before I threw that on too. Though, I think I'm going to have them throw on the arrow tune when it's time for the next maintenance."

Triumph,3b52xh,Gunshybaberino,2,Fri Jun 26 01:10:53 2015 UTC,"I use Dealertool, can't remember how much it was but around $100 I think. People use TuneECU too (which is free) but when I was looking into this, only Dealertool allows me to bleed the ABS.   Yes it voids your warranty if you do not follow the service schedule. When you hook up the diagnostic tool you can reset the service interval so it will show if you've never done this."
Triumph,3b52xh,Alect0,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:03:15 2015 UTC,"The service icon/light is just a reminder. As long as you have proof of doing the work (receipts and such) it's mostly irrelevant at least in the US. There are laws protecting DIY guys.  That said I use dealertool as well: http://dealertoolcouk.ipage.com  My bike has never been to a shop for service, only for the yearly inspection and tuning."
Triumph,3b52xh,tottenham12712,2,Fri Jun 26 02:14:05 2015 UTC,"Well there are other things you need a diagnostic tool for like the throttle bodies and so on. I think skipping those steps is a bad idea just to save a bit of money so OP should get a diagnostic tool.   Yea my bike hasn't ever been to the shop either, got 30k service next :)"
Triumph,3b52xh,Alect0,2,Fri Jun 26 02:20:08 2015 UTC,"Ah sorry, I was mainly just referring to the service light(leaving it always on and never reseting it). If you never plan on sending your bike in for service a dealertool is a necessity :)"
Triumph,3b52xh,tottenham12712,2,Fri Jun 26 03:09:51 2015 UTC,"Oh all I meant with that is if you do your own servicing but then need a warranty claim they may use the service interval never being reset as a way to claim you didn't do the autoscan and may question you further about that. I know I am in a grey area in Australia doing my own servicing. It technically does void the warranty here as you are required to take it to a licenced mechanic but I have it easier as my fiance used to be a mechanic and his qualifications don't expire so he could stamp my book if necessary. I just try to be super thorough with my servicing including getting OEM parts, keeping the receipts and doing everything exactly by the book so they can't point to anything I've done that could have voided the warranty. :)"
Triumph,3b52xh,Alect0,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:35:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the responses guys.  Just wondering if you've used TuneECU at all and if it's something I shouldn't go near if I'm new to this stuff.  Can't really figure out from the web how to work it to just do a basic service check.  But the price (free) is tempting.    On the other hand, Dealer tool seems like they lay everything out for you in the software.  Is it easy to use and does it generally tell you what is wrong and what to do and how to reset it?  Going to be hitting 6000 while out on a long haul and want to do my own service as I feel I don't own the damn thing if I can't maintain it.  However, I am green so maybe not the best idea?  The ECU stuff is my biggest concern.  I have an old Honda I learn on.  Popping new tires on to that before I go so I can have some experience with the front brake and wheel issues.  Thanks again for your responses."
Triumph,3b52xh,Alect0,2,Fri Jun 26 14:34:40 2015 UTC,I think the ECU stuff is the easiest part of servicing actually (I'm pretty green too but I have the benefit of my fiance to ask for help).  Just stay away from changing the mapping. I haven't used TuneECU because when I got my bike they said it would mess up the anti tamper so I would void my warranty but not 100% sure if that is still the case. I just got Dealertool because I knew I'd need it eventually to do the ABS bleed (TuneECU won't do that). I found it pretty self explanatory.   What bike do you have?
Triumph,3b52xh,Frisky2Times,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:50:17 2015 UTC,"2014 t100 bonneville black.  So no ABS.  Was just reading on Triumphrat.net that you may be able to just use a generic obd2 reader from an auto parts store and some software (maybe tuneECU android version) to do it.  Dealer tool sounds like it may guide you a bit though.  I guess my main question is what you do once you hook it up.  How do you know if something is wrong?  I have the dealer manual on the way so maybe that gives instructions.  Don't mean to bug you with the same questions.  Going to order Dealer tool based on your suggestion but worried it won't arrive before I leave, hence my looking for alternatives."
Triumph,3b52xh,Jesseeichas,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:19:40 2015 UTC,"I have both dealertool and tuneecu (pc version). They pretty much do the same thing except only tuneecu can load new maps to the ecu and only dealertool can bleed abs and clear the service indicator. (I know you don't want to do either of those) The only other difference is tuneecu is free but can't be used on some newer bikes (Bonneville looks ok up to April 2015) , but you need to buy a specific cable for each.  What do you do with it?   Well you can read and clear ecu trouble codes, reset fuel adaptions, check and adjust the TPS and ICV, use to balance throttle bodies, check all sensors + fuel pump and cooling fan operation.   Dealertool is a bit more idiot proof bc you can't mess up the map in the ecu, but as long as you don't select 'download' to send a map to the ecu you should be fine uding tuneecu. Adjusting or loading maps requires a fair bit of understanding of exactly what you're doing, if you get it wrong it is possible to 'brick' your ecu.   Make sure you read through all the information carefully before using either to make sure you use it correctly otherwise you're basically wasting your time as you won't be able to interpret the information either program is telling you."
Triumph,3b52xh,Alect0,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:40:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response.  Much appreciated.  Just to clarify, tuneECU won't let me clear the service indicator meaning the check engine light will stay on and should the dealer look at the bike it won't show that I did a ECU check at 6000 miles, correct?"
Triumph,3b52xh,quattromila,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:44:44 2015 UTC,You can change the map with tune ecu. All you have to do is download your original map to your laptop. If you need a warranty repair just download the stock map back on before you bring it to the dealer.

Triumph,3ayvn5,Miglin,2,Wed Jun 24 16:57:57 2015 UTC,I agree with Miglin here although I personally am a fan of the arrow exhaust which would put you way over the price he listed. Going with the above route really made my throttle a lot smoother and you can feel the extra power. I also pulled the AI which helped with how smooth the bike is when you let off the throttle.   Past that suspension can really make the bike feel better. I also personally went with nice EBC pads and one of their floating front rotors. I wouldn't worry about brakes until you need to replace them though.

Triumph,3ayvn5,stouset,5,Wed Jun 24 17:21:19 2015 UTC,"theres no reason you ""should"". the bikes are very well engineered from the factory, and made to work best in all conditions. if you start changing the factory tuning, you could free up some horsepower at the top end at the expense of torque in the low and mid range. its all a balance game and the factories figure out the best tune for general street use.  the reason you ""would"" do any mod like that is if you have a different riding style that benefits from the modifications.  at the end of the day, the best reason you would/should do anything like that is because you like the exhaust SOUND, and the look, and knowing your bike is slightly different from every other bike being pumped out of the factory.   engine development is pretty much figured out, and its not the 60s anymore where you can bolt on another 30 horsepower by opening up the intake and exhaust. to make serious power, you have to drop serious money, and the bikes that make serious top end horsepower usually have zero low end and mid range.

Triumph,3ayvn5,space_monster,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:45:10 2015 UTC,"the graph shows a loss in torque between 2500 and 3000 RPM, to have a gain above that.  like I said, tradeoffs and balances.   the point I was making is that no product will gain power EVERYWHERE, you always lose some to gain elsewhere, exactly like this shows.  that being said, losing a little between 2.5 and 3 to gain that much around 4k is pretty damn good!  but you didn't disprove me, I know you were trying, good effort though."
Triumph,3ayvn5,hondabuilder,2,Thu Jun 25 01:12:06 2015 UTC,"As an air cooled engine, the Bonneville series of bikes is severely limited in terms of air flow for noise and emissions reasons, especially so they can be sold in California without modification. A more free-flowing exhaust and air intake allows the bike to cycle more air, which means you can also increase the fueling which results in more power. It's true that you aren't going to get a huge increase in power, but the TTP ECU remap does help smooth out the bike and almost completely eliminates that jerky feeling throttle that you get on a stock bike.   EDIT: on top of all this, for complete vanity reasons most aftermarket exhausts for these bikes look and especially sound amazing (and not necessarily even particularly loud). A stock t100 sounds like a sewing machine."
Triumph,3ayvn5,Miglin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:26:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks. The Triumph forums say the same thing about changing the air flow.  I like the sewing machine analogy. Last week I met a friend at a bar and she said ""oh, you're here. I didn't even hear you ride up.""  Yeah, gotta make a change there."
Triumph,3ayvn5,ctesibius,0,Thu Jun 25 01:25:49 2015 UTC,"Firstly ""why not"": noise, of course (inlet may be as loud as the exhaust), and also the intake modification will mean that the bike runs poorly (some people say very poorly indeed) in the rain because the air filter will clog with water.  I have one of the early 790cc carburetted Bonnies that I tuned with a 904cc Wiseco kit and more open pipes - also removed the air injection. I didn't touch the air intake as I was aiming for a touring tune, emphasising bottom end grunt. My bike was particularly weak beforehand, and the dyno showed an increase from 38bhp to 70bhp - but don't expect anything like that increase on the 860cc fuel injected Bonnies.  While mine is pretty nice to ride, it burns an appreciable amount of oil now that the US pistons and rings are fitted - to the extent that it's wise to take a litre of oil with me when I'm touring and check the level each day. With the original British pistons and rings, it didn't burn any oil."

Triumph,3asvrd,Zippy_Z,4,Tue Jun 23 06:16:46 2015 UTC,"It's a unit construction Triumph 650 with single carb in a traditional (modified) frame. That puts it between 1963 and 1970.  The single leading shoe front brake puts it at 1967 or older. So it is probably a 65 - 67 Triumph TR6 that's been bobbed.  EDIT: It seems to have a Concentric carb, which is wrong for pre-1968.  The engine does not have the breather tube, so the engine is 1969 or older.  Since the bike is heavily modded, it probably contains bits from many years."

Triumph,3asvrd,cup-o-farts,-2,Wed Jun 24 01:12:13 2015 UTC,First nobody is going to use a bolt on kit who wants to do it right. Second even with a bolt on kit you call that easy? Compared to what?
Triumph,3asvrd,SonofUlysses,4,Wed Jun 24 02:01:12 2015 UTC,"Bolt on hard tails are easy to do on these bikes because the frame came in two pieces. I have a Bonneville right now that has the sub frame from a Daytona (500cc), which shortens the bike by about 1-2"".

Triumph,3asvrd,Top_Chef,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:35:51 2015 UTC,looks like a modified OIF with 650. If the engine and frame are matching then its probably a TR6RV
Triumph,3asvrd,31stan,2,Tue Jun 23 21:33:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's OIF.  If you look closely, you'll see that the tail section looks bolted  to the front section, as they were on pre-1971 frames.  71 and newer were all welded together, so one would assume that a hard tail would be welded on to the OIF front section..  You can also see the side car loop, a non OIF feature.  The downtube looks too thin for OIF, and the external oil tank is a dead giveaway.   It may be a TR6  but it can't be a TR6RV.  The ""V"" being the  Roman numeral for 5, which designated a 5 speed gearbox.  That didn't start until 1972-ish.  But this engine does not have the external breather tube which started in 1970, so the engine is pre-1970 and pre ""V""."

Triumph,3asvrd,SilentUnicorn,5,Tue Jun 23 13:59:15 2015 UTC,Actually it looks like a single carb 650 so it's probably a Tiger.
Triumph,3asvrd,rottenpossum,-2,Tue Jun 23 14:55:15 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing. Engine shape wasn't right for a modern 865.
Triumph,3asvrd,ser_sheep_shagger,-1,Tue Jun 23 17:25:06 2015 UTC,That is because it is not. If you can't tell a classic engine from a newer one you probaly should not own either.

Triumph,3asvrd,easywormfood,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:39:08 2015 UTC,Credit where credit is due - Triumph really put a lot of effort into making the new Bonnie look like it's classic ancestors.  Combine that with all the after market goodies one can bolt on and I have to look twice sometimes to tell the difference - and I ran a small shop for quite a few years that did Triumph and BSA restoration work.

Triumph,3arb7s,TheBlueCricket,2,Tue Jun 23 05:53:21 2015 UTC,"Do you favor the tail/seat on the Rx? That's really the only difference from the R aside from the wheel color.  That being said, if your dealer has a 2013 or 2014 model that they haven't sold yet it should be the same price as a new standard model 2015 street triple, in which case i'd just go for the R.

Triumph,3as6i1,two_bit_trevi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:39:47 2015 UTC,"Triumph was shit at electrics 60 years ago and nothing's changed.   The shunt R/R on it's own isn't a bad thing, it's just not as efficient as a mosfet. What makes set up fail is a combination of bad connections, poor cooling backwards wiring and a cruddy ground.  I've not only had the R/R fail, but also had the shitty connector between the stator and the R/R melt as well. Long rides in the heat, especially in stop and go traffic, are particularly hard on it.  To finally get everything working right, I replaced the stator and R/R with parts from http://ricksmotorsportelectrics.com. Instead of using the stock connector, I soldered the leads from the stator to the R/R directly together. Also rewired the charging system so that it goes from the R/R straight to the battery terminals instead of to the end of the wiring harness and added a heavy 10 gauge ground wire between one of the studs that holds the R/R on and the battery terminal. About 15k miles on that set up so far and no problems yet.    At the very least, you should install a voltmeter somewhere that you can easily monitor it. I use one of these (http://www.motorcycle-superstore.com/8115/i/kuryakyn-led-battery-gauge) but there are a lot of options. Aerostitch makes a nice, smaller unit if you'd like something that can be hidden away."
Triumph,3as6i1,two_bit_trevi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:53:30 2015 UTC,"First, where you should go and what you should see should be determined entirely by  you. I know it's quick and easy to ask for advice regarding this part of your journey, but pick up an atlas and just stare at it every night before you go to bed. Look at where you're going, where you might go, what you might want to do, and just fucking dream. Figure this out yourself. Your questions is like someone who wants a tattoo asking reddit what they should get. Some jobs are just yours, my man (or woman), and you are robbing yourself of being a better biker in the long run by asking questions like this.  Every summer for the past five years I've been on a month to two month motorcycle journey, and these are the things I've learned to pack.  1) good rain gear. I'm not like most people around here who will tell you ATGATT, I personally think that's your deal, but having a helmet will get you through rain. That shit hurts the face. Hell it hurts everywhere, and you will face it. Gloves too 2) tool bag, geared towards your bike. Google around and see what most tool bags are carrying. 3) tent and sleeping bag 4) half sized road atlas 5) a book 6) a headlamp 7) clothes for 3 days max. Stop at a coin laundry every fourth or fifth day. 8) water bottle (a Gatorade bottle you can fill up at every stop will be fine) 9) sunscreen. Where this shit. 10) a half towel 11) small toiletries bag, and I mean basics. Soap, hotel sized shampoo, deodorant, toothbrush and toothpaste 12) some form of self protection. What you carry is up to you, but carry it. People suck, and there are those that will hurt you. Fuck them. 13) obviously, most important, the adventurers attitude. Wake up every day hoping to see something in America that you never knew existed. My journeys are always more rewarding on back country roads, but that's all the advice I'll give you on ""what should I see."" 14) sweatshirt. Even in the summer these are good to have around. 15) JOURNAL  Basically, every year I've cut down my packing list. Keep camping gear to a minimum, because you aren't spending days in the wild but on the road. You're just sleeping in the woods. Have the camping gear that will get you through the night. Also, I'm no expert, but this is pretty damn close to my exhaustive list. Best way to figure out what you need on the road is to hit the road. The first ones always bit rough because of how fucking green you are, but hit the road and It will reward you.  Sorry if formatting is bad, I'm on the phone. No laptop on these trips, I'm in a tiny town in west Texas having breakfast on my triumph america, miles from home in Kentucky. Get after it, my friend."

I always have my ""survival"" knife on me when I'm camping (for general purpose things) so that works but I always notice those truck stops out west selling those ""tire clubs"" that suspiciously look a lot like a skull buster.  One of those might be better in a situation rather than the possibility of a knife fight.  I realize chances of needing it aren't that high but just wondering what you may have come across that made it mandatory for you.  Thanks again."
Triumph,3as6i1,MrBacon30895,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:45:57 2015 UTC,"Happy to help man. And it was just one situation in salt lake city back in 2011. I wouldn't worry about self protection in national or state parks other than bear spray, but you never know when you might just want a hotel that night, and you may not always know the city or town you're in very well and may end up on the wrong side of town. I havent needed it since, but I'd rather be violent then be done violence to, so I pack it. It's that simple."
Triumph,3as0hh,jasanthapus,4,Tue Jun 23 01:15:12 2015 UTC,I'd replace both seals and oil.
Triumph,3as0hh,Sevdog,2,Tue Jun 23 03:58:53 2015 UTC,"Change em both, and the oil in both,  and potentially even the bushings in both. You'll need a fork seal driver,  the new seals, a spring compressor and the manual. any fork oil of the proper weight will do the job. Count the settings for the clickers and make sure to back them off before tightening during reassembly."
Triumph,3as0hh,slakwhere,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:13:09 2015 UTC,do not buy a fork seal driver-- pvc pipe works as well or better.
Triumph,3as0hh,quattromila,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:58:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's what I've done for my GS500 and it worked fine   It seems excessive to do both seals, bushings, and oil since the maintenance sheet I have from triumph suggests only to change the oil after 30000 km, and I am only at 11k  I'll do the 1 seal for now... not looking to turn what I think could be a $30 job into a $200 job. Wasn't sure about the oil, but I suppose the weight is the only big factor  thanks ya'll"
Triumph,3as0hh,Frisky2Times,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:53:19 2015 UTC,"I rebuilt the forks on my Sprint last year and matched some seal and bushing kits from Honda XL650L for a fraction of the price for Triumph ones (even tho it is the same dealership). Check out the Race Tech page to find a match, is a bit of mucking around but worth doing both seals (and bushes) at the same time."
Triumph,3aod9e,gallegoshank,5,Mon Jun 22 04:20:23 2015 UTC,I think they nailed it. Great bike to make your own. I'm glad the reviewer had one of his own so he'd understand the appeal (a t100... but still).
Triumph,3aod9e,Miglin,2,Mon Jun 22 04:24:14 2015 UTC,"He's definitely right on power and weight. My only complaint about this bike is that a machine with those looks and that kind of power really deserves to weigh a lot less. That said, it carries it well as far as handling is concerned, and I only noticed the weight when walking it and when cracking the throttle (although my expectations were a little modified by riding a couple of much quicker bikes immediately prior so I'm sure that didn't help any)."
Triumph,3aod9e,c7hu1hu,4,Mon Jun 22 14:39:05 2015 UTC,"Very good review. Lots of folks out there that poo-poo the entire Bonnie line because of performance spec sheets. That's not why people are lining up to buy these bonnies. They want the style. The performance isn't top notch, but it isn't crappy either. These are fun bikes, at a great price that look AWESOME! There is ALL KINDS of aftermarket parts to make the one you choose even more individual... what's not to like. I love mine. :)"

Its the perfect bike to buy brand new and plan to invest another 3000$ over time to make it an amazing a perfect machine.   I own the Thruxton ace and have made a bunch of cosmetic and ease of use upgrades. My buddy owns a 2014 and has ripped the air box o2 sensors, new pipes. and put the gas cartridge bitudo springs in the front and new shocks in the rear it literally handles like a super sport now. All in thats around $2000-2500. His bike rides amazing. Dollar for dollar the Thruxton blows away its competition for looks, reliability and ride ability as long as you want to do the work.   Next season I am doing the power and suspension mods myself. Additionally, once the warranty is up I will bore the engine and put in a new performance cam."

Triumph,3ammws,Kamikaze_VikingMWO,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:52:52 2015 UTC,we actually did start from the end to the header.
Triumph,3ammws,savethemolarbears,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:25:48 2015 UTC,"My bad, looked like the other way in the picture. I was debating wrapping the pipes on my Bonnie too with tan wrap, but I feel like it would get dirty super fast. Are you worried at all about rusting? I've heard horror stories but whether it actually happens I don't know."
Triumph,3ammws,Kamikaze_VikingMWO,3,Sun Jun 21 20:29:21 2015 UTC,It does happen. The wrap holds moisture against the pipes.
Triumph,3ammws,savethemolarbears,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:50:42 2015 UTC,"But they also get hot and boil off any water...  I'm sure it happens, but I don't think people should be as scared of rusting under wraps as they are."
Triumph,3ammws,psahmn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:17:39 2015 UTC,I didn't hear about Rusting actually. If it does it's no big deal honestly. I was thinking of replacing the pipes eventually anyways. Not in the near future but along the road.
Triumph,3ammws,ChristmasDeviant,3,Sun Jun 21 20:36:13 2015 UTC,I've been seeing this a lot lately. Why do people wrap their pipes like this at all?  is is just for looks? Is it just to protect the chrome? is there a practical reason? I can guess that it would hold the heat in the pipes also increasing the temp of the gas that comes out the end. not sure if this is good or a bad thing.

Triumph,3ajfsp,TKM_PT,2,Sat Jun 20 20:31:38 2015 UTC,"Main 30A fuse is right between the tank and the battery compartment. The rest of them should be under the front left infill panel. That is, if the fuse placement is the same as the 10+ bikes. If not, do as /u/Miffins said and get the manual. Pull each fuse out and check if the little wire in the plastic housing is still intact. If not, you have a blown fuse and might have an electrical issue."

Triumph,3ajfsp,mjxii,3,Sun Jun 21 05:02:44 2015 UTC,Buy a battery tender and see if it will charge or if it's full
Triumph,3ajfsp,Macs675,2,Sun Jun 21 03:45:24 2015 UTC,"I've had the same problem with my 08, start with this list:   Killswitch off. Charge battery on a trickle charger until completely charged.  Check the fuses to make sure none are blown, inside the clutch side fairing.   If 1-3 resolve your problem, borrow or purchase a voltmeter and test your charging system. This is done by testing the battery and marking down its voltage at fully charged (should be above 12v, roughly 12.5), starting the bike and testing again. If the system is working correctly it should be above 13v while the bike is running.  If all of the above are good to go (no blown fuses and a full battery) but the bike still doesn't do anything, you're going to have to learn as you go and do the following:   Look for open wires in the bike touching bare metal. 4a. Look for cut or chewed wires. Make sure your ECU isn't fried and is connected."

However, I was lucky enough to take a STriple R for a test ride last week (whilst waiting for the paperwork on my new Explorer to go through, woot!).  I'm also 6'2"", weighing, well, a bit more than that.  I thought it was a very comfortable bike indeed. Seemed to fit me quite well.

I know that originally when I went in they said they don't allow test rides very often, but I think in the case where they know the person is very serious and will buy if they like it, they'll allow it  I made sure to speak to the same guy both times I went in and got the quote including some freebies along with his card, so I'll make sure I talk to him again, let him know I'm ready to make a decision, and let him know that I want to take it out first."

Triumph,3adm28,Alect0,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:16:13 2015 UTC,"I don't have a wind screen on my Sportster either and can definitely feel it at around that speed as well. One thing that concerns me with the wind screen is another comment posted in the post I made in /r/motorcycles:   5'11"", wear 32"" inseam in jeans. If you've sat on it and like the riding position, you'll be absolutely fine. Just don't bother buying the flyscreen, as (at your height) it will just push air onto your chest."
Triumph,3adm28,stujiro,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:43:14 2015 UTC,"Ah - instead of it having a more evenly flow through most of the body, probably moves most of it to one spot, makes sense.  Good info.  I only see a few other Street Triples around, about 2-3, and they all have the screen on it."
Triumph,3acod1,betasuperstar,6,Fri Jun 19 01:02:04 2015 UTC,"Looking at the pictures, that's just the clamp that holds the master cylinder to the bars.

I'm not 100% sure how they mount up but it looks like the screw the secure the top of the MC holds the mirror...so a new mirror as well.  You could go through insurance and pay the premium increase if you meet your deductible or just buy the parts online.

Triumph,3aaxzz,bbwarrior32,3,Thu Jun 18 16:59:09 2015 UTC,Nice smooth panning... match that up with your transitions. Your transitions are too jumpy and detract from the smoothness of the video. Slower fade in/fade out.

Triumph,3aaxzz,stoopa,3,Fri Jun 19 00:19:36 2015 UTC,"Like /u/suicideklutch said, match the panning and cuts with the music cues. You could have killed it matching the beginning of the song with some jump cuts.  Also, check your exposure levels, control your lighting. Ask to roll the bike outside so you can control the lighting more, and for a less distracting background. Also, see if they will put it up on stands. Every shop I know has a set of stands.  0:46 Watch when you're racking focus. If you are letting the camera do it, then get an off camera shutter release cable. I use these. If you are doing it manually, find a steadier way to do it. I use this, cheap and effective.  1:24 Watch your DOF here. Brembo is in focus, Ohlins is not. Just adjust the aperture for a wider DOF.  Otherwise, it was pretty good. Awesome smooth panning!"

I ended up taking a bristle brush to the pad during the next wash I gave it and just kept getting it until the brush stopped turning black.  Since then the issue still persists but at about 1% of what it used to do.

There are no stock electrical components, and there are only like 10 wires on the entire bike. The rotor and stator have been removed, and so has the starter motor. The Suzuki wheels are lighter, the forks are lighter. The seat is fiberglass. There are a lot less nuts/bolts on it than a stock bike. All those little weight savings add up.   For comparison our Thruxton race bike weighs 466lbs with gas. The rules for that class force you to leave it pretty stock. Only remove the lights and rear fender.    edit: also the counter balance shafts are pretty heavy, taking them out removes around 10 pounds."

Triumph,3a39jo,DemonEggy,2,Tue Jun 16 22:35:12 2015 UTC,"They are all great bikes and the differences besides style are minimal. I personally have a T100, but that was because it was a great deal. Something to consider though is the Scrambler and Thruxton are both based on the Bonneville, and the Bonneville is easy to change the appearance of when you want to and back when you want to. And at the end of the day is a personal choice, I would say go with what you think is the coolest."
Triumph,3a39jo,sabertoothplatypus,2,Tue Jun 16 22:44:23 2015 UTC,"Good answer.  Scrambler is taller, so checking the comfort of the height would be important.  Also I'll be ""that guy"" and say that these are fairly heavy bikes for a new rider. If you're big and strong don't worry, but otherwise a cheaper, used, lighter bike would be the default easy to start with (it's what I did, too: I bought an old Rebel 450, and sold it for what I paid for it a year later: no regrets)."
Triumph,3a39jo,GoodbyeBlueMonday,2,Tue Jun 16 23:11:06 2015 UTC,"... even a Rebel 250/CB250 are better choices for the first season, being inexpensive, reliable bikes that one can afford to damage while developing one's skills, and are less likely to get one hurt or killed.  And then you sell it next year for what you paid for it, and buy a Bonnie... (assuming you decide that you even like motorcycling. Some people discover that it's not for them) .  ."
Triumph,3a39jo,johnstanton,2,Wed Jun 17 00:07:40 2015 UTC,"This is a fair point, but my girlfriend is 5'4"" and 130 lbs., she has no problems riding the Bonneville. She had some experience riding a scooter and our old Honda CL350, but for practical purposes she was a noob when she started on the Bonneville. It is moderately heavy for a beginner bike, but it is well-balanced and its power is definitely not intimidating. It might not be the ideal beginner bike, but you could certainly do worse.   For me, the old CL350 was a fantastic starter bike, I've never ridden any bike since that was as fun to just hop on and go. Maintenance and repair were that bike's downfall for me, the local mechanic just didn't want to work on it (said he couldn't get parts) and told us not to bring it back."

If waddling around with it in a parking lot isn't too bad, then it'll be just fine. Power isn't crazy, like you said, and maintenance-wise it's good for a beginner, so it has a lot of points in its favor.   Also, I loooove the CL350! Great, great choice. I ride a 2013 Scrambler now, so I'm a bit biased haha. Sucks that your mechanic flaked: no luck getting parts online?"
Triumph,3a39jo,GoodbyeBlueMonday,2,Wed Jun 17 14:14:51 2015 UTC,"I really wouldn't call these bikes either large or heavy. Nor are they really all that powerful. Perhaps not the ideal newbie bike, but pretty unintimidating in my opinion. Of course, I'm on a Rocket, I just remember seeing a Bonneville next to mine and it looked positively dainty.  The proper newbie bike is probably a 50 cc offroad bike driven on soft surfaces. Or a Grom. But these are pretty mild as well, nothing like those insane 4-cylinder deathtraps some young men insist on buying."
Triumph,3a39jo,cr0ft,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:40:30 2015 UTC,"It's all pretty subjective: I spent a year and a half in South America riding motorcycles there, so I got really used to little 125cc motorcycles that weighed less than half of my Scrambler.   It just struck me that you could put one of those 125cc motorcycles on the pillion of my Scrambler and it still wouldn't weigh as much as your Rocket: next to a Rocket I think most bikes would look dainty!  But I totally agree that a Bonnie/Scrambler/Thruxton aren't ideal choices for a brand new rider, but they certainly aren't a bad choice."
Triumph,3a39jo,GoodbyeBlueMonday,3,Wed Jun 17 14:26:20 2015 UTC,"I bought a Thruxton as an early second bike (less than 500 miles learning with a Ninja 250).  I learned how to ride it well quite quickly, but it was much more difficult to control at low speeds as compared to the Ninja.  While I never personally was uncomfortable on the Thruxton, there are definitely easier bikes to ride.  Just bought a Duc Scrambler for my wife, and it is as easy to ride as anything...  That said, I feel that perhaps the Bonne and Scrambler will be easier to ride than the Thruxton.  I have not ridden them to confirm this, but IMO the more upright ergonomics make them more suited for a beginner.  Finally, I don't want to deter you from getting the Thruxton, because I am absolutely in love with riding it.  I feel like such a badass on it.  As many will say, sit on them. Ride them.  Ride them again.  And then make your decision."
Triumph,3a39jo,Zlator,3,Tue Jun 16 22:23:51 2015 UTC,"I bought a Thruxton as my first motorcycle 6 months ago and I have 2500 miles on it. It's such a pleasure to drive.  I wanted something with the retro style and the rearset position.  Check which position you prefer. Then you can modify look and power, check British-Customs."
Triumph,3a39jo,I_got_bs_ideas,3,Wed Jun 17 00:25:10 2015 UTC,Standard advice - get your first bike used. You are very likely to drop it if it's your first bike and that really sucks when its brand new and shiny.
Triumph,3a39jo,audiosf,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:21:20 2015 UTC,Definitely planning on going the used route.
Triumph,3a39jo,vambot5,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:05:36 2015 UTC,"We had a difficult time finding used Bonnevilles. They're the sort of bike that people buy and hold onto. There were many more used Americas for modest prices, but we did not care for the cruiser styling."
Triumph,3a39jo,ccosby,3,Wed Jun 17 03:08:12 2015 UTC,"As others have said the Bonneville and Scrambler might be a little more comfortable but really go with whichever you like more. I'd personally say go for the t100 bonneville or one of the other two, just because of things like the tach which the base model doesn't have(although you can add it).   For me it was the T100 black. I just liked its looks the best.   I will say I never verified this but I remember reading on either here or TriumphRat(I think it was on there) that the thruxton was in a different insurance bracket when they looked vs the bonneville. In his case buying a bonneville and converting it to a cafe racer styled bike would be much cheaper in the long run. Might be worth checking before hand in case yours is the same.   Another thing to mention. All three are the same base bike although the scrambler does have a different firing interval. You do have some work to switch one to another as well. The scrambler has a different rear brake master cylinder and side cover. It also has an extra bracket welded to the frame for the exhaust. The thruxton has rear sets and the t100 has extra tabs on the forks for the bigger fender.    Past that they are good beginner bikes although they are a bit on the heavy side. Still pretty easy to learn on."
Triumph,3a39jo,foot-long,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:58:38 2015 UTC,"T100 all black, it grabbed a hold of my soul."
Triumph,3a39jo,ccosby,2,Wed Jun 17 06:54:38 2015 UTC,Yea I have to say stock it is a great looking bike. With a few minor changes it can look even better. I personally am not a fan of chrome as I don't want to spend the time to clean it. That made the black edition the choice for me.
Triumph,3a39jo,Sconathon,2,Wed Jun 17 17:05:27 2015 UTC,"Apparently they're all supposed to be pretty decent choices for beginners. As someone who had his heart set on a Thruxton for a good while, consider expanding your horizons though. It took a lot of thought (and a good look at the life-saving statistics), but eventually I decided that I really wanted a bike with ABS. Rumor has it that next year's line of these bikes by Triumph will all have ABS. I'd wait for those or go for something like the Moto Guzzi V7 II line which are similarly priced and sized, but include ABS. Just my two cents."
Triumph,3a39jo,audiosf,2,Tue Jun 16 22:15:19 2015 UTC,ABS is awesome. A lot of bikes will come with ABS next year. Europe made it compulsory for new bikes in 2016.

Triumph,3a39jo,SMORKIN_LABBIT,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:40:46 2015 UTC,"Those bikes are literally the fucking same....the only REAL standout difference to me is with the Thruxtons rears sets you are leaned farther forward which makes it a 6/10 for long ass hauls (6 hour) versus like a 7/10 on the other two. Almost every difference is cosmetic otherwise. All three can be modified to look like the hottest version of the other for exactly the same amount of parts/ costs/ and wrench time. Buy the one that looks and feels closest to how you wanna ride/ want it to look. They are all ""image"" bikes....I own the Thruxton ace cause I wanted it to be white when I was done doing mods and I liked the ox blood seat.   Take the MSF course and you will be fine with the weight...unless you are some kinda 6' 110lb wimp. 500-700lb bike is not hard to operate. The Thruxton is 500+ wet.  If you have zero motorcycle experience at all IE dirt bike etc schedule a 1v1 with the MSF to puts around on one or find a friend with a beater to let you move around a bit on one. It is extremely likely you will accidentally let a bike fall over at slow/ crawl pace as a completely green rider."
Triumph,3a39jo,inkxel,2,Wed Jun 17 02:28:51 2015 UTC,"I second the rear-sets comment. I wanted a thruxton aesthetically but didn't like the foot placement. I ended up buying a t100 and have switched out the front end with clubman bars, bar end mirrors and dropped gauges to create something that looks part Bonnie part Thruxton."
Triumph,3a39jo,AIM-9enema,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:25:12 2015 UTC,I say go with the Scrambler. It sits up a little higher than the other two and has knobby tires for off payment riding.

Triumph,3a013v,Fixthemedia,8,Tue Jun 16 04:05:56 2015 UTC,These were the bikes I was trying to decide between. The Daytona's seating position I decided just wouldn't be comfortable for the long trips I do so I got the Street Triple.   I still like the Daytona way more but the Striple is more practical given 99% of my riding is commuting.   Go test ride them and see what you like.
Triumph,3a013v,Alect0,5,Tue Jun 16 06:08:36 2015 UTC,"I own both.  Your riding needs should necessitate which bike you get.    Power wise they are very similar.   Handling wise they are not.  They are both nimble bikes, but in the city and smaller roads the street triple will maneuver better.  It's more fun to ride in the city.  The Daytona is a performance machine.  It can handle high speeds very well on the highway.  It cuts like a knife through the traffic and kicks ass on the track.  The street triple sucks on the highway due to no stabilizer and no wind protection.    Tbh.  I have more fun on the street triple in the city.  When it's highways I have more fun on the daytona."
Triumph,3a013v,d3v1c3,2,Tue Jun 16 12:03:32 2015 UTC,"+1, IMO the Daytona will provide a much different riding experience vs. the bonneville than the street triple will. Not saying one is better than the other, but if I was going to have 2 bikes I would want them to be as different from each other as possible."
Triumph,3a013v,daeatenone,2,Tue Jun 16 20:22:41 2015 UTC,With the fly screen there isn't too much wind on the Street. I have 21k on my '13 and there is zero problem with stability on the highway. Daytona sucks for commuting and I found myself going 90+ way to often. Love the Daytona when I'm out riding aggressive though
Triumph,3a013v,minus0,2,Tue Jun 16 22:13:54 2015 UTC,I guess my experience comes with instability with high wind instances.  I have heard good things about the fly screen though.
Triumph,3a013v,d3v1c3,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:03:29 2015 UTC,"Did you go from a Daytona to a street triple or the other way? My normal cruising speed is right around 82 MPH. Being 6'4"", that's where the wind vs bike feels comfortable. The large bubble created by the Daytona makes it very easy to go faster, especially with the bit larger power band. Crosswind wise, I've ridden through plenty of wind advisory situations with little problem on either.   Not saying you're wrong BTW. I have much more experience on a '13 Street Triple R (21300+ miles) vs a '14 Daytona 675R (500+ miles). I have ridden my Street Triple at 8 hour increments with no problems besides a sore ass."
Triumph,3a013v,minus0,3,Tue Jun 16 23:18:31 2015 UTC,I'm also 5’6 and recently bought a triple. I'm only just comfortable on it and definitely wouldn't want the extra height of the Daytona. I'd also recommend getting some Rox bar risers to bring the bars towards you - they completely transformed the bike's comfort for me.
Triumph,3a013v,LordKingDude,3,Tue Jun 16 08:54:07 2015 UTC,"Test ride both and then decide. I went with the StripleR because it handles well in the city and I mostly commute on it. But, it's great for carving the twisties on the weekend!"
Triumph,3a013v,GSUS969,3,Tue Jun 16 12:14:04 2015 UTC,"Never ride a street triple but own a Daytona and a Ducati monster (had this first). Never thought much about the wind on highway with the monster until i got the Daytona. Huge difference! Even if i get caught in light rain on the Daytona i stay dryer. I'm 5'3"" and was pretty uncomfortable in the Daytona but it was doable. I got the triumph low profile seat and a lowering link to drop the back  about 5/8"" (and a bit in front to maintain geometry) and now i am just as confident as on the monster. As for comfort i put on the helibar tracstar bars and just did a 4 day 1300 mile trip on the Daytona and felt better than a similar trip on the monster i did last year. Could have kept going. I know a lot of people live the triple and say it's a great do everything bike. I'm just saying personally i don't see many situations where i would prefer a naked bike over my Daytona.   As everyone said though, try them both, it's all going to come down to personal preference."
Triumph,3a013v,Meatballosaurus,2,Tue Jun 16 17:44:24 2015 UTC,"I've got striple never ridden daytona,  but one of few concerns I have is naked bike gives no highway wind protection which can get very tiring depending on speed and perspective"
Triumph,3a013v,bcbrz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:47:01 2015 UTC,I added the flyscreen to my Striple and it makes a big difference on wind protection. And it also helps the looks. If you want more wind protection there are a couple options that can make it have even more wind protection.

That being said, if I were to buy something (rented the Daytona 675R for a weekend) it would not be the Daytona.   I like long trips, and I also like cruising. Both of which don't work so well for me with the Daytona, I just couldn't ever get comfortable.. If I were in the market for a track bike though, the Daytona may work out."

I will obviously try out both bikes, but I've been leaning towards the street triple, and I think you all confirmed my thoughts. I want a bike I can ride anywhere including the highway. It's not the wind that bothers me on my bonneville, it's how the bike feels at high speeds. Only think I want to change on the triple is the headlights and fly shield."
Triumph,3a013v,PHD-in-Faggotry,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:07:59 2015 UTC,"If you're planning on doing the track, get the Daytona since you already have a comfortable cruiser. If you plan on using the bike for road and potentially track, get the StripleR.  I have the 2014 ST3R and it is an all around AMAZING bike. I can keep up with supersports in intermediate trackdays no problem and when I ride it home, it's comfortable and relatively upright. It's the perfect bike to do almost everything except off road."
Triumph,3a013v,vaylence,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:28:01 2015 UTC,"I own a Daytona but have never ridden a triple.  It's comfortable enough for an hour or so but then I find my shoulders and back start to get a bit sore.  The riding style is more aggressive than the triple  I'm 5'10"", but most of that is in my torso so when I roll up to lights I have to stand on my tippy toes which truly makes me feel manly as fuck.  I've found Triumphs are notoriously tall bikes.  With that said however when I get rolling I can bring my feet up and keep them in the riding position for hours with little to no discomfort."

But if you ever track or race the bike, the up-front cost is worth it when you just need to spend $10-$20 to get fully functional rearsets again.

Triumph,39qlhy,xmastreee,2,Sun Jun 14 11:40:48 2015 UTC,"It's been 22 years since the bike was put in storage, and my mom said that she can't remember exactly what was done for long term storage. She says that the guy who put it in 'storage mode' made it so that it can't be cranked over, something to do with the pistons both being at TDC if that sounds right.  I haven't begun to rip it apart yet, but I was wondering if anyone on here had an idea of what I'm talking about."
Triumph,39qlhy,bigBastardDude,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:19:39 2015 UTC,"If whoever put it in storage mode, hopefully the inside on the gas tank isn't rusty. The other issue, is old gas turning into varnish inside the carb(s?). If the tank looks clean, then there is a good chance the carb may be good to go too. I'd dump and change all the oils, spin the wheels to see if they feel good, and check the brakes.  Looks in really good shape, may be up and running with little effort. The only other issue I would think is maybe seals drying out and potential oil leaks due to age. But that will show itself once up and running."
Triumph,39qlhy,bigBastardDude,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:05:40 2015 UTC,"Gas tank isn't rusty, it does have some fuel/stabilizer in it. That probably means I'm ripping the carb off for a good cleaning then. Brakes/throttle need a bit of adjustment, hubs are good to go, but the tires are cracked to all hell.   I'm thinking the seals may be dried up, but it was stored in a climate controlled area, so I guess I'll find out.  Thanks!"
Triumph,39qlhy,BluKoller,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:14:03 2015 UTC,"If you can get to the float bowl easily, pull it, that will tell you if you need to clean the rest of the carb. With fuel stabilizer, it might be fine."

Triumph,39qnr2,baldheadslick,2,Sat Jun 13 20:31:17 2015 UTC,"well, I build custom bikes for a living and have to get creative with stuff as well.  It looks like both lights are mount on a single pivot, with those two sheet metal pieces on the sides. for this to work, you have to apply massive torque on the side bolts so stop it from sliding down. vibration WILL make those headlights droop over time, as well as loosen the bolts.  you really need some sort of 3 point mount that wont let it droop, that could be easily added on and hidden."

Triumph,39q3tk,Miglin,2,Sat Jun 13 18:43:06 2015 UTC,I've read too many conflicting bits of information about breaking in the bike. I've been sticking to what's been recommended in the manual - 5k RPM and lower for the first 300 miles and so on. Isn't this the way to go? In any case I'll be taking it in to the dealership for installing end bar mirrors. I'll have them increase the chain slack when I do.
Triumph,39q3tk,dysmas,10,Sat Jun 13 18:47:59 2015 UTC,"With all the conflicting advice on break in methods, it's probably best to just not ride it for the first 600 miles"
Triumph,39q3tk,kared,2,Sat Jun 13 18:57:08 2015 UTC,"2014 Street Triple R owner here.   There's no way you did any damage by having a tight chain for that amount of mileage (worse you've done is wear the chain a bit faster but even that's unlikely).  Why not just loosen it up yourself though?   It's dead simple; takes less than 10 mins in total (certainly less time than cleaning and lubing your chain between drying times takes...), and definitely less time than you'll spend waiting for the dealer to do it.  :P    I realize that the dealer will absolutely do it for you as well (and you should let their service dept. know about it),  but it's so easy to adjust and you're gonna end up doing it yourself sooner or later anyway - might as well start now LOL.     :)   As a tip, when you adjust your chain, you can use the alignment notches on the triple to make sure it's been adjusted evenly on both sides  (their notches are actually decent compared to other bikes I've had),  or better yet just get one of these tools.   I use it on all my bikes (inc. my triple) and it's more accurate than using other means.   http://www.amazon.com/Motion-Pro-08-0048-Chain-Alignment/dp/B000GTVOJQ"
Triumph,39q3tk,Miglin,2,Sat Jun 13 19:44:19 2015 UTC,Thanks so much. I got the chain adjusted at the dealer but had them show me how to do it myself. I'm pretty confident I can make the necessary adjustments myself next time.
Triumph,39ppwy,shiftygopher,2,Sat Jun 13 15:34:08 2015 UTC,Yup. I have the same type of block-offs from British Customs and when I saw how it fit I threw on a bit of locktite.... a year later and they're still on there solidly.

We spent several hours at Ruby Beach last weekend and it was nice, but damn that 3 hour drive home.   While you're in Long Beach, check out the bakery! The best apple fritters I've ever had and all made daily, so good!   Also, if you go into Astoria, take a few extra minutes to drive up to the ""column"" and throw an airplane off the top, which you buy for $1 at the gift shop.

Triumph,39m9lj,Evilsmurfkiller,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:05:59 2015 UTC,It's just what you are more comfortable with.  Test ride both and decide.  I liked Em both but I got the 675 so my wife could ride it (noob) comfortably and not kill herself.  Obviously the speed is way more powerful but they are both pretty reserved unless you want them to go balls to the wall.
Triumph,39m9lj,d3v1c3,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:52:25 2015 UTC,"I never rode the Street triple but the Speed is really solid. Tame if you want it to be, a monster otherwise.

You couldn't go wrong with one, really."

If you are a hooligan and love wheelies, the Speed is the perfect bike. If you want the better bike all around, the Street is probably better sorted. If you ride them both, you'll understand why EVERYBODY uses the word ""nimble"" to describe it. All that said, just like these others have said, it comes down to how it suits YOU. Both are incredible bikes. Even though the 1050 motor is getting dated, I loved every minute I was on it.   Watch this review, it's the reason I bought the Speed."

Triumph,39m9lj,Zappafied,3,Sat Jun 13 04:29:11 2015 UTC,"It's been largely unchanged for the better part of a decade, it's heavy, and it doesn't make a lot of power, especially considering its displacement.

Triumph,39m9lj,BAM1789,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:56:11 2015 UTC,"I was in the market for a street R while a brand new speed sat in the dealer.  It took a few walks past it before it sank its teeth in, but I ended up taking it over the R.  What sold it for me was the motor and gearing being so much more comfortable to use in a lot of situations.  Its not revving its brains out to do a long highway ride and its got a real mild manner to roll around town.  But if you want to get all excited, it takes very little to wind the wick up and go hard.  It is an older motor and it doesnt make the power that the competition are making, but the power and torque are in a very nice place in the rev range.  I like not having to wind up or drop two gears before I get to the meat of it.  I test rode an FZ1 and the motor just didnt tickle me like the speed does."
Triumph,39m9lj,scottydwrx,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:56:57 2015 UTC,And that's what I was wondering I like to take a lot of long distance rides and I didn't know how the street r would handle it self holding that speed
Triumph,39m9lj,scottydwrx,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:40:49 2015 UTC,"Then the speed is definitely at an advantage.  If you go up a tooth on the front sproket too, itll be even better on fuel too (same gearing as the sprint ST).  Ive done a few multi-day tours on mine and it was very comfortable, aside from the wind buffeting.  The speed has more range than the street too, about 100km or so."

Triumph,39l40g,Bobfed89,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:13:36 2015 UTC,I've posted on /r/motorcycles but thought I would also ask here.  I've got a 2010 Speed Triple. After a ride (and particularly a hot ride) it will dump what looks like clear water from an overflow hose. Following the hose upwards it looks like it is the one into the airbox. Any ideas what the cause of this could be?  Separately I had an issue where I was loosing coolant but can't identify where it is going. There is no oil in the coolant or coolant in the oil so for the moment I'm ruling out a leaking head gasket. I'm not sure whether these two things are connected but any insight or advice would be great.
Triumph,39fawo,flanflinger,2,Thu Jun 11 09:47:16 2015 UTC,"Had one for a while now though. You still need an USB cable to do everything I think, and an USB OTG adapter. Some things work via a Bluetooth adapter, which is kind of cool, you can get diagnostics live to a mobile device while running the bike by putting an ODB2-bluetooth adapter straight on the bike's connector."

Triumph,39fawo,cr0ft,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:50:07 2015 UTC,"Yep. Just make sure to get that OTG cable.

Triumph,39fawo,Rausage505,2,Sun Jun 14 23:52:32 2015 UTC,The Android version via bluetooth doesn't let you adjust maps. Just FYI...
Triumph,39fawo,cr0ft,2,Thu Jun 11 13:16:41 2015 UTC,"The operative words here are ""via bluetooth"" - you can get an OTG cable for any Android with a micro-usb port and plug the normal ODB cable you can get from http://www.lonelec.co.uk into your Android device. In fact, these guys throw in the OTG cable for free in the package.   (Anyone thinking of using TuneECU at all needs to make sure their bike will accept it; many of the newest Triumphs have locked-down ECU's that will turn into paperweights if you try using a third party tool like TuneECU on them. Thanks, Triumph, very helpful... not....)"

Last time I hooked it up via cable, TuneEcu said, in big red letters, DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE ON THIS BIKE! With the bluetooth, I can pull and clear engine codes, reset service intervals. I can LOOK AT the synch of the throttle bodies and the fuel maps, but they are not editable. Gotta use a Power Commander or dealer tool to do that stuff. Or just take it to the dealership and throw some cash at them (mine was $27 for the re-map after I put the Remus on)."

Triumph,39gc0v,GSUS969,3,Thu Jun 11 15:12:20 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that when you retrofit LED's, you have to replace the blinker relay as well.

Triumph,39gc0v,cr0ft,2,Thu Jun 11 20:28:14 2015 UTC,It should be stupid easy. On my Speed the indicator relay plugs into a wire extension so it doesn't interfere with fitment when you change it.

Triumph,39grnp,aDDnTN,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:16:02 2015 UTC,what year striple do you have? does it only have one Headlamp housing?  i also have a 3600 lumen LED H4 replacement that i love. why do you have a spare? did you buy two LEDs and then decide that the highbeam was superfluous?

Triumph,39grnp,G-wow,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:14:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, cyclops is the same generic ones I ordered from eBay. But for the same cost I got 2 instead of the 1 cyclops charged. Both are 3600 lumens, 6k temp rated."

Triumph,39grnp,RocketGrouch,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:05:43 2015 UTC,I thought the new ones all came with locking gas caps... If not there's an oem option.
Triumph,39grnp,I_got_bs_ideas,2,Thu Jun 11 20:12:18 2015 UTC,"On the Thruxton, I'd probably go aftermarket on the aux lights. I don't think it would look good with the normal three-light setup that cruisers have.   Some nice Clearwater Darla lights would no doubt give you greatly improved visibility and also more light down the road. They come in a stainless version that should look great on the forks or something like that. Pricey but you get what you pay for.  You can also replace the headlight with LED. I believe the Thruxton has a normal 7 inch round headlight - there are several options for upgrading that with LED by replacing the entire reflector in the headlight bucket. JW Speaker makes the 8700 Evo 2, which puts almost 3000 raw lumens down range - legally, as well, in contrast to any kits that replace the bulb with LED or HID, those are all illegal. Truck-lite also has the Phase 7 which is not quite as bright but arguably looks better, to pick just what I think are the top two choices.  And yeah... no locking gas cap on Triumphs, what a scam. You can get an OEM from http://www.worldoftriumph.com  (or maybe http://www.allthingstriumph.com if you're in the states.)"

Triumph,39aarz,d3v1c3,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:30:03 2015 UTC,"Most of my friends who race or do trackdays ride GP shift on the street.  GP shift helps on long sweeping left handers; you can upshift without unsafely wedging your foot under the shifter... or at least that's a major benefit on the track.  Having a bike setup GP on the street keeps them from dealing with a different shift pattern, and it reinforces the muscle memory they need at the track.  My trackbike is GP shift, my street bike is not.  Only because you can't switch a Sprint GT to GP shift without modifying the shift linkage and/or the frame.  I'd run GP on the street if it were possible/convenient."
Triumph,39aarz,coocha,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:14:43 2015 UTC,Cool thanks.  I actually had to do it because the standard shift wouldn't work too well with my qs.  I got it fixed now though and I'll see how it works out tonight.

Triumph,396cbc,sombreromaster,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:59:22 2015 UTC,You can buy a new t100 black fender from triumph for like 180 bucks(I scratched up one and had to buy a new one). The rear fender you can find on ebay for like around 100 bucks if you play your cards right. I think I paid 110 for a black standard sized fender as I wanted something shorter than the t100 one. It came with the turn signals as well which I could have always resold and really cut down on the cost.   Just giving you another option. You could always go back if you just get the replacement parts and paying a paint shop to do a good job on your stock parts wouldn't save that much cash.

Triumph,38rhqm,d3v1c3,2,Sat Jun 6 07:54:26 2015 UTC,"its apparently something to do with the chassis setup, fork angles and swingarm length. some say a 1 inch longer swingarm cures it. we tried that and it moved the swaying feeling to 90 mph on multiple bikes.

Triumph,38rhqm,Dang_Yankee,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:33:14 2015 UTC,"The stock suspension is absolute shit as well and cause a lot of these issues. I bought a 2015 and it just handles fucking terribly. A few buddies have replaced the springs and it is a giant improvement. One friend put the Bitudo springs and gas cartridge in the front and some upgraded springs in the rear. His handles like a sports bike now. I'm 100% doing that upgrade next season. Every problem with a stock Thruxton is 1-2 grand in after market mods from being corrected depending on selection. IE: New front/ rear suspension, rip the air box, new exhaust and o2 sensors. They handle and ride like a dream after that."
Triumph,38rhqm,hzme,2,Mon Jun 8 00:50:14 2015 UTC,"That is something to consider.  Although if I wanted to spend an extra 3k on the bike after mods and exhaust, I could have bought the bmw"

Triumph,38rhqm,aDDnTN,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:47:10 2015 UTC,"The instability is not normal for any bike, and certainly is not there on my Bonnie, which is almost the same bike. The wind pressure on your chest is more normal for that sort of fairing.  Some things to try out:   Check your wheel bearings, swinging arm bearings, and headstock bearings. These will require you to support the bike stably with the relevant wheel off the ground (i.e. not just someone holding it balanced on the side stand).  -  For the wheel bearings, hold the wheel at top and bottom and try to push one hand right and the other left. A bad bearing should be quite noticeable. - For the headstock bearings, stand in front of the bike and pull the forks forward and back. There should be no slack. Then let the bars turn to one side. They should turn freely, but slowly, not slam into the steering lock. - For the swinging arm bearings, stand behind the bike and try to move the end of the swinging arm from right to left. Try adjusting your tyre pressures. The figures in the manual are guidelines, but it's ok to vary them according to your weight and riding style. Adjust by 2psi increments, in the range -4psi to +6psi from standard. Generally a slight increase in pressure helps stability, but if you go too far you will lose some cornering grip. Don't exceed the maximum pressure printed on the sidewalls of the tyre. Try different tyres. My current preference is the Avon Roadrider, which compared with the Bridgestones I used to use gives better wet and dry grip, better stability at high speed (110mph+ - my bike is tuned) and turns in to a corner more easily. Try removing the bikini fairing."

The 6000 mile service takes a look at the spark plugs, throttle bodies, butterflies, throttle cables, exhaust system and fuel system (amongst other things), the annual is the same except for checking the spark plugs and throttle bodies.  I'd assume that if it was a 6000 mile service then quite a few of what could be causing any issues for you would have been checked already and adjusted.   As for the clutch, have you checked the clutch cable tension?"

Triumph,38adb4,BAM1789,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:40:44 2015 UTC,"There's really no easy way to increase light output with just bulb changes. HID in the normal reflector is both illegal and a bad idea, the bulb doesn't radiate in the right focal point for the light or in the right pattern to suit the halogen-designed reflector, so you'll be blinding oncoming traffic, and getting a lot of spill light that should be illuminating the road. The same goes for LED ""bulb"" retrofits, illegal and probably just as ineffective and potentially dangerous.  There are whiter bulbs, your Sylvania Silverstar etc, but they have been shown to last less time and give no real benefit except a color change Edit: maybe that's overstating it, they do give some benefit, but at the cost of lifespan. 400 hours, or some such, so you'll be buying new expensive bulbs every few months in the worst case.  Sylvania was even the subject of a class-action lawsuit when they overstated the performance of their product.  http://www.law360.com/articles/556866/sylvania-to-pay-30m-to-settle-headlight-false-ad-suit  What does work?   Higher wattage bulb, but that will strain your electrical system and may even cause faults over time in the worst case scenario - for instance, Triumph Rockets have historically had some keyswitch failures due to too much electricity funneling through there with stock bulbs even - and may cause the reflector or headlight to take heat damage. It's not meant to dissipate that much more heat. Replacing your entire reflector with a sealed, higher quality unit.  Replacing your entire reflector with a LED reflector that outputs tons of white light; only feasible on bikes with round 5.75 or 7 inch headlights as well. rigging up some kind of HID projector setup, but still illegal and non-trivial to do right.   You can also do an auxiliary light install, of course, like some Clearwater Darla lights somewhere on the front forks perhaps.  A relay bypass kit might also be a good idea, there is usually noticeable voltage drop when powering headlights through the stock harness.  Wiring the headlights straight to the battery via a relay can noticeably increase light, as voltage drop is then very minimal.  http://www.easternbeaver.com/Main/Bike_Specific/Triumph/triumph.html - dual-headlight kit, should probably work on the Striple too in addition to the Rocket."

Triumph,388gxm,ccosby,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:53:42 2015 UTC,You don't what you are talking about. Read up on the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act. They can't deny warranty coverage for aftermarket parts or for service not being done by the dealer. They would have to show that the aftermarket part caused the issue. IE if you changed the turn signals and they shorted out the electrical system yea they could deny it.
Triumph,388gxm,ShitDickDongcopter,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:35:09 2015 UTC,Magnusson-Moss Act is exactly right. Other dude must be a dealer shill.
Triumph,388gxm,ShitDickDongcopter,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:47:28 2015 UTC,"Methinks you doth protest too much, that's all. Federal law covers you and a decent $500 or less retainer lawyer should be able to defend it. Seems kinda like a no brainer, unless you work for a dealer."
Triumph,388gxm,ccosby,0,Tue Jun 2 20:53:47 2015 UTC,"Then you have a lawyer draft a letter demanding they fix it for far less than a few services would have cost. Chances are the mfg will fold if it even got to that. If not you take them to court for repair and legal fees. The chances of it going that far are very slim though.   If a dealer tried to overcharge me as much as the OP's was I'd be finding another dealer anyway. My triumph dealer didn't care that my service hadn't been done by them for the warranty claim I had(cylinder gasket was leaking). Nor did they care that my lights, suspension, exhaust, seat, etc were all changed or that I used a K&N filter vs the oem one. For what it is worth they happily sold me a dealer service manual and said if I ever got over my head they would be happy to do the work for me.   You are making this sound like it is far worst than it is. Federal law is on your side as long as you don't mess something up. The dealer knows this even if the sales person doesn't."
Triumph,388gxm,mattfki5g,2,Tue Jun 2 21:05:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much mine was, negotiated it into the cost of the bike, but $600 dollars seems extreme. It's basically an oil change and a once over. 1.5 hours of labor tops plus the cost of oil/filter. I would say $200 seems more reasonable, if labor is around $100/hr.  Edit: I just did my 1 year service and it was only around $300, can't imagine the first would cost any more  Edit2: The oil is also different from the break in oil, they go fully synthetic after the 600 mile service so he's not blowing smoke about that  Edit3: Just checked my credit card statement and my 1 year service was actually only $200, If you look in your manual, the services are practically the same."
Triumph,388gxm,klaceo,2,Tue Jun 2 21:14:17 2015 UTC,"No.  600 bucks for an oil change...I was roped into this too.  I'd asked for was done:  oil, filter, cable adjustment"
Triumph,388gxm,sombreromaster,2,Tue Jun 2 21:23:37 2015 UTC,"600 is a lot, I think I was told 225 or something."
Triumph,388gxm,cr0ft,2,Tue Jun 2 21:37:12 2015 UTC,"$600 is pretty high.   I've had tires changed, oil changed and a fair bit of other work done for less than that. And a tire change on a Rocket III is no joke, the bike is a pain in the ass to get off the ground.   Having the service done at 600 miles is definitely important. Your oil will be full of metal particles that have ground off the engine, and you need that out. But $600 seems pretty... off.  (Btw, consider picking up one of these and replacing your oil plug with it. The super-strong magnet will suck out whatever metal flakes are still in there after the oil change. http://magneticdrainplugs.co/triumphmotorcycles.php )  Anyway - your user manual will list every step that is done on the initial and any other service. Might want to look at that and evaluate that against the $600."
Triumph,388gxm,I_got_bs_ideas,2,Tue Jun 2 21:15:47 2015 UTC,"I paid my break-in service 250$ on my 2014 Thruxton at the dealer... Tighten bolts, check tune, check tire pressure, change oil, etc. Edit.  That was at thousand oaks powersports in California"
Triumph,388gxm,SkyZero,3,Tue Jun 2 16:49:16 2015 UTC,"From what I remember reading, you don't have to do service checks at the dealer for warranty purposes. You can do it at another bike shop if needed, you just have to provide proof that it was done somewhere.  Source: http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0138-auto-warranties-routine-maintenance#do   In fact, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, which is enforced by the FTC, makes it illegal for manufacturers or dealers to claim that your warranty is void or to deny coverage under your warranty simply because someone other than the dealer did the work.    I went to a local bike shop because the dealer was backed up for weeks and my bike is a commuter. I paid around $230 for it, since then though I've picked up the service manual and do maintenance on my own."
Triumph,388gxm,Puntas13,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:06:34 2015 UTC,"I'd say that no, the service isn't worth the $. But some manufacturers (looking at you Harley) make you bring in your bike at ridiculous service intervals/cost in order to keep your warranty valid."

Triumph,388gxm,cr0ft,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:13:31 2015 UTC,"Warranty is usually mandated by law. They literally have to give you at least 6 months in Europe, I believe, anything above that is optional.

Triumph,388gxm,Puntas13,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:35:45 2015 UTC,"Here they can(us) and do. You agree to the warranty with the stipulation that the dealer must service the bike throughout the warranty period. They don't do this on cars , but motorcycles are a different story."
Triumph,388gxm,cr0ft,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:55:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, yeah, looking more closely I see that motorcycles aren't considered a ""motor vehicle"" for purposes of the warranty laws.

Triumph,388gxm,ccosby,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:15:05 2015 UTC,"You should have the service done but you should also tell the dealer to piss off. That is way too expensive for a brake in service on one of these bikes.  With that many miles the chain should need an adjustment as the chains will stretch a bit when new.   Past that you have oil and filter change. The rest is pretty much giving the bike a good once over. Check the bolts around the bike and tighten, check and adjust the levers if needed(ie the clutch cable), etc. Even with the bolts around the bike if the dealer checked them over when they uncrated it you should be fine.   Personally I order my oil and filter from amazon. That way I can pull it up online when I ordered them as proof of purchase. Saves me from needing to scan a normal receipt from the auto store."
Triumph,388gxm,FurnitureGuyYo,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:55:02 2015 UTC,"My dealer said break in service would be $250.00, and apologized twice that it was that much."
Triumph,388gxm,savethemolarbears,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:48:31 2015 UTC,"While it is a lot of money and you can DEFINITELY get it done cheaper. $600 is about the dealer standard for a break-in service. It is mostly an oil change and chain service, but also a lot of visual inspection and the general post shakedown of a new bike.  This gets posted on here about once a month, go ahead and search for yourself if it will set your mind at ease."

Triumph,386lbq,Born_To_Roam,3,Tue Jun 2 05:35:39 2015 UTC,A bike that you have to work on once a week versus one that needs basic work on a scheduled basis. One that is capable of a good long stress free road trip versus one that might make if you've been nice to her lately. One that is fast and smooth vs one that is moderately not slow and shaky.  I could go on. But you're comparing machines that are 30 years apart. They are alike in name and aesthetics only.
Triumph,386lbq,savethemolarbears,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:59:35 2015 UTC,Damn. I was hoping that wouldn't be the case.   But that begs the question why I always see bikes from the 70s going for upwards of 4 thousand dollars.‎
Triumph,386lbq,Evilsmurfkiller,2,Tue Jun 2 17:57:32 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter if they're practical machines, they're cool as shit and people want them."
Triumph,386lbq,Yetibike,2,Tue Jun 2 18:08:02 2015 UTC,"They're collectible like classic cars.   The Bonneville was an old fashioned design in 1977. The Japanese came along with faster, more reliable bikes and destroyed the British bike industry which didn't react quickly enough.   The modern Bonnevilles share a name and a vague resemblance to the originals.   If ypu want a reliable, enjoyable everyday bike with reasonable performance get a Hinckley Bonneville. If you want a classic bike to polish and tinker with and take out for rides on a sunny day get a '70s Bonneville."
Triumph,386lbq,savethemolarbears,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:39:22 2015 UTC,Can't you upgrade them with modern parts to make them more reliable?
Triumph,386lbq,savethemolarbears,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:11:58 2015 UTC,"Of course there's lots you can do to make them more reliable. I had a 69 that I've ridden all over the country. But that entailed a complete rebuild of every component on the bike. Again with 30+ years of age, all of the seals, bearings, etc need to be replaced. The parts are hard to find, and a lot of it is extra spendy since it's generally NOS that someone's been hoarding for  half a decade. So take that 3000 and multiply it by 4 and you're getting near what it takes to make an old machine even in the same ballpark of reliability. They really are a labor of love. Collectors and triumph lovers, will pay whatever it takes to get one, but it's not the bike you want if you're not willing to spend lots of time and money to keep her alive."
Triumph,386lbq,PM_ME_UR_BIKE,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:23:51 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's what I'm worried about. I can totally see myself riding a 77 but I don't have the money or time for that kind of maintenance.   Any chance the 75-77s bikes are easier to maintain then the 69s? There were some changes that occurred in that time frame."
Triumph,386lbq,sombreromaster,2,Tue Jun 2 23:29:12 2015 UTC,"Not really man. It kinda sounds like you're trying to make a square peg fit in a round hole.

I get asked daily what year mine is and they are almost all shocked when I tell them."
Triumph,386lbq,sombreromaster,2,Wed Jun 3 01:25:22 2015 UTC,A million times better. They're completely different bikes. Have a look at the Bonneville wiki page and update yourself on the model history.

Plus after getting the engine redone the guy told me it was on it's last leg with rod/bearing issues.  I tried to ""save"" the tank.  But finding an original in good condition was hard enough.  Plus there's the whole ""fit"" thing.  Don Hutchinson told me that if I liked the old tank, take a picture of it.  Otherwise, it was a tank we knew would fit my bike.

Triumph,37z1yq,shagginshaggy,1 point,Sun May 31 20:36:02 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking of getting one myself, what are your impressions of it? Especially interested in how it handles!"
Triumph,37z1yq,sgtcalle,2,Sun May 31 19:33:10 2015 UTC,"I've had mine for 10 years now (purchased early '05 from a friend with sub 1k miles) and I absolutely love this bike. I have a little over 42k on the bike now. It has flaws, but none of which I haven't been willing to work with or overcome. As /u/plainkotti said in his reply, there is no aftermarket support for this bike. Absolutely none. It's OEM from a dealer or authorized distributor (Bike Bandit or British Customs) or compatible parts from other bikes (typically Yamaha and/or Suzuki sport bikes of similar year), though compatible parts are mainly electrical in nature. This generation of Daytona's are not for the faint of heart in terms of ownership. Hell, out of three Triumph dealerships I've dealt with over the last 10 years, one didn't know the bike existed and the other two thought that they would never see one. Parts take a very long time to get as none are stocked anywhere and have to come from the UK. Also, being such an old bike, the OEM parts are outrageous in price.  As for the handling, it fairs as well as any large sport bike of its era. Do not mistake this bike for a more typical, smaller, tighter, and lighter 600 sport bike. It is very much built like a 1000+ cc bike of its time. It's much wider and taller than any modern 600 I've ridden. That being said, you can 'feel' its seeming heft in the corners. While I'm able to throw it around just as well as a modern 600, it feels more solid and planted due to that sense of weight. I'm sure to a new to the bike rider, it might feel sluggish in transition due to this.  I don't want to speak too much about the suspension or breaks as mine hasn't been stock for nearly 9 years. As for power delivery, it likes to be above 6k and loves to be above 8k. It fine around town, though if you have any seat time with something that has low end torque, you will be able to tell how little this bike has. The first thing I did to this bike was up a tooth in the front and two in the back. It goes from being a very top end bike to a middle-to-top end bike and an absolute blast in the twisties due to the much broader feeling power band.  If you have any more questions, feel free to ask away."
Triumph,37z1yq,shagginshaggy,1 point,Sun May 31 21:31:02 2015 UTC,"It's quite nice. I still haven't got used to the gearing. I had an SV650S and by the time I would get to 60mph I'd be in 6th gear. While this one I can go 65 in first gear.... haha.   It's also quite comfy compared to the SV. My crotch isn't smashed against the tank. It is tall however. I'm on the short side of 5'8"" and I'm on my tip toes, and my buddy whos 6'2"" isn't flat footed either.   Parts, aftermarket or OEM are near impossible to find. I service manual does not exist to my knowledge, and only about 2000 of these bikes were imported for the 2004 year. Even less for the 2005.   As of right now my speedometer likes to not work occasionally. The mileage doesn't go up either. I bought it at 14k miles, so who knows how many on there. This seems to be pointed at the Voltage Regulator/Rectifier and/or stator. OEM replacements are looking around 1000 dollars in parts and don't really fix it. I've been reading about it and supposed a mechanically inclined person can fix this for around 300.  I really like the bike, but there is a niche market for it and really no support on any forums or parts really anywhere state side. We'll see how well it handles in the years to come."

Triumph,380i9p,keboh,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:53:57 2015 UTC,Yep once the speedo drops to 20-19 you feel what honestly just feels like a vibration no headshake or anything then once below or above that speed it goes away.

Triumph,37zwsa,brodoc,3,Sun May 31 20:34:14 2015 UTC,I'm in the automotive industry and while not exact it's close so here is what I would do. You have obviously found 2 bikes you are happy with. The 675 may be first choice but you wouldn't be upset with the other so use this as leverage. Go to the triumph dealer and tell him you are ready to buy TODAY. You have narrowed it down to this 675 and an R6 at Company X. Tell him if he can match your trade in value from Company X (If you have that offer in writing even better) you will buy right now. Be assertive and let him know you are serious about buying and ready to close this deal. Doubt he will pass on the sale or may atleast come up on his offer enough to make the deal worth it to you.
Triumph,37zwsa,Looptyloop,2,Mon Jun 1 01:36:13 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a pretty good deal. They probably have the leftover because they were harder to move than the R models. They weren't much more expensive ($1100?) and you got all the carbon fiber, Ohlins, and a quickshifter. For that price, though, I'd take one. As for the ergos, it's certainly different than the monster. It's tall, the bars are low and narrow and it generally isn't pleasant at low speeds. But you know that. My commute is about 5 miles and I never get it above second gear. I manage, but it wouldn't be my first choice if commuting was it's intended purpose. (There are plenty of twisty roads out here, and it excels in that environment.)"
Triumph,37zwsa,Oliver_X,2,Sun May 31 21:39:21 2015 UTC,"The R's were 13,500 MSRP.  The non-r was 11,500.  So 1,100 off for one just sitting on the showroom floor sounds alright."
Triumph,37zwsa,CoderHawk,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:06:23 2015 UTC,"The Triumph dealer doesn't have the room in gross profit to pay you $7300. Is the R6 discounted? I'd assume not, so they can pay $7300."
Triumph,37zwsa,Paddywagon33,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:58:28 2015 UTC,I can't remember the price of the R6 but it was definitely more of a discount percentage wise than the Daytona. The R6 is a 2013 I don't think the dealer is making much off of it.
Triumph,37zwsa,Paddywagon33,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:25:47 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way...they are offering to buy your bike for $6500. They don't have to do anything. A trade value based off what you think or what KBB has to say really doesn't mean much. They are guides.   Pay them MSRP for the Triumph and they'll pay you $7300 for your bike. You don't think the Triumph is worth MSRP? Goes both ways.   Here's the solution...pull the trade from Triumph, sell it where you'll get $7300 and take a taxi to buy your Triumph :)"

Triumph,37wxkg,RomancingUranus,2,Sun May 31 04:06:41 2015 UTC,"Daytonas certainly weren't available in blue in 2006 (or 07) but the sticker placement is consistent with an 06-07 model.  All the blue Daytonas ever made had a ""675"" sticker in the middle there where this bike has a ""Daytona"" sticker.  Clearly this is a pre-09 model that's been painted, and I see no reason to doubt OP stating it's a 2006 model.  As a side, the blue available for Daytonas in 2008 was Neon Blue which is a more cyan kind of blue than this bike.  This bike appears to be painted Caspian Blue which was a Daytona colour available in 2010 matched with gold rims and the later model suspension & brakes, slightly different fairings, etc.  Hope you enjoy the bike OP!  Looks like they did a decent job on the colour change."
Triumph,37wxkg,GSShenanigans,2,Sun May 31 05:19:45 2015 UTC,"You are correct. The color is more in line with the Caspian, than the Neon.

Triumph,37rc9f,cr0ft,1 point,Fri May 29 20:34:55 2015 UTC,"HID's are garbage. It takes seconds for the high beam to even warm up and start producing light, plus the illegality of it all. LED is the future, and there is an easy way to get superb light, all it does is cost a little money. Well worth the investment though, a bike with dual 8630's should have unbelievable light output."

Triumph,37q81k,ManNotHamburger,2,Fri May 29 20:33:09 2015 UTC,Yes old gas was higher octane due to being leaded. Also it usually doesn't have ethanol in it which is enough for me to go for 91.
Triumph,37q81k,libertygeared,2,Fri May 29 15:34:09 2015 UTC,this is why I run 91 in my bikes. around here its the only no-ethanol choice. that matters more than octane in these bikes
Triumph,37q81k,banjotec,2,Sat May 30 03:36:17 2015 UTC,In europe 95 is lowest you can get. My gfs bonnie is quite happy on the stuff. 91 should be no problem for the t100

Triumph,37q8b0,Zlator,2,Fri May 29 15:13:45 2015 UTC,"Nobody should need a damper on the street.  Tire and wheel balance can cause wobbles at certain speeds, warped rims, hubs, improperly installed / tensioned spokes.  I would start here.  Front end rebound set too high can also cause similar issues.  How well sorted is your suspension?  Bad form (ie, reseting your weight on your arms, and thus, the bars) can make small issues worse by resisting the suspension's ability to correct itself."

Triumph,37q8b0,savethemolarbears,1 point,Fri May 29 19:58:41 2015 UTC,"Ok.  FIRST: check your tire pressure. You'd be amazed at how much effect it has on your speed wobble.  SECOND: how new is the tire?  Getting close to replacement? New, balanced, tires make a world of difference. if it's near the middle of its life, consider taking it to get balanced. A front wheel is pretty simple to get off and take to the shop yourself.  THIRD: adjust your chain. Make sure it's in spec and the rear wheel is aligned properly.  Steering stabilizers should be a last resort for normal road use. You should be able to fix that wobble with one or a combination of the above remedies."

I haven't hit any huge potholes, so I don't foresee the wheels being out of true.  I will investigate nonetheless.  Chain is also very new, so I don't foresee it being loose or have stretched.  Again, I will investigate to be sure.  Thanks for the heads up about these items affecting the floatiness of the front end."
Triumph,37q8b0,aDDnTN,2,Fri May 29 20:04:49 2015 UTC,So I lied about the tire pressures.  35F/36R.  5 psi low in the rear per the Manual. I'll correct that and report back.
Triumph,37q8b0,ManNotHamburger,1 point,Fri May 29 22:25:03 2015 UTC,"One or two PSI probably isn't enough to cause it to wobble much, but better safe than sorry. I generally run 36psi up front as well. Also the chain might not be out of spec, but make sure the adjusters on the axel are both at the same mark on either side. A misaligned wheel can cause shaking as well. If you do all of this, and it's still giving you problems, it's time for another balance. 1600 miles isn't a lot, but it doesn't take much sometimes. A weight could have fallen off, or maybe just some uneven wear on the tire. Good luck! Let us know when you figure it out!"
Triumph,37q8b0,combatchuck103,3,Sat May 30 06:56:28 2015 UTC,"Fixed pressures and checked everything else (no issues) and went for a ride on a different interstate closer to home.

Triumph,37kg5h,mancubuss,4,Thu May 28 07:37:31 2015 UTC,Mostly sound but as an added bonus the fuel economy drops dramatically.
Triumph,37kg5h,Legbreak30,2,Thu May 28 13:51:20 2015 UTC,"A performance exhaust can give you a few HP.   I don't know about the scramblers 270 engine vs the 360 firing range the bonneville and thruxton but with them adding the low arrow or another performance exhaust, putting a TTP breathe intake on vs the stock snorkle, removing the o2 sensors and the airbox baffle, and loading the TTP tune can give you up to 10 rwhp.   I never had my bike dyno'd for the before and after but  I did the above to my bonneville and you can feel the difference."
Triumph,37kg5h,ccosby,2,Thu May 28 14:23:34 2015 UTC,The best benefit is that your Scrambler won't sound like a sewing machine. Source: I had it on my 2013 Scrambler.
Triumph,37kg5h,RamesesThe2nd,2,Thu May 28 23:00:21 2015 UTC,"As a scrambler owner, all of the comments so far seem reasonable to me.  Consider the following.  A stock/baffled Arrow system on a stock airbox will make very few changes from the OEM exhaust.  You will see a noticeable weight savings and a small drop in fuel economy.  HP will likely remain the same.    A debaffled Arrow system will potentially allow for more HP.  If airbox/ai/o2/tune remains stock you will see a noticeable decrease in your fuel economy, rough running during cold starts, and dives when rolling off the throttle.  Removing the airbox baffle, air injection, o2 sensors, and installing the proper tune and a resuable air filter will mitigate these effects.  These will likely need to be done with any debaffled exhaust system.  Keep in mind that the scrambler's horsepower is restricted mostly due to the 180 degree turn right out of the engine.  Softening the angle with an underslung exhaust might allow for more power.  But then you're losing the scrambler look...  IMO get the bike you want with the mods you want.  If you like the sound/look of the arrows, then pick them up.  If I was going to buy a scrambler again, I would do it differently than going straight for the arrow system.  My choice would be to stick with the stock pipes and exchange the huge OEM mufflers for debaffled VW beetle pipes and then spend the saved money on the airbox/tune mods above.  Can always add the Arrow exhaust later.  Cheers."

Triumph,37kg5h,cr0ft,1 point,Fri May 29 15:06:53 2015 UTC,"A more free-flowing exhaust when matched with a different air filter solution as well that moves more air in can give you some more power, but you'll have to remap the ECU and for maximum benefit put the bike on a dyno. And on a Scrambler, I doubt if just an exhaust and air filter will give you major benefits, maybe a 5+ (just guessing).   But primarily you'd be paying for sound and looks.

Triumph,37a0p0,McWalkerson,3,Tue May 26 02:11:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with that specific bike, but thats usually a rich condition on high vacuum deceleration. carb'd engines do it, its the nature of suction.  as for EFI engines, the computer cuts out the fuel delivery on decel but most engines will still pop under an extremely lean condition due to residual raw gas in the exhaust, meeting hot fresh intake air due to it not burning in the chamber on decel.  its more noticable on most vehicles after you swap the stock muffler for an aftermarket one. but according to some quick google-fu, its common on that bike to do it on stock pipes, and is part of the triples ""character"" LOL.  http://www.triumphrat.net/tiger-chat/179853-2006-tiger-popping-noise.html  so it would seem that its normal on that model. and in my experience building engines for various conditions, I can tell you that MOST engines do experience popping and sputtering on deceleration. stock bike manufacturers go to great lengths to reduce this, like fuel cut out circuits on carb'd bikes and huge mufflers tuned so the rider doesn't notice it as much."

Is the triple a bike that will be fun and comfy to ride both on town    Very much so. Clutch and throttle are smooth, no twitchy fueling at low speeds. Does just as well abiding by slow city speed limits as it does with a wheel in the air. Seat's not bad for longer jaunts (a sheepskin pad keeps it comfortable for 300+ mile trips).   and in twisties    It's my weapon of choice here in the mountains of Utah.   and maybe even for track?   I don't ride track, but people say it can hold its own.   Any common issues?    The dealer mentioned something about the fuel gauge sensors having issues, but mine worked fine. There was also an issue with the voltage regulator on the Daytona, but I don't know if it carried over to the Street Triples.  Oh, and you will want to ride like a hooligan all the goddamn time. Common problem, happens to everyone. You get used to it.   A year I should avoid?   I don't know of any years to avoid, but 07-11 had the round headlights, 12+ have the angular lights, and 13+ have a low exhaust and slightly different gearing (from what I hear, it's a little less... wheelie-prone).

Triumph,3784cc,Dangerous_Daveo,1 point,Sun May 31 03:25:24 2015 UTC,Are you saying you have troubles getting it into first from neutral sometimes? I've had this issue and the easiest way is to just let the clutch back out and then squeeze again - works every time for me. Not sure why it does it but now at stop lights/signs I just pump the clutch a couple times and I never have the issue anymore.
Triumph,3784cc,Angryface,2,Mon Jun 1 01:53:33 2015 UTC,That is the only issue I have with mine as well. Sometimes it just won't go unless I roll it a ton. It happened on my old bike too but not as bad.
Triumph,3784cc,woooden,3,Fri May 29 22:30:48 2015 UTC,"My daily commute is ~80 miles, round trip. It does as well on the direct route into the city as it does on the scenic route heading home.

Triumph,3784cc,Perkelnik,2,Tue May 26 19:08:16 2015 UTC,"What everyone else has said here is pretty spot on. I haven't noticed any suspension or brake issues on my '14 regular street triple, but I don't ride that hard. What I will say though is that the seat, although better than my last bike and many other bikes I have tried, is still horrible. It's not as bad on the highway, but in town I find I can't squeeze my thighs on the tank enough to prevent from sliding forwards consistently enough to not be very uncomfortable on a short ride. I have the new Sargent seat coming in the mail and I'm hoping it will help. Point is that I'm spending good money to be guinea pig for the new saddle because I dislike the seat enough.  I otherwise love the bike though."

Back to OP, the biggest thing you'll notice is how much smoother it will be, you won't care that you can't do stoppies/backing it in everywhere, as you won't be shaking for days after*.  Any R/R issues should have been sorted under a recall, or at least were here in Aust, so don't worry there.  Gearbox issues, I had them until I found a better mechanic, just adjusted everything spot on, now I have no need for a clutch. *Source, rode mates KTM640 once for 5mins.  Ghost vibrations for days..."
Triumph,3784cc,woooden,2,Wed May 27 00:11:39 2015 UTC,"I had the sliding issue as well on my RX, I added tank pads to help with grip and it completely changed the ride comfort. Without them it's very difficult to ""lock in"" and not move around especially with moderate or hard braking. It's a cheaper add on and doesn't hurt the looks in my opinion. Also keeps the matte paint looking nice under them for resale later.  http://www.revzilla.com/techspec"

I've read the Speed Triples have chipped keys but I can't find any info on the Street Triples.   I don't think that the keys are chipped. I have all 3 original keys and even the alarm key, that doesn't even have the plastic part, can turn on the bike. So you should have no issue with making a copy at a smith. Also, if you still have the keyring with the original keys, there should be a metal tag with a number on it. If you take that number/tag to a dealer, they should be able to send you a new set of keys."
Triumph,375gch,TKM_PT,2,Tue May 26 01:04:38 2015 UTC,"Excellent, thanks.  I thought I was out $100+ because of the possibility of a chip in the key.   I have the key without the plastic on it as well (which starts the bike, but I did have the key with the plastic on the same ring so I couldn't rule out the chip at that moment), but the PO told me it was a ""wallet key"". Ive read elsewhere that its an alarm key, but I don't think I have the alarm option.  Is there any way to tell? I'm not even sure how you would set it."
Triumph,375gch,TKM_PT,2,Tue May 26 01:15:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've heard that one too. I can see it being a wallet key but, since I don't have the Triumph alarm, I can't confirm the last bit.    Knowing if the bike has an alarm is a bit tricky since there's a few of them out there. However, I'm assuming that you're talking about the original Triumph alarm. If that's the case there's an alarm LED on the display unit that should be blinking when you lock the steering."

Triumph,3744j8,sombreromaster,3,Sun May 24 18:25:27 2015 UTC,An Honest Review of the Triumph Bonneville pretty much nailed it for both bikes.  I'd add that the Scrambler looks better but burns the hell out of your leg if you live somewhere hot.  It also sounds like a sewing machine with the stock exhaust.    I've heard rumors about the Bonneville line getting an overhaul soon.  I'd look into that before buying anything right now.  I don't have a source.
Triumph,3744j8,ManNotHamburger,1 point,Sun May 24 18:52:04 2015 UTC,"FWIW the Bonnie also sounds like a sewing machine with a stock exhaust. You can do the ""baffle-ectomy"" thing for free, though."

The engine mount on my 09 is not green, tho the swapping out parts to get it great is true. I heard that on the 2013+ they sorted out the issue with the secondary air injector/O2 sensor causing it to ride lumpy in low revs.  Get a bonneville! The scrambler does look great but it's not as fun to ride IMO"
Triumph,3744j8,GodRibs,1 point,Wed May 27 17:26:29 2015 UTC,"I drilled the baffles out of my stock exhaust.  The sound is pretty good, but you run into fuel map problems.  Without getting the tune done by someone knowledgeable, I was stuck either running lean with the stock tune or rich with the TOR exhaust tune.  I am stuck with the TOR tune for now."
Triumph,3744j8,ManNotHamburger,2,Thu May 28 00:21:12 2015 UTC,"If you are just shy on getting both feet flat on scrambler(as I was) try the Arrow exhaust, It sits much closer to the bike and now I easily flat foot at stops with both beet where before I was on tippytoes  I have not taken the Bonnie very far, but the scrambler is far from a harsh ride and I cant see the Bonneville as much better. It is easier to get saddlebags on it but if you have a small bit of ingenuity you can figure something out on the scrambler, this  is what I did for a weeklong camping trip last summer.  Go with whichever you like the look/sound/smell/taste of best. The differences between them are minimal, suspension is different but quite honestly both are terrible from factory, made the bike look like it was from the 1970's but also handle like it's from the 1970's, the engine block is the same but the scrambler has an offset crack that gives a bit more rugged sound and raises torque available at lower revs at the cost of some higher end horsepower but both bikes are far from what I would call powerful and if you are looking for high amounts of power and speed you are looking in the very wrong place. If you are looking for a comfortable long distance tourer you have also come to the wrong place, lack of windscreen and fenders will make that job less comfortable then other options.   But if you are looking for a bike with character you have come to the right place, both have loads of it and will turn heads wherever you go. Be prepared for especially older gentlemen to come up and talk about the old trophy or tiger they road back in the day.  I guess I'm just trying to say get whichever one has a bigger place in your heart, the difference between them is basically aesthetics."

Easy to wrench, big after-market parts selection and feels, sounds and looks like a bike should (to me anyways).  Probably keep mine around for a bit.  I test drove a Scrambler a year or so back and liked the bike though just didn't like the pipes so high and the dirt bike exhaust/engine not enough to take it over the Bonnie.

The clutch is basically on/off, the throttle is twitchy at low speeds, and it's ridiculously heavy (compared to the Street Triple, anyway). It also handles phenomenally once you're moving. Coming off a naked bike, I was expecting the wind buffeting to let me know that I was going fast - by the time I looked down at the speedometer, I was going... uh, fast. Whoops.

Triumph,36xyf4,Bootjackamus,1 point,Sat May 23 08:43:59 2015 UTC,"I recently did a 12k service on my '11 Datyona 675.. It was about $300 (either $280 or $320) and I believe it's basically the same as the 6k service; oils, filter, all the usual bike checks (coolant/tyres/brake pads/springs/shockers/etc) and labour.. They even found that the rear pads needed to be replaced..  Actually, I'll see if I can find the invoice for you..  Edit: I found the invoice.. It was actually for a 6k service (I bought the bike at 10k and the shop did the 12k service at 10k, so by the time 12k service came around I was having some major charging issues so I took it in to get diagnosed, and figured I would do another 6k (basic) service done at 12k..  Total cost was $374, they charged an extra half-an-hour for labour because they ran diagnostics on the stator/regulator while it was there..  Photos of the invoice here (sorry about quality.)  TL;DR: It came to AUD$374 (including taxes) for a 6k service, with new rear brake pads fitted, and additional labour costs for stator diagnostics. So IMO; you're gettin' ripped off at $600."

Triumph,36xyf4,aDDnTN,1 point,Sat May 23 06:02:54 2015 UTC,"Was a valve check done?  My CBR250r had the factory recommend a valve check at the 6k service, as most do. This would bring the price up 300.   Most dealerships skip the 6k, as almost always it turns up in spec. Ask if they performed the valve-clearance check. If so, that's where the extra cost came from."
Triumph,36xyf4,savethemolarbears,1 point,Sat May 23 13:31:16 2015 UTC,"sounds like they doubled the labor hours. call triumph america and ask them what the billable hours are on a 6k service. if it's less than 6, then you got ripped off.  have your mechanic give you an itemized list that shows exactly what he was doing for those 6 hours, demonstrated in labor-hours for each task. perhaps if he took every job and wrote it up as a separate service, including individual teardown/buildup time, it might be 6 hours, but that's not how you bill that kind of job anyway."
Triumph,36xyf4,savethemolarbears,0,Sun May 24 03:02:05 2015 UTC,"Mechanics don't charge by how long the job actually takes to complete. Each job has pre specified hours. That way if they make a mistake or somehow run into a problem (like stuck bolt, etc) they aren't over charging you for the time. Seasoned techs use the extra time to get it right, and not rush something that your life depends on."
Triumph,36xyf4,cr0ft,1 point,Tue May 26 12:39:15 2015 UTC,Agreed and I'm willing to part with the money but when I research and people are paying 300 for the service I have concern that 6 hours is just overcharging from the book to begin with.  Maybe I'm wrong but its just a concern
Triumph,36xyf4,IdLikeToBuyAVal,1 point,Sat May 23 02:26:00 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what the 6k service is. I know it's mostly just checks and an oil change. Maybe call another dealer (doesn't have to be your area) and ask them what they charge and what's included?

Triumph,36wao3,balek,1 point,Fri May 22 19:06:45 2015 UTC,Yup. Really simple. Just the same process in reverse. I have the British Customs Catseye and it can be swapped back and forth pretty simply.

Triumph,36wao3,cr0ft,1 point,Thu May 28 06:59:29 2015 UTC,"What happens when you remove the fender is that road muck gets trown up your back and butt.   All the road muck. In the universe.   What little doesn't go on you goes on the rest of the bike - under the seat, on the engine, etc.   Fenders are on there for a reason, and taking them off is 100% a ""form over function"" kind of deal, you're making your bike appreciably worse for the sake of looks.  Since you're talking about saddle bags, I presume you may be planning to rider further than the corner store in the sunshine, which make removing the fender kind of a bad call."
Triumph,36vo5v,KeyCounter,1 point,Fri May 22 14:14:53 2015 UTC,"We will do some testing later on today and see what comes of it. We went ahead and replaced the r/r because it was a recall, they seem to give people a lot of trouble, and it didn't really cost us anything. I appreciate the advice."
Triumph,36vo5v,Freakawn,1 point,Fri May 22 15:42:56 2015 UTC,That may be the alternative he chooses if it ends up being the stator. Seeing as how much of a pain the butt it was to get the parts for the r/r.
Triumph,36vo5v,Ngonerogwu,1 point,Fri May 22 17:48:24 2015 UTC,"I would also recommend wiring the Stator to the R/R outside of the wiring harness, getting rid of the connectors. The stator wires heat up, and in my Triumph (older speed four) it almost lit the entire harness up. The connectors were the culprit, having corroded off one connector causing the stator to overheat big time.   I know the Danny Eslick racing team also did this to the 675r they were using on the track. I believe they also relocated the R/R."
Triumph,36vo5v,Ngonerogwu,1 point,Fri May 22 19:16:22 2015 UTC,That's what we did. The r/r has been relocated so that it isn't getting direct heat from the engine. It was a bracket that triumph uses on the recall for the bikes. As well as a r/r that they used to replace the regular triumph one. We are thinking it is the stator though. Wiring maybe our next choice before we go into tearing into the bike.

Triumph,36s073,xtrategist,3,Thu May 21 21:45:38 2015 UTC,"I would tell them to take off the set up / handling. The bike was set up some time ago and has been used for demo rides. You should have to pay that.   Honestly it's easier to negotiate for an ""out the door"" price. Say, I want to pay $8,200 out the door. They can figure out where to knock off little chunks here and there. No point in you figuring out where every cent is used."

I can almost guarantee that they will be chasing you out the door and/or calling you with a couple of hours. They don't want to loose a $8000 over a couple of hundred bucks.

Triumph,36ml9l,Puntas13,2,Wed May 20 15:57:28 2015 UTC,05-07 are bad about stator/RR and sprag clutch failures. That being said they are all easy to fix and you can upgrade them to the newer 08+ style. The best year in my opinion is the '-11 models with the round headlights because they upgraded the fork internals.  If you're the kind of person that likes the current generation I'd hold out until you find an R model. The upgraded suspension is well worth the extra cash.  I've owned 3 of these bikes and they are hands done the funnest bike I've ridden.
Triumph,36ml9l,EvilKermit,2,Wed May 20 22:25:09 2015 UTC,Upvote for this man.  For me it was about these points for the 08-11 model   slightly longer pillion seat over the earlier models Black forks with better internals still had the round headlights - not keen on the bug eyes on later models didn't have the extra plastic bits on the sides around the radiator that later models have

Triumph,36miyp,aDDnTN,6,Wed May 20 14:00:22 2015 UTC,"God that was painful to watch, just about everything he was doing was terrible.  His road position was all wrong, he'd just move to the inside of the corner before actually reaching it which caused him to run out wide and stand the bike up on the brakes.  On top of that, he doesn't seem to actually be reading the road ahead of himself and as such he gets caught out by the corners because he doesn't realise that they're tighter than he realises.  He never seemed to actually look around the corners. We know that the camera is mounted to his helmet yet it hardly ever moves when getting to a corner and just pretty much keeps looking straight ahead and as such it's really no surprise that he too continues to go on straight ahead. Note that the time when he was most in control was when he was behind the slower moving cruisers and pretty much followed them around the corners.  All in all these should be very easy mistakes to avoid if you just use your head while riding but this guy just kept making them corner after corner, the crash was inevitable."

Triumph,36i928,GatNeo,1 point,Tue May 19 16:40:04 2015 UTC,"Cheap Amazon bar ends.   http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00HS7ZOOK/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1432054259&sr=8-1&pi=AC_SX200_QL40&keywords=triumph+bar+end&dpPl=1&dpID=41T0LUIoImL&ref=plSrch  You will have to use the stock screws, and new washers to put it out further. (Especially for the throttle side, don't want unintended acceleration)  My only complaint is that at high speeds where the mirror pivots will move on you. But I applied a silicone based lubricant to keep it from rusting and that may have been a bad idea."
Triumph,36i928,cup-o-farts,1 point,Tue May 19 16:54:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm I want these, but I'm not sure I understand your comment about putting them out further. Can you clarify? Do I need to mod anything stock? This is the only thing I don't want to do."
Triumph,36i928,AlexKnolly,2,Tue May 19 17:12:25 2015 UTC,I use these same mirrors and used a different approach.  First I I got longer bolts than stock and just tightened them down on the bar ends to prevent the mirror from rotating unintentionally.  I also moved the throttle tube inward maybe a cm or so to make sure there was no risk of the grip catching on the mirror (which I believe is what Jesseeichas was talking about avoiding with a spacer).  Just another solution.
Triumph,36i928,LXGd3k0y,2,Tue May 19 19:54:18 2015 UTC,I put two fender washers in between the bar end and the grip/throttle which makes the mirror stand out a little further as to not run along the throttle.

Triumph,36ikls,xtrategist,1 point,Tue May 19 21:32:13 2015 UTC,KTM= high powered high price maintenance.   BMW= cutting edge tech and expensive name.  Triumph = Great product and options for a fair price.  Ducati = High power not offroad capable.
Triumph,36ikls,0rangexc,1 point,Tue May 19 22:57:23 2015 UTC,"Ducati = High power not offroad capable.   You make it sound like the Panigale is the only bike they make.  A Multistrada or Hypermotard could dual sport handily!  And they just released the Ducati Scrambler.  OP, if you're not brand-loyal (like me and a lot of the rest here), give the Vstrom serious thought.  I dunno about you, but I think a dual-sport has potential to be more fun if you're not too worried about how much dropping it would cost when you run into some serious off-road obstacles.  This makes the KLR650 and the Vstrom serious contenders because they're both cheap and reliable."

Triumph,36gb75,Armored_Ape,3,Wed May 20 05:40:41 2015 UTC,Dumb question: why is the 660 the learner approved version?
Triumph,36gb75,Armored_Ape,2,Tue May 19 15:35:59 2015 UTC,"Definitely not a dumb question man, its a fucking weird number. I think it came about by the amount of bikes that were 650, so they added 10cc for good measure. But the actual rule is that it has to be <660cc, and <150kw/tonne. So the Street Triple has a bunch of modifications to bring it down to 660cc, and take the power down to around 38kw? Of course, thats if you don't modify it..."

Triumph,36gokv,Rossismyname,3,Tue May 19 06:35:12 2015 UTC,"It's a bitsa. Judging from the air filter (which might be misleading), it's a fairly late Meriden twin, prior to 1975 (which is when they put the gear lever on the left). The frame appears to have started as a ""oil in frame"" job - you can see the large diameter spine and the oil filler behind the tank. That would put it at 1971 or later (if the frame went with that engine). All of those had rear suspension, so it has been converted to a rigid frame. That front brake looks like one that came in in 1971, but I can't see if it's TLS."

Plenty fast to get into deep trouble before you know it. I don't recommend them as beginner bikes, but you're already past that point, so be extremely careful and don't let the flat torque curve corrupt you too much.  I use a 5700K LED H4 bulb from these guys. http://www.cyclopsadventuresports.com/3600-Lumen-LED-Headlight-bulb-for-DirtbikesDual-Sports_p_97.html the thing is great and required little to no modifications to install.  if you still have the license plate illuminator housing and it is intact i would like to get it off you, along with everything else (saddle, mudguard, etc). i have some hollowed out slash cut megaphones if you want some loud pipes that i would be glad to send your way. PM me and we can work out a deal.  bar end mirrors are popular but a lot of people report issues with the throttle side mirror interfering with the throttle.  LED turn signals are gonna be some work, you will need to set up a new flasher relay. LED brake lights, running lights and gauge lights are as easy as swapping bulbs. I would leave the idiot lights alone because most of those little wedge LEDs are polarized, so you might not get an important message (about temp or oil pressure) when you need too.  Might be wise to run things by here, before you spend money on it. Also, you should search the HC3 forum at triumphrat.net before ordering. Chances are someone else has tried it and has published their experiences for your benefit. http://www.triumphrat.net/hinckley-classic-triples/  if you don't read or research, you're bound to have some headaches. Especially with electrical swaps, considering the origin of your bike.  ride it like you stole it (they respond best like that) and keep the shiny side up.

I think they use their own numbering systems. You need the spring and the copper washer - I'd guess it's about $10 in the USA.  I don't have a picture guide, but it's easy to find the tensioner on the back of the cylinder block at the right hand side. Three bolts - two small ones to hold the tensioner body to the cylinder block, and a big one in between which retains the spring.

Triumph,368qxr,mister_wizard,1 point,Mon May 18 17:29:29 2015 UTC,"I owned an 08 Street Triple that I ended up putting 16k miles on and just bought an 09 Speed Triple that I really haven't had time to get to know yet.   The Street is definitely more nimble, and confidence inspiring. It feels tiny compared to any modern bike I've ridden and has more than enough power to get you in a lot of trouble (the reason I sold it and rode slow bikes for a while). Compared to the Speed it wants to get into the high revs quick and is very tempting if you have any sort of aftermarket exhaust. But at the same time you can easily ride it every day to work or take longish trips on it.  I'm still getting used to the Speed triple as far as riding goes, but the first impression is that it has higher quality components. (this may be different on the newer models) The fit and finish seems to be better on my 09 that is now 6 years old than my 08 street when it was two years old. Riding the Speed you do notice that it is heavier, but you get used to it just like any bike.   I wasn't in the situation where I could choose between the two, they both fell into my lap, and I am pretty loyal to the Triumph brand so I wasn't comparing to other brands. But I will say these two bikes are the best I've ever owned or ridden and if I had to choose I would choose both. You have to ride both if can, buy the one you can afford, or buy the one that comes to you."

Since they are different, you'd want to make sure your bar size was correct too. The standard Scrambler looks like it might be 3/4"" diameter where the t100/thruxtons are 1"" diameter."

In Colorado, bikes usually dont stay on the sales floor longer than a day. That being said, its a sellers market. Like the guy above said, its worth what you are willing to pay for it.

Triumph,35zkkg,RastaMcDabalot,1 point,Fri May 15 04:38:09 2015 UTC,"Is the price too high for a bike that old with that much mileage? Are these bikes known to last a lot longer assuming the previous owner(s) have maintained it well?   No. Yes.  if it's running good, you should buy it before someone else comes along. if it needs work, then take the price of work out of the sale price, but you probably won't be able to talk him down too far. $2500 is a good price for this bike with this miles (do not quote the KBB at me, these bikes are coveted and nearly collectible).  Personally, i think it's foolish to customize your first bike by sacrificing dependibility for aesthetics. it will make it more costly to maintain as you go along and you won't be able to ride while you are customizing it and getting the tuning set up. that being said, a handlebar swap won't be too much trouble during the riding season, same for other simple mods, YMMV.  Just ride it for a few months while it's summer and do your mods in the winter if you still want too. Save money for gas and gear, not farkle and aesthetic work. This hobby (life choice?) is about occasionally riding motorcycles not just looking at them all day. you can't see the bike when you are riding it anyway.  Good luck!  PS: i will be happy to take any parts you are taking off. i have some hollowed out slashcut megaphones i will trade/give you if you promise to leave those stock Pea-shooters alone.

Triumph,35zkkg,aDDnTN,1 point,Mon May 18 13:19:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice man. I ended up getting a steal but I'm a little confused. Hoping you can help.  When I walked up to the bike it said 1200 on the silver cover, instead of bringing it up I figured maybe the guy didn't realize and it works in my favor is I end up getting a 1200 instead of a 900 so I didn't bring it up. The bike needs a tune up but cosmetically its in great shape, not a chip or scratch on the paint. The seat as some small marks nothing serious.   I talked him to 1600 and he didn't really seem put up much of a fight. He was a vet and I think he is being stationed somewhere where he can't store the bike.   Now I've fallen for the classic stock look to keep the resale value up of this bike. I'm just confused on if it is a 1200 or a 900 with a 1200 cover. How can I find out. did they even make 1200's in 1996 models?  Ps. I've saved you in my books, so if I need to sell anything stock I will let you know."
Triumph,35zkkg,aDDnTN,1 point,Mon May 18 15:01:07 2015 UTC,"the only 1200cc bike triumph made in 96 was a trophy. it's basically the same engine with an extra cylinder.  i seriously doubt you have that. i also doubt it's possible to bore out a 900 to a 1200cc. maybe the PO had an issue impressing his harley friends or something so he put a sticker on it. Unless you have a larger engine with an extra cylinder, you don't have a 1200. imo, you should have asked about it, but you are a noob so i can understand why you thought you were getting a better deal. For the future, when buying a vehicle, any inconsistencies with known facts should be brought up and discussed to your satisfaction before completing the sale. Live and learn!  You say it needs a tune up. Was OP able to start it? Have you seen the bike run? have you ridden it?   $1600 is a great ridiculously low price for this bike if it is running and in mostly stock shape (ie, not bobbed/chopped/modded). at that price you practically stole it from him. no way i would ever part with my Hinckley Classic Triple for that little. That price is so low, i'm worried you got handed a hastily reassembled failed-project bike or something iffy.

It started right up, and It sounded like the sparks were not firing at the same time, but my friend rode it around and once it warmed up it was fine. He rode it home for me and he was blown by how quickly it picked up and how well it handled all the way home. I seriously feel like I got a deal that feels too good to be true. I've bought/sold a few cars so I know what you mean by asking all the questions especially if something seems off. Since everything was original and the bike seemed to be in almost perfect condition I wasn't too worried. Worst case I got a 900 with a 1200 sticker. Even for a 900 in this condition $1600 was a great deal.   If I go the cafe route, which I probably will, I was planning on unloading parts on ebay, but I'll definitely run it past you first."
Triumph,35zkkg,Mr--Beefy,1 point,Mon May 18 17:16:21 2015 UTC,"if that picture is the bike you bought, you have a 900.   also, you might assume that a classically-styled standard 900 triple is less motorcycle than a modern 600cc sport-oriented bike, but you would be wrong.  These bikes kick like a mule and take off like a scalded dog, but are mildly forgiving. You need to learn to compensate with the throttle for the lackluster suspension. You need to learn to ride it slow. it's easy to ride fast but you'll grow complacent and make a mistake at low speeds.  First thing i would get is get some superbike bars to replace those OEM mini-apes. Not clip-ons or clubmans, the triangle is all wrong for that to be remotely comfortable and functional. Don't start out handicapped, get things that aid your control not diminish it.  sharing the manual right now."

I'm not as heavy as you, but I can say that on my '13 triple R I can ride both myself (160-165) and my gf (< 150 but not sure) and it's not a problem at all for the suspension. No clue about stock."

But the results are often codes that are specific to each manufacturer. (have an 01 triple, so I assume yours also has the same system since its pretty close in age)  TL;DR - if it turned off. you are probably ok. If not, Or if happens repeatedly. Take it to your mechanic."

Triumph,35xbxs,Freakawn,2,Thu May 14 09:32:04 2015 UTC,"I get that on mine too, If I let mine sit for a while then the light goes off, a quick off/on doesn't do it. (mine happens after I gun it in traffic to escape a cage being stupid, and then shut it down hard. I think its a fuel mix thing)  That reminds me I really need to take my bike to my friend and check out what this light means."

If you don't want to remove them (or need them for something else) check out triumphrat (or the tuneboy/powercommander sites) if you can't find anyone that knows those systems here.

In that range there were a few deals for around $8500- $9000.  Use gumtree and bikesales and be willing to travel to get it ..... but.... don't buy interstate unless you want to start your new bike relationship with a Blue slip inspection.  The problem I found was how quickly the good examples were snatched up, you had to have your money in hand and be willing to buy without negotiation. I missed 3 or 4 deals because I was ""a day too late"".  I did end up not buying the STR, the brain said yes but the heart said no.

Triumph,35v5oi,J_L_,2,Wed May 13 19:50:01 2015 UTC,I've got the norman hyde m bars on 'upside down' and it's fine with the stock pegs. With their full drop though- my elbows can just about touch my knees. I wouldn't do clip-ons or ace bars without rearsets.
Triumph,35v5oi,banjotec,1 point,Wed May 13 22:31:02 2015 UTC,"Never ridden one like that, seems it would be pretty uncomfortable folded over like that. I'd just save the money and do both at the same time."

Triumph,35v5oi,savethemolarbears,1 point,Wed May 13 20:47:38 2015 UTC,"It would be pretty bad with clip-ons. Ace bars might be ok, depending on how low they are. Is this a matter of cost, or do you not like bending your knees that far?"
Triumph,35v5oi,ctesibius,1 point,Wed May 13 21:32:38 2015 UTC,"Actually, yes this is a cost matter. From what I've read, my main differences between a bonnie and a thrux is mainly the riding position. If I put rear sets on a bonnie with clipons and this brings me to the same riding position as a thruxton, then it makes sense for me to just buy the thruxton and customize that further?"
Triumph,35v5oi,ctesibius,2,Wed May 13 22:32:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I'm not sure how the prices compare, but I thought the Thruxton was quite a bit more. Also the base Bonnie has cast wheels - not quite as classic in look, but they are supposed to improve the handing."
Triumph,35v5oi,ccosby,1 point,Wed May 13 22:38:03 2015 UTC,"Someone on either here or the triumph rat forums mentioned where they were the thruxton was in a different, more expensive insurance class. Where ever he lived the brake even point for buying the parts was like less than 2 years. It is stupid for what amounts to the same bike but you may want to verify that if you want the thruxton instead as it might be cheaper to go with a bonneville and swap the parts later.   Past that buy whichever bike you like more. The base bonne has mag wheels and a 17 inch front. The thruxton has spoke and an 18 inch front. The bonneville t100 has a spoke 19 front.   Base bonneville and thruxton have the same rear fender, t100 is longer. All 3 have the exact same engine. The base bonneville also doesn't have a tach by default although you can add one. The foot controls are different on the thruxton.   You should end up happy with any of the bikes."
Triumph,35v5oi,SuicideKlutch,1 point,Thu May 14 00:59:41 2015 UTC,"Depending on your height, clip-ons might bring your knees a little to close to your elbows. Clubman bars were designed to alleviate this and yet achieve a similar clip-on look. The curve/angle of the clubmans puts the actual grip position a few inches further forward than a standard set of clip-ons would. I did this on my t100 and it works great with the standard peg position."
Triumph,35v5oi,SuicideKlutch,1 point,Wed May 13 22:08:09 2015 UTC,"If you are average height, the clip-ons will probably be fine. If you're  tall, I'd go with the clubmans."

Don't get clip ons just because it's part of the look, I've got a cafe'd cb with clip ons, longer rides is such a pain, hunched over and all. My street triple is so comfortable, riding position is fairly straight up, I can get a little more aggressive by just lending forward. But if you must you can get rear sets but not necessary"

Triumph,35qz0k,Meatballosaurus,2,Tue May 12 20:01:07 2015 UTC,"Wow, learned something today. I came here to suggest you look into a manual CCT, in case the vibration wasn't actually coming from the bars. That rpm range is notorious for cam chain vibration on our bikes. Sounds like you fixed the problem tho, and I didn't know you could have vibration in the bars cause of too little weight. Good stuff man, congrats on the success! Happy trails!"
Triumph,35qz0k,snowynh,1 point,Tue May 12 20:51:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I originally thought bar ends were just to protect the bike in drops, turns out they are actually a tuned damper to move the resonant frequencies of the handlebars. Since the Helibars are solid compared to the OEM bars, they needed a different weight to dampen them in the frequencies of interest. It was interesting to see how different peoples perception is though because through all the forums I searched, about half of the people that installed Helibars noticed the vibrations, other half did not."
Triumph,35qz0k,ARedditingRedditor,1 point,Tue May 12 21:26:11 2015 UTC,I recently installed some Helibar TracStar clip ons on my '06 Daytona and noticed a very annoying vibration between 6500-8000 rpm which is right where I'm at on the highway. I'm planning a pretty long trip coming up and new that was going to get really old really quick. Looking around I saw some people recommended certain throttle locks that replaced the bar ends and were heavier (they weighed in at 12.5 ounces to be exact). They were much more expensive than what I wanted to pay though so I found some stainless rod at work and started machining. I went with the same diameter and about twice as long with no taper like the stock ones. I ended up at 218 grams with the original ones weighing in at 66 grams. This has completely moved the vibrations out of any of my riding RPM's! I'm so happy with this setup now.
Triumph,35rzez,C4D30604,6,Wed May 13 00:43:44 2015 UTC,That price is insane. Get some Avon Roadriders. They're like 85 bucks a tire and better than OEM.

Triumph,35pi01,drwbry,3,Tue May 12 16:59:58 2015 UTC,There really wasn't much to it. My friend came up with the idea. It basically just uses some aluminum billet that I machined to replace the passenger peg and welded a fork mount that is meant for mounting bikes in truck beds. He then made a simple bar that mounts on the rear rack and the bike frame rests on that. I put together a quick album here. I wish I would have taken more pictures. Let me know if you have any questions. Biggest thing I would change is not using an anodized fork mount.

Triumph,35kuuc,M-Noremac,6,Mon May 11 09:19:00 2015 UTC,It is 360. The scrambler has the 270 firing angle. I would just assume it's a typo.  I don't think a whole lot of effort goes into the Triumph owners manuals.
Triumph,35kuuc,Decker81,2,Mon May 11 11:18:26 2015 UTC,"Correct.  Scrambler is 270 while the rest of the Bonneville setups are 360 (T100, SE, Thruxton, etc)"
Triumph,35kuuc,rottenpossum,5,Mon May 11 11:35:14 2015 UTC,America and Speedmaster use the same engine and are also 270.
Triumph,35kuuc,Yetibike,1 point,Mon May 11 12:22:39 2015 UTC,Also correct... sorry forgot to include those.  They use them for the sound more than performance differences correct?
Triumph,35kuuc,rottenpossum,1 point,Mon May 11 13:25:27 2015 UTC,And low end torque which is why the scrambler has it too
Triumph,35kuuc,DocOne,1 point,Mon May 11 22:54:37 2015 UTC,As a business Triumph is very poorly run and maintained. They fire their employees every 2 years or so and the organization with the sku numbers to the bikes and OEM parts is all fucked up for a lack of a better term.   Also has anyone actually tried to trace all the bonneville models from when each model came out and their differences? It can get super confusing. Bonneville - bonneville T-100 - Bonneville SE - Bonneville EFI - Bonneville T-100 EFI - Bonneville MAG wheel. And I'm pretty sure besides the MAG wheels there's not a lot of differences between the bikes.
Triumph,35kuuc,TheGetUpKid24,1 point,Mon May 11 15:42:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, well that's disappointing to hear."
Triumph,35kuuc,YZZERDD_com,1 point,Mon May 11 17:21:16 2015 UTC,Don't forget that the original Bonneville were T120s with the old 500cc models being t100s. Now the new Bonneville bikes are t100s. Should have been t160 or something like that. Triumph can't even keep their numbering system correct.
Triumph,35kuuc,aDDnTN,1 point,Wed May 13 07:31:14 2015 UTC,"Okay thanks, that's what I thought. It honestly wouldn't make all that much difference to me which one it has but it just really confused me when I read that in the manual."
Triumph,35kuuc,tryplusumph,3,Mon May 11 15:47:14 2015 UTC,"also, a 360 firing angle is not the same as a 360 crank.  the latter is describing the inertial balance of the crank, while the former describes the amount of rotation of the crank between cylinders firing.  a 360/180 provides a nice even idle and even power delivery across rpm range. a 270 firing angle makes the idle lope and sound like a v-twin, while it packs a bit more punch down low, it reduces the power at higher rpm in comparison.  that has to be a typo in the book, because the 270 firing angle has different power and torque numbers at different RPMS than the 360.  the inline triples all have 120 firing angles and feature a rotational inertia balanced crank that delivers power continuously and smoothly to the rear wheel."
Triumph,35lnwj,SMORKIN_LABBIT,2,Mon May 11 14:58:09 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure your fine. Your weight holds it down while riding. The side hooks will hold enough. I got hit a year ago and that piece snapped off and I lost one BC customs seat screw so now I'm riding with the same seat on a different bike with one seat screw till I replace them.
Triumph,35lnwj,TheGetUpKid24,2,Mon May 11 15:55:59 2015 UTC,"I accidentally got a battery that was slightly too large for the seat to hook in the front and I was fine putting the seat on and riding. the front might shift a centimeter or two if you push on it, but when you're seated and you have the screws in back connecting it, you'll be fine."
Triumph,35lnwj,raca,2,Mon May 11 19:04:00 2015 UTC,"That notch is super hard to hook in the slot. There's a good chance either you, or a previous owner took the seat off at one point and put it back on without realizing it wasn't in there correctly.   I had to hook my battery back up not too long ago, and had such a hard time with that one spot that I gave up, and had to come back to it the next day. It still took me forever to get it in there.   You should be fine, as others have said. I wish triumph made notch longer!"
Triumph,35lnwj,Johnny_Sailor,2,Tue May 12 01:41:51 2015 UTC,"I put on the BC cafe racer seat, and it was almost impossible to get the notch in position.   I ignored it and when I would stand on the pegs to go over bumps, the seat would bounce up and down. I don't think it was ""unsafe"", but it definitely didn't feel good, so I finagled with it until I could finally get it in there.   You could probably makeshift your own notch fairly easily if it becomes a nuisance and you are so inclined. I don't think you'd need to replace the seat either way."

Triumph,35ikyl,Rausage505,1 point,Mon May 11 03:49:35 2015 UTC,Thanks! This is my second bike and going up from a ninja 250... Wow... So much umph! I like the look of the Thruxton. Maybe one day I'll get to ride one.
Triumph,35ikyl,Rausage505,2,Mon May 11 04:57:02 2015 UTC,"ONE OF US! ONE OF US! ONE OF US!!!  Good looking bike ya got there... Time to tidy that tail, maybe get a pair of frame sliders?"
Triumph,35ikyl,wisepeasant,1 point,Mon May 11 03:49:09 2015 UTC,I'll definitely be adding character. Bar end mirrors are first on the list then the fender eliminator. I've been searching for things others do to their triples and adding frame sliders sounds like a great idea. Thanks!

Triumph,35iq7s,ccosby,1 point,Sun May 10 20:06:33 2015 UTC,Squeaky rear brakes is very common on bonnevilles.  Lots of threads about it.  My bonnie is just at 2000kms now and the squeak is still there but much improved and bearable.  Apparently most of the time it will go away before 3000kms/2000 miles
Triumph,35iq7s,mancubuss,1 point,Sun May 10 21:36:14 2015 UTC,I just ended up putting on some nice EBC pads which helped with the brakes(I took the time to wear out my first pads).   Congrats on the bike. I'd personally pull the secondary AI if you don't have emissions tests in your area so the pipes don't blacken at the top.   As far as the money goes I don't have one but a few people I know swear by the little dart screen. Also maybe better mirrors as I'm not a fan of the stock ones. Past that I'd say put it towards an arrow exhaust system.   Anyway enjoy the bike. My 14 black edition is now at almost 12k miles and I love it.
Triumph,35iq7s,ccosby,2,Sun May 10 21:40:46 2015 UTC,I have a scrambler. Can you elaborate on removing the ai? Pros? Cons?
Triumph,35iq7s,mancubuss,2,Mon May 11 00:23:33 2015 UTC,"Only real Con would be if you live in an area with emissions checks you'd need to reinstall it or the bike will fail.   British customs, newbonneville, bellacorse, all sell removal kits. The secondary air induction is the pipes in front of the spark plugs. Removing it lowers the exhaust temp(it pumps air in from the airbox to help burn off extra waste in the exhaust) which helps slowing the bluing of the pipes(in my case it was turning the top end of the headers black). The secondary ai is what gives you the bur bur bur as you let off the throttle. If you have better exhaust it might cause popping.   If you search the triumphrat forums you will find all the info you need on it."

Triumph,35ha7g,daeatenone,1 point,Sun May 10 21:12:28 2015 UTC,How's the exhaust? Do you need ear plugs at lower speeds/city riding?
Triumph,35ha7g,G-wow,2,Sun May 10 21:51:49 2015 UTC,Its okay - no don't need plugs.  Although I have ordered a DB killer/insert - more for the neighbours sake as I leave for work at 5.30am most mornings.  To be honest it sounds a lot like Royal Jordanain's Nuda (just a little quieter and with that triple whine):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnNnWctXhf8
Triumph,35ii0b,fish_taco_pirate,1 point,Sun May 10 18:30:19 2015 UTC,"Looks like that's a modified T100 in the pic. I'd assume that would fit a mag wheel. Seems to just mount at the rear footrest and under the seat.   Not sure you end goal, but I've been eyeing these for a nice small easily removable solution.   http://www.twistedthrottle.com/bags-connection-sport-pannier-system-for-triumph-thruxton-04-13  Wouldn't work if you're looking to mount larger hard cases."
Triumph,35ii0b,SoulCougher,1 point,Mon May 11 01:16:35 2015 UTC,"They probably would fit a mag wheel Bonnie. But beware--the T100 suspension is 10mm longer than the mag wheel, and since this rack mounts onto the suspension, you're going to need to do a little finagling to get the rack mounted."
Triumph,35fvab,bighousmous,1 point,Sat May 9 23:19:24 2015 UTC,"Be sure to get the ECU remapped if you haven't already. Got the same exhaust for my XC and it all but eliminated the decel popcorn burble noises while seemingly making the throttle response feel crisper. Took a hit in the gas mileage department, but that may be due to aggressively cranking on the throttle to get more of that sweet sound hahaha - enjoy!"
Triumph,35fvab,osakasan86,1 point,Sun May 10 08:06:47 2015 UTC,So I talked to the reps at TBR and they said I don't have to do anything once I slip the exhaust on. Did you notice something in the bike performance that made you remap the ECU?
Triumph,35fvab,osakasan86,1 point,Sun May 10 17:30:02 2015 UTC,My local triumph dealer recommended it when I took it in for scheduled maintenance. They did it for ~$30. Before it was remapped I was getting loud popping noises through the pipe on deceleration. Now this is just with the stock ECU I haven't gotten an aftermarket fuel controller.
Triumph,35dkzw,Jtones0009,4,Sat May 9 07:53:33 2015 UTC,Im thinking about buying the bonneville. Would you recommend them?
Triumph,35dkzw,gettindemdownvotes,4,Sat May 9 14:38:21 2015 UTC,If that's the kind of thing you are into then definitely.  It is a fun little bike.  Really loves running around town and hitting the back roads.  Doesn't really shine much on the interstate or over long distances so if you are doing it for travel you might want to consider other options.  I love mine and get compliments everywhere I go!
Triumph,35dkzw,gettindemdownvotes,1 point,Sat May 9 20:43:40 2015 UTC,Yeah Im kind of worried about its ability to go distances. I must say though Triumph nailed that classic motorcycle look.
Triumph,35dkzw,shiftygopher,1 point,Sun May 10 03:10:47 2015 UTC,"Bonnevilles are rated as great first bikes. Low height, good performance and tame performance curve, work well in all rides, have a middle of the road ride position (not a laid back chopper or aggressive street).  Only downside is they can be expensive, since people buy and keep them."
Triumph,35dkzw,Bits_Flapping,4,Sun May 10 01:21:45 2015 UTC,Nice. What mods did you make?
Triumph,35dkzw,KirbyinAustin,4,Sat May 9 16:14:06 2015 UTC,"I moved all the signals to make it more streamlined.  Added the fender eliminator kit which I really think changes the overall look in a great way.  I put a stone guard on the headlight (it's there, trust me).  Obviously, the seat which really really improves the ride.  It is a little higher (I'm only 5'6 so it matters) but maybe 3/4 of an inch over stock.  I also replaced the stock foot pegs, the rubber always grabbed my jeans and were bulky and in the way.  The Joker ones I got are awesome and I totally recommend them.    Edit*: I also had bar end mirrors and fork covers added at time of purchase.  Forgot about those."
Triumph,35dkzw,shiftygopher,1 point,Sat May 9 20:46:54 2015 UTC,"I really think Triumph should sell the Bonnie's without fenders and have a ""fender addition kit"" for those who like the original look. It seems most people like them without the fenders and I would agree. Nice bike btw!"
Triumph,35dkzw,KirbyinAustin,2,Sat May 9 23:01:50 2015 UTC,I totally agree and thanks!
Triumph,35dkzw,chrisg67,2,Sat May 9 23:49:37 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The fender serves a real purpose. Removing it, for looks, is great and all, but I like having mine and I'd be pissed if I had to shell out 300-500$ for a 'fender kit'.  Edit: just wanted to mention that I ride pretty much year round in Dallas, so rain/etc. are a problem. I like the fender removal kits, just can't get along without mine."

Triumph,35dkzw,xtrategist,1 point,Sat May 9 13:57:34 2015 UTC,The seat really absorbs the road vibrations.  The stock seat does a poor job of protecting the rider from pothole impact or general vibration fatigue.  If you like doing long rides in the country or out on back-roads then a seat upgrade should definitely be in your future!

Triumph,35d342,paulohnine,3,Sat May 9 04:19:54 2015 UTC,"My dealer told me that the Thruxton is a Bonnie, just with a lot of custom stuff pre-installed, and a lot cheaper than you could do it yourself.  I'm sure for a price they could install one for you.  That said, it's really not that hard to shift without one, especially on something you own and ride all the time.  The tach is basically showing what your wrist is doing.  Open the throttle this much, need to shift.  I have a tach but I never look down at it to shift while I'm riding.  I want to watch the road, not my instruments."
Triumph,35d342,WittyLoser,2,Sat May 9 04:32:10 2015 UTC,"I can swear they had a tach.... I just picked up a new thruxton, which is essentially the same bike, and its got a tach.   Also, I had a similar problem with riding a bike without tach. I feel like I need to be able to ""read"" what the engine is doing to have better control.

Triumph,35d342,AIM-9enema,2,Sat May 9 04:29:16 2015 UTC,"The Bonneville Base model with mag wheels is a speedo only.  The dealership can install the triumph tach, I had this done for my wife's '14 Bonneville. Thus essentially bringing it up to the the other models, I.E.  T100, Thruxton, and new scramblers which all have both gauges. It's a simple, almost just a plug it in, operation for a few $, £ €, ¥...   For your second question,  the standard Bonneville is very comfortable.  The bars can be adjusted or changed to suit your needs for being in the most comfortable spot.  And if you are tall you can also purchase new handlebar risers that allows for further customisation.  Your local dealer should have no problem helping you."

Triumph,35d342,SonofUlysses,2,Sat May 9 07:47:01 2015 UTC,I've got a mag wheeled Bonnie that had a tachometer added as an option when it was bought new by the previous owner. Any Triumph dealer will be able to fit one.  It's not listed on the US Triumph website as far as I can see but it's on the UK one. This is the part you need.   http://www.triumphmotorcycles.co.uk/accessories/electrical/2013/tacho-conversion-kit-a9828007?returnUrl=/accessories/?selectedBikeModel={9D582720-6CC9-449A-A176-491D93580703}&selectedBikeName=Bonneville  As you can see it includes a new bracket to house both dials.   To be honest although I've got a tach I rarely look at it. I've always changed by feel on all my bikes and cars. After a few miles you soon get the feel of what the engine is doing.   I believe the Bonneville has a rev limiter as well so you won't over rev it.
Triumph,35d342,mattfki5g,2,Sat May 9 08:49:13 2015 UTC,I bought the basic Bonneville a few years ago and added the Triumph tach myself.  It was easy peasy and I'm not good with mechanical stuff.

Triumph,35a2ae,motang21,1 point,Sun May 10 11:50:33 2015 UTC,"Is there a reason why it's $95,000.00 used where I live? Was it an expensive car when it came out?"
Triumph,35a2ae,motang21,1 point,Sun May 10 19:44:24 2015 UTC,"I take it you live in the States. New over here it's roughly $45,000. Used you could pick one up from the 90s for around $8000. The reason they're so expensive over there is that Land Rover tried to break the American market with the Defender but failed, making them quite rare over there. Secondly, it doesn't meet US safety standards for cars, no crumple zone, it's just a rigid steel chassis with aluminium body work, basically a ladder with an engine on it. So you would have to fit an external roll cage and a few other mods to make it legal, which is pretty expensive. If the police caught you with one without the mods they'd seize it and crush it.   They're very basic vehicles, practically a farm vehicle but they're pretty common everywhere except the U.S. Apparently 70% of all Land Rovers built since the 1940s are still running today, so they're brilliantly reliable.   I'm sure you could make a tidy living off buying cheap one in Europe and selling them in the US!"

Triumph,357qjs,seathru,5,Fri May 8 01:16:03 2015 UTC,"There's basically two trains of thought:    Break-in periods are real and you can limit the ultimate HP of your engine by not following the manufacturer suggestion   OR   They're BS/lawyer safeguards and the best way to really break in your engine is to flog the shit out of it and quickly seat the rings   Many people will swear the first way gives you better performance, many people will swear the second way gives you better performance. Pretty sure the truth of the matter is that even if you don't follow the break-in, you're not going to damage your engine, it just might be possible it won't be ""perfectly efficient"" and you'll lose a few HP. Or the second camp is right and breaking it in slowly is what actually causes the HP loss. People argue about it all the time.  If you're interested in the 1st train of though, consult your manual. If you're interested in the 2nd train of thought you can find some info here http://www.mototuneusa.com/break_in_secrets.htm"

Triumph,3545u5,shiftygopher,1 point,Thu May 7 04:54:36 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. It's also a chance to have (a reputable) dealer check for anything with excessive wear, tell you if your oil shows signs of water intrusion or degredation, or excessive metal shavings, possibly work on any factory recall issues, possibly update the program, and other things.  I'm not claiming it's worth it, but I have had people on reddit literally scream at me (in messaging) about how stupid I was for taking my bike to the dealership for any reason.  Personally I do it because I have 1 service interval every few years, and the mechanics see a lot more bikes than I do so will catch anything wrong (and have incentive to fix it, more $$).  But mostly because I have quite literally no space to work on a bike. My apartment has individual parking spots for each unit, no spares, and what isn't parking is driving."

Triumph,352c0u,TsMini,4,Wed May 6 16:43:51 2015 UTC,Agree with yakimushi 100% - do not let the Arrow go.
Triumph,352c0u,yakimushi,4,Wed May 6 17:47:24 2015 UTC,"IMHO, no. Especially if it's the low mount. One, it's hella expensive so if you change your mind, you take a hit. Two, the stock cans are really heavy. Three, the underseat exhaust was easily the one thing I could not stand about the Street Triple. Way too much heat in the summer, and I ride a Triumph Scrambler now (so that's saying something considering the exhaust placement on that). Four, undertail exaust limits your luggage options, namely saddle bags.  If it's an Arrow low mount, get that."

I found the screens within the tank were getting blocked by a crystalline growth, (6 months of storage per year because snow),  so I cut-off the tops to allow the fuel to flow freely, and installed a clear inline filter.   NOTE: there is still screen at the bottom of the tubes, so any debris at the bottom of the tank should not enter the petcock and potentially retard it's operation, however slender the chance may be.  I also removed the inaccessible in-line filter just before the line splits to each carb.  The clear filter also allows you to confirm that fuel is actually flowing. Great for troubleshooting.  ."

Triumph,352t5d,Puntas13,1 point,Wed May 6 17:14:09 2015 UTC,"The switch is because the pipes for the 73 were a different size than the 650s and 750s of any year, and even the 500 of every other year, Making them near impossible to source. I tried a bunch of places before making this decision.  Keep in mind the old triumph push in pipes relied on a balance pipe to hold them in place. No bolts or other means of fastening the pipes into the head. The spigot allows for having unbalanced pipes, while maintaining a solid mount.  I fear my only choice will be to remove the head and get a pro welder to put a bead on them. But there is always hope in a place like this :) There are some crazy inventive people here."
Triumph,352t5d,Puntas13,1 point,Wed May 6 17:19:07 2015 UTC,"Strange. There were a few heads with the spigots for sale on ebay, assuming they fit, for under $100. I'd imagine you'd have more than that tied up in the welding and machine work.   You could maybe try shimming the spigots and tapping them into the head."
Triumph,352t5d,TotesMessenger,1 point,Wed May 6 18:31:43 2015 UTC,I hadn't thought of shims. Thanks for the idea. I think for this year I will just put a bead of jbweld around the outside end of the spigot and hope it doesn't vibrate out before winter. Then do a proper job of getting custom spigots made and the head tapped out a bit.  Unless someone has a horror story to match my idea.
Triumph,351zge,headphonesilence,2,Wed May 6 13:06:28 2015 UTC,"It's not a choke but a fast idle. If the bike doesn't want to run without the fast idle pulled out than increase the idle speed.

Triumph,351zge,mattfki5g,1 point,Wed May 6 16:27:17 2015 UTC,I had the very same problem as OP on my 2015 Scrambler and it was indeed related to the idle speed. Dealer told me to set it back to 1000 rpm and it went back to functioning normally.  Here it is.
Triumph,351zge,PlauditeCives,1 point,Wed May 6 20:20:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm gonna play around with it some more although I had the guys at the shop set it to what they recommended. I didn't ask what RPM and don't have a rev counter so i'm playing it by ear.
Triumph,351zge,unkmi3390,2,Wed May 6 22:09:41 2015 UTC,"My scramby's the same way, it dies even when blipping the throttle on startup.  2hr rides and it still wants the tickover adjustment on startup.  Asked my dealer about this and they said that of the plus sides of the EFI is that there's very little fuel just sitting around in the engine, it's less of an heat issue than a fuel availability one.  Use the choke, even if it's for two seconds.  Cheers."
Triumph,351zge,SampsonRustic,1 point,Wed May 6 17:09:49 2015 UTC,"This is correct. I have the same issue.

Triumph,350zy4,themanster93,2,Wed May 6 05:06:27 2015 UTC,"Ive ridden a street and currently own a speed.  The speed makes a lot more low end poke than the street does, much more muscular from 2.5k to 4.5krpm.  Ive not ridden a really hot V twin, so I cant compare there, but its a much less peaky than most I4 engines.  The rest of the bike is a gem.  My speed is about to have its first birthday, no warranty claims, no real issues.  Im not the biggest fan of the off-on throttle response, though I believe it can be tuned out easily.  The gearbox is kinda clunky in some rev ranges during shifting, but the ratios are nice and with such a flexible motor, it doesnt really need to be worked too hard.  It kinda rides a bit like a big dirt bike to sit on, or like a moderately upright japanese standard, but with a healthy smack of power.  The wide bars make it steer like a champ."

I've dragged mine, raced it, toured 1000+km a day for days on end, commuted and back road scratched on it. Hasn't skipped a beat for me. Less lowdown punch than a V twin but definitely more top end. I can't think of any real problems with them that you should be aware of aside from standard owner maintenance ones. One thing to be aware of is that the Street and Speed Triples are totally different beasts, despite the fact that people STILL mistake mine for a Speed when I tell them/they see it. So be aware of that when you're hunting for one. Good luck, you likely won't turn back from a triple once you've experienced one."

Triumph,350zy4,PM_ME_UR_BIKE,1 point,Wed May 6 19:40:08 2015 UTC,"Generally pretty comparable. I was a Triumph parts guy for a couple years, best thing about parts backup is you can still get every single part for every single bike Hinckley has put out. I ordered a complete fairing set for a 1000 Daytona at one point, and they're rare to begin with. That said I've only had to replace the o2 sensor cos I broke it installing an Arrow exhaust, although I've done a lot of mods to mine."
Triumph,350d9g,Bo7a,2,Wed May 6 01:32:22 2015 UTC,"I bought this off my mother in 1995 and drove the shit out of it while being a broke college student with two kids, and then a broke ass autobody/construction grunt. I put many thousands of miles on this girl between daily commute (sometimes in the snow), and the many many weekend trips that kept me sane.   I would often have to make my own parts or do ridiculous things to make it run just to get to work.  Need pipes? rip them off an old buick, bribe a muffler shop guy with a 6pack, and bend the hell out of the pipes yourself until they look like they'll stay on. Then cut 4 inches off your old pipes and weld them inside the big buick pipes so they will fit in the head, and then weld some rough steel from the pipe to the frame to stop it falling out.  Clutch cable snapped and you can't afford a new one? Weld a cupboard handle to it at the point where the seat meets the gas tank and pray you don't need two hands while shifting.  Breather hose flew off on the highway? washing machine hose works! And as a bonus it will oil your chain.  About 6 years ago I couldn't afford the plates so I parked it at a bro's house while I went up north planting trees. 10 months later I stumbled out of the bush with enough cash to cover my debts and put plates on the bike, so I went straight to his house. When I walked into his garage I was greeted to my baby in 5 dust covered boxes in the corner. Wiring harness cut off at the switches, half the parts in primer, the rest in a thick coat of rust.  ""I didn't hear from you. I thought you abandoned it""  Ouch.  Fast-forward to now. ~5 years later and I am making decent money at a secure job so I figure it's time to re-join the club.  The imgur album linked will follow the progress over the next few weeks as I turn 20 years of bad decisions into a friend I am happy to show off again.  tl;dr: Old friend with many scars being brought back to life and making an old(ish) biker tell long rambling stories that go nowhere.  [Edit] - Spelling [Edit 2] - My wife just reminded me what year it is. Making my timeline wrong. It has been more like 9 years since I parked it."

Triumph,34xp9o,AIM-9enema,5,Tue May 5 14:56:22 2015 UTC,There's only one real difference to consider here since the two bikes are basically identical. On the Bonneville you sit straight up in a more relaxed position and on the Thruxton you crouch in a more traditional sport position. Otherwise all the actual mechanical bits are completely interchangeable.   Can't go wrong either way. With proper maintenance the engine should be good for at least 50k.
Triumph,34xp9o,Miglin,3,Tue May 5 17:40:15 2015 UTC,50 k? i know a guy with a 2 year old thruxton who just passed 80k and still going very strong.  he commutes about 160 miles a day on it.

Triumph,34xp9o,SampsonRustic,1 point,Tue May 5 23:37:05 2015 UTC,"I have a 2014 Bonneville SE and couldn't be happier. I checked out the whole range while I was at the dealership and found the basic Bonne to suit my needs the best. It rides like a dream and is surprisingly quick and nimble (Full disclosure: I previously had a Sportster). If I had to pick some negatives about the bike I'd say the controls and the brake fluid reservoir feel really cheap (solvable problem,  I know) and driving in traffic puts me near the top of first gear but not enough for second and with the SEVERE engine braking it can  make for a less than smooth ride unless you're always on the clutch. But it more than makes up for it if you've got some twisty roads near you.  Also, I hope you don't mind old timers telling you about the Bonnevillies they had back when they were younger and that they are surprised that your bike is brand new because it looks just like the old one they had in the 60s."
Triumph,34xp9o,BaconEveryMeal,2,Tue May 5 13:16:21 2015 UTC,"No not at all about getting advice from a ""old timer"" haha! Can you explain what your mean when you say ""severe engine brake? I am very new to the motorcycle scene haha. My best friend has a Harley Davidson Iron head 883 and he would let me cruise around on it and get a feel for the the bike because he knows I am interested in getting one. Every since then i've wanted a motorcycle. I would see videos on Youtube of riders on a Triumph Bonneville and they would so agile on the bike on twisty road haha."
Triumph,34xp9o,BaconEveryMeal,5,Tue May 5 13:42:56 2015 UTC,If you've ever driven a manual of any kind (car or motorcycle) when you are in gear and you come off the throttle the resistance from the engine slows you down. On the bonnie it feels like you are practically slamming the brakes on when you do that. So to keep it smooth you need to apply some clutch when you do it. Other bikes I've had you could putter in traffic in 1st without needing the clutch but the combination of the engine braking when you come off the throttle and the surprising rate the bike wants to take off when you get on it you need to mange it with some clutch. I did a charity ride on it as soon as I got it last year and by the end my left hand was basically dead from all the work it got.
Triumph,34xp9o,08wasGreat,2,Tue May 5 14:15:27 2015 UTC,"Do you know if this issue is related to fueling that could be solved with the various aftermarket exhausts, airbox/O2 sensor removals, and remapping? I have the same issue riding in city traffic in 1st gear below 2500 RPM. I feel like I need to modulate the clutch the entire time, otherwise it is super jumpy."
Triumph,34xp9o,DocOne,2,Tue May 5 17:05:42 2015 UTC,How old is your bike?  The Triumph cush drives are pretty shit and if that goes bad the bikes are crazy jumpy/jerky at low rpms
Triumph,34xp9o,BaconEveryMeal,1 point,Tue May 5 20:45:01 2015 UTC,"It's a 2014, it behaved that way out of the box. I had read about removing the air injection (since I don't live in CA that would be ok) and that helps a bit. It's only really a problem at a specific speed...but that happens to be the average speed of moderate traffic in these parts."
Triumph,34xp9o,shiftygopher,1 point,Wed May 6 13:56:12 2015 UTC,"I -think- you cannot remove the air systems on fuel injected bikes. The fuel controllers will adjust the fuel/air mixture dynamically, which renders that moot.  I also think it hoses something badly, but I can't remember what."

Triumph,34xp9o,ShinySpoon,1 point,Tue May 5 23:33:24 2015 UTC,What would be considered high mileage for a Triumph? If anyone could enlighten me? There are some great Triumphs for sale on craiglist I think the highest one I saw was a 2009 Bonneville with 9500 miles on it.
Triumph,34xp9o,DocOne,2,Tue May 5 15:25:03 2015 UTC,"9500 miles in not that many. Just past its second oil change. Next oil change is at 12000.  Edit: sorry, I didn't really answer your question. A high mileage modern Triumph would probably be 70-80k. But even then they are pretty easy to work on and a rebuild would bring it back into great running condition. I'd consider a 2009 with only 9,500 miles to still be fairly new. That's only 60 miles a week in a 6month riding season, or 30 a week if riding year round."
Triumph,34xp9o,Zacish,2,Tue May 5 15:51:39 2015 UTC,"The new Triumphs will run forever.  My 03 Speedmaster has > 50,000 miles and (after some optional work, except the new clutch plates and springs) actually runs better than new."

Triumph,34xp9o,foot-long,1 point,Tue May 5 19:45:37 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat, but throw in the scrambler as well. The reason I didn't get the thruxton, I wasn't a big fan of the colors available and I didn't like the rear set controls as much as the scrambler or bonneville. The higher scrambler exhaust seemed like it would get hot if I was stuck in a traffic jam.  I ended up with a Bonneville T100 as I like the spoked wheels and the taller riding position."

Triumph,34xp9o,SampsonRustic,1 point,Tue May 5 21:17:02 2015 UTC,As far as I can tell: If you buy a T100 you end up spending $$$ to make it look more like a Thruxton or a Scrambler. If you buy a Thruxton you end up spending $$$ to make it look more like a T100 or a Scrambler. If you buy a Scrambler you end up spending $$$ on knobbly tires and ammo can panniers.

Triumph,34xp9o,shiftygopher,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:40:07 2015 UTC,Nothing yet but I have decided to get a Bonneville. There is just something about it that I like. I just graduated college and finally paid off all my college tuition. So i'm in saving mode and new job mode lol. So the plan is to save up a few thousand and put a down payment on it. Once I purchase one I will have to post a pic on here.........hopefully soon :(
Triumph,34xp9o,DocOne,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:12:55 2015 UTC,"Not sure how far you want to drive, but check out Triumph in Manayunk (Philly).  They gave me a pretty ok deal on a new 2014, there are still a few left.  Depending on how much you want to spend, they aren't horrible (considering they have no miles on them and full warranties).  They also probably cycle through a fair used inventory."
Triumph,34xp9o,shiftygopher,0,Fri Jun 12 12:06:22 2015 UTC,"My advice: Buy a cheap, used, bike first.  Now, Bonnevilles are great first bikes. They're low, they're light, they're easy to handle and have a comfortable ride position.  They also get decent mileage and have a good (for new riders) power curve.  I've been riding mine for 2 years (2013 SE).  I only recommend buying something else used as a first bike because you're likely to drop it, and Bonnevilles, while great, don't have ABS. I really wish mine did. They also don't have any other features; they have fuel injection and a spedo, that's it.  For 9,000$ (2015 new) you can buy a LOT more bike.  I got caught in the 'had to have a Bonneville' thing when I first picked up riding, and I learned a long time ago that I love riding, not specific brand.  While I do love my bike, and the way it looks, I'd love riding just as much on anything else, too  If you pick up a slightly cheaper learner bike for 6 months, you can figure out if you love riding, then jump up to the more expensive options.  Plus most of the cheap, entry level, bikes hold their value pretty well, so you won't be taking much of a hit when you resell it."
Triumph,34xp9o,DocOne,2,Tue May 5 17:12:19 2015 UTC,"That whole ""likely to drop it"" is nonsense.  I wouldn't recommend a new rider to get a GSXR 1000 or anything but not because they'll drop it, it's because something like that will get away from you in a hurry and do a lot more damage than a scratched tank and a bent lever."
Triumph,34xp9o,shiftygopher,1 point,Tue May 5 18:09:19 2015 UTC,"That whole ""likely to drop it"" is nonsense.   No it isn't.  New riders are most likely to fall over because they don't understand how riding works. Falling over does damage to the bike. Damage to cheaper, older, bikes, is easier to repair than new and expensive bikes."
Triumph,34xp9o,DocOne,0,Tue May 5 18:31:06 2015 UTC,"How did you get a downvote button? Which by the way isn't a disagree button.  Dropping a bike and crashing a bike are 2 different things.  I've never even seen a person drop a bike just because they were new and I've been riding since I was 4 years old, I started on dirt at 4 years old. I'm 34 now.   If people ride within their skill level, regardless of where that level is, dropping/crashing is extremely rare.  Some actual crashes are unavoidable and caused by other drivers but those don't depend on how new your bike is."
Triumph,34xp9o,shiftygopher,1 point,Tue May 5 18:42:27 2015 UTC,"Dropping.  Not crashing. The two are different.  Dropping a bike because of too low speed, or because you brain fart on the kick stand, or because you hit a patch of grease on the stop light, etc. are all more likely to happen when you're a new rider. Which is all I said."
Triumph,34xp9o,DocOne,0,Tue May 5 19:03:35 2015 UTC,"I know what you said.  And what I'm saying is that the risk of dropping a bike is incredibly low and entirely overblown.  A patch of grease?  You don't need to be new to hit a patch of grease.  Low speed drops don't happen nearly as much as the reddit army thinks they do for the simple fact that new riders don't have the confidence to really even lean a bike, especially at low speed...especially on something as relatively light and anemic as a Bonneville."
Triumph,34xp9o,shiftygopher,1 point,Tue May 5 19:15:14 2015 UTC,"You can disagree, whatever. The simple facts are that, no mater what your anecdotes tell you, people can, do, and will, drop bikes when they are new riders.  Drops are more common the newer the rider, for a variety of reasons.

I agree, the prevalence of drops is higher in new riders but what you're missing is that just because the rate Is higher doesn't mean the outcome is likely.  Odds are still tiny that you'll drop your bike, regardless of time in the saddle...thanks for playing."

Triumph,34xp9o,DocOne,1 point,Fri May 8 18:31:55 2015 UTC,"That's fine, but dropping a bike in a garage, or driveway, or off a stand has nothing to do with experience.  That's my whole point.

Triumph,34xp9o,SampsonRustic,1 point,Fri May 8 19:30:21 2015 UTC,"I see your point but I also think a noob rider is just much more likely to drop a bike, especially if its a larger, heavy 900 as opposed to a 400 pound ninja."
Triumph,34xp9o,DocOne,2,Fri May 8 19:33:17 2015 UTC,"Again, same can be said for anyone.  I'm all sorts of experienced and I'm much more likely to drop a 900lb Road King than I am my 500lb Speedmaster, actually less than 500lb at this point.  And like I said to the other dude, I'm not denying a new rider is more likely to drop a bike, I'm saying that just because it's more likely to happen doesn't mean that it is likely to happen overall.    New riders can get over their heads in a hurry with some modern bikes, no doubt, but it's not because of the risk of drop, it's because some affordable bikes today have the same HP as a small car but 1/6 the weight."
Triumph,34xp9o,ctesibius,1 point,Fri May 8 21:04:50 2015 UTC,of course. I just think bigger bikes (or new bikes that you are more worried about damagin) can inhibit the speed at which a new rider learns fundamental skills - i gained most of my skills riding the crap out of my first 250.
Triumph,34xp9o,shiftygopher,1 point,Fri May 8 22:10:23 2015 UTC,"Haha for sure, I learned most of my skills on dirt on mostly CR250's, my uncle was sponsored by Honda(then Kawasaki) and had tons of free bikes while I was growing up.  Before that, I had a Suzuki 50 before I had a pedal bike, then a Suzuki 80.  The first street bike I ever rode was a '98 CBR 919RR though, when I was 17.  My uncle had a couple of those as well."
Triumph,34xp9o,ctesibius,0,Fri May 8 22:28:36 2015 UTC,"The handling is stable and predictable. You can chuck it around in low speed manoeuvres without anything grounding. I recommend Avon Roadrider tyres as they seem to suit the bike well for both grip and mileage.   Engine performance is quite conservative. Don't expect to blow off SV650s, but it will cruise at freeway / motorway speeds with throttle in hand. Comfort is good apart from the standard seat, which I found uncomfortable at 80 miles. I fitted a gel seat for a Scrambler to my Bonnie, which gave me about 400 miles of comfort and also looked better in my opinion. That illustrates a charm of the Bonnie family: you can mix and match.   Maintenance is very easy, other than the slight annoyance of getting to the two seat bolts. Doing the valves requires a Triumph special tool, but all Triumph tools seem to be cheap and once you have it, the job is unusually quick and easy.   I'd prefer stronger brakes. The ones it has do work, but I'm used to better. There are various solutions for upgrading them if it bothers you."

Triumph,34wlzh,ARedditingRedditor,2,Tue May 5 12:43:28 2015 UTC,You can do it yourself. Take a flat head screwdriver and there's a notch on the top and bottom of the forks and right at the base of the rear shock (the manual will help you find them and figure what's what)  Ride the bike around a bit and have a feel for suspension on the roads you'll ride. If its too hard and bumpy turn the compression and rebound down a click (quarter turn) if its too soft turn it up a click. The manual tells you which way to turn it. Make sure you turn it the same on both side of the forks and make a note in the manual how much you have turned it down.  I found it was too stiff from new. I turned compression down 1 click and rebound down 1 click and now its perfect. If you need photos I can do you some later when I get home just let me know   Here's mine http://i.imgur.com/0joxUiOh.jpg

Triumph,34uqoj,L3xicaL,2,Mon May 4 23:25:43 2015 UTC,I still need to find out if that wind screen does anything....
Triumph,34uqoj,P1umbersCrack,1 point,Tue May 5 01:14:44 2015 UTC,I might take it off for the sake of science.   I rode it about an hour home on the freeway and it was noticeably more tolerable than on an FZ-07 with a bigger wind screen. Probably just the seating position though.
Triumph,34uqoj,minus0,1 point,Tue May 5 02:44:11 2015 UTC,"I have the windscreen on mine. It helps. Not like when I ride the Daytona, but it makes the wind that does hit me (I tend to sit straight up when commuting and I'm 6'4) much more tolerable.  Shorter people may be able to get fully below it though."
Triumph,34uqoj,P1umbersCrack,1 point,Tue May 5 03:48:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies.  I'm 5'11"" and don't commute on it but I love riding - 11K on my 14 STR - and just trying to find ways to make the longer hauls more comfortable."
Triumph,34uqoj,minus0,1 point,Tue May 5 04:59:37 2015 UTC,I would assume that and the comfort seat would help you out. No experience with the comfort seat though. Looking at buying one shortly for my next long ride.
Triumph,34uqoj,G-wow,1 point,Tue May 5 05:14:52 2015 UTC,"The FZ was indeed my first bike. I was thinking over my ~9 month progression from MSF course to Street Triple and I have to say I was pleased with learning on the FZ. If I had gotten the STriple right away, I probably would have been less go-get-em about pushing my comfort zone and improving. With sliders on the FZ weeks after getting it I wasn't afraid to really go after the low speed maneuvers.   People harp on it a lot, but the whole ""get a beater first bike, sell it for what you paid and get what you want next"" is definitely the way to go now that I've been through it. In retrospect, a used mid 2000's SV650 (or FZ) would have been perfectly fine and I would have gone the same route, plus saved a couple of grand in the process."

Triumph,34vjqf,For_the_Juice,1 point,Mon May 4 22:28:26 2015 UTC,"Follow this guide. The general concept is the same for your bike, and so are the sag measures: Front @ 35-40m; Rear @ 30-35mm. It's also recommended that you set your sag after a good ride so that the fork oil is warm. That way you'll get better results.    Also, check out the forums (Triumph675 and TriumphRat) for a few ready made suspension settings, like this one. But remember, suspension is a very personal subject and the perfect setup of one person might be awful for another."

Triumph,34s0ef,minus0,1 point,Mon May 4 15:36:43 2015 UTC,"Take this with a grain of salt as I'm some random guy on the internet. I read a lot about the break in period prior to getting my bike. I also talked with the mechanic there. The biggest take away was ""ride it like you stole it, but try to not hold it at the same RPMs for extended periods of time"".   I did just that, taking it through the entire power band. Maybe I was just lucky, but 2 years (March 14, 2013 was my purchase date) later and about 21,500 miles later and I have not had a single problem with the bike, short of the alternator being replaced. Engine has performed like a champ. I don't ride it easy in the twisty roads, I commute daily (sold my car and only ride this), and I've ridden from sunshine to snow.  Your call how you want to approach it, just don't skimp on getting the services done as needed. Enjoy the bike, it is a great one!"
Triumph,34s0ef,SampsonRustic,1 point,Tue May 5 00:05:57 2015 UTC,enjoy man! Stay safe.
Triumph,34tldy,harukai,3,Mon May 4 13:27:47 2015 UTC,I had a thruxton and went to a daytona.  I felt safer at higher speeds for some weird ass reason.  I suppose I just couldn't chill out and cruise.  Have you considered a street triple?  I have both and they are both completely different bikes in terms of handling and power delivery.
Triumph,34tldy,d3v1c3,2,Mon May 4 15:03:31 2015 UTC,"That's how I feel with the Daytona. It just keeps wanting to go fast even when I just want to chill out. I've heard nothing but praise for the striple. Might expand my search into those but they are pretty rare where I live (had to drive 2 states over to get my Daytona). I definitely fell in love the engine characteristics of the I-3. Was the Thruxton much different in that regard? Thanks for the input man, I appreciate it."
Triumph,34tldy,TheBucketeer,2,Mon May 4 16:03:08 2015 UTC,"If you can, test drive the street triple and bonnie. I have the triple, it's a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde bike. It's great for cruising around town, and reasonably comfortable. Open the thottle and it's a growling torque monster."
Triumph,34tldy,d3v1c3,2,Mon May 4 17:30:11 2015 UTC,Thruxton was grunty but lacked top end speed.  I never took mine over 85 because I hated the instability.  I miss the bike because of the chill factor and the beauty but I'm happier with the two I have now.  Bonneville is the same engine so no differences between the Thruxton other than cosmetic.  When riding in the city I feel more at ease on the striple. When I'm on the highway the Daytona whips ass. But I'm usually never really sitting down.
Triumph,34tldy,fernando_69,1 point,Mon May 4 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and we'd never know who he fucks and when?"
Triumph,34tldy,ARedditingRedditor,1 point,Tue May 5 13:03:50 2015 UTC,There are some dealers that will ship it to you for a reasonable price. you can find some on Cycletrader.com
Triumph,34tldy,bobthemunk,2,Tue May 5 21:10:33 2015 UTC,"+1 for Street Triple. If you like the engine, the Street Triple base model gives a bit more of a comfortable riding position but with all the positives of the Daytona I3"
Triumph,34tldy,SampsonRustic,2,Mon May 4 18:46:39 2015 UTC,"I can say having ridden different styles of bikes, the bonnie will feel extremely slow and sluggish to you, as would any standard, upright, naked. But what it lacks in speed, it makes up for in style and classic vibes. It will take probably a month of daily riding to really find it, but there is true beauty in the bonnie that will make you want to enjoy A>B more than seeing how quickly you can get from A>B. Thruxton will kind of put you in the middle and just make you wish you still had the daytona.  Real answer is go for a test ride."
Triumph,34tldy,xmastreee,2,Mon May 4 16:37:45 2015 UTC,"I had a Speed Triple 955i and switched to a Scrambler. The triple was too fast for me, I figured I would either get into trouble or crash. It's a much better bike than I am a rider. So, I sold it and bought the Scram instead. It's a completely different animal. Much more laid back and relaxing, but it's not great if you're in a hurry. On the motorway, cruising at 70mph, I really notice the wind and whilst the bike will do more, I really don't like to push it. At lower speeds it's great, and it's a real head-turner.    tl;dr - if you like speed, you'll miss that fairing."
Triumph,34tldy,NotSnarky,3,Mon May 4 17:16:27 2015 UTC,Suggestion:  Get a fly screen for your scrammy.  It makes a huge difference on the motorway.  I didn't believe it until I got one.  I can ride 3 or 4 hours now at speed with no problem.
Triumph,34tldy,xmastreee,2,Tue May 5 04:09:52 2015 UTC,"I've been looking at those. Fancy the Dart, what do you have?"
Triumph,34tldy,NotSnarky,3,Tue May 5 15:10:25 2015 UTC,"I have the dart. For something so small and unobtrusive it does a great job. Stylish too. It blocks just enough air that you don't get pushed around so much. At 80 mph you don't have to hang on for dear life. A bigger screen buffets your head but the dart keeps the buffeting at about your neck level so that's not an issue. It's one of the best investments I've made on the bike, along with suspension upgrade."
Triumph,34tldy,xmastreee,2,Tue May 5 17:49:39 2015 UTC,"Cool. I came close to buying one of these on eBay, but it went for too much. it was white too, perfect match for my bike."
Triumph,34tldy,7point62x39,2,Tue May 5 19:42:39 2015 UTC,You might consider a street triple. I was between the Daytona and the ST3 when I bought mine. I went with the ST3 because it's a more comfortable bike. I use it as my daily driver and have about a 45 mile round trip commute. I just hit 12k miles on it and I still have nothing but love for this bike.
Triumph,34tldy,bobthemunk,2,Mon May 4 18:39:27 2015 UTC,"I rode all of the bikes mentioned back to back this past weekend at a demo day and I have to say the T100 Bonnie was my least favorite by a long shot. It has the styling for sure, but it felt very tippy and top heavy at low speeds. I feel like power isn't really much of a consideration with the classic styled bikes, but it did feel a bit down on power as well.  The Tiger 800 by comparison was so stable it was ridiculous. Loved that bike, so smooth. Even the 1200 Explorer handled better than the Bonnie.   All that being said, it just felt cool riding the T100. There was no sense of urgency, just good comfortable riding. If that's what you're looking for, go for it!"

To summarize the suggestions from it:  bags (top, tank, saddle, rear, roll, etc), a better saddle and/or airhawk, windscreen, toolbag, centerstand, highway pegs."
Triumph,34tigv,aDDnTN,1 point,Mon May 4 17:01:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I didn't want to go full gear because I'm not making a cross country trip, so the 40 bags and toolkit just seem like over kill.  The saddle and airhawk are what I was thinking."
Triumph,34tigv,aDDnTN,2,Mon May 4 17:04:09 2015 UTC,"windshield will make it easier to ride all day. imo, it is one of the most functional mods you can do to make longer rides less effort.  the centerstand makes it possible to fix your bike on the road.  imo, these two are the most important for long-distance riding.  if you just want to do 300 mile days, then an airhawk should help with pressure spots and saddlesores. if you just don't like your current saddle, then go ahead and spend money on a good comfortable saddle.  before you gut the silencers you should consider if you want to listen to the drone of the engine for hours and hours, while touring. quiet pipes will save your hearing and your sanity.  you might also like to get a helmet with bluetooth and some tunes on your phone to listen too. really helps the miles go by. a good full face helmet and quality leather gear can make it easier on the rider to be exposed for longer."

At bone stock, I could do maybe 40-50 miles before I started to feel it. After I made those changes, I did a 130mi ride last Saturday--no soreness or aches at all.   Highly recommend both upgrades. As others have mentioned, a windscreen would be useful if you're going to be on the highway at all. I find highway riding very fatiguing without one on the Bonnie."

This option definitely doesn't void the warranty.  If you don't like the arrow i know some dealers i have dealt with (not triumph) have a list of 3rd party (or non partner) exhausts that they are happy to fit that won't void the warranty.  Your triumph dealer may do the same.  You should consider the Arrow though, i love it.  Here is a video of a scrambler running with the arrow.

Triumph,34ndy1,sleekgreek,1 point,Sat May 2 20:46:11 2015 UTC,"Well I can say that you will make a little less noise with the Predators as compared to D&Ds.  That said, they are much louder than stock.  You WILL be noticed.  Never been to CA, so I don't know how big of dicks the cops are.  I did get my bike remapped.  My understanding is that the bike runs real rich otherwise - meaning lots of backfiring and carbon deposits on the exhaust.  But I've not had firsthand experience with it."
Triumph,34ndy1,space_monster,1 point,Sat May 2 21:32:57 2015 UTC,"preds are awesome. I have an 07 thrux, had to rejet and remove the airbox, so you electronic guys will need to remap. Running rich is incorrect, it will run lean and possibly burn your motor up without increasing your fuel flow. Mine are freaking loud and I love them. You should feel a big power difference with either the preds or the dd's. The dd's are going to be crazy loud though."

I put an improvised device into the AI tube to restrict the airflow, which stopped the backfiring and reduced the popping a lot. Blocking it up completely can create condensation issues so the best bet is just to restrict it, or remove the system altogether."

Triumph,34hcj7,DamnRandall,1 point,Fri May 1 03:52:48 2015 UTC,"By rearsets, do you mean aftermarket rearsets? If so, I'd bet this is the problem. Check connections and WD-40 the shit out of it. If you mean your OEM shifter, then it's likely a stuck transmission.  When the bike is turned off, grab your shifter with your right hand and yank the fuck out of it up and down. Turn the key on and see I'd you can get it into neutral. The bike doesn't need to be running to see progress with this. You won't hurt anything with just your arm. No nee d to hold the clutch.  If that didn't work, start the bike, make sure the kickstand is up (should be, since it won't start with it down and in gear), and put a constant pressure downward on the shifter as you're easing out the clutch and giving it some throttle. Coax that bitch into another gear. If down doesn't work, try up. Put as much pressure as you have to, but don't break the shifter.  Oh yeah. Check your oil.  Godspeed. Post updates."
Triumph,34hcj7,Zappafied,1 point,Fri May 1 04:32:35 2015 UTC,"Yes they're aftermarket rearsets. That was my first thought, that the shift linkage broke or got jammed up, but they're fine.     This is a video I shot after my bike and garage cooled down.   If that didn't work, start the bike, make sure the kickstand is up (should be, since it won't start with it down and in gear), and put a constant pressure downward on the shifter as you're easing out the clutch and giving it some throttle. Coax that bitch into another gear. If down doesn't work, try up. Put as much pressure as you have to, but don't break the shifter.     Tried all that; no joy. Actually tried to do some of that while I was still on the freeway before I hit traffic.    Oil is a little on the low side, but no surprise there as my bike does leak a little oil.

I believe this is what's happened to me. In my stupid ride-too-hard moment, I must have made the shift before properly pulling in the clutch."

Personally I always fit a rack for Givi Monokey luggage so that I can swap it between bikes. The ""wingrack"" can be bought with fittings for most bikes and works well, although it's a little clunky to look at."
Triumph,34ahoz,ctesibius,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:22:58 2015 UTC,"I'm in the US, and I will get roughly half of the OEM luggage bar assembly, and no bags. I was considering Givi, but if I can find the side grab bars that were originally on the bike, I would instead chase down OEM bags. My primary questions were whether or not you could even get something like the OEM mounts, or if the aftermarket equipment was designed assuming they were already mounted. I apologize for not being more clear."
Triumph,34ahoz,ctesibius,2,Wed Apr 29 17:49:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know this specific Triumph, but their usual design has a rail at the top that the pannier hangs on, but nothing lower where you would normally expect it. There's also a rod in front of the number plate which slides from side to side. The panniers can swing slightly, and the rod keeps them apart and out of the rear wheel. Does what you have look like this? I ask just in case you're not missing anything.  Otherwise, have a look at the parts diagrams on http://worldoftriumph.com to see what you need to order. That particular company is in the UK, and I don't know of a good alternative in the USA (though I think they ship to the USA). You will definitely be able to buy the parts as Triumph are very good for that.  Givi mounts don't usually assume that the Triumph mounts are there, as they have quite different mount points for the luggage."

Triumph,346ne1,SilentUnicorn,2,Mon May 4 07:19:38 2015 UTC,"Secondary air induction. It is the pipes that are in front of the spark plugs. On a side note this makes checking or changing the plugs a lot easier.   It pulls air from the airbox when you let off the throttle to help burn off extra junk in the exhaust. If you get that kinda booging down feel when you let off that it is. It also makes the exhaust a lot hotter which leads to more blueing(in my case the tops of the headers blackened).   Some just pull the hose out of the air box and bend it over and wire tie it(or put a marble in it to block it). I removed the entire thing(the kit below has a plug for the airbox). If you do pull it you can pull everything but the valve under the tank(so it will still open and close for the ecu but do nothing), remove it and put in the relay sold below in its place, or remove it and use tune ecu software to tell the bike to not care(for efi bikes).   If you search the triumphrat forums you will find a lot of info on this. Pretty easy to do although you do need to remove the tank to get to everything.   http://www.newbonneville.com/html/ai_removal_kit.html"

For example: Australian dealers will often throw in a free arrow exhaust with new STR's.  Also remember, this is old stock now. They don't want it on the floor because it's lower MSRP makes it harder to sell the 15' model. They need it out! make them an offer to take the pesky thing off their hands."

Triumph,343gmj,d3v1c3,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:06:55 2015 UTC,Not sure.  Are you referring to non folding pegs?

Triumph,343gmj,d3v1c3,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:13:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't think you can change em out unless you change the whole rearset.  What's wrong with folding?
Triumph,343gmj,Fast_Hands,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:23:21 2015 UTC,I would like the extra fall protection that non folding gives.

Triumph,343cv1,aero_enginerd,2,Tue Apr 28 03:22:02 2015 UTC,"2010 Daytona 675 SE here. The only damage that I have on the paint is from one crash, and you really have to look closely to find it, on the tank due to metal zippers being pressed hard against it and on the cowl+rear fairing due to scraping when dismounting.    But then again, I take good care of the bike to make sure that it stays white. The only downside is that if the bike is dirty, it's really noticeable. And chain lube fling will become your #1 enemy."
Triumph,343cv1,TKM_PT,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:53:53 2015 UTC,I've had my white Striple for 2 years. I haven't had any paint problems -- except for the one tiny scratch where the tank protector should be. I figured I'd wait until it was scratched to put the tank protector on. It's not like it's ever going to come off after that anyway. :)
Triumph,343cv1,audiosf,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:19:59 2015 UTC,"Modern day paint is pretty fragile, unfortunately, but Triumph isn't uniquely bad IMHO.  One way you could look into is 3M paint protection film. The Scotchgard Pro stuff is pretty amazing, basically invisible but hugely protective.

Triumph,343cv1,cr0ft,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:25:37 2015 UTC,"I have a white Bonneville, and I haven't had any problems with the paint. If you brush it with your arm, hand or leg accidentally, you can see black streaks of dirt, but it wipes right off with a cloth. You'd never know the bike was dirty unless you were rubbing the tank, though. Never considered it to be a problem.  But, I think your bike might be a matte white paint(?), which could have different results."

The machined fins place it 06 onwards so a 900. The satin engine cases and black paint certainly indicate it's a Bonnie Black T100.

Triumph,33k6ke,aDDnTN,1 point,Sat Apr 25 03:50:04 2015 UTC,"it doesn't have to be a special edition either, it could be a plain jane bonnie that has mods and farkle.  looks like it has a wave rotor up front, fork gaiters, LED/HID headlight (the color) and the twin cluster of gauges. those might be aftermarket turn signals, but i'm just not all that familiar with what the OEM ones look like. the pipes are the reverse cone style like from a thruxton, but those may have come on the bonnie?   spoke rims too, but that's pretty common in the early-mid years of production and less common now. anyone want to guess at the size of that rim?"
Triumph,33k6ke,SonofUlysses,2,Thu Apr 23 14:11:36 2015 UTC,"That's a 19 in rim no doubt, so standard fitment. I got out of the bike industry almost half a decade ago now so I'm pretty out of touch, I'll admit."
Triumph,33k6ke,SuicideKlutch,2,Thu Apr 23 18:42:30 2015 UTC,"Don't think it's a Bonnie Black since the engine cases aren't black. It's definitely a newer model one since the headlight brackets are the chrome kind, not the black kind like I had on my 2002. Judging from the looks of the pipe, the headlight bracket and the resulting position of the signal lights, I think this may even been a customized Thruxton. They usually have some sort of graphic on the tank and although the handle bar is covering it in the picture, you can kind of see something beneath it."
Triumph,33k6ke,aDDnTN,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:16:37 2015 UTC,Thank you :)
Triumph,33k6ke,SuicideKlutch,2,Thu Apr 23 18:43:46 2015 UTC,It has the head light set up ( brackets) and signal light location of a Thruxton and not a t-100. Also you can see the pipes sweeping upwards as on a Thruxton.  It has stock Thruxton instrument cluster as well.  I have had 4 Thruxtons. It's a Thruxton.  Happy hunting.
Triumph,33hxtu,OV5,2,Wed Apr 22 17:43:11 2015 UTC,"It's not an ideal method, but in a pinch I run the chinstrap through the strap that runs over top the pillion seat."
Triumph,33hxtu,aero_enginerd,2,Wed Apr 22 18:51:26 2015 UTC,"Bungie netted to the pillion. My Speedy has hooks under the seat that pop out, does the Daytona have anything like that?"
Triumph,33hxtu,cup-o-farts,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:29:35 2015 UTC,Nah the Daytona doesn't have the under seat hooks. That's what my old bike has and what I miss about it. I need a way to secure a helmet while I'm riding around.
Triumph,33hxtu,cup-o-farts,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:56:04 2015 UTC,"I don't even use those hooks for the bungie net, but I do use parts of the fender so if you got a fender eliminator I dunno. Maybe one of those flat bungies tied around the seat so it is stuck there when the seat is put back on."
Triumph,33hxtu,cup-o-farts,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:06:29 2015 UTC,May look into the net. Might try to find a small enough lock where connecting the D-rings to the pillion strap won't have the helmet hanging TOO far off the side of the bike. Can't hook it to the passenger pegs while riding because it would hang too low.
Triumph,33hxtu,HoldingThePoop,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:13:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah passenger pegs are way off there, but if you got the strap have you tried running the chin strap through that and tightening it?"
Triumph,33hxtu,wahoocrew12,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:26:13 2015 UTC,Yeah. It works...okayyyy. I'm thinking I might look into a strap setup that wraps through/around the helmet to beneath the seat. Kind of like how the pillion strap wraps around. Attach helmet to seat like that then of course the seat itself attaches to the bike normally. Will fiddle with it later.
Triumph,33hxtu,ihooklow,2,Thu Apr 23 20:54:39 2015 UTC,Passenger foot peg.

Triumph,33ek0v,Kurtezra,2,Tue Apr 21 21:53:27 2015 UTC,What rear shocks are those? Do they improve handling and will they fit a 2014 Thruxton? Are they even aftermarket?
Triumph,33ek0v,itsalright13,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:56:09 2015 UTC,Online. Bought them second hand. Work wonders for the tail of the bike. They do make then for Thurxton and Scrambler as well.

I encourage you to do both."
Triumph,33ek0v,THEtek4,2,Wed Apr 22 01:35:29 2015 UTC,Does your helmet whistle while you ride? I have the same in just flat black and it has a slight whistle

Only time it is silent is when I have my girl on the back. Then I notice the whistle. But it's not a dominating, only thing I hear noise."
Triumph,33ek0v,Yetibike,2,Wed Apr 22 05:15:29 2015 UTC,What headlight ears are they? I need something to replace the stock ones and they look good.
Triumph,33ek0v,jfrios,1 point,Wed Apr 22 10:12:50 2015 UTC,Cheapest ones I could find on Bellacorse.com. I don't think I spent more than $30 for them. I got them because I wanted to get rid of the hole from the ignition.
Triumph,33ek0v,SamAnona,2,Wed Apr 22 12:14:22 2015 UTC,Same reason I need some new ones and I've moved the indicators down as well.   I'll have a look at Bellacorse.

Triumph,33fy2x,Born_To_Roam,2,Wed Apr 22 05:02:48 2015 UTC,There is no better way to buy a bike when you are being that specific.  Why not settle for another color?  They made green thruxtons two years ago.  Bar swap.  Boom bonnie(ish).
Triumph,33fy2x,d3v1c3,2,Wed Apr 22 12:23:56 2015 UTC,"Dream Bike =/= First bike  imo, this should ALWAYS be true.  no, if you want that bike and you don't want to buy it at a dealership (assuming they have one), then you are already looking in the right places. If you are finding that people are always assuming you to be a scammer, perhaps you should reconsider your approach? Try to come across less like a desperate kid who doesn't know what they are doing and more like someone genuinely interested in a bike. Don't ask a bunch of stupid pointless details about a bike that is 1000 miles away. That probably isn't the bike for you.  Is there a better way to get a first bike? yes, buy something cheap that is in decent shape and easy to maintain. ride it until you are bored, then ride it for another 3-6 months (or until you've dropped it a few times), then consider if you want to risk even more money on a bike just because you are currently enamored with the look.  BTW, excellent taste in color. goodwood is pretty close to BRG, which is the fastest color for british vehicles, a fact that many people don't realize.  PS: you might try the ""for sale"" section of the forums at Triumphrat.net"
Triumph,33fy2x,aDDnTN,3,Wed Apr 22 17:55:40 2015 UTC,Dream Bike =/= First bike   I learned the hard way that buying a sweet first bike is the quickest way to owning a bike that used to be sweet before you got your stupid noob hands on it.  I dented and dinged the crap out of my '99 Thunderbird while still learning... both myself and my wallet have regrets.
Triumph,33fy2x,coocha,0,Wed Apr 22 20:33:30 2015 UTC,"TB's were tough old birds and hard to destroy, but finding replacement parts can get expensive real fast.  also, they are also not the best first bike, even if the price/smile (assumed) is delightfully low.   loads of torque, top heavy, and the stock controls were (imo) mismatched to the handling abilities of the bike. it's like Triumph assumed this ""cruiser"" should have awkward, rotund feeling steering. i don't run clipons or clubmans, but the first thing i did when my dad sent it to me to get some work done (way before he gave the Legend to me) was swap for bars with less rise and pull, and a bit different draw (angle your hands/wrists are at). but as it is, HC3s have a tendency to be not as forgiving of noob mistakes: stalling, turning, braking, heavy on the throttle, leaning, balance, control, etc."
Triumph,33fy2x,aDDnTN,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:40:06 2015 UTC,Disagree if the bike is cheap and tame enough. This guy's dream bike is super easy to ride and cheap. Buy some crash protection and ride the damn thing.. And inquire about the bike via phone.
Triumph,33fy2x,Nic01101011,0,Thu Apr 23 00:16:17 2015 UTC,"Crash protection is good, but 100 lbs lighter and a lower center of gravity is better."
Triumph,33fy2x,aDDnTN,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:26:29 2015 UTC,If his dream bike was a superduke or r6 I'd agree but the bonneville is perfect for somebody starting out. They are overweight pigs but not really too different in weight from a cheapo metric cruiser.
Triumph,33fy2x,Nic01101011,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:42:06 2015 UTC,why do you say they're overweight pigs?
Triumph,33fy2x,Nic01101011,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:32:30 2015 UTC,"They're 60-100 lbs heaver than the equivalent Guzzi, Duc, or real vintage Triumph/Norton/BSA/etc. They're very sedate bikes IMO and represent a complete 180 from what the original Bonneville was in its day."
Triumph,33fy2x,aDDnTN,0,Mon Apr 27 15:44:29 2015 UTC,"What's perfect is a matter of opinion. My opinion is the more conservative one, which implies it is more prudent for motorcycling. Are you wrong? No, it's just that a 250/beater bike is a more accessible starter bike than a more expensive one. Noobs want power because they fail to realize that practically any idiot can go fast in a straight line.  Is it a bad first bike? No.  Is it the best first bike? Again, no."
Triumph,33fy2x,THEtek4,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:49:50 2015 UTC,"the only other suggestion i have for you would to be contact a dealer. Talk with them and see if maybe they can find you your bike through some of their connections. Otherwise, find a different colored bonnie and paint it"

Triumph,33ddh5,Danino1987,3,Tue Apr 21 17:55:01 2015 UTC,"I've only put about 75 miles on them. Early opinions are positive. I think they look great. I am 5'8 and didn't want something too aggressive and also didn't want something that would ""require"" rear sets. The reach is perfect for me. Of course you are shifting some weight forward but I really don't think it is meaningful over stock.   Spiegler USA is the U.S. distributor for LSL. When I was on their site last week you couldn't order directly from them. Now you can. I ordered them through one of their authorized retailers in the Pittsburgh area called M&M Leather for $65. They are $73 on there plus shipping. You can get them in steel or aluminum. 1 inch or 7/8. I went with aluminum and they are super light. Also 7/8 since I have a mag wheel bonne.   Also they are called ""Speed-Bar Handlebars"" on speiglers website. I have no idea why. There website changed in the last two weeks, it used to have both names in the description."

The Enduro would be incredible better on trails than the Scrambler and the Super Adventure would be far better on the road.

Triumph,336ryx,BlueMagoo72,2,Mon Apr 20 02:09:08 2015 UTC,I love mine. Did over 1400km last week and was comfy all the way!
Triumph,336ryx,BlueMagoo72,2,Mon Apr 20 13:20:54 2015 UTC,Absolutely amazing motorcycle. Really bought it so that my wife and I would have more room to ride together. It's perfect. So in love with it.  Just as importantly so is my wife:-).
Triumph,336ryx,DrTaff,2,Mon Apr 20 13:35:43 2015 UTC,I need to get the pillion backrest as well. The engine has so much down low the kids nearly slide off the back !
Triumph,334v6r,existentialbum,2,Sun Apr 19 15:54:57 2015 UTC,"Got the same bike, that's a badass seat man!  Also, are you using a Heidenau K60 and TKC 80 combo on that?  Looking for new tires at the moment. How are they working for you?"
Triumph,334v6r,ExplodeBaer,2,Sun Apr 19 18:49:41 2015 UTC,"That's the right combo, in my opinion. I had some nice Pirelli street tires on it that came with the bike. Once those wore down, I went with the K60/TK80 combo and I'm having a lot more fun in dirt and gravel. There's a solid strip running along the center of the K60 that's pretty nice on the street, and the knobs on the sides of both tires make dirt riding fun."
Triumph,334v6r,ExplodeBaer,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:13:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely leaning that way, I would just have to ride a lot of highway to get anywhere worth using them off road. Ok on pavement?"
Triumph,334v6r,drwbry,2,Sun Apr 19 19:44:31 2015 UTC,"No complaints from me. There's definitely a compromise when you want to be able to ride both street and trail...more noise & vibration, a little less secure in the rain. Once you've put a hundred miles or so on them you'll be fine and know the limits."
Triumph,3357h7,eddiegrey,3,Sun Apr 19 17:43:43 2015 UTC,"My first service was approximately  $300.  Basically it's just an oil change and a once over of the bike to ensure everything is still torqued proper.  Can it be done by anyone, certainly.   The $95/hour shop rate for a tech adds up fast. That's what you are paying for, the knowledge and experience that someone who works on these bikes daily and knows what to look for. Since my 500 mile service I've done all my own work and service.     - 14 triumph scrambler"
Triumph,3357h7,parttime_paul,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:31:38 2015 UTC,reviewing the checklist...it looks like the only thing I couldn't do myself would be the autoscan with the diagnostic tool.  Any ideas where to pick one of those up on the cheap?
Triumph,3357h7,ccosby,2,Sun Apr 19 20:32:21 2015 UTC,It uses ODB2 with can bus. Pretty much any car scanner that can read can bus(reads cars made after 2005ish) can read the bike. You can get a 20 to 30 dollar usb cable and use tune ecu(free software) to read codes and reprogram the ecu's tunes as well. Really unless something is acting up though you don't need to scan the bike.   I personally did the first service myself on my 2014. It is a general checkover(and oil change). I did more than the dealer would have.
Triumph,3357h7,Sociopathic_Pro_Tips,2,Mon Apr 20 01:46:13 2015 UTC,"At a minimum, get the oil and oil filter changed. That is cheap and very easy to do with step by step instructions in your owner's manual.   Most of the other tasks outlined in your service and maintenance schedule will be checks and tightening of nuts and bolts and those are also shown in the book. As long as they have a basic understanding of righty-tighty, lefty-loosey laws and have average reading comprehension skills, anyone can do their first service work. Oh, yeah, you'll need some tools too.   However, be sure to save all of your receipts and document all the work you do or have done. In case of warranty work, you want to be able to show compliance with all scheduled maintenance and services if they ask."
Triumph,3357h7,Jesseeichas,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:28:35 2015 UTC,I'm a mechanic and I brought my 13 speed triple in for the first service for piece of mind. Other than that I do all my work myself.

Triumph,3353hc,professorsyr,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:09:12 2015 UTC,Sounds like a leaky seal allowed moisture to enter the system while in storage. Maybe caused some corrosion inside the calipers causing the pistons to stick..
Triumph,3353hc,Nic01101011,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:19:03 2015 UTC,I had a similar problem.  I had changed my brake lever and misadjusted the plunger.  After a but of heavy riding the thing locked up on me.  I'm assuming the heat caused the fluid to expand too much and push the piston back on my poorly adjusted plunger. After removing the lever it would operate fine.  I readjusted and it's been fine ever since.  Although this isn't necessarily the same case as yours it might be worth looking into.

Get crank case sliders, factory frame sliders, and call it good. Tank protectors if you want, but they're damn ugly.   However, buy whatever you want. If you want more, its not gonna hurt anything"
Triumph,3338nz,keboh,2,Sun Apr 19 02:34:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think bar end sliders are worth it. If it goes down hard enough for them to be useful, you probably need a new bar anyways. They're an aesthetic thing more than a protection thing"
Triumph,3338nz,keboh,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:36:02 2015 UTC,"How do you mean? I figure that bar ends are always going to be the first thing to take damage, regardless of how hard a drop is?"
Triumph,3338nz,keboh,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:47:51 2015 UTC,"Well, the bike comes stock with screw on ends at the end of the bar. So those would prevent scratches under a light drop. Hard drops, your handle bar will probably get bent anyways, and bar end sliders aren't going to prevent that. Theres no reason to buy them unless you like them, aesthetically."
Triumph,3338nz,keboh,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:51:16 2015 UTC,Ah I see. Didn't realise they already had screw on ends
Triumph,3338nz,keboh,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:55:36 2015 UTC,"Yep!   Also, side note, aftermarket bar ends don't work on the stock bars. The actual handlebar stops like 2-3"" before the end of the grip. There is like, an insert thingy instead. Its hard to explain, but if you want bar end mirrors (the stock ones are useless and ugly) you might look into an aftermarket bar, unless you want the bar ends from the Triumph catalog.

Figure out what bugs you the most (handlebars, suspension, exhaust, etc.) and change that stuff first! Plus you'll feel a LOT better about your performance mods after riding with it stock for a little while.

Triumph,32szvq,Yetibike,2,Thu Apr 16 21:42:49 2015 UTC,What a beautiful piece of machinery. Enjoy!
Triumph,32szvq,Jesseeichas,2,Thu Apr 16 22:56:24 2015 UTC,That is absolutely the ugliest exhaust. Nice looking bike otherwise though.
Triumph,32szvq,bbbeeennnjjjeee,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:58:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it's apparently the legitimate Triumph's race exhaust that the previous owner put on, but I think it might be the first change I make soon..."
Triumph,32szvq,quattromila,2,Wed Apr 22 00:47:32 2015 UTC,Oh yeah! That's a great looking bike. Love the yellow. Any plans to make modifications?
Triumph,32szvq,quattromila,2,Sun Apr 19 02:32:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks! No mod plans yet, but perhaps an exhaust that can't be used for jousting might be in order. Apparently the current one is the Triumph's race exhaust that the previous owner put on (confirmed by the tech at the Triumph dealership according to the part serial number)."
Triumph,32v194,kgonzalm,2,Thu Apr 16 23:07:16 2015 UTC,"I'm in northern Utah so I can't help much on the scenery (haven't been that far south yet) but I usually try to plan based on two contingencies: weather, and mechanical failures. 1000 miles isn't too much but depending on how long you're stretching it over you'll want to pack rain gear if it looks like you might hit a shower, warm gear if you'll hit canyons (altitude can drop temps 20+ degrees), etc. For mechanical issues, think about a tire repair kit, chain lube, basic tools for tightening/adjusting stuff, and zip ties and bungee cords.  Don't try to do it all in one or two days if you can avoid it. If you can't, make sure you hydrate whenever you stop for fuel and at least stretch and take a small 10-15 minute break. Exhaustion slows your reaction time, and we need quick reaction times to avoid accidents. I usually do a 200-300 miles trip when the weather starts to warm but I stretch it over 8-10 hours, stopping multiple times, and even with being an active snowboarder during the winter months I end up exhausted and sore the next day."
Triumph,32v194,solertai,2,Fri Apr 17 02:19:33 2015 UTC,"1000 miles isn't really that far. Make sure your bike had it's maintenance, bring chain lube and don't ride further than you are comfortable with in 1 day."
Triumph,32v194,Bazzie,2,Fri Apr 17 08:20:34 2015 UTC,Make sure your tires can handle the round trip or that you are swapping along the way.
Triumph,32v194,mduck,2,Fri Apr 17 19:25:00 2015 UTC,Spoke or Mag wheel? If mag wheel a patch kit will be helpful. Past that some chain lube. Give the bike a good once over before you are ready to leave. Also check the clutch cable or carry a spare.
Triumph,32v194,ccosby,2,Mon Apr 20 01:52:24 2015 UTC,get a center stand installed if you don't already have one. makes maintenance much easier and roadside repair much more possible.
Triumph,32v194,aDDnTN,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:13:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the great advice.  I'll factor all this in before the trip.

I'm thinking Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam, Reno, San Francisco, down to Los Angeles, and then back to Texas on I-10 East.    Thanks again!"
Triumph,32uesv,ChazzAtWork,2,Thu Apr 16 20:11:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah test rides are completely up to the seller. They might be willing to if you give them all the money up front, that's the only way I would do it."

Triumph,32myh2,aioros84,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:01:21 2015 UTC,There really isn't much difference mechanically. They are the same bike with a little different riding position. It just depends on what look you like.
Triumph,32myh2,ccosby,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:45:06 2015 UTC,"On the current ones the front tire size and front fender for starters. Stock bonne has a 17 mag, thruxton has an 18 spoke, the t100 bonne has a 19 spoke. The front fender on the t100 is bigger too(the rear is bigger than the one the thruxton and base have as well).   Past that it is a different stock seat, handlebars, and the rear set is different.   Other small things is if I'm not mistaken the thruxton has white dials where the bonneville has black(the t100 and thruxton have tachs)."

Triumph,32myh2,exemon,2,Wed Apr 15 03:59:19 2015 UTC,It's the gel seat and cowl off a Thruxton. I was lucky enough to come across somebody parting out a wrecked one.
Triumph,32myh2,chrisg67,2,Wed Apr 15 11:46:12 2015 UTC,That front fender looks too big compared to the rest of the bike. Good looking bike though.
Triumph,32myh2,aDDnTN,2,Wed Apr 15 09:18:27 2015 UTC,"Good looking tri! Do you like the flyscreen over the cowl? I'm thinking of getting one for my Bonne mag for highway riding to give me a small break from the wind, but heard it can cause the headlight to move a bit."
Triumph,32myh2,aDDnTN,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:12:26 2015 UTC,"It really made a big difference for highway riding. I feel like it cuts the wind perfectly. That being said, yes there is a little big of messing with your headlight position to get it right. Once you tighten it down though, it doesn't really move."
Triumph,32myh2,SamAnona,2,Wed Apr 15 11:49:27 2015 UTC,"so what's the deal with the headlight cover? do you use it when riding during the day or is it purely for when the bike is parked?  BTW, nice looking bike. you seem to have really made it yours. keep the shiny side up!"
Triumph,32myh2,GodRibs,2,Wed Apr 15 14:20:24 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, it is a vintage style racing accessory. Back in the day if you were a weekend racer, you would put one of these on your bike while racing on the track. So then if you wrecked, and your headlight broke, it would trap all the glass so it would not cut you up during a fall.  My local shop had it on clearance and I liked the look. I never rode with it on, as it is illegal where I live. But I don't race, so I never used it. Just thought it looked cool for a while."

Triumph,32kr8g,horrible_at_names,3,Tue Apr 14 16:07:59 2015 UTC,"500 miles? i think that's the first oil change.  so this is just a result of the oil the service dept used which is different than the oil that was put in the bike for breaking it in.  that break-in oil might have had a higher viscosity, which being thicker would have dampened down the ticks, clicks, snicks, whirs, whistles, and whines.  now, you've got some slick semi-synth (or full synth) flowing around easier and you're back to sharp edges and less resistance on everything moving around, so the noises are a bit louder and more noticible.  this is very common and will likely continue to happen after every oil change. you will notice that the bike is running differently, even if it is barely perceptible and something only a soulmate would notice."

It sits a little far forward with weight on the bars, but that will depend on your body and how you fit it.  That said, the Thruxton feels more zippy, and easy to hop on and go.  It feels a bit faster too, though it isn't actually.  They're both pretty much the same in that regard.  Hope that helps!"

I'd take off the seat and try to that on eBay, but the rest is probably leave on.    $6K would be on the high end for your bike here.

Wait until full on bike frenzy is in swing (if it isn't yet in your area) and take great photos... or get a friend with a nice camera and a decent eye to take nice photos.

Triumph,32g269,KirbyinAustin,2,Mon Apr 13 14:39:55 2015 UTC,Get the one you think looks better. It's slow and heavy either way.
Triumph,32g269,Nic01101011,2,Mon Apr 13 20:23:08 2015 UTC,"imo, the difference in handling will be minimal, but the tire selection will be different.  you will be able to get some overlap, but the skinny 18"" rim is associated with classic/vintage style tires while the 17"" can mount a lot of modern-style sport oriented tires.  sometimes the 18"" is harder to find in the tire you want. that's usually not true for the 17"".  17"" rim will have less rotational inertia because it will be smaller diameter, have less weight further out. that means the 18""s will accelerate/de-accelerate a bit slower, but will roll more smoothly (better for interstates/long constant speed). furthermore, the 18"" rim tires have a slightly flatter profile, to give them a ""low profile look"" so they won't corner the same (tip in) and don't have as much cushion/compliance to soak up rougher pavement.  other than that, it's all aesthetics. do you want the ""big wheel chopper"" look? or would you rather have a proportional classic look?  personally, if the bike was priced really well, i wouldn't let it influence my decision to buy. you can always swap to a 17"" rim later. imo, the quality/age/lifespan of the current tires would affect the sale price more than the rim."
Triumph,32g269,aDDnTN,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:01:14 2015 UTC,"The 17"" can be trick to find tyres for as well as the rims are narrower than most modern bikes. Although you can go up a little on the widths to get suitable tyres."

Triumph,32g269,aDDnTN,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:52:05 2015 UTC,110/70R17 at the front and 130/80R17 at the back.
Triumph,32g269,Yetibike,2,Wed Apr 15 21:59:26 2015 UTC,That's exactly the thought process I went through last year. I ended up with the SE not the T-100. I couldn't be happier! Take the money you save by not getting the T-100 and add some stuff to upgrade/customize the bike.
Triumph,32g269,BaconEveryMeal,2,Mon Apr 13 15:14:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply!  Is the SE the base Bonnie or is this another version of it in the same way the T-100 is?
Triumph,32g269,BaconEveryMeal,2,Mon Apr 13 15:23:48 2015 UTC,"I tried it and the difference in handling is there and it fairs better to the SE, but probably negligible for the normal street riding.   I think you will not really feel a great difference unless you do a more sportier riding or going really slow (which in that case both the SE and T100 will not feel that light).  The Bonnie SE front wheel is a 17 inch mag, and the T100 a 19 inch wire spoke and tubes; also the handlebars are different (T100 is I think a 1"" that is a little taller than the SE, which is a 7/8""), and the SE is at 29.1"" where the T100 is 30"".  As u/BaconEveryMeal posted, you can always customize it; I just changed my SE's bar to Norman Hyde M Bars, which is lower and makes you lean a little bit, it changed the weight from the back to the front, which immediately improved the handling (it wasn't bad to begin with, but now its just excellent).  BTW, Yes, the SE is the cheapest one, the others like the T100, Thruxton and Scrambler are probably a few hundred to around $1K more new."
Triumph,32g269,stupid_likeafox,2,Mon Apr 13 19:46:35 2015 UTC,"That's the base model. Cheapest one you can buy (in black, the two tone ones --which look awesome-- are a little more). A lot of this is anecdotal so take it with a grain of salt: T-100 has tube tires instead of standard...that just sounded like a hassle to me. Apparently the T-100 might be more comfortable if you are a highway sort of rider (I am not) but the smaller tire and different rake in the suspension make the base model a little more nimble in the twisties."
Triumph,32g269,Yetibike,3,Mon Apr 13 15:30:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Those rims are a pain.  Because of the spokes, a tube is required and if you get a flat you can't use a plug to fix it on the side of the road, you need to take off the rear wheel, etc."

If you don't want to remove it, you can just plug up the hose for the same affect, to see if it's something you want to do. Then the suspension (shocks and fork springs). Then a new exhaust. Then remove the airbox baffle, 02 sensor, get a Breathe Bellmouth, and remap using a TTP tune."

Triumph,32ct3r,CongratsOnYourBike,2,Mon Apr 13 12:25:22 2015 UTC,"On the Street Triple, there are some really sturdy hooks next to the passenger pegs, but nothing farther back than them. The rear fender is not particularly rigid, so you won't be able to tie bungees to it.  The Street Triple is pretty bad for tying stuff down to the rear seat. Because the hooks next to the pillion pegs are in front of the seat, anything you tie down to them moves forward.  You can see the hook next to the pillion peg here."
Triumph,32ct3r,scottydwrx,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:08:50 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot. I want to be able to use this tail bag: http://www.revzilla.com/product/chase-harper-hide-away-tail-bag  Which as you can see has bungees for attachment. Do you think it would work?
Triumph,32ct3r,Ron_1n,1 point,Mon Apr 13 09:09:04 2015 UTC,"Not on its own, no. The closest hooks to the front are by the pillion pegs, which looks too far for those short bungees, and there's no secure place behind it. So, if you stretch those bungees to hook onto the pegs, it'll pull the bag forward, and you'll be riding with the thing in your spine the whole time.  Now, you can hook the bungees together underneath the seat. There's a reasonable amount of space under the seat for it, but the connecting posts aren't in a great place for it, and it'll still pull forward.  Honestly your best bet on the Street Triple is a backpack or a tank bag."

Triumph,326yer,LarryChimpMan,1 point,Sat Apr 11 07:56:56 2015 UTC,"I have a Bonnie, but it's basically the same in the mods department. I have never heard predators before, but I absolutely LOVE my arrow 2-2 exhaust system. With the baffles they sound good, but without them, Damn!   Other than that, I love LSL parts. I put their clip-ons, frame sliders, barend mirrors, and headlamp arms on with rearsets going on later this month. The only thing is it's a german company and if the local dealer doesn't have the part in stock you have to wait. Usually it's not more than 2 weeks.   I have Ikon rear suspension and their progressive fork spring up front. Definitely a good investment there. If I were to do it again, I might have bought Ohlin's rear set up for the flash factor, but I'm happy with the Ikons.   I'm also going to be installing the airbox removal kit, mostly for the look. The EFI models don't much power from it alone. Also the air injectors and O2 removal. Here is a Dyno of what someone gained with these mods.   Here are a few pics for an idea. The LSL frame sliders, rearsets, and mirrors aren't in the photos. The mirrors are PSR, don't waste money on them. They fell apart quick. Hope it gives you an idea on where you can begin.

I'm guessing it's a Sprint ST.  It's not as nimble as the RS, but they only imported the RS for a handful of years.  It's a fun bike & one that you'll not regret buying.

Triumph,32865g,TriumphRid3r,2,Sun Apr 12 01:45:22 2015 UTC,"The ABS model blue booked at something like $5,645 in excellent condition with something like 24,000 miles.  So again, with 8,000 miles unless something major is wrong with it, I think it's at least a decent deal.  As for bad reviews, you won't find them.

Triumph,322af5,Joey92LX,5,Fri Apr 10 00:20:49 2015 UTC,"I have a 2004 Daytona 600 (the '05 is the only 650) in Tornado Red. Triumph wasn't nearly as big of a brand in the US back then and as so, very few Daytona Gen 1 super sports ever made it to the US. I'll do some googling, but I recall a post on the old Daytona TankSlap forum that stated less than ~2,000 total in '04 and fewer still in '05 were shipped to the US. Being a 10/11 year old bike now, I'm sure there aren't that many still on the road.  While I love my Daytona to death, it is not the greatest bike to own. There is no, and I really do mean no, aftermarket support for this bike in the US. All parts are either OEM from a dealer or authorized distributer (Bike Bandit and British Customs are the only I've found) or a compatible part from a completely different bike (usually Yamaha’s and Suzuki’s). So most parts tend to be very expensive and include long waits as they come from the UK as no dealer/distributor stocks them anymore. One of the three Triumph dealers I've dealt with didn't even know the bike existed before '06 (the first 675 Triple) and the other two said that they never thought that they would see one. Maybe it is due to the general area I live (Eastern Washington) but I've come across three others in the 11 years I've had it traveling all across the West Coast. Two where in Western Washington and one in Southern Cali.  As for known issues, they are prone to stator issues and dead chambers due to water seepage. I have a Yamaha stator in mine now and have had zero issue and have never had the water seepage issues myself, though it seemed to be common post on the TankSlap forums.  Also, to get a feel for the size of the bike, I would recommend sitting on larger sport touring and/or older (early 2000s) 1000cc sports as the Gen 1 Daytona’s are built like old liter bikes. Not a bad thing, but definitely do not expect a smaller, tighter bike like a modern 600 class sport bike. Personally, I find it extremely comfortable, but I also do more touring than track days on it these days.  As for finding one. I wish I could help you there, but I can't. They are a rare bike that has only become rarer due to age. If there are any more questions I can help you with, let me know. Good luck with the search!"
Triumph,322af5,shagginshaggy,2,Fri Apr 10 07:45:27 2015 UTC,"they are prone to stator issues   Said every Triumph owner, ever. ^_^  They hadn't fixed the stator issues even by my '11 D675!"
Triumph,322af5,Stitchikins,1 point,Fri Apr 10 09:37:05 2015 UTC,i think you mean Daytona owner... my stator is perfectly fine. knock wood
Triumph,322af5,aDDnTN,2,Fri Apr 10 18:06:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response. This makes total sense. This would be my second bike and I am kind of looking for the touring ergonomics without the weight or big engine. I'm a little more about comfort over speed right now though. Thank you for sharing a few of the bike's shortcomings as well. I knew parts were a little hard to find but this does change my opinion a bit. It does not change my opinion, however, that Triumphs are beautiful bikes and I still might want to own one. I have read several responses from others recommending the TT600, which I will also look into. Thanks again."
Triumph,31xywh,tnt8897,2,Thu Apr 9 00:58:13 2015 UTC,Got mine last week! Such an amazing bike.

Triumph,31xywh,Cripple1989,2,Thu Apr 9 01:28:58 2015 UTC,Worth the extra cost? I want the street triple R with the quick shifter and a few other goodies that come on the RX.
Triumph,31xywh,minus0,1 point,Thu Apr 9 05:25:45 2015 UTC,"I got it today, so i have not had much time with it. But the quick shifter is awesome. The seat is not quite a comfortable as the r, but i think it looks a hell of a lot better."
Triumph,31xywh,minus0,2,Thu Apr 9 05:55:39 2015 UTC,Can you tell us about it? I have a '13 Street Triple R and I came upon a '14 Daytona 675R I have free daily access to. I don't want to read a magazine review since they are always glowing about triumph (they are amazing bikes). What is the ride position like? Red line? How does it compare to the STR vs The Daytona. Both have their strengths and weaknesses (realizing I need to stop riding the Daytona so I won't get a ticket). Any impressions would be appreciated.  That all being said (or asked) awesome bike.
Triumph,31xywh,Milo33,2,Thu Apr 9 05:52:05 2015 UTC,"My old bike was the regular street triple, and not the R, and i have never ridden the Daytona. The riding position is the same as on the regular street triple. It has the seat of the Daytona which i don't find quite a comfy as the regular, but it is comfy enough. I picked up the bike today with 8.3 miles on it so I am still breaking it in, i have not really pushed the engine yet.  My impressions after one day is that it is worth the extra money for me."
Triumph,31xywh,cup-o-farts,1 point,Thu Apr 9 06:00:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks. More info would be great. I would love to have Daytona performance in the street Triple's package. Love the performance of the Daytona, but want the every day comfort of the street. Keep posting!"
Triumph,31xywh,minus0,1 point,Thu Apr 9 06:30:37 2015 UTC,"The engine is the same as the regular Street Triple, so performance won't be much different. Off the top of my head, the differences are: Fly screen, belly pan, seat cowl included, quickshifter included (and oh so much fun), tail section from the Daytona, and the special color scheme, wheels, and decals.   One thing I like about the seat is its a bit more narrow in the spot you sit on. Maybe not quite as comfy though."
Triumph,31xywh,minus0,2,Thu Apr 9 16:28:28 2015 UTC,"It's a different tuning, so yeah it will be slightly different. More top end and speed on the Daytona, more bottom end and torque on the Street Triple."
Triumph,31xywh,solertai,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:47:30 2015 UTC,"I have all those addons minus the seat cowl. LOVE the quick shifter. Check out the OEM bat end mirrors, the are great. I have a '13 Street Triple R that I have put 20k miles on.  What I was hoping was the bike would basically be all Daytona 675R but with the Street Triples ergonomics. Oh well, I can dream."

Triumph,31t64c,mattfki5g,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:54:43 2015 UTC,A t100? If not maybe the tach kit.   Past that I'd say put it towards the arrow exhaust.
Triumph,31t64c,ccosby,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:23:25 2015 UTC,Is the tach kit easy to install?
Triumph,31t64c,ccosby,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:03:41 2015 UTC,Looks like it should be pretty easy.   http://triumphinstructions.com/ProdDocs/A9828007-EN.pdf  I bought a T100 myself so it came with a tach. With a tach though you can see how hard you are pushing the bike. In many cases you will find you are shifting early without one.
Triumph,31t64c,ccosby,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:22:07 2015 UTC,Funny you mention that because I always feel like I'm shifting early.
Triumph,31t64c,DrTaff,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:38:53 2015 UTC,"With any manual(car, truck, bike) I think a tach is helpful. With the 2011 and newer bikes it looks pretty simple to install.   Really I think it would be one of the best dealer upgrades(other than the arrow exhaust which rocks). A lot of the other stuff I'd recommend for the bike is aftermarket(smaller turn signals, more retro brake light, performance upgrades, seat upgrades, suspension, etc). Even simple things like relocating the ignition so it doesn't scrape against the headlight bracket(the joker one is what I have and it looks good). Same goes for relocating the inspection sticker to a bracket if your state issues them."
Triumph,31t64c,FurnitureGuyYo,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:03:35 2015 UTC,If you know how to wield a spanner then it's really easy to install. I fitted one to my Bonnie and I spent more time switching the bulbs for the idiot lights for brighter LED ones than I did installing the tach kit.   I have a 2009 bike with the older non-digital speedo and tach but the fitting instructions are pretty much the same although there's actually one less step as you won't have to worry about the idiot lights as they're built into the tach on the newer bikes.
Triumph,31t64c,TucoTastic,1 point,Wed Apr 8 07:52:46 2015 UTC,"T100 has a tach. I'm in the same situation. Leaning toward the gel seat with the rolls, as mine is the school bus style."

Triumph,31l2k7,3rdFloorChair29,2,Wed Apr 8 00:06:31 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I don't have a spigot available at my apt building so I used the two bucket method and used 5 gallon buckets of water for the initial soak and rinse.  While its wet I gave it a good cleaning with auto soap and a good quality, clean mitt.    Then some Griots Garage wheel cleaner and a bursh for the wheels to remove the grime.    Then I used the Maguiars clay bar and detailer to get the contaminants off of the paint.  I also used the detailer to clean the engine and around it as well.    After claying I used Maguiars Gold Class wax on all of the painted bits and plastics to make the dirt come off more easily next time and protect the surface.     Then I rode it and got it dirty again :)"

Triumph,31l2k7,Fast_Hands,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:01:24 2015 UTC,"If you use a pressure washer or the hose nozzle set to a concentrated setting I could see how water could get into connectors or electronics under the seat.  Its not really a scenario the electronics were designed for.  That said, if you set the hose nozzle to a mist or fan setting, and don't keep it focused on any given area or crevice for an extended period of time, you should be fine.  I can't imagine a scenario where you would get your Striple muddy enough that you'd have to blast it with a hose.  Mine was covered in the leftover road grime from winter, so the buckets worked just fine.  If you want to pick up some of the stuff I mentioned on the cheap, advance auto parts has some of it, and they typically have 30% off coupons online, so if you place the order in advance for store pickup you can get it cheaper than amazon."

Triumph,31ixwh,Dr-Kadaver,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:21:59 2015 UTC,How do you like it? I ride a 2002 Vulcan 800 and can't decide whether to upgrade to a Speed Triple or keep the power low with a Thruxton. I'm leaning towards the Thruxton right now because it's cheaper and my parents won't be as worried.
Triumph,31ixwh,Kurtezra,2,Mon Apr 6 04:15:39 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love it.  Feels great and built with quality.  It turns heads wherever I go.  Between the Speed Triple and the Thruxton, the two major differences are style and horsepower.  The Thruxton should have a little more zip than your Vulcan but it has about the same or less get up and go that my Suzuki SV650 had.  It weighs a lot at 500lbs wet.  Riders looking for lots of horsepower won't be satisfied with a Thruxton.  I would love to own a Speed Triple, but for me, getting the Thruxton was all about how good I felt when I sat on it."
Triumph,31ixwh,Kurtezra,1 point,Mon Apr 6 13:27:21 2015 UTC,I definitely need a test ride of both but I'm sure that I would be more than happy with a Thruxton.  Just something about the thought of a Speed Triple gives me goosebumps.

Triumph,31l098,aDDnTN,2,Mon Apr 6 03:19:53 2015 UTC,"probably not loose, but there is a short in that circuit somewhere, causing it to trigger, which kills the bike while it's running.  of course, if it clears up immediately, it might only stall, but chances are if it's already doing that, you might not notice (would just stutter a bit on idle, kinda cutout but immediately start back).  i would have the dealer service this since it's a new bike under warranty."

Triumph,31l098,G-wow,2,Mon Apr 6 12:17:33 2015 UTC,"it could be as simple as a loose wire, it could be that the sensor is faulty and will have to be replaced.  it's probably not anything more than that, but you never know. best to have the dealer take it in.  don't let them send you off with a ""that's normal"" or ""we can't fix the issue if we can't verify it"" either. stick to your guns (not literally)."
Triumph,31l098,aDDnTN,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:21:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'm a bit nervous as they know I'm a newbie, but im also not a dummy. If they do pull that crap, do I call triumph nationally?

Triumph,31l098,aDDnTN,2,Mon Apr 6 13:12:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my dealer is sketchy too so I need contact triumph na about it. Don't let these dealers do whatever they want."
Triumph,31l098,G-wow,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:02:07 2015 UTC,"yeah. if it becomes an issue call triumph nationally and make a big fuss about how this dealer is trying to rip off someone new to riding. play the new rider card as often as possible for as long as possible.  then you can say something like ""i knew i should have bought a kawasaki from that kawasaki dealer. he has such a good reputation about helping new riders get familiar and never tries to rip them off."" you can feel free to substitute any of your local shops with ""kawasaki"" in my example.  i don't know what is and isn't covered by your warranty. i'm sorry. read your MOM and your contract agreement paperwork.  you bought a new bike, so you have some reasonable expectation of delivery of a bike that is relatively trouble free (fyi, the lemon law covers all vehicles), but you also bought something that will need maintenance, so imo, when you bought it you should be prepared to spend money maintaining it.  not that a faulty sensor on a new bike falls under ""expected maintenance"", but that's my mini-rant on people buying bikes they can't (or worse won't) maintain properly."

Unfortunately I'm a bit rocked because of the bad experice I've had with this dealer, I've already had to call national guys because of their nonsense before.   Will update you tomorrow!"

Just now they told me after several test rides they have not been able to replicate the issue. I asked if they looked at the kickstand switch. Nope!  I'm pretty furious. I have an order which I thankfully have not paid for yet with them, worth about $600. I just told them I won't be paying until it's fixed. I'll keep you all updated, thanks.  Also, should I ask them to reimburse me for fuel? Is that considered acceptable?"

Triumph,31gsbq,Yetibike,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:23:33 2015 UTC,Thanks! Interesting that you mention that. I was looking at a craigslist posting that had some nasty looking pipes. What causes this? Here is the link: http://eastky.craigslist.org/mcy/4951684212.html
Triumph,31gsbq,ccosby,6,Sun Apr 5 01:23:14 2015 UTC,"It is the secondary air induction that causes it. When you let off the throttle it pulls air from the airbox to help burn off shit in the exhaust.   You said you don't want to modify the bike but I'd remove it or disable it. Multiple vendors make kits. You can leave the valve in place under the tank if you want, plug in a dummy kit to make it think it is there, or use tuneecu and tell the bike not to look for it. Plus it isn't hard to do and makes getting to the spark plugs easier down the road.  http://www.newbonneville.com/html/ai_removal_kit.html  On a plus side removing it really changes the feel of the bike when you let off the throttle for the better.   The bikes are overall pretty good although you do have some week points. The stock suspension and seat are not good. You have a bunch of options if you decide to swap either. Brakes are not the best either but you can wait until you wear them out. I'd go with the EBC stuff(including going to the floating front rotor) when it comes to it.   The stock fuel mapping isn't the best either but that is to pass emissions. Many of us pull the o2 sensors(which only work at low rpm's anyway), gut the airbox and replace the restricted intake(or remove the airbox altogether), and retune the bike. TTP has some nice tunes. None of this is needed though. Personally I'd recommend it down the road.   The bikes overall though are very good and many have a ton of miles on them. You have a lot of potential if you decide down the road to make changes. I have a 2014 black and have done a bunch personally.  http://imageshack.com/a/img674/1043/xwIJYZ.jpg  O yea if your state has inspection stickers get a plate for it and have them put it on that vs on the black metal of the front fork.   http://www.rakuten.com/prod/black-universal-custom-motorcycle-inspection-tag-sticker-plate-license/235006378.html?listingId=300317478&sclid=pla_google_KapscoMoto&adid=29963&gclid=Cj0KEQjwl_6oBRDHxNGz6ueJufMBEiQAvm_k_v3lbrMIvcV_0ft17-r8QzgfCt9OtJ0ZBYdF55d4A1IaAtfD8P8HAQ  I bought something like that. Looks so much better."
Triumph,31gsbq,ccosby,2,Sun Apr 5 02:28:48 2015 UTC,"It's not really the SAI that causes it, it's just the exhausts getting hot that does it. The SAI exacerbates it by burning excess fuel in the exhaust which obviously makes it even hotter but even without the SAI you will get some blueing.   Even though you don't want to mod it I'd rip out the SAI straightaway. Then after your first long ride you'll probably want some new rear shocks!"

Triumph,31ekjt,RaptorzWOT,5,Sat Apr 4 08:54:27 2015 UTC,"My father had a Trident 900, around 7-8 years ago, and I fell in love with it. I asked him to keep it for me when he wanted to sell it, I was only around 16 at the time so couldn't ride it yet, but loved it to pieces. He ended up selling it, but he has exclusively had Triumphs since. He went from his Trident to a Tiger, then a Thunderbird 1600, and now he has one of the new 1200 Explorers.  Knowing I'd always wanted a Triumph, and Trident in particular, the perfect opportunity arose. This bike has been owned by a family friend for 20 years, it's a 93 model and he purchased it in 94. He was loathed to sell, but knowing it was my dream bike and his collection was ever growing, he needed to clear the garage a bit and parted with it about a week ago.  Cosmetically it needs work, there is a hole in one exhaust, the tank was accidentally dropped in the garage and is covered in chips and there are a few other odds and sods. But mechanically it is spot on. He wouldn't let me have it til he'd cleaned it completely, serviced it and put it through a fresh MOT. It failed the MOT on a cracked swingarm, but that was replaced with new two days later, along with the sprag clutch as they're a common problem, and then re tested.   The old girl has 68k on the clock, but runs like a dream and pulls like a train! I would like to keep her as original as possible, so my only plans are to replace the exhausts, and get her re sprayed. I'll keep the original colours, but maybe go for a dark red pearl in the black so it looks lovely caught in the right light."

Triumph,31bti0,cr0ft,2,Fri Apr 17 13:49:01 2015 UTC,"Your best bet isn't HID, it's hitting up http://www.jwspeaker.com and buying an actual made-from-scratch LED solution that puts all the lumens where you want them.   I believe the Bonnie has a 7-inch round, so that makes the 8700 Evo 2 in chrome or black a killer choice, 2600 raw lumens, about half that in real lumens and it all goes exactly where you want. They also have multiple lenses and probably multiple internal LED's that put light not just forward but sideways.   This replaces all the bad parts - lens, reflector and light source, with something utterly outstanding.   If the unconventional looks of the JW Speaker turns you off, there is a very nearly as good and quite affordable option, which is the Truck-Lite Phase 7.   Basically, open the headlight bucket up, remove the reflector, put in the LED reflector and plug in the cable and presto, massively upgraded lighting that will pretty much never require bulb changes and the like.

Most popular option is Norton Commando style mufflers. Brakes are always an issue with T140s if they have been sitting. The ribber lines swell and the master cylinder barrels corrode. The rear master cylinder is a job to get to, it you don't have a lift and proper tools it will be a mofo. Sensible upgrades like better mufflers, braided one piece brake lines, and new Amal carbs will make a world of difference. Amal still makes the concentric 930 carbs and they are better than ever. These late model 750cc Triumphs are the best ones. All American standard hardware, disc brakes, the best forks they made, and a five speed gearbox. Don't believe the hype Mikunis suck on Triumphs. People have problems with 30+ year old carburetors and don't realize the  problem is not the design, its that they are old AF. The new Amals bolt right on and use the same cables."

Triumph,310d6j,johnny_duet,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:13:35 2015 UTC,you can't see them when you are riding the bike and you are the one getting the utility. those are big solid cans that hold a lot of stuff. you can either bolt one on the LHS or get 2 on either side.  does anything else really matter?
Triumph,310d6j,aDDnTN,1 point,Wed Apr 1 14:27:25 2015 UTC,I thought it was a Triumph... my bad. Lossa engineering bike w/ ammo cans http://pipeburn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cl450-161.jpeg But a very cool look here's a Triumph http://pipeburn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_8686-Edit.jpg
Triumph,30yi35,shoktipus,12,Tue Mar 31 19:03:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, your more likely than not to drop your first bike. Can you financially afford to write off a Speed Triple?  If not, go get a beater 250/300 or a decade old bike for cheap maybe an SV650.Ride it for a year,  then move up. But there are so many factors here you haven't discussed. Will it be your daily bike or a fun bike? What weather? What level of experience are you in similar skill sets? (wrt dirt bikes and such)? How much will your insurance go? How mature are you really?   If you are set on the style of a speed triple, maybe consider a street triple. Riding ten years, still enough power to scare the bejebus out of me sometimes. But usually a litre + bike is too much power for a newbie even with the best of intentions. I wouldn't even start on a fz6r either."
Triumph,30yi35,redumbdant_antiphony,0,Tue Mar 31 19:08:06 2015 UTC,"26, commuter bike and weekend. Plan on using it daily. I live is SF so I don't really have to deal with seasons. I can afford it. haven't looked into insurance, but the fz6r was 700 annually so I imagine it'd be a few hundred more. I have no intentions of being an organ doner or being stupid on it. no riding exp. besides the cmsp course. I was told supersports will just kind of ""go"" when you barely apply the throttle and that's why you should have plenty of exp. before riding one. I guess that's what I'm really asking. If I apply a little throttle, will I get a little power or will it just launch? I know i'll likely drop it, but hopefully that's while starting off from a stop and it will be cosmetics."
Triumph,30yi35,redumbdant_antiphony,0,Tue Mar 31 21:44:43 2015 UTC,"Let me be real with you, no one intends on being an organ doner. But shit happens. Until you have real skills,  which only come from training and practice not confidence, which act like muscle memory and mental drills, you probably aren't ready for a bike like this. A 1050(or so) triple will have a ridiculous amount of torque compared to what you think it will have and it will only take 1-1 millionth of a second to wreck your life with it. It sucks. I know.  My first bike was a single cylinder Buell blast. Boy did it such but a year later I got my Street Triple and I am glad. From the second I started riding I wanted  triple but if I had gotten it first, I probably would have killed myself when I laid down my Buell. (thank god for protection. Don't go cheap on it. Every part covered every time)  I'm military reserves and if I ever deploy for a year away,  I'm starting back at square one on a Blast or Ninja 250 for 6 months before I get on my bike because it isn't a simple matter of believing you are prepared. It is a matter of experience.  Good luck. I hope you enjoy your bike and I hope you make a smart choice.  Remember, there a there are only two types of motorcyclists : those who have dropped a bike and those who will."
Triumph,30yi35,Scrambl,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:40:21 2015 UTC,"You are right at the start, but I think you go a bit overboard on the year hiatus. The thing with bikes is experience, you don't get inexperienced with a year off of a bike. At most a little 'rusty'.  As for the speed, look if you can try the street triple. It is a good commuter and works just as fine as the speed for weekends. Both have little to no room for stuff on the backseat."

The smart move, would be to start out way smaller and spend significant time gaining experience.  Still, while I'm an old fuck and know that now - I didn't follow the above when I was a teen, beat the odds and survived. So while the advice above is sound, I ain't gonna be a hypocrite. Make up your own mind, you know the risks."

Triumph,30yi35,cr0ft,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:43:49 2015 UTC,".... a Street Triple is easily still in the ""don't do it"" superbike category.   No beginner belongs anywhere near a bike with over 100 horsepower."
Triumph,30yi35,peen_was,3,Wed Apr 1 07:58:17 2015 UTC,It's not just the 1050 either. The bike has more torque than the inline 4s making newbie mistakes that much more likely to be costly. It's a touchy sonofabitch.
Triumph,30yi35,cup-o-farts,5,Tue Mar 31 22:00:48 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say no. It's got a lot of power so there is nothing subtle about it. Gotta learn to use the throttle on smaller bikes before you let the torque monster out. On top of that power is that it's a heavy bike, so learning to maneuver curves is more difficult, it's hard to ease out of a corner after trail braking.  I would say go for a Street Triple instead for a first bike if you like the looks of the Speedy."
Triumph,30yi35,GazzyG,2,Tue Mar 31 19:29:36 2015 UTC,"Probably a bit too much, tbh.  You might be absolutely fine having one as a first bike, but they ARE quite a powerful machine. Any litre bike will easily spin the back wheel/launch the front wheel into the air.  Give it too much throttle midway through a bend and you're in for a world of trouble."
Triumph,30yi35,distantdrake,2,Tue Mar 31 20:16:13 2015 UTC,"Don't take my word for it, but watch this Regular Car reviews vid of the triumph 675 daytona.  Different bike, but the same conclusion holds up.  You'll be able to ride it. You will be able to control your impulses for 99% of the time...untill you try and kill yourself. You will drop it. You may die, you may live, but chances are you will get a big moment at some point.  Get a cheap, technically sound bike. Get some miles on it. A lot of em. Then watch some of your biker buddies have their crashes. If you hang around bike guys you will see those stories around you. Try to learn from other people's mistakes. When you have done this for a couple of years you'll know this is the truth. Then you'll be ready. Maybe.  edit:I know I maybe sound like your dad, but I crashed. All my mates exept one crashed at some point. Luckily all lived to tell the tale, but were hurt. Bikes busted up, summers ruined. It's no fun."

I put 7000 miles on a ninja 250 before touching anything else and now I am comfortable on my Striple. Just get some experience under your belt on something less likely to ruin your day.

Triumph,30yi35,Nick_Cliche,2,Thu Apr 2 03:25:58 2015 UTC,"I am going to take an unpopular view and say that you will be fine. I returned to riding with a Bonneville and after learning the basic of maneuvering a motorcycle again, I found the bike was more suited to a different style of riding than I enjoyed. I test drove a speed triple and knew immediately it was right for me. I walked away from the Bonneville three months after I bought it with no regrets except losing my shirt in the trade in.     While the speed triple has a lot of power and torque, the power delivery is smooth and tame. It feels solid on the road and makes a great commuting bike and can easily be a tourer with some additional equipment. I put 12k miles on it in the Arizona wilderness and I never felt it lacked dexterity in the mountains and canyons.      The only downside I can think of is the speed triple supports lazy motorcycle habits because of the torque. People who want a high level of involvement with the bike and feel best when they are dropping gears and wringing out the engine might not be suited to the triple which can happily lug along and pass cars without a gear change."
Triumph,30yi35,idpeeinherbutt,1 point,Tue Mar 31 23:09:44 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with you. The 1050 isn't a crazy motor, it's a very smooth powerband. However, it's so smooth it's hard to tell if you're doing 60 mph, or 90 mph. That's the scary part about it.  You're better off learning on a bike that barely goes over 70 mph, in my opinion."
Triumph,30yi35,Evilsmurfkiller,1 point,Wed Apr 1 04:41:41 2015 UTC,"No, it is a very powerful bike. I liked my Ninja 650r for my first bike, owned it for 3 years. I dropped it a couple times at zero speed and came close to crashing at speed more than I'd like to think about."

Triumph,30yi35,cr0ft,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:39:17 2015 UTC,"Can you survive doing it? Probably.   Is it a good idea? No. Not remotely.   As long as you go slow, take it easy, don't get worked up you can probably learn ok on a literbike with insane amounts of power. The problem comes in when you suddenly start thinking you're right up there with Rossi and start actually using the power and maneuverability that's in a Speed Triple. A bike like that pushed to its limits is too much bike for almost every dilettante rider, really, and can easily take them beyond their capabilities. You can go from in control to flying off the road in one split second of bad decision making.  That's the real problem with starting on a super sport,  not the times when you ride as if on eggshells, but the times when you let testosterone take over - and it will absolutely happen.   A small, light, not very powerful bike simply won't let you do that, because the power isn't there to begin with. You can wring the neck of a 250 and it's fun and exciting still and it doesn't immediately go way way beyond what you can truly handle.   Dropping a bike, financial issues, yada yada yada are not important. The fact that the bike is so so much more capable than you'll be for literally a year or two at least of riding is the real problem.  Start small. Learn to ride. Have fun with a small, nimble, flickable bike that isn't intimidating. Then get something that can put you in orbit with one twist of the wrist.  I'm currently riding a bike with 140 horsepower and enough torque to easily do 0-60 in 3-something seconds. But I started out on a 50 cc bike years ago, and went from there to 125, then 600, then this. I say this not to pat myself on the back or anything, it felt like a natural progression, but the key is that I had fun on all those classes of bike on the way. Different type of fun for different bikes, but still. So start small. Then work your way up."
Triumph,30yi35,Rebornxshiznat,1 point,Wed Apr 1 07:47:46 2015 UTC,Depends on you.  I rode dirt bike and motocross all my life.  First street bike was my 13 st3. So far two seasons down starting the third and no issues.  I haven't crashed or almost crashed.  Only thing that happened was my pants were too baggy and got caught on the peg.. Fell over at a standstill but nothing more than injured pride.  If you understand the basics you will be fine.  If you've never ridden anything before... Probably a bad idea.
Triumph,30yi35,Johnny_Sailor,1 point,Sun Apr 5 23:37:52 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else has said, I'd say this is a big mistake. The absolute best (in my opinion of course) starter bike that you can grow with for years are the new Honda 500 series. They make a naked, sport, and adventure style with slight price differences between the 3.   I know this is the triumph subreddit, but triumph doesn't currently make a great ""starter"" bike. Even a Bonneville might be a bit much.   You have unearned confidence right now because you did well in a controlled environment. You need to build up real world skill to go along with it first."

You're not going to know what's wrong until you take it off. My guess is a torn gasket - did you put a bit of oil on the gasket before installing?
Triumph,30se5w,HoldingThePoop,8,Mon Mar 30 08:38:53 2015 UTC,"Either bike will do zero to illegal really quickly. I like the street triple since its really light (great in the city), cheap to insure (even by Ontario standards), and plenty quick. I see no need for anything bigger for someone of my size (5'10"", 180lbs). I've never ridden the speed triple, but when I say on it when shopping I thought the weight would be annoying when trying to maneuver it slowly... every damn day in my garage."

Triumph,30se5w,chunkyks,2,Tue Mar 31 05:00:35 2015 UTC,"The speed has great stability, which makes it wrestle with you when you're trying to have fun in the twisties."
Triumph,30se5w,idpeeinherbutt,5,Tue Mar 31 06:06:51 2015 UTC,"Speed Triple has straight speed but is a heavier bike and harder to gently pull out of turns and flick back and forth (it always just wants to go). Street is light and a little more nimble on corners but loses on the straights.  Rode with a guy who converted a wrecked Daytona to a street and damn I could not keep up with him at all in the turns. He probably would beat me in the straights too.  The Speedy keeps me looking over my shoulder for cops. I can't drive slower than 85. Sometimes I wish I got the Street, then I get some of that torque pulling on me and I forget what I was talking about.  Besides that single sided swing arm is the sexiest thing ever."

Luckily my mum had a street triple and after riding it, yes it has amazing handle and was very fun, but I found myself wanting more grunt. In my opinion if you're used to the larger engines, it's very difficult to drop down to the 675 and you'll most likely enjoy the speed triple more. But if not you can really throw the street triples around corners with a huge grin on your face."

Triumph,30r4ah,gonzoforpresident,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:25:39 2015 UTC,"Wrong thickness detent spring. The recall affects 349 units of the 2012-2013 Triumph Speed Triple. Recall documents released by NHTSA list several other models affected by the same problem, though no units from any of these models in the U.S. are included the recall. These other models include the non-ABS Speed Triple, the Speed Triple R (with and without ABS), the Tiger 1050, the Tiger Sport, the Sprint ST and the Sprint GT."
Triumph,30s68y,WestcoastWelker,1 point,Mon Mar 30 06:30:45 2015 UTC,"Your issue has the same symptoms as this one a few months ago. In that case, the previous owner did an awful job on the wiring of the tail and also had a blown fuse.    Now, since the Street shares a lot of components with the Daytona, rear light included, you can try to follow what was said on that thread and eliminate a few possible causes."

Triumph,30s68y,cr0aker,1 point,Tue Mar 31 00:35:17 2015 UTC,"Probably not LED if you lost half of it (ie no rear light, just brake). The 2009 is also probably too old to have received LED's as standard. So the likelihood is very high half of your bulb blew, there are two filaments inside every normal brake light bulb usually. One for running light, the other for brake.   You can get LED ""bulbs"" that fit where the normal light goes though, but (even if you get the red variant you should get) it may not be quite as bright as the old incandescent.   Might be a good time to start thinking of finding a LED version and retrofitting it, one that's LED inside a sealed unit, those will burn for 30000 hours so that's the lifetime of the bike, but that requires a little elbow grease and planning.   Might check at http://www.triumphrat.net, there's a Street Triple specific forum with lots of enthusiastic owners and lots of old archived data to search through."
Triumph,30s68y,cr0ft,1 point,Mon Mar 30 12:38:12 2015 UTC,2009 has an LED unit according to my bike's manual. I just happened to be reading that section yesterday.
Triumph,30s68y,TriumphsNTriplations,1 point,Mon Mar 30 23:57:14 2015 UTC,"two stage bulbs have two elements, maybe you final lost your last running light element?  have you checked the fuses? maybe one went bad.  are the lights wired into the loom or do they have their own charging system? if the latter, perhaps it's come loose from the battery. if the former, perhaps a splice has come loose?"
Triumph,30t00a,Drewobvs,3,Mon Mar 30 13:43:53 2015 UTC,"That's unusual. As /u/aDDnTN says, don't spray it. Slight exception to that: spray on brake cleaner would not be harmful, but won't solve the problem.   Check how much meat is left on the brake pads. There should be at least 1.5 mm of material between the metal backing of the pad and the disc on both pads. If it's less than that, you need to replace the pads. However if you've worn out the pads this early, there is a problem. Either you are relying entirely on the rear brake (bad, and likely to get you hurt) or the pins on which the rear caliper slides have seized, so that only one pad is working."
Triumph,30t00a,ctesibius,2,Mon Mar 30 14:32:55 2015 UTC,Yea that is pretty early to need pads unless something went wrong.   The other problem I've seen is that people will end up resting their foot on the rear brake without noticing. They end up wearing it out pretty quick when that happens. OP by any chance do you think you could be doing this? Either way check the pads. If they are worn make sure the caliper has not seized.   Also I'd say look at the ebc pads if you do need a set. I have them on mine and have been really happy.
Triumph,30t00a,ccosby,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:00:22 2015 UTC,"Small note on EBC pads for OP. They sell  two types - organic and sintered (""HH""). HH gives about 30% more braking power (allegedly - I've no way of checking this), but it wears the disc. Organic pads mainly wear the pad, not the disc. Discs are much more expensive than brake pads, so don't use HH unless you really have to - and they are definitely not needed on the back brake."
Triumph,30t00a,ctesibius,3,Mon Mar 30 22:06:02 2015 UTC,no spray. just use the brake more often.

Triumph,30t00a,cr0ft,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:30:03 2015 UTC,"Squeaky brakes usually mean the surface is uneven. This can happen from brake pad residue sticking and causing it to get bumpy. The squeal is actually the disc vibrating, from what I gather.  Try brake cleaner and really assault it with a steel brush and see if you can polish the disc off. Sanding it with very fine grit sandpaper isn't out of the question either (note, very fine, you don't want to make it more uneven)."

Triumph,30ffxy,G-wow,3,Fri Mar 27 00:52:04 2015 UTC,This is the right answer for any original Triumph accessories. Go to the above page (http://www.triumphinstructions.com that is) and feed in the part number into the search. The part number is on the box or you can find it online. That will spit out an actual installation instruction.
Triumph,30ffxy,cr0ft,3,Fri Mar 27 05:54:26 2015 UTC,"Going off memory here, but I think you just need to pull the black rubber caps up which will expose a nut or the stem, which you unscrew with a wrench. Then the whole mirror comes out of the perch and you simply replace it. They should just drop right in the same spot unless you got the wrong mirror type which will have a larger or smaller screw."
Triumph,30ex6r,Byaa,5,Thu Mar 26 20:35:00 2015 UTC,"Every 6000 miles for service and every 12000 is valves. Pay 250 at the dealer, it's way less to do it yourself.  I've ride both and picked the triumph. It had more character, to me the fzo9 just felt like a machine. On the street triple r I feel like I am one with the bike."
Triumph,30ex6r,Gman-5001,2,Thu Mar 26 22:16:23 2015 UTC,"That's how I kind of feel, despite not owning or riding one yet haha. Every time I hear that whistle or see a rare one on the road, I just can't help but smile!"
Triumph,30ex6r,ccosby,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:25:11 2015 UTC,Yea the triumph service intervals are not that bad.   For around 100 bucks or so you can buy the dealer service manual for the triumph. The bikes also use ODB2(same interface as cars). This means the cheap shitty car diag device you buy from the auto store can read its error codes(as long as it supports can). Both of these things helps if you want to do any service yourself.
Triumph,30ex6r,rllamarca,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:30:52 2015 UTC,"Based on everyone's responses, it seems like the Triumph service intervals fall in line with pretty much any other sport bike from the Big 4 manufacturers. The only difference is if there is a part that needs replacing, it might take a week or two to ship those parts over.  But I've also heard Triumph dealers have a reputations for really taking care of their riders, so that alone is something worth to consider."
Triumph,30ex6r,chunkyks,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:50:02 2015 UTC,You can also pick up one of the cheap Bluetooth units on amazon and download torque to use it with your smartphone.
Triumph,30ex6r,TKM_PT,3,Sun Mar 29 00:17:57 2015 UTC,"To answer the question as posed: I save up minor quibbles that aren't significantly impacting the bike and get them dealt with at the 6k mile service intervals [at two intervals so far, I also bought new tires]. As a result, my major intervals typically cost me 800 bucks or so at the dealer. I do my own oil changes and minor stuff in between major intervals; I use full synthetic in the Triumph, so an oil+filter change is 80 bucks in materials and 20 minutes of my time.  That being said: The FZ-09 is a direct shot across the bow of triumph's street triple dominance. The bottom line is that the FZ-09 is a couple grand cheaper sticker price, but for that you get three or four grand's less bike.  If money is a primary driver, the FZ-09 is a perfectly good bike, and owners seem largely happy now the fuelling issues are fixed. If money is not a primary driver, just get the street triple; it's a much better bike."
Triumph,30ex6r,Ski1215,2,Fri Mar 27 04:43:28 2015 UTC,"I have a Daytona (same engine and frame) and I've done 3 regular and 3 valve adjustment services.  I find that the cost is about the same as the Japanese rivals. That might be different on the Street segment, but I don't think it will be by much.   Parts availability may be an issue if you're in a rush but on a normal and planned situation it won't be a problem. For me, it usually takes a week from ordering to getting parts that aren't in stock."
Triumph,30ex6r,Nic01101011,2,Thu Mar 26 22:36:56 2015 UTC,"Triumph is not ""exotic"" enough that costs are much different than the big 4.  In simplistic terms the bikes are similar in configuration, so major service like valves adjustments will require more or less the same amount of times. I have 3 friends with street triples and all have had done valve checks that were in spec. I expect mine to be at the end of this season as well.  The only area where the street triple simple can't compete is in power. The FZ09 can pick the front wheel up with no clutch in first and second gear. It's a fast and fun bike for sure but I think the street triple beats it in character."
Triumph,30ex6r,BMOCROC,1 point,Fri Mar 27 00:56:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah the Triumph just screams character and soul (literally!). But the raw power of the FZ-09 is also appealing, given it's price. Even though I like to consider myself a mature adult who won't make dumb decisions (lol), that power and torque that I've seen/heard from the FZ-09 is so tempting."
Triumph,30ex6r,G-wow,2,Fri Mar 27 17:53:05 2015 UTC,"Valve adj is at 12k. Mine were in spec and didn't need adjustment. 12k service which includes a whole bunch of other things was like 800 at an indie shop here in SoCal. Hardly worth sweating. It's not a fragile or finnicky bike in my experience. Try to get test rides tho, that's ultimately what matters. Maybe the FZ09 would float your boat, who knows"

I have a friend who was in the same boat, she chose the fz. I got the str just before she put money down on hers. As far as maintenance I'm not familiar with the fz schedule but the str is first service at 500 the 6k and 12k. The dealer I bought it from was telling me they charge $400 and change for the first service, I'm doubtful I'll bring it to them as I'm probably going to have a friend who owns a shop do the work. But I'll shop around with prices, I have the service sheet and know what exactly needs to be done during each service so I'm not worried as long as they're trained and records are kept so my warranty stays in tact."

I liked the look of the street and the fact that it wasn't jap. I never really asked her why she went with the fz, she had a ninja 250/300? That she just sold and didn't want something too sporty like that again so she got the fz, I believe her bf has an fz as well."

Triumph,300m21,tranquil45,4,Mon Mar 23 14:55:23 2015 UTC,"car wash soap (NOT DISH SOAP) in a bucket with a car wash sponge, go to town on the bodywork, rims, engine cases, etc.  once all the grime is off, hit it with the hose!  spray it all over, you can't hurt it.  if you spend too much time near the wheel hubs or where the triples bolt in you may get some water in the bearings, but honestly thats a MINIMAL chance and only if your using a high pressure water system like a pressure washer (which do work GREAT on bikes)  after its rinsed off, towel dry, start it up and take it for a ride until its at FULL temp, this burns off any water thats hiding in crevices or somehow got in somewhere.  basically, same process you'd use to wash your car.  just like washing a car, you want to drive it afterwards to burn off any water that may have gotten in the engine bay, suspension components, etc.   if you already rode in the rain, whats the big deal lol  after you get back from the ride and its all dry, you may want to wax it and keep the paint shiny and protected"
Triumph,300m21,hondabuilder,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:32:39 2015 UTC,"Yep. Auto soap for an auto.   Bikes are pretty water resistant from the factory. You probably don't want to force water into anything (exhaust, electronics, etc) but spraying it with a normal pressure hose is safe."

Triumph,300m21,hondabuilder,0,Mon Mar 23 16:58:45 2015 UTC,"Pressure washing a motorcycle is a bad idea. The water will get in everywhere and in general it's completely unnecessary. A normal hose with normal water will gently rinse most things off. The stuff that doesn't rinse off, you hit with a foam gun and let it sit for a while, then rinse again, then wash with a wash mitt and car shampoo."
Triumph,300m21,cr0ft,1 point,Tue Mar 24 08:31:14 2015 UTC,"A pressure washer can squeeze set in oil out of concrete.  Clearly pointing it at delicate parts on a bike is not a good idea. I agree.  Using it from 5-8 feet away is good but only as effective as a normal hose. Might as well just rinse off with a normal hose.  I do pressure wash extremely oily grimy engine cases right before I'm about to tear down and rebuild the engine, dont even find much water inside though besides open intake and exhaust valves, which are covered when a motor is installed in the bike"
Triumph,300m21,hondabuilder,5,Tue Mar 24 15:30:55 2015 UTC,"It is very intense. I only use organic, free range water with hand-extracted caranuba wax.  Actually, I just go to the car wash stalls and use the low pressure setting. If it doesn't have one, I stand farther back a bit.

Triumph,300m21,cr0ft,1 point,Mon Mar 23 16:52:07 2015 UTC,"First off, a more urgent warning - never let bird poop sit. That stuff will eat into your paintwork, quite literally. If you see some on the bike, get it off asap.   Anyway, as for washing - I use the same procedure as you should use when hand-washing a car. A two-bucket wash system is the core of it. One bucket with clear water, one with car shampoo and water. In the bottom of those buckets are grit guards, and every time you go in with your wash mitt to either rinse or get soapy water, you scrub it against the grit guard in the bottom to scrape the particles off it so you don't scrape up the paint work.   There are tons of great guides online on two-bucket washing and detailing in general. Lots of people just scrub stuff off and call it a day but I usually have the time to do it by the numbers, so why not? The bike is hobby and an item I really care about so I think it's worth doing it right.  A proper wash is roughly something like this, if you include all the steps: First, hose the bike off with a normal low pressure hose. This will gently remove all the loose debris. Second, optionally hose it down with a foam gun and let that sit for a little while. Then hose that off too, taking more grit off.   Then you go in with a wash mitt or microfiber of some kind and use the two-bucket system to wash the bike, starting on top where it's cleanest and working your way down. If it's really nasty, do the wheels separately as those will be the filthiest, again the key is to never scrub the bike with old dirt in the washing mitt.   After you've washed the bike, dry it. A shammy is the old school method, large microfiber cloths can work, but personally I prefer air. There are actual car dryers that output warm, dry and filtered air in copious amounts and blasting the bike with that will get all the water off the chrome parts before it has a chance to form any water spots. Lots of people use leaf blowers for this as well.  Once the bike is clean and dry, you are still looking at anything from spraying it with detailer and wiping it down to clear up any water spotting, polishing the paint, polishing the chrome and applying wax etc to it all to really go the whole nine yards depending on the condition of the bike.   Overkill? Almost certainly. But it is quite satisfying to have it done. And this is still far from an actual full detailing job on a bike, that can take days."

I bought some sheet metal from the hardware store. Removed the fender, cut some cardboard to size to fit the hole. Transfers the shape to the sheet metal. Cut, test fit, drilled holes and sand. Then primer and paint. All n all cost was about $75 including lights, metal and tools that I did not already have."
Triumph,2zyqfu,Dr-Kadaver,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:36:20 2015 UTC,"I have the exact same Bonnie, and plan to do the exact same thing. If you don't mind answering a few questions: (1) did you pattern the protective sheet metal plate on the portion of the fender you removed, or did you download a template from somewhere? (2) what plate bracket did you use? (3) what sheet metal thickness did you use? I've heard 2 mm is recommended, but for some reason, my local hardware stores don't carry it..."
Triumph,2zyqfu,Dr-Kadaver,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:55:30 2015 UTC,"(1)I didn't use a template. When you removed the fender, your left with a pretty big hole between your frame rails.  Looking at it and looking at FEK you can buy its pretty obvious what needs to be covered.  I started with a Rectangle piece of cardboard, and cut it down to snugly fit between the frame rails.   Then cut out portions for the cable loom and seat hooks.  It mounts to same location where the OEM fender bolted to. (2)The plate  bracket came with the light I ordered from ebay.  (3) I used 16 gauge. But I would use what ever you have thats easy to work it.  It just needs to be strong enough to protect against road debris.  I recently bought a vacuum pump to make my own carbon parts.  I might try to remake this out of fiberglass for practice."

Triumph,2zvoz7,ccosby,2,Sun Mar 22 16:26:33 2015 UTC,"Enjoy the bike. Depending on where you are pulling the emissions can really make it run better. The secondary ai will blue the pipes very quick and causes that bogged down feeling when you let off the throttle. Many(including myself) will go to better exhaust, pull the airbox baffle, replace the restricted snorkle with a better intake, and pull the o2 sensors that are only used in the low end range and put a TTP tune on. Do it right and you get up to around 10 rwh added apparently(I never dyno'd mine but the difference is very noticeable).   You also have a massive amount of aftermarket parts for these bikes.   Here is an old picture of my 2014. I've had to replace the tires since it was taken, upgraded the front braking, and relocated the rear caliber.   http://imageshack.com/a/img674/1043/xwIJYZ.jpg"

Triumph,2zvoz7,unkmi3390,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:09:32 2015 UTC,That is a standard bonneville/thruxton fender. They normally have a reflector hanging off the back and I took it off. I like the look of these bikes without the rear fender but the front fender on a t100 is just too big in my mind to not have a rear. I didn't care to swap it so the standard length rear was my solution. If I was doing a cafe racer style I'd have a really small front fender and the rear removed.  If you look on forums like triumphrat and on ebay you can find pulled fenders. I think I paid around 100 bucks for the fender and it was off a black bike so I didn't need to paint it. It also came with the stock lights which I've been too lazy to sell although I could recoup a good bit of that money doing it. A lot of people pull them off thruxtons though so they are not that hard to find.
Triumph,2zvoz7,deckoturf,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:26:58 2015 UTC,"My pipes have already started to blue pretty bad and I'm not too happy about that.

Triumph,2zvoz7,BMOCROC,1 point,Sun Mar 22 22:04:01 2015 UTC,Yes that is the brown leather version with the standard stitching(they have it in diamond as well). They also make the seat in vinyl which is less. I've seen the vinyl in person and it looked good until to saw my leather one next to it. The guy that had it went and replaced it with the leather one with the diamond stitching.   Yea the secondary ai is going to lower the heat some in the pipes. In my case the difference in the throttle and the feel letting off the throttle was well worth it. My pipes were getting black with the secondary ai on. I pulled it long before I put the arrow's on. Gotta say I love the bronzing they got as they broke in.

If you're concerned with the headers/pipes turning blue and want an easy fix, then grab some autosol metal polish and use old t-shirt strips to get it clean.

Triumph,2zvoz7,mancubuss,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:06:34 2015 UTC,Yea pulling the secondary ai and doing the mods for a ttp tune really help these bikes.
Triumph,2zvoz7,NotSpoken1,1 point,Sun Mar 22 16:04:30 2015 UTC,I heard that remapping the TTP voids the factory warranty. Do I have to worry about that?
Triumph,2zvoz7,kared,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:57:52 2015 UTC,Short answer is it depends on the dealer if they will care or not. Long answer is you can modify the product and as long as it doesn't cause the problem they shouldn't be able to void the warranty(at least in the US).   I had my bike in for a warranty work for an oil leak. My dealer didn't care about the TTP tune.
Triumph,2zvoz7,deckoturf,1 point,Sun Mar 22 22:23:22 2015 UTC,I have a 14 scrambler. Can you elaborate?
Triumph,2zvoz7,deckoturf,2,Mon Mar 23 05:55:27 2015 UTC,"First thing to do is go over to www.TriumphRat.net and get acquainted with the forums.  TuneECU is a free computer program that lets you upload new fuel maps to your bike (the equivalent of rejetting a carburetor, but for EFI bikes). TTP is short for Triumph Twin Power, a company that provides downloadable fuel maps and other performance accessories. A common chain of events for modification is to start with the removal of the Secondary Air Injection (SAI), and O2 sensors.  Then get an aftermarket exhaust and remove the airbox baffle, and install a TTP tune, and you'll kick yourself for not doing it sooner."
Triumph,2zvoz7,soupbowlII,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:03:19 2015 UTC,With the ttp tune do you ruin your gas mileage?
Triumph,2zvoz7,AncientDragons,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:04:56 2015 UTC,"Ehh, it did go down a bit.  Not sure if that's because of the tune itself, or because the bike is so fun to ride that I'm heavy on the throttle.  I did start using Premium fuel as well, I was noticing some minor pinging with regular gas and the TTP tune."

It hasn't even affected the oil level it's so minor,  bolts likely need to be re-torqued or the gasket replaced."

Triumph,2zlm3o,aDDnTN,3,Thu Mar 19 17:58:49 2015 UTC,"when you buy a battery tender it will come with a lead for connecting to the battery, as well as a lead that has battery clamps/clips on it for temporary charging.  this ""lead"" has two wires on one end and a fitting like the USB adapter in /u/afeagle1021's post (except it is the MIRROR IMAGE of that fitting). The two wires will go on your battery terminals (aka posts) via loops installed on their ends that go around the battery terminal screws, where you bike's electrical system makes it's contact with the battery.   there is an indicator for polarity on at least one of the wires, make sure it is attached to the corresponding battery terminal. then you plug your bike into the tender overnight and plug the usb adapter in when you need to power your phone when you are riding.  you might need to get creative about how you run your usb cable if you want it secured and out of the way.  Link to lead sold without tender  Link to Battery Tender Jr."
Triumph,2zlm3o,vambot5,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:38:37 2015 UTC,"We just got a bonneville with battery tender leads installed to the battery. The previous owner said that she had used it with a phone charger, but we haven't yet looked into devices that work for that purpose. We're just using the bike for in-town riding right now, so it's not an issue. Are you familiar with any phone charger connectors that will fit to the battery tender connector?"
Triumph,2zlm3o,aDDnTN,2,Fri Mar 20 04:27:02 2015 UTC,"ohh yeah, i want to add that this USB adapter set up is directly connected to the battery. which means that if you use it as described, it will draw even when you turn the power off on the bike.  i'm not sure charging a phone can drain enough power to kill your battery, but there's always a first time!"
Triumph,2zlm3o,ccosby,3,Thu Mar 19 18:46:48 2015 UTC,Triumph makes an accessory power outlet for your bike.   http://shop.triumphmotorcycles.com/various/id-A9938015/Auxiliary_Power_Socket  If you don't feel like installing it yourself a dealer should for half an hours work. Really the bike is wired for it though if I'm not mistaken so it should be pretty much plug and play. Just use some thread locker on the mount so it doesn't vibrate loose.   Anyway that gives you a powerlet outlet. You can get a powerlet to usb power adapter or get a powerlet to cigarette lighter adapter and run a car charger.   On a plus side you can then always buy the optimate charger and powerlet adapter and let it charge your battery over the off season. This makes it plug and play.
Triumph,2zlm3o,aDDnTN,2,Thu Mar 19 23:05:07 2015 UTC,"imo, this is a better way to go because that hooks up through the main ignition switch, so the outlet will be OFF when the bike is OFF."

Triumph,2zjd7o,clumaho,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:09:38 2015 UTC,"The thunderbird will probably be more familiar. That parallel twin has a 270 degree crank so it should sound and behave as a v-twin. That bike is targeted directly at the dyna I think.  Not that I've ridden one, closest I got was an 865cc speedmaster :)  Definitely give the rocket a try. Unlike the thunderbird, it was designed with the idea of 'bigger is better' and to be different, and is really more intimidating on paper and walking around it than it really should be. You will notice that it is heavier at first, but that melts away once it's under it's own power.  That engine isn't designed for hp, it's designed for torque and having it everywhere. You can pull away nicely even at 1000rpm if you feel like it.  In the end I had the choice of a harley vrod, triumph thunderbird and rocket 3 when I bought mine. The harley was out due to the 3 month wait, and in the end the Thunderbird and Rocket3 were the same price. So the extra 600cc won me over :)"

Triumph,2zbwmq,Nic01101011,3,Tue Mar 17 13:14:26 2015 UTC,"This right here! My first bike was the sv650 and after 1 year I bought a StreetTriple. I'm glad I did this because I think the StreetTriple still feels like a beast if it's your first bike. I know a lot of guys say it's all right for a first ride but I disagree. A first bike should be something smooth on which you can test the bike and your own limits. Although the street triple is one awesome bike I think a starting rider can become scared by the power it delivers. This in turn can scare a driver, make him tense up and overall make the drive not so enjoyable. I like the sv650 as a starter bike because the V twin delivers a lot of torque, handles great and is quite cheap.  I'm 6ft4 and fit good on both the Suzuki and the Triumph.  My advice is to have a test ride on both machines and see what you like best!  Anyway; enjoy mate! You're gonna have a lot of fun!"
Triumph,2zbwmq,nightpilot,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:40:15 2015 UTC,I'm 6'1 and I felt cramped on my SV650S which was my previous bike. Maybe the SV650 naked is better for taller riders.

Triumph,2zbwmq,audiosf,2,Tue Mar 17 20:33:46 2015 UTC,The power comes on very predictably so it should be safe but you might have more fun on a bike where you can use it's full power as a beginner instead of having to hold back often
Triumph,2zbwmq,Bazzie,1 point,Tue Mar 17 08:59:21 2015 UTC,Living in California the speed limits range from 45-60mph on surface streets and 65-75mph on the freeways. Given I'd probably be traveling at slightly faster speeds would I not need to hold back as much?
Triumph,2zbwmq,Bazzie,2,Tue Mar 17 09:10:00 2015 UTC,Highways should be fine if you have reasonable self control. My comment was aimed more towards riding over twisty roads. As a beginner you would have to be more carefull while accellerating out of corners on a street triple compared to a lighter bike. The street is nowhere near a dangerous bike but I know I personally prefer riding bikes where I feel I can really give it the beans instead of holding back since I can't master all the power.
Triumph,2zbwmq,daeatenone,0,Tue Mar 17 09:22:30 2015 UTC,But you would agree that it would be safe for a beginner to learn the basics on a 675 if the 300s are too small?
Triumph,2zbwmq,Bazzie,3,Tue Mar 17 09:34:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't, just because i know I abused my first bike because I didn't know a whole lot. Not to mention dropping it a few times for stupid reasons (slipping in the wet, riding off with my disk lock on, falling over in a steep gutter, etc.). If i dropped my street triple i would cry. Also, consider that the OEM Triumph parts are crazy expensive compared to Japanese bikes. If you drop the Daytona or street triple and damage the tank (which would get damaged fairly easily because of it's shape), that thing is $700+ to replace. Just my 2c"

Triumph,2zbwmq,Campeador,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:53:18 2015 UTC,Both are great.  Street triple is a little more forgiving with the power.  Daytona is an accelerating beast especially when you do some mods.  If you wanted something for everyday use get the street.  If you just want something for weekend riding go with the daytona.
Triumph,2zbwmq,savethemolarbears,2,Tue Mar 17 09:22:14 2015 UTC,I know most people don't get 600s to start but would a 675 be ok to learn on if i think the 300s are too small (for my frame) to ride?
Triumph,2zbwmq,FullOppositeLock,1 point,Tue Mar 17 09:36:12 2015 UTC,"I'd start with the street triple if you want to learn.  Very linear power delivery. Plus the ergonomics are way less aggressive.  If you've never ridden a super sport it might be off putting at first.  My wife's first bike was a ninja 250.  After a month of everyday practice we sold it and got her a street triple.  Although I ride it more than her, she can still easily go back out and pick it up again quickly.  What is your frame size?  I'm 6'1"" 160.  And I'm snug on the daytona.  I fit perfectly.  Edit: I see it at the top.  I think a street triple would be fine.  Maybe cop a used one for a while and deal with a bit of a tight fit until you can flip it for a speed triple. Which is much better for larger frames."
Triumph,2zbwmq,csbsju_guyyy,1 point,Tue Mar 17 09:47:32 2015 UTC,"hello friend :)  i'm 6'0 and around that height is honestly the best size for a daytona. 6'4 would be pushing it (the bike is very thin and has a slightly more aggressive riding position in comparison to other supersports on the market)  in my opinion one's frame is not correlated with one's riding abilities e.g. a super tall guy shouldn't buy a hayabusa because liter bikes usually fit larger guys better. Do people get hayabusas as first bikes? sure, but a certain amount of risk goes into it. You've ridden on a ninja 300, thus you should be familiar with how even a small bike like that can deliver a fair amount of power.  my recommendation is for you to go to a large bike dealer in your area and just sit and get a feel for a lot of bikes and then see what fits you best cause honestly there's nothing worse than getting a bike that you realize fits you poorly after a purchase. then when you see what fits you best, go online and compare dimensions of bikes to other bikes, then you can more accurately pick out a bike for yourself. back to the daytona, there are riders who fit your height range and own daytonas, but some guys feel that the  bike is too small and others feel that the bike is comfortable so its all about perception.  good luck :)"

Its more upright than the daytona so I think I might be afforded a little more comfort but with mods, I can have any kind of ride I choose. I say youve got a couple good bikes on your radar."
Triumph,2zbwmq,Alect0,1 point,Tue Mar 17 14:02:13 2015 UTC,"From the looks of the comments so far, everyone is so excited and eager for you to join team triumph, that they are overlooking the most important factor in getting your first bike. The reason we recommend a smaller bike to begin with is not because it can't go as fast. It's because every aspect of it is easier to deal with as you learn the nuances of riding. Acceleration, emergency braking, cornering, body position, learning to anticipate other drivers' movements, etc.  All of this can be learned on any bike. But it takes time. Time that is extended by adding more bike to deal with by having that ""bigger"" bike.  And in that time, you are subject to literally life threatening situations. It's ultimately your call what you choose. But almost everyone who's been riding for a long time will tell you this.  It's worth having something small you can really wring out and throw around.  Being able to push the bike as hard as it goes without leaving YOUR comfort zone will make you so much of a better rider and in less time.  I grew up without any of this advice and was just thrown on a big boy as soon as I got on the street. It was ten years of thinking I was fast until I met some friends that showed me how to really ride. I can only imagine how much better I'd be if I'd given myself the opportunity to learn early."

I'm comfortable on it and don't feel cramped.   The Daytona felt more aggressive from just sitting on it but I can't comment on real world ergonomics.   The power is pretty linear. I've had it about a year and already wish it was faster in a straight line. It's plenty fast and flickable in the twistes though."
Triumph,2zbwmq,nightingrose,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:37:24 2015 UTC,"Do not start on a Daytona. I wouldn't even recommend starting on a striple. You don't have to go all the way down to a ninja 250 like I did but seriously, the power on bigger bikes is mind blowing. Twist of the throttle and you have 80 hp instantly, one moment of panic and you are done for.   Start on something like a 500 and you'll be just fine and won't kill yourself, especially in stop and go traffic. Hell on my 250 I could get it to 110 and it was quick enough to beat riced out integras all day. (Although fuck you guy in a blown rx7 for taunting me)  Really, start smaller then move up, bought my 250 for 600 sold it 3 years later for 1200 and I only changed the rear tire and did a few oil changes!  Would you start driving in a Ferrari? Nope! Start smaller, then in a year when you have all the skills you need, upgrade and appreciate the bike that you can control that much more."

Triumph,2z2vxb,rllamarca,2,Sun Mar 15 01:34:46 2015 UTC,"Sag is just sag, not SAG. That's the Screen Actors Guild. ;)   Seriously though, stock shocks on all bikes that aren't the very most expensive tend to be shaky. Front shocks especially so. That's why there is a market for aftermarket springs from Progressive and the like, and why people have even invented ways to tame shocks with aftermarket addons.   The front springs are probably just too soft. If you're really gung ho about dialing in the suspension you should probably be looking at aftermarket solutions at this point, and spend a few hundred.  I'd also recommend hitting up http://www.triumphrat.net and talking to the other Striplers who probably have bounced off this issue too. This is a great little subreddit but you can get a more concentrated dose of users of your specific model there."
Triumph,2z2vxb,cr0ft,2,Sun Mar 15 08:08:24 2015 UTC,"With a bit of google-fu, and the very usefull Race Tech site, you can find that the stock springs are quite stiff (.900 kg/mm). For your weight (170/180 lb), the Race Tech spring rate calculator suggests a spring rate of 0.808/0.822 kg/mm, but they only sell a spring of 0.85.  So, as you suspected, there's nothing wrong in your sag process, with the possible exception of the bike being in the rear stand. All the tutorials that I've seen says that the bike should be in a neutral position while measuring. Putting the bike in a stand might shift the weight and mess up your measures."
Triumph,2z2vxb,TKM_PT,2,Sun Mar 15 20:50:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help!  I did check the calculator and it only goes to 2010, so my next question assumes that nothing has changed between 2010 and 2012. I'm having a hard time understanding, if racetech says the stock shock is too stiff, shouldn't I be having trouble getting enough sag?  Currently I'm having the issue of too much sag, about 40m with the preload adjusters all the way in.  Wouldn't that mean that the springs are too soft for me? I dont have an issue respringing, its only $140, but to my understanding the springs I have are too soft.  I conformed with the PO that the springs were not changed."
Triumph,2z2vxb,TKM_PT,1 point,Sun Mar 15 21:57:37 2015 UTC,"From 2010 to 2012 there were no changes, so no worries there.     Currently I'm having the issue of too much sag, about 40m with the preload adjusters all the way in.   Interesting. A stiffer spring means that it can take more weight without compressing as much. That means that if your weight is lower than the rated one of the spring, it should not compress to the desired sag, thus low sag. On the other hand, if your spring was too soft, it should collapse under your wight and you'd get a much higher sag.  Could it be that the fact that the bike was on the rear stand affected the measures? Being on the rear stand raises the COG and pushes the rider weight into the front suspension."
Triumph,2z2vxb,cr0ft,2,Mon Mar 16 03:49:02 2015 UTC,"Wait, what, the bike was on a stand when measuring sag? That makes no sense. It should be on both wheels and with the rider sitting on it. I didn't even see that.   Get the bike off the stand and onto both wheels, OP."
Triumph,2z2vxb,RedBeezy,2,Mon Mar 16 06:20:54 2015 UTC,"That (the rear stand) seems to be the only thing that differed between everyone else's measurements and mine, so I'm going to have to try that when I can get my buddy to help me again."

Triumph,2yx0xr,wisepeasant,2,Fri Mar 13 19:24:42 2015 UTC,"am i missing something? OP's bike is EFI. the ""choke"" is basically and idle speed adjuster.   i didn't think they did anything on the EFI models if the bike was warmed up?  i mean, even on the old carb'd models, everything built at hinckley has an ""enricher"" and not a proper choke. it controlled an extra idle jet that enriched the A/F. no butterfly valve in filter side of the intake. CVK carbs have a butterfly valve after the slide, but that's kinda how they work."
Triumph,2yx0xr,aDDnTN,1 point,Fri Mar 13 19:38:39 2015 UTC,"Your right, it's not a ""choke"" it's an electronic fast idle or enricher. It is not required to start the bike, but does give the old guys something to play with.  If you leave it on, the bike will not idle when warm."
Triumph,2yx0xr,0rangexc,2,Fri Mar 13 20:02:58 2015 UTC,"If you leave it on, the bike will not idle when warm.   is this in the manual? is it an electric cut off thing?  FYI, electronic fast idle and enricher are functionally different. the latter might have an effect similar to the former, but the former doesn't alter the F/A like the latter. EFI does the F/A altering when it checks the intake temp."

Triumph,2yx0xr,aDDnTN,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:10:38 2015 UTC,"yeah. so from some of the things i've been reading, touching the throttle during start-up is apparently a big NO-NO.  so maybe your throttle cable was a bit too tight and you had the bars turned just right to put tension on your cable, ergo throttle input during start up, which caused a ""no-start"" condition in your ECU.  i had an issue with an overly-tightened throttle cable (i have two, btw). Everytime i turned hard right, then rev's picked up and the bike quickly moved faster than i expected. i had a heck of a time realizing it was happening, then figuring out what inputs were causing it, and finally realizing that it only happened when my handlebar was most to all of the way turned to the right!  and yes, i caused it when i tightened my throttle cable too tight to get rid of the lash in the throttle. now i've got a tiny bit of lash (1/32"", exact as the shop manual proscribes), it works fine and without the issue."

Triumph,2yhcoh,slakwhere,3,Mon Mar 9 21:05:05 2015 UTC,have the suspension freshened up and sprung for your weight properly. if you have a bit more cash to spend i'd put valves in the front and rear with the springs. or carts used if you can find them in good condition.  Suspension is the single most important thing you can do to the bike. it affects comfort and grip.  I am also a fan of the TechSpec pads for the tank. adjustable levers if you find the reach to be a problem.
Triumph,2yhcoh,slakwhere,2,Mon Mar 9 23:36:29 2015 UTC,Is this possible with the original suspension?
Triumph,2yhcoh,professorsyr,2,Tue Mar 10 07:58:21 2015 UTC,"Yes. The shock and forks are both fully serviceable. I'm willing to bet they have never been serviced, so the oil inside them is broken down and nasty. Getting fresh fluid and the proper spring I. There for your weight will transform the bike!"
Triumph,2yhcoh,The_Ross,2,Tue Mar 10 14:17:50 2015 UTC,"As your first bike, just make sure the suspension is adjusted for your weight. I wouldn't bother w/ the valves/springs etc until you've had some more experience. I would recommend the tank grips."

Going back to my old bikes takes a little while to remember to clutch while shifting up.  At lower revs it's a bit jerky and you can do better shifts using the clutch. Higher revs it becomes much cleaner.  Overall I love having it but in terms of value, I guess it's hard to say it's a must have."

Triumph,2y6dy5,bilged,1 point,Fri Mar 6 23:25:09 2015 UTC,It's better. It's like a dual clutch transmission in a car vs. a fast automatic. Seamless up shifts.
Triumph,2y6dy5,Rausage505,1 point,Sat Mar 7 04:33:13 2015 UTC,"Fraction of a second? Try (on average) 600 microseconds... The MotoGP dudes do it in 300ms. This thing does it in 6ms.  And it used to be off throttle, clutch, gear, clutch, on throttle. Now its throttle, gear-gear-gear...  Even with clutch less, this is still faster because you just stay in it and bang thru the gears.  Or ""bworp, bworp, bworp..."" vs ""bworp-bworp-bworp!!!"""
Triumph,2y6dy5,ctesibius,2,Sat Mar 7 13:03:18 2015 UTC,"300 milliseconds (I think you mean milli not micro) is certainly a fraction of a second! Anyway, it feels like I'm on the quick end of the range. If I was doing a lot of track riding it would be worthwhile but on the street I don't think I'd bother with the expense. The biggest benefit to me seems to be shifting stability ratherthan just speed as clutchless upshifting can still cause a bit of jerkiness if you're shifting mid turn.

Triumph,2y1w5c,deckoturf,2,Thu Mar 5 19:18:44 2015 UTC,"Thruxton owner here, I was in the same boat as you last year. This is my first bike, I am young (22) and i had no idea what i was doing finance wise.   My suggestion to you is Craigslist. You will be able to find great used bikes, especially because you are looking at sport classics. People who buy these bikes buy them because they have a passion for them, they will 99% of the time take great care of them. I bought my Thruxton used with 1500 miles on it for $5600 cash. This is less then half what i would have paid out the door at a dealership. The only issue with the bike was a dirty set of carbs from being garaged for the winter, a simple cleaning fixed this within a few hours.    part of the reason is to establish some legitimate credit   From first hand experience, let me tell you. This is the wrong approach to building credit... learned that the hard way with my car.   since I'm young and have no experience they will try to take advantage of me   Yes they will, Dealers keep their lights on by preying on inexperienced buyers. They know that a person walking into the shop either does not want to put in the effort to look used and would prefer instant gratification, or they are wealthier and wanting the ""first and only owner"" badge.   Again, Please Please Look at the used market, especially with this being your first bike and low on funds."
Triumph,2y1w5c,Dang_Yankee,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:39:39 2015 UTC,"You are right in that dealers will see a young inexperienced buyer as a big potential profit, but you are wrong by saying that preying on inexperienced buyers is what ""keeps their lights on"". The profit on these $10,000 toys is so little, and theres so much competition from other dealerships, that they often sell for just over the invoice price. Most of the money from motorcycle or even car dealerships is their service center."
Triumph,2y1w5c,BfuckinA,1 point,Thu Mar 5 21:08:26 2015 UTC,My funds are not necessarily low. But why would you avoid taking out the loan to build credit? I know I can afford it and I know I'm going to be able to make the payments.
Triumph,2y1w5c,aDDnTN,1 point,Fri Mar 6 02:23:21 2015 UTC,"Go to /r/personalfinance to learn more about how getting a loan for a car or luxury item isn't worth the cost of paying interest for the ""boost"" in credit.  Personally, i know only a fool would finance a new bike from a dealer let alone on their first bike. I have no doubt that you would come to regret that transaction.  You will be able to afford it when you can buy it out right.   Delaying payment for instant gratification is a common mistake that people make. Payments are a waste of your money and limit your future financial options. You don't even know that you will enjoy riding yet.   Just buy a used bike online.  Don't buy the farm, when you can just buy what you need today."
Triumph,2y1w5c,BfuckinA,2,Sat Mar 7 17:27:35 2015 UTC,"It seems like every body here is telling you to not buy from a dealership, or to buy used. Im just gonna answer your question with an answer.   I was in your exact same position last year. I was 23 years old, and buying a brand new thruxton because I was looking to build my credit, and because it had been my dream bike for a long time. The first quote the dealer gave me for the out the door price (total price paid after all taxes and fees included) was something like $10,800. This was in Orange County CA so taxes are higher than most places in the country.   I went home, called the next triumph dealer that was closest to me, and the conversation went something like this, ""Hey I just stopped by Triumph of newport beach, they quoted me at 10,800 out the door can you guys beat that?""  They gave me a lower number so I called Newport Beach back. ""hey Triumph of riverside quoted me at 10,500, can you guys beat that?""  call riverside back with the counter offer. Continued this process for 3 or 4 more calls to each dealership, getting them to compete. Eventually riverside gave me a quote of 9500 out the door. I called the other dealership back and told them the price, and they said 9500 was the lowest they could go, and if riverside could do any better then i should go to them. I went to newport beach because it was the same price and closer to my house. The key to getting the best deal is talking to two different dealerships and getting them to compete for your business. Eventually they will find the bottom price for you. Make sure you negotiate with the OUT THE DOOR price, so that way there is no surprise taxes or fees at the end of the deal. The price of the bike is only the first part, next is the financing.  Make sure that you have already tried contacting credit unions to see what kind of rates they will give you on a new bike. If you can get a relative to co sign, do that. It will get you a better rate. Next is make sure you put money down! Not only will this give you a better rate and monthly payment, but it will make it less likely that you end up in a position where you owe more money than the bike is worth.   Finally, if you do not already have an insurance provider, make sure you do some shopping before you go to the dealership. Owning insurance is part of the deal for financing the bike, and they will not give you a good deal. Shop for insurance first. Im in a hurry so I apologize for formatting and what not. PM me if you have any more questions, I'll be happy to help."
Triumph,2y1w5c,BfuckinA,1 point,Thu Mar 5 21:05:16 2015 UTC,Thanks so much man! I wasn't aware that the insurance was part of the financing. Also i do not think I have another Triumph dealer around Boston... I'll look at some of the used bikes though and see if I can leverage the price that way.
Triumph,2y1w5c,mancubuss,2,Fri Mar 6 02:26:25 2015 UTC,"No leveraging with a used bike won't work. It's like comparing apples to oranges. Find the next closest dealership to you. Even if you don't wanna drive over there to pick up the bike, you need to use their offers to bring down the Boston dealership. I'll save you hundreds, maybe over a thousand dollars"
Triumph,2y1w5c,BfuckinA,1 point,Fri Mar 6 04:46:11 2015 UTC,"that's a good deal. I had a hookup at the dealership and my new scrambler was 9,500 out the door. Only upside was I didnt have to haggle.  Didn't realize the feight charge was $1500"
Triumph,2y1w5c,coocha,1 point,Fri Mar 6 22:46:52 2015 UTC,"God damn thats an enormous freight charge. So even with the 1500 freight charge you were still 9500 otd? In my experience working in dealerships, even the freight charges can be negotiated. I feel like this a good time to share one of my favorite little sales stories.  I used to sell trailers and motorhomes in CA and AZ, and when I started there was an older salesmen who was kind enough to take me under his wing and let me watch his process of closing a deal. Well basically, at the end of the deal, one of the little fees we tacked on was called a PDI. A PDI was the state mandated process of going through the vehicle and ensuring that we sold you a safe product. We explained this as something that we cannot leave out of the deal legally, and most customers accepted this fact and moved on. Except for one old man buying a trailer, who haggled us down to invoice on the thing. We were almost done with the deal, and the customer said ""$999 for this PDI thing is too damn high. If you figure out how to cut this down then we have a deal."" So the senior salesman walks into the office, talks to the manager and comes back with a $499 PDI. He explains this to the customer and the customer says ""That's great news, but I gotta ask. You said this was to ensure the safe working condition of our RV, so whats the difference between the $999 and the $499 PDI?"" The salesman looks him right in the eye with a straight face and says, ""Oh, about five hundred dollars."" Basically the salesman was shooting straight and saying ""were doing the damn thing no matter what you pay for it""  tl;dr: in my sales experience, damn near everything is negotiable. Even the little fees.  Apologies for formatting I don't really post much."
Triumph,2y1w5c,Rausage505,2,Sun Mar 8 22:48:43 2015 UTC,"The 'Four Squares Method' is commonly used in $tealerships to demonstrate how they adjust interest rates and total loan amount to lower monthly payments.  Unless you get a very low fixed APR (usually provided by the manufacturer, through the dealership), I would STRONGLY recommend that you finance through a credit union.  Typically much better interest rates, much fairer terms and conditions, etc.  I've bought two bikes, and paid for repairs to a third, using loans exclusively from my credit union.  My credit is stellar, and having perfect payment history on those loans definitely helped.  EDIT: Triumph is offering a $500 credit toward Triumph branded parts and accessories this year.  Keep that in mind: if they offer it like some kind of bonus, well they're just buttering you up, because that $500 is offered to everyone, it's nothing special.  I wouldn't consider it to be a selling/negotiation point."
Triumph,2y1w5c,coocha,4,Thu Mar 5 19:22:46 2015 UTC,"THIS. Credit Unions are your friend.  Being that this is your first bike, you probably shouldn't buy new. That's a whole lot of new shiny parts that will get busted when you drop it. You don't want what its worth to be less than what you owe. Take the MSF, get something cheap, get all the ""noob"" out of your system, THEN go buy the shiny new Triumph. My $.02..."
Triumph,2y1w5c,Rausage505,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:13:04 2015 UTC,"Yup.  If I could do it all again, I'd have bought older and smaller for my first bike.  Like a DRZ-400 or KLR 250.  Triumphs are not easy on the wallet when you bin them, and my 900 was a way too much bike to learn on.   Smaller parallel twins and thumpers are awesome!"
Triumph,2y1w5c,aDDnTN,3,Thu Mar 5 20:57:37 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  I saved all my pennies and paid $2400 for an SV650, rode it for 4 seasons, and sold it for $2000. It was a perfect bike to learn on, fast enough that it wasn't a chump, but not so fast that you're doing 80 in first. And v-twin torque is great for learning!  The GF has a Ninja 250R, and that bike is SUPER fun times as well!  Heck, I STILL kinda want a DRZ to hoon around on..."

Triumph,2y1w5c,coocha,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:06:08 2015 UTC,"Uh yeah. That's a bit of a handful for a new rider. The low prices draw in new riders, but hc3s are pretty torquey for a noob. IMO, the clipons don't help with the top heavy nature, make the bike difficult to turn in.  What happened to it? Did the pods work out okay?"
Triumph,2y1w5c,aDDnTN,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:11:53 2015 UTC,"By the time I cafe'd it, I had a few years of experience on it.  I went from the stock bars to Renthal dirt bars, and then to the clip-ons.  The front end and rims all came from a Daytona 955i.  Sketchy lower back said ""you're an idiot"" so I traded it for the Sprint with some cash on top.  I miss the aesthetics of the Tbird, but the Sprint is so much more versatile.  I put a lot more seat time in now.  The pods worked fine.  I kept the stock pilot jets and got slightly larger main jets.  There's a catch with the carb bank breather hoses; if they're out in the turbulent air (highway speeds), there's a loss of power at 5k or so.  So tucking them up in the tank cavity fixed that and it ran as good as ever.  The bike handled a lot differently with the shorter front geometry, but it wasn't bad.  More flickable, which was neat."
Triumph,2y1w5c,coocha,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:31:48 2015 UTC,"I thought the flat spot at 5k was the nature of the epa friendly f/a ratio and the lower state of tune?  I missed the front end swap, but i bet the renthals were nice.  Does the sprint feel bigger? Is the wheelbase longer? How is the walking turn radius? The 1050 seems like a bigger bike overall than the hc3s."
Triumph,2y1w5c,aDDnTN,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:52:51 2015 UTC,"The Sprint is definitely bigger!  I'm not a huge dude, so I have to be very careful to keep my balance when manhandling it in driveways and parking lots.  Walking turn radius is at least a US lane; I've gotten good at multi-point turns :P  The longer wheelbase helps soften out the ride at high speeds as intended, but it's not noticable or problematic in the twisties.  It's a big bike, but that's what helps make it a good touring platform.  Comfortable power!"

Triumph,2xyown,Zlator,4,Wed Mar 4 23:48:49 2015 UTC,"Google and check out TuneECU, I reflash the ecu all the time on my Tiger. I don't know if it will work with a Thruxton but the site should tell you. Installing the exhaust is super easy if you do it yourself, $55 for the reflash is reasonable. A half hours' labour would come to that, too bad they don't charge per minute. :)"
Triumph,2xyown,Lose_Loose,2,Thu Mar 5 00:44:02 2015 UTC,"Okay so it seems that I was completely delusional on what I envisioned the reflash being.  I thought that I read somewhere that people were paying $10-15 for a OTS map.  This puts me more at ease with the cost.  All things considered, I would be getting the exhaust installed for the same price as ordering from BC sans install and reflash."
Triumph,2xyown,rottenpossum,3,Thu Mar 5 01:43:41 2015 UTC,"Are you planning to install the exhaust on your own? If they are giving you a good deal on the hardware, it's only fair to let them recuperate some of the cost on install."
Triumph,2xyown,cup-o-farts,2,Thu Mar 5 00:39:38 2015 UTC,"I can go either way.  I'm mechanically inclined enough to do the install and retune myself, but I could let someone else do it if the price is right.  Your comment on the deal holds a lot of meaning now that you mention it."

Triumph,2xyown,Rausage505,2,Thu Mar 5 00:55:04 2015 UTC,"You can easily flash it yourself, for under $20. And that cost will be your cable to connect TuneECU to the bike, see http://www.lonelec.co.uk for a known good cable. Always assuming your bike is actually of such a vintage that TuneECU won't turn it into a giant paperweight, TuneECU.com has lists of which bikes can and cannot be remapped.  The 2010 Thruxton should work.   Or better yet, get a Bluetooth adapter instead of a cable and buy TuneECU for Android if you have an Android device. You can then get lots of fun info out of the bike as you run it.   http://www.triumphrat.net would be a good place to talk TuneECU.  But yes, the process takes time. You have to first connect the computer to the bike, then upload the new map into the ECU (this can take many minutes), then do a reset of the adaptations (the ECU is a learning computer that constantly tracks what your engine is doing and adjusts - with new hardware you want it to forget all that and start over) and then run the bike for 15-some minutes on idle without touching the throttle while it does just that.  So $55 to do the work isn't a ripoff, it's probably realistic if you look at the time involved. Personally I'd pay the $100. If they screw up the map upload they get to fix it on their dime ;)"

My tanks were redone and you can view them here  Funny, I thought I purchased a good bike.  I ran it for most of the summer and then started fixing a leaky carb which lead to the bike down to the frame.    Don Hutchinson (who did the tank) said it was one of the worst tanks he's had the pleasure to work on.    Gate City that did the engine for me said it was a good thing I brought it in.  Basically it goes to show that you just can't tell until you start digging.  I'm happy to get it all done and I can't wait to have it all together this summer and riding up to the Laconia Bike Rally with it (New Hampshire).  Good luck with the restoration!!!  I probably don't have much to offer for advice, but I'm far enough along that I do know where I went wrong.  Ask away if you have any questions."

It was his first bike back in the day and it sat in my uncles basement for about 25 years (a bit after I was born, I guess).   So, in short, after cleaning it up and fixing a few things, we tore it down to find out what was up with 3rd gear, and decided to have the motor professionally redone (Classic Cycles of Frenchtown NJ) and we'd do the rest.   Frames done, engines done, and now the panels are done!  Btw, those look awesome! I was gonna buy paint from Hutchinson, but picked out these colors from a local shop. Cadilliac Glacier Gold Pearl, and Jaguar Midiera Mica (I think) red metallic. Painted the badges with the pearl, as well.  Thanks for lookin!

Triumph,2xpckq,LaoFuSi,1 point,Wed Mar 4 18:43:01 2015 UTC,"After all the research and help from everyone, im close to making my decision. One step im a little confused about is the Air box mod. If i remove my airbox baffle and get the TTP breath, do I still need to get my airbox removed? Or If i remove my airbox, do I still need the TTP Breath? I see people with variants of this step, any pros/cons?"
Triumph,2xpckq,ccosby,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:40:50 2015 UTC,"if you remove the airbox completely, I think you have to get the air pods as opposed to the filter. The airbox baffle lives in the airbox and is a flat plastic piece that slides out of the airbox. If you remove the airbox, you won't need the TTP breathe, because the breathe mounts onto the airbox. I'm not exactly sure of the pros/cons of either or. I think something about high end power or low-mid level torque?  So you either keep the airbox, slide the baffle out, and get the TTP breathe and DNA filter.  -or-  Remove the airbox and use air pods, with no TTP breathe."

It helps especially since BC airbox removal kit is out of stock till April, i might just go for baffle removal, TTP breathe and DNA filter. I just wish I was more educated in the pros and cons.

Triumph,2xpckq,aDDnTN,2,Mon Mar 2 20:18:58 2015 UTC,"First using tune ecu you can apply the arrow tune yourself. Just need to buy the 20 some dollar cable.   Second TTP and I want to say Triumph Performance USA have said on the fuel injected models you gain like 1 hp by removing the air box vs removing the baffle in the airbox and using a higher flow intake(like TTP's breathe).  I can't speak for the BC kit but I can speak for the TTP stuff. I personally went with the arrow 2-2, removed the o2 sensors(which the TTP tune doesn't use), removed the secondary ai(which drove me nuts), removed the airbox baffle, installed the breathe, and I also removed the baffles from the arrow because why not. The improvement was very noticeable. I will say I did the secondary ai removal first which really helped with how the bike felt as you let off the throttle and did most of the rest all at once. I'd recommend the setup to pretty much everyone. I can't speak for the BC exhaust but I haven't heard anything bad about them. Bunch of people on the triumphrat forums seem to be happy."

Triumph,2xhczg,xtrategist,2,Sun Mar 1 00:53:52 2015 UTC,All the detailed info you need from http://www.triumphrat.net/ecm-and-fi-tuning-help-tips-and-tricks/ and http://www.triumphrat.net/twins-technical-talk/  Triumph Twin power are the kings on tuning.  I bought my cable from them to ensure it's all good.  http://www.triumphtwinpower.com/ttp-obd-2-usb-cable.php.. You can also buy tunes for specific installed mods http://www.triumphtwinpower.com/bonneville-t100-efi-tunes.php  You can get all the different OEM tunes for free from http://www.tuneecu.com/Twin_OEM_Tune_list.html.  I am still under warranty so just loaded the arrow 2-2 tune in for my BC sleepers and combined with the AI-removal everything seems sweet.  The arrow tune you already have may be OK but the TTP tune 11 (I think) may give you a bit more power.  TriumphRat would be the place to read up.  The mods and setup you are doing are quite common so there would be those exact examples there somewhere.

Triumph,2xdqlt,CongratsOnYourBike,1 point,Sat Feb 28 13:10:02 2015 UTC,"Quite easy. You'll need to download the instructions from triumphinstructions.com, as they are not included in the boxes with the parts themselves.  The belly pan is much easier to install with a second person to help support one end.  With the flyscreen, just read the instructions carefully. The only thing that I had difficulty with was there is one connector piece for the data cable that connects the instrument panel. It's a pretty tight fit to get it back in (which is a good thing). Don't be afraid to put extra pressure on it to make sure that it's seated back in."

Triumph,2x8h0u,igotalotofrice,3,Fri Feb 27 01:23:33 2015 UTC,"This bike is built for Battle of the Twins, which is open to any air cooled twin. You are allowed unlimited modifications, but it must remain normally aspirated. The whole purpose of this exercise is to beat the air cooled Ducatis with a Triumph. Most of the Ducs on the grid are 1000-1200cc. This motor can hang with them. The Ducatis have a better chassis, and then there is the fact that the rider is 80% of the equation. On a drag strip this thing could probably beat up on a 900 monster all day. You could also buy two of those Ducatis (used) for the amount of money that has been spent on the Triumph. We are Triumph people so this is not the first Triumph we have ""over"" done."
Triumph,2x8h0u,texasshitty,1 point,Fri Feb 27 01:30:10 2015 UTC,"I should mention that an 865cc Triumph is a great bike. I have been racing Thruxton for two years and won the national championship both times. That bike is a 2012 EFI model with the Arrow scrambler pipe and a power commander. The rules make you keep it pretty stock. I hammer on it all the time, crash the shit out of it, and it keeps going. They are not superbikes but they are great bikes. Especially for an around town ride. I put the lights on the Thruxton sometimes and putt around."

Triumph,2x5o0i,Indreju,3,Wed Feb 25 21:26:04 2015 UTC,"thruxton is too heavy to really throw it around, but can handle beautifully in long sweeping corners. The bike has wooden brakes and weighs a lot. The power is not really there, but what it does have is smooth as butter."
Triumph,2x5o0i,libertygeared,3,Wed Feb 25 21:36:23 2015 UTC,"I love my 13 Striple R. It's the perfect twisty backroads companion, IMO. If you're looking for a bit more of a commuter/ day trip bike, the Thruxton might be a little better suited for you, but it sounds like you're more of street bike kinda person. One thing you'll probably notice immediately upon sitting on a Street or Speed is the upright position. It's much easier to cruise all day on a Striple than on a proper streetbike, but you still have a decent heap of power and responsiveness below you."
Triumph,2x5o0i,ElgaemoT,3,Wed Feb 25 21:55:13 2015 UTC,"I bought a 2014 STR a year ago and a few weeks later my brother bought a Thruxton. I've ridden both of them plenty since we've got them and can give you some thoughts I have.  As for my STR, I love it. It's powerful, comfortable, beautiful, and is a blast to ride. You are sitting rather upright but I've upgraded the handlebars so I've got a bit more lean and less wind in my face. Off the line, it's great and leaves my brothers thruxton in the dust.  The thruxton is also great, however. I definitely don't think it's as comfortable for longer rides due to how much of the weight falls on my wrists and you're more laying down. Some people like it, I'm not a big fan. In the looks department its great too, and with some aftermarket pipes she sounds good too.  All in all, you can't go wrong whatever you choose. It kind of depends what you're looking for. I'm partial to my STR(GrayStreet) and wouldn't trade her for a thing. I'm sure my brother feels the same way about his Thruxton(Redline)"
Triumph,2x5o0i,3rdFloorChair29,2,Fri Feb 27 01:37:19 2015 UTC,"One looks great but handles only so-so and has pretty anemic power by comparison. The other is one of the most fun bikes on the market, but it doesn't have that iconic look. Though it has an iconic look of its own, I guess.  Bottom line is that the Striple is by far the better motorcycle, but if you are willing to give up some performance (and the Thruxton isn't slow) for looks that's a valid trade-off. You can really go to work on the Thruxton and make it your own, as well, for fun,  the Striple is kind of complete as it is. Really up to you.  Here's just one source for cafe racer stuff for the Thruxton: http://www.dimecitycycles.com/motorcycle-parts/triumph-motorcycle-parts/vintage-modern-parts-for-triumph-cafe-racers.html  Customizing, tweaking, and replacing parts can be hugely fun, and it can also put quite an on-going dent in the pocket book. But after all that you'll have a truly unique bike set up exactly as you want to, and you can just keep going and tweaking in perpetuity, almost.   Even on my bike I do some fun project in the winter and tweak and fix, and mine doesn't have a fraction of the custom parts available for the Thruxton."
Triumph,2x5o0i,cr0ft,1 point,Thu Feb 26 07:14:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the replies in general.  I was a bit surprised that it seemed to be most people almost don't like the Thruxton just for performance reasons.  And I definitely understand that they're totally different bikes.  Just happen to really like them both and don't have a good way to decide.  At any rate, thank you everyone.  And thanks /u/cr0ft for the Thruxton link."
Triumph,2x5o0i,cr0ft,2,Thu Feb 26 15:14:20 2015 UTC,"Motorcycle design has proceeded quite a ways beyond what the Thruxton is now - frame design, suspension design etc have all taken leaps, and much of that is in the Striple. Monoshock instead of dual shocks, etc, and the triple engine is more powerful even though it is lower displacement.   The triple is just a fantastic fun canyon carver. It's totally impractical, but fun is fun. Which is why it's received nearly universal praise and remains popular.   The Thruxton is iconic, but the engine is lower power and has a more laid-back profile; 68 hp is nothing to sneeze at, but the Street Triple has 129, I believe. The difference is... pretty dramatic. Plus that the Triple handles beautifully out of the box. The Thruxton probably has all the issues of the new Bonneville, like harsh suspension that needs replacing to get everything out of the bike, etc.   As I said - the Triple is good to go right out of the package. The Thruxton is plenty usable right out of the gates, but modifying and improving really pays dividends and it can be a lot of fun.  In theory you should be able to make it into a monster if you want, I know Carpenter Racing offers a 100hp tuning kit for it. Plus all the ways you can alter and improve its looks and function.   Personally I'd be inclined to go with the Thruxton, just because it is iconic, and because it can be an on-going project beyond just being a fun ride. But it's entirely up to what you want to do."
Triumph,2x5o0i,Danino1987,2,Fri Feb 27 07:00:53 2015 UTC,"Confirmed scheduling both test rides (and was convinced to try a non-Triumph bike as well) for this Saturday.  The customization and building idea of the Thruxton has some great appeal.    I also think I'd rather have a teak sailing yacht over a speedboat, but kind of want both.  Same goes for motorcycles.  Was convinced a while ago the appropriate number of Motorcycles to own is: One more."
Triumph,2x5o0i,PloppyPoops,1 point,Fri Feb 27 20:43:43 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. By my nature I'm more of supersport kind of guy, but I ended up buying a used Bonneville. I absolutely love it! Sure, most bikes in my area smoke me, but like cr0ft said, there is an iconic look to the thruxton. I get more people praising my bike, to which I've done a little cafe work to, than my buddies that shoot passed me. I still want a Daytona 675R though like it's the antidote. One more is the right amount in my book. Good luck with the hunt!  Edit: If you do get the Thruxton and want to tweak it, I highly reccomend an Arrow exhaust and LSL parts. Both are high quality, though LSL is a german company and getting parts my take some time depending on the local dealer's inventory. I haven't had issue with waits longer than 2 weeks though."
Triumph,2x5o0i,PloppyPoops,1 point,Fri Feb 27 22:35:44 2015 UTC,"How did your test ride go? I just bought a Thruxton last week and couldn't be happier (coming off a SV650). Sure it's not a speed demon but it's plenty enough for me. Already getting ready for some modifications, predator exhaust being the first. That's half the fun! Interested to know what you're thing after testing both bikes out. The striple was definitely on my radar but I just wanted something laid back. Never had the opportunity to take one for a test ride though, I wonder if that could have swayed my opinion?"
Triumph,2x5o0i,professorsyr,2,Sun Mar 1 02:07:38 2015 UTC,"Test ride for both of them went very well, didn't manage to get in to test ride the non-Triumph motorcycles (BMW R NineT and S1000R -- See a theme on bike styles?).  Much as I expected the bikes are very different but very nice in different ways.  I certainly didn't come to a decision just yet, but already have plans to test ride them both again next weekend and try and decide then.  Over all though, here were my thoughts:  Street Triple R  Tested this one first, and all around this is just an amazing motorcycle.  Very upright riding position, feels extremely well balanced and light underneath me.  The clutch is remarkably smooth, the power band is amazing and the sound on the bike is just impressive.  To me, the biggests pros for this bike were that it reminded me a ton of my R6 in engine and handling, it would be a very confidence building bike to ride again, and I can easily see this being a bike I'd keep for years.  The cons, such as they are, I am not a huge fan of the rear view mirrors (I get they're replaceable) and the seating position is such that I basically was never looking at the instrument cluster.  Thruxton  I was genuinely surprised by just how much heavier the bike felt when first getting on.  Was also more the 'traditional' sports riding position, which I found shocking for some reason because in my head it wasn't going to be as leaned over as I was while actually riding.  There was something about riding it that just felt amazing though, between the engine feel being vastly different and the general feel of the bike, it was just very nice.  I do oddly feel like I would be less inclined to ride this bike for as long in a single sitting, and I don't know why exactly, as I would have thought it the other way around before the test ride.  I definitely see the Thruxton more as a day use / cruising around town or maybe a single long day ride.  But the Triple I could see taking on a weekend trips or longer.  Keeping with /u/cr0ft's analogy of boats, the Thruxton is the Wood Cabin Cruiser vs the fiber glass speed boat of the Street Triple.  I just find it odd that the in my head I'm more likely to spend more time in the Striple.  Right now I'm still kind of at a loss.  I'll test ride the two other bikes this weekend and then the Triumphs again.  Hopefully will have an idea and a new bike by the end of the next week or two."

The Street is a naked mid glass sportbike and the Thruxton is a (fuck cafe racer) transport bike. It's pretty, but thats about it.    The Street Triple is going to be way more capable of chancing apexes and hooning, while at the same time commuting and going to the grocery store.    The Thruxton, unless modified will not be good at hooning and acting like a lad in the twisties.    Both are brilliant bikes, but both are totally and completely different breeds of motorcycle."

Triumph,2wob3m,AbandonedLogic,2,Sun Feb 22 15:00:54 2015 UTC,riding a triumph i feel like im in a whole different class of rider. this video reaffirms my feelings.
Triumph,2wob3m,BeastofamaN,4,Sat Feb 21 20:40:22 2015 UTC,"The ""class of rider"" I imagine from your simple post is a pretentious poser with a superiority complex.  Most often found owning a Ducati, but fairly common with a Triumph.  The class of rider that watches some rugged dude in a hyper-stylized, cliche internet video and gets a hard-on because they think that's how all their friends and family view them now that they also ride a Triumph.  Meanwhile there's a beautiful bike sitting neglected in a dark, cold garage somewhere with chicken strips and a broken heart because it will never know what it's like to actually have adventures or be ridden on the ragged edge.  It'll be stared at, photographed, admired, talked about over lattes, maybe ridden 1000km a year between coffee shops.  But it lives a life of unfulfilled potential.  It's a Thoroughbred destined to a life giving pony rides at children's parties.  Deep down this bike knows a dark secret.  It knows its real raison d'être is simply to be the justification that its owner will use so they can show internet videos like this to all their friends and bask in the glorious smugness of the thought; ""This is me.  This is the class of rider I am"".  It's not you.  Not even the dude in the video is the class of rider you imagine.  Look at his riding.  He's stiff-armed, wooden, crossed-up.  He was probably hired because of his beard.  The video is the product of a marketing department.  Any illusion of ""soul"" is just that; an illusion.  And you're not just swallowing it hook, line, and sinker.  But your regurgitating it to others.  If you want to live this life, that's great.  Go and live it.  Make it your own story.  Make it real.  But it's not the badge on your fuel tank or watching a video on the internet that determines the class of rider you are.  What you do on your bike is the only thing that counts, and you don't need a Triumph for that."

Triumph,2wj1h2,dev10,2,Fri Feb 20 08:02:57 2015 UTC,Would be interested in finding out the real world differences between the 2012 and 2013 models.  Recently bought a 2012 street triple and absolutely love it. So much so I would consider upgrading to the updated 2013 on model soon if it was a big enough step up.  Would be great to hear from anyone who has ridden both.
Triumph,2wj1h2,MrRicey,2,Fri Feb 20 11:05:52 2015 UTC,"I too own a 2012 Streety, but have not ridden a '13. From what I've heard, the '12 has more torque, but has a slightly worse MPG. So if you commute a lot on your bike, maybe upgrade. But otherwise the two bikes are still pretty much the same. Oh, and the low mounted exhaust. (Which I don't like)"
Triumph,2wj1h2,Zkv,3,Sat Feb 21 01:04:46 2015 UTC,It feels torquier because it's down a tooth on the front sprocket. It just has better mechanical advantage. Sprockets cost about $25 bucks and are easy to swap.

Triumph,2wj1h2,MrRicey,2,Mon Feb 23 08:47:13 2015 UTC,"The '13+ has an all new frame and swingarm, better mass centralization and weight distribution. It is also 13 pounds lighter, new steering geometry,  and low mount exhaust instead of underseat exhaust.   Engine is exactly the same but has a longer 1st gear and ECU tune resulting in an increase in Fuel economy from 61 to 68mpg at 50mph.   Basically, the bike is less of a hooligan, better to commute with, just as fast, but handles even better.   I've ridden an old one and own a '14. Lots to love about both. My bike feels more refined and handles better, but the old one felt a little bit more raw (which is awesome)"
Triumph,2wj1h2,FullOppositeLock,1 point,Sun Feb 22 23:55:31 2015 UTC,To me it sounds like the slight upgrades are noticable but not worth the hassle of selling then paying an extra 1000 or so to upgrade. Maybe i'll give it a year and see whats around then.

Triumph,2wc6df,G-wow,3,Thu Feb 19 05:36:17 2015 UTC,"""Frame sliders"" are for spar-framed bikes (like most modern sports and standards). your thruxton has a steel backbone and engine support straps, so you need Crash Bars, aka Engine Guards.   Thread on Truimphrat.net/TwinsTalk about Crash Bars on the Modern Classic Twins  SW Motech Crashbars on NewBonneville.com  They do make frame sliders for your bike so here's some links:  http://www.triumphrat.net/club-cafe/255802-thruxton-frame-sliders-recommendation.html  http://www.triumphrat.net/club-cafe/221194-frame-sliders-for-thruxtons.html  imo, these won't protect as well as the crash bars and will put your side covers at risk as well as the delicate aluminum of your engine block. Crashbars will bolt onto your steel engine support straps, which are much more durable than your aluminum engine or SS cover bolts."
Triumph,2wc6df,aDDnTN,2,Wed Feb 18 19:49:51 2015 UTC,"I have the Rentec Engine Guard on my Bonneville SE which are covered on that first link. The install was a little bit of a pain because some of the bolts were hard to access/line up. It was slightly time consuming, but I like the overall look.  Haven't had to test them yet, which is good... Hopefully never will.    http://www.newbonneville.com/html/renntec_engine_guard.html"
Triumph,2wc6df,happy_jappy,0,Wed Feb 18 20:11:32 2015 UTC,i like that one! that third leg probably gives it a lot more strength. is it bolted in the back to the other side or to a piece of frame?
Triumph,2wc6df,aDDnTN,1 point,Wed Feb 18 20:13:15 2015 UTC,"If I recall the front upper connects to the front engine mount bolt. They provide a replacement, slightly longer bolt. The rear upper goes through the gap and connects to itself, but not to the frame. On the underside it attaches to a bracket which also has two loops that go over each of the exhaust pipes. For those with aftermarket exhaust setups, not just cans, this might be of concern. So realistically it is primarily held on with the bolt from the front engine mount and the exhaust.   I should take it back that I've never tested them. Technically I tipped my bike at 0 mph due to stupidity. The bars did their job and protected the engine casing. I did end up scuffing an almost non-visible portion of the rentec bars down low, the left side stock mirror, and worst of all, one of the BC Predators."

Triumph,2waxpd,baldheadslick,3,Wed Feb 18 11:52:28 2015 UTC,"There are specific procedures for setting your suspension sag. You'll get best comfort and best handling with the right setting, if you set them too soft they'll bottom out and bounce off the rubber spacer which will threaten to launch you from your seat, and too hard and they won't have the appropriate travel.  Start with a google and read, is my suggestion, or find a suspension specialist near you.   Here's a good article: http://www.sportrider.com/suspension-setup-guide  More of them by browsing along from here:  https://www.google.com/search?q=adjusting+motorcycle+suspension+sag  Having your suspension set right is hugely important, as are things like tire pressure. Most riders are inexcusably sloppy with that, which causes accelerated tire wear and bad grip/comfort."
Triumph,2waxpd,cr0ft,2,Wed Feb 18 13:34:08 2015 UTC,I have a Street Triple but not an R. Is there any way at all for me to adjust suspension or go somewhere to have it adjusted? I feel like it is set too soft.
Triumph,2waxpd,pondiki,2,Wed Feb 18 17:55:07 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, there's not much that can be done on a non-adjustable suspension. I know that the non-R Street can set both front and rear pre-load, but that's about it. The next thing would be changing springs to match your weight. There are sites that can tell you the correct spring rate that you'd need for your weight and that could help the bike feel better. However, the internals would still be the same so that feeling of softness might not go away."
Triumph,2waxpd,TKM_PT,2,Wed Feb 18 23:41:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not really familiar with the suspension setup on them, but there is always the option to simply switch out the budget shock absorber with a quality component that has both preload adjustment and damping adjustment. It doesn't have to get super pricey, either, though it's certainly in the hundreds of dollars. It can pay big dividends in comfort and handling, though.   Also, shocks wear out too over time, on older bikes it may be an even bigger revelation. Yours is hardly ancient but still.  Lots of potential choices, most manufacturers should make ones that fit the Striple - http://www.hagon-shocks.co.uk/  http://www.ikonsuspension.com/  http://www.ricorshocks.com http://www.ohlinsusa.com/ etc just of the top of my head/bookmark list.  Any shock should, as /u/TKM_PT points out, have preload adjustment so you can firm the spring up, at least, even if you can't adjust how damping happens."
Triumph,2waxpd,cr0ft,2,Thu Feb 19 07:18:59 2015 UTC,"so RaceTech says you're close on spring rate. I wouldn't change the rear shock spring (you're closer than their springs can get you), but the front is a bit soft. For sure follow /u/cr0ft 's advice and set the sag properly. You need a buddy to help. Here's a video.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3flKxf41U  for clickers, there should be recommendations in your owner's manual for default settings. i'd start with those. Compression will slow the rate at which the wheel comes towards you (fork or shock gets shorter). rebound is how the fork extends again. You want just enough compression that the bike doesn't bottom over BIG bumps or hard braking, and the rebound to be just enough to keep the bike from bouncing when it extends again.   You can bounce on the bike with it stationary, push down hard and release. the bike should fully extend to top out and settle. it shouldn't bounce a bunch of times.  Typically we record our settings from turns (or clicks) from full in. before you start messing with anything, record where it is now. turn the adjuster and count until it stops (don't keep turning hard after it stops!). do this for compression (bottom of fork) and rebound (top of fork). no matter what happens you can always set back to where it is now, so don't be scared to turn them and play with settings.  I'd also recommend trying to see if there's any suspension tuners in your area. They'll typically do a sag and clicker setup for somewhere in the $50 range.  Also, depending on mileage it may be time for those forks and shock to be serviced. i'd for sure service them before trying to find settings, because if the bike has 10k miles on it the suspension fluid is pretty broken down and full of debris. get em freshened up and i bet the tuner will throw in the setup after for free. ;)  FRONT FORK SPRINGS  Recommended Fork Spring Rate: 0.868 kg/mm   Stock Fork Spring Rate: .900 kg/mm(stock)  REAR SHOCK SPRINGS  Recommended Shock Spring Rate: 12.75 kg/mm (use closest available)  Stock Shock Spring Rate: 12.6 kg/mm (stock)"

Triumph,2w82i8,Mitochondria420,8,Tue Feb 17 19:20:15 2015 UTC,"I use an Explorer as my daily ride, and don't have a car. I bought it in May, and have done slightly over 10k miles so far. My intention is to use it as my main transport for 10-20 years.  The engine is a gem. Huge amounts of torque. I never change down to pass, and I can stay in one gear on full throttle from 30-100mph and still have revs in hand. The fuel economy on the standard bike is very good as well.  Handing - also very good. I got the pegs down on the ride back from the dealer without even trying. This is the real charm of a bike of this type - you can throw it from peg to peg like a 250  supermoto.  Comfort - reasonable, but can be made good by setting the seat height adjusters so that the front of the seat is low and the back high. This raises the comfortable range from about 250 miles to 400 miles or so, but it does make the seat slightly loose fore-and-aft. There are aftermarket seats available, but I'm fine with it as it is.  Luggage - I use standard Givi topbox (all the time) and panniers (occasionally). I don't use the ""off road"" styled Givis or the Triumph luggage as they are double-skinned and quite small in capacity.  Noise - this is the main annoyance for me. The standard screen is very noisy. There are several aftermarket cures. I'm 6'1"", and I found a Madstad screen combined with Powerbronze deflectors turned it into the quietest bike I've ridden. Deflectors in this sense are small L-shaped bits of perspex that fasten to the tank and rise vertically in front of the handlebars. The effect is to give roughly the protection of a tourer's half fairing without the weight. It has the bonus that you really hear the exhaust when you wind it on. The disadvantage is that it increases fuel consumption by 10-15%.  Reliability - The engine and shaft drive are bullet proof. There have been some problems on the early models which Triumph have been very good about fixing  at their expense.   A problem with the throttle position sensor which can cause the engine to stop. Fixed by a change to the ECU. Noisy cylinder head on some models. Not many bikes were affected, but many people got their cylinder heads changed anyway. Apparently it doesn't affect reliability, and it is very obvious if you have the problem. Side stand pivot - not sure what the problem is here, but they replace them at the next service. I've not heard of any failing. A failure of the gear position indicator such that it doesn't indicate when you are in neutral.   I think the point here is that it was a completely new engine when it was introduced a couple of years ago. This sort of issue tends to happen with most manufacturers when a new engine is introduced - which is pretty rarely.   They are not big problems and should not affect a new bike. If you are buying second hand, get them to check if any product notices apply.  Service intervals - 10k miles.  Overall, it's an excellent bike. No bike is perfect, and it will depend on what use you put it to, but this one seems to have an unburstable engine, stonking performance, fun handling, and the ability to haul heavy luggage and a passenger to the other side of the planet or just down to the shops. Recommended."
Triumph,2w82i8,ctesibius,1 point,Wed Feb 18 00:24:21 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you for the reply! You sure you don't work for Triumph? :) My commute would be a mix of freeway (70+), stop and go traffic, downtown city streets and parking garages in the future. How do you think it would handle the last 2? I worry about the weight of the bike being a bit higher, even though it weighs about the same as the Shadow I currently own."
Triumph,2w82i8,ctesibius,2,Wed Feb 18 14:18:57 2015 UTC,"I don't work for them, but I've ridden Hinckley Triumphs for about 21 years - a couple of Daytona 1200s, A Daytona T595, a tuned Bonneville, and the Explorer. I think I've done about 160k miles on them. I do ride other makes, but I trust Triumphs for year-round riding.  City streets will be fine, but be careful if you split lanes. The bars are wide and at the right height to hit car mirrors if you get too close.  I'm not sure what your concern is with parking garages?  As with all bikes with powerful engines, the clutch is a bit heavier than for small bikes. I've not seen anyone else worry about it, but I changed the clutch lever to an adjustable dogleg lever to make it easier in stop/go traffic. Nothing unique to the Explorer there - my old BMW R1200S was much worse.  It is a heavy bike, but the only time I notice that is if I've fallen while going cross-country. It's very easy to manoeuvre and to push on foot. What matters is not so much how high the weight is, but how high it is compared with where you contact the bike. Cruisers can be a bit more difficult than people expect because when you shove the side of the bike with your leg, it's low down, so you don't have much leverage."

Apparently the way you adjust the speedometer is to adjust a constant in the computer (set to 1.0 from the factory IIRC).  That same constant is used for the odometer.  As far as I understand it, if you adjust the speedometer one way, you also adjust the odometer in the opposite direction by the same amount.  Knowing this, I decided that it's more important to have an accurate-ish odometer & it's easy enough to do the calculations in my head on the fly for the speedometer.  For my bikes, it's about 10%.  Hopefully someone else can either prove me wrong or provide some reliable sources."

If the Legend is like the other early triples and fours, you have to take the carbs out to change the air filter, so it will be little more work to change the jets then. I assume the TORs already have recommended jets, so you shouldn't need to experiment.  BTW, the advice is that you shouldn't alter the airbox on these models. There's very little power to be gained, and it's easy to upset the carbs."

Triumph,2vrx69,ctesibius,0,Fri Feb 13 21:25:16 2015 UTC,"yeah, the trick is folding the flanges into the airbox. but even then, you still have to pull the covers, the battery, the battery box, the carbs themselves, and hold a bunch of wires out of the way.   CB500 was as easy as popping the seat up, picking up the tray, pull out the old fiter, drop the new one it.  always a bitch to get a bank of carbs out though! doesn't matter what it's on."
Triumph,2vrx69,aDDnTN,2,Fri Feb 13 21:29:40 2015 UTC,"Also if you took it in to a shop, the mechanics didn't always do the job. I had a couple of Daytona 1200s as company cars, so the servicing was paid by my employers - in fact I bought the second one from them. When I changed the filter for the first time myself, it was thick with muck and obviously hadn't been changed."
Triumph,2vrx69,ctesibius,0,Fri Feb 13 21:39:31 2015 UTC,"apparently, the entire airbox was supposed to be swapped out. from what i understand it came with single-use clips holding the two sides together with the filter between. i guess someone had already replaced my screws, because my mech didn't have any trouble getting the box back together or replacing the air filter, but absolutely curse Bloor for not making it easy to go back in. i was getting the carbs cleaned and balanced at the time, so i didn't have to pay a fortune."
Triumph,2vrx69,aDDnTN,1 point,Fri Feb 13 21:45:38 2015 UTC,"Mine has the plastic airbox. It was screwed together rather than clipped, but the same principle - you were supposed to replace the front part of the airbox, into which the paper air filter was fastened. It turned out to be easy to remove the element and replace it with a flat K&N filter. This doesn't upset the carbs if you still use the full airbox. Unfortunately you still have to remove the carbs next time round, so it just saves a bit of money  rather than making the job easier.  One odd feature was that the element isn't as wide as the airbox. It seems to use the same one as for the triple, which seems like an odd choice for a bike which at the time was marketed as the most powerful on the planet. Still, it goes quite well on the track even after 73000 miles. There's one or two things will keep up with it on acceleration out of a corner (GSX1000R, for instance), but nothing that's notably quicker."
Triumph,2vrx69,ctesibius,1 point,Fri Feb 13 21:55:06 2015 UTC,"1) If you're going aftermarket for either aesthetics or performance, you should get 3-into-1 headers.  Cuz they're sexy.  Sexy as hell.  But unfortunately for the T-birds and Legends, there's only one or 2 companies who make them, and last I checked it was spendy. (like a grand)  2) Do you have the TOR (Triumph off-road) cans?  They are a touch louder, but not an obcene amount.  3) Have you looked at triumphrat?  I seem to remember a forum member or two drilling out the baffles on their stock exhaust.  You could check there and see if there are any videos they posted of the resulting sound."
Triumph,2vrx69,coocha,1 point,Fri Feb 13 21:12:35 2015 UTC,"been there done that!  FYI, leaving your silencers off won't really hurt your bike or require rejetting.  i mean, yeah if you wanted to run like that for the long term, a little adjustment might be needed (probably not new jets/pilots/needles though). just a few turns of the air screw to get it back to lean enough. most of the old hat's say that's needed from the OEM settings anyway.  really the only time you need to rejet is if you modify the airbox. definitely needed if you mod the airbox and the exhaust.  fyi, i've got a set of emgo/epco chromed slashcut megaphones that i have no more use for. you pay for shipping and they are yours.   I have given up the rumble for blessed silence and that glorious cam whine. i got a set of cans from a thruxton and got them hacked on. Nice and quiet. Flattened my torque curve a bit (brought up a trough) and reduced the HP dip around 6500, but i might have given up some top end (you can't tell when you roll on, but when you go up against something with HP above 60mph, you can tell it's not there).  FYI, less restrictive exhaust can make more hp but cut the torque. in my case (the opposite), the engine seems to rev happily and enjoys being wound out, so i'm happy. and she can still do the ton. (115 mph is the fastest i've seen on the gauge)  whatever you decide OP, don't drill out your current pipes. just run with the headers when you want to rumble, but stick the pipes on there when you plan to ride further than 20 miles.  if you want the bike to go faster and the gears to last longer, swap your front 17T sprocket for a 19T. imo, this is a worthwhile mod to the 5speed legend. she makes a beastly amount of torque and with the 17T 1st gear is totally useless. with the 19T each gear becomes taller, which moves the top of each gears speed up and makes it need more revs to shift smoothly. 2nd gear is all i need for the twisties. 3rd is all that is needed on country roads. 4th and 5th are for interstate runs.   doing that sprocket swap will take some of your acceleration away though, but these bikes don't like to wheelie with the craptastic 125lb svelte-figure designed OEM suspension setup anyway!  you shouldn't be shifting gears below 4500 rpm anyway! don't lug the girl even if she seems to like it.   PS: wear ear plugs to save your hearing. if you want to go with the TORs let me know and i will help you find info about the best jetting to use. it's all here: http://www.triumphrat.net/hinckley-classic-triples/  EDIT: here's some links to learn about what you are proposing to do. it ain't just increasing the sound. it changes how hard the engine works. for simplicity sake, you can assume that if your induction is stock and your running stock silencers that your exhaust is currently at ""optimum"" for your A/F and timing.  http://www.formula1-dictionary.net/exhaust_road_perf.html  http://www.hotbikeweb.com/tech/exhaustsystembasics"

Triumph,2vpls9,wormsbugs,4,Fri Feb 13 14:01:04 2015 UTC,I have one. Absolutely love it. Have taken it on really long trips with no issues and the case options are great. It is a heavy/big bike so if you are short be sure to try one out first. Comfortable yet fun bike.

Triumph,2vpls9,cryospam,1 point,Fri Feb 13 01:40:41 2015 UTC,"I have a 2013 road version and love it. I'm a tall guy and needed something that fit, but for a normal size person it might be a bit tall or heavy to handle. I know they market it as an adventure bike, but it won't do jack in the dirt without different tires. On the road it's no sportbike, but still a lot of fun to me. The engine is an absolute dream. Some people don't like the Triumph triple whistle note, but it's got a great scream when you rev it. Taken it on a couple longer trips and it's pretty comfortable, the newest model year has cruise control too. Don't get the 'gel' seat, it's somehow harder than the stock seat.   As far as maintenance, no issues for me but I've only got about 4k miles on. Fingers crossed.   Hope that helps."
Triumph,2vpls9,lecodecivil,1 point,Fri Feb 13 02:40:46 2015 UTC,The gel seat is amazing long distance (at least on their other bikes). It gives more support and leaves you with less ass ache after hundreds of miles. It doesn't seem like it would just by feeling it though.

Just checked valves and they were in spec. I haven't had any issues, but there have been some with the idle stepper motor in dusty environments that people say is resolved by cleaning. There were stalling issues in the beginning, but those were resolved with a new tune. If anything, I wish it got better mileage. I average around 40 and get a little under 200 miles a tank. I do a lot of 80MPH highway runs which kills the mileage. You'll also want a better screen if you're doing highway jaunts. I've got a madstad that works great.

I am 6'4"" so the bike's size won't be an issue, in fact, I am looking for a tall bike that I am more comfortable on.  The thing I worry about the most is maintenance.. I saw some of your comments saying that it has some known issues. Is it hard to work on it on your own? I own a Suzuki DRZ400 and do all my own maintenance, but its a japanese bike and the engine is quite simple.  Are parts hard to find in the US/expensive?"
Triumph,2vpls9,Rausage505,2,Fri Feb 13 05:45:26 2015 UTC,"Bikes is bikes is bikes, turning wrenches is pretty much the same (except valve adjustments on Ducati). The dealer network is about as good as any of the Japanese bikes, at least in my neck of the woods... And the stuff on the bike you'd want to be made in Japan, is. Triumph outsources a lot of the electronics to Japanese companies because they do it better than if they did it themselves in Hinkley. Reliability? My Streety has been bulletproof. As far as cost? Its about the same as any bike parts, except that they are high quality, so you get what you pay for (and pay for what you get).  Rode a Tiger 1050 up and down PCH last summer. Awesome bike! DOOO EEEET!!!"
Triumph,2vpls9,Lose_Loose,1 point,Fri Feb 13 13:44:56 2015 UTC,"You're tall at 6'4"", check out the Tiger 1050, it may fit you better. Owning a Triumph is different than owning Japanese, hard to describe, just different. You need to pay attention to the bike, learn to do some maintenance, but not a lot. The only issue I had was bolts on an engine case backed out a little and a little oil seeped out. Half turns on all the bolts fixed it. The 800 is next gen from the 1050, the only issue I heard about with the 800 was an engine gasket that would leak, easily fixed by a Triumph mechanic. Other than that, these engines are bulletproof."

Triumph,2vqisv,Galmar_StoneFist,5,Fri Feb 13 05:08:40 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend not doing the airbox removal mod. Unless you never expect to ride in the rain. I've done that mod on my 2010 Bonneville. I knew from previous experience that installing uncovered cone filters would increase the likelihood of having water enter the engine. My plan was to always keep it covered and in the event of riding in a good rain, I figured it couldn't be too bad. I was wrong.  Riding back from Barber Vintage last year, from Alabama to Texas, I got caught in a rain storm http://imgur.com/JpNSkWa. Had the choice of stopping overnight in Louisiana or pushing on to make Houston before sundown. I chose the latter. Right as I was going over this bridge: https://goo.gl/maps/Ah0I0 in St. Charles, the rain and wind really hit. I had an 18-wheeler behind me, no where to pull over, sheets of horizontal rain, truly terrifying. Then, my engine started to bog down. Gave it more gas, and it bogged down more. Half throttle it would stay running. I was sucking in water through the K&N filters. When I opened the throttle, more water would suck in, instead of air.  I made it over that bridge, immediately exited, waited out the bad part of the storm, then pushed on. For 4 1/2 hours I rode through that storm, half throttle, stopping under bridges when I felt my engine bogging down too much. It hasn't run right since, bogging down in cooler weather, and feels like it sort of skips a beat sometimes. And, now my blinkers don't work because that BC box puts the blinker relay on the bottom of the box, completely exposed to the elements.  If you live L.A. or some other area that never gets rain, go for the airbox removal, it sounds awesome when you crank that throttle. Otherwise, skip it.  TLDR: BC airbox removal exposes important bits to the rain and elements. In the event you and your bike get caught in the rain, expect problems.  edited for punctuation"
Triumph,2vqisv,specbebop,2,Fri Feb 13 17:24:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up on that! I live in Seattle and do a lot of riding in the rain although it's nothing like Louisiana storms.

Triumph,2vqisv,Danino1987,2,Fri Feb 13 20:43:53 2015 UTC,"Side covers on. But, those K&N filters are still pretty exposed at the top. They look really cool, and I would've loved to expose them fully. But, all the electronics (fuses, relays, etc) are under those covers. Not that they helped much is this storm. Every square inch, covered or uncovered was completely soaked by the time I rolled up at my hotel, looking like a scuba diver.  No power commander needed for our year models. Free software: http://www.tuneecu.com/, a laptop (or the ability to roll your crappy desktop into the garage), and a USB cable, and you are good to go. There's a compatibility list on the front page.

Triumph,2vqisv,Basquiat_the_cat,2,Fri Feb 13 20:45:27 2015 UTC,"First you don't need to remove the airbox. TTP and triumph performance have said on the efi bikes it isn't needed. You get like an extra 1 hp over putting a high flow intake on and removing the airbox baffle.   Anyway if you don't have emission testing that will catch it in your area I'd pull the secondary ai from the bike. For exhaust I haven't seen enough personally to make a recommendation on most of them. I can say however I put the arrow 2-2 on my bonneville and really like them. The 2-1 arrow should give a tiny performance boost over the 2-2 and also sound really good.   If you want some performance to go with your better exhaust I'd buy a TTP tune for your bike and load it with tune ecu(takes a 20-30 dollar odb2 cable to program that bike). I'd go with their breathe intake and remove the airbox baffle. The TTP tune will require removing the o2 sensors as well so you do it at the same time you swap the exhaust.   Also I'll agree with some of the others on upgrading the suspension. I went with progressive in the front and rear and it made a big difference. You have a few vendors that have good options in the space. I can only speak for progressive from my personal use but can say I would use them again. Change the oil in the front when you swap the springs.   Past that ride the bike and enjoy it. Most of the other stuff one would do would be for looks or a seat that fits their ass better. If it was my thruxton I'd remove the rear fender and use whatever rear light kit you like. I'd move the key from the front fork to the frame or a new bracket for the tac and speedo and if you keep the cowl on and don't ride two up use a cleanup kit and remove the passenger pegs.   In my case I did the following on my 2014 bonneville t100 black.  Swap rear fender for the thruxton/normal bonneville one Swap the brake light assembly for the bc led one Smaller turn signals and relocated them.  Joker ignition relocator  replacement pop up black gas cap  rear peg removal joker suspension clean up kit arrow 2-2 exhaust  ttp tune 3, airbox breathe intake and baffel removal Progressive suspension front and rear  BC slammer leather seat DID gold chain  I'm sure I'm missing something on that list but those are the basics.   http://imageshack.com/a/img674/1043/xwIJYZ.jpg"

That's just a little over 1k miles per year, really this bike has been ridden very little.  That said, they are asking $6k, that doesn't mean they won't take less. The exhaust is nice, and expensive to buy. It is a nice upgrade. The airbox removal isn't cheap either. Make sure they have the original parts they have taken off the bike included in the sale too. You could sell them to offset the purchase price later."

Triumph,2vlsq3,ccosby,2,Thu Feb 12 22:13:07 2015 UTC,The 12k service they check the valves so you should be good there. 12k miles really is nothing on a modern bike. I wouldn't worry about it. Someone on the triumph rat forums said they hit 100k on a bonneville the other day.
Triumph,2vlsq3,ccosby,1 point,Thu Feb 12 03:31:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. What do you think of a 2012 EFI Thruxton, 6500 miles, all OEM, for 6500 USD?"
Triumph,2vlsq3,ccosby,2,Thu Feb 12 17:57:18 2015 UTC,"Seems like a better deal than the first. I can't really speak to the value as I don't know the used market. The EFI bike gives you some good options though. You have tuners like TTP that make some good tunes for the ecu that can be programed with a laptop and 20 dollar odb2 cable. You have to think that that milage at least they bike got some normal use and should have had the second service done. The second service for the most part is just a general checkover and the basics like an oil change. 6500 miles on a 2012 bike wouldn't bother me at all. I can't say too much though, my 2014 Bonneville T100 Black that I took delivery of at the end of May has 7700 miles or so on it now(had 7 when I took deliver).   Depending on your limit spending wise you might want to see what local dealers have in stock right now. Triumph is still offering like 500 bucks in credit on 2014 bikes which could go towards an arrow exhaust or whatever else they sell you want. I've read about people getting some pretty good deals on leftover dealer stock with dealers even having some 2013 models still in stock.   Edit: FYI on the EFI bikes, removing the airbox isn't really needed for a bump in preformance. The difference in using TTP's intake and removing the baffle in the airbox vs removing the entire airbox is around a single HP in most setups. I only bring this up because you mention the older bike had it done(which would be a carb'd bike). Doing the above airbox mods, putting on a good exhaust, and doing the TTP tune(which also means pulling the o2 sensors which only work on the low end anyway) can net something like up to 10hp. I never dyno'd mine but I did the above(along with removing the secondary ai that bothered me) and put on the arrow 2-2 exhaust. I will say it made a big different in how the bike feels."

This means the shitty car diag tool that is sold at the auto store or harbor freight can read error codes off the bikes(needs to support can but most do as cars went to it around 2005). The free software tuneecu works on this line and can be used to reprogram them. They use a cheap cable that can be had for 20 to 30 bucks on amazon, ebay, and triumph stores like http://bellacorse.net. The drivers are a little tricky if you are not good with windows but if you follow the instructions you should be fine. Tune ECU allows you to tell the bike to ignore the removal of the ai, o2 sensors and do other things like adjust the speedo. The tune ecu site has some tunes already for the bike although most would recommend one of the TTP tunes which you have to pay for.   British customs, newbonneville, and bellacorse are all good places to find upgrades for the bikes.   Two other areas you will find people talking about doing upgrades on the bikes. First a lot of people don't like the stock tires(when riding in the wet more than anything) although I personally didn't have any issues(I did go to an avon rear when I wore out my stock tire though).   The second area is suspension. The stock suspension isn't very good. Still you have multiple good choices to upgrade this if you want. I went with progressive myself in the front and rear."

On my 675r they can go for ever if I let them to, they just slow down when they've reached their limit (or so I assume they have), then I do one counter click and I am at zero. Do all ohlins do that? I thought they're abruptly stop like the shocks."

A buddy had Ohlins on his Monster, I think he had 40 or so clicks available.  The street has a dozen or so.    But it makes a huge difference even with 3-4 clicks on the Street.  The dealer should be able to instruct you as to both the range and recommended settings for starters, or search around and find a pdf of the owners manual either on the Triumph UK web site or somewhere else.   I had my bike set up properly by a local race shop and noted their suggestions for the more aggressive riding settings, and I use the manual for the day-to-day plush riding."

Triumph,2vi0o0,alittletooquiet,3,Wed Feb 11 04:19:37 2015 UTC,"I own the non-R street triple and regularly regret the decision. For only a grand I could have had fully adjustable suspension, front and rear.  It would make a big difference, mostly because I'm a fair bit over the average size and weight that the default settings are adjusted to. I wouldn't mind the upgraded calipers, too.  Whatever my next bike is, it'll definitely be the R-spec"
Triumph,2vi0o0,chunkyks,-2,Wed Feb 11 05:41:11 2015 UTC,How often do you go to the track or need to adjust your suspension?  Are you dissatisfied with the way your suspension works?
Triumph,2vi0o0,aDDnTN,2,Thu Feb 12 01:12:10 2015 UTC,"How often do you go to the track or need to adjust your suspension?   In order: never, and sometimes.  I, too, made the mistaken assumption that ""not going to the track <=> not needing adjustable suspension"". That assumption is wrong.   Are you dissatisfied with the way your suspension works?   Yes. It's plumbed for someone lighter than me in general so it can wallow a little."
Triumph,2vi0o0,chunkyks,-1,Thu Feb 12 01:50:23 2015 UTC,"plumbed? undersprung is the word you are looking for. replace the springs.    That assumption is wrong.

Triumph,2vi0o0,aDDnTN,-1,Thu Feb 12 11:19:20 2015 UTC,"Same here, I was a Striple rider. Went for the base model. I never once thought the stock suspension or brakes were anything less than great.  The extra grand went towards the arrows instead. Didn't regret it a single bit :)  If I was doing track riding, then maybe getting the R spec would have been worth it. For the road; superfluous. You are paying for the decals really."
Triumph,2vi0o0,twixn,3,Thu Feb 12 10:49:58 2015 UTC,"If I were going to buy a Daytona and keep it for a few years, I'd go with the R just b/c in my head it would be a better riding experience and Id regret not spending 1500 more to get the best of the best. In all honesty though, I probably couldn't go any faster around a track on a d675r vs a d675.   Regarding a street triple vs street triple R, the difference is big there and the R model is definitely worth it. The brakes (radial) on the R are noticeably better and the suspension is adjustable."
Triumph,2vi0o0,professorsyr,2,Wed Feb 11 21:44:12 2015 UTC,"To me the difference that you will absolutely notice on a daily basis between the R and non R versions of the Daytona is the quick shift.  I absolutely love having the quick shifter.  I rarely use the clutch to upshift even on commuter trips.  If you're so inclined, you can have the quick shift added to the non r version for several hundred dollars."

Engines and exhaust -> OEM -> Emissions Control -> part #6  your dealer would also be able to get you these parts. personally i suggest going to the dealer to get this sort of stuff, as it allows you to build a relationship with the dealership. They will be much more likely to help you out, lend you a tool, help you with stuff if you know them and vice versa. The internet has never helped me out at 9pm on a sunday, but my local dealers have."

Triumph,2vehdi,headphonesilence,4,Tue Feb 10 09:17:52 2015 UTC,I would ride it. I don't really see the point of putting suspension or performance upgrades on a bike that isn't made to go fast.
Triumph,2vehdi,bbbeeennnjjjeee,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:20:55 2015 UTC,"Added weight of a pillion and luggage will make enough of a difference to justify the mod in my opinion, especially round back."
Triumph,2vehdi,G-wow,3,Tue Feb 10 17:17:28 2015 UTC,"Depending on the dealer they may try to void your warranty with an aftermarket exhaust, unless you've already checked with them.   Of course it's your bike, but I'm curious why you don't want to ride it out for a bit before doing the upgrades? Personally I like to ride it, add a part, ride some more, add a part... You get the idea. Maybe parts that you're changing you would like but wouldn't have known that if you did it immediately.   I'm picking up a striple at the end of the month and the only immediate things I'm putting on are the sliders, engine covers, seat cowl and fly screen. Down the road; quick shifter, two bros exhaust....not sure what else yet, I've got a list somewhere. Oh and the tank grips would go on soon as well. I again I find it more enjoyable to look up parts here and there as I may find other stuff and 'evolve' with the bike. Sorry if I kind of derailed there."
Triumph,2vehdi,ccosby,1 point,Tue Feb 10 10:12:18 2015 UTC,"The exhaust won't be an issue. They're incredibly stringent with what can/can't be mounted and how to get the bike re-approved in Switzerland so no one will mount anything not street legal and if they do, then the dealer/builder is obliged to give you full warranty if the manufacturer doesn't. So no worries there.  The changes I'm making were thought out over almost a year, and sold when I saw a bike very similarly decked out. The handlebar/indicators/speedo are purely aesthetic wishes of mine. The low exhaust however is due to pinion riding and wanting to add luggage on the sides (don't like the solutions i've seen with the high-up exhausts), and also it adds a couple HP since the exhaust isn't doing a 180-degree turn straight out of the engine.  There will undoubtedly be more mods down the line both for performance and aesthetic...i'm infatuated with this machine and want it in my life for a long time.  Mainly what I was wondering with my question is whethere there are any kind of tips&tricks or ""hacks"" every Scrambler owner should know."
Triumph,2vehdi,Troggie42,3,Tue Feb 10 10:30:44 2015 UTC,"If you are replacing the handlebars, fender, and exhaust why not start with a thruxton or bonneville? That way you don't have the extra high mount for the exhaust and you don't have to replace the right side cover(or leave it looking weird as it is made for the high exhaust. Do you prefer the 270 crank?   Anyway if you can do it pull the secondary AI. It really helps smooth out the bike when you let off the throttle. Past that maybe a TTP tune or something.   Also personally I think the suspension is pretty bad. I'd replace it."
Triumph,2vehdi,Free-k,1 point,Tue Feb 10 17:33:32 2015 UTC,Suspension will go probably after 12 months.
Triumph,2vehdi,Free-k,2,Tue Feb 10 17:59:32 2015 UTC,"My instinct on title was gonna be ""ride the wheels off that mofo,"" but now that I have read the post, I say exhaust. I have never liked how the scrambler exhaust is mounted, if the other stuff is low slung like a Bonneville or a thruxton, have at it!"
Triumph,2vehdi,entfromhoth,2,Tue Feb 10 11:33:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah the original exhaust is quite the eye-sore in my opinion but the rest of the bike, especially in the Matte Blue that I ordered is goddamn stunning.  I actually love the arrow 2-into-1 high-mounted exhaust and it sounds incredible (esp. without baffle!) but again it will be an issue in the future when I sort out seat/luggage solution."

Matter of taste man, I've seen some pretty mean looking Bonnies, and given they are easier to find second hand and can easily be converted into some sort of street-scrambler, you might want to stick with your choice. They're a little smaller too so the ergonomics are a little better."

Triumph,2vd1ro,social_engineer_osii,3,Tue Feb 10 00:31:24 2015 UTC,"Aside from the obvious that it may be broken (LED's are reliable, but not indestructible) I'd suspect a fuse.   The tail light (not parking light, that's something else) and the license plate light tends to be on the same connector on Triumphs. If they're both out it may definitely be a fuse. If it's not a fuse, then it's cable damage or a broken tail light.   But I'm pretty sure the tail light and license plate light are on their own fuse. I'd consider it highly likely that is blown, certainly that's the first thing you should check.  http://www.triumph675.net/Daytona675-owners-manual.pdf  http://www.triumphmotorcycles.com/offers-and-services/manuals"
Triumph,2vd1ro,cr0ft,3,Tue Feb 10 06:37:32 2015 UTC,"UPDATE  Thanks to you guys, I found the culprits to be both a blown fuse and mis wiring by the previous  owner/mechanic.

Triumph,2vd1ro,ARedditingRedditor,1 point,Tue Feb 10 03:40:39 2015 UTC,"Well, /u/cr0ft already posted links to the manuals, so that should help you a bit. And, as it's been told by many, the fuse box should be in the left fairing, under that black plastic panel by the clutch lever.    What I'm more interested is what was that ""odd"" thing that you've fixed in the cables. There shouldn't be any odd thing if that tail light is plug-and-play. It should connect directly to the square black plug (parking + brake light) and the 2 turn signals (2 round plugs each).    I'm not sure if the license plate light has its own plug, but it's possible that the previous owner removed it since I don't see it on the picture."
Triumph,2vd1ro,motor_boating_SOB,2,Tue Feb 10 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"It looked like someone (previous owner/mechanic) took out the wires from the brake/park light plug and put them back in the wrong way. I know because one wire was hanging out of the plug and then checked the online schematics for the tail light and it turns out the wires were in the wrong sockets. Park light was connected  to ground -_- Additionally, the fuse for parking lights was blown.  Yeah, the previous owner had a helluva  slide that may have caused the LP mount to fly off. As for the LP light, it's underneath the tail light which also  happened to be the same wiring and fuse ad the parking lights. But it's blocked by the aftermarket  arrow exhaust, so I'm going to have to rig one up when the LP mount comes in. Going to be riding without a License  Plate for now. Just don't tell anybody... ;)"
Triumph,2vd1ro,POZZD,1 point,Wed Feb 11 00:45:09 2015 UTC,Check and see if it's making a good connection. Check fuses. Check any grounds. Maybe you have that particular line shorting to a ground.

They didn't tighten it completely and had the slow leak until it started running way too hot. You should be able to trace the leaks once you find the spots.
Triumph,2vcccc,minus0,2,Mon Feb 9 21:44:00 2015 UTC,It was a widespread issue with the 2013 Speed Triples that not all the hoses were properly tightened at their connections. I wouldn't be surprised if your model suffered from this lack of quality checking. For sure give it a once over and see if you can discover where the white coolant residue is. If you can't find it I would hand it over to the dealer and make them track it down.

A Gerbing 12v heated jacket at full power uses 77W/6.4A and grips are probably about 30W/2.5A (the gloves I use pull 27W/2.2A), so you'll be okay. The power adapter for your heated gear should have a fuse so should you try to overload it, you'll blow the fuse long before you overload the charging system.

A 2014 Striple will probably lock itself up solid if you try connecting with a serial cable. Apparently Bluetooth may work to connect with without that danger.

If you don't absolutely love the idea of spending your weekend rebuilding the carbs, of tinkering with it every weekend to get it running -just- right...I'd probably say skip it.    If you just want something that looks cool retro, a 2000's model Bonny will run you about the same price and be a lot more reliable."

Triumph,2ujoqe,keboh,5,Wed Feb 4 17:54:45 2015 UTC,"You want to vary your revs, gears, and speeds, a lot.  The goal is to smoothly and evenly break in all of the engine and transmission components.  So don't red-line 24x7, but don't be afraid to over rev a little.  Engine brake more than you normally would (or start if you don't) the extra loading will help the engine.  Don't just sit at one gear/rev/speed all the time. You want to change it every 1-2 miles, even if you just go up/down 5 mph.  And get the first 500 mile service done. If you go to a dealer, they're going to charge about 300, but they'll check and tighten everything, change your oil, and otherwise make sure it looks good to go. I'd recommend doing this one even if you never do again. 500 miles is still under warranty so if they catch something you can get it fixed.  As an aside, if you bought a thruxton, did you buy a bonneville? I know they're similar, but I thought they were different beasts, like scramblers."

The 270 degree crank sounds and feels more like a v twin which is why the cruisers have it. The Scrambler allegedly has it because it's supposed to give a better torque curve for off road riding."

Most give it a visual inspection and check the torque on a couple bolts, but I mean that literally. They really don't check much. In my opinion, its absolutely rape to get that service at a dealership. Oil change costs like 50 bucks and takes 15 minutes. Going over (probably more comprehensively than the dealership) bolts with a torque wrench set to specs (torque specs can be found online, or just ask the dealer and they'll tell you) takes all of 10 minutes."

Some dealerships don't actually test the torques (mine doesn't,  for instance).   Seriously, you're mainly paying them (a lot of money, too) to check out your sweet ass new ride and change the oil though.

Triumph,2ujoqe,cr0ft,0,Tue Feb 3 04:06:49 2015 UTC,"shrug  All I can say is that the dealer hasn't screwed me yet, so they were doing something with the time (and no, oogling my stock bike that was in their show room for a year wasn't it).  Oh wait, they adjusted my clutch. Totally worth the time and price. Yep.  Oh, and threw a new program on it.  I'm not disagreeing with you really. Just saying, it took forever, and there wasn't anything else going on, so I figure they were doing something.  I opted to get the service done at a dealer just because I literally have no space to work, and both times it was 30 degrees or something stupid. I'd have to drive to a Walmart parking lot if I wanted to do an oil change."
Triumph,2ujoqe,keboh,2,Tue Feb 3 04:15:16 2015 UTC,"Adjusting your clutch? Like, the cable? That is a 5 minute ordeal, so you know. Reprogramming your bike (for an aftermarket exhaust, I assume?) Isn't covered in the 500 mile maint, and you paid extra for it, or they included it in the price of the exhaust, if you bought that through them.  I'm not saying you (or any one else) shouldn't do the 500 mile initial maintenance at the dealership, though. Some people would rather pay the money than do it themselves, and I respect that. I am just saying what the 500 mile maintenance is, and that people should know that before spending a couple hundred on it is all, because its not like they do anything most can't do at home."
Triumph,2ujoqe,ARedditingRedditor,1 point,Tue Feb 3 04:24:50 2015 UTC,"I have stock exhausts and it was free. I complained about a rough idle so they updated the program for me, is all.  And honestly, you're deliberately downplaying the services they offer in a 500 mile check. They change the oil, sure. They also DO check tight fit on a number of points, adjust brake and clutch levers, and will check anything you complain about.  You're paying them, you need to be vocal.  I've gotten several things topped off for free by doing that.  Any other service period? Meh. Do it yourself. The 500 mark though is a good time to get it done by someone who warranties the service, and can tell if your fluids are 'right' (excessive metal, burning, low, high, water, etc. whatever), and can just check all the shit that needs to be hit up properly.  It's impossible to respond either way to 'some might not even do X' because it's such a loose statement. If they put on the document that they did it, you have to assume they did.  I'm with you to a certain extent; if someone said they had the dealer chain clean I'd call them insane.  I just think the 500 mile service is one you should take a dealer, because they have every incentive in the world to catch stuff before it becomes an issue."
Triumph,2ujoqe,Legbreak30,1 point,Tue Feb 3 04:45:06 2015 UTC,"I mean, I am not going to argue with you about the maint at 500 miles. If you want the dealer to adjust those things I'm sure they would. I do those adjustments myself though, because they are subject to personal preference. My dealer doesn't know what I like, I do.   If you just take the bike in at 500 miles they will do what I have said, unless you explicitly ask them to look at something else.. Personally, if I thought my clutch cable needed adjusting, I will do it right then. I'm not waiting to have a dealer adjust it, and to their own preference. Same with the chain. And as far as fluid levels, those are all clearly marked for you to check yourself. If your bike is losing coolant, take it in under warranty immediately; don't wait for the 500 mile service."

Change gears frequently just to make sure they all see use and settle. The break-in period will allow the parts in the engine wear in together. Don't over-rev the engine and ride ""smoothly"". That's the traditional break-in advice anyway. Of course, some say you should ride it like you stole it during break in, so you never know... :)  Also, the first oil change after your official break-in period is crucial. That oil will be full of metal that's worn off the internal parts, so make sure you get that done.  Read the manual thorougly for service intervals and the like and reserve the first service well in advance so you don't wind up having to choose between riding with contaminated oil or not riding at all.  Oh, and congratulations on the new bike!"

Triumph,2uji8q,jamezracer,2,Mon Feb 2 19:47:33 2015 UTC,"That's brilliant!  I just ordered a locking carabiner, maybe I'll cancel the order and try this out.  Do you have issues with the D-rings scratching the paint?  Did that bolt thread into whatever is behind that plastic far enough?  That would be my only concern.   Also, are those luggage racks or grab rails I see?"
Triumph,2uji8q,jamezracer,2,Mon Feb 2 20:14:31 2015 UTC,"There is a tiny chip on the paint right next to the screw, but it's completely covered by the seat. There was ample thread left, the screws were too long to begin with. I would actually rather use a spacer than the nuts to let the D-rings hook in further, but I ride on the freeway all the time with no issues. The seat really locks them down.  Those are the triumph grab rails. They help keep the helmet from hitting the license plate since I have a tail tidy that moves the plate to just under the tail light. I'm about to 3D print a luggage rack that  mounts a pelican case to them since I haven't found a luggage rack that looks sturdy enough for 80 pounds of stuff."

Triumph,2uji8q,Zkv,1 point,Wed Feb 4 03:34:59 2015 UTC,I used to lock my helmet to my pervious bike until someone cut the strap and took it.

There are cable locks that automatically coil so they don't take up much space.

Triumph,2uihzs,ctesibius,2,Mon Feb 2 18:03:15 2015 UTC,There's no general rule on this - 4 could be close or it could be far. You'll just have to try it - should only take a few seconds. On the clutch side you can put a bit of slack in the cable for the same effect (if you have a cable-operated clutch).

Its a really tough habit to break!  I'm also curious if it is bad to turn the switch to off even after the bike has been shut off with the key. I'm not using the switch to kill the bike, but I still click it into the off position, just out if habit. Maybe I should be leaving it on..."

Used to do it no problem on my F4, that bike was completely analog, so the kill switch just cut power to ignition coils and fuel pump IIRC.

I got upgraded cables from stoltech and a new battery, it seemed to help but I know that demon is still in there.   So you're saying turn it off with the key and just leave the switch in the ""on"" position full time. Going to have to fight muscle memory, but I'll try it too!!"

Triumph,2u5ub9,ManNotHamburger,1 point,Tue Feb 3 02:38:34 2015 UTC,"Nice, I actually tried it this weekend and it did seem to help. Maybe all those cycles it goes through after flipping the switch drain the battery or something."
Triumph,2u5ub9,ctesibius,5,Tue Feb 3 03:07:32 2015 UTC,"The kill switch on Triumphs supposedly resets all of the environmental/adaptive data on the ECU.  It took me awhile to learn this.  The MSF still teaches new riders to use the kill switch.  I don't believe it hurts anything physically, but you would rather keep all of that data in place when possible.    Also, why is the ignition over on the left side of the forks on Bonnevilles/Scramblers/Thruxtons if we're supposed to use it to shut off the bike every time?  It's pretty annoying but manageable."
Triumph,2u5ub9,Fivell50,4,Fri Jan 30 04:14:41 2015 UTC,"It does not reset the adaptive data on Triumphs in general, and I'd be surprised if it did it on this bike as that would male no sense. On my Explorer, it can be reset through the ODB II interface. It's also alleged that letting it idle for 12m after the fan has started will reset the data.   Bonneville: just a styling feature. Some old bikes had it there."
Triumph,2u5ub9,ManNotHamburger,3,Fri Jan 30 17:27:34 2015 UTC,"I'd like to know more About how the ECU adapts, can you tell me where to look? I had no idea it did this."
Triumph,2u5ub9,ccosby,0,Fri Jan 30 04:30:49 2015 UTC,"I have no source.  I've heard this word of mouth but from several different sources.    Now that I think of it, I may not have heard from more than one person that the adaptive info is wiped, but I have heard that the ECU likes to collect some environmental data after the ignition is shut off.  The kill switch yanks its power and prevents that.    All I know for sure is what everyone else in this thread has posted.  Triumph tells you not to use the kill switch, and doing so has the potential to anger the ECU in one way or another."
Triumph,2u5ub9,ckoerner,2,Fri Jan 30 21:32:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting to know, I figured it was just kill power to the fuel pump (which it does) and that would somehow cause the bike to not prime, or not prime well."

Anyway I know the manual for the bonneville and the bikes based off it says do not use the kill switch. I'm guessing the tripples says the same. OP I'd just use the key. I want to say other bike vendors say the same as well but I could be wrong.
Triumph,2u5ub9,Alect0,3,Fri Jan 30 05:03:11 2015 UTC,"From my Bonnie manual:   Engine Stop Switch  In addition to the ignition switch being turned to the 'ON' position, the engine stop switch must be in the 'RUN' position for the motorcycle to operate.  The engine stop switch is for emergency use. If an emergency arises which requires the engine to be stopped, move the engine stop switch to the 'STOP' position.   and   The engine should normally be stopped by turning the ignition switch to the off position. The engine stop switch is for emergency use only. Do not leave the ignition switched on with the engine stopped. Electrical damage may result."

Triumph,2u5ub9,imjusthereforab,2,Sat Jan 31 02:28:57 2015 UTC,"I'm a MSF rider coach and we actually don't teach to use the kill switch anymore, at least me and the guys I work with. In many of the bike owner manuals it actually says to not use it unless for emergency. So that's what I teach, to be familiar with it and know what it is but to rely on the key. I know for Kawasaki and yamaha the ECU stores the data about what's going on with the bike when you use this. Eventually it runs out of memory, congrats your ECU is full now."

You're going to need to consider gas sitting for that long may be a problem. I'm not sure if oil is a problem either but I believe it should be considered.

If it was stopped for 1.5 years, get them to do the yearly service and replace all fluids (oil, coolant, gas). Have them put that in the service manual. That this time to do any and all service recalls that are pending.    Also, check the tires. If the bike wasn't moved during that time, a flat spot may have been developed in them and that is very hard to see. To be sure, have them replace them as well.    Lastly, check the usual places, brake pads, suspension, chain+sprocket, for wear marks. If they show signs of excessive wear, replace them."

Triumph,2u0tac,raca,3,Thu Jan 29 00:09:19 2015 UTC,"Seconding the Maund kit. I have one on my Bonnie and I absolutely love it. I am not a big electrical guy, so I also got the wiring harness adapter from him, and it was a simple 30 min installation. Totally plug and play. The lights used are quite bright, and make it very easy for cars behind you to see the signals while they are tucked under the rear end.   Another option you have is to get signal mounts for the rear shock bolts. You could then just take any signal pair and mount them there, connect them to the wiring harness, and you're good to go."
Triumph,2u0tac,ccosby,3,Thu Jan 29 01:05:27 2015 UTC,"I'll throw my hat in for 'really bad idea to not have turn signals'.  The flashing lights help cars pay attention to you when you're slowing/stopped. No one (and I mean no one) understands hand signals any more.  I'll be honest. I was in my car a year ago, and a biker in front of me was making a left turn, and used a left turn hand signal. I thought he was waving me to go around. Nearly hit him.  I was extremely ashamed of myself, as a fellow rider."
Triumph,2u0tac,BigT2011,3,Thu Jan 29 12:54:00 2015 UTC,If you are ordering from british customs you can get these: http://www.british-customs.com/triumph-motorcycle-turn-signal-relocation-brackets.html  And mount a set of turn signals to the top of the rear suspension. As long as you are not mounting bags they will work fine.   Kinda hard to see them in my pic but thats where I mounted mine(I still have my rear fender but it doesn't matter). I have the joker suspension bolt kit which also makes it look more clean.   http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img674/1043/xwIJYZ.jpg

Triumph,2u0tac,BigT2011,1 point,Thu Jan 29 03:26:12 2015 UTC,When I got them either one of the lights was wired backwards or the british customs adapter was wired backwards and it would blow the fuse when you turned it on. Swapped the order of the wires and haven't had a problem with it since.
