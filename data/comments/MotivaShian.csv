The way the characters react to Shia just does not make since on most of these.  You did not do this, you didn't feel the need to use all of Shia's speech in order with no regard for whether it worked or not. You only added the parts where Shia's lines make since in the context of the story. Good job Dady5000, best edited video on here."
