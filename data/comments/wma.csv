wma,3e4cti,grauenwolf,4,Tue Jul 21 21:25:41 2015 UTC,"In martial arts, the techniques that you want to train, that you want to freely apply in sparring, were originally designd to kill people, to maim people, to injure people.  And of course, in training, this is exactly what you will try to avoid.  So you have to compromise your original martial art to make it safe to train in the first place and that means we can only train one aspect or a few aspects at a time while taking compromises someplace else and compromising other aspects of your martial art.  In order to benefit from your training and benefit from free fencing you have to be aware what it is you are training in your particular fight simulation.   I couldn't agree more with this.  He follows up with a couple of other good points as well.  I'm pretty sure this is has been linked to here before but well worth another watch."

wma,3e2acv,Harnisfechten,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:12:31 2015 UTC,"I think this is quite telling. The Wards are not just the direct equivalent of the guards/posta/etc found in most other fencing systems. It’s not as simple as Ward = Guard. Instead, Wards are the categories the Priest has developed so that we can classify any strike.    Yea, that's how they are used in pretty much all the other pre-17th century systems as well. That's why I always stress ""cutting into the guard"" rather than just assuming a posture."
wma,3e2acv,grauenwolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:23 2015 UTC,"I both agree and disagree.  Yes, in many other systems, the guards are positions that you cut from/through/into. Yet they often also talk about holding certain guards/posta/etc, waiting, standing in a guard, etc.  I believe I.33, however, is different. The 7 Wards are NOT positions that you cut from, or through, and only Langort is the position that all actions end in. In I.33, the Wards (the first 6, disregarding Langort for now since it's the unique one) are categories, not specific positions. Let's look at 2nd Ward. It is not just equivalent to Vom Tag. For example, take someone with a longsword or messer starting in right vom tag, then cutting a right oberhau into longpoint. According to I.33's classification of diverse strikes, this action would be classified as 2nd Ward, and so an appropriate response would be a Schutzen. Now, take someone with a longsword or messer starting from right Ochs and doing a twerhau from the right, ending in left Ochs. According to I.33, this would also be classified as 2nd Ward. Yet it is two different attacks, starting in different Guards, ending in different Guards. Same I.33 Ward though.  I.33 tells us directly that we can classify ""diverse strikes"" by using the 7 parts as divided on pages showing the 7 Wards. I'm not aware of another system that classifies enemy attacks like this. The closest I know of is William Hope's smallsword/broadsword, where he uses a hanging guard to split the possible target areas, and then classifies all enemy attacks as being either inside + above, or outside + below your sword."

wma,3dndgj,grauenwolf,2,Fri Jul 17 17:59:24 2015 UTC,"Item, gather for a high stroke with the short edge from the right at his left   This doesn't say, if you're supposed to hit from above, or if it's a horizontal cut with the hands up high, so it could also be a horizontal Zwerch instead of a Schielhau, right? Maybe you're supposed to try to break your opponents vom Tag with a Zwerch to his hands. The opponent drops his sword, or maybe cuts from above his head to block the incoming Zwerch.   but in the air cross your hands and strike with the short edge at his left ear   I think that's kind of like Doplieren without the bind. You cross your hands, so your thumbs are pointing to the left, so you're able to wrap around your opponents sword. If the opponent now thrusts upwards to displace your sword with his crossguard it should look like the illustration.   as you can see it in the two figures on the upper left in Image C. Pull your crossed hands back up, and strike with a Thwart back from below to his left ear.   Here it gets kinda fuzzy for me. From my German transcript by Wolfgang Landwehr it isn't necessarily evident that the full stop belongs, where the translator put it. It seems like ""Pull your crossed hands back up, and strike with a Thwart back from below to his left ear"" is a follow up attack, but in the German transcript that's not apparant. Let me try a quick translation:               Now twitch with the short edge from the right a high strike to his left / but cross your hands in the air / and strike with the short edge to his left ear / as you can see from the two pictures above to the left from the figure marked with the C. [note that this is not a full stop] / twitch your hands crosswise above yourself / and strike with a zwirch again from below to his left ear / that is also strike the Zwirch from below to his left with a forward step / twitch nimbly by your right side above yourself / and with this twitching upwards push your pommel through under your right arm / and quickly, so with crossed hands, again from your right above into his left / like this also do it with the flat below and above together on one side / this is working on both sides / and notice when you strike to the right lower opening / be it the flat / long or short / your hands will be crosswise / but if you strike to his right upper opening / your hands will not always be crosswise / thereof read in the following example.   In my opinion Meyer isn't describing a followup attack, but instead is clarifying what he means with the crossing of the hands."
wma,3dndgj,rapidfiretoothbrush,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:47:24 2015 UTC,"In my experience, when Meyer says a cut to the ear with the short edge it's a descending blow, unless otherwise qualified.

wma,3dkqow,Azincourt,2,Fri Jul 17 08:50:45 2015 UTC,No but seriously what was the point in this article?  That HEMA covers all historical European martial arts and Ilka doesn't want people to assume that he's doing longsword?  I feel like at least 70% of the articles I see these days don't actually have anything to say.
wma,3dkqow,Azincourt,4,Fri Jul 17 08:52:19 2015 UTC,"Ilka doesn't want people to assume that he's doing longsword?   While I kinda agree with you that the article doesn't say all that much of value, but too share Ilkka's frustration with HEMA mostly being associated with Longsword.  Every HEMA event has a longsword tournament.  When a HEMA event gets into the mainstream media (such as the NYT) it's longsword fighting that gets covered.  No mention of rapier, sword and buckler, saber, single stick, ringen or any other disciplines which were just as prominently used throughout history.  HEMA culture is so Longsword (particularly German) centric. For those of us for whom longsword is far from a favored discipline this can be quite frustrating.  In smaller events we are lucky if there are tournaments for anything other than longsword and rapier.  In the biggest events it's the longsword tournament that gets the greatest attention and the winner the greatest acclaim.  To those of us that don't focus the majority of training and research on longsword, we can sometimes feel unfairly underrepresented."
wma,3dkqow,Silver_Agocchie,5,Fri Jul 17 09:25:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear you.  My preference is for dussack, sword and buckler and messer, and you don't see a lot of those about either.  But the interest in longsword is enormously beneficial to getting people to take an interest in those other, less popular, weapon systems.  If it wasn't for longsword I'd never have tried the others. In fact, when I first started training at LLA, it was suggested that I try out some other weapons to see what I liked and I said no, I was a longsword fighter!  Part of the appeal was that it was so different from the sports fencing background that I'd come from.  Eventually I did give sword and buckler a go and then fell in love with it all.  HEMA is growing, and longsword is the spearhead.  There simply aren't enough people training competitively to bring the same attention to other weapons just yet, but we are growing and we'll get there.  At Fightcamp in the UK this year there are tournaments for longsword, rapier, sabre, mixed longsword and sword and buckler, team competitions involving spears and shields, backswords...  and it's all HEMA :)"

In the biggest events it's the longsword tournament that gets the greatest attention and the winner the greatest acclaim. To those of us that don't focus the majority of training and research on longsword, we can sometimes feel unfairly underrepresented.   I think there's an issue of feeling discriminated against when it's just a literal lack of numbers. SwordFish dropped the S&B tournament because the ratio of skilled competitors to flailing was embarrassing. Longsword generally gets the greatest acclaim because you won amidst the largest field of the best practitioners.  When Helsinki runs a Bolognese Open, they specifically don't have any longsword competition, and somehow longsword fencers manage not to whine like bitches.  Basically, I think non-longsworders aren't under-represented. They just don't have numbers or (often) represent themselves."
wma,3dkqow,GenUni,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:58:11 2015 UTC,"I think you are correct. I also think, if you want an event to have a tournament for something, write a petition. Get as many people who are going to that event who may want to do that thing to sign it. Suggest a ruleset for that tournament if it needs different rules. Offer to judge. Basically make it as hard as possible for the event to say no. Once there is a good amount of demand for that type of tournament, it will spread."

I use the dussack and sidesword to teach me how to thrust with the longsword. My longsword informs my use of the greatstick and short staff, which in turn lead to the spear, halberd, and poleaxe. Meanwhile the dagger precepts teach wrenching with hilt of the sidesword and longsword."

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the initial measure is supposed to be? From the plates it looks as if sword-sword contact at about mid-blade is where the typical ""medium"" measure for this style. If that's the case, how could a movement of arm and feet widen measure while also falling under, unless my foible is coming into contact with my opponents, which seems like a very weak and actionable underbind which would put me in a poor position."

A lot of I.33 interpretations offer the full weak (last 1/4 of the blade) to the bind, which I think is far worse."
wma,3d3hx5,Harnisfechten,3,Mon Jul 13 15:39:13 2015 UTC,"/u/veritas_maori I believe the Falling Under Sword and Shield is indeed a bind of our weak against Halfshield's strong. You are correct, it's a poor position. Remember, the person doing Halfshield here has the advantage, generally speaking. They've entered distance with an Obsessio, they've taken the center, they've provided a threat while protecting themselves. The person who got caught still in a ward is about to die. As I showed in the first step of the drill, if 1st Ward hesitates, they die. They cannot strike directly at their opponent, since they cannot reach either the high or low targets. Their only safe option is to bind (or flee, I guess, but Halfshield could easily follow).  Why not bind strong to weak? Well, it's simply not that useful here. I believe that proper Halfshield has the point high enough that they can only reach a bind with their weak against your blade. If they bind weak to your weak, you can easily dip the sword under and enter with a thrust. So they are left with binding weak to your strong, which you can't just dip and avoid. This bind IS an inferior position, remember, the very next step is Halfshield doing a Schiltslac. Falling Under Sword and Shield is not some amazing magical counter that wins fights. it's an ""oh crap"" reaction that you are forced to take in order to survive longer and try to regain control of the bind. If you were a perfect fencer with perfect mastery of distance and timing and using the Obsessio, you would never have to use Falling Under Sword and Shield."
wma,3d3hx5,EnsisSubCaelo,3,Mon Jul 13 15:53:59 2015 UTC,Instead of @veritas_maori use /u/veritas_maori to tag someone in a comment.
wma,3d3hx5,Harnisfechten,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:21:05 2015 UTC,"Somehow I think there is too much discussion of falling under and too little of halfshield. How exactly is it held against first ward, what is it achieving, what is the intended follow up? Why does it work and how? Then, with these questions answered, it will be easier to figure out what falling under exactly does. I have ideas about this but they are nowhere near tested enough.  For what is worth Cinatto and Surprenant translate cade sub as dive. Given the other parts I personally believe it refers to the motion of the body and not of the sword.  I'm not really convinced by the analysis of images and the conclusion that distance augments. I'm more willing to chalk this up to artistic convention and avoiding a big white space in the middle."
wma,3d3hx5,EnsisSubCaelo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:40:50 2015 UTC,"Halfshield is held with the sword and buckler arms straight out, buckler protecting the hands, sword with the point at around 45 degrees up and forward. As for what it's achieving, it's entering distance while providing a threat and protecting oneself, just like every other Obsessio. The intended follow-up is to simply enter with a cut or thrust, as we see on Folio 11v when it shows us that if we do Halfshield and our opponent tarries too long in 1st Ward and doesn't respond, we just enter with a strike.  Check out Folio 23v, where it gives a more detailed description of what Falling Under Sword and Shield is. I mention this at the end of the article linked here. Basically, it tells us to place our sword under our opponent's sword, and that that's what it means when it says the verse ""fall under sword and shield"". There's not much to backup the idea that ""Falling Under"" is a body movement and not a sword action.  And don't be so quick to dismiss things as artistic convention when there's no reason to do so. Other pages have wide spaces between the two fencers, other pages have the fencers so close their legs overlap, other pages show the fencers drawn almost right to the edge of the page, other pages show fencers drawn leaving a giant margin."
wma,3d3hx5,Harnisfechten,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:58:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you say but I have the impression we could go into more details. Which precise distance, which position of the weapon (not just in the plane of the two fighters), why the position is good against first ward, etc.  I'm well aware of folio 23v, in fact I had pointed it out to Randall Pleasant earlier because it contradicts his analysis. But even there, it does not mention the sword of the priest. The latin text is 'ponit se sacerdos sub gladium scolaris'. It might describe how you should dive into a 'blindspot' of halfshield, rather than just seek an underbind with the sword. The sword is not really in an underbind in this position anyway."

wma,3d2p2b,grauenwolf,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:52:09 2015 UTC,"We talk in tempo all the time. Of course, it is because we are wretched pan-europeanists who freely work from Fiore and Liechtenauer.   But yes, speaking in tempo is a very clear way to explain certain things. Although German terms are not that lacking, just not that we'll constructed to explain time."
wma,3d2p2b,grauenwolf,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:05:35 2015 UTC,Oh I agree that German isn't lacking in general. My club voted to include German terminology in our Bolognese study guide as needed because they are better at explaining actions from the bind.
wma,3d2p2b,Azekh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:11:32 2015 UTC,Longsword fencers don't talk in terms of tempo? That is a contradiction in itself. I'm curious of why longsword fencers haven't cooperate tempo into their toolset. It can't be that hard to combine Italian with German.
wma,3d2p2b,grauenwolf,2,Mon Jul 13 05:10:29 2015 UTC,"There is a stigma against mixing terms from different traditions. Even in the group I formed, that studied German and Italian from day one, it took a long time to get people to understand that if you can't find a word in one system its ok to use a word from another system."
wma,3d2p2b,Azekh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:27:16 2015 UTC,"Well i do rapier and don't use tempo either. Because Destreza counts movements, so time is an indirect thing there."
wma,3d2p2b,grauenwolf,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:54:01 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what you mean. Tempo is about counting movements.
wma,3d2p2b,Harnisfechten,2,Mon Jul 13 15:49:39 2015 UTC,"As far as i've seen it's not quite the same, though i've never studied tempo anywhere. The texts generally only mention things like a movement requiring the sword to go down then up taking longer than one that only requires it to go forward for example (that's pretty much the justification for Atajo), though perhaps more accurate would be to measure the angle the sword turns during a movement.  There's some talk about reacting to enemy movements as they begin too, but no notion of a certain thing being one tempo or the like."
wma,3d2p2b,grauenwolf,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:51:20 2015 UTC,Interesting. I need to learn more about this.
wma,3d2p2b,Harnisfechten,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:52:12 2015 UTC,"the Italian concept of tempo can certainly be useful to describe actions, even in Liechtenauer, but one always has to be careful of taking it too far and trying to force one system to fit into the terminology of another. I mean, people try to shove the Zornhau into being either a single-time or a double-time counter, but IMHO it's somewhere in between. You cut to deflect his blade, and from that bind, Indes, you either flow right into a thrust to the face, or then wind, or cut around to the other side, etc. To an observer, doing a perfect Zornhau-Ort would look much like a single-time counter. But does it fit that definition when there's a decision point like that? idk, and I don't particularly care, because while using terms like single-time or double-time to describe actions CAN be useful, it's not necessary, and I won't shoehorn my interpretations into a concept of timing from other systems."
wma,3d2p2b,grauenwolf,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:34:34 2015 UTC,"To an observer, doing a perfect Zornhau-Ort would look much like a single-time counter. But does it fit that definition when there's a decision point like that?    To be honest, it depends on who you ask.   Some would say ""do this in one tempo"" meaning to flow it from cut to thrust. A new tempo would be introduced only if the opponent did something that warranted you changing your plans. (And if you didn't change your plan, you would then be acting outside a tempo.)  Others would count each blade movement as its own tempo.  So I would say that this is a dui-tempi defense in the sense that yes, there are two distinct actions with the blade. But both actions need to be performed in a single tempo, as in don't pause between them.  Confusing? Yep. That's why I've recently taken to adding the terms ""notes"" or ""beats"" to subdivide a tempo. For example, a lunge involves extending your arm, leaning the shoulder, and then stepping. But that's not three tempi, that's only tempo with three notes."
wma,3d2fdu,ne0henry,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:56:56 2015 UTC,"Most of it makes sense to me except the first cut. Why cut to the side that's already covered by the previous hanging parry?

wma,3cynpk,Azekh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:12:24 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. If I could get it behind my opponent, then I could complete the tondo and wouldn't need the grapple.  Plus there is the similar action with the sword and buckler from Manciolino."
wma,3cynpk,Azekh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:42:47 2015 UTC,"If you let it go wouldn't it naturally turn around the enemy blade? It's not a movement you could do while holding the sword without a few more steps along the way and i doubt it'd be very deadly, but i doubt many would not try to stop it so it could provide some extra cover for the grapple."
wma,3cynpk,LangSawrd,2,Mon Jul 13 23:45:44 2015 UTC,"It does seem like some adjustment or refinement would help maintain control during that little gap where it seems like the opponent may be able to strike before being thrown.  Ringeck has a guard where you hold a longsword in one hand, hanging down the backside, while you use the other to grapple. It should work with a greatsword. If you were to hold on to your own sword for just a second or so longer, perhaps this would close off the vulnerability to your back, rightside and head."
wma,3cynpk,Azekh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:20:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, do you mean with just the left hand while the right starts the grapple?"
wma,3cynpk,Azekh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:46:35 2015 UTC,"No, i mean letting go of it altogether as you do the cut, without stopping and bringing it towards your back. The sword should continue the trajectory, hit the opponent's blade (assuming he's trying to defend) and quite possibly rotate around it towards his back and smack him in the face. With a sword that big that might actually be a nasty hit even without a body behind it.  I got a small cut on my nose because somebody decided to leave his rapier hanging from a rope and it fell and spun over a hay bale after all... Somebody throwing a montante could be quite nasty."

Personally I don't want to even bother striking something other than Tatami or air with my personal sword.  Honestly, it's rather unnecessary.  When test-cutting using tatami, the mat itself is a regulator for accuracy.  If you aren't accurate, you'll either miss, or you'll use up a lot more of the mat than you should, which is self-penalizing, because you've ruined a perfectly good target.  2a.  The video you're talking about it of Tatami, not clay, and it's part of the cutting competition at Longpoint and Fechtschule New York.  It's a pretty good test of a lot of things, not the least of which is the accuracy you were searching for in the above passage.  3a.   Ehh, this is one of those things....It seems like a good idea, but it's not very feasible.  It's a good thought, but what you really need is a target that can track that sword AT you...not just stick out into the middle of space.  I won a cutting competition that featured this feat, and it did nothing to simulate any opposition whatsoever, it was just a dowel rod you had to step around..."
wma,3cumfd,Tymerion,2,Sat Jul 11 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"Hah, yeah, the sword on a pole did look a little awkward.  How much does tatami give feedback on center of percussion placement? I hear it's great for showing edge misalignment.  Have you tried wet newspaper around pvc pipe? I hear it's supposed to be decent for limb simulation. On the other hand, it's more work, as paper fibers tend to wear metal edges, so a blade would want honing afterwards."
wma,3cumfd,Tymerion,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:04:16 2015 UTC,"for CoP?  A decent amount, but that's something that you need to learn how to feel, and it sometimes takes new students quite a bit of time to learn how to feel it.  As an outside observer, I can usually tell if someone has hit with the CoP, that's just about distance management...  I'm personally not a fan of cutting PVC, I would much rather cut dry bamboo or even saplings.  I have cut Tatami wrapped around Bamboo, it's just harder to cut, it doesn't actually provide much more feedback on quality of cut than just plain tatami.  I would rather just cut double or triple tatami than something inside.  Have you watched Mike's sharpening video? You'd be amazed at what a good edge can withstand, having the proper bevel on your sword makes the edge last a lot longer.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dndjr3YXsLA  Here's the link to the video.

wma,3ct15q,GenUni,4,Fri Jul 10 15:17:26 2015 UTC,"We do, in a sense, both official and unofficial. Two official - instructor and assistant instructor. Nope.  An assistant instructor is one who has gone through all the three main weapons - arming sword, sword and buckler, longsword. That means completing basic curricula and being able to explain it. There is no grading in an official manner. Our instructor decides someone is ready and needed, and he announces it. Nope. Certainly.  No politics whatsoever.   I should add that ""assistant instructor"" is not really a rank in the sense of skill, although an assistant instructor should be, of course, highly skilled. It has more to do with responsibility and teaching. So an advanced student may very well be equal in skill and knowledge to an assistant instructor, he just doesn't have the same responsibility.  Now, we do have some unnoficial ""ranks"". People who have gone through the material of the arming sword and have started sparring are not novices, they are something like intermediates. People who have covered all three weapons are advanced students - together with the assistant instructors they are the ""old dogs"", as our instructor calls us.  Now, we have taught about a license system in the future, very simple - basically, three licenses for the three main weapons, which only say that you have completed the basic curricula. I should add we don't have ""advanced"" curriculum, advanced people are just those that just have a higher understanding of the same techniques."
wma,3ct15q,BVKrustev,3,Fri Jul 10 15:55:37 2015 UTC,"No, at least nothing formal. You could say some of us are instructors but it's a matter of ""You know more about this weapon, you teach the class. And we're probably going to argue about what you teach.""   Though at least one of the overarching Spanish organizations does, the Asociacion Española de Esgrima Antigua. I don't know the details, but they have a mix of ""historical"" names like Diestro, Provost and things like Advanced Student. As far as i know they have no limitations in weapons or sparring, but i wouldn't expect the lower ranks to help with teaching.  I know Provosts were supposed to present their research in some area, be it a new weapon, system or specific part of an already studied system in front of a tribunal, show they know the theory (Destreza style) for IIRC three weapons, usually rapier, longsword, and rapier and dagger or sword and buckler, and fence for a while with each with any attending fighters (which could be part of the tribunal or not).  As for politics there's been one Provost that i tought was motivated by that rather than ability. He was the head of one of the biggest clubs at the time. Still i wasn't there, so i can't really judge. Another one was in a similar situation but i'm more inclined to believe he earned it.  That was a while ago when we were still part of it though, not sure if they still do things that way."
wma,3ct15q,Azekh,3,Fri Jul 10 15:41:21 2015 UTC,"1.Does your club have any?   Yes   2.How many?   Scholar, Free Scholar, Provost, Free Provost   3.Are they historically inspired e.g. Scholars and Provosts   I suppose so.   4.What are the requirements before you're ready for the next rank?   For scholars, Generally good attendance, demonstrate understanding of the material in two weapons. Display proper restraint and control as appropriate to the situation ect.  Provost have to start preparing and teaching half-classes on materials that they are interested in for 6 weeks (Multiple times). Continue improving in different aspects of sparring and historical techniques.  Free Provost, Tested externally.   My explanation is simply brief. The full requirements are more nuanced than what I have written but you get the gist.  5.What happens at a grading? Do you need to spar others, perform forms, is there a written test?   Answer questions and demonstration in front of the class (of peers) on historical concepts and techniques. Have to get the answers/demo right. 3 min sparring (With a person of equal skill) which is graded. Have to successfully use historical techniques to defeat opponent.   6.Do you have to pay an extra grading fee?   No.   7.Are ranks in your organisation linked to training e.g. not able to spar, train with steel, or learn a certain weapon until certain ranks have been achieved?   Not really. However, the student has to be able to demonstrate that they can be safe to spar in steel. Its tied more to personal skill and control rather than rank.   8.(if you want to answer) How much politics is involved in the grading - do some sail through while others seem to always be held back regardless of skill?   Nope. Either you are able to demonstrate the ability or you don't. Grading is done in front of peers and everyone knows if you fulfill the requirements or not."

Were he a member of our club, we would recognize Tobler for his work on Secrets of German Medieval Swordsmanship as a master of Ringeck.  \5. Nope. If you haven't proven yourself over the semester, no final exam is going to change things.  \6. Free Scholar candidates may need to buy research material and equipment for their class, but there are no formal fees.  In fact, Free Scholars get a discount in the sense they can may purchase a HEMA Alliance membership in lieu of three months club dues.  \7. Yes.  Initiates are only allowed to spar with Scholars and above. This is for both training and safety reasons.  Only Free Scholars with an active HEMAA membership may announce and run a practice.   Scholars may run a class during a practice with a Free Scholar overseeing.  Scholars may vote on everything except by-laws, which only Free Scholars may vote on.  \8. Potentially a lot.  We only have a 5 class slots on our weekly calendar. So if you want to advance to Free Scholar you need to convince of majority of the members to allow you use of a slot for an entire semester.  Once you have the slot, advancement is just a matter of keeping everyone on track and interested in the topic. You don't have to demonstrate mastery yourself, but everyone else must come away knowing more than they started."
wma,3ct15q,grauenwolf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:40:09 2015 UTC,"My school is one of several associated with another, larger school with a long lineage. Taken together, there are two Maestros, a small number of provosts, several instructors, and quite a few instructors-in-training (of which I am one).   At my school there is only one rank for students: scholar, which means that you are safe to fence unsupervised and that you demonstrate an understanding of basic swordplay, even if we might wince at it occasionally. We originally planned to have a second rank (Free Scholar), but it proved unnecessary: people were way more interested in learning than in an artificial rank.   Scholar examinations are held on no set schedule (though generally not more than a couple times a year) when the instructors think that the student is ready. Examinations are public, celebratory events and generally well-attended. They often include testing of more than one student. Each student must fence 6-12 of the scholars/instructors/provosts, who are all presenting different opportunities and obstacles in order to gauge the student's skill level. The student gets a private pre-test first, to make sure they are ready and to go through some of the dryer academic knowledge that might bore guests. (We instituted this pre-test after we had to flunk a student in front of his friends and family. That was rough, but we learned.)  Politics has never been an issue at all in my school, and that applies to tests as well. Really, all we care about is skill. We have made some accommodations for people in the past, but never because of politics: for example, we rushed one student's test by a couple of months because he was not going to live much longer and he really wanted to be a Scholar before he died. But in a case like that, how can you not?"
wma,3ct15q,lorkpoin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:28:29 2015 UTC,"1)  Does your club have any? Sort of.  2)  How many? 4 - Chief, Cup Bearer, Shield Bearer, Sword Bearer  3)  Are they historically inspired e.g. Scholars and Provosts Sorta kinda.  You can see the connection.  4)  What are the requirements before you're ready for the next  rank?  There aren't any, really.  They're just staff positions, really.  5)  What happens at a grading? Do you need to spar others, perform forms, is there a written test?  What happens is you get stuck with responsibility.  6)  Do you have to pay an extra grading fee?  Hell no.  7)  Are ranks in your organisation linked to training e.g. not able to spar, train with steel, or learn a certain weapon until certain ranks have been achieved?  No.  I was the Chief.  Cup bearer was in charge of managing water supplies.  Sword bearer looked after and checked over the weapons.  Shield bearer did the same on protective equipment.  8) How much politics is involved in the grading - do some sail through while others seem to always be held back regardless of skill?  On the spot appointment - if you can't do the thing, it goes to someone else.  These weren't ever strictly implemented, though, since group never got large enough to bother.  We had considered pin-on badges or patches or suchlike for group members who were able to complete various levels of assessment with different weapons we wanted to play with.  Ultimately, I find the idea of ranks and grades rather pretentious and try-hard.  I'm weird like that, though.  M."

Unfortunately, I'm ahead of the rest, so this is what I've come up with, to more effectively catch them up to me, and then move all of us further ahead. This also helps keeping me from skipping past teaching enough fundamentals because I'm excited about some tricky technique.   Yes 6 ranks. I'd be a strong 4 or weak 5. No pun intended. No, they're about being good at fighting and knowing how a real swordfight would work. If that happens to overlap with historical systems, great, but that'd be coincidental. We've covered the material through that section at least once, and had any required experiences. Depends on the level, but the following things show up:    Drills Oral test / conversation about how things work Technique / tactics games Sparring Test cutting with sharps   6) Money cost only if we need to buy something for test cutting. This is still just a study group.  7) Yes and no. The ranks are a way for introducing material and building knowledge. That requires sparring at some point. But if they want to spar earlier, that's fine. Steel is more about who has what equipment.  8) No politics. We're all friends."

Yes - Novice, Companion, Scholar, Free Scholar, Provost, and a possible a sixth one, I'm not sure. There's not sparring in the companion test, but you do have to name all the manuscripts we study out of, the master who wrote them, demonstrate our knowledge on footwork, the guards, and the strikes. We also have to have to all the necessary gear for synthetic sparring. The exact details of the scholar test aren't known to me, but I do know that a companion has to help a novice pass the companion test in order for the companion to pass the scholar test. Nope. Also nope. I'm still a novice (hopefully gonna take the companion test at next training) and I've sparred with synthetic and steel longsword, steel side sword, and sword and buckler. But then again, due to our club being relative new, I've done a lot of the side sword research and practice on my own. Only two people have taken the companion test so far and both have passed. Most of us are capable of passing the companion test, but haven't tried taking it."

I really want some sort of rank thing so the students can feel good about themselves, so that I will know straight away what they are supposed to know and best of all, it means that I have to actually park my arse down and do some work in developing a curriculum instead of just doing whatever I feel is the theme from month to month.   How would you envision grading them though? I want to make the grades as meaningless as possible as an actual level of skill. I've been toying around with the idea of using it as a sort of baseline for theoretical knowledge of the texts but that seems a little bookish.

You should definitely put a blunt on it. However, it is also very light and forgiving for my taste. I have not seen many museum pieces of that weight. Which also means that it is hard to bind against, say, Albion's I.33. It a good example of the type, and perfect for the price, just the concrete example is a bit on the lighter side. It feels more like a side sword, especially if one is used to heavier swords with more blade presence."

wma,3coki4,ithkrul,2,Thu Jul 9 14:53:19 2015 UTC,"For the long rapier, I recommend L'Ange (Lessons of the Thrust). While the other manuals are a dissertation on fencing meant to be consumed as a whole, this one is suitable for studying one chapter at a time in linear order. It also covers some grappling, Spanish, and some other items.  Then move onto Capoferro, Thiabult, or Fabris.   (I haven't read Giaganti so I can't say anything about it.)    For the sidesword, start with dall'Agocchie or Manciolino. The latter uses the sword and small buckler as the beginner weapon, which I prefer over sword alone because it strengthens both arms.   Once you finish a weapon in either, add the other, Agrippa, diGrassi, or Meyer."
wma,3coki4,grauenwolf,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:10:43 2015 UTC,Manciolino vs Liegniczer for sword and buckler?
wma,3coki4,sixtell,3,Thu Jul 9 17:25:21 2015 UTC,"They are very different animals. Manciolino provides for a very structured set of actions that I think provided excellent pedagogy.   Lignitzer is a nice dovetail to German lichtenauer systems as well as concise plays that can be extrapolated into a fuller system.   Apples and oranges really, I like them both however."

wma,3coki4,grauenwolf,3,Thu Jul 9 18:05:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, Dall'Agocchie should definitely be studied before Meyer if you are learning on your own. He spends a lot more time on basic attacks and parries, far more than any other author in the 1500's.  P.S. If you have someone that already knows the sidesword from any source, then Meyer isn't a bad starting point."
wma,3coki4,fruitybix,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:08:32 2015 UTC,What about equipment?  Is there a major difference in the sideswords usually used in Meyer and Dall'Agocchie?
wma,3coki4,BVKrustev,2,Thu Jul 9 19:03:27 2015 UTC,"Basic functionality, of we look at the techniques they both show, is similar enough that we can safely say it is pretty much the same sword. In the same time period there were, of course, thinner and longer blades and shorter and wider. As long as it can cut well and it has a complex hilt, at least two rings, it is a side sword. Meyer calls it a rappier, but his techniques are clearly more related to the sidesword than the later Italian rapier."
wma,3coki4,BVKrustev,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:25:20 2015 UTC,"Don't know, Dall'Agocchie doesn't have illustrations.  Meyer's sidesword has side rings. Marozzo's sidesword has optional finger rings. Both blades are approximately the same length and I feel that either would be suitable for Dall'Agocchie."
wma,3coki4,ne0henry,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:19:08 2015 UTC,"My brief exposure to lignitzer and i33 suggests the german styles like aggressive closing and using pressure to produce a death, the italian style likes to control the opponents sword, strike repeadedly and escape while looking good."
wma,3coki4,grauenwolf,2,Fri Jul 10 08:41:18 2015 UTC,"As you said one handed sword, I want to point out that almost everything in Liechtenauers longsword can be done with a medieval arming sword - and Messer, as you can see from the Lecküchner manuscript. It is a unified system for different weapons."
wma,3coki4,grauenwolf,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:27:49 2015 UTC,No doubt. Swords around the world have similar patterns of use.  and the European works definitely treat weapons  systematically this way.
wma,3coki4,grauenwolf,2,Thu Jul 9 21:32:03 2015 UTC,"Good comparison. For example, the Japanese koryu school of Katori Shinto ryu does not have different techniques for kodachi and tachi (one- and two-handed sword), just slightly different applications, and that is mainly because the kodachi kata are against the tachi. Against a kodachi even applications would be similar."

It is always a Mandriotto Fendente or Riverso Fendente, as you can never be exactly down the center. To others, there is only a Fendente with no need to make a left/right distinction.     A Shielhaw would be a fendente with the falso edge. I guess you could call it a ""Falso Fendente"", though I wouldn't be surprised to see it expressed in the form of ""a fendente in the manner of an imbrocatta (downwards thrust)""."

And with the right edge/cut to the right side, and of the reverse [left] side we go with the false edge/cut. And our path is from the knee to the head.   Some read this using the false edge, rising cut to the left side. If so, it would necessitate a thumb below grip and match Meyer's description of the Zwerch from our right to our opponent's left.

wma,3ccrf2,Lameduck57,5,Mon Jul 6 22:12:54 2015 UTC,"This is pretty interesting actually, especially how it turned out at the end. The more people there were compared to the three experts, the more they all squandered opportunities to press the attack. Only after their numbers significantly dwindled and the ""diffusion of responsibility"" was less pronounced did they start pressing the attack and the experts began to fall.  All credit to the experts as well, they clearly knew what they were doing. Kept moving to make sure they didn't get surrounded and adopted a posture that made the target on their chest harder to hit.  In a real swordfight where your entire body is the target rather than that one spot it would have ended a fair bit faster of course, but, an interesting look at how heavily outnumbering someone isn't necessarily all that good for your side depending on the training of the group to act as a group."

wma,3cap1q,BVKrustev,6,Mon Jul 6 13:03:05 2015 UTC,"Counter the counter. The thing with people who preffer countering (which is actually a rookie mistake in and itself) is that they grow too confident in them. Counter the counter, when you are not sure what the counter is, just step out of distance. Get in, provoke, get out. Next time you'll see their counter and be able to counter it on your own."
wma,3cap1q,Azekh,3,Mon Jul 6 14:38:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how doable that is in saber, but you could try advancing while keeping yourself well covered until you're close enough that he'll have a hard time defending against the initial attack. Or at least you'll make him run into a wall if he keeps retreating.  Of course this might actually make him attack, so be ready to make a counter of your own."

wma,3cap1q,fruitybix,2,Mon Jul 6 13:22:17 2015 UTC,"Another thing that may work, try going in close for a tight bind and attempting grappling.  Not even necessarily taking him to the ground, just controlling his weapon hand.  If he waits for you to get that close you should be able to set up the situation where you have the advantage."
wma,3cap1q,grauenwolf,2,Mon Jul 6 14:47:41 2015 UTC,"Everyones advice is pretty good. Closing into distance under cover then attacking when you are too close for him to do anything will probably work, just be certain of your defence or he may attack first. but if he likes running it may get annoying unless you have a corner to walk him into.  Feints and provocations are going to be good. Pretent to make your favourite cut, and really sell it, add a little body lean, if he can see your face through the mask then using your eyes can help. Then when he flinches or parries at nothing cut his forearm. Over time your opponent will get better at picking your false attacks, at which point you can start feinting the first cut, then the second, then hitting on the third. Its hard to sell that but beutiful when it works.  thrusts can be used in the same way to provoke a response but can be riskier and result in doube hits if your opponent is overly keen on hitting you at the cost of their own safety."

wma,3cap1q,GenUni,2,Wed Jul 8 10:50:14 2015 UTC,"With respect to dueling sabres what he is doing is fundamentally wrong, and by that I mean he is not fencing.  If you are allowing his counter-attack to succeed then that is another matter.  How can you do this?  Mostly by pulling your original attack.  In you original post you wrote that you attack and he ripostes [sic] - no, he is not riposting unless he has already parried you.  So if you attack and he counter attacks you two things have to be true: (1) you have missed him somehow, and/or (2) he hits you.  These cases are not exclusive.  For example...  Case the first, you attack and miss - it doesn't really matter what he does as long as (for him) he does nothing that gets him hit.  Sometimes I notice fencers pulling their attack (which has priority) as soon as they perceive their adversary making an incorrect action.  You are allowing him to get away with it, so stop.  If your original attack is properly set up then complete it - do not back down.  This will change the scenario to, you attack, he attempts a counter attack but gets hit.  If this causes a double hit it is his fault.  That is sword science.  However, it could be that your original attack is flawed in some way (Time, Line, Measure) and that he is capitalizing on that error.  If this is the case then you are attacking from disadvantage and there is little you can do to change his behaviour until you correct your attack.  Case the second, as described above, could be either a double hit - his fault - or you haven't hit him at all.  We need to know that much more in order to help you further along.  Until then, we typically defeat counter attacks with countertime actions and this can get very tricky to pull off.  If you feint the attack he is not going to parry, because he would be doing that anyway against your attack, right?  But he isn't, he is counter attacking you.  Why would he all of a sudden start parrying a feint?  He won't.  So instead YOU parry the counter attack in countertime.  That will get him on the offensive disadvantage and give you the riposte advantage.  This is what it means to parry in countertime - against a counter attack.  Another good suggestion already mentioned was to change your target effectively shutting down his attempt as it begins.  There are ascending cuts to the wrist - both inside and outside - that can frustrate the living counter attacks out of most fencers."
wma,3cap1q,dachilleus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:15:50 2015 UTC,"I'd assumed OP to mean ""he [parries and] ripostes"". If his opponent is instead landing stop hits as he attacks, it's a whole different game..."
wma,3cap1q,grauenwolf,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:38:05 2015 UTC,This is true and we need more but little information to make that distinction.
wma,3cap1q,dachilleus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:46:18 2015 UTC,What's wrong with simply counter-cutting such that you parry and wound with the same blow? That's a rather popular concept in many traditions.
wma,3cap1q,arnorath,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:53:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, the counter cut, even in Radaellian sabre, is a method suitable for counter-time action.  However, it is not easy to pull off and requires both the training for the counter time, but also in how you modify the original cut into a parry and molinello (as is easiest to pull off).  So while it is certainly an option it is not one to ""simply"" do.  Without knowing the the precise training regimen, system and experience of the fencer OP I would not first recommend this action without knowing that he had some experience with it.  Also, it is technically not ""the same blow"" as it requires you to change directions in a small unit of time and make a rather large action.  If we separate the counter cut from the adversary's response it can appear that way - and there are fencers who can deploy the counter cut such that it appears not to have any time deficiency at all.  But the issues of Priority and the actual behaviour of the fencers in question remain unanswered: is OP failing in his attack somehow?  If so, the solution is to fix the attack.  Is his adversary going to counter no matter what?  If so, then he must take it to counter time.   To do this requires that he know how to set up his initial cut so as to maximize the change into counter time."

wma,3cap1q,DavidRPacker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:57:30 2015 UTC,"An idea to practice and see if it works. (ps. I'm trying to translate Bolognese in to saber, which I'm just starting to learn so apologies if I mess something up).  Start by preforming a weak cut #1 with an advance, when he goes to parry pull your wrist back and wheel the sword around in to a cut #6 or #2 to the side of the head.   While you are turning the wrist to preform the second cut take an aggressive passing step front left with your left foot.  This does two things, gets you further away from where his blade had to go to parry your cut #1 and gives you a more advantageous angle for your second cut.   He will likely do one of two things, he will either get hit, or retreat out of range, if he does the second preform a quick wrist cut #2 at his sword hand while preforming a backwards passing step with your right foot to put yourself outside of engaging distance. Quite often if he didn't get hit by your second cut, he will want to point his sword at you to get you back leaving his wrist extended.    Now obviously doing this same sequence over and over won't help much, but the main point is to attempt to attack from angles which present you the highest degree of success on any given attack.  If he has a strong defense it means he is depending upon your attack to come from predictable angles, and keeping your shoulders squared to him works right in to that strategy.  Saber in my very limited experience seems to have a tendency to end up rather linear (I know it doesn't have to be of course) so mix it up, try and attack from angles that give you the highest % of success on each cut.   (p.s. sorry if this sounded convoluted or doesn't work for you, just trying to articulate something that ended up helping me and doesn't translate well to text)"
wma,3cap1q,Aristotle29,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:20:09 2015 UTC,"Go for the wrists and hands as your primary attack. If the line of your cut is correct and you work the correct measure, you will be safe-ish from counters, and will frustrate your opponent into initiating attacks.  Most counter-fighters tend to prefer to counter from a strong position, which means they are still, or wanting to be still. Use aggressive movement and angulation to keep them from settling.  And recall that your question was ""how can I provoke him into attacking me?"" and realize that you have succeeded. You just aren't prepared to counter his attacks the way you think you are. Spend some time fighting without thinking about winning and instead observe how you are being hit. With good observation, counters should reveal themselves."

I have a question about the montante one-handed thrusts - I've never handled one, but at full speed even a heavier longsword can be hard to recover from a thrust like that, is he comfortable using it because of the relative small speed, or is he confident it will work just as well in full speed?"
wma,3c5r3h,Hussard,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:59:05 2015 UTC,I got the impression that Rick (white jacket) sensed that Tim (black) was not willing to close against him so executed a risky thrust to push him off the idea of actually closing range both for intimidation and because Tim seemed to hesitate just a fraction too long.

Rick (white jacket) is a rapier fiend, has been doing both rapier and classical italian foil for seventeen years and can lunge with either foot forwards and recover super fast. The sword is light enough that someone like rick can easily lunge and recover. Even if he does not land the thrust it helps make space so he can follow up with a cut, which is advised in one of the manuals. I can only lunge off one side and cannot do it so fast or smoothly, and would not preferance that kind of thrust, both because my chances of success with it are low, and with steel i would be scared of injuring my training partner.  I should note ricks control and judgement of distance is really good, none of those hits were particularly hard, even the thrusts were pulled.

As soon as i step into range he stop thrusts me somewhere my shield and sword are not covering. in the past He has stop thrust me in the foot with a shinai simulator, which is not a safe thing to do with steel.   I Cannot close after i have parried a cut because rick uses the momentum of the sword to cut me somewhere else, and you really need to throw everything into the parry or the big sword just blows through. And he is so ridiculously far away.  I did not laumch myself into an overcommitted bull rush. That might have worked but might also have gotten one of us hurt.

wma,3bxra9,Aristotle29,0,Fri Jul 3 15:44:29 2015 UTC,Yea. Meyer is irrelevant to Lichtenauer even though a third of his longsword book is a gloss on Lichtenauer.
wma,3bxra9,grauenwolf,2,Fri Jul 3 16:05:58 2015 UTC,"It's not irrelevant to the earlier sources, but it's a footnote, just like the New Zedel or Hutter. As a system of understanding fighting and how to fence it changed with time and with individual practitioners.  MS3227a tells us of Leychmeisters with new names and combinations of cuts which aren't intended to hit their opponent initially. The intent and meaning of that source and Meyer is strikingly different. The study of Meyer and his context is gradually rehabilitating his Fencing as martial training (mostly thanks to Roger Norling), but at the same time it's different to the tradition of fencing associated with Lichtenauer in the C15th."
wma,3bxra9,Toastig,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:38:53 2015 UTC,"Which is why I want to reconcile it. Did the definition change? Was Meyer high? Or is our definition of the technique too narrow and the German's intended for both to apply across the ages?  Right now it is an academic question, but if we come across another manual that doesn't define its terms we'll need to know the answer."
wma,3bxra9,grauenwolf,3,Fri Jul 3 16:42:13 2015 UTC,"It is not an academic question. I believe all the secondary guards that Meyer describes were used at the time of Doebringer. It wouldn't make any martial sense not to, because guards do not exist in vacuum - they are a reaction to a specific threat. And Einhorn is a better reaction to certain threats and provides better opportunities in some cases than a classic Ochs.  It is just that earlier masters probably did not see the point to divide the guards into subguards. I am sure even a direct student of Liechtenauer used Einhorn, he just thought of it as ""a high point ochs"" or something like that, or just ""that different ochs that saves my ass sometimes"". Meyer was just a product of his time - the Renaissance, where people got academorgasms from categorizing stuff. It is pretty much the same stuff with a  few exceptions like the Prellhau.   And I think Meyer is a valuable source to help you break out of the idea that guards or strikes are just performed in one perfect way. Motus, das Worte schöne, ist des Fechtens ein Hart und Krone. And this motion is not just of the body, but of the mindset."

wma,3bxra9,BVKrustev,0,Fri Jul 3 07:48:37 2015 UTC,Doubling in Meyer is to the same opening with a different edge. With their version it is to a different opening behind the sword.

wma,3bwvd9,grauenwolf,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:31:50 2015 UTC,We're revisiting this weapon for the first time in over 2 years. I'm eager to see how our opinions differ on the weapon.
wma,3bw6m7,Mexicanpandabear,10,Thu Jul 2 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"First point, axes feature in some treatises, and a lot of people who do HEMA also try to interpret for equipment where there are no sources at all, so if you want to learn any kind of axe then you might find people to study it with.  Second point, in most circumstances axes would be considered inferior to swords (there are some where they aren't, most of which involve armour of some type).  Single handed axes tend to get used because they are cheap and easily available, not because they are a prime choice of weapon.  Third point, a good martial artist does not limit himself to a single weapon style :)  When I first started I was totally ""I am a longsword fighter"" but you can't fight with a longsword if you can't grapple, so you need to learn to wrestle.  Then one day I asked my instructor ""If you're fighting in a house, I guess you have to half sword,"" to which he just said ""I wouldn't take a longsword into a house, I'd just use a knife.""  And I realised that to be a fighter, you gotta learn a range of weaponry.  After trying a range of weapons I found that dussack systems are the most enjoyable to me."
wma,3bw6m7,Azincourt,3,Thu Jul 2 17:39:22 2015 UTC,"At my club, we occasionally play with pollaxes, though. A big problem is that even with modern safety gear and rubber heads, those things get moving really fast, and it would be beyond easy to seriously hurt someone. So we play slowly and carefully with them when we do.  What kind of axes are you interested in?"
wma,3bw6m7,PartyMoses,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:39:23 2015 UTC,"I was thinking pole arms, or one handed axes"
wma,3bw6m7,PartyMoses,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:53:21 2015 UTC,"You might want to take a look at Dimicator's facebook page. He does a lot of viking-era reconstruction, trying to extrapolate from early sword and buckler manuals to piece together how viking shields were used. I don't follow it that closely, but I'm pretty sure I've seen him address the use of hand axes with the shield and the like.  At the very least, it might help to network to people with similar interests."
wma,3bw6m7,FuriousJester,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:29:14 2015 UTC,Hand axes are okay but pole axes are fairly devastating. While I'm okay with idea of playing with my friends going to a tournament wearing a fencing mask between me and the amount of force a pole weapon can impart doesn't sound like fun.
wma,3bw6m7,ellendar,3,Fri Jul 3 05:43:11 2015 UTC,"""Allowed"" is a tricky word.  Simply put there isn't any official meaningful hierarchy in HEMA.  It isn't like American football, where everyone has to follow the NFL official rules.  It is more like a genre of interest, like painting.  There are a lot of different ways to paint, and some have a lot of followers and seem to work better than others, but as long as you're following the basic concept of putting paint on to surfaces to make a picture, you're doing painting.    The question is more what you want to do within HEMA.  Axes tend not to be prevalent for a couple of reasons. There aren't many treatises involving axes, and those that do exist as far as I've seen aren't particularly extensive. As such you may end up in that limbo area between learning a historical martial art, and screwing around with an axe trying to invent a new style of your own (generally not considered HEMA).    Secondly is safety.  It is very hard to make an axe like training tool, that sill moves and acts like an axe to training, but doesn't still hit your opponent like an actual axe or mace.  That means it is dangerous, and very hard to train with any intensity like a real fight would have without seriously hurting someone.  It also means that if you want to compete in tournaments, you pretty much can't do anything outside of fully armored events, and even then good luck finding someone to let you compete.  You can train with dangerous weapons with less than adequate armor among friends who you trust to maintain an appropriate level of intensity to your protection.  You can't trust the same to strangers who are all competing to win.    Lastly I would say to check with the people around you and what they study.  When you are first getting your feet wet and learning a martial art for the first time there are a lot of base fundamentals that remain mostly constant across all weapons.  Learn how to use a sword and buckler, and most of the knowledge on distance, shield use, parrying etc... is likely to transfer over to one handed axe pretty well.  The difference is that there are plenty of resources on how to learn sword and buckler correctly.  Axe you're likely to have to start out with a lot of guesswork from the beginning.  It is a lot easier if you at least have a solid framework of fundamentals before you start doing guesswork."
wma,3bw6m7,pistolleer,2,Thu Jul 2 20:51:33 2015 UTC,"""Le Jeu de la Hache"" is a great manual.  The problem with all pole arm combat simulation is maintaining non-lethality so that it remains a game without reducing speed or weapon weight so much as to make the combat unrealistic.   With all that extra leverage created by the extra length of the handle, halberds and pole hammers are effective...  That's why they did it; to focus and leverage the power of the human arms into a device that could crush, split and/ or puncture armoured plates...    The only safe way to play with pole arms that I've seen is the SCA full armoured practice with rattan and rubber weapons simulators."

wma,3bwgui,ashultz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:23:37 2015 UTC,"They flex well enough, but be warned that lately Darkwood has been having tempering problems. Most of their blades are taking sets very quickly."
wma,3bwgui,Wyes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:56:59 2015 UTC,"Don't waste your money.  For dagger training, anything that is roughly dagger shaped will suffice - a piece of wood, a plastic training knife etc.  Dagger techniques do not require a rondel shape to work, they will work with any kind of knife.  Flexibility and blade strength are irrelevant when training dagger, so just go with whatever is cheapest."
wma,3bwgui,Azincourt,2,Thu Jul 2 22:29:36 2015 UTC,"A lot of techniques require you to grab the blade, which means that an overly flexible blade will be problematic."

wma,3bwgui,Azincourt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:25:17 2015 UTC,"I have a couple of these, which are pretty ass for anything involving grabbing the blade, but they're rubber, so they flex a lot more than steel, wood or plastic."
wma,3bwgui,g2petter,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:27:17 2015 UTC,"I guess there's a trade off to be had - if you want to do full speed and intent training then the rubber ones are going to be better as safety is the higher concern, if you want to drill more slowly then something else.

Most people who are against tournaments have participated in tournaments and spar hard and regularly. Also, you don't need to be against tournaments and criticize them.   Tournaments 5-6 years ago were terrible. The fencing, the rulesets, the judging. I was very much against them than.

If you don't, the lames for the neck don't come all the way down, and then you have a gap. Which would make the helm a useless piece since you'd still be asked to wear a gorget."
wma,3bqdb1,Aristotle29,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:46:26 2015 UTC,"Can't they be rather adaptable with ""soft"" attachments? Like sliding rivets or cords, plate or lamellar armor style."
wma,3bqdb1,Azekh,2,Thu Jul 2 15:56:59 2015 UTC,"Why do you want that?  Just for convenience?  The back of head protection already on the market (e.g. the SPES back of head cover) is  adequate for that need and since it's an addition to a mask, it's easy for novices to acquire one later on (rather than having to buy an entirely new mask).  There are some things that matter in terms of mask design for HEMA, integrating back of head protection doesn't seem to me to be important right now.  I'd put it as probably the very least important thing on my list of mask adjustments."
wma,3bqdb1,Azincourt,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:32:54 2015 UTC,I would buy one.
wma,3bqdb1,grauenwolf,2,Wed Jul 1 18:19:24 2015 UTC,"So the biggest problem I have with fencing masks, other than the lack of integrated back of the head protection, is the fact that they sit more or less flush with the temples. They do a pretty good job dealing with impacts coming from the front, but anything to the top or side of the head they aren't so great for.  Even with extra padding on the temples and top of the head that most mask protectors offer, I've been dazed by fairly light blows to the temple, and I know plenty of people who've come away with lumps on the top of their head. We either need something with better padding, or something that uses suspension instead (think hard-hats) like That Guy's masks."
wma,3bqdb1,Wyes,2,Fri Jul 3 03:02:52 2015 UTC,Lets just hope it doesn't cost as much as 2-3 normal masks.
wma,3bqdb1,Azekh,2,Wed Jul 1 12:31:40 2015 UTC,"It will, because you can't make something that's niche interest, uses more materials and charge the same as any other mask.  If this is a unique product on the market, of course it will cost a lot more.  Given that there's no competitor to this product, it would make no sense for LP to make a brand new design and then not charge a lot more for it - we're all buying the sport fencing masks as it is anyway.  I'm happy to play double for a mask that legitimately keeps your head safer in full contact steel play."
wma,3bqdb1,Azincourt,2,Wed Jul 1 17:41:48 2015 UTC,It can be more expensive without being 2-3 times as expensive.
wma,3bqdb1,grauenwolf,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:18:25 2015 UTC,Compared to a standard mass produced fencing mask of the basic type that they have been making for decades (even with minor alterations) I think that to expect a company to make a high quality extremely niche-interest mask (since most HEMA enthusiasts won't want/need the added protection) that isn't at least twice as expensive is unrealistic.
wma,3bqdb1,Azincourt,2,Wed Jul 1 20:39:53 2015 UTC,"Lets refine the question. Are we talking 2x a current, high quality mask that we should be using? Or 2x a Blue Gauntlet cheapie that we put into loaner kits?"
wma,3bqdb1,grauenwolf,2,Wed Jul 1 21:49:32 2015 UTC,"Depends what you want.  If you want something 2x better than a cheap, barely-protects-you-from-synthetics mask then you'll pay double or more than the cost of that type of mask.  If you want something twice as good as a Leon Paul X-Change mask then you'll probably pay double the price of their standard mask.  I want something that offers the following:   Additional padding around the head the thicker mesh stronger bib, with a pleat to prevent blades sliding beneath it More space between the skull and the mesh   In other words, I don't want a ""very marginally improved"" mask, which is basically just a LP mask but slightly stronger.  I want a HEMA mask, designed to function under heavy duress and offer good protection during HEMA activity, not sport fencing.  You'll get what you pay for, ultimately.  You wouldn't waste money on cheap swords since you know they won't do the job, and won't last. The same has to be applied to masks.  I understand that people don't want to pay more for a mask, but if the community attitude is ""I am not willing to pay more for a better mask"" then why would any company really make that much of an effort?"
wma,3bqdb1,Azincourt,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:37:12 2015 UTC,Well except for a blade catcher built into the back of the bib (is that what you're asking for?) I think the LP HEMA mask meets all of those except maybe the extra space. They are snug fitting with the padding and I know some people have had to go a size up from their usual.
wma,3bqdb1,Azincourt,2,Thu Jul 2 16:41:36 2015 UTC,"The pleat/blade catcher I mentioned is the thing that Dave Rawlings was talking about in this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRhV11fvse0  The new LP masks certainly sound like a step in the right direction, but I don't think that they are really meeting the full needs of the HEMA community."

wma,3bmhbq,Hoihe,2,Tue Jun 30 12:21:26 2015 UTC,"Well, there are riding swords, which is basically arming swords used in civilian context. They did not hve a smaller gaurd, however. Actually, the less people used big shields, the more the guard grew. Early arming swords are nothing more than viking swords with a large guard.  11-13th century was the age of the arming sword. And sources suggest they were often carried without a buckler or a dagger.  Out school studies arming swords before anything else, based on both I.33 and the Liechtenauer tradition. They are used easily without any second weapon, and they actually teach you angles of parry very useful with the longsword.  We also have a pair of Albion viking swords that we won from the last photo contest. They are with very samll guards, but the main difference in use is the shorter and more flexible blades. The guard is not for an active parry in an arming sword, it is for when the blade slides to your hand, or when you slide along the blade. So, no, not much of a difference.  Circular guard, however, which don't catch a blade as well, are harder. They can glance out a blow, and they can be used to strike a blade away, but they are all in all worse for protection."

wma,3bmhbq,grauenwolf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:12:40 2015 UTC,"Once you get into the smallsword era the guards are downright tiny with quillons that appear to be more decorative than functional. However, the smallsword is generally thought of as a thrust-only weapon so the guard really only needs to protect the hand from a straight thrust."
wma,3bmhbq,Pawn_in_game_of_life,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:24:06 2015 UTC,The shell is of a decent enough size on a smallsword to provide enough hand protection unless you have big hands
wma,3bmhbq,JimBarrows,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:37:02 2015 UTC,"Side swords can be used with or without a shield, buckler, targe, cape, knife, second sword.... etc.   Some (maybe most) of the manuals covering side swords show at least side sword along & sword buckler.  In the Bolognese tradition some authors taught side sword  alone, while others taught side sword & buckler as their first weapon system.  In terms of small guards though, the smallest guards I see are on Polish sabers, and their equivalent.  The curve of the blade provides a degree of hand protection on defense ( ie no sliding down into the hand, and the curve prevents you from ""gathering"" your opponents blade).  The thumb guard being a simple loop, and maybe a knucklebow.  The spatha, gladius & seax you mention are all short, stabby weapons.  Short enough that some examples cross into large knife territory.  Some are a bit longer.  The viking hilts might be small to allow certain techniques with the larger round shield they used.  Some folks working with sword & center boss round have found that ""normal"" sized cross guards get hung up, or change the angle of the sword enough to negate certain techniques.  In general, cross guard style is probably dictated by function as much, or possibly more than fashion or style.  Curved blades tend to provide hand protection via the curve.  Short weapon fighting styles tend to make hand protection moot.  In terms of parrying, the Bolognese defenses tend to favor deflection rather than hard parries (specifically, I mean a defense where both blades have stopped moving.  your definition may vary of course.).  However, the Polish saber lends itself well to a hard parrys, and not so much to a softer parry.  Cutting styles, well, I'm not sure what exactly you mean.  In the west, thrusting sword tend to come to a needle point, while cutting swords (I'm leaving sabers, cutlasses and curved swords out intentionally here.) meant for cutting tend to be straighter along the edge, and have a more ""rounded"" point.  Like most generalizations, there are exceptions.  Somebody somewhere has probably written a doctoral thesis answering your questions.  I'm just giving you super fast overview, from the perspective of an amateur swordsman of dubious historical knowledge. :)"
wma,3bj95p,BLARGLARG,8,Mon Jun 29 17:59:00 2015 UTC,"First off for solo training the rings or no rings shouldn't really matter.    As for protecting your fingers there are two things that are important. 1. The most important is you and your partners training with a level of intensity appropriate to your training, skill, and protective equipment.  Rings etc... can help protect your hands, that is what they were put on there for, but you will get hit in the hands at some point.  It is the price of doing business really.    Get appropriate gloves if you want to do full intensity sparring with steel.  With anything really to be honest, but a couple of rings won't make all that much of a difference when it comes to protecting your hands if you practice on a regular basis. Your hands will get hit, and should get hit if your partner is helping you train appropriately.   Gloves matter more than rings.   Other things to keep in mind, what are your entire goals for this blade?  You've mentioned solo drills, and group training when you have the chance, but do you want to compete?  If so you'll probably need a feder instead of just a blunt steel sword. Also if you have a near by group find out what they train with.  If you get a long handled german sword and they're a italian Fiore  group or vice versus it may be inconvenient (though still workable either way).    Also keep finances in mind, for solo work just about anything that is designed for hema and isn't complete junk will work.  (not cold steel though please!)  Peter Regenyei has a very good reputation http://www.regenyei.com/usa.html  especially for his prices, though I don't own one myself.  My old Hanwei Tinker bastard sword has still been serving me quite well after plenty of hard use in Fiore's tradition."
wma,3bj95p,ellendar,6,Mon Jun 29 20:28:36 2015 UTC,"I endorse this comment.  also I own both a darkwood longsword with rings and a regenyei feder with rings.   including postage i could have gotten another two regenyei swords for the cost of the one darkwood.  the darkwood blade is light and flexible, requires a thrusting tip you must buy or make yourself, notches horribly, requires constant filing and the rings are very bent after what I would consider normal use. the rings will eventually snap from being bent back, scott from darkwood will replace them but postage sucks. the leather grip has also peeled away. my friends darkwood broke off at the pommel thread after a few months of use. again, scott will replace it but postage is on the customer. the threaded pommel needs to be tightened periodically while bouting.  the regenyei has a thicker edge profile along the blade, and has nothing but minor scuffs after a decent amount of use. no nicks. it has needed no maintenance. its slightly heavier, but still very safe to use. it does not flex as much in the thrust, but regenyei offers a lighter more flexible blade if you want it. the rolled tip is really excelent. the spiral leather grip is extremely secure. the peened pommel is great. the side rings are extremely solid and have not bent. it is compatible with the eclectic variety of swords present at my club.  I really like the regenyei far more, it excels in all areas except perhaps the thrust. in australia where I live, a custom regenyei costs half of what a custom darkwood set me back.   my vote - get the regenyei feder. its going to do everything you seem to be after.   get side rings. historical swords had them. you can ask regenyei to put a ring on only one side if you want to get all german and thumb the schilt. even with hand protection the rings help reduce the chance of damage that might otherwise put you out of training. i think more time drilling/bouting is better then any hypothetical bad habbits. I also need my hands to work and want to feel secure that my hobby will not impact my livelihood.  eventually you will need to get a mask, gamberson, proper longsword gloves, rigid forearm/elbow/knee protection. spes can supply all of those in one hit, go with a rigid gorget from somewhere else. hockey ones are ok.  priority is mask and gloves."
wma,3bj95p,fruitybix,3,Tue Jun 30 04:36:27 2015 UTC,"I can definitely vouch for Regenyei's feders.  We got some a month ago, and found them very sturdy, feel very nice to move around, and after a month or so of heavy sparring, they have only gotten a couple of scratches on them (no burring, no need for filing down any deformations).  He's also really good with custom work, with multiple different grips, pommels, shilts and crossguards available (rings too)."

And maybe we should have a sticky about this, as it seems quite recurring."

wma,3bj95p,Tymerion,3,Tue Jun 30 11:40:31 2015 UTC,"Seems to me when you are learning technique, you want the simplest practice tool you can get. One, you don't want the weapon you are learning with to ingrain bad habits, and two, there is no guarantee that the style you are interested when you start, is what you are going to be interested in two years from now.  Keep it simple. Get a simple training longsword and if you end up still wanting the complex hilt a year or two down the road, THEN get the fancy blade.  EDIT: Keeping your hands safe is more about proper technique and holding your weapon correctly. Complex hilts and iron gloves in a drilling setting allows you to keep bad habits that you otherwise would have gotten rid of quickly. OF COURSE you should wear hand protection when sparring. :P"
wma,3bj95p,warriorneedsfood,2,Mon Jun 29 23:41:06 2015 UTC,"First of all, there's a reason everyone's recommending Regenyei.  Secondly, rings. I've seen a fair number of fractured hand bones in seven years doing this. Some would have been prevented by side rings, many wouldn't. Until I got SparringGloves, I was grateful for a double-ringed feder that prevented some shots on the crossguard from coming just that little bit further onto my hand.  Now, I still use a single side-ringed feder, but I find the difference minimal. Go with rings if you want to, if you're aware about where the blades are going you'll know when you made an error and the ring saved you, but skip the injury!"
wma,3bj95p,GenUni,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:26:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips everyone.   I'm going with a Regenyei feder, with a leather scabbard. (The scabbard is mostly because it's cool - but also because I'll need something to carry the sword to training sessions... I don't think the police/public would take kindly to a naked blade being paraded around, even if it is blunt).   Speaking of which, what do you use to carry your sword in public? (I'm not going to have it with me when I go to the shops or anything, I'm just referring to those instances when you need to take the bus to go to a local WMA sparring session, for example.) Ski bags, or...? A scabbard is cool and practical, but it's not exactly discreet.  I'd still love to get a blunt longsword at some point... just to have around the house and occasionally play around with.  But who knows, once I start training with the local club, I might end up falling in love with rapiering, and give up the longsword altogether, so for now, before I splurge on a bunch of superfluous shit, I'll save my money and stick to the basics (longsword feder + scabbard + hockey gloves)."

wma,3bky8t,grauenwolf,2,Tue Jun 30 02:47:11 2015 UTC,So for your club part of the solution is to cross train in arts with a similar purpose or from the same tradition? I can see how that would provide context for movements that may be difficult to discern in a vacuum so to speak.   Out of curiosity why would clubs be skeptical of using multiple texts from the same tradition. If they were from the at least the same tradition it seems like it would be an excellent way to flesh out gaps or ambiguities in each text.
