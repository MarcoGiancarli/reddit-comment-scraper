AdorableDragons,31b8uh,ViaLatteaArt,2,Fri Apr 3 14:29:26 2015 UTC,"Nice! This would likely get a lot of good attention at /r/httyd, so you might consider x-posting it there."

AdorableDragons,31855l,Vilabi,5,Thu Apr 2 19:31:49 2015 UTC,Very cute! I wonder what kind of book he's reading.
AdorableDragons,311iwl,Vilabi,5,Wed Apr 1 10:55:32 2015 UTC,"For fans of the series, /r/temeraire is a thing, although quite inactive. (But we can start posting and give it some life!)"
AdorableDragons,311iwl,Mithent,5,Wed Apr 1 11:30:38 2015 UTC,"I just need to catch up with Crucible of Gold and Blood of Tyrants before I can go exploring things to do with Temeraire, what with avoiding spoilers..."
AdorableDragons,311iwl,fiveforchaos,5,Wed Apr 1 14:31:41 2015 UTC,"I need to catch up on Blood of Tyrants, and I should be good. I wish there was a larger fan community. I hope PJ actually makes that mini-series he said he might do. I can see it pulling in more fans if promoted well enough."
AdorableDragons,311iwl,fiveforchaos,3,Wed Apr 1 16:36:21 2015 UTC,"I think part of the issue is that so few people know of the books to begin with. I hadn't heard of them myself until only a few months ago.  The series is definitely enjoyable, so if more people know of it I imagine the fan community would grow pretty rapidly yet still be small enough to be friendly/enjoyable."
AdorableDragons,311iwl,Mithent,3,Wed Apr 1 23:07:39 2015 UTC,"Cheers, yeah, the problem is getting the word out I suppose.   So here's the question... How do we do that? Last book's coming out in 2016. If we could grow the subreddit a little that'd be something."
AdorableDragons,311iwl,Mithent,2,Wed Apr 1 23:15:06 2015 UTC,"Well, this was one of my attempts at doing so. Bascially, I figured the readers of this sub like dragons, so they might also enjoy the series. I guess posting in similar subs may also be good?   Also, I was thinking of doing a read though of the series on the subreddit (something slow, maybe one book per month or two months or something) so there could be common discussion of the topic and new readers can get in to the series. Also, that might hype people up for the last book's release."
AdorableDragons,311iwl,fiveforchaos,2,Wed Apr 1 23:57:56 2015 UTC,"Good luck with your efforts! I think we have some similar interests, anyway - I've seen you on /r/httyd too. That subreddit is quite different now to how I first remember it, and has done very well. (On the other hand, on the dragon-riding side, I'm also subscribed to /r/pern, which is very quiet - but also isn't really of the Zeitgeist.)"
AdorableDragons,311iwl,Gramis,2,Thu Apr 2 23:40:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Yes, I sometimes post over in /r/httyd. I've never read the pern series. I should look in to that."
AdorableDragons,311iwl,IAMA_dragon-AMA,2,Fri Apr 3 00:02:57 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! I believe it was a significant inspiration for Naomi Novik; possibly I heard that in this interview, although I can't quite remember. It's the quintessential ""dragonrider"" series (as you might suspect, I particularly enjoy anything portraying dragons as something other than traditional antagonists), although sometimes a bit dated in its attitudes.  I haven't read any of them in some time, but I do have fond memories of my time roleplaying on PernMUSH when I was younger. Of course, the days of those sorts of text-based things being popular are mostly past. It's also been optioned for a theatrical production for a while, though, so we shall see if either series makes it there! I'd certainly be keen to see either or both, if well-done."

AdorableDragons,2t0pr6,chalkchick0,2,Tue Jan 20 08:50:41 2015 UTC,"I made it :) My son was complaining of a cold neck so we sat down and found a pattern he liked. I used the pattern found at the Six Little Mice blog. It's got some tougher spots, but I haven't been crocheting very long at all (under a year) and it worked up pretty quickly."

AdorableDragons,2nkgjd,Kytalie,2,Wed Dec 3 05:08:51 2014 UTC,I found this while seeking content for /r/purple_lavender but have also seen their work while seeking for /r/TealBlue . I think they choose a color then just go from there. Unbelievably talented and creative with an amazing sense of compatible colors. Not one of the pieces I saw had any clashing colors. They could switch to fashion design without missing a beat but I hope they don't. Kind of looks like they are made of candy which makes sense because they are so sweet. :)
AdorableDragons,2nkgjd,Kytalie,2,Wed Dec 3 06:06:44 2014 UTC,"I agree! They are so sweet I could eat them all up.  I am surprised the smaller ones are so low a price.  For something that unique, I was expecting more money because smaller work is so much more difficult to do. It seems they also do some cute things like sleeping dragon nightlights.  I don't need a nightlight, but I want one. http://www.zazzle.ca/sleeping_baby_dragon_nightlight_blue_nite_light-256586065429148358"
