chinchilla,3e0rpe,5chinnychinchins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:33:27 2015 UTC,Thank you...my gf said it happened very suddenly...it was very humid where she lives and it came out of nowhere.
chinchilla,3e0rpe,ThatKingsFan,3,Tue Jul 21 02:56:58 2015 UTC,"My girl made it through a respiratory infection about a year and a half ago. She had multiple nebulizer treatments and oral antibiotics. It was very touch and go, and our vet was up front that she only had about a 50/50 chance.   Good luck, we'll be thinking of you guys."
chinchilla,3e0rpe,ThatKingsFan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:39:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your reply and well wishes. The chinch is just laying on the bottom of her cage with no movement. The vet said even if we gave her antibiotics the moment she stopped taking them she would probably die, because it would be the only thing that  was keeping her alive. Did your vet also administer the nebulizer treatments?"
chinchilla,3e0rpe,DPleskin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:56:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, they administered the nebulizer treatments in office."
chinchilla,3e0rpe,GuenevereJames,2,Tue Jul 21 03:06:17 2015 UTC,Thank you...My gf gave her lethargic chinch a mix of pedialyte/gatorade and said she responded to it. So shes going to vet to get meds...any tips for administration/ or anything else you think might help are greatly appreciated....thank you again so much!!
chinchilla,3e0rpe,DeathHaze420,4,Tue Jul 21 03:23:08 2015 UTC,My girls have been given the death sentence about 5 times for everything from head trauma to GI stasis that lasted several weeks. They're all still kicking. I havent dealt with respiratory infection yet but chinchillas are tougher than the vets give them credit for. Just keep your chin up(get it?) and keep up with the meds and giving her lots of love. GL to you guys.
chinchilla,3e0rpe,Kazz1234,2,Tue Jul 21 04:18:57 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely not a vet, but make sure you don't mix things with the medications unless you've been told by the vet that you can. My chin likes the pedialyte freeze pops, though, and would see them as a bit of a treat, so I would try to get him to realize that if he took the medicine, he would get a treat afterwards."
chinchilla,3dysos,brittafiltaperry,2,Mon Jul 20 17:10:21 2015 UTC,"Mine had teeth clipped and part of a tooth extracted.  For the first two days after he was really out of it because of the drugs, not wanting to eat much food, sleeping most of the time, unsure about jumping to ledges.  After that he went back to being perfectly normal. No difference in eating or hay/twig chewing.  Plus the vet gave me his tooth in a little baggie and I made so many Chinchilla Tooth Fairy jokes with her."
chinchilla,3dysos,julieacts,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:38 2015 UTC,"Tooth extractions are not advisable, because it creates a gap that other teeth would move into causing further issues with the teeth and their alignment. Once the alignment is messed up there is no correcting it, unfortunately chinchilla braces don't exist. Most forms of dental issues with chinchillas are not curable and treatment tends to just prolong the inevitable, they will need consistent maintenance.    Information about dental issues."

chinchilla,3dv2nf,Kazz1234,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:32:59 2015 UTC,So is the Extreme Mosaic thing genetic at all? Or is it just random when you are breeding for whites?
chinchilla,3dv2nf,Kjerikaye,0,Mon Jul 20 14:38:13 2015 UTC,"Extreme Mosaic is just a descriptive term to separate them from other whites for the pet market. Genetically, he's a white. He could be a ebony white. A tov white. or just a really dark phased mosaic ( mosaic is general for grey x white ) but all a dominant white. It's random to get a heavily marked chin, though it's more common with ebony-white or tov-whites"

chinchilla,3dtx3p,Love_and_Light,3,Sun Jul 19 12:46:49 2015 UTC,"She seems very happy in her new home! Played with her in our bathroom for a little over an hour yesterday and at first she was coming around sniffing me, but towards the end just stayed in a little corner and would go under the laundry sacks. When we turned out the light she went to her hanging bed and snuggled right in. My they are poop machines!! I haven't seen her drink yet, the water bottle is a little leaky so the amount that is gone I'm not sure if it's from her or the leak. I'll be getting a new bottle today. She's eating and hopping around like crazy! Today she jumped into my palms that I cupped in front of her and started to crawl up my arm. I'm in love! No name yet, it hasn't called to us! I've read much, but not sure how often to give her a treat (Cheerios or raisins etc). Any advice and feedback is welcomed and appreciated! Thank you!! :)"
chinchilla,3dtx3p,Larakine,2,Sun Jul 19 12:53:41 2015 UTC,"She seems absolutely adorable! They do like to poop and get dust everywhere, they also like to chew on practically anything & everything (including books, sometimes whilst you're reading them). All of which is totally worth it.  With regards to treats I'm sure you've already read about this but you want to stick to dehydrated things and consider her dental health/sugar intake."
chinchilla,3dtx3p,TooferToofs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:31:17 2015 UTC,She's so sweet and so outgoing! Warming up to us really fast! Thank you for the advice! I'm going to go into town and grab some treats later on!
chinchilla,3dtx3p,TooferToofs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:01:52 2015 UTC,"It's great that she has an awesome personality! This is the best time to handle them and talk to them since they are so young and curious. A lot of poop is good!   I would recommend little to no play time because she is so young. Once she is a bit older (I believe 6 months is the right time), 15 minutes is the max amount of playtime. They are cute to watch, but they need this time to grow and develop. Once they hit a year old, they can start to run around for around 30 minutes. An hour isn't necessary.  As for treats, no raisins, cheerios, vegetables, or fruit. Here is a great list of treats"
chinchilla,3dtx3p,Dalisca,2,Tue Jul 21 04:18:30 2015 UTC,"I read about no play time this morning! I'm glad you said something too though, thank you!! I'll keep playtime to a very small amount of time, like 5 minutes while I brush my teeth at night, and then gradually build it up after 6 months. I appreciate the advice!"
chinchilla,3dtx3p,Dalisca,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:37 2015 UTC,I have a great feeling she's going to be happy with you! I'm so glad you're so excited! Be sure to post pictures!!

chinchilla,3dojg1,tink12ann,2,Sat Jul 18 00:25:43 2015 UTC,"He reminds me of the guiney pigs with the whorls in that last pic. Such a cute little fuzzball.  Does he enjoy human interaction? What does the new fur feel like compared to the ""original"" fur"
chinchilla,3dojg1,DeathHaze420,2,Sat Jul 18 00:36:41 2015 UTC,"He absolutely HATES being picked up or stroked when he's out in playtime, but is more than happy to receive chin scratches through the bars of the cage. I think this is due to mistreatment from previous owner and the mesh separating us makes him feel safer, so cant blame him really! He lets me hold him for about 5 seconds before he gets a bit antsy so i try and keep handling to a minimum, but every few days i will give him a butt massage of sorts to make sure the fur isn't matted at all. Before it was so short and coarse, almost like when you wash your hair but don't use conditioner or brush it for days, and there was only just enough fur to cover his skin. He's  now he's so soft and fluffy i'd stroke him all day if he let me :3"

chinchilla,3dhv8b,Rrrrbepirates,5,Thu Jul 16 12:03:12 2015 UTC,"A few questions. How hot is the room he or she is in? Was it just playtime or was she ""bouncing off the walls"" before the loafing? Have you tried putting up the NO LOAFING poster? LOL  It's probably nothing. She is probably just extra tired. Especially if it was just playtime or really hot today. Mine will lie down on her side a few times a week, but it seems like she is resting and not trying to sleep. She will watch me as I move about the room and spring into cute-action when I move too close to the cage."
chinchilla,3dhv8b,DeathHaze420,5,Thu Jul 16 12:27:37 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell the room was relatively cool compared to outside. No idea about how bouncy he was before though. Will pass the message on though, thank you :-)"
chinchilla,3dhv8b,Kjerikaye,6,Thu Jul 16 13:04:43 2015 UTC,He may have just discovered a new way to be comfortable. One of my chinchillas sleeps like that. It always freaks me out! The others lie that way when they are hot after an exuberant play time.
chinchilla,3dhv8b,TooferToofs,2,Thu Jul 16 13:51:48 2015 UTC,If you notice a difference in their breathing or their ears are pink/red then he is too hot. Some chinchillas just find the craziest ways to get comfy!
chinchilla,3dhv8b,Mlmkiniry,5,Thu Jul 16 15:49:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with double checking the temp.  Also, does he have a granite stone to cool off on? My Nibbler sleeps in the loaf position most of the time, but occassionally sleeps on his side, we call that one ""the dead squirrel"" position."
chinchilla,3dhv8b,alduhkneel,6,Thu Jul 16 14:19:01 2015 UTC,"Both my chinchillas sleep like that especially in their beds. They started after they felt comfortable enough to lay on their sides without feeling ""vulnerable"" lol"
chinchilla,3dhv8b,DeathHaze420,4,Thu Jul 16 18:00:51 2015 UTC,I definitely agree that its a vulnerable position to put themselves in and is probably a sign of trust.  I'm still too slow to get a good pic of her napping on her side tho lol
chinchilla,3dhv8b,alduhkneel,5,Thu Jul 16 21:09:28 2015 UTC,You have to be so stealth it's crazy! I snapped this one recently.. He had his eyes closed then he half opened one of them when he heard the shutter snap loll http://i.imgur.com/mYx9lqB.jpg

chinchilla,3dhv8b,Fora_Fauna,4,Thu Jul 16 22:08:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely a sign of trust. My chin didn't start sleeping on his side while I was in the room until I'd had him a while. Now he'll go sleep on his side even if I make a loud noise (I keep dropping my phone) and just look up and go back to sleep. I was worried it meant he was overheating, but he does it in the winter too and he doesn't have any of the overheating symptoms. He also doesn't mind me tickling his feet because sometimes he sticks them right up against the bars of the cage."

But on the really hot days where the AC runs constantly and doesn't make a dent, I point a little fan at my chinch. I also have a big piece of granite that I put in the freezer each night and give her to cool off on before I leave for the day."
chinchilla,3dhwm1,browneth,2,Thu Jul 16 13:41:13 2015 UTC,"I know some people have some pretty expensive electric bills during the summer because they need to have their house cool for their chinchillas. Other than AC, you can have a fan but don't point it directly at them. There are people who sell fleece covers for those little lunchbox ice packs so they're chinchilla can have a soft, cool spot to sit on. Granite slabs work well if you let them sit in the freezer or fridge. I know Sallywood on Facebook sells the fleece covers and lunchbox freezer pack things."

chinchilla,3dhwm1,rosengold,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:58:48 2015 UTC,"I've heard that said a lot, and it makes sense given their thick fur, but wouldn't it help even the tiniest bit around the ears? That's a high surface area part of the body with a regular bloodflow and no insulation.  (Apples to oranges example, elephants can cool their body temperature by 10 degrees f just by flapping their ears - obviously chinchilla ears aren't really comparable, but it's a fun fact!)"
chinchilla,3dhwm1,Kaworu_Rebooted,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:01:06 2015 UTC,"Chinchillas don't sweat. The cooling sensation we get from fans is from the sweat our bodies produce evaporate. A fan will only circulate hot or cold air around depending on the temperature of the air in the room. If it hot, its just going to blow hot air at your chinchilla. Elephants sweat."
chinchilla,3dhwm1,rosengold,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:37:06 2015 UTC,"I thought that they didn't, but I wasn't 100% sure. I didn't know if the air movement would really help, but I figured it would help make the air less stuffy."

I closed the vents to her room and use the AC unit instead, so if it's cold I can still use the heat and I don't have to keep it really cold in the house at all times. Since I did that I noticed a huge drop in my electric bill."
chinchilla,3dhwm1,badwolf7850,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:50:03 2015 UTC,Personally I have AC but sometimes I can turn it off for +10 hours depending on the day but also by doing everything to keep the house cool. I use to just leave my computer on all the time even when I left but now I'll shut it off when I leave and make sure its cleaned out with compressed air about once every two weeks so when it is on it doesn't blow hot air out. I'll also hold off on laundry so the dryer doesn't heat up the house and hold off on vacuuming (which actually blows a ton of hot air (I didn't even realize till I got my babies) and use a hand pushed dirt picker upper thingy.

However mine don't really care which way you stroke them. The minute you touch their ears or behind their head they dart. My friend's two females absolutely love being pet under the chin and will actively approach me in the cage with their heads raised. My boys just try to nibble my fingers or push them away when i try touching their chins! It makes me wonder if it's something with the different sexes. I'll be interested to see others' replies.  In regards to holding one of my boys is really calm when being held and the other can handle it only if he is currently enjoying a snack. Once the snack is done he enjoys sending his parents into panic mode by making leaps of faith out of our arms. I really hope to one day have a chin that enjoys being cradled on their back. Seeing the occasional picture posted here always makes me so jealous! My boys are NOT fans of being on their backs, tried it once and it distressed them way too much to every try again."
chinchilla,3da18a,djh3315,3,Tue Jul 14 18:48:28 2015 UTC,Nice! I can't imagine getting ours on theirs backs. Both of ours are pretty tempramental about a chin scratch. Sometimes it's good and sometimes they scoot back an inch so you can't reach them anymore.
chinchilla,3da18a,tadoke,3,Tue Jul 14 19:19:08 2015 UTC,""" My boys just try to nibble my fingers or push them away when i try touching their chins! "" Similar with mine when attempting chin scratches. However, my chin Peanut will grab firmly onto my finger expressing a very strong ' no ' :)"
chinchilla,3da18a,dxm765,3,Tue Jul 14 20:22:00 2015 UTC,"My 2 boys love there chins scratched and between the ears, they're not big fans of petting towards there backs or hips, although they make funny noises if you let there backs. My youngest is much more willing to be pet, and will fall asleep if you scratch his chin long enough. On the other end my oldest will let you scratch his chin only after he samples you to see if you taste good, and sometimes he'll bite me good but that's ok because I get to pet him :P"
chinchilla,3da18a,Mlmkiniry,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:51:32 2015 UTC,"We have never been able to get ours to be pet until thy sleep! Even at their best it's about a 30sec maximum before they just hop off to do something else. They nibble us sometimes too but hardly bite hard unless I just ate some fruit and they smell it on me, haha."

chinchilla,3da18a,Thunderbro_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:36:13 2015 UTC,"She tolerates it, at best. She enjoys chin scratches for 10 seconds. Lets me pet her for about 15 and then its treats or Eff off.  But whenever I put oats in her dish I get to tickle her belly. She bats my hand away. But I keep ticking her.  Oh, and every so often she will put her butt to the cage and stick her tail through for me to stroke. That usually lasts the longest at roughly 30 seconds of pets lol. But she hasn't done that in a while now... :( I like the feel of their tails."
chinchilla,3da18a,Sextooth,3,Tue Jul 14 21:16:59 2015 UTC,"Ours do the butt thing too but God help you if you touch the tail. You get a 'merp' sound and they're off, haha. Food is the only way we get belly rubs too :( It's my fav. part"
chinchilla,3da18a,_ataraxia,3,Tue Jul 14 21:35:05 2015 UTC,"Mine tolerate it, haha. If I put my hand up to them, they sniff at it for a bit, then rear onto  their hind legs for belly rubs. If they are too sleepy or grumpy, they will usually shove my hands away with all their teensy, fuzzy might."
chinchilla,3da18a,TooferToofs,3,Tue Jul 14 22:06:16 2015 UTC,"I've only had Pinky and Brain for a few months so I'm still learning what they like/tolerate in regards to petting.  Brain seems ok with chin scratches and belly rubs if he is in the right mood.  Generally he is ok with being pet on his back as long as you are gentle.  If you pet his hips he'll immediately turn his head at you sniff your fingers for a couple seconds then quickly turn around.  He is ok about being held for maybe a minute after that he'll start to get pretty jumpy.  Pinky generally seems to like being pet on his back and hips.  I've tried to do a chin scratch and belly rub on him but for the most part he doesn't seem to like it.  He seems ok with being pet on his neck in between his ears.  He is good with being held and will generally be fairly calm for a few minutes before he starts getting jumpy.    I agree with what someone else said, I'm always very jealous when people post pictures of their chinchillas on their backs, sleeping in their arms etc (neither Pinky or Brain would ever do that).  Makes me wonder if that was just luck of the draw, or if it's more how they were raised as they were growing up."
chinchilla,3d9v9y,Greediseternal,3,Tue Jul 14 17:05:29 2015 UTC,"Neutral territory is great, isn't it?"
chinchilla,3d9v9y,bella26piano,3,Tue Jul 14 17:56:20 2015 UTC,Nailed it! Chinchillas are pretty territorial so doing introductions in a place with a neutral scent (or even thoroughly sanitizing the cage) will go much smoother! Neither chinchilla feels like they are having their space invaded. I am quite amazed that the introduction went this smoothly though. Congrats on your two pairs! Do you ever let them play together (under watchful eye) in neutral space? Not sure if you have that much room available but it would be interesting to see if they can get along all together!
chinchilla,3d9v9y,djh3315,2,Tue Jul 14 18:54:21 2015 UTC,I haven't tried messing the two pairs yet because I was nervous but I am gonna try to find a super neutral place by taking them over to a friends house who doesn't have any pets and use the small pet play pen there. I am nervous about it but if they could all get along together that would be amazing! I could totally move my work space out of the room the eldest pair is in and make the whole room theirs! Thanks for the advice! <3
chinchilla,3d9v9y,rosengold,2,Tue Jul 14 21:02:01 2015 UTC,"If you're not careful you can cause the current bonded pairs to break by introducing more chins. If you have 2 pairs, i'd just be happy with that, otherwise you could end up with 4 singles."

I would just replace any pieces that have been chewed on significantly.   Wooden pegs and non-toxic wood glue works like nezhka and rosengold said. The only thing with what I did is that if they chew far enough into the wood, they will hit the screw. I just have to keep a close eye and make sure I switch the wood out when it gets really worn down."

chinchilla,3d7lcu,spirouspip,3,Tue Jul 14 03:29:58 2015 UTC,"I'm near philly as well, but i was traveling too and from TX for work, for roughly 4 months...i would fly out Sunday nights and return Fridays around 10PM-midnight..it was rough, but thankfully my girlfriend took care of my boys and grew very attached to them, thankfully now i am local again and the 2 of us let the boys out to play each evening.   I would see if a friend would be willing to come over while youre at work and let him out to play, i'd be torn if i had to give up my boys and i would be sure i made time for them....which isnt always easy. Right now while i am local i work 10 hour days, so at night if my gf isnt up to letting them out, i will take my iPad in there room, let them out, and i will sit on my ipad doing my thing until one of them tries to eat it, or sit on it...which i then know they want to interact with me rather then each other or the toys."
chinchilla,3d7lcu,dxm765,3,Tue Jul 14 04:06:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, chinchillas don't need playtime every night. They don't even need an hour. My chinchillas get to run around for about 30 minutes every other night while I clean their cages.   If you feel as if you can't be there enough to feed, clean, and socialize a bit, than maybe you do need to consider rehoming. I do know there are some breeders in Pennsylvania, but I'm not sure if they all do rescues or what their requirements are. Please be very careful if you plan on rehoming. So many people can put on an act or have great intentions, but end up neglecting the animal. Definitely have a fee, and ask about people's experience with chinchillas. Let them inform you, and not the other way around so you really know that they know what they are talking about. If you have any friends or family who are willing to give them a home, maybe he can stay there and you can just cover his expenses.  Hopefully you can find a solution"
chinchilla,3d7lcu,TooferToofs,3,Tue Jul 14 07:05:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I play with my chins every 2-3 days for 30-45 mins, and have a lot of in-cage entertainment for them, and they seem to be fine. For a solo chin I'd give them more attention, but my fluffs love each other way more than they love me."
chinchilla,3d7lcu,Skrilmaufive,2,Tue Jul 14 13:28:37 2015 UTC,"I agree that he will be fine without all that out of cage time. Maybe just get him some extra chew toys for his cage so he has something extra fun to do while you are out. If I have a night where I don't have time for out of cage time, I leave the radio on for them over night. I think they like the music.  When I'm out of town, I have a friend and her daughters who come and look in on them and let them out occasionally. That works really well.  : )"
chinchilla,3d7x1w,Inquisitions,3,Tue Jul 14 05:17:29 2015 UTC,all you can do is block their access. use an exercise pen instead of giving them full run of the room.
chinchilla,3d7x1w,_ataraxia,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:26:22 2015 UTC,"Basically what ataraxia said. A play pen (which many people have), or using a way to block the chinchillas from certain areas by using cardboard. If you use cardboard, make sure you take it from the side they don't have access too. You can go to grocery stores and ask for boxes that they don't want. You can try calling some retail stores and asking if they have any large boxes that you can have (that's where I got mine)."
chinchilla,3d7x1w,TooferToofs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:24:50 2015 UTC,"I second the cardboard comment.  I've sort of ""trained"" mine to stop chewing when I make a certain noise (the ek ek bad dog noise and snapping my fingers), but sometimes they ignore me lol.  The only sure-fire way to prevent chewing is to remove access."
chinchilla,3d7x1w,Nezhka,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:58:26 2015 UTC,I googled some examples of this and looks like just the solution I was looking for! Thank you!
chinchilla,3d7x1w,Sextooth,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:32:30 2015 UTC,"One thing you can try is some anti-chew deterrent (like this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QHRMOPO?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage).  You can just spray it on the walls and it won't damage the paint or anything.  It's been pretty good at keeping Pinky and Brain in check in regards to chewing my bathroom walls, but there still are a couple spots on the walls that they seem to find irresistible for some reason.  I spray it on my bathroom walls about once a week."

chinchilla,3d1z6j,Wavyayeee,2,Sun Jul 12 21:41:58 2015 UTC,"Two chins is better than one! No but seriously having a friend/playmate for your chinchilla is a great idea. You will get to see them cuddle and play together in the most adorable ways! As you own a female you will have to watch out when introducing the two. Females can be more aggressive and are known to shoot pee at each other (and everything else in their field of vision). When introducing the two you shouldn't keep them in one cage until they get used to each other. Your first chinchilla views her current cage as her home and having another female suddenly cohabitating can lead to some serious violence! And from the new chinchilla's perspective being in a place that has so many unfamiliar scents can be overwhelming and lead to some anxiety/fur biting (not to mention potential attacks from the current resident!). I recommend having two cages and placing them pretty close to each other. Keep them a few inches apart, you may want to base the distance on how far they can launch their pee haha. As you watch them during play time you will get a feel for how well they are interacting. Once the fighting/peeing mostly stops (they may still nip at each other to show dominance) place their cages next to each other (bars touching). Finally. when you see them sleeping next to each other through the cage bars you are probably good to house them together. When you place them in their cage be sure to thoroughly clean it so that it has a more neutral scent. This may be a more cautious method but i have had success with it in my situation with my boys (no pee for the males!) and with my friend's females (pee everywhere). Despite how long it can potentially take its great to watch them form their bonds!  In terms of size of the cage the side bar for this subreddit recommends a 24”L X 18”W X 24”H minimum. I recently purchased a ferret nation cage (http://www.amazon.com/Midwest-Ferret-Nation-Double-Stand/dp/B0054U8UGW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436739249&sr=8-1&keywords=Ferret+Nation). It is insanely large and sturdy and my boys LOVE the space. Obviously you may not be able to afford something so nice. I recommend reading up on some of the side bar material. They have a lot of great links!  Cheers, Daniel"
chinchilla,3d1z6j,djh3315,2,Sun Jul 12 22:19:22 2015 UTC,"Some rescues/breeders I think can also do pair bonding for you, if you want to avoid having to maintain two cages while they get used to each other. Never done it myself, but remember seeing it on a couple websites when I was initially researching getting a chinchilla."
chinchilla,3d1z6j,Sextooth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:16:43 2015 UTC,"Chinchillas can be very happy by themselves. I have one chinchilla by herself and she if very bonded to me, but my two that are together are very bonded to each other. They are still friendly, but lean on each other more than me. Some chinchillas will never get along, so consider the fact that you may have to clean 2 cages, have 2 play times, need double the food, etc. You need to quarantine the new chinchilla for a month in case they may be carrying anything that can transmit to your chinchilla. Once all is clear, you can put their cages in the same room, then after they settle move the cages closer after they have adjusted (leaving room in between the cages so they cannot bite noses or fingers). You should let them share a dust bath so they can smell the other chinchilla and have the others smell on them. I've heard of people switching the chinchillas from one cage to the other so once you move one to the other. You should let them play in a neutral area so neither of them know where they are and can't claim the area as theirs. Make sure there are plenty of hiding spaces. Make sure there is no chasing, and if there is you need to stop it. If they start fighting then they need to go back to their cages, and you should try again later.    Honestly, there are a lot of different methods that have worked differently for people. Like I said, some chinchillas may never get along. I've heard that chinchillas can turn on their cage mate at anytime, so you need to make sure you monitor them. Two chinchillas in the same cage also means two water bottles, two food dishes, different huts to hide in, and more space."

I know after I  got my second ""female"" chin I felt a lot better knowing that my first little girl had someone to play with and cuddle up with when I wasn't around. I personally noticed my chin was much happier with a friend. This may sound pretty derpy but make sure you're absolutely sure you know the gender before you buy the chin. I went by what the worker said (assuring me it was another female) Needless to say, I ended up with 4 babies! Best of luck if you decide to expand your chin family :)"
chinchilla,3d1xn9,liv3408,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:29:23 2015 UTC,"Sucks that this has to happen to your poor chinnie, with tooth elongation there's NO cure but I'm sure you've looked into it a lot ( if not here's a link : http://letslovechinchillas.weebly.com/teeth.html )   I wouldn't try hiding her meds in a unsafe treat ( raisins ) because that can cause other issues with her GI tract. You def can try putting it in a gojiberry instead though. It would actually be an okay treat in this situation with the bonus it gives.   Otherwise there's a few methods you can use to hold her still till you can get her to take her meds ( unless she takes it willfully. ) here's a link with a few safe ways to try to immobilize her to give her some CC and meds. ( http://letslovechinchillas.weebly.com/proper-handling.html )   Chins who need CC need about 60ml a day to maintain weight. It does come in other flavors. 1, starts with an A but I can't recall. The antibiotics upsets your chinchilla which makes them not want to eat, plus the pain from surgery makes them reject food.   Also, ask your vet to supply a pain killer and a probiotic. This will help your pet feel better sooner. The probiotic reestablishes good flora in the gut that the antibiotic kills.   Best of luck!   Please note: the website is under construction so more is to come."
chinchilla,3d1xn9,rosengold,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:48:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Lots of good info. I have gotten so many different pieces of feedback about giving raisins as treats, but my chin has gotten like one or two a day for her whole life and is totally fine (EDIT: I mean, except for this teeth thing, but I've only heard that raisins could cause GI problems). My vet never mentioned it being bad. I know lots of raisins (like 3+/day?) will definitely give them belly issues, but I've never heard of them being unsafe. I've never heard of using gojiberries either -- I'll have to ask my vet about that! That would be great if she liked them! The other flavor of critical care is ""anise"". I may try it this time around because she absolutely hates the apple banana flavor."
chinchilla,3d1xn9,5chinnychinchins,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:44:39 2015 UTC,"While a raisin a day doesn't hurt in the present, it still causes irreversible damage and chins fed poorly are expected to have a lower life expectancy. Raisins are a nightmare. In the early days of chins kept as pets it was a common treat and often recommended. That's why vets still recommend it, but times have changed. Breeders have made connections. Some vets have ran tests on certain animals that had issues and have concluded that they do cause issues with glucose levels in the system. Raisins are sugary, and not even good for human consumption. Plus they offer no dietary pros and are high in potassium which is also bad for chins as they need little potassium.  1 a day, 2 a day, 3 a day.... All not okay. The gojiberries are lower in sugar and contain a lot of antioxidants and vitamins. They at least offer dietary pro. They should be limited to one ever other day or so though. A daily treat would be something like a pinch of old fashion rolled oats. Please please stop feeding raisins :( especially since your pet already has dental issues - that alone shortens the life expectancy.   I hope you've had some luck treating your chinny and giving meds. You can always pm me for more help on my page. I'm not always the fastest to respond here."

I tried grape juice with mine today and she really hated it...maybe cranberry is more similar to the flavor of raisins? Does your chin love raisins too?

chinchilla,3cyuuz,risingphoenix73,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:51:17 2015 UTC,Please consider getting a non plastic wheel. Plastic is toxic for chinchillas
chinchilla,3cyuuz,zoglog,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:07:16 2015 UTC,"It's not that it's toxic, it's that if ingested it can cause blockage within their intestines. Not only is the wheel plastic, it also doesn't allow the chinchilla to run the way they are naturally made to run.   Definitely a cute chinchilla! Just take the wheel out and invest in a chinsafe one (look at the sidebar for safe wheels)."
chinchilla,3cyuuz,TooferToofs,2,Tue Jul 14 06:47:55 2015 UTC,"We are actually making our own wheel because the highly recommended metal ones are nothing but a metal feed bin mounted on a lazy Suzanne and there is no way I am paying for something I could make for $10 in half an hour. Our Chins have so much other things to chew that they do not chew on plastic. The wheel will be made shortly and will be double wide so that both our Chins can run side by side, which they try to do now."
chinchilla,3cyuuz,TooferToofs,0,Fri Jul 17 01:16:18 2015 UTC,"Just a suggestion. The wheels that are listed are made by people who have ""perfected"" it in a sense. I would go against your idea of making the wheel big enough for both chinchillas to run on it. If one were to hop on while the other was running on it, or one stopped while the other was still running, it could cause an injury.   I'm honestly not sure about home-made wheels and how they work, but if you find out that it is absolutely safe, make sure you get the dimensions right. The wheel you have in their cage now is too small for chinchillas. Take out any plastic as well. It's better to be safe than sorry."
chinchilla,3cyuuz,TooferToofs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:32:44 2015 UTC,"I understand where you are coming from. However, these Chins are babies still so the wheel size is not too small for them.  And that wheel everyone loves is home made from parts found at a farm store.  I trust myself and my own skills in building more than others, especially those who market their items as something they are not. In terms of injury with two running at once, the risk of injury is significantly higher with two attempting to run on a single chin wide wheel. Plus, there is no way what so ever to train them to not run together. Additionally, you cannot see the rest of the cage where the area directly below the wheel has soft bedding to cushion any spill that may happen.  Believe me, I am not an inexperienced owner of pets. I research everything and he studies I found from world renowned veterinary schools stated that a smaller wheel is ok until they reach their nearly full grown size, in fact several studies showed this. Additionally, I perform the same research for all of my pets to ensure optimal living environments. We have chinchillas, hedgehogs, LPS and SPS coral reef salt water aquariums, hydroponic fresh water aquariums, and a special needs, blind dog. My pets are my kids and I trust academic research to determine what is best for them."
chinchilla,3cyuuz,TooferToofs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:48:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how old they are, but if they are babies they should not have a wheel in their cage. They need their first year to be focused on growing and developing. As for making your own wheel, there are plenty of DIY wheels online, but as for the silver surfer and some more ""high-tech"" wheels I have read it's just easier to buy it. Believe me, I wasn't exactly too willing to throw 100 dollars out on a chinchilla wheel either!   I'm not saying you're a bad all around pet owner. I'm just saying to take out the plastic wheel, let your chinchillas use this time to grow, and make sure whatever you do make is going to be absolutely safe. I would like to see the studies you're talking about though!"

Vet didnt know exactly what was wrong but put her on daily antibiotics and I fed her critical care twice a day and she started to bounce back and eventually started eating on her own again.we never really knew what she had but she had started to smell sick and became very cuddly and didn't want to be alone. Once she felt better she was back to her old self.  Perhaps see if your vet will put her on some antibiotics and see if that helps.  Unfortunately my girl has also developed teeth problems and her appetite has stayed fairly low. She drools a bit now and every now and again I have to take her in to get her teeth filed. If it starts to get bad she eats a lot less so make sure your vet is checking your girls teeth as it might not be an appetite problem but a pain problem.  Good luck. I hope everything works out well.  If you don't already, do get some critical care. It's incredibly useful when a chin starts losing weight. Mine I had to force feed the first 4 or so times but eventually she loved the stuff and I would just have to hold the syringe while she went to town on it."

chinchilla,3csv63,MeaKyori,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:12:43 2015 UTC,"Weight loss can be a lot of things. Most often, dental issues.   You said the vet saw she had 1 problematic root. Root elongation is a problem, and can cause things to be uncomfortable when eating. If the root elongation is not a issue now, it WILL be in the future. Root elongation is a form of malo, and malo is not curable or able to be prolonged when its the roots. She will need regular check ups now and xrays to check her roots.   Something to rule out is bullying. Its often over looked by vets because their job is to access an ailment or wound, and not necessarily the home environment. Its something I remind my vets of often and they respond with w ""Oh yeah!"" and end up having much more ideas about what could be wrong. When 2 or more chins are kept and fed together then dominate animal sometimes bullies the other ( even if they seem loving and friendly together.  Even if they sleep together ) the dominate chinchilla may not be letting the other eat. Try feeding them separately. I've had to do this.   You mentioned feeding her a mush food ... If she lacked the desire to eat, and only became interested again when the food was made soft it would point to her teeth again. You should get your hands on some critical care for her ( mentioned above how to get it. $7Ish bucks online. Nearly $25 at my vet clinic. ) the critical care shouldn't give your chin the runs. You don't want your pet to have diarrhea ... She will become dehydrated and she won't get any benefit from what she ate. What goes in will just come right back out.   You can also give her benebac. Its a probiotic that will establish the good natural flora that belongs in her digestive system. Antibiotics kill this good flora , and the lack if this flora can case digestive upsets.   Please get another opinion about her teeth.  Many vets don't understand chinchillas as well as they flaunt about it. Out local ""specialist"" who is referred through the coast.....has seen 10 chins.  10. He's a joke."
chinchilla,3csv63,rosengold,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:27:33 2015 UTC,"As others have said losing weight/not eating can be caused by a lot of things. Tooth problems are the most obvious but any pain or discomfort, anywhere in the body, and they can stop eating.  It's part of a standard check-up but did your vet check her heart? We had a girl who had a heart murmur and losing weight was the first sign we had of it. Unfortunately we recently lost her to it, but we had many happy years with her while the treatment was working (lifelong antibiotics and supplemental feeding with critical care).  I would buy critical care online or through a pharmacy as that's nearly always cheaper than the vet's. The best syringes we've found are supreme science ones like this (sorry it's a uk link). They've got a wider nozzle and seem to take longer to wear out than the standard ones.   Good luck with the tests tomorrow. I hope they find something just so that you can try something to help your little fuzzball.  It's a good idea for every chin owner to weigh their chins regularly and keep a record of it. Because they're prey animals and don't like to show pain or weakness, weight loss is often the first and only obvious sign of something amiss. There's also huge variation in healthy size and weight between chins so it's good to know the healthy 'baseline' for each individual."

Now that I've had Cookie for 6 months, I'm still shocked how much personality he has. He is very expressive and sassy, and I didn't realize how intelligent he would be. He's only a year but was in 3 different homes before me, so his trust issues are pretty apparent. We're working through them, and I'm excited every time I notice how much progress he's making in trusting me. Chinchillas are definitely not the right pet for most people, but Cookie is right for me.

chinchilla,3ceq7e,Sextooth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:59:25 2015 UTC,"72 degrees is what is considered a max, it varries from 65 - 75 degrees max, but some chinchillas DO have a higher tolerance. It just goes by the K.I.S.S principle "" Keep. It. Simple. Stupid. "". Better to be safe than sorry ( this is a photo of one of my own chinchillas, the area around her was 80 degrees. If you have standard chinchillas, or ebonies, or a white with grey ears... basically, if your chin has grey/black ears you will not see the veins well.)   Some breeders acclimate their chins for long trips by slowly increasing the temperature, but there is a cut off limit to be safe. Chinchillas of lower quality lack fur density, and can withstand higher temperatures.  Animals with extremely dense fur obviously will retain more heat, and won't withstand the higher temperature.  Example: some very poorly bred animals are in Singapore ( not all this is just for arguments sake ) and the temperature and humidity is high there. My chins would probably die without an AC there. Their fur is too dense, but the majority of chins there have very weak fur, and it lays flat, it's silky, and not very dense. It allows the animal to deal with the warmer climate.   My information comes from breeders who breed for the pet industry ( ABC Chinchillas, Hummel, Ritterspach, Aces Up Chinchillas, Chinchilla chateau, Etc. ) all recognized and prized winning breeders who have exceptionally large herds, and do have to keep the temperature controlled well to prevent over heating in the barn / chin room or on the road.  The fur industry also recommends the cooler temperature. You're less likely to loose a chin from it being really cold than it being a bit to warm, and the lower temperatures promote thicker coats to grow in during priming.   Fans do not help chinchillas who need to cool down. The way a fan cools us down is by blowing air onto our skin, and thus evaporating the sweat on our skin. This creates the cooling sensation. Chinchillas do not sweat, so the fan only works to circulate the air... if it's hot air by the fan it'll only blow hot air - even if it feels cool to you. The ice packs and tile are commonly used for temporary solutions, but should never be the only source of direct cooling. The environment needs to be kept comfortably for the animal.   72 is okay, but once the temperature begins to rise you then risk your pet's comfort, and the higher the temperature climbs the more severe the risk becomes making it a health concern.  When you start climbing past 72 F, it can be a danger zone for MANY chinchillas."
chinchilla,3ceq7e,GuenevereJames,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:36:27 2015 UTC,"It's interesting about the factor of fur density.   My Remy has very posh dense fur. He seems to get hot more easily than his scrawny 'junk yard dog' thin furred brother Willoughby.    The house is at 70 degrees. After being returned to his cage after an hour of play time, Remy usually lays on his side for a while in his chin spin. He doesn't seem to be in distress, just tired and possibly hot.  Willoughby can be out for the same amount of time and, when returned to his cage, he is still bouncing around without any signs of fatigue or feeling hot.   In a hot climate, it COULD be that breeding chinchillas with thinner fur might actually be to the advantage of the animals, even though their looks don't match our perception of the ideal chinchilla."
chinchilla,3cf3tj,rosengold,3,Tue Jul 7 12:35:57 2015 UTC,"Because Chinchillas do not run, they hop and jump, they need a wheel with a wider diameter. 14"" is the smallest recommended size, and no its not available at a pet store. Pet stores only offer 12"" max. 14"" is the minimum, but if you have a larger chinchilla you may need to purchase a 15"" or 16"" wheel.   The reason they need this space is so they can extend fully as they leap, otherwise they're forced to run in an unnatural position that causes damage and discomfort.   Some pet store wheels come with bars which stretch through the center , again causing an unnatural arch in your chins back as they leap. Causing discomfort.   The reason bar and grid wheels are not recommended is the risk of breaking toes, arms, and tails. It simply isn't worth it. Breaks in Chinchillas end up turning into amputations which are not cheap to perform. Its better to not have a wheel than provide an unsafe option.   You can find a list of safe wheels on the sidebar. Silver surfer, chinspin, leobraun, flying saucer , happychilla wheels, etc."

chinchilla,3c8v11,rosengold,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:55:05 2015 UTC,I cover it in fleece or make a fleece slip cover for it. You can also avoid condensation by rubbing it with a cloth before putting it in the cage.
chinchilla,3c8v11,Capt_Thunderbolt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:35:03 2015 UTC,"I've been reading about chinchillas for a while and have been wondering if anyone has any experience with raising just one chinchilla versus raising two that are from the same litter together. I just wonder if one chinchilla alone would be happy. I'd prefer to just have one if possible because I would think it would be easier and would be slightly less costly. I'm just not sure if it is a big deal or not. I should be able to interact with it plenty, though I am a student and would be away sometimes for classes.   Edit: I also just remembered I should ask about noise levels too. I play instruments (not excessively loud, out of consideration for my own ears as well as any neighbours), but I wonder how a chinchilla would feel about electric guitar sounds or other instrument noises."
chinchilla,3c8v11,rosengold,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:34:02 2015 UTC,"You can own just one chinchilla. It's not uncommon, but I promise you ... They're like potato chips and you will want more in the future. Starting with a pair already bonded ( same sex ) is way better then possibly ending up with two singles in the future because they wouldn't bond.   Cost wise, it's not much more expensive. I spend maybe $40 a month on TWELVE chinchillas, and that's when I'm buying a lot of everything.   You can buy in bulk and online. A 50lb bag of blue cloud dust is $25. Or you can pay $12 retail for 3lbs. Online , groups, forums, and feed stores become your best friend.   Also, chins rarely smell when cared for properly and they aren't loud critters. They don't need owners who play with them non stop, they're more of a hands off pet. A hi here and there and playing every other day is fine. Especially when they also have a cage mate."

The only time they don't use the litter is if it we forget to change it and it gets too soiled."

My 2 chinchillas housed together do great, but they occasionally decide they don't want to use it. There's a 50/50 chance with my single housed one.  I sturdy glass dish (like a Pyrex dish) works well. I would get a couple and put them in different corners. If they miss, it's important to clean up the mess they made outside the dish, or else they will tend to use the same spot again. Good luck! (As a side note, they still poop everywhere)"

chinchilla,3c0ke0,beatitudine,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:07:43 2015 UTC,"With my first chin, the breeder said she was litter trained. She pees in the pan most times, but every once in a while there are accidents.  I just got my second chin about a month ago. I adopted him through a shelter that rescued him +300-some others from the same place, so they had no idea if he was trained. I put the pan in when I was first setting up his cage, and he has peed in it every single time since. Not one accident! I think it might just be natural for them. Either that, or I'm extremely lucky!  Either way, I would just set the litter box in the corner or spot where they pee the most, and hope for the best!!"

chinchilla,3btzlg,5chinnychinchins,3,Thu Jul 2 03:55:44 2015 UTC,"The dad and mom actually have been together for about 4 years and there was no signs she was pregnant. Mom is eating and seems fine and we will weigh the kit everyday to make sure he is growing. We separted the father almost immediately but we let him in for a couple mins to let him get a scent of his new son. We have a two story ferret nation cage and no problem separting them. Tommorrow I will post more pictures, on mobile at the moment."
chinchilla,3btzlg,rosengold,9,Thu Jul 2 04:13:39 2015 UTC,"Please don't put the mom and dad back together again, otherwise it would be considered back yard breeding which is dangerous for everyone involved. Females can get pregnant again  72 hours before birth and come into heat right after birth, so mark 111days on your calendar to be prepared if the mother litters again.   A kit can escape from a ferret nation cage. You need to move mom and baby into a baby safe, single level cage with no shelves. The bar spacing needs to be no larger than 1/2"" x 1/2""     Expect a drop in weight for the first 3 days, then a steady 2g gain from there. A healthy start weight is about  50 grams.   Mom would do well to get lots if alfalfa too, it helps replenish lost nutrients and helps her milk come in. It also gives her lots if calories to produce milk.   Also, no play time for mom or baby. Mom needs to use her calories to produce milk and baby needs to save calories to grow big and strong. 6 months is a good age to start play time.  I could go on and on. I love Chinchillas and kits."

chinchilla,3btzlg,5chinnychinchins,-1,Thu Jul 2 14:51:41 2015 UTC,"They shouldn't be, otherwise you're allowing them to breed back to back to back, and pet chinchillas shouldn't even be bred in the first place. It's not safe, and not fair to your pet to be put into a breeding situation where the mother could ultimately die with the babies, or the babies could be born with genetic issues."
chinchilla,3btzlg,rosengold,3,Fri Jul 3 03:46:15 2015 UTC,There is always the option of getting the male fixed but honestly it wasn't worth it for me. I keep him in his own cage with another male now. After getting him fixed he keeps having problems with hernias and surgery isn't helping so the vet says he could have a shorter life because of it.
chinchilla,3btzlg,5chinnychinchins,0,Thu Jul 2 16:43:32 2015 UTC,"The hernias form from not healing correctly inside, did you put him in a small cage with no ledges, etc. for a few weeks after his surgery? I have successfully had 3 males neutered, and my friend has had 9 males neutered. A quality vet and correct post op care can really prevent this.   ( males must be separate for approx. 6 weeks after being neutered to ensure all viable sperm is dead, their floating testes are to thank for this. )"
chinchilla,3btzlg,TooferToofs,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:48:23 2015 UTC,Yeah I did. :/ he has had hernia repairs three times and he is always put in a very small cage with no room to jump around for at least two and a half months. I've tried two different exotic vets and he still keeps getting them. This time it's huge. But for the first half a year after the surgery they weren't there and now they have reappeared.

Get your buns tested for pasturella and if any have it bun on chin interaction is a no go.   Edit: most wild breeds. Cotton tails ect. Domestic bunny breeds don't normally carry it. Either way get your buns tested. It's a time bomb for older buns.

chinchilla,3bu8xf,_mtndewfiend_,2,Thu Jul 2 05:00:22 2015 UTC,Also new to reddit. so i have been sitting here for the last 30 minutes listening to her make these noises it starts with what sounds like a cough then keeps going I have no idea what she is doing.
chinchilla,3bu8xf,rosengold,4,Thu Jul 2 05:01:35 2015 UTC,"It's a warning call. Which means she hears something or sees something that scares or intimidates her. It's her way of warning you, and her cage mate that something isn't right.  They can hear far better than us. Most likely a sound from another room or outside."
chinchilla,3bu8xf,Dalisca,3,Thu Jul 2 06:23:15 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, their ear structures and hearing range is almost identical to a human.  It is for this reason that they are the #1 choice as a lab animal to use for experiments which deal with the inner ear.  Here's a source which isn't as informative of the original article I read a few years back, but at least confirms the scientific usage.  Edit:  Here's another source which outlines a full hearing study."
chinchilla,3bu8xf,bella26piano,2,Thu Jul 2 16:13:57 2015 UTC,"This is true! But they also experience things as if they are happening slower, so they definitely do notice sounds that are quieter and more far away than humans."
chinchilla,3bu8xf,rosengold,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:43:59 2015 UTC,"The problem with these studies are that they're out dated, and no longer conducted with Chinchillas."
chinchilla,3bu8xf,Dalisca,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:38:07 2015 UTC,This study is from only 3 weeks ago.
chinchilla,3bu8xf,rosengold,2,Fri Jul 3 19:44:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I'll bring this up with the others."
chinchilla,3bu8xf,ninachinchilla,3,Sat Jul 4 05:42:05 2015 UTC,"One of my chins made a similar sound about 7 years ago, but it sounded more like this.  I think it's essentially the same sound it's just how different humans sound slightly different from one another https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXKCmWYMSxM  I went downstairs to check on him and he was totally fine and stopped barking.  It wasn't until I turned around to go back to bed that I could see that my sister's snake had escaped and was hiding under the lip where the floor dropped down a level.   I really don't think that anything would have happened but I'm still glad I found the snake!"
chinchilla,3bu8xf,Mlmkiniry,4,Thu Jul 2 13:48:17 2015 UTC,One of mine does that in his sleep. And whenever he sees our hedgehogs (who are housed separately).
chinchilla,3bu8xf,5chinnychinchins,2,Thu Jul 2 15:56:57 2015 UTC,No need to be worried. They bark quite frequently. Mine do this when they want attention or to be let out or a snack or if I leave the room. If they aren't acting like they are sick or hurt or they are doing it nonstop for hours then you don't need to be worried.

chinchilla,3bryt8,zemallo,3,Wed Jul 1 17:47:25 2015 UTC,"Be careful. They don't share the same language or the same diet ( entirely)   Watch out for you chin eating your rabbits food, and watch out for your rabbit. If he / she becomes disgruntled 1 good kick to a chins chest will break ribs and in some cases kill your pet.   I've had one family contact me who suffered from this, the broken rib punctured a lung and there was no saving their pet. It happens so quickly.   Be safe."
chinchilla,3bryt8,rosengold,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:32:18 2015 UTC,"This. Even if they get along best friends still fight. A displeased nip, foot stomp, etc could scare or upset the other into attacking or even an over aggressive ""get out of here"" bite/kick from the rabbit that could kill the chin or from the chin that will provoke the rabbit into also kicking/biting. They speak a lot by biting and nibbling each other and if they dont understand each other clearly there will be a fight one day. I have one rabbit and 4 chins that share a room but will never ever be allowed to play together. As cute as it is please dont let this continue OP. I'd recommend seperating their play space and getting the chin another chin to bond to."
chinchilla,3bryt8,DPleskin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:26:06 2015 UTC,I agree.
chinchilla,3bryt8,rosengold,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:20:34 2015 UTC,Thankfully I am aware of these dangers and at first signs of any aggressive behavior they are separated. But they've been friends since they were both babies. And have a year strong bond.
chinchilla,3bryt8,rosengold,3,Thu Jul 2 00:36:29 2015 UTC,"Then I have to ask. . . if you've already made up your mind about letting them stay together , why bother asking for advice from others, were you inadvertently looking for validation?"
chinchilla,3bryt8,djh3315,2,Thu Jul 2 03:18:19 2015 UTC,Not really. Just wanted to share my experience and see what people in the community thought about it. But thanks for that.

chinchilla,3bryt8,TooferToofs,4,Wed Jul 1 18:28:21 2015 UTC,Lemme get some on imgur. My Chinchilla likes to take naps in my bunny's house often so that's where the adorableness happens.
chinchilla,3bryt8,bella26piano,3,Wed Jul 1 19:22:01 2015 UTC,"if you let them play/nap together I would make sure to take out the food, since the diets are very different. also be sure to keep an eye on them since  bunnies are strong, and chinchilla's are fragile. also, photos please.  :]"
chinchilla,3bryt8,rosengold,3,Wed Jul 1 20:24:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with rosengold. Keep a very close eye. I would keep them separated when you're not there just to be safe. Rabbits have some powerful legs.   This goes for any owner and their chinchilla's friend. Even though you may have never seen your cat act aggressive, or your dog has never bit anyone, animals can be unpredictable. Monitor your pets, and make sure you keep them separated when you are not around. Accidents happen!"
chinchilla,3bryt8,bella26piano,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:22:55 2015 UTC,"We have a chinchilla-degu pair, it's adorable. And they eat the same things, sleep together, and they have never fought or hurt each other. It's awesome...but I can't imagine a rabbit and a chinchilla, how do they communicate?"
chinchilla,3bryt8,Dalisca,2,Thu Jul 2 00:27:21 2015 UTC,Chinchillas and degus share the same natural environment :) it's not uncommon in the wild to see them together.
chinchilla,3brptg,Kjerikaye,2,Wed Jul 1 16:42:35 2015 UTC,Depends on the lineage and breeding.  Some of my show chins will get a growth spurt between 2-3 years and gain a couple hundred grams.  Others may stop at a year.
chinchilla,3brptg,RedBeams,3,Wed Jul 1 18:02:30 2015 UTC,Within a year or two they are fully grown. Some chinchillas are slow growers. Their parents and how many siblings they have contribute to their growth rate. A good way to see if they are gaining weight and growing is weighing them on a scale. A kitchen scale that measures grams works. You should continue to weigh them weekly once they are older just to make sure they aren't loosing weight and are staying healthy.
chinchilla,3brptg,TooferToofs,2,Wed Jul 1 21:34:56 2015 UTC,"Yeop! My little girl is .5kg, but a healthy little doodle - was a quadruplet."
chinchilla,3brptg,Dalisca,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:53:51 2015 UTC,"My chinchilla is around 535 grams, but she's had a pretty harsh life until I took her in. Each chinchilla is different!"
chinchilla,3br0nc,Beardysteve1,4,Wed Jul 1 13:23:37 2015 UTC,"Heat stroke will come at different temperatures for different chinchillas.  It depends on how warm they are used to being, if your chin has been in temps that have been nearing 21 degrees all summer hitting 21/22 degrees isn't going to do any harm, just make sure there is limited or no play time.  If you suspect heat stroke, lay him/her on a shelf in the fridge for a few minutes.  When they do get heat stroke they will be limp and will pop back up when they cool off. You can also refrigerate stones, bricks, clay pots, really anything ceramic or rock and put it in a small enclosed area like their house if it only has one entry hole or a box.  If he is too hot he will go in there with it and block the entry with his fur.  This keeps the cool temperature in and the heat out.  They are really quite good at regulating their body temps if you give them a way to do so.  Good luck and stay cool!"
chinchilla,3br0nc,RedBeams,4,Wed Jul 1 15:41:42 2015 UTC,My general rule is to try and keep my apartment at or below 70 F
chinchilla,3br0nc,Skrilmaufive,4,Wed Jul 1 13:55:54 2015 UTC,21 is starting to get to the most they can stand.  Do you have some ice packs your could wrap up and put in the cage for them?  They can sit on them to stay cool.
chinchilla,3br0nc,KungFuPup,2,Wed Jul 1 14:04:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this heat isn't good. I'm really worriesdabout mine being honest, I'm doing all I can😞😞"
chinchilla,3br0nc,chambers7,3,Wed Jul 1 14:43:37 2015 UTC,"Ours are usually good until about 75 F (~24 C), then they start sprawling on the coolest surface they can find. Anywhere above 20 C you probably want a fan near their cage, and above ~23 C you might want to keep those chilled marble thingies they sell on a refrigerator rotation."
chinchilla,3br0nc,pksage,2,Wed Jul 1 15:32:26 2015 UTC,"In Arizona, usa and I'm around 75f most of the day in their room. It's been 112f outside for the last three weeks, so it's the best I can manage."
chinchilla,3br0nc,voiceinthedesert,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:36:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the advice guys. Still averaging around 21 degrees Celsius but she seems happy enough at the moment. Just hope it doesn't get much hotter than this.
chinchilla,3br0nc,djh3315,2,Wed Jul 1 17:43:41 2015 UTC,Should be fine! As someone above said 24C is usually the beginning of the danger zone. The higher the humidity the more dangerous it gets as well so if it isn't terribly humid they are probably fine up to 26/27 degrees. Here in the US they sell small granite slabs that you can place in a refrigerator and put in their cage on warm days for them to cool down. May not be a bad idea to grab something like that!
chinchilla,3br0nc,TooferToofs,3,Wed Jul 1 18:32:26 2015 UTC,"When it's that warm, do not let her out of her cage. She may beg and be grumpy, but she can exhaust herself and really cause damage without knowing. Everyone has great advice. Some chinchilla vendors sell ice packs wrapped in fleece so there's no condensation and chinchillas can stay cool on them. I would look into that!"
chinchilla,3bqgnd,KungFuPup,2,Wed Jul 1 09:11:09 2015 UTC,"I've left an electric fan oscillating the room whilst I'm at work, if I'm struggling in 33• heat I can't imagine how my boys must feel in their fur! I got my mum to check in on them around midday and she said they seem just fine so that's a relief! Are there any other tips for keeping chinchillas cool? I've heard that freezing water in a glass bottle will keep them cool but I'd be worried about moisture?"
chinchilla,3bqgnd,juuuules92,2,Wed Jul 1 12:37:26 2015 UTC,"If you put a cool pack in front of the fan or some ice kinda like this you can make a crude air conditioner.  Keeping the curtains shut will help to keep the sun out and the air cool.  Never tried freezing a bottle or water, maybe try it under supervision and see if they're ok with it?  It might be worth wrapping it in a towel just to keep them from chewing it and the water going everywhere.  I've given them ice packs wrapped in a tea towel before but I need to keep an eye on them as they like to chew on everything.  I do have some ceramic tiles that I stick in the freezer to cool and put those in the cage for them to sit on.  They seem to like those."
chinchilla,3bqgnd,juuuules92,3,Wed Jul 1 12:47:40 2015 UTC,I read an interesting idea just now as well.  You could put some ice packs in a biscuit tin or something similar.  The metal will help conduct the cold and they shouldn't be able to chew through the tin and start eating the ice packs.
chinchilla,3bqgnd,Nezhka,2,Wed Jul 1 12:58:24 2015 UTC,"Tried this biscuit tin as soon as i got home and it seems to be working! Both my boys are sat inbetween it and where the fan passes their cage and seem very happy, thank you so much! :)"

chinchilla,3bputq,rosengold,3,Wed Jul 1 04:42:03 2015 UTC,I have one of these bath houses.  It keeps it mostly in the bath although one of my chinchillas likes to perch on the edge and dig the dust out onto the floor.
chinchilla,3bputq,KungFuPup,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:05:48 2015 UTC,That's cute. :) after 12 chins bathe . . . it looks like it has snowed in my house ×_×
chinchilla,3bputq,AMPforever,2,Wed Jul 1 11:21:49 2015 UTC,"I let them dust in a pan in the guest bathroom tub, then vacuum the mess afterwards. I used to let them dust in a fish bowl in the living room, but I felt no matter how much I vacuumed the carpet, it never really got it all."
chinchilla,3bolt7,sporks_,4,Tue Jun 30 21:57:11 2015 UTC,"If your home is not in any temperature danger over the weekend (stays at or below 75F), then your chinchilla will be fine for the most part staying at home. Just ensure there is enough hay, pellets and water for the short duration. If it's more than 3 days, I might find a pet sitter or I'd just haul him along. Sure he might be grumpy over having to entertain himself, but some extra attention when you get home and regular playtime and he'll forgive you I'm sure.  In fact, my SO and I are leaving this weekend for our parents' place (~8hr drive). Unfortunately for us, we don't have reliable AC and this weekend is going to be hot hot hot. So we're actually taking Thor with us. For times like this, we have a pretty small cage that we use as a carrier (maybe 2.5' x 1' x 1.5', guesstimating since I'm at work). It's definitely larger than most carriers so we don't worry too much about needing to let him out to play, but if we did I'd recommend something like the first item you listed (since Thor would probably chew the fabric)."
chinchilla,3bolt7,sdyawg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:16:42 2015 UTC,"Hmmm good point about the AC. I have a small portable AC that I never turn on for more than ~5 hrs at a time since my apartment stays pretty cool, but I don't think it makes sense financially to leave it on for 3 days straight just in case.   I think I'm leaning towards taking him anyway just to see how he reacts (and then knowing if I can take him with me in the future). My parents usually call him ""your rat"" when I talk about him, but I think deep down they want to meet him since they were the ones who suggested bringing him with me."
chinchilla,3bolt7,DeathHaze420,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:25:58 2015 UTC,"Does it have a temperature setting on it? Theoretically if that room stays cool, it won't run constantly."
chinchilla,3bolt7,sdyawg,2,Tue Jun 30 22:28:12 2015 UTC,"Nope, just a timer. I usually only turn it on if the high temperature outside for the day is 78-80 or hotter, and I'll set the timer for 5-8hrs (depending how hot it's going to be and how long I'll be gone). I've never had to leave it on at night (although sometimes I'll turn it on for an hour as I fall asleep just for my own comfort). Otherwise, my apartment is like a cave, and he's in the coolest corner. I've never seen the thermometer by him read hotter than 74, even when it's hot out and the AC is off.  edit: that being said I would not leave him alone for 3 days if I couldn't adjust the temp for him."
chinchilla,3bolt7,Nezhka,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:37:38 2015 UTC,"yea, portable AC is what we use as well, even if it could reliably work 3-4 days straight, there's things that could go wrong and I've already lost one chinchilla to a broken AC unit."

chinchilla,3bj8gd,thatblondgirl,3,Mon Jun 29 22:36:00 2015 UTC,Patience is the main thing to remember with animals.  If you wait long enough they will eventually stop running for a split second and/or be in a great pose.  You could also tempt them into position with a treat.  They may sit still just long enough for you to get your shot.  Lots of light (preferably natural light otherwise everything goes a little orange) so that you can use a high shutter speed to try to catch them when they're sprinting.  Play about with the speeds and see what works best.

Just as many others do - priorities. Now I'm back.   You can make it difficult or you can make the best of it."
chinchilla,3bhthu,DeathHaze420,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:54:40 2015 UTC,"I personally talked to the mod who was removed, and asked him/her was she was no longer a mod and she responded with, ""I don't know"".  I have screenshots to prove this.  I've also been in touch with TWO people who were banned from your subreddit.  I really don't think you had a real reason to remove the mod and you're definitely lying about how many people you have banned the last few days. Perhaps you decided to unban them, but I know de facto there's been two (probably more) bans here lately."
chinchilla,3bhthu,DeathHaze420,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:48:31 2015 UTC,"I have messages from the previous mod being here for CSS ( that's why the page looks the way it does).   The other was inactive. I'm more than happy to share a screenshot of the banned users. It was at 7, and now down to 5. That means only 3 recent bans.   Banned user list  Only ones missing is /u/5chinnychins who has been invited back ( after talking with another admin ) and /u/KungFuPup 's husband's account as well has been added back because being respectful has that effect. ( cant remember his user name )   I also banned another user but undid the ban when I realized I mixed him/her up with 5chinnychins.   The mod I think you're talking about is /u/Jaskys , and here's how he requested to be a mod. He/she requested to be an Mod so they could do CSS the other mod was /u/peacocktits and I removed her for inactivity on the sub.   I haven't lied once, you're just being assumptive. I didn't even ban you though you've clearly violated our no drama rule by posting our threads in other subs trying to cause drama -Which was removed for having to grounds or proof."

chinchilla,3bgd9m,minooska,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:02:37 2015 UTC,"Hi! So my chin Fitzgerald is just coming up to a year old. I'm taking him to a vet for a yearly checkup in just a couple weeks but have a few questions beforehand.  He's a beige chinchilla and I've heard that they have a tendency to be bigger than the average chin. I weighed him yesterday and he's sitting at 656 grams. He's quite long and he's not spherical (quite rectangular from above, actually) and I'm wondering if this is an OK weight for him? Everything I have read says a male is usually between 400-500g. If that's the case, oh my god I need to do something.  He's out of his cage roaming the basement with me about 2 hours every night from between 8-10 or so. He's always tuckered when he goes back in his cage. He has a large wheel in his cage that I hear him running in at night quite frequently.  He eats pellets, Timothy hay, and has about a tsp of a treat mixture over the course of the week.   Any suggestions, thoughts or tips?  I can post a photo if needed."
chinchilla,3bgd9m,rosengold,2,Wed Jul 1 20:15:29 2015 UTC,"Hey :) Fitzgerald sounds like a healthy Chinchilla. It's great you're being a proactive owner and getting a yearly wellness check!   A chinchilla's color mutation doesn't really have much to do with their sizes. Double and triple recessives do tend to be smaller and mousy looking, but that's another case because they're bred mute to mute to mute. A beige however isn't affected like that. A larger chin just means better genetics.   When parents are paired well the compliment eachother and produce better kits, now, I haven't seen Fitzgerald, but 656g is a good weight. Any chinchilla, male or female, will range between 400g ( small, poorly bred ) to 1,000g ( well bred, or if fed a crap diet obese. )   I have a 450ish brown velvet who was bred into the ground, and 2 1,000g standards who just have strong genetics.   2hours of play time sounds excessive though, but so long as he isn't over heating, and has access to food and water I wouldn't worry. Chins are know to have issues with their bloodsugar levels though, and long play times are a risk.   What is his treat mixture, and what is his pellet? I'd LOVE to see a photo!    Amber of Let's Love Chinchillas."
chinchilla,3bgd9m,minooska,0,Thu Jul 2 06:40:08 2015 UTC,"Hi Amber!  Thanks for your response. I really appreciate it!  When it comes to play time it's more of a roam-outside-of-the-cage time. I check on him every so often and his feet and ears are always still quite cool but I will most definitely keep an eye out for any issues that might come up. I always leave his cage open so he can always jump back in for water and food when he needs it.  As for the treats, he eats a mixture by Vitakraft called ""Chinchilla Cocktail"" and it includes dried rose hips, alfalfa meal, oats, ground corn, dried mountain ash berries, and a couple other things. The guaranteed analysis says it's 9% crude protein, 1.5% crude fat, 13% crude fibre and 17% moisture. He seems to like it well enough but I try to make sure he's not eating too much.   I can't recall the name of his pellet though. I got a very large bag and dumped it all in to a bin to contain the odour (because gosh, does it smell.)  I actually posted a video with Fitz last night. Here he is!  He had an accident a couple weeks ago where he slipped a large chunk of fur so it's slowly growing back. He's OK though!"
chinchilla,3bef7i,totoro432,3,Sun Jun 28 13:29:54 2015 UTC,"Update? Maybe you should get her to a vet, it could be a sign of something bad."
chinchilla,3bef7i,Meikami,16,Sun Jun 28 16:42:47 2015 UTC,"Is she still doing this?   First thing is to eliminate any big easy things: make sure she's got water and food and that she looks healthy. Check her nose and mouth and body for any abnormalities.   Then look at surroundings: check for any noises (motors running, fans, bass, etc.) that might be freaking her out, turn those off, and see if that helps. Make sure the temperature in your house is normal, etc. Then it's onto the more serious stuff. Check to see if there's anything bad she could have gotten into. This is where you want to scrutinize heavily, because these little guys can get into all sorts of things that you wouldn't normally expect.   Now, this is important: regardless of what you find, if the simple fixes above didn't work, GET HER TO AN EMERGENCY VET.   My boy Hero once started running around and flopping into corners randomly, like he couldn't get comfortable, and something seemed wrong. Took him to the emergency vet and it turned out he had jumped into a garbage can while it was open for a moment and nibbled on some paper towels doused in cleaner and poisoned himself. They were able to help him by giving him activated charcoal and fluids and monitoring him for a while, but if we hadn't taken him in, he likely wouldn't have made it.   Google emergency vets near you. You have to have something open on a Sunday.   Best of luck..."
chinchilla,3bef7i,Meikami,5,Sun Jun 28 16:43:08 2015 UTC,Okay update! sorry everyone! I got her to a vet and they said her bottom teeth looked abnormally long but I'd have to schedule an appointment with the exotic animals vet. They gave her analgesic and she's been acting normal since our visit. Her teeth were quite yellow too so I'm thinking its just a problem with her teeth.   Thanks for all of the love and support!!!
chinchilla,3bef7i,Dalisca,8,Sun Jun 28 20:45:03 2015 UTC,Well the yellow teeth thing is perfectly normal - healthy chins have yellowish-brownish teeth. But I'm glad you were able to get her to a vet!
chinchilla,3bef7i,rosengold,4,Sun Jun 28 21:48:57 2015 UTC,Glad she's doing better! All chins have yellow-orange teeth. Fun rodent fact: beavers have orange-red teeth because they are actually fortified with iron; the color comes from oxidation.  The more you know! *
chinchilla,3bef7i,Mlmkiniry,3,Mon Jun 29 00:36:22 2015 UTC,"Okay then if her teeth are supposed to be yellow I really don't know whats going on! She's been fine since this morning and I'll schedule an appointment tomorrow.  Seriously, everyone, thank you for your support and help! Chinchillas are not an easy animal to google symptoms for lol"
chinchilla,3bef7i,shibbypwn,3,Mon Jun 29 01:24:46 2015 UTC,"If it is her teeth, have them to xrays to check for root elongation. Malo is not curable. and filing / clipping / removing teeth only prolongs the inevitable. Hopefully it's not malo :("
chinchilla,3bef7i,ChinchillaChateau,2,Mon Jun 29 01:58:19 2015 UTC,"Will do! I really hope it isn't Malo... she's always been a constant chewer and eats through sticks like no one's business, usually. A friend suggested a possible splinter and another suggested she may just have been spooked. Either way the Vet will be able to give me more information at the appointment :)"
chinchilla,3bef7i,PrincessMiMz,3,Mon Jun 29 02:18:36 2015 UTC,Updates please!  You have us worried!  Is she pooping as per usual? Did you check the pads of her feet and her belly for anything that might be pricking her?
chinchilla,3bhvuk,Skrilmaufive,-2,Mon Jun 29 10:28:36 2015 UTC,"RE: Backyard breeding,  I did not mean to offend pet owners. If I offended you, I'm sorry.  Low quality/ pet quality are just terms like ""dirty belly"" to describe a chinchilla in the ""breeding world"" if you will.   ( Dirty belly is used to describe an animal who has the ebony gene present when it would generally not be wanted. A standard should be grey with a CRISP white belly, a standard with a greyish belly would be considered dirty ( and actually a light ebony ) because the ebony gene. NOT because someone thinks you have a filthy animal. Owners get offended before it can even be explained. I own 3 animals with ""dirty bellies"". 2 light ebonies and a beige ( tech a light tan ).)  It doesn't mean your pet is worthless. It just means they should not be bred. Continuously breeding animals like so will continue to cause a decline in their quality AND their overall health. The truth of it is some animals produce better offspring than others. Those lacking too much are low quality and sold as pet only for a reason. Maybe the line has been found to have issues, or they're too small to safely be bred. Perhaps the fur isn't dense as it should be, or the animal is a dwarf. There's many reasons that an animal can be ""low quality"". Even a pedigreed pair can produce low quality offspring if not paired correctly to compliment each other's faults.   Should you feel bad for having a pet quality animal? NO. They're your pet and deserve to be loved just as any animal does. They just should not be bred, for their safety and for the quality of life their offspring may have. All animals deserve to be born healthy, but breeding unethically robs them of that.   Of course there's accidents, but there are ways to prevent these accidents. Owners must take responsibility for their mistake, and do whatever is in their power to prevent it from occurring again.    Properly sex your animals and keep males and females separate. Failing to have a neutered male in a mixed sex pair.  Don't have mixed sex'd play time - They can and will breed.  Don't keep brother and sister together, they will breed.  Don't trust someone's word about sex. Be positive for yourself.  Keep opposite sex cages away from each other to prevent breeding through the bars. Avoid purchasing females from pet shops when possible ( more often than not it's found they've been exposed to a male and become pregnant )    This reddit is for sharing advice and pictures, but that doesn't mean unethical things will go unnoticed.  If you truly want to breed your goal should be to produce offspring that are better than their parents. I encourage you to find a breeder near you, and to shadow them. Produce strong quality animals with lineage and start from there. If you're going to breed, do it correctly and ethically. Attend shows to check your animals, there you can really see the competition and know if you've improved overall, or just what you have. There's already so many poorly chins who have been dumped at rescues, we don't need any more ""oopsie"" breeders out there.   Backyard breeders are people who breed their pet quality chinchillas, and have ""oops"" litters. They generally cater to popular colors or the general cuteness that all babies offer. This indiscriminate breeding leads to weaker bodies with chins prone to malocclusion, heart murmurs, genetically predisposed behavior problems, fur chewing and overall questionable health. However, even these animals need good, loving homes. Be a part of the solution, not a part of the problem. Save lives: Leave the breeding to the professionals.   Hopefully, this has been a little more descriptive. This wasn't targeted at any user, it's just here for the general population to learn from."
chinchilla,3bhvuk,DeathHaze420,-1,Mon Jun 29 10:47:10 2015 UTC,"I didn't say that mistake litters were unethical. Indiscriminate breeding , on purposes, and multiple ""oops"" litters is. Its only an accident oh so many times. There have been users that have posted before with their 3rd-4th-5th ""surprise litters from the same animal.   As far as the banning goes, in the 2years I've owned this sub, I've banned only 7 people. If that is excessive, I don't know what to tell you.   I removed an inactive mod, and I removed another who was just here to do CSS.   When you rescue a female - It is to be anticipated. She may be pregnant. Obviously there's nothing to do about that but to wait and see, and to be prepared."

chinchilla,3bhvuk,DeathHaze420,8,Mon Jun 29 14:23:03 2015 UTC,"I do not think ""oops"" litters are anywhere near backyard breeders. That may be why you are being downvoted as some of us view these kind of posts as basically an attack on anyone who has, has had, or is expecting babies.  Why does color make a ""poor quality chinchilla?"" You sound like someone breeding for the fur trade, not the pet trade."
chinchilla,3bhvuk,DeathHaze420,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"When you pair mutation to mutation, you need to do so wisely because you can either improve on the kits quality or produce a very poorly animal.  Like posted below the example of white to white. They Carry the lethal gene. It doesn't actually cause a kit to die, but it causes some kits not to form. Basically, 25% less kits will be born of this pairing. They simply won't develop. As for the kits who do develop. . .  White is already a weak gene. Whites tend to have mousy faces, and thinner, silky fur.  When you pair two whites the remaining off spring show this even more. Its really unpleasant. Not only is the quality poorly, but genetically the animal isn't sound and will be predisposed to other issues. Only an example. I own 3 whites. 2 pet quality and 1 breeder.   I don't breed for the fur trade, but for arguments sake, all chinchilla mutations can be used in the fur industry.   A backyard breeder will post on Craigslist ( or whatever site you use ) and say the litter was an accident or basically anything to avoid being called out but still make a sale. They'll call them rescues, but be breeding them to make a quick buck. Currently someone tried selling 1 month old kits for $250 each, it's a very sad thing."
chinchilla,3bhvuk,ispies,2,Mon Jun 29 11:56:16 2015 UTC,"Alright, I see what you are getting at now.  I didn't realize that some chin's genes were so weak. Or that specific colors hold genetic killer code. I wonder why they would be like this from an evolutionary standpoint. Or if we just messed up their genes really bad within captivity compared to wild chins"
chinchilla,3bhvuk,Kjerikaye,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:51:31 2015 UTC,"It's like that with a lot of animals, and if you don't work with the mutations hands on it can be hard to understand. The same happens with TOV mutations too ( black velvet, Brown velvet, tov ebony, tov mosaic etc )   Some are just incomplete, and some animals are bred mute to mute to mute and increasingly making the animal weaker. Bybs don't normally want standard animals because they don't sell as quickly or go for as much , but not breeding back to a standard will make an animal mousy and poorly. Standards have the strongest genetics.   A real breeders herd is made up of mostly different standards so they have genetic diversity. These standards are imported from out of the USA or from all over The USA. A good quality std for herd improvement can cost $500!"
chinchilla,3bd51k,grakke,7,Sun Jun 28 02:23:13 2015 UTC,Lola is a trickster. We let her out in the living room and she is always trying to get under the couch (which I blocked off with a homemade pillow). She will try and knock things over on the other side of the room so we go look then she'll sprint back to the couch and try to move the pillow and sneak under before we get back.
chinchilla,3bd51k,iffnotnowhen,8,Sun Jun 28 02:40:41 2015 UTC,"Even though we have transportation to and from the bathroom play area down to a science, there are rules that my chin enforces in the process.  When he knows it's time to play, he will always hide in the same place, under his chinspin, which is probably the least effective hiding place in terms preventing me from picking him up.  And based on his other hiding practices, I'm certain that he is aware of this.  Then when he knows that play time is ending, he will hide in a corner and literally wait for me to come chase him.  The process used to involve him bouncing off the wall and catching him on the rebound, but I think he got tired of losing that battle.  So now he just kind of stops and waits for me to lean over and let him climb up into my arms.  There's another one that I haven't quite figured out yet.  During my morning routine, just before I leave for work, I put some fresh hay in his cage, and then give him scratches for about a minute.  While I'm sitting at the bottom of his cage with the hay, he's taken to positioning himself at the top of the cage, deliberately looking away from the cage door and out the side, effectively staring at the wall.  And then he acts surprised when I get around to scratches.  He never shows any interest in that part of the outside world at any other time of day."

He has an entire room to himself, plenty of places to hide and run, but he just wants to get back in, and then out, and then back in....He also pushes me hand out of the way if i dont move fast enough, or he will attempt to eat over my hand, or through it which involves him nibbling on me and realizing i dont taste good, but this is a prime time to pet his belly which he loves, on rare occasions i catch him curled up around his one toy and he will let me pet his belly while he has 1 eye open watching me making sure i dont try to grab him. The other Bear, he's just cool as a cucumber and can care less about being in or out of the cage, long as he gets pets its all the same. He's picky however to who picks him up, how hes picked up, and when; if he sits in my lap for more then .38 seconds and allows me to scratch his chin i know he's ok to be picked up, if he just bounces off me and i try to get em im in for a wild ride with alot of grunts. When feeding time comes, he will sit at the bowl, push my hand out of his way, and if im ""too slow"" he will sit on my hand and eat....not a care in the world from either of them"
chinchilla,3bd51k,dxm765,2,Sun Jun 28 15:48:34 2015 UTC,"my chin pepper is a character...  -if you try and scratch her chin she pushes your finger away with her hands and stares at you.   -she turns her head to the side whenever she's thinking hard, so it's reallly easy to tell when she's trying to figure out a problem  -if she's in her cage and you try and get her out, she will definitely pee on you. if she's out of her cage, she climbs on your shoulder and nibbles on your earlobe."

Once he does, he loses interest immediately for the rest of the day, but gets just as excited the next time.  He also likes to indicate he wants to be picked up by leaning wayyy out and reaching his paws towards my hand. It's adorable."

For the water I would definitely switch to a bottle asap. For hay I would switch to normal Timothy hay as well, you can still use the cubes, but just use them as a supplement to the hay and not the primary source. You can purchase some hay bins for your cage to keep it a bit cleaner as well.   For the first few days I wouldn't handle him too much just let him adjust to his new home give him a treat occasionally and let him have a dust bath every other day or so (when I first got mine I let them have a dust bath every day for the first couple weeks as it seemed to help them relax. Having too many dust baths can supposedly cause dry skin so I wouldn't do this for too long before cutting back to every other day )"

If not, I would recommend a glass one since he can chew through plastic ones even if they are on the outside of the cage.  I agree with the other comment saying to switch to regular timothy hay, and not cubed. What food and hay was the previous owner giving him, and what do you give him now? Dust baths are a good idea since it helps with chinchilla's stress too. Don't leave the bath in his cage for more than 15 minutes, since sometimes they want to make it a bathroom, or even sleep in it.   Does he have a name? :)"

If you want the most bang for your buck, go to any local feed store ( not pet store ) and for $5 -12 you can get a HUGE bag of wood shavings that puts the ""large"" petco bag to shame.   For $12 I get a large bag of eco pine shavings. It fills all 6 of my ferret nation units each 4x.

chinchilla,3b219j,rosengold,4,Thu Jun 25 09:40:31 2015 UTC,"Just because a chinchilla doesn't have a pedigree doesn't mean it's offspring will be malformed or poorly bred. They are just as beautiful, just as loving, and just as wonderful as a chinchilla with a pedigree. I started with two chinchillas who were supposed to be female and they had three beautiful babies who are now grown and equally as wonderful. Oh and they are perfectly healthy. They have all been thoroughly checked at the vet. Stop dissing on people's pets because they don't have a piece of paper. Also who are you to judge our pets and say us breeding them won't be tolerated? You aren't my mother, my father, or God."
chinchilla,3b219j,5chinnychinchins,-3,Fri Jun 26 22:26:45 2015 UTC,"Truth of the matter is, ask any registered breeder or chinchilla rescue.   Chins who are back yard bred are the most surrendered because they either fall ill due to being so poorly bred and bred back to back.   Because the mother often dies during birth ( a small chin with narrow hips struggles delivering kits ) or needs an emergency c-section ( nearly a grand in cost whom most refuse to pay )    Also, if 1 parent has malo, heart issues, liver issues they will pass it onto a kit. If both parents carry a poor genetic trait, the kit will have it.  For example, malo. It doesn't tend to show up till 3 - 5 years old and there is no cure for the genetic form.    You're not a breeder.   You're an irresponsible owner. . . and if you continue to allow your chins to breed, a back yard breeder and part of the problem."

I'm dissing owners who breed their pets because they're too lazy to just be responsible and keep males and females separate or to breed responsibly.   Your vets word means nothing. A vet can only tell you if they're physically healthy then and there. They can't even attempt to guarantee the future. I doubt you had tests done on your animals to better ensure their sound health.    I guarantee if you held your chin next to a well bred and genetically sound chin, you would see the real difference your breeding is.   I run this subreddit. Anyone user back yard breeding will be banned. Simple as that and if you don't like that, maybe you should post elsewhere.   These are animals that rely on us to make responsible choices for them. Not to play breeder. Leave it to the professionals.   If you loved your PET you would be responsible with him or her. Not risk their lives."

chinchilla,3b219j,sarahspins,-17,Fri Jun 26 23:31:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where you got your information Bella. While chins with pedigrees are not immune to death, disease, or genetic faults, they are far less likely to have these issues.   They're selectively bred to avoid them actually . Unlike dogs, they aren't horribly inbred to keep the breed standard pure.   Mutation Chinchillas ( any chinchilla other than a standard grey ) will live just as long as a standard. Granted a poorly bred chin or a poorly kept animal will die far before a well bred well loved animal.   The color of ones fur does not tell you how long they will live.   I personally own many mutations of various ages. 2yr old tan white. 1yr old beige, 2yr old black velvet, 4 month old black velvets, 3 yr old Brown velvet , 5yr old tov mosaic , 2 year old mosaic.   I expect them to live long healthy lives due to their lineage and care I provide.   I'm sorry you were misinformed or had the horrid experience of looking a chin so young - but I assure you it had nothing to do with the color of ones fur just as white people don't die sooner than African Americans Because they're white."

Unless he starts sneezing or showing real signs of respiratory illness I wouldnt worry. Just make sure he gets his weekly baths. If youre absolutely worried hes inhaling too much dust you can grab handfulls and rub it into his fur and make him a little pile to roll in so hes not inhalig the cloud inside the jar.

chinchilla,3a5buj,DeathHaze420,2,Wed Jun 17 12:14:13 2015 UTC,"This is definitely more important. But if you want to be extra careful, just make sure the higher ledges have a level several feet below them so that is the maximum distance they could fall."

chinchilla,39voec,GuapoWithAGun,7,Mon Jun 15 04:28:12 2015 UTC,"Its a pretty common issue with just about any wheel you're going to find. Our cage has two chins and they both have a wheel. What we found was that its often not the wheels that make the noises but the materials of the cage and the connection between cage and wheel.  For our solutions we found all the metal on metal contact points that were making noise and insulated them to reduce friction and sound from the metal banging. For the cage doors we used a little bit of duct tape and the sound instantly reduced dramatically, we also put rubber gaskets between the wing nuts and washers and the cage itself where the wheels connect.   These things together reduced the sound a lot. You can test this theory by just spinning the wheel itself. If you spin and it's noisy your problem is the wheel, if the wheel spins quietly the problem is the cage being jostled by the running.  Tldr. The cage is making more noise than the wheel, most likely."
chinchilla,39voec,pw3ner,4,Mon Jun 15 05:52:43 2015 UTC,Haha. We were just at the pet store yesterday and saw a metal on metal wheel advertised as silent.... nothing metal on metal is silent.

I will admit my one little buddy is from a petstore and he is completely different then the other one i got from a breeder, they're both adorable, my petstore buddy isnt as loving or lovable as the one i got from the breeder. But if its truly getting hotter (in PA its been 85-92F the last week...week and a half) i would have to bring him home  http://www.reddit.com/r/chinchilla/comments/39mqff/new_chinchilla_advice/"

(They told me that they wouldn't let me touch it because I didn't look like I had enough money to buy it)!!!! He just wanted to snuggle and jump around and play with me. He was one of the sweetest things ever.
chinchilla,39ujxw,violetfield,7,Tue Jun 16 03:55:20 2015 UTC,"At my PetSmart we use ice packs and rotate frozen granite slabs to keep them as cool as we can. We have air systems inside our habitats (our chinchilla takes a lot of joy in laying on top of her igloo to let the fan blow on her) so you can feel assured that the temperature in the habitat IS cooler than in the store by at least a bit, but this must be a smaller store with a different tank setup from ours if they're keeping him in a hamster sized cage. Policy dictates that chinchillas be kept in the largest available space on the sales floor. They rank higher than guinea pigs in this regard, since their space/stuff needs are greater (guineas don't need wheels). I can't believe they don't have a wheel, hay, or a chew stick in there for him though. That IS company policy, for sure. Hay is their number one food source! As far as letting her out to play, as much as we sincerely wish we could do this, it's simply not something we have the time for. We are supposed handle enough to ensure health, but past that point, we just don't have the facilities for playtime or the time for it. That's why you'll rarely have as well socialized an animal from a chain store as you would from a breeder. For everything else, I'd recommend asking to speak to the pet care manager specifically about it. If you need to threaten action, I don't blame you. If necessary, ask for the district manager's contact information. They will CERTAINLY be able to make a difference. If you see no change after that, they've been warned. That's my feeling on it.  This sort of stuff is why we try SO VERY HARD to sell the chinchillas we receive in the winter months while it's still cold out. Our facilities just aren't ideal for them."

chinchilla,39tfqr,auraliegh,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:03:17 2015 UTC,Detergent shouldn't be a problem but I would not bother with the dryer sheets. Chinchillas do identify things and places by smell and mark them withtheir own scent.

chinchilla,39t31n,meganb95,3,Sun Jun 14 14:34:57 2015 UTC,"Yes it would be big enough... But I would highly recommend a cage with no plastic shelves. Chinnies chew everything and, if ingested, plastic can cause impaction, which could lead to death.  I have 6 chins (4 male, 2 female... housed together by gender) and over the course of 4 years I've tried multiple cages... The best cage I've had is the Ferret Nation! I have a quite a few of these cages for my chins.  I removed all the plastic shelves and added wood shelves, houses, ect.  Then I covered the plastic trays with fleece....  Hope this helps :)"

chinchilla,39sfdh,Tappyy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:39:31 2015 UTC,"It probably depends on the chin, we had a small wooden perch for ours that he used all the time to sit on, but one day he decided it needed chewed on. He wore it down pretty quickly after that, not quite to where he couldn't still use it, but certainly not as comfortably. But we got nearly 2 years out of it."
chinchilla,39sfdh,Sliffy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:13:40 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the size of the shelves and how much there is to chew. We built our own cage, for one chin, with lots of wooden shelves (6' x 2' x 2.5', $100). She chews on all the shelves. Some of the smaller shelves needed to be replaced after 2 years. I highly doubt you'd need to replace them every month."
chinchilla,39sfdh,iffnotnowhen,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:59:22 2015 UTC,"Some of my shelves are 5+ years old.  If they get especially poo-y I sand that area away with coarse sandpaper.

chinchilla,39qm1s,RedBeams,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:10:09 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there is no way other than a/c to cool a chinchilla in the cabin on a flight, they do not sweat so air movement does them no good.  I'm not sure about therapy animals in particular but the captain has the final say as to what comes in the cabin and people do get rejected on flights with chinchillas and anything that makes the captain uncomfortable.  There is also a pet limit in the cabins.  IMO I would not fly a chinchilla multiple times if that is your plan. They are also have temperature restrictions that are more strict than a dog or cat.  They can not be flown cargo when the temperatures are above 75 degrees at origination or destination so if you get rejected from the cabin and the outside temperature is high you will not be able to put him/her on the flight.  Just FYI from lots of transporting chins.  I always fly them cargo to their new homes due to how hot the cabin gets.  =)"

chinchilla,39mqff,5chinnychinchins,2,Fri Jun 12 20:57:54 2015 UTC,"My experience is nothing on your level, but I have two boys who are rescues. They are fine around me as I've had them for 2-3 months now, but they go crazy if anyone else is around them as they have a huge distrust of people. The hide, bark and act distressed when they encounter a stranger. I would ensure you have a suitable place to keep the new girl should she not get on with the other girls you have as if shes been treated poorly and isolated she might not integrate well, but as I said before I'm no expert so someone tell me if i'm wrong! But any chance to rescue any animal in distress, if you feel confident to take her then do it! If not, I would at least inform some form of animal rescue as that's no life for any animal :("
chinchilla,39mqff,juuuules92,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:26:38 2015 UTC,I've had good experiences bonding chinchillas and I am confident she was I'll get along fine. If not I already have another cage she came be in. She never seems to bark. I sit there and watch her sometimes to see if she is okay in those situations. The manager of the store won't let anyone touch her though until after you pay for her which is bs. So I have no idea what her temperament is
chinchilla,39mqff,juuuules92,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:41:47 2015 UTC,"I'm sure she'll come around, especially if you're already very familiar with her current mannerism. I'd say if you have the resources, time and love then go for it! :)"
chinchilla,39mqff,violetfield,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:49:30 2015 UTC,:) thank you for your advice. Hopefully others will give me some insight too
chinchilla,39mqff,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:23:24 2015 UTC,Yeah the touch-after-you-pay thing is total bs. Try to speak to a higher-up manager (pet care manager is your best bet probably) and if that doesn't work request the information of the district manager.
chinchilla,39mqff,nmmtns,4,Mon Jun 15 04:55:54 2015 UTC,"Don't. Steel your heart. They are mistreating her, and they know it. If you buy her, you are condoning that behavior. They profit, and you and the chinchilla are left to shoulder the emotional and physical repercussions. Don't just try to save her, try save every chinchilla after her.  You've spoken with the manager and if her situation does not change, you can take more consumer action. Publicly shame them. Yelp, craigslist, google reviews. Take pictures and document their inaction. Inform other animal rights organizations of their neglect, and they will certainly have something to say/do about it."
chinchilla,39mqff,nmmtns,2,Sat Jun 13 07:53:27 2015 UTC,I went in and looked at him last night. They have him labeled as a her. He is pretty healthy. I get what your saying but who knows ho long the poor baby will be there. I live in Florida and petsmart only get one chinchilla a year when it starts getting cold so they won't get more chinchillas in. No to mention it is getting a lot hotter here. When I went to look at him last night I was sweating my but off in the store and I know it was close to 80 in there. He was laying on his side but they let me play with him and check him out. He was a sweet little fellow and really wants to play but as soon as he got done playing with me he just payed on his side panting. He won't last with it getting hotter and otherwise he looks pretty healthy. I know it's giving them profit but they won't get more in and he is suffering. I can afford the vet if he has health issues but from what I saw last night he is overall a happy healthy little guy. Other than being in the smallest cage ever and roasting.
chinchilla,39mqff,nmmtns,2,Sat Jun 13 14:31:48 2015 UTC,"How are you sure that they won't get another chinchilla after you buy this one?  I agree with /u/fuzzyfuzzyclickclack. Sadly, buying the chinchilla is only supporting the business, and it would not really be a ""rescue"". Lots of people think that puppies in mall pet stores look sad and take them home, which is how those stores stay in business. Complaining to the corporate headquarters on Facebook, leaving Yelp reviews, etc. is your only real recourse here.  You might also have a polite discussion with the manager about what happens if they don't sell the chinchilla. Does it eventually get put up for adoption? Go back to the breeder? If there's a way for you to take it in if it doesn't sell, without giving them money, I would personally be okay doing that. I wouldn't want to give them my money though.  And on that note, I would also boycott them for supplies, food etc. if that is how they treat their animals."
chinchilla,39kz0a,GuapoWithAGun,6,Fri Jun 12 13:33:57 2015 UTC,"How? If they are puddles outside of their cage, I'm impressed. If they are large sprays of pee it's because the chinnies do not like their new neighbor in their territory."
chinchilla,39kz0a,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,2,Fri Jun 12 18:00:32 2015 UTC,Are you chinnies females? They have a habit of doing this.

One improvement on the picture if you're going to do this in a pinch on a hot day: we wrapped the neck of the bottle (where they could chew the cap, etc) with fleece and pointed it to the corner of the cage to prevent them from opening the bottle and starting a vodka-fall.  Alphie & Euphie give super thanks to steamorchid (chinchilla-dad-by-proxy) for finding ways to keep them cool during this heatwave. <3"
chinchilla,399n6p,Tappyy,2,Wed Jun 10 06:40:13 2015 UTC,"Let them jump. But make sure platforms are underneath the high ones if your cage ia tall. You wouldn't want him missing his jump and falling 3 foot, might get hurt.  I built my own shelves for way cheaper then it was to buy them. I would recommend it."
chinchilla,399n6p,Newbluedude,0,Wed Jun 10 07:40:13 2015 UTC,"How do you mean putting platforms underneath higher ones? Sorry, just having a hard time visualizing.  Could you maybe send me some pictures?"
chinchilla,399n6p,DeathHaze420,2,Wed Jun 10 07:52:21 2015 UTC,"Some cages come with wider platforms for the lower section and narrower platforms for the upper section. At least that's what I assume they are for. We keep the wider ones low so she doesn't fall all the way down.  One time she fell in her sleep (edge sleeper >_<) and did the titannic propeller guy off all the platforms. I felt so bad for her.  Also, if you get the wire cage flooring you can counter sink some bolts into chinchilla safe wood and bolt them to the top of the wire platform to prevent her or his little feet from falling through the wire leading to potentially broken legs or other serious injuries.... (I couldn't imagine the horror of coming home to a chinchilla trapped by her foot hanging off the ledge)"
chinchilla,399n6p,DeathHaze420,0,Wed Jun 10 16:09:30 2015 UTC,So it's better to have narrower platforms higher up so they don't try and sleep there and such?
chinchilla,399n6p,DeathHaze420,2,Thu Jun 11 04:17:17 2015 UTC,"Personally, I have the wider ones at the bottom so that if she falls off the narrow one hopefully she lands on the wider one and doesn't fall all the way to the bottom of the cage"
chinchilla,399n6p,momo4020,0,Thu Jun 11 04:46:03 2015 UTC,Okay I see what you mean now! And. Do they like bridges?
chinchilla,399n6p,Newbluedude,2,Thu Jun 11 04:56:53 2015 UTC,"if you mean the ramps in between levels, yes. And no. But mostly yes lol. My girl uses the ladders when she is calmly moving about her cage. But when she is excited she is bouncing off the walls.  And if we don't give her enough treats she will pull the ramps off the shelves so it scares the crap out of us when they clang to the ground haha"
chinchilla,399n6p,blackdog917,2,Thu Jun 11 12:23:09 2015 UTC,Can you give some information about how to build your own shelves? I am looking into building shelves for my degus because they are sooo expensive to buy and ship
chinchilla,399n6p,Xesacra,2,Wed Jun 10 19:27:27 2015 UTC,"This is where I read how to do it http://www.chins-n-hedgies.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9311&page=4  I used 1/4 in- 20  x3 in hangar bolts and an 11/64 drill bit.   To screw the bolt in after the hole is drilled I took two wing nuts and tightened them up to eachother, then used pliers to the hangar bolt in the wood."
chinchilla,399n6p,illTakeCreddit,2,Wed Jun 10 19:46:27 2015 UTC,"The hanger bolt thing works well, but honestly a fender washer and screw work just as well with less steps and cost. You can get pine (make sure it's pine only) planks at home Depot and they will custom cut your wood so you don't need power tools."
chinchilla,399n6p,jennacrack,5,Wed Jun 10 20:28:54 2015 UTC,"Here's my old cage layout. I'll try to remember to take a new photo but all shelves have been replaced with wooden long shelves.   http://m.imgur.com/a/n752y  The importance of height and jumping spots cannot be stressed enough, that's what they've evolved to do.   P.s we've added more shelving all the way at the top so there are basically four height levels giving them full range of the cage, no wasted space except for jumping."
chinchilla,399n6p,illTakeCreddit,2,Wed Jun 10 10:03:05 2015 UTC,"I'd also suggest creating your own custom shelving if possible. It's way cheaper and you can customize the shape and size in any way you want to go with your cage!  I'm also a huge fan of fleece liners. I make my own of those as well. If you take a look at my submitted post history you can see both.   If you have the ability/tools I can offer more insight into how to create either. Or if you are more interested in just buying and avoiding the hassle, I have sold some to a few redditors in the past (not trying to sell, just offering. It is definitely more economical to make your own - but you need the woodworking tools and a sewing machine)"
chinchilla,399n6p,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:33:10 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I have a question. All the cages I've seen are tall and have been modified with new shelves and stuff. Are there tall cages that come without shelves put in, or would I have to build my own cage entirely to get something like that?  Building my own cage sounds like a really fun DIY project."

chinchilla,394rai,alira23,4,Tue Jun 9 06:37:42 2015 UTC,"If they've recently moved, it could just be from the mild anxiety of being relocated. We had a similar situation with our boys when we made the move to Florida. I'd just keep an eye on it, if it gets runny or misshapen (or persists for a long time) it might be worth a trip to the vet. But from what you've told me, the vet visit may stress them out more and thus make it worse, if it truly is a reaction to stress."
chinchilla,394rai,Babylon_Complex,3,Tue Jun 9 10:00:20 2015 UTC,New poops can be a little squishy.
chinchilla,394rai,Dalisca,2,Tue Jun 9 11:51:04 2015 UTC,"Soft poop can be caused by stress or by increased water intake if your house is getting warmer than they are used to.  Hard little pellets can be equally bad and a sign of dehydration and not eating enough from stress. Poops vary in shape and size depending on the chinchilla, but they should be easy to break apart with your hands and have lots of fiber in them.  I would give them more time to adjust to your home.  =)"

chinchilla,38zgqw,Dalisca,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:32:25 2015 UTC,Probably not. Fresh ones do smoosh and if you have piggies it certainly could have been one of theirs. Small ones are not uncommon and it doesn't take that long for things to work through the digestive system (especially with all the fiber they eat).
chinchilla,38zgqw,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:06:49 2015 UTC,"Chins do eat some of their droppings, so I would not worry at all about ones that are broken.  Some of their poos are all poo, and some have undigested food inside.  They eat the later ones."

chinchilla,38ybza,Ramenstien,2,Sun Jun 7 21:54:10 2015 UTC,"I got my first chins as a pair, they're brothers. I decided to get them both so they could keep each other company whilst I was at work. I'm glad I got two as I don't worry about them being bored or lonely whilst I'm not there. Plus watching them play games and cuddle up to sleep together is so cute :3 just be aware of the extra costs of having two chinchillas. It's two rounds of insurance, vet bills, twice the food and hay, and if there ever comes a time that they fall out you may need to invest in a second cage. Plus having a male and female means you could end up with a litter! But despite all that, I'm glad I have my two bod and wouldn't change it :)"
chinchilla,38ybza,juuuules92,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:06:41 2015 UTC,That sounds wonderful! We definitely wouldn't mind having two.

chinchilla,38ybza,juuuules92,2,Sun Jun 7 23:45:34 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but my biggest worry would be loneliness or separation anxiety. I've read a couple of stories of people separating chinchillas who have been together a long time and the one they keep just gets sad.

chinchilla,38ybza,5chinnychinchins,3,Mon Jun 8 21:32:13 2015 UTC,I got my two from a guy trying to sell a male and female together or separate and I only took the male. Neither of them would eat or move and wouldn't stop barking for three days. So I went and got the female. It's amazing how happy they are together and how depressed they were apart. I say get them both. They are veryyyy social animals and like to have friends
chinchilla,38ybza,5chinnychinchins,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:17:47 2015 UTC,"That's awesome that you got both of them so they're now happy! :) have you had any litters?   Also, do you have a round about estimate of the cost you spend for the two of them? If we were to get them both that would be the deciding factor."
chinchilla,38ybza,nmmtns,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:59:05 2015 UTC,"Yes they had babies. I got the male fixed but it has caused complications but the babies were the cutest things in the world. Because of the complications mine has had from getting fixed, I'm not sure if recommend it. I actually have five chinchillas. I can't remember how much I spent on two it's not much more than one though. It will probably only end up being only a few dollars more a month. Maybe 10 or so."
chinchilla,38ybza,Blue_Opheliac,2,Mon Jun 8 13:41:57 2015 UTC,"Is the male neutered? If not, they will breed and you will need to deal with litters. I definitely would not recommend this for first time owners, especially if you don't know the genetic history of the breeding pair. Without that information, and the knowledge to interpret it, you may end up producing malformed kits. This definitely happens... check out the ""breeding horror stories"" forum on www.chins-n-hedgies.com.  If you decide to get a single chinchilla, that is absolutely not a problem. Some chins prefer to be alone, in fact. I would feel bad separating a bonded pair, but they are absolutely capable of moving on, and rebonding with other chins. We've had chins die over the years, and the survivor has rebonded with a new (same-sex) chin every time.  If you get the pair, you could potentially have the male neutered. I don't have experience with this, and I am not sure if it would affect the bond between the pair, but just know that it is a possibility."
chinchilla,38ybza,undiurnal,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:10:46 2015 UTC,"If the chins are sold together, buy them together. They bond and it can cause health issues if they're seperated. Having said that, they're a male and female pair, so you need to keep a close eye on playtime."
chinchilla,38xuaj,purpleandpenguins,3,Sun Jun 7 19:38:57 2015 UTC,"Had the same problem for a long time. Your best bet is to scoop out as much hay as you can by hand, it's usually just a handful or two. My shop vac gets clogged on the longer thicker pieces of hay. Just make sure you get the biggest pieces out first then shop vac away."
chinchilla,38xuaj,pw3ner,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:01:57 2015 UTC,"For sure sweep up the largest areas of hay, and you'll need the larger diameter hose. If the hose gets clogged, I take it outside and stick a broom handle in there until the hay gets pushed out.

chinchilla,38xuaj,Nezhka,2,Tue Jun 9 02:25:00 2015 UTC,"Ah to tack onto this post, some shop vacs have a second hose feed on the opposite of the suction end that blows out the air going through the filter. If mine gets plugged I sometimes take it out back and reverse my hose. Blow all that stuff out rather than fighting it with a broom handle. My personal way after many many times of fighting with a clogged hose."

chinchilla,38xuaj,Sextooth,2,Wed Jun 10 02:54:33 2015 UTC,"I asked the rescue where I got my chinchillas the same question about shop vacs, the below paragraph is what they told me.  I live in a one bedroom apartment as well and ended up getting a 16 Gallon, 6.5 HP craftsman shop vac.  I took measurements thinking it would fit it my balcony closet, but with the wheels sticking out a bit it's a little too big, so I have to keep it in my bedroom closest (mistake on my part there).  I think it also depends on what type of bedding you use as well.  I was originally using the pine bedding the rescue gave me, and that has lots of large chunks in it, and clogged my shop vac at least once or twice every cleaning.  I switched to aspen, which has smaller chunks and that didn't clog my shop vacuum once.  I also tried the carefresh ultra (now complete apparently) and that didn't seem to clog it at all either.  Hope this helps!  You're probably going to need something larger than a 2-3 gallon. We've found that the most important thing is horsepower and hose size. You'll need at least 6.5 HP and the larger diameter hose. This is important because anything smaller and weaker will not be able to suck up hay and damp bedding. Craftsman is, by far, the absolute best brand. The filter is very easy to knock out. We've actually gone through about half a dozen shop vacs before deciding on our craftsman 20 gallon 6.5 HP."

My girl did it once or twice and we tied some of those kebab toys to the edge so if she flopped over she would have something to lean on."
chinchilla,38on1v,DeathHaze420,2,Fri Jun 5 21:11:32 2015 UTC,I don't think she has actually fallen that I know of haha. She normally scoots into the corner before completely passing out. But that would be kinda funny.... And equally as terrifying

chinchilla,389tnk,juuuules92,3,Tue Jun 2 20:44:24 2015 UTC,From my experience I believe so. One of our youngest was called Bighead for the first year of his life as we could just never think of a name for him. We eventually settled on Luis and he responds to this well!   We also once had a chinchilla called Carlos who turned out to be a girl...so she turned into Carla after a few years. But you could put her response to the latter name down to it sounding similar to the male equivalent.

chinchilla,385vh4,RedBeams,3,Tue Jun 2 14:35:45 2015 UTC,"There are many ways you can go about earning trust, it does take time but usually only a few months if you are patient and diligent.  Likely they run and bark because they are used to hands meaning they get grabbed and manhandled.   I've had a few sprayers and a biter this worked well for; I made it a point to reach in the cage and place or move small items but never touch or reach for the chinchilla.  I keep a rotation of toys and stop by the cage a couple times a day, put things in, take things out and once a day I'll make sure the item I leave is a treat.  Usually within a few weeks they know something new and exciting is coming in and start running up to my hand.  After that you can start making them work for the item or treat.  Eg, don't open your hand with the treat in it until they put their paws on you.   If you want to go further with training they respond very well to clicker or conditional training.  Lots of youtube videos on that.  Good luck and congrats on the new family members!"
chinchilla,385vh4,RedBeams,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:56:00 2015 UTC,Thank you! They let me put my hand in and pet their head right between the ears and I keep my hand in there so they can sniff it. Nobody is biting. What would you recommend for treats ? I've heard their digestive system is crazy sensitive so I don't want to make them sick. :x
chinchilla,385vh4,CensureBars,2,Tue Jun 2 14:34:43 2015 UTC,"I use herbs like rose hips, rose petals, hibiscus, and recently tried apple blossoms which they went nuts for.  I use a plain rolled oat if I really want their attention but those can make them fat so I don't use them very often.  They also love wood sticks, apple and pear are their favorites.  There is a vendor list on the lower right and they all carry chinchilla safe herbs and treats if you want good suggestions.  =)"
chinchilla,385vh4,CensureBars,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:20:05 2015 UTC,"Many chinchillas just never like being handled, especially if they weren't introduced to it (positively) at a young age. If these are pet store chins then they probably associate human hands with being taken away from their mothers, stuffed into boxes, etc.  Try to imagine the involuntary response this triggers and respect their space, even though they're cuddly looking.   Also, even if they're not frightened of your hands, they may just find your touch unpleasant. We secrete oils from our hands that dirty chins' fur, and nothing stresses a chin like having dirty fur. Make sure to offer a dust bath if you've been handling them so they can clean your funk off.   Last, just know that although they may tolerate being held, they probably will never enjoy it. Ours jump up on our shoulders and groom our faces when they're feeling loving, they'll climb all over us, but they never jump into our hands. Try offering the flattened back if your hand to them with your fingers together and arm outstretched as a sort of ramp onto your body. If they want to come, they'll come. If not, I hope you'll let them make the decision to stay away, because picking them up is for your amusement/warmfuzzies, not theirs. If you want them to trust you, respect their feelings."

One of our boys REFUSES to eat most brand of timothy, and the few brands he does tolerate he won't each much of; but he loves orchard grass, so it prompted me to mix the hays and it somewhat tricks him into eating the timothy as well.

chinchilla,37z0g2,PrincessCerberus,2,Sun May 31 16:34:11 2015 UTC,"I  have two males and am currently introducing a third.  With the first two I started with the new baby in a separate cage beside the other chin, they interacted through the cage bars only, after a couple weeks I cleaned the area my chin plays in really well and tried my best to get the chinchilla smell out and started letting them out to play one at a time so their smells were mixed. The following  week I started swapping them between cages so they had each others scent on them. By this point they were trying to sleep beside each other in the cages with the cage bars in the way.   At this point I started letting them out to play together and there was a bit of chasing at first but nothing serious. After doing that for a little bit I cleaned out my main cage really well, scrubbed everything down and put both chins toys in the one cage and put them in there together. They've gotten along since.  The whole process took me 5 or 6 weeks but it was also my first time bonding chins so I wanted to be extra cautious. It all depends on the temperament of your chinchillas as well.   There is also a chance that they might not get along, although I've noticed this is rare. With a third my current issue is one chin likes the new addition and the other doesn't.  Best of luck with your new chinchilla! :)"
chinchilla,37z0g2,SmileyCat2,1 point,Sun May 31 19:04:59 2015 UTC,"My dude is a very chill chinchilla, and I got a younger male who wasn't related to him and they didn't have much trouble getting to be friends. I've heard that if you have an adult male, a lot of times a younger male will work well as a cagemate, but be prepared to have accommodations to keep them in separate quarters in case they never become pals. It's rare, but it can happen."
chinchilla,37ydg8,juuuules92,4,Sun May 31 13:05:04 2015 UTC,"We medicate with syringes daily and have done for a few years, and for us it's about coming to an agreement with the chin and finding what suits you both. Making it as quick and smooth as possible really helps!  Some will love the taste of some meds so you just have to offer the syringe and they'll take it while still in the cage, and ask for more! (Metacam is always a favourite and our beige is currently taking her it as a treat after having her feet treated each night!) For others you have to find the way of holding them that suits them best.  Our ebony who's on permanent medication hates being turned on her back, but holding her upright, with her back braced against us she'll sufferingly accept her evening meds. Her morning ones aren't as bad tasting and though she doesn't like them she'll take them in the cage as she knows a treat follows and otherwise she'll get picked up and forced. Unfortunately having respected her 'no turning on the back' preference is proving to be a bit of a problem at the minute as following a vet trip she's gone into ileus and isn't eating so we're 'force feeding' every four hours, and medicating in between, and it's proving harder with her than any other we've tried it with.  General advice I give is, as much as they hate it, get your chins used to being put on their backs for a short time when you're not having to medicate as it makes it much, much easier when you do. It also prevents them associating it with just bad experiences and makes vet check-ups easier. Obviously that doesn't help you right now though.  I wouldn't say you need to hold his mouth open and that might cause more stress and open you up to nasty bites. Just push the syringe in till it's past his teeth then shoot a mouthful of meds, withdraw and let him swallow, then repeat till the medicine is all gone. If he's holding his teeth tightly closed at the front, you can go in at the side behind his front teeth. Even if you don't feel it, try to be confident! Don't worry too much about him chewing the syringe as long as he doesn't take any chunks off, but get spares from your vet or a pharmacy to replace them if they get badly chewed.   For the best way to hold it can depend on you. Generally my partner does the holding as my hands and arms are small (child-sized!) and the chins feel a lot less secure with me. He turns them over with their length against his forearm or tucked between his torso and forearm and a hand around their upper body, just below the chin, with the head tucked into the elbow curve. A bit like if you were holding a small a baby. Then I can nip in and push the syringe in their mouth. It can take a few goes to get the position right. And if there's only one of us it's 'get into that position as best as possible and adapt it for one hand'. But general principle is support the whole back, especially the bottom, tuck hands and feet in so they can't kick away or push the syringe away.    A popular method for syringe feeding is the burrito (one method here, there are other guides and vids on youtube too if you google 'chinchilla burrito'). I've never had much luck with it but I've seen a lot of people say it's the best thing that's worked for them.  A little treat afterwards always helps but if he doesn't like the taste of his meds he might not accept one for 5-10mins afterwards. He might also appreciate a pumice block in his cage that he can bite, chew and rub his mouth against to 'clean' his teeth.  Overall, good luck with it! He might sulk a bit but he really will forgive you and generally even if they don't like something chins are very smart and understand you're just trying to help them."
chinchilla,37ydg8,Pipiya,1 point,Sun May 31 14:05:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your answer! We attempted the burrito and he looked so cute all bundled up! Didn't work so well the first time, Olaf ended up squirming much more than before so we went back to hand held. `either we're getting smoother/better at this or he's accepting it more but giving the meds only take a minute or two now rather than the 20 minute ordeal the first time. I shall keep your answer saved for future reference as it was so helpful, thank you so much!"
chinchilla,37ydg8,spirouspip,3,Tue Jun 2 01:31:43 2015 UTC,"Hi! I had to administer meds through a syringe to my little guy a couple years back. Although he wasn't crazy about the process, I had good luck feeding him by doing the following:  -cradling him on his back (if he was extra squirmy, I swaddled him in a towel)  -putting the syringe up to his mouth and releasing a couple droplets at a time.   Be sure to give him time to drink up each drop at a time so that he doesn't choke or refuse it. I wouldn't advise squirting it all into his mouth at once. Once we got into the routine, he was much more willing to let the process occur, and it didn't feel as much like I was force feeding him.  I hope this helps!"

chinchilla,37stjf,Saxyphone,1 point,Sat May 30 02:43:47 2015 UTC,"It takes a lot of time and patience, it took my brother more than 6 months to finally get them to live in the same cage. Start by putting their cages next to each other to get the used to the sight of each other. If you can, try and let them out in an open area daily and see how the interact. Slowly but surely they'll get more accustomed to playing with one another. At first my brother's chins fought, nipped and mounted each other but slowly but surely developed a bond. The first night you want to try and have them stay in the same cage I would put them in there a couple hours before you go to bed and monitor them just to make sure things are going well."
chinchilla,37stjf,tepg221,1 point,Sat May 30 18:38:09 2015 UTC,"It certainly can take a while. But it depends on each of their personalities more than anything in my experience. I introduced a young female to my male (I did expect babies) and I thought it would take a while for them to get used to each other. But from the second they met, they got along perfectly well. She's a bit of a handful but he's super laid back and a push over so she can walk all over him if she wants and it doesn't phase him."

And also very sad for the chins that didn't make it.   Chinchillas were domesticated because they almost went extinct in their natural habitat- they were killed by the thousands for their fur. And honestly, if they're being funny, it means they're happy. It's you that's making them happy. They are social little critters, and they're our friends.  Hope this helped!"
chinchilla,37rzt5,jennacrack,3,Fri May 29 23:10:12 2015 UTC,I live in Milwaukee.  This story is in the news all the time.

chinchilla,37rzt5,Sextooth,8,Sat May 30 02:20:47 2015 UTC,"One thing that was pointed out to me recently is that in a lot of ways chinchillas actually really like their cage (assuming it's kept clean, is fairly large, has some toys/chin spin etc.) and the playtime outside the cage is more for the human then the chinchillas themselves. In the wild everything is out to eat them or turn them into a fur coat (part of the reason they hide in small crevices etc.) the cage provides a safe place for them, they know that for the most they are safe in there and everything they'll ever need is in there as well. To them it's probably a little oasis.   I've only had mine for a couple months as well but whenever I put them back in their cage after playtime (or even take them out a lot of the time) If they can see their cage they were will really try to jump out of my arms to get there, if the door is open there gonna jump in immediately when I'm close to it. If I block their view of the cage they don't really try to jump out of my arms. Since I haven't had mine for too long it may just be they don't fully trust me yet, but as long as you give them plenty of chew toys, food, water and a decent wheel I think they should be ok to be in there most of the day.   You could probably connect a playpen to the cage (making sure it's completely escape proof obviously) and leave the door open if you want to give them more freedom. Haven't tried it myself though"
chinchilla,37rzt5,dxm765,2,Fri May 29 23:48:56 2015 UTC,"I have had one of my boys for 3 years now, and my other boy for 2 years. They both get 1-2 hours of play time a day/night (depending on work), i allow them to go in and out of there cages as much as they want, and pretty much when they go in and stay in is when theyre done. They will sit by there doors when i close the door to there room and wait to be let out, they will be cautious about it, then run out, run around the room, back to there cages, n then they wonder back out. I think mine are quiet content in there cages, as they have each other, plenty of toys, and somewhat peace and quiet while im not home (they do have a radio though)."
chinchilla,37rzt5,KungFuPup,1 point,Sat May 30 00:01:37 2015 UTC,"Mine hop in and out of the cage when it's playtime as well.  They head back in to grab a drink, some food or go to the toilet before coming back out for a bit.  Once they go back in and hop in the hammock or stretch out on one of the ledges then I know they're all done for the night."
chinchilla,37rzt5,Dalisca,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:11:44 2015 UTC,"They're usually pretty happy as long as they're kept entertained during wakie time and not bothered during sleepy time; lots of love & attention required, of course.  We project our children by restricting them from going places and doing things that could hurt them. All we're doing by keeping them in a healthy environment is protecting them from predation, sheltering them from bad weather, and providing proper nutrition. :)"
chinchilla,37rzt5,juuuules92,1 point,Sat May 30 03:48:08 2015 UTC,"I give my boys at least an hour a day of playtime, but when I'm doing other things and can't supervise them out of the cage I talk to them and interact with them through the bars and the door. They only seem bothered when I come home from work, they're like ""yore home! Let us out!"" But once they've got their fill they're happy to go back. Providing the cage is large and entertaining enough your chins will be fine :)"
chinchilla,37rzt5,iceonfire1,1 point,Sat May 30 12:26:42 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way, mine seems to love being out of the cage and running+jumping around. Even when she's out, she'll run through my entire apartment as if it is too small--she's like a Lewis or Clark confined to Rhode Island. I wish I could take her outside!   By contrast, my degu seems much more adapted to a caged environment."
chinchilla,37rzt5,chickenpotpiee,3,Sat May 30 15:10:49 2015 UTC,"i honestly ask myself this a lot. i have had my chinchilla for 14 years and sometimes i wonder if she hates her cage or her life, and why i feel i deserve to have her cuteness on demand while she is forced to live alone in a cage all day while i'm at work. but your chinchillas will grow to love you and enjoy your company, and they are genuinely happy as long as you're a good owner! keep them stocked with a variety of toys and chew things, give them treats every so often, and they won't even realize they could be living in the desert or mountains of south america trying to hide from predators all day every day."
chinchilla,37rzt5,CensureBars,3,Mon Jun 1 18:19:26 2015 UTC,"I've had similar feelings since my SO and I adopted our first chin about three years ago. Witnessing the depth of his intelligence and general awareness made me contemplate his life inside the cage, which is something I still do almost daily.   The first action this prompted was buying him a cage mate, and buying from a local breeder, rather than from a pet superstore. Although a solitary chin can survive healthily with lots of positive attention from his or her caregiver, I don't think it's difficult to imagine the difference between a solitary life experience for most of the day versus a life experience with a companion of your own species whom you're able to communicate with and understand.   A side note: the difference in temperament between the breeder chin and superstore chin is heartbreaking. The superstore chin has learned to cope well, but I believe his time in the store and his very young life experience at a giant chinchilla farm has left him with anxiety issues. Please support local breeders with a history of raising chins with compassion.   As soon as possible, we bought the biggest cage available. We plan to continue buying larger ones, or building them ourselves. None of this is meant to be self-congratulatory. The cage and their play area is their universe. They cannot leave and do not have the ability to improve their own life experience. That is your charge.   Maybe the question of whether it's ethical to promote breeding and farm raising, separating chinchilla families, taking babies from parents, etc., should be raised. I'm not sure what the answer is. Our chins are happy and comfortable, I think. But is our relationship with them worth all of the suffering the system of pet trade and ownership (as it applies to caged animals) causes? Not sure. But I do love them very much."
chinchilla,37rzt5,Sexycornwitch,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:16:42 2015 UTC,"If you didn't have them, they'd be coats. Chinchillas are critically endagered in the wild because of the fur trade. They were domesticated in the mid century for their fur, until the fur went out of style and people realized that actually they are very nice and cute and make great pets. And you're putting them up in a nice chinchilla apartment and being their pal. I dunno, my guys seem to like being my pets. Tofu especially, he really genuinely likes me, he solicits attention from me, wants me to pet him like all the time, and gets bummed if I am gone for a day or two, so I know my guys feel my friendship and value it in their little chinchilla ways.   And my cat is lazy as fuck, her huge dumb ass would never survive in the wild and she knows it, so she's also totally down to be my pet I feel like. She's indoor outdoor and if she didn't like us she could just hop out of the garden and never come back but she never ever does because damn is she lazy. Also she purrs if I so much as look at her, which I think is cat for I like you a lot."

chinchilla,37q4yz,Kjerikaye,2,Fri May 29 14:49:32 2015 UTC,"I have this bottle too. I had to get glass because someone chewed through the plastic. I usually clean mine with regular people dishwashing soap, rinsing really well with first hot water, than cold water so the metal isn't hot if he immediately wants a drink. PetCo does sell a bottle brush that I find useful.  You have to be careful on the mouthpiece because of how the ball bearing works. I usually won't stick the brush down in it because it seems to break the seal and then chilla can't get water. I felt so bad the first time it happened and I didn't realize. Once I finally fixed it, Chilla drank for a solid five minutes! I find if the ball gets stuck, a solid shake or bang on the counter usually will fix it. I've gotten used to just checking every day. The key is the air bubbles. If when you jiggle the ball and the little bubbles come, it will work for them. if there's water, but no bubbles, it's just the excess water that's pooled in the mouthpiece."
chinchilla,37q4yz,GuenevereJames,4,Fri May 29 15:35:00 2015 UTC,"I went through several of these Petco/petsmart bottles when my first one stopped working. They were the only kind I could immediately get my hands on so that I didn't have to deprive mine of water. I've learned a couple things since I bought them:   when I first open the bottle I take the metal piece and flip it back and forth once. Sometimes I find that this ""resets"" the ball/suction once I've put everything together I hold the bottle upright and hit the bottle from the side on the palm of my hand until bubbles come from inside so that I know the water will pass through when my chin drinks    Since doing those things I haven't had a problem with the bottle leaking or not letting water through"
chinchilla,37q4yz,alduhkneel,1 point,Fri May 29 16:54:48 2015 UTC,"I had that problem the first time I used the Kaytee glass bottle from PetCo. Immediately after, it leaked constantly. I found filling it up all the way (the fill-line lies), flipping it over, and jiggle the ball until water comes out is a good way to make sure it work properly."
chinchilla,37q4yz,Tvvigzy,2,Fri May 29 17:23:05 2015 UTC,"You can always try a nozzle type bottle for him.  I use that type with a metal shield that sits between the bottle and cage.  Nivek is one of the brands, I am not sure if Edstrom still makes the water buddy.  Instead of using balls and gravity it is a trigger driven dispenser."

We forgot one thing, though. She will not allow anything to be on her top shelf where she sleeps. 5 minutes after putting it in there she dragged it off and tossed it down the side.   Okay, we'll just put it back up.  Toss  put back up  Toss.  You little bleeep  Eventually she kind of tore it apart and to get back at her I separated the braids and then tied them to the roof of her cage on her top shelf. Ohhhh was she ever mad at me hahahahaha. She'd jump up there and race through the strands, look at me, grab a braid and tug on it so hard she looked like a dog trying to get their toy. tug tug tug, bang bang bang, the whole cage is rocking. Stops and turns to me again with an evil look. Rinse and repeat until all that grass was down on the bottom again. I love making her mad haha."

We also have a tile for him for when the weather is hot. I put it up on the top shelf of the cage because he tossed his hay on the bottom of the cage. I forgot that his favorite place to do weird chinchilla yoga/chew on the bars of the cage is right where I put the tile. Last night he was glaring at me because he couldn't get any purchase on the tile while chewing and yanking on the bars of the cage. He kept scratching at it like he could dig through it and then looking over at me like, ""What is this?""  I also once put a treat log on his lower shelf. Usually he's okay with those and just lets them be, but this time it was bothering him or something and he knocked it down... And then jumped because it made a big noise and scared him."

If you washed it with a laundry softener it slows the absorption of liquids.  When he pees, it will puddle on the top and probably hits the sides and tops of his feet before it is absorbed.  The solution to that is don't use fabric softeners or provide a litter pan with some sort of bedding for him to go in.  You can use plain vinegar on a paper towel to wipe his feet and it will come off."

chinchilla,37ly4a,rebeccamarilyn,6,Thu May 28 16:16:08 2015 UTC,"I've seen three types of seizures in chinchillas; Sugar crashes - caused from too much exercise/stimulus and they will drop into a seizure after an extended period of exertion.  These can be solved by dietary changes and keeping play times to a minimum.   Genetic - seizures are random and inherited.  Calcium fits - not a complete seizure but various body parts will tremor and they will often lose the use of their back legs.  A vet could diagnose what type of seizures your chinchilla is having and prescribe medication to assist if it is not a dietary issue.  Sorry you are experiencing this, they are really awful to watch."

chinchilla,37b2wc,BlueBecky,1 point,Tue May 26 09:00:34 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone. A lot of people asking about the food mix. That's our base food which is Supreme selective pellets mixed with their new branded chinchilla muesli. Not sure how available Supreme pet food is elsewhere (I'm in the UK) but they seem to have a U.S. supply. We usually give them a bit of this mix with a few other foods each night, dependent on their mood and wellbeing.   The muesli's ingredients can be found here...http://www.supremepetfoods.com/products/charlie-chinchilla-tasty-mix/"
chinchilla,37b2wc,tadoke,3,Tue May 26 22:13:43 2015 UTC,WOW! That's a well behaved chin. Mine would be off exploring :) I am curious to the chin food in the container.

chinchilla,37b2wc,DeathHaze420,4,Tue May 26 22:18:06 2015 UTC,"My chins would literally be inside that box. No waiting patiently, not even eating from the bowl; rolling around inside the box of food."
chinchilla,37b2wc,Nezhka,7,Tue May 26 18:47:48 2015 UTC,"Same, aside from the rolling. She'd be in there picking up and dropping every piece while making eye contact."
chinchilla,37b2wc,stringythingy,7,Tue May 26 21:11:10 2015 UTC,That's what one of mine does.  She goes through all the food taking one bite and dropping it while staring at me.  She also likes to throw all the hay on the floor in the search for 1 piece.  That piece always seems to be at the bottom....
chinchilla,37b2wc,Babylon_Complex,3,Wed May 27 08:29:30 2015 UTC,"And then when you give her fresh hay, all of a sudden all the ones on the ground are tasty again."
chinchilla,37dejx,goodmorningcapt,1 point,Tue May 26 20:30:32 2015 UTC,"I live on the east coast so I can't help with finding a breeder, though if you look at the information tab for r/chinchillas, it looks like there are 1 or 2 rescues in California, so that may help you out. For cages Ferret Nation or Critter Nation are generally the best bet, they are pretty heavy as well so they don't rattle too much. I have a Ferret Nation 182, and it's been good for the most part (only had it for a little over a month though), though I did need to have them send me a replacement door panel, since the one that came with the cage rattled like crazy from being misaligned.  You'll also want to get a scatter guard for your cage, so the bedding doesn't go all over the floor, or use a fleece liner."

chinchilla,376x56,5chinnychinchins,2,Tue May 26 04:38:26 2015 UTC,"My little man broke his leg a moth or two ago. Back hind leg. I was told the only thing to do was have it amputated so I did. The recovery was quick and ever immediately after the surgery he was hopping around like he was born with three legs. I definatily don't regret it and it wad totally worth it. Don't waste money trying to restructure the leg. I heard from an experienced chinchilla rescue owner that it is a very very slim chance of that working and it costs a lot more. Mine got his leg amputated for around 180 dollars. After amputation I just let it heal. Make sure the vet does the amputation in the middle of the thigh. It leads for no discomfort later. If it is done at the hip, the chinchilla can possibly be in pain later. If you have any questions I don't mind answering them. But I do want to say it is way worth it to amputate the broken leg. They get around wonderfully and still run and jump like that's how they have always been."
chinchilla,375ucm,PM_ME_KRABBYPATTIES,2,Mon May 25 03:23:31 2015 UTC,Look into fleece liners....quickest and easiest way.
chinchilla,375ucm,xman813,2,Mon May 25 06:05:50 2015 UTC,"Just curious, where can you find these? I've been trying to find some for cheap for a long time and i haven't had any luck!"
chinchilla,375ucm,jennacrack,1 point,Mon May 25 16:40:27 2015 UTC,"there are some etsy shops that sell fleece cage liners, mostly for ferret nation cages. but it's pretty easy/cheap to just make them yourself if you have at least a basic level of crafting skills."
chinchilla,375ucm,_ataraxia,1 point,Mon May 25 16:48:02 2015 UTC,"We googled around and found some,  but then just did measurements and bought pill free fleece and made our own.   Wasn't very difficult."
chinchilla,375ucm,xman813,2,Mon May 25 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"Post us a picture of the cage... I can clean my baby's cage in about 5 minutes, but I built it myself to be easy to get into."
chinchilla,375ucm,browneth,2,Mon May 25 11:20:27 2015 UTC,"I'd like to know as well. I've tried fleece liners but between the mixture of uneaten hay and urine, those aren't the easiest to clean either."
chinchilla,375ucm,ProfessorPoopyPants7,2,Mon May 25 14:41:02 2015 UTC,"I've been struggling with this as well, I've only had mine for a couple months so I'm still learning as well the quickest way to clean the cage. I would say a shop vacuum is probably the biggest help for me. The cage I got with the chinchillas had rather small doors, and trying to clean the bedding without a shop vacuum was an absolute nightmare, especially since I live in an apartment, I can't just dump it outside, so by the time I got the pan out of the cage, I then had to to dump it in a garbage bag, which considering the size of the pan was quite difficult for me. My new Ferret Nation Cage has full width doors so getting the pan out is easier now, but I think just using the shop vacuum to suck up the bedding is easier, vs. Trying to dump it into a garbage bag. For shop vacs the rescue I got them from said the best brand they had used were craftsman shop vacs with a wide hose and 6.5 HP, so that's what I got and I've been happy with it for the most part, though even with all that power it still does clog occasionally on the bedding and hay.   To clean the ledges and what not I was told to just use a 50-50 mix of white vinegar and water (I also use it to clean the stainless steel bedding pan when I've vacuumed all the bedding out). I just wipe then down with that (after vacuuming any loose debris) and it seems to work well (mine are all wood ledges though, so it maybe different if yours are made from a different material) And I don't need to take them out and put them back on again every time I clean them.   One thing to remember is you don't need to clean all the bars etc. in the cage every time you clean it, my understanding is that you can  just do that once or twice a year and be fine. The things that should be cleaned weekly are the bedding, ledges, food bowl and water bottle. It takes me about 30-45 minutes still to do all that, I'd like to get that done to 20 minutes eventually."
chinchilla,375ucm,Sextooth,1 point,Mon May 25 15:40:13 2015 UTC,"Using litter pans and a broom has been the fastest for me with the big FN/CN type of cages.  The litter pans are 9 x 13 glass cake dishes, easy to dump and throw in the washer.  Then I sweep everything else off the floor of the cage into a dustpan.  I'll follow that with a vacuum once a week and it stays very tidy.    If your chinchilla is using the litter pan you shouldn't need to clean the ledges."
chinchilla,37456e,thalandor46,5,Sun May 24 18:30:53 2015 UTC,"Meals are usually Vyse's own adventure.  But every once in a while when he knows I'm around, he'll perch up on the ledge of his cage and wait for me to hand him nomz.  I mostly put up with it because I love him and it's ridiculously adorable."
chinchilla,37456e,BlueBecky,1 point,Sun May 24 18:30:58 2015 UTC,That's adorable! Such a cute little face. My two youngest will just snatch whatever food I'm giving them and run away to eat it.
chinchilla,375617,Sextooth,2,Sun May 24 23:42:59 2015 UTC,Let me know how this works out for you! I've been looking for a good playpen for awhile but I'm worried my Lucy will climb it!
chinchilla,375617,jadealwayswins,1 point,Mon May 25 01:31:04 2015 UTC,"The playpen is a decent height, about 2.5 feet. Both pinky and Brain can jump to the top, but it's at their maximum jump height, so it takes a few attempts and they generally have sit at the top for a bit to get their full body over and then jump down. Overall it's pretty good the horizontal bars are spread apart pretty far, so you don't have to worry about them climbing it at least, and it folds up fairly easily and it's also easy to add expansions to it and can be put in any shape you want. My big complaint with it is I just wish it had some padding on the bottom to protect the hardwood floor."
chinchilla,375617,alira23,2,Tue May 26 13:20:09 2015 UTC,"I've been putting a fleece blanket down underneath their playpen on the hardwood so that after they're back home I can roll it up and shake it out the window. I'm always watching pretty closely but my girl knows how to climb it and my boy keeps trying to bounce his way out. The girl, Cashew, is deterred by me just saying no so far which is pretty good and Peanut is much more conservative about his attempts so he'll bounce right off if I snap my fingers when he gets a grip. I was thinking of just making a cardboard roof for them but I'd love suggestions for something more durable.   Edit: typo"
chinchilla,372i27,plasticblue94,7,Sun May 24 06:34:31 2015 UTC,"Hiya,  Firstly - it's great you're giving a chin who's had such a tough start a loving home! She obviously needs someone who will take the time and you're doing a great job so far.  Do bear in mind it can take years for chins to get over trauma like that, a portion of it will likely always stay with them. We had two boys found in similar conditions - a cardboard box dumped in a park in the rain. They turned into wonderfully happy, affectionate little loves, but just the sound of the wind or rain could prompt crying, defensiveness and fur chewing from one of them for years after.  My best advice to get her used to being picked up is to sit next to her cage for a while whenever you can. Talk to her in a quiet, calm voice, it can be about anything, the key is getting her used to your presence, noises and movement patterns. Make any movements you make when around her extremely smooth, steady and slow.   While it won't immediately help with the catching and picking up, it will help her get used to trusting your movements, and help her be calmer around you. When you go to pick her up, put your hands in slowly and move towards her. If she shows negative signs stop moving but don't pull back. Just talk to her in a quiet voice, then after a little while move in again. It's hard but I think time and a lot patience are all you need.   I know some people will use a travel cage or bath to transport chins that don't like being held from cage to play area. While that is good, I firmly believe that you need to be able to pick up your chins and hold them because if they ever need medical treatment (which is likely!) it is so much better and less stress for them if being picked up and held is fairly routine and not just associated with negatives.   By the way, don't worry about the pooping a lot behind the toilet - chins are constantly pooping, if they stop in any one place for long there'll be a pile.  It sounds as if you're on the right track with her, it's just a matter of time and patience. Good luck with it all, Andromeda is lucky to have you and when she learns that she doesn't need to be scared I'm sure she'll be very happy in her new home."
chinchilla,372i27,Pipiya,3,Sun May 24 10:49:49 2015 UTC,I use the bath to transport chins who hate being picked up.   In my experience the best solution for anxious chins is to get a cagemate. You'd need a bigger cage for that and it's hard to say how your girl will react. When females live alone for a while they sometimes get bratty toward other chins. However they will usually accept a baby chin. The danger of course is they'd never get along and then you'd end up with two separate cages.
chinchilla,372i27,liquefaction187,2,Sun May 24 15:31:06 2015 UTC,"Do you give her treats of any kind? If so, try giving it to her directly through the open door of the cage, not through the bars. That way she starts to associate your hands coming at her as a good thing sometimes!  We have been doing this with our skittish chin, and slowly working it up so that he has to reach into our hands to get the raisin, eventually he has to climb all the way into our hands, etc. Within a couple of weeks, he is now jumping into our hands and sitting there to eat it. We've been very slow and calm about the whole thing, letting him take it at his own pace. Once he gets into our hands, we're very still, and don't try to move or grab him or anything. It seems to be working well.  I know that some people are not a fan of raisins as treats, even in small amounts. We give our chins one raisin a day max, but you could try plain dry oats or rosehips."
chinchilla,372i27,nmmtns,1 point,Sun May 24 15:44:41 2015 UTC,"I have two boys who were rescued from an abusive owner, and they act pretty much identically to Andromeda. Neither of the boys have any issues taking treats, but Sven will only allow chin scratched through the bars, Olaf wont allow touching of any kind. They both fur chew as a result of the 2 years they spent with their previous owner.   I've had them about 2 months now and they move away when i try and pick them up, but they dont bark or sprint like they used to - they kind of 'allow' it because they know im only taking them to the play area then they'll be let got straight away.  They probably will never become cuddly chinchillas like most others, but they are a lot happier and healthier now than they were before so thats all the matters to me. Normal chinchillas can take around 6 months to settle in a new environment, so in my case i'm not expecting any drastic changes in Sven and Olaf's attitude towards handling for at least a year. Andromeda will eventually get used to you, it's all just a matter of time, patience and love."
chinchilla,370ctc,guppymill,2,Sat May 23 18:07:29 2015 UTC,He's adorable! I'm happy to see he's so comfortable.
chinchilla,370ctc,mrowrtastic,2,Sat May 23 21:03:51 2015 UTC,He is our second.  When I brought him home our first didn't waste any time expressing his dominance.  Little Bang feels safe by his ma.
chinchilla,371ruk,PeterBenjaminParker,1 point,Sun May 24 01:37:45 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of TJ's but I have worked with Whimsy.  I actually got my 2 chinchillas from Whimsy's rescue a couple months ago and I've gotten pretty much all supplies since then from their shop.  They are pretty easy to work with, just shoot them an email with what you want, they'll email you back with the total price and then you pay through paypal and they mail it out within a day.  Shipping is a bit pricey, but that seems to be the case for all these smaller stores."
chinchilla,371ruk,Sextooth,2,Sun May 24 23:07:44 2015 UTC,"I second Whimsy's Menagerie...fantastic products, and I love that the money spent goes towards the rescue. I've spent several hundred dollars on stuff for the boys from Whimsy, and they love all of it. Wish I lived close enough to pay a visit!"
chinchilla,371ruk,Babylon_Complex,2,Tue Jun 9 10:56:20 2015 UTC,"Jean at TJ's is going through cancer treatment, so TJ's is closed until further notice. :( My chinnies really like her Megamonster and other toys.   They really love the stuff from Whimsy's too. Their farvorite is the Jacob's Ladder chew toy. If you connect to their page on Facebook OCCASIONALLY they run chinchilla naming contests etc where you can win a Whimsy's care package of toys. I've only had good experiences with Whimsys. :) Just wish shipping wasn't so darn pricey."

chinchilla,36zc5n,darknesslit,1 point,Sat May 23 12:09:38 2015 UTC,I couldn't find the pellets with alfalfa so I was wondering if I could feed my chinchilla with this
chinchilla,36zc5n,nmmtns,5,Sat May 23 12:11:11 2015 UTC,"If you can't find chinchilla pellets locally, there are various websites that sell them online. It is usually much cheaper than a pet store. You can buy hay that way too.  ETA: Here are a couple of sites that I like for chinchilla supplies: http://smallpetselect.com/ and http://www.drsfostersmith.com/small-pet-supplies/pr/c/6067. There are definitely others out there, so shop around."
chinchilla,36zc5n,blackdog917,2,Sat May 23 13:46:15 2015 UTC,"These would be ok as an occasional treat, definitely not for a pellet feed. If you can't find a good chinchilla food, a good rabbit food can be substituted. Alfalfa pellets are actually not necessary, Timothy should be preferred. Some occasional loose alfalfa hay is fine."
chinchilla,36zc5n,rachelmz,1 point,Sat May 23 13:26:35 2015 UTC,"Oxbow chinchilla and mazuri chinchilla are the best brands and you can typically find at least one of those in a petco or petsmart. They are excellent, high quality feeds. Also, feed fresh Timothy hay every day. Definitely don't fed your chin those things. I wouldn't even use them as treats. Chins have sensitive digestive systems so you have to be very careful."
chinchilla,36zc5n,cats-on-mars,1 point,Tue May 26 15:49:24 2015 UTC,A high quality alfalfa-based pellet is your best bet since you should be feeding Timothy hay on the side if your chinchilla is over a year old. Try to stick with plain pellets with no added pieces of seeds or fruits otherwise your chin is just going to eat what he thinks is the tastiest!

chinchilla,36wcmp,nunchi22,3,Fri May 22 17:41:24 2015 UTC,"Call the airline you are planning in flying with, you should be able to have them in a small carrier on your lap."
chinchilla,36wcmp,jedimastergirlie,5,Fri May 22 17:44:35 2015 UTC,"Have moved with mine, haven't flown with them. But if you have the carrier as a carry-on, if that's possible, then you'll want to make sure of a couple things to make them as comfy as possible:   Make a comfy bed for them at the bottom of the carrier out of fleece. Loose bedding will just get thrown out everywhere. Carry their water bottle with you. Empty it to go through security, fill it up once you're inside. Make sure to stop and give them water periodically. When we've been on long haul road trips with our chins, we stop and give them water every hour to two hours.  They should sleep once you're on your way. Consider bringing a blanket or something to cover their cage if they look like the visuals around them are freaking them out.  Try to book your seats in the quietest section of the plane, where the engine noise is least obnoxious. Make sure that their cage is set up RIGHT AWAY when you get to your new place! First thing is to put TP in the bathrooms, second is to set up their cage, third is set up your own bed. The sooner you can get them into something familiar the better.    Good luck!"
chinchilla,36wcmp,Meikami,1 point,Fri May 22 19:30:45 2015 UTC,"Do you have any specific method for giving them water directly? I think thats a great idea, as I've had to take mine on a couple hour drive before and felt bad about the lack of water."
chinchilla,36wcmp,ProfessorPoopyPants7,2,Mon May 25 14:43:09 2015 UTC,"I just pull over and hold the water bottle up to their cage while they drink. Sometimes they don't, which is fine, but they can drink if they need it."
chinchilla,36wcmp,Meikami,1 point,Mon May 25 16:57:27 2015 UTC,"Dang. I can't really give you any tips due to flying.  If I were to give you a tip, its as soon as you possibly can, set up their cage. Before beer and pizza even lol.  And Idk if it would help but maybe take a handful or two of their old bedding to sprinkle on their new bedding so they smell home and not a new, weird environment."
chinchilla,36wcmp,DeathHaze420,2,Fri May 22 21:14:44 2015 UTC,"I've moved several times with chinchillas, long distance but always by car. I have heard that most airlines won't take chinchillas in the cabin, and putting them in the cargo-hold is too dangerous. Calling the airline about bringing them in the cabin is your best bet.  Otherwise you could find local breeders traveling to shows, and see if your chin can hitch a ride. The website www.chins-n-hedgies.com is a good place to ask around for this sort of thing. They have a specific message board for a ""chinchilla railroad""."
chinchilla,36wcmp,nmmtns,2,Sat May 23 03:00:39 2015 UTC,We've only moved her in the car. We got a solid plastic cat carrier and put her soft house inside of it. We ran the ac the whole 8 hour drive up to sacramento. Keep in mind though that even though you're flying she will need water as they do drink quite often from their bottles. We stopped every other hour to give her a pinch of oats and some food and let her drink from a water bottle cap. She was really thirsty every time we gave her some water.
chinchilla,36tvnz,Nezhka,3,Fri May 22 02:08:41 2015 UTC,My first chinchilla had something like that.  Breeder told me it was genetic.  Never seemed to cause him any problems though.
chinchilla,36tvnz,Bumrak,3,Fri May 22 05:58:41 2015 UTC,"Was the vet definitely sure it wasn't malocclusion? Our vet could never find anything with one of ours and eventually we asked for an X-ray in which they found his teeth root was growing into his eye.   Other than that, only thing I could think of is a scratch or an ulcer on the eye. Did your vet do the dye test? I only ask as we have our local vet who does well with our Chins but she's not a specialist in exotics and has missed things before that we get checked out at our exotic vet who is a lot further away."

chinchilla,36tvnz,reemzies,3,Sat May 23 02:13:17 2015 UTC,"My chin had the exact same problem recently. I of course panicked and assumed malo, but the vet didn't think that was the problem and after 2 vet trips and an X-ray which showed perfect teeth (so proud lol) I got some anti inflammatory drops which helped. It still happens occasionally but the vet said it's just an inflamed tear duct and nothing to be too worried about. When it acts up I just give her one if the drops and otherwise she's fine. After the first 10 days of daily drops I have only had to do it a couple times. So... I think a vet trip (and probably xray) is in order, but it isn't necessarily something awful :) good luck to you and your little one!"

chinchilla,36qsld,SlamDady,1 point,Thu May 21 11:35:06 2015 UTC,"What are the dimensions of the cage you have? Mine is two feet wide, one foot deep, and three feet tall and it was made for rats but I took out the wire shelves in the middle. It's great but a bit small for my one girl, especially with a big wheel in it. It's the Rat Tower from Martin's Cages and it's pretty good, just a bit loud in my small bedroom."
chinchilla,36qsld,PeterBenjaminParker,1 point,Thu May 21 14:02:31 2015 UTC,"The price point for a used Ferret Nation is about $100. However you are kind of stuck with fleece unless you purchase deeper pans.   With that budget, you can get a decent cage on ebay, like this:  http://m.ebay.com/itm/310896256712?nav=SEARCH but you will need to add shelves. Not a hard job."
chinchilla,36qsld,blackdog917,5,Thu May 21 14:05:59 2015 UTC,I got my Ferret Nation from someone on Craig's List for $100. The only way you are going to get a big cage for that amount is to find a used one.   :)

chinchilla,36q33o,PrincessCerberus,5,Thu May 21 05:51:11 2015 UTC,"That's his ""back off"" or ""I'm scared"" or ""I'm about to bite you"" voice. My male does this quite frequently when new people try to touch him. You're best to back away when you get this reaction and reevaluate how you're approaching him. Food or a treat of some kind like rose hips is how we got our chins to become more interested in us.   There will be times of course that you can't just back away and need to pick him up, just be careful because that warning can lead to some harsh aggression as our male has drawn blood after having his warning barks ignored."
chinchilla,36q33o,pw3ner,6,Thu May 21 06:11:56 2015 UTC,"Hang out by his cage with the door open and be his buddy in his environment sometimes.  Then, when he pulls back from you, you pull back too.  Read his body language.  Remember that they're prey animals, so being chased down and caught can be frightening.  If we open the cage and just grab our girl she's unhappy about it.  But, if we hang with her for about 10 minutes on her terms first then she's a lot less reluctant to be picked up."
chinchilla,36q33o,Dalisca,5,Thu May 21 11:54:07 2015 UTC,"Some chinchillas never get used to being picked up. For Modjeska, I use bribery. The little pig will do anything for treats, and if I hold them up high she will now jump on my shoulder to get to them and I can take here where she needs to go. This is much less stressful for everyone involved."
chinchilla,36q33o,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,3,Thu May 21 17:56:50 2015 UTC,"Lmao, I do the same with mine.  That boy will do anything for a piece of dehydrated apple."
chinchilla,36q33o,beckpunk79,3,Sat May 23 17:55:33 2015 UTC,"Sitting on the floor usually does the trick for me. Mine will come up to chill. Quick careful scoops is how I'll catch him if he needs to be caged in a hurry, but never from inside. Usually, he's all too eager to climb out if I open the cage to give him some affection. Though we didn't start out that way. Mine never got vocal, but it seemed as if he didn't really care for my presence. He eventually softened, but it took time. Let him get used to you. Felt like it took mine a year or two to truly warm up to me. Have you attempted to pet/scratch him during the day? Seems like their guard is down when they're sleepy."
chinchilla,36q33o,Arraby,3,Thu May 21 21:47:48 2015 UTC,"Some chins never get used to being handled. Neither of my boys like being picked up, but they allow it to a degree. They've learnt that I only pick them up to take them to/from their safe play area, but if I hold them for too long they start to get restless.  To get them out of the cage i just stick my arm in and wait for them to climb up to my shoulder, using some oats or shredded wheat as a bribe, then i support them whilst i go to the hallway and just kneel down so they can hop down themselves. My boys don't like to stop playtime so when i try and get them back in their cage it can result in a little bit of a chase as they know once i've got them its home time, but as long as i'm not grabbing them or ""hunting them down"" as it were, them seem to not be too bothered by a quick scoop. As long as you are consistant with your handling, and show your chin you are protective without giving of 'predatory' signals he should come around to some degree of handling"
chinchilla,36q33o,juuuules92,2,Fri May 22 02:46:21 2015 UTC,Its an I'm scared or angry sound. Chins don't really like being held or grabbed. I use the bath house to move ours in and out of the cage. She's a sucker for a dust bath.
chinchilla,36q33o,HappyChilla05,2,Mon May 25 10:38:03 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it takes a while for your chinchilla to get used to you. My guy was 10 years old when I got him and I used to get the same treatment. My best advice for you is to become a part of his playtime. Sit with him while he is having his run, preferably in a smaller room or hallway. Let him run on you and around you to get used to having you there.   Also offer him treats and praise when he comes close to you (not too often though, keep him at a 2 treat limit per day!). It's going to take some patience and quality time until he is comfortable"
chinchilla,36pinp,PeterBenjaminParker,2,Thu May 21 02:26:26 2015 UTC,Replying as this is also relevant to my interests.
chinchilla,36pinp,anti09,7,Thu May 21 07:01:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know personally about flying with a chin, but please be VERY careful and see if you can find an airline that will let you take her in the cabin with you. I have heard nothing but horror stories about pets in the cargo hold in cages. A chin is so fragile, she could possibly not survive the trip."
chinchilla,36pinp,MrsDowey,9,Thu May 21 11:30:35 2015 UTC,"Oh don't worry, there's no way I would trust putting her below the cabin!"
chinchilla,36pinp,nmmtns,5,Thu May 21 12:41:16 2015 UTC,"Policies vary, but I have never found an airline that will let you bring a pet rodent in the cabin. I think the worry is that if it gets out, a rodent in an airplane can do some scary damage to important wiring. Having seen what my chins can do when out of their cage, I can't say I blame them.  I also agree with /u/MrsDowey that putting a chinchilla in cargo for the flight is a horrible idea. I wouldn't even consider it. Even larger animals like dogs have died traveling that way.  In general, I prefer to leave chinchillas at home in a familiar place, rather than stress them with traveling. Unless we're moving homes and it's unavoidable that we need to bring them along, we always find a pet-sitter to check on them regularly."
chinchilla,36pinp,AnimalLady5,5,Thu May 21 12:33:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely have many reservations about putting her in the cargo area, that's definitely not an option for us! Thank you for the info!"
chinchilla,36pinp,Nezhka,8,Thu May 21 12:48:11 2015 UTC,"I took my chinchilla with me on a flight when I moved. I used Delta Airlines and I had to call them in advance and pay around 100 dollar fee. I had him in a carrying case with a little bit of hay. Since it was during the day he did great and slept most of the way. Just make sure to have your air turned on so he doesn't overheat. It can be a stressful situation for a chinchilla, so I hope you can find someone to watch him. Good luck!"
chinchilla,36pinp,bella26piano,7,Thu May 21 12:43:54 2015 UTC,"That would be awesome! Do you remember what number you valled bg any chance? And yes, this is a last-resort situation. I'd much rather drive and be able to be in control of every aspect (and blast the AC haha)"
chinchilla,36pinp,nunchi22,2,Thu May 21 12:57:55 2015 UTC,"I investigated this for a move across the country, and was told by Delta that I couldn't bring them in the cabin.  There is one way you can get a chin in the cabin that I know of, though - if you have issues with mental health you might be able to get your chin certified as a service animal.   Otherwise, some airlines have ""pet cargo"" sections."
chinchilla,36o2ci,SohoFunk,23,Wed May 20 20:05:41 2015 UTC,"yes, your roommate is a shitty chinchilla owner. this is a pretty serious neglect situation. every single thing you've pointed out is a big problem.  unfortunately, there is no easy way to tell someone ""you're a neglectful pet owner and you should rehome this animal before you kill them."" is there a chinchilla rescue anywhere near you, or a general pet rescue that's familiar with chinchillas? they may be able to help you find the most effective way to enlighten your roommate."
chinchilla,36o2ci,_ataraxia,9,Wed May 20 20:35:59 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, you could suggest moving the cage to a communal, COOL room and ""help out"" (take over) with the little bugger.  The reason we stress cool is these guys are susceptible to heat stroke at relatively low (25°C) temperatures.  And hopefully when the little dude loves you more than its owner you can suggest taking him off her. (If that's somethinf you are interested in.)  I was kind of ""forced"" into chinchilla ownership myself and I think she may now be my favorite pet. It wasn't a neglect thing. Just misinformation. My brother was moving and was told that taking his chin through the mountains could be too much altitude change and possibly kill her so he left her with us. I'm no stranger to ""rescue"" situations, so we made some space for her in our room and eventually got her a nice big cage."
chinchilla,36o2ci,DeathHaze420,10,Wed May 20 21:47:13 2015 UTC,"I really wish any of these suggestions were real possibilities for us but they unfortunately aren't. There are absolutely no rooms in my household that are constantly kept cool. Even if there were, the electricity cost would be astronomical and I'm the one who pays for it so unless she's willing to shell out at least an extra $150/month so her chinchilla can keep cool, I doubt the climate situation will get better. I would consider gradually just adopting it since she has expressed desire to surrender her on more than one occasion, but I truly have no interest in owning a chin. I already have a happy, healthy, well-tended to adult cat whose living arrangements are decided weeks in advance whenever I travel. Having a chinchilla AND a cat would complicate that even further.  I've been feeling this way about the poor chinchilla for a while. I'm not sure if it's out of pride or what, but she does not ask me to look after it while she's gone. Last time she was on vacation I actually checked on it, noticed its food bowl was empty save for some poop and hay so I texted her offering to pick up some food at a pet store since I was picking some up for my cat. She proceeded to tell me to ""feel free to pick up some food if [I was] concerned"" and that she knows I did it out of concern but that unless she explicitly asks, I should just stay out of her room. So I did. She was actually on her second day of vacation when I texted her so the chinchilla proceeded to go 6 more days without fresh food/attention. The reason I'm coming to Reddit is because she has taken to giving me inaccurate advice with regards to my cats care which I've found to be horribly sad/ironic considering the treatment her own pet endures."
chinchilla,36o2ci,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,27,Wed May 20 22:47:42 2015 UTC,"This is not something I would typically endorse; but you should lie.   Re-home the chinchilla. Leave the cage, everything else exactly as it is. Tell her it was really hot and you started to smell something. You came into her room and found it dead. Obviously you're not going to leave it there, the house fucking reeks. Send her a series of texts while she is not there detailing this. Bury a shoebox in the back yard. Liberally fareeze the house for the next few days. Bitch about/mourn it on facebook. Light scented candles before she gets back. The chin gets a good home. She'll figure out she was neglecting it. You skirt around pissing her off. This seems like the best option."
chinchilla,36o2ci,Nezhka,18,Thu May 21 00:31:26 2015 UTC,"This chin needs a new home, ASAP.  Depending on where you are, there might be a chinchilla rescue nearby.  I also know that the fine folks at www.Chins-n-Hedgies.com will do a ""chinchilla railroad"", where they transport chins to rescues.  Thank you for being an animal lover and trying to do right by that poor chin. In the meantime and if you feel comfortable doing it, I would check in on the chin daily and give food/hay as needed.  If the cost is a problem I would be happy to donate money/supplies.  That poor baby. :("
chinchilla,36o2ci,liquefaction187,10,Thu May 21 00:14:22 2015 UTC,I'm amazed the poor thing is still alive! It WILL die one of these times. If you're anywhere near Minnesota and want to tell your roommate it died I'll come get it...
chinchilla,36o2ci,BlueBecky,9,Thu May 21 03:59:27 2015 UTC,"In this case I would not care about how to approach said roommate and just get that chinchilla rescued straight away. It needs a new home and love and care IMMEDIATELY.   If you want to go about lying to your roommate to take the blow off you (someone suggested faking its death), then I would definitely do this.   It really shocks me this person owns a chinchilla as they clearly know nothing about them. Putting the cage next to a working radiator is sadistic and cruel.   I am sorry to say this, but your roommate is a bad pet owner and does not deserve to own any animal. Get the chinchilla to a new home straight away, please. And let us know how it turned out. I'm feeling infuriated after reading this and now I need to go and hug my babies."
chinchilla,36o2ci,Fernweh1,7,Thu May 21 07:57:46 2015 UTC,"‘Fake its death’ was my first thought, too. But imagine she wants to get another one- then you have to confront her eventually anyway and tell her that she is not able to keep any sort of animal by the sounds of it. Oh what a bad situation- the poor Chin and poor you for being in such a difficult situation."

chinchilla,36pcs9,trf0ster,7,Thu May 21 01:39:30 2015 UTC,If they want to be in there together they will be haha. It's just where each of them feel comfortable. I don't think you need to buy another house or anything though
chinchilla,36pcs9,5chinnychinchins,3,Thu May 21 02:13:13 2015 UTC,I was always given the advice of having a hiding spot per chinchilla.  That way if they have a falling out there's a place for them all to hide away from each other.    I'm sure they're ok with what they've got.  One of mine loves sleeping out in the open and hardly hides away whereas the other  prefers her favourite house for a snooze.
chinchilla,36pcs9,KungFuPup,3,Thu May 21 09:09:48 2015 UTC,"I had a concealed hammock, kind of like a tent, that my two boys (brothers) would start fighting on who got to be in there. I changed it to a cardboard box house and now they either take turns or share. I think my boys were fighting for ownership of the hammock of it as Sven jumped in straight away and Olaf didn't care for it until later. Now the box home is a neutral ground they don't fight anymore. As long as your girls don't start fighting each other I'm sure they're just being nice and taking turns :)"
chinchilla,36pcs9,juuuules92,2,Thu May 21 17:52:23 2015 UTC,This may be because you just got them. I just got a pair myself and I noticed that for the first week it seems one of them gets some shut eye in the house while the other keeps an eye on us to make sure it's all good and safe. They take turns doing this. I'm not sure if this is the case for you if course but I don't think you should be concerned especially if they were sleeping together without problems in their previous home :)
chinchilla,36p4gi,fatal_kiss,4,Thu May 21 00:35:03 2015 UTC,"Did you vet look at her teeth? Similar thing happened with my eldest recently, he stopped eating as much and lost a small bit of weight.

chinchilla,36p4gi,BlueBecky,4,Thu May 21 17:48:20 2015 UTC,"If her teeth are hurting her, she might eat less.  I'd have the vet check her teeth, like BlueBecky said."

chinchilla,36d0n3,KungFuPup,6,Mon May 18 13:19:23 2015 UTC,"Same here. Apparently tthose oats are finger licking good.  I also shove my head into my girl's cage. But she doesn't lick my lips. Just tickles the hell out of my nose with her whiskers.  She knows if I stick my head into her cage that I usually have a treat in my lips for her so she will try to get that from me. I don't slobber on it. And she is really really good at taking even the smallest things from me.  She has ""bit"" my finger before, realized it wasnt the treat and let go bbefore she hurt me. Really gentle."
chinchilla,36d0n3,DeathHaze420,4,Mon May 18 14:49:58 2015 UTC,Haha yeah.  They get every last crumb off of my hand and then as soon as they're all gone they run off.  They only want me for their treats.

chinchilla,36d0n3,Nezhka,2,Mon May 18 17:41:50 2015 UTC,"I love it when they hold your finger. One of my little guys has some serious strength and pulls my finger back if he wants attention still. It's so cute, but also scary how strong he is..."

This might sound absolutely crazy to a lot of people but I've had huge success with extremely difficult chins with this, if you buy another cage big enough for all three, toss them all in at once. Its new territory for all. If you aren't going to get a new cage, switch the chins in the cages for awhile, 3x or so . they will all start to smell the same: then one evening put all three in the same cage. There might be a little fighting but they should have it straightened out by morning ( if not there are a ton of ways to try, I'm just telling you what had always worked best for me. I have to pair chinchillas a LOT)"

Cobain is just in a standard chinchilla cage, not tiny but not huge either.

As for treats, oxbow does have some that are labeled as kidney support. You should be able to find them at the local petsmart.

chinchilla,368p2o,whatsername121,5,Sun May 17 06:28:16 2015 UTC,I find putting down mats around cages helps a bit with the clean up. Also letting the Chins out on easily sweepable surfaces and sweeping their ledges every day stops poo flying out their cages. But unfortunately that's all the advice I can offer you!
chinchilla,368p2o,BlueBecky,5,Sun May 17 11:03:19 2015 UTC,You get used to it...
chinchilla,368p2o,themusicmedic,4,Sun May 17 20:10:15 2015 UTC,"You could put up poo guards in/on the cage to try and keep it in there.  Otherwise, you just kind of get used to it."
chinchilla,368p2o,Nezhka,0,Sun May 17 20:47:20 2015 UTC,I tried that and they just ate it
chinchilla,368p2o,Nezhka,2,Sun May 17 20:52:04 2015 UTC,Did you try wooden ones?  Made of kiln-dried pine?  Those should last quite a while.
chinchilla,368p2o,Dalisca,2,Mon May 18 02:18:18 2015 UTC,"Put it at a slight distance, like a fence."

chinchilla,3674dm,juuuules92,2,Sat May 16 20:25:11 2015 UTC,If that's the silent spinner. All five of my chins love it so much.....
chinchilla,3674dm,5chinnychinchins,2,Sat May 16 23:06:29 2015 UTC,Yeah it is. All they do with it at the moment is jump ON it it reach their food bowl then wonder why they run like cartoon characters for a bit. Hopefully they'll work it out!
chinchilla,3674dm,5chinnychinchins,1 point,Sun May 17 01:15:23 2015 UTC,Yes I wish you luck
chinchilla,3674dm,peskymuggles,5,Mon May 18 19:27:11 2015 UTC,Mine did the same! Moved her whole cage around to fit the darn wheel in there and all she would do was lay underneath it. Got the lazy bum a hammock and she likes it a lot better :)
chinchilla,3674dm,SmileyCat2,1 point,Sun May 17 00:02:49 2015 UTC,Neither of my chins really enjoyed the silent spinner at first either (I also did a new cage layout to accommodate it) But once they figured out how to actually use it my younger chin is always using it! The older guy prefers to just snooze all the time haha.  Hopefully your chins start liking the wheel too. Cool cage layout though! :)
chinchilla,3674dm,Kjerikaye,1 point,Sun May 17 23:03:59 2015 UTC,"It takes a while for chins to try out something new. I'm sure once they figure it out, they will be on it all the time. :)"

chinchilla,363ibw,TheMindGamer,5,Fri May 15 20:11:49 2015 UTC,It depends on how far down she's shaved.  Are you able to provide a pic?  If it's minimal or patchy you don't really need to do a whole lot.  If it's more excessive than that she might need an extra fleece blanket in her bed.
chinchilla,363ibw,Dalisca,2,Fri May 15 21:19:22 2015 UTC,"I'm back at work now, I can post pictures in a couple of hours.  The fur is patchy in places, but there are sizable areas of bare skin."
chinchilla,363ibw,blackdog917,2,Fri May 15 21:21:55 2015 UTC,"Make sure you aren't dusting her too often and don't leave a dust bath in her cage for an extended period of time. With shaved patches she's prone to dry skin much more than the average chin. Otherwise, I'd say she wouldn't require much different in terms of care."
chinchilla,363ibw,blackdog917,1 point,Fri May 15 22:31:50 2015 UTC,"I'm making sure to limit bath time to no longer than 10 minutes.  Pretty sure it rarely got taken out at my parent's house.  As far as frequency, I was doing 2-3 baths per week, and the vet recommended every day.  Do you think 4-5 per week would be alright?  Either way, I'm going to be keeping an eye on her skin."
chinchilla,363ibw,juuuules92,1 point,Fri May 15 23:17:11 2015 UTC,Even 2-3 should be more than sufficient I think. She's lucky to be back with you.

chinchilla,362mzt,fjord815,13,Fri May 15 16:05:40 2015 UTC,"In my years of chinchilla ownership I have discovered that chinchillas make a lot of sounds.   ""Keck"" means ""I don't like it"". They may been picked up in a way they don't like or they may have swallowed a pellet wrong.   ""SQUEAK, squeak... squeak...... squeaaaaak"" (Most people call this barking) Means ""I'm having a nightmare and it's upsetting."" or ""I'm lonely and it's upsetting"" or sometimes ""I heard a noise and I'm scared, where are you?""  A single sharp piercing squeal that trails off like the sound of a dying rodent means ""I'm perfectly fine, I just wanted to see you run in here in a panic."""
chinchilla,362mzt,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,3,Fri May 15 17:27:03 2015 UTC,"It's definitely the ""keck keck"" sounds. But he's been doing it a lot, like something is agitating him."
chinchilla,362mzt,liquefaction187,1 point,Fri May 15 17:29:16 2015 UTC,This is intriguing and I'd be worried too! I'm guessing the vet checked his feet? I'm wondering if you use wood chips as bedding and it's irritating something on his feet.
chinchilla,362mzt,sporks_,5,Fri May 22 13:51:48 2015 UTC,"omg my chinny did that squeal at 3am the other night for the first time since I got him. I was so scared, but then he just wanted to play. Little jerk."
chinchilla,362mzt,mechdemon,1 point,Fri May 15 20:19:23 2015 UTC,"ah, ok...so i'm not the only one who thinks his chins have nightmares.  I've caught them doing it in thier sleep, poor guys."
chinchilla,362mzt,juuuules92,1 point,Fri May 15 23:50:37 2015 UTC,One of my boys does it in his sleep. Definately chinchilla dreams! If nothing is medically wrong then at least you don't have to worry about him too much. Possible hiccups from eating??
chinchilla,362mzt,mechdemon,1 point,Sat May 16 19:03:39 2015 UTC,"Not sure, but one of them has always done it since I've had her.  They are in perfectly good health (had a vet checkup a couple of months ago) so no problems there."
chinchilla,362mzt,BlueBecky,3,Sun May 17 03:27:08 2015 UTC,"All my three chinchillas bark regularly, at first it would be if we were making too much noise but now I can just hear them doing it in the afternoon whilst i'm upstairs. I put it down to them hearing things with their big ears that we necessarily wouldn't hear and it probably woke them from their slumber."

We just can't be without squished peas and rosebuds!)  We also buy leaves and a few bits and bobs from Galen's Garden and I sometimes get things from The Hay Experts as well. They're mostly bunny based but like their name says, good for hays! I've recently been ordering their hay sample pack as my girls are not keen on hay, and less so if it's the same type all the time, so if I get a normal bag of one type I end up throwing 80% away.  I also used to buy from Only Natural Pet Supplies which was run by a lady called Trish who helped out at R&J rescue and was very active on chin forums but the website only has a front page now :(  And for hammocks etc. we've bought from Nox at Hammocky Hammocks for years.  Those are the only ones I can think of off the top of my head... it's  a shame that chinwags and other forums have closed down in the last few years as there were a few uk-based real chin lovers who had small projects selling treats, shelves and other things through there."

chinchilla,35uugb,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,6,Wed May 13 23:43:27 2015 UTC,"The unlikely outcome is that the water/cold/chills gives him some sort of respiratory infection. You should be able to hear/see this. There may be discharge from the eyes/nose and he will probably sneeze frequently, lose weight, stop eating, etc. This is very serious, see a vet immediately.   The more likely repercussion would be a skin fungus or infection, as you know. I would break the normal dusting rules and make sure he gets dust every day for a week or so. Blow on his fur gently to push it back so you can look at the skin underneath for a little bit in various areas over the next few days as well."
chinchilla,35uugb,Sexycornwitch,3,Wed May 13 21:41:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your help; knowing what im looking for means I can take him to a vet as soon as I see any symptoms. Olaf is a fur biter, so luckily any  fungus will be spotted very quickly - the only positive outcome from fur biting I guess! He bites due to bad treatment from a previous owner and we've only had him and his brother for 3 weeks so hopefully this wont make him hates us in the same way :P"
chinchilla,35uugb,Greediseternal,2,Wed May 13 23:41:51 2015 UTC,"I've had to pull both Tofu and Mochi out of uncomfortable spots before and they've been pissed at the time but ultimately they never held a grudge against me if I did something that was for their own good. (One time Tofu got his foot caught on some laundry and he was pissed and scared while i was trying to untangle him but once it was over and done with and he had calmed down and had a goji berry and wasn't stressed anymore, he ran right back to me to get cuddles. And that's how I learned that my underwear drawer is accessible to chinchillas even if the drawers are closed. I fixed it.) I think the kind of realize when someone is trying to help once they are warm and dry and the trauma and stress is over and don't hate you for it. I like to think that anyway, and Tofu and Mochi's behavior has supported it."
chinchilla,35uugb,Nezhka,3,Wed Jun 3 22:32:02 2015 UTC,"Hey I actually stopped to ask my local pet store owner who has tons of experience with chinchillas and helps me out all the time with mine. He mentioned that is was really unlikely Olaf would get sick from this event especially because you responded so quickly and correctly (using the hair dryer). He mainly mentioned that the real problem is just stress. He asked if Olaf lost any fur in the toilet. If so he panicked and would be more stress than if he didn't. When I mentioned he didn't cry out like you said in the post he said that sounds really good for him. He suggested giving him lots of love, toys to busy his mind, treats and to keep him away from the bathroom if possible, seeing the toilet might cause him to think he is gonna get wet again meaning more stress, just for awhile though (He suggested a week)."
chinchilla,35uugb,5chinnychinchins,5,Wed May 13 23:07:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your advice, it makes me feel a lot better knowing I've done everything correctly so far.   I didn't notice any fur when I got him out but my attention was solely on getting him dry as quickly as possible. Olaf is a fur biter due to mistreatment from his previous owner so he doesn't have much fur on his lower half TO shed,  but that's probably why he didn't call out - unfortunately he has most likely experienced much worse. He is still letting us pet and handle him though so he seems to still trust us at least which was my big worry, i don't ever want Olaf or Sven to feel fear like they did previously ever again.  He doesn't seem too stressed out for the moment, but will definately be sneaking him a few extra treats whilst Sven isn't watching :P I've left a dust bath in the cage just for tonight, but will ensure he gets a dusting every day for the next few days :)"
chinchilla,35uugb,Potated,2,Wed May 13 23:55:16 2015 UTC,"This happened to me!  Well, to TJ... I felt so horrible!  He escaped when I was putting hay in the cage, and I'd always had the lid down during playtime.... He jumped out by himself! I dried him off using a fan, holding him and fluffling his fur to get it as dry as I could.  Then I gave him the dust bath for a long while, and I think for the next few days.  He turned out just fine!  I'm sure your guy will be ok!  Just look out for sniffling/sneezing/watery eyes!"

chinchilla,35pm0t,Nezhka,2,Wed May 13 01:23:31 2015 UTC,"The wheel itself is quiet.. no squeaking or anything. However, their cages can really rattle when they are going the speed of light! Hugo is pretty heavy and it sometimes sounds like his cage is going to shake apart. The other boys are lighter, so it isn't as loud. One of them only goes relatively slowly so his wheel is quiet. The other two love to run as fast as they can and then leap out when the wheel gets too fast for them. My chinchillas are in the guest room, the bedroom next to mine, and I can hear them when they get going, but I've learned to sleep through it."

chinchilla,35jjnr,purpleandpenguins,1 point,Mon May 11 00:02:44 2015 UTC,"I inherited my dad's chinchillas because he didn't realize how much care they would require. Sadly, he had good intentions but the girls have a few unfortunate habits. I'd love some advice, if anyone can help with these issues...   They're on mixed food. From what I've read, I should be switching them to Oxbow pellets. Does anyone have any advice on how to work on this? (Other than ""slowly""?) They don't drink out of a water bottle. They have a water bowl. I got them a bottle and put it in their cage for two weeks, but they never caught on. My dad says their parents drank from a bowl as well, so I'm not sure if they understand. Is a water bowl dangerous? How can I teach them to use a bottle?"
chinchilla,35jjnr,cdzet,2,Mon May 11 03:30:52 2015 UTC,"A) To switch pellets, you need to ""slowly"" introduce the new pellets by mixing them. To do this:   Week 1: 3/4 of the food supply should be their old brand of pellets, with 1/4 new brand pellets (in your case, Oxbow) Week 2: 1/2 should be old brand, 1/2 should be new brand Week 3: 1/4 should be old brand, 3/4 should be new brand Week 4: 100% new brand   B) You should invest in a good glass water bottle. Chins don't do well when wet, and having a water bowl laying around could be dangerous. If they're not used to using a water bottle, you could try to hold it up to them so they can drink, or tap the ball bearing to allow some water to drip out so that they know it's for water."
chinchilla,35guj0,Tayloropolis,6,Sun May 10 05:38:30 2015 UTC,"If I were you I would just take them to the vet for a full check up, including fecal test. Maybe it's turns out to be nothing of concern, but at least you know that everything else is ok in that case."
chinchilla,35guj0,LiquidMetalTerminatr,5,Sun May 10 09:54:29 2015 UTC,Call the lousianna chinchilla rescue. Even if you don't live near it the guy who runs it will answer questions all day. He is super knowledgeable and enjoys helping.

chinchilla,35guj0,5chinnychinchins,3,Sun May 10 13:52:20 2015 UTC,Tale the mom's body in for testing. Some universities will run tests on them.   We did this with out big 4' Savannah monitor lizard when she died out of nowhere. they ran some tests and discovered a chemical that shut down her nervous system.   We took in some frozen rats that we had purchased for her as food. Turns out the asshole selling these rats gassed them. They tested positive for the chemicals.  Lost my little baby just trying to get a good deal on food for her....
chinchilla,35guj0,DeathHaze420,1 point,Sun May 10 14:24:56 2015 UTC,I would recommend taking the kits to the vet.

I was able to reshape it pretty well but still bugs me a little. But the wheel still spins perfectly

chinchilla,359q5p,5chinnychinchins,2,Fri May 8 20:03:50 2015 UTC,Yeah i figured i just didnt know if the packing could have helped it a bit. But other than that the wheel is great the chins are going absolutley crazy over it. Also what kind of apple stick did you put in the snack pack? We usually get them some but they went crazy over what you sent us. Bothing trying to eat it at the same time

chinchilla,3572ol,r3adyforanything,3,Thu May 7 17:24:22 2015 UTC,My two males fought bad for a year. Kuzco wanted a buddy and was curious but Edward was just mean. The only thing that has ever worked introducing my five chinchillas together was to take them for a long car ride at least an hour. Then let them out together in a room they have never been in and let them take a dust bath together. Then I always find them snuggling that night. It has worked all five times with all my chinchillas.
chinchilla,3572ol,5chinnychinchins,2,Thu May 7 17:37:21 2015 UTC,"This is new info! Thanks for replying too, people take my frsutration at not knowing what to do to mean I am bad I usually get a lecture instead of the help I want...  When you take them for a long car ride, did you hold them seperate or just one in each hand or in seperate little carriers? Also, been doing some more research and might change dust brands as well if that might do anything."
chinchilla,3572ol,5chinnychinchins,1 point,Thu May 7 17:40:49 2015 UTC,They were in seperate carriers. I just put them in the car and drove for an hour or two. It has to be a place they cant smell a scent from being there before when you let them out. If they have been everywhere in your house maybe try a closet. I hope it works like it did for mine. :)

chinchilla,354tkm,pussibilities,2,Thu May 7 02:49:11 2015 UTC,"Well the ceiling fan isn't going to do anything. It just circulates the air. Do you have any tiles or anything you could put in the cage? maybe even just a metal, glass, or ceramic bowl you could put in the freezer and they could lie next to that. Just make sure you're checking for the signs if they're too hot. Like if his ears are bright red."
chinchilla,354tkm,GuenevereJames,3,Thu May 7 13:02:31 2015 UTC,"One thing you can use, though our chins are never that bothered, is tinned food. Take a tin of e.g. baked beans, put it in the freezer for a few hours then take it out, wrap it in fleece and pop it in the cage. It cools the air around it pretty well.  You can also get a pet ice pod like this. But obviously it needs a good thick, fleece, chew proof cover and careful monitoring. Again our chins mostly ignore these but they do cool the surrounding air down a bit.   You could also use regular freezer blocks that you get for coolers. Put them on a metal baking tray on top of the cage making sure your chin can't reach them. They cool the cage beneath them but you need a tray/towel to stop the chin chewing and prevent drips.  Cool floors are a big help as the chins love to rest their feet on cold surfaces to reduce heat. Any marble, granite or generally cool tile-like material that you can give them to sit on will help. You can sometimes get broken or imperfect tiles from tile or hardware shops for free or cheaply. Again these can be put in the fridge or freezer for extra chill factor."
chinchilla,354tkm,Pipiya,1 point,Thu May 7 13:44:28 2015 UTC,"You could try freezing a water bottle, then wrapping it in fleece.  Or, putting small ice cubes in the water bottle.  Bathtubs are another option as they are generally cooler than the surrounding air.  If there IS a heat emergency (bright red ears as mentioned below), you can cool him quickly by placing him in the fridge with the door open and constant supervision."
chinchilla,354tkm,Nezhka,2,Thu May 7 23:33:02 2015 UTC,My AC blew out on me last summer when the temps were running above 90 degrees. I was freaking out while I waited for my friend to give me his portable AC.   I separated a small amount of dust into a container and threw it in the frieezer for half an hour. My chins enjoyed the cold dust baths.

chinchilla,354tkm,buhrit,1 point,Fri May 8 17:19:59 2015 UTC,I bought some terracotta pots and threw them in the freezer for a little bit. Then attached them to their cage with a bolt and some washers. My chins love them so far.

I have five chinchillas and they still get a good three hours play time out of the cage a day. Why do you think you wouldn't have time? I have faith that you could handle it If you tried hard. Granted I also go to bed at midnight every night and wake up at eight to get everything done. What color is your chin?

chinchilla,352c8s,THEsharkymiragical,3,Wed May 6 14:55:56 2015 UTC,"I have two dogs and no cat. Honestly, I wouldn't risk out of cage interaction between them and my chinchilla. I don't think they would mean to hurt her, but what if they were trying to play and stepped on her or pushed her off something? Chins are so fragile, you can hurt or kill one if you pick it up wrong."
chinchilla,352c8s,badwolf7850,3,Wed May 6 15:23:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think this would be much of an issue because my dogs are only 4.5 lbs and 15 lbs (the 15 pounder would likely never even get near her because he's a huge wuss), but I guess you never know. I wouldn't ever leave them alone together. I am just wondering if letting the chin out and letting everyone sniff and stuff would make them get along better? I just really want him to be safe, but I want everyone to get used to each other. So you think just cage interaction would be best? I'm not opposed to that at all."
chinchilla,352c8s,badwolf7850,4,Wed May 6 15:50:27 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have any sized dog or cat play with them outside the cage, but that's just me. I gave my chin her own room and decked it out with cardboard and PVC piping so she has space to run and I can just shut the dogs out while we play. I really don't think my dogs would do anything intentional(they actually sniff each other while she is caged) but I've heard of some dogs getting scared and attacking them."
chinchilla,352c8s,bella26piano,3,Wed May 6 16:05:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, yeah we have him in a room that we can shut off and let him play. I'll just do that and maybe in the future let them sniff each other while we hold them or something IF they are acting okay. My pups have never harmed any animal, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. Thanks for your advice!"
chinchilla,352c8s,prof_chaos86,1 point,Wed May 6 16:11:39 2015 UTC,"It probably just depends how you feel about it, and how safe you think it would be for them.

chinchilla,34xuta,tldap16,5,Tue May 5 13:42:29 2015 UTC,"for a pair, i would go with the double. i believe in giving caged pets of any type more than the commonly recommended minimum cage size. even with daily out-of-cage play time, they're going to spend most of their life in their cage. more space gives them more room to move and get away from eachother if they want to, and gives you more opportunities for adding cage accessories to provide an enriching environment.  you should also be prepared to separate your pair into their own cages if they stop getting along. this is easy to do with a double level ferret nation."
chinchilla,34xuta,_ataraxia,1 point,Tue May 5 14:02:27 2015 UTC,"Thats what i was leaning towards, thanks for the info!"
chinchilla,34xuta,TrikyPenguin,1 point,Tue May 5 17:24:29 2015 UTC,Critter nation would also be a good choice.  Ours liked to climb up the walls in their old cage and they wouldn't be able to do that with the ferret nation as the bars are vertical. Critter has Horizontal bars
chinchilla,34xuta,ashleyj1988,3,Wed May 6 22:09:25 2015 UTC,"The bigger the habitat the better. They love the space to jump around if you do a lot of ledges, aluminum wheel, hammock, etc. Definitely go for the double, especially with 2 chinchillas! Treats you can wait on. I have 4 chinchillas and would encourage any out of the cage play time, however make sure there are no wires or anything for them to get into....they can get almost anywhere they want lol. I use our tile floor bathroom for ours to play in, but I make sure first that everything breakable has been set somewhere else, no chemicals or any plastics laying around, and the toilet seat is closed. Mine love to try and jump on top of the toilet and counter for some reason. Also, if you can't catch them after letting them run around a room, sometimes you can set the dust bath out in the middle of the floor and they will get in it....it is a great way to safely trap/catch them. Mine know the sound of the treat jar so I just shake the treats and all of them come running back to wherever I am. They are wonderful pets and definitely be sure to get some research in before getting them! I swear I am still learning new things every day about them!"
chinchilla,34xuta,chickenpotpiee,2,Tue May 5 15:02:22 2015 UTC,thanks so much!
chinchilla,34xuta,chickenpotpiee,5,Tue May 5 17:24:11 2015 UTC,you should DEFINITELY let them out for playtime when they are young! handling them a lot at the early stages is really important for getting them to trust you and become accustomed to humans. i also give my chinchilla tons of treats and i have since she was really little but my vet told me that she's overweight now so maybe don't take advice from me on that front... she is about to turn 14 however so they honestly can't be that bad

chinchilla,34ur9p,juuuules92,4,Mon May 4 18:57:22 2015 UTC,"Get the critter nation single level, or the double level if you really want to spoil them!  I bought the 2 level for my 3 chins and they loooooove it.  Way bigger than their previous cage and I've def noticed a change in their energy levels & personalities since moving them into the critter nation.  They are much happier!"
chinchilla,34ur9p,TrikyPenguin,1 point,Mon May 4 20:15:41 2015 UTC,unofrtunately i cannot find a critter nation in the UK for a reasonable price.

chinchilla,34ur9p,KungFuPup,1 point,Mon May 4 23:47:29 2015 UTC,That looks like a good size cage. It's similar to the one I have.  I took out the ramps and shelves and put in some nice wooden platforms for  mine (we had wire shelving and I was worried they'd get a leg stuck).    Having wheels really helps so we can drag it out and clean all the hay they love to throw down the back.
chinchilla,34ur9p,TrikyPenguin,1 point,Tue May 5 08:47:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, that looks like a good size cage for two.  I too would also remove the wire flooring and put in wood ramps/levels.  Our chins fur got so much better moving to solid levels as they didn't pee/poo or spill food & water on whoever was down below anymore."
chinchilla,34ur9p,Skrilmaufive,3,Tue May 5 18:32:22 2015 UTC,Get a double level critter nation. Would never buy a different cage after owning one.

chinchilla,34ssdv,Yelvies,1 point,Mon May 4 06:45:11 2015 UTC,"My wife and I share this account and have had these guys for about 4 months now and they are completely different in personality.  Bumi, on the left is very independent and does what he wants. He doesn't like being held and is generally our troublemaker. He loves sleeping in the hammock and goes extremely bonkers for the dust bath and treats. Mallow on the right is our crybaby, hence the name Mallow. He sometimes cries in the middle of the night and will stop as soon as we check on him. He doesn't use the hammock like his brother but will lay under the hammock so it's resting on his back. He's also our climber and will climb the cage bars and try to scale everything."

chinchilla,34rpcm,juuuules92,1 point,Mon May 4 00:00:43 2015 UTC,"i've never introduced a chinchilla, so i can't offer any experience; however i would suggest letting your chinchilla get used to you first before you start introducing any new chinchillas. It might be quite overwhelming for your chinchilla to be in a new home with a new person then suddenly having a cage mate.  In terms of the cage, the bigger the better! You want enough room for your chin to run around and jump, as well as areas to eat, sleep, drink and exercise."
chinchilla,34rpcm,Skrilmaufive,1 point,Mon May 4 22:50:07 2015 UTC,can you post a pic of the cage you have? I have   http://www.wayfair.com/Midwest-Homes-For-Pets-Ferret-Nation-Double-Unit-Cage-182-L1314-K~MDW1342.html?refid=GX50899331580-MDW1342&device=c&ptid=75694824060&gclid=CjwKEAjw1KGqBRC55bru-sa7zCcSJAAxsBf5FO0KMfk4gTHVmzGagr6yA1n-A6wgQVpPi-mrT4G9phoCoB_w_wcB   for my 2 girls.   I recommend waiting at least a month until getting another. Introducing chinchillas is HARD work. and you're gonna make it very stressful for them if they're both getting used to you (and each other) at the same time.
chinchilla,34rpcm,juuuules92,1 point,Tue May 5 00:01:27 2015 UTC,"What exactly are good treats to give chinchillas?   I read that dried fruits such as bananas, raisins, apricot and cranberries are fine in small doses, but then some user of another chinchilla forum starting giving me quite a hard time saying that this will kill them!! Obviously i don't want to make my boys ill, but I've read so many times that dried fruit is absolutely fine (in small doses and only once a day of course)!   For the moment i'm sticking to shredded wheat, porridge oats and hay. But i'm so confused with everyone saying some things are fine and some things aren't??"
chinchilla,34rpcm,Skrilmaufive,2,Tue May 5 13:21:16 2015 UTC,"Hay, rolled oats, and the VERY occasional, like once or twice a week, raisin. (or piece of dried fruit)  This will keep your chins happy and healthy."

chinchilla,34oziy,5chinnychinchins,2,Sun May 3 16:06:19 2015 UTC,"I have a small guy too. At first I was afraid I wasn't feeding him enough. Then I read on here somewhere that someone thought had a runt chinchilla and I thought about my teeny one, took him to my vet and she said he was really healthy and not malnourishly skinny or even skinny at all. So I'm just keeping on with what I'm doing. Giving him same amount of food and grasses. He's seems to be happy being the little guy. :)"
chinchilla,34oziy,danyelledatme,2,Sun May 3 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"Bear is about the average size of chinchillas in the wild.  They do vary a lot in size (kinda' like people do), so the averages are pretty much just averages.  My breeder has a few that look almost the size of a cat.  Having healthy proportions is much more important than a number.  A very underweight chinchilla will have visible shoulder blades on their back reminiscent of a buffalo.  Keep in mind, also, that they can continue to grow until they hit about two years old, and a one-year-old chinchilla is still a juvenile."
chinchilla,34oziy,Dalisca,2,Sun May 3 19:57:27 2015 UTC,I believe there are such things as dwarf chinchillas... could he be one of those?
chinchilla,34oziy,Nezhka,2,Sun May 3 23:32:39 2015 UTC,"As long as Smokey and Bear are happy and healthy I wouldnt worry too much about their size :) My boys seem extremely skinny compared to all the chins ive seen on here. It could be that because they are fur biters from experiences with a previous owner that they just seem smaller, but they eat all night so im not too worried."
chinchilla,34oziy,juuuules92,2,Mon May 4 23:51:18 2015 UTC,"My 9-year-old chinchilla, Pogo, is usually right at the very minimum weight that my vet is comfortable with and has been that way his entire life.

chinchilla,34m356,petreeee,4,Sat May 2 13:16:24 2015 UTC,I prefer to use a scent free detergent and I'll use some vinegar too which helps remove odors
chinchilla,34m356,dripless_cactus,4,Sat May 2 19:16:58 2015 UTC,"I do a ""rinse"" cycle with 1/2 to 1 cup of white vinegar, which gets out most of the odor. Then I regular wash with Tide, hang to dry. I've heard that if you put the vinegar (acidic) and detergent (basic) together they change the pH and don't clean as well so thats why I do it separately. I do recommend using the vinegar step, they smell so much cleaner with it! And you can buy huge containers of vinegar at Costco. I've also heard that adding fabric softener makes the fleece repel liquid so the pee is more likely to be stepped in and spread around (eww)."
chinchilla,34m356,thatblondgirl,1 point,Sat May 2 19:57:50 2015 UTC,"I've had no issues with regular detergent, but I have also read not to use softener nor dryer sheets. A gentle wash cycle with Tide has worked for us for years, and we've never had an issue with health or scent."

They make that noise maybe once or twice a day for no good reason.   If they want attention, mine make high pitched quiet squeaks.   I actually think if something is really wrong, a chinchilla will try to make no noise at all. Stuff to be concerned about would be not moving around for more than an hour at night (during the day they're sleepy and lazy), not pooping, not eating or drinking, crusty eyes, labored breathing."
chinchilla,34f8by,liquefaction187,3,Thu Apr 30 17:43:45 2015 UTC,"It's not their bark. It kind of does sound like a squeaky bone I have for my dog, and I don't have him with me. My friend wanted this to very low on the stress meter for them.   They are super active at night! So that's a great sign! I'd feel awful if something were to happen to them.  Thank you so much for that input!"
chinchilla,34f8by,bella26piano,8,Thu Apr 30 17:57:20 2015 UTC,"They're probably just confused about the situation. It's the sound they make in the wild when they want to locate lost members of their pack. So maybe they are trying to call your friend? Haha. Anyway, that sound does not indicate pain, except maybe emotional...  So don't worry about it, as soon as your friend is back and their lives and routines are back to what they used to be, they will be fine."

chinchilla,34fs8h,Kjerikaye,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:53:36 2015 UTC,I would go to the vet ASAP. They should take a stool sample and test it for parasites. Most likely Giardia. I am treating 2 of my chins for it right now. They should retest after being treated also. Clean everything in the cage with vinegar. If you have a dishwasher you can sanitize the water bottle that way. Change out the wood ledges if you can after treatment (if they end up positive for Giardia). Good luck.

chinchilla,33rpjh,Crannins,2,Fri Apr 24 23:54:52 2015 UTC,"So after a few weeks of contemplating, me and my girlfriend (Juuuules92) adopted a couple of chinchillas - I'm sure you're aware of Sven and his furbiting habits.   Needless to say these little guys have had a big impact on our household and I'm glad we got them - They're pretty cool!"
chinchilla,33rpjh,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,2,Fri Apr 24 23:55:34 2015 UTC,Poor things look so goofy! I'm sure with your TLC they will fluff out in no time.
chinchilla,33rpjh,JakeAndBake,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:11:02 2015 UTC,How is Sven's fur growing back btw? It looks fuller :-)
chinchilla,33rpjh,juuuules92,2,Sat Apr 25 08:04:24 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm the other half to the family! :3 Sven is doing much better! He is generally fuzzier overall, and he has longer strands that are beginning to match the color of his coat that hasnt been chewed so hopefully ina  few months he'll have a full coat again:)  We're not too bothered about his fur growing back in if it turns out it's just a bad habit he has, we're just happy that he's healthy and the boys finally seem settled in their new home - we'll love our boys even if they furbite :3"

chinchilla,33oill,HappyChilla05,0,Fri Apr 24 05:10:30 2015 UTC,Can confirm these wheels are fantastic! Got the silent upgraded version and my boys are constantly running on it.
chinchilla,33oill,djh3315,0,Sat Apr 25 00:39:04 2015 UTC,Excellent! glad to hear it. Robert @ happychilla
chinchilla,33oill,fatal_kiss,0,Sat Apr 25 01:32:34 2015 UTC,"I love the original one even though it's noisy! The size is great, it's sturdy, easy to clean, & my babies don't chew on it! I want to get the upgraded version once I have a few bucks in my pocket, but until then - is there a way I can quiet this one down? It sometimes wakes me up during the lighter sleep cycles"
chinchilla,33oill,Jiggerjuice,0,Mon Apr 27 04:02:59 2015 UTC,"Well, unfortunately, the original will be noisy no matter what. That's why the upgraded version is praised for it's quietness. For now, a few drops of cooking oil on the bearing will help with the noise. Robert@happychilla"
chinchilla,33oo3f,ObscurusXII,2,Fri Apr 24 06:17:11 2015 UTC,"Personally I think it's 70% personality, 30% training/being used to it. Some just are a lot more laid back and happy to be touched and held than others. That's my view from having several who've all been treat and handled the same but who vary greatly in happiness at being cuddled and have different preferred styles of being handled. It also depends on them being handled from a very young age so it's not completely alien to them. (They're naturally skittish prey animals so I'd say being held by a giant human is rather against their nature).  One thing I would say is make sure you do handle your chins regularly even if they don't really like it much. Get them used to being held so that they know it doesn't equate to being hurt and it doesn't always mean something bad (vets/medicine/hand feeding). It makes treating and medicating them so much easier, and less stressful for the chin, if something ever does go wrong. We've had compliments from the vet on how chilled our chins have been at being put on their backs and being prodded and poked!  Just be careful of their little floating ribcages when you handle them!  Edited for a spelling mistake."
chinchilla,33oo3f,Pipiya,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:36:27 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the detailed reply! Its a big help.  A final question; do chinchillas change a lot with age?
chinchilla,33oo3f,Pipiya,2,Fri Apr 24 13:45:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, temperament wise I'd say so. Physically they don't change much and it's quite hard to age an adult chin as they usually look roughly the same at 4 or 14.   For interactions with their humans I think the biggest changes come from time rather than age though it is a factor. The longer you show that you're a constant, safe, protector in their lives the happier, more secure and comfortable they get (doesn't hurt when you're the provider of food and treats too!).  It helps if you are always constant and slow and steady with your movements too.   Temperament-wise, most mellow and relax with age usually, becoming less energetic and more settled in their ways. But of course that varies chin to chin!   (That's my, limited, experience anyway)"
chinchilla,33oo3f,TrikyPenguin,2,Fri Apr 24 14:09:13 2015 UTC,"Gf and I have 4 chins, our oldest will sit with us on the couch and chill.  The other 3 which are all only a couple years old just LOOVEE to explore.  So trying to sit with them, they just want to go ripping around the house non stop and won't sit still :P"
chinchilla,33oo3f,Kjerikaye,3,Fri Apr 24 14:47:30 2015 UTC,"Very normal for chinchillas to not like being held or cuddled!  :( One of my boys, Remy, will tolerate it, but he's clearly just like ""oh let this be over please."" it isn't his favorite thing. Remy came from a breeder who held him every day, so I believe that helped him not be too afraid, just irritated.   My boy Hugo will put up with being held if we are near the TV or looking out the window. I think that helps him forget that he is Being Controlled. But he gets very wriggly after a short while.  Poor Willoughby shakes when you hold him. He is really scared, so I try not to pick him up very often, just when I have to. He does love a good scritching though.  So, yes, your chin is very very normal. :)  Sherry"
chinchilla,33okgv,countchocula535,2,Fri Apr 24 05:32:27 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say I'm afraid. It could easily be nothing at all but it could be indicative of an infection or something else. Is the fur around the eye wet at all? Does the white of the eye look red if you can see any of it?  It could just be that she got a piece of dust in it, or she's sleepy - mine sometimes spend ages 'winking' when they're sleepy. But it could also be a couple of other things like an infection, scratch on the eyeball, blocked tear ducts etc. If it goes today I would keep an eye on her but not worry too much. However if it's the same in the morning a check up by the vet is in order.  Try not to worry too much, but get her to the vets if it continues."
chinchilla,33okgv,Pipiya,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:55:24 2015 UTC,"The fur around her eyes both look normal!  Also, her eyes are all very red, she's albino!  So that doesn't really help indicate much, BUT it's worth nothing that both eyes are the same shade of red.  Thanks for the advice.  I will probably take her to the vet regardless, but hopefully it is nothing serious!"
chinchilla,33okgv,susubgugu,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"Update for anyone interested:  turned out to be an ulcer :( I was given pain killers to apply orally and a gel to apply directly to her eye.  Hopefully the treatment does it's job!  The fur around her eye is kind of goopy thanks to the medicine, but I guess that's to be expected for now."
chinchilla,33m19j,juuuules92,4,Thu Apr 23 16:49:53 2015 UTC,"Ours usually only sleep on their sides after they have had a lot of exercise. Otherwise, they tend to sleep upright. It seems to be pretty much the same for all 5 of them, so I assumed it was just an indication of how worn out/hot they were."
chinchilla,33m19j,sosuhme,2,Thu Apr 23 17:15:18 2015 UTC,"My 2 are funny, one sleeps on his side sometimes curled around his food bowl or in his house on his side. The other sleeps sitting up, or laying like he's ready to pounce when i open the door, he used to sleep in the hammock alot, but not recently"
chinchilla,33m19j,dxm765,3,Thu Apr 23 17:15:43 2015 UTC,"I think chinchillas sleep in different ways depending on what makes them feel safe the most.   You mentioned your guys are in a new home so I'm sure they're sleeping that way so it's easy to see what's going on more quickly. My boy sleeps in so many different positions. He might be on his side, on his back, in his bed or like yours just sitting up slowly falling asleep. I wouldn't worry about it too much."
chinchilla,33m19j,samsablowski,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:17:43 2015 UTC,"I have two females. Each sleeps differently. The older one who has lived alone most of her life, and came from a pet store originally (I think?), has slept upright most of the time. She would never lay down unless she was very warm.   My other younger one, who was used as a breeder for most of her life and kept in 2'x3' breeder cages until I got her, sleeps on her side when she's alone. When they're cuddled up together, they both sleep upright."
chinchilla,33m19j,AcquaPiovana,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:35:07 2015 UTC,I have five and they all sleep different. One of my boys sleeps on his side but that's only because he has three legs. My other boy sleeps sitting on all fours. Two of my girls lay on their side only occasionally and one of my girls is a weirdo and likes to sleep on her back with her legs straight up. She does this between a wooden house and a ledge so that she can put her feet on the bottom of the ledge. I wish I could get a picture but she moves too quick.
chinchilla,33m19j,5chinnychinchins,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:03:44 2015 UTC,"One of my boys, Eeyore, commonly sleeps sitting on his hind legs in the front corner of the cage, eyes wide open. I know he's sleeping because ill go pet him and he will freak out and hide after a few seconds."
chinchilla,33m19j,djh3315,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:09:03 2015 UTC,"both sleeping positions are normal. you're right that the more upright position is a ""nap"" kind of sleep, and laying flat out on their side is a deep sleep. chinchillas spend much more time napping than fully sleeping. you're probably just not seeing their deep sleep time because of your/their schedule.  the only time i see my girls lying flat out on their sides is when they really get into sunbathing. 99.99% of the time, though, if i see them snoozing they're in an upright ball."
chinchilla,33m19j,_ataraxia,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:17:27 2015 UTC,"Mine has destroyed her hammock and uses it as a blanket but almost never sleeps on her side unless she was exercising. When she does sleep on her side I can't resist trying to tickle her toes. She never lets me get close to them, because she hops up as soon as she sees I'm coming to pet her. Gotta get those chin scritches."
chinchilla,33m19j,DeathHaze420,2,Thu Apr 23 21:08:11 2015 UTC,"Like everyone said, it's very common for chins to sleep sitting up with eyes open.  Fun fact: Chins have vertical slit pupils (like cats) but they can close their pupil all the way, completely shutting out light.  In this way they can sleep and still look awake to ward off predators.  :)"

chinchilla,33jjxf,juuuules92,2,Thu Apr 23 01:00:53 2015 UTC,"looks like you got a fur muncher, totally feel free to call me out if I'm wrong but if your chin is munching fur there are a few things you can do to help. First, remove sugar from their diet! Second, well honestly I'm not 100% certain what all else it could be, I'm sure someone else could chime in with some insight but honestly I stopped giving raisins to Thor and he stopped munching his fur. I think it might've been boredom + sugar energy but purely speculating"
chinchilla,33jjxf,sdyawg,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:55:10 2015 UTC,"yeah Sven is a fur muncher. I adopted him about a week ago from a woman who had them both for 2 years and she said he was ""moulting""and he moults every few months. She gave us absolutely no toys so I am sure he was bored out of his mind bless him! Ive spoilt them both rotten with new toys, chewing blocks and brand new dust baths and he seems to be improving! will definately ration his raisin intake too as i didnt know sugar could be a trigger, so thanks! :) youj can see his fur progress so far here: http://www.reddit.com/r/chinchilla/comments/33f4wx/remember_my_fur_biter_sven_check_out_how_much/"
chinchilla,33jjxf,sdyawg,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:34:16 2015 UTC,Aww he definitely is improving! Boredom is a big contributor to fur munching so it sounds like you're on the right path!
chinchilla,33jp1g,whatsername121,0,Thu Apr 23 01:45:37 2015 UTC,"Fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds are all bad for them. They can die from bloat or diarrhea. They can get fatty liver disease. They shouldn't eat any of it. Safe treats are rosehips, dried rose petals, and a plain cheerio once or twice a week. They don't need treats. They do fine on hay and pellets."
chinchilla,33jp1g,CrazyForChinchillas,2,Sun May 3 16:55:06 2015 UTC,"No, it's just if you let them pig out on them. It's like getting sick off eating too much candy."

chinchilla,33klsn,Jrkevan,1 point,Thu Apr 23 07:36:52 2015 UTC,Some people have it harder than others to introduce chinchillas but I think everyone on here will agree that chinchillas should have a friend. I introduced mine by putting them in a space they had never been in before and feeding them treats and letting them dust bathe together and it was instant best friends. Then after a few hours I put them in the cage together and watched them for awile. When I noticed they were snuggling I figured they were good. :) wish you luck
chinchilla,33klsn,5chinnychinchins,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:00:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have nice big empty room for them run around in and they get along fine when not in cages, so I will be patient and keep trying, like I said I just got them last night so I'm still getting to know them myself."
chinchilla,33klsn,5chinnychinchins,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:26:04 2015 UTC,Try a small area like a bathroom that they have never been in.  That's exactly what I did
chinchilla,33k8n0,5chinnychinchins,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:46:22 2015 UTC,It's possible she was having a miscarriage?
chinchilla,33k8n0,bella26piano,3,Thu Apr 23 08:18:45 2015 UTC,She's pretty far along and nothing came out. She is still super fat.
chinchilla,33k8n0,bella26piano,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:07:27 2015 UTC,"Well.... How is she doing now? If back to her normal self then I wouldn't worry too much, she may have just gotten frightened at something. Either way I hope she and the baby/ies are okay! :)"
chinchilla,33k8n0,killachains82,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:26:21 2015 UTC,Yes she is fine now.  Still grumpy with me but she is all perky again.  And beyond along with the others.  I hope her and the babies are fine too. I miss the little fluffy cute things

chinchilla,33fz8k,XoMxcted,2,Wed Apr 22 05:15:38 2015 UTC,"I would go on a site such as Petfinder and search for rescues that deal with chinchillas. Even if you don't see a chinchilla currently in the rescue, I would inquire about it since they may just not have any in at the moment, but be experienced with them, or they may be able to steer you in the right direction. With enough luck, you should be able to find a good rescue that might have room for your chins, preferably with foster homes.   In the meantime, I would post on craigslist to see if anyone is interested, but you would have to weed out some of the...less appealing adopters.  Is it a definite no to bringing them with though? There are some planes that will fly chins, if you wanted to go that route."
chinchilla,33fz8k,Lagomorphilic,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:19:46 2015 UTC,We only have two cars and my mother's doesn't have working air (issue with it running even when the power is off) and my car will be filled with items and another passenger (grand am).
chinchilla,33fz8k,Lagomorphilic,1 point,Wed Apr 22 08:00:46 2015 UTC,"Is two trips with your car not an option? I know it's a long drive, but if it means you get to keep your little guys, especially if you end up not being able to find homes for them, it may be worth it. It also might give you a chance to split the loads up a bit more, so you guys won't be so crowded with stuff."

chinchilla,33fz8k,5chinnychinchins,2,Thu Apr 23 05:39:30 2015 UTC,"Heh, as luck would have it, I live close to there, and the rescue I foster for has quite a few fosters in that area (our rescue is strictly foster homes and has no central location). Want me to ask if we have any fosters that can take them? I'm sure someone has room. If no one out in Aurora can, I might be able to take them as fosters myself, though we would have to work out transportation.  edit: fingers type faster then mind thinks"

chinchilla,332om7,juuuules92,3,Sat Apr 18 23:09:18 2015 UTC,"First of all, congrats on your new adoptees! I hope they settle in nicely--sounds like you've got a nice set up for them.  Your intuition is correct; this is not 'moulting'. As far as I know, chinchillas do not ever moult. This looks like a pretty bad case of fur chewing.  There can be lots of reasons for this, including stress, boredom, or genetic predisposition. Here's an article that I found from a quick search that goes over the most common causes and how to hopefully stop the fur pulling: http://www.chinchillas2home.co.uk/furbite.htm  From what I understand, some chinchillas pick up this habit and never quite stop. If you've tried everything and your chins seem happy and otherwise healthy, then that may be all that you can do. But if the old owner seemed to think that this was new/out of the ordinary then hopefully there's an easy cure.  Disclaimer in that all of this information is from research knowledge and not first-hand experience, so maybe someone else has more helpful advice. Best of luck with your new chins!"
chinchilla,332om7,animal_shmanimal,1 point,Sat Apr 18 23:31:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you! As a first time chin owner I wanted to be sure of what was happening to Sven. The fur is much shorter at the back obviously, but he has no bald spots so as far the internet tells me there isn't a health concern.  My next step is to try a different dust than the one the previous owner provided me with, as it is more like sand than dust so maybe that could cause irritation?"
chinchilla,332om7,Kiangel,1 point,Sat Apr 18 23:58:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think the dust is the problem. If the dust was causing an irritation it would be at the skin, causing the fur to fall out completely, not break in half. It definitely looks like there is chewing. Make sure to give them lots of chew toys and lots of play time, fur chewing is often a result of boredom. I just rescued a chinchilla not long ago, who had chewed the fur on his tail down to the nub. It's only been about two months and his tail is 80% grown back in. A lot of time all it takes is patience and love =)"
chinchilla,332om7,nmmtns,2,Mon Apr 20 06:34:35 2015 UTC,thank you for your advice - its much better getting advice from a fellow chin owner than the internet. I've spoilt them both with a lot of new toys as the previous owner had none to give us so it most likely is boredom. But he's now letting us tickle his chin and he's playfully nibbling my fingers so hopefully i can pick him up for cuddles real soon :) (when he's ready of course!)
chinchilla,332om7,thatblondgirl,3,Tue Apr 21 00:18:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/animal_shmanimal. And I think it can't hurt to try better dust. Also maybe try better toys, a nice wheel, etc. in case it's boredom.  We had a chin, adopted at 7 and lived to 14, who always chewed his fur, both before we got him and until he died. It wasn't to the point of bald spots or irritation, just enough that he always looked a bit ragged.  We never found a solution, but it never seemed to affect his health and he lived to a ripe old age. He was a Wilson White mutation. I have heard secondhand (I am not sure how true this is) that some mutations are more prone to this behavior. Looks like your fur chewer is a standard grey though.  ETA: Just want to agree that chinchillas don't ""moult"". And by looking at the photo, you can tell that this is fur chewing because he is biting off the ends of his fur, revealing the darker fur underneath. It's not falling out as complete hairs, he is basically trimming them shorter in the spots he can reach with his teeth.  Sometimes you will see chinchillas with short, chewed-off whiskers, which is a sign that another chinchilla is chewing on them. Doesn't look like the case here, but something to keep in mind."
chinchilla,332om7,Pipiya,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:29:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment! He's got no bald spots, so thats a relief! The previous owner gave us no toys when she brought them to us so its probably boredom (his brother Olaf has a couple of patches missing too so hopefully theyll love their new toys!)"
chinchilla,332om7,filthiestcasual,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:19:51 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the new family members! One of my girls is a fur biter and although the fur pattern looks a bit different, I would say yours is fur biting as well. My girl is young (1.5 years) and does it intermittently (chews her fur down then lets it regrow). She's only done it a few times but it has always been when she was stressed out or when she was really bored. I would recommend providing them with lots of chew toys and a wheel and giving them some time to settle in for now. Unfortunately when the fur biting is more severe it can be hard to tell if it is re-growing or if they are continuing to bite because it can take a few weeks or months to grow back to normal. I would just monitor him to make sure it's not getting worse! As for avoiding it in the future... make sure you change around their cage every so often, provide them with a wheel, and try to take them out to play as much as you can (once per day is ideal). Good luck, they are very cute!"

chinchilla,32zotj,fatal_kiss,7,Sat Apr 18 02:14:00 2015 UTC,Awww poor baby :(   My chin got some dust in his eye last summer and had to be taken to get some eye drops. My only advice is to try to keep to the eye drops as directed until you get to the vet. Medicine doesn't work unless you keep with it. And also make sure he's not scratching at his eye with his foot. Mine does that right when his eye starts acting up.   Other than that I hope the vet visit goes smoothly and he gets better soon!
chinchilla,32zotj,samsablowski,2,Sat Apr 18 02:41:52 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your reply! I hope it's something minor and that I can get it resolved before she starts hurting.
chinchilla,32zotj,Meikami,3,Sat Apr 18 02:51:19 2015 UTC,"Don't have any advice, just want to thank you for being a responsible chin owner and taking her to a vet when needed. Hope she feels better soon!"
chinchilla,32zotj,nmmtns,3,Sat Apr 18 04:24:48 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear you have her seeing a vet! I think in the meantime, just keep going with the eye drops as instructed. Good luck, and I hope she recovers quickly.  Eye infections can sometimes be an indication of malocclusion, so ask your vet to check her teeth. Especially with a poorly bred or poorly cared for animal, this can be an issue.  Please consider filing a complaint with PetSmart. A licensed store should not be selling animals in this sort of condition. Even if you don't care about getting a refund, bringing this to the attention of higher-ups might force them to improve their care for other animals.  Also, there were some recent posts by /u/badwolf7850 who had issues buying chinchillas at PetSmart. Might be helpful to see the advice they got. http://www.reddit.com/r/chinchilla/comments/2tlzje/found_my_new_chin_dead/  http://www.reddit.com/r/chinchilla/comments/2ubmf7/update_found_my_chin_dead/"
chinchilla,32zotj,dripless_cactus,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:10:49 2015 UTC,Thank you! I've contacted the PetSmart & they weren't very cooperative at first and asked that I return her. I've contacted the corporate office above general management & now they're reimbursing my vet bills.   I think as of 14 days after the purchase (which begins tomorrow) they will no longer reimburse any vet/medicine costs.
chinchilla,32xi2x,teamcactus,5,Fri Apr 17 15:10:49 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, every chin is different. I got my little guy about 6 months ago and he can still be skittish sometimes.  One of the biggest things to remember is you have to let them do their thing, they can't be forced to get comfortable. Just make sure wherever playtime is, it's safe and has places for them to hide.  Patience is the key here.  Good luck with your little buddy!"
chinchilla,32xi2x,jennacrack,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:55:38 2015 UTC,"My first chin took about 6 months to get fully comfortable with us.  We got a pair a few years later and those guys took maybe a month, tops, to bond with us.   They're all different. Just gotta be patient and give him/her (which is it?) plenty of time to adjust. Be patient, and definitely read up on acclimation and bonding tips and tricks if you haven't already."

chinchilla,32xi2x,Biohack,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:11:47 2015 UTC,"I think it varies a lot. I heard a lot about how skittish chins were before I got one and none of this was true for mine. He thinks he's king of the jungle and he wasn't afraid of anything. I heard that you should give them about a week to before taking them out  or interacting with them much, but mine was fine from the moment I brought him home."

chinchilla,32xi2x,dirtypixie7,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:22:06 2015 UTC,I was thinking of getting him some treats to help break the barrier. I've been visiting his cage frequently but I want to let him settle into his new environment as well.

chinchilla,32xi2x,juuuules92,1 point,Sat Apr 18 02:31:23 2015 UTC,A lot of it depends on how much time you spend with them and how much interaction you provide for them during that time.  It helps a lot if you frequently visit their cage and just hang out with them in their environment.

Also my Pedro was eating and drinking fine too while having these weird episodes, the vet gave me an anti-inflammatory medicine and he went back to normal after two days. I hope it helps! :)"
chinchilla,32pfjg,zabo23,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:07:58 2015 UTC,I just posted an update on my original post.. My vet also has no idea but are treating as a upper respiratory infection. I did find a video on YouTube of a chinchilla doing the same gagging/choking thing and showed the vet since I didn't think of recording one myself before hand. They just basically said if the medication doesn't work she will need to go back and they'll sedate her to take a closer look. I'm glad your little guy responded to the medicine he was given and is now fine!
chinchilla,32pfjg,zabo23,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:14:53 2015 UTC,"I hope the medicine works for your little lady as well! Check her though, some chinchillas lose appetite when they're on medicine.

The vet mentioned they also recently saw a bunny with a similar thing going on but haven't gotten any updates since that visit. I've also had the thought that maybe they're do it because they want attention and we're going crazy thinking their sick?"
chinchilla,32pfjg,zabo23,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:49:07 2015 UTC,"my vet said it could be due to allergies, right now here we had some major weather changes in the past month, and well it's spring allergies too.  I thought it could be because of the wood shavings I've put in their cages....usually they are pretty much dust-less but this bag I got didn't go through their dust-removing machines, because it's filled with it. I also thought it could have been from dust, chinchillas usually close their nostrils (or something) so they don't inhale it, but he was in a little fight with my other chinchilla and they were both really dusty (both had been in the dustbath).  I know my oldest chinchilla screams for attention because he's linked the screams to me coming and talking/petting him, so it could be a possibility XD"

chinchilla,32nrmc,Skrilmaufive,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:32:40 2015 UTC,"Some chins are simply messy eaters; that said, it could also possibly be a symptom of tooth-related issues. One of our boys started doing this when he started having dental problems, and the behavior subsided after the vet filed down his molars a bit (he had spurs that were causing him pain when he chewed). So it could go either way, but it might be worth a vet visit if they start showing other symptoms. Watch for damp fur around the eyes, refusal to eat hay, or weight loss. Tooth issues are manageable if caught early on, but can cause the little guys a lot of pain if not treated promptly & eventually lead to them going off their food. Hopefully yours is just a messy eater!"

chinchilla,32g6ff,DeathHaze420,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:15:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds normal. It will take some time to adjust, and even when he does, he'll likely only be active during the first part of the evening. Expect him to sleep and/or just sit there almost all day. Keep at the engagement, though; the more you make him comfortable with you, the more he'll pep up when you come by and be willing to play."
chinchilla,32g6ff,Meikami,3,Mon Apr 13 17:03:24 2015 UTC,"chinchillas don't consistently stay awake from timeA to timeB and sleep from timeC to timeD. there are times when they are more likely to be awake/active for longer stretches, like at night and very early in the morning, but it's normal for them to drift back and forth between activity and naps. they're very ""bursty"" animals; they do pretty much everything in short bursts, whether it's eating or chewing or running/playing or snuggling.  as long as he's eating, drinking, and does not seem lethargic or wobbly when he's awake, everything's cool."
chinchilla,32g6ff,_ataraxia,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:10:04 2015 UTC,"Aren't they diurnal? Awake morning and evening, asleep night and afternoon?  My bad! It's actually called Crepuscular"
chinchilla,32g6ff,DeathHaze420,3,Tue Apr 14 11:31:04 2015 UTC,"the thing about crepuscular animals is that they're generally labeled as being crepuscular as a default because they don't follow a predictable nocturnal or diurnal schedule. both of my chinchillas are most active between about 11pm and 3am, but they're also active mid-morning, mid-afternoon, early evening, etc. deer are the same way; you might see them out and about at 6am, or 1pm, or 9pm, or 1am..."
chinchilla,32g6ff,_ataraxia,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:06:25 2015 UTC,"LOL at screen saver mode!  FYI, chins can sleep with their eyes open, so he might be sleeping then! :D"
chinchilla,32dwag,cleeweavz,2,Mon Apr 13 00:02:34 2015 UTC,"I'm planning on moving a couple provinces away this summer. Does anyone have experience in long distance moves with their chins? I can go by train (25 hours with visits to pets to feed etc) or plane (3-5 hours in the cargo hold). Either way I feel like all the transporting and jostling around will scare the hell out of them. Plus trying to keep them in half of their cage rather than a carrier and trying to get that from place to place. I don't want to sell them or leave them behind with my family as I don't know if I'll be moving back here after my course, but if that's better for them then I will do that."
chinchilla,32dwag,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,2,Mon Apr 13 02:25:37 2015 UTC,"I do. I took Modjeska from Indiana to California in a three day roadtrip in a carrier. As it was, Modjeksa really rolled with it. After stopping for the day we would let her out in the bathroom and she would run and explore. She slept most of the day's trip in the car, always had water food and hay, and did really well in the small space. I will say that now with three of them, one of which has a very delicate temperament (very nervous) I would not do that again.   If you have the option to go by plane I would do that. 5 hours in a carrier is better than 25 hours, even with visits and pets. Trains are also noisy and I doubt the conductors would appreciate chinchillas on the loose. If possible keep them in one carrier so they have each other for emotional support."
chinchilla,32dwag,DeathHaze420,2,Mon Apr 13 07:47:39 2015 UTC,"On the topic of moving provinces, my brother surrendered his chinchilla to my girlfriend and I about 4 years ago as he was moving to BC (mountains) from Saskatchewan (flat and low) and was told the elevation change could kill the chinchilla. We were all new to chins and didn't know wether to believe it or not so we figured better safe than sorry.  Did he surrender his chinchilla to us needlessly? (We effword love her so much he will never get her back [not in a mean way, she's just too cute and he has children now])"
chinchilla,32dwag,Skrilmaufive,2,Mon Apr 13 11:38:18 2015 UTC,Chinchillas live in the Andes mountains naturally so I don't think a change like that would make any difference

I honestly think we're just lucky with these two! Plus they're both young and haven't spent too much time as single chins so they didn't hate the idea of a neighbor.  My Avie who passed a month ago couldn't tolerate any other chin in the vicinity.

chinchilla,32aup0,Lagomorphilic,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:38:11 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping you are overthinking it, but if she isn't acting like herself, it wouldn't hurt to bring her into the vet for peace of mind, especially because level of activity definitely can say something about how a chinchilla is feeling being the hyper creatures they usually are, and chins can go downhill fast. Keep a close eye on her."

chinchilla,320z9e,headintheclouds33,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:28:36 2015 UTC,Me and my fiancé have been wanting a chinchilla for awhile so we bought the cage about a month ago and finally was able to get this small female today who we called Atla 😊
chinchilla,320z9e,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:32:33 2015 UTC,"Yay! Protips:    Remove the ramps, she doesn't need them and they can cause injuries.  Her fur looks in need of dusting, but since you just got her I'm sure it will look better in no time. Consider some Bass Pans. Some people have issues with chinnies chewing the plastic ones."
chinchilla,320z9e,Kjerikaye,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:30:06 2015 UTC,Okay thanks! We just gave her a dust bath so hopefully her fur will look better soon. Yeah we will be getting new pans soon!
chinchilla,320z9e,Kjerikaye,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:38:51 2015 UTC,"The bass pans are nice too because they help keep bedding and hay and food and poop in the cage, rather than all over the floor around the cage (though some of it will still end up there.)  You can get them at the bass website (I think.) The lower one costs like $25. I just use fleece liners for my upper level.   Once she gets comfortable, she probably won't bother using those ramps, especially where you have that neat lava ledge for her to jump up on. And like others have said, legs can get trapped between the bars, though I think those fleece thingies would make them safer.   Did you put that cage together yourselves? I got one in January and boy it was a bear to put together!  :o  Enjoy your new baby! :)"
chinchilla,320z9e,tdashroy,2,Fri Apr 10 16:45:13 2015 UTC,Yes we did but it together! It was quite a challenge as we finally had to get a rubber mallet to put it all together! Yeah we went ahead and took out the ramps and she is quite the jumper and it will help too with tiring her out I hope as we will be getting the wheel next week. She is a lot of energy though still kind of shy out she let me pet her chin a bit today so hopefully she is getting warmed up to us. 😊😊
chinchilla,320z9e,Nezhka,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:36:42 2015 UTC,What kind of wheel are you getting? She will love it. My boys run in their wheels all the time. Hugo likes to sit in his wheel and survey his dominion. Remy likes to squish himself between the wheel and the wall of the cage when he is begging for treats.
chinchilla,320z9e,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:24:06 2015 UTC,"Haven't heard of ramps causing injuries before, could you elaborate a bit? Is this just these particular ramps or all ramps? Does the position of the ramp matter, like whether it is against the side of the cage or not? How do they cause injuries?"

chinchilla,322a6q,Jrkevan,1 point,Sun Apr 12 08:05:08 2015 UTC,"Possible to get a discount? I want to try your product but I must be honest I'm some what skeptical, a few reviews on Amazon said they were very loud, also heavy for the little ones to use, and they were too narrow and the chins fell off easily. Not at all trying to be rude just cautious as these seem rather expensive (50 bucks on Amazon) and I need two, so again money is a little tight for me and 100 bucks for wheels seems like a lot. However I do know these were made with chinchillas in mind, and I would like to try them so any discount would be great."

chinchilla,31u6nn,5chinnychinchins,7,Wed Apr 8 04:32:56 2015 UTC,what kind of bowl are you using? my girls have really heavy ceramic bowls that they can't knock over no matter how hard they may try. you might also try those bowls that attach to the cage bars.
chinchilla,31u6nn,_ataraxia,2,Wed Apr 8 04:38:33 2015 UTC,My chinchillas used to do that when they wanted attention. They stopped after a year! Hopefully yours stops sooner or you find a solution!

chinchilla,31s3x7,sporks_,3,Wed Apr 8 07:33:56 2015 UTC,I think all chinchillas are sassy. Two of my girls are super sassy. It always makes me laugh
chinchilla,31s4p0,fjord815,5,Tue Apr 7 19:06:46 2015 UTC,"Yes. Chinchilla mid-life crisis. I kid you not my girl started doing the same thing and she's around 8. She loves pulling up the fleece and burrowing under it. I've tried locking everything down, I've tried giving her loose fleece to burrow, none of it is as good as the 'real thing'. I had a large bird nesting box I filled with softsorb which occupied her for a little bit, but that was shortlived. Good luck."
chinchilla,31qomi,cmdaniels,2,Tue Apr 7 12:28:28 2015 UTC,"I had a lizard that had cancer. The hardest decision I made is to put her down and end her misery. I still regret that decision even knowing it was the best thing for her. But I'm very very selfish, so that's all on me."
chinchilla,31qomi,DeathHaze420,3,Tue Apr 7 16:15:47 2015 UTC,"I've never put a pet down. Something has normally happened suddenly to an otherwise healthy animal. I lost a chinchilla (PSA: avoid pet store chins) in January and to be honest I'm still upset over it. She was just a baby and we had just bonded. But that said, not every animal lives to their life expectancy. You could talk to your parents about it, but believe me I understand why you wouldn't want to. It's a lot of money.   Spend some time with him and think about what you want to do. As you've said, you have no guarantee he'll be healthy. Cancer is expensive but it's also extremely painful in any creature. I can't imagine a chin having cancer in the stomach. I'm terribly sorry about what you've already gone through and I wish I could be of more help."
chinchilla,31qomi,badwolf7850,2,Tue Apr 7 14:10:29 2015 UTC,"Number 1, don't feel guilty, you've done quite a lot so far.   I'm a college student too, and I can say that I probably couldn't afford a two thousand dollar surgery that may or may not even take care of the problem.   What I would do, is surrender him to a chinchilla rescue. It's tough, because he'd be no longer yours, but he'd definitely have a better chance of surviving and living longer. Not definitely, but possibly. It's always worth a phone call.  I know NOLA chin rescue in New Orleans is somewhere I've surrendered a chinchilla before (not mine) because he was in severe condition and I couldn't afford vet money for a chinchilla that wasn't even mine. They're very kind and might be able to make something happen, but may not also. You can always call and ask, or join the group on Facebook and message them.   Giving up your baby might not be something you wanted to hear but at this point if it's between living somewhere else and dying, it might be best :)  Good luck!"
chinchilla,31qomi,susubgugu,3,Tue Apr 7 14:33:00 2015 UTC,"I had a hamster that ended up having an infection in his skin and an abscess in his mouth. I took him to the vet for treatment everyday for 3 weeks so they could treat him and gave him treatments at home myself to. Every vet visit costed more and I probably spent 20 times the amount of the hamster. But they said he had a chance and I was taking it. the day the told me he was all better he passed away and I was heartbroken. Not because I spent so much money but because he died so young. I never regretted paying for any of it because while he was healing, he was the most playful he had ever been. One of my chins has had 5 surgeries for hernias each costing $200. The vet said I could fix the hernias or he would one day have an emergency and die. I took the chance and today he is all better and should live a long time. I also have a chinchilla who had his leg amputated recently (you have probably seen the cone pictures). A lot of vets told me to put him down over a broken leg but I spent the money to have it amputated and now it isn't healing right so I have to be home every night to take care of him but I know with some time and tlc he will get better.  So long story ending it's up to you. You can risk the time and the money and just hope your baby gets better and it could turn out great. Or you will spend the money trying and your chin might not make it. Either way it will be hard. Just think of which one you could live easier with putting it down so it doesn't suffer or risk trying and losing money and it not make it. I wish you many blessing with your chin and I will be praying for its recovery."
chinchilla,31qomi,5chinnychinchins,3,Tue Apr 7 14:40:41 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you and Noodles are in this situation. *hugs to you all*  It's a hard and terrible decision to have to make and I'm sorry that we can't really make it any easier for you. Even with the costs aside, whether to operate or not is a big decision because of the risks.   When he was 7 or 8 my little boy had a tumour in his back passage, the prices here don't seem to be as steep as the US and we had the money in savings so it was less of a consideration but the vet at the time did query several times whether we wanted to do anything at all because of the cost (he implied people don't generally bother for small animals). We went ahead with it and despite post-op complications (his bowels weren't clearing on their own for a while) we got another wonderful 13 months with him because of the operation. Unfortunately the tumour later returned and we lost him following another operation (the tumour went deeper into the tissue than expected so the surgery was more radical). Even though we only got just over a year more with him, I didn't regret trying everything we could for him.  I don't know where you are located but you may have a few options for help with the costs. You can ask your vet about payment plans to spread it out, or there are some links here and here for funds which may help with emergency vet treatment.   Good luck to you and Noodles, it's clear you love him and he will know that. Whatever else we can or can't do for our companions, giving them that is the most important thing."
chinchilla,31qomi,Pipiya,3,Tue Apr 7 21:44:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for you suggestions.  You'll see in the update that it became obvious he didn't seem 'up for it' in terms of an invasive and difficult surgery.  He was just so so tired.  After going in the vet did say she felt it was most likely cancerous so I just don't think he would have had the will to survive multiple surgeries in his state.  I'm glad you got extra time with your baby.  Especially since I only had a little over a year and a half with him (I got him when he was 11 weeks old), I would have really loved that chance."

Regardless, I would take him to the vet to get checked out. If vet price is a worry, see if you can go somewhere you haven't been and some places will offer new client discounts, and /usually/ a check up won't be more than like $50. Even that seems like a lot to me. If they think there might be a possibility of URI, the meds wouldn't be over $20 probably. Plus, the discount (maybe)    It'd be worth it imo :)"

chinchilla,31kls7,julieacts,1 point,Mon Apr 6 00:02:38 2015 UTC,Anyone have experience weaning chinchillas off of Critical Care?
chinchilla,31kls7,eggald,2,Mon Apr 6 06:53:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have some experience in the matter, though I am not a veterinarian.  You will need an intermediate food (snack) that you know they will eat. Raisins are great, obviously. Prior to feeding the critical care, feed them a raisin. After they are finished, let them enjoy the critical care in slightly decreasing amounts each time you feed.   At the same time, you want to begin re-introducing pellets back into their diet in slightly increasing amounts. I accomplished this by grinding up regular chinchilla feed pellets (Oxbow) and adding a small amount of water AND a small but noticeable amount of critical care. I left this for them in the cage after feeding the critical care. They might not eat it much at first, but as they get less critical care their hunger will drive them to eat it.   You want to use less and less critical care in the pellet mixture each time. You will also want to move back to non-crushed pellets after you are no longer using the critical care.   I found the raisins helped because their brains started associating raisins with their meals, rather than the critical care. As long as they were getting a raisin, they were happy. It was then easy to remove raisins from meals once they were weaned (only giving it to them every other meal, eventually to the point of not using them).  This worked for me with two chins who were rather stubborn.   However, I am beginning to wonder if critical care can be used as a primary source of food for a chin who has a serious jaw problem (can't chew without pain). I have been feeding him critical care three times daily on a plate for about 8 months now and he is healthier than he was prior (he was close to death due to not being able to eat). I knew that pellets were important because they help ""file"" down their teeth. So to compensate, I have been adding clean bath dust to the mix every other feeding (just enough to feel a little ""gritty""). Again, this has been working for awhile but I really have no other choice. He has been to the vet several times and it's unclear what the problem is, so I had to come up with something or lose him. Maybe someone has some experience with that?"
chinchilla,31kls7,julieacts,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:41:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Mine seemingly had teeth problems so he stopped eating and got GI Stasis and dangerously underweight. We haven't fixed his teeth yet since the vet needed him back to a normal weight. Our next appt is next week so hopefully teeth can get fixed. I have a feeling he is a bit of a sassy princess and has gotten addicted to the critical care because he chews other stuff (twigs, pumice, etc) but won't touch his pellets or hay."
chinchilla,31f24y,purpleandpenguins,1 point,Sat Apr 4 13:39:36 2015 UTC,"Fruits and veggies are not good for them. Seeds and nuts are not good for them either. They can die of bloat or fatty liver disease. Safe treats are rose hips, dried rose petals, plain cheerio or plain small shredded wheat. Sparingly. And old fashioned oats (not the instant kind). Cute chins. There is a lot of out dated info on chins out there."

chinchilla,31g24q,Dalisca,3,Mon Apr 6 03:28:12 2015 UTC,"that's what I thought at first, that's why I went to see the vet as I can't see in such a tiny mouth...The vet checked and didn't see anything, no sign of irritation either. So she said it could just be because of the weather changes we've had recently, or maybe inhaling/swallowing dust by mistake that got his throat sore a bit.  She still prescribed medication for him, and yesterday and today, I haven't heard him cough/sneeze or whatever he was doing! I still don't know exactly what it was, but it seems to be gone and he's doing a lot better, I sure am glad :)"

chinchilla,31dnym,guppymill,4,Sat Apr 4 02:05:18 2015 UTC,"Chins chew everything. But if you give them easy alternatives to chew, they may chew less on the sides of wooden cages.  Note: If you want to build your own, make sure its with wood that is not toxic to chinchillas. There are a lot of woods that are. Poplar is good and so is white pine but only if it is kiln dried."
chinchilla,31dnym,Foxinsox719,4,Sat Apr 4 06:59:31 2015 UTC,"Generally the wood provides a frame for the wire. In our cages that means the wood frame is only accessible in a very few non critical places as the surfaces facing the chins are flat and smooth and mostly have wire on them. You're also using quite thick pieces of wood so you would see long before they managed to chew through any piece (if they could even manage the angles required). We've never had a chin even get close to getting through. Wooden shelves will usually be much more accessible and appealing for them to chew on.  I have one cage I'm having to keep an eye on because it's been rebuilt for a chin with chronic bumblefoot who is also clumsy (she rolls off shelves even when awake!) and has seizures. Because of this the shelves are large and fleece covered and need extra support joists, some of which are big pieces of wood she has access to. She has plenty of chews and toys but does prefer this one support so we just keep an eye on it and it'll be replaced as soon as she does anything more than superficial damage to it."
chinchilla,31dnym,Pipiya,2,Sat Apr 4 11:28:10 2015 UTC,Chronic bumblefoot? What is this?   My girl asking falls off stuff but only when she falls asleep and forgets she is at the edge and fumps over.
chinchilla,31dnym,DeathHaze420,3,Sat Apr 4 13:35:16 2015 UTC,"Bumblefoot is the 'friendly' name for ulcerative pododermatitis. It's where a chin, or other animal, gets ulcers in or under the pad of the foot. It can be caused by things like sitting on wire too much, cuts or injuries that get infected, a chin being over weight or inactive. In some it can be a one off if their immune system is strong and it's caught and treat early but in some it can be chronic. It's exacerbated in chins by the fact they're nearly always on their feet and jumping around so the healing granulated tissue constantly gets disrupted or destroyed.   The falling off the edge when sleeping just seems to be something some chins, especially older ones, do!"
chinchilla,31dcad,guppymill,1 point,Sat Apr 4 00:13:26 2015 UTC,"they'll try to chew on it, and potentially damage their teeth doing so. if you securely covered it with fleece, it'd be fine."

chinchilla,315bm9,PandaPornz,1 point,Thu Apr 2 02:44:54 2015 UTC,Take it to the vet asap. Like the first person said it's probably stressed. It is really young. Seperated from its parents early
chinchilla,315bm9,5chinnychinchins,2,Thu Apr 2 04:29:22 2015 UTC,"Taking it to a vet would only stress it out more. Calling a vet would be better, and having critical care on hand might help. My guy took about 3 days before he was eating and drinking, he wasn't because he was scared. I bought critical care and had it delivered same day, but by that time I started seeing poops again.   Also 6 weeks seems young, most aren't separated from their parents until 8 weeks, did you get the chinchilla from an established breeder op?"
chinchilla,315bm9,Kiangel,5,Thu Apr 2 15:17:40 2015 UTC,"We already saw a vet before I saw this (which at least gave us peace of mind). The vet basically said the same thing as everyone who commented and gave us critical care. He seems happier overall so I hope this helps. As for the breeder- he was going out of breeding and told me he had properly weaned him from his parents. I read somewhere that as long as they are properly weaned, they are okay at age 6 weeks so I trusted him. Most likely he probably lied (as we can now tell) so we are just trying to feed him critical care to get him eating again and make him as least stressed as he could be. After half a day of doing that he is actually eating a couple of pellets."
chinchilla,315bm9,dripless_cactus,2,Fri Apr 3 02:33:41 2015 UTC,"It really sucks to syringe feed a chin... they hate being handled and are often so wriggly.  But in good news, it will deepen your bond and get the chin to trust you faster."
chinchilla,315bm9,_ataraxia,2,Fri Apr 3 18:06:51 2015 UTC,your chin is stressed and could be going into shock from low blood sugar. i strongly suggest getting to the vet ASAP. a shot of dexemethesone is usually recommended to boost the chinchilla's metabolism and get them eating again. a drop of corn syrup can also help to get their blood sugar back up quickly.

chinchilla,30y2te,5chinnychinchins,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:30:49 2015 UTC,"Yes they are all safe plants for chins to eat. ( when TJ's chinchillas store is open, they offer some of the same herbs but a much larger variety.)"
chinchilla,30y2te,5chinnychinchins,1 point,Tue Mar 31 23:02:50 2015 UTC,Well I would be very interested. But I wouldn't be able to pay shipping until this weekend.  And I would only trust paypal for paying

chinchilla,30rkpn,beatitudine,5,Mon Mar 30 03:58:59 2015 UTC,I live very near Waukesha. Breaks my heart. Anyone know of how I can rescue one of these babies?
chinchilla,30rkpn,MyHorseIsAmazinger,4,Mon Mar 30 04:26:20 2015 UTC,Op posted they're at HAWS. I'm in Green Bay and if I didn't already have a zoo is take a couple of chins
chinchilla,30rkpn,beatitudine,2,Mon Mar 30 17:03:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm keeping a super close eye on the story. I'm a college student so if a new chinchilla doesn't get along with the one I already have, then I need to buy another cage... and I don't have the money for another cage.   I've been looking for a sign to get another chin, and here it is, in my face. I wish I had all of the money in the world. :("
chinchilla,30rkpn,nadahoe,3,Tue Mar 31 02:54:31 2015 UTC,Poor babies. I'm happy they're out of that terrible situation.

chinchilla,30rkpn,blackdog917,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:30:37 2015 UTC,"Must be ""Honey Bear"" chinchillas. Such a weird situation. I can't imagine that many animals inside a home, versus a garage or barn."
chinchilla,30rkpn,ShyLilah,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:38:54 2015 UTC,"Wow if it is them, something must have gone wrong like their health or financial situation. Looks like they had some really expensive nice animals. 300 animals isn't hard ( but would be a full time, labor intensive job) to care for with the right equipment and can be kept in a full sized basement. Yes it would smell but shouldn't stink, kinda like when you visit the monkey section of the zoo you expect to smell monkey but you wouldn't want to live in that smell, same thing. Its not hording to be a breeder, the animal rights reporters never get that straight. this just looks like a case of them getting over their heads and not asking for help and now everyone suffers, the former owners, the animals, the local breeders with a flooded market, pet shops, the rescue homes, even those who adopt one ( odds are these are almost wild chinchillas).well, good luck chinchillas on your new adventures."
chinchilla,30rkpn,blackdog917,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:58:34 2015 UTC,"It is, Tricia and Garrett Rees, of Honey Bear Chinchillas. Tricia claimed to be a breeder - But breeders sale their kits to pet homes, and other breeders or save them to show/breed. Tricia never sold her chins. 2 days prior to being busted, she was arranging to try to purchase 2 more chinchillas!   She's claimed many illnesses over the last 7 years to make excuses for many actions she's made, and that's all they are, excuses. There were 2 adults in that home and neither were responsible.   300+ chinchillas were living in months of filth, and so were their 3 children. They also had 2 dozen dead chins in the home, and not all of them were in the freezer.   It's a very sad situation, and she's claimed to be a breeder, rescue, and has publicly attacked others for poor husbandry. She's not a reputable breeder, She's not a 501c3 rescue, and she's not a good care giver."
chinchilla,30rkpn,Nezhka,2,Wed Apr 1 22:47:51 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree, the animals I could see in the video looked to be healthy as well. Hopefully the family and chins get the care they need."
chinchilla,30qrr0,motodriveby,2,Sun Mar 29 22:21:12 2015 UTC,"1) I own males. They have dicks and sometimes they suck on them. Which is hilarious and gross at the same time. Also with males you may have issues with hair rings. I have never had to check my boys but find a YouTube video of it to educate yourself. I've never owned females so I'm not sure what major differences are besides that.   All chins have their own personalities. I think it varies more between individuals as opposed to genders.   Also, don't get a lone chin. They're herd animals. They can get lonely.   2) yes. Your ac will be on almost constantly.   3) about being ""sneaky."" While my chinchillas rarely bark/squeak loudly, they crash around their cage at night a lot.  I have plastic pans on metal (critternation cage, I highly recommend!) there are probably easy ways to limit that noise (fleece pan liners would probably help.)  Avoid pet store chinchillas, they are often unsocialized and bred poorly. Try to rescue an older one if you can. That can bring challenges with it, but definitely worth it!!  http://imgur.com/a/aF5b1  My three brothers, Ringo, Zeke, and Bubbles and then my rescue, Seymour.   You can see the dust bath I use in the photo. I often use it to lure them back into their cage after playing. But don't leave it in there all the time! They can dry their skin out when they take bathes too often."
chinchilla,30qrr0,fingerpies,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:49:17 2015 UTC,"I'm going to agree with the previous commenter and say don't get a lone chin. If you can get two that are already bonded you will save yourself a lot of frustration. I love my girl, but from what I've gathered on this sub every chin is unique. She's very sweet but she definitely makes a lot of noise crashing around in her cage at night. I keep her upstairs(I can hear her even with my door shut) with her own AC unit to keep her comfortable. Definitely find a breeder, most would be more than happy to sell you two. I got a really sick chin from Petsmart(got her as a friend for my older chin) and she died two weeks later. I simply put her dust bath in her cage and take it out after she uses it."
chinchilla,30qrr0,badwolf7850,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:16:33 2015 UTC,"1] the room your chinchilla cage is in should be kept below 70F. if that means having to run your AC every day, then that's what you'll have to do. humidity is slightly less of an issue if you keep the dust bath available inside the cage 24/7, but you'll still want to keep the room relatively dry.  2] i don't know what you've read, but my two girls definitely didn't read the same information. they are LOUD, especially late at night. the wheel is noisy, their chewing is noisy, their general bouncing around the cage is noisy [lilac think it's fun to make her cage shake and rattle].  2.5] i don't recommend getting any pet if it's not 100% okay with your landlord. if you wanted to adopt a chinchilla from a rescue, many places wouldn't even approve your adoption application without talking to your landlord first, because they don't want the chinchilla to end up right back in the rescue when the landlord discovers you've snuck a pet into your 'no pets' rental. what will happen if your landlord decides she's really not okay with it? will you get rid of your chinchilla? will you find pet-friendly housing and move? will you try to sneak your chinchilla into another 'no pets' rental?  3] i've only ever owned female chinchillas, so i can't really say anything about males based on personal experience. i'm happy i never have to deal with hair rings, though.  4] chinchillas are crepuscular, leaning toward nocturnal. my girls sleep mostly during the day, but they don't sleep the entire day. they drift between napping and short bursts of activity. they're most active at night, between 10pm and 5am.  5] i use these dust bath houses, hung up on the wall of the cage. they have little hooks for that purpose, but they break off easily, so i use bolts and washers to secure them instead. unfortunately these houses are made of plastic, but i've yet to find a suitable non-plastic option that can be hung in the cage the same way."
chinchilla,30qrr0,_ataraxia,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:29:50 2015 UTC,Well I'm not sure if I will remember to address every question but I have two males and three females. The three females are so whiny and moody and picky but my two males actually have learned commands and go strait in their cage when I tell them. They are very quite unless I seperate them. One of my males will not tolerate being alone. He will cry for hours and then refuse to move or eat. He's stubborn. The Crack between the door and the floor the chin will definatily be able to get through if it's two inches. I live in florida and keep my ac well below 70. My dust bath is actually a litter pan that I poor dust in only because I have so many that this is the easiest way. Chins are wonderful pets and they are actually pretty clean and don't smell if you clean their cage like you should. I tend to have to take mine to the vet a lot though and they eat EVERYTHING. Hide anything you value or it will be eaten. So they are pretty costly.  I love my babies and I couldn't imagine having any other pet though. They are wonderful companions once they get used to you and they definatily have their own personality that keeps you laughing.
chinchilla,30qrr0,5chinnychinchins,5,Mon Mar 30 02:53:34 2015 UTC,Get two boys and a large cage. Get ready for twenty years of cuteness and poop.
chinchilla,30qrr0,mekoche,3,Mon Mar 30 03:20:14 2015 UTC,So much poop.
chinchilla,30qrr0,fiona_kitty,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:28:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, especially on those really hot days, you'll need to run the air conditioner They aren't very vocal, and they don't make a lot of noise during the day, but they are bouncing around and running on wheels and it makes a ton of noise at night. If there's anywhere other than your bedroom to keep them, I would do so. I have males. I heard that females can sometimes spray their urine when they are scared. Males are less capable of that. They are most active at sundown (probably 9-11) and sunup (5am-7am).  I use a glass fishbowl and just offer it to them a couple times per week. I used to do it during playtime, but I'm kind of allergic so now I put it in their cage and run away."
chinchilla,30n91q,maggerz,5,Sat Mar 28 23:03:12 2015 UTC,"So funny...definitely glaring. Mine always seems happy to run all over the place when I clean his cage, but he is only about 18 months old so that might be why."
chinchilla,30n91q,mello999,11,Sun Mar 29 01:06:37 2015 UTC,"Usually they're better about it but I decided to clean the cage when I got home from work at 5, which is the tail end of their big sleep. None of the fluffs were amused that I came busting in the door, after the last eleven hours of a quiet apartment, to wake them up, chase them out of the house, move all their stuff and make ""the big noise"" with the shop vac. My other two got over it soon enough (a shredded wheat smoothes most chinchilla problems over). Earmuff, however, is the most contemptuous of the bunch. He proceeded to remain a little statue of fury, glaring at me from that exact position for a good half hour after the cage was cleaned."
chinchilla,30n91q,Nezhka,1 point,Sun Mar 29 01:41:02 2015 UTC,Earmuff!! I love it! :D
chinchilla,30n91q,OystersAreEvil,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:39:02 2015 UTC,"Haha. I named the original pair Slipper and Earmuff, so if they misbehaved they knew the consequences :)  It turned out that my ""pair of girls"" was actually a mixed gender pair. Nature had its course and Slipper became Mama but Muff has retained his identity!"
chinchilla,30n91q,OystersAreEvil,3,Mon Mar 30 02:45:53 2015 UTC,"Do you have any non-wire mesh flooring in that cage? If your chinchilla doesn't have a solid surface to stay on, he may develop a foot/paw problem.   I'm also worried that a chinchilla could get something stuck in the mesh, but don't know how common that is."
chinchilla,30oh23,Bumrak,2,Sun Mar 29 06:41:05 2015 UTC,I've actually built a baseboard around our bed so our chins cannot get under the bed. We have a king and getting them to come out was a challenge. Cleaning up under there was worse.
chinchilla,30o3gt,AudOneOut,4,Sun Mar 29 03:48:05 2015 UTC,"I would do a quick internet search. If you can't find anything about an exotic vet call any vet you see. Most, if not all, of them have received calls about this and know where local exotic vets are. Chins go downhill quickly and you should definitely take yours to see someone."
chinchilla,30o3gt,badwolf7850,3,Sun Mar 29 04:53:05 2015 UTC,Just Google and start calling vets.  The poor little one needs to see a doctor
chinchilla,30o3gt,5chinnychinchins,3,Sun Mar 29 13:49:56 2015 UTC,"You sure it's not barking? Barking is totally normal. Sometimes they have little nightmares when they are sleeping. Yes, they do sometimes sleep on their sides too. As for the scratching try giving him his dust more or less frequently, it might just be dry skin or oily fur. One of my girls is bad at dusting behind her ears and it leaves her itchy, so I have to ""groom"" her and pick out the tufties and dead skin."

chinchilla,30lyhq,patrick1992a,6,Sat Mar 28 16:17:57 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're doing alright, but you could always add a wheel for her. There are lots of links on the sidebar about appropriate wheels. Do NOT buy those shitty plastic ones from pet stores. Even though they're advertised for chinchillas they are too small for them."
chinchilla,30lyhq,fingerpies,2,Sat Mar 28 17:59:15 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about buying some foraging toys for our chinchilla. His cagemate just died, so he's been less active lately with no one to chase around the cage. It seems like foraging for some of his hay/pellets would give him some additional mental stimulation, sort of like a Kong for a dog.  I'd be interested to hear others' opinions on this. I'm thinking of toys like this: http://www.drsfostersmith.com/bird-supplies/foraging-toys/ps/c/5059/16566?count=73  They mostly make them for birds (parrots, etc.), so you'd have to make sure the materials were chin-safe. In particular, none of the toys with plastic, no birdseed, nuts, anything like that. I was thinking I'd try to find ones where you added the food yourself, so I could just put in some of his normal hay and pellets.  Anyone else think this is a good idea?"
chinchilla,30lyhq,nmmtns,2,Sat Mar 28 23:07:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe give them smaller chew toys. Chinchillas love ""new"" things. TJ Chinchillas and many other fine chinchilla specialized merchants sell toy parts. My chins really dig loofahs (I give them small pieces at a time), chin bagels, shredders, grapevine, apple sticks, hay cubes.  Also switch up the positions of her shelves and houses and other cage features once in awhile so she gets stimulated by figuring out where everything is (I wouldn't change the position of water and food too often)  And I've heard of some people turning on the TV or playing music for their chinchilla, and they claim they respond to it. I dunno about that, but perhaps it is stimulating for them.  Other than that.... some chins' favorite pasttime is to sit and stare like little creepers, so I wouldn't feel too bad. She might not be as bored as she looks.  Edit: Also yeah, if you don't have a wheel do get one."
chinchilla,30lyhq,dripless_cactus,2,Sun Mar 29 02:01:05 2015 UTC,"There was a thread about this a few days ago here.  A couple things I don't think I mentioned that might help:  You can take them out outside of playtime - chill together at the couch, computer, etc.  if you bring a couple toys. They also like entertaining guests, so you can pull up a chair and visit for a while."

chinchilla,30e7a6,Angry_flesh_ferret,2,Thu Mar 26 19:29:28 2015 UTC,He has been picking at his nub while it's healing so he has to wear the cone. Poor fellow. On the bright side the vet said if he is out playing then he doesn't have to wear it so he hasn't been in the cage since. He is happy about that
chinchilla,30e7a6,doctorace,5,Thu Mar 26 23:41:00 2015 UTC,aw what happened?
chinchilla,30e7a6,Panic_Mechanic,3,Thu Mar 26 20:04:01 2015 UTC,He broke his leg a few weeks ago and had to have it amputated. Which is okay. I don't regret it he is doing fantastic. But the stiches finally dissolved after 3 weeks and the wound didn't close and he won't have to have more surgery if he doesn't mess with it. which means he ended up with a cone.
chinchilla,30e7a6,doctorace,2,Thu Mar 26 23:43:41 2015 UTC,I didn't think you could put cones on chinchillas because they are rodents and they seem to be able to squeeze out of anything. I thought that was why you couldn't get them neutered.
chinchilla,30e7a6,verminty,3,Fri Mar 27 01:03:50 2015 UTC,You can definatily get them fixed. My big man is fixed. Also the cone was custom made. They don't sell one for chinchillas. My vet did a lot of research and made it so it is safe for him and he can't escape

chinchilla,30fnkv,Nezhka,1 point,Fri Mar 27 00:58:32 2015 UTC,"No slime, just squish very easily which means sometimes they get stuck to her fur, or mushed onto her shelves"
chinchilla,30fnkv,Nezhka,1 point,Sat Mar 28 05:40:54 2015 UTC,"No slime is a good sign!   I occasionally find poos squished on shelves, and very rarely stuck in the fur.  What kind of water do you give her?  You might want to give RO water a try - it should be available in gallon jugs at most grocery stores.  Be sure to get the ""purified by Reverse Osmosis"" kind and not the distilled kind, because RO is better for them.  Another thought is to let her free-feed on pellets and see how she does.  I just fill up the bowl with pellets and put more in when it gets low (every few days)."

chinchilla,30fnkv,bella26piano,2,Sat Mar 28 05:41:30 2015 UTC,"It may just be her not eating the ones she's supposed to eat and digest again. If so, there's nothing to worry about :)"
chinchilla,30d98r,verminty,5,Thu Mar 26 13:00:35 2015 UTC,"Wait until you have at least $500 put aside for emergency vet fees. Also the costs of purchasing the chin, home, food, toys, etc can be quite pricey.   Chinchilla vet visits are both expensive and necessary. Actually, you'll need to take your chin to the vet soon after adoption to make sure its healthy.   There are always other fluff balls to adopt later."
chinchilla,30d98r,Skrilmaufive,1 point,Thu Mar 26 14:48:27 2015 UTC,I don't know about needing 500 dollars but defiantly get a job first and be prepared for the expenses to add up. They destroy everything and require a lot of attantion. I have five and two havr to go to the vet all the time. It's one major surgery after another. They are very fragile animals :/ but great company. Plus maybe you'll get a job sooner than you think and the little one on craigslist sill still be there :) everything works out the way it should

She said that May would work very well, rehoming is looking at about $100 (though she said she'd consider reducing it or even getting rid of it all together). As far as the vet, she gave me the name of a place to not go to (she had an issue with them and another chin she owned, the chin didn't make it), and said this one had never needed to go to the vet. I liked the advice someone gave of taking him to the vet as a precautionary check up."

chinchilla,307nq1,Valrek_Machines,6,Wed Mar 25 13:53:17 2015 UTC,"I surely hope not. This is only during play time, and I'm not sure there is much more stimulation I can give him than letting him bounce around my room to my music. He just prefers the baseboards to his toys for some reason. He uses them fine while in the cage."

I am still trying to figure out what to do for the smaller shelves... right now I have some tiles covering the parts where they starting chewing on it, but it can't cover the raised edge... I think I will sew fleece covers for the smaller shelves and see if that deters them"

I was cleaning the area around the chins where they have been for a very long time a couple days ago, I put their cage in another spot and ended up leaving it there overnight.

chinchilla,30bee9,o6o3,3,Thu Mar 26 00:12:02 2015 UTC,You should buy a happy chilla wheel. It is the right size for a chinchilla (16in) and it's pretty much indestructible plus a very good price. And it's quiet. All five of my chins love it
chinchilla,305c7h,beatitudine,2,Tue Mar 24 16:43:39 2015 UTC,"Lavarock question!  Does your girl hate particular colors of it? We've had a yellow and a blue lava rock ledge that she barely touches. But if we put a pink one up there, like yours, its gone in three days.  We think she hates pink lol"
chinchilla,305c7h,DeathHaze420,2,Tue Mar 24 18:22:03 2015 UTC,"to be honest, I wouldn't know. This is the only lava ledge she's ever had! She doesn't really care about different wood colors and stuff, so I am willing to bet she wouldn't be too picky about lava ledge colors!  She does get picky about the placement of things in her cage, though. I put a hammock in on the top floor and she did everything she could to tear it down.  Chinchillas are hilarious, mysterious creatures."
chinchilla,305c7h,DeathHaze420,3,Tue Mar 24 19:43:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes, the fabled top level. Must be clear AT ALL TIMES. My girl does that as well. I tie braided timmothy hay to the top of her cage to piss her off hahaha"
chinchilla,305c7h,DeathHaze420,2,Tue Mar 24 19:54:08 2015 UTC,Oh man this made me laugh.

chinchilla,305c7h,mag_cue,2,Tue Mar 24 20:09:21 2015 UTC,"I have seven(!) lava ledges in one of my chin's cage. He chews on them all equally, however, we had two purple ones in there that he managed to knock off the side of the cage."
chinchilla,305c7h,DeathHaze420,3,Tue Mar 24 19:54:27 2015 UTC,"Wow he really chewed into those! Mine chewed it up a little bit but never THAT much. I should get more.  Does your chin live alone? mine does, and I think more ledges to chew on would be good for her!"
chinchilla,305c7h,5chinnychinchins,2,Tue Mar 24 20:06:01 2015 UTC,"Lava ledges are his favorite toys, and he could go through one in about a week. The reason I initially put all of them in there is because he didn't have any shelves for him and I wanted him to be able to jump around a bit. :)  He shares a cage with my other chin, Teemo, but they do not get along so Teemo lives in the top part of the cage (Ferret Nation 142)."
chinchilla,305c7h,DeathHaze420,2,Tue Mar 24 20:08:01 2015 UTC,"My girl chews the pink ones in half and leaves a little knob on the wall that she strips the pink off of. I've never seen a purple one in the stores, but if i do I'm definitely checking to see what she thinks of it haha.  I've had a yellow one in her cage for 3 months. Put a pink one in a few weeks ago and its on the ground already. The yellow one has less damage than any of yours. o.o I love her quirky personality."
chinchilla,305c7h,5chinnychinchins,2,Tue Mar 24 20:07:28 2015 UTC,Mine eat every last piece of every color. I actually just learned today petsmart is discontinuing lava ledges. (NOOO!!) Can chinchillas see color?
chinchilla,305c7h,DeathHaze420,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:36:18 2015 UTC,"General consensus is no. They are rodents and they notoriously don't see in color. Also they are nocturnal, so they never had to develop the cones we use to see color.  Maybe the pink ledge stands out like a neon sign in her vision? I don't know. But I can definitely repeat this ""lava ledge experiment"" and get the same results. (We seek out the pink ones since we can guarantee she is chewing enough)"
chinchilla,305c7h,5chinnychinchins,2,Tue Mar 24 20:46:38 2015 UTC,Mine eat a whole ledge in three days max. I got through those things like crazy
chinchilla,304gdw,stealthcopter,3,Tue Mar 24 12:09:18 2015 UTC,"Sleeping on their side is usually quite safe, and in most cases means nothing bad. However, if your chin is stretching a lot and seems a bit uncomfortable (unlike yours), it could mean impaction in the GI tract or infection. But your chin looks perfectly fine to me!  Disclaimer: I am not a vet :)"
chinchilla,304gdw,killachains82,3,Tue Mar 24 12:29:20 2015 UTC,"He's a baby, about 4 months old now and he's started sleeping on his side. At first we thought he had died! Is this normal?"

chinchilla,304gdw,angiesnz,6,Tue Mar 24 20:32:58 2015 UTC,Mine does that every once in awhile as well. Mainly when he is exhausted from playing. I would make sure to feel him to make sure he isn't too warm and his surrounding isn't too warm either.
chinchilla,304gdw,angiesnz,4,Tue Mar 24 12:58:21 2015 UTC,"he's about the same temp as normal and it's def not too warm here. He has been playing a lot, just learnt to use the wheel properly :)"

He could just look older because he was being fed GERBIL.FOOD. anyway he had serious tummy problems one night a while after we got him , he was crawling trying to rub his belly on the floor . you could tell instantly it was a stomach / tract issue . your little guy however , is having a nice rest in a safe environment :)   If you see him lying like this and when you open the cage he doesn't spring to his feet , then you can start to worry"
chinchilla,304gdw,Pipiya,1 point,Tue Mar 24 13:19:29 2015 UTC,Mine sleep like this every day. I don't think it's an issue
chinchilla,304gdw,dxm765,19,Tue Mar 24 13:40:48 2015 UTC,"Yes it's fairly normal, generally a sign the chin feels safe (it's a more vulnerable position) and comfortable, or is extra tired from a big run or play. I love seeing my chins sleeping like this 'cause it means they're very relaxed and comfy and they're trusting me to be the pack member on watch duty."
chinchilla,304gdw,sdyawg,3,Tue Mar 24 13:44:31 2015 UTC,"We call that sexy pose if they turn their little heads to look at you. But yes, it's perfectly normal."
chinchilla,304gdw,Sexycornwitch,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:03:36 2015 UTC,"Both of mine sleep like this, the one likes to wrap his body around his one tube. Pretty much he cuddles with it, the other chin likes to cuddle with his one toy"
chinchilla,304gdw,Dalisca,2,Tue Mar 24 15:45:57 2015 UTC,"Totally normal, incredibly cute. I see it usually when my chinchilla is extra tired or tuckered out from play time. As long as his/her ears are normal colored and not pink/red they are fine.  If the ears are pink/red then that's a sign that your chinchilla is too hot and needs to cool off some. This position does help with that a bit, but in the event of pink/red ears:   Ensure the room temperature is below 75F (preferably 65-70F) Ensure chinnie has access to fresh water ""Chinchilla Coolers"" or granite slabs are great to have on hand. Sometimes you can get little tile samples from Home Depot/Lowe's for free or really cheap. I keep a few in my freezer for emergencies. Place the slab in front of your chinchilla, if they are completely uninterested, you can pour some bath dust on it as well to encourage them to rub up on it. Some chinchillas actually like to chew on ice cubes, this is another great emergency cooldown tactic but may require some supervision"
chinchilla,304gdw,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:12:30 2015 UTC,"My boys do that too and I asked the same question. But yeah, they are just all tuckered out and trust you to have their backs when they do that."
chinchilla,306lr2,KingVarianChin,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:09:24 2015 UTC,"does he have a wheel in his cage? if not, get one.  keeping a variety of toys is important for both for chewing and for mental stimulation. my girls always have pumice stones and a variety of wood to chew, both in the form of ledges and smaller pieces that are strung on their ka-bob toys. they also get things to shred, like toilet paper rolls, pieces of egg cartons, stick/grass balls, loofah pieces, etc."
chinchilla,306lr2,_ataraxia,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:18:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he has a really nice wheel. I usually keep a big pumice stone in there as well.   I've never heard of toilet paper rolls! that's a neat idea."

chinchilla,30601g,soadrokr,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:33:55 2015 UTC,my company Happy Chilla makes the chillawheel line. would you like a link?
chinchilla,30601g,HappyChilla05,2,Wed Mar 25 04:18:51 2015 UTC,We actually just made our first one at the weekend (I say we I mostly just held things while my husband drilled and put it all together).  We made it with a cake tin and a scooter wheel.  I'll point him this way to explain what he did.  We based it a little on this instructable.
chinchilla,30601g,KungFuPup,3,Wed Mar 25 09:11:07 2015 UTC,"Hey. As KungFuPup mentioned, we recently made a new wheel to replace our shop bought 12"" wheel. As our chinchillas are fully grown, the current wheel causes them to arch their back or not use it at all.  The instructable linked will be a rough guide for you but this is basically what you want to do.  1) Buy: Large round cake tin, I recommend 13-16"", Scooter wheel, bolts to insert in the wheel along with washers and hex nuts. 2) Drill a hole in the middle of the cake tin, fed a bolt through a washer, the tin, another washer or two and the scooter wheel. Hex nut it in place, it should spin freely if you just hold the scooter wheel. 3) Dissemble. Drill evenly spaced holes into the 'spokes' of the scooter wheel and fed more bolts through those holes. These bolts can be fed through the cage wall to hold it in place.  If you get a decent quality scooter wheel then the bearing is extremely strong and silent due to them being manufactured for adult stunt scooters. The bearings are also internal so no need to ever grease them.  If you have questions let me know, its taking time for the chinchillas to get used to the new wheel but already I can see it's a vast improvement for their enjoyment not to mention put my mind at ease for their health."

It was on some cage-lining-pans which were in the cage for months before I noticed it in the corner and my girls never touched the stuff. Maybe its some sort of chinchilla safe sticking stuff that isn't hot glue but looks like it?  I'd suggest contacting the retailer and asking what the gunk is.  And if you find out please update me!  =)"

chinchilla,302o5f,5chinnychinchins,2,Mon Mar 23 23:53:56 2015 UTC,"She, but close enough.  I think when the vet said it would loosen, he meant the bumps made in the skin from the constriction of the stitches would fade as the stitches dissolved. I don't know if it is normal for the suture itself to be separating though. I don't recall my hamster or my rat having that happen to them. That sounds like a question for your vet, just in case it is something serious, though I doubt it is. I'm assuming as long as you continue to keep his environment clean, it will continue to heal and gradually close back up."
chinchilla,302o5f,Lagomorphilic,2,Tue Mar 24 08:02:01 2015 UTC,Whoops sorry! *she. Well thank you.  I don't think it looks normal so he is going to the vet today.  I wouldn't want there to be any kind of infection or anything because of it
chinchilla,302o5f,Lagomorphilic,2,Tue Mar 24 14:53:30 2015 UTC,Took him to the vet this morning and it was not a normal thing but the vet said it should heal fine. The skin definatily seperated when it should have stayed together

chinchilla,2zxb4o,5chinnychinchins,1 point,Sun Mar 22 18:47:00 2015 UTC,"This may be a silly question, but what exactly are the liners for? Like does it just collect poop and pee seeps through them?"
chinchilla,2zxb4o,5chinnychinchins,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:57:31 2015 UTC,"Not seeps through, but absorbs. It makes cleaning way easier, and you don't have to tear through disposable, messy bedding. I have a mini shop vac and just vacuum them up (usually daily) then swap them out every few days. The liners can just be shaken out, and hand washed or even thrown in the washer. (Usually I pre rinse them to get most of the pee out before throwing in the washing machine!)  Having multiple liners is super helpful because the quicker you swap them out, the easier they are to clean. When you leave a liner in there a week or longer - it takes a lot more effort to clean once you do."

chinchilla,2zwxem,Rrrrbepirates,2,Sun Mar 22 17:48:16 2015 UTC,"She's just wonderful.  Our first girl took a couple years to really warm up to us, but it was almost like flipping a switch. She got sick, we fed her by hand, and she started to love on us. Her affection level kept growing over time.  She didn't groom us, but would beg to come out wanting to snuggle and nap on our chests or nuzzle our necks with her nose.  We've had Truffle for 6 months; still technically a juvenile. She's starting to get very attached, and will even snuggle now for a few minutes before she gets wiggly. I can't wait to see how sweet she'll be in a year. :)"
chinchilla,2zwxem,0pensecrets,2,Sun Mar 22 18:22:23 2015 UTC,"Chilly likes to occasionally lick and give kisses.  Munchkin, on the other hand, is a strange one. She grazes her teeth on my hand when I go to stroke her and seems to 'test' me by biting with a little force. Not enough to cause pain, or even break skin, but enough for me to feel the pressure.  She's never bitten hard though (although, my girlfriend says that when she was by the cage, she felt Munchkin try to bite her bum through several layers of clothing)"
chinchilla,2zwxem,Sexycornwitch,2,Sun Mar 22 18:09:34 2015 UTC,My Zoe does this. She has me conditioned to give her a treat afterwards. :)

chinchilla,2zyhgl,Skrilmaufive,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:14:38 2015 UTC,"My two girls have really bonded with each other over the past few weeks, but I have a few questions...   There is a copious amount of squeaking going on during grooming sessions. Anyone else hear this from their chins? Is it a happy sound? They've become very anti-social with my and my girlfriend. It's a huge pain getting them to come out of their cage for play time now. Any recommendations to fixing this? How do you guys get your chins out of their cage?"
chinchilla,2zyhgl,maggerz,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:01:37 2015 UTC,"Yup, my boys chatter to each other when they're grooming /smushing. Every now and then there'll be a bark, usually when the younger one gets a little overzealous with his nibbles. But, overall, I think it's a sound of contentment.   How do you get them out of the cage now? Do you scoop them up or use a carrier or dust bath? I've been using a carrier (solid plastic base with the top half metal, love those carriers) to get them out for over a year now and it works like a dream. They now associate the sight and sound (I squeak the spring on the door latch a few times) with getting playtime... though sometimes, to their disappointment, it's just a boring cage cleaning."
chinchilla,2zyhgl,Skrilmaufive,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:11:10 2015 UTC,I can use a dust bath for one of them but the other doesn't fall for it. Maybe I'll try and use a carrier and reward them with a treat for cooperating.
chinchilla,2zyhgl,maggerz,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:34:55 2015 UTC,"It definitely took a while to get them fully on board with the carrier.   It helped when I started to use the wire topped carriers, rather than the hard cloth carrier that I started with. The wire topped one makes it feel more ""open"" and the chillas, who are equal parts curious and suspicious, are more inclined to climb in. After that it was just consistency to train them to hop in. Sometimes that meant waiting for ten minutes with the carrier open at the cage door, waiting. But I let them do it on their own terms each time and each time they got praise and reward (playtime). Now, as long as they're not in an exceptionally sassy mood, they see the carrier and are ready to leap into it before I even get the cage door open.   A tip for your pair: I have two carriers. Sometimes the boys are cooperative and hop in together for playtime. More often than not, Peanut goes careening in and Earmuff wants to slowly investigate the situation. Just as Muff is about to hop in, Peanut freaks out because there has been 30 seconds without chaos and bolts back to the cage, scattering Muff back into the house. This could go on for an hour. Instead, I get one into one carrier, put it down (while Peanut chirps indignantly over what is this time sure to be an infinite separation from his smush buddy), and then let the other one get into his own carrier. Plus, double the carriers means easier wrangling when playtime is over :)"

chinchilla,2ze1kt,Naznac,1 point,Wed Mar 18 11:19:43 2015 UTC,"Yup, weigh him, even with nothing to compare him to it's handy to know how his weight fluctuates over time. (Beware there's a great variance in chins' weights so you're best keeping track individually). We keep basic weight charts and have picked up problems early because of them.  For overweight, when you hold him does he feel firm or a bit flabby?   To be honest some chins are just less active than others and of course activity levels change over their lifetimes. As long as he's happy, healthy and enjoying life it's all good."

I am not a veterinarian, but I assist in medical issues with all animals and foster wild life, but no, I am not a vet or a vet tech.   LLC is ran by me, and we have many breeders and rescue owners in the group willing to give advice. I posted my own comment on this thread.   Yes, this chin needs medical attention.   The gauze can stop bleeding but wrongly wrapped can cause more problems.   These owners should not be trying to set the bone back in place, that can cause more flesh damage.   I am a proud owner and individual rescuer of 12 years. The vet is the ONLY option in this situation.   Do not, I repeat, DO NOT give an animal with a break ANY exercise until they're healed, otherwise you'll cause more damage. Chins don't just walk around carefully. No play time.   Vet."

A broken limb with a chinchilla usually results in a amputation. Why? Because chinchillas can not be easily immobilized to allow their breaks to heal.   You can not put a splint or cast on a chinchilla, they will still ""use"" the limb or chew out of it.   Amputation is the only logical and humane option, and if financially that isn't available it's NOT okay to allow the animal to suffer with a break - Euthanasia.   Any vet can provide emergency services; So call every vet clinic you can for the sake of your Chinchilla."

chinchilla,2yqiul,dripless_cactus,2,Thu Mar 12 00:44:56 2015 UTC,My chin did this with her old food bowl. I had to get one that attached to the cage otherwise her hay was all over my floor. Even the heavy ones.
chinchilla,2yqiul,badwolf7850,6,Thu Mar 12 02:11:47 2015 UTC,"yep, they just like to redecorate. mine and some of my customer's chins flip their house over and sit in it like a boat."

chinchilla,2yqiul,anti09,3,Thu Mar 12 04:39:06 2015 UTC,"Mine have started turning a house all the way around to face the other way.  I think they do it to mess with me. Sometimes they manage to wedge some things under their wheel and then get really angry at me that the wheel won't turn.  They also love taking food to the top of the cage, take one bite and then drop it."
chinchilla,2yqiul,KungFuPup,2,Thu Mar 12 09:44:15 2015 UTC,"Mine turned his house to face away from the cage doors. Now we can't see what he's up to without walking around the cage. (""Are you still alive?"")  He eventually kept turning it, though."

chinchilla,2yqiul,Neren1138,1 point,Thu Mar 12 16:51:34 2015 UTC,One of mine started burrowing in her fleece instead of using her tube. Now she's back to the tube.   Chins are weird :3
chinchilla,2yqiul,5chinnychinchins,1 point,Sun Mar 15 04:22:24 2015 UTC,"Mine do that too. They have the same house but there is a lower ledge on the right corner of the cage and they always move it under the ledge so that they can snuggle up in the two inch space between the top of the house and the bottom of the ledge. It doesn't matter how many times I move the house, an hour later it will be back under the ledge."
chinchilla,2yn9dr,maggoo,3,Wed Mar 11 04:36:56 2015 UTC,"I unfortunately had the same situation a couple of years back with my two chins. Both males from the same litter, purchased from a breeder at the same time and raised together for several years. They were about 7 when one started to attack the other pretty consistently. It got to the point that one had actually cut the other's ear pretty badly. I tried everything I could and even spoke to my vet about it. In the end, I had to separate them in completely different cages."
chinchilla,2yn9dr,nadahoe,3,Wed Mar 11 08:36:28 2015 UTC,"This happened to me as well. Brothers, lived together since birth until about 5 years old and then they started fighting. It got so bad I needed to separate them for good to avoid injury"
chinchilla,2yn9dr,iFartWhenILaughh,2,Wed Mar 11 14:11:47 2015 UTC,Gosh that is so weird.. I wonder if they just turn into grumpy old men at that age
chinchilla,2yn9dr,ernieball,3,Wed Mar 11 14:59:35 2015 UTC,Are they altered? It could be a territorial thing that flares up as they mature.
chinchilla,2yn9dr,ernieball,2,Wed Mar 11 15:59:39 2015 UTC,Both are intact yet.
chinchilla,2yn9dr,calafragilistic,2,Wed Mar 11 17:49:09 2015 UTC,"My chin's a solo kiddo so I haven't thought much about altering him, and I don't have experience with multiples, but it might be something to look in to?"
chinchilla,2yn9dr,ernieball,2,Wed Mar 11 17:53:43 2015 UTC,Do you mean neutering?
chinchilla,2yn9dr,calafragilistic,2,Wed Mar 11 18:07:52 2015 UTC,Yep :D  (altered/intact = gender generic words for spayed/neutered or not)
chinchilla,2yn9dr,ernieball,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:13:14 2015 UTC,I'm not the chinch owner of the house-gf has 2 with 1 one then being a rescue that was neutered due to policy. I can't recall the reasons but she asserts that neutering is a huge mistake for this animal
chinchilla,2yn9dr,calafragilistic,2,Wed Mar 11 18:15:38 2015 UTC,"Interesting - I'd definitely do loads of research on the subject before hand, then. I've only had my one little dude, so I'm not at all an authority on the topic. Just speaking from experience regarding canine and feline spay/neuter (which is, in my opinion, paramount to responsible guardianship in most cases). Different species though, so again - loads of research is in order."

We adopted two female chins, but then the vet told us they were male.  The parts don't look that different on them, so we took her word for it.  My wife was kinda bugged by it, did some reading, re-checked for herself and determined that the vet was wrong.  We had already picked male names and been using them for months, though, so we stuck with Solo & Chewy."

Have you also checked the areas to the side of his penis? The testes/area around them can become inflamed and also cause him to act like that - you'd see swelling and maybe some redness.
chinchilla,2yjx5u,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:29:19 2015 UTC,"Noooo, there wasn't any redness from what I could see. He hasn't made the noises before but everything he does every other day. If he keeps doing it then I'll just take him to the vet."

chinchilla,2yhzn8,plasticblue94,3,Mon Mar 9 23:35:34 2015 UTC,"Little fur mats do happen, especially if they fur chew or get something on them, but just as often it's just shed fur is working its way out. I would check that it is just matted fur that's causing the bumps you feel and that the bumps aren't on or under her skin - you can gently part the fur at the site to see.  You can tease them out - personally I'd gently use fingers rather than a comb - but they should work out on their own after a while. Unless they're causing her problems, with a new chin that's not keen on being handled I'd lean towards leaving it and just checking on them every so often unless she'll let you groom her without holding her. Some single chins are quite happy to stand there while you 'groom' them like another chin would."
chinchilla,2yhzn8,Pipiya,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:42:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks! as far as I can tell the fur bumps aren't causing her problems. I don't feel anything on her skin, so I think that is healthy. I might leave them there until she gets better about being held."

chinchilla,2yg34w,stringythingy,2,Mon Mar 9 14:58:34 2015 UTC,how did you check her teeth? did you have a vet examine her?
chinchilla,2yg34w,_ataraxia,2,Mon Mar 9 15:26:27 2015 UTC,"I mean as in opened her mouth and just visually looked at her teeth for length, color and whatever else we could see."
chinchilla,2yg34w,_ataraxia,5,Mon Mar 9 15:27:33 2015 UTC,"drooling is a sign of oral health problems, and not all oral health problems are going to be obvious enough for you to see them just by opening her mouth. she might have an abcess that's hard to see, she might have issues with the roots of her teeth, etc."
chinchilla,2yg34w,Dalisca,2,Mon Mar 9 15:31:56 2015 UTC,That's kind of what I've seen through my general search. I'm going to try to find a vet in our area but was hoping to find maybe someone who has gone through this so I can be prepared for care and cost. Thanks.
chinchilla,2yg34w,Dalisca,2,Mon Mar 9 15:59:43 2015 UTC,"I have. Long-term it becomes taking them in every few months for a tooth trimming, $300 a pop depending on the vet. At first it's every six months, and it slowly becomes more and more frequent. You have to learn how to make soft food for them out of their pellets because they will not be able to eat normally sometimes.  It's kinda' terrible, degenerative, and usually fatal. We struggled with Nougat's teeth for over 3 years; she died last summer from a stroke (though we were close to having to take her in to be put to sleep). She would cycle through good and bad, but eventually her good stopped happening.   She stayed good, though. She was the happiest little friendly girl - our ""puff shine"", even when she was sickly. She died curled up on my chest, and her last act was to snuggle just a little closer, as though I could protect her from it. I wish we only had more time. We miss her so much."
chinchilla,2yg34w,Pipiya,2,Tue Mar 10 03:07:57 2015 UTC,Oh no that's so sad. Ours doesn't appear to be acting differently or eating any less than normal. We're hopefully going to get her to a vet Wed. Fingers crossed.

It was the end of chinchilla play time, and I freaking out because I couldn't find Willoughby anywhere. I knew he had to be in the room somewhere because the door was closed. I panicked a bit, then decided to just be really quiet. After a while, I heard quiet scratching noises coming from the desk. Turned out there was a very small space behind the closed desk drawers and he had climbed up there and was just sort of lounging out behind the top drawer. I removed the drawer and he looked disappointed that his super secret hideout had been revealed.   :P"

We've bonded quite a bit but he still does not like to be held much and can be a bit skittish.  Is this a personality thing or will he become more docile when he gets a bit older?"
chinchilla,2ydz2k,dripless_cactus,5,Wed Mar 11 00:08:07 2015 UTC,"Some people get lucky, but for the most part a lot of chins just don't like to be held that much. They are hyper to explore and like their interaction with you to be on their terms. If he hops on your lap during playtime for 10 seconds, count it as affection. :)   You should try to handle him as much as possible while he is still young though, that can have some influence."

chinchilla,2y6vz7,DeathHaze420,9,Sat Mar 7 00:36:21 2015 UTC,"This is complete speculation, and I might be completely wrong... maybe it is because they are both still pretty young? I would keep an eye on them still in case they have a spat, but it sounds like you really lucked out!  Also, for future reference, it's good practice to keep new animals in separate rooms for a quarantine period when you first get them. Just in case the new chin turns out to be sick, so the other one doesn't catch it too. (I'm sure a lot of people don't do this and it is usually fine, so I wouldn't stress out it about now.)"
chinchilla,2y6vz7,nmmtns,2,Sat Mar 7 00:37:29 2015 UTC,"I had two chins bond instantly. The one I got was about 8mo from cragislist, and the one I already had was about a year and a half old. My established guy, Monte, I know is a real sweetheart and loves everyone. Olaf, the new one, was scared, barking constantly and he was so lonely from his previous situation that he chewed his tail fur all the way down to the nub.   I watched them the whole day while I was there and they never had a single issue. They are a great pair now and olaf's fur is well on its way to growing back completely. =)   Chins are like us, no two the same!

The only things I've noticed is Booger needs a little extra scratchins on that side as he can't reach. He also doesn't seem to care about exercise toys but that could just be his personality."

chinchilla,2y3tzz,captainbutt,1 point,Fri Mar 6 15:37:37 2015 UTC,Good luck!  They will be lazy for a few days. Very off balance for about two weeks. Take shelves and wheels out of cage till you feel he is ready. Keep shelves low when you do put them back. Are they taking off the whole leg or just the foot?
chinchilla,2y3tzz,captainbutt,2,Fri Mar 6 15:41:35 2015 UTC,Half way down the thigh. The net is waiting to do the surgery until I know for sure although he is sitting at the vet now so I need to decide soon. It's a back leg

chinchilla,2y3tzz,captainbutt,3,Fri Mar 6 16:30:29 2015 UTC,I just called a chin rescue to see what they said and they said defiantly amputate. He would always be in pain if I didn't. There is high risk of infection and it will never heal correctly. So I'm going for it
chinchilla,2y3tzz,Lagomorphilic,2,Fri Mar 6 16:53:49 2015 UTC,"Our female had an amputation a few months ago.  Before the surgery, we took all the platforms and her wheel out of her cage so she couldn't do anymore damage with her arm dangling.  She kept trying to jump around like she didn't have a broken leg.  I don't know what can keep him from chewing it tonight, but he should be able to have a normal life as a tri-ped.  You shouldn't have to worry about him chewing anything after the surgery.  It's just going to be a bald spot with no visible stitches.  I believe they use some sort of glue to hold the skin flap shut over the stitches so nothing is visible.  The hair will grow back and it won't look as bad.  They will also give you several medications that you will have to feed him several times a day with a syringe.  We were lucky since she apparently loved the taste of it and took it just fine.  I hope everything goes well with your chin, losing a front leg will barely slow him down.  He will adjust and learn to center his front leg to get around.  Our tri-ped is still very active and friendly, but she just takes a few nosedives once in a while."

I'm worried I'm not doing the right thing.  I'd you were in my situation would you do the amputation or try to wait longer to see if it may heal?  The vet said it for sure won't heal straight
chinchilla,2y3tzz,Nezhka,1 point,Fri Mar 6 15:59:31 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what I would do if it was a back leg.  If it won't heal straight, I'm not sure what kind of life he would have.  I honestly don't know what to say.  I'm so sorry this happened to him.  Did they say if he would be able to walk with it amputated?"

chinchilla,2y2izj,dxm765,6,Thu Mar 5 22:12:40 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think its attention. Some people say its them calling for a mate, but I think its just loneliness. Mine is alone. And only barks when I tend to not give her the attention she wants.  Or if we bring the dogs into her room and pet the dogs and ignore her. That seems to make her feel bad and she barks to get some lovin' too."

chinchilla,2y2izj,Nezhka,3,Thu Mar 5 22:47:54 2015 UTC,I have a pair and one is vocal like that. I'm not sure why he does it. It seems like he does it in his sleep because they are in the room with us an we see he appears to not be awake.
chinchilla,2y2izj,mekoche,5,Fri Mar 6 01:17:48 2015 UTC,My boy does it a few times a month. It sounds like he's in pain but I have never connected it to him actually acting like he's in pain. I still don't know why he does it. It sounds very different from his mating call which is more like cooing.
chinchilla,2y2izj,liquefaction187,5,Fri Mar 6 01:30:50 2015 UTC,"My boy does the exact thing you're describing. My guess is nightmares that are waking him up. I've seen the same behavior in dogs, so I assume chinchillas are not immune. I wonder what chins dream of..."
chinchilla,2y2izj,sbrinkman93,5,Fri Mar 6 03:21:17 2015 UTC,"Mine cries out in his sleep fairly regularly. The first time I heard it, I definitely freaked out. Not usually while he's awake, though."
chinchilla,2y2izj,doctorace,1 point,Fri Mar 6 06:34:07 2015 UTC,My chins have little night terrors and make this pathetic scared sound. I've heard its really common. It's pretty much the only time they are vocal except the occasional short bark when i try to pick the up against their will.
chinchilla,2y2izj,dripless_cactus,1 point,Fri Mar 6 21:07:22 2015 UTC,"This is very common, and it's usually nothing to worry about even though it sounds loud and scary.  It's either nightmares or indigestion. Our chins are scared of their own farts, so they squeak evey time they do them."
chinchilla,2y2izj,ConfidenceManTwo,2,Sat Mar 7 17:22:54 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Tofu dreams, because one while he was asleep, I saw him making motions like he was holding invisible food in his hand and chewing and making happy squeaks.

It can still get clogged with hay so I usually sweep up hay and toss it separately. (If it does clog, I take the hose outside and stick a broom handle in there... usually takes care of it quite nicely.)  I use a standard upright for smaller messes."
chinchilla,2y1fdi,Nezhka,2,Thu Mar 5 18:42:14 2015 UTC,"Haha, another for a ShopVac. I bought it specifically because of the chin hay/poop cleanup. Just don't get one of the really tiny ones. My ShopVac also helped us unclog our toilet when the toddler flushed a toothbrush down it and it was wedged in the pipe (yay for wet/dry) and it's great for vacuuming out cars. So they are quite useful."

chinchilla,2xyvqz,SmileyCat2,3,Thu Mar 5 00:43:30 2015 UTC,"Actually not to scare you too much or anything, but worst case is probably none of the chins getting along anymore, at least for a while. If bringing in the new chinchilla causes a competition for dominance, your two already-bonded chinchillas could end up fighting for a while until they re-establish dominance. Of course they could all get along perfectly from the beginning and there may be no problems at all... Just something to watch out for! And make sure when you introduce them all it's in completely neutral territory! A place none of them spend any significant amount of time in."
chinchilla,2xyvqz,bella26piano,2,Thu Mar 5 05:25:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the great advice, hopefully they don't all end up hating each other!  It took 8 weeks before I let my two sleep in the same cage and hang out all day together. I'm going to assume this process will take longer.  Also introduction wise, should I introduce them to each other one at a time? I know my oldest is familiar with the new guy but they never really interacted after we brought them home. Or should I just get some extra supervision and let all three out at once?"
chinchilla,2xyvqz,bella26piano,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:38:03 2015 UTC,"Well I think I've had the most success introducing them all at once. I believe the reason my two bonded ones started fighting is because I let them out with the new chinchilla separately and then they could smell her on each other and got jealous/possessive... Hopefully that's not a typical case, but I would have multiple people that your chins trust in the room and let the bonded pair interact with the new one together. I think exploring a new companion together would be better than potential drama that might result from them meeting separately."
chinchilla,2xwjiq,Toadfish91,1 point,Wed Mar 4 13:18:30 2015 UTC,What kind of hay are you feeding? It should be Timothy hay. How are you giving it to her? On the floor? In a hay manger? In one of those hay wheels?  What kind of pellets are you feeding? Is it a mix or straight pellets? Chinchillas are notoriously picky eaters!   Do you have bedding on the ground?   I would try getting her some compressed hay cubes and see if she likes those more.
chinchilla,2xwjiq,fingerpies,1 point,Wed Mar 4 14:50:25 2015 UTC,She's 1 year old. I feed her Timothy hay but i dont think its ox bow (im at work right now.) I put it in a corner of the bottom part of her cage. I have compressed wood pellets for bedding And i feed her regular pellets in a dish. I'll check out those cubes and see if the local pet stores have them.
chinchilla,2xwjiq,dripless_cactus,1 point,Wed Mar 4 15:55:51 2015 UTC,When we were feeding loose hay I found we had to switch brands a lot based off the season and the harvest. American pet diner would have better hay than Oxbow and then switch again.
chinchilla,2xwjiq,lilbuns,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:30:35 2015 UTC,Brand name hay doesn't really matter to chinchillas (pellets are a different matter).... although I did find that I was more allergic to Kaytee hay (would get hives and itchiness if I didn't wear gloves... which I usually didn't) than Oxbow.. I'm not sure what's up with that.
chinchilla,2xwjiq,Nezhka,2,Thu Mar 5 16:49:09 2015 UTC,"What brand of hay do you buy, and what size bag? You could try buying higher quality hay in a small-ish bag. The large bags tend to have larger/thicker pieces of hay. Oxbow IMO is the best brand you can buy in pet stores, and they have a variety of hay. Meadow grass, timothy hay, oat hay, orchard grass, and botanical hay. I mix it up and buy different ones sometimes."
chinchilla,2xwjiq,Kjerikaye,1 point,Wed Mar 4 14:52:32 2015 UTC,Are all those types of hay recommended?  I remember reading that you're not supposed to give them orchard Grass.
chinchilla,2xwjiq,ConfidenceManTwo,1 point,Wed Mar 4 15:55:42 2015 UTC,"The only hay to avoid is alfalfa hay, as most pellets are made of that.  Alfalfa is high in calcium, so since they get plenty of calcium from the pellets it's not recommended to give another source. I buy Oxbow hay, and give them a mix of Orchard Grass, Botanical Hay and Oat Hay.  They seem to enjoy the variety, and really go for all the little flower bits that come in the Botanical hay bag.  :)"
chinchilla,2xwjiq,soadrokr,3,Thu Mar 5 05:34:40 2015 UTC,"My boys only select the highest quality hay strands when I put it out for them. I can tell they go back later and eat more, though, because by morning the hay is all over the floor of their cage and on the floor around the cage. The rejected hay outside the cage suddenly becomes very delicious during play time when it is time for them to go back in. :P They have to stop and eat each strand. Yum.   So, your chin might be gong back for seconds later when you aren't looking. So long as her poops look okay, she is probably fine.  :)"

Once she busted the bed apart we took the braids and tied them to the ttop of her cage. One of her pet peeves is having stuff on her top shelf. Literally anything up there will get thrown off. Usually as she looks you right in the eye. The braids of timmothy hay drove her insane! She would grab them and yank on them violently, spin around, come to the front of the cage, chatter at me and call me an arsehole in chinchilla language, grab another braid, rip at it until they were all gone. She wouldn't let me pet her for a few days she was so mad.  Either that or I'm anthropomorphising too much, but she definitely hates stuff being up on the top level."

chinchilla,2xmcov,cooterrooter,10,Mon Mar 2 01:21:07 2015 UTC,"Do you have a dust bath house for them? If so it's the PERFECT carrier to do so. Open the cage and hold the bath house up so they can get in, carry them to the play area and set it down. Rinse and repeat for the rest.   On the side, start building trust with them and your hands. I started by opening the cage and putting a treat on my hand towards my wrist and laying my hand open and flat. After a while they will come around to the idea that they can jump on your hand and be okay. Just kind of keep teasing the treat further away until they have to jump into your palm to get it. Then just pretend your hand is a ledge and keep it flat. Chinnies are very curious, but very reserved, so be patient, it's a process."
chinchilla,2xmcov,sdyawg,5,Mon Mar 2 01:51:51 2015 UTC,That's such a great suggestion. I actually had to put the dust bath house up to the cage yesterday and they jumped in and did their thing. Didn't even think to use that to transfer them. This sub is so cool.

One however likes to dash for under the sofa (not particularly safe) so I use a cardboard fence I made to block off most of the room so she can pretty much only go out of the door or potter around in a small safe area.  For water bottles we've tried more expensive ez-filla ones (they locked up and the chins didn't seem to like the different valve) and glass living world ones (heavy and harder to clean the nozzle) and to be honest the cheap plastic ones (£1.50) from the pet shop have been what the chins are happiest with."

chinchilla,2xlmpj,brittafiltaperry,7,Sun Mar 1 21:42:36 2015 UTC,The only risk is having a vet who doesn't know the proper dosage for anesthesia on chinchillas. Find a vet who has experience with chinchillas and with anesthetizing them.

chinchilla,2xlmpj,CharlieBaby4,1 point,Mon Mar 2 00:48:29 2015 UTC,I had one who had to go under a few times a year for teeth fillings. Just make sure you get a vet with specific chinchilla experience
chinchilla,2xlmpj,voiceinthedesert,1 point,Mon Mar 2 05:07:22 2015 UTC,"As long as her organs are working fine, she should be fine. Perhaps ask the vet if he thinks bloodwork would be worth it. Bloodwork (and an xray of the chest) will let the vet know if their organs are functioning well enough to process the anesthesia. If they are just using gas anesthesia though, the risks are especially low since it blows off really quickly as opposed to injectable anesthetic."
chinchilla,2xlmpj,Lagomorphilic,1 point,Mon Mar 2 09:47:48 2015 UTC,"We've had a few chinnies go under anaesthesia for various operations and once or twice for teeth x-rays. The x-ray is fairly short so I don't think they have as much anaesthetic as for an operation. The ones who've had x-rays were in and out fairly quickly and back to their bouncy selves within a couple of hours. The ones who had ops were all ok from the procedures but a couple experienced gut stasis problems from the anaesthesia (we've nearly lost two from ileus -where the gut stops working).   From those experiences, any time a chin gets anaesthetic I would strongly recommend that you ask your vet about giving a gut mobility drug (such as metoclopramide) along with it to prevent ileus. It should be standard practice with chins, rabbits and guinea pigs and in some vet practices it is."

It's gonna take a while for them to accept each other... After 6 weeks my two girls (6 months old and 5 months old) are finally grooming and cuddling in the same cage together.  Takes it slow, put their cages next to each other and just let them smell each other for a week.  Give them a good week of individual playtimes, and when they aren't being aggressive through the cage bars, then you can take them out for 10-15 mins together.   Doesn't really matter if you are paying attention to the new girl, your previous chin shouldn't mind. The new chin's comfort in your home is paramount to the introduction working."
chinchilla,2xky96,Skrilmaufive,1 point,Sun Mar 1 20:54:23 2015 UTC,Mine didn't spray at all. They actually just snuggled right up to one another and fell asleep
chinchilla,2xky96,whatsername121,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:00:44 2015 UTC,"When you put them together, only do it in neutral territory. If Avie normally runs around in that room then she will likely see that as her territory. Not a good idea. Put them together ONLY in neutral territory where neither of them spend much time at all, and then once they're BFFs you can let them in each other's territory carefully."
chinchilla,2xky96,bella26piano,1 point,Sun Mar 1 21:45:23 2015 UTC,"Odd as it may sound, one spraying the other isn't necessarily that bad, it makes little Trixie smell like Avie and is usually more about dominance than aggression. Even if it is meant aggressively it's a relatively low aggression warning, if Avie felt really threatened she'd attack with teeth. The question is, how did Trixie take it?  We had a couple who came together later in life (fixed older boy + older girl) who'd both lost their cage mates and they were inseparable in a very short space of time... however the girl sprayed him lots! Even after they were living together you'd pick him up and he'd be a little sticky :ugh: but he seemed happy with it and she seemed to be marking him and establishing her dominance (he was the definition of whipped and very happy with it!) rather than spraying in warning.  I would keep their cages close and try again in a couple of days. Considering some of the introductions we've tried it sounds not too bad - as long as it looks like Trixie will accept Avie's dominance I'd still be hopeful."

chinchilla,2xfjig,5chinnychinchins,3,Sat Feb 28 04:15:55 2015 UTC,I have no advice but I'm so sorry the little one got hurt :(
chinchilla,2xfjig,mi_buger,1 point,Sat Feb 28 05:33:39 2015 UTC,Thank you. Hopefully he will be fine
chinchilla,2xfjig,Dalisca,1 point,Sat Feb 28 19:44:33 2015 UTC,"I don't have any advise per se, but I do remember reading a story here a time ago about a chin who had a leg amputated and recovered its mobility.   In the wild he'd be in trouble, but with a caring chin parent he'll be fine."
chinchilla,2xfjig,Lagomorphilic,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:03:13 2015 UTC,Well that's a positive though. I hope that happens. right now he has a full leg cast on he tried to start chewing off his leg since it didn't work and the cast is keeping him from doing that
chinchilla,2xfjig,Lagomorphilic,1 point,Sat Feb 28 19:44:15 2015 UTC,"I hope it heals straight, but if it doesn't show signs of healing properly, I would just get the leg taken off. If it heals incorrectly, it can cause pain the rest of his life.  I had to go through amputations with a rat and a hamster. My rat had a bad bone infection (we thought it was cancer actually at the time) and we believe my hamster fell in her cage. They both healed amazingly well. A couple hours after surgery, my hamster was running around the cage like she was always a tripod, and my foster rat was up and moving pretty soon after surgery as well. After day 8, the fur started growing back like wild fire, and by day 13, it was almost fully healed. I documented the incision on my hamster for 20 days after surgery, if you are interested in seeing the healing process a bit.  I have been through similar experiences with chinchillas as well, because I foster so we often see some weird cases. There was once a girl named Willa whose front leg was backwards. It had apparently broken sometime in the past and healed that way. It was awful, but she didn't let it bug her too much, though I could tell she found it a bit discomforting at times. I also had another foster named Angeal who didn't have a right rear leg at all. We suspect it was amputated sometime prior to us getting her. Its funny though because we never actually noticed she didn't have a leg until a week after getting her! She got around just as well if not better then other chinchillas I have had. There was another chinchilla in the rescue (not my foster though) who had to have its leg amputated after it got hurt in a wheel, I believe. The chinchilla healed really well, and moved around without any problems from what I hear. If you do the amputation, rest assured it likely will go off without a hitch and your chinchilla will have no problems getting around."
chinchilla,2xfjig,Lagomorphilic,1 point,Sat Feb 28 23:40:08 2015 UTC,They said it most likely won't heal strait but because of where the break is it won't hurt him if it heals back a little crooked. I'm glad to hear you had so many success stories though. Thank you. Makes me feel a little better about amputation if we have to.
chinchilla,2xfjig,Lagomorphilic,1 point,Sun Mar 1 15:44:37 2015 UTC,"If it's going to heal crooked, even a little, I would just amputate."
chinchilla,2xfjig,liquefaction187,1 point,Sun Mar 1 17:21:06 2015 UTC,But they said it wouldn't cause him any trouble or hurt him. Why do you say that
chinchilla,2xfjig,ShyLilah,1 point,Mon Mar 2 00:58:59 2015 UTC,"Because most vets have told me that if a bone heals wrong, it can cause discomfort for the rest of their lives, even if it is just a little off.  I would just take it off to be on the safe side, but it's up to you and your vet. If the bone is broken in a good spot, then it should heal straight and be fine, but if the vet has said it will heal crooked, I would be concerned."
chinchilla,2xcxut,tadoke,8,Fri Feb 27 15:32:11 2015 UTC,"Unlike humans, chinchillas don't blink in unison.  So, this is perfectly normal (unless you notice a discharge, or an eye staying closed for longer than a wink)."
chinchilla,2xcxut,Dalisca,8,Fri Feb 27 15:50:20 2015 UTC,My chin winks too. I usually wink back haha.
chinchilla,2xcxut,cinderellab,2,Fri Feb 27 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"Our chinchillas wink pretty frequently. I wouldn't worry about it at all! I believe it's fairly normal (and of course also very cute).  If he starts keeping one or both eyes partially closed all the time, or you see wetness around the eye, that's a different story and would mean it's time for a vet visit."

chinchilla,2x88wr,Payne643,3,Thu Feb 26 13:06:18 2015 UTC,Question on the dark nose cutie on the right. Was his nose always that color or did it darken with age? My girl has had a faint dark spot on her nose that is getting darker over the years. It isn't a mole and I couldn't find any info about their skin spots growing.
chinchilla,2x88wr,DeathHaze420,3,Thu Feb 26 16:26:43 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid I've only had them a few months! Are you talking about the white? He is an older chin so it could be possible for it to have grown as he got older. If you're worried, I'd say a visit to the vet wouldn't go amiss! If it's not bothering her, you could maybe wait and see if it gets bigger- maybe take a before and after picture for reference at the vet?   Hope this helps!"

chinchilla,2x4v3e,Skrilmaufive,11,Wed Feb 25 18:01:37 2015 UTC,"To start, please do not trim their whiskers. This is not good for the chin's mental and physical health (how would you feel if someone temporarily removed your eyes from your head? it's the same deal). If you're trying to get them to like each other, do not forget that they may never like each other. You'll have to learn to deal with that. Regardless, the best method tends to be keeping them in separate cages in the same room until they learn to live with each other. Masking the scent will likely only work temporarily, since once they smell the other chin's scent when the vanilla wears off, they will probably go back to fighting. Start slow, and do it without using tricks."
chinchilla,2x4v3e,killachains82,3,Wed Feb 25 20:05:27 2015 UTC,agreed. And i'd like to add- keep at it! my chins have been in the same room in separate cages for 2 years now and still fight. Some chins just don't get along. Don't take it personally but don't force it either!
chinchilla,2x4v3e,woodntyaknow,4,Wed Feb 25 23:54:15 2015 UTC,"It's been 2 months so far, definitely taking our time. I won't touch their whiskers again, but I tried the vanilla method again today...  They're actually grooming each other and being very friendly.  This is the first time they've ever groomed.   I'm so happy."
chinchilla,2x4v3e,KungFuPup,1 point,Thu Feb 26 02:48:48 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't rub vanilla extract on their noses.  Vanila extract contains a high amount of alcohol which can irritate skin (think about those hand gels in hospitals and how they dry your hands if you use them a lot).  I can't imagine I'd like that rubbed on my nose and human noses aren't as sensitive.  Like /u/killachains82 said you need to learn to be patient and let them take it at their pace, you can't force it.  I got mine together and they're generally nice to each other but every so often one annoys the other and they fight."
chinchilla,2x4v3e,fingerpies,2,Thu Feb 26 09:05:12 2015 UTC,"I have three brothers that I've had since they were a few months old and almost a year ago I adopted a lone male from a terrible breeding/ hoarding situation. (It had been posted on this sub actually.) They tend to just ignore each other but I've never tried to let them all play together. Mainly because I'm scared of them fighting.   I'd really like to be able to house everyone together.   Their cages have been about 3-5 feet apart this whole year.  I also moved to a new house last August, so they have a whole room to themselves, and got moved in at the same time, so I would imagine they would feel like it's a shared territory.  Should I just let everyone out of their cages and see what happens?   How do you break up a chinchilla fight? How do I tell if they're really fighting or just establishing a pecking order?"
chinchilla,2x4v3e,arielefoltz,2,Thu Feb 26 04:02:58 2015 UTC,"Try to let them play all together. Have their cages open and ready to go if there's a fight so you can separate them quickly. My boys only got into one fight, and it was really just a yelling match, so all I did was watch to make sure no one drew nor lost blood. If you see biting or kicking, grab tails and separate immediately."

chinchilla,2x1wna,MerryMunchie,3,Wed Feb 25 00:08:30 2015 UTC,"fleece is your best bet, at least to cover whatever padding you have in the cage. there's a reason so many chin owners use fleece as cage liners, for hammocks, etc.  does it matter what material the mesh is made of? because obviously a metal wire mesh would be more chew-proof than something made of plastic."
chinchilla,2x1wna,_ataraxia,4,Wed Feb 25 00:30:48 2015 UTC,"I agree that fleece would work well for lining. I would also think that a metal mesh would be better than a soft cage, just in terms of sturdiness when it's being handled by airline staff.  On short notice, I don't know where you'd find exactly the right mesh size... did the airline have any recommendations? It seems like the mesh would need to be very fine to keep their paws from fitting through it. As a last resort, maybe you could try a trip to Home Depot or somewhere like that for a fine metal mesh that could be added to the cage to retrofit it? If you had more time, I would suggest contacting a company like www.martinscages.com and asking about custom options.  I'd be interested to hear more about the whole flying a chinchilla across the country thing! How much are you paying for this? It sounds like it's a service offered by United Airlines?  I've done a couple of interstate moves with chinchillas (one or two days of straight driving) and it was always stressful but manageable. Lots of AC blasting, and a blanket on the cage for some shade. I don't know what we would have done if we had been flying.  FYI for any others that might be reading, the only possible alternative that I considered was trying to find a breeder who was driving a group of chinchillas cross-country to a chinchilla show. A site like www.chins-n-hedgies.com would be a good starting point to coordinate something like this."

chinchilla,2wzrz3,elvens,3,Tue Feb 24 14:55:19 2015 UTC,"Good on ya for taking her to the vet!  I've had chins with soft poos before, long before I knew that things like raisins were actually terrible for chinchillas. The second I stopped giving them soft sugary foods (raisins, dried cranberries, etc. - they were provided by the breeder!) as treats, and stuck to just good pellets and good hay, it started evening it out.   Chins have very fragile little digestive systems. Stick to the basics and they should be healthy and good to go.  Good pellets like Oxbow Essentials Chinchilla food combined with plain timothy hay should be it.   IF, and I only mean after your chin has been back to normal for a long time, you want to introduce treats back to her diet, make sure that it's something highly recommended as a treat for a chinchilla (NOT wet, NO sugar, etc.) and make sure it's only one very small piece every few days or so. But definitely do your research and wait for a long time before doing that."
chinchilla,2wzrz3,Meikami,2,Tue Feb 24 17:39:25 2015 UTC,"thank you for the response.  yeah the breeder told me they like raisins and almonds as treats.  i'll stick with the hay only diet for a few days and see what happens then reintroduce pellets.  she seems fine, she is as active as she always was , its just the wet poos. she was eating 2 almonds almost every day.  I guess I will change that up to one every few days if she gets better.  I have already stopped giving her raisins.  thanks again for the info."
chinchilla,2wzrz3,Meikami,3,Tue Feb 24 18:34:39 2015 UTC,"Yikes! Bad breeder advice! Two almonds is almost certainly what did it. Nuts are BAD. Too oily and fatty for a poor chin belly to handle. Don't give those to her at all anymore.   Try a 1/4 piece of a bite-sized plain shredded wheat cereal instead.   It's not your fault, btw. It's amazing the amount of bad info there is out there from the people who give us our chins. But! There is a lot of really good info out there too, and you now have a chance to learn a better way for your girl. I highly recommend doing research on www.chins-n-hedgies.com - great forum of very informed (albeit a bit strict at times) chin owners from all over the place."
chinchilla,2wzrz3,Meikami,3,Tue Feb 24 18:46:26 2015 UTC,dammit.  ok.  live and learn.  no more almonds.  she is going to hate me.   I did read about the shredded wheat.  I also tried some burnt toast but only a wee little bit and it didn't do anything.  I might go lurk at that forum but I don't need anyone bitching at me for giving my chinchilla raisins and nuts.  who knew?
chinchilla,2wwtcf,chinchinchinchi,8,Mon Feb 23 20:56:29 2015 UTC,...nuts. Its a boy
chinchilla,2wwtcf,ShyLilah,8,Mon Feb 23 21:22:40 2015 UTC,"Erm, unless I'm looking at the wrong thing, those are his boy parts! (Testes to be precise).   The general consensus is that chinchilla testes are internal so you don't see them often but they do get larger and hang out more when the chins are hot. Our boys were definite and constant show-ers and used to love dragging them over anything cool and smooth! Chinchillers, tablet screens and tiled floors were heaven for them! Ah one even enjoyed hanging them over the edge of a shelf!  If you are concerned or he seems in pain definitely get him to a vet as there can be problems that cause the testes to swell and show more, but it can also be for normal boy reasons."
chinchilla,2wwtcf,Pipiya,7,Mon Feb 23 21:33:20 2015 UTC,"I have two girls, and have never had a male. The dragging thing made me spew milk on my keyboard."
chinchilla,2wwtcf,AsteriaRose,5,Mon Feb 23 22:59:52 2015 UTC,Sorry about your keyboard! But an additional thought for you then- their balls are capacitive enough to register on touch screens ...

chinchilla,2wwtcf,AsteriaRose,2,Mon Feb 23 23:33:03 2015 UTC,"""their balls are capacitive enough to register on touch screens ..."" Excellent. The sum of human knowledge is greater today than it was yesterday."
chinchilla,2wwtcf,CalzoneLayer,2,Wed Feb 25 02:09:46 2015 UTC,"I think some chins you can see them and some you can't. Tofu is white and his fur is a little less dense than some of the standard gray colored chinchillas I've seen, and his skin is really pink toned, so you can see his most of the time even if they are mostly pulled up."
chinchilla,2wwtcf,Sexycornwitch,2,Mon Feb 23 23:16:18 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. And the visibility changes over time (with age, temperature, dominance, whether there are girls around, nervous our relaxed). My boys were greys but didn't have the densest fur (nothing to match the old white girl we had for a few years) and their pink bits really did 'hang out', especially in summer."
chinchilla,2wwtcf,Pipiya,3,Mon Feb 23 23:26:03 2015 UTC,He's normal! It's actually his epididymis. The testicles are in the abdomen and you can probably feel those.   Did you friend tell you about cleaning hair rings?
chinchilla,2wtscw,Angry_flesh_ferret,8,Mon Feb 23 02:22:13 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the older chin recognized the baby as a baby, and was just grooming and taking care of him."
chinchilla,2wtscw,Nezhka,4,Mon Feb 23 03:35:06 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your introduction went extremely well! I would say it is not usually what happens, introductions take a few days but its not unheard of for them to go that well. You can probably attempt to house them together within a few days. As far as the water goes i've never heard of a chinchilla having problems figuring out where the water is but i suppose its not impossible, He may learn from the other chin when you house them or just pick it up through observation"
chinchilla,2wtscw,djh3315,7,Mon Feb 23 04:34:41 2015 UTC,"I find that older chins take pretty well to babies, but it sounds like you're being safe and that's exactly the right thing to do. In my experience if they were going to fight they'd have done it right away. Another day or two and I'd feel totally safe letting them make it official.   Is the baby 8 weeks or 10? 8 weeks means he's quite small (most people don't sell them til 10 or 12 weeks). Make sure your cages have bars with 1/2 inch spacing before you leave them overnight. Babies can get stuck or get in big trouble sneaking out of a cage, and it usually happens at night when they're at their naughtiest.   I've had chins not notice the water before, and it's potentially deadly. I wait til they get near the bottle, then tap the ball with my finger a few times. If they don't pay attention I make them sniff my finger (heh). Usually that works."

chinchilla,2wt0dt,Sexycornwitch,5,Sun Feb 22 22:30:04 2015 UTC,"We lost a fantastic girl in July who was so trustworthy that I once fell asleep on the couch with her smuggled on my belly and she was still there when I woke up. She used to ride in our hoodie hoods like a hammock and smuggle or necks in the car. She was white with a silver dusting to her fur and sparkled in the sunlight.   Our new girl is an ebony, and they are like night and day in both appearance and personality. She's extremely squirreley, and we refer to her playtime as a visit to Crazy Town. We've learned that she needs a lot of toys in her play area because she likes to carry them around and stack them in piles. She's also a fingertip nibbler. Still, she's incredibly sweet, quite smart, willing to be cradled on her back like a baby, and incredibly entertaining.   It's amazing how different they are and how they are all so wonderful.  I'm glad you love your fella!  ☺"

He likes to relax and take it slow, he will sit with you and as long as you dont make sudden moves he has no problem with anyone holding him or laying with him...soon as you move too quick he wants to escape and go to him hidy house. Smokey i got from a pet store, hes about 4, we're had our ups and downs...but hes psycho lol. He is all over the place, no room is big enough for all the energy he has, theres never enough toys, and he isnt a cuddler or one to sit still. i think he has chinchilla ADD/ADHD lol. Bear will come up to you to see what youre doing if you have a laptop on the floor with him, smokey will jump on the laptop and then run. If youre on the couch Bear will NOT come see you, but if you put him there he will stay and crawl on the couch. Smokey comes to visit hoping for treats like a little fatty"

One is a chubby, sleepy, friendly ball of fluff that is a little shy of new people but is tame enough to fall asleep on a blanket on my lap. Nicest creature I've ever met.  The other is an insane, evil little chin who only seeks to cause terror and pain to her fellow chinchillas. Very friendly and sociable to me and my girlfriend, but an absolute hellion to any of her similar species. Wish I could somehow convince her to get along with her peers."

chinchilla,2wruu7,julieacts,1 point,Sun Feb 22 18:16:48 2015 UTC,Pooh. I was gonna say that I was considering finding a guy my dude can bond with since he seems pretty lonely and they are around the same age. But I'm all the way in Los Angeles.
chinchilla,2wruu7,Sexycornwitch,5,Sun Feb 22 18:23:53 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on what the long term prognosis is. Is the business you and your boyfriend are going through a temporary thing? A chin can handle a few weeks or months of reduced playtime if you know in the future, that schedule will clear up and you'll have more time to spend with him since it sounds like you still care about him and are ineracting with him as much as you can.   That being said, if the situation is unlikely to improve, you might want to look at a couple different options. I have a couple close friends that Tofu has bonded with and is comfortable with, and who love him. Do you have anyone responsible in your life who loves your guy but isn't in a place to have a pet? Maybe you could offer some sort of skill trade if they wanted to come over a couple times a week and hang out with your guy when you're busy so he gets some extra play time. This might be especially helpful if you know that the business will be reduced after a time.   Ultimately, if you think it's the best thing to give him up, I'm sure you will be able to find someone to take him. 4 is still a pretty young Chin, and if the worst he's ever suffered is lack of out of cage time, he probably has a pretty good personality too."
chinchilla,2wnt4j,Devoured,4,Sat Feb 21 15:23:19 2015 UTC,"I buy my chinchilla pet food from amazon (http://www.amazon.com/SupremePetfoods-Charlie-Chinchilla-Food-2-Pound/dp/B0030N1QZ2), and i also enjoy buying toys for them from there as well. Pet stores rarely have a large selection of toys from them and you can find some cool stuff online! As far as brands go i tend to google something new before i buy it to make sure its recommended for chins (sometimes things are just labeled for small animals). I'd love to see a site like this though, at the moment amazon is my go-to for all things chinchilla related!"
chinchilla,2wnt4j,djh3315,4,Sat Feb 21 16:43:25 2015 UTC,"i, too, buy pretty much all of my chinchilla supplies on amazon. i could buy things in person at a pet store, but i have amazon prime and it's just easier and cheaper to shop online. i'd love to see a chinchilla-focused amazon shop, especially for toys/chews/healthy treats. most of what's on amazon is the same limited variety you can find in any petco/petsmart and it's such a mixed bag in terms of quality."

chinchilla,2wnt4j,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,5,Sun Feb 22 01:23:08 2015 UTC,"I live by a petsmart and not too far from a local feed store (where I go to get my duck food anyways). Both carry Oxbow pellets and Blue Cloud dust. You're going to have a hard time beating them in terms of volume, shipping, price, and convenience. They also both have Critical care and if I need that I'm certainly not going to waste time ordering it online. There is a company that ships boxes of hay on a schedule and my friends highly recommend them. I've seen the quality of the hay and it's much nicer than what you get in the store, but I can get a flake from the local shelter for $5. The same amount of hay anywhere else costs $10.   Where some gains might be made are the startup supplies. If someone could bring together FN/CN cages, bass pans, Bird On the Rocks, Busybunny, fleece cage liners, Chin Spins, Flying Saucers, nice wooden shelves, the herbal treats, and the chin-safe toys with the convenience and security of an amazon account... then you might have something. You would be the de-facto referral to anyone who is getting into chinchillas since you have everything in one place. Then, if they start getting their supplies with you and you have everything they need, why would they go anywhere else?"
chinchilla,2wnt4j,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,1 point,Sat Feb 21 17:46:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the perspective, good point regarding Critical care. Do you recall what the name/URL of this hay company is? Excellent point on the ""startup kit"" thats an idea worth examining..."

chinchilla,2wnt4j,Tvvigzy,3,Sun Feb 22 01:54:28 2015 UTC,A lot of places seem to carry either the commercial chinchilla items OR a nice selection of organic/herbal treats and supplies. I wish one store had BOTH.
chinchilla,2wnt4j,Tvvigzy,5,Sun Feb 22 22:15:02 2015 UTC,"Yes I shop online. I tend to shop at TJs Chinchilla Supplies (http://www.tjschinchillasupplies.com) or ChinchillaCity (http://www.chinchillacity.com/). I buy food and toys from there. Bedding I purchase at Petco. Some random purchases from Amazon. I buy stuff probably every 2 or 3 months (aside from bedding). Petco has a terrible selection of toys and food... I feed Mazuri and bathe her in Blue Cloud. When I go to buy her more food, I choose where I'm buying it from based on which site has the other things that she needs toy-wise (because shipping). I wish I could buy wood stuff for her every time I make a purchase, but TJs is unreliably open (owner has health problems) and ChinchillCity doesn't have the wood stuff I'm looking for. TJs Chinchilla Supplies would be every thing I need if it was open reliably. I browse the Chins-n-Hedgies forum (http://www.chins-n-hedgies.com/forums/index.php)."
chinchilla,2wnt4j,ArtistInTheGarden,1 point,Sat Feb 21 19:43:13 2015 UTC,"Very informative thank you. One of my initial hypothesis was that the selection at major pet store chains was lousy. What exactly do you mean when you say ""wood stuff""? Interesting to hear that TJs has availability issues, when looking at the site it appears that ordering could take a few extra steps. I of course aim for 100% availability."
chinchilla,2wnt4j,Sexycornwitch,1 point,Sun Feb 22 01:09:16 2015 UTC,"Twigs and sticks with the bark on, wood medallions. Ronda's Chins has a good selection, but I haven't ordered from there yet."

chinchilla,2wnt4j,kattiara,1 point,Fri May 8 13:58:22 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the same here, I love TJ's selection of natural herb treats which are really hard to find other places. I prefer natural type toys and treats for my chin. The person who runs TJs is just running a home business and has some health problems that sometimes force them to close the store.   Bedding I get at petco because it's the same price and stuff everywhere. I prefer carefresh becasue Fu isn't a big chewer. He loves food but is hesitant to put anything that's not wood or plants in his mouth, so the carefresh has never been a problem to us but I guess that depends on the Chin.   I'd really love a selection of LARGE apple, pear and loquat wood branches. Not just the little cut down sticks, but more natural shaped branches, maybe about a foot long? Tofu likes all the nubs and branch attachment points and stuff so I try to find natural branches instead of pre-cut small sticks but it's difficult.   I am not picky about the brand of dust Tofu uses as long as it's specifically Chinchilla dust.   He eats Oxbow pellets. Most of his treats are dried herbs, (rose buds, callendula, mallow root, etc. His fave is roses. Any part of the rose plant is his most favorite food.) He also gets a lot of fresh rose leaves and grape vines from my personal garden, but rarely gets processed grains of any sort. I slip him a cheerio if he's being sweet once in a great while though. He also loves mineral chews, and I'd love to see a bigger selection of mineral chews. They are always quite expensive in the pet store, would it be possible maybe to do a bulk stock and split it between orders on mineral chews? I don't know.   I'd also like more fresh grown hay. I don't mind the bagged stuff from the petstore, but if I could find someone selling fresh organic timothy or orchard grass or oat hay, that would be lovely. I know a few people on Etsy sell this but it's pricey.   It'd be neat to be able to set up a monthly box of supplies for subscription, where we could pick different items that are in line with a particular price point, and then have those items sent on a set schedule."
chinchilla,2wnt4j,Sexycornwitch,5,Sun Feb 22 22:08:51 2015 UTC,"I generally buy Mazuri and Blue Cloud dust from Lone Star Chinchilla, and wood from Ronda's Chinchillas.  I also keep an eye on the Sale section of Chins-n-Hedgies for random treats and such.   I use fleece liners instead of bedding, and the site I used to use shut down, so I've been trying to find a new one.   Would love to have one quality site where I could find everything. Good luck!"
chinchilla,2wnt4j,undiurnal,2,Sat Feb 21 22:33:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, I'm amazed by how many tiny chinchilla ecom stores are out there! Ronda's has an incredible wood selection, no wonder you shop there. Could you explain the differences between fleece lining and bedding?"
chinchilla,2wnt4j,undiurnal,3,Sun Feb 22 01:19:42 2015 UTC,"There really are a lot of tiny (and great) online stores! To your original point, though, a lot of them seem to be somewhat under represented. Most of the ones I use, I've found through word of mouth on the chins-n-hedgies forums. The ones I mentioned above are my 'regular' ones, but in the past I've also bought from:   Fuzzie's Kingdom - tunnels, treats, hammocks Simply Chintastic - custom wood houses/ledges (though sadly they seem to be inactive) Chinworld - wood chews / treats   In terms of fleece liners vs bedding - it's really a personal preference. Fleece is generally considered to be the safest fabric for chins since it doesn't unravel into loose threads like other materials would. I have a Ferret Nation cage, and liners specifically sized to fit the bottom of it. The corners get clipped to the edge of the cage so it doesn't move.   With bedding, I found that loose pieces would get onto the floor, and switching it out / cleaning the cage was a more involved process. Plus, obviously, I was buying the bedding itself regularly.  With fleece liners, there's less mess, and I toss them in the laundry after about a week of use. The cage looks cleaner, and I can get the liners in pretty patterns if I want to mix it up a bit. This site has a couple pics, to give you an idea:   http://chinchic.bigcartel.com/product/fleece-liner-set-for-fn142-or-critter-nation-1-flat-1-cut-out"
chinchilla,2wnt4j,SmileyCat2,2,Sun Feb 22 02:36:06 2015 UTC,"Some chins are problem eaters and will try to eat carefresh paper bedding. It can cause bowel problems, and for people that are worried about that or who's chins are big chewers like that, the often use cheap polar fleece to cover the chin cage instead of bedding.   Personally, the carefresh has never been a problem for me and Fu because he's not super into eating things that aren't food, so it depends on the chin and the owner and what works on a case by case basis."
chinchilla,2wnt4j,soadrokr,2,Sun Feb 22 22:13:48 2015 UTC,"I do very little online shopping for our chinchilla--primarily toys and water bottles on the rare occasions I need replacements for the latter. I do buy Mazuri directly from their website; it's easy-to-use and their pricing is excellent.  I live in a major metropolitan area, so it's easy to find most of the things I need locally, and I like to support local businesses.  In terms of frequency, hay and litter are about 1/mo, food 4/year, other items only as needed."
chinchilla,2wnt4j,soadrokr,1 point,Sun Feb 22 02:30:39 2015 UTC,"Do you find the pricing on Mazuri's site as good or better than from other channels like amazon, chin specific sites and brick-and-mortar pet stores? Do they charge shipping? I'd of course like to offer their products in my store."
chinchilla,2wnt4j,Fernweh1,2,Sun Feb 22 18:02:00 2015 UTC,Their pricing on the small consumer bags is similar to that available elsewhere. What is great is the 25# bag for $20. Shipping isn't bad if I plan ahead and put it on slow ground.
chinchilla,2wnt4j,soadrokr,2,Sun Feb 22 21:00:25 2015 UTC,"Yes I have bought chinchilla supplies online, specifically everything besides food, treats and hay.  I use Amazon.ca (I'm located in Canada)   I purchase toys, hus, cage accessories, and one of my cages, the double unit critter nation cage off of amazon. I purchase things every 3 months or so.  Yes and no, I find certain products easy to find, such as food and hay, but I do have a hard time finding chinchilla specific treats that don't have a copious amount of sugar in them. What I dislike is ""locally"" for me counts as a half hour drive to the nearest petsmart.   Brand wise, for food & hay I suck with oxbow. Cages are critter nation and dust I tend to get blue cloud dust, doesn't really matter the brand though.  I buy products more for the brand, if I like the brand and know it's good for them and they like the brand (most importantly) then I stick with those brands.   The only downfall that I find with online purchases is the shipping cost and you can't get as much information as you want for certain products.   I have no idea where chinchilla owners hang out besides Reddit.   As for your edit. The first place I look for cages is local pet stores, after that I'll look online, I find amazon sometimes is cheaper than the pet store + you get free shipping."

chinchilla,2wfxgi,Angry_flesh_ferret,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:24:59 2015 UTC,"Introducing two chins can take some time! Get a second cage and place it relatively close to the other, they should both have a cage that they feel comfortable in and has only their scent. Keep the two chins seperate and let them get used to each other's scents. Let them out and allow them to play together daily and observe their interactions. Once they seem comfortable with one another you can attempt housing them together (keep an eye on them especially during feeding times, they can get feisty) or (what i did) place the cages right next to each other. My boys eventually slept next to each other through the cage and that was the indication i needed that they were ready to be housed together. Mine were good in about a week but i have heard of others taking quite some time!"
chinchilla,2wfxgi,djh3315,3,Thu Feb 19 16:37:14 2015 UTC,"I've introduced males twice and agree with /u/djh3315's advice on cage placement, shared playtime, etc. That's essentially what we did both times, and it seems to have worked in both cases. We also tried swapping them between cages every few days, so they'd have even more opportunity to get used to each other's scent.  When we eventually started putting them in the same cage, at first we limited it to daytime and still kept them separate at night. Our thinking was that we were awake to keep an eye on them, and they were less likely to get rowdy during the day. It took a while because we were pretty cautious, increasing their time together slowly... but eventually it did work out.  Be aware that in some cases, depending on the chins, it just might not work at all. You should be ready to keep them in separate cages indefinitely, or possibly rehome one of them. The first pairing that we had didn't work out for months and months. Eventually when the more aggressive chin started getting sick with malocclusion, he seemed to want company and they became inseparable. I'm not sure they ever would have worked out if he'd remained healthy. However, the other pairing was with a baby and much older calmer male, and they clicked pretty quickly. Good luck!"
chinchilla,2wfxgi,nmmtns,1 point,Thu Feb 19 17:38:54 2015 UTC,I introduced a baby chin (male) to an 2 year old male as well. First I checked weather they will get along on a neutral area- and I think the father instincts of the adult one kicked in as soon as he saw the little one. It was heart breaking really- the new 'papa chin' started grooming the baby instantly and they get along since then. As soon as the little one reached puperty they started to argue about their status but no serious fights and they love each other very much. I have to say I got a new/bigger cage when the little one arrived so I do not know what would have happened if I just had placed the baby chin in the old cage of his new papa.  Good luck to you!
chinchilla,2wfxgi,Fernweh1,1 point,Thu Feb 19 18:23:02 2015 UTC,I Have a big cage now that i planned for them to live in. What would be the best way to go about moving the little one into the older one's existing home? i know the whole territory with smells and such. Should I completely clean it and try to turn it into a neutral area?
chinchilla,2wfxgi,Fernweh1,1 point,Thu Feb 19 18:34:31 2015 UTC,My suggestion would be that when you see they get along on a neutral area but them together in a transport box in your reach and take your time cleaning your cage. Maybe use a diluted (1:10) vinegar solution to wipe the surfaces (it removes odors very efficient) and make sure to rinse everything with water again to get rid of the vinegar at the end (otherwise it could hurt their skin). I hope it will work! Do you have a spare cage close by in case it doesn't?

No behaviour change."

I probably wouldn't try to give him anymore raisins than that in a week though."
chinchilla,2wdekj,prof_chaos86,1 point,Thu Feb 19 21:33:36 2015 UTC,"Please don't waste time in looking for a solution on forums.  Take your chinchilla to a reputable veterinarian for exotic animals. Google vets close to you and call each location and ask if they've had experience with chinchillas. He might have a blockage/stasis, an experienced vet will tell you."
chinchilla,2wc9mr,sporks_,9,Wed Feb 18 19:02:55 2015 UTC,"If you haven't asked, try and find out how they got him. If it was from Petsmart it will give you a heads up as to whether or not there may be medical problems in 8 years. Other than that I see Mazuri pellets, an appropriately sized wheel (although plastic but it looks unchewed) and a decent cage with flat areas and a well-dusted chin. They seem to have taken good care of him."

chinchilla,2wc9mr,djh3315,1 point,Wed Feb 18 20:00:47 2015 UTC,"A note on the wheel chinchillas are actually recommended to have over a 12 inch wheel. There is a company that recently advertised on reddit for a real chinchilla wheel. Very often these wheels arent a problem because once the chinchilla's back starts to get sore it gets off (still bad over time) but in high stress situations they use the wheel to blow off steam, this may cause them to get on for longer periods which can cause some spinal problems! Heres a link to the other wheel (its actually quite nice and not that expensive compared to store bought wheels) https://www.etsy.com/listing/206046055/the-upgraded-quiet-chillawheel-large?ref=listing-shop-header-1"
chinchilla,2wc9mr,nmmtns,2,Thu Feb 19 13:45:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other poster's advice. Another thing to check for is matted fur around one or both eyes. Runny eyes are sometimes a sign that the chin is developing malocclusion (teeth problems that can become very serious over time).  There might be other causes for eye issues, and even malocclusion might not stop you from adopting him/giving him a good life... but something to be aware of!"

Is it patchy in places or does he have some chunks of fur that are pulling out? Also, the green poops, just wondering have they gotten wet at all? Sometimes if my chin's poops or food pellets absorb water they look lighter in color and crumble. But if those are truly his poops the way they come out of him, then I would take him to a vet as soon as you can, and bring some of the different samples of poop with you to show the vet."

Like I said though, I already had an appointment...just wanted second opinions I guess.

chinchilla,2vs7dl,PrincessCerberus,0,Fri Feb 13 17:16:22 2015 UTC,I use the care fresh bedding and have for 7-8 years now.    I would avoid the pine or cedar bedding because they give off an aroma that some believe to be harmful to the sensitive chins.    Edit: so i guess I'm wrong
chinchilla,2vs7dl,xman813,1 point,Fri Feb 13 17:30:44 2015 UTC,Is it kiln dried? Has he stopped eating it after a few days? Why not use fleece?

And I'm going away, probably not the best timing but I kept noticing that the CareFresh was getting into his food dish and the thought of impaction was awful. The pine does have a smell but it's not strong, just woody. He keeps chewing it but I'm hoping it stops soon."
chinchilla,2vs7dl,_ataraxia,2,Fri Feb 13 17:49:04 2015 UTC,"if you want to use wood shavings, go with aspen."
chinchilla,2vs7dl,reemzies,1 point,Fri Feb 13 17:58:58 2015 UTC,"Does he eat/chew the Carefresh? I've used it for my chin for years and she does nibble it a teeny bit each time I change it (because maybe it's something new and delicious this time???) and after that leaves it alone. I've always heard that pine bedding wasn't good for chins, but now that I'm googling it seems like there are mixed opinions on that. Either way, I think if he is only chewing a little bit on the CareFresh and not actually eating large amounts of it he'd be fine with that."

chinchilla,2vpu8x,Jennnergy,4,Fri Feb 13 01:29:33 2015 UTC,i have one of those folding playpen fences that i place around my girls' cages. i absolutely love this setup and would recommend it to anyone who has chins or other rodents. the pen makes it easy to ensure a chin-proof play area. setting it up around the cages means i can just open their doors and let them come in and out as they please.
chinchilla,2vpu8x,_ataraxia,1 point,Fri Feb 13 01:41:39 2015 UTC,"How tall is it? I feel like he would just jump out. My cage is up on a shelf, so I couldn't do what you do even though I like the idea. But I could still use the fence. And what is it made of?"

Large Appliance Boxes: Dimensions sizes vary but each box side measure 26"" x 68"" to more squarish 36""x 24"", total # 8.  Pros:    to be used similar to folding pens utilizing the boxes folds to collapse/open for setup/storage. cardboard relatively safe if chewed, though mine rarely bother inexpensive, lightweight, and safe for environment disposal  when properly secured can be effective, no gaps for sneaky squeeze through and reduces living space(floor moldings, furniture, etc) chewing   Con:    cumbersome to store and setup in limited living space  requires attention to any staples, sticker labels, and transparent packing tape not the most prettiest   Blankets : Experimentation is required as I've researched that some chinchillas will chew while other don't. Luckily mine do not chew blankets. Great for covering odd spaces or objects. I'm not an expert on blanket materials, so what material is ideal I'm afraid I can't specifically answer.  Pros:    Inexpensive as 2nd hand stores are good spot to shop easy to store and setup within play area if required can be washed. Worse case, disposal is easy   Cons:   depending on material, 'lint fuzzies' may be consumed. Attention to condition and material is important. any present tags, made of plastic, require removal the fabric can hold debris/dirt depending on placement and collect chinchilla dust resulting in a dirty blanket needing washing.

chinchilla,2vg73p,Skrilmaufive,1 point,Tue Feb 10 19:43:07 2015 UTC,"From my experience when a bonding pair can have supervised play time and pass each other without any aggression for about two weeks, I would try housing them together.  The first day I would scrub down the cage, replace fleece or pine shavings, and introduce a few new toys. I recommend that the first day when they're in the cage together that it would be supervised as well. Try doing it on a weekend.  There are other ways of bonding chins besides the cage by cage method. Try rotating them in each others cages for an hour or two just to get each other use to their scents. Put chin 1 in chin 2's cage and vice versa.   I've had chins for 6 years, bonded two pairs, and currently have 8 chins ranging from 1 year to 6 years."
chinchilla,2vg73p,prof_chaos86,2,Wed Feb 11 00:43:45 2015 UTC,"We have two female chins, which have lived in cages next to each other for about a year now. We would really love to house them together, but they just don't seem to want to get along..  We have tried introducing them to each other a few separate times, but each time the same thing happens. They run around away from each other for a bit and are fine.   Then one of them takes interest in the other and an all out brawl starts. Lots of chatter and fur slipping, and they get into a 'ball' where it seems like they are biting at each other. We never let it go on for too long so I have no idea if they will actually hurt each other, but to us it looks like they are.   Sometimes, they even 'fight' through their cages, meaning they make some squeaking noises and jump back and forth on the sides of their cages that are closest to one another.   Do you have any advice on how we could safely start getting the two used to each other?"
chinchilla,2vg73p,tdashroy,1 point,Fri Feb 13 01:58:40 2015 UTC,"Where do you guys usually have these introductions? It really sounds like a dominance/territorial issue. Try having playtime in a neutral space that neither chin is accustom to. Try integrating a new toy into their playtime as well. If that doesn't seem to be working try and figure out which female chin is the aggressor.   You can clip the aggressors whiskers about an inch. It causes no harm to the chin if done right. People call this a chinchilla burrito. It's a two person job and you have to wrap a small hand towel around their bodies. Snug but not too tight. Have one person snip her whiskers while the other person is gently holding her. After this try another introduction in a day or two. Have patience and continue to repeat these steps.   If there are any more interactions that causes fur slipping or anything that you would deem dangerous, separate them immediately. Having them supervised in a controlled environment is crucial because chinchillas can and will kill each other.   If this continues there may be a chance that these chins just won't ever get along. Each chin has a different personality and unfortunately you might have two chins who just won't tolerate being in the same cage together. Be patient, alert, and enjoy your time with your little furballs."

We do realize the running surface is a bit narrow and it can take chins a bit to learn how to run on it. We have been trying to create a third wheel that is wider, but it's proven difficult to find something 14-16"" in diameter that isn't significantly more expensive. Our whole goal as HappyChilla is to provide a chinchilla-safe and affordable alternative to other wheels, so raising prices does not work for us.  We'll likely create a better running surface ourselves closer to summer, but for now time constraints limit us. We're also still concerned about being able to maintain a lower cost and ultimately price for the final product when that time comes."

chinchilla,2v9tz4,Skrilmaufive,3,Mon Feb 9 16:14:55 2015 UTC,"HappyChilla here. :)  We have a huge difference in noise level between the two because they use different bearings.  The original can get to be about as loud as a dryer or dishwaher. If you or anyone is a light sleeper, this won't be a good option.  The upgraded we were able to make significantly quieter, but it costs a little more and takes more time to make. I've found that majority of the bit of noise it makes comes from the cage rather than the wheel."

chinchilla,2v70sv,alipierre16,1 point,Sun Feb 8 14:55:44 2015 UTC,Yes! Mine does that when he wants a cheerio.
chinchilla,2v70sv,mello999,1 point,Sat Feb 21 01:36:34 2015 UTC,"Oh good! I was really hoping it was a begging trick and not a sad ""please let me out"" behavior."
chinchilla,2v6lt6,Dalisca,3,Sun Feb 8 10:51:09 2015 UTC,"My last girl liked to play ""tag"". She would bounce up to us, and then skitter away after a pet, over and over.   Current girl likes to run around carrying anything she can grab, the bigger,  the better."
chinchilla,2v6lt6,HappyChilla05,3,Sun Feb 8 19:08:54 2015 UTC,I've trained our little fuzzball to spin in circles for a sunflower seed. Makes me smile every time :)
chinchilla,2v6lt6,KungFuPup,1 point,Mon Feb 9 07:44:03 2015 UTC,"That sounds great!  We inadvertently trained ours to roll over for treats. I'm an overprotective mom, though, so I decided we should stop reinforcing the rolls in case it hurt her back. Now we make her walk for treats.   Spinning in circles seems like a comfortable middle ground ;). Thanks for the idea!"
chinchilla,2v6lt6,DeathHaze420,5,Sun Feb 15 10:52:07 2015 UTC,"Ours love to play games at our expense.  They love the following:   Can I eat this?  Can I fit in there? What do you have in that cup/bowl? (This usually then becomes a game of ""Can I eat it?"") Look how fast I can run! Give the humans a heart attack by almost falling off a ledge but miraculously making it and act like nothing happened. How many times can I kick off the same spot on the human's leg until they yelp? And their absolute favourite, The Great Escape!   One of them also loves to have staring competitions with us.  They're very funny but they do seem to love to do things they shouldn't be doing."
chinchilla,2v6lt6,KungFuPup,6,Mon Feb 9 09:02:15 2015 UTC,"I love the way chinchillas will screw up and miss a jump or almost fall and then look at you like ""I meant to do that"" then wipe their nose and try it again."
chinchilla,2v6lt6,DeathHaze420,5,Mon Feb 9 14:28:53 2015 UTC,"Haha mine do the nose wipe too. I know in their little fuzzy head they're probably thinking ""be cool. Pretend that was meant to happen. Maybe no one noticed""."
chinchilla,2v1o7s,whatsername121,3,Sat Feb 7 01:01:54 2015 UTC,I imagine him humming super spy music as he does this.

chinchilla,2v1pqo,PrincessCerberus,3,Sat Feb 7 01:17:02 2015 UTC,you can buy oxbow online [i usually buy mine on amazon] if your local pet stores don't carry it.
chinchilla,2v1pqo,_ataraxia,3,Sat Feb 7 01:26:44 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your new chinchilla! I honestly don't know much about Bonanza, but we've always fed Oxbow because most of the info I've read online seems to agree that Oxbow or Mazuri is the way to go. You can probably look up the ingredients and compare them all.  The ceramic bowl was a good call. You don't want anything plastic in the cage, because it can be very dangerous if he chews on it and ingests enough of it.  In general, chinchilla supplies are much cheaper online, with a better selection. Prices vary, so we just use Google Shopping to compare across sites when we need to stock up on food, hay, etc.  A fantastic resource on chinchillas is www.chins-n-hedgies.com. The message boards are full of really great information and advice."
chinchilla,2v1pqo,nmmtns,2,Sat Feb 7 04:43:56 2015 UTC,"The lady I bought him from had initially just given him hamster food full of nuts and dried corn   Yikes. Definitely not good. I don't know about Bonanza-- it looks like it has a bunch of junk in it. Ideally chins should just eat pellets and timothy hay. I would try to find Oxbow and another option is Mazuri. The other thing is that even though his current food sucks, it's best to wean him off by mixing the new food in with the old, a little at first then more and more. Changing all of a sudden could be a shock to his system"
chinchilla,2v1pqo,dripless_cactus,1 point,Sat Feb 7 07:28:56 2015 UTC,"I did that with bonanza and his old food! I still mix a little of the hamster food too, but very little! I contacted the pet store in town and they were able to order Oxbow in for me! Thanks, though! Means a lot. :)"
chinchilla,2v1pqo,thebatwhisperer,1 point,Tue Feb 10 18:04:31 2015 UTC,I go to my local feed store! They have oxbow and other brands. But the food and hay are much cheaper!! And you don't have to wait for it to ship to you!
chinchilla,2uvbt6,SpizicusRex,7,Thu Feb 5 13:47:23 2015 UTC,"Why does your barking Vietnamese dinner cost $1,000?"
chinchilla,2uvbt6,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,7,Thu Feb 5 17:47:09 2015 UTC,hahahaha i just laughed so hard
chinchilla,2uvbt6,hydrangea_,32,Thu Feb 5 15:59:13 2015 UTC,No but they do crap all the time. They are crap machines.
chinchilla,2uvbt6,JedenTag,11,Thu Feb 5 14:11:55 2015 UTC,I would have little pieces of gold EVERYWHERE.
chinchilla,2uvbt6,tuhraycee,11,Thu Feb 5 16:31:09 2015 UTC,Wanna see some super cool ones go for thousands of dollars? Chinchillas.com
chinchilla,2uvbt6,ShyLilah,4,Thu Feb 5 15:09:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know why I'm shocked, you told me exactly what to expect..."
chinchilla,2uvbt6,msktty89,5,Thu Feb 5 19:03:53 2015 UTC,I have mixed feelings about that site...but I'm all for diversifying gene pools so I guess it's a good thing.
chinchilla,2uvbt6,monster_bunny,9,Thu Feb 5 20:06:46 2015 UTC,It's for the extra floof
chinchilla,2uvbt6,whatsername121,10,Thu Feb 5 15:54:24 2015 UTC,They clean themselves in gold dust and a small supply comes with the little fuzzbutts.
chinchilla,2uvbt6,Fora_Fauna,8,Thu Feb 5 18:22:16 2015 UTC,Get one from a rescue! Way cheaper and you save a life! I got my first one free and my second for only $75 at a rescue.   Also if they crapped gold we owners would be billionaires.
chinchilla,2uvbt6,paspasero,4,Thu Feb 5 18:56:29 2015 UTC,"I thought it was really funny when I first went on Craigslist and saw people selling standard greys for 500 dollars because it was a rare color. I got my chinchillas via rescue (helped take some off peoples' hands) for free and they're the most amazing animals I've ever had.  If you want a rare breed/show animal, just like with any other species, they're gonna be uber expensive. But otherwise, you shouldn't pay any more than 200USD for a healthy animal meant as a pet."
chinchilla,2uvbt6,AsteriaRose,2,Thu Feb 5 22:37:58 2015 UTC,Our local shelter for some reason sells chins with rare colors for half the price :D
chinchilla,2uvbt6,Cebelica,2,Fri Feb 6 02:13:12 2015 UTC,"It seems like a lot, but the cost of the chinchilla is really just an initial investment. They cost very little to maintain so long as you keep them healthy."
chinchilla,2uvbt6,getstonedplaygames,1 point,Fri Feb 6 07:50:17 2015 UTC,I think investment is the wrong word. Chinchillas lose like 90% of their value as soon as you leave the pet shop.
chinchilla,2uvbt6,JedenTag,3,Sat Feb 7 22:07:35 2015 UTC,Sounds like you are looking in the wrong places. I wouldn't pay more than $200 for one. A good breeder or rescue will be $125 or less
chinchilla,2uvbt6,sdyawg,1 point,Fri Feb 6 13:21:24 2015 UTC,$500 is rather steep for a chinchilla.
chinchilla,2uvbt6,Dalisca,1 point,Sat Feb 7 03:56:13 2015 UTC,Where dò chinchillas cost this much? My first standard was 50 bucks and my dark ebony from a family of show winners was 90. And thats in canadian dollars.
chinchilla,2uvbt6,DPleskin,1 point,Fri Mar 20 14:29:34 2015 UTC,places like petco and petsmart seem to have agreed on the $500 tag here in the south.
chinchilla,2urq8y,AdobeTheChinchilla,2,Wed Feb 4 16:57:03 2015 UTC,I get the cardboard paper rolls and make a tower out of em and let them knock those down.   They seem to enjoy playing Godzilla.

chinchilla,2uqnmn,KungFuPup,6,Wed Feb 4 09:29:38 2015 UTC,She was in a little bit of a sulk with this morning as she wanted to come out and play and I wouldn't let her.  She likes to think every time is play time.
chinchilla,2uqnmn,mcslootysloot,2,Wed Feb 4 09:30:17 2015 UTC,Awwwww pretty coloring and huge ears!!!! <3
chinchilla,2uqnmn,Nezhka,1 point,Wed Feb 4 23:26:24 2015 UTC,Hehe thanks. She's also got huge whiskers to match the ears.
chinchilla,2uoee6,illTakeCreddit,1 point,Tue Feb 3 20:55:36 2015 UTC,Mind if I ask what type of wood you are using and how you are securing it to the cage?
chinchilla,2uoee6,DeathHaze420,5,Tue Feb 3 21:06:55 2015 UTC,"Sure! I use kiln dried pine (if you haven't already - def research types of wood, some are poisonous to Chinchillas - and also certain places like Home Depot often mix Spruce, Pine and Fir in their lumber, Spruce is a big no-no, so you gotta watch)  The base is just regular lumber planks and for the guards I used molding.   I used hanger bolts (screw on one side, bolt on the other) to screw into the wood, leaving the bolt exposed, so it attaches to the cage like any of the ledges I've ever bought, with washers and wingnuts!   Here is a picture without the guards where you can see the bolts: http://i.imgur.com/DaIaNcZ.jpg"
chinchilla,2uoee6,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,2,Tue Feb 3 21:23:16 2015 UTC,Blue eyes? What a looker!
chinchilla,2uoee6,AdobeTheChinchilla,2,Tue Feb 3 23:56:54 2015 UTC,"Haha, I think that was just because I was using the flash for the ledge and he jumped in the way. I WISH his eyes always looked like that!"
chinchilla,2uoee6,trudith,1 point,Wed Feb 4 15:54:16 2015 UTC,These look awesome! I need to create wooden shelves to replace the plastic ones I currently have. How do you clean the wooden ones?
chinchilla,2ul3q3,AdobeTheChinchilla,3,Tue Feb 3 01:32:24 2015 UTC,Aw what a cutie! I love his little face!
chinchilla,2ul3q3,susubgugu,2,Tue Feb 3 02:35:00 2015 UTC,So what does Adobe get at Starbucks?
chinchilla,2ul3q3,RyderHiME,3,Tue Feb 3 05:51:26 2015 UTC,"oooh man, keep this up and Adobe may become my favorite internet-chin"
chinchilla,2ul3q3,sdyawg,3,Tue Feb 3 08:34:46 2015 UTC,Haha he has over 1300 Instagram followers in a week.
chinchilla,2ul3q3,DeathHaze420,2,Tue Feb 3 16:49:32 2015 UTC,"How come Adobe on it's own I've never considered a cute name. Give that name to a chinchilla and all of a sudden it seems like a really fitting, cute name."
chinchilla,2ul3q3,allycatraz,8,Tue Feb 3 11:28:48 2015 UTC,"""I'll take a no-foam Timothy hay latte, please."""
chinchilla,2ulpyn,Kiangel,6,Tue Feb 3 04:37:14 2015 UTC,"No, that's just going to be more stress. He's going to be a hard case, my suggestion is cover the cage, keep the room dark, turn a radio on low on something relaxing. That way he only has to process one new thing, smell,then next day, turn off the radio, then next day, remove the cover a bit at a time . takes about a week+ but it works wonders."
chinchilla,2ulpyn,ShyLilah,1 point,Tue Feb 3 18:21:56 2015 UTC,"Also hay, lots of hay."
chinchilla,2ulpyn,ShyLilah,2,Tue Feb 3 18:31:35 2015 UTC,"As /u/ShyLilah said, cover the cage, put on some soft music and keep everything dark and quiet. I don't think you need to remove that stuff over time, I leave the fleece liners on my cage so my chin can sleep. If you have time, sit next to him for an hour or two each day (do homework or something), and just gently talk to him. If he starts to come up to the cage to be near you, just keep doing what you're doing (keep sudden movements to a minimum). Eventually once he seems comfortable with you, start giving him treats/belly rubs through the bars until he's back to normal.  Even though it may be stressful for him, if he really starts freaking out or his eating and pooping habits don't stabilize, I would take him to the vet for a checkup to ensure that it's not a physical issue. Mental issues are another deal entirely, and is up to you to figure out, but I'm sure you'll be alright, just give him time, love and care."
chinchilla,2uif7y,jadealwayswins,2,Mon Feb 2 12:46:59 2015 UTC,My best suggestion would be to ask the people over at www.chins-n-hedgies.com; they have a lot of active users and are probably the better place to ask for breeder recommendations.

Smokey....well Smokey has essentially ADD and doesnt hold still for anything....so he's a bit more of a pain in rear."
