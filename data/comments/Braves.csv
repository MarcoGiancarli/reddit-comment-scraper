Braves,3e5fog,excrulon,3,Wed Jul 22 02:44:43 2015 UTC,Great game besides having a girl in the row in front of us who literally did not stop talking all game.  It's so weird how JJ is either lights out or really struggles like last appearance. His performance was ridiculous tonight! I much prefer a groundball pitcher over a flyball pitcher for a closer given a good defense is behind them. Too nervous when every hit looks like a home run.  Time to finish off with a sweep of the Dodgers and then put the Cardinals in their place!

Perhaps he would have had more of a chance to show if he had anything this year if he didn't get injured."

Not Hart's fault that he's hard to get rid of. Don't want to have to give up anyone just for someone else to take Chris.   I wish he stayed quiet because I kind of liked having him vs left handers.

Braves,3e0kkx,Dirty_Mike_n_da_Boyz,2,Tue Jul 21 01:49:16 2015 UTC,I'm hopeful we'll be able to move him.  The hangup is the '17 salary at 9 mil (and '18 team option with 1mil buyout) which I bet we're trying to not pay a cent of.  We may have to pay all of his '16 salary (7.5 mil) and/or take on another bad contract.  But I think the Mets may be desperate enough to do that soon if they see that Wright won't be able to help them this season.
Braves,3e0kkx,g-burn,3,Tue Jul 21 15:47:47 2015 UTC,Because he's 30 and not 22 and his name isn't Bryce Harper so Simpson doesn't care

Chris would have been an idiot to turn it down. Not to mention how he wasn't entirely awful by career number standards and mostly above average besides just the career year. Still a bad contract  Besides by all accounts he has been one of Freddie's buddies since getting here."

Braves,3e0kkx,obiwans_lightsaber,9,Tue Jul 21 05:08:59 2015 UTC,Sucks to suck Chris.
Braves,3e0kkx,hickmatt,5,Tue Jul 21 01:59:57 2015 UTC,That should be pretty obvious by now. Chris is basically saying that the Braves should be playing him more because he had one good offensive season? He probably should've kept his mouth shut.
Braves,3e0kkx,obiwans_lightsaber,4,Tue Jul 21 01:06:01 2015 UTC,Reminds of the players in League of Legends that play like ass then ask to surrender at 20.
Braves,3e0kkx,violatedchimp,17,Tue Jul 21 09:59:56 2015 UTC,"I realize I'm going to get crucified for this, but it's my opinion.  I honestly feel like the Braves, in the end, wronged Chris.  Did Wren sign him to way too pricey of a contract? You bet.  Did he have some anger/rage issues last season? Well documented.  But the guy has done pretty much everything that was asked of him, had a great first season with the Braves, and was not awful last season like so many people continue to claim.  Since when is hitting .263, 10HR, 150+ hits so atrocious?  He seemed sincere in his admission to the hissy fits in the tunnel/dugouts and has tried to right that ship.  No, his defense was never top notch, but it's not like we're in a pennant race right now anyway.  He has (reportedly) made strides to being a better teammate and clubhouse presence overall.  I realize Uribe is a defensive upgrade, but what did we really accomplish by trading for him?  Doesn't seem like he'll re-sign with Atlanta at the season's end anyway; by pulling that trade trigger, the Braves completely alienated Chris and made it known he was no longer wanted.  What major piece to all of this am I missing?  Why do I feel like the only Braves fan who feels this way?  Serious question, I'd love to know.  edit: grammar and shit"
Braves,3e0kkx,Professr_Chaos,7,Tue Jul 21 05:11:45 2015 UTC,"He was -1.5WAR last year.  His offense was mediocre, and his defense is plain awful.  His attitude brings the clubhouse down.    I'm not disagreeing with your other points - just bringing out you saying he wasn't THAT bad last year.  He was awful last year."
Braves,3e0kkx,Lexicon24,10,Tue Jul 21 05:50:37 2015 UTC,"WAR is simultaneously the best and worst ""stat"" to ever become mainstream."
Braves,3e0kkx,ReeceChops44,9,Tue Jul 21 05:54:06 2015 UTC,"It's so low because he plays a corner infield spot.  3B's are expected to produce offensively, not be a singles hitter who doesn't walk doesn't hit for power, and can barely keep his average over .250.  Combine that with bad defense, and the WAR is very indicative of his value.  He's a one tool player who isn't even doing his one tool well.  He blows."
Braves,3e0kkx,obiwans_lightsaber,2,Tue Jul 21 07:32:56 2015 UTC,"He also had a .289 wOBA, an 82 wRC+, a sub 4% BB%, and had the 21st lowest ISO in baseball among qualified hitters. His power is fringe average, never topping 15 HRs, and he has only topped 30 doubles once(I will give you 1 guess when that was). He is essentially a guy that strings enough singles together to make his average look respectable to half-witted fans.  He has 1 good skill and that is his inexplicable ability to maintain an above average BABIP. I am not saying he is lucky because he at this point has shown a knack for it but even as we stand right now his BABIP this year is .342. HE IS STILL HITTING .241 DESPITE THAT! Last year it was .345 and again he managed to hit a slightly more respectable .263(but with a BABIP that high you want either a higher average(due to increased walks, his career walk rate is 4.7%) or some power to come of that his career ISO is .134(which is below the average of .150)).  In a classic mindset Chris Johnson is an okay player. In today's version of baseball of analytics and everything he is worse than worthless. He actually hurts the team he plays for more than helps."
Braves,3e0kkx,BG1234567,0,Tue Jul 21 17:20:44 2015 UTC,Maybe the worst stat for players like Chris Johnson who have an awful WAR. Best for us fans.
Braves,3e0kkx,jdub1418,2,Tue Jul 21 06:34:00 2015 UTC,"Even if his stats don't look that bad, he's still a strikeout machine. A change in philosophy was made, and Chris didn't fit the mold. He would have been gone long before now had anyone wanted him"

Safe to say that his hitting suffered because of those around him. I think we need to kick the tires on him and see if we can get another .300/10+HR year out of him."
Braves,3e0kkx,Snowmittromney,4,Tue Jul 21 13:09:33 2015 UTC,"He just acts like he doesnt care, thats what bothers me more than anything. Most of the guys on this team try so hard, and hes over there jogging around"

So that when he gets inducted to the hall of fame 30 years from now (hopefully as a brave ) I have authentication showing the signature is from his rookie year?

Didn't realize he was the starter tonight.  I am skeptical about second TJs holding long though. Its not unprecedented for them to last and I wish him the best when hes not facing the braves.

Braves,3dwusp,ShongoMcForren,5,Mon Jul 20 12:22:30 2015 UTC,"And at least they don't have to face Greinke because he owned the Nationals yesterday?   It seems like almost the entire line-up is slumping and the loss of Freddie catching up to them more. The sad irony that the offense took a nosedive as soon as they headed into Coors.   Jace has been slumping for awhile, but had 2 doubles in the series. Also had 5 strikeouts. He wasn't alone in the series though, and the Cubs pitching can take some responsibility for that.   Simmons also slumping for awhile had two 1 for 3 games, a double, 3 walks.   Wish they were facing a worse team than the Dodgers right now."

Braves,3dwusp,stuffandotherstuff,3,Tue Jul 21 00:50:49 2015 UTC,CJ apparently demands trade.
Braves,3dwusp,EastGATone,3,Tue Jul 21 00:53:38 2015 UTC,We also demand CJ's trade

Braves,3dwusp,THAT_GIRL16,4,Tue Jul 21 01:11:31 2015 UTC,I call foul play. Callaspo was about to hit a 450 ft home run before the rain happened. You guys are cheating.
Braves,3dwusp,LickMyMeatus,3,Tue Jul 21 01:26:39 2015 UTC,There's the Terdopower we were looking for.
Braves,3dwusp,chosenxone,3,Tue Jul 21 01:33:09 2015 UTC,CJ is on deck which means he'll hit a fly ball straight back and foul out of the stadium resulting in a loss of 4 runs.
Braves,3dwusp,Xeno4494,3,Tue Jul 21 01:35:48 2015 UTC,I love listening to the Dodgers announcers' being upset about Gonzo being slow as fuck.

Braves,3dwusp,SG8970,3,Tue Jul 21 01:57:28 2015 UTC,ESPN needs to get their shit together.  Apparently it is the bottom of the 8th with four outs.

Braves,3dwusp,daeys,2,Mon Jul 20 20:35:24 2015 UTC,"Replace ""Freeman"" and all pronouns with Freddie/Fredi and make this confusing to read.   Fredi says Seitzer and Castro told Fredi Feddie ""hasn't missed a beat"" after swinging today. Fredi says Freddie said ""Freddie felt great"""

Braves,3dwusp,THAT_GIRL16,2,Mon Jul 20 21:55:06 2015 UTC,Go Braves
Braves,3dwusp,ReeceChops44,2,Mon Jul 20 22:35:15 2015 UTC,How close has Markakis been to going long? I feel like as soon as he gets one it will unlock some secret stash of power and he will just go yard all the time.
Braves,3dwusp,ReeceChops44,2,Mon Jul 20 23:10:16 2015 UTC,Law of averages?

Braves,3dwusp,thekidfromyesterday,2,Mon Jul 20 23:26:43 2015 UTC,I just thought about Mike Minor. Whatever happened to him? He won his arbitration then haven't really heard anything since
Braves,3dwusp,LickMyMeatus,3,Mon Jul 20 23:37:25 2015 UTC,Out for the season. Likely to be non-tendered at the end of the year.

Braves,3dwusp,EastGATone,2,Mon Jul 20 23:39:43 2015 UTC,Puig almost killed him.
Braves,3dwusp,THAT_GIRL16,2,Mon Jul 20 23:54:52 2015 UTC,Shh... the Owner of the team defended him last week so he can do no wrong. Or at least be held accountable
Braves,3dwusp,praeceps93,2,Mon Jul 20 23:58:45 2015 UTC,Could the leprechaun stop getting on base?
Braves,3dwusp,EastGATone,2,Tue Jul 21 00:04:07 2015 UTC,"Threw on an old Francoeur shirsey on after my shower, didn't think much of it...but we're winning and Neck hit a bomb. New gametime shirt?"
Braves,3dwusp,chart589,2,Tue Jul 21 00:04:18 2015 UTC,Does Uggla get sent an invite to the alumni weekend stuff? Or not since he is still on the payroll? Just nightmare thoughts

Braves,3dwusp,EastGATone,2,Tue Jul 21 00:18:50 2015 UTC,hell yeah!
Braves,3dwusp,ZachYorkMorgan,2,Tue Jul 21 00:24:49 2015 UTC,Simmons looked like he wanted to rip in to Perez after that shit
Braves,3dvgf4,Uterus_Assassination,3,Sun Jul 19 21:25:46 2015 UTC,Beautiful yes. But that sun was miserable sitting in the outfield
Braves,3dvgf4,Sidesicle,2,Mon Jul 20 01:29:38 2015 UTC,A buddy of mine was sitting in the 230 section. The sun was killing them and they ended up upgrading to 102 right below me

Braves,3dutdv,ReeceChops44,2,Sun Jul 19 22:06:46 2015 UTC,I'd rather see him on Sportscenter highlights then playing against us multiple times a year in the NL.
Braves,3dutdv,r2tbone,15,Sun Jul 19 23:55:46 2015 UTC,I'd take Craig going to the Yanks over the Nats in a heartbeat.
Braves,3dutdv,Twistify804,10,Sun Jul 19 18:48:53 2015 UTC,You bite your tongue!!!  How dare you speak of such horror.
Braves,3dutdv,leg_room,3,Sun Jul 19 20:02:55 2015 UTC,I saw it in a Jon Morosi article and thought that would be the worst possible scenario.
Braves,3dutdv,Twistify804,3,Sun Jul 19 23:01:28 2015 UTC,You shut your mouth when you are talking to me!!
Braves,3dutdv,drrhythm2,7,Mon Jul 20 12:09:02 2015 UTC,The thought of Kimbrel throwing to McCann makes me want to cry. Unless they are back in their original form.

Braves,3dutdv,ArchEast,4,Sun Jul 19 18:53:06 2015 UTC,It'd make more sense. I mean the Yanks have been buying all the star players for a long time now. Wont be the last time.
Braves,3dutdv,humma__kavula,9,Sun Jul 19 22:12:26 2015 UTC,Disappointing but expected. They'll also grab Bryce soon. Money talks.
Braves,3dutdv,dfscha1402,17,Sun Jul 19 20:13:02 2015 UTC,I have no issues whatsoever with Bryce ending up in pinstripes
Braves,3dutdv,Dat_Foig,12,Sun Jul 19 22:11:52 2015 UTC,It feels right.

Braves,3dutdv,mdbrockman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:26:57 2015 UTC,Bryce has literally said he wants to be in pinstripes. I don't think it will take much for him to go there.
Braves,3dutdv,Itypedthesewords,3,Mon Jul 20 06:23:01 2015 UTC,Are they still potential trade partners if we end up moving Peraza?
Braves,3dutdv,leg_room,7,Sun Jul 19 18:41:03 2015 UTC,Who?  I think the Padres might be tired of trading with us for a while.  It's not exactly working out for them.  In fact if I owned the Padres and the GM made another deal with the Braves I'd fire his ass.  I suppose the Yankees are a possibility.

I understand the whole ""relievers are fluky"" thing, but for now he looks like a legit option for them. At least some of the other moves they've made by throwing money at people have made some sense/addressed some weakness. Also I would hate it, so can it not happen pls?"
Braves,3dwl06,JaneEyreForce,3,Mon Jul 20 03:22:29 2015 UTC,I might! I'll get in touch after Tuesday.

Braves,3dutr9,TweetPoster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:14:36 2015 UTC,"This kid has me really excited. A lot of recent hype has surrounded all the prospects we've recently acquired, but I think this guy has a chance to be the best major leaguers out of all of them. Sky is the limit for him if he stays healthy."
Braves,3dutr9,nattyice2,2,Sun Jul 19 18:34:53 2015 UTC,"He hasn't performed great but he just turned 21 a few days ago and obviously has a lot of talent, since he's consistently ranked among our top five prospects or so. May as well move him up and see what he can do. Time to fish or cut bait.  EDIT: He's also been a consensus top 100 prospect the last two years, at least pre-season. He may fall off that radar pre-2016 if he doesn't step it up, but he must have some raw tools to justify those rankings. May just be having a hard time with consistency or nagging injury issues. Probably still has some physical maturation left too."
Braves,3dutr9,drrhythm2,2,Mon Jul 20 14:21:08 2015 UTC,"I'm on the opposite end of the spectrum with this kid.  There's really no way to sugarcoat these numbers: http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=sims--001luc  I hope I'm wrong obviously, but I'm not hopeful on him panning out."
Braves,3dutr9,leg_room,2,Sun Jul 19 20:01:52 2015 UTC,"yeah i'm with you. nothing about him screams amazing to me. in my opinion the very best scenario is that he becomes a solid back of the rotation starter, which of course would be amazing. that's just not what i have in mind for touki, wisler, or fried."
Braves,3dutr9,dibzim,-1,Sun Jul 19 20:12:46 2015 UTC,I'd ship him to the yanks with Peraza in exchange for Aaron judge

Braves,3dutr9,praeceps93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:54:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's impossible as a one to one swap because Judge is valued much higher, and I'm not sure what we would attach to make it work. But as for the Judge hype, he's just a beast of a person, 6'7"" and a cannon arm that could play anywhere in the outfield, or possibly 3B if need be. It also insures as at the power hitter spot in the lineup, because as much as I like Braxton Davidson (hit a HR off my friend in state playoffs), he's a few years off and less of a sure thing. Judge can just murder baseballs, and if he pans out he could fill a needed spot for us for years to come. I want Peraza moved because I see him as a utility man that we could use to get a high level everyday player."
Braves,3dutr9,Itypedthesewords,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:24 2015 UTC,"We'd probably have to add in a high upside arm to get them to pick up the phone, looking at their projections. Could be interesting though. If we call up Peraza and he impresses, could open the door."
Braves,3dutr9,praeceps93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:20:30 2015 UTC,"Very true. Both are projected as 2016 regulars, so if we could showcase Peraza during expanded rosters and move him this winter I'd be happy."
Braves,3dvqt7,ReeceChops44,3,Sun Jul 19 22:53:36 2015 UTC,I plan on showing up around 4/4:15 but that just so I can catch BP. You would probably be safe with 6.
Braves,3dvqt7,Thybrantalope,2,Sun Jul 19 23:12:54 2015 UTC,The only promotional item I missed was a bobblehead that I had to wait on my sister to get off of work. We showed up at the gates around 7:30 for a 7:15 game and they were gone.  I've arrived as late as 6:30 or 6:45 and still managed to pick up whatever they were handing out. They usually hand out 20K or so and Atlanta's average announced attendance this year is 25K.

I don't think there's a situation where enough money and/or player compensation wouldn't make a team trade someone.  Question is who would reasonably give up enough to make it worthwhile?  Probably no one."

You can obviously see potential in the bat still and even as he is developing now, I don't mind a No. 8 hitter batting .250 with an obp over .300. I think the disappointment with Simmons right now is that his bat seems to have the capability to give us .300/.350/.425 but he is just so inconsistent."

Braves,3dtwdb,PickShark,9,Sun Jul 19 14:13:25 2015 UTC,True. Uggla wasn't all terrible. BJ was bad from day 1.

Braves,3dtwdb,suddenlyissoon,7,Sun Jul 19 12:53:55 2015 UTC,"What? Apparently no one had bothered to look at his stats as a Brave. He wasn't bad at all. 35 -24 record, around a 4 era."
Braves,3dtwdb,justsomeregulardude,5,Sun Jul 19 14:18:08 2015 UTC,He was passable while he wasn't injured.
Braves,3dtwdb,mycrystalcity,5,Sun Jul 19 14:29:48 2015 UTC,Dude was getting old when he got here. Then had two solid seasons. Got hurt. Kept getting hurt. Than had a bad season when he finally got back. 80% of people we're listing are due to recency bias.  I'd hazard a guess there are some guys from the 80s who are far worse than anyone we're listing. Or pre Atlanta braves.
Braves,3dtwdb,PickShark,3,Sun Jul 19 14:57:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. I liked him when he came, but the contract turned bad whenever he kept getting hurt."
Braves,3dtwdb,mycrystalcity,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:58:45 2015 UTC,I think there is a legitimate argument based on how much we paid him.
Braves,3dtwdb,AbonymousNom,2,Sun Jul 19 16:22:41 2015 UTC,How much cash did we get along with him? Because I seem to remember it being a pretty considerable part of his salary. And we didn't give up much to get him.

Braves,3dtwdb,Tomahawkin95,2,Sun Jul 19 16:21:12 2015 UTC,"I swear I was at a day game one time when there was a routine pop up that was dropping in just off the pitchers mound. Wickman went for it, tripped, fell on his ass, and missed it. He looked lost out there, bUT it was haRd to be mad at him because it was hilarious. 2008 was a terrible year. On a related nite, any one have the wickman pic with the text that says""I made you a save, but I rated it.""?"
Braves,3dtwdb,fgsgeneg,2,Sun Jul 19 17:03:57 2015 UTC,"Saw Neon Deion get boinked in the face by a flyball once. I think that convinced him his sports future was with football. However, he was not one of the four worst Braves. There were entire teams from the seventies and eighties that qualify as multiples of the worst four ever. Remember the year the Braves opened 0 - 19? There were people on those teams that made Dan Uggla look like a steal."
Braves,3dtwdb,thekidfromyesterday,8,Sun Jul 19 20:35:20 2015 UTC,"Going by fWAR:   Andres Thomas (1985-1990) He hit .234/.255/.334 55 wRC+ and a whopping -4.6 fWAR (Why the fuck did we play him so much?) Rowland Office (1972-1979) He hit .260/.313/.346 76 wRC+ and -3.9 fWAR Felix Mantilla (1956-1961) He hit .231/.285/.325 71 wRC+ and -2.1 fWAR Jerry Royster  (1976-1984, 1987-1988) He hit .246/.310/.319 70 wRC+ and -2.0 fWAR"
Braves,3dtwdb,fgsgeneg,2,Sun Jul 19 13:12:07 2015 UTC,Rowland Office and Jerry Royster were both on the team that opened 0 - 19. His career was later the 56 - 61. It might have been more like 76 to 81.

Braves,3dtwdb,Compeau,3,Sun Jul 19 23:18:48 2015 UTC,John Rocker makes the list for off-field reasons.
Braves,3dtwdb,leg_room,5,Sun Jul 19 16:17:49 2015 UTC,Bases loaded nobody out game on the line against the mets...and Rocker comes sprinting in from the bullpen.  Inning over.  No damage done.  That will always be my most vivid Rocker memory.  Well that and when he did an AMA and told a poster he was going to fuck his mom.
Braves,3dtwdb,jaynap1,2,Sun Jul 19 17:56:37 2015 UTC,"Yelling ""You can't beat me!"" after mocking insane fan reaction to Piazza's routine fly out was amazing."
Braves,3dtwdb,thehighground,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:21:50 2015 UTC,That's my main memory of Rocker. The absolute mutual disdain he and the Mets had for eachother. It was beautiful.
Braves,3dtwdb,PickShark,0,Sun Jul 19 21:33:41 2015 UTC,"That's not a reason to put him there though, while he was here it was great. His mouth just got in the way."
Braves,3dtwdb,TheyMadeMeInAHurry,4,Sun Jul 19 18:02:24 2015 UTC,"There's a fatal flaw to a list like this. Really bad players don't get to stay on the team long. Players who start decent and then bad are going to populate most people's lists. High profile free agents who didn't match contracts are also going to be on there. That being said BJ truly was one of the worst. Terrible on the field, at the plate, and in the clubhouse. Dan had some bad years, but the players loved the guy. He can't be on this list.    BJ Upton John Rocker on attitude alone Kenshin kawakami 4.JoJo Reyes"
Braves,3dtwdb,DJ_Roomba__,3,Sun Jul 19 14:26:39 2015 UTC,Melky Cabrera was a waste of a jersey. 0-8 in the NLDS vs San Francisco and was just a fat waste for most of the year.  Kawikami was the Braves trying to jump on a trend and getting burned....bad.  Andruw Jones in his last 2 years in Atlanta was the most frustating player to watch. I love him but he was so inconsistant.  Bob Wickman made me not watch the last innings of Braves games when we were leading. He was frustrating too. It was a rough thing to watch after seeing Smoltz being a dominant closer for a few years.
Braves,3dtwdb,kuntbusch,4,Sun Jul 19 17:24:57 2015 UTC,"It is really not fair to include Andrew Jones. He was aging, but a couple of bad years is nothing. In his prime he was one of the best players in all of baseball, let alone on the Braves."
Braves,3dtwdb,TheyMadeMeInAHurry,4,Sun Jul 19 18:40:10 2015 UTC,"2006 Andrew Jones made your list of worst Braves?  He was an All Star that year, won his 9th consecutive Gold Glove, and a WAR above 5.  Sure he was on a decline, but still one of the best CF's in the game that year."
Braves,3dtwdb,FreeFreddieHugs,0,Sun Jul 19 18:42:31 2015 UTC,Maybe I was a little rough on Andruw. But I watch him swing so wildly at pitches that year that it turned me against him. It just seemed that he was trying too hard to pad his stats to get the big money from someone else.     Maybe replace him with Raul Mondesi on my list.
Braves,3dtwdb,leg_room,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:02:26 2015 UTC,I am new to avidly following the braves (only for about 3ish years now) and I remember hearing about derek lowe but why does everybody hate him? Was he just bad?
Braves,3dtwdb,aeps002,2,Sun Jul 19 17:44:05 2015 UTC,"Meh...he was much worse than what we paid him for.  He wouldn't be a top 4 all timer bad, though.  Just a bad FA signing...which we're pretty consistent at."

Braves,3dtwdb,obiwans_lightsaber,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:47:45 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try to get recent bias out of the way and go with the 4 worst that I remember. First I'm going to get a couple of really popular guys that I keep seeing OFF this list:  Dan Uggla - he doesn't belong on the list because he had a really good first year that included a career high in homers and a 35 or so game hitting streak. he was also working his ass off until the end when he began to get frustrated by both his performance and lack of PT. Dan gets a pass.  Kenshin Kawakami- he doesn't belong here either. he signed a cheap deal, was never expected to be an ace, but he was Japanese so we treated him like he was supposed to be Yu Darvish. We had entirely too high expectations for him and they weren't realistic.  so the worst 4 Braves:   Dan Kolb - expensive acquisition and went 3-8 with 11 svs in 65 gms with 5.93 era. Ew. Kenny Lofton - signed as a free agent for 1997 after coming off a career high 14 homers, career high 75 sb, and a .317 avg. although he hit for high avg (.333) and had a good OBP, he was only 27 for 47 in stealing bases, and spent the entire season bad-mouthing Atlanta and his decision to sign with us. he retreated back to Cleveland a year later, and promptly resumed being a good player again. Melky Cabrera - according to baseballreference.com, the only offensive stat he didn't decline in after signing after being a failure in New York (you read that right. labelled as a failure, still declined even further) was triples. he spent the entire year being confrontational with the rest of the locker room and bad-mouthing the city and the media, and he was not invited back the next season. the salt in the wound was that he would go on to be a dominant outfielder for KC the next season. Nate McLouth/BJ Upton - I'm lumping these guys together because they had the same career in the same city at different times. Both were gold glove/all-star caliber guys that were acquired to provide solid CF and be a guy to build around for years to come. that obviously didn't happen with either guy, as both guys came in after having good seasons with both the glove and bat, and both guys completely forgot how to play baseball once in Atlanta. honestly, I would've left BJ off the list based on how hard he was working to fix himself, and how his attitude never waned. everyone in the locker room loved him. but $75 million should at least buy a top 50 player. we didn't even get a league minimum quality guy.   Honorable Mentions:  Juan Fransisco  Yunel Escobar  Mark Kotsay  Tommy Hanson  Mark Teixeira (because fuck that guy)  Gerald Laird  Casey Kotchman"
Braves,3dtwdb,gnich62,-5,Tue Jul 21 00:03:09 2015 UTC,"Brooks Conrad. How soon we forget...  In game three of the 2010 NLDS, Brooks Conrad made three errors in a loss to the San Francisco Giants, who would eventually go on to win the World Series. His second error, in the second inning, let in a Giants' run. His third error was far more important. After Eric Hinske hit a two-run, eighth inning pinch-hit home run to put the Braves ahead by one run, Conrad let a ball go between his legs in the top of the ninth. This error allowed the game-winning run to score. The Giants took a 2-1 series-lead. Conrad's three errors tied a Division Series record."
Braves,3dtwdb,MastadonBob,18,Sun Jul 19 14:22:37 2015 UTC,Also remember his numerous clutch homeruns. His walkoff grandslam. He was Clutch Conrad at the plate. Its not all bad.   Edit: also way to copy wikipedia. A+ effort

So in order to afford this, I have to be very conscious of expenses. All in all, my goal is to average 15 bucks a day. So far, I'm doing a pretty great job at doing just that.

Braves,3dp7es,Xonero,11,Sat Jul 18 03:14:16 2015 UTC,I'm drunk. We won. I'm happy.
Braves,3dp7es,veloxthekrakenslayer,6,Sat Jul 18 03:36:55 2015 UTC,"Tonight Maddon gave a good example of Fredi scapegoating. I think most consider Maddon one of the better managers in the league and even one of the few new-age managers, no?  Well, Cubs fans are complaining about how he keeps using Strop.  https://twitter.com/search?q=maddon%20strop&src=typd&vertical=default&f=tweets"
Braves,3dp7es,SG8970,3,Sat Jul 18 03:20:40 2015 UTC,I take it most of Twitter doesn't view Baseball closely. Anyone who does knows Maddon is a good manager and quite frankly Fredi isn't.
Braves,3dp7es,thekidfromyesterday,8,Sat Jul 18 03:23:41 2015 UTC,"I was carrying over my point from the Fredi extension thread. Which is that most fans have problems with the managers. And many managers do dumb things in hindsight with the pen.   Not saying Fredi doesn't do stupid things, or even that I prefer him to Maddon,  just that we don't watch other managers day in and day out like we do Fredi. We don't get an idea of some of their faults as well. There are definitely complaints about bullpen management from other fanbases with their managers."
Braves,3dp7es,SG8970,2,Sat Jul 18 03:28:59 2015 UTC,"I do agree most teams hate their managers, but I can't help but feel we can do better."

Braves,3dp7es,Quixotic_Ryan,2,Sat Jul 18 03:12:34 2015 UTC,"It was a pretty hot, humid evening from what Chip and Joe were saying. He also got his pitch count up early by getting into a jam in the first and had thrown 90 when Fredi pulled him. Plus, it was his third time through the order and he'd allowed to men to reach already. Hendricks only went 5-2/3 on 100 pitches, so I wouldn't worry too much.   The real key is the bullpen pitched 4-1/3 innings of 2-hit, shutout ball! When was the last time we could say that?"
Braves,3dp7es,ironicname,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:36:13 2015 UTC,Wondering the same. Dammit somebody answer.

Braves,3dp7es,cymmot,8,Sat Jul 18 03:21:32 2015 UTC,I can imagine people's reaction had Fredi left him in and he gives up a home run or two run scoring double.

Braves,3dp7es,ReeceChops44,3,Sat Jul 18 04:44:12 2015 UTC,I'm glad he didn't wait. It looked like Teheran kept missing the zone today.
Braves,3dp7es,thekidfromyesterday,4,Sat Jul 18 03:24:56 2015 UTC,He had thrown 95 or so pitches and was scuffling. I'd say you guys have nothing to worry about.

Have a serviceable manager who clearly isn't the long term answer weather the storm, and then when you're confident with your roster, bring in your guy of the future, and make it clear that you expect him to win. Hoping it's that, and not that our FO just sees something in Freddi."
Braves,3dngae,Itypedthesewords,11,Fri Jul 17 18:36:28 2015 UTC,but.... Bud Black is readily available.....
Braves,3dngae,PWNtimeJamboree,6,Fri Jul 17 18:41:38 2015 UTC,"I'll copy something I wrote from another thread yesterday concerning our other options.  Bud Black- .477 wpct, 649 wins, 2 winning seasons Mike Redmond- .428 wpct, 155 wins, 0 winning seasons Fredi Gonzalez- .523 wpct, 676 career wins, 5 winning seasons  It's obviously hard to compare just based on wins, because Fredi has had better teams.  But Fredi managed a bad Marlins team to a .497 record, and was fired for it just like Mike Redmond was.  The Marlins have only gotten worse after his firing.  If we're hiring someone new, it needs to be someone that can take us to the next level.  I'm not sure if there's a candidate that's a better option than Fredi.  Bud Black possibly could, but he's managed those ""scrappy"" run producing/ good pitching teams before with very little success.  And Bo Porter and TP are unproven.  Those are the best options other than possibly Ozzie Guillen who is a very good manager by advanced statistics (another fired Marlins guy, I'm sensing a theme here).  I don't see it happening though as his style doesn't seem to mesh with our front office.  The contract length is perfect.  This was the right move."
Braves,3dngae,vonDriessen,10,Sat Jul 18 01:35:30 2015 UTC,Bud Black is almost as bad as Fredi at the things we hate Fredi for (Bullpen management). We need someone new school who pays attention to scouting and analyticals.
Braves,3dngae,phamalacka,10,Fri Jul 17 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"Fredi is a dumbo  with avilan (Seems irreversible) but he really does need a true loogy. But for other things,  not so bad and signs of improvement each year. I still think he's a gigantic scapegoat for the same things that go on with a majority of managers. Like you mentioned with Bud Black and I think most fans have problems / hindsight questions with their managers. Plus, no promise that the next one would be a big difference,  worse,  or not have his own set of faults that we'd complain a out.  All things considered Fredi wasn't handed a lot this year in some departments and they managed to stay near 500. I always say I wouldn't be sad to see him go but I'm not so convinced a replacement would be an instant fix or positive he'll be a lot better. There plenty of questionable managers out there."
Braves,3dngae,SG8970,0,Fri Jul 17 20:35:27 2015 UTC,"I'm just of the opinion that fredi has completely maxed out his potential and is getting worse. Even if there's a chance of a new guy being worse, there also a chance of being better; which we don't have with fredi."
Braves,3dngae,phamalacka,5,Fri Jul 17 20:38:05 2015 UTC,To me it seems like Fredi has had year to year improvements. I get some people not feeling the same way.
Braves,3dngae,SG8970,4,Fri Jul 17 20:42:25 2015 UTC,"While that's true, I don't think you hire a manager who you want to win with in the future and have his first taste of the franchise be mediocre at best.

Relatively, the manager only has x amount of impact on the ball club and it's performance.   I just think too much emphasis is put on the manager. The manager doesn't win games, the players do. Sometimes the manager helps, sometimes the umpires help, sometimes fans help, sometimes the weather helps... sometimes the manager hurts things, as do umpires, weather and fans. I fail to see how so much blame can be levied on one person of so many.  That being said, I also look forward to the day that Fredi isn't the manager. But the reality of that is that there aren't a lot of candidates to take his place. Bud Black sounds nice, but what has he done? That reality takes greater form when you consider what  has any other manager done? This furthers my belief that the managers impact on the game is minimal at best. Much like left field, the position of manager is best left to someone not wholly incompetent, but merely adequate."

Braves,3dngae,Bill__Buttlicker,2,Fri Jul 17 18:33:58 2015 UTC,"The main rumors I have heard regarding Wren's dismissal was that it was only partially due to his spotty track record as GM, but also because Wren wanted to get rid of Fredi after last season which did not sit well with Bobby and Schuerholz. It really makes you wonder if Wren would have been able to save his job if he had backed Fredi and not pissed off the old guard.   Link to Talking Chop article"

Even though a lot of the Braves FO public speak has been ""We aren't ruling out this year"" type stuff, mostly in an effort to try and make trades look better and keep casual fans interested.  Anyone who can read what is going on should realize the Braves are in for a big 2017. Trying to build up prospects that are within a few years of being ready? Check. Building a new stadium opening in '17? Check. Drafting people to keep in the farm long term? Check.

Braves,3dngae,phamalacka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:36:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but a new manager now would likely put another manager in the same position as Fredi G is now come this time next year. The Braves FO realizes that the current MLB team isn't all that hot. They are just trying to maintain face though.  Hey, it reach the last month of next year, the Braves are still kinda ""meh"" but looking HOTT for 2017, they let Fredi G go, promote a coach to interim manager, promote a minor league coach to a major league position, and then quietly hire the new guy for 2017, announcing him after the season ends.  Ron Gant, IIRC, when SunTrust Park was first announced, on Good Morning Atlanta, said the Braves way is to typically handle stuff quietly. He hypothesized the Braves had been planning STP for a while, and seeing how the Braves have handled a lot of the off-season trades before this season, I am one to believe his knowledge of how the team he played for works."

Braves,3dngae,Xonero,5,Fri Jul 17 18:30:15 2015 UTC,Part of the problem seems to be the FO giving Bobby some sort of say in who the manager is. Bobby Cox was a great manager for standing up for guys. But he was just as piss poor at bullpen management as Fredi. I don't want him having any say in what goes on with the team. The 90s are over and it's time for them to actually move forward.
Braves,3dngae,MikeHoncho43,11,Fri Jul 17 19:16:33 2015 UTC,Everyone put the pitchforks and torches away.   Fredi is working with kids that should be in AA/AAA and a bullpen that should be pitching in coed softball.  Yesterday everyone was excited that we signed a 38 year old pitcher that was just DFA.  This team is playing above expectations at this point.
Braves,3dngae,BenStrike,10,Fri Jul 17 18:35:36 2015 UTC,"Isn't about this year, its about the cumulative failures of his entire time as manager."

Braves,3dngae,MikeHoncho43,10,Fri Jul 17 18:37:52 2015 UTC,I am not blaming Fredi for BJ and Uggla's inability to hit a baseball.  I thought he overused some reliable arms but not to the level of a Dusty Baker.
Braves,3dngae,Abailly907,16,Fri Jul 17 18:43:30 2015 UTC,"He severely mis-used the bullpen, to the point where some guys are no longer bullpening. He also struggled with lineup management and led multiple collapses. Sure, at times he wasn't dealt the best cards, but I've seen managers fired for a lot less. He really should've been fired after last season, but it appears bobby cox and the upper upper management saved him his job."
Braves,3dngae,id0v,5,Fri Jul 17 18:47:51 2015 UTC,I will blame him for putting BJ in the lead off spot for most of the season though.

Braves,3dngae,Aesho,3,Fri Jul 17 18:45:47 2015 UTC,Can you give examples of the last point? I am not disagreeing just curious as to what he was saying.
Braves,3dngae,phamalacka,11,Fri Jul 17 18:49:09 2015 UTC,"He said this year that Peraza should be the opening day starting second baseman. Anyone with half a knowledge of how contracts work, along with knowing that we need to operate as a smaller market team, knows that we need to wait until the Super Two deadline, at minimum, to call him up (as the Cubs did with all their guys, the Astros did with Correa, etc.). Furthermore, he was 20 years old at the time of this interview, and there was no reason to show his hand like that. He should have been simple, saying Peraza would be a good big leaguer and that he was impressing a lot of people, but he didn't."

I think that as long as the old guard,Schuerholz and Cox, are still heavily involved within the organization Fredi pretty much has immunity.  Fredi is far from a great manager, but also far from being one of the worst.  He's simply mediocre, some seasons he is a little better than average and some seasons a little worse than average.   Personally, I wish they would have just completely cleaned house after last season, with the exception of McDowell, but it is what it is and I don't think it will change any time soon. I hope I am wrong and the front office holds Fredi accountable when he falters in the future. However, given the way that events have played out in recent years I don't think this is a likely scenario."

If we had a new manager next year when the team still isn't ready everybody might give up on him and force them to change yet again for 2017.
Braves,3dngae,unittron,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:46:30 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with the extension right now, I think he's done a decent job THIS year. Not to say that I think he's done well his entire tenure, because he hasn't.  Just as long as when Sun Trust opens he's nowhere near it, I'm good."
Braves,3dngae,getspolanthers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:04:23 2015 UTC,"I'd rather us keep Fredi for now, let him go after his contract expires next season, and then have an honest-to-God manager search in the pre-17 offseason where we find THE GUY for our future success. The alternative is making a midseason hire of someone who is probably no better than Fredi. Also, I love Bobby Cox and what he did for our club. But we need to factor Hart and Coppy more into the decision for the next manager instead of bullheadedly going after a Bobby disciple."

Braves,3dnkrz,aubgrad11,2,Sat Jul 18 03:03:12 2015 UTC,My guess is two youngish relief pitchers of questionable quality. The speculative hope is that they are just effective enough to finish the season. That being said we have Vizcaino and McKierahan returning in a few weeks so maybe a veteran reliever and a lottery pick minor leaguer.
Braves,3dnkrz,sorcerer165,-14,Fri Jul 17 20:27:25 2015 UTC,Misleading title.  This is purely speculation.
Braves,3dnkrz,general_relative,12,Fri Jul 17 19:02:01 2015 UTC,"Dude the tweet says likely, and the title says likely. Thus one can assume there is a fair chance he will be traded."

Braves,3dsl26,IAMAHORSESIZEDUCK,0,Mon Jul 20 16:00:42 2015 UTC,I think Chip is great. Better than any other tv broadcaster I've listened to with the mandatory exceptions like Vin. Most others have really poor voices for the job and terrible catch phrases that aren't good or original. Plus I like how Chip isn't an extreme homer.  I just don't like how every fly ball is a home run.
Braves,3dsl26,excrulon,2,Sun Jul 19 02:34:47 2015 UTC,"He is not terrible, but what really bothers me is the inability to adapt to this day and age of baseball when it comes to statistics. Him and Joe are constantly talking about wins and losses like they are a true measure of how good a pitcher is. They don't even talk about stats like OPS, which is not complicated. For guys who work in baseball, they should really do a bit more research."

They wait a couple innings and then they answer it. These posts started as a place where you could say what your guess was to that question. The thing is that the posts are usually up much earlier than the game, so people were trying to guess the answers before they ever saw the questions.

Braves,3dmgp6,WallHalen,14,Fri Jul 17 13:43:34 2015 UTC,There is a rotation out there better than one with three Hall-of-Fame pitchers? Come on...
Braves,3dmgp6,drrhythm2,17,Fri Jul 17 14:27:00 2015 UTC,"One of those rotations successfully battled through the steroid era, and I'm really surprised smoltzie said this."
Braves,3dmgp6,mycrystalcity,5,Fri Jul 17 14:29:34 2015 UTC,"I remember Smoltzy giving up a homerun to Barry Bonds. He later said that he threw his best fastball right on the black of the outside corner. If Bonds didn't cheat (though I suppose that hasn't been proven), I doubt that HR would have happened. Just imagine if Steroids hadn't been a part of the game, how absurd the numbers for Glavine, Maddux, and Smoltz would have been."
Braves,3dmgp6,drrhythm2,2,Fri Jul 17 17:18:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I see pitchers having such success nowadays when you have to know that if you drop some of them back in the 90's, they'd have probably had an era somewhere around 4.   It's really not fair to say ""hey, these guys are better than we were"" because the Mets trio are pitching in a pitchers era. Mind you, I'm not saying the Mets young pitching is bad - it's very talented and will be successful barring injury - but they won't have to deal with Bonds, McGwire, Sosa, A-Rod in his prime, and the slew of other hitters that just wore people out in an era where ballparks seemed to be a bit smaller."
Braves,3dmgp6,mycrystalcity,15,Fri Jul 17 17:55:02 2015 UTC,The Mets need results first. That trio won every Cy Young in the 90s except '97 Pedro Martínez '99 Randy Johnson.

This could be an awesome time to be a baseball fan.  That said, I'm genuinely not sure why Smoltzy said this. They were absolutely dominant for a decade in the steroid era."
Braves,3dmgp6,BigChiefJoe,3,Fri Jul 17 15:59:06 2015 UTC,And then theres the poor phillies.
Braves,3dmgp6,Rift-Raft,5,Fri Jul 17 17:46:38 2015 UTC,"The ""poor"" Phillies won a World Series more recently they we have. In their five years of dominance, they got a ring. By that standard, we should have 3. Phuck those guys. No pity allowed."
Braves,3dmgp6,BigChiefJoe,5,Fri Jul 17 20:55:38 2015 UTC,"The ""poor"" Phillies won a World Series more recently they we have.    Yeah but they're still in Philidelphia.  You can't win your way out of that shit."

Braves,3dmgp6,BigChiefJoe,5,Sat Jul 18 07:31:52 2015 UTC,"The Mets stacked up on young power pitching... And they are talented. But Syndergaard and Matz still have time to bust, Harvey may or may not be as dominant as he was before TJ surgery, and DeGrom... Well, he might be the real deal. I see what Smoltzy is getting at here, but if you asked me how many of these guys are gonna be in the HOF? Too early to tell, but probably 0"
Braves,3dmgp6,ReeceChops44,4,Fri Jul 17 13:52:31 2015 UTC,"Significantly more talented, yes. Young John Smoltz is the only one of our guys who could pitch like these guys, arm talent/stuff wise. None of them have maddux's brain or Tom Glavine's aggressiveness. Plus only John ever missed any time with injuries. What made the Braves legendary was the longevity. I get where he's coming from though. I don't think there's ever been a more talented collection of arms."

Braves,3dmgp6,swampy13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:55:03 2015 UTC,"I honestly think I see what smoltzy is saying, in that, during the Big 3 era, there was always just those 3 (Avery was close, but he fizzled because of injuries). I don't think he thinks that this group is going to put 3 guys in the hall, or that they will win every Cy for a decade sans 2 years, but top to bottom, talent-wise, I think he thinks this could potentially become the best 5-man rotation in baseball for a long time.  they might not all go to the hall, but all 5 could all be perennial all-stars. that's huge."
Braves,3dmgp6,PWNtimeJamboree,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:16:21 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing. Having Maddux, Glavine, and Smoltz alone makes it a close race but top to bottom the mets have  a rotation of sub 3.50 ERA's."

Braves,3dmas1,ReeceChops44,4,Fri Jul 17 13:57:55 2015 UTC,"For real, we've been getting a lot of mixed reports on this injury and I am pretty confused.  My current theory is that the FO is saying freeman will return soon to make it appear like we still have an outside shot at a playoff run. That would allow us to demand more in trades for our key players.... probably not whats happening but I love a good conspiracy"
Braves,3dmas1,Evil_Puppy,0,Fri Jul 17 14:05:06 2015 UTC,"I know.  That caught me off guard too, considering the Talking Chop piece from a couple days ago literally quoted Hart saying the opposite.  Really, there was just a whole lot of uncertainty from all of them re: Freddie.  Maybe he woke up yesterday and the pain/swelling was subsiding?"

The G Braves will be on the road til the end of next week and the M Braves will be at home this weekend and early next week.  Maybe a couple games at AA and then up to Gwinnett for a few more before rejoining the parent club.
Braves,3dm60m,Ted_Scheckler,4,Fri Jul 17 11:49:23 2015 UTC,"You should be fine. There are assholes in every stadium but I've never really seen anyone giving a hard time to anyone wearing opposing gear unless it's a huge game. Even then it's usually in good fun.     That Hotel is fine and you can walk to the stadium but there isn't much to walk to beyond that. If you don't have Uber where you live I'd go ahead and download the app. It's very popular here and a great way to get around. It would be a few bucks to get to the Aquarium, Centennial Park, College Football Hall of Fame, SkyView, etc. As in any city just be aware of your surroundings but you should be fine. A lot of people that don't live in the city will tell you the area around Turner Field isn't 'safe' but you have great neighborhoods close by and are close to Grant Park and the Zoo. I definitely recommend the Zoo and Aquarium with kids that age. If you plan on seeing attractions look into the CityPass."

Braves,3do584,PickShark,5,Fri Jul 17 21:42:24 2015 UTC,the likely candidate to close after JJ's departure is Arodys Viscaino. Young fireballer recovered from TJ and fresh off a PED suspension. but he hits 100 with ease it seems.

Braves,3dl3vw,vslyke,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:41:15 2015 UTC,Here's to hoping Simmons can figure out offense in the next year or so!
Braves,3dl3vw,general_relative,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:07:44 2015 UTC,"Andrelton's bat has always worried me. His defense is obviously so amazing that any real production is a bonus, but it just bugs me to think how incredible he could be if he would even be an average hitter at the plate. I don't like the idea of having real holes in the lineup, and I don't understand why the hitting coaches can't get him to stop trying to be a 30-HR hitter. It looks like he's taking an uppercut swing on everything. Not striking out is nice, but not when you hit so many pop-ups."
Braves,3dl3vw,drrhythm2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:39:42 2015 UTC,"He just swings too damn hard. Back in April and May it looked like he may have gotten over some of that, but it has progressively gotten worse as the season has gone on and lately he's back to the almost fall down after every swing bullshit."
Braves,3djkb4,thekidfromyesterday,9,Thu Jul 16 20:02:52 2015 UTC,It's been neat to see how fast Albies' star has risen.  Excited to see how he develops over the next couple of years.
Braves,3djkb4,ancalagor,5,Thu Jul 16 23:12:24 2015 UTC,It'd be something to slide simba to third.  If Jace keeps improving his glove (or if peraza makes the jump) we could have the best defensive infield of all time.
Braves,3djkb4,speed3_freak,9,Thu Jul 16 23:25:20 2015 UTC,I'd have to think that Albies would switch to third. Gotta have Simmons cover the most ground.
Braves,3djkb4,JanThaMan,6,Thu Jul 16 23:33:45 2015 UTC,"Albies plays behind second, Simmons plays just like he does now."
Braves,3djkb4,waffles,6,Thu Jul 16 23:37:53 2015 UTC,It would be just like it is now when Johnson is playing third
Braves,3djkb4,speed3_freak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:47:08 2015 UTC,That would be something to watch.
Braves,3djkb4,JanThaMan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:51:04 2015 UTC,Albies won't have the arm for third. It's fine for short and all but won't hold up at the corner
Braves,3djkb4,PickShark,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:18:41 2015 UTC,Is the distance gap that noticeable between short and third? I feel like third usualy plays way further in so the distance seems about equal.
Braves,3djkb4,JanThaMan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:52:02 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure SS requires a better arm than 3B; think of that throw deep in the hole moving away from first. 3B doesn't have to make that throw.
Braves,3djkb4,drrhythm2,3,Fri Jul 17 12:13:26 2015 UTC,"I keep getting the feeling that with the surge from Ozzie and the effectiveness of Peterson that Peraza might end up being traded. I know that isn't a popular opinion, but the idea of packaging him with maybe a pitcher to get a hitting prospect that we could use (Corner outfield or 3B, ideally) is tantalizing."
Braves,3djkb4,phamalacka,3,Fri Jul 17 01:26:47 2015 UTC,"Jace has been pretty decent, but certainly nothing world-beating. Maybe it's just his July slump that eating into his production, but I would hope we could do better than a .250 hitter at 2B. I'm still not convinced Jace is the ""future"" at 2B. If we want to be a playoff contender, we can't be settling for average-ish players. I'm not sure if his numbers this year represent him over-playing his talent, are representative of his talent, or are him under-playing his talent. That's the issue for me. I'd like to see where he is after another month or two.   That being said, I'm not 100% convinced Peraza is the ""future"" either, if for no other reason than his walk rate keeps his OBP too low for a fast base-stealer. But Peraza is still REALLY young (barely 21), and Jace is 25... Of course Albies is 18 and a half and is tearing up A-ball.   I mean, if our two best position prospects are SS/2B, why would we want to keep our average-ish starting 2B unless he shows he can be more than that?"
Braves,3djkb4,drrhythm2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:23:33 2015 UTC,"My point is that no player peaks as a rookie, and that jade has proven to be a valuable commodity in the MLB (solid obp, good speed, great glove), and he's already proven he can be that at this level, while showing he has room to improve drastically (a .309 BABIP is actually pretty low for a guy with his speed).   I'm just saying that Peterson is an adequate placeholder until Ozzie gets here, especially because he's a candidate to be ready for the show when he's 20 or 21. I'd rather have jace and what we could get for peraza than jace and peraza."
Braves,3djkb4,phamalacka,3,Fri Jul 17 12:39:52 2015 UTC,"My point is that no player peaks as a rookie,   Well, kinda. You never really know when someone is going to peak. Three examples:  Andrelton's best hitting stretch was 2012, when he hit .289 and posted a 103 wRC+ over about 1/3 of a season. At that pace he would have put up 6+ WAR. He hit worse in 2013, then hit much worse in 2014. This year he's still hitting worse than 2012 or 2013.   Jason Heyward's rookie campaign at the plate was his best yet. In 2010 he hit .277 and posted a 134 wRC+. He hasn't repeated those numbers since. His 2011 offense was a big fall-off, jumping back up in 2012 before starting to fall again.   Jeff Francouer was a beast in 2005, and literally never hit that well again the rest of his career.   I think sometimes it just takes pitchers a while to figure out how to get a new hitter out at the plate. Jace may be no different. He's a new face, and pitchers didn't have a ""book"" on him. Now, he has to be able to adjust to that ""book,"" or he will continue to hit poorly. Just my opinion."
Braves,3djkb4,drrhythm2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:07:26 2015 UTC,"That's fair, but I feel that the Braves have become blinded by a string of bad situations. Most players build to a peak."
Braves,3djkb4,phamalacka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:20:08 2015 UTC,"Well, you may be right. Jace had a really good year in AAA last year. He seems like he's a great athlete with all-around solid tools but without standing out in any one area. He's fast-ish; he'll steal a few bases. He's quick-ish. He has a decent eye at the plate. His defense is probably a tick above average. He walks at a respectable clip.    Basically, if he could get his average up and finish hitting .275 or so, you'd probably have a guy with a .350+ OBP at 2nd base with solid defense and pretty good speed. If he could do that, he'd be a decently valuable second baseman and have a strong argument to be our starter for as long as he can roughly keep up that production. That wouldn't be anything amazing, but it would give us someone to hold down 2B and potentially deal Peraza for help elsewhere.   And that's really what it comes down to... would Peraza be better than Peterson? If so, by how much? And if so, can we get more value trading Jace or trading Peraza? Or do we want to let Spring Training next year be a kind-of ""open competition"" for the 2B spot?   It's a tough call for me because I think Jace has less upside but maybe less downside possibility than Peraza. Peraza is a young 21, one of the youngest guys in all of AAA. Let me put it this way: Jace hit .300+ last year in AAA at age 24; Peraza is hitting .288 - pretty damn close - at age 21 in AAA this year.   The difference is that Jace walks a lot more. Peraza's OBP is pretty bad. And that worries me. But... again, he's only 21... so, can that approach at the plate be refined? Only the flip size Peraza has far more speed and rarely strikes out..."
Braves,3djkb4,drrhythm2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:56:36 2015 UTC,"Approach almost never changes from AAA to the bigs. SOmetimes you can take a guy and change how he thinsk about an AB down in the low minors, but Peraza will never be a guy that walks enough. That's one of the things that scares me. Jace Peterson is the kind of player that makes up parts of a championship team; he isn't spectactular but he makes the team better. He's got a skillset that is ideal at his position, which he plays well, and he plays hard. I see him as a guy that would fit in on the Cardinals well (a bunch of good role players makes a team, not a loose group of highly touted players, see Braves 2013).   It all comes to percieved value. In my opinion, Jace plus a return on Peraza will be better, long term, than Peraza and a return on Jace."
Braves,3djkb4,phamalacka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:11:34 2015 UTC,Why not package Jace with a pitching prospect?
Braves,3djkb4,cteez910,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:17:40 2015 UTC,Because hype is more valuable than MLB results.
Braves,3djkb4,phamalacka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:20:29 2015 UTC,"I see Peraza as being a Jace type player, just upgrade everything.  I guess basically Prado but with better D, more speed and less power.  At this point you give Peraza a shot in the MLB for a few months no matter what, then trade him if you feel like he wont pan out"
Braves,3djkb4,cteez910,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:27:07 2015 UTC,"Well if you feel he won't pan out, his value will be significantly lower."
Braves,3djkb4,phamalacka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:12:03 2015 UTC,Having players to look forward to in the minor leagues is a fun thing. I don't know how the infield will shape up down the road with Simmons/Albies/Peraza/Peterson but too much talent is a good problem to have. And it gives the team flexibility to make a move for an impact bat at another position.
Braves,3djkb4,blackcoffee_91,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:39:44 2015 UTC,"Also we just signed three shortstops from the international free agent market (I think all three were SS). Granted, they are 16, but we really seem to be pushing for middle infield talent. I know these guys are often moved elsewhere but it's still interesting.   I think a couple of other decent prospects in the system are middle infielders as well."
Braves,3djkb4,drrhythm2,3,Fri Jul 17 15:54:30 2015 UTC,Shortstops rarely stay at shortstop out of the international market. Miguel Cabrera was a SS.
Braves,3djkb4,phamalacka,-6,Fri Jul 17 18:13:07 2015 UTC,"So ... how much do the people at Talking Chop know about evaluating prospects? I mean, I take it they are not as knowledgeable as a Keith Law, though that doesn't stop them from speaking in the same authoritative voice. Honestly, the odd typo that seems to pop up at least once in all their articles kind of tarnishes their credibility with me more than anything."
Braves,3djkb4,new_wellness_center,2,Fri Jul 17 00:30:30 2015 UTC,"While I don't know their names, I've been going to Talking Chop since before it merged with the Capital Avenue Club. The CAC was the place that opened my eyes into advanced scouting and analysis and several years ago they all went to to Talking Chop. Generally, these people aren't professional scouts. They do, however, go to Minor League games and do their work in person. In addition, most of the staff has covered the Braves or Baseball for many years.   The point of the Capital Avenue Club was to give people the tools to make their own conclusions. To be perfectly honest, make your own evaluation. There is YouTube footage of practically all the top prospects. Some of it might not be very long, maybe a single at bat or pitching sequence, but it's there."

Braves,3die66,thekidfromyesterday,6,Thu Jul 16 14:55:38 2015 UTC,"That was a very good interview. Hart was more candid about the status of the organization than I thought he would be.  And while Hart doesn't specificaly say that Fredi will not be coming back, it certainly sounds like the club is ready to move on at the end of the year"
Braves,3die66,jnorthin,6,Thu Jul 16 16:10:41 2015 UTC,"Q: Are you worried about Bethancourt?  A: I really like his skill set. I don’t think he has embraced what it is he needs to do to sell out to his pitching staff, to drive the train. We sent him to Gwinnett, and I told (manager Brian Snitker) the boxes I wanted checked: shows up early, prepares for game, goes over scouting report, works the pitcher. Go through those intangibles.  Q: You’re talking about dedication.  A: Not dedication. It’s a level of preparedness you need for what Roger (McDowell) expects and a championship organization expects, especially when dealing with young pitchers.  Q: So he doesn’t understand what it takes.  A: You put it well.  Q: Did the organization miscalculate his readiness?  A: We talked about it in the winter. We called him up last year, and he had a good first month and a not-so-good last month. That sort of left a bad taste. It’s fixable. But at some point the player has to assume some responsibility.   This does not sound promising for Bethancourt at all. It also probably means that we are not planning to deal him because otherwise that would be severely reducing his trade value."
Braves,3die66,vslyke,3,Fri Jul 17 02:26:06 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if the piece that he wanted was Grandal? The one that was put in another trade.  EDIT: MLBTR says it may have been Jesse Hahn
Braves,3die66,StuffandSuch5,3,Thu Jul 16 16:36:44 2015 UTC,It sounds like Bethaancourt has a bad work ethic. What are y'alls thoughts?
Braves,3die66,showmeyourcatplease,6,Thu Jul 16 19:31:24 2015 UTC,"I think that part of the article was telling.  It made it seem like he wasn't putting in the work to relate to the pitchers, I think Hart might have been saying that there is more to being a catcher than there is to playing other positions and Bethancourt might prepare himself to catch (working out and stuff), but he doesn't help the pitcher prepare to pitch in regards to game plans and attacking hitters.  If Bethancourt can be a good defensive catcher as we know he can.  He can really throw to second base.  Hopefully his pitch framing can improve and he needs to prepare the pitchers more than he does now.  I agree with Hart that a majority of the success for the pitchers is not on McDowell's shoulders.  I think Hart essentially called out Bethancourt publicly, but tried to do it politely.  While we can tell Hart was being honest in this interview, he also could have left out details that were more incriminating in regards to Bethancourt or anyone else mentioned in the article."
Braves,3die66,StuffandSuch5,2,Thu Jul 16 20:10:09 2015 UTC,Maybe Beth needed to hear it another way. They may have been telling him for months and this is a new approach to get the message across.

Braves,3die66,vslyke,3,Fri Jul 17 02:28:03 2015 UTC,"Q: Did it shock you when they said they would take Upton?  A: Yeah, it did. They put all of their chips in.   Hart knew he killed it."
Braves,3die66,Twistify804,3,Fri Jul 17 02:20:42 2015 UTC,I have a feeling he just suggested it as a joke and they ended up agreeing.
Braves,3die66,y2knole,4,Fri Jul 17 02:24:00 2015 UTC,"Kinda like how I imagine the Touki trade going.   ""I'll take Touki."" chuckles  ""Deal.""  ""What."""
Braves,3die66,showmeyourcatplease,2,Fri Jul 17 04:43:07 2015 UTC,"I will be surprised if Fredi isnt back next year.  the people who are in charge of the Braves are in order Scheulrholtz, Hart, (sub entry Copella who is still in an apprenticeship), Bobby Cox and Freddi  Of those 4, the 3 that matter all REALLY like him."
Braves,3die66,y2knole,4,Thu Jul 16 19:08:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think Fredi will be back, but that is my opinion.  I wonder if he would have been managing this season if he wasn't under contract and the Braves could have chosen who their manager would have been this season.  I don't think Hart believes Fredi is doing a good job.  I know that Bobby likes Fredi, but I'm not sure how everyone else who matters feels.  The quotes from Hart regarding Fredi seem to only be loosely defending Fredi and that is because he's still under contract.  What I believe doesn't matter, but I think the one making the final decision on personnel should be Hart with Coppallela or however you spell it being the second most important.  Schuerholz is no longer GM and Bobby is also no longer GM.  I think they should have input, but not be making the final decisions.  I'm pretty sure Copallella is very highly thought of in baseball and is the future GM of the team.  If I remember correctly, other teams wanted him to join their front offices and he might have even had GM offers, but he wanted to stay with the Braves.  I think the future for the team is bright, but I hope it doesn't include Fredi."
Braves,3die66,showmeyourcatplease,2,Thu Jul 16 20:22:04 2015 UTC,"I'll preface by saying I dont think Fredi is great, but certainly isnt as bad as alot of people have decided he is.  the main factor in whether he comes back is Scheurholtz though.  Hes the head honcho, loves Bobby, and they views Fredi as Bobby's #1 deciple, so...  We will see how it shakes out!  Go Braves!"
Braves,3die66,y2knole,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:28:53 2015 UTC,"I know Scheurholtz is at the very top of the pyramid.  I'm not sure if he makes the manager decision or not.  Don't people in the organization have strange job titles?  If I remember correctly, Hart isn't GM and Copallela isn't the assistant GM.  Hart is definitely the guy making the final decision on players and he needs a matching philosophy with the manager and the manager needs to approve of who is on the team and the kind of moves that the GM would make.  Fredi might accept the moves that Hart makes, but is he a good enough manager?"

Braves,3die66,Hedgey,7,Thu Jul 16 15:16:19 2015 UTC,It's interesting that the top up-voted comment in this thread is something that wasn't even remotely said...at all.
Braves,3die66,speed3_freak,7,Thu Jul 16 17:20:37 2015 UTC,"No where in the interview does Hart actually say anything close to that.  He said ""We'll deal with it when the time comes"" as being related to his contract and the fact that it ends at the end of the year."
Braves,3die66,vonDriessen,5,Thu Jul 16 15:47:25 2015 UTC,"You must have read something differently than me.  He did everything but say that Fredi wouldn't be resigned.     ‘I know you’re in your last year (of a contract). We’re making a run-through here and we’ll make the call when it’s appropriate.'  Q: Will that be a tough call at the end of the year?  A: I don’t think so.  Q: As in, he’ll be brought back?  A: I don’t want to go there. There’s timing.   You don't let a major league manager run out his contract if you intend to keep him."
Braves,3die66,speed3_freak,3,Thu Jul 16 16:09:02 2015 UTC,That can be interpreted either way.  He's obviously not going to say he's not being resigned or say that he's being extended until it's done.  I'm not surprised that they haven't extended him yet since they wanted to see how he handled an almost completely new club.
Braves,3die66,sorcerer165,3,Thu Jul 16 16:20:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know the vibe I got was completely different.    When we got together over the winter I told him: ‘You’re going to be a part of what we do here, as far as acquiring players, making deals and understanding the dynamic.’ We made moves that Fredi knew were going to hurt him but he never complained. He said, ‘Whatever’s good for the organization.’ I know I haven’t given him all the weapons he needs, His handling of the bullpen – I look up and think, ‘Well, how could anybody (handle this group)?’ He a winning man, he loves and cares about the Braves and he’s done a superior job. I was candid with Fredi: ‘I know you’re in your last year (of a contract). We’re making a run-through here and we’ll make the call when it’s appropriate.’ But Fredi is always ready to help figure out the solution to a problem.”   I don’t want to go there. There’s timing. But Fredi’s been really good. He’s been good to work with and he’s done a good job with his staff. And this club may fall apart but I know if it happens it’s not going to be because Fredi forgot how to manage.    Makes it sound like he just doesn't want Fredi to worry about contract specifics during the middle of the season."
Braves,3die66,gnich62,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:47:03 2015 UTC,"Again, major league managers don't finish a contract if the team wants to keep him.  There was no vote of confidence that he's the manager of the future, only saying that no one should blame him for how bad this team is this year.  I honestly think that they never had any intention of keeping him past this year, but decided since they had to pay him anyway, they might as well let him coach this (what they thought would be) trainwreck.    Fredi is a nice guy, but a horrible manager."

Braves,3dfckt,tjorgen1,0,Thu Jul 16 15:15:05 2015 UTC,"This may have huge implications on Fredi's job.  It's obviously not completely his fault but he told Freddie he could play until he saw it affect him.  I have no idea if that involved a major consultation with the team doctors or not, but ultimately the decision to keep playing him was most likely made by Fredi.  I've defended Fredi for a long time while knowing his weaknesses and this is one of them.  He tends to put winning in the present over the long term needs of the team.  On a rebuilding club, that's not exactly ideal.  The front office has a tough decision ahead of them this offseason.  I'm still on the fence personally, as I'm not sure we have a better option.  Fredi is still a very good manager in my opinion, but his bullpen decisions and injury management are definitely questionable at times.  But seriously, who else?"
Braves,3dfckt,vonDriessen,2,Thu Jul 16 05:27:17 2015 UTC,"Bo Porter and Terry Pendleton are both potential options.  Otherwise there are guys like Bud Black, Mike Redmond, etc out of a job."
Braves,3dfckt,AnEternalEnigma,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:30:41 2015 UTC,"Bud Black- .477 wpct, 649 wins, 2 winning seasons Mike Redmond- .428 wpct, 155 wins, 0 winning seasons Fredi Gonzalez- .523 wpct, 676 career wins, 5 winning seasons  It's obviously hard to compare just based on wins, because Fredi has had better teams.  But Fredi managed a bad Marlins team to a .497 record, and was fired for it just like Mike Redmond was.  The Marlins have only gotten worse after his firing.  If we're hiring someone new, it needs to be someone that can take us to the next level.  I'm not sure if there's a candidate that's a better option than Fredi.  Bud Black possibly could, but he's managed those ""scrappy"" run producing/ good pitching teams before with very little success.  And Bo Porter and TP are unproven.  I'm not insulting your suggestions, those really are the best options other than possibly Ozzie Guillen who is a very good manager by advanced statistics (another fired Marlins guy, I'm sensing a theme here).  I don't see it happening though as his style doesn't seem to mesh with our front office.  Thanks for actually providing a discussion on this.

My thought would be to ride it out this year with him and see if he can progress.  This year is a wash.     Plus, A.J. was never meant to be the starter when the Braves signed him."

Sorry, I know this is a very unpopular opinion."

Braves,3ddzob,lovetron99,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:42:52 2015 UTC,I understand. And I like him for that very reason. I appreciate that he can just call a game without trying to fill the gaps with dumb phrases and hypothetical scenarios. Very straightforwardly approach and I guess that's why I like him
Braves,3ddzob,Snowmittromney,2,Thu Jul 16 03:54:27 2015 UTC,"Joe Buck. I am so sick of listening to him, mainly for one reason: That interview he did a few years back where he said baseball games were going too long and he couldn't watch them anymore. I mean, fair enough, there's some truth in that, and you're entitled to your opinion ... but after we all spend the season listening to our hometown broadcasters (who hopefully still retain some passion and love of the game, in whatever form), we finally get to the World Fucking Series, the most important games of the year, what it's all been leading up to, and we have to listen to this dickhead?? Just fuck off, dude. Please."

They know you'll watch the game no matter what idiot they put on the air. So guys like Joe Buck spend their time talking about dumb shit like game length issues and steroids and the like to keep non-baseball fans watching the playoffs. It's all about ratings. This is why I usually mute the tv and turn the radio broadcast on.     One of these days, maybe in our lifetime, the game of baseball will almost be unrecognizable because of frivolous revenue capture."

Braves,3demxr,drrhythm2,2,Wed Jul 15 22:59:20 2015 UTC,Jace can still be moved into a utility role to make room for Jose. His numbers have been declining pretty steadily as of late
Braves,3demxr,ReeceChops44,6,Wed Jul 15 18:16:54 2015 UTC,Jace is one adjustment away from getting back on track.  He hasn't been able to handle off speed stuff.  If he can hang back and take those the other way or up the middle instead of trying to pull them we'll see his average climb back up.
Braves,3demxr,general_relative,2,Wed Jul 15 18:46:35 2015 UTC,I think he'll have the rest of the season to prove he can adjust; no need to call Peraza up if he's not gonna be playing every day. Unless Jace absolutely tears it up the second half I see this progressing into a ST competition (possibly to see who stays and who is traded)
Braves,3demxr,ReeceChops44,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:20:01 2015 UTC,"This is very likely a lost season for Sims because of that bus crash (first a bad/adjustment season in A+, and then a bus crash the next year).

Braves,3dbjg1,cymmot,7,Wed Jul 15 00:10:28 2015 UTC,"I'd say you nailed it.  No disrespect to Glavine and Smoltz, but Spahn and Maddux were two of the best to ever play the game.  If you ask me there hasn't been a pitcher as good as Maddux since he broke into the league."
Braves,3dbjg1,CLSmith15,0,Wed Jul 15 02:03:10 2015 UTC,"No doubt Maddux is one of the greatest pitchers of all time. However, when you think of Maddux, is he a Brave or Cub? He didn't come up as a Brave, he won his first Cy Young as a Cub and was then signed by the Braves in free agency. Maddux didn't even finish his career as a Brave, not even close. Essentially he played half of his career as a Brave, and the rest with the Cubs and a few other teams.  I don't think you can put him on any teams ""franchise four"" due to this. It is no disrespect to Maddux, not even close. As I said earlier, the man is one of the best pitchers of all time.  I would prefer you swap out Glavine or Smoltz for Maddux due to the time they spent with the Braves as opposed to Maddux. Glavine spent every year but 5 with the Braves, and Smoltz was every year but 2 throughout their long illustrious careers. Maddux was no-doubt better, but he spent so much time with other organizations that I don't think he can be a candidate given how much other talent we had. If he pitched for the Marlins or another organization that didn't have all the talent we had then that would be fine, but we are not a talent-starved organization.  This is just my opinion, though."
Braves,3dbjg1,Unc1233,2,Wed Jul 15 14:37:18 2015 UTC,Maddux choosing to not go into the Hall as a Brave knocks him out of my Franchise Four.  I replaced him with Smoltz.
Braves,3dbjg1,leg_room,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:09:42 2015 UTC,What about Knucksie? He won 318 games. More than Glavine (305) or Smoltz (213 w/154 saves). Only Maddux (355) did better and he had the benefit of playing on World Class teams. Knucksie was the only bright spot for years on a roster of losers. Yet he still managed to win. If he had played with the teams of the nineties he would have won more than four hundred. He was the greatest pitcher the Braves ever had.
Braves,3dbjg1,fgsgeneg,3,Wed Jul 15 18:52:16 2015 UTC,"My votes were Hank, Chipper, Smoltz, and Spahn. Eddie was my toughest omission. Maddux was a cub first and played a few places after us. Glacier is dead to me."

Dale Murphy: I'll sneakily name my first son after him. He's our treasure that nobody else would appreciate.

I personally feel Smoltz is the most deserving. He was there for all 14 division titles in a row. Like Chipper, he sacrificed his position desire for what was best for the team. And of course Smoltz is a stand-up dude. I'd also take Glavine, Murphy and Matthews over Maddux even though Maddog was the most dominant pitcher we had I still don't think he bleeds Braves like some of these other guys.     I'd also like to throw out another honorable mention that many may not bring up but I feel was not only a great player we leaned on for years but also really entrenched himself into the city of Altanta donating his time and money to helping other Atliens. And he was funny as hell! That man is Tim Hudson."
Braves,3dbjg1,Domino80,7,Wed Jul 15 01:40:59 2015 UTC,"Maddux is the best pitcher of all time (IMO), but Smoltzie will forever be my favorite. Dominant in every way he played, and just seems like an awesome guy. I really want to be able to grab a beer with him some day."
Braves,3dbjg1,1ncognito,-8,Wed Jul 15 03:53:58 2015 UTC,"Um, I'm as big a Braves homer as there is, and there is no way Maddux is the best pitcher of all time. It's arguable he wasn't the best pitcher of his era."
Braves,3dbjg1,Robert_Goulet,17,Wed Jul 15 04:40:42 2015 UTC,"You must be a teenager or early 20s guy. Maddux's dominance from 1990-1998, in the heart of the Juiced Era, is unparalleled. I don't think it's crazy to consider him the goat, even if I disagree. He deserves to be in the conversation."
Braves,3dbjg1,forgotmyothernames,3,Wed Jul 15 06:18:16 2015 UTC,He gets overlooked for best ever because he wasn't a strikeout pitcher. But I'd take Maddux over anybody to be my #1.
Braves,3dbjg1,hosey,5,Wed Jul 15 12:32:14 2015 UTC,Maddux is 10th all-time in career strikeouts.
Braves,3dbjg1,Compeau,3,Wed Jul 15 13:17:46 2015 UTC,"He had a lot of strike outs because of his longevity. He never went out there looking to strike guys out. He wasn't Roger Clemens or Randy Johnson, who were known for striking guys out. That's all I meant."
Braves,3dbjg1,hosey,4,Wed Jul 15 13:22:40 2015 UTC,"I agree that he wasn't a strikeout-first pitcher, but he did have the ability to strike guys out when he wanted to.  He did it by fooling batters rather than overpowering them: Maddux left a lot batters looking at strike 3."
Braves,3dbjg1,Compeau,2,Wed Jul 15 15:03:45 2015 UTC,I agree with everything your saying. He was so damn unassuming and sneaky on the mound that he was able to leave guys standing there looking stupid at a 89 mph fastball. That's why I love him.
Braves,3dbjg1,hosey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:30:14 2015 UTC,I think having the 10th all time highest strikeout count while also being a non strikeout pitcher actually makes a better case for him as GOAT. Maddux was easily my favorite player growing up but I don't think I would consider him GOAT.
Braves,3dbjg1,alien_abduction,2,Wed Jul 15 15:53:21 2015 UTC,"Counting stats are a pretty poor method of judging 2 players relative to each other, since it is mostly about longevity of careers.  Using rate stats allows you to get a better comparison."
Braves,3dbjg1,link3945,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:34:24 2015 UTC,Love him but you can't really tell me he's greater than say Sandy Koufax and some others. I'd pur him top 10 all time but saying greatest ever is a stretch.
Braves,3dbjg1,APPaholic47,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:47:06 2015 UTC,"On baseball reference's EloRater Maddux is #5 overall, and the first pitcher ranked who pitched after 1941. The only pitchers who are ranked higher than him are Walter Johnson, Pete Alexander, Lefty Grove, and Cy Young.  I understand that the EloRater is not an exact measure, because it certainly has it's flaws. However, if you take in to account the fact that many baseball writers constantly rank Maddux in their top 10 lists, or right on the cusp of top 10, his status among the elite is not nearly as far fetched as you are making it out to be."

Second, his dominance in that era absolutely is paralleled, ever heard of Perdo Martinez or Randy Johnson? Oh, and spot on assessment of my age (as if that has any relevance whatsoever), except that I've been following the Braves for 24 years. He's MAYBE in the conversation for top 5 of all time, but goat is just ignorant of baseball common sense."
Braves,3dbjg1,Robert_Goulet,2,Wed Jul 15 18:38:09 2015 UTC,"Pedro in his prime, 7 years between 97 and 03, may have been as good as Maddux, but his career isn't close."
Braves,3dbjg1,fantfoot,-2,Wed Jul 15 20:28:10 2015 UTC,"The only memory I have of Dale Murphy is watching him swing at ball four when it was two feet outside and six inches off the ground. He did this many, many times. He was a sucker for a long, low, way outside roundhouse curve. He couldn't hit it if his life depended on it. He was a decent player, but, his two MVPs aside, he was an average player most of his career."

Yes, he was an incredible pitcher in his prime with us and our success would have been impossible without him, but, if you won't put a team's logo on your Hall of Fame cap you can't be one of their top 4 ever.   Some tough choices but I'd go with Aaron, Matthews, Smoltz, Chipper."

Simmons is not having his usual stellar defensive year. He's made some of his great plays, but he's also flubbed a few. I really don't see anyone else on the team to even talk about. Several are playing well (Pierzynski, Maybin), but not exactly at the All Star level."
Braves,3dbat9,arch_maniac,6,Wed Jul 15 02:00:57 2015 UTC,Andrelton has been incredible this season lol. he has 15 DRS. Only players with more are Kevin Keirmaier and Nolan Arenado. Far and away the best defensive shortstop in baseball. Maybin could have had a legitimate case for it if he stole more bases or made more highlight defensive plays. The mistake made for the ASG is that they do outfield as a collective and so RF and LF players often take all the reserve spots since they dont need to be great defensively. Joc was clearly the best CF in the NL. Freeman is hurt so it doesnt matter and he is great in his own right. 1B just happens to be the single most talented position offensively in baseball right now
Braves,3dbat9,PickShark,5,Tue Jul 14 23:23:54 2015 UTC,"Joc is not the obviously best cf in nl, I would argue McCutchen is much better"

Braves,3db67l,ancalagor,6,Tue Jul 14 23:57:54 2015 UTC,"...grading the deals today is somewhat like grading an NFL draft after a few hours   Glad I don't have to point that out.   But Heyward is turning into the player the Braves had hoped for... They’ll get burned if he continues to ascend, whether it’s with the Cardinals or another team.    Disagree.  Braves having not extended him at an earlier point shouldn't weigh on evaluating the trade at all.  At this point one year of Heyward is looking like a wash vs one year of Miller.  With multiple years of control, and a potential future piece in Jenkins (though I'm not on the hype train there) the only way the Braves get burned is if Miller gets hurt in the ASG tonight.   Gattis trade... GRADE: D   I disagree with the potential value Gattis brings to the Braves, despite liking him at catcher more than most (Not literally the worst in the league at framing!).  He is more valuable on an AL team, and the return for him seems appropriate, with Ruiz in particular being a type of player that the Braves' farm is weak in.   Kimbrel trade...

Braves,3d98eq,Damphair,8,Tue Jul 14 14:19:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not giving up hope on Bethancourt just yet and I really hope the FO doesn't either.  He is hitting again in AAA and with enough ABs at the major league level his bat will come around just like it has done at every minor league level.  However, I know his issue isn't with his bat, but his defense and his handling of pitchers.  From watching him play this season it's obvious that most of these issues aren't talent issues but mental issues.  As he matures his mentality will change and he will improve defensively and cut down on costly mental errors such as passed balls, poor pitch framing, short hoping second base on throws, etc. Give the kid time, he's young and he has loads of talent"
Braves,3d98eq,general_relative,6,Tue Jul 14 15:25:35 2015 UTC,"how many years can you be considered a 'top prospect'?  What is he, 23, 24 years old? The chances he makes a dramatic improvement at this stage are slim."

Braves,3d98eq,FriendlyFreeman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:21:02 2015 UTC,But that's my point.  He's 23 but most of his improvements need to come mentally.  If he can fix his mental immaturity I think he will begin to blossom into a plus defensive catcher.
Braves,3d98eq,general_relative,2,Tue Jul 14 19:28:31 2015 UTC,"Gonzalez was doing a great job this year... Until this last road trip. The loss in the finale against the brewers (which may have been the most gut-wrenching of the season) was mostly Fredi's fault, leaving Avilan in to face two heavy-hitting righties. The team had no steam heading into Colorado, and just when we had a chance to get a much-needed win before the All Star break, he inexplicably leaves Woody in the game. So yeah, just looking at the record, Gonzalez has exceeded expectations this year. But momentum is key in baseball and enough of these little blunders can ruin a good season."

He is improving. He has many faults, the most glaring is the bullpen. But given that the bullpen is atrocious in the first place, I can't fault him too much.   The only suggestion I'd make to him is to stop relying on Avilan so much. Trust in his pitchers. Trust the matchups. Trust. Poor pitchers will let him down, but he might surprise himself. Plus, Avilan is solidly an average (or slightly below average) reliever. And Gonzalez uses him way too much."
Braves,3d98eq,pinkflamingobadger,0,Wed Jul 15 08:45:44 2015 UTC,"It is his fault. He's the manager. They're getting worse as the season goes on. They have no consistent lineup and the bullpen situation is all kinds of jacked up. The offense has looked asleep the last 4 weeks, while the bullpen has improved slightly. He tinkers with the lineup every game and what players are in AAA one night and the majors the next. Nobody can get into a rhythm. They have their share of injuries, but all teams do and it's not an excuse. I really wish he was doing better because I like the guy, and he keeps a clean clubhouse. But he's had plenty of different styles of players to mold a successful team and it's the same results. I understand where you're coming from, though."

Braves,3d4gn9,fathampsteroncrack,19,Mon Jul 13 13:45:06 2015 UTC,"I've heard it put this way and this is what made it finally click for me:  If these stadiums were actually profitable, owners would build them themselves and keep all the profits. There's a reason they don't."
Braves,3d4gn9,uchuskies08,7,Mon Jul 13 14:12:05 2015 UTC,"Except, there are revenue streams available to a county that are not available to the team.  If the businesses around the stadium see an increase in sales, that could mean an increase in sales tax revenue.  If the stadium leads to commercial development of the area around the stadium that could mean higher sales tax revenue and higher property taxes.  The team's owners can't tap those revenue streams, so it might not be profitable for the team but could be profitable for the county."

That is, people spend there instead of somewhere else but there isn't a net increase in spending.  So in terms of answering the Cobb County question it really comes down to whether enough people come in from out of County to spend their money there (that they would otherwise spend elsewhere).    I think it's fairly likely to have a impact, just not compared to how much they spent for it."

Braves,3d4gn9,speed3_freak,3,Mon Jul 13 18:25:43 2015 UTC,I was surprised he didn't talk about Atlanta more in his piece about this. Seems like Atlanta is a perfect example of what he was discussing with both stadiums being built. And it's especially interesting to look at how the Braves stadium deal was reached and conducted.
Braves,3d4gn9,sonOFsack889,4,Mon Jul 13 14:06:11 2015 UTC,Everyone lobby for a federal law that makes TV blackouts of events at any facility that was taxpayer funded in any way illegal.   I'm OK with financing their stadium if they are OK with losing some of their distribution rights.   That's at least some real public value.
Braves,3d4gn9,Thecklos,7,Tue Jul 14 03:58:22 2015 UTC,"I hate the new Cobb stadium. Also I love John Oliver and I think he's correct to a degree. But there are a few holes in his argument that need further investigation. I don't think public funds should pay for new stadiums, but when cities compete to attract businesses it's not uncommon for them to offer incentives. Richmond lost their competition with Gwinnett. He glosses over the financial issues, basically saying that new stadiums don't increase income. Is that a helpful statement though? I wouldn't expect an increase. I would compare it to potential revenue loss if the team leaves. What is the financial impact of losing a stadium? What happened in Richmond? Also the bit about businesses around the stadium suffering is not entirely fair. Anyone who's been to Cubs stadium knows that. Even here in Atlanta it isn't entirely true. Sure around Turner Field sucks, but when the Thrashers were here you couldn't get a table in CNN Center. I don't go to Hawks games but I bet the same is true for them. Obama mentioned a law forbidding public funding of stadiums. Maybe that is the solution. I don't know."
Braves,3d4gn9,thereisonlyoneme,3,Mon Jul 13 14:44:21 2015 UTC,I went to a Bears Titans game in Nashville 2 years ago and the bars downtown literally ran out of beer.  The only thing I disagree with is the city should maintain ownership of the stadium so they get the money for the naming rights and other events that take place there.  The only problem with that is another city would be willing to concede that to get a team.
Braves,3d4gn9,speed3_freak,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:23:29 2015 UTC,"Having a professional sports team does not in any way increase peoples discretionary income which they can spend on entertainment, it simply reallocates the money from other places to the sports team."
Braves,3d4gn9,number_cruncher_1040,7,Tue Jul 14 01:18:01 2015 UTC,"I agree except for the very last bit.  It relocates money to the area.     I'm going to the Cubs game on Saturday.   We're going to go to Sweetwater, will take a few cabs, take the marta, eat a few meals, and stay in a hotel.   That is a few hundred bucks that are being relocated from knoxville into Atlanta's economy that wouldn't have been there if it weren't for the Braves.  Think of how many thousands of people do this each season when it comes to sports.   I'm only staying one night."
Braves,3d4gn9,speed3_freak,2,Tue Jul 14 01:23:44 2015 UTC,"So you are going to spend some of your disposable income in Fulton County, and when the Braves move to Cobb County in 2017, you'll do the same. But instead of Fulton County getting some money, Cobb County will get some money. A positive for Cobb and a negative for Fulton, all Cobb had to do was offer more incentives than Fulton to the Atlanta Braves.   The Braves are owned by Liberty Media Company, a publicly traded corporation based in Douglas County, Colorado which is controlled by John C. Malone, who is worth an estimated 8.3 billion dollars. Any change in total revenue generated will be negligible, the only difference will be the distribution. And based on the numerous studies that have been performed on the subject the most likely outcome is that both the taxpayers of Fulton and Cobb County will be losers, with the only winner being the Braves, and Liberty Media, and John C. Malone."
Braves,3d4gn9,number_cruncher_1040,5,Tue Jul 14 01:49:33 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree that it sucks for the taxpayers in general, but it's good for local businesses and the county/city.  How many times do the announcers point out how shitty this part of town was before the stadium was built during the road games?  I know the bars in Nashville make bank before and after preds and titans games.   It is extra income for the city and county, and a good chunk of that money stays there to be taxed over and over and over again.  If I bring my dollar to Atlanta that dollar is taxed.  If the waitress spends that dollar on a new mattress it's taxed again.  Then the owner uses that dollar to pay his utility bill, who uses it to fix a tire on one of their trucks who uses it to get a burger somewhere etc etc etc.  Sports teams bring money into the community, and because they bring in so much tourism the cities are willing to offset the costs by building a stadium.  How big of a deal is it to Fulton County that the Braves are leaving?  They're mad because it will affect the counties bottom line."
Braves,3d4gn9,speed3_freak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:33:05 2015 UTC,Cubs stadium   That is the exception.. not the rule. Personally as a neighbor of Wrigley you can go see the White Sox stadium and see the exact opposite.
Braves,3d4gn9,banghcm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:01:31 2015 UTC,"when cities compete to attract businesses it's not uncommon for them to offer incentives   This is also a huge problem because these situations are a race to the bottom in what is effectively a prisoners dilemma. The best strategy for all taxpayers is for no municipality to ever offer any incentives to businesses in order to get them to relocate, but that will never happen."
Braves,3d4gn9,number_cruncher_1040,4,Tue Jul 14 01:15:13 2015 UTC,I would rather pay for a stadium that I am going to enjoy than have it go to other things that I don't give a shit about.

The traffic for the new Cobb stadium will be a fucking mess, and the stadium itself is going to be in the middle of a mall, that's lame as fuck. At least the new Falcons stadium looks unique, it's the one of the reasons we're getting MLS, and it'll get Super Bowls and other big events.

HA...there's absolutely no guarantee of that. Ridiculous claim. Even if we had an amazing team on paper...how many teams were supposed to be contenders this year?
Braves,3d4gn9,ReeceChops44,-26,Tue Jul 14 04:16:31 2015 UTC,"This blind squirrel has found a nut. John Oliver is quite the close-minded liberal, but he did bring up a good point about crony capitalism in sports (although it goes against the progressive mantra: ""what's a little more gonna hurt""). I love the Braves... It really pains me that they're taking millIons of taxpayer dollars, especially considering Turner Field is one of my favorite places in the world. If I were a Cobb resident, but not a fan of the team, I like to think I would move. It really is blatant disrespect for the residents of your area, and while there are surely other things/programs that are useless but paid for with public money, this seems like the hardest kick in the nuts, as a new stadium is obviously not a necessity. And I would say that at least it creates some jobs that are not paid publicly (vendors, grounds crew, etc.), but those jobs currently exist at the Ted."

Braves,3d6ep5,drrhythm2,2,Tue Jul 14 18:01:37 2015 UTC,I think we need some offense but the FO is all about pitching prospects which I think they will continue to pursue for the next year or so.

He's been a stellar teammate and (by all accounts) a model citizen this season.  I have to admit I was skeptical when he was brought on board but he's proven me wrong.
Braves,3d6ep5,Haleion,3,Tue Jul 14 11:25:22 2015 UTC,"With the races being tight and us quickly losing ground I think we should field calls on mostly everyone. I think Maybin may end up gone, his stock may never be higher, Uribe is a free agent at end of season so I think we keep him and try to dump Chris Johnson and then AJ should go and let Bethancourt sink or swim and keep our eye on '17."

That means Johnson, Johnson to Johnson (haha) Uribe, Maybin, Pierzynski whoever.  Even if we get a low A guy with potential upside, that's better for us than just rolling out fill in guys the next 2 months.

That's the question to answer, if the FO believes he can, then they should keep him. If they think he won't ever be better than he is now, then it makes the most sense to trade him. I personally believe he will never be better than he's been the past 3 months. He's chronically injured and never shown he can sustain these on base skills."
Braves,3d6ep5,dtlss22,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:45:55 2015 UTC,he's never shown these on base skills. but his swing is different. his approach. he's always had the tools. i think this might be the Cameron Maybin we continue to see.
Braves,3d6ep5,PickShark,4,Tue Jul 14 01:01:28 2015 UTC,"True, but the risk is he turns into the Maybin of old and you end up with nothing.  It's all about value. If you think you can get something more valuable than Maybin, then you do it."
Braves,3d6ep5,dtlss22,2,Tue Jul 14 01:53:26 2015 UTC,"Thing is, he really doesn't make that much money.  If he puts up 1 WAR a year he's worth his salary.  The upside of him doing this again is tantalizing"
Braves,3d6ep5,illegalblue,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:13:11 2015 UTC,"It's all about how you think he will do going forward. Based on his full career, he's never played this well. He's been great and I love Maybin but if someone offered you a Top 7 prospect for him, I'd probably take it because the goal is 2017 and beyond.   Maybin has a team option for 2017 but even if he plays well, would he be worth a raise that he would demand for post 2017? I'm not so sure, but that's my personal opinion and I've been wrong many many times before :)"
Braves,3d6ep5,dtlss22,2,Tue Jul 14 15:22:02 2015 UTC,"Sell Maybin high, and try to bundle CJ with him. This might be the only chance we have to get rid of CJ, or we might be stuck paying him until 2017. I would say take what we can get for them, but knowing Hart he works a miracle and gets a very promising young pitcher, and maybe another developmental bat. I think this is Maybin's ceiling and it's downhill from here, and again if we can get rid of CJ,we need to so we can be major players in the free markets in the next couple of years."
Braves,3d6ep5,BG1234567,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:35:20 2015 UTC,"I think if we tried to bundle CJ with Maybin, we really wouldn't get anything in return. Its still a good idea though."

I get that Kimbrel is/was a lot more valuable that Maybin, but BJ has a much higher salary and is/was a lot worse than CJ. If they want to get any value out of BJ they're going to have to put him in the chicken suit, because that motherfucker forgot how to baseball. We might come out ahead in a Myabin/CJ trade. Don't under estimate Hart."

At least not for the pieces we can offer.  Unless of course we are willing to give up some high caliber prospects."

Bogaerts could be our full time third baseman. Minor could get a change of scenery and time to recover from his injuries. Jace/Peraza could instantly be the starter at SS or the heir apparent to Pedroia. Tazawa would be a secure spot in our bullpen and be our 7/8 inning guy for a long time. Johnson would be gone. If the trade would be more realistic without CJ + Victorino, scratch both of them.  After the trade, our depth chart would look like this:  C - AJ + Lavarnaway + Bethancourt  1B - Freeman + KJ  2B - Jace (if we traded Peraza), Pedro, KJ OR Pedro, KJ, Peraza (if we traded Jace)  SS - Simmons, Pedro  3B - Bogaerts, Uribe, Pedro  LF - KJ/Victorino, Terdo, Cunningham  CF - Maybin, Young  RF - Markakis, CUnningham  SP - Julio, Shelby, Alex, Matt, and whoever is next in line.

Braves,3d6ep5,ttubravesrock,-2,Tue Jul 14 21:44:52 2015 UTC,"here's one I keep coming back anytime I think about what the braves need the most of, which is young power bats:  Braves Trade: -Luis Avilan -Chris Johnson -Lucas Sims  Yankees Trade: -Aaron Judge -Carlos Beltran  I think this trade makes a lot of sense in a few ways. The Braves have the cash to assume Beltran's contract and get a decent switch hitting option for the rest of the year (plus another, I think) and we get a young guy who can play 1B/OF and is a mammoth of human with power upside comparable to Kris Bryant and Joey Gallo. If there was ever a young bat that's close to being major league ready to deal for, the Yankees would listen to a deal that allows them offload Beltran and get a young pitcher and quality reliever."

Braves,3d6g9o,PWNtimeJamboree,15,Mon Jul 13 22:05:56 2015 UTC,"This is dumb on too many levels.   If you don't want to be ""constantly ducking and weaving to avoid getting hit by foul balls or shattered bats"", you should buy tickets in one of the other dozens of sections available throughout the stadium. That statement (""constantly"") is an exaggeration. If she's going to use that language, it better come with some sabermetrics to back it up, like ""fans hit by foul balls per 9 innings sorted by stadium"". Stop playing on your phone and start paying attention to the game. How come dads can hold a baby and catch a foul ball? Because they were paying attention! Here are two from recent memory:   http://m.mlb.com/video/v109545283/nymphi-dad-catches-foul-ball-while-holding-baby/  http://m.mlb.com/video/topic/63817564/v191361683/ladchc-dads-foul-catch-overturned-after-review"
Braves,3d6g9o,daeys,9,Mon Jul 13 22:24:13 2015 UTC,"so I agree with your sentiments here. I think there's no way in hell she's constantly ducking. that's bullshit.  but here is my sentiment on why the nets should be up:   neither of those dad's catching foul balls with babies were rocket line drives. the 2 people hit this year at Fenway that suffered life threatening injuries were paying attention, but had no time to react.   I bring my glove to the minor league games I go to in my town for protection. I've snared 100+ mph rockets aimed at my face, and I've saved my wife from a few. Had I not had my glove, barehanding it is not much of an option, and people get seriously injured more frequently than should be because of the line drives. I don't think any one has a gripe with balls entering the stands. especially flyballs, because they're so slow that those don't injure anyone unless they're legit not paying attention, which at that point, that's your fault, because everyone around knows its coming. but I'm absolutely in favor of some kind of netting down the lines simply to stop the rocket shots.  The NHL acted very swiftly when a young girl was killed by puck into the stands. If a child gets killed at a baseball game by a linedrive, it will certainly wake the league up and they will have no choice to put the net up. this lawsuit is aimed at preventing that from needing to be a reality to begin with.  again, I agree with your sentiment that her ""citations"" as to why they are filing are ridiculous, but the message behind it is to prevent a tragedy. no one should lose a child for this to become a reality.  as a baseball purist, the thought of nets all the way down the line sadden me. I like being able to reach over and scoop up a foul ground ball headed my way. but if this saves lives, its worth it. no one needs to die over this."
Braves,3d6g9o,Elroy10,2,Mon Jul 13 22:41:35 2015 UTC,Maybe the MLB can hire you to go around the league and protect people with your glove
Braves,3d6g9o,PickShark,6,Tue Jul 14 03:54:06 2015 UTC,"shit if they pay me league minimum, sign me up."
Braves,3d6g9o,daeys,3,Tue Jul 14 04:12:30 2015 UTC,"all the way down the line is beyond ridiculous. theres a point where you absolutely have time to react no matter how fast its going. this is where paying attention begins to play into effect. I think the nets should extend to the end of the dugout and thats it. beyond that, you've accepted the risk of injury by buying a ticket in that spot. you have time to react. you have time to duck and move out of the way. there's a difference in being proactive and being overkill"
Braves,3d6g9o,daeys,16,Mon Jul 13 22:52:22 2015 UTC,"you've accepted the risk of injury by buying a ticket in that spot   This. So much this.  Announcements are made, signs are put up, people KNOW there's the possibility of a foul ball.   You don't accept that risk? Sit somewhere else!"
Braves,3d6g9o,daeys,2,Mon Jul 13 23:14:24 2015 UTC,"yeah I agree with that. I don't think foul pole to foul pole is necessary, but at least past the 1st and 3rd bags would be good. but the nets just being behind the immediate vicinity of home plate hasn't been effective lately. too many injuries to let this go without action.  youre absolutely right though. I don't think they go foul pole to foul pole. but they should absolutely be extended."
Braves,3d6g9o,daeys,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:57:48 2015 UTC,"the nets just being behind the immediate vicinity of home plate hasn't been effective lately. too many injuries to let this go without action.   As in my original message, I would ask whether there are stats to support this statement, or whether it's just hearsay. Has MLB REALLY seen more fans injured by foul balls in 2015 than in other years?"
Braves,3d6g9o,daeys,2,Mon Jul 13 23:16:41 2015 UTC,"i don't know if they've necessarily seen more injuries, but the injuries lately are certainly worse.  i understand that you accept the risks. that's all fine and dandy that they post signs and PSA's and stuff.  But understanding and accepting the risks mean nothing if youre put into a situation where youre powerless to avoid injury. as a paying customer, whether ive accepted the risk or not, the league has an obligation to protect it's customers. in a situation like a line drive, its maybe not preventable (the net wont catch all of them), but at least something is being done by the league to say, ""we care about you, the fan. we care about your safety. we understand that you know the risks, but we also have a commitment to you to prevent an uncontrollable injury.""  a 15-20' high net will catch most hard liners, but will still allow most fly balls to reach the seats. we still get our soveniers, less people end their day at the park leaving on a stretcher."
Braves,3d6g9o,daeys,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:27:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but how is a person powerless? I'm sure the stadium people would be glad to find alternate seating for someone not comfortable with the risks of sitting near the dugouts or down the foul lines, just like airlines allow people to switch out of the emergency aisle.   the net wont catch all of them   Correct, like in this case. So will this generate another lawsuit and then require bulletproof glass instead of a net?"
Braves,3d6g9o,daeys,2,Mon Jul 13 23:30:02 2015 UTC,see: the lady hit with a line drive last week in boston
Braves,3d6g9o,daeys,2,Mon Jul 13 23:31:06 2015 UTC,"If a child gets killed at a baseball game by a linedrive   If an adult takes children to a game and sits them down the 1st or 3rd base line, and the child gets hit, it's negligence on the part of the parent. The adult didn't buy tickets to Disney on Ice."
Braves,3d6g9o,kah88,2,Mon Jul 13 23:21:37 2015 UTC,"that's the dumbest statement in this thread, and its also bullshit.   how many kids sit in those sections? by your logic, all those parents are negligent, or at least, aren't negligent until one gets hit by a line drive. that's asinine."
Braves,3d6g9o,MLBVideoConverterBot,0,Mon Jul 13 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"Dumb, bullshit, and asinine. Thanks! :)  The adult knows of the risk, hears the PSAs about foul balls, and chooses to sit there. If that parent sues the stadium, I'm betting he'd lose that lawsuit. Or do you think a kid dead from a foul ball will result in manslaughter charges for the pitcher? The hitter? The stadium owner?"
Braves,3d6g9o,daeys,4,Mon Jul 13 23:34:47 2015 UTC,"you didn't read the article. no one is suing the stadium, and no one suing for money. the lawsuit is simply ""put up netting."" no one is pursuing charges for anything. no one is trying to paint anyone as a criminal. ""Put up netting."" that's it.   i don't think it needs to go foul pole to foul pole, but as a parent (which im assuming youre not one), a netting at least past the dugout is necessary. no one needs to go to a game and fear where they are sitting. the end.  you can say, ""then move!"" all you want. no one should have to go a baseball game and feel the need to move out of fear."
Braves,3d6g9o,illegalblue,2,Mon Jul 13 23:39:56 2015 UTC,"I read the article. But we've gone down a different path: the scenario where a parent brings a child to the stadium, sits close to the field, ignores the warnings and the child is struck by a foul ball. Hypothetical.  As for the current lawsuit, the lady will lose it as well. The stadium will argue there are many areas considered safe, that unsafe areas are clearly announced/labeled, and will offer to exchange her tickets.   I'm not a parent, but when I go to games I sit in the outfield. When I have kids, I'll continue to sit in the outfield. Avoiding the risk is really quite simple."
Braves,3d6g9o,AnEternalEnigma,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:48:23 2015 UTC,"i think she will lose as well. but i think this is going to show the league that people are dead serious about wanting nets up. if this class action gets enough signatures, whether it wins or not, the league is going to have to do something."
Braves,3d6g9o,Snowmittromney,2,Mon Jul 13 23:51:40 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I fear that a lot of non-fans (i.e. general public, not people who attend games) will sign on, and cause this to become a reality."
Braves,3d6g9o,DataSetMatch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:57:55 2015 UTC,"I agree as well. I just don't necessarily think its a bad thing. again, fly balls will still reach the seats. I don't think it will ruin the fan experience."
Braves,3d6g9o,captbonus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:02:40 2015 UTC,"i know you read the article. and im not saying youre dumb or asinine. but this is not a hard concept to understand for me.  baseball is a family game and a family event. by your reasoning, you suggest that the family aspect be removed by labeling a parent negligent if a kid gets hit with a foul ball. that's not fair to anyone there. why is a netting a point of contention if someone is taken out of harms way?"
Braves,3d6g9o,HoldenTite,2,Mon Jul 13 23:47:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to remove families from games. I'm simply pointing out that stadiums have tens of thousands of seats, some safe from foul balls, and some unsafe. No one is forced to purchase tickets in a specific section.

I have a feeling it is, but when I think about a 38 year old who worked long and hard to make in the majors, and who just really hit his stride in the past two years only to be facing a potential career ending injury, I cannot help but feel something.  This isn't football, where you play sixteen games a year and there are a lot of significant injuries and replaceable parts. I watch a hundred plus games a year, and attend a dozen or so. Often times my wife, son, father in law, brother, friends, etc. share these experiences with me. I say this to underscore the fact that I have an emotional attachment to the team, and even though I don't know the players personally I feel like I have a sense of who they are as people. Grilli seems like a good guy who may have been robbed of something he has worked very hard for, only to lose it forever.  Maybe I'm taking this too seriously. But you have to keep in mind this is a Braves sub, not baseball in general. If you want to discuss strictly serious matters, your in luck because that is what most of our content is.

Braves,3d12iv,Dirty_Mike_n_da_Boyz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:15:14 2015 UTC,"Albies, I hate the fact that people say you need a power hitting third baseman. You need a guy that can defend at third more than anything. I don't see why you need a power hitter at 3rd when you can put a guy there with great defense who GETS ON BASE! I mean that's the whole reason we aren't doing terrible this season because we got guys that get on. I'd rather have a guy that can get on base, shoot the gaps, and hit for average than a guy that hits for power probably be a .260 hitter at best and strike out a lot. (Sound familiar? Sorry Chris Johnson I didn't think of you while typing this I swear.) Having a power hitter isn't gonna do jack shit anywhere in the line up if you can't get people on in front of them. Plus a lot of the times the power hitting third basemen can defend to save their lives. So I'll take a guy that will put up high average, speed, high OBP and defense over a power hitter with bad defense any day. Chipper is the exact type of 3B you want, hit for power, great defense and a career .300+ hitter and a third baseman like chipper is hard to find. Not to mention when Simmons gets older, hey who knows move him to third if Albies becomes a better defender than him, Simmons can hit for power."
Braves,3d12iv,thekidfromyesterday,2,Sun Jul 12 22:52:50 2015 UTC,I like he idea of Albies at third. However by most reports he doesn't have the arm for it.  Also Simmons isn't moving anywhere.
Braves,3d12iv,drrhythm2,2,Sun Jul 12 23:04:38 2015 UTC,"FYI, the Braves are (in the NL):   7th in OBP 12th in slugging Dead last in HR 10th in runs scored 10th in total defense 10th in SB   However, we have the lowest strikeout rate in the league, so I guess that's something. But it goes to show that ""not striking out"" is not the same thing as scoring runs.   Basically, we've been no better than average on anything, and significantly worse than average in most areas.   The bottom line is that we need to score more runs than we are doing right now relative to the rest of the league, period. Whether that happens through power, speed, inversely through defense (preventing other teams from scoring), high-OBP, whatever... we need better hitters, period."
Braves,3d12iv,PickShark,-4,Mon Jul 13 15:33:20 2015 UTC,erm... by all counts chipper wasn't a great defender at 3rd...
Braves,3d12iv,tjorgen1,5,Sun Jul 12 23:13:19 2015 UTC,"I'd argue your perception of his defense was tinted by his later years (after surgeries on both knees).  He was drafted as a shortstop and in his younger years he certainly had the range and arm to play a great third base. And just based off my memory he didn't have a problem catching what was hit to him.  After he got older and his knees blew out he lost a great deal of range, but the arm and glove were still as good as ever and he could still make that signature barehanded play on a bunt try.  Also factor in that he was a very smart player and rarely made mental mistakes or errors on routine plays and I'd say his entire career he was a good, sometimes great, defender.  And he still today probably has more range than Chris Johnson."
Braves,3d12iv,drrhythm2,2,Mon Jul 13 07:13:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much merit to put in these numbers, but if you believe in whatever defensive metric fangraphs uses, Chippers three worst defensive years were 2003, 2001, and 2006, in that order.   His best years were 2005, 1996, and 2008, in that order. In any case, I don't see a lot of evidence that he was really good at first and then tailed off, at least not in those numbers.   Also, tons of athletes drafted out of high school are drafted as shortstops, because that's where HS teams put their best athletes for the most part. Most of those guys don't end up at SS in the majors.   His overall defensive rating is negative but not by much if averaged over his nearly 20-year career.   Offensively, his career is through the roof of course... Also, did anyone know he had a 25-steal season in 1999? Neither did I. Also his career walk rate was higher than his career K rate. That's just sick."
Braves,3d12iv,PickShark,0,Mon Jul 13 15:39:28 2015 UTC,People downvoted me because i said he wasnt great. He wasnt great though. he was average at best and occasionally below average.but his overall value was immense because he was an elite bat. no one can take away his offensive prowess. at all. On offense alone he should be first ballot HoF
Braves,3d12iv,TomahawkDrop,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"He was great at coming in on weakly hit balls/bunts and barehanding them on the throw to first. As he got older, he lost his range - and remember his overall numbers are hurt by his move to LF for like 3 years."
Braves,3d12iv,PickShark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:31:49 2015 UTC,just his overall 3B numbers are below average for his career. its not the LF move. Chipper simply wasnt a great overall defender. He had one spectacular area and an overall deficiency. Again... its like saying Jeter was a good defender because of his jump throw. Though its not a really fair comparison as Jeter was abysmal and Chipper was passable but not stellar.
Braves,3d12iv,drrhythm2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:39:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's fair to say he was a pretty solid average defensively for a third-baseman. And like you said, the offensive numbers just seem otherworldly. .300/.400/.500+ over a 19 year career is amazing.141 career wRC+. 84.6 fWAR. 468 HR. Walked more than he K'd, even in his last season. 8-time All-Star. MVP. If those are not HOF credentials, I don't know what are."
Braves,3d12iv,PickShark,2,Mon Jul 13 18:45:34 2015 UTC,"the .300/.400/.500 is the most impressive of those if you ask me. there are only two active players in baseball that have those career slash lines and one of them (Joey Votto) doesnt even have 5000 PAs yet. The other (Albert Pujols is on the verge of losing it because of his OBP. Chipper did it over 10,614 PAs. Albert is at 9600. he's the best hitter in baseball over the past 15 years. and he may not finish in that elite group Chipper did. that should say a lot"
Braves,3d12iv,drrhythm2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:52:36 2015 UTC,"In fairness to Pujols, I think hitting has become harder over the past five to ten years. In 2006, the NL non-pitcher batting average was .274, and it's been dropping almost every year since. Now it's .256 or so. That's pretty significant.   Some of that may be the ending of the PED era, but some of it may also be that pitchers now simply throw harder. Bullpens are super-specialized and getting the starter out of the game in the 5th or 6th no longer means bringing in a significantly inferior pitcher, at least on many teams. You also have increasing use of defensive shifts.   So it's a bit tough to compare. And I'm not taking anything away from Chipper by any means, but it's just been harder to hit lately."
Braves,3d12iv,PickShark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:07:19 2015 UTC,I think its not his average playing into it as much as his declining ability to walk. at his peak he had a 16.4% walk rate. this season he's at 7.6% his last year with the Cardinals you see him start to decline. Most of it has to do with age i think. but he's really come back this year. I hope he stays healthy enough to get to 700 homers. and i hope he can maintain that slash line. He's been one of my favorite players and i want him to do so well.
Braves,3d12iv,PickShark,-1,Mon Jul 13 19:12:47 2015 UTC,"Rnage definitely matters a lot. Just because they catch what they can get to doesn't make them a good defender. That's what people try to say about jeter at shortstop. Chipper was always a low range defender. At his best he was an average defender.  His career value defensive is negative. But yes, compared to Chris Johnson he was world class."
Braves,3d12iv,PickShark,9,Mon Jul 13 12:43:13 2015 UTC,Neither peraza or Peterson have the arm for full time 3b duties. Maybe a spot start but not everyday. My idea is too crazy to mention now so I'll save it for the future if it seems viable in 2-3 years
Braves,3d12iv,Hugo_5t1gl1tz,7,Sun Jul 12 17:29:53 2015 UTC,Oh come on you've got me intrigued.
Braves,3d12iv,PickShark,13,Sun Jul 12 17:41:41 2015 UTC,"alright. i'll do my best to explain. most people will dislike this.   Lineup:   Ozzie SS Maybin(extend him) RF Freeman 1B future catcher/LF big power guy Jace 2B Simba 3B Catcher/OF profiles like a #3 hitter Pitcher Mallex CF   Simba would fill a non traditional 3B role playing deeper so he has more range. Ozzie would play slightly more to center so Simba can have full range at third. Downside is of course Simba uses glove less, but gets to use the cannon more. Also covers most of shallow LF meaning the LF in question is almost purely a bat guy. preferred high average with 20-25 HRs. Same goes for catcher. Hitters 1,2,5,9 are completely interchangeable in the order to better fit matchups/hot hand. #3 and #7 are as well. #2 and #6 can switch spots as needed. the idea is to create 2 mini orders of 1-3 with a typical cleanup hitter following the first one and clearing the pitcher in the second set. Having back to back leadoff types at #9 and #1 would create a speed conundrum. I would fully encourage rearranging them. this lineup also allows you to move down Freeman if he's struggling to the #7 spot and still fulfill the same role he would at #3. Clearly this is a lineup based on average and ability to get runners over. I feel like Jace has been adequate as a leadoff but nothing stellar. Personally feel he profiles as a #2 hitter much better and think at #5 he can fulfill both duties with relative frequency. probably a .280-.285 hitter there. All in all the lineups average should be at about .280 with the weakest link that isnt the pitcher being Simmons. That being said, the defensive potential is immense as i dont think anything would ever go down the third base line.   Like i said, most people won't agree with me but i feel like it could be productive in non traditional ways."
Braves,3d12iv,OldSchoolMewtwo,11,Sun Jul 12 19:04:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I agree with everything, but holy hell if I don't respect the effort and reason put into this."

Braves,3d12iv,OldSchoolMewtwo,2,Sun Jul 12 22:50:36 2015 UTC,"Well assuming those bats pan out like we hope, I'd be pretty content taking a high average team into the season.  It'd be a good on-base kinda team, which I like."

Braves,3d12iv,waffles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:50:52 2015 UTC,That's pretty reasonable.   Why no Peraza though? Do you think he won't pan out out do you think we trade him?
Braves,3d12iv,PickShark,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:28:56 2015 UTC,i figure he would play into luring a really good catcher in. someone young with power/average combo who's good defensively.

Braves,3d12iv,mcpdizzle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:04:09 2015 UTC,putting the pitcher 8th gives your 7 hitter no cover in the line up which is a problem if he's supposed to profile as a 3. otherwise i like it
Braves,3d12iv,PickShark,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:11:35 2015 UTC,"well the pitchers spot will always be the weak spot in a lineup. also in theory, there will be runners on ahead of the 7 hole guy and if there aren't, teams likely wont pitch around this guy to get to the pitcher. In essence the protection for him is two hitters back because you either get him out or clear the pitcher, meaning the speed duo of 9 and 1 is next. its there to minimize damage basically. if this were an AL team, you throw a DH there at 4 or 8 and its protected as you want."
Braves,3d12iv,mcpdizzle,2,Sat Jul 18 04:15:53 2015 UTC,I follow you. well said
Braves,3d12iv,PickShark,2,Sat Jul 18 04:20:49 2015 UTC,I'd need to make a graphic to show it. On my phone so I can't atm. It involves a lot of lineup/defensive theory and needs some proof from certain prospects
Braves,3d12iv,Professr_Chaos,2,Sun Jul 12 17:47:30 2015 UTC,Jace was a 3B throughout the minors and has played some in the majors as well. He has also played SS in the minors.
Braves,3d12iv,PickShark,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:36:28 2015 UTC,and he wasnt a standout defensively at either one. His MLB 3B experience was really bad and he's below average at SS. Keeping him at 2B is the best course of action

Braves,3d12iv,gvedak,3,Sun Jul 12 21:43:14 2015 UTC,"If you need another named outside of Rio, there is also Carlos Franco who is a bit old for A+ (23). He finally took that step forward with the power this year hitting .257/.334/.425, but more importantly his last 32 games he's hit .315/.408/.546"
Braves,3d12iv,Storm_Song,0,Sun Jul 12 17:22:24 2015 UTC,"I'd say a trade or FA signing is imminent. We really have no capable options internally at present.  I always thought moving Andrelton over may be an option if his bat ever matured. It would allow Peraza and Peterson's bats to grow in the bigs as they battle over one eventual spot until Albies is ready for the other.  I'm still not sold on Jace as an everyday major league caliber bat and Peraza seems like he needs additional time at AAA. Peraza has really cooled off since being tried in center. That was probably a stupid thing to attempt.  As for Andrelton, while he could handle the hot corner, his bat currently would not play well there. Not to mention, they'd be losing his true value as a defensive SS. As crazy as it seems, I could see Andrelton being moved to a team that values his defense more than the Braves.   Sadly, we lack corner power bats in the minors. Without Freeman, we have almost nothing at present in the bigs. Ruiz, Dustin Peterson and Davidson may one day reach the show and aid with that dilemma, but it's going to be awhile.  Kelly Johnson in 2016? Ughh. Kelly has been capable this season, but I don't want him as a starter, particularly at third, where he is very average. Historically speaking, he looks to be playing a bit over his head at present.  Meh"
Braves,3d12iv,Dizzydsmith,-1,Sun Jul 12 18:12:02 2015 UTC,Why not just extend Chris Johnson?

Braves,3d12iv,PickShark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:08:51 2015 UTC,if it weren't for your flair...
Braves,3d12iv,aeps002,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:46:58 2015 UTC,"3B is probably the scariest position for the Braves right now  If Rio Ruiz doesn't work out there aren't any other good options in the system. Guys like Jace, Peraza and Albies could potentially move over to the corner if needed but would be out of position.  Unfortunately there also aren't going to be any good FA 3B over the next two years. In 2015-16 you'll have:  Joaquin Arias (31) Mike Aviles (35) Gordon Beckham (29) Willie Bloomquist (38) Kevin Frandsen (34) David Freese (33) Jonathan Herrera (31) Don Kelly (36) Jeff Keppinger (36) Casey McGehee (32) Aramis Ramirez (38) Sean Rodriguez (31) Juan Uribe (37)  and in 2016-17 there is:  Adrian Beltre (38) Daniel Descalso (30) Martin Prado (33) Justin Turner (32) Luis Valbuena (31)  If the Braves need to make a trade you could take a look at teams that have a blocked top prospect.   The Red Sox have both Garin Cecchini and Rafael Devers, with Pablo Sandoval currently in the way Seattle has DJ Peterson, with Kyle Seager currently at 3B Houston has Colin Moran and JD Davis, both look like good prospects that'll be ready at the same time Arizona has a crowded 3B picture with Brandon Drury, Yasmany Tomas, and Jake Lamb   Outside of all of that, there are prospects who pop up unexpectedly all the time, trades that you would never predict happening, and the international market (rumor is we have a handshake agreement with Kevin Maitan, next years top international prospect who is getting Miguel Cabrera comparisons, although the chances of seeing him in the majors before 2019 are almost 0%)"

Braves,3d12iv,PWNtimeJamboree,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:10:25 2015 UTC,"the FA situation is downright terrifying, and even more scary is the thought that I'll all but guarantee the Braves will make a run for Beckham. Hometown guy, not yet 30, and cheap.  I like the names you threw out for potential trade options. Moran I think is incredibly undervalued after being overshadowed by Bryant being in that same class, and I really like Jake Lamb. I'm hoping Tomas will stick at 3rd so Lamb becomes expendable."
Braves,3d12iv,aeps002,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:11:59 2015 UTC,I don't think Beckham is going to get anything more than a minor league deal this offseason. He's been pretty terrible for 2+ years  I would LOVE to acquire Moran. He's got a great hit tool and I think his power is going to come around to where he can be a 15-25 HR type guy.

Braves,3d12iv,malowolf,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:15:25 2015 UTC,"Rio Ruiz has cooled down. Hopefully he can figure it out and make it up to the big leagues, but if so that will still be years away. Next year we'll prolly make another 1 year deal to a veteran, maybe even Uribe again, and hope that Ruiz or Peterson emerge. If not then we'll probably go for a big free-agent for 2017, maybe Justin Turner?"
Braves,3d12iv,JavaaaaleMcgee,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:56:00 2015 UTC,"Rio Ruiz even though he's off to a slow stary in AA.  Anyone else in our system would be playing out of position. (peraza, albies, etc) But you could play Peterson if we need to."

Braves,3cys9j,Hereforthefunny,9,Sun Jul 12 00:40:01 2015 UTC,"There's a nice retirement package for players with 10 years of service time. Jason still needs well over a years worth of games in order to qualify, but that may be incentive enough for him to attempt a comeback. He was pitching very well before the injury and there should be a desire by the Braves for his services next season, even at age 39.  It really depends on the degree of his injury and if he is willing to aggressively rehab it. I suspect he will be determined to recover while attempting to be ready by spring training. That may be optimistic, though, as it was his plant foot that was injured.  The Braves could opt for some kind of injury settlement, but that would likely only happen if Grilli decided to forego aggressively pursuing rehab and retire."
Braves,3cys9j,Storm_Song,4,Sun Jul 12 01:58:57 2015 UTC,What qualifies as 10 years of service time? He's been in the majors since 2000.
Braves,3cys9j,Xonero,12,Sun Jul 12 02:38:12 2015 UTC,172 service days on 25 man roster or DL = 1 service year  http://www.fangraphs.com/library/principles/contract-details/service-time-super-two/

Braves,3cys9j,jayessaych,4,Mon Jul 13 13:08:40 2015 UTC,I'd put it at 50/50 with his age and all taken into account. If he had finished the year and done well he could have turned it into good cash on his way out. Now though things look rough.

I can think of Uggla's stupid homerun in that fucking terrible 13-12 Nationals game.  See? She breaks my heart. Time and time again. And then? She reminds me of all the other times I broke up with her forever and swore to never crawl back to her stupid sexy self. Just watch. Tomorrow Simba is going to single-handedly turn a triple play or something equally absurd, and the merry go round will start up again."

Braves,3cynrn,JCiLee,12,Sun Jul 12 00:56:49 2015 UTC,"Seriously though, you don't want an infielder to make that catch with his back turned to home plate, in a situation where the runner at third could tag and score the winning run. It should be the outfielder's ball. That being said, Simba is the player best equipped to make that play in baseball."
Braves,3cynrn,obiwans_lightsaber,5,Sun Jul 12 00:31:00 2015 UTC,but simba is not a regular inflielder and with his arm? ill rather have him catch it

Braves,3cynrn,IAMAHORSESIZEDUCK,2,Sun Jul 12 05:27:40 2015 UTC,"Simba's back wasn't to the plate, he was back pedaling at that point. That being said, Maybin was moving towards the plate. If he fields the ball cleanly, he has momentum to make a good throw."
Braves,3cynrn,ggktnx,3,Sun Jul 12 01:52:34 2015 UTC,I don't think Simba had an eye on it. If you watch the replay he really wasn't close. It was a good 10 feet to his right and he was back peddling toward center rather than left.
Braves,3cynrn,Josephw000,2,Sun Jul 12 14:23:55 2015 UTC,definitely would have rather maybin caught that given momentum

The fans and players seem ready and waiting for the break, I hope I'm wrong about the players. They could use the pick me up before the ASB. Except a lot of them could also really use the break because they're slumping bad.   I know one thing. If this Grilli thing happened a month or so ago, it would have been more horrifying dealing with that pen than the one we have now. Roster changes have helped plus it's a lot more stable overall."

Braves,3czifu,burmp,6,Sun Jul 12 14:55:59 2015 UTC,I could see Folty as a closer if he gets his control down.
Braves,3czifu,jdub1418,3,Sun Jul 12 16:10:43 2015 UTC,How about Vizcaino as a closer?
Braves,3czifu,IAMAHORSESIZEDUCK,3,Sun Jul 12 16:25:43 2015 UTC,I'd rather not put my stock in a guy who already missed half the season on a PED suspension.

Definitely won't be making the playoffs. And if they somehow managed it they'd get squashed by the Dodgers or Cardinals.  Suppose it's now time to just enjoy the good things that happen the rest of the way. Like getting rid of Chris Johnson. Haven't been many lately though.  Edit: In all my sadness and anger I forgot to say: best wishes to you, Grilli. You've been a blast to have and I hope your recovery goes well."

I'm a realist, and I think 2017 will be our first real shot at going deep in the playoffs (with good breaks and good pitching, maybe next year).  Even if we make the playoffs this year, there is no way we're good enough to win the WS.  However, if we do make the playoffs, Fredi will get an extension.  Right now the FO obviously has no faith in him leading this team, so why would we want a bad manager to hang on and get another shot?"

Braves,3cvaa7,thekidfromyesterday,3,Sat Jul 11 03:22:06 2015 UTC,"It's amazing that apart from steals, this is all average or on the below average side for Justin.  It would be a career year for Melvin."

Braves,3cvaa7,omglawlz,6,Sat Jul 11 13:41:10 2015 UTC,"Wow, at first I was going to sarcastically reply about how you are crazy for trying to compare the two. However, looking at some of their stats you are right. wRC+ is higher for Maybin, WAR is higher for Upton, K Rate is way lower for Maybin, J-Up actually has 8 defensive runs saved while Maybin has -12 DRS.  Don't get me wrong, Upton is the better of the two, but their performance is closer than I originally thought."

Braves,3cvaa7,Dizzydsmith,6,Sat Jul 11 03:53:35 2015 UTC,Don't know why we held him so often. He stole a good bit with the dbacks too.

Braves,3cvaa7,Froggerto,2,Sat Jul 11 02:57:45 2015 UTC,Ouch. .259 is their best average?

They are solid but not elite and you can look back on JUps whole career and make the same observation. You don't give $200 mil to ""solid"" players. JUp is just not a guy you want to build a team around. He may be very talented but is completely unreliable as a cornerstone piece. His value is in his potential, and we saw how well spending big on potential worked with his brother Melvin."

Braves,3cuyf2,omglawlz,4,Sat Jul 11 00:07:10 2015 UTC,"What, realistically, can a 38-year old 2nd tier closer under a two year contract bring in trade? Certainly not an A-level prospect. I'm not sure ""B"" level prospects are much use to us at the moment. If someone doesn't have a decent chance to be an MLB starter, what's the point of giving up anything to get that person? Maybe we can ""buy"" another top prospect by trading Grilli plus taking on the salary of someone a team doesn't want to get an A- type of position prospect. I dunno. We have some money to spend."
Braves,3cuyf2,drrhythm2,5,Sat Jul 11 14:05:02 2015 UTC,Pair Grilli with Chris Johnson and give them to any team that will take Johnson's bloated contract.

He's never been the deciding factor on any team he's played for.

Braves,3cuyf2,Dizzydsmith,5,Sun Jul 12 05:23:18 2015 UTC,I agree. Only way they should hold is if they go on a tear and Washington slumps over the next 3 weeks. Braves are only 5 back despite the struggles and the division is winnable.

How in the world is this team a playoff contender?   EDIT: Just saying this in general, not disagreeing with Mr. Jammin"
Braves,3cuyf2,drrhythm2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:08:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree completely.  Obviously, I think we're missing Freddie, but even when he gets back, we'll have to go on a complete tear to have any chance.  I guess we'll see where we are on 7/31, but I expect we'll be in a position where moving Grilli is a real possibility.  Maybin too, though I've really come to love him during his time here."
Braves,3cuyf2,C-Jammin,3,Sat Jul 11 14:57:05 2015 UTC,"Maybin is a tough call. He's young enough he could have real value for a while. He has that pedigree of a high first round pick so there is a perception of unlocking the potential of a high-ceiling athlete, fair or not. But, investing heavily in a player because he's had a good half season or even a good full season is taking a real chance. This team can't afford to miss on any more big contracts. We've spent the last offseason and first half of the season getting rid of the dead weight and giving us the financial flexibility to really make some moves. Pairing a Maybin or Grilli with a CJ could free up even more cash (Having $60 or 70 million in cash to play with could do some amazing things) sounds great, but finding a bonafide CF that can hit for average, has speed, and can get on base isn't easy. Too soon to know if Mallex Smith can be that guy.   There are a lot of tough decisions to be made the rest of this year and into next offseason, and maybe even during Spring Training next year.... Grilli, Uribe, Maybin, Johnsons (all of them). What to do at catcher for the long term. Free agent signings? More prospects?   I'm of the opinion that soon we need to start thinking in terms of impact position players. We need two or three to compete with the big boys. 3B, LF, C, and maybe 2B. If we trade Maybin, we have to think about CF as well. Maybe Mallex balls in AAA for the rest of the season, who knows. I think at least two of those positions needs to be occupied by big bats; not necessarily just power hitters, but great overall hitters hopefully with some pop. Guys who can hit around the middle of the order and complement Freeman. I assume those will have to come from free agency, since we don't really have those type of prospects on the farm, at least not in the short term. And whoever we get, we can't miss on. Ruiz may get there, I dunno. Down the road Albies and Davidson and Peraza, if they pan out."
Braves,3cuyf2,drrhythm2,8,Sat Jul 11 15:22:50 2015 UTC,One Joc Pederson please.
Braves,3cuyf2,Unc1233,3,Sat Jul 11 15:54:41 2015 UTC,Would you trade Maybin and Grilli for him?
Braves,3cuyf2,following_eyes,7,Sat Jul 11 17:34:56 2015 UTC,Absolutely that'd be such a steal
Braves,3cuyf2,Drisc0,5,Sat Jul 11 17:54:26 2015 UTC,id trade half the guys we picked up from san diego for him.
Braves,3cuyf2,PWNtimeJamboree,2,Sat Jul 11 17:58:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. I am very high on Maybin having broken through this year due to his work with Walker. Grilli is solid, but I don't see him being our closer past this year anyways. Pederson is hitting for quite a low average this year, but seeing as how he is young and incredibly talented he has plenty of time to develop as a Major League hitter. It would be a tough trade to turn down for sure. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I am convincing myself that the trade would be worth the risk."
Braves,3cuyf2,Unc1233,3,Sat Jul 11 17:55:07 2015 UTC,"That trade would be a literal coup for the Braves and the Dodgers wouldnt even have to think about it. Even before Grilli got injured.  Grilli is a 37 reliever on an expiring contract, compared to Pederson thats basically worth nothing. And Maybin is definitely not as good as Pederson while being much older and much more expensive."

Braves,3cvtqi,Chief_Noc-A-Homa,5,Sat Jul 11 05:00:03 2015 UTC,"No post game thread? I had something typed up:    Kelly likes homerun binges.    First 6 homeruns were hit in a span of 16 games/13 starts Last 3 homeruns were hit in the last 5 games   Though I wonder what would have happened if not for the DL trip.     The thoughts did cross my mind and I didn't want to be the guy to say ""typical Braves"" or ""this only happens to the Braves"". Before the series the Rockies had allowed less than 4 runs in only 12 of 41 home games. They've done it to the Braves 2 games in a row now. If only we could see how much Freddie would have made a difference...  But I had most of that typed out after the game was over and waited to see if a post game went up. It taking so long worked out though because I went back and checked the game logs more and it doesn't seem as bad:  Braves aren't the first team they did this to  and before this series they held the Angels to 3 runs so that's back to back to back at Coors right now.    The Giants on May 23rd/24th (3 & 2 runs) Miami once and the Cardinals twice in 3 conseuctive games from June 7th-9th (all 3 runs a piece)   Even for Coors it's weird seeing how they've allowed 4 runs or more in 29 of 43 games (67.4%) and sorta sucks seeing the Braves held to 3 twice. Especially since the Braves have been hitting  more homeruns lately. 12 in their last 12 games. Three 2-HR games in July so far.      Nats lost again, which is also good and bad when added to the Braves loss."

Braves,3ct4s4,PickShark,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:33:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's more likely he finishes around .290/15/80 than him completely dropping off. And if that's the type of player he's gonna be going forward, yes he's a well above average outfielder. But with our team built around contact, we're in desperate need of some speed (Mallex Smith, 60 steals a year type speed at the top of the lineup). And then we're gonna need a power bat in left field, and unfortunately, Maybin doesn't quite fit either of these needs."

Braves,3crdwr,waffles,2,Fri Jul 10 13:38:22 2015 UTC,Lucky. I have the Cook's Pest Control jingle waking me up at 3:30.

Braves,3crdwr,ttubravesrock,2,Fri Jul 10 06:03:28 2015 UTC,Is there really a good reason Wood couldn't have continued pitching?
Braves,3crdwr,gsueagle24,2,Fri Jul 10 15:25:24 2015 UTC,I'm just guessing here but it can't be good for a pitchers arm to get warmed up then cool off and then try to get it ready to pitch again within a couple hours
Braves,3crdwr,ttubravesrock,2,Fri Jul 10 16:17:40 2015 UTC,"as long as he warmed up again, how bad would it be?"
Braves,3crdwr,gsueagle24,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:57:11 2015 UTC,I'm not 100% sure but as many issues as the Braves have with TJ surgery I don't mind if that's what they were doing to stay somewhat cautious.
Braves,3crdwr,ttubravesrock,2,Fri Jul 10 18:06:00 2015 UTC,Sometimes I wonder if being cautious leads to more injuries.
Braves,3crdwr,gsueagle24,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:54:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, who knows? the weather is looking a little iffy again here tonight so hopefully Shelby Miller gets to pitch without weather issues."

Well during the fifth inning we got particularly rowdy, cheering for every batter, and chopped for every hit, and there was even a guy doing the whistle part to kick off chop sessions, but that's all, just cheering and chopping. These folks at the front of the section started verbally accosting us and taking off their jerseys and what-not. We didn't care, we just kept on chopping.  Eventually some ushers came up and them that if they(the rockies fans) didn't stop yelling at us they'd have to be removed from the game.  We of course boo'd this, cause we saw it in good fun, and loved it, but the next half inning they were gone. None of us complained or felt unsafe, but since we were responding to actions on the field, and they were responding to actions in the stands, they were the ones in the wrong."

Braves,3cpdnu,ChampagnePOWPOW,18,Thu Jul 9 20:35:33 2015 UTC,what
Braves,3cpdnu,SidBreamTrackTeam,5,Thu Jul 9 22:28:06 2015 UTC,It'd be hilarious to sign J up in the off season after getting what we got in the trade for him.
Braves,3cpdnu,FamousTee,7,Thu Jul 9 21:10:49 2015 UTC,Depends on the price
Braves,3cpdnu,burmp,3,Thu Jul 9 21:28:34 2015 UTC,The price will be high and would also cost a draft pick.  Really don't see it happening.
Braves,3cpdnu,vonDriessen,6,Thu Jul 9 22:30:58 2015 UTC,I mean we DO need another power bat.
Braves,3cpdnu,FamousTee,5,Thu Jul 9 23:18:21 2015 UTC,"I agree, but he's gonna be the top free agent on the market.  He'll probably command a $180-$200 mil deal, possibly more.  I would rather them go after a power bat like Wieters instead, although that depends on the price as well.  We've had a lot more success filling needs through trades in the past so that's the most likely scenario."
Braves,3cpdnu,vonDriessen,4,Thu Jul 9 23:48:18 2015 UTC,"Not only is the price going to be insane but Braves aren't likely to make a run at it next year and 2017 will be anyone's guess. A lot of prospects need to make big strides in the next few seasons to know remotely what he have. That said, how many seasons of paying J Up $18+mil/season will be lost on development years for the team?    No chance Upton is a Brave again."
Braves,3cpdnu,Domino80,3,Fri Jul 10 01:47:35 2015 UTC,"Another? Who's the first one? :) (Yes, I guess Freddie counts, but that's about it). Maybe Uribe now."
Braves,3cpdnu,drrhythm2,2,Thu Jul 9 23:54:41 2015 UTC,I had Freddie in mind. He's the only guy I can see hitting 20+ on this team. Simmons maybe in the future.
Braves,3cpdnu,FamousTee,3,Fri Jul 10 00:02:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah Freeman is kinda a tweener. He's hit 23 twice in his career, but I'm not sure I see him hitting 30. His swing seems to lend itself to some topspin, and I swear he hits plenty more balls with enough force, but he just somehow gets that spin on it or just hits so many low line-drives that they don't have a chance to go out. But he's only 25..."
Braves,3cpdnu,drrhythm2,2,Fri Jul 10 00:29:47 2015 UTC,I would want him so bad.
Braves,3cpdnu,Mrb1946,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:09:33 2015 UTC,"Justin has done what Justin does: after hitting .343 with 6 HR in May, he hit .196 with 2 HR in June (and only .130 so far in July). He's also pushing 100 K's already before the All-star break. Just like he's always done, he will carry the team for a stretch then weigh it down the next..."
Braves,3cpdnu,drrhythm2,0,Fri Jul 10 16:58:54 2015 UTC,price is more important than anything. I'm not opposed to J Up because we need a LF guy. but we also dont need to pay too much for that guy.
Braves,3cpdnu,PickShark,3,Thu Jul 9 21:31:53 2015 UTC,"Grilli is a'ight, but I would very much like to have Kimbrel back before 2017. Nothing like the middle of the ninth inning when he's jogging in from the bullpen. Gave me chills every single time."

Braves,3cpdnu,justy98,3,Fri Jul 10 05:06:54 2015 UTC,I will tomahawk chop some necks if this happens.
Braves,3cpdnu,OMTH,2,Fri Jul 10 17:34:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind seeing us trade for Kimbrel, but not for anything near what we got for him. I would rather see us make a run at Justin in free agency. We're going to be major players in the FA market in the next couple of years, with BJ, and Struggla off the books, and hopefully we dump CJ off in a bundle with maybe Maybin at the deadline."

Braves,3cq4n7,PickShark,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:49:51 2015 UTC,He has 5 BB in 12 appearances. That's key. Guys he's replaced were probably walking 5 batters an inning.
Braves,3cq4n7,PickShark,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:52:51 2015 UTC,thats pretty accurate. granted the guy he kicked from the pen was like... Cahill i think. so it wouldnt take much. but as a whole the pen has improved since he was added

Braves,3coplk,BabyEatin_Dingo,2,Thu Jul 9 17:19:20 2015 UTC,But if we agreed to sell the buyers would just flake and never show up.
Braves,3coplk,WilliamMcCarty,34,Thu Jul 9 18:17:33 2015 UTC,I want them to be sellers and I think they will be.  We really just aren't that good.
Braves,3coplk,gobigred3562,20,Thu Jul 9 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"It sucks, but it's what's best.  I think what people need to keep in mind is this: even if we acquired a few quality pieces at the deadline, our ceiling would likely be a wild card, possibly win the division, but not very likely to move past the NLDS.  We're really not that close to seriously competing with the Cardinals, Dodgers, or Nationals in a postseason series.  The future looks as bright as it ever has.  There's no reason to jeopardize it for another short playoff run."
Braves,3coplk,CLSmith15,5,Thu Jul 9 17:57:27 2015 UTC,"The postseason is about who is hot.  If we can make a push at the end of the year to win the division (or even nic a WC spot) that will mean we've bested the Nats quite a bit down the stretch, so counting us out of a playoff serious against them makes no sense.   Yeah we'd probably lose to the Cardinals, but so will everyone (odd year sorry Giants). If you think we're a few quality pieces away from winning the division then buying is mandatory."
Braves,3coplk,AmericanYidGunner,6,Thu Jul 9 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"The postseason is about who is hot   That's only true to a certain extent.  Look at the records of recent World Series champions on July 9th of the year they won it:   2014 SFG: 51-41, +23 run differential 2013 BOS: 55-37, +85 run differential 2012 SFG: 46-40, -8 run differential 2011 STL: 48-43, +24 run differential 2010 SFG: 45-41, +52 run differential 2009 NYY: 51-34, +71 run differential 2008 PHI: 49-43, +77 run differential 2007 BOS: 53-34, +89 run differential 2006 STL: 48-39, +15 run differential 2005 CHW: 57-28, +75 run differential   Contrast that with:   2015 ATL: 42-43, -25 run differential   It's not like these teams came out of nowhere, they pretty much all either had good records or a good run differential, and in most cases they had both.  We're lagging far behind most of those teams already, and I'm sure most of those teams added one or two quality pieces at the deadline too.  Sure, anything can happen in the playoffs.  But is it worth trading away the future, which looks incredibly bright, for a slim chance of even winning the NL?  I'd much, much rather hold on to our prospects and take a really good shot at a deep playoff run in a couple of years."
Braves,3coplk,CLSmith15,2,Thu Jul 9 20:21:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't disagree, I'm just weary of always looking at making a deep run 'in a couple of years'.  Sounds like the fucking Cubs."
Braves,3coplk,AmericanYidGunner,2,Thu Jul 9 22:35:27 2015 UTC,It works though.  Cubs would be a playoff team if the season ended today and will probably be better next year.  Royals and Astros have the two best records in the AL.
Braves,3coplk,CLSmith15,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:13:02 2015 UTC,"Sample size much? Those are exceptions to the rule, and historically horrid franchises."
Braves,3coplk,AmericanYidGunner,0,Fri Jul 10 00:12:10 2015 UTC,"They were historically horrid because they kept trying to buy and making every year a year to win it all. Now that they have taken some years to build, they are finally back to contending."
Braves,3coplk,JanThaMan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:29:48 2015 UTC,"This is a great analysis. I'd add that we are 10th in hitting out of 15 teams, and 9th in pitching. Now, those ranks may go up one or two spots having improved the bullpen and made moves like adding Uribe, but realistically we are a middle-of-the-road team, which is actually pretty great for this year.   We have a lot of great talent in the minors; I think we drafted well too. We just signed three highly rated international free agents. The only thing we are missing are power bats in the minors. So we have talent to bring up for the future and/or to trade. Hart has been masterful so far; let's let him continue to carry out his plan."
Braves,3coplk,drrhythm2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:02:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And I'm not sure, with the NL Central the way it is, we could even feel confident about getting that wildcard spot if we did try to become buyers. It seems it's just time to be focus on 2017 in Suntrust Park, I guess."
Braves,3coplk,cmcsalmon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:54:46 2015 UTC,"There is no reason to buy honestly . We aren't going to win this year with the team currently constructed even though we are ""in contention"" and we have been, since the start of this past offseason, looking to build a team of young promising players for 2017 and beyond. Why mortgage that for a long shot is near impossible anyways? We have a solid group of prospects but depth and insurance are all invaluable in a rebuild."
Braves,3coplk,Professr_Chaos,6,Fri Jul 10 23:30:34 2015 UTC,"Any player who is on a 1 year contract (Grilli, AJ, Uribe, KJ) and has decent value should be shopped.  The Braves arnt winning the World Series this year and have said for months that fielding a serious contender in 2017 is the plan.  Anyone who won't be here next year but who could bring talent back for the future HAS to be traded.  I think the FO has to asses the inflated value of Maybin as he's having a career year vs the possibility of him regressing next year.  They were burned by CJ's career year and if they could get a couple good prospects for him or even one good MLB ready pitcher then I think you have to consider it.  If they hold onto him and he can't replicate this year then he'll be gone by '17 anyway and with nothing to show for it."
Braves,3coplk,Gr33nV3lv3tCak3,3,Thu Jul 9 17:42:14 2015 UTC,"of course Maybin's success isn't BABIP fueled like CJs. This year his LD% and HR/FB ratio have both improved significantly, while raising his walk rate and (somewhat) cutting his strikeout rate. And he has stayed healthier than he has ever been (knock on wood). Remember, there's a reason he was drafted ahead of McCutchen (though still a mistake by the Tigers no matter how you look at it)"
Braves,3coplk,PickShark,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:01:13 2015 UTC,"there has been a rise in BABIP, but that has to do with the increased LD% so its not abnormal or anything. I love the dude. hope he stays and continues to improve"
Braves,3coplk,Gr33nV3lv3tCak3,2,Thu Jul 9 21:48:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I meant to say no unexplained rise in BABIP. When you hit better BABIP goes up, but it goes up in a more explainable and sustainableway."
Braves,3coplk,drrhythm2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:51:08 2015 UTC,I think Grilli has a 2-year deal
Braves,3coplk,drrhythm2,2,Fri Jul 10 00:19:48 2015 UTC,Your right.  I got his deal and JJ's confused.  Still.  If he could bring a B to B+ prospect I think it would be a deal worth considering.
Braves,3coplk,drrhythm2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:35:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah - I mean part of the reason we picked up Grilli and Johnson was because they would be flippable pieces at the deadline. I'm just starting to think that we have enough ""B"" prospects (pitchers and fast guys, anyway). We need to find a way to get some young hitters with some pop too..."
Braves,3coplk,drrhythm2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:00:00 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the Braves track record of producing impact position players (beyond catchers and shortstops) over the last 15 years is rather poor.  I'm not sure if the players they would be willing to part with at this point could net a return of a realistic ""power"" hitter of any renown."
Braves,3coplk,thekidfromyesterday,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:28:28 2015 UTC,"At first I didn't entirely agree with that - just offhand, I thought of a few impact position guys outside of catcher and shortstop:   Freddie Freeman Jason Heyward  Adam LaRoche Jeff Francouer   Of course Chipper had 3B blocked for a long time.   But looking at our drafts since 2000, it is really bad how few of our top picks ever reached the bigs. I mean, impact players are few and far between, and also I would imagine we were typically drafting on the low end since we generally had good overall records, so it isn't like we've had the first pick every year like the Astros did for a while.   I think this track record is why we have to change our scouting philosophy some. The 2015 draft seemed to go well, but only time will tell."
Braves,3coplk,C-Jammin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:53:05 2015 UTC,"On second thought, I could have included 1st base in my list as the organization has had a pretty decent lineage from Kelsko (originally a firstbaseman) to LaRouche, to Freddie.  However, I'm still not sold on including Frenchie on your list because beyond his rookie year he never put together a solid season where I would consider him to be a consistent ""impact"" performer.  Heyward similarly had a great rookie year followed by several inconsistent to disappointing years (though he seems to be blossoming in St Louis). Chipper would be included in the ""old"" class of 90's players so he and the likes of Javy, Klesko, Giles, Justice, etc... would not be included.  There will always be the occasional outlier but my premise is still sound.  The Braves, outside of 3 positions, have not been able to produce quality, above average major league players.  I agree that their success in the 15 year run had a lot to do with them drafting lower and getting fewer ""blue chip"" draft picks but they still seemed to find good to great pitchers in those same slots.  Other teams (the Giants, Cardinals, Red Sox) over that same span have pretty consistently developed quality position players all over the field despite drafting in similar rounds as the Braves.  Why is that?  My theory is that some teams and organizations simply excel in scouting and developing certain positions or skill sets.  The Braves have proven over the last 20 years that they can find and develop quality pitchers, catchers, and shortstops with the occasional 1st baseman.  Their track record with outfielders and the rest of the infield is more spotty.  Teams like the Cardinals always seem to have a stable of good position players coming up with the occasional pitcher too.     Then there are the teams who rarely develop more than one or two impact players every four or five years...at ANY position.  Those are the fans I feel sorriest for.  Consequently those are also usually  same teams who we frequently read about having made GM, Team President, and Minor League Director changes.  The can't build a ""culture"" or a ""way"" because the vision keeps changing.  This is a looooooooong winded way of me saying that I'd glad the Braves have been so good at what they do (pitching) and hope that with the new leadership (and a restocked system) they can shrewdly acquire the positional talent to fill the holes the organization hasn't developed."
Braves,3coplk,thekidfromyesterday,2,Fri Jul 10 15:15:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah we actually had a bunch of total bust draft classes in the early 00's. Even the late 90's, IIRC. I don't want to go back and look through them all but there were several years in a row where I've never even heard the name of a single signee.   I have to disagree about Heyward. He's absolutely been an impact player. He's accumulated something like 24 WAR and he's only 25 years old. Just because we thought he would be all-world and instead he's only been runner-up Rookie of the Year, an All-Star, and a two-time gold glover, doesn't mean he wasn't ""impact."" Those are the credentials of an impact player, and are why the Cards gave up a good pitcher and good prospect to get him for one year.   Frenchy is a tough call. He's had a 10 year MLB career, hit almost 150 homers, and definitely had three solid seasons. So, some impact, but definitely marginal at best overall. But you can't compare Heyward to Frenchy; it's not even close.   But you are definitely right that we have not produced a homegrown, impact player at 3B (since Chipper), 2B, CF, or LF for a long time.   Also, Kelly Johnson was a Braves draft pick in 2000 if you want to throw him in the mix.   Here are the Braves first picks each each 2000 through 2012:   Adam Wainwright (Hit that out of the park, but we all know what happened there. 36 bWAR, may be the most of any Braves pick in this range).  Macay McBride Jeff Francoeur (McCann was 2nd round, 3rd pick overall that year) Luis Atilano (Saltalamacchia was 1st round, 2nd overall pick) Eric Campbell (2nd rounder, no first round pick in 2004) Joey Devine (Yunel Escobar was 2nd round, 3rd overall) Cody Johnson (Medlen was 10th round pick that year) Jason Heyward (hit on this pick for sure in 2007, Freeman was 2nd round, 4th overall) Brett DeVall (Kimbrel was 3rd round, 4th overall) Mike Minor (okay not bad, David Hale was 2nd pick) Matt Lipka (Todd Cunningham was 2nd, Andrelton 3rd, Gattis 23rd) Sean Gilmartin Lucas Sims (Alex Wood second)   So have those been acceptable results for our top picks every year? I mean, I guess they are not as far off as I thought; statistically only about half ever make the majors. Still, Wainwright, Heyward, and Minor (maybe Frenchy) were the only impact guys."
Braves,3coplk,C-Jammin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:47:09 2015 UTC,"I think my opinion towards Heyward is unjustly shaded by my disappointment in his never developing into the second coming of Hank Aaron that we all hoped he would be.  Unfair though it may be, I (and many other Braves fans) really wanted him to become one of the alltime greats (like Chipper) and have a 15+ year career anchoring the Atlanta lineup.  Alas,... it was not to be.  He was really good in the time he was here, madingley inconsistent with his hitting, but stellar in the field."
Braves,3coplk,thekidfromyesterday,9,Fri Jul 10 16:49:03 2015 UTC,"Just trade Avilan, Grilli, and Jim Johnson."
Braves,3coplk,following_eyes,2,Thu Jul 9 16:16:30 2015 UTC,Trade our only 3 relievers that have been decent (despite Avilan's implosion yesterday)?
Braves,3coplk,C-Jammin,2,Thu Jul 9 17:59:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, could get good prospects for them. This team isn't going to compete and they are our biggest trade chips outside of Maybin."

Braves,3coplk,drrhythm2,3,Fri Jul 10 00:42:54 2015 UTC,"I hope we keep at least one of the Maybin/Markakis duo, and I really hope we keep both. I know we have Mallex and Peraza on the way and Braxton Davidson in 3-5 years, but who's to say Mallex or Peraza won't struggle when they get up here? Even if we keep Maybin and either Peraza or Mallex jack a spot from him, Maybins $$ isn't so much that him being a bench option or platoon outfielder is unrealistic.   All that considered, I'm down for a Peraza trade for a power OF/3B bat, either current MLB roster or prospect."
Braves,3coplk,PickShark,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:26:04 2015 UTC,"I'm hesitant to trade Peraza mostly because what we need isn't really out there. They players that are prospects tht profile as a power OF/3B bat are either untouchable: (Kyle Schwarber, Joey Gallo, Corey Seager, Miguel Sano) or are on teams that don't have any reason to move them (Josh Bell,  DJ Peterson, Aaron Judge) or are too young to make a quick enough difference (Austin Meadows and Clint Frazier). That level of prospect is what we would ask for Peraza and no one is going to give us that."
Braves,3coplk,SidBreamTrackTeam,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:20:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not even sure anyone would trade us one of those guys straight up for Peraza, just because legit power plus average is so hard to find, and it tends to be overvalued anyway."
Braves,3coplk,PickShark,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:23:38 2015 UTC,"That's was my point. That's what we would ask for, but no one would say yes."
Braves,3coplk,SlurmsMcKenzie13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:52:26 2015 UTC,"I think it's going to be hard to trade a speedy, slap-hitting type of player (even a really good one) straight up for a legit power-hitting prospect, even if they are ranked nearly identically. Teams seem to put a lot of extra value on the long ball (chicks dig it). What we need is the next Freddie Freeman or Brian McCann or Adam LaRoche, and I don't know of any teams that are willing to trade prospects who look like they can hit like that, at least unless they get a huge return."
Braves,3coplk,PickShark,3,Fri Jul 10 00:22:37 2015 UTC,"personally, i think it should be a limited sell, with a focus on getting players who are very close to the major league level. Even if that means they aren't projected superstars in 4 years. but serviceable starters with maybe a bit higher ceiling. I say we trade Grilli, Avilan, and try to of course get rid of CJ. Be willing to part with a prospect in that trade... like Peraza. Keep Maybin. He's a great player, and theres honestly a good chance he continues to produce for the remainder of his contract. If we sell Grilli, it helps to kepp JJ around so we still have someone to close games fairly consistently. I don't think we should trade AJ, because then we have no catcher at all. Beth has proven he can't handle the Show yet. and Lavarnway can't catch every game. Keep KJ as the backup 1b for when Freddie is back and as LF. other than that we don't need to do much more to the team"
Braves,3coplk,drrhythm2,8,Thu Jul 9 17:31:57 2015 UTC,Trading Peraza would be a mistake.
Braves,3coplk,PickShark,9,Thu Jul 9 19:11:07 2015 UTC,completely disagree. He's blocked and a lot of teams would pay a kings ransom for him.
Braves,3coplk,drrhythm2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:31:53 2015 UTC,Who's blocking him?
Braves,3coplk,PickShark,0,Thu Jul 9 21:28:08 2015 UTC,Jace is for the forseeable future. Maybin and Mallex are in center. And he doesnt have the arm for 3B. so he's blocked
Braves,3coplk,drrhythm2,4,Thu Jul 9 21:32:45 2015 UTC,"I'm still not sold on Jace. So far below average offense with above average defense, resulting in a pretty average MLB player. Now, that's a huge improvement over Uggla, but if our top prospect is a 2B how do we not give that guy a chance just because someone else is average-ish?   Jace is 25; he's not going to fill out much more, though he may learn more and improve at the MLB level. However, Peraza is a young 21 (four years younger than Jace) and isn't exactly lighting up AAA, but he's the fifth youngest player in the league, and is definitely holding his own, hitting .285 with 3 HR and 23 SB. Hell, if he was a year older he'd STILL be in the youngest 15 players in all of AAA. So he's got the rest of this year and all of next year to show that he can be an impact player.   Anyway, it's hard not to think the kid has plenty of potential. If we trade him, we better be getting a lot of value in return."
Braves,3coplk,SlurmsMcKenzie13,-1,Fri Jul 10 00:17:55 2015 UTC,"i disagree that he's below average offensively. As far as second basemen go, he's about average offensively and above average defensively. Historically, second baseman will have a wRC+ collectively of about 90. Jace is at 93 this season. in 2013 it was 91. I guess with some freakish years from people like Jason Kipnis and Brian Dozier having a monster year, it makes Jace seem worse than he is. I also really think he'd benefit from not leading off. Like I said, his approach really benefits from defenses having to hold runners. He'll finish the year out obviously as a leadoff guy, but if Mallex is ready next year I see him playing elsewhere in the lineup and seeing a spike in productivity at the plate. In the handful of Gwinnett games i've been to, nothing Peraza has done has blown me away so i guess I'm just not as sold as anyone else is on him. I just feel Jace has a lot more to show us right now. He's a lot stronger than his power numbers show and I think its more a matter of refining technique."
Braves,3coplk,PickShark,2,Fri Jul 10 00:33:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, well you are right if you are comparing him to all second basemen. I guess I'd prefer to have one that was a little better - .254 / .334 isn't exactly killing it, but it's not the worst. Could Peraza do better? I don't know.   This may not be a fair comparison, but when Jace was 24 (last year) he hit .311 in AA and .306 in AAA, although he also did it with a 10%+ walk rate, which he's maintained with the Braves.   Peraza's numbers as a 20 year-old in AA were about as good as Jace's in AA four years older; however, Peraza's walk rate hasn't been as good. Peraza hit for a higher average, but lower OBP because of the walks.   I guess the question is what will Peraza do as he grows into his frame? Also, can he change his approach or develop his eye to walk a little more? Again, as the 5th youngest guy in AAA there has to be substantial room for improvement.... but, you never know when a guy is gonna hit his ceiling."
Braves,3coplk,hearthebeard,0,Fri Jul 10 01:58:36 2015 UTC,"I just really like what Jace has done for us and i really think that with more time under Seitz he'll improve as a hitter. I really think he has more power in his frame that he hasn't unlocked yet. Mostly driven gappers for doubles, but still more power than we've seen."
Braves,3coplk,PickShark,2,Fri Jul 10 02:58:30 2015 UTC,Well we shall see. Peraza isn't ready yet in any case. I'm sure he'll get another look in spring training next year if he isn't traded before then. Hopefully Jace does keep improving. Having too many good players is a great problem to have.
Braves,3coplk,malowolf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:55:09 2015 UTC,I highly doubt Jace will be our 2nd baseman for the near future. He's good but not good enough to keep long term.
Braves,3coplk,JustHitTheBall,-1,Thu Jul 9 21:38:06 2015 UTC,the job is his until he loses it. I am also 100% confident that his skill set is better suited to being a #2 hitter. he's batting over .300 with men on base and has a wRC+ of 155 with men in scoring position. Also has a 182 wRC+ in high leverage situations. Jace Peterson is here to stay. It would take Peraza coming up and consistently hitting .350 to supplant him at this point. There was a reason he got moved to center for a while.   edit: downvote me for using facts. classy
Braves,3coplk,DCTiger5,3,Thu Jul 9 21:41:38 2015 UTC,"Um, hitting with men on base is not a skill in comparison to your overall hitting. Players don't suddenly hit like an all star just because a runner is on. Jace will be a career .260ish hitter who walks and plays excellent defense. He's very, very good. And probably someone who can stick as a starter.  Your small sample size ""fact"" is not good evidence for you position. Especially when it's not needed.Besides, Maybin could move to a corner spot to give Peraza center or vice versa. Peraza has Jacoby Ellsbury written all over him we'd be nuts to trade that guy cause there are a couple other people on the MLB roster that play his position."
Braves,3coplk,HighKing_of_Festivus,-1,Thu Jul 9 22:29:21 2015 UTC,"well... its more that his hitting approach is well suited to having men on because it forces the defense to play differently. thats why he's had more success with men on. I would imagine moving him back in the order would make him more of a .275-.280 guy with the same excellent defense. I know the high leverage thing isn't something that can be controlled, but it certainly shifts the public opinion and managerial opinion on a player. As far as Peraza goes, I'm sure he'll get a shot at the show unless we get a good OF prospect who is nearly ready. But depending on what they do with Maybin, Mallex interferes with his outfield potential. I personally think they should shop him hard for a team controlled LF guy. thats the big piece we're missing."
Braves,3coplk,thekidfromyesterday,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:01:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's tough to call us buyers or sellers, like a lot of the other teams I think we'll ultimately be both. I imagine our #1 goal is getting a young catcher who's either Major League ready or very close. Possibly also a young power bats at 3B or LF who might stick around past this year, and possibly an experienced relief pitcher.  Also, we'll be trying to dump Chris Johnson's albatross contract, and might take advantage of desperate teams at the trade deadline to do so.  Most likely I see AJ, Uribe, Jim Johnson, and Kelly Johnosn going, but possibly Grilli, Maybin, and Avilan if we get a really great deal.  Also think some of our young pitchers like Foltynewicz and Perez could be shopped, especially if they are paired with CJ."
Braves,3coplk,general_relative,-1,Thu Jul 9 19:59:45 2015 UTC,"I expect to see AJ, Uribe, Grilli, Maybin, Jim Johnson, Avilan and Kelly Johnson all shopped.  Even Markakis will probably be involved in rumors."
Braves,3cr7wu,mcpdizzle,3,Fri Jul 10 03:10:27 2015 UTC,"No team in baseball is ""a go"" for the playoffs because they signed one player.  In reality, if a lot of young players/rookies over perform for their age, Teheran regains his ace form while Shelby and Alex keep it up, and the bullpen gets a shot in the arm of reliable pitchers then we'll at least be in the conversation next year."
Braves,3cr7wu,tjorgen1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:28:25 2015 UTC,"What about this year? So what, everybody else thinks we have no shot. We're sitting around .500 right now with multiple series against weak opponents. I'm not saying that we WILL make the playoffs, but the way things look, I'm willing to acknowledge it as a possibility. What are your thoughts?"
Braves,3cr7wu,Brave392,2,Fri Jul 10 23:50:32 2015 UTC,"I think if you take a gigantic step back and look at it from a grander perspective the odds of the Braves making the playoffs in 2015 are very slim.  Sure we can nitpick minute details about the rosters of the Braves, nats , and mets to see how Atlanta could find a way to the top of the NL East, but the truth is it would take the Nats playing vastly below their talent level and the Braves likewise playing above their talent level for the rest of the season for the Braves to get into it.  Now, one of those options happening is certainly possible, and has happened plenty of times before, but the odds of both of those situations coming to fruition is slim to none. That's why they would call it a miracle if we made it. It's possible sure, but it would take a miracle.  After we wrap up this first half we're through with the easiest part of our schedule. We had three series against joke teams and we've lost a few winnable games in the series. We just aren't winning enough when the Nats and mets are losing, hence we're stuck.  Also keep in mind that the trade deadline is 20 days away, or about 15 games. We're currently 5 back and 3 under .500. If at the end of these upcoming games to close out July we play .500 or even better, we are still locks to sell if the Nats just keep up their pace. It would take an insane winning streak coupled with a tough stretch for the Nats for the braintrust of the Braves to even consider the possibility of winning the NL East and buying. Again it's possible, but it would take a miracle, which you shouldn't get in the habit of counting on.   By August 1st the Braves will almost certainly have shipped out all of the players who have vastly exceeded expectations this year (Grilli, AJ, Uribe, J Johnson, K Johnson, and probably Maybin) and seeing as how they are the reason the Braves have overperformed so far this year, things are looking bleak by the time August rolls around.  In 2016 I anticipate we'll be a fringe playoff contender (a la 2010 Braves) who may snag a wild card, and by 2017 as our prospects blossom I'm counting on us to return to our place as a dominant force in the NL for years to come."

Braves,3cpj9f,Xonero,5,Thu Jul 9 21:51:34 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the spectacular plays are tied to him having had some shitty defenders around him. Jace, Uribe, and even Kelly Johnson are so much better than Uggz, La Stella, and CJ."

Braves,3cpj9f,AlabamaBravo,4,Thu Jul 9 23:34:38 2015 UTC,old man Uribe can pick it at 3rd. i think having two great defenders on either side has allowed him to play at a different depth so he gets to a lot of plays differently. having Jace with his incredible range at second helps even more. so he's not had to save everything this season. but the cannon and glove are both still there. as we've seen when he's had to use them
Braves,3cpj9f,PickShark,3,Thu Jul 9 19:38:26 2015 UTC,Near Andrelton? That's where ground balls go to die.
Braves,3cpj9f,evildeas,2,Thu Jul 9 19:43:40 2015 UTC,"By Inside Edge Fielding he is doing very slightly better on routine plays, a little bit over his career average (but less than last year) for between 60-80%.  Quite a bit worse than usual for 10-40%, but that could change just by making one or two plays with the sample sizes here.  1-10% is about the same.    None of that is incredibly useful, but the more interesting note is that he has somehow had zero opportunities with a 40-60% chance.  Which he normally makes at a  ~80% rate."
Braves,3cpj9f,ancalagor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:08:46 2015 UTC,"What makes me appreciate Andrelton the most are those balls hit to his right where he can still throw a laser right to the chest. When I played SS before I got moved to LF, I just remember being fucked anytime I had to field one in the hole. He makes every fucking ""routine"" play look so much more routine than it should be. Seriously, watch almost any other major league game and how their SS plays, then watch Simba. He fields circles around even elite defending shortstops."

Braves,3cmumg,CLSmith15,2,Thu Jul 9 16:43:02 2015 UTC,Reminds me of this time he dicked a Strasburg heater a foot above the zone
Braves,3cmumg,Xeno4494,3,Thu Jul 9 18:05:33 2015 UTC,I will never not watch a replay of an Evan Gattis dinger. I love his swing and I don't know why. Genuinely fun player to watch
Braves,3cmumg,ihaveasthmar,3,Fri Jul 10 04:14:46 2015 UTC,I hate that the only reason he's not on the team is because the NL doesn't have a DH. He and AJ could have been an awesome combo this year with Gattis playing C on that 5th day.

Braves,3cp3lg,thekidfromyesterday,5,Thu Jul 9 17:13:11 2015 UTC,"Probably not with this organization. The writing seems to be on the wall. Personally I think he was mismanaged. I love what AJ has done for us this year, but they needed to give Bethancourt every opportunity to be the starter and instead took this stupid ""earn your playing time from the bench"" approach. I don't know if it was upper management, Fredi, or both, but they never really committed to giving him a chance. Very few 23 year old rookies are going to do well when given irregular playing time.  Especially when he knows there is very little chance of him ever being called on to pinch hit when he isn't starting because his manager thinks pinch hitting your backup catcher is the worst thing imaginable. No shit he's going to mentally check out."
Braves,3cp3lg,santa_91,2,Thu Jul 9 20:25:59 2015 UTC,This is exactly how I felt about the entire situation. Even when AJ cooled down he still kept playing him.
Braves,3cp3lg,Mrb1946,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:31:14 2015 UTC,"I think it was going to be that way until we realized we still had a chance at the division. At that point, development was out the door. If the Braves start really falling out of the division, I think/hope they will bring him back up to continues his development."
Braves,3cp3lg,malowolf,2,Fri Jul 10 00:37:00 2015 UTC,"Probably not, but who else do we get? I did some research when I was bored and there's just not a lot of good young options for an everyday player. The A's have 2 catchers having great years who are under team control for a while: Stephen Vogt and Josh Phegley. Unfortunately, A's may decide to keep both and move Vogt to 1B or OF instead of trying to get value in a trade.  It's also not clear if Phegley is having a breakout season or just a fluke first half given his lack of AB's.    Then there's the Blue Jays, who have Russell Martin signed through 2020.  That leaves top prospect Max Pentacost without a path to the majors, so it's likely he's dealt this summer for a Major League pitcher. Unfortunately Pentacost is only playing at A level and is a couple years away from the Majors, so he wont make an immediate impact.    There's even better hitting prospect Kyle Schwarber of the Cubs, but given his lack of defensive ability he's likely to be promoted strait into the OF for the Cubs next year.    Then of course there's Lucroy of the Brewers, but they've already told the Braves no.    Maybe Hart will find some diamond in the rough?"
Braves,3cp3lg,malowolf,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:07:11 2015 UTC,"Well I'd love to have Pentecost, even though he's a few years back. If we somehow get Schwarber he's our future LFer."

I think that since we are not going to be in the playoffs this year we should give him August-October as the every day catcher as a ""this is your chance"" type of opportunity. If he sucks as the everyday catcher then maybe we trade him in the offseason. If he thrives then we keep him."

Braves,3cp3lg,PickShark,5,Thu Jul 9 17:42:22 2015 UTC,"His defense and play behind the plate is exactly why he's in AAA and why AJ got the bulk of the starts. The Braves have been on a rollercoaster ride with the pitching staff all year and AJ has handled that well on the field. It was too much on Bethancourt's plate. Also, look how much better Teheran has been with Lavarnway the last few weeks."

A few guys took a couple pics then stopped. Jenkins did about 20 different hilarious poses then decided he wanted one jumping.

Braves,3cllhh,Dizzydsmith,5,Wed Jul 8 21:31:28 2015 UTC,"lel i didn't realize it was that same guy, i remember seeing that in the GDT from the other day  it's a shame because prior to this series i didn't really have any ill will towards the brewers fanbase... i even lived in wisconsin for a while and just didn't pay attention, i guess. it's definitely not like i hate them now but i definitely no longer have an interest in going there for away GDTs, even though they have an excellent OP box score thing going on (which GDTs here would benefit from!)  but yeah, unironically whining about being downvoted by a perceived horde of butthurt fans of an opposing team is remarkably stupid"
Braves,3cllhh,well_fuck_that,2,Wed Jul 8 21:36:54 2015 UTC,"To address the box score thing: we opted for just the box score + highlight video links because we've been told numerous times by numerous subscribers that our GDTs are too long causing lots of scrolling...

Braves,3cllhh,Dizzydsmith,4,Thu Jul 9 04:32:16 2015 UTC,"I could add a little context (without trying to rekindle anything), to me the annoyance comes down to the fact the we suck hard this year. There is not that many people coming into the GDT's day after day, so  there is a decent rapport that has built up between the guys that are there every day. Now, its cool when someone from another sub comes in to ask a question or get our opinion on something (thats really all the Marlins did last year) it usually goes over really well, everyone gives their opinion and a discussion might break out. When you guys show up in greater numbers than we have, and start treating it like your own GDT it really detracts from the back and forth that we usually see. That compounded with the fact that there was a few people towards the end of the game yesterday that were downvoting us cheering for our team in our sub really took it over the edge.   Hopefully that makes some sense and is not too ramble-y or demeaning. Let me know if you have any questions, but I'll probably not respond to bait to try to keep things civil(ish)."
Braves,3cllhh,allonbacuth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:54:53 2015 UTC,"Completely understandable. Our sub is going through a little of the same thing, in the sense that this is one of the largest baseball subs on reddit- but I assure you the game threads aren't nearly as active as they were when we were in first... Which is something that has annoyed me a bit, but it happens. Before we would have threads with 1,000+ comments for a home game. Now it's closer to 100-200.   As far as downvoting in the game thread, that shouldn't have happened. There's no reason anyone should be downvoting in a game thread, unless there is a rare instance of someone being completely out of line. Hell, I didn't even downvote jn when he got all whiny when I brought up Braun (which was a 100% genuine question, and I appreciated that multiple people replied truthfully). How he couldn't understand that Braun winning the MVP and then being hit with a positive PED test right as he took his ascent to the best player in baseball wasn't a unique situation is beyond me, but even still- I don't really care. I said what I had to say to him and that was it for me. Hell, if you go back through the thread you will see that I applauded multiple plays by the brew crew, and I know others did as well. Good baseball is good baseball, and I appreciate it regardless of whether it's by my team or another.

I want to make it clear that I in no way represent /r/brewers as a whole, I just thought I would share my thoughts. Shit happens, and its under the bridge now.

Braves,3cllhh,Tater_Rock,4,Wed Jul 8 21:31:52 2015 UTC,"i feel like singling him out allows him to continue to bask in the weird ""being persecuted on reddit by braves fans"" complex he seems to enjoy, but yeah. i don't think it's just him, but he was definitely pretty vocal about it."

Braves,3cllhh,jn2010,4,Thu Jul 9 01:32:43 2015 UTC,I'm no Avilan fan but he's been one of our most reliable relievers this season. Even after today his FIP and xFIP are below 3.50. 7.5 Ks per 9. 2 BB per 9. He's been fairly good. Surprises me too.
Braves,3cllhh,Xonero,5,Wed Jul 8 21:29:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but when he's bad he loses games."
Braves,3cllhh,Tater_Rock,7,Wed Jul 8 21:32:14 2015 UTC,Just like all our other pitchers.
Braves,3cllhh,Xonero,3,Wed Jul 8 21:32:41 2015 UTC,You can't expect Avilel to have his best stuff everytime he goes out. Fredi should have taken him out before he got to Gomez.
Braves,3cllhh,ChupaChalupa,2,Wed Jul 8 22:28:31 2015 UTC,I agree you can't always have your best stuff. Avilan was pretty unlucky today with those 2 weak hits. But it happens. Can't hate the guy for it.
Braves,3cllhh,Xonero,2,Wed Jul 8 22:33:10 2015 UTC,"stats-wise he's okay, i agree, but his seemingly limitless capacity to fuck up under pressure should keep him at AAA until he figures that out. just my take, though."

Braves,3cllhh,FamousTee,3,Wed Jul 8 22:41:41 2015 UTC,That one stung
Braves,3cllhh,DPerman1983,3,Wed Jul 8 22:37:09 2015 UTC,"This team is as infuriating as they are enjoyable. There's more than this but I can remember 3 series off the top of my head that we should've swept but didn't. Padres 4 games, Mets 3 games after that, and this series. We should be 10-0 in those but we're 5-5. We were in control of all of the games and only pulled out 5 wins. Drives me insane."
Braves,3cllhh,Xonero,3,Thu Jul 9 00:50:59 2015 UTC,Plus that God awful Dbacks series. Couldve definitely been a sweep
Braves,3cllhh,Snowmittromney,2,Wed Jul 8 21:24:50 2015 UTC,"We should have one of the best records in baseball, but we don't. This bullpen is incredibly frustrating."
Braves,3cllhh,itstevens,3,Wed Jul 8 21:27:23 2015 UTC,"lefties are hitting .295 against Avilan this season. I don't see a reason to keep him.  He leads mlb in appearances and Fredi left him out to dry today. If not gone by tomorrow, I think he will be when Mckirihan comes off suspension"
Braves,3cllhh,aaronaroma,8,Wed Jul 8 21:59:51 2015 UTC,If anybody needs to go it's Fredi. You'd think bullpen management was fucking Calculus or something when it's left up to him.
Braves,3cllhh,Xonero,3,Thu Jul 9 16:06:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I was saying there are like 4-5 fresh arms in the pen. Avilan has been over used. Just don't get it what Fredi is thinking.
Braves,3cllhh,aaronaroma,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:31:58 2015 UTC,Avilan's gotten super unlucky against lefties (last time I checked they had a BABIP over .400) and super lucky against righties. He'll even out to being the ok LOOGY we've all grown to resent.
Braves,3cllhh,vslyke,3,Wed Jul 8 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"Isn't the post game generated by a bot? Just curious, because sometimes it can take a pretty long time. I know some people bitched about burmp's upchop threads, but I know personally after watching the game and talking in the game threads- it's nice to post/read thoughts on the game afterward. I guess I'm really needy, but 15 minutes or so can feel like an eternity. Hell- it could have been 5. Maybe I'm just in a bad mood"
Braves,3cllhh,Dizzydsmith,3,Wed Jul 8 21:39:36 2015 UTC,"yeah this seems to be handled all by a bot running a script  my assumption is that it takes a while to cull the information from mlb.com and assemble it into thread-ready format but it's kind of weird that it can take a really long time for seemingly no reason. also, they used to be stickied."
Braves,3cllhh,well_fuck_that,2,Thu Jul 9 04:12:11 2015 UTC,"The reason they aren't stickied at the moment is because of the contest thread. Once the contest is over, it will go back to being stickied."
Braves,3cllhh,tlott,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:39:21 2015 UTC,"They are, in fact, generated by a bot. The quickness of the creation is something that I don't know nor do I understand. This is a better question for /u/Chiggie, since he created it. I do know that it takes info from different places online, so maybe it has to wait for those sites to update for it to trigger creating the thread? I don't know. I'm just guessing."
Braves,3cllhh,tlott,3,Wed Jul 8 21:47:35 2015 UTC,"Wait, wtf we lost? The Br's at the start of our team names really messed me up. When I saw That Avilan sucking I was like ""well atleast we're still up 6-5"", but what the hell??? We lost?"
Braves,3cllhh,jknox94,5,Thu Jul 9 14:27:52 2015 UTC,"I said this in the Brewer's GDT, hope no one minds if I transcribe it here:  Avilan has fucked up multiple games for multiple seasons now. He must belong to someone high in the Braves organization as either their long-lost kid or their scandalous secret lover, because he's not playing for this team for the results he gets, that's for sure."
Braves,3cllhh,LiueOriginality,5,Thu Jul 9 14:26:52 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, he hadn't allowed a run in 9 appearances before today, and while I could only listen to the radio, it sounds like both singles were weakly hit flairs. Now, yes, the home run hurt, but if those two shitty singles are hit any harder and could be outs, then we still have a one run lead. IIRC, the last time he gave up a run it was the same thing, a ball hit so weakly on the infield that the runner reached, and then a weak pop up that just fell into no man's land. I mean yeah, he has blown a couple leads, but lets not act like he is getting shelled every time he takes the mound. His era is 2.97 era+ is 128 and FIP is 2.87. (All stats prior to today)."
Braves,3cllhh,Hugo_5t1gl1tz,3,Wed Jul 8 21:45:03 2015 UTC,And the homer wasn't a bad pitch either. Sometimes the hitter just wins.
Braves,3cllhh,drrhythm2,5,Wed Jul 8 21:25:32 2015 UTC,The singles were weak. It's not Avilan's fault Fredi left him in against Lucroy and Gomez.

Braves,3cgjns,GREENstjl,39,Tue Jul 7 19:07:37 2015 UTC,I've never seen a player lobby like this not to be traded at the trade deadline. Be interesting to see if he does get dealt
Braves,3cgjns,patrickclegane,21,Tue Jul 7 19:53:20 2015 UTC,"When a player finds a place they have success in especially in a smaller sample size and are comfortable I can understand not wanting to be traded to someone who is looking for you to provide the bump to their play off hopes. Right now he is having fun playing baseball again, something he probably hasn't experienced in a while and with years remaining on his deal he is really a bargain for his production and defense at the price if he can keep it up."
Braves,3cgjns,cman1098,9,Tue Jul 7 19:56:37 2015 UTC,"Another one as relayed by Andre Aldridge during the game:   ""I only want to be an Atlanta Brave. I love being in Atlanta.

Braves,3cgjns,thatshitlerscanoe,28,Tue Jul 7 22:41:28 2015 UTC,Cam Cam has healed the wound left by Heyward being traded.  I don't wanna be hurt again :(
Braves,3cgjns,FamousTee,14,Tue Jul 7 20:14:59 2015 UTC,"By the way, Heyward did what he always seems to do: he started hitting again after a really bad start. After hitting .217 in April he hit .284 in May and .326 in June, raising his overall average to .280. Hes also hit, I think, 9 HR. He's absolutely destroying left-handed pitching.  We got an All-Star pitcher, but the Cards got a hell of a RF. Actually, Heyward's WAR as a position player is identical to Miller's as a pitcher right now."
Braves,3cgjns,drrhythm2,21,Tue Jul 7 21:22:40 2015 UTC,You are absolutely right.  The difference is we don't have to pay Miller a 200M contract after this year to keep him in a Braves uniform for the forseeable future.
Braves,3cgjns,kleptorabbit,10,Tue Jul 7 21:53:38 2015 UTC,"Yep, exactly. If Miller stays healthy and keeps performing, it will be an awesome trade for the Braves. Plus if Jenkins happens to work out down the line..."
Braves,3cgjns,drrhythm2,6,Tue Jul 7 22:30:40 2015 UTC,But we got more years of control and Jenkins. We destroyed that trade.
Braves,3cgjns,Dizzydsmith,4,Tue Jul 7 21:54:24 2015 UTC,"Meh, if the Cards win the world series and Heyward hits close to .300 I think both sides destroyed that trade"
Braves,3cgjns,KaptainKoala,3,Wed Jul 8 04:46:43 2015 UTC,"No disagreement here. Just happy that J-Hey is doing well again. I hope he gets paid big time. Preferably, not for the Cards, but I hope he gets his money for a good team and has a great career."
Braves,3cgjns,drrhythm2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:31:37 2015 UTC,I would be so happy if J-Hey got paid in a Red Sox uniform
Braves,3cgjns,Crotalus_B,4,Wed Jul 8 03:22:39 2015 UTC,He could hit 40 homers a year in Boston with that short wall in right.
Braves,3cgjns,Hugo_5t1gl1tz,3,Wed Jul 8 03:44:55 2015 UTC,"I know. In situations like these I root ABTY.  Seeing him stick it to the Yanks would be glorious.  The Sox are my familys team, and my favorite AL team so it would be a win/win if coming back to the Braves isn't possible."
Braves,3cgjns,Crotalus_B,2,Wed Jul 8 03:49:12 2015 UTC,I went to a game in Boston where Heyward hit TWO homers. Best day ever.
Braves,3cgjns,Aviator157,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:23:06 2015 UTC,"i would bet that Heyward gets hurt before the end of August. also, he'll cool off and hit like .250 in the final two months of the season. just my guess. nothing against the guy whatsoever, but just a prediction."
Braves,3cgjns,gaylordfocker08,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:59:18 2015 UTC,So his season has been almost identical to Maybin's.

Braves,3cgjns,illegalblue,9,Tue Jul 7 20:45:56 2015 UTC,Could we move him to left when Mallex comes up? There seems to be a logjam at CF but I'd love to keep Maybin.
Braves,3cgjns,Itypedthesewords,12,Tue Jul 7 21:13:31 2015 UTC,Maybe to Right and have Markakais move to LF. That would be a powerful OF.
Braves,3cgjns,cman1098,14,Tue Jul 7 21:18:08 2015 UTC,"Powerful not so much as in power-hitting, but a good defensive outfield that should hit for high average for sure."
Braves,3cgjns,drrhythm2,7,Tue Jul 7 21:24:12 2015 UTC,Yes I meant defensively. HAHA I can see how that can be confusing.
Braves,3cgjns,cman1098,2,Tue Jul 7 21:35:47 2015 UTC,The thing is that he's generally been a good fielder in the past... what's happened?
Braves,3cgjns,drrhythm2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:28:29 2015 UTC,I'm going to choose to ignore the stats here. He's made some great catches and I've only seen him make 1 big mistake that I can think of.
Braves,3cgjns,Aviator157,2,Wed Jul 8 12:49:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can agree - I always thought he seemed fairly solid out there. Maybe I'm just happy he looks like he gives a fuck, unlike BJ."
Braves,3cgjns,mycrystalcity,4,Wed Jul 8 11:24:12 2015 UTC,I like that even more.
Braves,3cgjns,Itypedthesewords,3,Wed Jul 8 19:28:15 2015 UTC,Then where we put Peraza will be a mystery.

Braves,3cgjns,cman1098,4,Tue Jul 7 23:38:15 2015 UTC,Sounds like he grew up a fan of the Braves. Who wouldn't want to play for their favorite team?
Braves,3cgjns,following_eyes,6,Wed Jul 8 01:25:06 2015 UTC,"Lots of crazy talk from Buster Olney and others about the Braves moving him before the deadline.  I hope it's just crazy talk.  After the Melvin Upton Experience, Maybin has been a breath of fresh air.  We need to establish a core of good bats with fielding.  Trading him for farm prospects would be a mistake, IMO.  Oh and his deal only pays him $16M over the next two seasons, the last one being a team option for $9M.  I think you hold onto a guy like that and try and fix the atrocious bullpen."
Braves,3cgjns,casmith07,3,Wed Jul 8 01:56:42 2015 UTC,"Man, I hope we don't trade him. On top of him being awesome for us this year, and seeing him so happy where he is, I watched him when he came up thru the minors, playing for my local minor league team. The fact that he's playing for my favorite MLB team, and playing well, means it'll hurt even more for me if he goes."
Braves,3cgjns,grgriffin3,5,Tue Jul 7 21:58:01 2015 UTC,"Dont get me wrong, I love what Cameron Maybin has done here. But hes owed a bunch of money and hasn't really been good the last couple years to back it up. I was ok with him being traded, until I saw this. Dammit."
Braves,3cgjns,odingb4,3,Wed Jul 8 02:02:08 2015 UTC,"Not often do you get a player for next to nothing and have his mentality and performance completely turned around, all whilst he seems to love the city. I could see it going either way, and I trust the FO to make the right call"
Braves,3cgjns,Snowmittromney,2,Wed Jul 8 03:07:19 2015 UTC,I'm gonna be pretty damn sad if he's traded now. Braves Country loves him to death.
Braves,3cgjns,ZarxcesHappyLand,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:51:15 2015 UTC,"Maybin has turned into a pretty good all around baseball player and those are hard to come by. You don't trade players like Maybin, you keep them."

Braves,3cikw0,stickhorse,6,Wed Jul 8 04:46:56 2015 UTC,"I really like Maybin, but if the front office receives a very good offer for him I would completely understand if they decided to trade him.   The only scenario in which I could see myself disagreeing with a trade would be if we shipped him away for only a modest return, like a couple of fringey prospects, utility man, middle reliever, etc. I don't think that is  a very likely scenario, but that is the only one that I could see myself disapproving of the move.   With that being said, I fully trust John Hart and Coppolella to make the right move if they are presented with the opportunity to do so."
Braves,3cikw0,mrpizzacoli,5,Wed Jul 8 15:10:40 2015 UTC,"For me, the worst move we could make is Maybin + CJ salary dump for very little in return. I really don't think we'd do that though"
Braves,3cikw0,Snowmittromney,2,Wed Jul 8 16:07:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree I don't think a CJ+Maybin dump is very likely.   I think Hart will ultimately have to attach some prospects to CJ if they are serious about moving him. Who knows though, maybe a serious contender will suffer multiple injuries to 3B and bite the bullet for a shot at the title this season. I don't think that is very realistic because CJ does have a pretty horrendous contract, but a man can dream."
Braves,3cikw0,mrpizzacoli,9,Wed Jul 8 17:58:09 2015 UTC,"This is a tough one. We have a guy who is playing the best he has ever played and is finally living up to his top prospect status. Not only is he playing well, but he wants to be in Atlanta. For those reasons I feel like we should keep him.   On the other hand he is having a career year after being in the majors for for 9 years. He could very well be playing above his ceiling which is why we should trade him.   The main thing I look at is that this will be only his THIRD FULL SEASON. For that fact alone I would hang on to him for one more season and see if he can reproduce his numbers. At the worst we lose out on some prospects that may or may not ever produce for us and pay him 8 mil next year."
Braves,3cikw0,Tater_Rock,3,Wed Jul 8 13:26:48 2015 UTC,I don't know... part of me thinks the guy has figured something out; part of me thinks he's getting a little lucky and that a .348 babip isn't likely to continue. It's a tough call. He may well be at his max value right now. Or... maybe he plays like this for the next four years. Hell if I know.   I wonder why his defense this year has been rated so poorly compared to all of his previous seasons? Is he a little slower?
Braves,3cikw0,drrhythm2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:18:15 2015 UTC,I've been wondering the same thing.  He has a few missed plays that didn't count as an error but should have been a PO which might be hurting his advanced defensive metrics a bit.  But I don't think explains why the metrics have said he's been a below average defender this year.  By eye he looks good.
Braves,3cikw0,general_relative,2,Thu Jul 9 15:34:29 2015 UTC,"Plz don't trade my bae!!! Right now, guaranteed he gives a huge discount to stay in Atlanta. Extend him while he is still cheap. This would have been the prospect you would be looking to trade him for anyway. The guy was widely heralded as THE TOP prospect coming out of the draft. Sure, he's 28 and just now putting it together fully, but he's also just now fully buying in to a system. Before, he was going off of what other coaches thought- but he didn't buy into it- so he couldn't reach his full potential. Now he buys into the hitting theory and mechanics being coached to him and he is all ears. And oh, by the way, he was all ears before he was even with this coach. This dude is finally clicking and it would be a shame to trade him unless we got a HUGE haul."
Braves,3cikw0,Dizzydsmith,2,Wed Jul 8 17:44:08 2015 UTC,"At some point I still question what the end game is to trading good players.  I get trading a few bad ones, or prospects, or throwing in a good one with a horrible one to try to clear a heavy contract.  But, I think Maybin is too good to be bait in a C. Johnson trade, and I'm not sure who else we would get that would be much better right now.  I feel like trades should be to fill holes in your team, and Maybin isn't a hole.  I'd like for them to keep him, or at least wait and see how the new guys handle the Majors before making a decision."
Braves,3cikw0,Chiggie,2,Wed Jul 8 15:50:26 2015 UTC,"You also trade from depth.  Atlanta presumably has 3 CF's behind Maybin is Peraza, Smith, and Eury.  If they can move him and CJ AND get a good return back, I'd be all for it.    Although, with LF being a black hole, I would prefer they move Maybin to LF, and promote Peraza or Smith.  Keep CJ until he can be moved on his own.  At the very worst, he can be used against LHP where he thrives.  It also wouldn't hurt to have some insurance for 3B since AA has been tough on Rio Ruiz."
Braves,3cikw0,jwoodell3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:36:20 2015 UTC,"Let's keep looking to the future, IMO. After seeing Hart work miracles I say move him. Maybe pair him with CJ, and see if we can get a solid return for him. Most of us were ready to burn down Turner Field after watching Hart move J-Hey, Gattis, and Kimbrel, but seeing the return we got for them has been tremendous, and we have all seen the light.  We have Peraza and Mallex right around the corner to replace Maybin. It would be nice to see some more prospects in our farm system. Having Hart with us has made me greedy as far as prospects go. I am from Richmond, Virginia. I got to see the Braves farm system at it's peak first hand. I would love to see it again.   Also remember all the homegrown talent Hart brought talent Hart had on those 90's Indians squads... Lofton, Baerga, Thome, R Alomar, S Alomar Jr, Albert Belle, Manny, Richie Sexson, and Omar Vizquel (am I forgetting anyone?) all went through there. Now he teams Scherholz and Copelella. That's a hell of a brain trust. I would love to see them build some squads like that for us."
Braves,3cikw0,BG1234567,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"I the only one that gets a half chub imagining an outfield consisting of markakis, mallex, and maybin?  I like that as much as I did Up, Up, and a Hey( at first. Not after the collapse)"
Braves,3cikw0,mdbrockman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:09:14 2015 UTC,What's the chance at trading CJ + Maybin for Brad Boxberger or Adam Ottavino?
Braves,3cikw0,Ayce22,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:23:29 2015 UTC,Ottavino is hurt and the Rays would never take CJ's salary
Braves,3cikw0,jwoodell3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:37:28 2015 UTC,"For the love of God keep him. He's finally proving himself and he loves being on the Braves. I'm tired of building for the future for the last 10-12 years. He's major league ready now and the Braves can contend this year. They are firing on all cylinders right now and trading him would be a huge loss. The talent pool in MLB and MiLB is large, it's just a matter of putting the right ingredients together to make a successful team, and Maybin can be a key guy in Atlanta for a few years. The Braves system obviously works for his style and approach to the game."
Braves,3cikw0,DPerman1983,6,Wed Jul 8 11:18:04 2015 UTC,What do you mean the last 10-12 years? We were one of the best teams in baseball 2010-2013 and half of 2014.
Braves,3cikw0,SidBreamTrackTeam,3,Wed Jul 8 12:14:06 2015 UTC,"We've spent the last 10-12 years trying to win every year, and all we've gotten is a bunch of early round playoff exits at best. What we were doing wasn't working.   Right now we are 10th in the NL in offense and 9th in pitching. That's not a playoff contender. Our record may show that we are not out of the race, but our numbers so far this year don't look anything like what you'd expect from a top-level team.  Do you really expect that we can go up against the Dodgers, Cards, Giants, or even Nationals in the post-season and have a realistic chance of winning? The Dodgers have hit more than twice the homers (we are last in the league), and lest you think power means they don't get on base, they have a higher on-base percentage as well (as do four other NL teams).   I'm not trying to be all down on the Braves; what we've done this season is remarkable considering what we've traded away. Listen, if we go 8-1 or 7-2 against the Cubs, Dodgers, and Cards after the AS break, come back and talk to me. Maybe my mind will be changed. But I'd be really surprised if that's the case.   So if we get a really, really good offer for Maybin, we have to consider it. We are conditioned to think short-term trends are going to continue. Remember 2013 CJ that contended for a batting title?"
Braves,3cikw0,drrhythm2,-1,Wed Jul 8 13:17:42 2015 UTC,"What Maybin has been able to accomplish to this point has been incredible, but the question is: is his success sustainable? I'm sure many fans, myself included, liken Maybin's offensive outburst to Chris Johnson's in his first season in Atlanta. Is that fair? No, there's 78 games left to play, and if Maybin can put together a consistent 162, he may deserve more credit. Getting rid of Chris Johnson's contract, I would assume, is the top priority for the front office at this time. Let's say the Braves are able to move Maybin and CJ to Minnesota for Torii Hunter and a reliever (JR Graham, anyone?). That would allow them to call up Mallex Smith, see how he performs at the highest level, and let him learn under an all-time (at the least, defensive) great ballplayer. This would be a risky move. But, at the same time, so would be hoping that Maybin can stay productive and healthy, while also moving a potentially game-changing piece to rid ourselves of CJ's contract. In short, everyone loves a guy that actually cheers for the team he plays for. Unfortunately, in this situation, the front office needs to realize where Maybin's real value lies."
Braves,3cikw0,ReeceChops44,5,Wed Jul 8 13:46:30 2015 UTC,The thing that keeps coming to mind for me is how he says no one in the past ever really worked on his swing and how he had been studying Seitzers style prior to even knowing he was going to be a Brave.   I'm no coach or mgr but this says a lot to me about his future as a Brave. I think they feel like they have opened up a can of Maybin mayhem on the MLB and will do everything possible to keep him.
Braves,3cikw0,IAMAHORSESIZEDUCK,-1,Wed Jul 8 14:32:31 2015 UTC,"It sounds like I'm saying Maybin is gonna crash and burn and it's only a matter of time, but I really do hope you're right. He does have a sweet contract for this level of production."
Braves,3cikw0,ReeceChops44,0,Wed Jul 8 18:22:27 2015 UTC,"He does have a sweet contract for this level of production.   He's a top notch defender and is like 4th or 5th in the league with clutch hits and runners in scoring position. Plus he seems like a very likeable, approachable guy that does well in the dugout and with the youngsters. I think they will keep him."
Braves,3cikw0,IAMAHORSESIZEDUCK,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:54:51 2015 UTC,"Mallex killed it a A and AA, but is off to a slow start in AAA (though probably due to low babip). He's only a young 22 and I'm not sure he's ready for a call-up. But, if we think he's the CF and leadoff hitter of the future, then this is a plausible scenario. It's just a tough call. Maybin could realistically be a very solid CF for years to come, though at some expense."
Braves,3cikw0,drrhythm2,-1,Wed Jul 8 16:15:37 2015 UTC,It's a risk either way. John Hart has made some pretty good decisions thus far; I'm sure he'll do what's best for the team here. I just feel like it can't be understated how vital it is to get rid of Johnson's contract.
Braves,3cikw0,ReeceChops44,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:43:16 2015 UTC,"So we owe CJ 16.5 million for 2016 and 2017? Yeah, not good. Not exactly back-breaking either, but not good. Not nearly as burdensome as BJ or Uggla's deal.   Let's say we did get rid of him. What do we do at 3B next year? Stop-gap free-agent? Take a whack at trying Uribe for another season if he'll agree to it? Don't think Ruiz will be ready for a starting role for a while if ever. He's a young 21, but struggling thus far in AA."
Braves,3cikw0,drrhythm2,-1,Wed Jul 8 17:51:02 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering if Ruiz is gonna be mentioned in any trades. Seems like the organization is headed toward giving up on him, so it would make sense to deal him before his stock drops too low. And as far as a replacement at third moving forward, shedding $16M is a step in the only direction. We're gonna have to throw some money at either a LF, 3B, or a C, while trading for another one of these positions and most like calling another up from the minors. And I don't think we have to worry about Hart picking up a stopgap; from this point on I don't see them picking up any contact without at least a team option for 2018."
Braves,3cikw0,ReeceChops44,4,Wed Jul 8 18:07:55 2015 UTC,"Wait why do you think the organization is giving up on him? After half of a season in the minors? He's barely 21...   We are going to have some money to spend for sure, though I'm not sure how much we will spend next year. I think /u/vslyke said we only have 50-60 million committed to next season, so that should give us room for a significant free agent or two if we want to go that route.   Our starting pitching is really, really young and cheap. Wisler and Banuelos are Rookies, T-rex is on his long-term deal, and Wood is under team control for three more years.   I'm going to be really interested to see what Hart does at the deadline."
Braves,3cikw0,drrhythm2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:39:20 2015 UTC,"Yep, just under $60MM as it stands. Of course that could go up or down."
Braves,3cikw0,vslyke,0,Thu Jul 9 04:45:54 2015 UTC,"Whether or not you think they'll give up on Ruiz depends on if you think we're rebuilding for 2016 or 2017. I'm of the former, and I was under the impression that Rio was packaged to give us some cheap power in '16. He hasn't shown that yet (I'll admit he still has time to do so, though). We are gonna have more cap room to play with than any year in recent memory. That being said, the most powerful catcher we're gonna find is most likely Lucroy, and I'm afraid I'm drawing a blank as to available outfield power, so if it were me, I would shop around for a 3B. Maybe I'm just being stubborn and am still looking for that replacement for Chipper. But, there's a lot to be excited about in Braves country, starting pitching most of all. Even if we do trade a few prospects (and Teheran), we're still loaded. Hart has set a firm foundation and I can't wait to see what's next."

Braves,3cfpsg,joelbozo,3,Tue Jul 7 19:44:10 2015 UTC,Me too. I really hope he pitches when Rome comes back to Charleston. It's going to be a weeknight game anyway so it doesn't matter to me.

Braves,3cfpsg,SicSemperTyrann,8,Tue Jul 7 17:58:17 2015 UTC,Isn't he only 19? Can you imagine being 19 and possessing a 98mph fastball and 88mph splitter? I think his main project is improving control. But maybe a 2017 debut isn't out of the question.
Braves,3cfpsg,Dizzydsmith,14,Tue Jul 7 19:06:58 2015 UTC,"I had a dream last night where I was fucking around at some sort of training facility with friends and hit 97mph then 101mph.   I'm 30 years old and was pretty psyched that I had a chance to make a roster. I woke up pretty upset that it was just a dream. So yes, I'm more than a little jealous of this kid, and can't really imagine what it would be like to have that be reality.  Not really totally relevant, I guess, but I'm still salty at myself and needed to tell someone."
Braves,3cfpsg,drrhythm2,11,Tue Jul 7 21:30:52 2015 UTC,"Haha, I had a dream 2 nights ago I went to the Ted and my gf asked me to throw in that little ""how fast can you throw"" cage. Long story short, I threw 107, 107, 109. Then the guy taking money at that station called in some team personnel and I threw for them in the bullpen. I hit 111 mph. Needless to say, I got signed to a 2 year $10mm deal and got a $10mm signing bonus. Life was good. Then I woke up and realized my life still sucked. Shit sucked."
Braves,3cfpsg,SicSemperTyrann,5,Tue Jul 7 21:49:50 2015 UTC,You need to go watch The Rookie.
Braves,3cfpsg,drrhythm2,4,Tue Jul 7 21:43:34 2015 UTC,"I've seen it, but am just sad that in reality, I'd probably be around the 75mph area :("
Braves,3cfpsg,SicSemperTyrann,3,Tue Jul 7 23:01:32 2015 UTC,75 is harder than you think. I'd probably blow out my arm trying to hit 65 at my advanced age of 37.
Braves,3cfpsg,illegalblue,2,Tue Jul 7 23:10:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know it's fairly hard, but the last time I threw totally not warmed up I think I hit 72.  I like to think I'd get to 75 with a little preparation."
Braves,3cfpsg,drrhythm2,2,Wed Jul 8 00:04:03 2015 UTC,"His control is insanely raw.  If we were projecting him for nothing but the pen, that'd be reasonable.  He's probably 18/19"
Braves,3cfpsg,PickShark,2,Tue Jul 7 20:39:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking best case if he magically figured out his control. But you are right, 2018 or 2019 assuming he avoids all the pitfalls along the way."

Braves,3cfpsg,gvedak,3,Tue Jul 7 19:27:21 2015 UTC,Does anyone ever think some players just hold back in hopes that they get traded to a team they like?  Edit: I probably should've clarified that I wasn't referring to minor league players and that the article made me think this could be true for some Major League players that make big turnarounds after a trade.
Braves,3cfpsg,speed3_freak,12,Tue Jul 7 16:39:25 2015 UTC,"I think he's just trying to save face after being blasted by nearly everyone for such a dumb trade.   The whole ""we have added more power arms so we felt that we could trade him"" thing was unreal. You don't trade young arms that throw that hard, with a CB as good as his for a utility infielder."
Braves,3cfpsg,gvedak,4,Tue Jul 7 16:44:22 2015 UTC,"They didn't trade him for a UI, they traded him to get BA's contract off their books.  It was just a dumb trade on their end, but I still think that they didn't like Touki or they wouldn't have traded him.  Basically the braves paid $14 million for a raffle ticket.  That raffle ticket could (looks good) be worth a hell of a lot more than $14 million which is why they did it, but the D'bags didn't do it to trade for Goose."
Braves,3cfpsg,speed3_freak,5,Tue Jul 7 17:24:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right it was to get the contract off the books which is even weirder considering they have the new $1B TV deal. I completely forgot about him in all honesty. It's a $14M raffle ticket that would be higher if he were an international FA so an investment I can get behind."
Braves,3cfpsg,gvedak,6,Tue Jul 7 17:35:29 2015 UTC,"It's a $14M raffle ticket that would be higher if he were an international FA so an investment I can get behind.    To me, this is why it was such a dumb trade.  I can't believe that they couldn't get more for this.  I get that they may not have liked him to pan out, but jeeze.  Reports out of Arizona was that Touki may have just not had the grit required to make it to the bigs."
Braves,3cfpsg,MarcusDA,2,Tue Jul 7 17:44:53 2015 UTC,"I think to make things even worse for them it has a buyout, or a manageable club option for 2016. They traded years of team control in a promising arm for $14M in one year.   I hope it was because Touki didn't run out a groundball when he was practicing his bunts or something idiotic."
Braves,3cfpsg,drrhythm2,3,Tue Jul 7 17:54:59 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere if Touki were Cuban, his contract would be $50M plus."
Braves,3cfpsg,following_eyes,5,Tue Jul 7 17:53:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be that high. I think he'd get a signing bonus of $15-20 million. He'd be a top guy, for sure. But not $50 million."
Braves,3cfpsg,gvedak,3,Tue Jul 7 21:35:56 2015 UTC,That seems more likely. This kid seems like a straight fireballer though.
Braves,3cfpsg,drrhythm2,7,Tue Jul 7 16:47:35 2015 UTC,"I got to watch his first start and his curveball was absolutely devastating. It's going to be fun to watch him progress, especially if he continues to develop that changeup. Once he starts to replicate that delivery more it's going to be really fun to watch him pitch."
Braves,3cfpsg,joelbozo,3,Tue Jul 7 17:01:30 2015 UTC,88mph splitter is the speed of many pitcher's fastball...
Braves,3cfpsg,following_eyes,4,Tue Jul 7 17:03:00 2015 UTC,"If someone was holding back, why would another team want them?  Bold strategy, Cotton"
Braves,3cfpsg,Braves010,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:41:35 2015 UTC,"Not holding back like throwing 85 when you can throw 98, but you know holding that little extra back when it could make you seem way more desirable."

Braves,3cfpsg,LEEEEEFTHOOK,3,Tue Jul 7 16:55:51 2015 UTC,It's already hard enough to play good enough to get called up to the majors...  Most guys in the minors never make it so I doubt you'd EVER find a situation where a player is actually holding back.  These guys are in it for a career...  In it to make money not play for a team they like.  Once you make it and establish yourself you get an opportunity to hit free agency and play for who you like.

Braves,3cim5b,testingapril,5,Wed Jul 8 20:56:11 2015 UTC,Why get rid of Cunningham? I think I much prefer him over Eury in left.
Braves,3cim5b,excrulon,3,Wed Jul 8 12:55:54 2015 UTC,"His offense died. He's currently Hitting .250 in gwinnett. Perez simply has a higher ceiling than Cunningham. Not much higher, but higher."

Braves,3cim5b,snippler10,4,Wed Jul 8 17:53:41 2015 UTC,"As much as I don't like the thought right now because I've grown attached- I don't think Grilli survives the trade deadline. I think selling high on him right now would be to our future benefit and Jim Johnson would be fine in the role. May be an unpopular opinion, I just get a feeling after that dominance last night that he is turning some heads."
Braves,3cim5b,joelbozo,2,Wed Jul 8 16:32:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think what he's been doing is sustainable. I mean, there are a few exceptions like last night, but the majority of the time it feels like he's just barely getting by without blowing the game. Most of his innings are butt clenching fun.  (this doesn't mean I don't like him! I just fear implosion soon.)"
Braves,3cim5b,excrulon,2,Wed Jul 8 17:34:09 2015 UTC,"Right, and I agree. That's one of my points- sell high. The probability he sustains this is low and he should probably be dealt right now for as much return as we can get- his value won't much higher, if at all."
Braves,3cim5b,joelbozo,2,Wed Jul 8 17:48:42 2015 UTC,I would be absolutely shocked if Grilli is a brave after the deadline.
Braves,3cim5b,Dizzydsmith,2,Wed Jul 8 17:46:11 2015 UTC,"This makes a ton of sense, but good grief, making this bullpen worse will not make this season go by any faster.  If Grilli goes, then I would imagine Maybin goes too. Maybe if we see good prospects for signing him before he hits free agency, then we might keep him. But if there's a chance he hits free agency, then he's gotta go at the deadline, IMO."
Braves,3cim5b,testingapril,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:00:41 2015 UTC,Grilli has done really well but you'd have to sell high on a closer that's closer to 39 than 38. He'd be a 1.5 year rental for some team but potentially a worthwhile one. I just wonder what such a trade could bring in return. A contender with a big-time closer might even use him as an 8th inning set up guy.

Braves,3cim5b,objectlesson,2,Wed Jul 8 21:03:51 2015 UTC,Before today he had like 9 straight appearances without allowing a run.  I think Avilan is just good enough that we can't afford to get rid of him and just bad enough that no fan will ever like him.
Braves,3cim5b,mycrystalcity,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:09:41 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I know he's been passable, but he hasn't been great since 2013. He feels like a high-wire act. I'm not trying to be unfair and salty, I promise, but I NEVER feel safe with Avilan's name near any game, much less one with a 3 run or less lead."
Braves,3cim5b,objectlesson,2,Wed Jul 8 21:16:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not really disagreeing with you.  I was one of his loudest critics when he was really bad last season.  And I don't feel like a lead is safe with him pitching, either."
Braves,3cim5b,CDub22EP,2,Thu Jul 9 00:58:31 2015 UTC,I hope Julio figures it out on the road today. I still stand by the fact that he can and will be our ace. Also I think Lavarnway catching him is MUCH better than AJ. His last 2 starts were with RL and they have been good.

Braves,3chi65,cymmot,9,Tue Jul 7 23:38:02 2015 UTC,I bet I'm the only one who put Marcus Giles. When I was 9 I wanted to be Marcus Giles when I grew up.
Braves,3chi65,praeceps93,4,Tue Jul 7 23:42:37 2015 UTC,"Same! I saw him at a rehab performance in Myrtle Beach and I went to get an autograph in the bullpen when the game was finished. I was really small and there were so many people around the fence that I got knocked down. He saw me, yelled at everyone to get away from me, then signed a ball and handed it to me. He chatted with me and my dad for a good 10 minutes after that. Such an awesome guy, had me as a fan til the day he hung em up."
Braves,3chi65,panhead,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:12:54 2015 UTC,"I almost said Marcus. I loved him since growing up since I played a lot at 2B. I ended up going with Javy though since I started out at catcher, and he was probably my first favorite player.  Speaking of Giles, anyone remember the time he had like 9 straight base hits? I think the NL record was/is 10. I remember it was really cool to watch."

Braves,3cid1o,Chief_Noc-A-Homa,6,Wed Jul 8 03:30:53 2015 UTC,"For those that missed it on the Braves broadcast, Andre Aldridge said Maybin said some of these things to him:   How he's doing well in July: He's getting closer to 100%, ""The better I feel healthwise, the better I can be as a player"". How he's getting noticed around the league: ""I only want to be an Atlanta Brave. I love being in Atlanta. This is just a perfect time in my life right now. If everything's in my power, hopefully I will be an Atlanta Brave for a long long time"".     I hope all of the following is right. I had a mess of tabs/numbers, combining the stats manually.    Maybin in Julybin:    7 game hit streak 12-28, (.429) HR, 2 doubles, 1 triple, 3 multi-hit games (back to back 3-hit games on 3rd/4th) 2/7 BB/K 6/4 runs/RBI     AJ in the last 3: 10 for 13, 3 doubles, HR  AJ in his last 12:    20 for 53, 1 strikeout .377/.377/.660, 2 HR, 6 doubles, triple. 5/5 runs/RBI 4 multi-hit games (three 3-hit games, one 4-hit game)     Great to see a 6-1 stretch without Freddie. Nice that Grilli had a lockdown outing after the lead was down to 1 run.      Kevin McAlpin on twitter:   ""Grilli has now retired 16 consecutive batters...10 via strikeout. Over his last 22 appearances, he's posted a 1.27 ERA (3 ER/21.1 IP)"""
Braves,3cid1o,SG8970,7,Wed Jul 8 03:36:18 2015 UTC,Man I really don't want to let go of Maybin even though the potential return we could get. Maybe if we could sign him to a relatively cheap extension it could work out.
Braves,3cid1o,thekidfromyesterday,9,Wed Jul 8 03:42:00 2015 UTC,At this point I'm way more interested in the yearly return we can get from having him in our lineup. At some point I think we have to realize when we have the right piece.

Obviously just speculation, but a trade of that sort would be so deflating, and totally out of character with what Hart has been doing all year.

I usually go by extra basehits/multi-hit games or the lack thereof for the bad ones. I went back 12 games to a 3 hit game he had on June 20th.   I'll post the full numbers without the last 3:   10-40 (.250/.250/.450), BUT 1 HR, 3 doubles, triple    After a crappy May he started June:  12 games/9 started   13-42 (.310, .341 OBP), 1 HR, 3 doubles, 2/5 BB/K, 7/6 runs/RBI Four 2-hit games  Then 0-9 stretch, 2/2 BB/K before going into the 12 game stretch I chose in the original post."

Braves,3ck6v1,thekidfromyesterday,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:49:56 2015 UTC,He throws strikes just fine. But you nailed it with 'worst case scenario.' It should be an absolute last ditch effort to salvage some value by moving him to the pen. He should be starting until there's no hope remaining.

Braves,3ck6v1,praeceps93,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:10:08 2015 UTC,"I think he'd be good there, but I'm not ready to give up on him as a starter. I could see him being a serviceable No. 3 or 4 guy."

Braves,3ck6v1,Elwynn,2,Wed Jul 8 16:54:23 2015 UTC,"I truly hope not. Being able to touch 97-99 on pitch 100 is arm strength teams dream of, his possible future value is in the stratosphere if he remains a starter and figures things out. Last night in relief he wasn't even trying to air it out either, which is weird. I was expecting all 100's and 101's, instead he was the same 97-99."
Braves,3ck6v1,Elwynn,2,Wed Jul 8 17:30:20 2015 UTC,"being a good starter isn't always about arm strength. It's about command, control, and knowing when to throw what, when."
Braves,3ck6v1,speed3_freak,2,Wed Jul 8 19:13:25 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, hence the 'figuring things out,' he's only 23 and has plenty of time. Assigning him full time to the bullpen at this point would be horrible mismanagement of assets. He draws a strong comp to smoltz (not that he will ever reach his ceiling), who also struggled mightily when he started out. The point is, why strip him of his ceiling and probably deprive the braves of a ton of future value when it's not at all necessary?"
Braves,3ck6v1,Elwynn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:32:59 2015 UTC,"If all goes well with the TJ, I see Simmons to be our closer of the future.  Last year his stuff looked NASTY.  Hope he gets back to form in good time."
Braves,3ck6v1,PickShark,-5,Thu Jul 9 04:11:08 2015 UTC,"Just stop. His fastball doesn't have 'pretty good movement.' And his command is not off. He's literally in the top 10% of all pitchers, with 50+ innings, at throwing in the zone. His walk rate % is also solid. His problem is his being too hit-able. His fastball is either too straight or too easy for a hitter to pick up."
Braves,3ck6v1,Elwynn,2,Wed Jul 8 16:17:25 2015 UTC,"he has a command issue. 100% its not that he cant hit the strike zone. he cant hit the edges of the strike zone. basically everything is in the heart of the plate making it purely a timing issue. Considering he gets an average horizontal movement of almost 7 inches on his fastball, he has great movement. but predictable.  this is the problem"
Braves,3ck6v1,PickShark,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:26:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wasn't really separating command and control (should have), but you're right, and the pitch % shows it. I don't know where you got 7in movement, I'm only looking at fangraphs right now though, but horizontal movement on a fastball doesn't mean a whole lot to same handed batters. It's dated, but not much otherwise done on it http://baseballanalysts.com/archives/2009/05/fastball_and_ch.php. I still don't agree he has great movement, not from what I'm looking at (he does oddly have insane vertical on his four seamer, I'll give you that). But the rest is pretty average to start his career. Not that any movement analysis will likely matter at all at this point. (http://www.hardballtimes.com/the-internet-cried-a-little-when-you-wrote-that-on-it/)"
Braves,3ck6v1,Elwynn,0,Wed Jul 8 17:09:37 2015 UTC,"use brooks baseball for relative horizontal movement. actually... use brooks baseball for like 90% of pitch tracking things. its pretty useful for determining pitch analytics. for reference, the horizontal movement he gets on his four seamer is greater than Craig Kimbrel's. which is impressive considering Kimbrel is pretty lauded for his insane  velocity combined with late running action."
Braves,3ck6v1,PickShark,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:37:06 2015 UTC,":D yeah I'm familiar with brooks, but it's in no way my preference. Except for specific game data, or tracking umps (I love that feature). Kind of nitpicking to say their horizontal mov is comparable. Either way doesn't matter, as they also have comparable swing%, but a 20%(!) difference in contact%. It's some movement, but it's in no way good movement. Or all movement isn't created equal....which is kind of what those links explain."
Braves,3ck6v1,Elwynn,0,Wed Jul 8 17:59:51 2015 UTC,"i think its more that because he gets so much vertical movement, his fastball stays at the same plane. meaning the ball isnt dropping to the bottom of the bat, but rather just moving down the barrel. only a simple adjustment for a hitter to move the bat horizontally. and locating pitches down the middle makes it even easier. if he could find the edges, he'd have a much better whiff rate"
Braves,3ck6v1,Elwynn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:07:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know that it would be more the reason, there's un-quantifiable things like 'easy/hard to pick up' out of the hand that have basis. But that's certainly a possibility, his vertical on his four seamer is something I can't really find with any other successful pitcher."

Great BB and K rates too. That's pretty awesome.   But last year he fell off. Merely average. This year I think bouncing all over the system has taken it's toll. Not many PA's for the season overall. I just wonder if he actually started in the bigs for a few months what he could do. Maybe the 2013 call-up was that chance, and he didn't do well.

Met most of the players in passing throughout the weekend(including Avilan). They were all very pleasant. Since then it's been difficult for me to really dislike any of them.

Braves,3cdu6h,NotThatRelevant,8,Tue Jul 7 16:17:33 2015 UTC,"It's based on the ridiculously terrible song/music video ""wonton soup"" by lil b. It's been a touchdown dance in the nfl for ages. It's kinda one of those,' the humor comes from the irony of how bad this is' type of things.

Braves,3cdwrs,Chief_Noc-A-Homa,12,Tue Jul 7 03:51:39 2015 UTC,That Maybin catch though. Notice how Eury pulled up this time and let Maybin catch it. It's almost as if last time he didn't listen he got trucked full speed by Maybin and learned who has priority on fly balls to the gap. #improvement
Braves,3cdwrs,burmp,3,Tue Jul 7 03:59:49 2015 UTC,That was fundamentals 101 when I was learning to play back in the day.  CF ALWAYS had priority in calling off another outfielder.  Just like Shortstop is priority in the infield.  At least that's what I was always taught.
Braves,3cdwrs,Hedgey,7,Tue Jul 7 13:47:21 2015 UTC,"I trust Grilli when he has a 2+ run lead, otherwise it can be a bit nerve racking.     Maybin!    Kelly was way overdue for a homerun. Hadn't hit one since before his trip to the DL.   He hit all 6 of his homeruns between April 15th and May 5th (16 games/13 starts/53 PA)  Hits the DL on May 14th.  Maybe he'll starting hitting some more HRs again.      Record with Freddie starting: 31-34 Record with Freddie subbing: 1-0  Record with no Freddie at all: 9-8   The one game Freddie got 'rest' before his injury was May 31st @ SF. Braves won 7-5. Freddie played the 7th-9th had 1 PA, 1 HR, 1 RBI."
Braves,3cdwrs,SG8970,3,Tue Jul 7 03:58:21 2015 UTC,Was there a delay in the game around the ninth? I got out of the car right after the last out in the bottom of the 8th and didn't check on the game for a long time (20-30 minutes). I kept waiting for an update on my phone saying someone had asked our the game was over and it just never came. So I checked back in on the radio right as the last out in the bottom of the ninth. Did something happen out of the norm?

Braves,3ce3ue,Itypedthesewords,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:34:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you are wrong; I'm saying that it might not be in the team's best interest to disclose the full story. If he has, for example, a sore wrist, maybe next game a pitcher busts him in with fastballs thinking he can't get around on them, or is more aggressive than normal, and we don't get the one walk we need that could have led to the one run that wins a game.  That's a real stretch, no doubt, but in such a competitive game why give information to your competition? Yes, it may be just purely for rest, but it may also be because something minor is bothering him, and that made it a good day for a ""rest."" I dunno if this makes any sense; maybe I'm crazy."
Braves,3ce3ue,drrhythm2,2,Tue Jul 7 21:40:37 2015 UTC,"That's fair. Wasn't trying to prove you wrong, just going on what I'd heard. Your point definitely makes sense."

Braves,3cc9ri,waffles,3,Mon Jul 6 20:05:31 2015 UTC,"Albies is fast. He's going to be fun to follow. Made good contact all night. Most impressive to me was when he didn't get fazed at all after fouling a ball into his face. But he also had a stolen base. The box score will say that he has an outfielder throw him out at third on another play, but he slid over the base and the third baseman held the tag.   Caicedo was pretty impressive, although he's got this extra foot adjustment when he's in the windup that I'm not a fan of. But that could easily be someone messing with his footwork trying something out. And only 5 hits/ no walks over 6 innings.   Salazar was really impressive. Came in with the bases loaded and nobody out. Struck out 5 over two innings, although he did walk in a run. 95-97 consistently on his fastball.   Roney struck out the side in the 9th, also hitting 95-97 consistently.   Davidson had an off night. 1 walk and 3 strike outs."
Braves,3cckhr,queefingcondor,2,Mon Jul 6 21:21:21 2015 UTC,"Technically we aren't allowed to negotiate with him until July 1st, 2016. However, with most international prospects an agreement is reached well prior to that date, and just isn't made official. As for your 2nd question, the fact that many of the teams that usually spend are restricted next year probably plays into it. It also doesn't seem like many players partake in a bidding war, but the whole situation is confusing as it takes place behind close doors in another country."
Braves,3cckhr,Abailly907,2,Mon Jul 6 22:14:09 2015 UTC,"Typically those bidding wars only happen when it's a Cuban or Asian player. Atlanta is one of the most prominent teams in South America as far as scouting goes- so that probably has a lot to do with it. It's all about starting the relationship early. You give a young dude down there $4.5 million, that's life changing. He will worry about making more later."
Braves,3cckhr,Dizzydsmith,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:33:55 2015 UTC,4.5 million guaranteed vs the potential for nothing. I'll bet that had something to do with it.

Braves,3cckhr,waffles,2,Mon Jul 6 22:01:24 2015 UTC,"The same way that colleges get commitments from players before they can sign.   I'm not sure of his current financial situation, but missing out on that much money is nothing to sneeze at. And if he's as good as Miggy he'll get his pay day."

From the amount of innings pitched I assume he's been a reliever for a long time. Numbers look decent. My guess is that this is a move looking for potential bullpen help. No word on what we gave up for him.

I sat near first baseline one time and it was the worst spot because people were constantly walking in front of me and blocking my view. My best experience was standing up at the bar area in right field and chatting with Braves fans. Hit up U street after the game if you want to bar hop.

Braves,3ccyrj,CapnKetchup,8,Mon Jul 6 23:07:59 2015 UTC,"According to this article on Beyond the Box Score, Markakis is swinging more at low pitches as the MLB strike zone moves lower and possibly trying to avoid seeing too many shifts by hitting to all fields.   In working to take the ball to the opposite field, it's possible that Markakis is trying to shield himself from the effects of the defensive shift. As shifts have become more prominent, power hitters who pull the ball excessively have seen their performance falter. Chris Davis' 2014 performance is the prime example of this. Markakis wasn't necessarily an overshift candidate, and he clearly doesn't have prodigious power, but consider the factors involved with Markakis' career trajectory and move to Atlanta.  1) Markakis' power was basically already gone  2) The strike zone appears to be lowering  3) Pull hitters are finding it harder to maintain production  4) His new home park is difficult for power  So, Markakis responds to his new situation by swinging more at pitches likely to generate ground balls, limiting his fly balls, and shift-proofing himself. Along the way, he is swinging less at pitches that are more likely to be called balls (up and in, low and in). A good walk rate is a nice thing to have as a baseline offensive trait as one ages. This sounds like a guy who is looking to maintain some level of useful production throughout his decline years as he plays under a multi-million dollar contract."
Braves,3ccyrj,spdrumline,6,Mon Jul 6 23:17:48 2015 UTC,"We assume his neck surgery has sapped a lot of his power and it just hasn't returned yet, most likely due to his age. Right now, his OBP-focused approach is what we're asking from him and he's performing very well.  He has been scorching them a lot harder lately that I've seen here recently. His power will probably return to some extent, but probably not to its prior levels. I think the Braves are more interested in if he can produce gap power with plenty of doubles and few strikeouts, as that seems to be where we're going as a ball club."
Braves,3ccyrj,mycrystalcity,3,Mon Jul 6 23:13:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, I had no idea about the neck injury, so that's news. Other than that strange bit his stats look great. so I'm glad to hear it's favorable, not unexpected."
Braves,3ccyrj,mattds1993,3,Mon Jul 6 23:20:10 2015 UTC,They're saying he couldn't keep up with his offseason weight routine because of the surgery.
Braves,3ccyrj,mycrystalcity,2,Mon Jul 6 23:22:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we never figured him to maintain his power numbers. That was a major thing when we signed him. He didn't even get to play in spring training due to the rehab from surgery. Given all of that I think he's done admirably."

Braves,3c99s1,BaconOfTruth,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:33:03 2015 UTC,Funny how things work out.
Braves,3c99s1,FamousTee,12,Tue Jul 7 20:17:11 2015 UTC,"Interesting that Braves aren't willing to deal Maybin. I figured they would pair Maybin and Chris Johnson together in a trade to dump some salary. Use Perez the rest of this year with an eye on Peraza and Mallex Smith for the future.    But on the other hand, the best you could hope from Perez, Peraza or Smith is that they perform as good as Maybin. So why not just keep Maybin if we can afford him and deal one if those other guys to fill gaps? Just depends on if they think Maybin can keep playing at this level or if he will regress."
Braves,3c99s1,malowolf,10,Mon Jul 6 02:49:25 2015 UTC,"I find it hard to believe that Maybin's completely untouchable. He's playing very well and if Hart is serious about moving Chris Johnson, I'm sure he's listening to calls on Maybin. Everything has a price, and while Maybin is definitely having a nice season, he's not raking it to the point that he should be completely off the table."
Braves,3c99s1,Arfusman,-1,Mon Jul 6 11:25:12 2015 UTC,Agreed. Maybin is extremely streaky based on what I've heard from fan bases he's played for previously. If we're going to deal him do it when he's hot.

Braves,3c99s1,TweetsInCommentsBot,9,Mon Jul 6 02:34:14 2015 UTC,"By Hart saying the Braves are ""not open"" to trading Maybin, it could be a way to drive up his trade value. We were not open to trading Kimbrel either, but we got a bonanza for him.   Saying we are not open to trading Maybin both implies that we really like him and signals other teams they would have to offer significant value to have a chance to land him.   The Maybin / BJ et al trade looks like genius right meow."
Braves,3c99s1,drrhythm2,14,Mon Jul 6 10:21:35 2015 UTC,"Don't believe for a second that we aren't looking to trade him. That's what the front office is feeding Buster Olney and the press so we have trade leverage. I really don't think Maybin will be a Brave on August 1st. His trade value is through the roof and it would simply be irresponsible of us not to take advantage while we're in rebuild mode. I love Maybin and I love the way he plays, but we have to keep our eyes on the prize."
Braves,3c99s1,fathampsteroncrack,12,Mon Jul 6 02:55:19 2015 UTC,"you don't get to the prize by hoping prospects turn out and moving known quantities for not much in return.  If Atlanta wants to win they need to actually accumulate talent, not just farm it."
Braves,3c99s1,mehjbmeh,13,Mon Jul 6 03:21:03 2015 UTC,"You turned what I said into something I didn't. I didn't say trade him at any costs. You don't trade Maybin unless you get the right package. To say that the Braves are not open to trading him is a flat out lie. To not consider it would be ridiculous. Plus, I certainly would not call Maybin a known quantity with his track record."
Braves,3c99s1,fathampsteroncrack,4,Mon Jul 6 04:54:05 2015 UTC,"Is Maybin a known quantity?  He's been successful 3 months of 7 or so years of MLB playing.  I love what he's doing here, but I doubt we can count on it for years to come."
Braves,3c99s1,MarcusDA,3,Mon Jul 6 12:36:27 2015 UTC,Seems to me that he's spent most of his career in a crappy park for hitters (Petco) and that he's had a lot of injuries.  He was a very highly rated prospect.  This could be him finally living up to his potential; uninjured and living in his hometown with a good support system presumably.
Braves,3c99s1,74656638,0,Mon Jul 6 13:49:29 2015 UTC,"living in his hometown    Given that Maybin is from Asheville, NC, has he been doing some type of long commute down 85 every day to Atlanta that I'm not aware of? Because if so, that has to be impacting his performance."
Braves,3c99s1,iheartgt,2,Mon Jul 6 16:33:09 2015 UTC,"I doubt he's commuting, but a three hour drive from home is a lot closer than living 2500 miles away"

Braves,3c99s1,CaucasianFury,3,Mon Jul 6 04:42:39 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree. Didn't say we shouldn't. But the matter of the fact is that Maybin doesn't have the most stellar track record and it makes complete sense to be considering trade options while he is at the highest trade value of his career when we are rebuilding. The idea that he is an untouchable player is just not true.
Braves,3c99s1,fathampsteroncrack,2,Mon Jul 6 04:58:18 2015 UTC,"Usually it's not the front office feeding reporters. The info probably came from a Gm who asked a him. With that said, I think the Braves are willing to deal him, but for a super high price, that may lead to him being kept."
Braves,3c99s1,Abailly907,3,Mon Jul 6 02:58:33 2015 UTC,"I somehow don't think we'll deal him, but everybody has their price and if a team is willing to give up a lot I think we'll take it. With that said, his future in Atlanta probably hinges on next year, assuming he's still here. He has to be one of the top NL CF's at this point. I'd like to see him stay and be here for 2017 if he continues like this. A lot of factors obviously play into that."
Braves,3c99s1,omglawlz,3,Mon Jul 6 03:53:20 2015 UTC,"Just thinking out loud here, but wouldn't it make more sense to trade Nick Markakis?"
Braves,3c99s1,fridgebrah,4,Mon Jul 6 04:01:25 2015 UTC,"Nope. Markakis is making what the market would pay for him, maybe even a little more. We would get nothing in return for him."

Braves,3c99s1,VigilantRESOLVE,2,Mon Jul 6 08:07:23 2015 UTC,"He is doing exactly what every team knew he would do so if they wanted him they would have got him last year. Actually a little less, he has 0 power."
Braves,3c99s1,abesrevenge,3,Mon Jul 6 04:42:36 2015 UTC,"I hope we don't do what we did with Chris Johnson and extend him after a career year when he still has contract time. He's only 28. I would love for him to be on the braves for at least 5-6 more years (if he plays well) on a team friendly contract. The only reason we should trade him is if it gets us a good catcher. We're good on prospects for now. If we could get Lucroy from the Brewers or Plawecki/d'Arnaud (whoever the Mets decide isn't the future) from the Mets, it might be a good idea to trade him."
Braves,3c99s1,ttubravesrock,3,Mon Jul 6 08:36:00 2015 UTC,In the context of todays contracts I wouldn't call Maybins contract pricey. If he continues to play like he has then his contract is a bargain. centerfielders that hit .290+ with a .360+ OBP and hit 15 homers with 30+ steals get a lot more than 9 million a year.  I don't see any need to extend him. Perfect world he plays great and we exercise his 9 million option in 2017 then let him walk for a comp draft pick. Only reason to trade him is if you think he is going to regress/get injured again.
Braves,3c99s1,cajunrevenge,2,Mon Jul 6 10:42:22 2015 UTC,I think they should keep him. If nothing else he provides a spark and someone the younger guys can look up to and learn from. However if they get a nice little offer I would understand if they pulled the trigger.
Braves,3c99s1,abesrevenge,2,Mon Jul 6 04:40:59 2015 UTC,I don't think Maybin is moving unless we get a legit return this year.  All of these players are rentals.  If we had the division lead on July 31st it may be different but I don't see him leaving yet simply because of lack of depth.
Braves,3c99s1,Josephw000,2,Mon Jul 6 06:49:28 2015 UTC,"My opinion is to trade him while value is at it's highest. Don't want to make the same mistake as Chris Johnson and base future on a career year. Also, don't want to make same mistake as Jurrjens and wait too late when no trade value is left.  What do you guys think of Maybin and Chris Johnson for Andrew Susac?"
Braves,3c99s1,jbsWarEagle,2,Mon Jul 6 12:31:02 2015 UTC,"I don't see an extension happening.  He would probably be looking for $10-14 mil a year and that would give us 2 outfielders over 30 without a ton of power making more than $10 mil.  I love Maybin, but if he regresses or gets injured those contracts could hold us back during our window to win.  His contract as it stands right now is perfect for our plans.  I think they'll hold for this year and see how next year plays out.  They'll exercise the option if he keeps it up, or use that money in '17 for a free agent signing going into the new park.  That being said, if Hart gets the right offer he will listen."
Braves,3c99s1,vonDriessen,2,Mon Jul 6 14:46:56 2015 UTC,I bet they keep them throughout this season. See what he does the rest of the year and decide in the offseason. They'll try to dump K. Johnson and/or Gomes and maybe AJ if they can. Maybin seems young enough to keep around till '17 at the minimum.
Braves,3c99s1,theolereacharound,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:57:02 2015 UTC,"I think I've said this before. I don't expect any player that is currently not under contract or team control through the end of the 2017 season is going to remain a Brave. Mike Minor will be non-tendered. Grilli, Johnson, Johnson, and Johnson will be traded before the deadline and Maybin will be traded as soon as someone meets our asking price for him."
Braves,3c99s1,phamalacka,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:43:52 2015 UTC,"Doubt he makes it past the trade deadline without getting moved... and if that happens, he'll prob be moved during the offseason. Too many OF prospects to keep around someone who is probably at the highest value he will ever be"

I wouldn't be surprised at all if he gets moved too though. What would be better? Maybin for another prospect or current MLB Player, or Maybin and Chris Johnson (with his contract) for a lot less return? I think the Braves should just eat Johnson's contract at this point cause no one wants him but who knows who John Hart can rip off next"
Braves,3c99s1,ReverendBass,0,Mon Jul 6 02:49:04 2015 UTC,"This guy is having a one year wonder type year. He has never come close to really having a year like this. I can see the Braves signing him to a longterm deal and he falls back to his typical .225 BA, .285 oba days.   They would be geniuses to deal him and get someone who will be more beneficial to the team next year because as much as anyone wants to believe, the Braves aren't doing squat this year"

As good as he is, I'm not sure the Braves want an aging star in the waning years of his career for big dollars while giving up a young pitcher that should be a fixture in an MLB rotation for a decade. He'll be making $15mil+ from 2017 on... know any other second baseman we signed for that amount to a long-term deal that didn't exactly pan out?  Edit: I'm also not sure Jace is who we want at third. I'd like to see a better hitter playing there, preferably with some pop."
Braves,3cbxjz,drrhythm2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:50:05 2015 UTC,"Good points, and I too am a bit gun-shy over an expensive second baseman again. I'm certainly not saying I don't want Julio around, but I'm thinking that's what it would take to pull off the switch. I love a Julio (with home stats) as much as the next guy. Third base is where we'd want some of that elusive 'pop' that we're missing, too. Rio Ruiz, the heir apparent, doesn't have the 'pop' either (1 hr. this year), so I'd be interested to see where it comes from."
Braves,3c8bo7,Xonero,17,Sun Jul 5 21:09:32 2015 UTC,I hope Vizcaino is here to stay this time. Lots of potential in that arm.
Braves,3c8bo7,blackcoffee_91,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:13:51 2015 UTC,"before they both debuted, he was rated a better potential closer than kimbrel. not saying hes going to be better than kimbrel (I think kimbrel will go down as the best ever when hes done), but if hes a 30+ svs per year guy, I can dig it."
Braves,3c8bo7,PWNtimeJamboree,12,Mon Jul 6 17:14:40 2015 UTC,"Also, Andrew McKirahan is eligible to come back from suspension on July 20."

Braves,3c8bo7,FamousTee,19,Sun Jul 5 21:13:02 2015 UTC,Wasn't just one bad outing for Masset though. He's been god awful minus like one or two appearances.
Braves,3c8bo7,AnEternalEnigma,8,Sun Jul 5 21:16:16 2015 UTC,"Remember when everyone saw Masset got DFA'd from the Marlins and collectively said, ""How do you DFA someone with a 1.70 ERA?!?!"" Yeah, that .400 opposing AVG may have been a giveaway."
Braves,3c8bo7,jperez3209,2,Sun Jul 5 22:12:11 2015 UTC,Masset was doing fine with the Marlins though. 2.47 FIP and 3.76 xFIP. Though it was a small sample size. Just 9.2 innings. But it was very odd for them to let him go when he hadn't imploded yet.
Braves,3c8bo7,Daphne1895,2,Sun Jul 5 22:18:41 2015 UTC,Masset is hot garbage. Classic AAAA middle reliever. They are a dime a dozen and a guy like Carpenter deserves a shot so we can see if he has more potential.
Braves,3c8bo7,BaconOfTruth,3,Mon Jul 6 15:16:31 2015 UTC,"He actually had 9 straight very good outings in June and after that, started getting absolutely shelled once again."

Braves,3c90q1,waffles,4,Mon Jul 6 01:08:12 2015 UTC,I probably wouldnt do it but what about a trade for Marcell Ozuna?? Dude's got some pop in his bat and the Marlins might sell low on him after he just got optioned to AAA today because's he's in a bit of a slump. Only problem is that he's kinda like that guy from the move Major Leagues. The voodoo guy who can crush fastballs but can't really hit breaking balls. Just a fun thought to consider

Braves,3c90q1,BabyEatin_Dingo,2,Mon Jul 6 20:18:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm misreading this, but I just want to point out that offense is offense and it can come from different sources. If we're generating lots of runs without home runs, then there's no need to acquire power hitters. This comes from the same notion that strikeouts, in a vacuum, don't ruin an offense if run support is still high. Scoring can still be done without power. Not trying to be a dick, just making sure that you don't think our offense-less lineup is due to a lack of power hitters (it's simply due to a lack of hitters in general...)."
Braves,3c90q1,Arfusman,3,Mon Jul 6 11:35:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that, and I've been happily surprised by the run-generating capacity of our current lineup. However, I think that having a power bat would be nothing but a benefit. As much as I love him, having AJ as cleanup doesn't speak well for the potential of our lineup. We're in the bottom half in runs scored I think (around 23rd last I checked) so we could do with some kind of support at some point, I'd say."
Braves,3c90q1,Arfusman,2,Mon Jul 6 11:43:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, but also keep in mind that 2015 was never supposed to be our year anyway. I think this is more of a question for next years trade deadline, at which point more prospects arrive to maintain a much more consistent lineup and power would absolutely be something to be addressed."
Braves,3c90q1,chopchop51,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:55:11 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely, I was aiming more at prospects/guys in our own system who will work for the future."
Braves,3c90q1,PWNtimeJamboree,2,Mon Jul 6 11:59:27 2015 UTC,"My top two choices that are slightly possible would be Aaron Judge and Yoenis Cespedes.  The Yankees have expressed serious interest in Jose Peraza, and I personally would be willing to essentially just swap top prospects with them. They need a second basemen/shortstop and we don't. We need an outfielder, and they really don't, and that is why a Peraza/Judge swap could make sense.  Cespedes is more of a stretch, but with Miguel Cabrera injured for quite a while now, they need a viable option to replace him (Chris Johnson can play both first and third), we can send them Grilli to help their terrible bullpen, and maybe throw in one of our many minor league pitching prospects. That should certainly be enough to get Yoenis since we'd only be getting him for a few months. But I would only want to make this trade if John Hart was ready to set aside a large portion of money to sign Cespedes long term though."
Braves,3c90q1,thekidfromyesterday,3,Mon Jul 6 16:12:51 2015 UTC,this is interesting considering the braves were at one time tabbed as a front runner to land him from boston. we know Hartsy likes him. might be interesting if we're in the division running come deadline time.  EDIT: I would also be incredibly thrilled to straight up swap peraza for judge. might take a bit more though.
Braves,3c90q1,PWNtimeJamboree,4,Mon Jul 6 18:31:22 2015 UTC,"I'd love if we got Aaron Judge from the Yankees, though he is at least 1 year away if not longer."

Yankees want to see his defense improve. theyre not sold on the idea of a right handed Adam Dunn clone.  I, however, could give a shit less if hes a career left fielder that follies about like ManRam if hes gonna hit some goddamn dingers."
Braves,3c90q1,drrhythm2,2,Mon Jul 6 18:28:42 2015 UTC,I went to Gwinnett on the fourth and the slugging percentages made me want to cry.

Braxton Davidson way down the line maybe.   We really don't have the next Freeman, McCann, Klesko, Chipper, LaRoche, or anyone like that anywhere. Those guys are really coveted and would be hard to get even through trading one of our big young arms. Hopefully we can find a solution for C, LF, and 3B"

I guess its because Broomfield seems to attract all the Atlanta transplants ha.  Edit: I'll be there on Sunday rocking my powder blue Murphy jersey :-)
Braves,3cas68,uga_1785,6,Mon Jul 6 13:20:06 2015 UTC,Doesn't help he has been injured last few weeks. Plus isn't it an academic discussion when he isn't going to be fit for the game to begin with?
Braves,3cas68,Tuilalcaron,2,Mon Jul 6 13:37:25 2015 UTC,Even before he got hurt I never heard him mentioned. I'm not saying Shelby isn't deserving. And I think Maybin should be talked about as well. But it has just surprised me that talk about his all star candidacy has been nonexistent. Maybe I'm just fanboying too hard.
Braves,3cas68,cteez910,7,Mon Jul 6 13:45:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think you are.  Freeman is #6 among NL 1st basemen in WAR, and when you get to the OF, Maybin is #24"

Braves,3cas68,PickShark,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:07:16 2015 UTC,There was some talk of him getting in the final vote again. Now that he's hurt that's not going to happen either.
Braves,3cas68,cteez910,0,Mon Jul 6 14:14:11 2015 UTC,"well you gotta understand. the two other contending first basemen are head and shoulders above the rest. Freeman is good offensively and defensively... but Paul Goldschmidt is incredible with a bat. He also has positive baserunning value. 15 SBs this season because he's a smart runner. If freeman makes some big strides offensively, you could see him starting one day but... in the current system for starters where its fan based or driven by 3-4 stats... he doesnt stand a chance."
Braves,3cas68,PickShark,2,Mon Jul 6 14:13:51 2015 UTC,Paul's also better defensively too.
Braves,3cas68,chopchop51,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:58:07 2015 UTC,"agreed. well.. sort of. Paul is something of an enigma. He doesnt show much beyond average in typical situations, but when a run is on the line he's super human. Freddie is better by UZR and the fangraphs Def stat... but paul has a knack for making the impossible plays and saving runs. i'd like to see a hybrid of the two"
Braves,3cas68,Twistify804,0,Mon Jul 6 17:38:59 2015 UTC,"Lots of good points made by everyone. I still believe he is deserving to be the Braves representative but I get it, there's just not a spot for another first baseman."
Braves,3cas68,Aviator157,3,Mon Jul 6 14:22:07 2015 UTC,"A lot of people have said it, but between his injury and the huge group of incredible NL first basemen (Rizzo, Goldy, Votto, Gonzalez, etc) he doesn't stand much of a chance.   I would, however, like to see Cameron Maybin as an NL final vote candidate. He's without a doubt the most deserving position player on our team"
Braves,3cas68,thekidfromyesterday,3,Mon Jul 6 15:09:41 2015 UTC,"It doesn't help that NL 1B is one of the more stacked positions in the league. Rizzo, Goldy, Gonzo, Votto, are all up there with Freddie."
Braves,3cas68,Aviator157,7,Mon Jul 6 16:48:56 2015 UTC,Goldschmidt and Rizzo both deserve to be on the All-Star team before freeman  edit: and Adam Lind
Braves,3cas68,Bravehomer,3,Mon Jul 6 13:30:37 2015 UTC,Lind doesn't necessarily deserve it before Freeman. Freddie has a slight edge in wRC+ and in WAR (and would have a bigger lead if not for injury).
Braves,3cas68,Aviator157,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:38:55 2015 UTC,I'm sure you're right. I just looked at all the basic stats.
Braves,3cas68,thekidfromyesterday,2,Mon Jul 6 13:42:31 2015 UTC,"I would rank Goldschmidt, Rizzo and Adrian Gonzalez ahead of Freddie."

Braves,3c5t3q,Xonero,5,Sun Jul 5 02:36:27 2015 UTC,"Now or never. Gotta complete the sweep tomorrow and win both of the next two series. If so, then I wouldn't sell."
Braves,3c5t3q,Daphne1895,6,Sun Jul 5 02:53:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I understand the sentiment, but I want the long-term plan to stay intact. If there is a chance to get a big piece of the future by trading someone off of a .500 team that realistically doesn't have much of a shot at a deep postseason run, I'd rather get that big piece.   Uribe has been great, but he's 36 and a free agent next year. Will his value ever be higher?   Grilli is 38; I don't know how much longer he will be effective and his value will probably be at it's peak at this year's trade deadline.  Maybin may be the most interesting piece. He's on a cheap contract through next season, and he's 28. He's finally showing his potential. Is he someone we think about locking up for a while or trading? I don't know if there is a contender missing a legit CF but if there is, he could really have some trade value.   So as with everything else, it just depends on the return. Fringe prospects don't really do us any good. Any trade really needs to bring something of real long-term value to the team. Maybe there is a team that would want a Uribe or Grilli plus a middle pitching prospect for top 100 position prospect at 3B or corner OF. I dunno."
Braves,3c65kh,Chief_Noc-A-Homa,10,Sun Jul 5 04:59:48 2015 UTC,Shelby is on right now. Can you guys start calling him the Cobra?

Braves,3c65kh,falloutranger,2,Sun Jul 5 18:57:50 2015 UTC,I'll settle on ShelBAE Cobra. It is known.

Braves,3c65kh,Snowmittromney,2,Sun Jul 5 17:05:51 2015 UTC,"I hope they sell. The current team isn't going to compete in the playoffs well with the top tier of teams. I don't think adding one or two pieces will change that, and to me a wildcard game loss after trading away valuable prospects for a rental player or two would be the ultimate insult.  I'd rather keep the plan going.  If a team is willing to make a favorable trade for Grilli or Uribe or someone, let's take it."

Braves,3c65kh,Biscuit29,-1,Sun Jul 5 20:36:10 2015 UTC,Oh so who is Fredi supposed to put in to pitch that won't blow the game? It's not the managers fault that we blew our one chance to win it. This game was over as soon as Uribe struck out in the 9th.
Braves,3c65kh,SlurmsMcKenzie13,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:40:18 2015 UTC,"He shouldn't have taken Johnson or Grilli out after only one inning. Edit: I'll agree with you that it's not Fredi's fault that the relievers blew it, but he unnecessarily set up that failure."

Braves,3c590d,Josephw000,11,Sun Jul 5 01:10:15 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why you trade Maybin, he is playing way over his pay grade and you will never get a better price tag. It probably won't last so you need to get what you can now."

I guess I'm hoping playing for the team he followed as a kid and being so close to home are assisting with his comfort, allowing himself to play better.  Depending on the return, go for it.  I'll take Eury in CF for awhile if need be."
Braves,3c590d,Josephw000,3,Sun Jul 5 04:57:11 2015 UTC,Maybin is worth his salary but he's not worth CJ and his salary also.
Braves,3c590d,vslyke,2,Sun Jul 5 02:56:17 2015 UTC,"Isn't Maybin only making about $5 million? If he's a 3-war player wouldn't he be worth almost exactly his salary plus CJ's in theory? I'm still not sure what to do with him though. He could potentially be good for a while, and do we think Mallex will be ready soon?"
Braves,3c590d,drrhythm2,2,Sun Jul 5 13:42:10 2015 UTC,"Maybin is making $7M this year, $8M next year, and has a $9M option for 2017. So combined, he and CJ will make $13M this year, $15.6M next year, and either $10M (Maybin has a $1M buyout) or $18M in 2017 (plus a $1M buyout for CJ in 2018).   That would be a fair deal (based on market value) if Maybin and CJ combined to be worth about 2 wins in each of those years but that's assuming that Maybin can stay healthy (always a risk) and that his poor advanced fielding stats from this season are just a fluke and not a sign that injuries are sapping his effectiveness in CF."
Braves,3c590d,vslyke,6,Sun Jul 5 14:29:03 2015 UTC,"Grilli I'd be fine with, but I think we should hold on to Maybin."

Braves,3c590d,Rob1855,7,Sun Jul 5 03:08:31 2015 UTC,Ironically I was begging the Braves to trade CJ after his batting-title-contending year.  I knew he'd never replicate those numbers and at the time I thought we could get something good for him.

Braves,3c47i5,CobbChop,11,Sat Jul 4 17:06:26 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm the only one in Braves country that doesn't really care for this.  I love Kimbrel.  The atmosphere of the stadium was electric when he came in with the flames and Welcome to the Jungle blaring.  He is/was the best closer in baseball.  But are we expecting to compete in 2016?  And even if we are, is he worth the $11 million in 2016 and the $13 million in 2017?  And who knows how long Kimbrel will last?  I hope for his sake, he is pitching well into his 30s, but there is no guarantee of a guy who can hit 100 lasting that long.  I'm just not sure if this would be the best decision for us.  I'd welcome it, because, as I said, I love Kimbrel, but I don't think we really need to.  My hope is that Shae Simmons returns from TJ as strong as ever and becomes our closer."
Braves,3c47i5,C-Jammin,10,Sat Jul 4 17:37:46 2015 UTC,"The ony reason we really got rid of kimbrel was because we needed melvin GONE. And we did that, we honestly could contend next year with some help from Free Agency."
Braves,3c47i5,Atlantafan115,7,Sat Jul 4 17:56:20 2015 UTC,"Melvin was the reason.  But why do we need to bring back a guy for $24 million over the next two years when our current closer is actually outperforming him?  Not to say Grilli is better than Kimbrel, but he is a fine closer who costs a lot less.  I only want to go after Kimbrel if we know we can sign him to an extension and it won't break the bank."
Braves,3c47i5,C-Jammin,4,Sat Jul 4 18:09:26 2015 UTC,Grilli has been questionably successful. Something odd has happened in SD in general. More fly balls are leaving the park. Inexplicably. For everyone. I dunno. A homecoming could very well make kimbrel the same freakishly dominant guy he once was. Depending on what it costs to get him back I'm all in for it. If it was peraza and some low level pitching prospect I'd be 100% for it. Peraza is good and all but I dont know if he has a spot in our immediate future...
Braves,3c47i5,PickShark,4,Sat Jul 4 18:51:29 2015 UTC,"I can't decide how good Peraza is going to be. He isn't killing it in AAA, but he has been pretty solid. And remember, he just turned 21. He'd still be 21 starting the year next year, and would only be 22 in 2017. He's acquitting himself well in AAA and he may well be the youngest player in the league, 6 years younger than average."
Braves,3c47i5,drrhythm2,0,Sat Jul 4 19:41:50 2015 UTC,I'm just fairly sold on Peterson. I don't expect him to stay at leadoff forever and I think a move somewhere else would use his bat better.

Braves,3c47i5,PickShark,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:59:30 2015 UTC,Is he a great defender?  I don't know if I believe that.
Braves,3c47i5,objectlesson,0,Sun Jul 5 03:31:37 2015 UTC,4th in baseball in UZR 5th in fangraphs Def stat. so the argument is definitely there. also there were fundamental things he's still ironing out. its basically been mostly instinct. but as he gets a better feel for it at the majors he'll get better
Braves,3c47i5,PickShark,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:01:57 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I always expect young players to get better until they prove me otherwise.  I know he's good at turning double plays so he works well in tandem with our other middle infielder, who as everyone knows is magnificent."
Braves,3c47i5,objectlesson,0,Sun Jul 5 04:14:12 2015 UTC,"see... he might not be a superstar in the field, but he's above average and very rangy for a second baseman. that alone means we have one of the biggest ranged middle infields in baseball. he's got at least an average arm and slightly above average glove. its a total package of solid. but the range makes it special when you consider he's got Andrelton to turn two with."
Braves,3c47i5,PickShark,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:39:09 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see his stats at the end of his first full season. He just turned 25, so I don't see a lot of physical projectability left, but he may continue to improve with experience. I don't think he's ever going to be a world-beater but if he can provide average hitting with good speed and very good to great defense, that's a pretty valuable player. It also turns him or Peraza into excellent trade chips with real value."
Braves,3c47i5,drrhythm2,3,Sun Jul 5 11:21:23 2015 UTC,"Questionably successful?  He's 22/24 in save opportunities with a 2.93 ERA with a 39/10 K/BB ratio in 30.2 IP.  What about that is ""questionable""?"
Braves,3c47i5,C-Jammin,5,Sat Jul 4 18:54:23 2015 UTC,Up until a week ago he did not have a clean inning since April 25th. Basically had to hold your breath every appearance. All he does is feed 93-95 mph fastballs in the zone. If it weren't for several 3 run saves he would have blown more. I would have a lot more confidence in a surprisingly regressed kimbrel than Jason grilli. Keep in mind... Grilli I'd having one of his better seasons still and has never had a WHIP under 1.
Braves,3c47i5,PickShark,2,Sat Jul 4 19:07:56 2015 UTC,"Grilli's WHIP of 1.200+ is a little higher than i want to see in a closer. i want my closers to be at 1.000 and below. For a pitcher who's out there for only one inning and with the game on the line, i do not want to see him averaging over one baserunner an inning. Kimbrel's WHIP is high this year too, but it was stupid low every year he was our closer."

Braves,3c47i5,mycrystalcity,5,Sat Jul 4 19:40:30 2015 UTC,"Cots has us just under $60MM in guaranteed portions. Since we have $100-110MM budgets typically, that implies we would have $40-50MM in room under the budget. Few notes:   Our only notable FAs are Uribe, Jim Johnson, and AJ. I could see all 3 of those guys coming back but none are must-keeps in my eyes. Our 2 big arb cases are going to be Minor (3rd year of arb w/ one remaining after) and Miller (1st year of arb). I wouldn't be surprised to see Minor go and Miller get a contract extension. The total for next year could go down if Maybin or Grilli are dealt. (Same for CJ, but let's face it, we are stuck with him.)"
Braves,3c47i5,Twistify804,2,Sat Jul 4 22:09:41 2015 UTC,I agree with you about Miller - I'd be really surprised if we don't lock him down long-term.

Braves,3c5fzw,Superschutte,4,Sun Jul 5 02:57:49 2015 UTC,"We will probably pick up Maybin's option, and I can see Mallex in LF by June of next year."
Braves,3c5fzw,fridgebrah,3,Sun Jul 5 00:14:40 2015 UTC,"Maybin's 2016 contract ($8M) is guaranteed. The team option ($9M or $1M buyout) is for 2017. Maybin is a lock to either be on this team in 2016, or traded at peak value after a solid year this year to make room for Mallex Smith. I can't imagine that, though. Even if Maybin's offense drops off significantly, his defense alone combined with questionable production would make him worth $8M next year."

Braves,3c5fzw,AtlBravos12,2,Sun Jul 5 22:34:07 2015 UTC,"I'd only spring for Parra if we got him for a steal. He strikes out too much, walks too little, and lacks power to justify the discrepancy. He plays good D though. I think he's being overpaid at $6 mil this year."
Braves,3c5fzw,g-burn,2,Sun Jul 5 22:49:06 2015 UTC,We should target Gerardo Parra imo
Braves,3c5fzw,KudzuChimp,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:50:59 2015 UTC,Trade CJ/Bethancourt for pitching prospects. Use all the saved money from these trades to sign Matt Wieters and an entire bullpen. Profit???
Braves,3c5fzw,nattyice2,4,Sun Jul 5 00:22:22 2015 UTC,What team is going to give up decents prospects for CJ and a catcher who has hit in the .220's to this point in his career?
Braves,3c5fzw,BigPapaChuck,2,Sun Jul 5 00:27:40 2015 UTC,"Braves would get much more for Maybin at this point. Trade him at his peak and someone gets a centerfielder with potential 15-20 HR power, great defense, for only $8M in 2016 and a solid option for 2017. Braves have Mallex Smith coming up, so in theory not much would be lost if Maybin isn't part of the longterm plan. (I personally like him for 3-5 years, but I can't speak for Hart/Coppolella).  Also, as much as it would anger the fanbase, the Braves don't need two or especially three leadoff hitters. If Jace Peterson (only 25) and Simba are a solid combo up the middle, what stops Hart from pulling the trigger on sending Peraza somewhere?  Teams WANT Peraza, not so much Peterson.  I don't like it, but you gotta think the Braves are thinking it."
Braves,3c5fzw,BravesPaul,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:34:21 2015 UTC,Don Kelly.
Braves,3c5fzw,FamousTee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:33:57 2015 UTC,What about going after David Price? Price and Miller could be a hell of a one two punch.
Braves,3c5fzw,Elroy10,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:08:21 2015 UTC,"Alex Avila is intriguing, especially if Hart & Co. are truly dissatisfied with Bethancourt. Avila's got a career .346 OBP and while he's not really been that good at much else, the Braves have been heard to be shopping for young catchers. The trade market there is pretty thin and Avila the only FA catcher under 30 next year. He may not be an all-star, but he's still 1) replacement level or above, 2) better than Bethancourt and 2) probably not going to break your bank like a Lucroy trade might."
Braves,3c5nxu,heardofcows,7,Sun Jul 5 01:19:27 2015 UTC,"If you have a small child consider sitting in the 300 section. It might cost more, but it will be worth it. It gets hot in August, and if you're on the first base side the sun can really beat down on you. That's a lot for a ltitle one to handle.   The 300 level is enclosed, and open only to folks with corresponding tickets. Concessions and restrooms are air conditioned, and there are plenty oversized plush chairs when y'all need a break from the heat. All the men's  restrooms have changing tables too. If you go on a Tuesday, you and your wife can get seats in this level for $12. Spend a few extra dollars and enjoy the experience."
Braves,3c5nxu,Tomahawkin95,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:54:58 2015 UTC,Whichever section is closest to the end of the first base line. It's been a while since I've been there but look it up on a stadium map.

Braves,3c2ahn,OneThinDime,3,Sat Jul 4 16:15:40 2015 UTC,Shockingly enough since Callaspo moved to the Dodgers his OBP has been on par with Uribe. That being said he's only been worth 0.2 fWAR since joining compared to Uribe's 1.1.

Braves,3c0160,thekidfromyesterday,9,Fri Jul 3 15:18:19 2015 UTC,"I personally think at this point in time, we need a veteran catcher that can help our young pitchers through the next 2 years while they mature. Unless they are banking on obtaining a prospect at catcher that will sit in the system for a couple of years."
Braves,3c0160,boondock_,3,Fri Jul 3 16:46:37 2015 UTC,Came here to post this.  We've got a stable of bright young pitching talent.  This means (1) They can't all start at the MLB level and (2) we need a veteran presence behind the plate to bring them along.
Braves,3c0160,Rob1855,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:57:50 2015 UTC,"That's one of the reasons I think Lucroy might be good in the short term. I'd be fine with letting Peraza go as the main part of the package for that - Peterson looks to have 2B under control for a bit, and Mallex looks CF of the future right now."
Braves,3c0160,mycrystalcity,6,Fri Jul 3 19:06:56 2015 UTC,"The question is, can we do better than Jace? How much better will Jace get? Right now he's a fringe-average hitter (wrc+ 96) with above average speed and good defense, netting him a solid 1.5 fwar so far. If he contributes 2.5-3 by the end of the season, that's pretty damn good. Can our top prospect do better?   I don't like the idea of trading a consensus top prospect for a veteran catcher that's a short-term deal. Even if Peraza is expendable with all the middle infield talent we have. If we are going to part with him I'd rather see a deal for a longer term piece with big upside potential elsewhere - 3b, corner OF, but I don't know if that's doable."
Braves,3c0160,drrhythm2,4,Fri Jul 3 19:29:16 2015 UTC,"If we're gonna trade Peraza, I'd kill for a swap for Judge."
Braves,3c0160,drrhythm2,3,Fri Jul 3 19:49:35 2015 UTC,"Aaron Judge? Absolutely. But I think it would take more than Peraza. Judge is two years older but looks pretty darn good in AAA. Interestingly, Peraza was ranked higher during the pre-season. That being said, we need OF prospects with power more than IF prospects and leadoff types at the moment."
Braves,3c0160,mycrystalcity,5,Fri Jul 3 20:54:56 2015 UTC,"I hear what you're saying. And you're right - our top prospect may be better than Jace. However, my mind is tainted by having Uggla man second for so long. Jace feels like an amazing player by juxtaposition at times to me.   Using peraza for a catcher may not be a good bargain, as like you said, corner OF is a major concern (here's to hoping Rio Ruiz can continue improving into our 3B of the future). I don't know what would be the smartest way to use the chips we've got, but I would like to see us use Pwraza to acquire some power hitting from somewhere. I know our motto now is speed, but a big bat to give Freddie protection in 2017 would be killer."
Braves,3c0160,drrhythm2,2,Fri Jul 3 20:35:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think the team needs one more big bat than can hit for average and power. Doesn't necessarily need to be fast as hell or anything, just another big bat. Preferably one that isn't a 25-30% K guy either. Sometimes power can really come in handy. A nice combo in the 3-4 spots in the order."
Braves,3c0160,mycrystalcity,3,Fri Jul 3 20:58:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, spot on. I feel like Jace/Mallex can get on base, and if we acquire a CONSISTENT power bat, our lineup would be great, assuming performers keep performing.  1.Mallex 2.Markakis 3.Freeman 4.consistent power bat 5. Ruiz/Peterson/whoever  then the rest down here, that top 4/5 looks pretty productive to me."
Braves,3c0160,drrhythm2,6,Fri Jul 3 21:15:43 2015 UTC,"Wonder if we'd consider trading Maybin at the deadline or in the offseason. His value has to have really jumped. He hasn't been amazing or anything but solid MLB CF for sure. Wonder how many contenders need that, if any?"
Braves,3c0160,mycrystalcity,3,Fri Jul 3 21:24:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there's a market for it. I was listening to Round Trip last night and those guys were raving about Maybin and his turnaround. He's actually 10th in the league amongst OF's in RBI's, and has better statlines than 2/3 of the guys that lead him in RBI's. It's really surprising how much he's improved.  However, his past I think will haunt him. Teams might be scared to buy on him because of how much better he's been in Atlanta. They'll think ""Oh, well, he's clearly not a west coast player"" and whatnot."
Braves,3c0160,drrhythm2,4,Fri Jul 3 21:29:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe. But he's got that high draft pedigree and the ""never reached his potential"" label (maybe until now), so teams won't look at him as an overachiever, but a guy who has been held back by injuries (although the inability to stay healthy could be an issue). Still, he's a pretty freak athlete. He's been a godsend compared to BJ, who still (unsurprisingly) sucks."
Braves,3c0160,PickShark,0,Fri Jul 3 21:33:08 2015 UTC,"I doubt peraza is the consensus top prospect after this season. I don't know if he'll be significantly better than Peterson in overall value other than the versatility he provides and superior baserunning. I think Peterson is a better hitter than he's shown so far. He has an incredible feel for hitting and its simply a matter of refining his swing. I would imagine seitz can get him to a high .280 low .290 guy with great plate discipline. As for his power, its just a matter of incorporating more of his lower body power into his swing"
Braves,3c0160,drrhythm2,2,Fri Jul 3 20:18:46 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't 100% disagree, but here my counterargument:  Peraza is only 21. In fact, he's barely 21. He's almost a full 6 years younger than the average AAA player. If he isn't the youngest player in AAA, he's damn close. Yet, he has pretty respectable offensive numbers, hitting .284 with 21 SB's and only 4 CS. That's not world-beating by any means, but again, he's barely 21. He beat up A+ and AA pitching and I'm pretty sure he was the youngest player in AA at some point last year.   Just because he's come down to earth somewhat in AAA at such a young age isn't exactly cause for alarm. He hasn't filled out yet and still has plenty to learn, plus he's been tried out at different positions.   Yes, I'd love to see a Bryce Harper like meteoric rise through the minors, but that almost never happens.   Now, can he be better than Jace? I don't know. Maybe they are so close it's worth trading one or the other for a significant piece if possible. We do have some middle-infield types in the system."
Braves,3c0160,BG1234567,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:50:34 2015 UTC,"How about Salty? I know he has bounced around a bit. He has had a chance to get playoff/WS experience, and has caught some really good pitchers. I would bet that we could land him for nothing. Also I like AJ in this role as long as he stays in check. He has a high baseball IQ, but is a bit of an ass hat."
Braves,3c0160,drunkendogsquad,14,Sat Jul 4 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"Some of the comments on that article are great. My personal favorite:   bigh334 • 2 hours ago  This screams Red Sox-they’ve said Blake Swihart is untouchable but the Red Soxs would be stupid not to try and get Touissant, Fried, and Banuelos for Swihart. Course there’d probably be other pieces and things interchanged but Red Sox need young cost controlled pitching. Atlanta needs a young cost controlled catcher.   lol @ THREE of our arms in one trade for a young catcher. No thanks."

Braves,3c0160,PickShark,18,Fri Jul 3 16:38:19 2015 UTC,"Actually Bethancourt wasn't catching well; that was the issue. Too many passed balls. Not good enough blocking.

Braves,3c0160,cman1098,6,Fri Jul 3 16:49:52 2015 UTC,"Sad to say, but gattis was a better catcher behind the plate than anyone on our roster currently."
Braves,3c0160,Taylorenokson,11,Fri Jul 3 16:54:41 2015 UTC,I'd rather have AJ receive and call games for these developing guys than Gattis. I love El Oso Blanco but he isn't a good fit for the team right now.
Braves,3c0160,drrhythm2,3,Fri Jul 3 16:59:16 2015 UTC,But the article said we could use a LF...
Braves,3c0160,DPerman1983,3,Fri Jul 3 21:13:19 2015 UTC,"Gattis was like the opposite of Bethancourt. Didn't have he arm / release time. Was bigger and slower.   But, Gattis had the power bat, and was at least an average blocker and receiver. He didn't give up cheap passed balls. Has he turned around his slow start offensively this year?  I wouldn't mind seeing Bethancourt again. Since being sent down and playing every day he's hitting .327 (over a relatively short time period of course). He's only 23. The hitting has always lagged a bit."
Braves,3c0160,mycrystalcity,3,Fri Jul 3 17:04:54 2015 UTC,Since being sent down and playing every day he's hitting .327 (over a relatively short time period of course)   I really wish Fredi would have just played him. This bullshit about earning it really got to me.
Braves,3c0160,chart589,4,Fri Jul 3 17:18:06 2015 UTC,He was sent down primarily for his mistakes on defense. He had a lot of passed balls prior to being sent down and they also wanted him to work more on his plate framing. They could not rely on him at all with the bullpen struggling the way it was at that time and with so many changes with the staff. He'll figure it out in Gwinnett this year.
Braves,3c0160,the_sega,7,Fri Jul 3 19:21:48 2015 UTC,Maybe we should have let him play more than a max of two games in a row. We had a ridiculously small sample size. Maybe if we didn't let him waste on the bench he could have done better.
Braves,3c0160,vslyke,2,Fri Jul 3 19:52:13 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying about giving him more playtime, but it seems that Hart&co want to still be somewhat competitive, so letting him have a trial by fire wasn't working out. If we were going full Phillies this year, I'd agree with you 100%, but we're trying to keep some of our dignity."
Braves,3c0160,drrhythm2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:20:29 2015 UTC,"Has he turned around his slow start offensively this year?   If you mean Gattis, I believe so.  he got really hot to start May, but he's hovering in the .230s as far as average. he's almost surpassed his RBI total from all of last year (49 this year, 52 total in 2014)  Hope he keeps improving though"
Braves,3c0160,vslyke,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:16:18 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, the bear turned it around quite nicely. He's been consistently producing for the 'stros as DH mostly with occasional tears.   Source: picked him up in fantasy after my friend dropped him in frustration."

Braves,3by9yu,thekidfromyesterday,42,Fri Jul 3 03:48:38 2015 UTC,"Okay, for anyone who's confused, let me give my explination on why we're trading pretty good prospects right now for cap money(at least to the best of my abilites).   The Braves signed two top prospects in the international signing day that was today and that put us over our free agent spending cap number. By making the three trades we made today, we raised our cap to above what we spent on these two players, negating the penalty we would have taken had we not made these trades.   The penalty would be restrictions on next year's signing class. This is a big deal because next year's class has been described as one of the better ones, headlined by Venezuelan SS Kevin Maitan, who has been described as Miguel Cabrera-esque, and the best international pool eligible player since Felix Hernandez. The Braves are, supposedly, frontrunners to more than HALF of the players in the top ten. By avoiding any restrictions because of this year, the Braves are poised to go HAM next year and effectively say fuck the penalties, we'll take them. This is also why we've been willing to take on expiring contracts such as Arroyo's and put so much effort into shipping off Melvin's contract.   This is especially important because 2016 could very well be the last season in which teams can sign international free agents, as in December of next year, the CBA calls for an international draft to be developed, so the Braves ""all-in"" approach makes a ton of sense.   TL;DR- we traded a few players to avoid penalties so that we can go ABSOLUTELY FUCKING HAM on next year's international pool, which could be the last one ever."
Braves,3by9yu,phamalacka,4,Fri Jul 3 03:55:28 2015 UTC,Thank you for this. I understood the immediate implications but didn't really understand how big a deal next years class was.
Braves,3by9yu,bforbravo,2,Fri Jul 3 05:04:45 2015 UTC,"I hope we go HAM next year, regardless of the fact that I have no idea what HAM stands for. Fulencheck was a top-15 prospect, and while I know we are pretty loaded with young arms right now, and even more so after the draft, I still hate seeing him go. The other guys I wasn't feeling too bad about.   That being said we need to start developing some highly athletic young position players. I like the two guys we go this year and if do go HAM (whatever that means - I assume it's good) next year then I'm all for this. But... Are the Braves really going to spend next year what some of the really big teams spent this year or last year on the top, top guys? 15-20 million plus another 15-20 million in penalties like to Dodgers did this year? I'm not sure I'm seeing that...."
Braves,3by9yu,drrhythm2,6,Fri Jul 3 10:44:53 2015 UTC,"I believe HAM was an old, old wooden ship used back in the Civil War era  ...or it's an acronym for ""Hard As A Mother Fucker"" which is technically HAAMF but I digress."

Braves,3bxxv5,Bill__Buttlicker,3,Fri Jul 3 03:59:37 2015 UTC,Hate when that happens. I've gone through 3 keyboards this year because of that.
Braves,3bxxv5,rcsreym,7,Fri Jul 3 12:32:54 2015 UTC,Manny looked fucking great out there. Shades of Glavine on that change. To out-pitch Max fucking Scherzer in your MLB debut is an accomplishment in and of itself. Looking forward to much more outta this guy.  ...and how clutch was Maybin. Love that guy too.
Braves,3bxxv5,LickMyMeatus,3,Fri Jul 3 02:58:09 2015 UTC,Especially after dropping the ball. Glad he didn't let that get in his head.
Braves,3bxxv5,waffles,2,Fri Jul 3 03:02:23 2015 UTC,I like that he addressed that in his post-game. I don't know how much longer we can hang on to him but I'm really glad he's a Brave right now.
Braves,3bxxv5,LickMyMeatus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:09:32 2015 UTC,What do you mean you don't know how much longer we can hold on to him?
Braves,3bxxv5,ThePerfectBeard,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:13:57 2015 UTC,Seems like he is shaping up to be some pretty good trade bait.

Braves,3bxxv5,ThePerfectBeard,6,Fri Jul 3 12:35:02 2015 UTC,Huge props to the pitching going toe to toe with Scherzer. Manny looked great. Glad the injury  was nothing serious.
Braves,3bxxv5,Xonero,3,Fri Jul 3 02:00:14 2015 UTC,thank you so much for these great gifs every game. you've made my braves experience a little better this season.

I get home yesterday to watch the game on television still very hungover, gross, and wearing the same clothes from Wednesday and can't help but say... I think my new good luck charms are a Back to the Future shirt and a pair of galaxy underwear. Cam was SO clutch last night, even with the dropped catch. Man Ban is solid, but needs to stay hydrated and not bean folks."

Braves,3bxxv5,SG8970,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:40:47 2015 UTC,"And, we finally won a series from the Nats!"
Braves,3bxxv5,arch_maniac,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:31:19 2015 UTC,"Good win tonight.  Brings it to 5 games back with 10 games to go until the All-Star break.  With a pretty soft schedule coming up (Phillies, Brewers, Rockies) it's a good chance to catch up a bit.  Would like to see the Braves go 7-3 over the stretch and get back over .500.  And then hope for Freeman to come back quickly after the break."
Braves,3bxxv5,ancalagor,2,Fri Jul 3 02:50:40 2015 UTC,With the way we're hitting and no Freeman I don't think it's likely we go 7-3 without someone coming out of their slump.
Braves,3bxxv5,objectlesson,2,Fri Jul 3 12:34:46 2015 UTC,"We've been showing signs of improvement.  But I think Fredi should try tweaking the lineup a little.  I'd like to see Maybin, Peterson, Simmons, Markakis, Uribe, AJ, Kelly, Eury for a few games.  I know Simmons in the three spot is a bit odd, but he's been hitting much better this season.  We've tried him at the very top of the order and it hasn't worked too well, but I think in a key RBI spot, Simmons might shine!"
Braves,3bxxv5,general_relative,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:13:24 2015 UTC,"I've put some thought into the lineup myself and I haven't really been able to construct one that I'm confident in, so I'm not saying its easy.  I don't like having Markakis in the middle of the lineup because he really does nothing but walk and hit singles.  Kelly should absolutely be 7 or 8 like you have him.  If just one or two guys could actually get hot I'd be singing a different tune, but it seems like everyone is either treading water or slumping right now.  We've been facing a lot of really good pitching, so maybe that's exacerbating the problem.  It could be the case that facing some more vulnerable pitching staffs will get some of the guys going.  I certainly hope so."
Braves,3bxxv5,objectlesson,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:20:31 2015 UTC,I just hope Kelly can get back to where he was before his oblique injury.  That was a fun Kelly to watch!
Braves,3bxxv5,general_relative,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:27:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  He hasn't been the same since coming back from the DL and I was loving what he brought before getting hurt.  Also, after pondering it a bit, Simmons has never had an opportunity to hit third because he's always been on a team with guys like Freeman, Heyward, Upton, etc.  I don't think he's a great hitter but you could be right, maybe giving him that opportunity would spark something in him.  Of course, it's equally likely to  backfire but what do we have to lose?"
Braves,3bxxv5,objectlesson,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:35:12 2015 UTC,"I agree, I don't think the 3 hole is a permanent home for Simmons, but I think he will thrive more in the middle of the lineup (5th or 6th spot) then down at the bottom (7th or 8th).  As for Kelly, I really hope he finds his groove again soon!  That could really lift us till Freddie comes back."
Braves,3bxxv5,general_relative,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:56:21 2015 UTC,"The hitting has been rough, but I don't think it's too unlikely.  Just won 3 of the last 4 against better teams then we'll be playing next (even with Washington hurt a bit).  The bullpen has been at least somewhat serviceable, which helps a lot to stay in games with the offense struggling.  Not going to be easy of course, but I think it's a decent goal for 2 wins from Philly, 2 from Milwaukee, and 3 from Colorado."
Braves,3bxo4r,thekidfromyesterday,3,Fri Jul 3 00:29:19 2015 UTC,"The number 87 slot is worth $249,000...still need about $350,000 to sign the international signees without being unable to sign international players for over $300,000 over the next 2 signing periods..."
Braves,3bxo4r,TheChike,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:38:44 2015 UTC,This makes so little sense to me... We are giving up all these prospects to sign 16 year olds without having to pay a penalty on like 3 million while other teams are spending 10's of millions?
Braves,3bxo4r,drrhythm2,4,Fri Jul 3 01:06:50 2015 UTC,Those teams won't be able to sign any IFA above 300k due to penalties for two years. If we go above our pool we will too. Next year will be our year to splurge on the IFA market.
Braves,3bxo4r,TheChike,2,Fri Jul 3 01:11:37 2015 UTC,"So the front office will do basically anything to get that extra $300k to get under the limit, or we're basically fucked for next year, correct?"
Braves,3bxo4r,KidGold,3,Fri Jul 3 01:24:44 2015 UTC,we'll be in a much better place for the next 5 years if we do.
Braves,3bxo4r,Infield_Fly,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:55:49 2015 UTC,Aren't some teams taking a gamble because they think the penalty will be negotiated away in a CBA that will take effect before the penalty applies? I thought that was a fangraphs article in the offseason but I don't remember the details.
Braves,3bxo4r,TheChike,4,Fri Jul 3 03:14:58 2015 UTC,Yes. Next year is the last year to splurge on.
Braves,3bxo4r,vslyke,2,Fri Jul 3 03:19:04 2015 UTC,"I like to think I know a fair bit about the nuances of baseball, but the international signing period makes no damn sense to me. I would love to see an international draft comparable to the first year player draft...how it goes now just doesn't make sense to me."
Braves,3bxo4r,general_relative,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:12:22 2015 UTC,An international draft would be even worse. You'd destroy the incentives to develop talent and scouting would become an ordeal. The current system is terrible but a draft would make it worse.
Braves,3bxo4r,Storm_Song,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:08:27 2015 UTC,I could be wrong but signing players like Olivera isn't the same as singing these kids. I believe they have to be under 17 by a certain time to be eligible as an international prospect and thus subject to the international bonus pool stuff.   Edit:  Here's a great article that explains how the international prospect signings work.  Scroll down below list of top international prospects for explanation.
Braves,3byj4t,kah88,5,Fri Jul 3 05:14:06 2015 UTC,Struck out the third leading hitter in the bigs three times and made him look fairly silly doing it.   I didn't see every inning but I'm sure nerves played a part. It's not so much that he beat Scherzer so much as he took on a very good lineup and accorded himself well.
Braves,3byj4t,drrhythm2,4,Fri Jul 3 16:53:18 2015 UTC,"I think he only got him twice, but I think Jimmy got him later.  I did not check any source on this, though. either way, Manny Bam Bam Banuelos gave me a serial chubby"
Braves,3byj4t,chart589,4,Fri Jul 3 21:28:13 2015 UTC,"overall, I thought he looked exactly like the pitcher everyone thought he could be when he was a top prospect for the Yankees. id like to personally extend my gratitude to NY for giving up on this guy."

Braves,3bwsex,BenStrike,4,Thu Jul 2 20:31:05 2015 UTC,So what did we effectively get for Cody? Like 400k?
Braves,3bwsex,drrhythm2,7,Thu Jul 2 20:34:45 2015 UTC,"$388,400"
Braves,3bwsex,BenStrike,5,Thu Jul 2 20:41:13 2015 UTC,So I've always heard we were gearing up for next year's international period. Does this not put us in jeopardy of that?  Do we have to make moves to make up the remaining amount and how long do we have to do that?
Braves,3bwsex,MarcusDA,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:25:34 2015 UTC,"It does - not sure how long we have. I'm sure the FO wouldn't go out on a limb like this without being sure that we have the deals in place tho.  Edit: Found a source.   The roughly $638K the Braves have picked up in this pair of trades boosts their bonus pool to $3,095,800. That leaves the Braves about $300K shy of the combined $3.4MM the Braves will reportedly spend on international prospects Derian Cruz and Christian Pache. The team likely will not announce the signings until acquiring additional bonus money, as money cannot be acquired once a team’s spending limitation has been officially reached."
Braves,3bwsex,vslyke,2,Fri Jul 3 02:10:37 2015 UTC,it also saves a spot on our 40 man roster for someone.

Braves,3bwsxq,ttubravesrock,2,Thu Jul 2 23:49:47 2015 UTC,Eh... Fuck it. We've won 2 games in a row against the Nats without him. Leave him out for the season just to see what happens

Braves,3by0wr,Abailly907,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:41:42 2015 UTC,"That's a valid point. If they can trade him for a young power bat, I would be quite okay with that."
Braves,3by0wr,mluna24,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:52:17 2015 UTC,"Also to note, now is not the time to sell on him. We would have to wait for him to get out of his slump. I think it would be a good idea to keep him just so we have a more experienced arm in the rotation to guide the youngsters once they stay in the bigs."
Braves,3by0wr,mdbrockman,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:44:19 2015 UTC,"Depends on whether we think he's going to come out of it. We sold ""low"" on Hanson and it worked out great for us."
Braves,3by0wr,vslyke,2,Fri Jul 3 04:53:01 2015 UTC,Been saying this for a while. I think he's overvalued by some teams and it might work out well. Greinke's trade to MIL gave the Royals a lot of pieces that was a part of their championship roster.
Braves,3by0wr,thekidfromyesterday,2,Fri Jul 3 02:51:30 2015 UTC,"The organization is in a much better state than it was the last few years. I wouldn't even think about trading him if this was 2 years ago. If they can get a similar package the royals got, I would pull the trigger."

Yes, we have a plethora of up-and-coming pitching talent in the minors, but until they force the teams' hand, we should hold on to all the depth we can. Season ending injuries happen and prospects falter all the time."

Braves,3by0wr,danmidwest,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:21:29 2015 UTC,Well he gave up 5 ER in the first.  Did settle and made it through 6 with only one more run in the 6th before he was pulled.   I have faith he will bounce back though.  Like others have said I trust him more to be a solid fixture in our rotation than these guys who have only made 1-2 starts.
Braves,3by0wr,jwoodell3,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:24:12 2015 UTC,"No doubt, I didn't quite mean for Teheran to be traded before the trade deadline, but maybe if these younger guys prove worthy then perhaps Teheran could reel us in a nice hitting prospect or two, even more pitching.

Pache, 16, is 6-foot-1, 180 pounds, drawing praise for his athleticism and potential to stick in center field.

Braves,3bvdx1,kah88,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:36:47 2015 UTC,Where do they go now? What happens now that they're signed?
Braves,3bvdx1,ShongoMcForren,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:44:24 2015 UTC,Probably to Danville.
Braves,3bvdx1,TweetsInCommentsBot,3,Thu Jul 2 14:46:58 2015 UTC,They're just 16 years old. They will play in the Dominican Summer League and probably advance to the GCL to start 2016.
Braves,3bwd1r,hickmatt,3,Thu Jul 2 18:16:36 2015 UTC,"http://www.baseballamerica.com/international/2015-16-mlb-international-bonus-pools/  From MLBTR: Clubs that spend over their allotment face escalating penalties, ranging from 100% taxes on overages to a two-year ban on $300K+ international bonuses (for going over 15% above the total allocation). This year, the team with the top overall pool allocation — the Diamondbacks ($5,393,900) — is ineligible to spend more than that amount on any single player, and is expected to deal away some of its capacity since it cannot put it to full use. Likewise, the Angels, Rays, Red Sox, and Yankees face that limitation due to budget-busting deals in the 2014-15 July 2 period. And numerous additional clubs are expected to incur future signing limitations in the coming signing period. While most of the players subject to the signing rules are a long ways away from the big leagues, there are undoubtedly impact players among them — some of whom could come up in trade talks long before they’re close to the majors.  Long story short, unless we trade someone for some more bonus pool money,we will likely face 100% taxes or a limit on signing bonuses capped at $300k."
Braves,3bwd1r,BenStrike,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:27:44 2015 UTC,"So the Dodgers spent $16,000,000 so now they cannot sign anyone for 2 years over $300,000?"
Braves,3bwd1r,BenStrike,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:32:06 2015 UTC,"More or less. They blew it the fuck away. Same thing the Red Sox and Yanks did last year. But their thinking is, the CBA expires in 2016, they want an international draft in the next one, so who cares? They also get taxed 100% on all their overages."
Braves,3bwd1r,danmidwest,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:25:40 2015 UTC,Can we get an ELI5 or ten?
Braves,3bwd1r,BenStrike,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:09:54 2015 UTC,"Teams get international bonus pool money based on reverse winning percentage, ie worst team gets the most money.  If you spend more than your pool, you can only spend $300k the next 2 years, and get taxed 100% on the overage.  Braves signed 2 guys that pushed them over, so we have been trading for other teams bonus slot money, so we don't get fined. So we can go crazy next year, because the CBA is getting redone in 2016 and this broke ass system will be fixed.  TLDR: We don't have enough money, gotta trade for more so we don't get fined, so we can sign lots of people next year, cause it is a better class.  This does not matter to Doyers because they have infinite money."
Braves,3bwd1r,datajosh,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:23:03 2015 UTC,The extra bonus pool money we had was for the 2014-15 signing period and we're now in a new signing period. DOB thinks more trades will be made to increase our bonus pool money for this period to prevent the penalties.
Braves,3bvrj2,PWNtimeJamboree,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:32:24 2015 UTC,"I also noticed that in 250 plate appearances in our system, no homers. No triples. Only 10 doubles. I'm not drawing any conclusions, just hoping his power returns.   Still feels like our system is light on offensive talent. Particularly guys with the potential to hit for average and power. And I know arms can be traded in the future. Talent is talent. Looks like Braxton has been improving too. Maybe he'll pan out.   /rambling"
Braves,3bvrj2,drrhythm2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:44:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with the Ruiz assessment. Still, it gives me hope to see that he's taking the right approach at the plate. Not doing too much, trying to get on base. The power numbers will find themselves in time if he continues to keep the strike out numbers low."
Braves,3bvrj2,BombSquad123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:09:54 2015 UTC,"Ruiz's power has vanished so far this year, but hopefully will come back with time. Davidson can hit it a long way, sometimes. I would like to see more than 6 home runs from someone who was drafted as the ""best prep power hitter.""  Offensively I am a bit concerned with the farm system, as we are very much focused on the pitching depth. Hopefully we can counter that in the future by packaging some of the arms and acquiring a good bat or two because I am not sure there are many future major league hitters in our farm system right now."
Braves,3bvrj2,drrhythm2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:10:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I mean, I like all the little fast guys, but we can't have a team full of them. Smith and Peraza and Albies could be a lot of fun, but they seem like very similar players in a lot of ways. Fast, little power, good contact... Even the international guys we just signed kinda seem in that mold. Okay, those can be nice pieces, but I think you need a few offensive stars in the order (like Freeman) who can hit for average and power. That's what we seem to be lacking. Still, an abundance of talent in the minors always means trades are possible."

Braves,3bu42y,Bill__Buttlicker,11,Thu Jul 2 06:10:51 2015 UTC,"So glad they won. Almost unbelievable that they finally snapped the streak. Maybe it will slightly help getting the Nats out of their head a bit.   One thing I couldn't help but get a little obsessed about was the almost homerun to Uggla. First of all, just imagining the frustration of him getting the better of them again and it possibly leading to another blown game with Uggla doing a significant portion of the damage was brutal. After losing 9 in a row to them and a couple of blown games thanks to Uggla already. It was way too close.   Uggla has 1 frickin homerun this year and it was against the Braves and they almost made it 2, both pretty pivotal. It's bad enough they're paying the guy, but for him to be having such a terrible year and almost getting the better of the Braves again? It was too fucking close. Not many almost homeruns from the opposing team can get me this worked up but that did. Too close.  Needed the rant. Whew.... Now to enjoy the win and dream of them winning the series."
Braves,3bu42y,SG8970,6,Thu Jul 2 04:16:57 2015 UTC,I swear he just feeds off of the boos from our home crowd.  we need to just sit silent with our hands in our laps until he is out

Braves,3bu8vy,thekidfromyesterday,3,Fri Jul 3 00:41:32 2015 UTC,Well shit.
Braves,3bu8vy,C-Jammin,3,Fri Jul 3 00:43:01 2015 UTC,"Oh crap. For a guy who has already been through TJ this is very, very bad."
Braves,3bu8vy,chart589,3,Fri Jul 3 00:43:13 2015 UTC,damn it! ...here comes the bullpen. yaaaay :(
Braves,3bu8vy,EatsPancakes,3,Fri Jul 3 00:43:36 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched the Braves in a while, does our bullpen still suck?"

Braves,3bu8vy,C-Jammin,2,Fri Jul 3 00:44:49 2015 UTC,"In comparison to earlier in the year, it's fantastic.  In comparison to earlier in the year though, so that's not saying a lot."

Braves,3bu8vy,HateMcLouth,3,Fri Jul 3 00:50:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't think Manny would hit the majors after he was in a long phase hanging around AA/AAA with average results in the Yankees system. Glad to see him put up these numbers. So is he going to be a regular in the rotation, or was this just a spot start?"
Braves,3bu8vy,TP4MGR,2,Fri Jul 3 01:02:51 2015 UTC,"He's on an innings limit, so he'll probably be bumped to the pen once Perez gets back."
Braves,3bu8vy,thekyle1591,2,Fri Jul 3 01:04:27 2015 UTC,He looked damn good. He didn't throw a ton of balls in the strike zone but he got dudes to chase. Stuff looked good. I can see why he'd have been a top prospect if he used to throw 97. Sad to see the injury.

Braves,3bu8vy,cteez910,3,Fri Jul 3 01:42:42 2015 UTC,Ooooh.  That might have been a foul ball.

Braves,3bu8vy,TP4MGR,2,Fri Jul 3 01:04:44 2015 UTC,"Supposedly Maybin's an elite defender, but I always thought BJ's defense was lackluster and he seems to be superior defensively."

Braves,3bu8vy,PickShark,3,Thu Jul 2 23:25:11 2015 UTC,i feel like he's getting better as the game progresses. like the usual deal with trips through the order being more dangerous each time.... it doesnt apply here.
Braves,3bu8vy,kah88,3,Fri Jul 3 00:18:19 2015 UTC,Really got a feel for his curve after the 2nd inning.  Has made a huge difference.

Even if Moylan doesn't make it all the way back to the MLB team, I wonder how open he'd be to the idea of being a coach in the Braves system in the future."

Braves,3brs4x,thunderhayes,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:42:52 2015 UTC,"The Mel Gibson thing was more of a subtle reference to the third Crocodile Dundee. But yeah, if I was the area that was the ""exporter"" of Mel Gibson, I'm not sure I'd lay claim to him either. Now, another Mel...er...Mal...Malcolm Young, that's another story.  Getting mistaken for Wolverine? Not a bad look...not a bad look at all."
Braves,3brs4x,bforbravo,2,Thu Jul 2 15:06:08 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he's actually acting as a player-coach right now. Although that might have changed when he was promoted to AAA.

We talked about how absurdly expensive living in Australia is, and that he still lives in the Atlanta area, mostly because it's so much more affordable.  I hope he sets up deep, long-term roots there and continues to be involved with the organization.  I can see it now: Chipper - hitting coach, Moylan - pitching coach.... Eric Hinske ???? - manager...  I'm still working out the last one."

Braves,3brs4x,captbonus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:02:53 2015 UTC,"yeah, he was a player coach at AA level before all of the bullpen difficulties, and he was pitching really well so they moved him to gwinnett about a month ago.  One of my favorite  braves of the last several years."
Braves,3bw409,chopchop51,12,Thu Jul 2 17:08:31 2015 UTC,"I feel what you're saying, and he's gotten better, but I don't think he should/would be the manager to lead us to the promised land in 2017."
Braves,3bw409,mycrystalcity,7,Thu Jul 2 17:25:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call him ""good"", but in my eyes he has improved to ""good enough""."
Braves,3bw409,Taylorenokson,3,Thu Jul 2 17:38:14 2015 UTC,"Regardless of his improvement, I still would rather have a new manager."
Braves,3bw409,knutts21,3,Thu Jul 2 17:15:15 2015 UTC,"I think that under his tenure the braves have had A LOT of problems.  The awful lineup of 2014, alot of pitching injuries, a complete collapse of Uggla AND the BJ quandry...   I dont think thats all to be hung on him.  Also, I know hes been ripped for pitching management. Sure he blew the bullpen out of the water his first year (forget, 2012?) but we have to remember how many 1 run and extra inning games were that season. they were always in contention and every game could have been the lost that cost em a playoff spot.   Kimbrel in teh bullpen in the 8th against the Dodgers? Easy move to second guess, but had he played it different it still might not have workedo ut and then he'd be getting ripped for THAT.  His main weakness in my eye is that he doesnt come out and get between players and umpires that arent getting along. Theres no excuse for a player to be tossed for arguing balls and strikes a manager MUST get himself into that and diffuse it or step on the grenade and take the ejection for himself..."
Braves,3bw409,y2knole,3,Thu Jul 2 17:53:24 2015 UTC,"Also, I think that as long as Scheurholz is in charge and is taking advice and keeping up the involvement of Bobby Cox, the manager will be Fredi Gonzalez or someone virtually indistinguishable from him."
Braves,3bw409,y2knole,3,Thu Jul 2 18:12:37 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  Simply put, his biggest problem in the past has been horrible bullpen management.  This year there is no bullpen to manage.  The way this team is covers up his biggest flaws."
Braves,3bw409,OldSchoolMewtwo,2,Thu Jul 2 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"I see your point and i certainly dont think he was bad but lets just not forget how bad and frustrating this team was last year. We had the talent to compete in the playoffs and we collasped. Also, i dont like the way he has managed injuries thus far. Freddie freeman could be possibly out on the field right now if Fredi had not let him play half of the Red Sox series hurt. Not only that, he was incredibly stupid for letting Williams Perez continue to pitch agaisnt the Pirates after that line drive got him. I was at that game and Perez just looked very uncomfortble after he got hit during his practice pitches. The two guys Perez let on after that went on to score and that was the decinding factor in the game. Also there were some very stupid subsitutions in that series. Anyways, besides those gripes ive been okay with him for the lost part but i think the majority of the credit for this season has to go to the Front Office"
Braves,3bw409,FreeFreddieHugs,2,Thu Jul 2 19:04:53 2015 UTC,I don't think he's a bad manager I just wish he would argue with the umps more to light a fire when the team needs it
Braves,3bw409,Dirty_Mike_n_da_Boyz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:58:42 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree that he's been ""good""...I think he's just been in the right place a the right time where this young team is doing pretty decent and he gets some additional respect (compared to the norm) because of such.  The guy is an average manager in my opinion...not bad...not good...just kind of there for the ride."
Braves,3bw409,MonkeyManJohannon,0,Fri Jul 3 04:16:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he is a good or a bad manager.  But we are the 4th worst team in baseball, and we are worse than every team in the American League.  We have had the third easiest schedule, and he has done well to keep us near .500.  But I confess I want us to be sellers at the deadline. Going for it in 2015 is not what's best for the future.  We are below average at both hitting and pitching. We have the worst bullpen statistically.  Expect him to have a lame duck 2016, and then 2017----bam.  New ballpark, new GM (not interim), new manager."
Braves,3bw409,gobigred3562,5,Thu Jul 2 17:25:26 2015 UTC,But we are the 4th worst team in baseball   Really because our record has us middle of the pack.
Braves,3bw409,cymmot,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:37:27 2015 UTC,"Yep. We're like 18th in record. That list has us at #27, while a team with the same record as us (Cleveland) is #15"
Braves,3bw409,Snowmittromney,6,Thu Jul 2 19:52:35 2015 UTC,These advanced measurements are officially a joke. The 4th worst team would be the one with the 4th worst record.
Braves,3bw409,cymmot,2,Thu Jul 2 19:57:57 2015 UTC,john Hart isnt a GM technically. i fully expect Coppolella to take over in 2018 after Hart gets one year at the new stadium.

Braves,3bslnh,TP4MGR,20,Wed Jul 1 21:18:48 2015 UTC,Freddie Freeman and Bryce Harper are very different players.
Braves,3bslnh,Taylorenokson,-34,Thu Jul 2 00:39:21 2015 UTC,I know. Bryce is a lot better.
Braves,3bslnh,thekyle1591,21,Thu Jul 2 02:37:32 2015 UTC,"Lol, they are different players not because of their talent but because of how they approach the game. Simple example, Freddie would never drag his foot across the nationals W out of spite to the fans for booing him. Bryce has and would again"
Braves,3bslnh,general_relative,-31,Thu Jul 2 02:39:46 2015 UTC,Maybe Bryce wouldn't have done that if he wasn't showered with Boos? Lol
Braves,3bslnh,thekyle1591,17,Thu Jul 2 02:54:27 2015 UTC,"Freddie is booed and he's never done anything like it. Regardless, Bryce is a professional and is heckled on a daily basis, if his way of handling it is vandalism then he deserves all the criticism he's getting and much more! Cmon man, you really can't be blaming the fans for his behavior, this is just getting silly."
Braves,3bslnh,general_relative,9,Thu Jul 2 02:56:53 2015 UTC,"Don't call it vandalism, I hate the guy as much as anyone but he didn't vandalize anything. Just his typical clown move bro"
Braves,3bslnh,AYoungOldMan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:05:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe if he wasn't an asshat we wouldn't boo him? He's not a terrible player, but he's such an ass. It's not like Turner field doesn't cheer for star opposing players as they come on deck... it's the player not the fans. See Andrew McCutcheon for another example of a big name with a big attitude we boo."
Braves,3bslnh,SquelchMePlz,-4,Thu Jul 2 04:07:12 2015 UTC,It might have to do with the fact that braves fans are as classless as they come

Aside from Aroid, I don't see anyone else the rest of season we would boo.  When it comes down to it, we're at the park to see good baseball even if it's from the other team. Just because you're not playing on your home field shouldn't mean you disrespect fans. Harper has earned his boos, but if he changed his attitude non-Nationals fans would be more accepting of him."

Braves,3bslnh,TP4MGR,-26,Fri Jul 3 04:23:00 2015 UTC,"When you've been the best player in baseball during your age 22 season, you can act like a ""child"", although I don't know how being reluctant to run to first on a popup with a bad hamstring is being a child. Keep hating barves fans. Harper will just keep owning you for the next 10+ years."
Braves,3bslnh,thekyle1591,16,Thu Jul 2 00:45:06 2015 UTC,You get paid millions of dollars to play a game. Pretend like you give a shit and show some hustle. There are 1000 kids right behind you that would love to show some hustle for half that price.
Braves,3bslnh,thedriftknig,-26,Thu Jul 2 00:49:43 2015 UTC,Hamstring is hurt. Can those 1000 kids put up a 5.0 WAR through half a year?
Braves,3bslnh,thekyle1591,11,Thu Jul 2 01:37:27 2015 UTC,"If you're hurt then sit on a bench somewhere. Who knows what kind of MLB WAR you could put up if the guy that's standing in you're way is walking off the field on a ball in play.   I get it. The guy is pretty talented. But waking off the field on a ball in play is lazy. And if you're too hurt to hustle, then go sit out and stop taking up someone else's spot to play."
Braves,3bslnh,thedriftknig,-21,Thu Jul 2 01:40:09 2015 UTC,Or maybe you don't try and make a nagging hamstring injury worse. The Braves ragging Harper is just getting sad at this point.

The stupid fucking hair. Dragging his feet through the A. Snippy interview comments. Extreme hustle on one play and total lackluster play on the other. If he's going to be the face of the MLB, he has to be held to a higher standard. Saying ""he's just a kid"" isn't a good excuse, he's been in the league long enough now. The kid's a bit of a dick-wad, and I hope he grows up some."

The funny this is that he cannot read this manual.   He continuously mentions the same old things all season and it's different every year. This year it's small-ball and hitting with RISP and he talks about them like he just learned about them yesterday.   The gulf between Jim & Don and Chip & Joe is about as wide as the Pacific Ocean. Maybe my distaste for Chip has something to do with how much more enjoyable listening to the radio is.   As for Joe, I don't hate him but he's gotten progressively worse the longer he's worked with Chip. I remember when Chip took over for Boog Sciambi and it was so painfully clear that Joe thought Chip was a total moron. Now Joe is just falling in to the same easy, low-hanging traps that Chip has led him to."

Braves,3btwjt,Dizzydsmith,6,Thu Jul 2 04:00:07 2015 UTC,2.5 hour rain delay. All pitch counts aren't equal. Just as 85 pitches filled with constant men on base and loud outs aren't equal to 105 filled with 1-2-3 innings and few runners on base
Braves,3btwjt,y2knole,3,Thu Jul 2 06:08:34 2015 UTC,"in postgame, fredi said it was because he saw that the nats were getting better and better atbats against him.

Braves,3bsgzw,Frostthesnowman,5,Wed Jul 1 19:56:46 2015 UTC,"It's common everywhere, but I think the Braves have been extremely unlucky lately. I've worked with many pitchers over the years and help maintain and rehabilitate their arms. Mechanics are very important and listening to their individual bodies is key. Guys work through lots of minor aches and pains almost year round and it can lead to lots of arm problems. I think because the Braves emphasize so much on good pitching, guys push themselves to get one of those coveted spots on the big league roster."
Braves,3bsgzw,DPerman1983,3,Wed Jul 1 21:04:37 2015 UTC,"Posted this Grantland article last time Venters and O'Flaherty came up.  FTA:   Since the start of the 2011 season, O’Flaherty has appeared in 161 regular-season games, 55 of them on less than a day’s worth of rest. Venters appeared in 151 games, 49 of them after having pitched the day before. And last week, we found out that both of them would be headed for Tommy John surgery — in Venters’s case, for a second time."
Braves,3bsgzw,we_just_are,2,Wed Jul 1 23:53:11 2015 UTC,I think Fredi does a fine job with the starters but he will destroy some relievers (as long as they aren't the closer).

Braves,3boac5,Unc1233,4,Tue Jun 30 20:33:55 2015 UTC,"Ughh this is a punch in the gut. It will probably make it clearer for management to be sellers rather than buyers as the deadline approaches.   Silver lining: If we weren't going to make the playoffs even with a healthy Freeman and even a few deadline deals, then it is better this way. Now we have no talent given up, with Freeman out it gives other players a chance to get some AB's, and it let's us have the long term health of our pitchers in clear focus. Don't get me wrong, I hate when the Braves lose, but it was a long shot for us to make the playoffs with Freeman. Perhaps now the inevitable will be a little easier to swallow."
Braves,3boac5,KaptainKoala,2,Tue Jun 30 21:21:39 2015 UTC,"I can't abide losing but making this team better the next couple years by being sellers at the deadline is fine. I just won't be able to watch them play this season, just check the scores and read the news."

Braves,3bpf2z,Chief_Noc-A-Homa,12,Wed Jul 1 02:18:46 2015 UTC,Uribe really eats up Carpenter. Much better from this perspective.
Braves,3bpf2z,cbBRAVOS,2,Wed Jul 1 02:34:56 2015 UTC,It would have been better if he did it last time they faced each other.  I believe a homer there would have given us a late lead...

Braves,3bpf2z,Gotem87,3,Wed Jul 1 02:38:10 2015 UTC,Maybe he was still trapped in the closet?
Braves,3bpf2z,SG8970,6,Wed Jul 1 02:40:32 2015 UTC,This feels bad.
Braves,3bpf2z,NIU_1087,6,Wed Jul 1 02:21:05 2015 UTC,"I actually miss when the bullpen was the main problem. At least then it felt like the offense gave them a chance to win every day.   This streak against the Nationals is pathetic and it's obviously in their heads completely.   I don't want to give up, but it looks like it's starting to turn into the season it was suppose to be before the offense kicked off the year better than we expected.   I wonder how different the last 7 games would have been with Freddie. Completely changes the line-up. It's a viable excuse that Freddie going down hurt them a lot, but if they can't do better than this without him, that's a bigger flaw with the team.   I wasn't even planning on saying much of anything, but I just started writing and rant completed."
Braves,3bpf2z,SG8970,5,Wed Jul 1 02:37:03 2015 UTC,"If anything, our recent struggles have shown me how valuable Freddie is to our offense as well as defense  in other words PLEASE COME BACK SOON FREDDIE GOD DAMN IT"
Braves,3bpf2z,LickMyMeatus,2,Wed Jul 1 04:49:09 2015 UTC,"i don't think it was ever in question. but how many championship teams rely so heavily on one guy? look at goldschmidt in arizona, stanton in miami, cruz in seattle, braun in milwaukee, tulowitzki in colorado...it just doesn't pay off to build around one guy."
Braves,3bpf2z,Begotten912,3,Wed Jul 1 05:22:20 2015 UTC,"Not many, it's always a team effort. Atlanta doesn't want to build around one random stud, we want to build around lights-out pitching which I am totally fine with. Pitching > hitting at the end of the day."

Braves,3bjk5z,Lennac,7,Mon Jun 29 19:16:43 2015 UTC,I'm glad he's ok but to me it looked like he was acting like he was in pain to distract from the fact he ruined a catchable fly ball play.
Braves,3bjk5z,kngghst,6,Tue Jun 30 00:36:43 2015 UTC,"I knew the Braves won, and I heard the crash, but didn't see it on TV in the house, but watching this, it seemed like a severe lack of communication and willingness to fall back. It appears that Maybin might have caught the ball, if not for Eury.  From what I've been able to derive from looking at a seating map (for the rough scale of the outfield mainly, without perspective distortions), a few pictures of the outfield of PNC Park, and what I've been able to derive of MLB outfield roles, that was a centerfielder ball.  Perhaps the worst thing about the relatively new Braves outfield (well, not rookie players, but new to playing with each other players) and somewhat shaky outfield lineup (especially with Kelly Johnson having to play some infield after Freeman's injury) is the lack of ""gel"" in the outfield. They are good players, but not fully used to what the other ones can do.  In the prime of Andruw Jones, most of the Braves LF's would've fallen back if they even caught a glimpse of him because he was known for great coverage. The Braves OF's just don't have that confidence in each other right now IMO."

Braves,3bjyka,AnEternalEnigma,7,Mon Jun 29 23:38:01 2015 UTC,60 day is where a team stashes guys that are hurt and will be gone for an extended period of time. The 60-day clears up a 40 man roster spot. Anyone who gets Tommy John ends up on the 60-day.
Braves,3bjyka,FriendlyFreeman,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:59:41 2015 UTC,Yep. And the 60-day DL stops a player's service clock from ticking because he's no longer on the 40-man roster.

Braves,3bjyka,jhey22,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:02:35 2015 UTC,The Godfather's quotes for it. Granted it's pretty vague.
Braves,3bjyka,jhey22,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:40:46 2015 UTC,"Here's how it's going to shake down:  If the Braves are still in playoff contention, they will do nothing but keep the team they have now. Juan Uribe was the best it was going to get. If they can ripoff a team and get a relief pitcher, then sure. But if they are still in playoff contention, they will simply do nothing. They will be neither buyers or sellers.  If they do collapse and give up the ghost for 2015, Cameron Maybin will be sure to go. Sell high on him for sure. Kelly Johnson would probably go too. Perhaps Uribe gets spun off to someone again. But I don't see a total bloodletting happening."
Braves,3bjyka,humma__kavula,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:57:40 2015 UTC,"I can see them trading Maybin, but Kelly Johnson not so much. Maybin's value is at its highest right now, and he's young, while Kelly is having a decent year, it's not enough to get anything good in return. Though I imagine if we do trade Maybin, we would have to eat some salary in order to get good players in return."
Braves,3bjyka,AJnAtlanta13,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:42:10 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how we play the next month, and how the gNats do. If they continue to surge and we sputter we will be selling some of the expendable players like jim johnson and Grilli. If we can find a groove again and take some games from the gNats then we will prolly try to buy some bullpen help"
Braves,3bjyka,humma__kavula,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:28:09 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest move is Maybin being dealt. He's a great player, overperforming drastically from what we believed he'd produce. The simple fact is he will never be more valuable. Other pieces like Grilli, Johnson and Pierzynski will probably be on the move as well. Even the veteran, clubhouse guys like Uribe and Gomes if opportunities arise."
Braves,3bjyka,thekidfromyesterday,3,Tue Jun 30 07:26:50 2015 UTC,"I just don't want to get rid of Maybin. I love him too much, but I realize with guys like Mallex playing well and Peraza switching to CF we have solid backups. Plus he's got the great contract.   Edit: and I'll be damned if I let Kelly leave again"
Braves,3bjyka,humma__kavula,0,Tue Jun 30 07:39:48 2015 UTC,"Adding onto it, Kelly Johnson and Ciriaco could be of interest to other teams too"
Braves,3bjyka,LickMyMeatus,-11,Tue Jun 30 07:28:56 2015 UTC,I saw we shock everyone and trade Freeman. For this we get the rest of the pitchers and catchers that we already didn't grab in the offseason. This will play out long term when a team has a player go down and no one in the minors to calls up to replace them.

Braves,3bkf0u,LickMyMeatus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:33:15 2015 UTC,"I've had those seats before, it's not so much the barrier obstructing the view as it is how fuckin far away from everything you are."
Braves,3bimb0,Evil_Puppy,2,Mon Jun 29 15:08:46 2015 UTC,"Likely our best hitting prospect at the moment. Although I believe Davidson is more projectable and has a higher ceiling thanks to his size, ability to get on base, and power potential. The latter being something Albies will likely never provide. However, Albies is a bit more advanced at the moment.  I still love Peraza, but it's a tad distressing that his OBP has taken a step backwards this season. Although having him play in center field likely didn't help his hitting as he tried to learn a new position. Still, he's young for his level and should be a solid regular (hopefully for us) sometime next season."
Braves,3bimb0,Storm_Song,3,Mon Jun 29 21:10:46 2015 UTC,"Other than the weak arm, he reminds me of Furcal.  Quick, good glove, and a bit of pop to hit balls into the gaps.  I wonder if he'll stick at SS though with a weak arm and Simmons being there for hopefully the next 100000 years."
Braves,3bimb0,hecrey,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:34:20 2015 UTC,maybe he can turn into the 2nd of the future and he and Simmons can have some good years together.

I hated what I went for at the time, and was immature, and got dropped from classes. So until my GPA and completion rate is acceptable I'm ineligible. I also have one outstanding loan that is keeping me from any financial aid. Which I'm ok with paying it myself for a couple semesters, but I happened to get laid off due to no work, and now I'm not making enough to be able to afford it. On top of that my schedule isn't near as flexible anymore. I am committed to doing it, it just looks like I'm going to have to postpone a little longer.   Oh and I think my last comment was slightly ambiguous but I do know what I want. I'm majoring in Physics. It might have taken a few years, but I finally found what I love, and after a couple years of hard deliberation and thought I've committed myself to it. I have a long term plan and everything.

My mom didn't like it but it most definitely helped shape my life (I life guarded/taught swim lessons at the Y and met a bunch of cool people right after I moved out.) Also helped me shape some healthy life skills for the future.   Story told, I went back to school and my degree hasn't meant shit frankly. It's all about social skills/who you know.

Probably my low point of the season after 8 straight losses to the Nats and friday/saturday. On top of losing Freddie, which doesn't help. I wonder if maybe with his help they win 2 of those 5 losses this week.   My optimism is shot when they play the nationals and it seems like it's the same for the players. At this point, I'm just hoping they can avoid 3 sweeps and 11 losses in a row.   Then again if they can somehow win the series, that'd be a big boost."

Braves,3bdqx1,ethyn408,2,Mon Jun 29 05:09:27 2015 UTC,Probably a good bullpen/long relief arm. No room in the rotation after this year but he's been doing real well.

Looking at the angle with the camera on the left you can see his hand got in there in slow motion, which I think is enough. Other angles make it look like he's out, but they aren't angles where you can see separation between the catcher's glove and the runner. Just my 2 cents though"

For them to get comparable seats at the new stadium, it woudl be $40k up front AND ON TOP OF THAT, the per game ticket price doubles.  Hes said ""I could buy a brand new big screen tv for every member of my family for every single home game and come out ahead. and thats not even including the 2 mandatory preseason games""  Welcome to the new age.  And also, get ready, the day after they closed, the new Hawks ownership says they need a new arena or significant renovation to Phillips.  You get 3 guesses who will pay for that.  The first 2 dont count.  I love my sports, but as a huge fan of the braves and FSU Football (where this is even more apparent) theres a fundamental overemphasis placed on them by society."
Braves,3b972e,y2knole,5,Sat Jun 27 12:00:37 2015 UTC,"Schiller told Cavitt the vast increase in premium seats means they will be more expensive, but come with more of the extras at the ballpark fans have long been clamoring for.

Only thing I can figure is that his existing seats at The Ted are not considered ""premium"", and the expansion of ""premium"" seating at Suntrust would mean his seats at Suntrust are now considered ""premium"".   As if there aren't already enough empty seats in The Ted's Suntrust section (that shit is easily $500/game and up), they're expanding it for the new park.

Braves,3b5cdm,y2knole,9,Fri Jun 26 16:12:48 2015 UTC,Andruw Jones is the reason I played center field and practiced diving for catches. Damn shame he faded the way he did.
Braves,3b5cdm,nqmt,9,Fri Jun 26 08:45:21 2015 UTC,"looking back, I thought he'd probably struck out somewhere near 300 times (relax im kidding) in 2005 when he hit 51 homers. That was pretty much what cost him the MVP to Pujols IIRC, everyone said his K rate was a liability.  Actually it was only 128 strikeouts.  and his BA was only .263... Compare with Melvin/BJ who had ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT last year.  Man the games changed in 10 years."
Braves,3b5cdm,maskedfox007,17,Fri Jun 26 10:53:10 2015 UTC,"I remember people used to criticize Andruw for being lackadaisical because he seemed no nonchalant in the field but I think that's the reason why he was one of my favorite players on the braves. He made playing Center field look boring because he was so good. I loved it everytime he would jog under a ball and catch a ball at his belly button.  The closest thing we have to Andruw now, in terms of defense, is Andrelton and I'm loving every minute of it"
Braves,3b5cdm,OMTH,14,Fri Jun 26 03:41:04 2015 UTC,"Right. It always annoyed me when people would argue that Edmonds was a better CF. Edmonds would make spectacular catches on balls that Jones would make look like cans of corn. Edmonds was fine, but it really isn't a contest."

Braves,3b5cdm,wiseoldfox,8,Fri Jun 26 20:42:44 2015 UTC,He was two or three good seasons away from it. Unfortunately his career imploded instead.
Braves,3b5cdm,cosmicplacebo,13,Fri Jun 26 12:57:52 2015 UTC,"I believe Andruw was the best centerfielder in baseball for about a decadex but I don't see enshrinement in Cooperatown happening. He, like Piaza, is rumored to have been a PED user. Unfair as it may be, suspicion equates to guilt for many BBWA folks. His decline was so sudden and drastic, this also damages his chances. The domestic violence allegations don't help either."
Braves,3b5cdm,Hugo_5t1gl1tz,15,Fri Jun 26 03:45:41 2015 UTC,I think his decline may be attributed to a possible false birth certificate than PED. He broke in at age 19 if memory serves. Tack 2 or 3 yrs to that and the decline looks more in line with the norm. Just an opinion.

Braves,3b5cdm,santa_91,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:14:43 2015 UTC,"He was good, but not good enough. You have to have a longer career than that. His last 5 years in the majors were absolutely terrible. He also struck out a ton."
Braves,3b5cdm,Dizzydsmith,-4,Fri Jun 26 18:42:37 2015 UTC,"As a Braves fan- no. He doesn't belong. Some of the best CF ever, but his numbers aren't there. Also, 51* homers? Yeah.. PED."
Braves,3b5cdm,santa_91,3,Fri Jun 26 13:25:43 2015 UTC,"It's not like he was only hitting 20-25 every year and then just randomly hit 51. He was consistently in the mid 30s. Chipper never hit 40+ outside of that one year he hit 45, but he has never been tied to PEDs. If Andruw was juicing he did a great job of hiding it under the gut he was developing at that point in his career."

Braves,3b84i4,Tater_Rock,4,Fri Jun 26 21:30:53 2015 UTC,I'm really not sure what Fredi's obsession is with this kid. He has not proved he can handle big league hitters.  Maybe it's just that we used our pen a lot yesterday and he wants a proper long arm in the pen.  But we have one spot open on the 40 man and there are a few Gwinnett pitchers that have pitched really well this year and I think deserve a chance at the show.

He got rid of Shreve and Carpenter for Banny, who still profiles as a reliever, gave away Varvarro for nothing, and gave Markakis $11 mil a year to hit singles.  He's done a lot of good trades, but there have been plenty of head scratchers as well."

Braves,3b35th,vslyke,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:15:12 2015 UTC,Banuelos worst case projection is as a reliever. Shreeve and Carpenter are both replaceable arms who Hart turned into a possible #2-3. Great deal imo.

Braves,3b35th,cymmot,5,Thu Jun 25 21:31:02 2015 UTC,Young pitching and financial flexibility may be the two most crucial assets in a rebuild. Add the promise of a few outstanding potential up and coming position players and it has been remarkable what Hart has done is such a brief stint. Young talent and the money to bring in proven veteran bats and arms are the recipe to bringing championship  club back to Atlanta.

Braves,3b4ixc,AnEternalEnigma,3,Fri Jun 26 00:08:40 2015 UTC,I agree that we looked good in one and two; Freddie's bat probably wins at least one of those games for us if he is healthy.

Even if they do somehow do well this weekend, they have to look less pathetic against the Nats next week. Looks like the nats are completely in their heads and they're just anticipating the loss and waiting for it to happen. 8 losses in a row to them.  Sure it didn't help that Freddie was gone, but still.   Then again, maybe they're just showing that this is truly what the ""rebuilding year"" was suppose to be. Not sure how much I can stomach vs the Nats next week if they look that outmatched again. Watching them play the nationals is the least fun I've had watching them all year. It's a struggle to keep from yelling at the TV like an idiot. There have been rough stretches, especially with the pen, but for a pretty optimistic fan, I have absolutely zero faith in them vs the Nationals compared to playing other teams. Just like them, I expect the loss and wait for it to happen.   If they could take 2 of 3 vs the Pirates and Nats coming up, that'd be a big help. Won't get my hopes up."

And then all the work of the pen only to not capitalize in time for them to inevitably  blow it. Yay for getting our hopes up again and falling on their faces. This is almost making me hate baseball.     I like Chip being surprised that Zimmerman ""wasn't pitching like he had a 5 ERA"". Not surprising at all with the way the Braves play the Nats. C'mon Chip.     We joked about it beforehand because the Nats winning scores kept getting lower, but the frickin' Braves actually did lose 2-1 (almost 1-0). Maddening.   Fuck the Nationals, and SCREW the Braves for being so pathetic against them. STOP BEING THEIR DOORMATS!    So until tomorrow, guys?   GO BRAVES"

Braves,3b3f63,thekidfromyesterday,-1,Fri Jun 26 01:01:03 2015 UTC,I don't know. Please don't get me wrong. I love Tehran. I'm just worried we aren't going to franchise him and lose on him if he doesn't return to form. And I miss Evan Gattis I don't care what yall say.
Braves,3b3f63,gobraves101905,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:44:46 2015 UTC,He was in 2014. Not everyone is an elite ace and Miller likely regresses like Teheran did in 2014 in the second half.
Braves,3b3f63,Muddywaters22,-1,Thu Jun 25 17:42:26 2015 UTC,"I think the idea should be at least explored honestly. Teheran isn't exactly a franchise player and is kind of overvalued by other teams. I mean with the pitching depth it is an option. We won't get offered it, but I think everyone on /r/braves would be thrilled if we got a package of: Henry Owens, Devers, Margot and another lower level prospect."
Braves,3b3f63,PickShark,-6,Thu Jun 25 18:55:14 2015 UTC,Return would be huge. He is an elite pitcher on one of the best contracts in baseball.

Instead of Hanley I went for Adrian Gonzalez,  Juan Uribe, Freddy Garcia, and a couple of their bullpen guys for Cahill, Callaspo, EY, and Wang.  Stuck Gonzo in left for a .950 FPCT but he was the team MVP.  Finished 97-65, won the division... and first round exit in the playoffs so you know it's accurate."

I then flipped Hanley for Adrian Gonzalez and then immediatley traded Gonzalez, Maybin, Pereza,and Wes Parsons to the Indians for Brantley and Kluber and like 6 million in cash. It sucked giving up Pereza but both of them have really good contracts which I put a lot of value in.   I ended up making the playoffs as the wildcard but eventually got bounced by the Dodgers in the NLCS."

The eye rating was one of the main reasons I traded him, when he was first called up it was 8 but had 14 potential, and it never improved. I  really wanted to have him and Mallex Smith 1 and 2 in the order but his low OBP made it pretty impossible to do that."

I can't even wear my Atlanta hat to beer league softball without getting an earful from some hipster who's been a Nats fan for about 5 minutes.   What, you've had two good seasons so that gives you the right to be legitimately hostile to opposing team's fans?

The only jerseys I have came from the clubhouse store because it was the only place I could find the ones I wanted at the time I bought them (CNN center club house store has some good deals during off season).

Braves,3av4mr,aaronaroma,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:08:37 2015 UTC,Would they be ruled unearned runs on review? Or does it have to be caused by errors to be unearned?
Braves,3av4mr,jknox94,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:00:34 2015 UTC,"One of them should be unless the error was reversed, but the others are earned. They hit a good pitching staff in the last series hard, so if the starters can hold it to 2 or 3 we should be happy about that. Now the bullpen is another question. edit: and the error was reversed. But anyway, I do not expect any great pitching performances in this series. Gonna have to win it with offense and the offense seems to be dead at the moment."
