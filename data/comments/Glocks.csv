Glocks,3e3cer,22lrHoarder,3,Tue Jul 21 17:16:07 2015 UTC,About a month ago I picked up my first glock in a long time and that was a 2004 Gen 3 G19 FDE and today I've added another 19 to my stable. I scored a like new >1000 rounds G19 Gen 3 TB for $475. The $475 included a spare 19 non-threaded barrel and some weird Grip force adaptors that I'll probably never use. Overall for the price and what I got I feel I made out fairly well. I may just sell the spare barrel in the future to be into the gun even less.

Glocks,3e2fq6,adamlcarp,8,Tue Jul 21 13:14:05 2015 UTC,Glock uses meprolight vials. My understanding is that pretty much everyone is using meprolight or trijicon vials anyway.

I have a relatively new p226 with night sights, and recently installed new (from the glock online store) glock night sights, and both seem almost identical in brightness.  My p220, however, was made quite a bit before I bought it (I later found out it was almost 8 years old by the time I purchased it! But I got a smoking deal) , and its night sights are a bit dimmer."

They're a quality sight but not the best out there. Well worth the $65 or less shipped cost. Also ask them to safety inspect it if it's used and they'll replace anything else that needs it free.

Glocks,3e2fq6,Smackover,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:28:50 2015 UTC,"What did Glock say the turn around would be? I have a few pairs of Trijicon HD's on my pistols. The rear U shape and bright front sight are fantastic. Amazon sells them for $122 and some change usually.  If you don't want to be without your carry piece, I just used a vice, dowel rod and an armorer's hammer to install, (a normal hammer would do fine). It's not difficult to do."
Glocks,3e2fq6,Braybeurn,3,Tue Jul 21 15:36:40 2015 UTC,"This is also a good way to break the vials if you're not experienced. Hammering on something containing glass takes a little know how. While he's right, take the warning that the press is better for anyone not willing to risk breaking a vial, and makes adjusting and centering easier. Otherwise, if you know what you're doing and don't plan on replacing a lot of sights, a hammer and punch works fine.   Also turn around is about a week when I sent mine in. 7 days from ship to receive from Florida earlier this year."
Glocks,3e2fq6,Smackover,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:58 2015 UTC,"Sights are actually pretty strong, while not impossible to break vials I've never came close. I do think using a punch has a lot easier chance to break them than a wooden dowel rod. To each their own, whatever you do just take your time and don't rush the job."
Glocks,3e2fq6,Braybeurn,3,Tue Jul 21 15:49:09 2015 UTC,"I've had a gunsmith refuse to do them because he didn't have a press, then had a buddy when I was getting started doing my own break 2 sets of rears. That's the only reason I offer that warning. But as you said, don't rush and it'll be fine."

An AK, my AR, or the M1897 are the most frequently used, though.  Looking forward to the AKMS since it's a bit more flexible than the others and surface rust isn't going to bother me with it if it starts building up before heading back inside for the evening."

Glocks,3e3or1,Zerv14,2,Tue Jul 21 23:02:05 2015 UTC,I disabled the retaining button in a fashion that it retains the gun but if you pull on it with any authority it snaps out the holster. So I don't actually have to depress the button. I modified it today so it is canted towards the driver more for even easier drawing. I can draw and aim it in probably less than a second.

Glocks,3e41ta,chetoflep,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:08:06 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware the Mystic X was even rated for .45? I thought it topped out in the .30 cal range.  I have the .45 Osprey, and functionally it works great, and looks, in my opinion, perfect hanging off the end of a pistol. Especially the more ""blocky"" looking ones like Glocks and the HK USP line. Here it is on the 21.   Customer service is apparently solid with SilencerCo, although thankfully I've never needed it.   If I were to get another .45 can, I would probably lean towards the Octane. Shared pistons with the Osprey, and user-serviceable. User-service is really the only potential ""con"" I have with the Osprey."

I also have the 9mm piston for mine, and I'll get to try using it at some point in the hopefully not too distant future.  Never had a problem with the can, shooting it from my 1911. Not had a chance to shoot it in anything else yet, though."
Glocks,3e41ta,LambastingFrog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:57:21 2015 UTC,"Out of these two I vote mystic due to user serviceable and full auto rated. That was the difference in why I went with the octane 45 hd over the osprey. (and SiCo hadn't fixed the issues with people blowing the seals out of the first line of osprey cans, I do believe they fixed that now though) I like the look of the osprey on a blocky pistol like a Glock or USP but having the FA rating if I want to go HAM on a carbine build is nice to know it will take it."
Glocks,3e1622,766AP,3,Tue Jul 21 04:01:46 2015 UTC,"I've had 100% reliability on mine as it came with a few hundred rounds through it. Ate up defensive ammo and super cheap plinking ammo just fine.  I did swap in a Ghost EDGE connector and had a few malfunctions (both FTE+FTF) over a few hundred rounds... Maybe one malfunction per 50 rounds or so... but once I put the stock connector back in it worked fine again. I dunno what the deal with that is, I haven't heard of anyone else having problems when using the EDGE connector. Right now I'm just running the stock connector which has never failed me. I'm in contact with Ghost to try to figure it out. Would love to put the Ghost connector back in since the stock trigger pull is a bit heavy, much heavier than my 19 - but it is a very smooth and clean pull that's easy to be accurate with.  So besides the hiccups when swapping out the connector it is a really great little gun, very concealable, not as snappy as I expected (though noticeably snappier than my 19). The consensus I've read seems to be that Glock finally got one right from day 1. Would I sell a Shield to go buy the 43... probably not. If you like your Shield then there's no reason to switch unless you just gotta have a Glock in which case go for it."

I was one of those lucky few to pick up a 43 the first couple weeks they were available and got some of this. In my opinion it's got a much better texture than what the Talon grips use and is cheaper not to mention you get much more.   Take some card-stock or some thicker paper, and then make a template. Once you have the right size and measurements just cut and apply.   Here's the result on mine. It's way better than the pre-cut talon grips, not to mention cheaper.

Glocks,3dy5ir,btc5000,6,Mon Jul 20 14:21:43 2015 UTC,Mag compatibility is a nice plus. I have a 19 and 43 for winter/summer carry. Generally I feel like the 26 doesn't offer much over the 19.
Glocks,3dy5ir,silentsnake7,2,Mon Jul 20 14:29:43 2015 UTC,Same here. Had a 26 and it printed the same as the 19 with less rounds and a short annoying grip. Sold the 26 and went the 19/43 combo route.
Glocks,3dy5ir,GlockCock80,2,Mon Jul 20 23:03:19 2015 UTC,"Same here. Had the 19/26, then sold the 26. Its too big to carry in a pocket, so I had to carry it on my belt. Well, if I am doing that, I might as well carry the 19."

Glocks,3dy5ir,tomsayz,3,Mon Jul 20 14:42:44 2015 UTC,"I'd say yes. The two compliment each other well. G26 for summer, G19 for the rest of the year. As others have mentioned, mag compatibility is great."
Glocks,3dy5ir,ProfessorLube,2,Mon Jul 20 19:01:22 2015 UTC,"I bought a 26 about a year ago and have carried it for a few months. I wish I would have waited a bit longer since the 43 came out, or gotten the 19 since you can do more with it. Overall though, it was the best gun to buy at the time for me and I love shooting it, love it having it on me and I'd be surprised if another handgun would take it's place. I just want a 19 to play with and throw a laser or flashlight on there, just for fun."
Glocks,3dy5ir,Bogey_Kingston,2,Mon Jul 20 20:58:29 2015 UTC,"I think they are too similar to justify having both. Mag compatibility is overplayed, imo. I'm planning to get a 43 or Shield in addition to my 19."

Glocks,3du250,NaughtyEwokCave,2,Sun Jul 19 13:50:37 2015 UTC,Nice. Is that the stock mag on the 43?  How's it feel vs the full size?  I'm trying to get my hands on one but they're out of stock everywhere
Glocks,3du250,MrRobotos_weenis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:59:54 2015 UTC,The G43 comes with a flush mag and a mag with a pinky extension which is what I have on it. It definitely feels smaller than a full size or compact but I actually really like the feel and size of it and I have fairly large hands. The recoil is very manageable as well. Edit: I was also considering getting a M&P Shield but the 43 fit me much better.
Glocks,3du250,MrRobotos_weenis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:22:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks. The pinky grip is a big deal to me, and I have ""medium"" hands. Glad to hear it's a good fit"

Glocks,3du250,One_Life_Love,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:04:38 2015 UTC,I really like the 29. It's my winter carry and hunting side arm. The ammo is a bit on the spendy side but it's a blast to shoot but I have never tried shooting .40 out of it. I have a G22 so that's my go to .40 for the most part.

Glocks,3dupgj,DonnerPartyPicnic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:36:54 2015 UTC,499 for gen 3s pretty good. Most gun stores here in Florida glocks go for about 499 for gen 3s to give or take 30 bucks and about 50 more for gen 4s if I remember correctly. That's why when I seen ganders prices I was like holly shit.

The entire point of the round is that it doesn't over penetrate and expends all of its energy in your soft target. I didn't need the barrier penetration of critical duty.

Glocks,3drn5q,Wichitawesome,2,Sat Jul 18 21:12:51 2015 UTC,"First off, don't get the ghost connector.  It makes the trigger lighter, but longer and mushier.    You need to work on your trigger pull. Its 90% of pistol shooting.  Pull the trigger back until you hit the wall removing all pretravel.  When you hit that wall is when you are actually pulling the trigger. Pull it back slow and smooth.  Anything else will move your barrel a few millimeter  and throw your whole shot off. Also practice a 60/40 grip.  60% of the pressure with your support hand and 40 with your firing.  This will keep you from gripping too hard with your firing hand which will pull your shots."

In the long run they all wind up feeling the same. From Ghost, to Glocktriggers, to some triggers that are still being T&E'd. My suggestion would be some light polishing, maybe the (-) connector, and to shoot/dry fire the piss out of it.    Unless you are a gamer, a lot of trigger... talk is way overblown.

Glocks,3doax2,Engelmacher,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:30:09 2015 UTC,"I have a 1911 so that would be awesome, but the problem is there are so many different styles and manufacturers now that having one design that will work well with the look of all or many of them is likely impossible  there is alot to consider when laying out the work as well such as how much material you leave around rails and internal mill work that needs to bee there so it is very difficult to say honestly  Glocks are very easy to do this kind of work on because of how simple the slide is and how much material there is to work with, especially in the barrel area   this is not my only G17 design either, I have a couple other solid designs and one in particular that I am likely going to be doing in the near future that really excites me.   Like I say in the imgur album, I am simply waiting to get my hands on some other glock models so I can accurately reverse engineer the slides so that I have a good model to work off of and know what I can and cannot get away with in terms of design."

Glocks,3dqvgd,rainy0days,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:08:47 2015 UTC,"What's your thoughts on this?   I'm having mixed feelings. I like the idea of any added safety while reholstering(especially since I carry AIWB), but I also believe that it shouldn't be a crutch or replacement for safe gun handling/training. I also don't like the idea of adding more moving parts, or a device that could potentially keep the gun from firing in a contact encounter.   However, it looks like a good design and fairly simple. Also LAV approved(for what that's worth).   Edit: Also instead of downvoting, if we could just keep this a neutral discussion. This device is a hot topic on forums and blogs right now, and I wanted to add Reddit in on the discussion.   Edit: After having done more research, SouthNarc(a.k.a. Craig Douglas) of Shivworks has tested a few prototypes in around 500 of his ECQC classes without a single malfunction attributed to the gadget. There goes my durability and hand to hand/contact concerns.   Final Edit: Lots of downvotes flying around without actual arguments to back them up. Sad that even Glock Talk is having a more open minded discussion about this than users here, and that's saying something. Reddit will be Reddit..."

If you are unable to holster your gun without shooting yourself you should not use a gun in the first place. If you find yourself unable to train holstering your gun without shooting yourself you sure as hell wont find yourself able to train pressing your backplate while holstering your gun.  Let alone the fact that you have to train to use this gadget even more than you have to train keeping your finger of the trigger.  This is one of the most unneccessary inventions and additions to a firearm, especially a Glock, ever.  I just tried to place my thumb on the backplate while holstering my weapon. Why on earth would I go to this shitty grip when I can put it in the holster without bothering about it?   Also think of the hundreds of millions of people that constantly holster their guns without shooting themselves. What are the benefits in making holstering your gun more complicated?  Add to that that you introduce new moving parts that can fail. Why would anyone get this?   Some people really do not understand what makes a gun safe, let alone safer to use.

Some people in there are sounding like they are unable to use their glocks without one, others claim special operation guys are using this,   The basic question is still unanswered. Who needs it? It forces you to train to holser your gun differently. Why not train to holster your gun safely instead? Its like creating a solution that artificially creates a problem that wasnt a problem before.   The 2 guys that shot themselves with their AIWB holsters are frequently coming up and I cant figure out what that has to do with anything. These guys would have shot themselves with the gadget too. They pulled the trigger. Someone that cant keep his finger off the trigger is sure as hell not going to press a button on the backplate of his gun to deactivate the trigger instead of just getting his finger off the trigger.   Again, it is completely unneccessary and I am stunned that there are so many people who ""need"" this. They should just get guns with external safeties I guess."

Also for what it's worth, I personally reholster this way anyway when carrying appendix. My holster/gun sits too close to my body for me to comfortably fit my thumb around the grip. I have my thumb up on the back, and sweep it down like you would a 1911 safety when drawing. Also, thumbing external hammers in this exact motion when reholstering is something that's been taught for ages.   No one needs this.

An extra round, on the other hand, significantly increases your odds of stopping the threat. If you have to choose between capacity and power, always go with capacity.

So, if you're going for high capacity and ease of shooting while still shooting an effective round then 9mm is the best option. If you would rather have more power and mass with lower capacity, .45. With .40 you have a slight edge on 9mm for power but a slight drop in capacity. If you shoot that well, go nuts.

Glocks,3dnaqj,glocks,5,Fri Jul 17 18:57:43 2015 UTC,"I have owned more than 100 handguns in the last 10 years. I went through a stage where I would get rid of a gun if it experienced a malfunction. This was kind of dumb, but I did it. I accumulated several glocks during this time.   My g19 has north of 10k rounds though it without a malfunction.  I kept them and continued to shoot them, and enjoyed pretty much everything about them. The variety paired with the similarity was great too. I could have a subcompact 9mm with the exact same ergos/controls/manual or arms as a full size 10mm or 45.   They are beautifully simple. Detail strip a Sig. Then detail strip a Glock. The sig is like a fucking watch. The glock is like playing legos."

Glocks,3dnaqj,Soulfader72,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:10 2015 UTC,"The reliability. The gun has an outstanding track record, a proven design and even in the case something brakes you can get a original replacement part for 9€ or less. Compare that to any other firearm out there. Almost no one has H&K spare parts lying around, let alone for low prices. The aftermarket support. I can get a variety of holsters that suit my needs perfectly. Get a newer gun or some unicorn piece and you wont have any luck with that. Same goes for sights, springs, triggers, etc. If I want anything switched on my glock I can choose from a billion options, from low priced to almost the price of the gun for a single trigger. The design. Its minimalistic, you cant do anything wrong unless you really try. There is no depressing the slide lock when firing the last round because it is so small. There is no external safety that interferes with your grip, doesnt allow you to shoot etc. The slide serrations are perfect, the bore sits very low, there is nothing on the slide that catches on to your clothing, plain and simple.  I have to admit though, that for a long time I craved front slide serrations because they helped if you release the slide in a certain way. After shooting 50 rounds through the VP9 and touching the front of the slide I realized why this is a bad idea and bad design. You burn your hand. Never wanted them ever since.  I also like how the Glock has evolved over time. The additions have improved the gun without interfering with its core concept. The new MOS illustrates this perfectly. From gen 1 to this and it still fits the same holster. Also the compatibility of a lot of parts. Price. The gun is cheap enough that I do not care excessively about it. I do not treat it like a diva, I work it hard like a hammer yet it has not failed me. Ammo. I have put the worst shit in my glock and it still fired it just fine. Magazines. This deserves its own category. I currently have 14 magazines for my glock. If I wanted the same for an H&K were the prices here in Europe are 60€ a piece, I would have paid 840€ in magazines alone. I got mine over time when I could get them cheap. Paid about 15€ for each 17 rounder, 18€ for every 19 rounder and about 35€ for the two 33 rounders I have. A joke compared to the ridiculous prices of Sig or H&K mags."

Glocks,3dkeyh,JakesGunReviews,6,Fri Jul 17 00:26:55 2015 UTC,"No Jake, that's a Glock 29. You of all people should know this."
Glocks,3dkeyh,JakesGunReviews,3,Fri Jul 17 00:37:12 2015 UTC,"Is there any reason the G26 doesn't retain a frame rail like some of the other, larger-caliber sub-compacts I've seen?"
Glocks,3dkeyh,JakesGunReviews,2,Fri Jul 17 00:38:06 2015 UTC,"Glock's rail wouldn't fit on a G26 because that area of the frame is too short for the single notch style of rail that Glock uses. The G29 and G30, on the other hand, are considered subcompacts but in terms of slide length they're really more like compacts. The G29 and G19 have essentially the same slide length so the single notch on the Glock rail fits on their frames but wouldn't fit on the frame of the G26, which is a tad too short in that area.  But I've seen at least one person carve a rail onto a G26 frame, so it is do-able (but it wouldn't fit universal-rail only type units)."
Glocks,3dkeyh,JakesGunReviews,2,Fri Jul 17 00:45:17 2015 UTC,"I will have to check measurements, then.  Perhaps a G19 is what I've been after and I just didn't know it.  EDIT:  1cm difference in length?  Yeah, looks like I'm getting a G19."
Glocks,3dkeyh,ChrisKilo,2,Fri Jul 17 00:47:24 2015 UTC,You could also do a G19/G26 hybrid by taking a G19 and cutting the grip down to accept G26 mags if you really want to get that G26 style of gun with a rail.
Glocks,3dkeyh,thenatureboy_,3,Fri Jul 17 00:49:39 2015 UTC,It's tempting.
Glocks,3dkeyh,JakesGunReviews,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:52:55 2015 UTC,I've done those cut downs on a few Glocks. It's a pretty easy process as long as you go slow and pay attention. My G17 is cut down to flush fit G19 mags as well as an undercut trigger guard to bring my hand up closer to the bore and it's MUCH more comfortable to shoot that way.
Glocks,3dkeyh,AsteroidsOnSteroids,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:21:50 2015 UTC,"I think they do it to try to appeal more for CCW. I think they should sacrifice that small size difference and put one on there. I would buy one if they did.   I am considering the 30S because of this as well as wanting some more mmph to partner with my 19.   This makes me a little hesitant though, as I would not want my HD gun to have less stopping power then my CCW. I am currently torn as you can see.   My 19 is doing just fine for me right now."

Been looking at the 30SF since .45ACP is inherently subsonic, but would really prefer a 9x19mm since that's what all our other planned Glock purchases will be.

The less distance the trigger moves after the firing pin is dropped, the shorter the perceived reset.  The more advanced way is to reshape the trigger bar nose geometry and reshape the firing pin safety nub. Your will also have to modify the trigger safety lever so that it still engages the frame with the new trigger position. I don't suggest you do that without an in depth understanding of how the internals work and how they work in relation to eachother."

Glocks,3davjb,Engelmacher,3,Tue Jul 14 21:49:36 2015 UTC,"The new grip texture isn't spectacular, IMO. Better than gen 3 marginally, but still pretty awful.  The dual spring system is negligible at best. You won't notice a difference and a lot of people retrofit single spring stainless guide rods back into them.  The biggest benefit is the ambidextrous mag release flexibility if you are a lefty. If you aren't a lefty, there are BETTER aftermarket solutions.  The second pro, is the removable backstraps. This is the biggest pro to me. But you can do nicer grip reductions on gen3s and once you settle on a backstrap, it'll probably never be swapped after that.  TL;DR gen 4s are cool, but you really aren't missing out on much."

Spent plenty of time with both, and I can assure you, the gen 3 is an equally serviceable pistol in every way. The double spring might help a tiny bit with recoil in the .40 or .45, but in a 9mm? No advantage. As for the grip? I don't notice a damn thing after the first three rounds. Like you said... Latest and greatest? Sure. I'll bite. I bought a gen4 last year. But if it had been out of stock or whatever, and they had a gen3, I wouldn't even have bothered to drive to another shop to get a 4, I would have bought a 3 and been happy as a clam.

Glocks,3davjb,Baykey123,0,Tue Jul 14 23:53:09 2015 UTC,"The ""safe gun roster"" is the reason Gen 4s and any other recent handguns are not legal for retail purchase. The roster dictates draconian requirements such as mag release safeties (trigger cannot actuate if there is no magazine loaded), loaded chamber indicators, drop safety tests, etc. Gen 3s and other models are only approved because they predate the requirements and the manufacturers are still paying the fees to keep the firearms on the ""safe roster"" list.  TL;DR : Kalifornia has a list of approved handguns. Old ones are cool. Most new ones are not, if they haven't designed stupid features into the guns as a ""California-Approved"" model.

If you want to carry a full-size pistol you can, its a matter of getting the right holster, belt and clothing.  If you shoot the g19 just as good as the g17 go ahead and get the smaller gun, it will be slightly easier to conceal."

Perhaps a suppressor has peaked your interested or maybe a different part you considered for your current 19 but not sure entirely. This would also tie into the range pistol clause.  Set one up for homedefense, light, laser, low vis sights, etc, and one for CCW.  Just some ideas.  Beware of that 30sf if you carry concealed.

Not really enough difference to sway a decision in purchase, that would be 9mm or .45, but it is enough that it makes it convenient to have a gun that will cater better to your plans for that day"
Glocks,3d5zk0,myfaceit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:37:57 2015 UTC,"I had a Pachmayr grip on it, and that helped a lot with the width on the 19, but in the end, I don't really like modifying my carry gun too much, save for the custom slide plates I have.   I will say this: 16 rounds of 9mm is WAY lighter than 11 rounds of .45. Which is why eventually I'm going to look at a Gen4 19 again someday. Incidentally, I have a friend looking to trade me a Shield for another gun I've got, which fits my hand pretty well, despite how thin it is, because it's got a really pronounced palm swell."
Glocks,3d5zk0,60GritBeard,2,Tue Jul 14 14:00:46 2015 UTC,yea and 9mm right now is really cheap to shoot and practice with. My primary reason for carrying 9mm originally.  Ive always liked the 45 and as long as I can afford to keep up with and be proficient with both I will. If it comes to it and I can only afford to practice with one I will likely stick with 9mm and leave the 45 for home defense

They can be found here:  http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/56300000311.HTML  You'll have to browse around the Section 563 pages since it covers various areas of justification of use of force (both deadly and non-deadly).  What kind of training are you looking for, by the way, as far as practical application goes?  Might also try a post on /r/ccw as there may be some instructors in your area that post there."
Glocks,3d6e9m,JakesGunReviews,2,Mon Jul 13 22:00:03 2015 UTC,Didn't even check for a CCW reddit. Good thinking. The training I'm  looking for is personal safety and to get a liscense to carry. Would also like education on law aspects that go along with the license and responsibility. States that share our allow concealed carry etc.
Glocks,3d6e9m,JakesGunReviews,3,Mon Jul 13 22:18:52 2015 UTC,"That will all be covered by your CCW course (completed mine this past weekend).  The Missouri Attorney Generals' website will also show this information:  https://ago.mo.gov/divisions/public-safety/concealed-carry-reciprocity  Personal safety isn't too difficult:  just make sure your finger is off the trigger until you're ready to fire and don't point your gun at anything you wouldn't want to see shot (treat it as if it is always loaded).  That'll cover you for the majority of everything as far as safety goes.  When you actually shoot the gun, make sure of your target and try to know what's behind it since a bullet will likely penetrate through your target.  Practice your drawing/holstering a lot with an unloaded gun at home.  You don't want to be fumbling if you ever need to use it, so try to become proficient with drawing, aiming, and reholstering before actually carrying.    The TL;DR: of Missouri's laws for self-defense as far as the use of a firearm goes are basically that you are only justified in using your firearm if you feel your life is in such great danger that your use of lethal force is the only way you can stop whatever/whoever it is that is threatening your life.  Your CCW course will also tell you what establishments you can and cannot carry a firearm in.  About the only ""advanced"" training I can recommend for CCW is learning how to use a flashlight properly."

It won't headspace correctly but every other dimension is the same and the pressure is less than or equal to the 10mm SAAMI spec.  The extractor holding it is what allows the firing pin to properly strike the primer correctly...and due to that you may experience premature extractor wear.  Otherwise it is perfectly safe.

Glocks,3cxvv2,cthompson07,2,Sat Jul 11 21:10:22 2015 UTC,Spend $60 for a two year membership.  Receive coupon within 2 weeks.  Locate a blue label dealer and purchase a glock for $170 cheaper than MSRP.  Receive another coupon one year later.  It's easily worth doing. Especially if you want more than one Glock.
Glocks,3cxvv2,N0VQV,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:56:09 2015 UTC,"Some stores are ""Blue Label"" retailers. This means they are eligible to sell ""Blue Label"" Glocks which are typically intended for sale to military, police, and other emergency service workers. If you sign up for at least a 2 year membership with the GSSF, they will send you a coupon in the welcome package that allows one to be eligible to purchase a ""Blue Label"" Glock, even if you don't otherwise qualify (you must still be legally capable of purchasing and owning the firearm, of course). The welcome package took about 10 days for me last summer. A two year membership costs $60 IIRC, and BL Glock 19s generally run somewhere from $398-$425. Don't pay more than $425 for a BL Glock 19. You may have to call around to different BL qualified dealers to see their BL prices. Glock sets the BL pricing yearly, but I've found that many dealers ignore Glock's suggestions."

Glocks,3cxhfv,BZJGTO,2,Sat Jul 11 17:46:36 2015 UTC,"This is exactly right.   If it is only to plink cheaply at the rage there is no need for the extractor, ejector, or the RSA."

If I did change everything except the recoiled spring what issues would arise to know its a recoiled spring issue? I assume it wouldn't fully cycle or possibly not lock back on last round? Thanks for your reply I didn't even think of the ejector!"
Glocks,3cxhfv,BZJGTO,2,Sat Jul 11 18:02:49 2015 UTC,"I've just heard fewer complaints about other brand of barrels, such as KKM or Storm Lake (I have a SL barrel in my 17), but I don't know if other companies offer all the conversion barrels LWD does.  And really, while I've heard more complaints about LWD, it's not a significant amount, and could even be skewed by number of LWD barrels out there vs other brand barrels since the LWD is so much cheaper, and have so many options.  For the extractor/exjector, OEM is fine.  If you decide to replace the recoil spring (which you may very likely not need to), OEM is fine, or if you were looking to upgrade to an aftermarket metal guide rod, here's your excuse to do so (on that note, I've heard of several tungsten guide rods breaking, so you may want to stick to stainless steel, even though it's lighter."

Glocks,3cu7nq,cosmos7,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:33:51 2015 UTC,"True.  The 9mm ejector is point inward and I suppose it could stoke the primer on a .40 cartridge. We're talking about going the other way, though."

Glocks,3cu7nq,MyFishIsGold,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:12:00 2015 UTC,AFAIK the frame is the serialized part.
Glocks,3cu7nq,wolfgangmob,-1,Sat Jul 11 01:07:39 2015 UTC,It just seems funny that everything required to fire the gun you can procure without using an ffl. Sort of defeats the purpose. You could build the rest.
Glocks,3cu7nq,G19Gen3,2,Sat Jul 11 02:31:42 2015 UTC,Where does someone find a glock frame that doesn't go through an FFL? Pretty sure you need one of those to fire a glock.

Glocks,3crw88,estunum,2,Fri Jul 10 07:27:51 2015 UTC,"Just a suggestion - in newer versions of photoshop, you can make a selection and then right click with the selection tool and select ""make work path"".  Play with the tolerance until you get something close, then I usually modify the path by hand to get it perfect. I'm not sure how long that option has been in photoshop, so hopefully your version has it.  The alternative is /r/picrequests requests but this is a pretty big ontaking, so it might be hard to get them all done by someone for free.    Either one is worth trying I think, before you take on the vectorization in Illustrator.  Oh, and to answer the question you asked, I would rather have the #2 mat, but #1 is going to take a lot less time to vector out.  This one is kind of a happy medium I think. (though dated a bit but you could add the 43 in there)"
Glocks,3crw88,JLT303,2,Fri Jul 10 15:28:25 2015 UTC,"I do have that option. Using CC PhotoShop and Illustrator. Illustrator's most recent live trace is pretty good too, but doesn't do well on many straight lines so close to each other. Manually correcting some stuff would be necessary. For that reason, I rather trace it all myself. I'm very comfortable with Illustrator, as that's what I use to make a living, but at times use PhotoShop as well.  I can be very detail oriented and once a year or so I have to feed my perfectionism with some task that has a lot of detail or mundanely time consuming. It's often something impractical so taking on this diagram is perfect. I feed my demons and I get something useful that can be potentially useful for others. #2 is what I am leaning towards."

The yellow is slightly dimmer but it helps distinguish it from the front where the focus should be anyway.

Glocks,3cm9uh,776,2,Thu Jul 9 01:21:21 2015 UTC,A gentleman from tech Support told me they would be available today and I've been refreshing my page all day lol. I emailed him back asking what they could do for me since I wanted the +2 as well and to take advantage of the discount id need to order but unfortunately unavailable. He responded and gave me a coupon code for my next order. They are hands down an awesome company. 10/10 would've recommend on customer service alone.

Glocks,3cm9uh,cthompson07,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:40:37 2015 UTC,If you buy two at the same time you get $5 off of each I believe. But since the +2 weren't in stock and I could only get the +1 he offered me a 15% off my next order. Still less than the original discount but definitely better than nothing!

Glocks,3co52h,judsonm123,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:54:34 2015 UTC,The difference between the regular and MOS is the milled section for an optic right?  It's not like it will go flying out of the dove tail or anything.  Unless the front and rear are made for two different heights there shouldn't be an issue beyond personal preference.
Glocks,3co52h,fuckthepolis2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:43:51 2015 UTC,"And that's my one problem with the MOS Glocks. The sights are fine, they just hang off the back a bit. I don't imagine it will be a problem for competition unless it is now just ever so slightly too big for the box (depending on what you shoot) but the grip probably sticks out farther."

Glocks,3cmm8t,TameableExpertv2,2,Thu Jul 9 14:38:51 2015 UTC,"I work at Lone Wolf, just to make that clear from the start.   Building a Pistol can be quite a bit of fun, I happen to be working on one of mine today.   Glocks are pretty simple in terms of assembly and maintenance. There are 35 parts in the Glock assembly, the pistol can be field stripped by any person in a matter of seconds, and required lubrication is minimal.  I've assembled quite a few guns for myself, and helped family and friends pick out and put together their pistols. Assembly is not difficult. However, depending on the brands you decide to use, you may need to make adjustments to get everything running correctly.  Do you know what caliber and frame size you want? Also, is this a competition gun, concealed carry, or just a plinking / collection gun?  If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask or PM me. If I don't know, I can always talk with our Armorer."
Glocks,3cmm8t,TameableExpertv2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:34:39 2015 UTC,I was thinking about building a glock 19 or something compact in 9mm. Something I can ccw if I want and still have fun plinking at the range.
Glocks,3cmm8t,Mr_Green26,2,Thu Jul 9 22:42:53 2015 UTC,"A 19 would be an excellent choice!  I like to build the gun up using the larger option for the frame, and then use a conversion barrel when I want to use the smaller caliber. That leaves me with the most flexibility when it comes to ammunition selection."

My only real complaint about an M&P is that the trigger doesn't stay reward when the gun is struck out. That's a pretty minor complaint.   Edit: that trigger job is like over $200 in parts and labor and involves switching to a flat face trigger, but OMG is it worth it.

Past that, im cool with going to M&P's. Im gonna have to look into a more obvious trigger reset than current on the M&P"
Glocks,3cpsgy,mutant90,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:01:17 2015 UTC,CZ-75 stock triggers aren't great until they get at least a minor trigger job but you can tune their single action to be amazing compared to a DAO striker fired gun.

I had an M&P 9 full size, but ended up selling it pretty quickly because the grip never felt right in my hand. I think it was because the beavertail was roomier than most other pistols I've owned. But the way they handled the recoil was definitely something I wish my other guns could do. I just bought a PX4 in 9mm and it's close to the felt recoil of the M&P.   If they had an M&P version between their subcompact and full size that would be something I'd look at."

Glocks,3cpsgy,421dave,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:38:28 2015 UTC,I thought that was their model that can be compared to the Glock 26. I'm not into the S&W's version because it needs a mag extension to have a full grip. I prefer a real full grip like the Glock 19 has.

Glocks,3cil7e,RerunMN,2,Wed Jul 8 05:45:01 2015 UTC,"The Zev trigger looks nice. And price aside, is nice, for a drop in part. But I feel that it still can be improved. I did a few tweaks and tunes to the trigger bar, more than your run of the mill ""$.25 cent trigger job"" such as, thinned out the trigger nose to reduce friction between the connector and frame, squared off and flattened all surfaces with a ceramic file, including the ""wings"" that set in the trigger housing slots, bent the tab that trigger spring connects through closer towards the front and re-drilled the trigger spring hole higher for a lower and closer to horizontal pull against the connector angle etc. I also re-ground and changed the trigger bar sear geometry to get it closer to parallel with the striker lug.  A lot of this you can do with an OEM trigger and some free time. You can drill and tap your trigger housing and add set screws to adjust pre and over travel and the zev trigger doesn't REALLY do much more than that. But the wider trigger safety and less round profile of the trigger feels nice and has a nice aesthetic over all."

Glocks,3cil7e,db__,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:52:14 2015 UTC,"My take and personal experience on the subject is:  Recoil is recoil. your gun will have the same recoil energy regardless, but your spring weight will dictate how your gun reacts.  Light springs will be snappier, be a bit more sluggish when returning to battery, but the muzzle will dip less as the slide slams forward.  Heavier springs will be less snappy, but transfer more recoil into your hands, but return to battery faster allowing for faster sight acquisition IF you shoot that way.  To me, you either track your sights through recoil, or you just lose your front sight and reacquire it. How you deal with your sight picture semi dictates what recoil spring weight will be most efficient for you. I used to run 13lbs springs with 147gr 9mm bullets, now I'm using 1lbs springs with 124gr bullets. After a year or so of a 13lbs spring, it almost felt like I was waiting for my slide to return before I could pull off my follow up shots."

Glocks,3cil7e,oGKevin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:53:59 2015 UTC,"I just bought my first glock so I have a few questions.  Any particular reason you went with the G35 over the G34? Is there a .45 equivilent to the G34 and G35? Also, what hearing protection are you using in that picture?   Thanks - Beautiful gun, great inspiration for my next one"
Glocks,3cjuxp,sonusfaber,2,Wed Jul 8 14:00:02 2015 UTC,"Most shooters typically want a lighter spring weight in pistols to counter the dip when the gun goes back into battery. The lighter spring also makes it cycle faster, which combined with the reduced dip gives the perception of a flatter shooting gun. Of course this is when used with underpowered loads, which are going to be reducing the overall amount of rise as well.   The best way to choose a spring weight is to buy a bunch of them, and just see what cycles and what feels good to you. Different shooters have different preferences."
Glocks,3cjuxp,rainy0days,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:16:30 2015 UTC,"I think, based on all the other readings, is that getting a few springs is the best way. I already have an order on the way from Lone Wolf for a guide rod and 15# spring. The less captive springs may have been a better idea for fitting, but I'll still be able to keep going on this.   I read Bob Vogel uses a 15# with two coils cut off. Of course this is on a G34 and not a 17."
Glocks,3cjuxp,judsonm123,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:51:46 2015 UTC,Yeah. I had to go 14# on one if my 34s to get reliable functioning.
Glocks,3cjuxp,Engelmacher,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:09:08 2015 UTC,I really like the ISMI flat recoil springs. You can always go a few sizes up and cut them down since the spring weight is based solely on length/coil count and not wire gauge.
Glocks,3cjuxp,Engelmacher,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:00:32 2015 UTC,"While I agree with most of the points you made, I think lighter springs make the slide travel slower, cummulatively.  The slide recoiling back is powered by burning powder and will be really fast regardless, but returning to battery is only powered by a single spring.  So the rearward travel time is almost identical, but the return time is vastly different, comparatively."
Glocks,3cjuxp,rainy0days,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:02:14 2015 UTC,"That may be true, I've never timed just the slide movement."
Glocks,3cjuxp,Engelmacher,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:35:06 2015 UTC,"Reposting my response to you from my thread:  My take and personal experience on the subject is: Recoil is recoil. your gun will have the same recoil energy regardless, but your spring weight will dictate how your gun reacts. Light springs will be snappier, be a bit more sluggish when returning to battery, but the muzzle will dip less as the slide slams forward. Heavier springs will be less snappy, but transfer more recoil into your hands, but return to battery faster allowing for faster sight acquisition IF you shoot that way. To me, you either track your sights through recoil, or you just lose your front sight and reacquire it.

Glocks,3cdfsc,pballer2oo7,0,Tue Jul 7 02:33:27 2015 UTC,Gen 3 is proven.  And the Gen 4 stippling prevents it from being carried against bare skin.  Not to mention the oversized mag release is prone to inadvertent actuation.

Glocks,3cdvi2,Strickland_FJ,0,Tue Jul 7 13:14:13 2015 UTC,"But what are you learning to manage the recoil of the .40 for? If it has no advantage over 9mm? Just more expensive, more recoil, and more wear on the gun. Seems useless to me. But that's just IMHO. I don't get it. But to each their own"
Glocks,3cdvi2,db__,4,Tue Jul 7 14:40:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe because he likes .40. Why are you 9mm types always talking about cost? Some people can afford to buy .40 and .45.  ""To each their own"" doesn't coincide with saying ""get a 9mm"" to everyone.  This 9mm OneTrueCaliber(tm) stuff is getting really old."
Glocks,3cdvi2,judsonm123,5,Tue Jul 7 15:15:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. 40 really is a powerful little round. That ""snap"" is from the power.   I've also seen it handloaded down to shoot at least as soft as 9mm."

Personally, the recoil doesn't bother me one bit. I was just saying .40 for woods walking because the standard 180grn flat nosed FMJs are good pig stoppers if one were to decide to charge. I would take 180 over 115 or 124 any day.   Sure, 9's might be easier on the wrist, but like I said the recoil doesn't bother me. And for about $5 more per box of 50 target rounds, the cost of ammo doesn't really bother me either.... All about personal preference I guess."

Glocks,3cdabn,SmellMyDildo,4,Tue Jul 7 00:40:37 2015 UTC,"The 34 is optimized for competition. Ruling out the longer sight radius, there are still some advantages. It does come with the 17 round magazines as opposed to the 15s. It has a decreased weight trigger at 3.5lbs vs the 5.5 standard that is on the 19. It also has a different shaped slide release. The longer barrel will increase velocity. This is helpful if you are trying to make a power factor and you can do so with less powder and lower reloading costs. The longer slide will generally exhibit less muzzle flip, allowing faster followup shots.   These also come with a trade off of a much longer slide and slightly longer grip along with increased weight. Not a big deal if you are looking for a gun that you will not be trying to conceal."

Glocks,3cdabn,Engelmacher,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:21:22 2015 UTC,"Most advantages are lost without the sight radius bonus. You can use 17 round mags in the 19 so that's a draw, the 19 is good for CC and OC whereas with the 34 most people are gonna be stuck with the latter. The only benefit I see to the 34 is that the trigger is slightly lighter."
Glocks,3cdabn,Engelmacher,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:51:18 2015 UTC,"I'd like to chime in with a slightly different opinion. Some people actually like to shoot a 17 or 19 in competition.  Sure, the 34 comes with some more performance based internals out of the box, but most can be swapped over into the 19 or you can find equivalent parts.  Anyways, you will have a lighter slide. Some people subscribe to the heaver bullets, fast powders and light recoil springs train of thought. That was me a few months ago. But now, I am sort of liking the lighter bullet weight, fast powder, and heavier recoil springs with lighter slides.  If you shoot by tracking your front sight up and down you might like the former option, but if you want a faster slide cyclic time, you would lean towards the latter. The faster your slide cycles, the faster it's back into battery, then it's up to you to make the fine adjustments in your sights to pull off your second shot.  With a shorter sight radius, your front sight will ""bounce"" more, and will be more sensitive to movement, but I personally think you can get the little post into the rear notch faster.  You will also have a lighter and more maneuverable gun, making target transitions faster. If you are using a normal wrap around type holster [as in, not a race holster] you will also clear your holster faster than trying to pull 5"" of barrel out.  Just something to think about. PS, I shoot a G35, but I don't use it for carry."

Glocks,3c89ax,shickabang,5,Sun Jul 5 23:23:26 2015 UTC,"I prepped the surface with rubbing alcohol (did this on my mags too).   Wait for it to dry.  Then I took the nail polish and liberally applied it even pushing it into the cracks with the nail brush.   Note: It doesn't hurt to try it first but putting less on. I knew I put just enough on when it dried a little bit and I could see where it sank in on the engraving.  Let it dry a little bit but not too much.  It sounds pretty vague but when you do it you'll know.  If the out side get's hard it's just harder to clean up.  So when you wipe it off use Non-acetone nail polish remover.  Some people say acetone is fine but YMMV.  Gently wipe off.  If you press too hard then it will get into the cracks and take out what you put in.  I found that doing it while it still a little wet and wiping off the majority around the engraving is easier than waiting for it to completely dry.  The biggest thing is that if you mess up, just wipe it off and reapply.  I think I did about 3 coats on each spot just because I messed up.  If you do it right, you can get away with one coat the first time.  I followed a youtube video to do it but you don't have to."

Glocks,3c4adf,hi12345654321,5,Sat Jul 4 17:52:26 2015 UTC,"Echoing the other commenter - get your dominant foot closer to your non dominant foot. Probably at the most 6 inches behind your left foot with a slightly wider than shoulder wide stance. Lean slightly forward.   Shooting low left or low is very common. Most likely for poor trigger control and anticipating the recoil by pushing the gun slightly forward with every shot. Try dry firing with an empty gun and practice pressing the trigger until it breaks while keeping your sights perfectly aligned. Focus on your front sight. That is key.   Front sight, press! Keep it up and have fun."

I kind of don't think that's anything to worry about.  My ejector number is 33214, though.  When did you pick yours up?  I've had mine since about a week after they were released.

The only time this should ever happen would be constantly re-chambering the same round and even then it should only happen with cheap bulk ammo and I would imagine it would take hundreds of cycles to happen. That damage doesn't LOOK bad enough to cause this but who knows, just in case it was a manufacturers defect, contact speer and you should probably be able to get a replacement box from them.  I always keep a round chambered but after I am done dry firing I pop out the top 4-5 rounds of my magazine and put the one that was chambered under the others to prevent this from happening."

Glocks,3bymij,Medic7816,3,Fri Jul 3 06:22:45 2015 UTC,"How many times has that round been chambered and ejected? Judging from the mark on the brass, something obviously impacted it. To be safe, swap out that magazine full of ammo for fresh and save it for your next range day. Shoot it at the range and see if it functions properly. Just ejecting the magazine shouldn't separate the bullet from the brass, unless you have done it an excessive number of times and handled it roughly."
Glocks,3bymij,Medic7816,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:56:07 2015 UTC,I haven't handled it roughly at all. My gun just sits on my nightstand and I play with it occasionally. The rounds have never been chambered. I was thinking maybe the dent is from when I took the rounds out to colorfill my mag. Loading the last round is really hard for me and maybe that dent is from the pressure of me putting the last round in on top of it?   I was hoping I didn't have to shoot this mag because the rounds cost about $1.25 each.
Glocks,3bymij,saintcazorla,3,Fri Jul 3 06:01:26 2015 UTC,"If you have not chambered that round, then all the other rounds in that magazine have been subjected to essentially the same force and I would not consider that magazine of ammunition acceptable for self defense.

These loops allow me to remove and replace the holster without undoing my pants/belt. I like the all leather as it is very comfortable. A good stiff belt keeps everything in place and provides excellent retention. I occasionally carry OWB for ooen carry and also use an all leather DeSantis holster. The open carry holster has a retention strap that snaps over the rear of the slide.

Glocks,3by0hp,saintcazorla,5,Fri Jul 3 02:39:01 2015 UTC,Use the pad of your finger when you pull the tigger. You might have been hooking your finger causing it to pull left. Common issue with most people who shoot left.
Glocks,3by0hp,Medic7816,2,Fri Jul 3 03:49:59 2015 UTC,"Yep, I've been fighting this issue myself. First couple shots are good, but once I try to get some quick rounds out find myself pulling the trigger with my knuckle practically and get a lot of low left hits."

And Glocks do have a unique grip angle that can take some getting used to. If you are used to a SA or DA/SA trigger, the striker fired will take some getting used to. I would focus on how much finger pad you are using and see if that helps. Congratulations on your inevitable Glock 19 purchase, they really are fantastic guns."

Glocks,3by0hp,DATSKOAL,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:17:52 2015 UTC,"try a different glock, or a different range. I'm not a big fan of the stock glock trigger, but can be substantially improved with a little polishing, a lot of use, or a ghost trigger for very minimal money. I got mine for $18 to well within my acceptable range. That said, I bet your issues are just unfamiliarity with the gun, or a crappy copy. While a glock may not be the most perfectly accurate or fanciest firearm out of the box, they're rock solid. it should be dependable, consistent, inexpensive, and incredibly easy to maintain. Both upgrade and maintenance parts are relatively cheap but are rarely needed.  Everyone should have at least one, even if it's not their favorite pistol.. It's probably the hardest to part with."

Glocks,3bwd10,BrenaDear,4,Thu Jul 2 18:16:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you need the G43.   The G42 shoots .380 (which is a shortened 9mm round, but I've never heard it called a short 9 in real life). The 380 rounds have lots of variation between MFG's, and as such almost all 380 pistols that I've seen have reliability problems. Those can be solved by finding the ""Right"" ammo for the gun, but it's just something to think about.  The G19 is going to handle a lot like the G17. It's just barely a bit shorter in both length and height (but equal in width), and holds 2 fewer rounds. They are very similar guns.   Have you thought about the G26? It's smaller than a G19, but larger than a G43. The advantage in shooting vs the G43 is that due to more mass, it has less felt recoil. Personally I shoot a G26 better than almost anything (which is odd considering it's small size).   Try the G26. Then decide if you wanna get that or if you prefer the slimmer, lighter, easier to conceal G43. Which one you get will depend on personal preference (usually determined by how large your hands are)."
Glocks,3bwd10,brzcory,2,Thu Jul 2 18:28:37 2015 UTC,"I have a 17 and a 26, I generally shoot better with my 26. I thought I was the only one...."
Glocks,3bwd10,goguppy,2,Thu Jul 16 02:55:51 2015 UTC,"Nope. My buddy has a 17c with a laser, and I shoot my 26 much better than I can shoot his gun.   It's an odd little thing."
Glocks,3bwd10,brzcory,5,Thu Jul 16 10:58:45 2015 UTC,"Upvote for the 26 in your situation. The  43 has less mass (easier to conceal) and therefore more recoil.  I have a 19,26, and 43. If I could only have one it'd be the 26. Good balance of size v shoot ability.  I like the way it feels in my hand better than the 19 (only slightly though)."
Glocks,3bwd10,fadelio,3,Thu Jul 2 19:05:48 2015 UTC,"Both good options.. I understand the dilemma.   If you're looking for a good range gun, something to conceal off-body in a bag or purse, something to learn with and hone the craft, nothing beats the 19.  I'd recommend finding a range that does rent one, making sure it fits your hand right before making any purchase.    If you're looking for a conceal carry option, the 42 it a viable option, but as a range gun, .380 can get pricey."

Glocks,3bwd10,frantzracing0,2,Fri Jul 3 21:20:13 2015 UTC,"Your accuracy will get better with practice. Personally, I believe your carry gun should be whatever caliber you shoot best. The 19,26,42, and 43 are all great options for conceal carry."
Glocks,3bwd10,SirBurningBeard,2,Thu Jul 2 20:12:39 2015 UTC,"If the 17 produced ""lots"" of perceived recoil, a 19 isn't going to be any better. Based on your objectives and described preferences, I think the 42 would be a wise choice."

Glocks,3bwd10,SonsOfLiberty86,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:26:49 2015 UTC,"I'd go with the 19 (or possible even the 26).  I'm just a huge fan of 9mm.  It's cheap, reliable, and proven."
Glocks,3bwd10,gizram84,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:30:43 2015 UTC,"If you want to carry the gun, think how you want to dress around it. For example, if you want to carry G17 in a light dress, you'll have to put shorts under it, and it must be a darker fabric and higher waistline. Not all girls are okay with that. The G42 is way lighter and it adds options thus. But in all other respects it's disadvantageous. So basically my suggestion would be to get the biggest gun you can carry. Your description of shooting leaves little to choose, so don't focus on that.  P.S. Heed other suggestions except P238. Wonderful gun, but the external safety is obsolete and will make you lose at the critical time, IMHO."

She likes the 42 because its smaller than the 43 and actually has a little less recoil too. I personally carry the 43 and 19 and love them both but mainly take out the 43 since its easier to conceal. My wife has her CCW and she is very small framed so she needs a small package she can conceal so she takes the 42.   My wife is damn good with the 42 as well. Just have to practice a lot.   I say go with the 42 or 43."
Glocks,3bwd10,ZaneMasterX,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:17:27 2015 UTC,"My wife has both a 19 and a 42. Inevitably, the 42 goes with her more. It is just easier for her to conceal. The 19 really only fit well in her purse or the diaper bag, and neither of us really liked the off body carry. The 42 just fits more places. It can go in the pocket of her hoodies, inside the waistband of her jeans, or in a flashbang bra holster. It's much easier for her to load than the double stack magazines as well. It is also confidence inspiring accurate.   The 26 sounds like a good compromise, but in my experience it isn't. It is too bulky for good pocket carry, and you are pretty much resigned to inside the waistband holsters and a good belt. If you are going to do that, you can carry a 19.   I don't have any experience with the new 43, and it seems like a good gun, but it is slightly bigger than the 42.   I always suggest that you go with the good gun that you will carry more than the great gun that you carry less because it is inconvenient. That extra 9 rounds of 9mm that the 19 carries does no good if it is in the safe because it didn't work with your outfit for the day. A .380 in the hand is infinitely better than the 9mm back home."

Don't get me wrong I love my glock, but it's more important to have a gun you can shoot, operate, and feel comfortable with than one that is good to look at. And I'm sure everyone will agree with me on that. I think glock and HK are the best handguns you can get. But find one you are really comfortable with.

For me personally, I'd rather have the G19 or preferably, the 30s over the 29 for concealed carry. But if you want a one gun solution, the 29 has a place."

Glocks,3btgjl,zaitcev,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:36:39 2015 UTC,"The consensus theory of The Internet Mind is that the frame is machined slightly incorrectly in the extractor slot area, which permits it to hold the case rim improperly, and then the position of the case affects how it ejects. The 30274 ejector, of course, cannot do anything to make your extractor seat well, but, since the direction of ejection is affected by the balance of extractor and ejector, it hopefuly moves where the case flies even with the extractor that you have.  I really don't have any good suggestions except continue playing with parts to find a good combination. I suppose one could replace the slide and move all the little components onto it, but that probably costs a fortune."

Glocks,3bsl6g,wckdwabbit,0,Wed Jul 1 20:46:09 2015 UTC,"The g17 is a bit longer in the grip and in the barrel.  Personally its not a huge deal to me.  I do like the longer sight radius of the g17 but when concealing the shorter grip is noticeable.  When you conceal I find its not the barrel that is hard to hide, its the grip that sticks out of your side and the shorter grip can make a difference.  Some people worry about printing when they carry and depending where in the country you are located that can be a big deal.  I live in FL and don't give a rats ass if I print when I'm out and about, I've come to the conclusion that most people won't ever notice the outline of a grip and most of those who know what to look for don't care.  When I do want to minimize printing (when I'm at work) I carry my g26.  Ultimately I suggest you try them both out.  And decide what's better for you.  I will mention a gun isn't any good if you don't have it with you when you need it.  Many people started carrying a gun and stopped because it was to big/heavy/inconvenient.  Smaller guns make these things less likely to be an issue.  I like and prefer my big service size handguns. They fit my hands, I shoot them well and unlike most people I actually like a bit of weight on my belt, its a reminder of what's there."

Glocks,3bsl6g,Clinic_2,2,Wed Jul 1 21:07:55 2015 UTC,"Heh.  I built an AR-15 earlier this year.  I started off cheap (PSA special and some blemished parts, so roughly $600-700) but it has slowly snowballed into a rather expensive toy.  My G19 followed that by about a month.    I went from zero guns at New Years to seven guns currently (2x shotguns were given to me by family, ditto 2x 22LR).  So I can definitely attest to the fact that guns bang in the closet while you sleep and multiply.  An AR15 is a fun toy to have.  You can also do some neat things with it other than just shoot paper at 50 yards at the range.  I am in the process of converting my cheap PSA special to a ""long range"" gun (600-800 yards is long range for an AR15).  If you don't want to do that, you can go with the short range/CQB monster and just revel in the loud noise.  Check out /r/AR15"

Fobus is good for that, and you can take your duty belt out of it with their drop-leg holster. I work similar and other contracts, and really think you should either carry in an inside-the-waistband (I like Bladetech Phantom for full-frame Glock) or train with and use retention holsters, from a standpoint of safety. Many professional minds have reiterated that deactivating the index retention lever on the Blackhawk SERPA line doesn't create any more risk of a negligent discharge than any other retention method when properly finger indexing. If a user doesn't keep their finger outside of the trigger guard through the draw and until on target (""and having made the conscious decision to fire""), they're risking a negligent discharge regardless of the holster's retention method. The SERPA's button is positioned over the gap between slide and receiver - the ""sweet spot"" for your index finger when you're ""looking for work."""
Glocks,3brbxe,velox_mortis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:39:26 2015 UTC,"I just got a Safariland 7377 for my Glock 19 and it is a fantastic holster. I really cannot imagine wearing anything besides a Safariland for open carry / duty / whatever.  Now, the one I got does use Safariland's ""ALS"" locking system, which does lock in the gun once you holster it. But it's very easy to unholster, there's a little lever you press with your thumb and it's extremely natural to move the lever as you're getting a good grip. I was at the range this past weekend and with about 5 minutes of practice I was going from not touching the gun to having it drawn in one smooth motion.  Safariland does make other holsters that use different locking systems, like the ""SLS"" which is pictured here. It still locks in, you have to press a little tab with your thumb to unlock it. It's similar to ALS but works a little different. You could also combine both ALS and SLS in one holster if you wanted. But unless you're often interacting with people who might want to grab your gun that's probably a bit much IMO.  There's also the difference between their ""concealment"" and ""duty"" holsters, which is basically that the duty holsters are way more expensive and sit out from your body a bit more and usually come with a hood guard to prevent other people from activating the SLS/ALS.  So here's a few options, all these fit the Glock 17:   Safariland 7377: $40 - Concealment with belt loop attachment Safariland 7378: $33 - Identical to 7377, but also includes a free paddle attachment, not sure why it's cheaper Safariland 7390: $95 - Duty version with hood guard and the UBL belt loop. Wouldn't recommend actually buying it as configured though, it would be cheaper to buy the 7378 and swap out the ""concealment"" belt loop with the $20 mid-ride ""duty"" belt loop, if you don't care about the hood guard, that is.   Let me know if you have any questions, I spent like the past week and a half doing OWB holster research so I have it all fresh in my mind. I own a Fobus holster for my Ruger SR22 and the Safariland blows it away in terms of quality and ease of draw. I also have an Alien Gear OWB (the Cloak Slide) for my Glock 19 which is a leather/kydex hybrid and it's pretty ok. Way better for actual concealment than the Safariland, but still doesn't come close in terms of ease of draw, retention, or quality."

Glocks,3bp3t1,goguppy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:26:08 2015 UTC,I had a fun stick for my G23; it didn't like to cycle properly and jammed up often so I sold it.

Glocks,3bp3t1,turkey_sandwiches,0,Wed Jul 1 06:28:12 2015 UTC,The 19 is just as concealable in most situations and holds three times the firepower.  43 is not the pocket-rocket it's touted.

I bought my 23 with no wear but after about 1500 rounds and no misfires, jams, etc. NO MALFUNCTIONS. I dont give a shit about a little wear on the barrel."
Glocks,3boiay,BabbMrBabb,4,Tue Jun 30 22:15:17 2015 UTC,I wouldn't sweat that at all.
Glocks,3boiay,Engelmacher,3,Wed Jul 1 00:35:21 2015 UTC,"I have a captive ""cartridge"" or ""dual"" spring like on Gen 4 too, and I shot way more than 200 rounds (more like 1200 now). I have exactly same wear on the barrel lug base, not nothing on the barrel. I think your spring sleeve is rubbing. That said, I can't tell if it is a problem. Maybe your natural clearance between sleeve and barrel is smaller.  Personally, I would not lose any sleep over this. Both barrel and the spring assembly are easily replaceable items. By the time you're through 1000 rounds, the cost of the spring is going to be well amortized, at current ammo prices, and it's going to be the time to swap the spring anyway."

You believe a spring should be replaced after 1,000 rounds? I must ask because I have 2,900 rounds through my G17, and almost 2,100 through my G19. Haven't replaced anything on either."
Glocks,3boiay,yetsev,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:00:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do at present, mostly from reading Grant Cunningham's book. However, this may change.  The Internet is full of vague advice. Reports exist of Glock customer service representatives recommending 3000 to 5000 round interval.  I went ahead and asked Mr. Massad Ayoob in the GATE. His answer was: ""Current Glock recommendation is to change the recoil spring every 5,000 rounds. They also recommend a yearly armorer's inspection."""
Glocks,3boiay,zaitcev,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:27:11 2015 UTC,"That works for me. I have read most of what I can get my hands on written by Ayoob (and I met him at the NRA show in Indy last year).

Sweet!  I've been thinking I'd prefer a .40 but so many people say you should have a 9mm instead for USPSA etc. ... best of both worlds?

Glocks,3bmese,6NippleCharlie,2,Tue Jun 30 18:47:38 2015 UTC,Just to clear it up a little further it is the 9mm slide that wont accept a .40s&w barrel as the diameter for the .40 barrel is larger than the hole in the front of the 9mm slide. The only difference between the frames would be the ejector which is easily swapped out of course.
Glocks,3bmese,Glockz0r,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:57:24 2015 UTC,The frames are identical between 9mm/.40/.357SIG of the same size.  I.e. G19/23/32 are all the same dimensions.   You cannot put a .40S&W G23 barrel in the slide of a G19.  The opening is too small.  So you need a new slide.   We'll if you need a new slide you have to swap the parts from your other slide to the new slide every time you want to shoot the other caliber.  Enter this complete slide and barrel from the Glock Store.

Glocks,3bjoey,edb_ok,5,Mon Jun 29 22:13:47 2015 UTC,"I have both and carry both often. IMO the 26 operates much like it's bigger brother 19. With a 19 mag in it and a xGrip it feels just like the 19 - actually a little better because the contour of the palm swell. The 19 is very concealable but the 26 is even more so, so you WILL have more concealment options. If you want to run some IDPA matches as well then the 19 is the all around better option.   Edit: An example situation where the 26 is more concealable is deep concealment in khaki dress pants with something like a smart carry or belly band. I can do it with the 26 but the 19 prints too much and is too uncomfortable by comparison.  Appendix carry is a little mor comfortable with the shorter 26.  Regular 3:00 carry in a hybrid holster there is little difference between the two.  Whichever you get I highly recommend investing in upgrading to night sights."

Glocks,3bjoey,fadelio,3,Thu Jul 2 07:58:58 2015 UTC,"My 2c.  Get the 43.  It's an excellent little gun, unless of-course you're overly concerned about round capacity in a multiple assailant situation.  Everyone wants to rag on the 43 because Glock was late to the game with a single stack 9, but give it some time and I believe we'll find that the 43 becomes one of the most popular CCW guns.  The 26 feels huge to me now compared to the 43.  I honestly find myself snatching up the 42 (380) more so then even the 43.  It's smaller yet, quite comfortable and in a sticky holster I can stick it anywhere (pocket, 4 o'clock', 1, etc)...and I barely even acknowledge it's there.    I won't get rid of the 26, but it's pretty much going to be a bedside gun / under the counter gun at work.  It's significantly thicker then the other 2 in my smaller hands.  Not that that 26 doesn't feel comfortable.. just like the others better now.  All that said, the 19 is a great gun.  It's a bit larger though in comparison to the others in my opinion.  I can't fathom carrying it after owning the others, but I'm a smaller dude with slimmer fitting shirts."

Glocks,3bjoey,LosCruzados,2,Mon Jun 29 21:54:17 2015 UTC,"Get the 19. It's an excellent all round weapon. Buy a purpose made gun belt and a decent hybrid kydex/leather holster and the weapon is comfortable and easy to conceal. Worst case scenario, you decide that you can't or don't want to carry it, you will have no problem selling it and buying a 43 with what you get for a lightly used 19."
Glocks,3bjoey,Medic7816,2,Mon Jun 29 22:02:42 2015 UTC,"The G19 is just fine for CC and is great for target shooting. If you think that the G26 is a compromise, I'd say you are selling yourself short. I would suggest you rent them both and shoot them both. I am sure you will get comparable groupings w the two at realistic ranges and out to 50 yards depending on your experience.   I would suggest the G26 personally. I cc a G27 gen 3 just fine; I have very few issues cc'ing the G23 gen 4 I own as well as the G19 gen 4 I own. I am 5'11"" and 135lbs. You can absolutely do it."
Glocks,3bjoey,G27AndAnLCP,2,Mon Jun 29 23:19:18 2015 UTC,"I have a 19. The size difference is so small between a 26 and 19 that if you have a printing issue with one, it will inevitably be the same for the other.  There are a few things to consider.   Where the gun is located on your body. What holster you're using. What clothes you're wearing. Don't worry if you print a little. Nobody in public is actively looking for CCW holders."
Glocks,3bjoey,Glockzilla_,2,Mon Jun 29 23:49:04 2015 UTC,Another vote for the 19. I don't recommend it but I've actually pocket carried it. A good holster makes it very concealable. It's simply the best all around pistol you can get.
Glocks,3bjoey,salt_pepper,2,Tue Jun 30 00:57:57 2015 UTC,I just got the 19. I'm as skinny as they make them and I can conceal it fine. I don't know your body type....but yeah. You will like either one (19/26). Go hold them both. Then get the 19...then a year or three later get a 26 too.

Glocks,3bjoey,9mmIsBestMillimeter,2,Tue Jun 30 03:43:02 2015 UTC,I would say just go with the 19 as well.  I carry a 29 very regularly and have found that appendix carry works best for me.
Glocks,3bjoey,bmx13,2,Tue Jun 30 04:37:05 2015 UTC,"I ccw a g19 all the time under a T-shirt without issue. A 26 may be slightly easier, but I don't think it's significant."
Glocks,3bjoey,needlejuice,2,Tue Jun 30 12:15:40 2015 UTC,"They make more than one model because size vs. performance is a trade.   If I could only have one Glock, I would lean towards the 26 over the 19 because it's much more comfortable for me IWB. OWB, the 19 is probably better because if you've already gone OWB you've dressed to the gun or don't care about ""concealment"". So, if you plan to carry IWB, I'd put the carry requirement as the top want and let the other requirements take a back seat. That said, if you can live with the 19 IWB, that's the winner.   I have no experience with the 43, but I find my 26 MUCH more shootable than my Shield. I'm actually trading the Shield for a 42 tonight. To me, the Shield just wasn't fitting any role that the 26 couldn't. I'm hoping the 42 fits the rare occasions where printing at all is unacceptable. However, it may not and I may sell it. I have a P3AT (ruger didn't make a copy when I bought the KelTec), but I don't really have any confidence with it. If the 42 doesn't work for me, I may try the Bodyguard or LCP or I may give up on anything smaller than a 26.   Edit: If I was on a budget, I'd get a carry gun first (26, 42, or 43) and later add a 34.  I really enjoy the 34 at the range.   Edit 2: This is how my choices will go if the 42 works in the pocket:  Pocket : 42 IWB : 26 OWB carry : 19 Competition/fun : 34   I don't know where my 17 fits anymore. I would trade it but then I wouldn't have a 17 :) . The Shield (closest I've had to a 43) wasn't any better for me IWB because the extra width didn't ""cost"" as much as I gain from having a normal Glock 9 just chopped plus mag compatibility.   Edit 3: if the 42 doesn't work well in my pocket, P238/Mustang is next at bat."
Glocks,3bjoey,judsonm123,2,Wed Jul 1 20:00:02 2015 UTC,"Fire other handguns before settling on a Glock. If you want to stay with the stryker fired/safe action, look into the M&P series from Smith and Wesson and the XD series from Springfield. If I had done this, I wouldn't have gone Glock....would have gone M&P. Only thing I dont like about the M&P is the trigger reset isnt as audible compared to the Glock.

If you made me take out my sig sp2022, my first gun I thought I'd be conceal carrying as my perfect no compromise gun, I'd never take it out.

Glocks,3bjoey,greekplaya990,-1,Tue Jun 30 14:42:50 2015 UTC,"Have you considered chopping the grip on a g19 to accept g26 mags?  IMO, the hardest part to conceal is the grip length, so if you reduce that, you still get a lot of the benefits of a g19 but more flexible with varying options."
Glocks,3bjoey,Engelmacher,2,Mon Jun 29 20:41:38 2015 UTC,I cut my 17 down to a 19 to carry. It's easily doable and looks good imo.
Glocks,3bjoey,DirtD4er,0,Mon Jun 29 22:06:57 2015 UTC,"Get a glock 26 if it's going to keep you carrying. A glock 26 is everything the 19 is and more except for the rail, which I don't think you're going to put a flashlight on it to carry, they have options for the laser and flashlight with the 26 anyways. It also takes all the mags in the glock 9mm family. 10, 15, 17, 33,  so capacity is never an issue. So there you go. A glock 19 just half an inch shorter. I have been carrying mine for a while and it conceals good. I have never carried the 19 though, but looked at one and bought the 26 instead."
Glocks,3bjoey,dirty30blue,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:07:39 2015 UTC,"I say get the 19. The fact that the 26 will take all the mags is not a selling point for CC. Putting a 15 or 17 round mag in a 26 just makes the 26 more the size of a 19 or 17. If you're going to BE that size, get the 19. For my 2nd (additional) carry gun, I have a G42 I put in my weak side front pocket. I know, wish I'd waited for the G43, but I didn't. The G26 was just WAY too big for inside my pocket. Struggled to get it out. Would not have been good if I needed it in a hurry."
Glocks,3bjoey,yetsev,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:25:31 2015 UTC,"Well either way you can't really go wrong. The 19 is the best selling glock. I just figured he'd be more likely to carry the 26, and to point out that basically the 26 is just a 19 on more of the concealed side. I personally would have gotten a 19 but I already have a full size m&p 9 so I figured it would be pointless since I already have a high capacity 9mm. I do agree with you though. The 26 isn't a pocket gun, but I carry mine inside the waste."

Was skeptical at 1st too, but it stays put!  Very comfortable and simple.  Other clip holsters.. they dig in too much... not comfortable at all for me.  They hurt and seem impracticable for a every day carry.  I will say that I like the one for the 42 better.  The rear sights are just covered by the holster, where as my 43 (MD-4) the gun sits down in it a little deeper... resulting in a slight draw ""issue"".  Or perhaps I'm just really used to my 42 sticky holster. (MD-1).. fits the gun extremely well.  Deedzz's pic looks like his sits in a little deeper too.... I like how my 42 rear sights are just a hair covered by the soft holster...exposes a bit more of the grip.  http://www.stickyholsters.com/products/md-4-medium-sticky-holster"

After owning a G26 Gen 4 and trading it away for a G35 Gen 3 then selling the G35 to my dad, I have come into a G19 Gen 3 FDE. Traded this for a Springfield 1911 GI Champion I had picked up a few weeks ago for $260 off Armslist.  This G19 came with the box and 2 magazines and with the GDXxxx serial seems to be made in 2004. It seems to have seen less than 500 rounds due to the minimal barrel wear along with still have the factory copper on the rails. Overall I'm happy with the trade and will most likely actually hold onto this one.  Lastly any ""upgrades"" I can do to this on the cheap?

Glocks,3bgwp6,Relaxin2k,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:06:02 2015 UTC,Is it an aftermarket mag?  Sort of both really. I want it to be comfortable but the G26 in the waist didn't feel too bad.

But if the +1 or +2 mags stick out just slightly less than the G19 I think I'd rather the larger one
Glocks,3bgwp6,Relaxin2k,2,Mon Jun 29 03:10:11 2015 UTC,"The extended mags+grip are aftermarket. Obviously still don't hold as many as a g19, but can always carry extra mags. I would just try and see what fits best with your body and the position you want to carry. There are guys who can make a g17 work, and if you're really wanting a g19 I'm sure there's some way to make it work. You can basically then the 26 into a 19 or 17 with one of their mags for range time as well, aside from the shorter barrel."
Glocks,3bgwp6,Medic7816,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:14:32 2015 UTC,"I would do either the 19 or the 43. If you have other handguns, I would go with the 43 for a dedicated CCW. It will be slimmer, lighter, and you will find it much easier to carry than the 19. Ease of carrying=carrying more often.   If you do not have any other handguns, I think that I would go with the 19. The 19 is such a versatile size, that it is a great all round gun. They hide surprising well with a good belt and holster. They are large enough to be enjoyable and accurate for a range day. Enough capacity that you can compete with it if you so choose.   I had a 26 for a while, but I found that I rarely carried it. It was too big to put in my pocket, so if I was going to carry it on my belt, it used the exact same holster as my 19, so I would carry that one instead and have 50% more firepower.   If you only have the budget for one gun, go with the 19. If this is for nothing but CCW, go with the 43."

It was the first glock I have shot, so I'm definitely not a biased fan boy of them. The slide was easier to manipulate, the mags were easier to load, and there was no safety, which I somewhat prefer on a gun that size. That being said, they are very similar in a lot of ways, and I don't think that you could go wrong with either. As for the aesthetics of them, while the glock is just that, a glock, it does feel better and look less cheap than the shield.

My main issue is capacity however there is a reliable mag extension for the 43 that puts it at 7+1 while increasing the size negligibly. The same company makes a +2 extension with similar success that keeps it smaller than the same 8+1 in the shield.   I will be buying my via gssf coupon which is under $400. This makes the price difference negligible as well and I expect the market to turn towards $450 or less on them soon anyway.   At the end of the day it feels, shoots, and points like a glock. It will play nice with my glock 19 that I carry on a daily basis and helps me to maintain consistency across my carry and competition options."

In the AZ summer months it's a bit too bulky to carry in shorts and tanks, thankfully the 43 fits perfectly into the niche.  I formerly had a Shield, didn't fit right in my hands and never took a liking to the proportions. The barrel length on the 43 is slightly longer giving better velocity and, though you probably won't use it, sight radius. The S&W is much better on the wallet, and you can probably pick up relatively new firearms second hand for cheap from 43 or Kahr converts.  That being said, I prefer the 43. With Glock's following and the number of after market supporters, expanding the capacity of the mags won't be much of an issue, sights and internals are cross compatible with the 42 are already on the market, and the ergos are as good as I could hope for from a production gun (medium hands, fingers fit perfectly in the 19 hand grooves).

Glocks,3bg8fk,fadelio,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:17:30 2015 UTC,Having shot both a lot I think the shield shoots about 20% better. And has a higher round count. All other features go to the Glock.  For the money I'd get a shield. (I have a 43 with night sights and spent money on a ghost trigger - if I wouldn't lose so much money I'd trade for a shield)
Glocks,3bg8fk,fadelio,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:29:18 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate how it shoots ""20% better"""
Glocks,3bg8fk,SepmerFidelis,2,Thu Jul 2 21:17:18 2015 UTC,"Sure. The shield is larger so it fits better in my hand. Also, heavier so less perceived recoil. I am surprised it shoots better since the sights sit higher above the hand than the Glock 43.   The trigger is plastic but pulls better (comparing Factory stock triggers on both).  From the first shot and follow up shots it stays put and gets back on target faster.    Note: I have since our a rubber over mould grip on the Glock and have not done a side by side with it on, yet.  I like the Glock mags better and disassembly is easier with Glock, but the shield is a better shooter.   I'm just one guy with an opinion. But, the two former military dudes with me at the range agreed - it wasn't a close race - the shield is better.   Shoot both, neither is a bad gun."

Glocks,3bgj43,tuccified,2,Mon Jun 29 01:50:13 2015 UTC,"The polygonal rifling creates a lot of lead build-up.   So while you shouldn't shoot lead with the stock barrel, if you pop off a box of 50 and make sure you clean the lead out properly you aren't going to have a problem. What causes problems, increases in pressure, is shooting lead and then sending some jacketed stuff down range.  Lead is much softer than copper so the lead build-up in the rifling doesn't effect pressure as much or as quickly as the copper.    So to be safe, don't shoot lead. If it's all you have, only shoot lead and scrub the hell out of the barrel after your day at the range.

I have read of many threads over many different forums where people have gone through several slide mounted RDS Optics due to the battery they take from the rearward momentum and sudden stop. The hotter the load, and the lighter the slide... The higher the g forces the RDS will be exposed to. Mounting a RDS like this supposedly eliminates that from the equation of red dot reliability. On the flip side this offers no provisions for back up irons at the supposed cost of increased red dot reliability.   The rail was introduced by request of a government agency who also had some red dot failures and wanted a optic mounted to a rail that would ensure a zero between the light and red dot. The polymer frame was supposedly losing zero between the light/laser and RDS. This is all according to the manufacturer.   For my uses? I wanted to run this in USPSA and compare it against a nice set of iron sights for speed and performance from a G19 vs the G17 as equipped above."
Glocks,3be7qm,stDemigod,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:49:53 2015 UTC,Oh yea: I forgot to mention it does fit the G19 but it overhangs the frame a bit and you will need to remove both front and rear sights.   If you don't remove the front sight from the G19 it will impact the mount due to the shorter slide of the G19.

Glocks,3bcb1l,zaitcev,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:04:10 2015 UTC,"Looks like the firing pin safety is permanently off for one reason or the other. Normally what happens is that the striker protrudes at the shot, but when the slide slams its stop at the end of the travel, the striker goes back enough for the safety block to fall down and prevent it from protruding while gun feeds and chambers.  You can test this by pressing on the safety block from below with your finger. You should sense the spring tension.  I don't think you'd forget to install the block entirely, but perhaps the spring is missing? Could it jump out unnoticed when you disassembled the slide?  P.S. About this getting noticeable in the middle of the match, maybe enough dirt got into the block's channel."
Glocks,3bcb1l,Inflammo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:18:30 2015 UTC,Safety spring and plunger were definitely in the gun. It seems as though the striker is staying protruded for a hair too long before retracting. Which would give the round enough time to get up to the breach.  And it began almost as soon as the match started. I don't think I had one run where it functioned flawlessly. Which is weird because this was the first time I've ever had any trouble with this gun.

What I'm reading is real-world testimony from someone who sees the results of different calibers daily, on people, as opposed to YouTube ballistics gel videos.  I could (half-) jokingly say that your flair explains why you're so quickly discounting this article."
Glocks,3b9avk,bAMBIEN,4,Sat Jun 27 01:34:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe my definition of biased is different from others. But to clarify...   I'm a pharmacist, and part of our job is to decipher good scientific literature that is well thought out, designed, written, interpreted, etc, from the not so great scientific articles. We have an entire class taught to us on how to do it, and are tested on it during our clinical exams.   Pretty much, taking someones 'word for it' is the definition of bias. Even if he was completely unbiased and didn't have a hidden agenda, and didn't know the caliber of the bullet until after the data is collected, the fact that he wrote this article means that the article is under his own bias, as well as reliant on his own skills and interpretations. And looking at his skills, it definitely seems like he says 'oh big hole, must mean 9mm sucks' or 'oh I see a lot of bodies with 9mm so 9mm must suck' etc. Maybe if he was a pathologist or trauma surgeon then I could take him more seriously.   And then he talks about how ballistic gel isn't a good representation of the human body. Ok, I get it. Makes sense. But he offers no alternative or any pictures of evidence to illustrate how a body truly effects the bullet path. And back to ballistic gel. It's objective. We can see the path of a bullet and compare it to a different caliber bullet. No bias. No interpretation. Just data. Should we have better more accurate tests? Absolutely. But should we put our lives on the line and spread mass hysteria about 9mm rounds based on some retired cop turned mortician who probably would have claimed big calibers were better before he even became a mortician? No.   In my profession this would be the same thing as accepting as gospel what a drug rep told us about the superiority of a new expensive drug versus a tried and true drug that costs pennies, without reading the actual data."

But should we put our lives on the line and spread mass hysteria about 9mm rounds based on some retired cop turned mortician who probably would have claimed big calibers were better before he even became a mortician? No.   I could counter that with ""should you put your life on the line and spread mass fanaticism about 9mm rounds based on ballistics gel/YouTube commando videos? No"".

Glocks,3b4jtk,capteurdereves,3,Fri Jun 26 02:05:02 2015 UTC,"TL;DR I'm the opposite then most here. I have several XDM's  3.8 Compact 9mm, 4.5 9mm, and 5.25 in 45acp. I started shooting on a Gen3 17.  But when one of my range buddies brought in a XDM 4.5  and I shot it for the first time, I fell in love. There is something about the grip angle that is so different than Glock. Now having said that (flame suit on)  I love my Gen4 21. I love the fact, that I know when I pull the trigger the gun will go BANG everytime, with minimal working parts. But I simply shoot the XDM's so much better than my Glock, as the grip angle fits me better for just a natural Point of Aim.  I can grab the front sight post and put 2"" groupings consistently, in self defensive training. I carry the XDM 3.8 9mm and my XDS 3.3 45acp quite a bit, but like the 3.8 just for round count. Many complain about the ""Spongyness"" of the XDM line, but I don't know... I like it, I'm comfortable with it, it feels natural and right when I shoot.  I like my Glock trigger as well. But I'm not running competitions and don't like a trigger with no take up. I want a lil leeway, before the Bang. My biggest suggestion, is shoot both, and see what you like! I love guns, and own many. But find myself shooting my XDM's the most. Even over my 1911's, I just shoot them so much more accurately.    ** Wanted to note that I have never had an issue with Glock or XDM being reliable. My 1911's give me the most trouble, finicky and etc."
Glocks,3b4jtk,Vell_Hung,2,Fri Jun 26 14:53:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have a XD 9 subcompact and I carried it since 2005 in MN. I like it a lot. I then got a XDs .45 and carried that in my pocket. I love both guns. Even had a 340PD that I pocket carried.  All that said, I really wanted more rounds in my gun if I needed to use it. I hope I never do like most people but I sure feel good having at least 15+1 now with my G19 gen4. I shot about 200 rounds of my carry ammo to trust it and it shot way better and the trigger was smooth.  I'll still keep my XD since it was my first. I really like XD's and enjoyed the grip safety. I find myself mentally slow with my Glock when I reholster yet. Hoping practice helps with that."
Glocks,3b4jtk,brauchmal,2,Thu Jun 25 23:29:06 2015 UTC,I did the opposite. I had several Xd's and a Xdm. Sold or traded all of them except my 45 service which I have done a lot of trigger work on. I used to dislike glock because they felt akward in my hand. But everytime I shot my friend's or my wife's glock I was grouping exceptionally better than with my xd's. So I made the change to glock. They are much smaller and the stock trigger is better than any stock Springfield  in my opinion.
Glocks,3b4jtk,glock1927,2,Fri Jun 26 00:15:38 2015 UTC,"I came over from an M&P Shield, and I'm incredibly happy."
Glocks,3b4jtk,deepsoulfunk,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:10:52 2015 UTC,"I get better results with my XDm, generally. I like its features, such as fully ambidextrous magazine release. It is 100% reliable, too. However, Springfield have no answer to Glock 42, and cannot have. Due to ATF scoring, small .380 autos have to be made domestically, and Springfield have no domestic production capability. Therefore, if you go for a 3-inch .380 with modern operation, it has to be either Glock 42 or Kahr CT380.  P.S. In my experience, traditional Glocks have excellent reliablity, about the same as XD overall. So it cannot be a deciding factor. Note that people get lemons in both families from time to time."

Glocks,3b1doc,theazman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:37:12 2015 UTC,I just installed new sights a few weeks ago.  First time I've done that.  Front sight was a breeze and the rear took a little work.   Vice (cloth/rubber padding to protect the side). hammer punches (preferably something that won't mar the sights/side). file (I used a triangle) micrometer (to center)   Just use your best judgement.  I bumped in the rear sights until I felt uncomfortable with the force needed to continue.  Took them out and filled (lightly) on the witness marks.  Repeat until they're in.  Center with micrometer.  Shoot stuff!

Most people don't carry with .22 because it tends to be unreliable and may not cycle fully when you need it to which defeats the entire purpose.  Its perfectly fine to train with though.  As far as other brand ""Glocks"" go; he probably meant anything striker fired made of polymer."
Glocks,3b1fy3,SaadFather,-4,Thu Jun 25 14:42:57 2015 UTC,I AM here for the advice but why is everything I say wrong? Like my instructor says he's never heard of anyone volunteering to stand in front of a .22 so it is a good defense round

I'm not sure why I waited so long to get one. The trigger is great and I can really shoot tight groups with it. WAY better than my XD subcompact 9mm which I carried off and on along with my XDs 45(last year or two) for the last 10 years.  I love it!
Glocks,3awfmu,brauchmal,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:35:57 2015 UTC,I carry an XDS 45 as well! I would carry this but my small frame makes its kind of difficult to carry something that large.

Carrying 5+1 in my XDs 45 was great till I really started to think about it more. Some say ""You shouldn't need more than 6 - 10 rounds"" which I used to agree with. You never know I guess. I love my XDs though...shoots well and I pocket carry it. I'm a gun hoarder now...once I get one I don't let it go."

Glocks,3asmow,ChiefSittingBear,8,Tue Jun 23 15:31:50 2015 UTC,Because a lot of 9mm guys don't like .40 s&w. Might as well jusr go up to best mm.

That piece if shit jammed like nothing I have seen before. I cleaned it, took it apart to check things over. It jammed on every type of ammo you put in it. The only ammo it would shoot was cci. Plus she bought it at the high of the 22 scare.   She gave it to me when I bought her a taurus 9mm. It has been in my safe because I don't want to deal with the frustration!"

Glocks,3aq3dv,raw157,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:34:09 2015 UTC,"The first time I shot it I used standard velocity mini mags, that wasn't much fun. Then I started using mini mags and it functions perfectly. The only other ammo I used was some mystery bag ammo that a buddy brought out. I think it might have been Remington. That mystery ammo worked fine too, perhaps because it was broken in by that point."
Glocks,3aq3dv,Gonza200,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:41:33 2015 UTC,"Good news: This problem can be fixed!   There is an inherent design problem in which the extractor doesn't have enough clearance inside the slide to properly extract the casings of most .22LR ammo, especially bulk .22LR ammo. HV ammo like Mini-Mags work without issue, but if you want to shoot more types of ammo you can contact ATI (the new group that took over M22 imports after Legacy) and they will work on your gun for free. I just got mine back and they replaced the extractor and modified the slide to give more clearance.  I haven't had a chance to shoot it yet but I hear this resolves the issue of jamming up all the time. I'm excited to go shoot it again, the jamming sucks but it is a very fun gun to shoot when it works."
Glocks,3aq3dv,SonsOfLiberty86,3,Fri Jun 26 17:47:21 2015 UTC,Pretty sure they got sued and had to change the looks a little bit. I have never found many reviews on them though. Would be a decent trainer pistol. You probably can find 9mm in better supply depending on where you live.

I got excited when I saw them for so cheap a while ago but when I saw the external hammer, I assume they were sa/da (or even sa only) and not a striker fired 22. If it was the latter, that would be a cool trainer."
Glocks,3aq3dv,jayemo,3,Tue Jun 23 00:46:16 2015 UTC,"Striker fired is hard to do on a .22 since the cases are riding a fine line of strong enough to not go off easily and soft enough to be set off easily, this gets worse on .22 WMR guns. In order to make a striker work you need a big striker or a strong spring that the recoil of a .22LR can't reset. I suppose you also want a delayed blowback .22LR while you're at it?"
Glocks,3aq3dv,wolfgangmob,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:19:50 2015 UTC,"Ah, good info!  I honestly didn't put much research into it (clearly, doh). When I first got my g19, I started looking at 22lr conversion kits and came across  the tac sol but damn is that expensive! I figured for that much, I could get a decent dedicated 22lr pistol (which I ended up doing, Ruger mkiii 22/45 lite). But looking back, if that tac sol conversion retains the the same trigger feel as the stock g19, I think it would be worth the extra coin. Thoughts?"
Glocks,3aq3dv,jayemo,2,Tue Jun 23 23:25:45 2015 UTC,"For a trainer upper the TSG-22 is designed to be just that, you can even use the same suppressor as a 17 or 19 if your 9mm barrel uses 1/2-28 threading, just might need to be careful of increased fouling and lead build up. Personally if I had the money I would go with a trainer set up if my Glock was my primary carry gun but I would prefer the 22/45 since I want a dedicated .22LR pistol before getting a .22LR trainer conversion for my 19."
Glocks,3aq3dv,wolfgangmob,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:37:40 2015 UTC,"Interesting...

I would prefer the 22/45   It's a very, very nice pistol. I've got one and it's always my favorite to shoot at the range.

Glocks,3alul0,tumbleweed_DO,-9,Wed Jun 24 03:08:09 2015 UTC,Cool and all but let's not pretend that the internal or trigger safeties are effective. It's essentially like putting a brake on a gas pedal. If you pull the trigger it goes bang. Trigger discipline is the real safety.
Glocks,3alul0,GlockCock80,4,Mon Jun 22 01:52:11 2015 UTC,I think the point is the gun will only fire if you are pulling on the trigger with your finger.
Glocks,3alul0,bumkty,-4,Mon Jun 22 03:44:06 2015 UTC,Right. Which is really no safety at all.
Glocks,3alul0,GlockCock80,4,Mon Jun 22 04:29:09 2015 UTC,"A safety does not exist to prevent you from pulling the trigger but to prevent the gun from firing when the trigger is not intentionally pulled.  Glocks safety does exactly that. You can toss the gun around as much as you like, it wont fire. There is absolutely no need for a different safety design, especially if you want the handgun to be operable under the most stressful situations.   In the German military for example there are many reports of soldiers struggeling to release the safety under stress which lead to the P8 Combat which has no safety at all, just a decocker(and the abysmal trigger weight).  Since you wear a handgun in a holster most of the time there really is no need for safeties like those on rifles which nowadays only have them because gear could enter the trigger guard and hang on to the trigger. If rifles would be carried in holsters you would have the same safe action system on them.  Besides that: Glocks have been used for decades without reports of the safety failing. The current debate in New York is just a cover up for poor training. If you pull a gun and an external safety is the only thing that can prevent you from accidentally discharging a round you need more training, not a gun with an external safety."

I really only started seriously considering the G19 after going to the range a few times because the one I'm near only rents G19s, and not G26s or G27s. I tried it a couple times and I'm completely comfortable with it, and it's still not a particularly large gun, so on my medium-large frame I can conceal it easily enough.

No Nill Grips, no flashy chrome add ons, no full melt treatment from a super custom gunsmith to give them that soft look, no skeletonized hammers, bobbed hammers and all that jazz that people need to stick on Berettas and 1911s and J-Frames to give them just a little custom touch.  That means for 95% of the Glock population, the external mods you can do that everyone can appreciate are:  Color fill, longer mags, new sights and grip work (stippling, reduction, undercut trigger guards).

Eventually,  balance the nickle on the front sight post instead of the slide and continue to learn how the trigger pulls, smoothly.

An FOID card is required prior to:  A) TOUCHING a handgun at the counter. B) Buying ammunition.  You can get the card application in at the same time, but doing so is going to be around $52.  The handgun purchase permit is $2, but requires a $20 mental health and background check for each time you request them. You may do 3 permits at once, but oh... did you want to buy three handguns? Sorry, one a month. The permits expire after 90 days from issuance. You may get them extended, but that's another trip down to the police station.  When you fill out your paperwork, be sure to provide the names of 2 responsible adult references who WILL be contacted. They send them letters that have to be filled out and mailed back. In my case, both letters were ""mysteriously not delivered."" I got assurances from the clerk that she always does them within a day of receiving the application.  My references live in different towns. I'm guessing they were misplaced or never mailed out. They issued new copies and blamed that for the delay. More crap. My friends got their letters on a Friday. They were in the mail by Sunday for the Monday pick up. Most northern NJ mail takes ~2days from township to township where there's less than a 50 min drive.  Did you want a gun that can hold more than 15rds? Better hope that:  A) Your gun store is willing to alter your magazines for you. B) The manufacturer makes a lower capacity magazine.  Most times it is 10rds, because they don't like to have to deal with crap like State X does 10, Y does 12, Z does 15. They just make restricted mags, and that's it.

The events are a selling point if you are looking for a new hobby, people do win free guns at the matches if they are large enough and it would be a fun way to do some shooting, but they are spread out, either you live near a place that has GSSF matches or not, they don't exactly do traveling matches."

Glocks,3a4z15,rainy0days,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:25:45 2015 UTC,More space around the front sight means faster acquisition.

Glocks,3a398q,jayemo,5,Tue Jun 16 21:51:27 2015 UTC,+6 extension on a G19 magazine inside a G26 would actually be pretty decent... 21 rounds and would fill your whole hand.

Glocks,3a398q,7SigmaEvent,2,Wed Jun 24 02:27:10 2015 UTC,"My first adventures in extended Glock 19 magazines opened my eyes to other potential options for higher-cap mags.   I started thinking about factory Glock 17 mags with the X-Grip THEN started thinking about Glock 17 mags, with the X-Grip, and with factory +2s BUT THEN started thinking about Glock 17 mags, with X-Grip, and with aftermarket extensions...  And thus we find the Glock 17 mag combined with Arredondo +6 extension and aftermarket spring. In the album you'll find some comparison pictures. On paper this seems like a sweet range mag setup (23 rounds within a relatively ""compact"" package - the fun sticks add lots of attention and size) but I haven't actually shot it yet. While loading/unloading rounds with it, it seems legit but again I can't/wont vouch until I've hit the range."
Glocks,3a398q,fuckthepolis2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:51:35 2015 UTC,Does the little grip extension slide up and down on the magazine or does it fix in place?

Glocks,3a2zxb,Engelmacher,3,Wed Jun 17 00:23:06 2015 UTC,I have one from them that I picked up on a sale locallt from them.   I like the extra weight..and I enjoy the aesthetics of a metal guide rod. That's it. I wouldn't pay 70 bucks for it.
Glocks,3a2zxb,EbScrooge,3,Tue Jun 16 23:14:05 2015 UTC,"It really wont help accuracy.  In theory, it helps mitigate recoil for faster follow up shots.  Just get a stainless steel guide rod for 1/4 of the price and have a nice looking gun, be able to swap out recoil springs, and have more longevity than an OEM rod or tungsten rod. There have been a few accounts of tungsten recoil rods shattering since the metal is so hard and brittle."
Glocks,3a2zxb,zaitcev,2,Tue Jun 16 23:17:43 2015 UTC,"I got one for the 42, really just out of curiosity. I liked the feel of the weight and it looked cool..... but it keeps causing light strikes. I've tried it in both my 42s and I still get light strikes. So I stuck the original polymer guide rod back in. I've never tried one with my bigger Glocks, though I would be willing."
Glocks,3a2zxb,hi12345654321,3,Wed Jun 17 03:13:21 2015 UTC,"Belive it or not, light strikes on 42 may be caused by insufficient lubrication. The telltale sign is that the position of the nick on the primer is noticeably off-center. In such case, I'd take that spring module and really soak it in the #9, then shoot it that way. The insides of the gun are going to be covered in oil, and you have to remove the excess several times, but it may help."

Glocks,39y8p6,gramcooke,8,Mon Jun 15 20:45:10 2015 UTC,"It's not that I didn't like the Kahr. I just like the Glock way better. I carried the Kahr for nearly 2 years. I put probably 1500-2000rds through it without a single malfunction unless you count a dud primer. The trigger pull is EXTRRREEEMMMEELLLYYY long, but other than that yeah, it's a great gun at a great price."

Glocks,39y8p6,capteurdereves,3,Tue Jun 16 17:22:06 2015 UTC,"I own a few G19s and have owned and carried a Kahr CM9. I sold the Kahr but not out of necessity. The Kahr pistol itself is great. The trigger pull is different but by no means bad. Yes, it is long but it's smooth as silk and there's no wall, it just breaks. In fact, writing this makes me want another Kahr. There are, however, other issues with the Kahr. The magazines are COMPLETE shit. I had two followers break while I owned the Kahr. Apparently they machine the feed ramp too long which then hits the follower on the last round eventually breaking it. If you post about this on the forums then they will accuse you of being a Kahr hater, how it's not Kahr's fault and how it's not a big deal to send in a BRAND NEW pistol for repair. They'll also claim it's a small subset of Kahr pistols with this issue even though half of the threads in the technical forum involve broken followers. They're so bad that people try to use magazines meant for other pistols instead (such as the P239 magazines IIRC). In fact, they do use 1911 style magazines in the .45 caliber Kahrs. If Kahr got their act together with respect to their magazines then I'd own a lot of them. Until then, I can't recommend them to anyone."
Glocks,39y8p6,brilliant_beast,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:38:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm. That's interesting. I didn't visit the Kahr forums but a few times and didn't really like the atmosphere there. They all praised one guy cause he had 3800rds through his Kahr. I didn't see what was so special. Anyway, I never had an issue with my mags, and even looking at them now, I don't see any evidence of damage from the feed ramp. But who knows, maybe I got lucky."

If you are that close and trying to connect with center mass, for me, I use the whole outline of the gun and the sights as a ""sight picture"". I dunno if that is ""metal on meat"" or what.   Personally,  I want crisp sights for difficult shots.   I have Ameriglo I dots on one glock. All the others, including my carry gun have a fiber front and blacked out rear, just like what dominates a lot of competition.   For me, I think that's the way to go. When I shoot steel challenge and we shoot a really fast stage like smoke and hope, getting all of the gun on the big targets is all of a sight picture I see."

Glocks,39xbtn,Warfightr,2,Mon Jun 15 15:48:33 2015 UTC,"i have the x300u and love it on my g19. The benefits to me are that its tough as nails and it's a surefire. its stupid easy to mount on and off. finally, it's bright as all hell, and i also use it on my AR as a rifle light.  Negatives are that it's expensive. also, the tabs it uses to connect with are hard plastic (which causes concern for some, but i have yet to ever witness anybody actually have issues with them). some also complain about the brightness level, which would not be as big a concern with the x300 instead of the x300u, saying that youll blind yourself indoors at night (a bs claim IMHO).   TLR has a great reputation though, and youll be happy with either."
Glocks,39xbtn,Whitt91,2,Mon Jun 15 17:33:37 2015 UTC,"I have an X300U. I like how you can activate it by pushing on the paddle, instead of actually flipping it down/up. The theory is that you're supposed to quickly light up your target, ID it, and engage if necessary, and then immediately turn the light off in case there are other threats nearby. Having the light constantly on tells the baddies where to shoot, apparently.   I do, however, like how the TLR-1 has a strobe option (TLR-1s?)."
Glocks,39xbtn,r0ckh0und,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:04:32 2015 UTC,I've got the grip switch on mine and it is awesome.
Glocks,39xbtn,txanarchy,2,Thu Jun 18 19:34:10 2015 UTC,"They're both industry standards for pistol lights. I have both, and tend to prefer the TLR-1's overall for most things. The TLR-1 is smaller, about half the price, and has roughly the same overall performance. What I prefer the Surefire for is if it's on a duty gun, or something I know that's going to be beat around. That's not to say the TLR-1 isn't bullet proof reliable, but I'd say the Surefire has the slight edge in ruggedness. I also like the X300's mounting system a bit more(there's nothing wrong with the TLR-1's mount though), and it also has a much better tape switch if you plan on using one. The normal paddle switches are pretty intuitive on either light, so that's a toss up.   As far as the X300u/TLR-1HL being too bright indoors myth that I keep seeing here, that's total nonsense. Both lights were designed to be used indoors. They're not ""brighter"" than their 300ish lumen counterparts. Lumens do not equal brightness. They throw a greater amount of light over a greater area, aka a wider beam and more flood. The peak intensity of both lights is less than 10% more than their lower lumen counterparts. So no, you will not blind yourself with an HL or X300u. A real reason to consider the lower lumen counterparts though is that they typically have about twice the battery life of the HL and X300u."

Glocks,39xbtn,southeast_boarder,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:05:42 2015 UTC,"I say get whichever one you can find locally for a good price. You really cannot go wrong with either IMO. I'm a surefire whore, so my pistols wear x300's and x300u's and my AR wears a mini scout. My first weapon lights were TLR's. The 630 lumens of the TLR 1 HL was too bright for me indoors, but I feel the x300u's 500 is a very good option. My Glock 19 and AR's lights are only 200 lumens though to ensure I don't blind myself indoors."

I've shot a little under 100  rounds out of 5 different Gen 3s (17, 19, 26, and 27), and imo there's not a huge difference, but I'm not well versed in Glocks or firearms in general. The best comparison I can offer is to my Shield and imo it's a better gun.    I'm able to hit what I aim at more consistently thus far, but it DOES fit better in my hand. However even in dry fire practice I can keep it steady with greater ease as well and a lot of this I attribute to a lighter cleaner trigger. I do miss the loaded chamber indicator though, that was one really nice innovation I'm learning to live without."

I changed the plastic sights out for steel Tritium Fiber Optic for $100.

Glocks,39s8o1,jackets17,0,Sun Jun 14 14:49:29 2015 UTC,"You're gonna drop 400 dollars into a 500 dollar pistol? For starters that's absurd, at best 120 bucks for some good night sights and that's all you would ever need for a glock. Secondly if you're willing to spend 900 dollars total why not just go for a higher end pistol like a H&K or Sig Sauer?"
Glocks,39s8o1,ReVo5000,6,Sun Jun 14 06:58:49 2015 UTC,"Well, let's see.   $120 Trijicon night sights  $120 Streamlight TLR-1 HL  $85 Good kydex holster (went with www.Ravenconcealment.com) Yet it's the non flashlight model, it can be higher in price.  $14 Extended slide release   $13 Extended slide lock lever  from $120 to $170 for a trigger assembly  Normally I'd buy a couple of mags and a holster for them, let's just be generous and say $100 for mags and holster...  So... 120+120+85+14+13+120 (taking the lowest price of the trigger)+100 = $572 and it could be more... Yet not all of them are required it's hard to tell anyone how to spend their money."
Glocks,39s8o1,sad_heretic,3,Sun Jun 14 08:00:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is a reasonable set of accoutrements for a carry gun.  And probably could go for a flashlight holster as well, maybe."
Glocks,39s8o1,MirolynMonbro,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:45:58 2015 UTC,Why night sights if you're putting a light on it? Put some defoor's on there and save almost $100
Glocks,39s8o1,ReVo5000,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:46:32 2015 UTC,Because OP might not always want to use the light? It depends on the scenario when I would use the light...
Glocks,39s8o1,rainy0days,3,Tue Jun 16 08:28:17 2015 UTC,"I never understood why people think putting money into something that is relatively inexpensive is a bad thing(I keep seeing the same stupid statement in car related threads lately). It's very easy to drop 400 and more on a Glock with a barrel, trigger, sights, and other knick knacks that will make it more personal and more competitive than a stock ""higher end"" pistol. I've spent way more than that getting an end result that I simply could not buy or get from any other company.   Speaking of higher end, there are very few Sigs or HK's that I would rather use than a Glock for most applications. They're nice but Glock simply offers things they can't. Larger aftermarket, simpler to work on, parts and mags are cheaper and easier to find, more holsters, etc.   Now to answer the OP's question, get whichever feels better in your hand, unless you plan on doing a bunch of grip work. Then it really doesn't matter. They're virtually the same gun minus the texture, the finger grooves feel a bit different, removable backstraps, and the reversible mag release. The mechanical differences like the recoil spring really aren't that noticeable. So look into what feels better and what features appeal to you, and get that. I personally like the gen 4's because they have a larger mag release and the grips are smaller with no backstrap. On the otherhand, I have no problem shooting gen 3's and own many of them."

Also, if upgrades are what you're so worried about then maybe you should do your own research instead of asking internet strangers. I own several Glocks, and that was my pistol of choice until I could afford better pistols and now that I do I can say without a doubt that Sig or H&amp;K is better money spent.

Benchrest G26 can easily do a 1"" group at that range.    The 1911 has a dramatically different trigger... single action, very little creep with typically a sharp break.  It's just breaking before you have a chance to yank the gun around pulling the trigger."
Glocks,39izr8,cosmos7,2,Fri Jun 12 03:44:02 2015 UTC,"I'm just the opposite, and I do believe it's because of the trigger.  I'm used to being able to load my trigger pretty ""heavy,"" then pull that last little bit to break.  My 1911 does not offer the same luxury, and I tend to be all over the place with it.  My G17 has never given me that issue, and I think it's just because my body prefers the heavier, but still predictable trigger.  OP's probably just the opposite of me."

Glocks,393z3d,Aerial_Screw,3,Tue Jun 9 03:39:23 2015 UTC,"I had shot a quite expensive G17 with an RMR milled into the slide and the reciprocating dot was not easy to keep up with between shots. I would lose the dot after every shot and then have to find it again quickly before taking a follow up shot. ALG Defense mounts the optic on the frame and since the dot doesn't add weight to the slide nor does it reciprocate, I don't lose the dot between shots. It just moves slightly, then it's right back on target. The mount is 100% reversible too, if one day I don't want to have an optic on the pistol anymore, I can easily remove it in a few minutes and install a set of sights."

Glocks,393z3d,magalahi,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:19:45 2015 UTC,"A few quick notes after looking at this mount. It's entirely different in a few key areas.    On the genuine ALG mount, there are lugs built into the mount that correspond in the Aimpoint base. So not only is it screwed in with 4 small screws, the lugs are keyed into the base to keep it secure. Without the lugs, I could see the very small screws shearing pretty easily. These lugs are built into the Larue and factory Aimpoint weaver mounts that I have for the H1 on my AR. This difference is the most concerning to me.  The Genuine ALG mount doesn't have a hole in it for the top locking block pin, this is a minor difference that shouldn't effect usability.  The Genuine ALG magwell has a nice heavy brass grip plug that adds some weight. I believe the weight helps balance out some of the weight of the optic. Again, this shouldn't effect usability."
Glocks,393z3d,wolfgangmob,0,Wed Jun 10 14:09:58 2015 UTC,Trijicon RMR (depending on model) is $550+ (often more). Primary Arms MD-ADS is $160.  RMR + slide melts = $700 (Approximate)  MD-ADS + 6-second mount = $410 (Approximate)
Glocks,393z3d,magalahi,0,Tue Jun 9 18:15:20 2015 UTC,You can also find knock off RMR that would bring the cost of slide melting and sight less than $300 (approximate).
Glocks,393z3d,wolfgangmob,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:07:21 2015 UTC,"That's true, but the RMR is tested and works very well. Are the knockoffs tested? Because direct slide-mounted optics take a serious beating.  The MD-ADS has been shown to take massive amounts of beating and it still keeps ticking. Even if it wouldn't, it's not directly mounted to the slide so it wouldn't really have to.  Additionally, if you get a slide tapped for a specific optic, you're limited to that optic. If you use the 6-second mount, you can use any H1/T1 screw-pattern optic (Aimpoint H1, H2, T1, T2, Primary Arms MD-ADS, MD-RGBII, Hi-Lux Micro-Max B-Dot RDS, etc.).  And the 6-second mount is reversible. If you don't want it anymore, you can take it off and sell it. You can't ""unmelt"" a slide.  There are also many posts about how changing the weight of slide affects reliability (without tuning your guide rod spring assembly), which is not the case with the 6-second mount."
Glocks,393z3d,magalahi,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:12:25 2015 UTC,"PA MD-ADS hasn't been tested the same as an aimpoint, let me know when someone detonates explosives with a rifle using that optic is about 20 feet away and survives."
Glocks,393z3d,wolfgangmob,2,Wed Jun 10 06:06:51 2015 UTC,"You're totally missing the point with this comment. A PA optic on a 6 second mount doesn't even take close to the same beating as a RMR, or a knockoff, would on a reciprocating slide. It's not an Aimpoint but the MD-ADS is one tough cookie. These guys beat the hell out of it, drug it behind a truck, threw it out of a tree, sent it swimming, and even blew it up with 2 lbs. of tannerite. That's more than I would ever dream of doing to my Glock. I'm confident it would hold up to it's intended usage."
Glocks,393z3d,magalahi,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:28:10 2015 UTC,"As I said before, it doesn't need to be as tested as an Aimpoint because it's not directly slide mounted, so it won't take nearly the same beating as an RMR would."
Glocks,393z3d,magalahi,0,Wed Jun 10 14:21:33 2015 UTC,"If you factor in the cost of a Trijicon RMR vs the PA micro dot, I'm still way under."

I was shooting shitty/hard-primered monarch steel case stuff and typically get a few duds per box. Go to rack the slide to clear a dud and holy shit was the lock-up was tight! I've got about 400 rounds through it now and it feels as smooth as the stock barrel.   And nice slide work and optic!
Glocks,3940xb,BloodandBourbon,2,Tue Jun 9 22:29:32 2015 UTC,"What sight is that, and does it fit on the stock slide?"

Glocks,3940xb,LambastingFrog,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:37:29 2015 UTC,The slide was milled at a gun store but my friend are going into business doing it ourselves on a CNC lathe. The RMR is fantastic.

The dealer has a $415 price tag on their units.   I don't get GSSF pricing.    I haven't decided what sights to use.  I love my Taran Tactical sights on my G19 but I think night sights on the 43 is the way to go.   I think I'm going to get a Galco ankle holster since that's the way I like to carry my s&w 642.   That same day, I get to pick up a Winchester 97' clone that's been slicked and tuned for CAS from my FFL.   Thursday will be a good day."

Glocks,396fz3,goguppy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:00:02 2015 UTC,"Heck yes, but it was raining today so I didn't get to go to the range.  I also got 2 extra mags, the standard ones without the grip extension.    I'm reminded how badly I hate the Glock sights and stock trigger weight.  The box says the trigger is set to 5.5lbs but I get 7.5lbs on my gauge.  I'll just have to get used to that again as I don't think I'm going to put in a 3.5lb ghost trigger.    I gave it the standard new gun cleaning and once over but I may have to wait until Sunday to put some rounds on steel."
Glocks,396fz3,goguppy,2,Fri Jun 12 02:37:20 2015 UTC,I've heard the trigger is heavy but I'm like you in that I don't mess with that stuff. The only thing I do is add some sights and talon grips if needed. I've heard the talon rips are good with the 43 so I have some just in case. My 19 Gen 4 doesn't need anything other than sights. I got my Trij HD's today (yellow front) and they look great. I have XS Big Dots on my 19 but I may swap out after seeing these. I'll post pix of my 43 once it's all dressed up. I'll probably have to wait until Saturday to shoot because they recommend 24 hour wait after installing sights.

Glocks,394itm,NaughtyEwokCave,6,Tue Jun 9 05:11:42 2015 UTC,"To my understanding, and take this with a grain of salt as my experience with lead ammo is limited, is that you CAN use lead ammo but will need to clean your barrel in order to get the lead out.  As far as I know the polygonal rifling will gather lead rapidly and needs to be cared for far more than traditional rifling when used with lead."
Glocks,394itm,Zoomington,5,Tue Jun 9 05:28:44 2015 UTC,"I mean, what's the point of a Glock if you have to clean it...   ;)"
Glocks,394itm,southernbenz,7,Tue Jun 9 16:50:09 2015 UTC,"Glock advises not to shoot unjacketed ammo, consult your manual and it will tell you to use fully jacketed bullets. You can get an aftermarket barrel that can shoot lead cast without any concern over leadding and overpressure. Glock uses polygonal rifling, which is not yeilding to lead buildup.   I imagine you could shoot a box in a worst case scenario but is it really worth the risk just to yourself and your gun just to shoot a free box of ammo? I also believe the cast bullets aren't as accurate as a full metal jacket out of the stock barrel, YMMV."
Glocks,394itm,butchersblade,3,Tue Jun 9 05:29:29 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine with only 50 rounds, I'd just be diligent in cleaning is soon after."

Glocks,392tw8,DontStreamThat,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:35:08 2015 UTC,"Good choice, feels good in the hand, shoots great. This is my first firearm. The last 3 months or so i have been going to a local range trying 2 9mm a week with at least 100 rounds through each. i kept coming back to the G17."
Glocks,392tw8,southernbenz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:47:17 2015 UTC,Great choice.  Why did you get a full-size?
Glocks,392tw8,southernbenz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:26:55 2015 UTC,"to me it just felt right in the hand. it seems like that isnt a great explanation. i know you can get a mag ext on smaller versions but it still felt awkward in my hand.   G17 just felt right. Its for home protection and range fun so a full size seemed like the right choice. next purchase is probably something smaller for a carry, where i currently work daily carry isnt an option."

Glocks,3935at,rb1987,0,Wed Jun 10 04:50:01 2015 UTC,"Hows that Ghost connector? How much did you fire the gun before you changed out the connector? For me, the stock trigger has really smoothed out with a lot of dry firing and range time."
Glocks,3935at,pick-six,2,Tue Jun 9 12:33:09 2015 UTC,"The connector is great, I love it. My aim was significantly better and I was able to keep the gun much more stable upon firing. I had shot 350 rounds, a long with countless dry fires before I changed it. I would say its the best $25 I have ever spent on any gun. The stock trigger weighs in at about a 7lb pull and the ghost brings it down to around a 4.5~ish (I am rough estimating). The trigger doesn't hurt your finger tip if you shoot 150 rounds at a time anymore and its a comfortable pull, along with that, it isn't a light enough pull that would be to sketchy to carry. I would highly recommend it to anyone."

Glock will use existing MOS models to fuel data regarding sales and market feedback for quite some time until they decide to release anything else.  When/if they do release additional MOS models, it won't be on compacts and subcompacts.  That's the completely wrong market.  Target shooters don't use 3.3"" barrels, and users of 3.3"" barrels don't want large optics hanging off their concealed carry gun."
Glocks,392guw,leica_boss,4,Mon Jun 8 19:48:19 2015 UTC,This is Glock.  In before G42 MOS.

Glocks,392guw,southernbenz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:07:09 2015 UTC,"I know that the don't have a .45 compact at the moment. I really don't understand why. (separate issue) but I can hope for the future.  The optics like the RMR are really going to get popular in the years to come. The only drawback is cost at the moment, and like all tech, its price will drop as other companies try to make their own.   Now yes, the RMR is not sold to the market of compacts, but I disagree on that principle.  The sights like the RMR eliminate the need for a longer sight radius (and therefore longer barrel) because the dot in in focus when you look at the target. so why bother having the bigger slide?   edit Also, I intent on putting a can on the end of the .45 with the RMR sight. id prefer to have a shorter barrel so try to trim down the overall length of the full weapon. Same reason people get stamps for short barrels on rifles, its to keep the overall length down."

Glocks,38yqw0,hi12345654321,3,Mon Jun 8 02:22:28 2015 UTC,"I wanted to see what the new Magpul GL9 mags were all about and got two from Midway after a recent restock. I also added a couple X-grip mag adapters (these are to run g17 mags in a g19, they make a couple other flavors too) per a comment /u/hi12345654321 made in another thread.  I put the grips on and instantly saw that they were weren’t going to work the same as if it was a factory mag… There is a lip on the back that hits the baseplate and prevents the grip from seating all the way down. In addition to it looking bad, it took a lot of force to seat the magazine (but after hitting the mag release they flew out with force haha).   So out came the dremel. I decided it would be best to just flatten out the rear bit so that the grip can come down more.  After that, they looked a lot better and seated into the pistol with just a tad more force than normal mags. Release is fine but you do you have to roll your grip hand a bit otherwise the mag grip hangs on your hand. No biggie, I’ll only be using these for the range anyway.  For the mag itself, it seems very well built. Disassembly is a breeze and the fit and finish is on par for the other stuff Magpul puts out. My only complaint on the mag is the engagement once seated doesn’t seem as pronounced as the factory mags. They still lock in but you don’t get as firm as a “click” when you seat them.  All in all, cool combo for range mags. I want to get at least one factory G17 mag, +2 baseplate, and another X-grip now, hah. Also curious what the future is for extensions on the Magpuls.   See album for a couple comparisons of before and after as well as some more commentary."

Glocks,38yqw0,nomaroma,2,Mon Jun 8 00:03:29 2015 UTC,"No problem!  Meh not a total waste I don't think, I'll use them for sure but after seeing the pictures side by side it's debatable if the x-grip is that much better aesthetically. I think these would shine a lot more if you were wanting to run g19 mags in a g26 since it would get you some usable grip surface.    My hand fits in the G19 grip so I really dont need the X-grip, but I thought it would be cool.   Ditto, mine felt great right out of the box and even better after messing around with the different backstraps."

Glocks,38vh1g,RANDY_MAR5H,2,Sun Jun 7 06:07:26 2015 UTC,The owner of Ozark is bit-shit crazy and probably wouldn't own up to it.
Glocks,38vh1g,Oakroscoe,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:31:12 2015 UTC,"Well...Glock won't cover it, that's for sure because the after-market barrel.  Storm lake probably won't because they're known to have tighter tolerances than even the stock glock barrel  Only option is the ammo manufacturer."
Glocks,38vh1g,volcanonacho,4,Mon Jun 8 01:23:34 2015 UTC,I thought using remanifactured ammo voided the warranty?
Glocks,38vh1g,Oakroscoe,4,Sun Jun 7 11:22:47 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Glock wouldn't warranty anything with that after market barrel.
Glocks,38vh1g,ben70,3,Sun Jun 7 11:48:55 2015 UTC,Good point.  Guess OP is doubly screwed.  I think the lesson is that it's not worth saving a few bucks to take the risk on reman ammo.

Glocks,38vh1g,originalrunt,9,Sun Jun 7 04:43:55 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I got my Brand New Glock 21. Some guy was at the range shooting Tula or Wolf got a bad box. He put 13rds down the pipe and thgun fell apart in his hands. He sent the gun and remaining ammo to Glock. They determined that it was double charged ammo and replaced it with a Brand new gun. He immediately sold it to the pawn shop saying,""Glocks are a piece of shit I'll never own one again."" Where I picked it up for a song.... $425 for a brand new G21 gen3 with 4mags... BTW the guy was completely un-injured. I would say if your gun suffers a catastrophic failure such as this and you still have both your eyes and all your fingers then it did it's job."

Glocks,38yvn9,Horizonblue,10,Mon Jun 8 00:32:29 2015 UTC,Load the magazines and shoot it.  That trigger spring by itself won't make a huge difference if you are looking to lighten the trigger. A 3.5lb connector and 4lb striker spring combined with that trigger spring is a good combination. I don't suggest doing this if the gun is going to be your carry gun.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Zev-Tech-Glock-Trigger-Starter-Kit-Race-Connector-Competition-Spring-Kit-ZevTech-/271883768081?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3f4d891111

Glocks,38yvn9,421dave,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:21:10 2015 UTC,G19 trigger is serated also.  You need a 17/34 trigger if you're looking for the smooth face.    Otherwise... ammo.  It's a glock.  Go shoot it.  Really I put sights & extended controls on mine.  That's pretty much it except my 43 which has a Ghost connector.  I've tried connectors/springs/etc. in my other glocks and I've always gone back to stock.  They always had a trade-off.

So I looked at the weapon in my hand and applied grip tape only to areas where my strong hand contacts the grip. So it started off as a compromise but now I think it looks awesome.

Figured I should just go ahead and opt for the night sights over just the steel. I also had a weird brown tint to it in natural light I wanted to make sure wasn't anything that'd cause structural harm.    I called in the payment for the sights and they said the brown tint was just from 25 years of use and they could refinish it for another $45. Didn't want to do that since it wasn't rust and let it be. They said I'd have the gun back in 2 weeks from that day, but 2 days later i had it back. Noticed I had a new recoil spring in with the slide. Then read over the repair sheet and saw they gave me a new recoil spring, new extractor, new safety plunger spring, new back plate, new striker assembly, pretty much everything but the slide itself however the brown tint is also gone even though I wasn't charged for it.

Glocks,38rnh4,Soulfader72,2,Mon Jun 8 02:53:49 2015 UTC,My issue with the Glock 42 is it was way late to the game with the single stack 9mm and that they made the mag capacity 6 rounds when it's competitors have 7 or more.
Glocks,38rnh4,JJHunter88,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:50:57 2015 UTC,I agree making a single stack 9mm would have made more sense. It probably came down to someone in marketing making the call...we know how those decisions don't always gel with reality. All that aside I think we're both going to really enjoy this one. I may look into one of those mag extenders I keep hearing about.
Glocks,38rnh4,zaitcev,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:57:12 2015 UTC,"JJ may be confusing 42 and 43, or he may mean that coming out with 42 first delayed the introduction of the 43 -- there's no way to tell from his phrasing. But some folks opined that 42 coming first paved the way for the more important 43. It is after all a new 2-pin platform with coil springs and other differences from every other Glock. So perhaps it was necessary for the success of the 43 and the buyers of the 42 were just suckers left holding the bag. If so, the 42 came out amasingly well. It could be a disaster like Remington R51."
Glocks,38rnh4,TheNapalmNinja,2,Tue Jun 9 02:28:19 2015 UTC,I carry my 42 everyday.   It's light and very concealable.   I've had about 2 or 3 issues with ammo not feeding and I've put about 1000 rounds through it. I trust this pistol.   Plus it's light enough that you can shoot multiple targets very quickly and very accurately.   I'm a firm believer in technique over caliber size.

Glocks,38rnh4,zaitcev,2,Sat Jun 6 22:24:11 2015 UTC,"Solution is obvious: buy some fun .380 guns to keep company for G42. Browning 1911-380, Erma KGP-68A, Taurus M380, Sphinx, Beretta 84/85. Heck maybe even an original Remington 51, I heard it was an excellent gun for 1920s. A Lllama II maybe."
Glocks,38rnh4,nonstopglocktalk,2,Wed Jun 10 03:57:30 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with the 42.  There were issues initially w/ failure to feed, but those have been resolved.  Those holding older 42 models should see the video that OP has posted and return their Glock to the manufacturer if changes are needing made.  Lots of hate on .380 in general, but naturally Glock was going to release the 42 before the 43 in order to reap those extra sales.  If the 43 would have been released 1st I'm guessing not as many people would have purchased the 42.  Sales strategy is all that was albeit a bit late to the game.  A 380 can end a threat just as a 9mm can.  There is never going to be anyone on the barrel end of a Glock 42 scoffing at the fact that it is only a .380 as opposed to a 9mm.  6 rounds of .380 however, obviously one is going to need those shots to count.  I wouldn't feel comfortable giving my girl a 380 and hoping for the best..  practice/training is a must, as with any firearm.  I'm loving my little 42.  Super concealable...makes my baby 26 feel enormous.  Great summer/light clothing gun."

My carry sizes are limited to: knife, NAA, 26, 19.  I really see the 17 and the 34 as competition/range/home defense guns. Since size is not as important as shootability in those roles, I'd get the SLIGHTLY more shootable 34. The 34 is the Production limit in most sports so I say get the limit.  Really.

Glocks,38k0qg,G27AndAnLCP,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:06:04 2015 UTC,The Glock 17 and 34 have the same frame. What's different about the feel in your hands?? The weight?
Glocks,38k0qg,GlockRacer,0,Mon Jun 8 00:04:05 2015 UTC,Im at about 20k through my 34 and wouldn't trade it for a 17.  If you even tried to give me the 100 difference on an equivalently worn out gun I wouldn't.  The little bit of extra weight at the end really helps with muzzle rise and my grouping is about an inch better than i can get with my 19.

Glocks,38mbfw,Gadnuk_,2,Fri Jun 5 06:27:31 2015 UTC,Are both slides not of the same thickness? What about the barrel lugs? Most of what I read on converting G30s to 10mm said people usually just needed the new barrel and a new recoil spring.

Glocks,386pc8,stDemigod,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:51:29 2015 UTC,"Cant comment on where to get the work done but on the removal of the RMR:  Its usually sitting on there bomb proof, especially when it was milled to the exact specifications of your RMR. Even with the MOS platform there is no way to get rid of that thing quickly. You have better luck breaking it than getting it off your gun by sheer force. Quick detachments are currently no available for slide mounted RMRs because they do not sit on rails but on small plates or the slide itself.

Pyramid or fulcrum triggers are really nice, but kind of expensive and unnecessary."
Glocks,382i7k,LilFuniAZNBoi,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:18:00 2015 UTC,"Night sights for sure. Non-performance parts would be a extended slide release like the one on the Glock 34 and the extended take down tabs. A magwell for faster mag swaps or a grip plug for the gap underneath the back straps might make your gun look more flush. A custom engraved back plate will give your Glock a more ""tacticool"" personalized look.   If you really want to ""upgrade"" performance then I would start out with the Zev performance springs (but don't swap the firing pin spring since you might get light strikes) and a Ghost disconnector. They will reduce your travel, any creep, and the trigger weight slightly. A weighted guide rod will theoretically reduce muzzle flip and a match barrel will increase your potential accuracy. If you really hate the trigger then the Pyramid or Fulcrum trigger might be better but then you'd be practically building a competition gun.    I wouldn't modify a carry gun or home defense piece especially if you live in a gun unfriendly state since you might get crucified by the prosecution in court if you ever have to use your gun.

Glocks,3857xq,mandeepy,6,Mon Jun 1 23:04:52 2015 UTC,Either buy online or wait for a local store to get one in... I got mine because it just happened to be in stock at a local store.  The gun store I got mine from said they were getting a shipment of about 1 Glock 43 every week or so. Another gun store in the area got an entire pallet of Glock 43s at the same time.

Let me know because Im going to throw one up on /r/gunsforsale on Thursday.  edit: I have 3 for sale now. One immediately (customer changed mind to the 42 instead of the 43) and two more on Thursday.

Glocks,3857xq,southernbenz,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:21:50 2015 UTC,"I found mine in a LGS showcase that had a waiting list of 40 folks.  I asked if it was really available for sale or a mistake.  The employee said he knew they had a long list but he'd ask.  Before he could, the manager walked by, was questioned, and said that one was meant for the case.  It was availble for sale.  I did not expect such luck becore going back overseas for another year.  I bought it, 350 rds through it so far.    Had several BTF w/ AE 124 gr and 2 of 100 FIOCCI 124s caused premature lockback of the slide--5 rounds left in mag.  So after 300 rds put a other 50 rds of Blazer brass and like a 100 i put tbrpugh previously it was flawless."

I asked the employee about them, and he said they were limited to 100 G43s per month due to the demand.  See if your LGS will let you put a deposit down to join their wait list for it.  Side note:  I held the one they had, it felt really good in the hand.  I'd probably get one if I ever wanted a single-stack."

Glocks,37z0u5,ClevelandReefer,2,Sun May 31 23:41:51 2015 UTC,That stuff is a special never-seize lube with copper to act as very fine sandpaper to aid in the breaking in process.

Glocks,37z0u5,pizzaazzip,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:51:14 2015 UTC,It will cause excessive wear if you continuously use it. It's meant just to be used for the first few hundred rounds. You shouldn't need if after that. You're right tho people should really leave it on there.

Glocks,37z47q,edb_ok,2,Sun May 31 20:38:56 2015 UTC,They do. I have a Raven for my Glock and TLR-1 and love the holster.  You can buy additional belt clips/loops for IWB and OWB

Glocks,380lg9,olcountry62,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:42:14 2015 UTC,Very interesting thank you. Would that have anything to do with the slide NOT locking to the rear after the magazine is empty?  Because that also happened to me once.
Glocks,380lg9,fuzzycaterpillar123,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:53:15 2015 UTC,extended mag release or extended slide stop?  sounds like its just your grip pushing up on whatever release you do have.

Glocks,380lg9,Engelmacher,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:25:37 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it could. I've not seen that problem first hand. Personally I like an extended mag release as long as it doesn't interfere with carrying (accidental magazine release) but the side stop isn't worth it for me. As for other people's Glocks that I've worked on, I usually use the spring from the factory slide stop on the extended on. INHO, any aftermarket part that doesn't function perfectly isn't worth it. I have a box of parts that didn't work for me. After building 4 Glocks for various purposes  (competition, show, and every day carry) the only not stock on my EDC is a back strap plug. I would however change the guide rod/spring change to a metal rod when the plastic stock one start to show any wear."

And I can only agree with this point. The capacity of the G42 and G43 are a shame man. My lc9s has a better trigger, weighs less, and is just as reliable. AND ITS CHEAPER!!! I am a Glock fanboy only bc they are inexpensive, reliable, and have amazing capacity. These slim frames are not as reliable, not, necessarily inexpensive compared to other firearms that are comparable, and do NOT have a good capacity. They are a shame."

Glocks,37ugse,f0rcedinducti0n,-4,Tue Jun 2 21:05:15 2015 UTC,I would be careful with a glock holster that isn't hard like kydex. If that mesh or cloth gets in your trigger while you're reholstering it could be dangerous.  Edit: Not sure why I'm being downvoted for telling someone to be careful when it comes to firearms. Reddit is a weird place.

I show my friend it who was not there earlier and told him about what had happened.   The indent was very clear and visible in the primer and he was saying how crazy that was because he has never seen a glock fail if properly maintained.   He laughed and threw the round back on the ground... and it fired. Since the round was not in a chamber it did not actually push the projectile, simply blew out the side of the cartridge. IDK what happened or how it happened, but I almost just had to lay a pair of pants to rest today because of it.   As for humidity, I use a dehumidifier for my room cause of all the electronics and the ammo/guns that are in my safe. But I have started purchasing ammo that has aluminum primers after today.

Glocks,37w4x3,volcanonacho,2,Sun May 31 22:28:21 2015 UTC,No problem. I carried it around with the plus 1 today and couldn't feel the extra length whatsoever. I have pretty average if not a little large sized hands and the plus one allows me to get my pinky half wayish on the grip now instead of it hanging free like it did before. I have absolutely no complaints with these things. Haven't been able to put any rounds through them so far but I couldn't imagine there being an issue with the plus one. I want to put a few hundred rounds through the plus 2 before I deem it reliable though because of the added length with a spring not designed for it.

Glocks,37m2wb,JakesGunReviews,4,Thu May 28 16:50:03 2015 UTC,The take-away from this for me is that Glock should have offered a factory +2 magazine. Sig Sauer does that in the P290RS.
Glocks,37m2wb,zaitcev,3,Thu May 28 18:25:21 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, the Glock 43 has a capacity of 6+1 of 9x19mm (with the finger rest magazine) whereas the PM has a capacity of 8+1 all in the same grip length.   It's not really all that surprising as it's really only a finger rest and doesn't affect the capacity of the magazine.  So for capacity purposes it's exactly the same as the flush mag.  You can get a Taran Tactical extension that adds an extra 2 rounds capacity to the Glock 43 mag that puts it at about the same length as the stock finger extension mag.  Which, in turn, puts it at about the same length and capacity as the PM."
Glocks,37m2wb,TheSkoomaCat,5,Thu May 28 18:12:47 2015 UTC,I was mostly trying to point out that the OEM finger rest magazine makes the grip as long as the PM without any additional rounds.

G43 ended up being the perfect one for her.  It's a very nice handgun, I will admit, but I do think Glock really drug their feet on getting it released.  I enjoy shooting it, as well, but am so familiar with my PM, that I'd rather not bother learning a new pistol that's the near-exact same size that would serve the same purpose as the one I already have.

Wore the finish off, refinished it with some pre-cerakote finish, started tinkering with the trigger and ended up upgrading to another firearm. Never had a problem with feeding, operation, or accuracy.   I might have to dig it out from the back of the safe for some love this weekend!"
Glocks,37m2wb,BendoverOR,1 point,Thu May 28 17:30:51 2015 UTC,I love my Glocks! But when I want to carry something bigger than .380 (MDE) and smaller than G26 - don't have a 43 yet - my go to is a Radom P-64 (1.35lb)

Glocks,37ndld,gripplechew,4,Thu May 28 22:56:03 2015 UTC,I haven't had any problems.
Glocks,37ndld,gripplechew,4,Thu May 28 23:55:55 2015 UTC,"the TFOs have mixed reviews, partly, I think because the front rod can pop out with the use of solvents in cleaning.  However, the TFXs feature hermetically encased sights and feature a white outline on the front sight for faster acquisition"
Glocks,37ndld,goguppy,4,Thu May 28 23:22:24 2015 UTC,Second this; I love the TFXs on my 19 and 27!
Glocks,37ndld,TameableExpertv2,2,Thu May 28 23:40:30 2015 UTC,Have these on my G17. Love the TruGlo's (I actually have the TruGlo TFO's night sights)

Glocks,37ndld,PUBERT_MCYEASTY,3,Fri May 29 00:58:29 2015 UTC,"another vote for truglo TFO here. I have a set on all four of my glocks. Just put them on my g43 and girlfriends g42 last week, already had them on my 17 and 19. Love the sights. Had them on my 17 for about 3 years now, no issues whatsoever. They pop like crazy in the daytime and are great at night."
Glocks,37ndld,PUBERT_MCYEASTY,2,Fri May 29 05:06:23 2015 UTC,"As many others have mentioned TruGlo TFO/TFX are great; they're what I have on my G19. I also highly recommend Trijicon HDs, especially on subcompacts. TFO/TFX are rather long, so the HDs will give you a little more sight radius."
Glocks,37ndld,ZaneMasterX,1 point,Fri May 29 16:35:14 2015 UTC,"That's what I think I decided to go for. For that reason and because I like the U shaped rear sight. Now I'm torn on color, I think the yellow would be easier to pick up but I like the contrast between the orange and green tritium. Any input?"
Glocks,37ndld,Not_Joshy,1 point,Fri May 29 21:49:25 2015 UTC,"I've personally only shot with the orange, but I've seen the green on guns in stores. I don't think either color would really give an advantage over the other in terms of picking up the front sight, but I believe the glow lasts longer on the green sights."

Glocks,37lgbf,bw11011,5,Thu May 28 14:10:54 2015 UTC,"Are you married to the idea of a compact?  Because it sounds like a G20 could be an excellent option for you.  Conversion barrels are readily available to use 9mm, .40S&W, .357 SIG, 38 Super, and 9x25.  With a new ejector, some mags, and a G21 slide, you could then use .45 and the conversions available for it such as .460 Rowland."
Glocks,37lgbf,FoxStang,3,Thu May 28 15:06:30 2015 UTC,This is what I was going to mention too. The G20 / G21 combination has the most options available for conversions.
Glocks,37lgbf,TameableExpertv2,2,Thu May 28 15:21:30 2015 UTC,"Technically, its just the 21. If I remember correctly, you can't put a 45 barrel in a g20 slide, but you can put a 10mm barrel in a 21 slide.  Still, if that is the case, the 21 has the most options, with the 20 having one less."
Glocks,37lgbf,igrulks,2,Thu May 28 17:48:24 2015 UTC,"LWD doesn't make all the same caliber conversions for the 20 and the 21. It's not suggested to use G20 barrels in a G21. They will function, but they are much more likely to malfunction."
Glocks,37lgbf,TameableExpertv2,2,Thu May 28 18:05:26 2015 UTC,"Can you please cite that? I'm surprised and a little skeptical to hear it, bc so many different manufacturers make a 10mm conv barrel for the 21."
Glocks,37lgbf,igrulks,4,Thu May 28 18:43:41 2015 UTC,"I just spoke with our Armorer about it before posting. I work at LWD. I'm not sure we have anything published on it. Basically, there's going to be more of a gap between the slide and barrel in a G21 using a G20 barrel, it'll work, but we don't suggest it due to reliability issues.   Edit: Here's a blog post describing why we don't offer .45ACP to 10mm conversions."
Glocks,37lgbf,TameableExpertv2,4,Thu May 28 19:21:23 2015 UTC,"I love the G21 since you can swap in a 10mm barrel.  Two great calibers.  I hate shooting .40, and I have plenty of 9mm.  So I went with a versatile .45/10mm pistol which shoots great."
Glocks,37lgbf,gizram84,2,Thu May 28 15:09:53 2015 UTC,"The frames for the 45/10mm are larger than those for the 9mm/40/357. So no, you cannot swap slides. Buy a G23 and get conversion barrels."
Glocks,37j3oq,PUBERT_MCYEASTY,11,Thu May 28 00:19:17 2015 UTC,The cheapest you will get it new is through the GSSF. A two-year GSSF membership ($60) grants you a voucher for a blue-label Glock. Blue label G19s generally cost $399-425 depending on the dealer. I recommend calling around to find the dealer with stock willing to give you the best price. G19 is the way to go; I love mine.
Glocks,37j3oq,PUBERT_MCYEASTY,5,Thu May 28 00:51:03 2015 UTC,I've read that you have to wait a year before you even get the voucher though?
Glocks,37j3oq,utvols98,8,Thu May 28 01:48:54 2015 UTC,"It only took mine as long as it took to ship, which was about 6 days. With a two-year membership, it comes with the welcome packet."

Glocks,37j3oq,PUBERT_MCYEASTY,2,Thu May 28 02:37:35 2015 UTC,"I looked around for the best price and just sent in my GSSF form the other day. Make sure you get the 2 year membership so you get the coupon right away. A gen 4 19 is $425 with the coupon. Search on Glock's website for a list of participating stores, there were only 2-3 within close distance to me."
Glocks,37j3oq,C-C-X-V-I,1 point,Thu May 28 03:20:54 2015 UTC,"Not every Glock dealer sells GSSF pistols, and the 19's are some of the hardest to find available through the program.   Call GSSF to find a dealer near you, blue label dealers don't necessarily sell through that program. You may need to specifically order a 19 once you find a dealer, too (and wait a while).   If it were me, I'd buy a 19 like a normal purchase and save the GSSF coupons for non-9 blue labels that the dealer probably has in stock."
Glocks,37j3oq,skypejake,1 point,Thu May 28 13:16:34 2015 UTC,GSSF   How much does it save on a 17/34?  Looking to get a glock for carry again and I might as well buy new if it can be this cheap.
Glocks,37j3oq,cthompson07,1 point,Sat May 30 05:29:29 2015 UTC,"A 17 is the same as a 19, but a blue label G34 is usually $75-100 more, I think."

Glocks,37j3oq,GlockCock80,8,Fri May 29 17:56:56 2015 UTC,I always prefer to buy local even if it's a little bit higher. Local gun shops are good to have around.
Glocks,37j3oq,dildonitron,3,Thu May 28 01:34:59 2015 UTC,Can't agree with this any more. Even in a commy state support your local shops. Guns or golf... or anything!
Glocks,37j3oq,Laplante86,2,Thu May 28 03:28:49 2015 UTC,Too bad you don't live near Chattanooga. A couple weeks ago the gun range that I am a member of was selling Glocks with no tax and 10% off for all range members.
Glocks,37j3oq,C-C-X-V-I,4,Fri May 29 03:16:13 2015 UTC,Not really. The marketplace is global now. I have no need for a price gouging local jerkoff store. I go where the price is right. Period. To do otherwise indicates some sort of delusional loyalty to a store who will think nothing of taking advantage of that delusion. The market works best when you stop acting silly and go where the price is right.
Glocks,37j3oq,JabbaTheWhat01,4,Thu May 28 02:24:14 2015 UTC,My local gunshop jerked me sideways and told me to like it because those online stores don't let you cop a feel on some steel.   They really rubbed me the wrong way so I decided to stick to Armslist and Gunbroker. That and the whole sales tax thing.   I think it might be a generational thing though.
Glocks,37j3oq,GlockCock80,3,Thu May 28 07:16:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying buy everything local, but if there's less then a 10% price difference I'll buy it local because you do get to actually hold what you're buying. I don't know about your LGS but the guys who work at mine are all very friendly and really know their shit. Also my store does a lot around the community when it comes sponsoring local events, they really try promote a positive gun attitude, and in California we could really use more of that."

Remember online dealers will have to ship to an FFL, which will need to be factored into the overall price.  I do like to have the store I buy from in driving distance in case I have any issues I can drop back in. That's just me though.  You will be happy with a 19. It's a great handgun and 9mm is cheap(er)"

Glocks,37guv6,Engelmacher,1 point,Thu May 28 01:42:36 2015 UTC,Any reason for running the 147's? I thought about running heavier projectiles to get my powder cost down.

Glocks,37guv6,Engelmacher,2,Wed May 27 16:14:51 2015 UTC,"147s with fast powder have less ""snap"" and for some people, easier to track the front sight. Also apparently helps knock down steel poppers.  Federal are some of the softest to ignite primers and I use a 2lbs striker spring and a lightened zev striker. Helps get a lighter trigger pull but with complete reliability when lighting off rounds. (So far, 15k rounds)"
Glocks,37guv6,Engelmacher,1 point,Wed May 27 16:19:31 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, that's interesting. I was not aware of that! I seem to have a problem after about my 3rd-4th shot of keeping my front sight in focus. My glock is pretty much stock aside from a 3.5lb trigger. Would the Zev striker be a good investment for me even if I don't end up running the 147s?"
Glocks,37guv6,Engelmacher,2,Wed May 27 16:21:27 2015 UTC,"The primers have little to do with the bullet weight. If you really start trying to drop your trigger pull weight, then maybe look into it. But the striker is $80 alone and won't do much for you without supporting upgrades and tweaks.  Try a 13lbs recoil spring if you want a cheap upgrade with a good cost to performance ratio. Helps prevent muzzle dip as the slide slams back into battery and will help you track your sight easier as well."

Glocks,37guv6,SilverStryfe,2,Wed May 27 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"I started using heavier bullets because power is scarce and you use less of it to meet power factor. As a side benefit it appears to have less muzzle-flip. I believe. So, yes, ready to test heavier than that. They don't care which weight bullets you use, but it does have to meet power factor and they do test at the upper level matches. Bullet weight x velocity / 1000 must >= 124. My recent loads appear to put me around 131.   For mags, signs would be issues with the follower or if you hear any noises loading and unloading. Just see how they push up when you strip a round off the top. Besides that? Easiest thing is to compare to other known working mags. And if you don't have many other mags anyway...time to get some, they aren't expensive. They are easy to refurbish too if you want a new follower and spring.   I'm all self taught too man, cheers!"

Two buddies of mine had the green ones and had nothing but issues. Not sure if it's an isolated event, but it solidified my choice in the other brand."
Glocks,37guv6,Pooping_brewer,2,Wed May 27 21:42:00 2015 UTC,"Once you get a chrono, buy some 50x sample packs of 124 135 147gr bullets and load up some ladder in .2gr increments until you 130 ish power factor and see which ones shoot best for you. Then you can tune up or down .1gr if you feel inclined. But yeah, try to experiment with a bunch of different bullet weights as well as recoil springs. I really like the ISMI flat recoil springs."

I've bought about 15 from him so far because he does such good work. I checked his eBay store and he has another one listed like mine. His brand is ""Chief's Holsters"" I believe.

Glocks,37epyr,jackets17,1 point,Wed May 27 11:42:08 2015 UTC,How good would you say it is compared to an alien gear cloak 2.0?
Glocks,37epyr,jackets17,1 point,Wed May 27 20:15:23 2015 UTC,"I couldn't tell you first hand.  I've been using his holsters for several years now.  I've literally bought 15 or more from him.  Based on what I've seen from others that have used both, his are ""better"" but the AG are more finished.  I guess that's a result of mass production on a line vs. a guy that hand makes all of his holsters.  The ""better"" that I've seen ranged from more secure, more comfortable, & safer.  Secure was molding, comfortable is just that, & safer was someone who had a problem with AG cutting the trigger guard too short?  Personally, I can't attest to any of that so that's only what I've heard on the positives & negatives over the last 6 months or so.  I call him up, tell him what I want, and then run by his house to get it whenever it's ready.  I don't know what would make me use another holster but I haven't found it yet.  I prefer his over Crossbreed, Galco, a few other smaller custom makers, and my own holsters (obviously I no longer make any).  edit actually I forgot I do use a Desantis pocket holster just because I had it before he started making pocket holsters and he told me he couldn't really improve upon it how I wanted (I wanted something slightly thinner)."
Glocks,37epyr,jackets17,2,Wed May 27 21:13:31 2015 UTC,Have you had any issues with that single belt clip and how well does it draw with it being off center? I've used alien gear for most of my carry guns but was looking for something a little less bulky for my 43
Glocks,37epyr,Sloppy_Twat,1 point,Wed May 27 21:34:52 2015 UTC,Draw is great.  The only problem I've had with it was when I tried to change it over to one of my velcro-clips that I like to use for work.  The velcro combined with a single clip introduced too much play and the butt could drop enough to make reholstering problematic & gave me some concerns about getting a good full-gripped draw.  As it comes from him it works great though.
Glocks,37epyr,mavrk22,1 point,Wed May 27 22:05:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. Probably gonna order one and give it a shot.
Glocks,37epyr,776,5,Wed May 27 22:23:29 2015 UTC,"Couple more pics: http://imgur.com/a/LILim  Some buddies and I went up to VA for the weekend for a boy's weekend. Lots of shooting, grilling, smoking, & drinking (after the guns were clean & secured of course). I took my new 43 up there and I have to say that I'm extremely happy.  First, my 43 was one of the ones with a ~8lb. trigger pull. I looked at Ghost connectors to get the trigger pull close to my 19 my other ccw). I ended up buying a Ghost Edge connector to drop the pull weight to about 5 lbs with a very nice reset. I also put sights on all carry guns and since my go-to sights weren't available yet (Warren Tactical, I decided I would try out some Trijicon HDs.   Everything was a raging success. Lots of Glocks, some Sigs, Berettas, Taurus, S&W, etc. and the 43 was the most popular pistol there. Everyone loved it. We shot steel and paper at 10-30 yards and it is one sweet shooter. I shoot for speed and accuracy rather than group sizes but running drills with it was very easy and everyone was knocking steel & bowling pins over at 15-20 yards with ease. We ran a total of 300-350 rounds (Gold Dots, Blazer, Freedom Munitions, & some Federal) through it with 0 failures.  It's not the perfect carry gun but it's the closest I've found so far. I wish they had squeezed 1 more round into the mag and it had the standard Glock trigger feel. Otherwise, I love it. I paid less for my Shield but it really needs an Apex trigger to get it to match the 43's new $20 Ghost connector. That negates a bit of it's price advantage. The XDS didn't mesh well with me but I would have had to put a Powder River Precision trigger in it to be completely satisfied which prices it way over the 43 & Shield set up the way I like them. So, the 43 isn't for everyone but it's definitely for me. Based on the reports from 3 of the guys that they were going home to order one, I guess it's for them too."

Used white nail polish and non acetone remover.  Got both for under $4.  The only thing i don't like is that the nail polish left spots on the magazines where the excess was.  I'd rub harder but when I do that the fill comes out.  I'll also say this as a tip to anyone else doing this.  Go light on the nail polish and wipe it off before it hardens all the way.  That's when I got the best results was with a lighter coat and wiping it off after 5 minutes or so (times may vary).  Also, it did feel kinda weird at first putting nail polish on my gun.  Probably since I'm more of a plain-JaneJoe kinda guy when it comes to my guns.  But the results are worth the momentary mental discomfort."

Glocks,37aoiz,RANDY_MAR5H,1 point,Tue May 26 11:51:45 2015 UTC,Any ideas what could cause that?  I've never disassembled it beyond field stripping.
Glocks,37aoiz,RANDY_MAR5H,2,Tue May 26 16:04:30 2015 UTC,Usually something in the trigger assembly. You could take it to somebody to look at it.   But to clarify are you saying that the reset is just not there or its there sometimes?
Glocks,37aoiz,Syndicate1911,2,Tue May 26 16:10:20 2015 UTC,"Just sometimes, majority of the time it is there."
Glocks,37aoiz,Engelmacher,1 point,Tue May 26 16:23:43 2015 UTC,I had a similar problem when I took my 19 completely apart the first time. I added a few drops of Frog Lube between the trigger bar and the connector and everything was right in the World again!!
Glocks,37aoiz,ego-trippin,4,Thu May 28 20:19:29 2015 UTC,"This is usually caused by the connector being bent too close to 90 degrees, or rounding of the top part on the trigger bar nose. Put sandpaper on a flat glass or granite surface and re-square the nose, and or bend the connector away from the trigger housing a little more."

Glocks,379up5,zaitcev,3,Tue May 26 03:20:44 2015 UTC,"Story time!  I was shooting some targets this evening and had probably done about fifty rounds when the steady rhythm was interrupted.  It essentially goes boom boom boom boom boomfff and I'm thinking ""Huh.  I've never had a jam in this gun before....that really didn't feel like a jam at all"" and I look and the right side and the top pin is sticking out about a half a centimeter.  I try to load another round and it lodges itself in the same spot.  I field stripped the thing and the only observation I had was the barrel was looking a bit off and there was what appeared to be shaved up brass all over.  I pack up go home and try the brush and out comes the casing with the bottom blown out.  I have no idea what happened but I'm a bit concerned to shoot it again.  Here is another angle."
Glocks,379up5,Zearkos,4,Tue May 26 04:03:48 2015 UTC,"I would not be too concerned. This is called ""case separation"" and if you survived, your gun survived, it's probably all good. Of course there's always a possibility that some kind of microscopic crack hid itself in barrel, slide, or rails, and is waiting for its chance to kill you, but most likely not.  If you're concerned with the protrusion of the safety disconnector, visit a gun shop, show it to them, and talk them into stripping one of the used guns for comparison. Indeed normally it only moves horizontally, back and forth, and pushes a round-ish bottom of the firing pin block. So its protrusion should not change with the blow. You're probably seeing things. But make sure all the same.  P.S. Enter ""case separation"" into image search at Google/Bing/Yandex, you'll see dozens of pics just like yours. Hope it helps."
Glocks,379up5,buddyspiked,2,Tue May 26 16:51:06 2015 UTC,Yeah that is what I did with the google image search thing.  I cleaned it last night and fired six rounds through it this morning.  I think all is well.

Very fast to draw with good ""clicky"" retention and the front sight channel is nice and tall and will easily accommodate tall fiber optic sights without snagging.

If your just doing this to improve yourself and not compete in a serious way then I imagine you wont see a bunch of sticklers for the rules. I recently stopped shooting with my G34 and went to my G19 in my local matches. They let me shoot it exactly how its setup. No worries about the light or the sights or anything. Its what I carry and what I should be training with. So they are very accepting.   Once you get into more serious matches and championships then sure I can image they will get pretty serious. But in my experience, it was very relaxed and alot of fun."

Glocks,375p1z,Gatorgrad96,3,Mon May 25 02:35:11 2015 UTC,Look at the way you hold the gun. Maybe your thumb was pushing up on the slide release lever when the recoil hit.  I had a range session with my G19 where I was an idiot and kept having slide lock back. Changed my grip and got my thumb off the frame and it didn't happen again.  It's always weird little things like that for me.
Glocks,375p1z,Doctah_Feelgood,1 point,Mon May 25 14:54:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion, but it wasn't the thumb.  I was careful to avoid that since owning the G42.  The thumb was well clear.  I was gripping it the same as I had on the previous 200+ rounds of other ammunition. Tonight I looked into the G43 while the slide was back and loaded a mag.  I saw the bullet contact the tab on the slide release lever.  I may try filing it a little like many did with the G42.  Otherwise, when I return from overseas next year, I'll send it to Glock if it continues."

Considering the accuracy I'm getting with the heavier trigger, it would be difficult to argue that I modified the weapon to improve my accuracy.    I've only swapped out the connector on one of my Glocks and I'm considering putting the original back in.  Even though it averages 4.5 lbs, it feels too light when shooting."

Glocks,36y9hg,zaitcev,0,Sat May 23 13:01:34 2015 UTC,"In addition to practical advice edraven88g and others provided, the theory of limp-wristing is that the gun not just recoils back, but mostly pivots. If the pivoting motion is too fast, the slide cannot slide against the frame. Counteracting that pivoting is what the torquing advice is about.  Note that some guns have grips wide enough that if the small-handed shooter pivots like so, the dovel starts resting on the joint at the base of the thumb and that's going to hurt. Don't let her go that far. Better make the support hand pivot more. It may look that she's gripping the butt of the gun with the support hand eventually."

Have her work on her grip fundamentals especially locking her wrist and getting as high up on the grip as possible. She will get less muzzle flip, the higher her hands are in relation to the bore axis. Good stance with a slight forward lean, thumbs forward with wrist locked, and stay as high in the grip as she can.   Also consider doing it with a .22, a .380, or a heavier 9mm to mitigate the recoil while she learns. Sorry for the wall of text."

The paradox is most notably recorded by Plutarch in Life of Theseus from the late first century. Plutarch asked whether a ship which was restored by replacing each and every one of its wooden parts remained the same ship.  The paradox had been discussed by more ancient philosophers such as Heraclitus, Socrates, and Plato prior to Plutarch's writings; and more recently by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Several variants are known, notably ""grandfather's axe"". This thought experiment is ""a model for the philosophers""; some say, ""it remained the same,"" some saying, ""it did not remain the same"".

After careful consideration, I found i side neither with those that said, ""it remained the same,"" nor those that said, ""it did not remain the same.""

I also figure that if the who's-who of philosophy haven't come up with a good answer then I'm unlikely to do much better. I do have a thought on the matter, which relies on something the older philosophers won't have known about - on average, every molecule in your body is replaced in about 7 years. That means that after a few sets of 7 years, all of your starting molecules have been replaced, but we still consider ourselves to be ourselves - not a fresh person, so I fall into the ""it's the ship, not its components"" camp. For the ship, there's never a point where ""the ship"" doesn't exist, and so I call that the limit.  I know that there's at least one Ferrari out there that's been rebuilt after a crash starting with just the little plate with the VIN, and rebuilding the rest of the car around it - for me (and the who who I used to work with that owned and crashed it) that Ferrari ceased to exist in the crash, but it seems that someone considered the little plate to be ""the car"", and so the concept extended that far for them."

I also had problems with some low cut jeans, the holster is basically directly in front of your junk which is very uncomfortable when sitting.   Friend of mine uses one of the 4 and one of the 3 hole clips to kant the gun a bit which fixes the problem with the grip.   Mojos are nice looking, unfortunately no one sees them when you carry.

From what I have read, this can and does effect barrel consistency in how it locks up from shot to shot. And some guy makes a match grade one that is thicker with a deeper and narrower channel that is supposed to aid in consistent barrel lock up. But they are $30 +$8 shipping. Seems to have good reviews on all the forums but that's a good bit of cash for a small part that might not even be my problem.  That's a good question on the barrel life. I'll have to research that a bit more. The numbers might be a bit off since I shoot 147gr plated bullets at 130PF so that's a bit slower than most factory ammo."

The first is that much like a thigh rig, it needs to be dead tight to the mounting surface to not bounce around. Secondly, to be quickly drawn, it needs to be at an angle that violates the 2nd rule of gun safety.

Glocks,36sbfj,MoreFlyThanYou,1 point,Thu May 21 19:16:08 2015 UTC,Does he like them?  That short sight radius makes the stock sights a bitch.
Glocks,36sbfj,tincankilla,3,Fri May 22 06:42:31 2015 UTC,"They are wonderful for hitting center mass. They are combat sights. You can aquire much quicker after adapting to the new sight picture. And if you line it up like an i you will always hit center mass at any sort of real combat distance (3-7 yds); they are great even up to 15 and past if you take your time. The big problem I had with them is that, when I was target shooting and trying to be particularly accurate with my groups, I found it hard to get the point of impact consistent; even with what seemed like the same sight picture and sight alignment. I switched back to three dot night sights and would probably put the XS on a different glock in the future; maybe the nightstand gun. If it fits your needs they are great and I highly recommend them."
Glocks,36sbfj,judsonm123,1 point,Fri May 22 15:13:16 2015 UTC,"The point of impact issue is exactly the problem I have, and I think it's the crude sights on the glock.  I have a laser and can shoot a tighter group with that at my hip than I can with the stock sights."

I'm in the wrong sub to recommend it, but frankly, I love my Beretta. While it's too big for concealed carry, and I am not at all a fan of the slide safety, I love shooting the thing. It fits very comfortably in my hands, has very modest recoil, and I shoot it well. The double action isn't bad (on mine, at least), and the single action is actually quite good.  Try one out. If it isn't comfortable and you really want the .357, get the Glock. If it feels as good as mine feels to me, and you like shooting cheap ammo all day, get the Beretta."

They are a great gun with a strong proven track record, you can not go wrong with one. Why did I become a Glock convert? After working with Glocks for a while: 1) The double/single action on the first trigger pull sucks! 2) The external safety on the M9 tears up my hand during tap, rack, bang drills. 3) M9 is too damn heavy. 4) Glock magazines are > *. 5) Break down and cleaning is much better on the Glocks, however this is minimal.  As for the semi-auto pistol .357, aka Glock 33, it is a bad attempt to try to replicate the infamous .357 magnum. Harder to find and more expensive. Choose a more readily available proven caliber Glock like a 9mm or .45.  So to answer you question, Neither. Get a Glock, 17/19/23/26/27/30s.

Glocks,36jnb2,GonnaFapToThis,3,Wed May 20 02:09:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have the same for my 23 and it works fine.  It's not a huge difference, but enough that Glock decided to change the geometry.  I've seen posts where guys carry conversion barrels for defense and they go so far as to change the trigger housing with a 9mm ejector, I don't know if it makes a difference but it's a cheap enough part for peace of mind."
Glocks,36jnb2,Sit-Rep,7,Wed May 20 02:56:47 2015 UTC,because of the size of the gun/slide/receiver.

Glocks,36kjj0,RawlingsRx,2,Wed May 20 01:39:40 2015 UTC,"My advice is it depends.   Two friends own 19's.   One doesn't carry often cause he prints like a motherfucker.  He wears skinny jeans and tight t-shirts. I know when he does carry cause he's wearing an untucked button shirt, sweater, jacket etc.  From what you wrote you may have a similar problems. A carry permit and gun does dick if you never carry.   The other, like myself, wears slightly baggy jeans and t-shirts. He carries most of the time since he only prints mildly.   I on the other hand went with the 26 and carry all day, everyday. They both had buyers remorse after they holstered my 26 and are now both saving for one.   But I planned on buying two 9mm's, the 26 and the 17 or 34 for CC from the beginning. But then again when I'm not at work I don't give a shit about printing at all.   I think if you plan on buying two anytime close together getting a full and sub-compact makes the most sense. If you're only gonna get one the 19 is the great middle road.   If you plan on CC you also need to decide if you wanna dress around your gun, if you want a gun that fits your current fashion, or if you just don't give a fuck.   My state allows open carry and has no laws against printing. Yours may differ."
Glocks,36kjj0,jerry_rigger,2,Wed May 20 03:25:25 2015 UTC,I agree. 26 and 17/34.

Honestly, i dont really give a fuck. Just want to put some different sites and maybe a trigger mod. This is my first handgun to get my feet wet.

Glocks,36kjj0,jerry_rigger,1 point,Wed May 20 03:57:43 2015 UTC,Printing is when you can see outlines of your pistol under your clothing.  Most people don't notice it unless its extreme. My friends worry about printing too much IMO.  But then again my relaxed fit clothing style lends itself to concealing larger handguns.  Since you wear shorts a lot look at IWB (in waist band) holsters and belly bands.   Check out /r/ccw for other holster recommendations.  They also have links to laws by state.
Glocks,36kjj0,rtf2-mike,2,Wed May 20 04:12:29 2015 UTC,Extremely helpful thankyou will check it out right now
Glocks,36kjj0,Soulfader72,1 point,Wed May 20 04:28:51 2015 UTC,"The g19 is a fantastic choice. I carry mine in a kydex iwb appendix holster. I am a hair under 6 feet tall and weight about 155 pounds with a 33 inch waist. It prints if I am wearing a thin, short snug T-shirt like a hannes undershirt. Any type of button up shirt or a thicker more loose fitting T-shirt or polo shirt it disappears. As far as upgrades, I would first go with a basic set of 3 dot night sights like ameriglo or trijicon hd's to aid you in front sight acquisition in low light situations. Then a good TAC light. The stock trigger will be good for you to put your first 500-1000 rounds on. I would not change anything functional until you completely understand the function of your firearm and are proficient and confident. Beyond that have fun trying out all the backplates, magazine configurations, color filling and what not!"
Glocks,36kjj0,ViralOner,1 point,Wed May 20 05:47:11 2015 UTC,"You can't ever go wrong with a 19. It's a good starting point and then go from there. I use mine more for home defense and range shooting. For ccw I use a 26. As far as holsters I use a Galco stow and go IWB, but that's just my personal preference.  Accessories, I really recommend a precision extended slide lock (make sure it's machined and not stamped, I got mine from the glockstore)"
Glocks,36kjj0,ViralOner,1 point,Wed May 20 18:25:20 2015 UTC,"Grab the 19. Then mosey on down to Wal-Mart for some white box or brownells.com for some Rem UMC 115gr ammo. I got 500 rounds for $97 plus 2 extra mags for about $25 each. As far as holsters... Grab an uncle Mike's owb for $15th for the range and ccw classes and start with an Alien or Old Faithful for IWB. CAUTION: you will end up with a box full of holsters until you find the perfect fit for your liking. You also need to jump on Amazon and get a Frog Lube kit and a pack of cleaning patches. Extra points if you get a Glock brand Glock bench mat, some snap caps and the Magpul ""Art of the Gunfighter"" dvd. That was my path... Hope this helps!"

Glocks,36ku3n,My_wifes_husband,2,Wed May 20 03:05:46 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHY-YAS7Rcc  You can take a stone to the cruciform/sear, and make sure it is very flat on the face and the top edge. Polish that and the striker, as well as the $.25 trigger job stuff. Round the edge of your safety plunger so the trigger bar nub engages it more smoothly. [I highly advise against Ti safety plunger btw, after a while, the striker will peen the edge of the plunger and eventually work its way through, bypassing that safety feature.]  Try a Zev 2lbs connector. Thin out the trigger bar nose width, so excess lateral pressure on it from the connector, into the frame isn't as great. Polish the inside of the frame where the trigger bar makes contact and polish the trigger housing where it makes contact with the trigger bar as well. Round off any sharp or jagged edges that form in the guide channels of the trigger housing where the trigger bar ""wings"" are located.  Check the engagement of the cruciform/sear. If you have OVER 100% engagement, you can adjust that with several ways. Glock says you need at least 3/4ths engagement or better. I usually go with 100% engagement. You can reprofile the cruciform/sear to mate just shy of parallel with the striker lug. You still need the top to be angled further back than the bottom edge of the sear though.  Theres a few other more advanced mods and tweaks you can do to bring it down even further."

Glocks,36ku3n,MrSpaceFlunky,2,Wed May 20 05:57:32 2015 UTC,"Get a hold of Dan over at DK Custom Triggers. His kit has my 2 competition Glocks pulling at about 2.5#'s with very little take up and over travel. It almost feels like a single action trigger. He uses all the factory parts and mods them.   Or if you want to do it yourself. I had a sub 3# pull by using Zev's spring kit. Which includes the striker, plunger and trigger spring. Also used their V4 connector. If you use lighter springs tho, you will experience light primer strikes with any primer BUT Federals. So I would suggest using an extended and lightened striker to help ignite harder primers. In conjunction with that you should polish up the contact points in the trigger group to smooth out the pull and lower it's weight a bit. All of this is done without removing any material from the trigger parts. Its just a polish job.   Now if you REALLY want to go all the way follow these instructions This will have you using polishing stones to slightly remove some material and reshape some of the trigger parts."

Glocks,36820m,Zerv14,4,Sun May 17 01:53:11 2015 UTC,"I don't envy those restrictions, but I am envious of the Austrian proof marks on your 100% made in Austria Glock. You don't see that very often in the States. Our Glocks are generally assembled in the US with Austrian and US made parts so no Austrian proof marks for us."
Glocks,36820m,myfaceit,1 point,Sun May 17 04:49:12 2015 UTC,"Move to California :p due to how our handgun roster works, we only get Austrian made Glocks. A change in manufacturing location = 100% new pistol; needs LCI, mag disconnect, and microstamping in the eyes of California's DOJ. So Glocks sold in CA dealers can only come from Austria.  That being said, I think many gen3's on the market are from Austria? It is the gen4s where the USA manuf started taking off."

Glocks,367e8s,stDemigod,2,Sat May 16 21:59:01 2015 UTC,http://modernserviceweapons.com/?p=5130  Time yourself and see. Most people who practice can actually reload faster normally than they can do a NY reload.   The NY reload is an old and obsolete technique from the days of revolvers. Causes more problems than it solves.
Glocks,367e8s,rainy0days,1 point,Sun May 17 17:23:25 2015 UTC,That is simply not true. The french GIGN trains with 2 Glocks and the New York reload.   http://i.imgur.com/s9TNWZN.jpg  It is way faster if you cut the excess movement. A lot of videos were people demonstrate the New York reload they hesitate to drop their pistol or throw it instead of dropping it in the same motion they grab the new gun.  There is an intuitive resistance to drop your gun and this is exactly why most New York reloads are slower. As soon as you got over it its faster.
Glocks,367e8s,gripplechew,1 point,Tue May 19 12:21:45 2015 UTC,"Hypothetically even if someone was faster with a NY reload than they were reloading normally(which I personally don't believe), it still doesn't change the fact that strategically it makes zero sense to do so.

I had this issue when I first bought my G19 because I was pressing on the slide stop with my support hand without realizing it. Fixed my grip and the problem disappeared.  If it's not grip, then it's likely a bad slide stop spring which can be replaced easily."

Glocks,368bv3,slalomz,3,Sun May 17 04:10:18 2015 UTC,Those same surfaces will polish themselves with lots of dry fire... polishing them on a new gun can skip right ahead to that well worn-in trigger feel.  I didn't bother on my Glocks.

The question then becomes whether it's worth the time - my answer is that it'll produce a change, and it won't be an unpleasant change, but it's the sort of thing that's only worth doing if you can't keep your hands still and have to be fiddling with something so it may as well be something productive."

Glocks,364zb7,oGKevin,6,Sat May 16 04:50:50 2015 UTC,Not only. The paint is also photoluminescent. And glows bright as shit if you give it a few seconds with a light. I don't know when you're supposed to do that in a heat of the moment scenario but it does it none the less.
Glocks,364zb7,Mr-Good,3,Sat May 16 12:09:15 2015 UTC,"I have a friend and family member that are police officers that have HD's on there duty weapons, and from what they say the paint on the front sight helps when they already have their guns drawn in pursuit and have to go from outside in the daytime to inside maybe a dim light warehouse or ally or something.  They also like how much more it pops out them just the white dot."

Glocks,364zb7,Mr-Good,4,Sat May 16 04:52:47 2015 UTC,HD is the only option imo. All my handguns have them with the orange dot. Like the other guy said there's a big bright orange ring around a green tritium dot. The orange paint is photoluminescant but the biggest selling point is that they're so so much better to acquire your target. It's crazy how much easier and faster it is over the 3 white dots. Also the Trijicon 3 dots suck. I have two pairs of them from before my HDs and the paint is either yellow or half flaked off on each circle. The orange paint on the HDs front is much stronger and there's no paint to look shitty on the rear.
Glocks,364zb7,edb_ok,2,Sat May 16 12:07:39 2015 UTC,Same here. All my handguns have the Orange HD's on them and I love them.

In sunlight, the orange dot is awesome and the rear sights are black making a hell of a contrast.  In low light, the front sight is dull and the contrast is gone, but that's true of any sight system.  In dark, the tritium kicks in and you see the soft green glow of the three tritium cells.  I believe the Trijicon HDs are the best system on the market for all lighting conditions.  They are expensive, but worth it if you want to have it all."

My wife was in Maryland for a few days with our kids and i took a taxi home from the bar. No vehicles in the driveway. Heard the window in my kitchen break. I grabbed my nightstand weapon, a glock 17, and ran downstairs. He was going through or medicine cupboard when i got down there. He had a pistol in his hand. Thank God he dropped it immediately before he slowly turned around. He had one second or i would have squeezed off a round. I held him at gun point until police arrived. Turned out to be my neighbors 15 year old son with his daddies gun looking for some pills."

Glocks,364l1u,coffeeguy89,5,Sat May 16 02:09:38 2015 UTC,"If you're using it as a defensive gun, I strongly recommend against aftermarket connectors and trigger parts. There's been more than one case of a Ghost connector causing a gun to go full auto or fail to fire at all.   The recipe I tend to use is an OEM minus connector, gen 3 G17 trigger bar, all stock springs, and a light polish with Flitz or Mothers. However from what it sounds like you want, this may not be for you. If you want the perception of a cleaner break, I'd use that same recipe but switch out the minus connector for a dot connector and maybe extra power springs if that still isn't enough for you.     Basically just try to stick to OEM parts, resist the urge to get reduced power springs, and just mix and match to you find something you like."
Glocks,364l1u,rainy0days,2,Sat May 16 04:53:46 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from. I purchased the Ghost Rocket kit as suggested by tigertrash since it's relatively cheap and its pretty well reviewed. As for now I'll just do the ever famous ""$0.25 trigger job"" and play around with the parts from the Ghost kit. Right now my G23 is just a range toy but somewhere down the line it might become a concealed carry, in which case I'll probably bring it back to all OEM parts."
Glocks,364l1u,WindowShoppingMyLife,1 point,Sat May 16 13:00:45 2015 UTC,"The only thing that makes a glock go full auto is if you file too much off of the trigger bar cruciform. Usually that happens when people try to polish it and they go overboard with a dremel.   Ghost connectors are not much different from the factory connectors. Both are perfectly safe if they are installed correctly.   That said, in my experience trigger jobs on a glock are a waste of time for the vast majority of shooters. They make the trigger feel a little different, but it doesn't tend to make any difference when shooting. The best way to improve your glock's trigger is to do more dry fire."
Glocks,364l1u,rainy0days,1 point,Sat May 16 16:46:15 2015 UTC,"If you know the way a Glock trigger works, you know that Ghost(as well as most aftermarket connectors that require fitting) gets the feel they do by reducing the amount of contact area between the cruciform and striker lug. Most of the popular Ghost connectors require fitting, which I honestly believe the vast majority of people can not do competently. I consider this unsafe, unreliable, and a liability in pretty much any other way you can imagine. It's too much to sacrifice for a ""crisp"" trigger.  I semi agree with you about trigger jobs. Most trigger jobs that chase that 1911 feel are a waste of time. That said, everyone has preferences. My preference is with the previously mentioned recipe, and it gives me a smooth trigger with a usable weight. Some people like stiffer triggers, some like clickier resets. My times are faster, my groups are tighter, and I'm more consistent with the setup that I prefer. I can still shoot fine with a stock Glock, but my results are objectively better with my subtle modifications. All with OEM parts.   Competition/range guns are a different story though. Those get the full retard 2.5 lb trigger jobs that I'd never put on a gun I carry."
Glocks,364l1u,WindowShoppingMyLife,1 point,Sat May 16 17:28:37 2015 UTC,"If you know the way a Glock trigger works, you know that Ghost(as well as most aftermarket connectors that require fitting) gets the feel they do by reducing the amount of contact area between the cruciform and striker lug.   I think you are mistaken. What you are fre getting to is referred to as ""engagement,"" and it has nothing to do with the trigger connector. It has to do with the trigger bar (the ""cruciform"" just means the back of the trigger bar) and the firing pin lug only. Changing the connector, whether with an OEM or aftermarket part, will not affect the engagement area.   The trigger connector is the part that forces the trigger bar down, thus disengaging the firing pin lug, at the end of the trigger pull. The angle of the connector only affects the angle at which it does so, not the amount of travel required.   Many of the ghost connectors are basically the same as the OEM ones, just polished and with ""debris holes."" They work just like the OEM parts, and don't require fitting. Any idiot (myself included) can install one.   The other ones are the same thing but they add an over travel tab. That's the only thing that requires fitting. If you don't file it down enough then the trigger won't go back far enough to fire. If that happens you file it down some more and test it again. You repeat the process until the tab is small enough to let the trigger release, but not jerk to the rear afterwards. So long as you can dry fire the gun, you're good.   TL;DR  You can't make it go full auto by messing with the connectors, whether OEM or aftermarket."

Also, what would you consider a good holster? I have been testing out my dad's Alien Gear with his G42 and I feel those are very comfortable and keeps from printing much. Would they be a good choice as a holster for the G19 as well?"
Glocks,360er1,GlockCock80,-2,Fri May 15 01:25:25 2015 UTC,"AG is cool and inexpensive but they have an issue where they don't always cover the trigger area 100% (one of the few jobs a holster has). Best overall IWB holster is the Stealthgear Onyx in my opinion but it is $100. Also, check out the NSR Tactical LLC-4 (full guard). If you're like everyone else you will eventually have a drawer full of holsters though. Also, get a good belt. I recommend SOE Gear EDC belt and/or Galco SB2 leather belt.

Glocks,360er1,southernbenz,12,Sat May 16 04:10:14 2015 UTC,"It's good as long as you are. People with little to no experience carrying tend to think of the 19/23 as being too big for carry because the grip will (GASP) make a print here and there. It's totally understandable though, people have different levels of comfort and tend to become more comfortable as time goes on. So, answer is yes it's fine but you may be better off with a smaller gun at first so you actually carry. But, after carrying a smaller gun for a while (which will also print if you move just right) you will likely realize that the grip of a gun pretty much resembles an iPhone on your belt and you will print a little bit no matter what gun you carry. Oh, and no one is looking anyway. Now, you don't want to bend over 90 degrees and jump all over but that's for any gun being carried. But for typical daily walking around etc. it's fine. But please don't feel pressured to carry anything you aren't comfortable with. Start small and go from there if you have to."
Glocks,360er1,AHappyMeal,3,Fri May 15 01:12:50 2015 UTC,I appreciate the comment. I was just worried it may either be A) uncomfortable to carry or B) it is basically showing at all times.  But what you said sounds good and makes me worry less.  Thanks!
Glocks,360er1,southernbenz,4,Fri May 15 01:22:36 2015 UTC,"A) uncomfortable to carry   Have you ever moved any large furniture before?  A refrigerator?  Washing machine?  It sure helps when you have the right equipment to move it- like an appliance dolly, right?    Same thing.  You need a gun belt.  A regular leather belt will not work properly.  You need a belt that's made for carrying a firearm.  You need a quality holster that both supports weight and secures your firearm so it won't fall out every time you sit down.  Once you have those in place, you would be amazed at the size of gun you can comfortably carry.     B) it is basically showing at all times.   Well, now that does depend on a couple more factors.  Clothing is one of those factors, and the other factor is body type.  Not surprisingly, those tend to go together when discussing concealability."
Glocks,360er1,GlockCock80,2,Fri May 15 02:43:09 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Someone else recommended me some belts and holsters. Are there any you would recommend?
Glocks,360er1,Killimansorrow,1 point,Fri May 15 04:59:50 2015 UTC,I wear this belt with this holster.  Another similar belt and holster combo that should be available at most gun stores are the Galco Gun Belts and Galco King Tuk(also a leather/kydex hybrid).

Glocks,360er1,frantzracing0,1 point,Sat May 16 13:37:19 2015 UTC,"Cool, but really, it might be best to start with a 43. Carry it, get comfortable and take it from there. Carry the 19 in the fall/winter/early spring when you can throw on heavier clothes to get used to it. Also, something that helped me initially was videotaping myself on my iPhone while carrying the 19, turning around, reaching for stuff etc. and then watching it back. I realized that it didn't print too bad and got very comfortable with it. Although, I will say that darker shirts are better for concealing. Anyway, don't stress too much, go with what you will ACTUALLY carry and build from there. You may find a 43 is all you really need anyway. Good luck."

Glocks,360er1,GlockCock80,2,Mon May 18 03:56:28 2015 UTC,"Just sold my 26 for a 19 for my off duty carry. The reason I did this is because I used to conceal my 26, but had the plus two extension on the bottom, giving it the grip of the 19 minus the capacity of the 19, and the half inch difference is barely noticeable. My coworker approached me one day and said that basically I was dumb for not just going with the 19 to begin with, and I agreed. So away went the 26 and hello new 19."
Glocks,360er1,ManyInterests,2,Mon May 18 18:29:12 2015 UTC,I'd carry my G34 if I were not a small frame person and it were not 1000 degrees outside. A G19 is carried by many.
Glocks,360er1,Shotgun_Sentinel,2,Fri May 15 02:25:39 2015 UTC,"My everyday carry is a G19. I carry in a DeSantis Cozy Partner. Its an all leather IWB holster secured with snap loops. I snap one on either side of my 3 o'clock belt loop. It has a forward cant so the butt of the pistol rides more forward. I carry all day, every day with this setup. It works with jeans/slacks/shorts with either an untucked shirt or t-shirt. You cant wear skinny jeans or a spandex workout shirt but you get an almost full size pistol that is easier to shoot than a micro 9 with 15+1 rounds (31 with a spare mag)."

Glocks,360er1,Shotgun_Sentinel,1 point,Fri May 15 01:15:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not much a difference. I was on-and-off with the extension for a while, but even with the pinky extension, it is still a smaller and lighter gun than the 19, even if it's just a little bit, it makes all the difference for me. I eventually decided to put the extension on all my G26 mags."
Glocks,360er1,OtherPaleBlueDot,0,Fri May 15 01:16:47 2015 UTC,Because the meaningful difference is in the back of the grip. The extensions only increase the front of the grip.
Glocks,360er1,gripplechew,-2,Fri May 15 01:38:46 2015 UTC,The extension still adds length to the back of the grip too. I had one. Save your bullshit for someone else.

It may feel big at first, but with a holster that fits you well, you'll quickly become comfortable. Will this be your first CCW? If so, you will quickly realize that even though it may feel like everyone around you can see through your cover garment, no one can, and most people are much too preoccupied with their own business and not observant enough to notice a slightly bulge on your hip."

Glocks,36109x,JakesGunReviews,5,Fri May 15 04:38:20 2015 UTC,"Dry fire with a coin placed on the front sight.  For what it's worth, the second-best handgun shooter in the academy I'm attending said he can't hit the broad side of a barn with his G42.  I picked up a box of .380ACP in the hopes he'll let me take it for a spin sometime.  Hopefully I can and we'll see how well I do in comparison.  Dry-firing with a coin on there will really help, though.  So will making sure you're putting the Glock's ""safety"" trigger dead-center in the pad of your finger.  You should have a groove on your finger after firing from being so consistent (finger shouldn't leave the trigger, anyway).  Next step after that is to start introducing snapcaps/dud rounds to catch yourself flinching and eliminate that, as well.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's a tiny bit of flinching going on with a pocket-sized .380ACP.  I used to have flinching issues with a lot of things pre-academy, myself."

Glocks,36109x,JakesGunReviews,4,Fri May 15 09:17:01 2015 UTC,Also don't grip too hard with your firing hand. This will cause you to pull the shots to the left because it is hard to isolate the movement of your trigger finger. People have a tendency to pull their other fingers with their trigger finger. The support hand should have more pressure on the gun.

Initially I focused on the grip and that helped, but the problem is, in a self-defence situation you have to grab whatever way it goes out of the holster, and be immediately accurate. Against all the smart advice I started working on the isolation of the movement of the trigger finger and that yielded a better result.

Glocks,35x07l,sbs540,14,Thu May 14 05:26:37 2015 UTC,"This is an easy way to ignite a caliber war, but I'll throw my $0.02 in anyhow... Everyone will have their different opinions, but I will say 9mm hands-down, especially in the smaller packages like the G26/27.   I'll give my justification in a nut-shell as well....  The FBI conducted experiments to determine the most effective round they should issue to their agents.... Their most recent study concluded the 9mm (when using FBI guns/ammo) is just as effective as other calibers with the added benefit that agents shoot 9mm more accurately than the other calibers. These findings changed from their previous study of the exact same design which had previously found the 9mm lacking in certain aspects. However, modern ballistics, as /u/thatoneguy2300 said, have brought the 9mm a long way and is, according to the FBI, just as comparable as a defensive round to the .40 or .45 --  The idea is that shot placement is far more critical to ""stopping power"" than caliber. (That's right, I put 'stopping power' in quotes) -- There are numerous well-documented cases of people sustaining gunshot wounds from all different calibers. However, a statistical analysis suggests that caliber is not correlated to lethality (which we can reasonably translate, without too many caveats, to threat-stopping-ability)  A .22 that makes a hit to the heart or other vital organ is going to do you a lot more good than a .45 that does not. If you rupture the aortic valve of the heart with any caliber, oxygen stops going to the brain, and the threat is neutralized effective immediately.  With trained professionals missing with the vast majority of all bullets fired in a lethal encounter, accuracy is likely going to be your lethality or defense-effectiveness bottleneck in almost all situations, not caliber.  Now, I also considered the following: many highly-trained agencies employ .40 pistols, probably most notably in my mind, BATF special agents are issued .40 Glocks (BATF should know what they're talking about when it comes to guns). However, it's worth mentioning that they have the longest and most rigorous firearms training of any US agency. If agents don't come up to par in accuracy with a .40, they issue them a 9mm. So, unless you put enough range time and training with the .40 that you are honestly just as accurate with it as a 9mm, the .40 has some advantages in some situations. But for the vast majority of people in the vast majority of self-defense situations, 9mm is the way to go."

Glocks,35x07l,scdodge03,3,Thu May 14 09:16:35 2015 UTC,"Here's another $0.02 for your piggy bank. Since you already have a 23, I'd get a 27 as the subcompact. Consolidating ammo is a great idea in my opinion. I've also shot a number of 9mm and .40 S&W subcompacts including the Glock 26 and 27. There really isn't enough difference in feel between the two calibers to say one is inherently better than the other. Both calibers in a subcompact will have a lot of felt recoil and both will be pretty snappy. So I'd just go with the caliber you've got."
Glocks,35x07l,NinjaBuddha13,11,Thu May 14 15:48:25 2015 UTC,26 all the way. Easier to shoot. Modern ballistics have brought the 9mm a long way in terms of stopping power. Also cheap. Get a mag extension and it's a great target gun. Win win. No looking back.
Glocks,35x07l,thatoneguy2300,3,Thu May 14 05:29:34 2015 UTC,Modern ballistics have brought the 9mm a long way in terms of stopping power increased expansion without sacrificing penetration.    I would be careful with using stopping power in your argument.
Glocks,35x07l,ThatsMrDoctortoyou,3,Thu May 14 16:12:22 2015 UTC,"If you already have a .40 go with the 27. I went with the 26 for the same reason, I already have the 19, so all the mags work."
Glocks,35x07l,Soulfader72,3,Thu May 14 18:21:18 2015 UTC,"I could ramble on about ballistics (penetration, expansion, retained weight, et. al.), felt recoil, capacity, and every other thing under the sun. But that's nothing you can't find in 100 other caliber war threads. So instead, I'll let you ponder this:  If I shoot you in a vital organ, is there anything a .40 is going to do that the 9mm doesn't? If I hit you in soft tissue, what is the 9mm going to do that the .40 didn't? At best, a 9mm round that passes an organ within fractions of a millimeter might've been able to clip the organ if it was just a hair larger.   With good effect on target (consistent ballistic performance within the thoracic cavity, frontal lobe, or brain stem), the ammunition's caliber is going to have zero bearing on the end result.   So with that, I choose the cheaper round with better capacity, and lesser felt recoil (bringing the discussion full circle back to where I said it wouldn't go). Choose whatever you shoot best and most comfortably, and disregard the rest. Whatever round will encourage you to practice and enjoy shooting is the right one; don't load up with some hand cannon T Rex killer that makes you shy away from shooting."
Glocks,35x07l,ZER0THE0RY,2,Thu May 14 19:19:49 2015 UTC,"Something else to consider is the cost of ammo. It looks like there is a about a $4 difference between 9mm and .40, with 9mm being cheaper. But that's just a rough estimate."

I love the versatility of that gun, with one barrel LWD change I'm shooting 9s at the range with no issue.  It conceals better than my g19, which I also love dearly.  The range session with my g27 was particularly satisfying because recently I took two defensive pistol courses.  In part 1 of the DP pistol course I used both my g27 and g19.  In part 2of the DP pistol course I used only my g19.  That's why, in part, I was so glad to have had another good experience with the smaller framed g27 and the .40.  Ultimately, you won't go wrong with either the 26/27, mostly comes down to your preference/comfort with a particular caliber (especially if you plan on using it for CC or other defense)."

IMO, the 9mm is a great defense ammo because, typically, a modern hollow point (hst 147g is wicked) is fantastic and you get more rounds per magazine.  You have a great gun in the 23.  I personally don't want 10 9mm handguns, or a bunch of the same caliber.  If I want 9mm i'll shoot my 9mm.  If I want to shoot the .40, i'll shoot my 40.

Glocks,35vsxh,raw157,2,Thu May 14 22:38:59 2015 UTC,"I dont remember the post or if it was even on this site but I just read the other day a reply from a glock customer service rep that there is something within the gun that can structurally fail if it is dry-fired too many times, and therefore the glock dude recommended snap-caps. I dont have years of firearms experience so I personally intend to follow it, you can choose to do whatever you want obviously but I'd recommend glocks recommendations."
Glocks,35vsxh,raw157,3,Thu May 14 22:47:03 2015 UTC,"Well it is true that early production Gen4s, specifically in 9mm, did have an issue with the recoil springs. Essentially what Glock did is they used a heavy double-recoil spring in the 9mm models (I think it may have been the same spring assembly used in the .40 cal Gen4s). So when 9mm owners used weak target ammo, the recoil spring was too strong to cycle the slide properly and a percentage of Gen4 G17s and G19s were having feeding/ejection issues.  This was addressed back in 2011 with updated recoil spring assemblies with proper weights for a wider range of 9mm ammo so this is now a non-issue. I must have close to 4k rounds through my 2013 produced G19 without a single hiccup."
Glocks,35vsxh,Hibria,2,Wed May 13 23:30:07 2015 UTC,"Extra mag with the Gen 4 sells it, unless you're looking in the used market. Plus it's got a better mag release."
Glocks,35vsxh,Hibria,2,Thu May 14 01:27:21 2015 UTC,I have large hands and the large beavertail makes a huge difference
Glocks,35vsxh,Hibria,2,Wed May 13 23:23:10 2015 UTC,"I love my gen 4. The grip texturing, recoil spring, beaver tail back straps, larger mag release. Every bit of it is winning in my book. But my best friend and my girlfriend prefer the gen 3 because of the grip feel. They both hate the gen 4 texture. I've discovered there are very few people who are indifferent about the gen 4's grip texture. It seems like you'll either absolutely love it or absolutely hate it. That being said, after holding my gen 4 with the beaver tail installed, my buddy did find a gen 3 compatible beaver tail online because he liked it."
Glocks,35vsxh,Hibria,1 point,Thu May 14 01:43:44 2015 UTC,I love my gen 3 glock 19. I have talon grips on my gen 3 which give them more grip. The back straps don't do much for me in terms of comfort.   Some people are always going to want the latest and greatest. I bought my gen 3 after then gen 4 release. I love it.
Glocks,35vsxh,Hibria,2,Thu May 14 15:00:15 2015 UTC,That's true.

Glocks,35wq4i,Mega-mango,1 point,Thu May 14 20:34:19 2015 UTC,I have seen G26s with extra long barrels to fit in a 17 and even a 34 slide.  You may be able to go that route instead of chopping down the grip
Glocks,35wq4i,rainy0days,2,Thu May 14 23:02:29 2015 UTC,You've seen a G26 with a G34 barrel and slide?
Glocks,35wq4i,Mega-mango,2,Thu May 14 23:06:13 2015 UTC,"Don't think you can do it with a 26, but I Lone Wolf has the parts to do it to a 19. As far as chopping the grip, go for it. I had my 19 chopped down to a 26, and it's the perfect carry gun. I was thinking of using a 17, but in the end chose a 19 due to balance. Most people can't even tell that it's been chopped because the proportions are so close.   Edit: forgot to mention. Don't make the cut straight across. The bit of backstrap on a subcompact that goes lower than the rest really helps grip and keeps the mags from hanging up on your hands when you change them."
Glocks,35wq4i,Mega-mango,1 point,Fri May 15 01:57:40 2015 UTC,"Explain you thoughts about the forward center of gravity and balance.

Glocks,35vi1l,thehbomb,4,Wed May 13 21:21:35 2015 UTC,"Gen4 G19   Nice choice. Welcome to the Glock family!   $601 OTD   It's a decent price.    brands of ammo   ...Kind of like asking for car recommendations- everyone will give you a different opinion.  The important thing is to not carry FMJ.  Do some research on penetration, research expansion, and make a decision for yourself.  Carry a name-brand hollow point, and definitely not that RIP bullshit.  There's plenty of websites dedicated to unbiased defensive ammunition testing and plenty of YouTube videos of John Doe shooting hollowpoints into ballistics gel in his backyard.     How should I go about storing the gun?   Depends.  What is it that you're trying to accomplish?  Keep toddlers away from grown-up toys?"
Glocks,35vi1l,southernbenz,2,Wed May 13 21:40:06 2015 UTC,Thanks. I was thinking cheap FMJ for the range and hollow points for self defense. I'll see what is on sale locally.  The safe is to keep it locked away from possible intruders. No children will be around. I'm taking value and size into account so the smaller 1-2 gun safes would be suitable.
Glocks,35vi1l,WhatsAnAllah,1 point,Wed May 13 22:30:00 2015 UTC,http://www.ftknox.com/product/personal-pistol-box-2/  I think this is what you should get because it is my understanding that these don't have the typical access locks that most safes have as backups that can be easily picked by knowledgeable intruders.
Glocks,35vi1l,southernbenz,1 point,Thu May 14 01:37:05 2015 UTC,"Look in the bottom of your black Glock case; you'll find the cable lock. Wrap that around the handle of the Glock case a couple times and lock it. Tell your housemates that your pistol in now locked up. Whether or not your G19 is inside will be up to you.    *I post this elsewhere in the thread, just wanted to make sure you saw it.*"
Glocks,35vi1l,_Jias_,2,Thu May 14 03:50:25 2015 UTC,"First off $601 is a bit high for a glock 19 gen 4. It usually runs $490-$550 with three mags and back straps.  As far as ammo goes the glock 19 will eat up just about anything you throw at it and come back for more! Make sure to get about 200-500 rounds through it to start to break it in.   I carry Speer Gold Dot 9mm 115gr GDHP for self defense. For the range, I shoot reloads or Speer Lawman Ammunition 9mm Luger 115 Grain Full Metal Jacket.  For storage it depends on a lot of different factors such as ""do you have children, is this your house self defense gun? ect... but in the end you can't go wrong with good gun safe."
Glocks,35vi1l,southernbenz,2,Wed May 13 21:37:48 2015 UTC,Thanks. It was $601 after taxes so $556 pre 8% sales tax.  I'll see what's on the shelf at Walmart or Cabela's since any decent FMJ would work on the range.  The safe is just for storage and to keep my housemates at ease. No children will be coming around.

Glocks,35vi1l,tylerldavies,2,Wed May 13 22:22:04 2015 UTC,I carry Speer Gold Dots and Federal HSTs. 124 grain is very popular but in the last couple years there's been a shift towards the 147 grain because modern JHPs like the HSTs are designed to expand reliably even at slower speeds so the 147s will still expand properly while giving you a heavier bullet.

Im looking for ammo coming out of a g26, so the balistics might be off, but it will help you see the quality of bullets that manufacturers are putting out."
Glocks,35vi1l,Vneck,2,Thu May 14 02:27:22 2015 UTC,"I had this same question when I purchased my G19 a month ago.  After countless hours of research, I determined Federal HST is some of the best carry ammo around.  I carry the 124gr in standard pressure.  I've also carried Gold Dots as well; I trust both with my life.  This being said, carry 124 now that it is getting warmer in SC, but when it gets cold again, consider a 147gr to dig through all the layers of clothing people wear.  I spent most of  my life in upstate (Oconee County) and I know it can get cold there.  As for finding the stuff, good luck at Walmart.  I could never find anything at mine.  I had a local gun store that carried a  good quantity of stuff but they never had HST.  Online is the best way to go.  As for range, go cheap but not too cheap.  One brand Walmart likes to carry is Perfecta, but I had issues with feeding.  I stock pile Federal Aluminum case, cheap as dirt and zero issues with feeding or jamming.  If you have an Academy Sports near you, I would start there.  The one near me was the one place I KNEW I would find pretty much anything I needed.  Best selection, period.  If you live near Palmetto State Armory take a look, I never went there but I heard great things."

I love mine, it's a fantastic pistol, but it's not going to disappear like smaller guns will. Is it carryable? Absolutely, I carry mine all the time. Will it be as if it's not even there... no.  If all you're wearing over it is a shirt it's going to print when you bend over or squat. Walking shouldn't be a problem. Comfort for me isn't a problem with the right holster. Carrying in the car isn't a problem as long as I'm carrying at 3-4 o'clock or so."

Glocks,35rk54,trrpip,2,Wed May 13 10:29:17 2015 UTC,"Im 6'2"", 190 lbs, and I have a g19 and a g26. The g26 is way easier to conceal. I carry my g26 at about 3 o clock, and I can bend over and squat down and it doesn't print at all, and I can forget its there. I can forget its there in the car, too.   If I want to carry my g19 and do the same activities without printing, I have to carry it at 2-2:30. It doesn't print, but you can feel it. I would say the g19 is in the way, but its not that bad. It depends on what you want to do with the gun.   I carry all the time and I find myself carrying the g26 more. Its easier to conceal and more comfortable. If you're buying it to just conceal sometimes, but you want to do IDPA or something on the weekends, you may like the g19 better (that's why I got mine). Neither choice is a bad one though. I like them both, but its my opinion the g26 is easier to conceal and more comfortable for activities."

I've carried it every day for the past six months and before that I carried a CZ-75 SP-01. However, it's a pretty easy gun to conceal, but it isn't going to disappear from view like a Glock 43 will. Furthermore, the Glock 19 is an excellent choice for a first gun. I wear skinny-ish jeans and a rather crappy belt with an Alex and Ryan Design IWB holster and I have yet to be called out for printing."

Glocks,35rk54,top_notch50,1 point,Wed May 13 13:32:51 2015 UTC,"If you're looking to conceal and carry, G26. As a first-time Glock/handgun shooter, and all-round weapon G19. I'm 6'0"" and 200 pounds, size 13 shoe, if that maybe gives you a relative idea of my large hand size. (I think relevant, as hand size is often a concern expressed with the subcompacts)  I had the same debate on my first handgun and carry piece. I ultimately decided on the 26 and from a carry perspective, I was really glad I did.    In my day-to-day activities, I'm crouching, crawling, stair-climbing, sitting for extended periods, walking for extended periods, you name it. Even with the subcompact size of the 26, it was difficult to find a comfortable carry method.  To carry comfortably, you'll probably have to make some sort of wardrobe modification and/or maybe choose/compromise on a particular carry position. With the 26, you will have to make less modifications or compromises compared to the 19.  Now, as a fledgling Glock enthusiast, I wish I'd gotten the 19, a little bit. I only say a little bit because I knew I'd caught the Glock bug and it wouldn't be long before I would own the 17, 19, and 26. The reason for this is that is I thought I went into this handgun thing for self-defense, but found myself more of a hobbyist shooter and I'm now getting into shooting competition.   While the G26 is an awesome gun, I can't help but feel that I am only handicapping myself from a competition perspective, compared to the longer barrel and sight radii of the 19 and 17 (in divisions where G26, 19, 17 all compete together). The 19 would have been a good compromise of carry-ability and non-defense shooting. -- However, this was really only a minor setback until I ended up purchasing all three pistols....  All things considered, I would recommend the G26 to you. You can't go wrong. Get the Pearce extension grip for it, if you like. I got one right away and have experimented on-and-off with and without it, and ultimately decided to get them for all my G26 mags."

I'm very tempted to get into practical shooting/steel challenge/etc., and I don't need ""concealment"" (I'm in Canada, and getting a CCW permit is literally next to impossible), so my current ""want"" model would be the G35.  (Have you tried .40 vs. 9 mm?)"
Glocks,35mw48,theycallmepo,2,Mon May 11 22:03:31 2015 UTC,I haven't tried .40 so I couldn't tell you the differences it is definitely a more accurate gun compared to the short barrel glocks
Glocks,35mw48,r_a_g_s,2,Tue May 12 01:07:54 2015 UTC,"There isnt a power factor needed for shooting steel. Shooting a .40 being a beginner (assuming you are just getting started), is just going to slow you down. Stick to 9mm for the simple reason of ease: less $, more rounds, less recoil."
Glocks,35mw48,MrSpaceFlunky,1 point,Tue May 12 15:02:40 2015 UTC,"True, but I'm also thinking of IPSC/USPSA.  (And also thought about a .22 LR conversion kit for heavy/repeated practice.)

Glocks,35mw48,MrSpaceFlunky,1 point,Tue May 12 15:39:05 2015 UTC,I wouldn't spend the money on a .22 conversion kit. Just stick to a 9mm and do tons and tons of dry fire training. Spend that money on ammo instead of buying a .22 conversion kit.

But even if they deny you it would take only a few minutes to have a glock armor verify and call for you. The problem is pretty blatant, like someone here said you can remove the slide and plainly see it get blocked.   If you go on the link in my op and go to the second or third page they made a diagram of what exactly the part looks like and what you have to do to alter it, so the part glock sends you just looks like a finely tuned version of their mod but still allows it to be ambidextrous for resale or if you're a lefty"

Glocks,35n26x,ishootthemoon,9,Mon May 11 21:14:53 2015 UTC,Apply for the GSSF (Glock Sports Shooting Foundation) for two years. They will then send you a range bag with Glock goodies and a Blue Label coupon within 30 days after applying. The two year membership is $60 USD.  Then with this coupon you are eligible for one Blue Label Glock. Check local gun stores as they need to be Blue Label dealers.  Then take your coupon and buy your Glock at a nice discount without being Law Enforcement/Military.  You will also get a second Blue Label coupon one year from when you received your first one (this is because you are a two year member)  Keep in mind that single year memberships are not eligible for the coupon.  Here are the prices for Blue Label Glocks and more information on the program.  Got my brand new Generation 4 Glock 17 for $425 USD ($465 USD with sales tax) this way.  All in all I was out around $525 USD for everything involved to get the gun. This is the best option for anyone wanting a factory new Glock for the best price.

To give the benefit of the doubt to the somebody you spoke to it might be what he was thinking about. However they have been available for a couple of years now, so he needs to update himself.."

Glocks,35ibqt,skypejake,4,Sun May 10 19:10:38 2015 UTC,"Glock has produced fde frames in gen3 & gen4 spanning pretty much all common, popular models. The fde frames were/are a exclusive to lipseys and will likely continue to be produced for lipseys as long as customer demand exists. They are not ""dyed"" or cerakoted, they are solid colored polymer made by glock to glock standards."
Glocks,35ibqt,rtf2-mike,1 point,Sun May 10 18:54:22 2015 UTC,"I've also got a question relating to this.    What's the difference between the OD and FDE gen 4 glocks?

Glocks,35ibqt,sixskiis,1 point,Tue May 12 15:02:16 2015 UTC,"I own a Glock with factory FDE frame - they make them, you just can't always find them."
Glocks,35ibqt,dead_indian,1 point,Wed May 13 02:57:12 2015 UTC,"There may be some misunderstanding here. GLOCK most definitely makes guns in FDE, manufacturing the FDE frames at the GLOCK factory, using FDE-colored polymer, not painting the black polymer (as some aftermarket services may do for you)  There is also ""Full FDE"" Glocks, which have the FDE color frame AND Slide. This particular kind is an exclusive available through the distributor Lipseys only. This is the only way you can buy a ""new"" Glock in ""Full FDE."" The advantage is that GLOCK will back the Lipseys model Glocks under the same warranty services provided to the regular black finish Glocks, whereas GLOCK may deny you service if, say, you had a black gun cerakoted by a 3rd party and somehow that process affected the functionality of the weapon.  To clarify, Lipseys is a distributor who has an exclusive contract with GLOCK to distribute the ""Full FDE"" versions. I'm uncertain of who exactly does the cerakoting process; I assume Lipseys takes care of cerakoting the gun, not GLOCK. While 'Full FDE' pistols are technically not ""factory"" since GLOCK does not personally cerakote the slide at the factory, but they are certainly not an aftermarket mutilation by a distributor without the consent of GLOCK."
Glocks,35ibqt,ManyInterests,-1,Thu May 14 08:11:27 2015 UTC,"They don't produce the FDE, they outsource it to a company named lipseys who does the dye for Glock, and then distributes them to dealers."
Glocks,35ibqt,Vneck,5,Sun May 10 18:44:29 2015 UTC,"This is very incorrect. Glock makes colors in batches. If you want to buy FDE or OD from Glock, you have to buy a large batch. That is why lipsey's had exclusivity. They bought a big batch of the colors. Glock produces the colored frame."

That's partially why they're so hard to track down sometimes. That may have since changed, but that is my understanding. If you call your LGS looking for one, they'll have to order it in directly from Lipsey's."

Glocks,35hjb0,adk09,1 point,Sun May 10 20:05:04 2015 UTC,For competition shooting it helps add weight to the front of the gun reducing muzzle flip and recoil as well as helping keep the front end steady when aiming. It isn't a major change but does help some.
Glocks,35hjb0,wolfgangmob,1 point,Sun May 10 21:49:20 2015 UTC,"More importantly, you can change spring weights for different loads."
Glocks,35hjb0,rainy0days,1 point,Mon May 11 04:52:02 2015 UTC,head over to /r/competitionshooting  Are you reloading for this G34? I reload 165gr projectiles and use a 10# Wolff recoil spring. Every load will be tuned differently. Most people I know run a 12# or 13# recoil spring on minor loads. I use an uncaptured Wolff Stainless steel guide rod. You will need to run a guide rod adapter to be able to use that guide rod.
Glocks,35hjb0,MrSpaceFlunky,1 point,Tue May 12 18:04:10 2015 UTC,That sounds like a .40 S&W load if you are using 165gr bullets.
Glocks,35hjb0,wolfgangmob,1 point,Tue May 12 20:56:21 2015 UTC,"Xtreme makes 165gr 9mm projectiles. I shot about 3k of them before going back to Limited division for the shooting season. They are extremely soft and flat shooting shooting. I highly recommend giving them a try. I was loading them with 2.7gr of Titegroup at a 1.135 OAL which I chrono'd them at 132PF, which is about 800FPS."
Glocks,35hjb0,MrSpaceFlunky,1 point,Tue May 12 21:52:56 2015 UTC,Do you run into any issues with shot timing with a load that slow or does the light spring compensate for that?
Glocks,35hjb0,wolfgangmob,1 point,Tue May 12 22:00:43 2015 UTC,I have never run into any issues with the set up I have in that gun. It's a great load to shoot at USPSA matches as a minor round and at steel challenge.
Glocks,35hjb0,MrSpaceFlunky,1 point,Wed May 13 03:32:52 2015 UTC,Yea also would just feel better with metal
Glocks,35hjb0,wolfgangmob,1 point,Mon May 11 00:23:48 2015 UTC,"Some guns polymer is better, either the Kel Tec PF9 or P11 a metal guide rod hits the barrel during recoil since the small size makes it so violent, this eventually dents the barrel and can cause excess wear. On Glocks it makes no difference, polymer is just cheaper while giving the same effect since the spring should wear out before the rod unless you are in environments with sand or other coarse debris getting into the RSA."
Glocks,35hjb0,cmharb2,2,Mon May 11 05:51:02 2015 UTC,"If you get one, go with a in captured guide rod and spring. You get a little more length on the rod which gives you a little more length up front. I think Taran Tactical Innovations has a pretty good one."
Glocks,35hjb0,rainy0days,2,Sun May 10 13:13:15 2015 UTC,"I like my Jager extended steel guide rod. I use it on a 17L, but it's designed to be flush with a 34/35.   The types of springs you intend to use are really what's going to effect what kind of guide rod you want. Are you going to use round wire like Wolff and Zev springs, or flat wire ISMI springs?   Edit: Should've mentioned this only applies to fun guns/race guns. If this is a defense gun, I'd recommend OEM RSA's only."

Also freedom is known to load light powder charges."
Glocks,35gskq,QuattroStig,1 point,Sun May 10 08:41:16 2015 UTC,I am just disappointed because I expected more from Glock. I expected it to be able to eat up anything that it throws at it out of the box
Glocks,35gskq,mutant90,3,Sun May 10 08:47:57 2015 UTC,"Your expectation is valid. I have owned 4 Glocks and the 42 is the only one that gave me trouble. A Glock rep and r/Glock were quick to blame limp-wristing (which I somehow have no issues with on two G27s, a G22 RTF2, or my G35). So I decided to strip it completely clean all the factory lube. I polished the feed ramp then applied frog lube, then hit it with a heat gun to lower the viscosity (much like the gel hand cleaner melts in your hand). I wiped it all off and re-applied one more time in the same manner. It hasn't had a hiccup since.   Disclaimer: There might be a different issue with your Glock. Unless you are a brand new shooter with the grip of a 5 year old, you shouldn't be having this frequency of malfunctions.   Also, the freedom munitions 9mm specifically has had problems.

It was surprised and disappointed, especially because my gen 3 G17 LOVES that ammo.  I left the gun stock and played around with different ammo and found that my G34 shoots much better with FM 147g ammo. So, you might want to try that. As a bonus, 147g is much softer shooting than 115g, if that's what your using.  I don't believe the whole limp wrist excuse. Glocks aren't perfect.

Glocks,35gskq,judsonm123,2,Sun May 10 13:27:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's anything wrong with your pistol. There's definitely a difference in the recoil spring's tension from the factory versus after shooting about 1000 rounds. The combination of a stiff unbroken-in recoil spring with under powered rounds from Freedom Munitions and poor QC from Winchester White Box could definitely lead to FTE or FTF because the slide can't move back far enough. The slide of a 17 shouldn't be an issue. If it was a 17L or 34 the issue may be made worse from the longer slide.  I actually stopped buying Freedom Munitions because the rounds are under powered, and I would have accuracy issues because some rounds would be loaded weaker than others. The quality is there, but they just don't load enough powder as they're consistently weak. I haven't had issues with WWB, other than a few wadcutters mixed in with the round nose FMJs. Perfecta, which is sold at Walmart, is also an under powered round. I made the switch to TulAmmo because they're consistently loaded, and usually on the hotter side so I don't worry about those issues."
Glocks,35gskq,judsonm123,2,Sun May 10 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"I have had nothing but FTF issues with my 34 and freedom munitions 115gr new manufactured rounds. I ran 200 through my 17 and only had 2 FTF, with the 34 it happened 2-3 times per mag.  I think they are just under powered, as my 43, 26, and 19 work fine."

Glocks,35ctmj,thenatureboy_,3,Sat May 9 15:53:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah if you don't actually see the 29 in person, the Glock website would have you believe that it's super tiny when honestly the only noticeably smaller feature than that of their Compact models (19,23,32) is the grip.   I was shocked at how similar in length the slide was when I held it up next to my 19. It's obviously a little thicker, which is better when you're shooting 10mm, but it's almost the exact same length.   Slap a 15 round G20 mag, a grip extension, and an extended barrel on there and you have what I'm going to call the Glock 49 (I shouldn't have to explain why 49)"
Glocks,35ctmj,deimosian,2,Sat May 9 14:06:20 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see somebody call my 29 a ""small"" gun. Even compared to my 20, it's still a pretty damn big gun.

Glocks,35ctmj,deimosian,2,Sat May 9 16:10:30 2015 UTC,Nice! Which barrel and grip extender are you using?  I often carry my G29 with a G20 mag + A&E Grip Extender. A&G? I forget the abbreviation.
Glocks,35ctmj,TameableExpertv2,6,Sat May 9 19:26:40 2015 UTC,Thanks! I went with the Lone Wolf barrel and XGrip extension

Glocks,35cdhe,ZaneMasterX,2,Sat May 9 13:31:06 2015 UTC,Allows for a +2 base plate while being the same height as the sheilds flush fit mag. Mega sold...only one question; given that they added like a MM to make the mag a 7 rounder; why the hell wouldn't Glock do this from the factory? Being 7 + 1 out of the box would have eliminated almost any criticism of this gun.
Glocks,35cdhe,SirBurningBeard,2,Mon May 11 02:47:45 2015 UTC,"Yea, that is a great point (and an obvious one). I'm not sure why they did that to be honest. I mean, like you said they could still claim a shorter grip than the Shield so why not do it themselves?Even if they wanted the flush mag to stay 6, they could have made the extended mag hold 7. The cynical side of me says there was a deal made with Taran Tactical (I mean Hickok45 pushed it too in his ""not pushing it"" way and sold me on it). It's possible that this was a great marketing scheme that helped push Taran Tactical into more mainstream use. Why help TT? Only the smoke filled rooms of Austria HQ would know the answer to that I guess. (go ahead and put the tinfoil hat on my head, I'll wear it)."

Glocks,3568e2,G19Gen3,3,Thu May 7 14:33:24 2015 UTC,"Nah, what you have will work.  Hickock45 pretty much swears by Ballistol for its simplicity and ease of use, but it's by no means a requirement.  What you have will do just fine, maybe even better.  Just remember, Glocks don't need much lube at all!  That being said, having a can of ballistol isn't a bad idea either, since it's also great for quickly cleaning the gun as well.  It's really up to you, though."
Glocks,3568e2,SonsOfLiberty86,1 point,Thu May 7 14:39:35 2015 UTC,Is that not the point of clp. Clean. Lube. Protect. Seems to me they do the exact same job.
Glocks,3568e2,I_AM_AVOIDING_WORK,2,Thu May 7 14:41:42 2015 UTC,"Well, the only reason I like having Ballistol specifically is because it is an aerosol spray (sorry!  should have specified that), so it can be a little quicker than say a bottle of just liquid CLP, but yes, they do pretty much the same thing other than that.  How well the product works aside (can't really speak for what you use, but I'm sure you know how well it works), if your CLP is aerosol/spray bottle than it basically is the same thing.  I find the spraying handy for getting it down in the barrel really well and quickly.  It's just a preference thing."

Glocks,3568e2,ZaneMasterX,2,Thu May 7 16:18:34 2015 UTC,"This  Seriously it's a modern handgun with modern rounds. Not cleaning it after only 100 rounds isn't a big deal and it can probably be fired, now, today, without any issues. You could go through a whole range session, most likely, without a problem. THEN clean it."
Glocks,3568e2,hi12345654321,1 point,Thu May 7 16:24:22 2015 UTC,I was told to do this to properly break in rifles.  This is how my father was taught in the army. I also have read it many times around different forums and magazines.  Again I can only speak of rifles.  This will be my first ish handgun. (Ruger lc9  was my first but it's far from anything practical)
Glocks,3568e2,pinkycatcher,3,Thu May 7 16:43:34 2015 UTC,"What kind of rifle? An AR? AK? R700? None of these rifles require that process to break-in, nor do any modern handguns (especially Glocks that come with coated slides that eliminate the need for constant cleaning and lubing). If anything, cleaning your gun 25 times in a row has the potential accelerate wear and tear; over-cleaning of guns is a very real thing and can damage and ruin your firearms. It definitely takes a lot of cleaning to get that level, but cleaning a gun 25 times in a row in one sitting is definitely on par with that level. Most modern firearms are designed to fire thousands and thousands of times without requiring constant cleaning or lubing, and many such as Glocks come pre-lined with anti-seizant (lubricant) and can shoot straight out of the box. With all due respect here, I've been shooting for several decades and own various/numerous firearms and have never heard of such a technique (cleaning 25 times in a row for a new gun) from anyone, ever.   I was told to do this to properly break in rifles. This is how my father was taught in the army. I also have read it many times around different forums and magazines   With all due respect again I'm not sure which gun guides, videos, and websites you are reading/looking at but the one's I just quickly Googled all share the view that over-cleaning your guns can be bad:   Stop Messing Around With Your Gun Bore Brushing - How Much is Too Much? Is There Such Thing as a Rifle That's Too Clean? Should You Clean Your Gun After Every Range Trip?   If you want to do that, that's on you, but it won't change the reliability of the firearm (a Glock is ready to shoot straight out the box, whether it has 100 rounds through it or 1,000) and over-cleaning it has the potential to damage the gun and possibly cause problems. Why would you want to do that?"

Glocks,353wu6,LIV3N,1 point,Thu May 7 00:46:59 2015 UTC,"Does it damage a gun to do this without snap caps, or whatever the practice rounds are callled? Can I do this repetively with an empty gun?"
Glocks,353wu6,one23four5six78nine,2,Thu May 7 16:58:20 2015 UTC,Modern handguns can be dry fired without issue. It is actually recommended on Glocks because it helps to smooth out the trigger components.
Glocks,353wu6,cal_bear,1 point,Thu May 7 19:37:09 2015 UTC,"Great, thanks!"
Glocks,353wu6,cal_bear,3,Thu May 7 20:03:26 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I was similar when I started shooting Glocks (Spoiled by my 1911). My main issue was the trigger. Here is what helped for me for that: 1: Dry fire practice and lots of it! I don't use snap caps, and some people don't like dry-firing Glocks, but I do. The other comment about using a penny (or something else) works well. Put it on top of the slide, and see if you can keep your front sight in focus, on target, while pulling the trigger, without the penny moving. Do this a lot. 2: Work the reset. I don't know about your Glock but mine has a decent reset. Instead of releasing the trigger all the way out, release slowly after a shot until you hear/feel the click. Then pull from there. Without the take-up, you will have a shorter and smoother trigger pull.  Those two alone (and lots practice) helped me a lot!"
Glocks,353wu6,SweetBlasph3my,2,Thu May 7 00:36:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the informative response! I do have a question though, I do practice with snap caps and my dry firing seems fine. And I went to the range and put a snap cap in the middle of the live rounds. When I got to the snap cap I saw the I was jerking the trigger down and to the right even when I think I'm squeezing it. Is there anything I can do to stop that?"
Glocks,353wu6,SweetBlasph3my,2,Thu May 7 00:44:43 2015 UTC,Sounds like you are anticipating the recoil. That 'jerk' you are seeing happens with real shots too and is likely why you shots are going all over. Just keep focusing on the front sight and let the recoil happen.
Glocks,353wu6,base935,2,Thu May 7 01:10:59 2015 UTC,Make sure you aren't mashing the trigger down and just using the tip if your finger so your pushing in not pushing in and pulling to the right

I dreaded every trigger pull with my friends. It was terrible. This is a proper subcompact .380. It's small enough to disappear when I wear shirts and shorts, and shootable enough to have a little fun on the range. I enjoy shooting it. The worst part to me is the slide release. My fat sweaty fingers just can't get a good purchase on it. I'll be replacing it with an extended release as soon as a good one hits the market. Back on topic though, the recoil is smooth, but let's you know you're shooting a firearm."

Glocks,34yf1m,opusrandy,1 point,Wed May 6 02:36:47 2015 UTC,Look at Surefire x300 or Streamlight TLR 1 for a good weapon mounted lights. Check out Bravo Concealment for good kydex holsters that will hold guns with lights mounted on them.

Glocks,34xxnm,wallysober,2,Tue May 5 17:40:04 2015 UTC,"Eh.... I think calibers are a subjective experience. For someone with tiny lady hands like myself, 9mm is better. If you can shoot .40 well, awesome! Do it! If you can't, no big deal. Shoot a smaller calibers. At the end of the day, a round of almost any caliber will stop most assailants."
Glocks,34xxnm,wanderingblue,4,Tue May 5 20:34:00 2015 UTC,"Aside from the fundamentals of safety, operation, and handling - I feel almost everything about shooting is subjective. Some folks swear on revolvers, others like modern semi-autos. Some like flash and style, others couldn't give a hoot less. And - as you noted - calibers should fit the person, and not the other way around. Shot placement, your personal confidence in your ability to shoot, and ability to shoot multiple rounds in quick succession should steer caliber choices - not some expert's unquestionable wisdom."

Same goes for the 22lr conversion slides, you won't be limited to gen4 specific. You also get a rail for a light on the g19. Beyond those reasons I can say myself and many others consider the g19 one of the best, if not the best all around pistol for the money."

Carry the 19 when I can and when I can't it's the 43.
Glocks,34ys1o,GlockCock80,1 point,Fri May 8 14:26:35 2015 UTC,"I'm considering the same thing and I almost posted this same question yesterday. Think I'm going with the 19 because I want a fun-shooting range gun/good nightstand gun more than I want an ultra concealable gun. I think I like the idea of the 43 more than I'd actually like the gun. But I agree with the fella that said get both, but get the 19 first. I think the 43 is perfect for what it's made for. Likewise, the 19 is perfect for what it's made for, and that the larger role I need filled. Cheers."

It lightened the trigger a bit, but honestly I don't know if I shoot it any better because of it. If you're just changing the connector it's pretty cheap to do though. If I ever swapped it back I might notice the difference more.  I recently put Trijicon night sights on and I love them. I really am a fan of the 3-dot style over the dot-partially-obscured-by-bucket style.  No point swapping the barrel unless you want to shoot cast lead bullets or put a suppressor on or something."

The Ghost broke (my fault, it was sticking wayyy out of the trigger housing and i broke it when i tried to bend it within spec). It wasnt bad though.  The Zev was the lightest, and also shortened the reset noticeably, however, imho it made it mushy.  The minus has been my favorite so far, with a nice polish on it. NDZ sells them cheap and with a polish too for like $2 more. I run it with stock trigger spring, plunger spring but with a lightened striker spring and never had a failure (even with reloads/WWB/reman ammo). Occasionally I run it with a Royal Arms trigger (they actually did manufacture the triggers for I think glockstore, zev and others)."

I installed the Zev connector, firing pin block and safety, and trigger spring. I didn't install the lighter striker spring to ensure reliability with hard primers though. This setup has reduced the feel of the Glock's two stages, but reduced the feel of a wall. I prefer this trigger feel since I find that my shots are always being thrown off when there's a distinct trigger break. Right now the trigger pull is at 4.5 lbs."

My gunners belt was $60 at a loval uniform shop, and I know Hank's Amish has belts that are like $30. I dont have a Hank's, but I hear they are very good belts for carrying.

Glocks,34mjlt,southernbenz,4,Sat May 2 16:04:16 2015 UTC,"The target-market for the G43 just isn't the market that wants race-style magwells.  Combine a +1 or +2 mag extension with a Hogue-style grip, and you'll be good to go."

If you're not trying to troll us, and you're honestly worried that the G43 handle is too small during reloads only, you'll have to get a Walther CCP or something else.

Glocks,34mjlt,JakesGunReviews,1 point,Sat May 2 22:31:48 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, I do not believe so.  There's no market for it.  People who want a bigger gun are going to be ok with a staggered magazine.  People who want a smaller, concealable gun are going to be ok with the pink-extension grip.  Time has proven that no one wants large, single-stack guns.  The 1911 and single-stack market collapsed during the development of the Wonder Nines in the '80s.  No one is itching to revive it.  As of today, 1911's only sell for their novelty and classic designs.  No one actually goes into a gun store and says, ""I want a large gun that only holds eight round of ammunition, please."""

Haven't shot them yet, but I can already tell there is a huge difference in the width versus stock. There's way less space side-to-side between the front and rear sight, so hopefully longer range shots will be more accurate.  Install is typical Glock sights. I will note that the front sight screw is not as long as the stock but there's not any reason as to why. The rear sight also has two set screws on top, but does not include an allen key so I had to go out and buy a 1.5mm one.

Glocks,34iv2e,post_break,6,Fri May 1 15:04:41 2015 UTC,So this is news to me. What I bought. And what I appear to have.
Glocks,34iv2e,not-brodie,23,Fri May 1 15:05:29 2015 UTC,the ameriglo sites use trijicon vials. trijicon supplies a lot of vials to other manufacturers
Glocks,34iv2e,gramcooke,11,Fri May 1 15:25:23 2015 UTC,This is true. Trijicon is one of the only licensed manufacturers of tritium in the US. There's a lot of legal tape associated with it because of radioactivity laws.
Glocks,34iv2e,amancini92,2,Fri May 1 16:44:20 2015 UTC,Trijicon does make the tritium so maybe that's why?  Or does the front sight appear different also?
Glocks,34iv2e,wckdwabbit,2,Fri May 1 15:25:36 2015 UTC,"Front sight says trijicon too, it's just not tapered like this one."
Glocks,34iv2e,KniteWulf,4,Fri May 1 15:37:49 2015 UTC,"The front sight being marked Trijicon is normal.   My understanding is Ameriglo makes the body of the sight, sends it to Trijicon who installs the tritium vials and puts their mark on it and sends it back to Ameriglo."
Glocks,34iv2e,wolfgangmob,2,Fri May 1 16:36:38 2015 UTC,Fascinating. Ameriglo must not have a license for tritium or something.
Glocks,34iv2e,wckdwabbit,3,Fri May 1 16:38:43 2015 UTC,"There are only a handful of licensed distributors of tritium vials.  Being a watch guy, I have 3 watches with tritium lume, and found that most watches have tritium vials from H3; curious about this, I did some digging. Tritium is used in nuclear devices, and so is heavily regulated in the US."
Glocks,34iv2e,wckdwabbit,1 point,Fri May 1 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"And if it is used even in small amounts on anything involving guns, iron sights and scope reticule illumination mainly, it's an even bigger pain in the ass to attempt to import it so for pistol sights the only real option is to buy from a US company."
Glocks,34iv2e,drinkduff77,1 point,Fri May 1 18:48:04 2015 UTC,"That could be, I have no idea what it takes to produce the vials.    It may just be cheaper to outsource it to Trijicon than to deal with it themselves.  Personally I like seeing ""Trijicon"" on my sights.  I'm familiar with the quality of their tritium vials and know that they will glow bright for a long time.  As a side note, I bought a g26 a few weeks ago with Ameriglo spartan sights with Trijicon tritium inserts.  These things rock, they are very bright and well made.  I have a g17 I may be putting suppressor sights on sometime soon and will definitely be looking at Ameriglos offerings."

Glocks,34iv2e,f0rcedinducti0n,1 point,Fri May 1 16:52:47 2015 UTC,"Will do. I got them mostly because the rmr is going in soon, the suppressor will take a while."

Glocks,34gxvp,bravo_charlie_22,6,Fri May 1 01:38:13 2015 UTC,"It's fine.  The pin at the back of the grip that is used to hold the backstraps in place is also used to hold the rear of the trigger mechanism. When you removed the pin to install the backstrap, the trigger mechanism could move freely as expected. Once you put that rear pin back in after installing the backstrap, the trigger mechanism will secure back down."
Glocks,34gxvp,Zerv14,2,Fri May 1 01:51:21 2015 UTC,"You are awesome, thank you for the detailed answer. That makes me breathe easier now.  When i put the pin back in, does the trigger mechanism automatically get locked back down? Would i know if it didnt get locked back into place if i tried to wiggle it around?"
Glocks,34gxvp,Zerv14,2,Fri May 1 02:00:40 2015 UTC,"If you pushed the trigger mechanism housing down and then pushed that rear pin back in, it's secure. The pin goes through a hole in the housing. If the trigger mechanism wasn't pushed down all the way, I don't think the slide would even fit back on the gun and the pin wouldn't be able to push through to the other side of the frame. If you want, you can remove the slide and try pulling on the ejector (the metal piece that is sticking out from the trigger mechanism housing) but as long as the pin is in place, it shouldn't move. When you remove the pin, the housing can be pulled out quite easily."
Glocks,34gxvp,gooknezz,1 point,Fri May 1 02:07:01 2015 UTC,Ok yeah that makes perfect sense. Im pretty sure it's secure as i tried to tug on it but it wasnt moving. Thank you very much for the help.
Glocks,34gxvp,Jamsdod,1 point,Fri May 1 02:17:41 2015 UTC,See part 27 and the hole in part 22. It would be nearly impossible to put the pin back into the wrong area when the trigger mechanism is seated.

Glocks,34gmk6,GeneralMaco,2,Thu Apr 30 23:57:25 2015 UTC,"I have a Glock 33 Gen 3 and I absolutely love it. It is my favorite carry gun. With that being said, .357 sig does have some recoil to it (especially in a subcompact package like the G33). I would say the recoil is more than a .40 cal but less than .45 auto. The .357 sig round was created from a collaboration between Sig Sauer and Smith and Wesson in an attempt to replicate the ballistic effectiveness of the renowned .357 magnum and put it in a round that would allow it to be loaded and fired from an autoloading pistol. The result was a round with the same size casing as a .40 cal then necked down to a .357 bullet (roughly the same size as a 9mm). This means that it is extremely easy to convert from .357 to .40 cal should you ever desire to do so (.40 cal is cheaper, more available). In a Glock all you need to do is swap out the barrel for a .40 cal barrel, you can use the same magazines just fine. It is also supposed to jam less and be more reliable in loading to the chamber due to that necked down feature. Anyways the .357 sig achieves ballistics similar to the .357 magnum (slightly less muzzle velocity and energy than .357 mag) in a much smaller package. It is a very accurate, fast, straight flying round over distance that packs a punch.   tl;dr: If you're cool with the recoil, .357 sig is an awesome round and Glock 33 is a great gun. Would recommend."

Departments, militaries, competition shooters around the world run this gun for 10,000+ rounds and no one has a video of a Glock slide-stop failing to engage the slide.  Slapping a magazine into the locked position engages the slide on brand new Glocks.  This has nothing to do with using the slide-stop as a slide-release."
Glocks,34ha8i,silverdynamics,1 point,Sat May 2 23:38:52 2015 UTC,Won't change anything. The slamming flexes the frame which causes the slide to go into battery. Don't put a mag in and slam the base chances are it will flex enough and the slide will unlock and come forward. It happens on all polymer framed guns.

Glocks,34aon7,LambastingFrog,2,Thu Apr 30 06:54:08 2015 UTC,This is my G17 that I recently picked up the Zev Socom slide for. It's got the RM02 mounted on it with the blacked out irons. Full adjustable Zev trigger kit with skeletonized striker and full stipple job on the frame. The barrel is still stock as well as the recoil spring which will probably stay like that.

Glocks,34aon7,LambastingFrog,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:47:20 2015 UTC,Can you tell me more about the iron sights? I'm still figuring out which to get for my RMR back-ups.
Glocks,34aon7,southeast_boarder,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:05:30 2015 UTC,These are just the blacked out ones that I painted the front post tip white so it's a little easier to find the dot when you first press out. I've had night sights front and rear with an rmr before and too me it's a little busy looking with all that. I may just put a front post night sight on so it's easier to find the dot at night but I don't carry this gun so it's not a huge deal for me now.
Glocks,34aon7,igrulks,2,Wed Apr 29 21:16:24 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're thinking a similar way to me - I'm looking at the Ameriglo black rear and tritium front, with an RM02 (which I see you have, too)"
Glocks,34aon7,igrulks,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:55:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't think you'll be unhappy with that set up and if need be you could always get a tritium rear if needed.

Glocks,34aon7,seapilot,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:28:27 2015 UTC,"The aimpoint is never gonna break or lose zero, so the irons are basically just a backup...the only real issue is reduced sight radius, but for a backup, do I really care?

Glocks,348u42,GreenIronFist,4,Wed Apr 29 16:53:08 2015 UTC,"I got new grips and sights for my G17. The grips are Talon Grips (rubber texture) and the sights are Trijicon HD night sights. After one trip to the range, and about 100 rounds through with the new additions, I am pretty happy. The grip feels excellent; I get a real solid grip where it felt a little slippery before (coming from a 1911 with nicely checkered grips). I also really enjoy the sights. I can pick up the orange front sight really well and the U-shaped rear sight allows me to align the sights a lot better for more precision shots. I can also pick up the sights well in low light (which i tried to create in my crappy pics) as the tritium glows really nicely in these with a 3-dot sight picture (if the orange is not visible). If anyone has questions about the gun, sights, or grip let me know! I just thought I would share."

I don't have a sight tool and I figured I was paying about what MSRP is but with installation so I was cool with it. There are 3 tritium lamps (one front and two rear). In normal light it shows up as one orange dot up front and a plain black rear. I think this helps a lot with target acquisition. In the dark, it shows up as a bright 3 dot sight. They are awesome. I haven't used them anywhere other than the range though but I think they would be awesome in other applications as well. Better than the stock sights for me, that's for sure!"

Not sure what the wait time is.   http://shop.oxcreektactical.com/Defender-Series-93202.htm  If that doesn't work for you, head on over to http://www.daraholsters.com/. They are probably one of the best all-kydex holster companies. Current wait time is 3-5 weeks.  Unfortunately with a g30 youre not going to be able to find holsters as easily as a 17/19, but theres plenty of good ones out there!"

Glocks,34as9u,slalomz,5,Wed Apr 29 18:03:43 2015 UTC,Only reason they delayed the sale of the 43 was to maximize 42 sales while it was the exclusive single stack. 26>43>42 IMO
Glocks,34as9u,Gadnuk_,3,Wed Apr 29 18:09:49 2015 UTC,"I literally just bought the 43. I was debating between both the 42 and 43. It was a $50 difference, and 9 mm is cheaper where I am than .380 caliber. The size was only very slightly bigger as I was buying it with the intention to carry. I went with the 43."

Glocks,34as9u,Caboose106,2,Sat May 2 06:09:52 2015 UTC,"I would go with the ammo you already use. If you already own 9s, get a 43. My wife has a p238 so we already purchase .380, and I don't own a 9mm right now."
Glocks,34as9u,wirelessjunkie,2,Wed Apr 29 18:19:48 2015 UTC,"The only instance I would say go 42 is if you are wanting to carry it in your pocket. I recently purchased a 42, and its pushing the limit of size appropriate for pocket carry. The 43 is dimensionally larger (marginally), so you should consider this when making your decision.  Also, the 43 will weigh more. If you will be exercising with it this may or may not matter to you. (Extra weight likes to swing around more)  If a slight weight and size difference wont matter, go for the 43. My $.02 FWIW."
Glocks,34as9u,silverdynamics,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:53:07 2015 UTC,43 over 42 for sure. Like most other people tho if possible I'd go with a 26. If you don't mind the snap of a .40 a 27 is great and my personal backup.
Glocks,34as9u,wolfgangmob,0,Thu Apr 30 01:15:25 2015 UTC,"43, the best JHP .380 bullets still do marginally in gel tests and FMJ .380 can over penetrate while 9mm JHP still does pretty good from a 3"" barrel with proper SD ammo. Also, I don't know about you but I can find 9mm JHP ammo that is suitable for SD at most gunshops and stores that sell ammo around me while .380 tends to be harder to find and can be more expensive. I have a Kel-Tec PF9 and while the recoil is pretty harsh compared to a full size 9mm I am confident in the gun."
Glocks,34arqt,Morrisaurus,2,Wed Apr 29 17:39:12 2015 UTC,"My opinion is stick with glock factory parts. A recoil spring should be replaced in the 10,000 round range.

Glocks,34anim,sonictt1,7,Wed Apr 29 17:23:02 2015 UTC,"If you plan on plinking a lot, 357 sig is pretty pricey. You can convert it over to 40s&w if you wanted with just a barrel, but then you're spending another $100 on top of the gun to shoot cheaper. You really can't go wrong with a G19 as a first handgun."

Glocks,34anim,ChapstikHero,2,Wed Apr 29 17:52:14 2015 UTC,"Logic aside 357 SIG is a nice round for defense, however it's gain over 9mm is marginal since it still isn't fast enough to create permanent wounding cavities which need about 2000fps or so."
Glocks,34anim,andfullofmoney,2,Wed Apr 29 18:02:15 2015 UTC,Buy the 357 if he is willing to go down to 400. Otherwise I absolutely recommend getting the 19.  Edit: I own a Glock 31 and it's nice being able to throw in a Glock 22 barrel and shoot 40 S&W. The conversion takes 30 seconds.

Awesome power, 11 rounds in the gun plus an optional 15 more in my pocket, all capable of 180gr travelling at 1260 fps means I'm ready for anything, regardless of the threat."

Glocks,345r1w,G19Gen3,2,Tue Apr 28 19:11:05 2015 UTC,Depends on the pockets and the person.    I would do it because I'm a fatty.  My pockets are already too tight.
Glocks,345r1w,southernbenz,2,Tue Apr 28 19:51:56 2015 UTC,"I've considered it because while carrying my 19 is comfortable, I can't tuck with the method of carry I use."
Glocks,345r1w,G19Gen3,2,Tue Apr 28 20:46:31 2015 UTC,I can't tuck with the method of carry I use.   owb?
Glocks,345r1w,Aerial_Screw,4,Tue Apr 28 20:52:21 2015 UTC,"No, I use a MIC holster (the kydex trigger guard on a string) and a clip draw. Between the two I still have two points of contact but it doesn't tilt or move anywhere while still being able to shift within reason. It's an amazingly comfortable way to carry safely but in order to tuck I'd have to not use the clip draw, and the MIC holster alone won't keep the gun in check because the handle of the gun won't ""catch"" on the pants.   Otherwise though I love it. Used to use a hybrid holster with a different gun, which was ok, but then you've got all this extra junk in the way which makes it uncomfortable for me."
Glocks,345r1w,G19Gen3,2,Tue Apr 28 21:12:12 2015 UTC,"I carry my 27 the same way, and with the A-grip it's sooo comfy for appendix carry. The Clipdraw/MIC holster combo is definitely the most minimalist way to have a gun on you short of carrying it in a bag or something IMO. I love it. I can't see myself ever putting it in a legit holster ever again."
Glocks,345r1w,Sloppy_Twat,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:53:18 2015 UTC,"Definitely. As it turns out the clipdraw will actually play nice with a lot of holsters, so I might pick up an owb blade tech at some point for hiking or whatever, but otherwise I love carrying this way. I know a lot of people carry a single stack and say it's so comfortable that they ""forget it's there"", but I'm able to forget about 15+1 rounds with (for me) a full grip. I'm a fan."
Glocks,345r1w,G19Gen3,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:47:38 2015 UTC,"Nice nice! I always thought about this setup if I ever started to cc, but i have never actually heard someone say they use it. Do you appendix carry? What are the cons of this setup compared to other methods of cc?"
Glocks,345r1w,Sloppy_Twat,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:12:51 2015 UTC,"I carry at 3 o'clock. I think this method prints less than any other available one because it's just the gun with zero extra material. Only two cons I've found is that you can't tuck and the weapon is right against your undershirt, so you need to hit it with an oily rag at night to keep sweat at bay. Although with a lot of carry options that's still an issue anyway.   It's really a comfortable way to carry. Plus it's 100% ambidextrous and can be used around the entire ""clock"" so you can carry appendix or anywhere else with ease. Just move the string and reholster."

Also make sure you look up the instructions on use of the MIC so you don't crack it. You slide it on from the front of the trigger guard (not slamming on from the bottom) and then you draw and shove forward which pulls the MIC off properly."

Glocks,348d26,MirolynMonbro,4,Wed Apr 29 02:38:47 2015 UTC,I would start by just replacing the springs.  That should fix it.

I regret spewing hate like every other non believer I have been around now after having shot his gun, and have already purchased and read 'Glock' the book. I am a fanatic now, and will be purchasing many more, as they are just a fantastic gun.   I also took the little gun to the range yesterday to try out my accuracy as it will be replacing my Sig 938 Equinox(the Sig recoiled far more than the 26, and I can't seem to hit anything with the 938 specifically past 7 yards). Needless to say, I did far better with the Glock than I expected for first shots at 16 yards.   http://imgur.com/zn3xwHe"

Glocks,344m4a,Joos4Jesus,3,Tue Apr 28 14:46:49 2015 UTC,"I do regret the hypocrisy, and short sightedness. Getting older I think I'm becoming less biased and more open minded on legitimately good designs, just a shame I didn't mature faster to this concept.   I now preach to all my friends about Glock, which they find odd considering I was against anything Glock before. Obviously everyone will react to a gun differently and may not see the same results I did with accuracy. Which is alright because we have oodles of choices for guns, but to say the gun sucks because of your experience is unjust.   Anyways, I'm glad to be a part of the club now."

Glocks,344m4a,Soulfader72,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:43:17 2015 UTC,"I think one of the main decisions ya have to make(of course how the ergonomics feel is just as important) is if you enjoy hammer or striker fired. Sucks to hear about your experience but honestly it ain't too big a deal.   If hammer fired is your thing(since ya mentioned a 1911), I'd suggest the PX4(or a Sig), I love mine and it shoots very well). The price is on point as well for what ya get(going for around 400-450$; cold hammer forged/chrome lined barrel, rotating barrel so energy dissipates through another axis of movement(my friend has a .45 PX4, and the felt recoil feels like my P226), trigger out the box on the single action is AMAZING, and I could go on."

It's as if this requirement list was built to fail Glocks. There is no category for a polymer frame, no category for their SAT trigger system which doesn't exactly match the true definition of a DA trigger, the Glock LCI probably doesn't match what their looking for, and the polymer frame is very lightweight.  Even if I give incredible leniency to the trigger and LCI, we're still 19 points away.    I chose to score the G25 because the G28 would score even lower due to the weight and size."

So when I go to the sporting goods store to take a peek at the handguns am I even allowed to handle them to see how they feel in my hand?
Glocks,343zv1,deamonskull,2,Tue Apr 28 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"Most gun stores will ask if you are 21y/o.  What you could do is just go in with your dad, and have him tell them he's buying you one as a gift and wants to make sure he gets you one that fits your hand well.  They would probably let you handle them at that point.  I've bought my girlfriend a gift firearm or two before, and this is basically what I end up doing every time, anyway.  I'd hate to buy something for her that didn't fit her well."
Glocks,343zv1,duanet85,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:44:04 2015 UTC,"If you're with you're dad, it's not a problem. They'll let you handle them. And as long as everyone understands he's gifting it to you, it's all well, you can talk about what you want in a gun, fitment, etc.   The only question would be once you're 18, Im not sure what the laws would be there. On one end you can legally own a handgun and open carry it (in many states) but on the other, you can't purchase one until you're 21; being its a store, they probably wouldn't let you handle it..legally. In practice though, I'm 22 but don't look near that, people think I'm around 18 and no gun store has asked for an ID to handle handguns. Haven't even asked, just verbally, if I'm over 21 which I imagine is the extent they'd go."

I have a 23 and 26 and a 19 is on its way. Also my opinion, Gen 4 is the way to go. The thinner grip is nice, plus the backstraps will make it more versatile as you grow.

I was given a .22 single six but never really shot it because it was too weak for me. I purchased a Glock 17(and recently a 43 but haven't shot it yet) and thought it was perfect. It gives that kick that is expected from a handgun but is very controllable, plus it's easy to find affordable ammo to shoot"
Glocks,343zv1,schema9000,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:52:13 2015 UTC,"Given your age and assuming you have no physical disability involving your hands, a 9mm is the perfect pistol to learn to shoot with. Recoil is relatively mild and ammo is on the cheaper end of the price spectrum. With that said I would go for a 17 or even a 34 if you think competition might be your thing."
Glocks,343zv1,schema9000,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:31:54 2015 UTC,"9mm is a perfect starter. I started on a Ruger SR9. Great starter gun actually, if you're interested. I knew you said you were open to other brands. I eventually got rid of it because it is riddled with cumbersome safety features and there is a lack of parts available around my area (vs my Glocks)   Those same safety features were very attractive as I was learning though. They run a good price too, roughly 399.99-450."

You're not going to worry about concealed carrying for another 5 years, so there's no need for a 26 or even 19 IMO.

Glocks,343zv1,SmithWessonMP,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:13:42 2015 UTC,Dont get the 42. Its a carry gun with expensive ammo.  Go with a 17 or 19.
Glocks,343zv1,Sub116610,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:52:01 2015 UTC,"Since you posted on /r/glocks, I guess I'll say a G17. Reasons:   Not concerned with concealed carry Cheap cartridge = shoot a lot (9 mm) Easy to maintain Low recoil, easy to operate   But my first recommendation would be a CZ-75 SP-01 Tactical. Probably one of the best handguns ever made."
Glocks,341sms,apbaseball,9,Mon Apr 27 17:10:05 2015 UTC,"You're likely anticipating the shot and pulling down whilst squeezing with your hand.  Insert a couple snap caps into your live mag (or better yet have a buddy do it for you so you don't know where they are).  I'm betting you'll be surprised by how much you jerk the gun when it goes click instead of bang.  Once you see what you're doing you can work to correct it.  The aim is to not anticipate but let the break surprise you.  Dry-fire practice at home, work on your grip and pull, etc.  A corrective target can also help point out where you're going wrong."
Glocks,341sms,cosmos7,4,Mon Apr 27 17:21:55 2015 UTC,Cosmos7 has it right! Snap caps help a ton. Have someone load them in for you. Dry fire practice like its your job. Most of the pros train with dry fire for 2 hours for every hour they do of live fire.
Glocks,341sms,silverdynamics,3,Mon Apr 27 17:49:28 2015 UTC,"I've got pretty much the same advice.  Make sure to really focus on how your front sight wobbles during your dry fire practice. Make sure your ""target"" is very small, and notice how you probably aren't on it when you break.   Also, don't forget to use the pad of your trigger finger. Even for someone like myself with average hands, the Glock grip is not very big and it's easy to get too much finger on the trigger."

Glocks,341sms,therealatri,3,Mon Apr 27 19:57:05 2015 UTC,Sounds like you could be jerking the trigger and/or over gripping. Without being there it is hard to tell. Make sure you focus on your front sight and press through the trigger slowly and deliberately.  When the gun goes off it should surprise you.  I have the same problem and for me it is jerking the trigger to make it go bang NOW because i see that my sight picture is ined up perfectly lol dry firing helps. Just takes lots of practice.

Glocks,341sms,cacrouch,2,Mon Apr 27 19:00:47 2015 UTC,"Trigger control. Smooth steady trigger pull.  Well actually now that I think about it, thats not 100% true with a glock.  Pull the trigger until you hit the wall.  Then a slow steady squeeze. Its not a DA trigger after all."
Glocks,341sms,hi12345654321,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:50:41 2015 UTC,I had the same problem with my Glock 19. My issue was I was crushing the grip with my little finger which pulled the gun down and to the left.
Glocks,341sms,devilthorn,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:12:20 2015 UTC,"A Glock trigger is only good for being safe. Glock triggers are not your friend when it comes to the ol' ""pull the trigger straight to the rear"".  Its easy to pull the trigger straight to the rear on a flat faced trigger like a Sig or 1911. The pad of your finger presses against a flat surface and the job of keeping that trigger press flat and straight to the rear is easier. On a Glock, because of the trigger safety, the trigger doesn't have a flat face for your finger to contact. This makes it easy for the trigger to become a fulcrum of sorts that will point the barrel to the left (or right if you're a leftie shooter) when you pull the trigger."
Glocks,34463t,that_gun_guy,2,Tue Apr 28 03:53:35 2015 UTC,The OD of the barrels are different. I also think the breech face is different
Glocks,34463t,theycallmepo,2,Tue Apr 28 04:04:25 2015 UTC,You need a conversion barrel. The .40 slide is not the same as the 9mm.

You could just get a front sight that's tritium, or look into something like the XS Big Dot sight.  I love my Trijicon night sights, which are 3-dot, just took them out to the range for the first time yesterday and they work way better for me than the ""submerge the dot 1/4 of the way in the bucket"". I used to kind of like the dot in the bucket until I got my Ruger SR22 which comes with 3-dot sights."

Glocks,342jne,stDemigod,3,Mon Apr 27 20:19:48 2015 UTC,"There's a reason why the grip and frame on the larger calibers (45 ACP, 10mm) are so much bigger. The engineers at Glock (and the other ""porcelain"" gun manufacturers) saw this and beefed up those particular models. This is also why it was such a big deal that the SF XDS in 45 was made as small as it was. I'm sure the 41 would last just as long as the 17, but I'm not an expert. The only 45's I've ever owned were 1911's (inb4 ""INFERIOR WEPONZ! BURN THE HEATHEN). Hope this helps."
Glocks,342jne,magalahi,3,Mon Apr 27 20:46:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. There are plenty of law enforcement agencies that use 9mm, .40, and .45 with 10,000+ rounds through their weapons. If there was a pervasive issue of malfunctions/breakage with the higher calibers, we would have seen a lot of evidence of this. Obviously check the weapon for excessive wear before you buy it. Also, changing out the major springs won't be expensive. If you want, have a smith look at it before purchase."

Glocks,34077r,mrfargus,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:03:21 2015 UTC,"This, 110%.  Always get the taller sight if available for long slide Glocks.  If they end up being too tall, it's really easy to just sand a little off the top of the front sight, and re-blue it with a cheap cold bluing kit."
Glocks,34077r,Engelmacher,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:37:41 2015 UTC,I used Taran Tactical. Almost identical to the Warren Sevigny but the rear sight is serated as well.
Glocks,34077r,WhatDoesTheCatsupSay,2,Tue Apr 28 17:20:55 2015 UTC,"So I don't have a Glock but the M&P Pro is the same as the G34 for the purposes of this discussion.  I also like Warren Sevignies, but sights are a highly personal thing and everyone has different preferences. You might want to check out Dawson too."
Glocks,34077r,James_Johnson,2,Mon Apr 27 16:40:36 2015 UTC,My opinion is Dawson thin fiber front with serrated black rear.  That red dot glows bright outside and is easy to find and lock in.
Glocks,34077r,cosmos7,2,Mon Apr 27 17:25:59 2015 UTC,"I've pretty much have had all the big name sights for my G35. Out of the non-adjustable sights, I liked the TTIs the best. No rust issues and REALLY great machining quality. Nice sharp edges and all the faces are flat. The fiber optic had the best placement, IMO with the TTIs. Very close to the top, and had the most fiber exposed resulting in a brighter dot.  The Zev sights I had, seemed to be cut slightly crooked, and the rear sight was easily dented and the top rear of the sight had an awful 45 degree cut that would catch the sun just right, and create a nice bright horizontal line across the top that was super distracting.  Right now, I have the Dawson adjustable sights. Very big, blocky rear which is nice to block out any distractions of your slide cover plate or reflection off the top of your slide. I also change from 9mm to .40 so it's nice to adjust my POA/POI as well.  Hope this helped a little bit."

Glocks,34077r,judsonm123,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:56:08 2015 UTC,Faster front sight acquisition. You're not supposed to put any focus on the rear sights hence the black rear.
Glocks,34077r,judsonm123,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:31:07 2015 UTC,It is as closed to a red-dot scope as you can get without using an optic.   Put the dot on your target and focus on the trigger. Gives you more room to spend time focusing on grip and trigger press.   Do get it adjusted dead on for your ammo though.
Glocks,34077r,judsonm123,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:44:32 2015 UTC,Can you explain that last sentence to me please?

Glocks,33uvq1,Killtrend,5,Sat Apr 25 22:45:29 2015 UTC,I'd say this goes for anyone who seriously carries.
Glocks,33uvq1,konoplya,5,Sat Apr 25 22:55:17 2015 UTC,I gotta agree with this. I got a drawer of various holsters I've bought and hated or just don't use as much as I thought I would.
Glocks,33uvq1,Killtrend,3,Sun Apr 26 00:21:00 2015 UTC,I only have one and it even fits all my glocks ._.
Glocks,33uvq1,bmdaia,2,Sun Apr 26 09:35:00 2015 UTC,"So if you can't pick a favorite, what do you find yourself using the most? Best value?"
Glocks,33uvq1,c3h8pro,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:32:29 2015 UTC,"Weekdays, it's usually the DOS, since I don't carry inside the building at work. It allows me to stow the sidearm hosltered in the center console of my truck, whereas a hybrid holster would take up a stupid amount of space. I can also carry the pistol holstered in a book bag or anywhere else since it occupies virtually no more space than the pistol itself. From concealment, it allows for a firm grip on the draw, has the slimmest profile of them all, and is obviously very durable.  On the weekend, or out and about, it's usually the Super Tuck. The J hooks and my velcro belt mean that nothing is visible, even when staring at my belt if I'm wearing a tucked shirt. It's tremendously comfortable, and offers excellent cant and ride height adjustment.   For competition, I always use the Safariland for USPSA and 3Gun, and depending on the weather and what I really want to work on, a multitude of holsters for IDPA.   At this very moment, I'm wearing the Cloak Tuck, and it's growing on me. The neoprene backing means I literally can't feel the weapon unless I make a conscious effort to do so. This might be the best value, as I got it and the Cloak Slide for under $60, since Alien Gear has a stupidly economical combo package. Their return policy and customer service are second-to-none, so if the gear holds up, I'd say they're the best value in the concealed carry world right now."

My understanding was that lipseys got glock to do at least 2 runs of fde frames, I remember hearing about 70,000 units per run. These were split between gen3/4 and covered nearly every popular model. Many of the gen3 fde units in 19/17/23 dried up quickly.   Glock was producing od frames from the factory in 2013 after not producing them for a couple years. I am not sure if they are still doing the od currently, but I bought a od g26 in early 2014 with a late 2013 collection date."

On the first ones I did, I used a technique from one of the YouTube vids to use a exacto knife to remove excess paint before using the non-acetone nail polish remover.  I regret that because those magazines were left a bit scratched up.  On the magazines for my other two glocks, I did not use a blade.  Instead it was just the non-acetone remover to get rid of excess model paint and they look perfect.

Thought about getting a threaded barrel for it and suppressor height sights BUT I want to get a chl soon and use the g19 for carry. As such, I think higher sights would be very detrimental to carrying (via snagging).   The barrel + sights were going to be around 250ish so I mind as well just put it towards a dedicated suppressor host, damn the luck!"

I have no knowledge of any reps coming in and asking to see 4473's to our blue label program. My guess is that there might be suspicion that this store has been selling blue label firearms to civilians, We are extremely stringent when it comes to blue label models and something like this highly unusual."

Glocks,33m0qc,rainy0days,-6,Fri Apr 24 00:20:38 2015 UTC,"Meh, whatever, sounds like a tin foil hat, Alex Jones wacko. If they participate in the program, then Glock has good reason to verify proper participation when allowing such significant discounts. What are they going to do? Take the shop's word for it? Please, grow up. They will of course require official documents in order to be able to use the info as legitimate verification. Sorry gun shop, your promise written on a napkin won't cut it."
Glocks,33m0qc,rainy0days,3,Fri Apr 24 00:02:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, Glock has good reason to establish whatever paperwork they want to use to verify. That does not mean they get to demand the ATF paperwork.  They get to establish their own. This is like me offering a discount for something I manufacture, then asking the reseller for your tax return later on to audit whether you qualified for the discount.  Even when the seller had another process in place for record keeping and verifying you qualified. But me yelling TAX RETURN OR NOTHING!!!!!!!!"
Glocks,33m0qc,rainy0days,-1,Fri Apr 24 00:16:52 2015 UTC,Why would they want an unofficial form? What credibility will an unofficial form have?
Glocks,33m0qc,armedohiocitizen,3,Fri Apr 24 00:47:38 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't want an unofficial form. Most blue label dealers I've used either want a copy of your dd 214, a letter from your department, or some other letter/proof verifying you are a first responder.   That is what Glock should be asking for. Not 4473's."
Glocks,33m0qc,proquo,-2,Fri Apr 24 01:13:58 2015 UTC,"Glock can ask for whatever it wants to ask for, it's their program. A 4473 has been found sufficient for firearm sales by the federal government. This is a firearm specific program. Deal with it."

There is a bit of a difference with the G42/G43. I learned that rather than wiggling the slide stop while pushing your punch into it, your going to want to push down on it from the top in about the middle where the little lip is. Push down hard while also pushing down with the punch and it will pop out. Now I can pop it out no problem. But I definately have had the thought ""i think this thing is stuck"". You'll get it.

Glocks,33l2dh,volcanonacho,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:05:02 2015 UTC,All you need to do is slightly push the pin in the opposite direction your have been pushing to release pressure off the slide stop. Then pull the slide stop up half way while wiggling it and pushing the pin at the same time. I have this issue from time to time with all Glocks.

This is my 11th Glock if I wasn't absolutely sure it was made by them I would swear it was made by another vendor and just carried their name. Even my 42 feels fine, 43 just doesn't have the feel of all or any of my other Glocks. Super muddy feeling trigger as well, not sure I'm a fan yet..."

As a novice the shield strikes me as a miniaturized Glock 19 (the 19's patent is up).  The reason I ask is the shield shoots better for me but, I would put it at maybe 20% better shooting.  I am thinking of using a shield instead of a Glock 43 as my everyday carry - and I don't want to sacrifice anything when it comes to reliability and since you're a Glock Armour I thought you might have an informed opinion as to it's design."

Glocks,33jozl,ScumbagSpruce,1 point,Sat May 2 21:40:03 2015 UTC,"You were told wrong. Glocks can handle +p just fine. +p is a SAAMI spec and Glock suggests only using ammunition that meets SAAMI specs. It's in their FAQ: http://us.glock.com/customer-service/faq  Handloaded +p and +p+ may exceed SAAMI specs so they recommend not using that. But any factory ammunition is going to be fine in a Glock. The vast majority of factory +p+ will be fine too, it's mostly just a liability thing. Glock says not to use +p+ because if it's loaded carelessly it can blow up your gun. That's why a lot of people don't recommend buying other people's reloads."
Glocks,33jozl,sonictt1,1 point,Sat May 2 21:51:04 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, so +p is okay? Interesting that the gun store owner told me that when he sold my 19 to me."
Glocks,33jozl,slalomz,1 point,Sun May 3 00:56:54 2015 UTC,"Yes +p is fine. I mean there's no point in shooting it as range ammo really, other than if you're checking that a new carry load works fine in your particular gun. It will probably cause a bit more wear than regular range ammo but you won't notice a difference unless you're shooting thousands of rounds of it."

Glocks,33jozl,Soulfader72,2,Thu Apr 23 03:44:25 2015 UTC,I've managed to match the Golden Sabres to Freedom Munitions 147gr RN as far as the feel for shooting. I have not chronographed the two but I think it's close so I practice with the FM and carry the Golden Sabres. I'm not a fan of the new Speer product because of the gel testing that's out there now but I already bought a few boxes.
Glocks,33jozl,sonictt1,2,Thu Apr 23 03:54:16 2015 UTC,"Im gonna have to try out the gold sabres, have been told a couple of people carry thoses. Have you seen the new rip rounds? They are expensive but looks sweet. I will see if i can find a link."

Glocks,33jozl,wolfgangmob,2,Thu Apr 23 04:04:23 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, I shoot and carry 9mm, not 40 S&W. I'd rather not start that debate...to each their own. In regards to the RIP rounds. I believe that they are a gimmick and are not worth the money. Besides, I think if you used them defensively you'd be crucified for being a baby killer or whatever, because of how they are marketed.   Defensively, the reason not to use the RIP rounds is because you want a round that will mushroom but stay attached to base of the bullet. This maximizes the wound channel. With the RIP rounds, they break off the base and go their separate ways but they don't go as deep as a good hollow point round, meaning that with layers of clothes (think winter) they may not penetrate. If they do, they will most likely cause pain, but not necessarily stop the threat as well as a hollow point."
Glocks,33jozl,silverdynamics,2,Thu Apr 23 04:10:39 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I agree what you said about the RIP rounds, a decent design and everything but it dosent retain the weight of the bullet like most hollow points. I have seen a couple videos of the RIP rounds doing some decent penatration but again not as much as a JHP.   I know you didnt want to get into a debate but do you not like the 40.cal? I just like to hear what other peoples opinions are? And what i can learn from it. By the way, thanks for youe help!"
Glocks,33jozl,silverdynamics,3,Thu Apr 23 04:15:54 2015 UTC,I stopped carrying my G22 gen4 because it was just too big for me to conceal well as well as the snappy recoil of the .40 made it not enjoyable at all to shoot. I wasn't practicing with it nearly enough and began resenting my choice. When my buddy let me try his G19 I fell in love. I did lots of research into ballistics and decided modern defensive ammo in 9mm was every bit as good as .40 so I traded at a local shop and have never looked back. That's not to say .40 is a bad round or the G22 sucks. It just was t right for me.
Glocks,33jozl,silverdynamics,2,Thu Apr 23 15:03:06 2015 UTC,"I see, i dont mind the 40. Recoil. I have a tungsten guid rod in now and that is supposed to reduce recoil but i have not shot it yet with it in so we will see how it works... I have heard it dosent do much but then i have heard it works wonders."
Glocks,33jozl,silverdynamics,5,Thu Apr 23 15:08:59 2015 UTC,"the .40 has marginally better ballistics with modern JHP ammo than a 9mm, with substantially increased recoil and a shorter gun lifespan... believe that sums it up"

Glocks,33jozl,Sh_doubleE_ran,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:20:29 2015 UTC,"I have. I bought it the moment it got released because I knew it would be out of stock before there were any reviews. I prefer to use Federal HST or Speer Gold Dot, but resort to Golden Sabre because Federal HST/Speer Gold Dot is like a unicorn near me and too expensive to buy in bulk. The Gold Dot G2 is my backup. It isn't ideal but is better than nothing."
Glocks,33jozl,Teezytaughtme,2,Thu Apr 23 23:38:55 2015 UTC,"Recently bought Remington Ultimate Defense 124gr just cause the store didnt have what my friend recommended.

Basically just a thin 26 to use in the warmer months or with thinner clothing.  I probably won't see many up here in the northeast, as the 26 is literally double the rounds and still pretty easily concealed with standard weather for the area. Hopefully that means 43's go for cheap to try and keep competition for the shield and Khar single stacks."

Glocks,33ef4w,SandmanGA,2,Wed Apr 22 04:17:31 2015 UTC,Nice pickup. Saving up for that to be a birthday present to myself..
Glocks,33ef4w,Aero_Flash,2,Wed Apr 22 04:32:11 2015 UTC,Good choice. If you can shoot a .40 well you can shoot just about any caliber well. At least IMO..
Glocks,33ef4w,opusrandy,2,Wed Apr 22 04:43:38 2015 UTC,"G23 also my first handgun. Great choice. With the .40 cal glocks, the coolest thing is that you can buy a 9mm barrel and a 9mm magazine and easily turn your G23 into a G19."

Glocks,33d0x3,southeast_boarder,3,Tue Apr 21 16:01:23 2015 UTC,I would still definitely get a Glock 19. It really is the one gun that can do everything well. Use it for a fall/winter carry gun.

Glocks,33d0x3,MK_Ultra86,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:06:36 2015 UTC,I'm still a noob when it comes to stuff so I'm thinking LGS stands for local gun store and in that case I bought it at Park City Tactical in Bpt. Ron is a really nice and super helpful guy. Greyson Guns was going to be getting a few and I know Cabela's said they were getting 3 in they couldn't say when though.
Glocks,33d0x3,albertenstein22,2,Tue Apr 21 20:51:49 2015 UTC,"You'd be correct about the initialism.  Thanks for the info, I definitely want to pick up a 43, but I'll probably wait till the initial demand dies down.  On another note, I finally got into Greysons the othet week and I was very impressed.  It's a great little shop. I'll also have to check out Park City as well i guess."

Glocks,33d0x3,albertenstein22,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:14:06 2015 UTC,Looks like the Glock one to me.  The guns ship with a flush mag and a pinky extension mag.

Glocks,33d0x3,albertenstein22,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:19:46 2015 UTC,"That's the factory Glock mag extension. Ironically, it does not add any additional rounds like the popular +2 Glock mag extension does."

Glocks,33d0x3,albertenstein22,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:27:29 2015 UTC,"The Smith & Wesson Shield uses an extended mag instead of just a floor plate to give you another round. Just food for thought. I love my Glock 19, but I also love my Shield. :)"
Glocks,33d0x3,brbigs,2,Thu Apr 23 16:51:14 2015 UTC,One of my coworkers at the department has a Shield and swears by it. I shot the 9mm version and really liked it. The only reason I am purchasing the 43 is just because it's a Glock.
Glocks,33d0x3,simplegreenvr6,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:17:22 2015 UTC,That's plenty enough reason in my book. Just thought I'd throw that tidbit about the Shield out there. I would like to get the 43 as well. Eventually

Glocks,33fef9,GeneralMaco,4,Wed Apr 22 02:00:41 2015 UTC,"Depends on your size. Some can easily conceal a full-size, some cannot. The G43 would be good for pocket carry or a slimline IWB holster. Grip is good, especially with the grip extension.   Also, ignore Bob. He's an ass."

I love my G22 a bunch, i am just worried about someone seeing it and freaking out by accident. I found out you can conceal at college campus, so that is my plan. But i would hate for someone to see it and assume the worst. I have heard of people concealing the G22 with no problem."

Glocks,33fef9,doitforjimmy,-6,Wed Apr 22 21:18:10 2015 UTC,Huh? It's perfectly fine. How many rounds have you needed in all the gunfights you've been in? What is the average number of rounds in actual fights?

In my experience, people didn't notice because everyone is oblivious. I just recently picked up a Glock 26 for an on duty backup and I carry that with me now.  I enjoy both since they each have their advantages. The only difference I really notice is the weight of them, which is negligible.  A good holster will be your answer to whatever it is you're carrying. Comfort would be number two. If you're comfortable carrying a full-size gun then do it. Practice a lot and go for it."

Glocks,33f0z9,19Kilo,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:12:15 2015 UTC,I'm going to go with gimmicky.  There are a lot of high round count competition guns out there that have been running fine for a long time.  I'm also wary when one of the selling points is to disparage MIM parts.  MIM parts are in pretty much everything and work just fine as long as they're well made.  The issues people have seen have been from companies with notoriously bad QC that likely would have had issues from poorly CNC machined parts.
Glocks,33f0z9,Micks_like_jesus,2,Thu Apr 23 00:08:56 2015 UTC,Strike Industries coming out with something similar but with more lockup

Neighbor had a G26 with almost the same problem and her only fix was to have glock do a warranty exchange. Anything over 4 rounds in the magazine was giving her an insane amount of stoppages and the exact same damage caused to the magazines.
Glocks,33fqsd,RancorUnited,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:58:07 2015 UTC,did they warranty exchange just the mags or the gun as well?
Glocks,33fqsd,BZJGTO,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:02:22 2015 UTC,The dealer exchanged both. The two magazines both had the same shearing damage from what I remember.

It was advertised on Facebook for 454.99 on a local gun store nearby....but it wasn't in stock...anyways, they voluntarily escalated the issue and are looking into the statement to see if it's true. Worst part was, when I called to see if they had one in stock, they told me they did at 449.99.....got there and it was 549.99....so I'm dealing with all that.....even if I don't get reimbursed....still happy with the purchase.

I know that some people carry pepper spray and I wouldn't doubt that there are a few people who carry tazers. However, the school frowns upon self-defense. In a robbery, they advise us to just give them what they want. Screw that, I work hard for the things I have and school is not cheap. You'd figure with all the money students pay for tuition, safety would be more important. If someone tries to rob me here, regardless of if they're armed or not, they don't expect resistance, but I'll guarantee that I'll be the last person they attempt to rob.

Glocks,33b03l,stdalex,3,Tue Apr 21 02:53:28 2015 UTC,"Hi, German here, we can own these without any tax stamps/registration or any other interaction with our government.  I had to make the same decision as you last year and had the opportunity to run every of the mentioned packages. I was most impressed by the build quality of the Hera, the ability to add aftermarket stocks and grips as well it being all metal.  The one big problem I had though, was that it blows out the gas in a very weird way. You are constantly running a cloud of smoke. Others had the same problem as well. Shooting with another Hera were someone dremeled out the vent opening(I have no idea what else to call them) was much more enjoyable as this modifaction solved the problem completely.  http://static.wixstatic.com/media/208058_af246dd78ba750dbb007faaafa3b8435.jpg_srz_p_1280_853_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz   What I mean are these sealed cooling holes for lack of a better term that are already on the Triarii but they do not have any function.  As soon as these are open the Triarii is simply the best choice with absolutely no let downs.  The others are solid systems too but too expensive for plastic in my opinion. They also dont allow for a lot of modifications and the spring on the forward grip of the KPOS was reported to fail after longer intensive use.  The Roni gets points for being more adjustable(cheek riser). I also like the fact that you can store an extra magazine on the stock, makes for quick reloads. There are also proprietary addons like a brass catchting bag for the Roni.  My personal favorite list looks like this:  Hera Triarii http://www.hera-arms.de/#!triarii/c23v3  CAA Roni http://www.caa-il.com/viewproduct.asp?id=267  KPOS http://www.fab-defense.com/en/category-pistol-to-carbine-conversion-kit/id-206/pdw-conversion-kit-for-handgun.html"

I'd go with the G26. It's not really that much bigger than the 43.  I love my G26, never had a single issue with it. The compatibly with G19/G17 mags are great. Single stack isn't that much more of an advantage. Supposedly, it's more reliable, but at the cost of around half the rounds of its double stacked counterpart.  Never had an issue with any of my double stack Glocks. My G27 stovepiped once, but that was my fault. I was trying some different ammunition and limp wristed it on the second shot."
Glocks,33586t,350ZisBae,4,Tue Apr 21 00:39:48 2015 UTC,"Reliability has absolutely nothing to do with why people want a single stack.  It's easier to conceal.  That's it.  Concealing a single stack 9 is much easier than a G26/G19, I've carried and own both.  I love them.  And when I'm able to I carry them.  But for an EDC carry where I live, a Single Stack 9 (a Shield in my case) is more practical for the majority of the year, others feel the same and that's where the ""fanboyism"" comes from."
Glocks,33586t,prill64,0,Sun Apr 19 21:01:02 2015 UTC,"Reliability has absolutely nothing to do with why people want a single stack.   4th post down has a good explanation why.   It's easier to conceal. That's it   The difference is not that much. At all. Maybe only a few millimeters  In my opinion, if you're printing so much with a G26 you think you need a different gun, you're not doing it right."
Glocks,33586t,fadelio,-1,Sun Apr 19 21:58:57 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point. You're right, a single stack magazine will likely feed more reliably than a double stack (although in practice the difference is very small as your link points out), but it still has nothing to do with the recent popularity of Single Stack 9's.    They're popular because there has been an incredible surge in the last decade or so in Concealed Carry with the expansion of shall-issue states.  The small pocket pistol craze started with Kel-Tec in the early 2000's, and all of the other gun makers joined in when they realized the demographic of those carrying concealed has expanded greatly.  There was, and is, a huge demand for small easily concealable guns.  Not everyone feels the need to carry a double stack.   In my opinion, if you're printing so much with a G26 you think you need a different gun, you're not doing it right.   It's not that I can't conceal my G26.  I'm perfectly able to conceal it without printing.  But there are clothes that I can wear and still conceal my Shield that I can't wear and conceal my G26.  If you prefer a G26 there's nothing wrong with that.  It's a great gun.  You're 100% justified in that opinion.  ETA: if I could get my hand on a G43 for a reasonable price I would sell the Shield."

Carrying a Shield vs. a 26 is a huge difference and the 43 has a shorter grip than the Shield. You sound like you're new to carrying. Anyone who says carrying a single stack is no different than a double is a fucktard. Hello fucktard."

I'd say you would be fine drawing as long as you follow the safety rules, however as a LEO and that being your back up if you need it your going to grab it fast and that position may not lend its self well to proper handling. At the same time having to fumble with some sort of trigger guard might be an issue as well. If you practice and train drawing from there you will probably be fine. I carry my 27 on my ankle. That might be an option for you as well??"
Glocks,335xoc,Tru3_B1u3,4,Mon Apr 20 02:17:03 2015 UTC,"Looks like it would snag easily trying to get it out of such a small pocket with someone on top of you.  I am currently in the academy, myself, so I'm just going off of personal thoughts and not experience here, but my personal plan is to pick up a snub-nose .38 Special revolver as my on-vest back-up.  I figure it won't be as slim as a semi-automatic (such as a G42 or G43 or LCP or whatever), but it's not like we're all that worried about printing.  My thought process behind deciding on a revolver is two-fold:  dud round is solved by pulling the trigger again, and I can push it muzzle-to-meat, and so long as the gun will fit between me and them, it'll shoot.  No need to worry about the barrel coming out of battery due to pressure against it, and no need to worry about the gun being too close to me to properly cycle.  Only big flaw I see coming from my idea is the fact I'm limited to five rounds (plan on going with a S&W Model 36 rather than a six-shot Colt Detective Special since I just can't get over the Colt cylinder release).  I figure if I have room to put my thumb on top of the hammer (or at least under the spur), I should be able to draw it without the spur snagging up on something.  If does become a problem, I'll just bob it.  No biggie.  Just some food for thought.  One of our local deputies carries a G42 as his back-up, and every PD officer is issued a G26 for on-duty back-up and their required off-duty carry (assuming they don't have their own firearm), so it's not like a Glock is a bad idea.  Just figured I'd mention something to mention it since it doesn't hurt to have more than one option."

Being against guns and handling them heavily in every episode/film, replicas or not, and not having them would make the entire series/film fall apart -- it just seems crazy to me.   It's like the actor would say, ""I know I've given you many hours of entertainment with all these high quality guns, using them in tons of scenarios and portraying myself as a badass while using them, but don't ever touch them yourself. Don't even own and use them responsibly just for sport or defending your life and the life of loved ones. Seriously, it's bad.

This picture is taking one stupid comment that's easily refuted and pretending it's a mainstream argument. This way they can use a quick one liner and score points rather than having to make a well thought out, fact based argument that might actually help their cause.   When it comes to gun control the Left is just as bad. They take the looniest gun nut they can find and then use the stupid shit they say to score cheap points."

Glocks,3357f7,fernando_69,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:54:32 2015 UTC,I have the 21lb Wolff on a stainless guide rod in my NP3 coated G35 Gen3.  Makes it even softer....still cycles Freedom Reloads.  Slows the slide down nicely....my brass is no longer flung across the range.  The spring weight and slide weight between 9mm and 40 s&w glocks are almost the same even though the 40sw has so much more bolt thrust.  Don't be afraid of getting a heavier spring for that 40....just be careful with really light/cheap range loads with one.

Don't point the camera at a gun just sitting on a table for 10 minutes, at least pick it up and move it around, but more preferably, work in clips from the range while you're doing any table top reviewing. Don't review guns, or anything, unless you have already tested them and can give an actual review."

No intro other than ""hickock45 here"" (usually...) and yet his videos are still hugely popular.  Granted, his style is a bit different than you're probably going for, but the point stands.  I don't know what you've got planned for an intro, but it's definitely something to consider.  However, I say give what you have a try and let people critique it before you go doing too much to it.  It'll be a few episodes in before you start getting the hang of what style you want to stick with and what your early viewers want.

I wouldn't say that I like one over another, but there are certain things I like better in each.  Trigger: Glock. Recoil:  Shield.  Probably due to the extra weight and rubber grips. Sights:  Shield by a mile. Reliability:  If I had to choose one to carry right now Id say Shield, because its been tried and tested, but I'm sure the 43 will be coming up as everything Ive read online has been mostly very positive.

Glocks,32y1eo,Captfluffy556,1 point,Fri Apr 17 23:11:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've never seen a brass shaving buildup like that on any guns I've shot before. At most I would see a couple tiny flakes of brass, but definitely not that much to make a streak. If you're not having reliability issues, then it's probably fine. I would try other ammo manufacturers and see if there's a difference. It also looks like you put grease on the barrel. I would try a light coat of oil instead and see if it makes a difference. The grease may be picking up more shavings than the oil would, but that's still a lot of shavings."

I'd not trust an after market magazine in any Glock being used for self defense.  The savings with these is so minimal, and the risk is far too great.  For use at the range, meh, whatever.  Go ahead and save $5, I guess."
Glocks,32ublu,ZaneMasterX,3,Fri Apr 17 12:30:23 2015 UTC,Metal feed lips in OE mags as well. Sure I'd use a Magpul mag for a trainer mag to drop into the dirt and what not at the range but I'll keep original equipment for daily carry.  Good on Magpul for making this right though!

Glocks,32ublu,Turbostar66,-1,Fri Apr 17 23:36:41 2015 UTC,Not really. The cost to make  those mags (after R & D which will likely be recouped quickly) is probably a few dollars each. Plus this is free good PR and goodwill.

Glocks,32ublu,hi12345654321,0,Fri Apr 17 19:35:10 2015 UTC,Well is a G17 mag so they probably didn't test it enough on 19s and 26s.  Not all gun manufacturers mags are compatible between models.
Glocks,32ublu,AdmiralAckbar86,4,Thu Apr 16 22:36:55 2015 UTC,"That could be the case, but still you would think a company who claims to always be on the leading edge of magazine design would test for the 4 models of Glock that could use the magazine."
Glocks,32ublu,alc6379,2,Thu Apr 16 22:42:59 2015 UTC,I'm somewhat dubious of that. It's widely known that G17 mags fit in the 19 and the 26. It would make good sense for them to have tested with those.
Glocks,32ublu,hi12345654321,-1,Thu Apr 16 23:39:37 2015 UTC,the only thing I can think of is if it works in the 17 it must working the 26 and 19 I mean I would assume that as well
Glocks,32ublu,alc6379,3,Fri Apr 17 00:17:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah but when you're doing R&D for a big product launch, it's safe to not make assumptions.   I don't know where the geometry differs internally in the smaller guns versus the 17, but evidently there's enough of a difference that it matters."

Yes you're only saving $5 (at the moment), but I'd be willing to bet that with time, these drop to the ~$10 range.  I don't see anything wrong with some innovation.  Magpul is a reputable and quality company that I'm sure will make an excellent non-OE magazine.  For CCW (or duty, or playing operator), use OE.  I think this goes for most things glock related. For range fun, nothing wrong with non-OE mags that function properly.  Don't like them, don't buy them.  (Setting up barricade of defective Glock magpul mags to hide from downvotes)"

Glocks,32s8iz,nimoythedestroyer,2,Thu Apr 16 10:55:35 2015 UTC,"The fact it doesn't expand means it will not fail to expand as the hollow points may fail.  Almost all of the hollow points tested by ShootingTheBull410 under penetrated with some failures to expand.  From everything I've read, penetration is very important.  Also the Lehigh did not over penetrate nearly as much as the Ball ammo.  Ball ammo doesn't produce as large of a wound channel either.   Look at the cross section cut from the ShootingTheBull410 vid starting at 7:55.  At 2 inches into the gel, the hollow point's largest wound channel is slightly larger than the Lehigh.  8 inches in, the lehigh is doing ""hollow point style damage"" where the other rounds are hardly damaging more than the diameter of the bullet.  Same at 11 inches in where the other tracks were a pin hole.  That's where the best hollow point he tested stopped in the gel.  He said, the Lehigh Defense rounds ""did make a much bigger damage cavity"" (11:16)."

Glocks,32r2kz,RustyBadger27,0,Thu Apr 16 16:24:17 2015 UTC,"The effective range of a bullet fired into water is reduced to somewhere around 5ft.  In the mythbusters episode about shooting into water, a 9mm round stayed lethal through 7 feet of water, and a 3"" 12ga slug completely destroyed the target through 6 feet of water.  It was smaller bullets, such as the .223, that were essentially disintegrated and retained lethality only through the first 2-3 feet."
Glocks,32r2kz,polishpretzel,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:29:31 2015 UTC,"That... is not right at all. 5 yards of penetration in a material that is 1.5-2 times less dense than ballistics gellatin?   Videos I have seen of intermediate cartridges (like those found in AKs and ARs) the bullet may travel about 4-5 feet before sinking.  Vuurwapen Blog (Andrew Tuohy) has video of a Kimber .45 being shot underwater and the bullet only making about 2-3 feet.   Even Mythbusters (however unscientific their methods may be) has shown that a .50 caliber rifle round, a round that has proven to have an ungodly ability to penetrate things, will pretty much expend all energy by 3 feet in.   It isn't like in Saving Private Ryan where bullets whizz through water like it was air. Water is very dense, and will slow down projectiles significantly. If somebody shot at you while you were underwater, even if you were just 2 yards under the surface, chances are you will remain unscathed."

Glocks,32qns9,776,2,Wed Apr 15 22:56:18 2015 UTC,"Its an ok deal with that additional stuff.  I have one and like it for the most part.  It is soo much easier to carry than my 19 or 27.  I really have no excuse to carry now, were before I did. As far as the .380 I dont know if I wanna go down that road.  Some people say its the smallest you should go others say its too small.  Just research different 380 ammo.  Dont skimp get something that independently reviewed well.  I went with Federal Hydroshock.  HST and gold dot had shitty penetration on the tests I saw.  Poor penetration is the main issue with 380, expansion not as much. Also remember shot placement is more important than caliber. Id rather be shot in the leg with a 45 than the head with a 380."

One of my concerns is the size. I have very large hands, and I've seen the size of it in person but holding it is going to be interesting. I have to see if it's too small."
Glocks,32qns9,stanleyfarnsworth,2,Wed Apr 15 23:26:16 2015 UTC,"Go to the range. Rent a variety. Whatever you are most accurate with, there you go.   (I went to the range thinking Sig. Shot infinitely better with the G19. I bought the Glock.)"
Glocks,32qns9,hi12345654321,2,Wed Apr 15 23:33:36 2015 UTC,Nothing really its big for a 380 but that makes it easier to shoot than the other 380's.  I have small hands so its not an issue.  You might want to get a grip extension. Also check out magguts.com They sell a low profile mag follower that allows you to add an extra round.  I have shot 200 rounds through the mag I use it on with no problem.
Glocks,32qns9,nuktakupaya,2,Thu Apr 16 00:04:25 2015 UTC,"I have a G42 I carry daily. As I also have large hands, I found the Pearce grip extension to be excellent for getting a proper hold.   I run FMJs in mine. That's a point of personal preference; I had been running JHPs but an instructor friend of mine said to stick with FMJ. All personal preference."
Glocks,32qns9,Aero_Flash,2,Wed Apr 15 23:38:38 2015 UTC,"I have a G42 and love it. I read that you have big hands, hold both a 42 AND 26 before making your decision. A G26 is a 9mm, but it has a thicker grip for you to get more hand skin on there. If you don't have a good grip for control you can't shoot as accurate. You just have to remember when you carry you can't wear tight clothes, they have to be a little loose so you don't print.    Keep asking questions! We're here to help."

Glocks,32qns9,r3bman,2,Thu Apr 16 17:23:40 2015 UTC,"I don't believe a .380 is a good defensive round personally. As for your size id go with a glock 26/27 they are smaller but carry the 9mm(26) and .40(27). Really you need to hold them if you can shoot them.  How do you plan to carry? Used guns, well if you're looking at Glocks they can take a ton of neglect. Most used ones are law enforcement trade-ins at least in my area. With that you can take comfort that they have been kept up but the departments armorer. Officers are not allowed to work on service weapons. If you end up looking at the glock 26/27 and it is a police buyback it will probably be just fine to buy. Those are usually backup guns and very rarely shot except for qualification. Hope this helps."
Glocks,32qns9,prill64,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:44:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I'll definitely check those out tomorrow. That's what worried me about Glocks, I hear of people who say they never lubricate or clean them so I didn't know if I should be checking for tell tale signs of premature wear or abuse. Money isn't too much of an issue, so I'll likely buy new."

Glocks,32or4p,LinkKarmaIsLame,2,Thu Apr 16 00:29:51 2015 UTC,"I would find a replacement spring kit and familiarize yourself with your new gun. A Glock is pretty simple to detail strip and it sounds like you have a buddy who can help out if you run into trouble. I would take that thing apart, replace the springs, give it a good cleaning, lube her up and take her to the range. As far as upgrades, I can't say enough about the Glock - trigger bar. should give you around a 4 lb trigger pull. If you are feeling adventurous, polishing the internal contact surfaces combined with the new trigger bar gives a butter smooth pull just make sure you read up on it, maybe watch a video. It doesn't take much to make the trigger nearly perfect"

Just my 2 cents I think its a decent trade, he should have a third mag. Your holster will work with the 19 obviously. Depends on the holster if its a big deal to throw it in or not to the other guy.

Glocks,32p1er,FullFiguredRhino,6,Wed Apr 15 16:24:30 2015 UTC,What does the size of the slide matter?
Glocks,32p1er,tuccified,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:42:57 2015 UTC,I would like an answer to this as well. I would assume that all Glock sights fit in all Glock guns. That would be really stupid on their part from a manufacturing standpoint to make all the sights a different size.
Glocks,32p1er,FullFiguredRhino,2,Wed Apr 15 18:00:57 2015 UTC,Typically when you look for Glock sights they are separated by large and small frame size.
Glocks,32p1er,rainy0days,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:10:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand that they are separated by the size of the slide. I want to know why they feel the need to differentiate sights by slide size."
Glocks,32p1er,FullFiguredRhino,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:51:10 2015 UTC,POI changes with the sight radius.
Glocks,32p1er,rainy0days,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:11:55 2015 UTC,How does a change in POI change what size the sight has to be to fit into the dovetail?
Glocks,32p1er,FullFiguredRhino,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:20:29 2015 UTC,"Are we talking about the size of the slide, or the size of the dovetail? I might've misunderstood what you guys were talking about."
Glocks,32p1er,rainy0days,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:22:39 2015 UTC,I guess at this point I don't really know. I was curious as to why they make the distinction between sights and what the difference in the sights are when the distinction is made. Are they just taller?
Glocks,32p1er,rainy0days,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:31:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, the fronts would get taller as the slide gets longer. Typically everything from the 26 to the 17 have the same height front sight, but some people like to fine tune it. However the long slides will almost always have a taller front. I don't have a 42, but I'm pretty sure some companies were making 42 specific front sights to compensate.   The slide width would also make the rear sight fit differently. If you put a full size rear sight into a 42, it would overhang on the sides. The dovetail cut is the same though I believe."
Glocks,32p1er,southeast_boarder,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:41:54 2015 UTC,"Longer sight radius will slightly change the height of the sights you need. For example most long slide Glocks need a taller front sight(usually a .235 when using a .250 rear), whereas a G17 and G19 would usually use a .215 front.  The length of the 43/42 slides is probably close enough that POI doesn't change much with the same height front sight, similar to how the G19 and G17 use the same front."

Glocks,32mkxl,muffinman92x,2,Sat Apr 25 05:51:03 2015 UTC,Tape and marker. Be careful when using lube. You're only supposed to lube the slide rails and that's only once every thousand rounds / 1 year. Glocks are low/no lubricant guns and can easily be damaged with lube getting where it's not supposed to be. I usually don't suggest but in this case read the owners manual when you get the gun. I would also leave any cleaning products at home. You don't really need to clean your glock either every time you shoot. I usually only clean mine every 400-500 rounds. Watch hickcocks video on cleaning glocks.  If I was going to carry a tool it would be a small punch tool to work on the mags.

Some people like to say it helps them rip out mags, or that it lets debris fall out. It's not hard to grip and rip the baseplate of a Glock mag(easier than wedging your thumb in a tiny hole at least), and the idea that the gun will fail without a drain hole for debris is ridiculous."
Glocks,32ng3a,rainy0days,2,Wed Apr 15 05:10:55 2015 UTC,"When a cadet's G22 Glocknaded after qualifications, he was glad it had that ""drain hole"" as it helped redirect some of the gases from the catastrophic malfunction."
Glocks,32ng3a,JakesGunReviews,2,Wed Apr 15 05:14:23 2015 UTC,"If it is being redirected, it is alleviating stress on the frame since gases take the path of least resistance, so yes.  It ejected the magazine from the weapon, so it had plenty of space to send gases, no doubt."

Glocks,32ng3a,rainy0days,0,Wed Apr 15 05:35:17 2015 UTC,"Any reason why you think that hole had any positive effect, or are you just guessing that something bad would've happened if it wasn't there?   If drain holes were even remotely necessary, more guns would have them."
Glocks,32ng3a,rainy0days,-3,Wed Apr 15 05:38:33 2015 UTC,"It will help redirect gases in the event of a catastrophic malfunction, it will allow water/debris to exit the handgun with the help of gravity, and it will help remove non-drop-free magazines.  Is it all necessary?  No, but you'll be glad you have it, and it lightens the handgun that much more.  If removing material gives me at least three viable features, I don't see why that design choice shouldn't have been made.  Would something terrible-bad have happened to him if that vent wasn't there?  Probably not since the magazine catch sheared and the magazine was ejected.  However, the vent being there still could have made it less worse than it could have been, even if by only a miniscule amount."
Glocks,32ng3a,JakesGunReviews,2,Wed Apr 15 05:36:30 2015 UTC,"Face it, nothing would've happened even if it was plugged. If there was somehow enough pressure that something would happen, it would simply blow the plug out just as easy as it blew the mag out. If it was filled from the factory, gas would leave from somewhere else.   And you really think a fraction of an ounce of polymer would make even a remote difference? Never mind the fact that many people tend to add weight to the lower halves of polymer guns anyway for better control.   Edit: Not going to address the magazine thing again as I've already mentioned it in my first comment. Time yourself stripping mags both ways and see which is faster and more consistent."

Chamber was cracked down its length on both sides, barrel bulged slightly, and I think there was some other internal damage.

Majority of the gases were redirected through the bottom of the grip and magazine well, however."

Glocks,32ng3a,base935,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:32:34 2015 UTC,"I never said their hands were saved solely by the gap.  I have only ever stated that it likely helped redirect some of the gases.  Malfunction is believed to be bullet set-back from a factory FMJ round, Gen. 2 G22."

Glocks,32ng3a,G19Gen3,5,Wed Apr 15 05:48:38 2015 UTC,"I believe it, and here is why, as explained by my friend whose job is to study terminal ballistics and trauma on the human body:   The ""maximum"" Overall length of .40 S&W being 1.135in/28.83mm, it generates, with a 180gr projectile, about 27.2K PSI.  When at the ""minimum"" OAL of .40 S&W, which is 1.080in/27.56mm it generates about 35-37K PSI.  But if that bullet is seated just .05in/1.27mm deeper, that pressure, again, with a 180gr bullet, goes to 39.6K PSI.  If that bullet is seated to an OAL of 1.05in/26.67mm, its pressure is now 50,954 PSI, which is well in excess of SAAMI specs, and within a range where you are no longer safe.  But just for shits and giggles, lets go on.  At 1.04in/26.42mm, you generate 58K PSI. At 1.03in/26.16mm, you generate 66.9K PSI At 1.02in/25.9mm, you generate 80K PSI At 1.01in/25.65mm, you generate 101K PSI And at 1 inch/25.4mm, you generate an amazing 138.7K PSI  By dropping the projectile (180gr) a mere .135in/3.42mm, you generate pressures to a level just under four times in excess of the maximum safety regulation. Certainly, this is well outside the maximum safety range and likely would not occur in ammunition plants, but I have no doubts that it is possible for the oddball round to have just a slight slip. Thus putting its pressure to the 50 and 60K range, effectively turning your gun into a pipe bomb.  I'm sure Glock knows this and has made their guns to a level at which they can safely ""contain"" the explosive power up to a certain point, but theirs a kick back: As guns go on, they, like other tools, wear out. Metal expands, parts start to age or weaken. I think this is a case of out-of-spec ammunition and continuous strain on the weapon: Maybe not to contribute anything meaningful, but just enough that the gun was not able to fully contain the power of the blast.   Believe it or not, bullet set-backs increase pressure imparted upon firing.  Considering the firearm in question was a Glock 22 Gen. 2 that had seen thousands upon thousands of rounds (previously a Highway Patrolman's duty gun before being sold to the cadet), I can see how this is possible, especially when the previous round exited the barrel and hit the steel plate he had been shooting at."

They soften up and provide a less brittle material.  You'll see less of the bullet just exploding and more gelatin-like expansion.  Also, as I was shooting them from pretty much point blank ranges, it left quite the big, smoking/steaming hole, and who doesn't like a nice steamy hole?  Penetration, at least in my experience, didn't increase greatly, as long as the books weren't over-soaked (once the paper turns back to pulp, you're basically shooting oatmeal).  I have some neat little Speer Gold Dot projectiles that flowered out all nicely around here somewhere.  I'll post pictures of them if I can find them.   It should be pointed out, however, that there's a reason ballistics research isn't conducted in wet paper.  Make sure you don't mistake the results with what you should expect in flesh."

I was butt hurt after buying the mags because I saw a coupon for $5 off right after I ordered them, but didn't want to cancel the order because they were selling out fast the other day. Oh well.  The magazines seem to be very sturdy for their all polymer construction, not that I am worried about this being a problem with reliability as others are. I am, however, a little disappointed that the magazines only have a full magazine indicator (you only know when the magazine is loaded to 17 rounds) unlike the OEM mags that show round count to 4 rounds.  After messing around with them for a while, I have found that they are drop free and do not have an issue locking back the slide on my Glock 22 (since I don't have my 17 yet). As obvious as it should be, the PMAGs polymer construction makes the magazine lighter than the OEM magazines.  Something else to note is the time stamp on the mags. You probably can't see it from the potato pics I posted, but the timestamp on the magazines themselves are February 2014. Is it normal for the timestamp to be made over 1 year before a product is released? What is even more interesting is that the floor plates are stamped March 2015. Can someone explain?

Glocks,32hieo,kengorecore,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:12:48 2015 UTC,"I haven't had any problems with the 3 I bought for my G17. Granted, I haven't put a ton of rounds through them yet either."
Glocks,32hieo,Duron1984,0,Tue Apr 14 01:41:32 2015 UTC,Mine hasnt had many rounds through it either. My G34 just is not a fan of it. Doesnt lock the slide back on the last round ( also partly me and my thumb liking to rest of the slide stop) and it never holds a full mag. I know it is a 17 rounder but it only ever holds 11 or 12. It probably just needs to be broken in.
Glocks,32jlte,imNoobSorry,9,Tue Apr 14 09:06:29 2015 UTC,"IMO, one of the best concealed carry Glocks out there is the Glock 19 (9mm) and/or Glock 23 (.40 cal). Easy to conceal and carries 15 rounds per magazine."
Glocks,32jlte,edb_ok,1 point,Tue Apr 14 12:05:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely would suggest either the 19 or 23. My personal preference is for my 30, but I run with 21 mags for 13+1 capacity, but the .45ACP isn't everyone's best choice for everyday carry. If you are a larger person as I am, you may consider it though."
Glocks,32jlte,TehCourtJester,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:17:12 2015 UTC,The 30 is a good choice as well but I never carry mine due to the mag size...which you may have just solved for me.  Off to order a 21 mag or two now :)

Glocks,32jlte,edb_ok,2,Wed Apr 15 08:53:20 2015 UTC,"I've not shot or held the 320 but from everything I've read/heard, it is a very good contender.   The only thing I don't like about the 320 is the high bore axis when compared to the G19 but that could be a very minor point (and maybe it means nothing at all once you shoot it)."
Glocks,32jlte,bacon_alarm_clock,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:52:41 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't like the ""beavertail"" spur on the p320. It seemed like it would catch on clothing if you carried it concealed. YMMV"
Glocks,32jlte,Good2Go5280,6,Wed Apr 15 14:46:27 2015 UTC,G19 or G26.
Glocks,32jlte,theTXpanda,3,Tue Apr 14 14:12:37 2015 UTC,I couldn't recommend the Glock 19 enough. Absolutely love it. I'm not going to tell you it's the end all be all or the absolute best option. But it's perfect for me and seems like it fits all of your needs.
Glocks,32jlte,wecanseeyou,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:09:22 2015 UTC,"Glock 19 all day every day for this purpose.   9mm for controllability over .40  9mm for capacity (and sufficient power with proper JHP) G19 has more capacity than G26 G19 has normal grip profile without mag extensions Based on stated needs, additional capacity seems prudent"
Glocks,32jlte,JakesGunReviews,4,Tue Apr 14 15:26:39 2015 UTC,"A Glock 26 with a finger-extension floorplate would give you a subcompact gun that all fingers can fit on with a capacity of just over ten rounds.  A Glock 19 would be slightly larger, but will have a capacity of 15+1 and not need extended floorplates."

Glocks,32jlte,C-LOgreen,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:38:12 2015 UTC,"Came by to suggest the glock 19. I don't own one myself, but I have a glock 17 that I really like (it's a larger version of the 19). But it's mostly for range/HD use. For carry,  I'd pick the 19 for your situation over smaller, easier to carry guns, as the larger capacity could be useful.   I'm of the opinion that if you only ever want to buy one handgun, it should be a glock 19."
Glocks,32jlte,bacon_alarm_clock,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:08:50 2015 UTC,"19 or 23 or 21. The glock 19 has a capacity of 15, while the 23 and 21 has a 13 rd capacity. This is the best if u need to conceal but still want  a good capacity"

Being that this is a 42, that means it's a defensive gun. I wouldn't deviate from factory recoil assemblies. The two most common things people change that cause Glocks to malfunction are aftermarket recoil assemblies, and aftermarket strikers/springs."
Glocks,32gegj,rainy0days,6,Mon Apr 13 17:25:08 2015 UTC,"There's going to be little to no noticeable difference   Bingo.  On top of that it's tungsten, so if it gets whacked wrong it's liable to shatter.    I'm not 100% against replacing the guide rod... I put a SS one with a heavier spring in my G23 and it does actually make a difference in felt recoil.  But changing it out on the 42 seems like pretty silly given how light of a round the .380 is."
Glocks,32gegj,cosmos7,3,Mon Apr 13 17:38:47 2015 UTC,"I put one in my gen 4 g19 before I actually even fired it, so I can't speak on the difference in recoil, but I haven't had any malfunctions yet.

Anyways I'm a sucker for new mods and I keep all the factory parts.  edit:  I put an inquiry in to the glockstore asking if it would also fit the g43 since the 26/27 ones are compatible."

Glocks,32duz3,nimoythedestroyer,8,Mon Apr 13 14:34:38 2015 UTC,It comes from instructors with 30 plus years of firearms training experience at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in training for real world application. Grip is still extremely important they just found most issues with 100 of thousands of students they train come from trigger control.
Glocks,32duz3,hi12345654321,0,Mon Apr 13 16:12:29 2015 UTC,They have to use techniques that allow for the least common denominator to shoot decently because I'd the volume of students they have to train just like the army. In terms of best technique they usually lag way behind the competition side of marksmanship and there is a tricks down effect eventually getting to law enforcement. There are many articles and well respected people who have spoke  about this like Travis Hailey among others.
Glocks,32duz3,dasReaper,14,Mon Apr 13 20:49:35 2015 UTC,Grip is important. Trigger control is more importanter.

While admittedly a more advanced technique, a stronger grip helps to prevent heeling of the gun, trigger jerking, and recoil anticipation in shooters."
Glocks,32duz3,chickenzomby,5,Mon Apr 13 09:40:18 2015 UTC,"Pretty new to firing semi automatic handguns (less than 6 months). How many of you incorporate this style grip with your non trigger hand versus the standard hand over hand, thumb over thumb style grip?"

Glocks,32duz3,konoplya,1 point,Mon Apr 13 07:36:58 2015 UTC,"His elbows are almost but not quite locked. They flair out the way they do because he's using his chest, back, and shoulder muscles to apply pressure at the top of the firearm.  Think of trying to snap a twig in half."

I've taken a class with him and his recoil management skill makes him accurate and fast.  I still use a modified but very similar form of grip to his and it improved my shooting dramatically.

Glocks,32duz3,jmiszal,1 point,Mon Apr 13 09:32:29 2015 UTC,I grip similar to this but my forefinger is usually on the front of the trigger guard and nothing touches my index finger from my off hand. Feels ok and helps mitigate recoil atleast in my untrained view.

Glocks,32homy,LambastingFrog,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:52:45 2015 UTC,"The recoil spring supplements the inertia of the slide's mass and helps to keep everything in battery for the appropriate amount of time after the round is fired, as well as slowing the slide's momentum before it reaches the rearward end of its travel.   Think of it like this: if you had no spring, the slide would go out of battery far too early (before pressure dropped to a safe level) and the slide would move violently rearward. If you had a spring that was extremely heavy (for the sake of hypotheticals, 100lbs), the action wouldn't even open. Similarly, a slide made out of fairy dust and unicorn farts would need a heavier spring to moderate its acceleration than the same slide made out of, say, tungsten, which is much more dense."
Glocks,32homy,Engelmacher,1 point,Tue Apr 14 06:34:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I'd never considered the spring to be anything other than the means by which to close the action once it's been blown open. So, the next question would be how you know what weight of spring to choose for a lightened slide. Do you know how to do that?"
Glocks,32homy,LambastingFrog,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:13:41 2015 UTC,Don't buy just one spring. Pick up a 13lbs and 15lbs spring at the minimum. I really like the ISMI springs but Wolff are good too. Pick up a stainless guide rod too.
Glocks,32homy,Engelmacher,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:23:20 2015 UTC,"At this stage, I have done no slide work. I have a slide that's going for slide work when my fund builds up after paying surprise taxes this year. I was debating lightening it, but I didn't make up my mind on it because I didn't know enough about it.  So far, what I understand is that a lighter reciprocating mass means that it'll move faster, and so cycle faster, and be slightly lighter to carry. I'll need a heavier spring, for the reasons in /u/scubaguybill's comment above.  What I don't understand is what other effects I'll have, and whether the change is useful for me, or just to top shooters and I should not bother spending that money."
Glocks,32homy,LambastingFrog,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:35:19 2015 UTC,"If it's just for a carry gun, I honestly wouldn't bother. You aren't trying to shave milliseconds off your split times or anything and I personally think the money would be better spent on more range practice ammo, training class, beer, pizza, or similar.  If you are double tapping and you feel like you are waiting for your guns slide to return to battery, slide lightening will be of help to you. Beyond that, I haven't really noticed much change in my g35 zev dragonfly slide. The weight reduction isn't really noticeable in a holster to me, and I don't think it really speeds up my transition times. It does look cool as hell and does speed up your cyclic time. But it's up to the individual to notice the faster cycle rate.  Oh, one other benefit, your muzzle will dip less when the slide returns to battery as well. It's like running an 11lbs recoil spring, but less sluggish since the spring weight is heavier, just less mass slamming forwards and downwards."

Glocks,32c6xb,jfail,2,Sun Apr 12 17:28:25 2015 UTC,"Raven. I have the vanguard ii and am in love. If you're carrying a 19, the minimalist-ness of it is incredible."
Glocks,32c6xb,thenatureboy_,2,Sun Apr 12 20:06:20 2015 UTC,Does the Vanguard 2 come loose or does the pistol slide around in your waistband any? Does it tilt?  And is the minimalist-ness comfortable? What position do you carry at?
Glocks,32c6xb,dmuns,2,Mon Apr 13 00:58:35 2015 UTC,"Appendix. Nope, it doesn't come loose, it is really comfortable. It only moves as much as you would want it to (for sitting down and whatnot). It's as sturdy as your belt is."

If that particular part were poorly made and fail in such a way as to have the front portion be severely chipped off you could have a round open the action before the pressures are to safe enough levels and I know I don't like the idea of 35,000 psi being released in a manner that was not predicted."

Glocks,32a2hs,RyanBDawg,5,Sun Apr 12 05:00:27 2015 UTC,It depends a lot on the holster you're using. I've tried carrying my G19 appendix with a very simple kydex holster and it was so painful that I had to excuse myself from dinner to adjust my gun. If I use a hybrid holster (either a CompTac MTAC or Infidel Ultra) then I just feel leather and it's very comfortable.

New Glocks are meant to be fired out of the box with the factory grease. Otherwise a good general rule of thumb is, DON'T OVER LUBRICATE!!!

Also Kopper-Kote (Jet-Lube), as this is what is on the weapon from the factory and goes nicely on the rail points on the slide.

You'll get a thousand different answers based on who you ask.  Personally, for my Glocks I have been using a bore snake with Hoppe's #9 to clean the inside of the barrel.  For the outside of the barrel and inside the slide, I wipe away as much residue as I can with paper towels and Q-tips, then lightly mist them with MPro-7 cleaner and wipe again, repeating until I feel they are clean enough.  The frame rails and sear assembly get the same treatment.  I use an old toothbrush with more Hoppe's #9 to scrub off the feed ramp, then dry everything and lubricate with FrogLube according to this chart.  This is basically how I clean all my semi-auto pistols, obviously different kinds of guns need different methods."
Glocks,3295ix,GoodGuyGlocker,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:21:32 2015 UTC,Congrats on getting a Glock!  You chose wisely.  Glocks are among the easiest guns to maintain IMO.  This is due to their design and low number of parts. Glocks also run dirty and dry without complaining.  There's just no degradation of functionality or reliability after 500 or 1000 rounds. Some people run them thousands of rounds between cleaning without a problem.  Try that with some other pistols. The only downside is that Glocks will spoil you and make you lazy.

Quite strange when you think about it.  I'm guessing that he had to get liability insurance or lack of it, because of the people coming to shoot on his range invited from youtube videos?

Glocks,326okd,Zerv14,12,Sat Apr 11 15:10:34 2015 UTC,"Ensure your gun is unloaded:  remove the magazine and any live ammunition in it.  Go ahead and pull the slide back.  You will see that the piece of metal in that ""dip"" actually hooks into the interior part of the slide.  It is the extractor.  This is the part that holds the casing of the round while it is being chambered, fired, and removed upon firing.  Upon firing, the slide will move back, and the extractor will, as well, for obvious reasons (it is installed in the slide).  This pulls the casing (fired round) out of the chamber since the barrel remains more or less stationary.  Once the slide goes so far back, another piece, the ejector, hits the back-end of the casing, causing it to be sling-shotted out of the grasp of the extractor.  It is sling-shotted because the extractor is spring-loaded (this makes sure it can hold the cartridge in place when feeding/extracting), and when the ejector hits the back of the casing, it flexes the extractor out slightly when the casing is thrown from the firearm.  Here is a slow-mo shot of a Glock cycling:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DBYFLe2eg  You can also look at this at your own pace by buying some snap-caps (dummy cartridges that are painted bright red and used for dry-firing) and cycling the gun by-hand.  You will see how the cartridge slowly gets pushed up underneath the extractor when coming out of the magazine, and then you will see what all it does up to ejection of the cartridge when you pull the slide back slowly.    DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS WITH LIVE AMMUNITION  If possible, keep all your ammunition in a separate room when cleaning/dry-firing/inspecting your firearm."
Glocks,326okd,heathenyak,2,Sat Apr 11 02:09:08 2015 UTC,That's what I was wondering. Lots of small grooves there. Maybe an arrow to differentiate the one small groove in question from the others...

Glocks,326okd,f0rcedinducti0n,5,Sat Apr 11 01:35:55 2015 UTC,"That piece is called the extractor depressor plunger. It's a long piece of metal that is under spring tension. Here's the other end of the depressor plunger with the spring visible: http://glockparts.com/uiimages/10010/EDP.JPG  As you can see, you can remove it after you remove the slide baseplate at the rear of the slide.  The depressor plunger is applying pressure to the extractor (the piece on the right), which is a part that grabs the rim of the shell casing and helps fling the empty brass out of the gun during firing."

I must admit I am impressed and stoked as this is a really a high quality piece. I don't have a CCW but I will defiantly (ironic misspelling: http://www.nndb.com/people/753/000025678/tori-spelling.jpg) use it at home and on my buddy's ranch and such.   I wasn't ready for the awesomeness combo smell of gun oil and leather. I don't think anyone is really, but DAMN!  Breaking it in was a bit of a process, but after a couple days jiggling the gun wrapped in some plastic bags, and a couple days just letting it sit in the holster it feels perfect now. The position at 4 o'clock is dead on for my old semi-fatness too.   If I did CCW this is probably what I would use, as I am not a fan of IWB holsters. Either way though this is a damn nice holster.

Glocks,3233ck,TXRazorback,3,Fri Apr 10 15:58:45 2015 UTC,To me there's no need in the full size. Hardly any longer of a barrel and the extra frame length makes it harder to conceal.
Glocks,3233ck,duckmuffins,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:53:02 2015 UTC,Yes 17 is not easy to conceal. It's great for all around shooting though. I'm debating between the 19 or 26 for ccw
Glocks,3233ck,Good2Go5280,2,Fri Apr 10 18:33:21 2015 UTC,For all around full size goodness I have a VP9. I would say look at the 19 since if you have holsters for the 17 the 19 will fit but the 26 might not. I can't shoot my 27 nearly as well as I shoot with my 23 that extra length for the grip makes a nice difference.
Glocks,3233ck,Moscamst,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:04:48 2015 UTC,I would use the grip extensions if I got the 26. I would prefer something small even though I'm a good sized dude
Glocks,3233ck,ElBomberoLoco,2,Fri Apr 10 21:45:13 2015 UTC,I like the size of the 27 but don't care much for the thickness.

Glocks,3233ck,ElBomberoLoco,2,Fri Apr 10 23:50:10 2015 UTC,"Make sure you try and shoot the 26 with the grip extension before you buy one. I have a 27 with a pierce grip extension for my CCW, works great but there's a slight gap were the extension on the magazine and the frame meet and I've found that it pinches my finger when I shoot. Its not a huge problem in my opinion but it is annoying when training."

Glocks,3233ck,bmdaia,5,Fri Apr 10 15:54:30 2015 UTC,19 is best Glock.
Glocks,3233ck,bmdaia,2,Fri Apr 10 15:30:15 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you want to get out of either firearm.  The G19 is arguably one of the most versatile pistols out there.  It's small enough to CCW, big enough to shoot a lot of rounds comfortably, 9mm is cheap to shoot....  .45 is a lot of fun to shoot too.  It is markedly more expensive to shoot, though.  You need a decent amount of practice & training to shoot .45 for accuracy (not impossible by any means, but harder than 9mm).  The G30 is a sub-compact, so it's smaller.  It's made for CCW.  It's not really an apples-to-apples comparison so it really comes down to personal preference and expected use.  But they're both Glocks....so it's not like either choice will be a bad decision."

I would rather go for the Glock 30S with the thinner slide but that is me. Both guns are great, accurate, etc. For carry of the two you listed above I would go for the Glock 19 but so long as you can deal with the Thickness of the Glock 30 Gen 4 both are fine choices"
Glocks,3233ck,InfiniteWalrus,1 point,Fri Apr 10 14:25:18 2015 UTC,"30S, hands down.   Also they don't offer the 30S in 4th Gen, at least glock doesn't offer it in their purchase program.  --/u/SnakeDoctor00    Snake, the reason they don't offer it in a Gen 4 is because it already has the important part of a Gen 4, the dual recoil spring assembly.  The 30S was developed in a collaboration with the LAPD SIS division as a special request.  After much demand, Gold sold it to public.  It's a franken-Glock made of many different parts.  A G36 slide, G30 magazine, G30SF frame, Gen 4 recoil springs, etc etc. It has the RTF texturing because this is what the SIS units wanted.  RTF 2 had been out for a few years, and the SIS was not fond of it.  So, Glock will not be putting RTF 2 or RTF 3 on the 30S in the future.    There will not be a Gen4 30S.  It was made exactly to LAPD SIS specifications."
Glocks,3233ck,southernbenz,1 point,Fri Apr 10 23:22:45 2015 UTC,My main goal is to get a 4th gen because I have 3rd gens already and with my discount it would be more beneficial to get a Gen 4. I'm gonna compare the 30 with a 19 next time at work.

Also am I correct in assuming that there is no G30SF gen4 because the changable backstraps make the short frame unnecessary   Yes, the Gen4 grip without any backstraps is basically a short frame.

I think you will like it. It isn't the kind of gun that you take to the range and plink with round after round after hundreds of rounds, but that's also not its purpose. I'd argue that you should use it to practice with so you are proficient, but it's true purpose is for concealment in difficult concealment situations, e.g. running, or perhaps in places where it is imperative that your concealed handgun never becomes visible (like in NoVA where anti-gunners might try to SWAT you)."

I'm just flying into DC and making sure we spend a lot of time there, so that's why I made it my point of reference.  Yeah, those types of guns are definitely not plinkers. But even with practice, I could never get proficient with the p3at. Namely because the sights sucked ass and the recoil just wasn't managable. I'd hit probably 2-3 out 6 in a quick-sight style of shooting, which is my preferred way of practicing the self-defense shots.  The p238 on the otherhand, I have the easiest time in the world bringing it up from low ready to a quick sight picture and hitting center mass.  I guess it came down to confidence really. And the p3at gave me absolutely none."

Glocks,31zxat,icantcontrolmyself,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:12:01 2015 UTC,"you can actually do either but for running, i wear the underarmor tights under my shorts and tuck the remora into the tights. The remora is a sticky holster and the material will grip your skin and clothing even when it is wet. as long as the tights have enough tension to keep the gun next to your body you are ok. I usually wear my gun a little lower than normal to make extra sure it doesn't flop out When you are done, and this is important, take the gun out of the holster and wipe it down with an oily rag because the sites and controls will rust. Even my stainless slide has some rust marks. The holster will be wet most likely so I only use that holster for the duration of the run and no other time so the gun isn't sitting in a wet corrosive environment"

Glocks,320tsc,SquirrelySquirrels,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:42:06 2015 UTC,10.  I noticed some material on the sides of the mag being messed up and interfering with the follower so I filed it down so it's smooth now.    It's definitely not my grip because the gun locks up and I have to release the mag for the slide to drop and at the same time it loads the top round and drops the mag.  So I think it's a FTF problem due to the mags.
Glocks,320tsc,marmaladejackson,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:03:25 2015 UTC,"My malfunctions were with the 10 round mags as well. I replaced my slide release and switched to 17 round mags, and have had zero malfunctions. I have yet to test the 10 round mags after the slide release replacement, so the magazines could have contributed to the problem. I would contact Glock directly as I'm sure they're aware of the issue."
Glocks,320tsc,OffensiveWords,4,Sun Apr 12 18:30:05 2015 UTC,Same thing was happening to me on a G29.  Paid careful attention to my grip while I was shooting and noticed that one of my thumbs was ever so slightly nudging the slide lock causing it to hold open every 15 rounds or so.  Changed my grip and haven't had a problem since.
Glocks,320tsc,OffensiveWords,2,Fri Apr 10 04:35:21 2015 UTC,How many rounds through it? Could be a worn out magazine spring or could be the ammo and/or feed ramp causing it not to fully feed the round.

Glocks,320tsc,Miiilooo,2,Thu Apr 9 18:46:44 2015 UTC,"Start with easy stuff. Try different ammo. Look for marks on the feed ramp. Look for gunk in the frame rails. If a newer mag solves it, then it's just the mag spring. If there's a lot of gunk, give it a good cleaning and apply less lube. If it's ammo, polish the feed ramp up and use different ammo.   Scratch that, just reread what you wrote and saw the slide stop is engaging. Look for gunk around the slide stop or any other reason why the slide stop will be pushed up. Sounds like the follower is somehow riding on the slide stop lever. So either the lever isn't sitting right or the magazine is the issue."
Glocks,320tsc,EJNorth,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:53:14 2015 UTC,"I had a similar problem and one day while disassembling my slide stop broke. I replaced it, they are like $5. The problem stopped.

Glocks,321tze,Tarnsman4Life,2,Fri Apr 10 13:18:38 2015 UTC,"The thought has crossed my mind as well. I have 5 9mm pistols and I get cranky when I can't feed them. Luckily I reload 9mm now so as long as I stock up on powder, primers, brass, and projectiles I should be ok."
Glocks,321tze,blandusernameftw,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:16:37 2015 UTC,"During the shortage the only two handgun calibers I seemed to be able to find with any kind of frequency was 40 S&W and 10MM.  There was always shotgun sheets, especially Birdshot to be had as well.   I want to pick up a RIA 10MM 1911 and something in 40 S&W just to have; I stopped shooting for over 9 months due to the shortage and not wanting to pay double what the ammo I was shooting cost to replace it."
Glocks,321tze,Tarnsman4Life,2,Fri Apr 10 19:34:15 2015 UTC,I picked up a Gen3 G22 from AIM Surplus for about $310 in December. Police trade in with night sights.
Glocks,321tze,nuktakupaya,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:20:00 2015 UTC,"Gen 3's? Normally PD trade ins show a lot of wear but aren't really shot a lot. Each one is different so sort through it like any used gun. $440 isn't a bad price necessarily but it could be better. If it comes with all of the factory stuff, it's not bad. Not sure where you're located but I can normally find better condition gen 3's with a few extra for $450-475 private party."
Glocks,321tze,OffensiveWords,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:30:20 2015 UTC,"Depends on the agency. We shot 2,000 rounds through are glocks at the academy and then shoot 4 times a year after that. I imagine at the end of my glocks service life it will be beat up pretty bad."
Glocks,321tze,silentsnipe21,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:37:48 2015 UTC,"I would look around a bit first. I purchased my Gen 3 G23 for $390 after all the fees. Doing some homework may save you fifty dollars, which is extra ammo! Best of luck though, I love my .40"
Glocks,321tze,ChubbsMcFisty,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:19:50 2015 UTC,"I have to steer you away from the full size. Go compact or longslide for a little more.  also, you can swap barrels out of any .40 glock and shoot .357 sig!"

Glocks,31y8iu,brokenseattle,3,Thu Apr 9 03:02:51 2015 UTC,Welcome to the best EDC Glock they make. (I carry a G4 35) You're going to love it.
Glocks,31y8iu,gripplechew,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:45:02 2015 UTC,what holster you use? :)
Glocks,31y8iu,brokenseattle,3,Thu Apr 9 05:01:06 2015 UTC,"Galco Quick Slide. It took a few weeks to soften up, but it's the most tremendous holster I've ever bought. It's low profile, hides easily under hoodies, and is durable as F***.  Every single day for 5 years now. Still as gorgeous as the day it showed up on my doorstep."
Glocks,31y8iu,capteurdereves,3,Thu Apr 9 15:27:38 2015 UTC,"The Glock 34 was the only Glock I was never able to get attached to. For me, it really didn't do anything different than my Glock 17."
Glocks,31y8iu,brokenseattle,4,Thu Apr 9 11:08:55 2015 UTC,"The trigger? Sight radius? Balance? I'm surprised you didn't take more from the experience. I'm not attacking you, certainly not, but christ the difference between the 22 and 35 were staggering."
Glocks,31y8iu,capteurdereves,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:53:47 2015 UTC,"I actually shot my 17 better than the 34. In 40sw, the difference might be more."
Glocks,31y8iu,Engelmacher,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:31:23 2015 UTC,Can you define how you shot better with it?  Faster follow up shots? Lighter gun so faster transitions? Overall tighter groups? Lighter slide and faster cyclic rate? shorter sight radius faster to acquire?  Really interested in this.
Glocks,31y8iu,capteurdereves,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:16:12 2015 UTC,Faster follow up shots and tighter groups.
Glocks,31y8iu,judsonm123,2,Fri Apr 10 17:38:04 2015 UTC,"I could see that, but somehow, I like my 34. I kind of want to try a 17L."
Glocks,31y8iu,GoodGuyGlocker,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:09:35 2015 UTC,"I had trouble bonding with my G34 at first. I also have a G17 with a 3.5 lb trigger that feels like its part of my hand. So I put the 17 aside for a while and shot the 34 exclusively. Now it has grown on me and I think I'm now more accurate with the 34.  Well I also have different sights on the guns - combat sights on the 17 and competition sights on the 34, so that helps the accuracy of the 34 at distance."
Glocks,31y8iu,deerhurst,2,Sat Apr 11 01:38:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the feedback folks.
Glocks,31y8iu,rainy0days,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:35:23 2015 UTC,Dont take off that gold junk. Thats factory grease.   The 34 is a fine handgun. Mine has a Jarvis barrel and a messed up rear sight! Ha!

Glocks,32197n,natemeezy,2,Thu Apr 9 21:54:24 2015 UTC,Ya this is my first time having anything like this done. I was going to leave it stock but it got banged up in a motorcycle wreck so I figured if I was going to get work done on it might as well go all in.

Glocks,31tx38,Master2u,6,Wed Apr 8 03:12:56 2015 UTC,I don't know what SSVi is but I like the painting on the Glock. It looks like a good job.
Glocks,31tx38,Tarnsman4Life,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:19:17 2015 UTC,Looks damn cool; I could see getting something like that done to a straight up 19 or a VP9

Glocks,31tx38,Sloppy_Twat,4,Wed Apr 8 20:40:06 2015 UTC,What is a ballpark figure it costs to have one's Glock painted in such a badass finish?
Glocks,31tx38,southernbenz,0,Wed Apr 8 04:47:14 2015 UTC,$deleted + Glock.
Glocks,31tx38,Sloppy_Twat,3,Wed Apr 8 08:10:51 2015 UTC,Have you ever sold a pistol paint job for $1175 or is that just the figure you came up with?
Glocks,31tx38,southernbenz,2,Wed Apr 8 14:24:16 2015 UTC,"Ha.  SSVI had a facebook post where he quoted a price for one of his fully-custom Glock packages.  It was $deleted, plus the Glock. After I posted my link, it appears that SSVI saw the post and immediately deleted the post.  Hence, the link I posted is now dead.    However, due to my awesome google-fu skills, I have found Google's [cached copies of the page.] deleted"
Glocks,31tx38,southernbenz,2,Wed Apr 8 14:41:05 2015 UTC,I don't think he is going to get many orders for $1000+ paintjobs on a glock. Shit you can get a car repainted for that price and I just can't figure where all the cost come from. Even for a custom job being over twice the retail price of the gun is ridiculous.
Glocks,31tx38,FullFiguredRhino,4,Wed Apr 8 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's only paint, though.  I think it's also slide milling, stippling, etc.    I don't think he is going to get many orders   I agree, but it's a numbers game.  If he only sells 70 orders a year at $1000/ea, it's the same gross income as 140 orders at $500/ea.    He's good at what he does; he's probably a smart cookie. I'm sure he's played the numbers and found what works best for both his brand image and his bottom dollar."
Glocks,31tx38,Tallglassofnope,6,Wed Apr 8 15:18:47 2015 UTC,"I know what I pay to how the work done by my machinist and Cerakoter, I know how much time and work and go into doing just one of these, and I know who else is capable of doing this.  You can spend $1700 having something like this done, or you can spend a grand more and have Salient machine your slide and do horrible frame work."

Glocks,31tx38,Ostate57,2,Wed Apr 8 22:12:44 2015 UTC,"No, this paint job is not $1175, on a customer supplied Glock the package starts at $1700, this one is $1900.  I have a box full of orders waiting to be gone through as we speak.  If you think all you're looking at is a 'paint job' you're highly mistaken."

Glocks,31x7oc,ADickShin,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:28:34 2015 UTC,What barrel are you using? Might need a stronger recoil spring due to tighter barrel hood lockup.
Glocks,31x7oc,AHappyMeal,1 point,Thu Apr 9 06:37:24 2015 UTC,Also from what I hear a stronger recoil spring will slow down the gas release a little more and make the report a little quieter.  I will be testing this out soon myself.
Glocks,31x7oc,hi12345654321,1 point,Thu Apr 9 12:26:43 2015 UTC,"I've heard of similar issues being resolved with replacement springs on other hosts but personally haven't had any issues with glocks.  Just curious, what barrel are you using?"
Glocks,31x7oc,axis_z,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:03:05 2015 UTC,I've got an AAC brand barrel.
Glocks,31x7oc,AHappyMeal,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:06:06 2015 UTC,That means Storm Lake made your barrel as Freedom Group bought Storm Lake a couple years ago. It will have slightly tighter lockup than an OEM threaded barrel. You're going to have to run a stronger recoil spring as I said in the above post.

Glocks,31j6fu,cinestiles,8,Sun Apr 5 17:45:49 2015 UTC,"Standard plinking ammo is very manageable, feels similar to .40 cal out of a G27. Bit of snap, more than a 9mm, but nothing crazy. Now, when you go to ""full power"" 10mm (I also tested some 220 grain Underwood @ 1200 ft/sec), you definitely feel it. Slightly snappier than a .40 with noticeable recoil straight back into your palm. It's still manageable, but not something you'd want to shoot hundreds of rounds of in a single session because it starts to hurt your hand after a few mags.

If, however, you could find a no-safety shield on the secondary market (because it's not on the CA handgun roster), then that's what I would suggest.  One of the biggest advantages of the G19 is the 15+1 capacity but since you're in California, the difference in capacity between the Glock and the Shield isn't really that great so in that case the slimmer, more compact Shield w/o manual safety makes a lot of sense, if you can find one."

However, there is always the possibility that it could engage accidentally so I personally would never carry a handgun with a safety unless I always trained to sweep the safety off during the draw step. I like to keep my emergency equipment and training as simple as possible with the minimum amount of potential points of failure which is why I carry a G19 and G29 without manual safeties. Just my preference."

Personally, I just got used to the 26 (I still enjoy shooting the 19 much better), since its smaller size makes it much easier to carry than the 19, which (IMO) is near full size in terms of concealability (the grip length is the biggest factor here, IMO). The key for me to get used to the 26 came came from adopting a strong 2 finger grip on all of my guns, leaving my pinky/little finger out of  shooting job.  That being said, I'd also look into the Kahr PM9 (iirc, still on roster, and is the less expensive, polymer version of the MK9). Smaller than a shield, but doesn't have LCI, nor external safety, nor mag disconnect. Also engineered and made in the US (if that matters to you).  Edit: and yes, I am posting this at 3:30 AM.

So I imagine mags will come out that allow 1-2 extra rounds which sort of solves that issue for those that have a problem with it.   Also isn't the grip angle the same as every other Glock?

Shooting high is generally caused by looking over the sights, because it seems unnatural to us to take focus off of the threat. We naturally have a lack of confidence in hitting what we're aiming at if we can't see it, so it causes us to peak up juuuust enough to glance at our target. Stare at that front sight post and you'll drop your groups to center."

How about just knowing when to pull your firearm and when to just walk away. Here's a hint: you can and should walk away about 99.9% of the time. And for that .01% of the time you can't and don't? It will be obvious it is self defense if you invest in some proper training. Holler at the person that you will shoot if they don't stop. Yell stop! Make it clear that your shots ar a last resort. There are tons of things to learn, I would suggest doing so instead of paying someone to clean up your mess because you are not properly trained.

The market is pretty saturated at the point so they are pretty available, the brand is well known for reliability, they are still cheap enough to not worry about too much if they get stolen and a big thing now is the huge aftermarket support.  There are dozens of companies that make thousands of aftermarket parts and customization options .  I do agree it is buying the brand to some degree but for tried and true models of Glocks like the 19, I feel you are getting the best pistol in it's class.

What makes Glocks so reliable is their simplicity, generous tolerances, and the fact that a good amount of the parts that could affect reliability are encased within the slide. Dirt and debris have a hard time getting into the nooks and crannies that could cause the weapon to seize and or malfunction, and areas where dirt and debris can get into have large enough clearances to prevent malfunctions. Glocks are made to run fairly dry (minimal lubrication) so this also aids in preventing debris buildup that could cause issues.  Glocks don't feature any manual safeties, but have a trigger safety, drop safety, and a firing pin safety which prevent the weapon from firing unless the trigger is pulled. Glocks have a reputation for being reliable stemming from their successful use by police and military over the past few decades."

What bothered me about our M&P9 is all the roll pins and stuff that you have to take off the rear sight to access.  Easier to take apart, easier to clean, thus easier to inspect for any premature wear and tear that could lead to a possible failure down the road.  And even if your recoil spring or trigger spring break, the gun is still technically functional, just not AS functional."

I would say get a model chambered in 9mm just so you have plenty of one caliber ammo. Just IMO.   Also, they are reliable due to so few operating parts.

Glocks,313ycv,Brewtown,0,Thu Apr 2 01:29:52 2015 UTC,40 doesn't have a designated limit for +p. In order to shoot a higher pressure you need a fully supported chamber and glock factory barrels don't offer that. Your going to blow up your gun.

Glocks,313ycv,judsonm123,2,Thu Apr 2 16:44:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think it is the loose tolerances. Lock the slide back on a Glock and shake it, everything rattles. It is very simple and few moving parts as well. The flex in the frame probably helps to. This winter I wanted to see if I could cause mine to malfunction so I spent a few range days tossing my G19 with the slide back in snow and mud. The only time it failed to fire was when the snow  turned to ice in the barrel and kept the gun from going into battery. I was however able to beat the back of the slide in place with my palm and fire it out. After that first shot it cycled normally.   Side note I had a friend with a S&W M&P in .40 not sure which model, but a full size handgun. It did not pass this. In fact we just through it in a snow drift (no mud) and it would not fire ended up having to take it inside and clean the snow out and possibly melt out what ever was causing the problem. I honestly thought the M&P would be able to handle this but this one did not. I had thought they were very similar in over all functional design, but again I am not very knowledgeable when it comes to the M&P series."

I prefer them in 9mm personally.  My father owned a Gen3 Glock 22 and the damn thing stung my hand every time I shot it.  Perhaps the new recoil spring of the Gen4 takes some of the energy out of the recoil now.  I am not recoil sensitive, I used to own a Desert Eagle in .50 AE.

I notice it seems a bit 'tighter' I would venture to say maybe the tolerances are slightly higher? I love shooting it and swapping out barrels is very easy to do on the range."

Glocks,313z3j,armedohiocitizen,4,Wed Apr 1 21:01:42 2015 UTC,"Have you ever done any dry firing practice with your glock?  Setup a target in your living room or whatever, unload your gun and remove all magazines and ammo from the room you'll be in. Check five more times that gun is unloaded and all ammunition is in another room.   Setup your target and take aim. Line the front sight post up at the bullseye center mass then level and center the rear.  Start by applying light pressure to the trigger steadily increasing until it breaks. Rack the slide and do it again. The first thing you're attempting to do is smooth out your trigger pull so you're squeezing and not jerking it for the shots, this will also help with anticipation of recoil.  Practice this for a few minutes a day over the course of a couple week.   I had similar grouping on my glock 22 (9mm conversion) for a couple months. Practiced above and significant improved my shooting at 7 yards.  Started the same thing with my new glock 26 and practiced for weeks, then started live fire practice.   This is my result:  http://i.imgur.com/3iONNH2.jpg  Still have some fliers now and then, but overall significant improvement for less than 1 second between shots.   Hope this helps!"

Glocks,313z3j,James_Johnson,5,Wed Apr 1 22:00:45 2015 UTC,"I normally practice within 15-21 feet since that's where most defensive shootings take place.   I used to do this. I used to do nothing but hose at close distances because I was a DEFENSIVE SHOOTER training for DYNAMIC ENGAGEMENTS.  I later found, after shooting competitively and just generally getting better, that shooting at longer distances helped me develop my trigger control and sight management skills that actually helped me get hits faster at closer distances.  Just some food for thought."

Glocks,30usdf,judsonm123,4,Thu Apr 2 19:16:52 2015 UTC,"I love my Shield and it is a gun I carry with confidence in the summer in a weird (new to CCW) State. The 43 will also be a gun that is small enough that I can wear it out and about in a t-shirt with no worries about printing (in fact its a bit shorter than the Shield). I carry my 19 when I can but my State is brand new to CCW, enough that I am a bit paranoid about printing. The 43 answers that for Glock."
Glocks,30usdf,bmdaia,6,Mon Mar 30 23:48:25 2015 UTC,"After over a year of carrying, I never even think about printing anymore."
Glocks,30usdf,pweekles,3,Tue Mar 31 01:48:02 2015 UTC,Well I'm not there yet when I'm in a t-shirt. I feel the 19 is showing especially when the wind hits me from behind. The Shield disappears mentally and physically. And since the 43 is a bit smaller it will only be easier to carry. CCW is new here and I feel like people will freak out if they see a printing gun and i don't want to be the test case about what concealed means.
Glocks,30usdf,bmdaia,7,Tue Mar 31 02:10:48 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  I live in Texas where everyone is practically expected to be carrying a gun.

Yeah it's not as long as my 19 in the grip so it's slightly easier to conceal, but it just feels like a stubby 19, too fat of a grip.  Yeah you lose 4 rounds but 7 rounds of 9mm is nothing to sneeze at."

Glocks,30usdf,mr1337,1 point,Thu Apr 2 15:42:08 2015 UTC,Micro Pistols do seem more prone to malfunctions than their larger counterparts. I suppose that is a limitation of physics with the current technology/designs. One more reason to get laser blasters sooner rather than later.
Glocks,30usdf,ajs2294,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:58:57 2015 UTC,"It all comes down to the context of what you wear. In casual clothes I can easily conceal a Glock 26 or Glock 19. But when I wear business clothes for work neither of those are a viable option. I want a G43, but it'll probably a year or two from now. Meanwhile I'm going to jump on the Sig P938 bandwagon and see where that takes me."
Glocks,30usdf,r3bman,1 point,Tue Mar 31 02:56:22 2015 UTC,I guess where I am coming from is that the difference between the G26 and G43 is negligible. The size difference probably won't make much of a difference between casual and business apparel. I guess it could depend on the difference of our builds though.
Glocks,30usdf,Hovsky,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:55:23 2015 UTC,"I agree. The same realization is what stood out to me as well. The main difference is the slimmer build and smaller magazine capacity.

Glocks,30usdf,G19Gen3,2,Tue Mar 31 17:36:00 2015 UTC,You should be able to get a 19 and 2 shields for less than that. 2 19s and a shield if you're smart.
Glocks,30usdf,Thechubbyprotestant,2,Wed Apr 1 00:41:24 2015 UTC,"Well with the ""extra"" I'm contemplating a Kahr CM9 (would have to add a little). However, 2 shield an a Gen 4 19 for 1,100 would be a super deal. I've yet to personally see Gen 4 19's under $500 or Shields under $329. I will admit I over paid a little for my shield but I couldn't find any NTS locally or online when I was looking and I have low patience haha.

Glocks,30prbf,1whiteshadow,6,Sun Mar 29 19:33:51 2015 UTC,My bad. Should have asked what distance.  One piece of advice for newer shooters that should tighten your groups up. Keep focused on that front sight. Im sure you've heard that before but often shooters will tend to stray from the front sight and start watching the target during a string of fire to see where the shots are going. Dont do that! Be sure to focus on the front sight for every single shot.

Glocks,30pdte,meeze88,2,Tue Apr 7 07:21:26 2015 UTC,That's a tiny gun for 10mm. I think it is funny that they call the 29 a subcompact and the 19 a compact. I realize the distinctions are relative to the full sized versions but they're functionally the same size.
Glocks,30pdte,schu2470,2,Sun Mar 29 17:09:30 2015 UTC,Great review. I am real interested in getting a G29. Did you check out the G29SF at all? Curious how that compares too.   What has me drawn is the fact that for a couple hundred through Lone Wolf and you can shoot .40 and .357 through the same gun. It's 3 guns in 1 and can fit so many different roles.
Glocks,30pdte,x2humbucker,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:09:21 2015 UTC,"The G29SF (gen3) and G29 Gen4 are fairly similar. The Short Frame grip of the SF version is essentially identical to the Gen4 grip without backstraps. When you put the medium backstrap on the Gen4 gun, the grip is the same size as the normal non-SF gen3 G29. Since I don't plan on using the backstraps, the only difference between the gen3 SF and the gen4 is the more aggressive gen4 grip texture and the larger magazine release, both of which I prefer over the gen3 guns so I decided to go with the gen4.  As for aftermarket barrels, yup, that's a great point. I definitely plan on getting a .40 cal conversion barrel at some point in the future since I don't own any .40 S&W guns and I'd like to be able to shoot that round occasionally."

Glocks,30pdte,f0rcedinducti0n,1 point,Tue May 26 20:23:03 2015 UTC,"Low and left is usually a sign of anticipating recoil. And the 10mm definitely has some decent recoil. Do a lot of dryfire practice and hopefully that issue will lessen over time as you get used to the trigger pull.  One trick is to go to the range and have someone load your mags and insert snap caps/dummy rounds randomly in the magazine while loading real ammo as well. Then when you shoot, once you reach that snap cap (without realizing it), you should see quickly whether or not you're flinching."

Glocks,30pdte,wolfgangmob,0,Sun Mar 29 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"I recently got rid of my G29. It was the same setup with the Pearce grip extension. It felt good in the hand with that, and it concealed well.   I got rid of it because 10mm in a subcompact isn't practical. It's too much juice for carrying against human threats in an urban environment, the capacity is low, it's unpleasant to practice with, and the really hot stuff had cycling issues.   9mm is quite effective as a self defense round, and the ability to fire quicker, flatter, and more comfortably far outweighed the little bit of size advantage. For woods carry, I've got my rifle slung, so I'm really not missing it there, either."

We went to a local tourism region in the mountains nearby where we live. I had my camera in my car. It was after midnight and there were no people around, as the area is occupied mainly during the winter season when the ski slopes are open. They are not at this time of the year.  So I told my friend we could try and make a photo of the new sights.  I unloaded my spare magazine and put it into the gun. I double-checked whether there was a bullet in the chamber. There was none.  After I handed the gun to my friend, he double-checked the gun himself. He put the slide back and since the magazine was empty, the slide got locked. He checked the barrel himself, then returned the slide to its initial position, aimed the gun at the ground and pulled the trigger.  After that, he aimed the gun at the statue. It's a wooden statue some people created from a tree. It has no special value whatsoever. He made sure there were no people around. Not behind the statue, not in front of it.  He kept his finger off the trigger and outside the trigger guard at all times.  You can also see on the photo that the gun is unloaded, as the little side thingie (I don't know how it's called in English, I'm not a native speaker) is ""pressed in.""  I hope this clarifies the situation properly for any future visitors of this thread and/or my user profile. I would never break the gun safety rules and I would never use my gun in a way to threaten anyone.  Thanks guys for all your input and be safe!"

Buy an adjustable wood burning tool at a hobby store, they are adjustable, have several tips and you can get better control because the shaft that holds the heating element is shorter. Start the outline in pencil and then use the thinnest tip to make the outline with tiny holes, once you have the outline done, move to a slightly bigger tip, overlap the stippling so you get a random pattern, and there are no blank areas, when you are done, we stand the area with some 400 then 600 grit sand paper so that the sharper texture gets knocked down."

How I've always lined up my glock sights is a little different than how I shoot with most other pistols. With most pistols you are meant to line up the front directly in between the rear sights, like THIS. On the glock sights I try to match up a line that connects the top of the white on the rear sights to a line that is exactly halfway up/down the front sight dot.   Like THIS.    I do this because I feel it is easier for me to line up the sights when I can see all of the front dot, which I cannot do when it is lower.  I know this should make the shots high, but I have never had any problem with my shots not going exactly where I want them when I put the target directly above the front dot."
Glocks,30linh,Jakakan5,5,Sat Mar 28 16:31:16 2015 UTC,"The second picture definitely isn't a normal sight picture. Do you do this with all glocks? I would have to assume that either something is jacked with your sights or you've acquired a nasty abnormal grip/shooting habit with your or all glocks. I would look in to it more if possible, just because it seems to work doesn't really make it a good thing.  An extreme case of this would be when I went shooting with a friend of mine with such a severe and consistent trigger jerk that all of his rifles were zero'd about 2 inches high and to the right at ~50-100 yards. I took him out once to shoot his grand fathers german capture P-38 and he shot the dirt 2-3 feet in front of the target.   Practice doesn't make perfect, perfect practice makes perfect."

I am using Winchester white box .40 FMJ 180grain   EDIT: after putting about 250-300 rounds down range I did experience about 3 light primer strikes within the first 150 rounds with the 2lb spring. I then installed the 3lb spring and shot another 150 rounds with no problems.   I have the stock OEM GLOCK firing pin. After installing the ZEV skeletonized extended firing pin it should solve the light primer strikes."

Glocks,30klym,MostOriginalNameEver,2,Sat Mar 28 04:48:05 2015 UTC,Possibly something got stuck between the primer and the boltface. Every so often if something gets into the primer seating device I use to reload it'll leave a small dent. Unless it's slamming into the primer it's extremely unlikely to detonate but nonetheless it's something you should probably try to avoid while chambering a round because of slamfire.

Glocks,30hw8h,FlightlessFish,20,Fri Mar 27 14:57:07 2015 UTC,My best stab at it:  They finally decided to get into the single stack game. They knew people wanted the 9mm way more than they wanted the .380. They also knew that if they released them at the same time the demand for the .380 probably wouldn't be that great. You release the .380 first and the loyalist will flock to it because that's all they could get. Thus milking the lesser .380 market for all its worth.  Then later release the model that people really want. This is what I've been thinking since they released the g42. Why they waited so long to get into the single stack market? I don't know.
Glocks,30hw8h,Xero-One,3,Fri Mar 27 15:51:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know about ""finally"" deciding to get in. The 36 was released (or at least announced) in 1999."

Glocks,30hw8h,Xero-One,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:51:16 2015 UTC,"That's different, that gun competes more with 1911s."
Glocks,30hw8h,Shotgun_Sentinel,2,Fri Mar 27 21:51:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know so much about that. It's called a ""subcompact"" in their lineup.   If anything, I would say the 41 is competing with the 1911."
Glocks,30hw8h,alc6379,0,Sat Mar 28 05:35:10 2015 UTC,They make subcompact 1911s.
Glocks,30hw8h,Shotgun_Sentinel,7,Sat Mar 28 05:44:50 2015 UTC,"Money. Glock exponentially expanded its dividends by creating an inferior product (G42) that people would buy as a stop-gap for the normal good (G43).   If they had just released the 43 from the beginning, they'd have made X amount of revenue. Let's call this figure $100M. However, by first releasing the 42, they made additional revenue. Let's say $50M. Some people didn't buy the 42 because it didn't meet their needs, so they held out. However, others bought the 42, and will now buy the 43 as it expands upon the benefits of the 42.  So let's say there's $20M worth of G43s bought by people who already bought G42s. The G43s now sell only say $70M, but given the additional $50M generated by the G42 originally, they've netted $120M in comparison to the $100M they'd have made without doing so.  Put even simpler, by witholding the G43, Glock generated even more interest in their brand, while allowing themselves more time to perfect the engineering behind it.   EDIT They've also now created a new platform, along the lines of the G17-G22, G29-G30, or G19-G23. Their single-stack subcompact segment will now be a completely marketable ""line"" of designs that can be pushed towards certain demographics to continue to push sales."

Glocks,30hw8h,vailman,3,Sat Mar 28 02:37:46 2015 UTC,"The 42 is chambered in .380 ACP, a decidedly inferior round. Inconsistent expansion AND penetration are staples of the round, even in factory offerings from more respected brands like Speer and Hornady.   The 43 is a 9mm offering, the most ubiquitous and arguably most balanced pistol cartridge in production."
Glocks,30hw8h,ZER0THE0RY,0,Fri Mar 27 16:27:00 2015 UTC,"The two both serve a similar purpose, they compete with each other. However, most people will prefer one (43) to the other (42). So, they release the less popular product first, get as many sales as they can, because after they release the more-desired product, the chances of getting those sales on the less-desired product would be slimmer."
Glocks,30hw8h,leica_boss,6,Fri Mar 27 16:45:49 2015 UTC,"Glock runs at its own pace and is a fairly conservative company.

Though, before I do that, I'm going to explore the Sig P938. Its a bit shorter and may offer a greater range of flexibility with AIWB.

Many manufacturers step down to 3.0"" barrels and im glad glock didn't because that impacts ballistics. So really its cut down just enough to make a difference.   I think this is perfect for pocket carry as I carry a G33 with a +2 which is 11+1 at a height of about 4.75. A which works well for me even in levis 511. The 43 would put the gun deeper in the pocket and protrude from the body less. I am still holding out for a single stack .357 sig which would beat anything in that caliber currently."

They're not incredibly common to find on the used market, but they're available if you look around. The only available model in the gen1 configuration is the original full-size Glock 17 (and some very rare early model G19s). All the other calibers and sizes came with the later generations. Compared to later generation glocks, the Gen1s have a thin pencil barrel that is no longer produced by Glock so you can't swap barrels with any modern glock or aftermarket glock barrel and of course, the gen1 and gen2 glocks do not have the accessory rail for attaching lights to the dustcovers so in terms of functionality they're a bit limited compared to the modern gen3/gen4 glocks. However, gen1 and gen2 lack finger grooves, which is a plus to some. Personally, I find the lack of finger grooves and lack of a rail to make the earlier Glocks just look sleeker which is why I'd like to add one to my growing collection of tactical tupperware."

Glocks,30fn9w,jerry_rigger,3,Thu Mar 26 23:48:21 2015 UTC,"MOS guns and the aftermarket pre milled slides are going to do the same thing. If this is what you wanted, I would just get the MOS. There's no longer much of a reason to buy the aftermarket slides unless you're just trying to be cheap.   If you want to do it right, you need to have a slide milled out to the exact dimensions of the RMR you want to put on there. This means buying the RMR, and sending it with the gun. It will mount lower and have virtually zero side to side/front to back movement when compared to something like the MOS which has a universal cut. This means it will be stronger, lower profile, and hold zero better. Some companies even claim that you can remove the RMR to change batteries, and still maintain zero because of how tight they mill the slides."
Glocks,30fn9w,rainy0days,2,Fri Mar 27 00:56:27 2015 UTC,This.  I just had mine done (G17 milled for an RMR) and they would not mill the slide unless they had the RMR sent in with the gun.

Glocks,30bilc,doitforjimmy,2,Thu Mar 26 16:14:10 2015 UTC,Agreed
Glocks,30bilc,nvgeologist,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:09:41 2015 UTC,Pretty nice to see the Glock 43 being run through its paces. Seems like it's feeding better than the first round of 42's did. This video felt similar to a Hickok video. Surely Glock will send him a 43 to test out. I can't wait to get my 43 in at my LGS.
Glocks,30bilc,doitforjimmy,3,Thu Mar 26 14:05:05 2015 UTC,I'm surprised they didn't give Hickok45 one first. Hickok45 has inspired me to buy several Glocks and without him it would have taken me a long time to get one at all.
Glocks,30bilc,nvgeologist,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:43:22 2015 UTC,"This was a good vid, still miss Barry, and it's cool to see Eric have a little fun with this new shooter.   I like the side by sides with the other baby Glocks, but I still want to hold one before making a buying decision."
Glocks,30bilc,doitforjimmy,1 point,Thu Mar 26 14:41:18 2015 UTC,"I mean IV8888 isn't terrible but he's no hickok45  Also, I thought it wasn't safe to shoot steel that close with ball ammo.  My LGS had a indoor steel range but only allowed frangible ammo."
Glocks,30bilc,nvgeologist,2,Thu Mar 26 21:52:14 2015 UTC,"/u/nvgeologist who runs moatargets has posted before that their recommended distance for pistol rounds is at least 12 yards. Ball ammo shouldn't make a difference. Range rules are sometimes pretty arbitrary, though I'm thinking the frangible requirement may have something to do with frangible bullets typically being lead-free. Bullets basically disintegrate upon impact and lead bullets would send lead into the air. It's not a huge deal outside, but on an indoor range, I wouldn't want that floating around either."
Glocks,30bilc,doitforjimmy,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:05:54 2015 UTC,Ahhh ok.  I had thought it was for riochet's
Glocks,30bilc,nvgeologist,3,Thu Mar 26 22:33:18 2015 UTC,12 yards for safety. I don't rate differently for frangible because people are stupid.
Glocks,30bilc,J_XRS,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:39:48 2015 UTC,To clarify I don't know what distance the range had for their steel.  Had to buy their frangible and it was expensive so I never got around to shooting it before they converted it into 5 more lanes.  But good to know about the 12 yards.  Edit: you can safely shoot buckshot at steel?  Didn't think that would end well
Glocks,30dztl,thorshairbrush,5,Thu Mar 26 16:43:12 2015 UTC,"I just bought a glock 19 gen 4, and so far have had no issues. From everything i've heard, the initial issues have all been worked out and gen 4 is the way to go now a days. I've put about 200 rounds through mine in the past week with no issues. I like the grip better and the recoil does seem to be better with the improved spring. Mag release has been noticeably improved as well.  I'd say that as long as you can swing the extra money, go with the gen 4 (got mine brand new for $550). That being said, nothing wrong with a gen 3 especially if you get a good deal on one."
Glocks,30dztl,Chet_Manley61,2,Thu Mar 26 16:59:36 2015 UTC,"+1 Bought a Gen 4 19 almost 2 years ago, probably close to 1500 rounds through it with not a single misfire, extraction failure or other malfunction. Carried concealed regularly and constantly getting dirty yet still has a perfect firing record.  Everything from blazer to Tap through it too.  My experience has been very positive and I'm thinking of buying a gen4 17 to go with my gen3 17 (with the fishgills). Good luck."
Glocks,30dztl,optimaloptical,4,Thu Mar 26 21:45:21 2015 UTC,New gen4's are just fine now.
Glocks,30dztl,phokas,4,Thu Mar 26 18:14:39 2015 UTC,I'm 3000 rounds into my gen 4 G35. No issues so far.
Glocks,30dztl,valhallaready,3,Thu Mar 26 19:32:47 2015 UTC,"I put 2,000 rounds through my glock 21 and have had 1 round fail to eject. The gen 4s seem to have everything fixed."
Glocks,30dztl,silentsnipe21,3,Thu Mar 26 19:14:47 2015 UTC,"New gen4s run perfectly fine. 15 000 rounds on my 17 and still running strong. Recoil spring changed after ~10 000 rounds because I got one for free. Hickups all ammo releated or operator error. No issues with ejection, trigger or anything else. If anything trigger got smoother."
Glocks,30dztl,stDemigod,3,Thu Mar 26 19:42:04 2015 UTC,I have about 1000 rounds through my Glock 19 Gen4 in the past 7 months and I've had no issues other than maybe 3-4 brass to face.
Glocks,30dztl,slalomz,3,Thu Mar 26 19:54:45 2015 UTC,There was an issue for weak wristed people when they first came out. they are all limp wrist approved now.
Glocks,30dztl,volcanonacho,2,Thu Mar 26 20:22:53 2015 UTC,"All mine I have found to be user error (hitting the mag release button) maybe the ocasssional load feed due to new, stiff mags."
Glocks,30dztl,Soulfader72,2,Thu Mar 26 20:55:48 2015 UTC,I had two misfeeds with Wal-mart brand Perfecta 9mm last week in my gen 4 though.  Probably stay away from that ammo.  Not impressed.
Glocks,30dztl,phokas,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:28:31 2015 UTC,The box I shot went fine. Have you tried ZQ1?
Glocks,30dztl,Sh_doubleE_ran,1 point,Fri Mar 27 13:51:34 2015 UTC,"Zqi is my normal plinking ammo.  Never had an issue with be it 9mm, 5.56, or .308."
Glocks,30dztl,phokas,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:54:25 2015 UTC,My first 2 boxes each had 1 hard primer but that makes training more real. A second strike sent them both flying.
Glocks,30dztl,Sh_doubleE_ran,2,Fri Mar 27 18:41:28 2015 UTC,Just wanted to add that I just purchased a 19Gen4 and took it shooting for the first time yesterday. Shot 150 rounds of Winchester White Box with no issue.
Glocks,30dztl,ajs2294,2,Fri Mar 27 01:10:15 2015 UTC,"Gen 4 is good to go. The 9mm and .40 had some legitimate issues with the recoil spring, but Glock solved it long ago."
Glocks,30dztl,jonmango42,2,Fri Mar 27 17:34:43 2015 UTC,Bought a glock 19 gen 4 a year and a half ago. Have put over 1500 rounds into it with maybe 1 or 2 field strips to clean it. ZERO FAILURES! I can't even make it fail when I limp wrist on purpose....
Glocks,30dztl,mugenh22a,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:54:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response! Very helpful to hear from someone who has owned the gun in question for a decent period of time as many who replied have. Im either getting a 19 or 23 Ill decide after I shoot both
Glocks,30dztl,jerry_rigger,0,Thu Apr 2 21:41:39 2015 UTC,IIRC the problem in the early models was between the new stiff springs that weren't broken in yet and the use of lightly loaded ammo.   But I can not confirm or deny this.  Internet here-say and whatnot.
Glocks,309ch4,specialized26,3,Wed Mar 25 15:13:13 2015 UTC,"Out of curiousity, how long did it take?"
Glocks,309ch4,Thergood,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:28:18 2015 UTC,Took about 6 and a half weeks. A little longer than expected because the suppressor height night sights were back ordered. His lead times are great and quality is top notch.
Glocks,309ch4,Thergood,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:54:03 2015 UTC,"Did you ship directly (not through an FFL) with next day air? If so, did you use UPS or FedEx?"
Glocks,309ch4,valhallaready,2,Wed Mar 25 19:48:42 2015 UTC,"I used UPS and shipped next day air. It's more expensive, but I didn't want to deal with a third party. UPS was very easy to deal with. You have to go to one of their main distribution centers (where the trucks get loaded). Make sure you insure it for the cost of the gun, RMR and any custom work."
Glocks,309ch4,hi12345654321,2,Wed Mar 25 19:52:26 2015 UTC,Looks great. I'm really looking for to getting this setup on my Glock 35!  Have you put many rounds though it? How do you like the setup compared to the usual iron sights?
Glocks,309ch4,hi12345654321,3,Wed Mar 25 16:19:21 2015 UTC,"I just got it back yesterday and have about 200 rounds through it with the RMR. It's awesome, took some getting used to to find the dot, but once you have that down its crazy fast."
Glocks,309ch4,hi12345654321,2,Wed Mar 25 19:46:40 2015 UTC,"Glock 17: added the RMR, top and front serrations and enhanced the rear serrations, and full grip stipple with undercuts.  Work done by ATEi, they did a fantastic job and awesome customer service.  If you are thinking about getting anything done send it out to them"
Glocks,309ch4,bobaxfettx666,1 point,Wed Mar 25 15:14:57 2015 UTC,How much for the stippling part? Looks better than a lot I've seen.
Glocks,309ch4,HiroshimaRoll,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:22:37 2015 UTC,"I don't remember exactly because it was all priced out together (slide and grip) ATEi does the slide work and their sister company, Sweaty Muddy Bloody, does the frame work.  ATEi and SMB have the pricing and order forms on their websites.  I did one order form and sent it to ATEi and they handle everything."
Glocks,309ch4,G19Gen3,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:28:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. Expensive though, I wish I could do it like that myself"
Glocks,309ch4,hi12345654321,1 point,Fri Mar 27 01:35:37 2015 UTC,"It isn't cheap but it is worth the price...you get what you pay for. They have different textures: carry, medium and aggressive.  I went with the medium."

Glocks,30crt3,alc6379,3,Thu Mar 26 13:07:15 2015 UTC,Probably the engraved 25th anniversary plaque on it.
Glocks,30crt3,scdodge03,1 point,Thu Mar 26 15:22:01 2015 UTC,"Ah, you know I skimmed over it while on mobile. That makes more sense now."
Glocks,30crt3,alc6379,2,Thu Mar 26 15:29:02 2015 UTC,"I just saw it, I have no connection to it. Honestly I don't know. Thought people here might be more knowledgeable."
Glocks,30ammi,comawhite12,3,Wed Mar 25 20:49:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, the moment you all (any?) have been waiting for!  I finally received my HOTSHOE from Holland Tactical Solutions that was here on Reddit a few weeks ago.  Cost:  Damn reasonable if you ask me, and I have bought TalonGrip LOL. I paid $15.00 + $1.00 shipping. Not too bad, and I think the price has dropped to $12 if I read that right.  You can find it here  Shipping speed: Glaciers move faster than this thing did. I know it has nothing to do with the seller, but for some reason this little standard sized envelope took a staggering 14 days to get to me from time of payment.   Packaging: Well I have to say, only my dear 'ol Mother cares to send me handwritten notes in packages she sends, but damned if Holland Tactical didn't bring their -A- game when it came to instructions for installation.  The instructions are very clear, and tell you all you need to know on how to affix this skin tearing, table chipping, holster marring beast to your Glock Brand Glock in a very pleasant handwriting as well.  Installation: Straight forward! Follow the instructions, and you are in business.    I did have to cut off the first set of slide serration pieces because my rear site is exceptionally deep it seems, but it works just as well missing that 1/8"" of material.    The glue is super tacky, and seems to have welded itself to my slide for the time being. But make sure to alcohol wipe that area before slapping it on, or you're gonna have a bad time.   The granulate seems like it will destroy pretty much anything you drag it down in order to rack the slide, but isn't that what we wanted????     I did some one handed racking a round into the chamber drills on my jeans covered thigh, and now I need new jeans and a skingraft. (JK)     But the HOTSHOE does what it says it will on pretty much any surface it seems.   Time will tell how well the glue holds, and I will update with another review after I have worn it around in my IWB holster in 85+ heat for a couple of weeks, and maybe a trip or 2 to the range.  I have high hopes for the HOTSHOE, and so far it ranks an (A)  -edit- On the wear concern.   Here is wear to holster from 1 day worn.   Is this a problem?  Not to me.  Was it expected? Of course!  Putting a high traction surface against buttery soft leather is gonna leave a mark.   Brah, do you even operate? /s/"
Glocks,30ammi,Aero_Flash,2,Wed Mar 25 21:17:48 2015 UTC,"I saw these to and was wondering if it's worth it. Keep us updated on it, I'm curious to see if it wears quickly, or rubs holsters like you said."
Glocks,30ammi,greekplaya990,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:33:30 2015 UTC,I've been contemplating taking some talon grips and doing this. How's it holding up? does it looks like its going to start to peel anywhere?
Glocks,30ammi,Herman_Blume_,2,Thu Mar 26 13:07:39 2015 UTC,hey hows it going! My best friend is the one who stared this company and created the Hotshoe. why steal someones idea instead of supporting a small business and get the real thing!! its only $12
Glocks,309o66,Chubnubblestiltskin,17,Wed Mar 25 16:42:30 2015 UTC,It's a Timberwolf frame from LWD.
Glocks,309o66,BZJGTO,5,Wed Mar 25 16:46:23 2015 UTC,Definitely a Timberwolf. This frame works as a replacement or a starting point for a Gen3 Glock build.   Here's one of my builds. Gen3 G24 using the Timberwolf Frame.  EDIT: Here is a link to the article that this image is from.
Glocks,309o66,TameableExpertv2,5,Wed Mar 25 17:10:05 2015 UTC,"Honest question, how much of that gun is glock parts? I wasn't aware people ""built"" glocks. It looks cool though."
Glocks,309o66,Studsmcgee,5,Wed Mar 25 17:18:16 2015 UTC,The locking block and the Trigger are OEM Glock parts.
Glocks,309o66,TameableExpertv2,3,Wed Mar 25 17:20:12 2015 UTC,Are LW built Glocks as reliable as actual Glocks? Thought about building one myself down the road.
Glocks,309o66,SonsOfLiberty86,4,Wed Mar 25 21:56:00 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, I work at Lone Wolf, but I had been an admirer long before working there was a possibility for me. I don't let that sway my opinion on the work that is done though.  With that being said, Yes they are as reliable."

Glocks,309o66,noscarstoshow,2,Thu Mar 26 00:43:41 2015 UTC,Lol
Glocks,309o66,TameableExpertv2,2,Thu Mar 26 00:44:37 2015 UTC,"Cool build. What are we looking at, a g17L gen3?"
Glocks,309o66,gripplechew,3,Thu Mar 26 00:29:53 2015 UTC,"Gen3 G24, That was my first gun! I'm probably going to have the slide and barrel go through the salt bath nitride process after I have a few changes made to the slide. Black on OD green. XD"
Glocks,309o66,TameableExpertv2,2,Thu Mar 26 00:41:25 2015 UTC,"Call me crazy, but does removing the hump in the back make the glock feel more like a 1911?  I've read that glocks are great if you're a two knuckle puncher, 1911 if you're a 4 knuckle puncher."
Glocks,309o66,tincankilla,2,Thu Mar 26 06:08:20 2015 UTC,"I recall reading about that somewhere as well. A bit of Google-Fu turned up this article.  The Timberwolf has two removable backstraps, the one I have in is the thick backstrap. The thick one has been compared to an XD or a Sig, and the thin one has been compared to a 1911. They're not exact, but they do provide options for people."
Glocks,309o66,TameableExpertv2,2,Thu Mar 26 14:59:26 2015 UTC,So you saw that one guy on that one youtube video huh?
Glocks,309o66,Sloppy_Twat,2,Thu Mar 26 06:18:06 2015 UTC,This is not a custom stipple job on an original Glock frame. Just some ugly ass after market frame.
Glocks,309o66,jackets17,0,Wed Mar 25 17:05:43 2015 UTC,Yeah there's something about this frame that just looks...cheap. The trigger guard...finger indentation..it just looks really low quality even though it's a lone wolf product.
Glocks,309o66,G19Gen3,2,Wed Mar 25 19:18:25 2015 UTC,"I'd still like to hold one. I'm most curious how it corrects the glock's grip angle, since that's one of my glock-gripes"
Glocks,309o66,gripplechew,3,Wed Mar 25 22:46:39 2015 UTC,"See but the grip angle of a Glock is my absolute favorite feature. Fits me perfectly, makes me shoot better."
Glocks,309o66,G19Gen3,3,Wed Mar 25 22:56:00 2015 UTC,I was shooting 5 inch groups at 10 yards doing double taps as fast as I could control them. With the rental.
Glocks,309o66,G19Gen3,2,Thu Mar 26 00:27:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not new to shooting...I just was able to maintain at a much much higher rate with the Glock than with the XDs / Smiths I'd shot before. The ccw trainers I've had always said ""if you're shooting 3 inch groups while practicing defensive shooting, shoot faster. You don't want 3 inch groups, you want every strike to be somewhere center mass as fast as you can deliver them""."
Glocks,309o66,G19Gen3,4,Thu Mar 26 00:50:06 2015 UTC,They make great barrels and I own several but there's no way I would ever pay money for a frame that ugly.
Glocks,309o66,jackets17,4,Thu Mar 26 00:52:21 2015 UTC,Love their barrels
Glocks,309o66,gripplechew,5,Thu Mar 26 04:16:58 2015 UTC,what about their barrels makes you love them?
Glocks,309o66,pballer2oo7,3,Wed Mar 25 19:22:02 2015 UTC,"They are well made.  The lockup is tighter, yielding better accuracy. I hear the barrels themselves shoot more accurately according to tests out there, too. I mainly like their shiney, stainless steel color, tight lockup, and the ability to shoot lead cast bullets, which is not recommended in OEM Glock barrels."
Glocks,308u0d,valhallaready,3,Wed Mar 25 12:25:59 2015 UTC,Didn't it have some issues with the drop safety not working?
Glocks,308u0d,sks_innawoods,2,Wed Mar 25 20:19:20 2015 UTC,What's the pull weight?
Glocks,308u0d,421dave,3,Wed Mar 25 18:17:29 2015 UTC,Feels around 4.5-5.0lbs but they have the option to keep the stock 5.5lb pull as well.

Glocks,30an81,deepsoulfunk,2,Wed Mar 25 20:56:40 2015 UTC,"My LGS was very cool about this. I didn't have a holster or anything but just did a beltband check and that's how I settled on the Shield. The Shield's a fine gun for carry, but if I could do it all over again, I would have gotten the G19 for is capacity and versatility. The Shield is designed more around being just a carry piece."
Glocks,30an81,gripplechew,2,Wed Mar 25 21:01:45 2015 UTC,"It's feasible, especially if you're flexible with your clothing. The g19 will adequately fulfill the major roles of a pistol (home defense, concealed carry, and range practice); jack of all trades, master of none(?)"

It's easy to conceal if you always wear sweaters and long, big, shirts that are dark-colored. Otherwise, it will print. I carry a 19 when I can but when the warmer weather hits I switch up to a Shield (soon to be a 43) because it is made to conceal well. I'm just saying, the 19 has a following that is cultish and puts forth the falsehood that it is as concealable as the thin, single-stack 9's. It is not."

Glocks,30an81,teckademics,3,Thu Mar 26 04:41:31 2015 UTC,If you go with the 43 you'll prob want to carry an extra mag. The 23 accepts the larger 19 and 17 mags.  The 19 should shoot better because of its larger size but at 7 yards not a big deal.  I currently have a 42 and 19. Love them both. There's a good chance I'll get the 43 when the price comes down and give my gf the 42. Penis.
Glocks,308xcg,dooger5,3,Wed Mar 25 13:02:18 2015 UTC,I sometimes carry the 19 with an RMR. But i carry it owb with a windbreaker or something over it

Glocks,308xcg,terminal_sexlexia,2,Wed Mar 25 16:13:51 2015 UTC,My RMR actually sits on top of my waist band.  It helps the gun stay in place.  (I like carrying without a holster though)

Glocks,308xcg,greekplaya990,-16,Thu Mar 26 02:49:12 2015 UTC,"Unless it's open carry (and even then) its pretty silly for your average person. I feel like you'd be better off with a LCP, g42, or p238 somewhere hidden on you and that you can easily bring out everywhere you go."
Glocks,308xcg,ballr4lyf,7,Wed Mar 25 13:52:20 2015 UTC,"Your pretense seems to be that the only thing worth carrying would be a pocket pistol of some sort.  While pocket pistols are awesome, and I carry my XD-S fairly regularly, there is a large community of people who CCW ""compact"" (e.g. Glock 19) regularly without issue.  There have even been times when I've carried my Glock 17 concealed.  Even during the summer.  I can't really answer the question about the RMR, because I've not put one on any of my pistols, but I can tell you that Compact and even full size pistols can be concealed.  It all depends on where you are willing to compromise.  If you're not willing to give up SMedium shirts, then it may not be for you.  If you're okay with changing your wardrobe to accommodate the larger weapon platforms, then it is completely doable."
Glocks,308xcg,greekplaya990,-4,Wed Mar 25 14:29:18 2015 UTC,"I have an XD-S too and even with that small of a gun you are adding like 1/6th to the size of it adding an RMR. And as for dressing to conceal I'm sure I can conceal my Desert eagle with my Aimpoint on top if I wanted to but what's that going to do that my p238 or LCP couldn't do? And for context, and this means everything, I work an office job and live in an area with stupidly low crime and in the DC suburbs in VA where most people dont open carry or anything."
Glocks,308xcg,ballr4lyf,9,Wed Mar 25 14:44:10 2015 UTC,"Yup...  You completely missed the point there...   I don't plan on adding a RMR to my XD-S, nor was I suggesting it was a platform that one could add an RMR to. There are a bunch of people who CCW (meaning ""concealed"") a Glock 19 regularly without issue. The Glock 19 is one of the platforms on which an RMR can be added currently.   Carrying a G19 or G17 doesn't necessarily make an individual ""Tacticool"" or ""Mall Ninja"".  It just so happens that they can carry it regularly and it doesn't interfere with their lifestyle.  Ask any of the SMEs (Massad Ayoob, Vickers, Haley, Panone, etc.), and they will tell you to carry the biggest gun you can get away with without interfering with your lifestyle.  For some people that's a pocket pistol.  For others, it's a full size gun.  Is it easier to carry a P238?  Sure.  But if I can get away with CCWing a VP9 (meaning: my attire fits my destinations for the day, and I conceal a VP9 with my current attire), I'm going to do that instead."
Glocks,308xcg,hi12345654321,3,Wed Mar 25 15:16:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with this comment. I was a little confused on how we got onto this discussion, when all I was asking about is if anyone has any input with carrying with an RMR.   Regardless, I could care less about the size of the gun. Or adding 1/6th of the size of it adding an RMR. I prefer compact guns over smaller pistols because of how big my hands are."

If you can do that consistently then you could pass the yearly qualifications for police officers in my state.   Edit: With regards to what groups you ""should"" be getting... That depends on what you are aiming at. If you're hitting your target then your groups must be small enough."
Glocks,3057e4,WindowShoppingMyLife,3,Tue Mar 24 16:58:42 2015 UTC,"At 50 feet the target is probably the size of your entire front sight. Depending. With a handgun, as a casual, just try and hit double your standard 25' group. That's probably a good benchmark."

Glocks,3057e4,alc6379,0,Tue Mar 24 22:19:07 2015 UTC,"Sights are sights for range use.   Just keep the sights you've got, and work on your trigger control and follow through. Technique is always more important than a new accessory for your gun: you can't buy your way into being a better shooter.   Edit: Sure wish someone would explain where I'm wrong rather than downvoting. Glock sights aren't incredible, but they definitely get the job done, well enough at least to work on improving your groups even at 50 yards."

Glocks,3057e4,9mmIsBestMillimeter,3,Tue Mar 24 18:30:45 2015 UTC,"Glocks are typically known to have inherent accuracy of 2-3"" at 25m.  What that means is that when locked into a Ransom Rest or shot from a sandbag rest by a good shooter with match grade ammunition, they'll average 2-3"" over a 5 shot group from 25 meters out.  5 shots at 25m benchrested is the generally accepted standard for measuring pistol accuracy.  50m if it's a target pistol.  Sigs (the aluminum frame ones anyway) and HKs can usually clock in a little bit tighter, like 1.5"" or so typically.  Super accurate stuff (that's really better tested at 50m) like Sig P210 Legends and X5s, Les Baer 1911s, Colt Pythons, Korths, etc. will come in at or under 1"" at 25."

Normal shooting should be 3"" or so. If you're really trying, a 19 will give you 1-1/2"" or better at 50'.   Sights may help slightly but you really just need practice. Maybe get a better shooter to help you out and figure out your weak areas."

Glocks,303d7n,sonusfaber,3,Tue Mar 24 14:58:01 2015 UTC,"Good thinking. Now, this is important. Before you do anything else, go and buy $100 worth of ammo. Don't worry, the G17 will shoot almost any 9mm you can find.   That $100 worth of practicing will go a long way if you ever need to use it in an emergency. It doesnt matter what other guns you have shot, this one is new to you I presume. You'll need to get used to the grip, the trigger feel, & the recoil. By the time you have put 1000 rounds through it, it will feel just right.   Do some research on stance and grip. Learn it. Don't just go to the range and bang out rounds for the hell of it. Make the most of the time. Eventually you can work on draw and speed for your carry. Good luck.   ETA: Yes, this was also my first gun. Since then it has had a laser added, grip tape, 33 round mag, and now sights coming this week.

Glocks,306we0,brbigs,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:03:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I've read so far. Seems like Glock was moving to standardize the frame setup along all calibers, even with those that didn't necessarily need the additional pin. Thanks!"
Glocks,306we0,OffensiveWords,-6,Wed Mar 25 02:13:17 2015 UTC,There is no such thing as a Gen 3 Glock 19 with only 2 pins. You got a Gen 2 or even maybe a Gen 1.  As for the question of 'weakness' there's a reason they went from 2 pins to 3 pins. Strength.

Glocks,302vl9,Combat_crocs,2,Tue Mar 24 07:17:33 2015 UTC,"Not a dip my friend. The company that does it, takes it down to bare metal and then paints on the kryptek pattern. Then applies the armor clear cerakote. They call it Holokryptek. Oh and $130 with shipping."

Glocks,30149k,sewage,2,Mon Mar 23 17:28:54 2015 UTC,Indeed. It most likely wouldn't make sense... I guess the backpressure produced by the suppressor would make huge amounts of gas exit the ports and it would be very loud...

Honestly i can't tell much difference between the two setups and the pre travel is still Glock-ish on both guns, reset is still very definite. If your gun is going to be carried i would just throw a quality connector in it and call it done, you don't want to risk light primer strikes with a lighter striker spring.

Glocks,302c7x,Teezytaughtme,1 point,Tue Mar 24 06:56:31 2015 UTC,"install the slide stop pin from the side where the slide stop lever is. It sounds like you are installing it from the other side and the slide stop spring isn't travelling towards the middle of the pin where it needs to be. This, I guarantee, is the issue."
Glocks,302c7x,SteveWagner197,3,Wed Apr 29 17:41:15 2015 UTC,The slide stop spring actually presses the slide stop down so it pops down when you pull back on the slide while racking it. The slide stop only pops up when you push up with your thumb or when the magazine follower lifts it up. If it is popping up at any other time then something is installed wrong. Take the slide off and if the slide stop lever pops up rather than rests down in the small cut out in the top of the frame something is wrong with the spring/slide stop or its installed wrong.

I have the 27 (only because I carry a glock 22 for work) and I carry it EDC inside the waist at the four o'clock position every day. It's comfortable and light. The best part is the compatibility with the larger counterparts. For a glock 26 you could have a 19 or 17 mod. Mag for backup. Hell even a g18 mag if you wanna get silly.

I'm looking for slim and small... possibly ankle-carry size, and while the G26 can be, I'm afraid the weight might be too distracting.

Glocks,2zwcuo,AdwokatDiabel,7,Sun Mar 22 13:25:52 2015 UTC,"I wash't super jazzed up about the R51 either, but I asked our podcast listeners what they wanted to see it compared to on our Facebook page, and since they asked for it, and I already had the R51 vectors from when I did a similar chart when it released last year, I figured I may as well drop it in.  And as one of the seemingly few folks that got to shoot an R51, yes, it was terrible."
Glocks,2zwcuo,bmdaia,3,Sun Mar 22 14:03:38 2015 UTC,"That makes a whole lot more sense, thanks. I was looking at the chart and thought ""I've always wanted the Kahr"" and it pretty much sealed the deal, then I remembered I moved to Maryland and I should probably just buy a kale smoothie or whatever it is these people do.   Edit for mobile spelling mistakes."
Glocks,2zwcuo,stanleyfarnsworth,1 point,Sun Mar 22 16:06:18 2015 UTC,"FYI, the R51 is being re-released soon, so a comparison for future reference is relevant."
Glocks,2zwcuo,andrew_west,3,Sun Mar 22 19:45:28 2015 UTC,"True, but not if you rotate the 442 forward to show its true height/profile during pocket draw.  Nothing slips out of a pocket faster than a snubbie.  With full purchase I might add.  A 43 or a 26 (and a 42 for that matter) are not coming out of any pocket as quickly as a hammerless revolver."
Glocks,2zwcuo,FlieGerFaUstMe262,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"Plus, you can empty the snubnose from inside the pocket with zero problems. The pistol isn't going to fire more than twice from in a pocket unless you're incomprehensibly lucky. Probably only once and maybe not at all if you knock it out of battery.   Snubbie ftw."
Glocks,2zwcuo,pweekles,1 point,Sun Mar 22 19:44:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for doing this! It will be interesting to see if the height difference will offer any actual concealability advantages to the G43 over the Shield ... Just wish that capacity was still the same.

Glocks,2zwcuo,Rod_Belding,3,Sun Mar 22 14:10:27 2015 UTC,The shield is taller to accommodate the extra round. The eight round magazine is extended.  They will make plus base plates for the magazines on the 43 like on the 42.
Glocks,2zwcuo,redcell5,1 point,Sun Mar 22 13:39:22 2015 UTC,"The shield is .35"" taller. So, in my mind the G43 just gives you the option of going smaller. Granted, a +1 mag isn't out yet, but I assume we'll see that as well as a +2 & +3"
Glocks,2zwcuo,hmmquite,6,Sun Mar 22 21:45:42 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's awesome! Really surprised to see how small it is compared to the Glock 19."
Glocks,2zwcuo,sven_kirk,2,Sun Mar 22 13:08:32 2015 UTC,That was my takeaway as well. I have a 19 and it's too large for me to comfortably conceal. This makes me look at the 43 in a different light now.

Glocks,2zwcuo,joshq68,3,Sun Mar 22 15:02:43 2015 UTC,"OP, thanks for posting this. Pretty interesting seeing he actual size differences.  I was really looking forward to the release of the single stack 9, but the more I see about the size of the g43 the more I think the g26 is the right choice for me.  4mm thinner just doesn't seem like enough for me to give up 4 rounds.  Ultimately I'm going to have to handle them next to each other to decide which direction to go in."
Glocks,2zwcuo,pweekles,2,Sun Mar 22 14:37:48 2015 UTC,Thank you for the effort but these charts don't really give me (personally) a good profile comparison. Could you do it with the starting point being the trigger or end of barrel. Using the bottom of the grip is confusing because they are all different heights and angled differently. What would be really cool is if there was a program to maximize overlapped area.
Glocks,2zwcuo,Good2Go5280,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:36:33 2015 UTC,This.  I looked up the overall dimensions and it looks to me like the 43 is WAY too close to my 19 to be something else I'm going to get.

After some research, it seemed milling was the best option for two reasons. 1: Bringing the dot closer to the center of bore, some set ups are just too high for my liking. 2: The bodies of RMR's can have minor differences in tolerances, so having the slide milled to your specific RMR and then installed will result in a tighter fit and more solid maintenance of zero.

In my personal opinion, the 19 is the single best choice for a 9mm from Glock. It's just small enough to be considered a compact but holds and shoots like a full size. To put it another way, I'd be willing to bet if you wait and buy a 19 you'll never think back and say ""hm, maybe I should have bought the 17"" but I definitely think you'll have that thought if you buy a 17."

I was in a similar situation, I needed a one gun solution that I could conceal carry, open carry in the woods, have fun with at the range and use for home defense but also had cheap enough ammo to shoot all day if I wanted... the G19 just makes sense for that.  Just be patient, the way I got my G19 was going to every LGS in the area, the last one I went to didn't have one in stock and none showing online from their supplier. He had a G17 and G26 in the case and plenty of G22's but even he was hesitant to sell me one because I was really set on the G19. I was heading towards the door and he said ""wait a minute, let me try something"", he called his supplier and I heard him say ""okay go ahead and send that one to me"".

Glocks,2zs5bc,nate94gt,8,Sat Mar 21 15:42:33 2015 UTC,The 17 is a full size combat firearm and is not suited at all for concealment.

Glocks,2zs5bc,G19Gen3,4,Sat Mar 21 14:40:39 2015 UTC,"I have the 26, 19, 17, and 34.   I go back and forth regarding the 19. I can't decide if it's the best of both worlds or the worst.   Currently, I'd take a 26 and a 17. And, I'd dare say that if I could only have one Glock, I'd take the 26. If I could have two, I'd let the 17 or the 34 be second. (I just got the 34, so too soon to tell.)  Personally, I'll be surprised if you only end up with one Glock after you start making a little money. Since your funds are tight, and you want one gun that can be a ""jack of all trades, but master of none"" get the 19. Don't beat yourself up when you buy whatever model fits your next ""need"" either.   I'm 5'9"" and 160. So, to me, the 26 is my preferred carry gun. It's way more comfortable for me than a 19, and I am more confident with it than my Shield. As of right now, the 26 is my balance between capacity, capability, and comfort. At one time, my balance was a 380, but I've since grown tired of paying more for 380 just to have one gun in that caliber.   I have some spreadsheet data on how I've shot the various models. The 26 actually shoots the tightest groups for me UNTIL 20 yards. Then it's all about the 17. Also, Massad Ayoob seems to have similar results.   Anyhow, the 19 is a great compromise. I also like that it has a rail, which the 26 does not have.   I would highly suggest that you upgrade the sights as soon as you can afford to. I like a fiber front and a blacked out rear. Ameriglo has sets like this for a whopping $50. I would not do anything else to the gun until you're skill is such that your making a ragged hole (or close to it) at 7 yards with the stock trigger on slow fire.   Other than the sights, I prefer to stock up on G17 mags. I really wish all my G19 mags I bought were G17s.   Anyhow, don't fret. You'll get a great gun either way, and worst case, if you feel you've made a 'grave mistake' AND funds are super tight, you won't have any trouble selling or trading for another model. That is one of the great things about Glocks. There is a big liquid market for them."

Glocks,2zs5bc,thenatureboy_,2,Sat Mar 21 20:24:15 2015 UTC,"I'll offer a contrasting opinion. I have both. The 17 feels better in my hand, and my hands are not huge. Part of this could be the fact that my 19 is Gen3 and my 17 is Gen4, so I've been able to adjust the 17 backstrap for a ""perfect"" fit. The 19 is even a tad larger than I'd prefer for a CCW.      It comes down to what you will primarily use it for. If I definitely was going to have one gun and CC is a requirement then the 19 wins. If CC is ""nice to have"" but not required, and you want something to possibly use in competition, then get the 17. If HD is your primary use case, just get the 19 since it felt better in your hand."
Glocks,2zs5bc,1ce9ine,2,Sat Mar 21 15:27:24 2015 UTC,"I've got both. I would not want to carry the 17, because every inch feels like a mile when you take printing and weight into the consideration of daily carry. That little bit of grip length may be enough of a difference to make your shirt ride and expose your gun.  I carried a 29 for a few months, and while the subcompact concealed exceptionally, it wasn't a gun that I wanted to shoot. And more importantly, it wasn't a caliber I competed or really trained with. (Shoot what you carry, carry what you shoot). I ended up going back to the 19 because it's a very shootable IDPA gun, and would even work in IPSC (although I run my 17 for 3G and ISPC).   The 19 is probably my favorite all-around gun. It's versatile and really brings the best of everything together. Hold out if you need a gun that can tackle more than one task."
Glocks,2zs5bc,ZER0THE0RY,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:03:48 2015 UTC,I agree with everything you said. I shoot my 19 frequently. I like carrying what I train with.

I mean do you really think that even a decent portion of what you pay for a G17, for example, goes towards the polymer and metal used to make it?  Come on.  I think I recall reading somewhere (believe it was that book on Glock by Paul Barrett) that the cost of materials to make a Glock 17 was around $70.  When you buy a G17 you're getting about 70 bucks worth of plastic and steel, that's it...and about $500 worth of superb engineering to make sure it goes bang every time including and especially when it's your ass on the line, so quit bitching...  The only problem is that I've got a Kahr PM9 that has been just absolutely fantastic so I'm really going to have to work hard to find an excuse to buy this thing, though I probably will eventually."

Glocks,2zpcic,Moscamst,15,Fri Mar 20 15:51:45 2015 UTC,"Just look at the competition. CM9 is smaller and holds the same capacity. Both the Shield and XDs are roughly the same size and hold 7 (in fact, with aftermarket mag springs the Shield can hold 8 in a flush magazine). PPS effectively already filled the role that the G43 is trying to. Hell, all four of the pistols I've listed (CM9, Shield, XDs, and PPS) are thinner than an inch while the G43 is thicker than an inch. Don't even get me started on the MSRP.  An expensive gun that is too large relative to the competition while carrying fewer rounds trying to fill a niche already filled. Only reason to buy this gun is if you're a Glockophile."
Glocks,2zpcic,Killtrend,7,Fri Mar 20 15:55:54 2015 UTC,"You don't buy the gun, you buy the name. It's like the Ford vs Chevy debate.

I'll take the Glock. The magazine size is... Unfortunate, but it's not a deal breaker. If I'm buying a 6-7 round capable CC, I'm already making unfortunate CC choices."
Glocks,2zpcic,capteurdereves,2,Fri Mar 20 16:06:22 2015 UTC,"It's all about personal preference. I don't like Kahr's long trigger pulls. Also, some of their pistols are finicky and unreliable. The shield trigger isn't so great, luckily they removed the thumb safety. The XDs is a great gun and feels quality, but the grip safety kills it for me. The PPS is also a nice gun, but the stupid striker disconnect ""feature"" build into the backstraps kills it for me.  I think one of the best single stack 9mms on the market is the Ruger LC9s. However, I'll probably just wait 6mo-1yr for the G43 since I'm most comfortable shooting and carrying Glocks. Then again, if the difference between the 26 and 43 is minimal, I'll probably just stick to my 26."

Glock also redesigned the ejector in their 9mm pistols to combat brass-to-face issues. Seeing as you're talking about Gen 2's, you're probably still using the 336 ejector  which you may want to try replacing with the 30274 ejector from LWD. You'll just need the little metal part (slides out of the plastic housing) since a Gen 4 trigger housing won't fit a Gen 2 pistol.  As for accuracy, I've replaced all my targets with Post-It notes since they're cheaper and the Glock never has problems hitting them. Occasionally I'll compete with a friend to shoot the staples off my targets. No matter what I do, I always seem to come back to a Glock."

However, the 29SF grip is significantly thicker than the 19. Also, the 19 feels somewhat top heavy due to the larger slide.  Look for a Glock 30 to hold. Same gun as the 29, just different caliber. However, the standard Glock 30 mag will be longer than the flush fitting 29 mag."

The grip even with the extension is about 1/16"" shorter as well, and that is on the front, the back is at least 1/2"" shorter so there is just a lot less ""gun"" to hold onto. And in shooting the mag will move under your pinkie.  I say would combined with the added thickness I would say the grip is about 1/2 as easy to draw and 25% less easy to shoot.  Some people complain about the grip extension pinching too.   All that said the 29/30 is a brilliant CCW.  MUCH more concealable on the hip or 3-4 O Clock than the 19.  If you carry appendix then the 29/30 is a waste go with the 19/23 as there is no benefit to the shorter grip in front.    Better yet get both.  The 29 is a crazy little beast.   If you can tame it the 19 will feel like a Ruger .22"

Never mind the fact that you'll love the extra control from the pinky.   If your answer is ""because I want to cc it, too"", well that's fine and dandy, but keep in mind its a chunky little bugger (like the 30).   Its not the perfect gun for just about any situation, but it is a perfect one gun for almost every situation."
Glocks,2zpapc,lilsanch,1 point,Fri Mar 20 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"I'd opt for the 29 over the 20 because even though the 20 is more practical for woods use, I'm not made out of money and think the 29 provides more options and an overall more useful tool with a few conversion barrels. With a pinky extender on the small mag, I would get all of my fingers on board and control it that way. For extra mags, I would just get the 20 mags because why not."

Glocks,2zpapc,southernbenz,2,Fri Mar 20 14:56:35 2015 UTC,"I've been reading about the 10mm round specifically and it other than the recoil, what's not to like? It's a beast that has great ballistics.   Just making sure, you're going to daily carry in .40, right?  I'll get stormed with downvotes for this, but 10mm over-penetrates.    Hunting?  Sure.  Concealed carry?  ...most likely, not.    Anyone would be horribly irresponsible to carry 10mm on a crowded subway car in a downtown location.  Inner-city living consists of packed restaurants, office buildings, public transportation, stadiums, etc.  I live a highly urban lifestyle and I cannot carry 10mm.  10mm, magnums, bottlenecks, those are all great competition and hunting calibers, but pretty impractical for us city-slickers."
Glocks,2zpapc,capteurdereves,3,Fri Mar 20 14:40:08 2015 UTC,"but 10mm over-penetrates.   Actually, sometimes it's quite the opposite. Bullets meant for hunting will over penetrate, like the Hornady XTP.  However, bullets designed for 40SW velocities will overexpand and under penetrate. Load Gold Dots or HSTs to 10mm velocities and they penetrate less than standard 40SW.  This is why I got out of 10mm. The increased recoil, lack of bullets designed specifically for 10mm velocities, and having to chase around expensive Starline brass made me sell my Glock 10mms."
Glocks,2zpapc,lilsanch,2,Fri Mar 20 22:34:07 2015 UTC,"Good point here. But for an outdoorsman, who would use the 10mm power occasionally, as op pointed out, he could pick up a 40 barrel for urban use and be good to go."

Glocks,2zprqu,iupvoteboobpics,3,Sat Mar 21 13:49:58 2015 UTC,"I would say he is anticipating his shot. Which is the most common thing I've found with new shooters. That or I'd agree with the other user who stated he was jerking the trigger. OP I highly recommend that you research ""dry fire"" drills which you can do at home and don't require ammo. An old trick used at police academies is to place a dime on the front sight post and ""dry fire"" the pistol. If you can do this while aiming at a target without causing the dime to fall off the front sight post you have a successful smooth trigger squeeze. Repeat this hundreds of times and you will develop muscle memory which will then translate to better groupings on the range."
Glocks,2zprqu,iupvoteboobpics,3,Sun Mar 22 10:05:47 2015 UTC,"Also, a trick I use on shooters is to load a snap cap round or ""dummy"" round randomly into the shooters magazine. I then tell them to shoot slowly the entire magazine. If the shooter is anticipating his shot it will be very obvious once the ""dummy"" round is loaded. After a while the shooter starts to take more time and focus on his fundamentals as it gets embarrassing for the shooter to dip his gun forward awkwardly when the dummy round is struck and there is no bang"
Glocks,2zprqu,GoodGuyGlocker,2,Sun Mar 22 10:11:57 2015 UTC,"Grip the pistol snug with your strong hand (right hand if you are a right handed shooter) but not a death grip. Then with your off hand grip the pistol very firmly. You actually control or grip the gun with your off hand. This is so your trigger finger movement doesn't cause the gun to shift as you squeeze. Focus on your sight picture, front sight should be in focus, and squeeze the trigger so slowly that it surprises you when the gun fires. Repeat and these fundamentals will become easier and you will be able to shoot faster over time accurately with training regularly."

A reduced power striker spring will go a long way in reducing trigger pull, but make sure you match that with a lightened and extended striker for reliability.

Drilled trigger housing for pre and over travel adjustment. 45 degree cut striker lug and mirror polish with ultra fine ceramic files.

Iowa you can take an online course in 20 minutes, print out a pdf, then while you wait you get a printed ID card with a photo like a drivers license.  Now with Utah I took a course where I had to get fingerprinted, then they send the info in for you, then when Utah finally gets around to charging my credit card they've got 60 days from that date to actually send the thing out.

Are you in Folsom?  Edit:  Cool story that happened a few days ago.  My parents live in what is considered rural El Dorado Hills.  For the houses that have land, it's legal to shoot on.  These houses are super close to developed areas that have cookie cutter houses on little to no land.  Some guys were shooting, and I guess it pissed the neighbors in the developed section off.  They went to the next town hall meeting to complain.  After hearing it, my mom expected the classic California response of putting down the gun owners.  Nope, the complaining parties got told that they should not have purchased a house in rural areas that allow and will continue to allow shooting on private property.

I put the Ghost 3.5lb connector in mine... the difference is definitely noticeable. I do like it but I had an accidental double-tap the first range trip out with it because it was lighter than I was used to.

I can't visualize things well so I will have to see how it compares with a direct comparison, but the only things I don't like about my Shield at the height and the trigger.  If the 43 is short enough it may be a reason to consider it over the Shield for me, since the height of a gun is one of the biggest factors when carrying at the 4-5 oclock position IWB like I do.   Of course, I could also look into some Apex trigger upgrades and just suck up the .35 of an inch difference to get an additional round of capacity. Decisions decisions."
Glocks,2zi9c0,ajs2294,2,Thu Mar 19 00:30:50 2015 UTC,Time and first hand experience will tell. But I highly doubt .35 inches will make any significant difference in regards to conceivability/printing. I'll likely be sticking with my Shield.

Glocks,2zi9c0,ghostfox1_gfaqs,10,Wed Mar 18 21:42:00 2015 UTC,The gun seems too big to hold that few rounds.

Glocks,2zi9c0,MotoFox,3,Wed Mar 18 21:51:50 2015 UTC,"That has been my feeling. For me to step down in firepower(capacity) I want a real reduction in size. The G43 is not that.

Out of what I have in my safe (and get a decent safe, because now that you have a firearm, you'll want more than one), the only time my shotgun, G27 or G22 have a cable lock through it is if Im not home. Otherwise, its got a full magazine and an open action OR one of them is on my person.   And invest in a good holster. Im a huge IWB (inside waistband) holster fan. Bought a clip on/tuckable one from Shielded Holsters and liked it. Then wore my buddy's Alien Gear IWB holster with a 9mm shield, and fell in love with the Alien Gear.

Sometimes they lock, but not very often and not very well. You might not find a use for the cable lock right away. After you buy more guns and you end up traveling with them, it's nice to know your shotgun has a cable through the action at your cousin's place so his kids can't get away with anything."

At bare-minimum, go buy a MIC-Holster and keep that trigger covered.  Some people advocated keeping a pistol on your bedside table.  Personally, I prefer a shotgun for home defense.  When I wake up in the morning, I drink enough coffee to kill most African land animals.  So, if I was to be woken at 3am by the sound of a window shattering and footsteps in my hallway, I won't be able to aim very well.  I'd rather rack a shotgun slide and throw a couple shells of birdshot in the general vicinity of the assailant.  But, I'm never going to talk bad about anyone who chooses to use a pistol for home defense.  I know myself, and you know yourself.  If you can aim a gun at 3am, power to you."

Most of the great 1911 smiths (Chuck Rogers, Ted Yost, etc.) have said that you simply can't make the 1911 design reliable with anything smaller than a Commander slide, it's just inherent to the design.  Now, you can make something smaller than that which looks like a 1911 (see: Sig P938), but the internals of it will have to have been modified so much that it's really not a 1911 anymore, the design is totally different.  Oh, and eventually you're going to realize 9mm is just fine and gosh wouldn't it be nice to have something smaller and lighter, and then you're going to get a G26 or G19 for carry :P"

Also, the Beretta 92 platform is a superb one but the reason a lot of people in the military hate it is because of how poorly they tend to be maintained (which results in malfunctions) - if Glocks were treated like that they'd perform similarly.  Seriously, search this out if you like, you'll see a lot of forum posts by people who are former military, hated the M9, then bought a 92/M9 when they got out and love it now because they started off with a brand new one and then properly maintained it."

Wilson even got Beretta to machine them to extra-tight tolerances so they're especially accurate (the 92 was already an inherently tight and accurate pistol).

Glocks,2zeg7t,MotoFox,9,Wed Mar 18 00:46:07 2015 UTC,If that is the true size then I see no reason to switch from a 26. I don't see a huge benefit for reducing capacity. Am I missing something?
Glocks,2zeg7t,ZaneMasterX,13,Wed Mar 18 07:50:39 2015 UTC,"Weight and width. Yes, for some the 26 or 19 is not an issue but for some people every oz and quarter inch matters.   Take my wife for example, she is 5'6"" 130 lbs athletic build. 19 is 100% out of the question for her to carry and the 26 is too fat for her to conceal without a substantial print. She also hates the weight and grip width of the 26. Enter the G42, she loves it. Its still on the larger size but she has no issues carrying it because of the width and weight.   Personally I love the size of the g42 and grab it for quick trips. I normally carry the 19 but it's night and day carrying the 42 over the 19. Now if there was a ss9mm such as the g43 it would be perfect for my quick trips. If it's the same size as the g42 there is a good chance I'll buy two, one for me and one for the wife."
Glocks,2zeg7t,MotoFox,3,Wed Mar 18 00:33:07 2015 UTC,Appreciate the different point of view. As someone who has no problem concealing a g19 comfortably I am looking for something substantially smaller if I am going to downgrade. But it makes sense that even a 19 May be too large for some.
Glocks,2zeg7t,JMS442,5,Wed Mar 18 00:48:50 2015 UTC,"The G42 is like a G19 shrunk down in every dimension.  You really have to hold one to realize how much smaller it is. Small enough to fit in my jeans front pocket, which is not possible with a G26.  For me the biggest advantage is how easy it is to shoot compared to the LCP, etc... I'll take the tradeoff in size for shooting confidence.    That being said I'm still a huge G19 fan.  It just usually stays in the truck now."
Glocks,2zeg7t,doitforjimmy,2,Wed Mar 18 01:58:33 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about my next guns, a G43 seems like a good one and then I'd turn the 19 into a range/woods gun.  Then in the future upgrade to a 10mm or something more powerful for a woods gun.    Hopefully they do this.  I'll start saving now."

Glocks,2zejcd,Condhor,5,Wed Mar 18 01:39:08 2015 UTC,From your previous comment:   It's an objective fact that something smaller is easier to conceal than something larger.   I own a 27 and have had the chance to shoot/carry a 19. They do not have the same concealability.

Glocks,2zejcd,tuccified,7,Wed Mar 18 00:31:18 2015 UTC,MSRP is usually higher than street but that should put the street price around $475ish which is kinda high considering you can buy a shield for $100less.
Glocks,2zejcd,nimoythedestroyer,5,Wed Mar 18 15:29:51 2015 UTC,I thought Glock had dropped the ball with the G42 but they went and proved they can make even worse decisions. A 6+1 gun the same dimensions as the Shield AND with an MSRP of $580. I'll stick with the Shield.

As far as everything else goes, I can't personally guarantee that all is compatible, but you don't often see a differentiation between connectors and trigger kits for gen 2 and gen 3 guns. Same goes for barrels and spring kits. If there was a compatability issue, manufacturers would be selling you different parts to fit different generations."

If not, Gen3 is probably fine and likely cheaper, though remember to factor in the cost of the extra magazine. I went with Gen4."
Glocks,2zb8db,slalomz,2,Tue Mar 17 03:24:56 2015 UTC,I chose gen 4 for my small hands. I wanted a 21 and the gen 3 did not fit in my hands at all. The gen 4 is a good fit. Barely. My dad has huge hands. He can slap a back strap on and shoot it just fine. So having that option is pretty great.
Glocks,2zb8db,rapey_tree_salesman,2,Tue Mar 17 17:14:50 2015 UTC,Gen 4 is actually 2mm thinner from backstrap to trigger as well. People with smaller hands are going to appreciate the smaller size. The medium backstrap makes the Gen4 equal to the Gen3 in size.
Glocks,2zb8db,AHappyMeal,2,Tue Mar 17 23:06:21 2015 UTC,"Grip texture on the 4 was much better in my experience. I couldn't handle a 3rd gen, just because of how uncomfortable it felt to me. Gen 4 feels a lot better."

Glocks,2zb8db,Zickefoose,5,Tue Mar 17 12:11:40 2015 UTC,That and the overly large mag release is why I went with a gen 3.
Glocks,2zb8db,G19Gen3,5,Tue Mar 17 14:06:28 2015 UTC,"The rougher grip texture on the Gen 4 turned me away, but a lot of people prefer it. Nothing beats shooting, or at least handling, to see what you think. If you won't be carrying then you won't have to worry about it being irritating against your body. Being comfortable carrying and holding the gun is more important than the other ""improvements"" the Gen 4 offers so I went with a Gen 3 and am very happy with that decision."
Glocks,2zb8db,OtherPaleBlueDot,10,Tue Mar 17 04:23:00 2015 UTC,"I personally prefer Gen. 4s because of the more aggressive grip texture and enlarged magazine release.

Glocks,2zb8db,421dave,3,Tue Mar 17 11:21:37 2015 UTC,"You're not going to lose anything by going with the 3rd gen over the 4th. The 4th does net you the extra mag but you pay for it as 4th gens generally run about $50 more than 3rd. I've had both. My primary 19 is currently a 3rd gen as I love FDE Glocks and found a great deal on a Vickers 19. I've put thousands of rounds through both generations and I've never had a failure. Either way, it's a Glock. The 4th gen gets you a SLIGHTLY smaller frame and the backstraps and a better mag release with rougher frame texture. You will find the new texture very irritating for CCW but it's nothing a little sandpaper can't fix. The 3rd gen has a slightly better stock trigger imo and is more comfortable to carry. Good choice with the 19 either way."
Glocks,2zb8db,421dave,1 point,Tue Mar 17 11:19:22 2015 UTC,How much better would you say the trigger is? Would it be a deciding factor for a fairly new shooter like myself? Or would I only notice shooting them one after the other?
Glocks,2zb8db,MotoFox,2,Tue Mar 17 11:39:53 2015 UTC,"It's not a deciding factor. Glocks kinda have crappy triggers anyway so it's not like you're missing out on much and you're not going to be going from good to horrible. Just kinda crappy to kinda crappy -1. Either way, you're making a good choice. I'd check out a 4th gen and see if you like it. If you like both equally, shop for the best price and buy whatever you find."
Glocks,2zb8db,OcSpeed,3,Tue Mar 17 17:20:29 2015 UTC,"If you have a ""go to"" gun store I would stop in and handle both, side by side.

While not exactly issues, they did a firing test on a gen 4 1000 rounds and it failed because something inside melted, not sure exactly what. When they did the test on a gen 3, it worked perfectly fine afterwards. They say that the gen 3 are kind of the ""tried and true"" Glocks as they have been used for years by Police and are reliable.

Glocks,2z8cwy,bourbonbeatsboredom,2,Mon Mar 16 19:33:07 2015 UTC,It should be able to meet power factor while shooting softer than .40 s&w. That'd be my guess as to why.
Glocks,2z8cwy,8bit9mm,2,Mon Mar 16 19:54:17 2015 UTC,But giving up 3 rounds on mag capacity seems like a bad trade off.  Unless this is for Lim-10 in which case it doesn't matter.

Glocks,2zb1o5,Kilcarnup,2,Tue Mar 17 02:18:34 2015 UTC,"Lololol you suck. :-P  But honestly, you probably just need to grip the gun higher with your thumb, and tighter with your fingers. Not white knuckle tight, but tight enough to reduce the guns rotation in your hand that may cause your thumb to slip down. When I shoot, the tip of my thumb doesn't even contact the gun because I kept accidentally locking the slide back while firing. Thus the only way to avoid it was to have a firmer grip, and adjust my thumb placement. Only difference to your situation is that you would need to move it up, instead of down. Hope this helps."
Glocks,2zb1o5,Aerial_Screw,2,Tue Mar 17 02:58:40 2015 UTC,I try and get my thumb as high up on the frame as I can. It's really no where near the release when I'm shooting one handed.
Glocks,2z70ot,x8d,27,Mon Mar 16 03:13:11 2015 UTC,"Call me cynical but... Probably a placeholder product betting on the release of a single stack 9mm so they can get people signed up and purchasing mags from them. Really doubt this page is based on anything concrete.  10 round single stack mag? I don't think that's very likely.  EDIT: here's some proof the image is fudged...   Compare ""Glock 43"" mag vs 10-round G19 mag from a different site. It's the same exact picture."
Glocks,2z70ot,slalomz,3,Mon Mar 16 03:48:36 2015 UTC,"Oh I don't doubt the picture is not actually of the new mag, I just thought it was interesting that they were announcing the mag already before Glock officially announced the gun.  I actually think your theory is more likely, but it does seem odd that they would specify 10 rounds unless they knew something we didn't."
Glocks,2z70ot,slalomz,6,Mon Mar 16 03:59:33 2015 UTC,Seeing as it's a CA legal mag website and they have a 10-round limit over there it makes some sense that they'd just arbitrarily pick 10-rounds.
Glocks,2z70ot,Ruhlmdc,8,Mon Mar 16 04:02:21 2015 UTC,10 rounds?  Maybe an extended length mag?  I don't think they're fitting 10 rounds in a single stack unless they make the frame 19 sized.
Glocks,2z70ot,G19Gen3,5,Mon Mar 16 03:29:29 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that be terrible? All the waiting and desire for a single stack 9mm from Glock and they come out with one that's just shy of a full size silhouette. I'm really hoping it's shield size.
Glocks,2z70ot,tuccified,4,Mon Mar 16 03:51:36 2015 UTC,"For the sake of all the people wanting a SS 9mm carry gun, I sure hope it's extended length and the stock length is a 6 or 7 rounder."

Glocks,2z70ot,southeast_boarder,-1,Mon Mar 16 17:20:09 2015 UTC,"I've used the site to buy a bunch of stuff, they're legitimate.

Glocks,2z70ot,QuattroStig,3,Mon Mar 16 19:34:27 2015 UTC,Single stack 10rds would make the grip the size of a full size 1911. This is either a joke or a place holder.
Glocks,2z70ot,gaston19,2,Mon Mar 16 22:16:04 2015 UTC,Only thing I can figure is the 43 being more like a scaled down 26 rather than a larger 42 if that makes sense. Now I'm really interested in what this thing will look like after all.   EDIT: actually 10 rounds of 9mm would put the grip length near the size of a full size 1911

Glocks,2zajbr,My_wifes_husband,11,Mon Mar 16 23:48:03 2015 UTC,I'm sure you either did a good job installing all the aftermarket stuff or had a smith do it but personally I would pay less for yours than a similarly used bone stock one. I have no idea what the street price is on used G19s but I would tap out at 350 for yours.
Glocks,2zajbr,salt_pepper,-21,Tue Mar 17 00:11:38 2015 UTC,"Not to sound rude, but if you have no idea how much custom glocks go for, then should you be commenting?"
Glocks,2zajbr,wckdwabbit,16,Tue Mar 17 00:19:06 2015 UTC,Generally custom guns don't sell for much to buyers who know what they are looking at unless it was customized by a reputable shop/gunsmith.  Without seeing it I'd say the $350 may be about right.  If I had a chance to handle and inspect it I may offer up to $400.

Glocks,2zajbr,Gadnuk_,8,Tue Mar 17 03:06:34 2015 UTC,"Their point was anytime you customize functional parts on a glock it loses its main draw which is reliability, as well as the potential that someone did a poor job replacing parts causing damage to critical components.   Replace original parts and it will sell quicker and for more. Think of it like buying a used car. If you see a car is for sale with a massive spoiler, turbocharger, bodykit and custom exhaust, there is every chance that a stock model with the same age and mileage will be worth more because it will be more reliable and still has its warranty."

Glocks,2zajbr,slalomz,4,Tue Mar 17 00:46:55 2015 UTC,Valid point.
Glocks,2zajbr,slalomz,5,Tue Mar 17 00:58:41 2015 UTC,Your version of a custom Glock is not everyone else's version of a custom Glock. Just because you put money into it to get it how you like doesn't mean someone else is going to pay extra for it if it's not exactly how they like.
Glocks,2zajbr,cthompson07,-1,Tue Mar 17 00:39:23 2015 UTC,"I understand that. Sounds like I'm not going to get anything close to the cost of what I put into it. I was hoping to get close ton$1000, but that's highly unlikely."
Glocks,2zajbr,that_gun_guy,3,Tue Mar 17 01:01:25 2015 UTC,Yeah it sucks but that's the downside to customizing stuff out. Custom ARs have the same problem. If I was going to buy a used gun from someone I'd want it to be as close to stock as possible.  If you just want to lose as little as possible I'd recommend returning it to its stock configuration and trying to sell the parts out separately.

Unless you can get dealer rates on parts or are very very lucky you will always loose value.  No mater what you put into it, how ever perfect each parts is there is something that someone will swap out. However custom comp parts do hold value better on g17 or g34 since those are more common in competition than g19.  G19s tend to have a more carry draw which leads people to wanting reliability over performance."

Glocks,2z6yvh,souobixo,5,Mon Mar 16 04:32:24 2015 UTC,"I believe you need an FFL to bid correct?  Incorrect. Anyone can bid on gunbroker.com as long as they have a valid account. Here's what you do:   Win the auction.  Contact the seller, pay for the pistol/shipping, and get their fax number.  Choose an FFL in your area and have them fax a copy of their FFL to the seller.  When the pistol comes in, your FFL calls you and you go fill out the normal paperwork. The only difference is that you only pay him a transfer fee.  Go to the range and blow at least 200 rounds."

Glocks,2z5g2p,maintenanceman42,1 point,Sun Mar 15 21:14:16 2015 UTC,Blue label is reserved for LEO and is usually a really good price.

Still cheaper for a new Glock out the door than some used ones of other models are going for.   I'm not sure I understand why these are so cheap. Best I can gather is that more people are put off by (supposed) negatives of the compensated models than are drawn to the positives?

Glocks,2ywv41,getsome13,3,Fri Mar 13 14:28:54 2015 UTC,"Based on a false premise. You shouldn't be lining up three dots in a row anyway. But that's why we have fiber optic sights. Fiber in the front, flat black in the rear. Up close, put the fiber in the notch. Far away, line up the top of the sight, using this same whatever brain magic they say makes their sights work."
Glocks,2ywv41,HoberShort,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:12:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this. I'd never heard this before. I'd had a different idea in my head about aiming for longer ranges.  I was lining up the 3 dots, and then aiming higher by an amount for range. It had not occurred to me to put the front sight above the rear sight and then aim where I want to hit.  Does anyone else do this? Is this the common method, and I've just been relatively successful with my method, and not known about it?"
Glocks,2ywv41,LambastingFrog,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:26:11 2015 UTC,"put the front sight above the rear sight   I'm not sure what you mean here. A well-regulated (zeroed) set of sights should always be most accurate when the front post is squarely in the notch, with the top of the front post at the same height as the rears and centered horizontally between them, giving rise to the catchphrase ""equal height, equal light"" (equal height of each post, equal light on each side of the front post).  What I meant is that for up close stuff where accuracy is less vital, as long as I can see my fiber optic dot somewhere in the notch, that's good enough. If the tops aren't lined up, the shot will be slightly low, but at 5 yards that's an inch or two. Doesn't matter.   At distance, I get an equal height, equal light sight picture. I know on my guns the sights are set up so that the top of the front blade ""slices"" the bullseye I want to hit in half (or in most cases, the highest scoring zone of a cardboard target) so I place the lined up sights over the target where I want them to hit and press the trigger without disturbing the sights.   Does that make sense?"
Glocks,2ywv41,HoberShort,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:32:33 2015 UTC,"put the front sight above the rear sight   I'm not sure what you mean here   Probably because I misunderstood what you said. I thought you meant that for aiming at things further away you know where to line your front sight up with the back sight for the right angle to compensate for the drop at, say, 100 yards. All I've ever done is line up the 3 dots and aim for the head of the target at 100 yards instead of the chest.  I'm still not certain why you say you shouldn't be lining up the 3 dots in a row, though. It seems to be correct for vertical alignment of the three, although, as you note it's less important the closer you get."
Glocks,2ywv41,LambastingFrog,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:52:56 2015 UTC,"not certain why you say you shouldn't be lining up the 3 dots in a row   Because, as the makers of these sights note, that's slow and imprecise. But you don't need weirdo hourglass/triangle shapes to get something that's easy to line up. Just the top of the front and rear post are fine.  If it's not worth changing the sights out on a gun I have, I'll at least take a sharpie to the rear dots. It gives you one dot to look at for speed, otherwise you're lining up the top of the posts. Much better."

Glocks,2ywv41,LambastingFrog,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:46:09 2015 UTC,"Sharpie works pretty good, and you can take it right off with a little rubbing alcohol. I've done it to painted rears and night sights both and neither the sharpie nor the alcohol were any harm to the sight.   It does take a little getting used to because there's less information coming in to your brain which at first feels worse, but when you realize that was information (the position of the rear dots) that you didn't actually need, it gives you more cognitive bandwidth to spend on tracking the front sight and lets you shoot quicker because you only have one thing to watch instead of three."

Glocks,2ywv41,LambastingFrog,3,Fri Mar 13 19:25:14 2015 UTC,"It looks interesting, but I have some reservations:  I don't understand how the rear sight can be in focus enough when the front sight's in focus, unless you have a tiny sight radius.  I don't know that it provides much benefit until a reasonable distance out - is that distance longer than handgun ranges?  In short, it's a great concept, and I'd love to shoot it on someone else's gun."

They (Blade-tech, Comp-tac, Safariland, Blackhawk) prefer injection molded plastic that they can crank out en masse. On the other hand, since every kydex holster has to be molded by hand, it tends to fit cottage industry much better, which is why we see a million and one independent guys making these holsters.   Find some local guys that look like they do good work and give them an email. See if you can handle some samples somewhere if you're still worried.  Any respectable custom kydex maker will have some kind of return period. Since holsters are such a particular, individual thing, sometimes you just have to order one and try it for a week and then return it."
Glocks,2yxkop,HoberShort,2,Fri Mar 13 19:03:52 2015 UTC,Comp-tac is molded and hand cut kydex.  Safariland and Blade Tech(to a certain extent) are bad examples because they make retention holsters that are fundamentally different in design. Kydex wouldn't work for that.

I own a blackhawk sportster and use it for the range or if I'm just running to the gas station, getting the mail, working outside, or something quick but the glock sport just conceals better for me.

Glocks,2yurpw,nimoythedestroyer,1 point,Fri Mar 13 10:29:14 2015 UTC,This may vary from suppressor to suppressor and from test to test but I have seen tests that have found this to be true.  Most people who have at least looked into cans have heard that the extra space between the bullet and the baffles/end cap causes sub caliber bullets to be louder when shot through a larger can.  What many people don't consider is that the extra volume of the larger can makes up for this difference.  I know I've seen videos where they are taking decibel readings with both a 9mm and a .45 suppressor and they come out with readings that are just about the same.  I also know I've seen at least one where the .45 suppressor was quieter than the 9mm with the same ammo.  I haven't had a chance to test this out with my TiRant 9 and TiRant 45 (having trouble getting a 9mm piston for the TiRant 45) but my TiRant 9and Osprey 45 sound pretty damn close to my ear (not proof of anything due to them being different designs and the lack of testing equipment).
Glocks,2yurpw,jayemo,1 point,Fri Mar 13 12:52:37 2015 UTC,Are there suppressors with swappable end caps? And would this alleviate the problem?
Glocks,2yurpw,wckdwabbit,1 point,Fri Mar 13 21:17:47 2015 UTC,There's talk that SilencerCo might start selling end caps for their Octane suppressors.
Glocks,2yurpw,NVdustytrail,2,Fri Mar 13 22:17:43 2015 UTC,"I would go with a lone wolf barrel for this as well.  As far as cans go I have used my Osprey 45 and TiRant 45 on my 1911 with great success.  .45 is a great round to suppress and they are both excellent suppressors.  In order to buy and and register a suppressor there are a couple ways to do it.  The two most popular are to buy it as an individual or to buy it through a trust.  Your going to want to do some research as to which method is better for you.  My personal preference is through a trust.  Going the individual route requires a bit more paper work, Law enforcement approval, fingerprints and you will not be allowed to let others (spouse, adult children, etc.) use the suppressor without you being present.  With a trust any trustees can possess the registered item and as long as the trust is set up correctly you can amend the trust to add and remove trustees as needed.  As to the actual process go ahead and give this a read.    I'm sure it varies state to state but in my experience in Florida buying a can is pretty simple and easy.  The wait sucks and the wallet takes a beating but the process itself isn't too bad and if you go the trust route its extremely simple."

Glocks,2yutcd,the_tortfeasor,2,Fri Mar 13 00:35:25 2015 UTC,Aren't we all. Seems like they would've engineered the 19 mags first since it is the more popular gun. I guess they wanted to iron out all the wrinkles first.
Glocks,2yutcd,razumny,8,Fri Mar 13 07:52:56 2015 UTC,"Well, there's that, and also the fact that the 17 mags are compatible with all 9mm Glocks, which the 19 mags aren't."
Glocks,2yutcd,southernbenz,2,Fri Mar 13 08:27:03 2015 UTC,"Seems like they would've engineered the 19 mags first since it is the more popular gun.   Small correction: More popular for us plebeians.  In terms of sale volume, Glock has sold many more G17's (and G22's, G21's) to agencies than they have sold G19's to us plebeians."
Glocks,2yutcd,southernbenz,2,Fri Mar 13 18:01:06 2015 UTC,"Ah, forgot about that. But are police departments and agencies really going to buy off-brand magazines when the price difference is not massive and the depts/agencies are tax payer funded?"
Glocks,2yutcd,southernbenz,0,Fri Mar 13 23:58:17 2015 UTC,"The initial target will be for agencies to buy these Magpul magazines in large quantities and run them as pseudo quality control testing before being released in different calibers and sizes for us  plebeians  to use.   Also, Magpul knows that they can sell these G17 mags in large quantities and quickly recoup the tooling investment for the injection molds. Once this G17 run turns profitable, Magpul can start using that profit on additional injection mold tooling for different size magazines for us plebeians to use.   Will agencies buy off-brand and cheaper magazines? Absolutely. Budget cuts have forced agencies to cut worse corners than simply an off-brand gun magazine..."

Glocks,2yutcd,Jwast,2,Sat Mar 14 03:08:52 2015 UTC,Because Glock factory mags suck?
Glocks,2yutcd,souobixo,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:20:17 2015 UTC,"Glock got away from all polymer mags for a reason. Granted, most of that was to make they drop free, but I've never really fully trusted magazines with polymer feed lips. I own a few PMAGs. I use them and they're fine in my AR-15's. The problem I have with these new Magpul mags is that the cartridge stack in a pistol mag is pushing itself upward with way more pressure than any AR-15 mag once you've got the last round in. My total tally for Glock ownership is: two 17's, two 20's, three 22's, one 23, one 26, and one 35 over the last 20 years.  None of them were especially forgiving when I came to slipping that last round in under the feed lips. (That sounds filthy.) I really like several of Magpul's products, but  I'm in the group of the 100 last guys on Reddit you'd call a Magpul fanboy.  Their products have to be ""better enough"" than OEM to justify any price difference above or below. At only $4 cheaper each, I'll pass. Glock mags are BEYOND proven. I'll buy three OEM Glock mags and just skip the Wendy's drive through on the way home."
Glocks,2yutcd,Jwast,1 point,Fri Mar 13 19:49:40 2015 UTC,"Even people that for some reason absolutely hate Magpul still agree that their magazines are pretty much as good as it gets for AR's.   I'm definitely going to pick one of these up and if it proves to be reliable, then these will be what I use for range time since they're 20-25% cheaper."
Glocks,2yutcd,souobixo,0,Fri Mar 13 22:20:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say they are ""as good as it gets"". They are good magazines, and they definitely have their advantages. I particularly like how quiet they are. They are also more resistant to dents than USGI aluminum mags. Still, they aren't the ""be-all-end-all"" of AR-15 magazines either. They have been known to crack near or in the feed lips in some cases during normal use. They can also form cracks along the spine near the top. If dropped when fully loaded on the side that isn't retaining the top round, and you're taking a chance at cracking the feed lip. This isn't to say that a USGI metal mag is infallible either, but if you do the same thing to it, you can bend the feed lip back into place good enough to get the weapon firing again. The downside to USGI mags are the noise, and the fact that a decent sized dent on the side of the mag body puts it out of commission permanently. My solution? Run a mix of both and rest assured that you're well equipped."
Glocks,2yutcd,Tarnsman4Life,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:36:26 2015 UTC,"All things considered, pro's and con's, I do believe that Magpul magazines are as good as it gets right now. They have their downsides just like anything else and may not be suitable for all situations but if I were told that I could only choose one brand of magazine to use for the rest of my life, I'd choose Magpul with Lancer a very close second."

Glocks,2yqse6,Baykey123,2,Thu Mar 12 09:08:27 2015 UTC,The shield I got to use was not built well. The slide lock was so stiff that no one in our group could push it down. The trigger was also very gritty. Not impressed. I really hope this will be much better.
Glocks,2yqse6,Moscamst,2,Thu Mar 12 19:45:06 2015 UTC,Was it with or without a safety? My understanding is that the NTS ones tend to have slightly better triggers. both of my Shields (both NTS) have excellent triggers. They're a bit on the heavy side but I can live with them.  The takedown lever is definitely difficult to manipulate initially as the recoil spring is pretty stiff. Once it's broken in it becomes much easier to takedown.
Glocks,2yqse6,heathenyak,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:32:00 2015 UTC,That's normal for a shield they aren't slide releases they're slide stops. Sling shot the slide to unlock it. Also the magazines don't feed for shit unless the slide is moving full speed

Glocks,2yqx1f,wolfgangmob,1 point,Mon Mar 16 05:46:40 2015 UTC,"The only way it can be a big help in training is if the trigger is just like the Glock trigger, same weight and pull length. If it has that along with the same ergonomics it would be useful for training indoor like in a basement, you would also want the same POI in relation to the POA as the real Glock to get the most out of it for training but realistic trigger time is good and if the BB's hit consistently it can help check shooting technique is consistent as well."

Glocks,2yl1rp,Caboose106,10,Wed Mar 11 17:35:07 2015 UTC,"Funny, but this led me to trouble and self-doubt during my first Glock purchase. I picked up a new 36 and a new Taurus 738 then took them to the range. The Taurus was flawless and the Glock jammed up for 2 of every 6 rounds. The rangemaster fired a few shots and said I was probably limp-wristing it. People here said I was limp-wristing it. I train my grip specifically with multiple exercises so I couldn't understand how this was happening, but began to pretty much believe people because it was my first .45ACP. Finally, after weeks, someone came along and informed me that some of the 36s, the ones with loaded chamber indicators, had extractor problems. He made a YouTube video showing me how to replace the parts and told me which ones to buy. It was perfect after that, but I'd encourage people to not jump to that conclusion. It's easy to quickly say to someone ""You're fucking up and/or weak...Glocks are Perfection™"", but it's not necessarily the case. The day the micro Taurus swapped reputations with the Glock is an example."

Glocks,2yl1rp,c3h8pro,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:28:57 2015 UTC,I have the exact same theory with my Keltec PF9 and I assume it's the reason it has gotten such a bad reputation. I have had 4 failures total with it out of over 500 rounds and all of them were when I was doing one handed/weak handed shooting. I let a friend put two mags through it once and it failed about 6 out of 14 times.  It seems much harder to get a limp wrist failure with my G19 but I haven't really ever had that issue with any firearms so I can't tell for sure.
Glocks,2yl1rp,Uncle_Paul_Hargis,1 point,Fri Mar 13 00:20:48 2015 UTC,Small guns like the PF9 should give you more room for limp wristing. They should have taken that into account when designing it. I've had a PF9 fail a few times when it shouldn't have. Never had any issues with my wifes shield.

That was not true of 9mm, which required early mornings at the sporting goods store... if you really wanted it. People bag the .40 and there are some legitimately good arguments for that. That said, not everyone has been saving rainy day ammunition for the past decade and many people would not be able to afford to do so anyway. The ability to shoot two of the most common pistol calibers in the United States with one gun is an advantage that goes unmentioned too often, in my opinion."

I had issues using the barrel 4 times before, but last weekend, after a couple of hours out in the desert shooting various hand guns and rifles, I put up a new target, shot 10 rounds through the Glock barrel at the center of the target, then 10 rounds through the LWD barrel at the head.  My plan was to take a photo to send LWD customer service so they could see what I experienced before.  But this time the groups were basically identical.  So I'm not sure if it was an ammo issue or if I was doing something very wrong after swapping barrels before.  I apologize for criticizing the LWD barrel before testing it more thoroughly.  I will give it several more runs and contact Lone Wolf if there is good evidence that there is anything wrong with the barrel."

The longer slide on the 41 can't be shortened. But I can always add barrel length. That was my mindset. Plus I don't shoot competively and don't really like rdr. However I might have thought longer and harder if I was going to put on an rdr on as soon as I bought it.

Glocks,2yj8yp,SatansLapdog,1 point,Tue Mar 10 12:39:55 2015 UTC,"I would go with trijicon hd night sights.  They still use a three dot system but the rear dot are only composed of the tritium inserts. This makes it easier to focus hard on the front sight, which is large and bright while still being to line the three dots up. Many people prefer the Xs big dot sights because it makes it very easy to get on target in a self defense situation. But I gent that they are lacking in accuracy at longer distances."

Glocks,2yj8yp,volcanonacho,0,Tue Mar 10 19:18:15 2015 UTC,"You really can't go wrong with the standard Trijicon HD ones everybody gets. I used to run the Warren Tactical Sevigny ones on my 19 but went back to the Trijicons because I don't like the wide rear notch on the Warren's. Don't get me wrong, they are great for Man sized targets at close range in a hurry, maybe the best irons for that but trying to hit soda can sized targets at 15 plus yards was a pain with them.   IMO the most accurate iron sights you can buy are ones with a 125 rear notch and a 125 front post width. I kid you not I could consistently hit soda cans at twice the distance I could with the Warren's. The followup shot speed difference is negligible.   I can't say enough good things about Dawson Precision sights and I'm sure this sub would aggree. I run this setup on my 34. I used 018-001 for my rear and 019-017 for the front. If you bought those and were not happy I'd buy them back from you for another one of my glocks."

Glocks,2ychbf,SatansLapdog,10,Sun Mar 8 16:22:25 2015 UTC,"If you focus on the target, neither sight is in focus, so it is difficult to tell when they are properly aligned.  When you focus on the front sight, you can center it in the less-blurry rear sight on the less-blurry target, getting correct sight picture.  If you focus on the rear sight, you're an idiot.  I've been able to get all-rounds-touching groups at ~5-7m when focusing solely on the front sight.  This is when I actually happen to do everything right, however."
Glocks,2ychbf,JakesGunReviews,3,Sun Mar 8 16:28:00 2015 UTC,"When I use both eyes and focus on my front sight, two targets appear due to parallax. Do you just practice to know which is the real one?"
Glocks,2ychbf,343GuiltyShart,3,Sun Mar 8 16:41:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, practice helps.  Try with both eyes open, then close the one eye you would not use to aim.  If it's lined up with your aiming eye, you had it right with both eyes. For example, I'm right handed.  If aiming with one eye, it's the right eye.  So when I was practicing, I'd aim with both, then close my left eye to confirm my aim was good.  When focusing on the front sight, we will see two targets, if you're right handed and right eye dominant, lining the front sight on the right target rather than left should work."
Glocks,2ychbf,Gatorgrad96,2,Sun Mar 8 18:02:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I'll give it a shot. I find that focusing on my target rather than the sight post allows me to keep the entire target unobstructed in my field of view, making tracking much easier for me. Do you feel that this is overshadowed by the loss of sight post sharpness?"
Glocks,2ychbf,343GuiltyShart,3,Sun Mar 8 18:10:14 2015 UTC,"Well, in my opinion, if I were shooting at an attacker instead of a piece of paper, I think I'd be focused on the attacker.  I've also practiced shooting while focusing on the target and my groups are still pretty good - good enough in my opinion to be effective.  I've read that in a real shoot out, combat accuracy is more important than target accuracy.  In other words, getting more rounds on center of mass rapidly is better than taking your time and carefully trying to get a shot within an inch of your aim point.  All that said, I'm not an expert, nor a fire arms instructor.  I'd recommend talking to instructors at your local ranges and reading more online.  Different instructors may have different opinions so consider what you hear or read, practice, and go with what works for you."
Glocks,2ychbf,Gatorgrad96,1 point,Sun Mar 8 18:21:28 2015 UTC,"The only time I aim with both eyes is when the target is so close that I can focus on it instead of the sights and it won't necessarily make a difference on my accuracy.  This would probably be for a distance of a couple meters or so at the furthest.  Beyond that, I would switch to using one eye only.  You can train to use both eyes at a distance, and it's basically what you mentioned:  take time to really focus on which one is the ""real"" sight.    It will be easiest to just be able to switch depending on distance, but being able to use both eyes open or one eye open at any distance will have its advantages, as well, mainly speed since there isn't that fraction of a second where your brain decides what to do with your eyes.  I am not a professional, mind you.  However, I'd venture to guess that most defensive shooting will take place at ""both eyes open"" distances since you generally are close enough that looking at the target and blurring your sights won't matter as much in the grand scheme of things (won't be all-holes-touching, but still within the vitals, for example).  Others here may very well have different opinions, and I would take those into consideration, as well, as there is a chance they have more training than I do.  While I did receive handgun training and have to qualify, they emphasized one eye shooting the entire time while only mentioning that both eyes can be used.  I can't recall us actually having to practice, but I switched to it on the close-up stuff, personally, since I had practiced it pre-training.  For what it's worth, both-eyes-open let me put hits on-target faster, but with slightly less precision.  They were all within the 9-ring at defensive distances, however."
Glocks,2ychbf,JakesGunReviews,-1,Sun Mar 8 20:23:41 2015 UTC,No... Close one eye.
Glocks,2ychbf,Killtrend,3,Sun Mar 8 17:55:04 2015 UTC,This will probably get downvoted but the best advice an instructor has ever given me is to not shoot with both eyes open. You need to learn to shoot with both eyes open for sure and practice it occasionally but you will never be as accurate with both eyes open.
Glocks,2ychbf,volcanonacho,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:43:40 2015 UTC,"I never shoot with both eyes 100% open. Even with shotguns, I can't do it. My left eye is maybe 80% closed as I'm actively aiming down the sights. It gives the clarity of one eye but the sense of awareness of having both eyes open."
Glocks,2ychbf,WhatDoesTheCatsupSay,1 point,Mon Mar 9 14:04:51 2015 UTC,"It can take some people a bit of practice to get used to focusing on the front sight only. What I did was hold the gun normally, then tilt it up slightly so I'm looking down on the top of the slide (basically separating the sights so you see them individually and not in one area). Now focus on the front sight only and slowly level the gun again and line the sights up. It might take a little time until you can immediately focus on just the front, but this method worked for me"

Glocks,2yav0b,slackador,1 point,Sun Mar 8 03:28:36 2015 UTC,The grip angle took a little getting used to. The realizatiin that it is slightly different made me more aware if it. A few range sessions were enough to feel comfortable. My previous carry gun was (and sometimes still is) a Kahr CM9. I love the Kahr for its size but the Glock is much easier/nicer to shoot.
Glocks,2yav0b,ssbn632,1 point,Sun Mar 8 04:10:32 2015 UTC,"With me, it wasn't so much an amount of time or number of rounds, but the direction of my training that did it for me. I wasted away a few thousand rounds as a crappy shot (but good enough for what I needed it for) before I got myself some serious training. Within 600-700 rounds worth of focused training, I was more than proficient with my Glock 20, and that training has transferred to my shooting with most other pistol platforms that I shoot.  In other words, find a good teacher, listen to what he/she says, and do what he/she says and you'll be much better off in the long run."

Glocks,2yav0b,LavenderG0Omz,1 point,Sun Mar 8 18:35:08 2015 UTC,"I shot USPs and other HK weapons before being exposed to glock(17) at age 25. After 200 rounds I was already shooting more precise and faster than with any handgun before.  I knew how to shoot handguns before that, but opposite to popular opinion the Glock grip angle suits me much more, allowing me to roll my hand much more into the gun. Might be just me though, but I also believe that a lot of people turn this into more of a problem than it actually is. If you arent constantly thinking ""with a better grip angle I would have better results"" you wont have any problems with it. Ignore it unless you are physically unable to shoot it.   I also love the low bore axis which translates to a very controlable gun and the idiot proof operation.   Some people complain about the trigger which is something I understand to a degree, but if you have handled the triggers of duty pistols before you quickly get used to it."

Glocks,2y9ahz,bmdaia,2,Mon Mar 9 01:26:35 2015 UTC,"OEM connectors are very safe. In fact, I use a minus connector in most of my Glocks. However they don't actually give you a 3.5 or 4.5 pound pull. It's more like 5.5.   I would never recommend an aftermarket connector in a Glock. They get their feel by short cutting on safety and reliability.

I measured the trigger pull with a digital averaging guage.  It only reduced the trigger pull by about 1 pound, from 5.5 to 4.5 lbs.  I carry it in my IWB kydex holster all the time.  I have it in a OWB kydex holster when i go shooting.  It's no more or less safe than the standard connector."

Glocks,2y7bzz,Echo_one,2,Sat Mar 7 14:02:31 2015 UTC,I tend to agree with you but why wouldn't Glock bring a product to market that so many want unless there is a technical reason?
Glocks,2y7bzz,jalepeno,2,Sat Mar 7 14:37:24 2015 UTC,It was more of a joke. I think they will eventually. Everyone really does want one but Glock just doesn't seem to care. A single stack 9mm would also hurt their new G42 line. Most people won't go for a .380 if they can get the exact same gun in 9mm.
Glocks,2y7bzz,Echo_one,1 point,Sat Mar 7 16:49:49 2015 UTC,sig has the 938/238 and they seem to do well enough. Some people want an ever so much smaller gun and women especially seem to like the .380. Other people think that .380 is too small or don't care if the gun is marginally bigger.
Glocks,2y7bzz,jalepeno,1 point,Sat Mar 7 17:05:09 2015 UTC,"You're right about the 380. If it were a little smaller, it could compete with the LCP. If Glock were to release a SS 9mm, it would be similar in size to the 42, so there would be no real reason to buy the 42."

Glocks,2y5fhz,8bit9mm,2,Fri Mar 6 20:24:15 2015 UTC,Why would there be milling required?
Glocks,2y5fhz,gripplechew,1 point,Fri Mar 6 20:52:57 2015 UTC,"Ported barrels need a place for the gas to escape. A g34 has a hole in the top of the slide already (for weight reduction I believe) which could be used in conjunction with a ported barrel without you having to send the slide off to get milled for porting holes.   Thus, by mathematical induction, no milling required."

Glocks,2y7k5s,OfficerJoseph,1 point,Sat Mar 7 04:00:04 2015 UTC,"Don't think so. The frame sizes are different, as are the slide lengths."
Glocks,2y7k5s,capteurdereves,1 point,Sat Mar 7 05:11:32 2015 UTC,"IIRC: The frames are not the same.  The point of the .45GAP cartridGe was to use the same frame as the 9mm/.40S&W/.357SIG.   The .45ACP frames are bigger in width so the G39 slide won't fit on it.   There may be a way to get a G39 barrel set up for the G30 frame, though, since only the chamber dimensions would be different.  The G30 mags may work also, but with the shorter OAL of the .45GAP you might have trouble with feeding. For some unique plinking, I wouldn't worry about reliability.     Go for it and report back!  Edit to add:  you're also working with the Subcompact .45GAP and the Compact .45ACP.  So if you found a way to do a barrel swap it would have to be a slightly longer barrel.  The G38 barrel may work for the length."

Bring the gun up to eye level - usually by punching out and forward.    I shoot a piece of paper, fold it in half lengthwise, fold it again lengthwise.  When you're cutting it half with your shots fold it so its 1/4 the width.  When the front sight meets white paper front sight focus and smooth trigger pull.  Also figure out reset for target shooting.    When you're shooting for an 'X' vs just hitting the white it's a different idea of how you find your target."

I bought Trijicon GL-01s for my G26 and front sight height is .203 and rear are .256 so the ones you're looking at still aren't going to be high enough.
Glocks,2y66ek,tuccified,1 point,Fri Mar 6 22:27:24 2015 UTC,Something about an RMR on a G26 sounds sexy. Pics?
Glocks,2y66ek,Aerial_Screw,1 point,Tue Mar 10 01:58:46 2015 UTC,It would be!!  I actually meant that I put the night sights on.  I haven't put an RMR on.  Sorry for the confusion lol

Glocks,2y66ek,tuccified,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:09:55 2015 UTC,I was thinking a .215 since its in the middle of the road?
Glocks,2y66ek,rainy0days,1 point,Fri Mar 6 20:28:20 2015 UTC,"The link isn't working for me, but I'll assume the sights use the same standard measurements that most other companies use. If the rear sight is a .250 like everyone else, then you want a .215 to hit POI/POA with a G19.   However if you want to get an RMR, you're going to need suppressor sights for when that happens."

Glocks,2y37rr,James_Johnson,2,Fri Mar 6 04:13:48 2015 UTC,"Forgive me, but what exactly is ball and dummy?"
Glocks,2y37rr,bearishparrot,5,Fri Mar 6 07:57:06 2015 UTC,"I'm amazed anyone else but me a few other redditors read this site. Great site. Lots of knowledgable folks.  Via pistol-training.com   Ball & Dummy Drill Range: 3yd Target: small (3×5 card, 3″ dot) Start position: any Rounds fired: varies  This drill has been used for decades to help shooters overcome problems anticipating recoil and jerking the trigger. It’s a staple of every instructor’s diagnostic toolbox.  You will need some snap caps or dummy rounds to do this drill. Have a shooting partner load your pistol magazine or revolver cylinder with about two-thirds live ammunition and one-third dummies, randomly mixed. (alternatively, revolver shooters can just leave 1-3 chambers empty)  Using a small but close target as outlined above, aim and shoot. You should have no idea whether you’re pulling the trigger on a live round or a dummy, so treat every trigger press as if it were going to fire. When you get to a dummy round, the pistol should stay perfectly still as you press the trigger. If you jerk the trigger or anticipate recoil, you’ll immediately see it because the gun will move off target.  If you do jerk the gun on a dummy, stop and fire ten perfect, deliberate dry-fire shots without jerking the trigger or anticipating any recoil. Then do the Ball & Dummy Drill again.  This drill is only valid when you are shooting slowly and deliberately, working 100% on accuracy and zero on speed. As you start to shoot faster, it’s easy to mistake proper recoil management for “anticipation” and make you believe you are doing something wrong when you’re not.   In addition to this drill, you can practice dry-firing @home with empty brass or a coin on top of your slide/front sight about 5 minutes a day without brass/coin falling/moving to get rid of recoil-sensitive habits."

There is, however, a variant of the concept, where the gun is only loaded with a single round at a time, and handed back to the loader between shots.

Glocks,2y37rr,James_Johnson,1 point,Fri Mar 6 21:35:26 2015 UTC,"That would be why, yes. A type one is failure to fire, which includes failure to feed.

Glocks,2y2vii,capteurdereves,3,Fri Mar 6 00:25:40 2015 UTC,Are you refering to the cut out for the reversible mag release or the ambi mag release cut out they are two different things. The cut out in the center was a result of Glock trying to get a military contract that wanted an ambi mag release which failed and since they never released a true ambi mag release they got rid of the cut out on the newest mags. The cut out on the side is for the reversible mag release on Gen 4 models that they have now covered up with plastic.

Glocks,2xxsn7,kshlep3,3,Wed Mar 4 20:16:03 2015 UTC,"I'm in Arizona too, once I found the Aegis holster I've never used my Galco again. The Galco likes to slide down because its so slick on the back.

EDIT: It covers basically the whole guard."
Glocks,2xxsn7,bmdaia,2,Wed Mar 4 20:20:47 2015 UTC,"The slipping problem is the one thing I really dislike about the Galco. I put some grip tape on the Galco for my S&W M&P 9c, but that destroyed the inside of my pants. I bought the belt loops for the Galco for my glock and they stopped it from slipping around, but they weren't worth the extra $10 because they make the holster print. I'm disappointed with the AG too because there's no retention built into the holster. It only retains the gun because your belt squeezes everything together. It looks like the kydex part on the Aegis actually has a form of retention.   How is the leather in AZ? Does it need any special care to keep it from getting nasty with sweat?"
Glocks,2xxsn7,Moscamst,3,Wed Mar 4 20:29:54 2015 UTC,"I like it a lot because its thin, soft, and one piece. The retention might bother you because it is a bit loose. Aegis has a video on youtube somewhere where they claim they designed it to be a little loser because it will tighten up as the leather forms to it from the other side. If I tip it upside down, my gun will probably slide out with a simple jiggle. That being said, it is still the best holster I've ever owned because it is simply the most comfortable to wear. I went through about 4 holsters until i came upon the Aegis one. I've stopped looking for new holsters."

You could try contacting Glock directly and tell them its brand new blah blah and maybe they'll hook you up.  3: Just deal with it.

Glocks,2xxdke,screwthis0125,1 point,Wed Mar 4 20:23:23 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of guys handling the pistol in the display case are wearing rings. Rings are almost always made of softer material than the slide finish. A gold ring is chalk to the chalkboard of Glock's finish.

Glocks,2xxdke,nimoythedestroyer,1 point,Wed Mar 4 20:18:47 2015 UTC,not a problem. The Gen 4 Glocks do not have the same durable tennifer (spelling) that the previous generations did. Even some newer Gen 3's are getting this newer less durable coating

Glocks,2xxdke,nimoythedestroyer,2,Wed Mar 4 18:30:46 2015 UTC,"Tennifer is a hardening treatment and it leaves the color of the metal unchanged. The Glocks that had the Tennifer treatment have a baked on epoxy paint, which is what you're referring to. The new treatment is just as durable, the only difference is the plasma assisted ferritic nitrocarburizing process darkens the metal. There is no finish on the new ones, which is why they scuff (but don't scratch) easier. Think chalkboard.   Edit: Tennifer is salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing"

If I had to wager a guess, I'd say you scratched it somewhere else and didn't notice it until later when you pulled it out of the holster and attributed the damage to the holster since that's the first time you noticed it. Is there a corresponding scratch on the gen 3 that didn't make it to the metal?"

I had an Aliengear 2.0, and, unsurprisingly, it feels much nicer than the aliengear.  The fuzz stuff is kind of a gimmick, but it does feel pretty nice.  Gives it a solid feel, rather than being a glorified plastic clamshell.

Glocks,2xvb4r,JakesGunReviews,2,Wed Mar 4 05:01:51 2015 UTC,"It depends on how well you want to take care of your gun.  If you don't give a shit and see your firearm as a simple toy, then by all means feel free to listen to to most of the people in this thread and never clean it ever.  If you're serious about reliability and taking care of your possessions, especially the ones that take care of you, then you should clean and lube the gun before you fire it for the first time, and then after each range session.  Just because you have 5,000 rounds through your glock without cleaning it doesn't make it good for the glock.  If you're going to carry a tool that you need to be able to depend on with your life, you want it to be better than 'good enough.'  Anything less is really just laziness and carelessness."

Glocks,2xui50,Strickland_FJ,2,Tue Mar 3 23:51:20 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference is going to be polygonal v. land and groove rifling. Land and groove rifling can be better for shooting softer lead bullets which can cause lead fouling faster than you would get copper fouling from jacketed bullets, this depends greatly on lead hardness and gas checks can help substantially.   Other than that you can have an aftermarket barrel fitted to your gun which aids in accuracy, not really enough to affect combat shooting but in competition it might be the difference between 1st and 2nd place. Aftermarket barrels can also affect accuracy since they could be made with greater precision than a factory barrel which gets reflected in the cost."
Glocks,2xui50,wolfgangmob,1 point,Wed Mar 4 00:01:20 2015 UTC,So...which type of barrel uses what kind of rifling?
Glocks,2xui50,G19Gen3,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:00:46 2015 UTC,Factory Glock barrels are polygonal with few exceptions while US made customs are going to be land and groove as far as Glock barrels.
Glocks,2xui50,wolfgangmob,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:38:11 2015 UTC,What I came here to say. I have a 17 and 19 both 4th gen and bought KKM barrels for both because I cast and reload my own bullets. I love them.
Glocks,2xui50,Kockstain,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:59:46 2015 UTC,So the stock barrels are better for JHPs.
Glocks,2xui50,G19Gen3,1 point,Wed Mar 4 05:21:24 2015 UTC,"No, JHP are better in stock barrels. Aftermarket barrels that require fitting will most likely be better with a JHP bullet and be able to shoot lead a little better in terms of fouling."

Glocks,2xpn05,southernbenz,0,Wed Mar 4 20:21:11 2015 UTC,"lol  Okay, what I mean to say is, for what you give up by not using 9mm to use .380, do you really gain that much in the ability to conceal it?   There is no reason you couldn't have a glock 42 sized gun in 9mm if glock would simply make it, there is no technical constraint to it. Look at an LC9s Pro, for instance. I'd rather have the 9mm when the gun is virtually the same size as the LCP.   .380 is only a bit shorter. You get the same capacity, similar grip sizes... etc.. sure it's a softer shooter, but that's it.   I'd want a glock 42 just to have something to shoot 380, but honestly I think most people looking at 42 to carry, would be better served by an LC9s pro if what they want is a single stack, sub compact carry pistol. I wish I didn't have to say that because I really would love to have a glock that fits that description, but they don't. If and when it exists it's going to be made in the USA instead of Austria too... :P"

Glocks,2xpn05,G19Gen3,1 point,Mon Mar 2 21:50:30 2015 UTC,"There is no color applied, what you're seeing is the result of the surface etching engraving. There is also an option of deep engraving, which will produce a white color like this: http://i.imgur.com/cXevczP.jpg"

Glocks,2xpn05,hoosiewhatsit,1 point,Tue Mar 3 05:04:59 2015 UTC,I'm glad you brought that up. The surface etching does not affect the corrosion resistant properties of the plasma assisted nitrocarburizing hardening process (Tenifer isn't used anymore as cyanide is a byproduct of that hardening treatment). It's still just as rough and tumble as any other Glock!
Glocks,2xpn05,joshq68,1 point,Tue Mar 3 12:54:44 2015 UTC,So does that process permeate through all of the metal or is there a depth to be aware of?
Glocks,2xpn05,Dsch1ngh1s_Khan,1 point,Tue Mar 3 15:32:08 2015 UTC,"The depth can be set the the customers desire. The surface etching doesn't cut in by any measurable amount, it just changes the surface color, leaving the hardening treatment and finish (if there is one) intact. The laser can cut down to a depth of .0625"", or 1/16"", well past the .003"" required by the ATF for serializing, but the deep engraving will remove the finish, so a refinish is recommended.

Glocks,2xpn05,guywithfro1,6,Tue Mar 3 00:19:37 2015 UTC,"I never said logic played into it. You and I both know that a weapon's appearance has no bearing on its performance or potential lethality. It's just a bit of advice I've always been told.   If I was to speculate, I suppose the rationale is that practically anyone involved in a court case has some some kind of bias or alterior objective. As we know, lawyers put spins on everything for the sake of winning the case; thus having a cosmetically plain-jane weapon gives them one less thing to leverage against you. Perhaps customized weapons are presented by prosecutors as evidence that the defendant is a ""gun nut"" or something. I've never heard an explicit rationale for this little piece of conventional wisdom, but I'd be willing to bet its something along these lines.  In addition, maybe I'm reading this wrong, but your quote ""Good on you OP, be safe and I hope you never have to use it too, but for a different reason."" seems to imply that I'm more concerned with legal strategem than the value of human life, which is in not at all true."

Glocks,2xqn9y,Thechubbyprotestant,2,Tue Mar 3 05:08:52 2015 UTC,They really did. Honestly the 42 is the smallest gun I'll ever own. Anything else to me is just too small to manage recoil effectively.
Glocks,2xqn9y,Thechubbyprotestant,2,Tue Mar 3 16:29:24 2015 UTC,"Probably significantly more than a 17, but not too much more than a 19. My 26 would probably be comparable recoil wise, but I only notice that much of a difference because the trigger on my 26 is insanely good and the trigger on the 42 was factory fresh. Still less than most .40 caliber and much more comfortable. Only complaint was its super tiny. I wear extra large gloves and it was a tad small for my taste."

I wouldn't describe it as ""toy-like"" tiny, but if you have average-large hands, an LCP is not a comfortable gun to shoot. My dad swears by his, because it's small enough for him to carry every day, but I carry a G29 and have no issues with the size, so I don't have to compromise nearly as much.

Shoot it with the bottom of your grip planted on your hip or holster. Shoot two shots 5 times. You should easily hit that paper 90%. As the distance increases its understandable to drop a few but out to 7 yards you should still be able to hit the paper frequently.

Glocks,2xkwor,renosfinest,22,Sun Mar 1 18:50:48 2015 UTC,"As someone who concealed carries a Glock 19 every day, I can say it's absolutely unnecessary.  The length of the barrel doesn't really effect how comfortable a gun is.  What makes a gun more concealable is mostly the length of the grip and how it prints through a shirt.  This is why you see people taking G17's and cutting the grip down to the size of a G19.  You get a shorter grip while retaining a longer barrel and sight radius.  The appeal of the G26 is how short the grip is and how easily it melts into the waistline.  So adding a longer grip to a gun with shorter barrel and sight radius is pretty dumb in my opinion.  Also, making any fighting pistol's grip as smooth as possible is flat out fucking retarded.  I'd much rather buy 3 or 4 stock Gen 3 Glocks for that price.  And one last thing.  Finger grooves don't make you an accurate shooter, Lenny.  Time spent behind the sights and trigger does."

Glocks,2xi8y7,Redd-9,2,Sun Mar 1 00:46:13 2015 UTC,"Unless the Gen 3 grip really doesn't fit your hand and you would greatly benefit from the changeable back strap, a Gen 3 is every bit as good as a Gen 4, Should be at least $50 cheaper new vs new. A used Gen3 should be at least $100 less than a new Gen4 for the same gun. My Glock 19 Gen 2 has had nearly 10,000 rounds put through it and still shoots like new and looks like new still. Original barrel still. A new gun is used after that first magazine. Quick search on GunWatcher.com shows new Gen3's for &499 with free shipping, so $25 for the NICS/FFL fee and you've got a new one for $525, so a used one should be no more than $425-450. Look at the gun inside and out, no obvious scratches, no scuffs on the grip, Function tests good, barrel not bulged from a squib. Striker moves freely while pressing in on the firing pin safety. Extractor tip not broken off."
Glocks,2xi8y7,SteveWagner197,1 point,Sun Mar 1 02:18:40 2015 UTC,"I have bigger hands, only shot the 4th gen 17, but this 3rd gen is too good of an offer, as long as it fits the same.  I'm just worried that maybe it's been completely rebuilt after lots of rounds and not new like he's saying?  What really makes the 19 better?"
Glocks,2xi8y7,Redd-9,0,Sun Mar 1 02:06:22 2015 UTC,"I also have gorilla hands. It comes with the beaver tail and fatter grip addons. Makes it easier to comfortably adjust to your hands out of the box. Plus extra mag. Unless you prefer the slightly OAL of the 17, get a 19. But that's just like my opinion man.  Edit: if the price is right, go for the deal you got. I wouldn't go higher than $500. $550 with both the mags."
Glocks,2xi8vg,BlackGhostPanda,1 point,Sat Feb 28 23:06:24 2015 UTC,I've shot 9mm conversion Storm Lake and a threaded Lone Wolf.  Both worked really well.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy either.   I wouldn't hesitate to buy from Palmetto either.
Glocks,2xi8vg,tuccified,1 point,Sun Mar 1 00:48:11 2015 UTC,I've been using a lone wolf barrel on my g17 for awhile now.  I use it with a Osprey 45 as well as a TiRant 9 and have had zero problems.  If you decide to go with a lone wolf barrel get it blackened or blind marked. Their logo is awful.  I'm very happy with my barrel but I would definitely consider a PSA barrel if I needed another.
Glocks,2xi8vg,wckdwabbit,1 point,Sun Mar 1 01:52:48 2015 UTC,"I don't have any knowledge of the PSA barrel, but I know both the LWD and SL barrels are good barrels with better chamber support than factory barrels.  I've read more positive reviews for the SL than the LWD, but not enough that it makes it clearly the better choice than the LWD.  I wasn't so worried about the price difference, so I went with the SL barrel on my 17.  I also preferred it because I didn't have to find (and possibly pay extra for) a blind marked barrel.  SL logo is on the side, and much more subtle.  A thread protector is also included with it."
Glocks,2xi8vg,BZJGTO,1 point,Sun Mar 1 11:24:48 2015 UTC,"i've been old the PSA barrels are rebranded Lone Wolf, but have not confirmed it. I'd go with one of those in 1/2-28, i believe Glock brand threaded barrels are a metric thread which is less common and will likely be more expensive if you get a can"
Glocks,2xi8vg,mrjohnsmithe,1 point,Tue Mar 3 02:33:47 2015 UTC,"I bought an Octane 45 a few days ago and have already started research for a threaded g19 barrel. Another option to throw into the mix is SilencerCo. They're pretty proud, though."

Glocks,2xi8vg,stanleyfarnsworth,5,Sat Feb 28 23:44:08 2015 UTC,I too am interested in hearing more detail.
Glocks,2xi8vg,FlieGerFaUstMe262,3,Sat Feb 28 23:55:34 2015 UTC,Glock does make threaded barrels you can buy at double the price of palmetto and about 80 more than lonewolf
Glocks,2xi8vg,FlieGerFaUstMe262,1 point,Sat Feb 28 23:56:30 2015 UTC,"Yes. I misread the last sentence as you asking for someone to shed light on something better. They are double the price, that is correct."
Glocks,2xi8vg,AHappyMeal,1 point,Sun Mar 1 00:29:49 2015 UTC,Ah ok. Do you have experience with all three barrels to say that the glock barrel would be the way to go
Glocks,2xi8vg,FlieGerFaUstMe262,0,Sun Mar 1 00:30:58 2015 UTC,"No, I misread, or I would not have commented. With a Glock barrel you will have the treading LH, so if you like RH it is not for you. Though I'd recommend sending in a Glock 17 factory barrel to get threaded RH, if it were possible."
Glocks,2xi21w,steveox152,6,Sat Feb 28 22:06:51 2015 UTC,"Gen4 has:   larger magazine release mag release is now reversible different grip texture comes with swappable backstraps to fit larger or smaller hands and/or to add a beavertail to the grip a dual recoil spring that's supposed to lessen felt recoil slightly ships with 3 magazines instead of 2   If any of those matter to you then go with Gen4. If not, Gen3 is probably fine and likely cheaper, though remember to factor in the cost of the extra magazine."
Glocks,2xi21w,slalomz,3,Sat Feb 28 22:34:11 2015 UTC,"I found that I didn't like the feel of the gen 4 grip or the bigger mag release.

I bought a gen4 34 last summer, and while I like it I'm still getting used to the grip.  I do like how the gen4 without any of the backstraps is essentially the same grip length as the SF frame.  I don't like the grip texture as much as the gen3."
Glocks,2xi21w,HutchOne23,1 point,Sun Mar 1 06:29:30 2015 UTC,The Gen4 from what I recall is also a tiny bit thinner than the Gen3.

Glocks,2xi21w,OtherPaleBlueDot,-6,Sun Mar 1 02:26:10 2015 UTC,"The Gen 4 can have issues compared to earlier model Glocks. The grip is also uncomfortable as some people have said here. It cannot last 1000 rounds of repeated fire but the Gen 3 can, which was proven in a test video. For these reasons, I bought a Gen 3 G19 because it's tried and true."
Glocks,2xipo0,DownwardSpirals,1 point,Sun Mar 1 01:44:06 2015 UTC,"A guide rod itself won't do much, but a lighter recoil spring will. Especially if you're shooting low power loads.   If it's a gen 3, I'd highly recommend the JP mag release or another extended paddle release of some kind.   You've pretty much hit the rest of the major modifications though. The rest will pretty much be your preference."
Glocks,2xipo0,rainy0days,1 point,Sun Mar 1 04:51:04 2015 UTC,"Mag release...  I knew I was missing something.  Thanks!  I called up Wolff, and was told by their tech that the recoil spring rate wouldn't do too much from factory if I'm trying to make major.  Most 180 gr .40 is loaded pretty close to the major category limit, so reducing it down to the bare minimum wouldn't require a change in the spring rate...  Now when I convert it to 9mm outside of USPSA, that's a different story since there's not much regulation on what I can shoot so long as it makes a hole or knocks down the plate."
Glocks,2xipo0,LilFuniAZNBoi,1 point,Sun Mar 1 23:32:41 2015 UTC,Competition springs will further reduce trigger pull weight and an aftermarket trigger (or the 25cent job) will reduce travel.
Glocks,2xipo0,NickBlasta,1 point,Sun Mar 1 17:18:24 2015 UTC,I'd definitely recommend a larger magazine release. Maybe some grip tape for a positive hold?  My G35 works with .40 and 9mm without a recoil spring/trigger assembly swap so it makes switching between major and minor really easy.

Glocks,2xfnmd,Moscamst,5,Sun Mar 1 06:46:34 2015 UTC,"The Glock .357Sig barrel and magazines will work just as well as a factory set up. The only difference between the G23 and G32 are the barrel, magazines, and markings. You can swap just the barrel (.40 -> 9 aftermarket) and magazines and you'll be able to fire 9x19. It should be fairly reliable but might not be perfect. If you want near-factory reliability with 9x19 then you would need to switch out the ejector and extractor (not that difficult, tons of videos on YouTube for how to do it)."

Plus I like the accessories Gen 4 comes with.  I was worried after buying mine too, but not anymore.  It'd take a lot to part with her now.  I did do the ""$.25 trigger job and it actually did wonders.

Glocks,2xczbf,Prospiciens,6,Fri Feb 27 15:45:00 2015 UTC,"it's a great gun, much less recoil than you would expect because the whole platform is so heavy. gotta turn to the internet or the reloading bench for proper ammo. accurate on bowling pins at 75 paces with stock barrel and sights, but heavier recoil spring and different rod. and while throwing 180gr at 1320fps is pretty devastating, sometimes you want to shoot something else, so why not get a G21 complete upper(not a separate gun) and some mags for less than $400. its pretty easy to have one G20 lower than can see 6 different types of ammo go through it's mag well just with different barrels.  10mm, .40, .357 sig, 9x25dillon, .45, .40 super   ------------edit why is this getting downvoted??"

Glocks,2xczbf,Manfred1816,1 point,Fri Feb 27 16:05:56 2015 UTC,"Haven't shot any other 10mm platforms, but I absolutely love my G20. The 10mm cartridge is a great highly accurate and hard hitting round that has a wide variety of uses. Currently I use my G20 for home defense and protection from large game when out hiking or hunting in Alaska. I've put about 600 rounds through my all-stock G20 so far and, after perfecting my feel for the platform, am generally able to keep my shots within a 2"" spacing at 30 yards. The stock G20 platform is great, but I'm thinking about changing out the sights and possibly the barrel simply due to its inability to healthily shoot unjacketed lead rounds. I've also had zero FTFs, FTEs, or keyholes with my G20, even when shooting crappy range ammo, and I clean it after every use."

Glocks,2xczbf,G19Gen3,2,Fri Feb 27 17:00:31 2015 UTC,"Open and concealed carry is totally legal and accepted up here.  It's great. The only thing I'll stress is alcohol.  It's probably the least liberal aspect of the state. If you've had even a sip of a beer, do not carry / shoot.  Even if you're well under the legal limit, you can get your firearm taken and possibly be arrested while carrying / shooting with alcohol in your system.    Welcome to Alaska in advance.  I hope you like it here!"
Glocks,2xczbf,chrispy_cream,2,Tue Mar 10 09:17:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the welcome, I'll most likely be settling in Wasilla, just trying to find a nice home with some land to it.   As for alcohol, I rarely, if ever drink anymore. I'm still young but the wild years are far behind me. I'm glad carrying is so accepted up there.  As for the G20, I ended up picking up the new G41 because I wanted to stay with the .45ACP series."
Glocks,2xczbf,LittleHelperRobot,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:24:53 2015 UTC,"That's awesome.  Wasilla is a great place to buy.  I'm just below you in Anchorage.  My wife and I will probably move to Wasilla or Palmer when we are ready to buy.  I'm in the same boat as you with drinking.  Hate to say it, but be prepared to have a tough time making friends with people that don't like to go out and get smashed.  Alaska is very tough with their alcohol laws.  They are, however, that way because so many people like to drink heavily.  When you get here, look up the Maud Road range.  It is a free range put together by the NRA.  It's by far the best in the area in my opinion."
Glocks,2xczbf,greekplaya990,1 point,Wed Mar 11 01:15:39 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, you don't need a license to concealed carry in Alaska and open carry is also legal in the state. this link has some good info on the gun laws in Alaska. It's not unusual to see someone carrying while out hiking, you never know if there is an angry bear or moose around the next corner, or in your front yard for that matter.   Feel free to pm me if you've got any more questions, Alaska is an amazing state, always glad to hear about more people moving here!"
Glocks,2xczbf,CNCTEMA,1 point,Fri Feb 27 17:13:07 2015 UTC,For defense against a bear or moose won't a 10mm just piss it off? Seems like you'd want to carry at least a .44.
Glocks,2xczbf,ikidd,2,Sun Mar 1 04:48:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's more about shot placement and ammo selection, if you can't hit the bear where you need to anything short of an rpg is just going to piss it off. my dad carries a single action .44 mag for bear defense in Alaska which is all fine and good until you realize you'd only be able to get 2 maybe 3 accurate shots off at a charging bear. With 16 rounds of 10mm in a G20 I'd feel much safer knowing I can accurately land 7-10 rounds of this on a bear's skull and still have some left over. Also, the Danish Sirius patrol carries G20s for defense against polar Bears. All this being said, it's ultimately a matter of opinion and, although I've never had to face down a charging bear before, I feel comfortable with my G20."

Glocks,2xczbf,bmdaia,1 point,Fri Feb 27 18:18:08 2015 UTC,my G20 shooting underwood out of a 6.6 inch barrel has the same or less recoil than hornaday .40 out of a G22.  now shooting .40 out of the G20 is where it's real nice and soft. it's like shooting an M9 9mm or 9mm 1911
Glocks,2xczbf,XxBurntOrangexX,0,Sat Feb 28 14:07:00 2015 UTC,"That's generally the issue I see with factory 10mm.  This is a cartridge that begs to be reloaded to A: get the actual power they're rated for, and B: save a ton of money.  I've paid back the price of my Dillon in 10mm alone in a couple years."
Glocks,2xczbf,igrulks,1 point,Fri Feb 27 18:33:12 2015 UTC,"There's some good factory loads, and some that are cheaper than the crappy watered down stuff. But yes, for truly atomic loads on the cheap, reloading is the only way to go. Underwood has some atomic stuff for ~80c/rd. I can load atomic stuff, with new starline brass, for a little over half that."
Glocks,2xczbf,capteurdereves,0,Fri Feb 27 19:01:36 2015 UTC,"There's some good factory loads   Perhaps, I've never seen them up in the snowy north yet, and it would be easier to sell arms to the Contras than import ammo out of the US.  All I see are AE at 1050fps or some such shit.  For a buck a cartridge."
Glocks,2xczbf,G19Gen3,1 point,Fri Feb 27 19:10:48 2015 UTC,"Ah.  Can you not get Underwood to ship to Canada?  That's probably your problem.  It's less ""factory load"" and more ""boutique load""  i know what you're saying, though.  when i picked up my 20, i bought a box of federal HSTs to load it with.  Here they were 155gr doing like 1100fps.  what a rip. and that was like $1.20/round"
Glocks,2xczbf,capteurdereves,0,Fri Feb 27 20:08:07 2015 UTC,"They'll ship fine, but you have to get an ITAR release from the US ATF because it's firearm related and outside the very narrow allowed items like magazine buttplates, etc.  It's not a problem shipping into Canada, we don't have any restrictions except legal items and customs, but there's more restriction placed on ammunition and components leaving the US than you would believe.  I ordered some 10mm Starline brass from a guy in Cali because I couldn't find any in Canada. The certificate they wanted from Industry Canada for the import took an hour to be processed and faxed to them, then I waited for 2 weeks for ATF to approve the permit.  I was kinda serious when I said it would be easier to sell arms to the Contras.  Less red tape."
Glocks,2xczbf,G19Gen3,0,Fri Feb 27 20:28:52 2015 UTC,This is subjective but the more massive slide of Glock's 10mm platform absorbs the difference in energy between 40 and 10.
Glocks,2xczbf,igrulks,1 point,Fri Feb 27 21:18:59 2015 UTC,"I've shot 40 out of my G20.  I've shot weak-ass watered down 10mm out of my G20.  I've shot full-house, ass-kicking 10mm out of my G20.  There is ABSOLUTELY an OBJECTIVE difference in recoil.  AS a matter of fact im sure you could use one of those online recoul calculators and show, quite objectively, that there is quite the difference."
Glocks,2xczbf,capteurdereves,1 point,Fri Feb 27 23:10:39 2015 UTC,Yeah tons more recoil in the same gun.  The point is 10 out of a 20 is similar to 40 out of a 22.
Glocks,2xczbf,bmx13,1 point,Sat Feb 28 15:51:36 2015 UTC,"Pros 10mm, Glock aftermarket support, shoot like 8 different calibers with one gun Cons an aftermarket barrel is necessary pretty much right off the bat, stock trigger blows, stock sights blow and aren't adjustable."
Glocks,2xczbf,bmdaia,1 point,Fri Feb 27 18:07:14 2015 UTC,Well one pro compared to most other 10mm's would be the price. You're in the $600ish ballpark for a G20 and most 1911s in 10mm will be $1000+. And its not like the glock is any less reliable.

Glocks,2xevoi,thenatureboy_,2,Sat Feb 28 01:47:08 2015 UTC,I use this without the belt loop in conjunction with the Clipdraw.
Glocks,2xevoi,Aerial_Screw,1 point,Sat Feb 28 03:24:21 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate a little more on the clip draw? I am intrigued.
Glocks,2xevoi,thenatureboy_,2,Sat Feb 28 16:46:04 2015 UTC,"Sure! I appendix carry a G27 with a Clipdraw and the VG2. I don't use the loop on the VG2 because the Clipdraw seems more sturdy to me.   Clipdraw recommends carrying without a round chambered when using the product, as there is nothing protecting the trigger. So I use the VG2 with the cord around my belt to cover the trigger so I'm always locked and cocked.   Using the Clipdraw instead of the loop also makes reholstering a breeze because when I draw, the VG2 comes out and is left hanging by the cord on my belt. So all I have to do is snap it back on the trigger guard and tuck the pistol back in my waistband.   This combination is wonderful for the summertime when reducing carry bulk and outlines is a must. And even if you're not wearing a belt, you can use the cordage like in OP's pic to pull the VG2 off with your support hand. This makes it a viable option for pocket carry also when you don't feel like clipping it on.   Long story short, I feel like the Clipdraw and the Vanguard 2 were made for each other. Just bear in mind that this is about as minimalist as carrying can safely get with one in the pipe.   Hope my ramblings are decipherable."
Glocks,2xevoi,Aerial_Screw,2,Sat Feb 28 17:11:01 2015 UTC,"I've got a clipdraw on its way. I use a mic holster adjusted just right, so the gun stays in place but slowly pitches forward. Clip draw will stop that, effectively giving me the stability of a two clip IWB holster with an insanely low profile."
Glocks,2xevoi,G19Gen3,1 point,Sun Mar 1 05:01:32 2015 UTC,"Your ramblings are quite decipherable! I have a VGII already, so I guess I was more curious about the clip draw part. If I understood what you were saying correctly, the clip draw is just using the para cord around your belt as the VGI works? I thought you were implying there was a clip that I can attach to my VGII instead of using the loop, like the clips on most other holsters.   I hope you can understand my ramblings. Long story short, I know the two ways that the VGII can work, my question is there a third (using a different style clip instead of the loop)?"
Glocks,2xevoi,thenatureboy_,2,Sat Feb 28 17:27:59 2015 UTC,Oh you were literally asking what the Clipdraw is lol. Imagine a steel clip that mounts to the backplate of the slide and runs down the side to the front edge of the ejection port.  Here's a picture from Amazon
Glocks,2xevoi,Aerial_Screw,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:50:59 2015 UTC,"Whoa, yeah, was not imagining that, haha. I personally like the VGII as it comes. You don't?"
Glocks,2xevoi,thenatureboy_,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:26:25 2015 UTC,"I tried it with just the belt loop for a while, but I had a hard time keeping the pistol completely vertical. With the Clipdraw I don't have that problem, and I don't have to wear a belt to keep it secure in my waistband. I carry it in basketball shorts all the time and never even notice it's there lol"
Glocks,2xevoi,Aerial_Screw,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:42:24 2015 UTC,"True! Whatever works for you, mine only moves as much as I need it too for appendix carry. Give it another go with the loop, knowing that someone else doesn't have that problem. Might help, because I really love the thing."
Glocks,2xevoi,thenatureboy_,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:48:19 2015 UTC,"I think another reason I stick with the Clipdraw is in order to safely and properly reholster with the VG2, you have to completely remove the holster and then reattach it. When I use the cord, it eliminates that extra step."
Glocks,2xevoi,Aerial_Screw,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:55:20 2015 UTC,"I hear you on that completely! Not much need to reholster too often though. I suffer for the other perks. This was a nice conversation, do you have another Glopic (Glock + topic) to discuss?   I'll see myself out now..."

Being 2 minutes from the border of a magazine capacity ban state his supplier had TONS of G19's with 10 rounders that no one wanted, the one I got was the last standard capacity they had."

Glocks,2xbabe,bmdaia,2,Fri Feb 27 14:27:32 2015 UTC,The difference between the 30 and the 30S is night-and-day.  Have you held one?  I might suggest that.  :)
Glocks,2xbabe,southernbenz,2,Fri Feb 27 04:34:31 2015 UTC,HK VP9  Best Glock you will ever own.
Glocks,2xbabe,Doxiedad,3,Fri Feb 27 03:40:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, HK's are heavier and bigger; much better for use as a blunt instrument against the enemy.  And the lengthy, stacking LEM trigger provides additional physical training for the index finger."

Glocks,2xbabe,LavenderG0Omz,3,Fri Feb 27 16:44:58 2015 UTC,Weird. My 23 eats anything and everything.
Glocks,2xbabe,DrVonDeafingson,3,Fri Feb 27 21:23:05 2015 UTC,Yea my 23 works fine I love it. I've put at least 2000 rounds through it. Never a problem just use good quality ammo
Glocks,2xbabe,C-LOgreen,2,Fri Feb 27 23:14:22 2015 UTC,"Out of all of my Glocks, I love my 23 the most. I think its what works for you and what you like. All about personal preference."
Glocks,2xbf1r,insidethebox,1 point,Fri Feb 27 04:10:10 2015 UTC,"I have the Pyramid Trigger ultimate kit (black and red) installed in my Glock 34 Gen 4 for competition. Works great, along with the ZEV competition springs, the skeletonized striker, and the disconnect that came with the package; my trigger pull weight is down to around 3lbs with it set to pretty much no pre-travel and little post travel. Candy cane break like in an AR Geissele trigger.   The only problem I had at first was the lighter striker spring I installed (the 4 lb. spring) gave me an occasional light strike (1 out of 100 rounds with WWB)  but after some more break in (since everything was installed on a new gun) and after removing a small burr on the striker; it runs very well now.   The only problem I face now is how to aim with Servigny fiber optic competition sights. I keep hitting left and can barely hit the broad side of a barn. It's a software issue. :("
Glocks,2xbf1r,LilFuniAZNBoi,1 point,Fri Feb 27 05:23:11 2015 UTC,"This the answer I was I looking for.  So, it seems I can reduce trigger pull weight with the pyramid system alone, do I need I 3.5 lb connector?"
Glocks,2xbf1r,LilFuniAZNBoi,1 point,Fri Feb 27 05:57:10 2015 UTC,You do need the connector.
Glocks,2xbf1r,igrulks,1 point,Fri Feb 27 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"I put the middle option of the three choices in my G29. It makes a night and day difference: all pretravel gone, more positive feeling on reset, better feeling trigger pad. Occassionally, Pyramid offers a 50% off deal on triggers, but they are once in a blue moon.   As far as the 3.5 pund connector, the middle and highend kits come w a lightened connector."
Glocks,2xbf1r,bug442,0,Sun Mar 1 18:50:18 2015 UTC,"Ordered the new one for my glock 42...definitely took up all ""slack"" on trigger but did not lessen trigger pull weight..made it crisper..have all competition spring kits in my 30s,17.34. With lighter pull weights and safety plunger..would recommend spring kits rather than trigger Assy."
Glocks,2xbf1r,bug442,1 point,Fri Feb 27 16:55:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. My 23 also has a spring kit. The trigger is pretty light as it is. It could use a shorter, cleaner reset, but based on yours and other advice, I think the money is better spent on other things."
Glocks,2xa6kq,jakizely,1 point,Thu Feb 26 22:14:39 2015 UTC,So just go with the 23 and shoot all three?  Ok then!
Glocks,2xa6kq,_Tashtego_,1 point,Thu Feb 26 22:20:47 2015 UTC,You can go with either the 32 or 23 and gain the ability to shoot all three thru barrel and magazine swaps. The 23 may have a slightly higher resale value due to higher demand if that is a concern to you. If you want to start out with .357 Sig though and add the other options down the road to 32 is just as legitimate a choice as the 23.
Glocks,2xa6kq,aaabbcd,1 point,Thu Feb 26 22:44:29 2015 UTC,https://www.lonewolfdist.com/Detail.aspx?PROD=983&CAT=241  This one will wok for what you are suggesting?
Glocks,2xa6kq,slalomz,4,Thu Feb 26 22:58:44 2015 UTC,I'd look for a police trade in G22 or G23. It will be the cheapest glock you can find. Then you can get a 9mm conversion barrel and a factory glock 31 or 32 barrel and be good to go.
Glocks,2xa6kq,colin00nelson,1 point,Thu Feb 26 22:51:54 2015 UTC,"The only issue with that is I live in MD.  So I wouldn't get any mags with it.  I mean, I would have to go buy some anyways so I wouldn't be stuck with friggin 10 rounders, but I'd at least have extras."
Glocks,2xa6kq,Ryouske,3,Thu Feb 26 22:58:29 2015 UTC,"You can't convert a 9mm Glock to 357 Sig, only the other way around."
Glocks,2xa6kq,BlackGhostPanda,3,Fri Feb 27 03:00:24 2015 UTC,"Do you want .357 sig to be your defense round? If so, then the G32 with a 9mm conversion barrel."
Glocks,2xa6kq,Ryouske,2,Thu Feb 26 22:22:02 2015 UTC,Go with the 23 or 23. I wish I had. I love my 19 but it would be nice to be able to fire multiple calipers through it.
Glocks,2xa6kq,bmdaia,3,Thu Feb 26 23:04:46 2015 UTC,I don't think I'd recommend firing a caliper out of a glock lol.
Glocks,2x95a1,dyi01,2,Thu Feb 26 17:46:45 2015 UTC,"I've had a standard 5lb Ghost connector and an Evo drop in 3.5 that removes the ""bump"" in the pull thru to nice crisp break. That was strange at first but I LOVE it now. I love Ghost connectors and their CS is outstanding if you ever have an issue."
Glocks,2x95a1,Captfluffy556,1 point,Thu Feb 26 18:16:21 2015 UTC,Evo is pretty awesome with the spring kit. Short take up with a nice break. Best 40 dollar trigger upgrade anyone can do. A little polishing helps a lot on the connector btw
Glocks,2x95a1,AHappyMeal,1 point,Sun Mar 1 12:06:08 2015 UTC,I never thought about polishing the Ghost connector. That's a great idea. Do you polish it in the same places as you would with the standard .25 trigger job?
Glocks,2x95a1,Captfluffy556,1 point,Sun Mar 1 16:04:30 2015 UTC,Yea pretty much. You can eliminate a lot of grittiness on the break and takeup
Glocks,2x95a1,AHappyMeal,1 point,Sun Mar 1 17:25:42 2015 UTC,"I tried to put an Evo Elite into my Gen4 19, and it caused a significant drag on the slide to the point that would not return to battery. Even after bending the connector inwards and replacing the recoil spring, it would inhibit the slide form returning to battery. Any suggestions to fix this?"
Glocks,2x95a1,Gwa_62,2,Fri Feb 27 00:30:35 2015 UTC,I bought an armorers orange backplate so I could see inside the back of the slide of my G26 and remove material a little at a time until I got it exactly where I wanted it.  Before becoming a home armorer I watched the Magicman do my G17 at a gunshow and he took it apart and filed down the connector about 6 times before it was where he liked it.
Glocks,2x95a1,NoSuddenMoves,2,Fri Feb 27 03:03:25 2015 UTC,"I had a slight bit of drag on my slide as well, I had to remove a small amount of material from the small ear at the very top of the connector that makes a 90 degree right turn right above the frame rail. I just removed a small amount until the slide drag went away."
Glocks,2x6dg9,southeast_boarder,8,Thu Feb 26 00:32:23 2015 UTC,"Liking how the front serrations leave the Glock logo and the number untouched. Other than that, also pretty nice in general, not overdone or stupid looking.  Almost looks like that's how it came out of the box."
Glocks,2x6dg9,InsertEvilLaugh,3,Thu Feb 26 01:49:28 2015 UTC,I feel like all Glocks should come with the front serrations. They're functional and visually appealing.
Glocks,2x6dg9,nimoythedestroyer,2,Fri Feb 27 16:38:22 2015 UTC,Normally I don't like front serrations on a glock (see lone wolf slides) but I'll be damned if yours doesn't look fantastic.
Glocks,2x6dg9,G19Gen3,3,Fri Feb 27 23:41:21 2015 UTC,"These don't look like they're just shoved on there though. They look like part of the design while also being functional. Being straight up and down follows the flow of Glock's penchant for right angles, and those U-shapes are reminiscent of Glock's rounded G."

Glocks,2x6dg9,SmithWessonMP,3,Thu Feb 26 07:50:25 2015 UTC,and then you and your slide went for a long walk on the beach...   at least that's what I thought when I saw the thumbnail
Glocks,2x6dg9,NoSuddenMoves,3,Thu Feb 26 16:42:45 2015 UTC,"That looks really good. I suppose you wanted the front serrations to help charge since the sight is in the way? What was the total cost from the stock setup, if you don't mind me asking?"
Glocks,2x6dg9,30_yard_pin,1 point,Thu Feb 26 00:41:22 2015 UTC,$250 for the slide work $100 for sights  $500 for RMR   Yes the front serrations are to make it easier due to taller sights and easier press checks
Glocks,2x6dg9,NoSuddenMoves,1 point,Thu Feb 26 00:53:11 2015 UTC,How do you like the RM07?
Glocks,2x6dg9,Sit-Rep,1 point,Thu Feb 26 01:08:20 2015 UTC,I love it. I think the 6.5 MOA is a nice compromise between target acquisition and precision. Plus being able to adjust brightness is a huge plus since I'll be getting a new weaponlight soon and the white light has a habit of washing out the dot.
Glocks,2x6dg9,bmx13,1 point,Thu Feb 26 01:11:36 2015 UTC,So RM07 > RM01?

The farthest I've been inside is the waiting room, and it took 3 guards, a photo ID, and a quick background check just to get to that point."
Glocks,2x7wij,bmdaia,2,Thu Feb 26 20:34:15 2015 UTC,Background check for the waiting room?  That seems excessive.
Glocks,2x7wij,45shooter,1 point,Fri Feb 27 02:41:21 2015 UTC,"You can take your Glock to the factory and have work done (new sights, etc...) and it's normally MUCH cheaper than buying aftermarket parts.  I took a G36 in for night sights... out the door for a $50 bill.  But yeah, a guard meets you at a big iron gate, asks for ID, you sit in your car for a while... they run your info then have you come in and park.  There is another guard waiting for you at the door to the waiting room, you hand over your pistol, they take it back while you wait.  It took about 10 mins for the installation."
