secondlife,3e5ajz,NPVT,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:23:39 2015 UTC,"I have many years in SL. After much deliberation on the matter I came to the conclusion long ago second life means second life in that someone can portray themselves as they see fit. Because of my creativity and line of work in SL, it was neccessary for me to use several alts as actors.  This will sound a bit crazy to some people but each alt gets assigned their own profile, gender (sometimes even a furry) and even their own email address.  Some characters have not developed beyond their use as actors whereas others have developed their own set of friends, relationships and social patterns.  I see no need to ""come clean"" to anyone as to the root identity of these avatars as they function and thrive perfectly in the enviroment they each have forged. In actuality I think ""coming clean"" would in effect hurt others feelings and spoil the charm of the SL environment they flurished in.   I guess my conclusion in this discourse is that it's ok to portray yourself as who you want in SL. Don't spoil the experience for others by having a personal epithany and desire to come clean inworld and spoiling someone elses virtual life.  Now that being said my main avatar is uniquely associated to my RL and used in professional circles. This by my choice."

Any parts that fail to rez (perhaps because they are wanting to rez outside of the region etc) will simply cease to exist. They will not end up back in your inventory.  If you are 100% sure that it wasn't in your inventory before you started rezzing objects then it might still be out somewhere on the previous sim, go look.  If it's gone from there and you don't have it AND you were on a private sim, you need to get the sim owner to request a roll back from LL, you will need to provide the exact time and date for the roll back and cross your fingers. Roll backs are process quickly. HOWEVER, it will roll back everything on the entire region. Obviously this is entirely dependant on the sim owner and it may take some organisation with other tenants who may have placed unique items since your snafu. If you were on mainland then you have no chance."

secondlife,3dllnf,lurker1101,2,Fri Jul 17 11:52:10 2015 UTC,"Mainly you just need blender skills  Mesh studio useful, mock up your creation in SL with prims, port those to blender and use as a guide for your actual modelling, then when you pull it back into SL, it fits. Don't ever just reimport the output from mesh studio, it will have tons of redundant geometry.  Don't waste geometry when a texture or material will do  Don't model detail no on will see (at reasonable on screen size).  Edit other peoples mesh objects in world, move your camera inside to see the geometry. Be critical.   Look at models made for video games.  A few triangles as possible, literately the least number you can get away with.  Try to think more like you are making a a model using paper craft than solid objects. Your model doesn't have to be structurally sound, it just has to look like it is.  Don't depend on the mesh uploader to do your LOD. Learn to simplify your models by hand (its really not that hard) so you at least make one of the LOD meshes yourself, it can make a huge impression in world. (just make the model smaller on screen, delete the faces you wont notice missing)  Test your objects in SL with LOD settings that match the Linden SL viewer. That way your objects will degrade better for everyone no matter what viewer they use.  (Keep in mind Firestorms LOD is double what LL sets for the same named settings).  Don't ever tell people to change their LOD settings just so your model looks right. If it needs to be lower LI, make those savings yourself by editing the mesh /  LODs / Physics.  Make your own physics meshes, you can make them simpler and better than the mesh uploader every time.  Blender low poly tutorials .. do lots, do more."

She implied that they had Big Bird and VMM ready and waiting. She asked if they were going to be the next two promoted and indeed they were...well assuming the VMM promotes before the 23rd.  i really do actually hope that FS gets VMM integrated and pushed out quickly. I like VMM and think it was nicely done. If FS doesnt get it merged and deployed people will think negatively on VMM because they have to use the LL viewer.

Statistically, the viewers reliability depends far more on it being run on a 64bit OS, 64bit viewers require more work and offer minimal additional stability in return (which is the Labs primary metric of what makes a good viewer and why they haven't bothered with 64)."

secondlife,3d3u6s,biggest_guru_in_town,2,Mon Jul 20 02:46:26 2015 UTC,No. The entire point of secondlife is that yoy can be something you're not.
secondlife,3d3u6s,fearachieved,2,Mon Jul 13 17:29:56 2015 UTC,"Yes. Anything except for playing has an avatar that 100% represents you in gender, race, and species is weird and you should see a doctor. [Sarcasam Punctuation Mark]. Anyway your GF is probably a bit distruaght because she might have wanted to do... other things, with you, that you can do in SL, and isn't that hype on having two girls. I might suggest making a male avatar for hanging around her? If she's straight, it would certainly make her feel better. :P"
secondlife,3d3u6s,AdeonWriter,3,Mon Jul 13 17:35:18 2015 UTC,"Personally, I find playing cross gender is fine as long as you're not in SL to date(etc), and if you are, be honest. SL is a great place for personal exploration.  Male fashion is not as lacking as you might initially think, simply, most vendors don't cater to both genders and the majority is aimed at women.  You are however coming to a world where the sad truth is, a lot of straight guys play girls in SL to date, and it's not only creepy, it's very often sexist, routed in homophobia/transphobia and even a little misogynistic.  Lots of guys get an attractive female avatar and go looking for lesbian love, pay attention to statements/hints about RL gender, and then hope their partner turns out to be actually female, only lesbian in SL or can be convinced straight.  Or put another way, it's ok to be a straight guy playing a girl but not ok to date someone else who is dong that (ewww gay!), it's perfectly ok to trick and lie to get someone's affections, a woman's decision about her own sexuality isn't entirely up to her and is open to emotional persuasion.  A lot of guys get around this by simply never mentioning gender, it's ok to be in lesbians with another guy if no one breaks the magic, which is literal homophobia. It's not gay, it's being so terrified of the gay that admitting gender might mean an emotional connection to another guy, and the gay.  In ten years in SL I've yet to meet a girl who played a guy, exclusively dated gay guys and hoped they were secretly straight (or could be convinced).   Coming back to it being ok or not, really this is between you, your GF and those you meet in SL. Keeping in mind that you don't exist in a vacuum. I find honesty is always the better policy and I, personally, tend to have more respect for guys who play guys."

I find that playing as a woman and trying to look at things like I imagine she would, has given me an entirely new perspective on many things.

secondlife,3d0cla,chirpymoon,3,Sun Jul 12 12:43:54 2015 UTC,"Optimo's classes at Builder's Brewery will cover how to use Blender to make and import mesh items into SL quite well.  There are several series and if you take them all you'll be well on your way.  He's amazing.  Gimp is a freeware version of Photoshop if you don't have that, and is more than adequate for Second Life creation.  I'm not aware of a ton of general classes at BB on Gimp, but you can work through tutorials on youtube etc to get familiar with it.  Then take some BB classes on things like creating Alpha Layers, or seamless textures. Daz 3D is also freeware and useful for creating poses (static or animated) in SL.  Again there are classes offered at BB from time to time on how to specifically create them for SL  edit: Corrected the spelling of Optimo's name"
secondlife,3d0cla,Reneeisme,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:04:19 2015 UTC,Just downloaded Daz 3D and it looks ideal! thanks!
secondlife,3d0cla,ddagger,2,Mon Jul 13 01:12:52 2015 UTC,"Building inworld can be totally free. The build tools in your viewer are very good and fun to use. If you want to make your own textures, Gimp is similar to PhotoShop and is free. Blender (which you have) is used by many, of not most, mesh creators in SL, and it's free as well. You really don't need more than that to be able to create some amazing things for SL.  I suggest you start out with some classes at Builders Brewery and spend some time learning how to manipulate prims, link them to create objects, and texture them. This will give you a feel for creating 3D objects. You can also find many free textures inworld at BB, texture stores, and on the MP. Since you are doing this inworld, there are no upload fees. You'll later want to buy some good texture sets (or make your own in Gimp) and probably some full perm sculpts or mesh components to add details to your work.  In the meantime, play with Blender and follow some of the very good tutorials on Youtube. When you feel you're ready to make mesh items to bring into SL, you'll have upload fees (which are pretty nominal, but can add up). Test them on the beta grid for free before your final import to the main grid.  Have fun!"

secondlife,3ctlvq,BaadKitteh,3,Fri Jul 10 17:53:39 2015 UTC,"All of the suggestions given so far are helpful, but you also need to make sure you aren't attaching them to your eyeball- no insult intended if not, I've seen it- you can tell if you accidentally did that if they move when your eyes do. Nose attachment is the best point. Also, look in the Move and View settings of your preferred viewer and choose Disable Minimum Camera Distance. This will allow you to zoom all the way in on your face, rather than having to try to trick the camera into getting close by focusing on something behind you and swinging it around. Lastly, look into getting some lashes that have a resizing HUD that allows you to adjust the top and bottom lashes separately- much easier than going lash by lash in ""edit linked parts""."

It's in the dropdown next to the search bar. You won't see most adult skins without ""Adult"" content enabled.   As far as suggestions go, all the ones mentioned are good and I'd throw in Glam Affair as well; they have appliers for mesh bodies and they frequently put skins in weekly sales like Fifty Linden Friday. They have very young faces, if that's what you're looking for. Pink Fuel is also a very youthful skin maker, and Al Vulo. You'll be more likely to find mature, womanly skins at places like League, Lara Hurley, and Curio.

I've tried several versions of Firestorm, the official viewer, and the Alchemy viewer.  My best performance (2x than the latest FirestormOS-Releasex64) is on the Alchemy viewer. I use it for pretty much everything I do in SL - and it's ok with big groups (up to two dozen avis).

It devolves into a screaming or trolling match about how memory allotment means nothing, or how script time means nothing, or even that changes in script time during operation (ie, increase from idle state to firing in a gun) is not relevant. What are your thoughts on the matter, and how do you personally measure the effeciency of your scripts? How often do people approach you with a project then balk at paying you US minimum wage, let alone the actual rate peogrammers earn elsewhere? Many other scripters I encounter on SL tend to be... socially difficult. Ranging from extremely introverted to full blown asshole narcissist, there seems to be very few exceptions.

A good example is llSetLinkPrimitiveParams and llSetLinkPrimitiveParamsFast: the only difference between them is 0.2 seconds response time, but because the wiki/description misinforms/doesn't clearly state that there is no actual 0.0 response time, that the 0.2 seconds should only be used in the cases where extremely-minute-time-frames are necessary (for real-time computation etc.). The problem arises in the fact that the 'Fast' version of this function actually runs the argument on a completely separate 'thread' and so is non-communicative with other functions for a brief time. That basically means that if there was a function in the line before it, for example, that had vital information to be processed within the SetLink function and it was also a separate multithread, then the previous line may not finish in time before the second function 'begins' and display the incorrect information. IMHO, unless it's necessary just use llSetLinkPrimitiveParams; trying for 0.01 seconds is just not worth the risk. With regard to the llListReplaceList function, it actually causes a lot of lag and you cannot run many in a row without risking a crash. For this you can use the following user function instead, and avoid this problem(just put it at the top as though it was a normal variable being declared). It assumes ""my_list"" is the list which contains the index you want to change, while the example variable ""new_var"" is the variable we want to change index2replace to:   list ListReplaceList(list my_list, integer index2replace, [insert new variable type here] new_var){  list my_spare_list=[];  integer i=0;  for(i;i<llGetListLength(my_list);i++){  if (i!=index2replace) my_spare_list+=llList2[insert capitalized new variable type here](my_list,i);  else my_spare_list+=new_var;  }  return my_spare_list;  }   You will be able to call the above from anywhere within the script:   [insert list name to adjust] = ListReplaceList([insert list name to adjust here],[insert index2replace of your choice here],[insert new_var of your choice here (matching new_var type call in function name)]);   ~ I believe I answered this question in the first half of the second question! But to be clear I see no need in getting hung up on a 0.2 second delay unless the script requires it, and to use it unnecessarily kinda shows lack of experience on the matter in my opinion. I measure mine based on what I am doing; if I'm doing a lot of math then I might have to worry about using up the allotted memory while if I'm doing a lot of list management then I'd likely be more concerned about causing lag to the environment making the script's weight implode on itself, and cause crashes/memory loss.  ~ I think the problem is that people think because Second Life is also a 'game' that programmers in LSL are goofing off all the time, as a kind of predisposition. This is true in the cases of many but could also be caused by the media's opinion of video games equating to laziness.  ~ Absolutely true, with a hint of drug addiction amongst the best. I personally smoke a LOT of MJ as a self-medication for my depression and mild anxiety. I think the reason for this is that many strong minds are often unable to just 'turn it off' when the constant process is unneeded, which can be overwhelming. My favourite thing to bring up on this topic was summarized by the head of the FBI in response to the question as to why the best and brightest minds seemingly aren't able to compete with 20 year olds with too much time on their hands (underhanded insult toward professional hackers): his response was basically 'because we mandate employee drug tests'. Hilarious.  ~ I'm sorry about this one but I know about nothing of FireStorm. Do you think you could fill me in? I'll field my opinion as best I can given what I'm told but I don't really have the time to scour the interwebs at the current moment (after this short novel).   Thanks for the great questions!

secondlife,3bubbb,KarstenRutledge,2,Fri Jul 3 01:21:25 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there are many situations where llSetLinkPrimitiveParamsFast IS a necessity. Especially anything dealing with a user interface. 2/10ths of a second doesn't sound like a lot, but it is very noticable when a user is attempting to interact with your system, and it can compound incredibly fast if you need to update multiple UI elements at the same time.  Firestorm is a Third Party Viewer, the most popular by far. I think it's actually more widely used than the official viewer at this point, I'm shocked you've never heard of it. http://www.firestormviewer.org/  One of the many, many added features of Firestorm is they've attempted to implement a preprocessor into LSL."
secondlife,3bubbb,KarstenRutledge,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:44:10 2015 UTC,"This is a good point, if it were what it actually did! The wiki also does not specify how this 0.2 seconds manifests quantitatively. Basically speaking, it doesn't actually perform the action faster, but rather begins the next line/argument/event immediately after running the function asynchronously! That means that on a HUD (which I am actually in the middle of with CM) when the agent clicks on a HUD feature, it simply reacts faster but does not necessary guarantee it will be completed faster. This can also lead to, as I've noticed so far, many clicks at once/in sequence displayinng unstable unification among multiple components of the hud (scrambling of 'pages'). Because of this, the 0.2 seconds is worth it so that it will always register the lines sequentially and thus always end displaying the proper information! This took a lot of trial and error...  And yes I have heard of Firestorm but never used it. I was more inquiring about what is meant by preprocessing."
secondlife,3bubbb,KarstenRutledge,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:18:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's not the effect which is delayed, it's the calling script which is delayed, that's true for all functions with a delay. That can be really obnoxious for an interacting user depending on what the script is accomplishing. I've never had an issue with *Fast being threaded causing a problem with updates for the user interfaces I've used it for, but I can see how it could potentially be a problem in some cases. I think you greatly overstate the ""risk"" involved though.  Edit: Preprocessing is an industry standard term used by many languages. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprocessor"
secondlife,3bubbb,techplex,2,Fri Jul 3 02:29:05 2015 UTC,"My confusion is how it specifically relates to LSL. Since all functions besides select ones (llTargetOmega etc) are done server-side, I'm confused where the client would be capable of doing such a feat. Unless it's only for client-side application; in which case sure, I didn't think it was needed but that doesn't mean it's a bad idea!"
secondlife,3bubbb,Draco_Platina,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:40:53 2015 UTC,"It is all client-side, yes. Actually, scripts used to be compiled entirely client-side, and then the resulting byte-code shipped to the server. I believe they have since changed this to where the server does the compile, but the client still has ultimate say on what the final source-code is that gets sent. Firestorm implements a preprocessor that lets you do things like #includes. I've personally never used it, but I can see the appeal."

secondlife,3bubbb,KarstenRutledge,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:12:29 2015 UTC,"I use *Fast almost exclusively, as even a 0.2 delay is very apparent in the applications I use it in (Primarily prim animation and triggering other scripts through the changed event). Even in the simple application of turning a light on and off, that 0.2 seconds is agonizingly slow, and consumers will pan the product for not being responsive. I suppose I've been lucky that I've never had the function stumble, as I often use it in loops where variables (link number, colour, alpha, stuff like that) are determined directly above the call.  To use a specific example of performance disagreements, some scripters like to reset other scripts, which rez the bullets, to get their high rate of fire. I, on the other hand prefer to use *Fast to change the colour, triggering a script. The reset method makes the script time skyrocket very quickly, and it never seems to level out. My method, on the other hand, yields the same or higher ROF with only one additional rezzing script, and a more reasonable script time increase (script time ms increase per second) that begins to level out after a few seconds. Its performance in lag, however, is not so swell. Other scripters have aworn up and down that it means nothing, and that there is practically no overhead in resetting a script. I guess I come from a group where responsiveness and speed is held above almost all else, so I'm just as guilty of the bad practices you describe. At work, so that's about half of my post, back later to ramble more."
secondlife,3bubbb,DaemonBlackflag,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:38:33 2015 UTC,"Firestorm: Oh man, where to start. I would highly reccomend installing it and messing around with it, there are a tonne of neat features that I use all the time and don't realize they aren't standard until I try using a different viewer. The preprocessor specifically though, is an embodiment of at least the first, if not alll three, of the three virtues of a programmer (laziness, impatience and hubris). Take for example the snippet of code for ListReplaceList you provided; Normally, you'd have to copy and paste that in whenever you wanted to use it. With the preprocessor, you can put it in a library with related functions, (say, list.lsl) then use #include to be able to use any function in that library in your script. It also allows for a sort of metascripting usinf #define and #idef/#ifndef, dead handy for debugging, and then stripping all the debug code from the script when you don't need it. For the full lowdown, you can read the wiki entry here:  http://wiki.phoenixviewer.com/fs_preprocessor I honestly don't understand why everybody that knows about it doesn't use it. Outside of the small group of scripters I work with, I don't think I'be come across anyone else that uses it."
secondlife,3bubbb,KarstenRutledge,2,Fri Jul 3 19:47:35 2015 UTC,How did you learn LSL? And how did you find out about Second Life?
secondlife,3bubbb,DaemonBlackflag,4,Thu Jul 2 09:20:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for asking! I started LSL after shifting from C#, my native language, a few years back when I was trying to make a smooth Minecraft-esque game using 3D mesh deformity (like in GTA4+ where the cars crumple exactly where you hit them, unlike previous versions). That being said, there was little demand at the time since it was too bandwidth-intensive to be viable in multiplayer so I abandoned most of the work; yes, I kept the scripts. No current plans at the moment.  I got into Second Life wanting to make money with code. Since I'm self taught, LSL was kind of complimentary to my advance in C# and eventually took the lead (as embarrassing as that might be to admit for some)."
secondlife,3bubbb,KarstenRutledge,4,Thu Jul 2 10:10:15 2015 UTC,"Not embarrassing. I mean, it's not going to serve you any outside of SL, but hey, we work with the language we're given. No different than knowing any other obscure platform-specific language, of which there are many.  That being said, are you also flabbergasted on a routine basis that LSL still doesn't support arrays? If Project SANSAR doesn't come with a better coding language, I'm going to have a quiet little cry in a corner somewhere."
secondlife,3bubbb,DaemonBlackflag,4,Thu Jul 2 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"I think they would be shooting themselves in the foot if they didn't use something that's more of an industry standard or at least something many people are well versed in. For example, HighFidelity is using javascript which I think is a great choice if they want to include as much talent as possible.  But yeah, LSL is not used anywhere else. It's very difficult for me to find scripters to work with now-a-days. Heck it's also difficult for me to find professional sculptors to work with. Easy as hell to find meshers though, haha.  Knowing LSL or how to create optimized sculpts is actually a good way to make money if you know how to network with the right people.  And wow, no arrays in LSL? I did some googling and it looks like you have to jump through hoops to put together a makeshift version of one. Weird."
secondlife,3bubbb,KarstenRutledge,2,Fri Jul 3 00:27:50 2015 UTC,"Edit: Oops, wasn't paying attention, thought you were OP. Disregard. Unless OP reads this, then I'm still curious about the state thing.  How are you a 'professional scripter in SL' and you weren't aware that it can't do arrays? You've never needed to do an array before? Your scripts must not ever deal with much in the way of complicated data structures.  As an aside, do you find yourself using states much? I can count on one hand the number of times I've used the state system in the last 10 years, and even those could've been done without it without much additional code. I just don't see any practical application of states."
secondlife,3bubbb,DaemonBlackflag,2,Fri Jul 3 01:21:41 2015 UTC,"Not OP again. :)  Haha, no worries. I actually can script though, just never needed to use arrays for any of my mini projects. I have a team of people who do all of the heavy lifting in that regard, I wouldn't dare trust myself to code anything major league.  I made a 1Li teleport board for a gacha yardsale that sends people to 1 of 100+ locations. I made a mass-messenger to notify hundreds of users who rezzed items in a sim that they had to come pick their belongings up before it got returned. I've also made simple animations for SL Pets, and I'm currently playing with a method to deliver SL Objects and issue product licenses after successful payment with Bitcoin.  I'm not scripter though, I just like to get my feet wet with Meshing, Sculpting, Scripting and Texturing so I can better understand the professionals - it helps to be able to connect with them when piecing together a big project.   I'm a pretty good web designer though (Photoshop, Notepad, CSS and HTML are my friends). However I do know enough objective-c to get by making iOS apps, I enjoy fumbling around with php/mysql, and I have built simple networked node.js applications - but that's about it for me in the coding world. I would rather hire the pros who seem to do it in 1/4th the amount of time. :)  Hope I didn't confuse you too much, especially with my lengthy responses, I just like to partake in discussion!"

secondlife,3bubbb,DaemonBlackflag,2,Fri Jul 3 02:34:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, LSL supports flat lists only, which you could think of as one-dimensional arrays, but I would kill for the occasional 2D array.  Why are you still working in sculpts anyway? I am mixed half sculpt, half mesh myself, but it's not by choice.  I think the reason you have a hard time finding scripters to work with is we're all busy with projects already. No time in the day to take on new projects. I stopped doing commission work years ago simply because I had no time."
secondlife,3bubbb,KarstenRutledge,2,Fri Jul 3 01:27:55 2015 UTC,"Breedables. There's simply not a more efficient way to create a breedable animal that has various ""traits"" (different ear sculpts, different tail sculpts, etc.) than to just use sculpts and swap them out with code. It allows for unlimited new content by storing UUIDs in a database that the breedable can grab and throw on itself. This also means only 1 animal object is required to maintain in-world. (A few more if you have things like optional Horns and Wings.)  Lets say you have 7 hair traits, 7 ear traits, 7 tail traits... 7x7x7 = 343 possible combinations that the breeder can create. We'd have to store 343 different animals if we used mesh, OR just swap with sculpt. I have even tried attaching all traits via mesh, each with its own texture face, and just showing 1 of the texture faces - but it becomes far too laggy with 21 invisible mesh on each animal, especially when some people own 100+ at a time, thats 2100 additional pieces of mesh that SL is for whatever reason still rendering - causing extra local lag.  I also tried a method of attaching all traits to the animal, and using script to ""unlink"" and ""delete"" the unnecessary prims, keeping the same link order and everything - BUT - this requires giving modify rights to everyone, which is a big no-no with breedables.  So, still dealing with sculpts. I have been playing around with a hybrid sculpt/mesh idea though - it gets slightly better Li than straight sculpt."
secondlife,3bubbb,ArgentStonecutter,2,Fri Jul 3 01:55:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get that. I'm dealing with sculpts still for exactly the same reason. My games have addon themes that let the game download entirely new themes from my webserver and implement them in-world entirely using the UUIDs and texture information. I really wish I could do that with mesh."
secondlife,3bubbb,DaemonBlackflag,2,Fri Jul 3 02:00:05 2015 UTC,"Right? And I know it has to be possible.  I mean think about it, if I understand how Mesh works, it's using the same ""Object"" just with extra data under the hood so it knows to load a mesh. It even can be resized/scaled/rotated in-world like a standard object. All we'd do is use the UUID to swap out the object's mesh it loads, and resize/rotate/position it accordingly.  I know the main reason is probably so you can't easily copybot mesh by ""knowing a UUID to be able to steal anything"", but it really limits SL. I don't think LL realizes how much better the content could be if we could do this.   And don't get me started on Skeletons for Objects, a realistically animated animal with its own skeleton to rig mesh to, and animations that could be played back like an AO for the objects... would definitely be a step in the right direction for great looking content in SL."
secondlife,3bubbb,stevehamner,2,Fri Jul 3 02:04:27 2015 UTC,"The excuse I've heard is that they don't want people 'animating' mesh the same way they 'animate' sculpts by rapidly swapping out the sculpt shape. Doing that with sculpt yields a fixed resource usage. Doing it with a mesh shape could result in drastically fluctuating vertice and texture count, which could result in a really hard FPS hit on both sims and viewers. I can see the logic in that, but I wish they'd done something like enforce a long delay between mesh changes instead. I'll take 'possible and slow' over 'impossible.'"
secondlife,3bubbb,PohpohPoh,2,Fri Jul 3 02:09:43 2015 UTC,"I haven't thought of it that way, but yes that would be annoying - rapidly swapping the mesh UUID.  But, if I fill a sim with mesh, close quarters right now, it would probably crash the average user in a heartbeat, or at least take their framerate to 3fps.   They should make it a feature that only Premium Members can use, similar to how they are doing Experience Tools - so there would be accountability."
secondlife,3bubbb,KarstenRutledge,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:15:26 2015 UTC,"Contrary to popular belief though, you ARE able to do just this! Animating mesh is more properly called 'UUID Flipping' and DOES use an egregious amount of resources.

I heard that when LL found out you were under-age, they would either transfer you to the teen grid or lock your account until you reached the appropriate age. As you are already 17, they may ban you from adult sims but nothing more will happen. And please, do not create a new account! Keep last names alive!"
secondlife,3bl2lp,SydoxX,2,Wed Jul 1 16:26:26 2015 UTC,"You lied about your age, damage is done. That said, assuming your account is still in good standing once you turn 18 you will likely be OK. If for some reason LL were to find out though that your bday was false it would be grounds enough to suspend your account."

Honestly, I would just start over again. It can be really refreshing and reinvigorating! :)  The only reason I would stick with your old account is if you're really tied to the name, and something to bear in mind is that newly created accounts only have the option of using ""Resident"" as a last name. But otherwise, there's no reason not to re-roll, so to speak. And then you'll be able to take advantage of the awesome goodies that designers often put out for avies who are 30 days old or younger. Here's a list for reference: https://fabfree.wordpress.com/fabfree-30-days-list/"
secondlife,3bl2lp,EverAfterrSL,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:55:39 2015 UTC,About the resident thing. Most of the time inworld people will only see you with the name you choose and not resident. The resident thing mostly comes up in scripted items.
secondlife,3bl2lp,em-e-chan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:33:31 2015 UTC,"Yep! Just wanted to make a note of it in case the OP was tied to having a more unique last name. I believe that was still a thing in 2010? Not sure when it switched over, and I dearly wish they'd go back to the old format. Ahh well! :)"
secondlife,3bl2lp,EverAfterrSL,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:40:35 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I wish they'd go back to but perhaps with more freedom in the choice of last name. Regardless I was just trying to help OP understand how it would effect them inworld really. So they'd get the full picture.
secondlife,3bl2lp,em-e-chan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:46:10 2015 UTC,"I had a friend whose avatar on the main grid was banned for this reason, and he was able to recover it eventually. I'm not sure if they just banned it until he turned 18, or if they decided to lift bans on all underage main grid accounts when they merged Teen and Main. In any case, what matters now is that you are not below the minimum age. As long as you keep out of Adult rated sims until you're 18 (not like the sim rating means anything- people still insist on wearing their huge-titted horse-dicked futa Asari avatars in moderate sims, and will AR you for harassment if you ask them to put their dicks away), you should be fine. Personally, I'd stick with your old account. Some places automatically eject avatars under a certain age (I've seen everywhere from 0 days up to 3 months) due to griefing concerns, and as much as some want to shout ""Age has nothing to do with maturity!"", I can assure you people will be much more at ease around a 5 year old avatar than a 5 day old avatar."
secondlife,3bl2lp,Draco_Platina,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:22:50 2015 UTC,At this point in time (if you don't already know) things were changed in good old SL and the teen grid was closed. I believe the teenagers were moved into the main grid of SL but cannot access the adult areas till their 18.
