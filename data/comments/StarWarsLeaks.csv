It's like they knew the story was weak and tried to make up for it by plying us with nostalgia and better vfx.  Now Disney is likely going do the same, and just like Lucas, make billions doing it. You can get rich giving the fans what they want, originality is a dangerous play, but dammit what I wouldn't give to experience what people in the theater in 1977 did. To see something new, something daring, something great. Greatness doesn't imitate and it doesn't repeat itself. The best comedians throw out their old jokes and constantly come up with new material.

He'll be killed at the end of the movie and the story of Kylo Ren will continue into Episode VIII. I feel like Phasma will stick around until the end, and I'd be surprised if Snoke has anything more than just a brief appearance in TFA, assuming his role is like that of the Emperor's in the OT."

The prequels did that, and in my opinion, it was a missed opportunity to create a real epic, three part, struggle between the protagonists and an antagonist.  Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi; the villain was clearly Darth Vader. Every time Luke confronted Vader it meant something. Defeating Darth Vader in ROTJ meant something.

StarWarsLeaks,3e0bw6,askmeagainsometime,3,Tue Jul 21 04:13:10 2015 UTC,"Even one tiny mention of he character of Dooku in TPM would have made his character that much more believable. He's just sort of thrown into AoTC. Mace Windu mentions Doodu, ""who?"". Dooku is the leader of the separatists, ""the fuck is a separatist? Who is this Dooku?"". They finally show him, ""he's...he's not that evil. Who is this? Why do I care?"" That was the problem with every villain in the prequels."
StarWarsLeaks,3e0bw6,Killzark,2,Tue Jul 21 13:11:42 2015 UTC,"In defence of this however, there is a 10 year gap between TPM and AoTC.  Anything can happen in that time frame."
StarWarsLeaks,3e0bw6,darthrossi,2,Tue Jul 21 14:10:11 2015 UTC,Which brings up the argument that the prequels should have started around the time of Anakin being a Palawan. That 10 year gap is just too much.
StarWarsLeaks,3e0bw6,Killzark,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:46 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the 10 year gap basically makes Phantom Menace pointless. It really only sets up Anakin being trained by Obi-Wan and Palpatine beginning his rise to power. They could have done the same in AOTC with a few lines of dialogue."

StarWarsLeaks,3dx3vn,Throwawayfortheghost,7,Mon Jul 20 07:40:51 2015 UTC,I agree. The novelization post stunk horribly. The second and third act were horribly written and described. Espcially all the stuff with the lightsaber. I still HIGHLY doubt that Anakin Skywalker being Darth Vader was public knowledge.
StarWarsLeaks,3dx3vn,thomashush,5,Mon Jul 20 13:54:21 2015 UTC,"You are correct!  In the Tarkin novel, which is about halfway between III and IV (closer to IV), no one knows who Vader is but Palpatine.  Tarkin pieces together that it's Anakin from several clues, but keeps it to himself.  This novel is canon."
StarWarsLeaks,3dx3vn,CSMcCringleberry,2,Mon Jul 20 17:47:55 2015 UTC,"Also the line in the ""novelization"" about ""only one person wielding it"" or whatever is horrible. Anakin used his lightsaber for many great and noble things before the end."

If this is true, I can see Kylo doing this as a means of luring Luke out of hiding and spreading word around the galaxy that Luke is evil. It's a propoganda campaign and I could see it being a really cool part of a larger story. I find it believable, but, I'll take it with a grain of salt. It isn't too far out of the realms of possibility considering the rest of the supposed novel sounds reasonable. No crystal, no lightsaber MacGuffin and no ancient Sith Lord pulling the strings. Something new but really simple."
StarWarsLeaks,3dx3vn,Palpadean,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:28:39 2015 UTC,"It would make a certain amount of sense for Kylo to be masquerading as Luke, and even for the First Order to capitalize on Luke being Vader's son. Surely this was a widely known secret in the upper echelons of the Imperial Command by the time of Return of the Jedi, but one that nobody dared speak. That could make for devastating propaganda material for the First Order if Luke were to establish a Jedi Order to guide the New Republic/Resistance. Its being revealed to the public could be a factor in why Luke retreats from the Galaxy at some point prior to TFA."
StarWarsLeaks,3dx3vn,Throwawayfortheghost,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:46:40 2015 UTC,"It would prove to be a very tangible reason to get the original trio involved in the plot.

StarWarsLeaks,3dx3vn,midoriiro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:09:09 2015 UTC,so how do you explain the concept art of Vader at the Jakku burning? Doesn't that mean Kylo is trying to pose as vader?  How about the Plagueis-like stand in concept art which depicts finn throwing rey the blue sabre and a plagueis like creature watching it?   It was all stand-in art because the final kylo design was not in place by the time the art was being created.
StarWarsLeaks,3dx3vn,wp4815162342,5,Mon Jul 20 07:52:49 2015 UTC,Not all concept art gets used by a movie. A lot of it is idea generation.    I honestly believe that JJ Abrams has no idea who Darth Vegas is.
StarWarsLeaks,3dx3vn,arrownymous,3,Mon Jul 20 08:20:17 2015 UTC,"I think he probably knows, with all the fan rumors and everything - after all, it was Kasdan who said Darth Vegas, and Abrams was the one who said no to the question."

StarWarsLeaks,3dx3vn,midoriiro,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:50:41 2015 UTC,"No, at Comic Con someone asked JJ and Kasdan if Darth Plagueis was in the movie. Kasdan ""misheard"" this, and said that ""Darth Vegas"" was not going to be in the movie. JJ obviously knew what was going on, and there was definitely a lot of tension in that moment. I'm guessing that Kasdan did not see that coming and tried to play it off as a joke.  I have a feeling Plagueis is somehow involved. When asked the question, he answered by saying they're not going to talk much about story, and following it with ""But I will say...no."" He could have just said ""No, Plagueis will not be in the movie."" It's food for thought."

StarWarsLeaks,3du12v,phyloh,3,Mon Jul 20 00:39:02 2015 UTC,"But Luke wholly rejected the Dark Side when he threw his saber away. He saw that the dark place he tapped into when he bested his father would only lead him further down his Fathers destiny.

I'd like to think that the Chosen One business was about the whole Mortis storyline. I think Anakin, in choosing to leave, thus invalidated the prophecy and that's why there were the dark times.   You could argue that ultimately, by killing Sheev and then dying himself, he ""fulfilled the prophecy."" But I think that the if there was any truth the prophecy, it has to do with that Clone Wars episode.   Dave Filoni and those folks behind the cartoons are the best at filling in the prequel plot holes. TCW has made me appreciate the PT much, much more."

StarWarsLeaks,3du12v,bluegrassgazer,5,Sun Jul 19 20:41:29 2015 UTC,Most of the stuff you said was wrong. They released 13 episodes that were all part of season 6. Those were all the complete episodes they had so they released them. The yoda episodes were not meant to be in season 7. They have also released some unfinished episodes.

StarWarsLeaks,3du12v,tooboredtostudy,4,Mon Jul 20 19:34:02 2015 UTC,"I see no dilemma with an old prophecy not panning out. Vader says that it's Luke's destiny to join the dark side. Luke didn't. Here, the PT council didn't have a perfect understanding of the force either. And that's why they're all dead.  On a meta/storytelling level, prophecies are poor vehicles for foreshadowing and TFA shouldn't even address this at all. The whole appeal with jedi and the force in the OT is that they're mysteriously powerful. That's why it's called ""the force"". The prophecy in the PT was Lucas' lazy attempt to recreate this appeal by telling instead of showing. Moving forward, Abrams should let the audience and characters go back to being amazed at the force instead of having it explained to them in pseudo-scientific detail."

StarWarsLeaks,3du12v,RealVoltar,2,Sun Jul 19 13:59:40 2015 UTC,The significance of the season 6 episodes is that they were the ones that were completed.  I'm not sure why the prophecy needs a work around or how this does it.
StarWarsLeaks,3du12v,northernsage,5,Mon Jul 20 07:15:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's more likely that what was in those episodes was going to conflict with the storytelling narrative that Disney, or whatever brain trust was behind the decisions, wanted to push forward with rebels, novels, comics, and TFA.  What is clear from the comics and from rebels is that they wanted Darth Vader to get back to being the bad-ass that he was and which made him so compelling and likeable as a villain.  Villains, while sometimes very compelling, are often the ones we hope to fail in film and television; but that's what made Darth Vader in the OT so cool is that you kind of rooted for him.  That feeling was lost in the prequels with the 'chosen one' narrative.  I think Disney realized what made Darth so awesome and what was the downfall of Anakin's character is that we need to both hate and love him at the same time.  There was very little to like about Anakin in the prequels.  In other words, the takeaway from my comment and in response to your post is that no, I don't think they're hiding things as so much as wishing to alter the course of the storytelling.  But, we may never know....."
StarWarsLeaks,3du12v,HenryChinaskiForPrez,8,Sun Jul 19 13:58:56 2015 UTC,"I think they had to cancel TCW because of the particulars of the deal with the Cartoon Network, IIRC."
StarWarsLeaks,3du12v,DarthWho93,2,Sun Jul 19 16:59:54 2015 UTC,"A zen understanding of the impermanence of existence, is what is hidden in Yoda's ancient and storied experience with the final wave of the Jedi Order of the Republic. It had grown stagnant, and the Force always moves on. Anakin was the inevitable outcome of a dead system, one that would destroy it. The Chosen One. It happened. All established institutions of the Force are gone, and we are left with that man's son, Luke, and his vague interpretations of what came before to rear the next generation. That's what's 'hidden'."
StarWarsLeaks,3du12v,HenryChinaskiForPrez,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:48:20 2015 UTC,"I think it was very important, from a mythology standpoint, although I don't think that there is anything really ""hidden"" in the story*. That said, I do think that was perhaps some of the most important mythological stories in the entire TCW.   I also disagree that Yoda ""knew what was coming,"" but rather saw a vision of the future and thought (like other future-seeing) that it was just a possibility.   *One caveat, I do think that there is something to the fact that the Sith homeworld's name was changed. I've heard that GL just liked the new name ""better,"" but I am wondering if they didn't have to settle that because of something coming in the future."
StarWarsLeaks,3du12v,YOU_INSPIRE_US,3,Sun Jul 19 17:08:19 2015 UTC,"I suspect the name change was because ""Coruscant"" and ""Korriban"" are audibly similar. To those who are new to the Galaxy Far, Far Away, a name like Moriband (which has some superficial similarities to Korriban, but is obviously based off of the word ""moribund"") is much more distinct.  It makes me wonder if Lucas himself got the planets confused, and thus ordered a name change.  That said, I'm not happy about the change. I will always think of Korriban (as well as Ziost and Dromund Kaas) as the homeworld of the Sith."
StarWarsLeaks,3du12v,HenryChinaskiForPrez,2,Sun Jul 19 19:37:36 2015 UTC,"The name change didnt really have anything to do with Star Wars, it was just conflicting documents. Most of the stuff from BBY and the original concept said it was called Korriban, just about everything else said Moriband. I think they just decided to go with Moriband. I dont agree with this decision though, as its quite obvious that Korriban was the much more well known name."
StarWarsLeaks,3du12v,morning_drums,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:38:02 2015 UTC,"Ah, I thought it was related to the stuff going forward. I never heard Moriband before. And still, maybe it was important to what was gonna happen? Maybe that's part of the GL outline stuff they scrapped."

Yes, Vader took himself and the Emperor out.. but to think that'd end evil altogether is crazy.

A prophecy, by nature, will come true regardless of ones choices, but may not come true the way you thought it would, or wanted it to.  Anakin joining Sidious was a bad choice, but ultimately put him in a position to end him.  Anakin marrying Padme was a bad choice as is was breaking the rules of Jedidome, but ultimately it led to a Chosen One bloodline.  An insurance policy of sorts against evil.  This will play, even if its under the surface, in the ST."

Disney wants to keep the money train going, and I will say this for them, they're pretty great at doing that without killing it through overexposure.  Honestly I can't wait to see where this all goes. The Star Wars universe is potentially a huge storytelling sandbox.

StarWarsLeaks,3dt436,TzuWu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:32:48 2015 UTC,"I guess that was the issue of trying to make a Space Opera in the late 70's/early 80's compared to making one in the late 90's/early 2000's. I've always felt that Lucas waited a bit too long or even not long enough to make a prequel trilogy. For me the prequels seemingly had better technologies than that of the OT, and not much thought went into that process. It baffles me when people use phrases like ""Star Trek with lightsabers"" because before JJ's Trek movies the Trek universe was always about the human element,survival and morality of choices made. I loved the old Trek and hope JJ dosen't ruin the parts of Star Wars that we've all grown to love so much. Edit - I'd also like to make a side note here, the PT came out starting 16 years ago and ended 10 years ago. ""Fresh in your memory""? At some point you just have to move on.

We don't for sure know the story of Episode VII, and we know next to nothing of VIII and IX, they could set up lore that could naturally flow into a sequel sequel trilogy.

StarWarsLeaks,3dt436,kingfagit,6,Sun Jul 19 15:41:12 2015 UTC,"It's very possible, and that scares me to death.  Part of what makes Star Wars a special, cultural phenomenon is (or was) its rarity. The fact that it took 16 years after Jedi to start the prequel trilogy makes those films more special. 10 years and the massive disappointment that was the PT makes the sequel trilogy more special. Looking at what's happening with Marvel, I don't think Disney has the self-control to let go of Star Wars when it needs to be. I already feel that the anthology trilogy is too damn much.  While I love the fact we get VII, VIII, and IX, I feel it's going to quickly become over-saturated and boring, especially with rumors of an Obi-wan trilogy in the future. We're talking a trilogy of trilogies.  Mr. Plinkett of RedLetterMedia refers to this as 'Marvelitis.'"

I feel like the sequels to the original standalone movies were all better than the originals (minus maybe Iron Man), and they did a good job with Age of Ultron, and they made the best Marvel movie yet which is GOTG (in my opinion of course), and Ant-Man is really good too! I feel like if there is anyone we can trust Star Wars too, I think most people would prefer it to Disney than anyone else. It might seem like too much, but we don't know their plans after Episode 9, so we may not get more Star Wars for a while, so we should enjoy it while we know it's coming.

He didn't win a massive fanbase, which includes Simon Pegg and David Lindelof, by being superficial.   I formed my own opinions about the prequels long before Stoklasa started producing his Star Wars reviews, but what I really liked about his work is that he articulated things that didn't sit right with me that I hadn't been able to put my finger on. That's not doing my thinking for me. And despite agreeing with pretty much all of his points, I still enjoy some aspects of the prequels quite a bit. Letting him do my thinking for me would to disregard them entirely because Plinkett said the films are bad.   Forming one's own opinion is very important, but what good is that opinion if it can't withstand exposure to another? If you don't get why people have ""such a raging hard-on"" for Plinkett, why not check out at least one of his reviews for yourself? (In a later comment you mentioned that you've never seen one)."

I happen to think too many Star Wars movies would cheapen their impact.  Just because you agree with something doesn't mean they're thinking for you. The prequels are boring and stupid and look like cartoons. The Plinkett reviews are just an entertaining medium for conveying how and why.

StarWarsLeaks,3dt436,TzuWu,-2,Mon Jul 20 13:47:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly speaking, I've never understood the logic behind people who think like this. People asked for years upon years for new material. All Lucas would give us were tainted re-do's of the movies we already loved. Most of us fans want new movies, not nostalgia of movies that we love but are 40 years old or close. ""Over-saturated and boring"", well I'd rather have a slew of new movies than the way Lucas treated us over the years. Saying Disney has no self-control is also a little naive. I'd say most fans love what Disney has done with the Marvel Universe since the first Iron Man came out. I will ask this, if Disney makes new movies in the Star Wars universe that aren't all based on the same characters,events and timelines...how does it become ""over-saturated""? I know they didn't spend 4 billion dollars to make 3 movies a decade."
StarWarsLeaks,3dt436,kingfagit,2,Sun Jul 19 18:09:40 2015 UTC,"It's like Silent Hill. Once western developers got a hold of it, they gave it new characters, but they kept copying the story of Silent Hill 2 (badly). You can only play the same story so many times before you grow completely tired of it all and it starts to feel cheap. Or another example, TF2. I loved that game. Then they kept adding hats and user created weapons, and slowly but surely it started to lose the aesthetic and style I loved it for in the first place. When I try playing today I have no idea who's using what, what does what, it's just a confusing mess of a game now."

Most of us that aren't uber fanboys just want new material. Dont get me wrong I fashion myself as a pseudo fan boy but come on guys, let's not damn the material before its even here. Also I think anthologies are the way to go after the sequel trilogy. I say that because it's easier for them not to focus on one big storyline and be able to give us stand alone content, as to not get ""over-saturated"" with the same characters and punch lines."

It's obvious that all the parties have an interest in preserving and extending the legacy. The anthology film premise allows them to make infinite SW universe movies...And having planned a few to film simultaneously with the sequels, it's hard to imagine a reason for them to stop. They have mastered quality control -- it remains to be seen if they master SW...  However, I think it would be wise for Disney/Kennedy to end the Skywalker story with 9 films, since that was the long-planned Lucas vision (even if it's not the same vision). Then, in order to milk the franchise, Disney can plan a new trilogy, or even a new 9-film saga, that deals with another legacy/era.  Another possibility is that they debauch the whole thing, and that the sequels and anthologies end up oversaturating and boring us, and that it's all a giant repeat (or amplification) of the prequel affair. Then there might be a long pause before another explosion of SW enthusiasm."

Realistically I hope they wait at least 7-10 years between them. Star Wars has always been a generational event and here's hoping Disney understands this and only makes Anthology films for the time being.
StarWarsLeaks,3dt436,TzuWu,-4,Sun Jul 19 15:36:51 2015 UTC,"7-10 years, give me a break. The only reason it's been a generation thing is because George Lucas is a putz. If it were up to him we'd still be getting ""new"" versions of the OT. I don't think many people realize how much fans hated Lucas over the years for him being so reluctant to give actual new material."
StarWarsLeaks,3dt436,Throwawayfortheghost,2,Sun Jul 19 12:08:52 2015 UTC,I think the execs at Disney are smarter than that.

With 6 new films coming out in the next 6 years we're getting more Star Wars than we have in the past 30 years. I mean look at Star Trek. There's like a couple dozen movies like 4 or 5 TV shows and personally I find it hard to get into. Star Wars is special because of the limited amount of movies. It's become this special generational event that people look forward to. What I don't want is 2 trilogies within 10 years of each other.
StarWarsLeaks,3dt436,TzuWu,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:46:36 2015 UTC,"Had anybody else made Star Wars besides Lucas, we'd have a ton more material. Like I've said in previous posts, Lucas milked the crap out of fans who wanted new material with re-do's of the OT and then laid out the PT movies which most people agree with were big disappointments. I'm not a fan of it being ""generational content"". I find that term to be an excuse for how Lucas treated the fanbase over the years.I applaud Disney for what they are doing."
StarWarsLeaks,3dt436,Killzark,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:55:02 2015 UTC,Just wait. When Star Wars becomes over saturated and doesn't feel like a special event after 12 years of constant movies being churned out you'll understand. These next 6 years are going to be great but I'm afraid it will turn out like Marvel is starting to turn out. They'll have a couple good ones every once in a while but most will feel like movies being made for the sake of making more movies.

StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,Mr_Otters,25,Sun Jul 19 22:50:55 2015 UTC,"""I'll break it down into plot devices by act.  Act 1  Poe is trying to incite a rebellion in Jakku against the First Order, who recently took over the system. A gang member sells him out and he is captured. The village he was trying to train is slaughtered like animals and when Finn doesn't partake Kylo Ren, who is parading around saying he's Luke Skywalker, butchers his close friend and has Finn detained.  Rey is trying desperately to leave Jakku, she's scavenging wrecks trying to find parts to restore the Millennium Falcon.  Finn inadvertently uses the Force to break out and helps Poe escape. They steal a TIE fighter, but it's shot down. Poe ejects before the crash, Finn is stuck in the TIE. Rey finds Finn and BB8 and the last parts she needs. Finn tells Rey he will pay her to take him off Jakku. Kylo Ren is informed Finn used the Force to escape. The Falcon finally starts up after Rey hits it.  Captain Phasma leads a group of TIE fighters after the Falcon.  The General tells Kylo Ren they can't wait any longer and that ""He"" wants them to fire the weapon.  Jakku's star is destroyed as the Falcon jumps to lights from previous coordinates.  Act 2  The Falcon comes out of hyperspace at Yavin. Fighters escort the Falcon down where Han and Chewie board anxiously as both thought the Falcon lost forever. Rey is searched and a lightsaber is found in her possession. Rey and Finn are taken to Maz, a local Jedi, to be determined as either light or darkside.  Maz senses the darkside in them, and ignites the lightsaber before saying in horror ""it was his..."" She uses the force to see how Rey found the lightsaber and determines it found her ""for a terrible reason"" and explains that only one person ever wielded it and didn't use it to commit atrocities.  This prompts Finn to speak up about who he thinks is Luke Skywalker leading the First Order and Maz decides to take them to Leia. The First Order is alerted that the First lightsaber of Darth Vader has been ignited after years of inactivity. Kylo retreats to a private area to speak with his master and tells him he believes they are after two force sensitive with Vader's first lightsaber. His master tells him to be mindful, that there is unbalanced in the Force and that something larger may be at play. Kylo orders an attack on Yavin to retrieve Finn and Rey. Maz presents Leia with the lightsaber, and Poe steps forward and defends Finn while nearly being knocked over by BB8. Finn is questioned about the First Order. He describes their Super Weapon and a secret base which is not yet complete and may be vulnerable to attack. Han tells Leia he still does not trust them because they had his ship and Chewie echoes this sentiment.  Alarms go off and Threepio alerts people a Star Destroyer has just come out of hyperspace. Poe leads an X Wing squadron against the TIE's and Han asks Chewie if he's up for another run. He then tells Rey and Finn they might as well make themselves useful.  They fight off the squadron and the First Order appears to retreat. Later that night though, Rey is captured and the temple/base is destroyed.  Han, Poe, Finn, Leia, Chewie, and Artoo all agree to rescue Rey and destroy the base, and hope to confront Luke and try to talk some sense into him (remember, we know it's Kylo Ren, the characters do not)  Act 3  Ren questions Rey about who she is, who her parents are, etc...  Rey doesn't know. She even tells him she doesn't have a last name.  He tells her he can feel the force is strong with her, and that she need not fear it.  He's interrupted and told that Resistance fighters are approaching.  There is a massive battle, but the base is more operational than originally believed. Han finds Kylo (who he believes to be Luke) and tries to talk to him. Kylo ends the conversation pretty quickly and has Han detained.  Republic Forces show up less by Ackbar, officially making this skirmish the First battle of a new Civil War. As the battle turns in the Resistance's favor, now aided by the Republic, General Hux activates an EMP like weapon that knocks every ship out of the sky and makes an escape. Rey notices an X Wing still in the air with colors and markings she'd never seen.  As she and Finn make a run for it, Kylo stops them. Finn tries to fight him and loses an arm. Rey holds her own, but Kylo uses the force to seize her throat and lift her in the air. Rey sees his thoughts in this moment. When he was young, his village was attacked, and his baby sister taken from him by a man with a robotic arm.  Kylo is aware Rey can see his thoughts and says ""Kira..."" Kylo is knocked to his feet by a hooded man with a green lightsaber. He engages him in a duel but is outmatched and flees.  Han is freed but badly injured.  Rey takes the Falcon away again to an isolated moon where Luke tries to talk to her, but she wants to be left alone. She insists.  Finn gets a robotic arm and Luke tells him he will train him.  The Republic is aware of the power of the First Order and will no longer take them lightly.  Word that the real Luke Skywalker has returned is spreading throughout systems threatened by the First Order. Rey builds a lightsaber.  Kylo Ren visits his master to face discipline for failing. Luke, a banged up Han, and Leia, look out of a bay at the Stars.  The reunion is sweet, and victory is theirs this day, but war has returned to the galaxy far far away...."""

StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,SuperRezzy,2,Sun Jul 19 16:46:56 2015 UTC,Ahh I missed that latter bit.  Sorry bout that.
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,Sempere,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:57:58 2015 UTC,"I thought that Terminator Salvation changed the ending of the movie last minute because of negative reaction to a leak. I'm not positive, but that's what I remember hearing just before it came out."
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,suction,2,Mon Jul 20 00:30:08 2015 UTC,"Kinda - there was a leak of the ending, a variation of what happened in that shitty gensys movie - and they scrambled to rewrite the end of the film along with changes to the script to add in Christian bale's john Connor as more than just a cameo. But I'm talking about the book release - they included a false ending to that and said ""for the alternate ending (I.e. The movie's ending) enter the book code on our website to read how it ends!"""
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,wbhokie,5,Mon Jul 20 16:24:21 2015 UTC,"I like this. NO EU - style bullcrap whatsoever, makes sense from a movie-maker standpoint, no magic crystals or overdone twists, basically nothing the bottom dwellers who frequent this sub would like to see. I have no idea if this is fake or not but then again I can wait all the time in the world..."
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,Palpadean,4,Sat Jul 18 20:45:18 2015 UTC,"I also like this and it still provides ""hope"" to those who wish to still see the ""Jacen and Jaina"" children/twins idea without actually denying that Rey and Ren could be Solos. Even if this is simply a fake, it's still a decent story line that throws together aspects that we know/think are true leaks.  edit: I for one hope that Rey builds a double bladed lightsaber or a lightsaber staff (single blade)."
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,SuperRezzy,5,Sat Jul 18 20:59:45 2015 UTC,"I like this story idea a lot. It doesn't make anyone a kid of the original characters but keeps them linked. Kylo and Rey have an interesting dynamic and Finn seems to be starting his ""Hero journey"". This is simple and beautiful story-telling. I sincerely hope this is the plot and it doesn't rely on some stupid story about a lightsaber crystal or an old Sith Lord.  The story here seems to also suggest the First Order aren't quite the old Empire either. Something new is a very good thing."
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,ampoliros_applecrow,0,Sat Jul 18 21:32:49 2015 UTC,"This story also sets up a potential plot that I really want to see: a redemption story.  I kind of look at the Star Wars trilogies like this:  Prequels: Good guy is corrupted and succumbs to evil. Meanwhile, relatively peaceful galaxy is corrupted and succumbs to evil.  Original Trilogy: Good guy faces off against evil and prevails. Meanwhile, oppressed galaxy faces off against evil and prevails.  Sequel Trilogy (What I hope to see): Bad guy (Kylo Ren) is evil but redeems himself. Meanwhile, galaxy in chaos is finely brought back to peace.  We got the good guy becomes bad guy story. We got the good guy beats bad guy story. I think the best way to close off this trilogy of trilogies is to show a bad guy redeeming himself, which kind of ends things on an optimistic note."
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,SuperRezzy,4,Mon Jul 20 00:37:42 2015 UTC,"OT is the redemption of Vader.  He kills Palpatine to save Luke, not to take the Emperor's place."
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,wbhokie,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:45:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the redemption of Vader really seemed like an afterthought - there was no set up, the rest of the trilogy didn't build toward it. It was more of a story about Luke overcoming great evil."
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,EErrant,-3,Mon Jul 20 22:18:11 2015 UTC,"I still hold onto the hope that the old Sith still have it in for the galaxy and that plagueis may still be relevant plot wise, but I'd be fine ditching that for a well developed and original story."

StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,Aequitassb,5,Sun Jul 19 09:32:29 2015 UTC,So... he read the book yet has NO new character information or plot details than have already been speculated? I call bullshit. THOUGH i love the story idea.

StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,saskatchewan_kenobi,35,Sat Jul 18 19:34:18 2015 UTC,"Also notice how he has no new character names or anything. If you actually read the novelization of TFA the first thing you'd do would be to name and describe all the characters who haven't leaked yet.  This is just another fan fiction posing as a ""leak.""  EDIT: He doesn't even use the newest leaked names from the lego sets, not to mention Supreme Leader Snoke, lol."
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,altgr_01,11,Sat Jul 18 20:12:10 2015 UTC,And every plot point seems like a generalization from leaks the BTS clip. Rule of thumb for seeing if a synopsis is bullshit is looking at the third act and seeing how vague it is. It's always a tell.
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,Danny7618,3,Sat Jul 18 20:21:06 2015 UTC,Yeah and nobody still knows how poe goes from the tie fighter to later being in an xwing on a different planet...
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,WildPackOfWolves,-1,Sat Jul 18 22:25:14 2015 UTC,He claims that the leader at Jakku is called Tiraga. So if this turns out to be false we can safely dismiss the whole thing.

StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,Jitan,6,Sun Jul 19 04:35:34 2015 UTC,"Interesting read, creative. But I don't see it panning out that way. Let alone someone being able to get a copy this early."
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,yellownotebook,3,Sat Jul 18 20:05:02 2015 UTC,Ya know......  The Skywalker thing is not tjat far a stretch being as there was previous rumor that Ren was posing as Vader.....
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,AssDann,3,Sat Jul 18 23:19:05 2015 UTC,Main issue I have with this is if Kylo Ren is pretending to be Luke then you'd think they'd want the audience to think maybe it is Luke and Luke is evil now. But considering they've been talking about Kylo Ren since the second teaser that doesn't seem to be the case. Also someone posted an outline similar to this earlier this year but spent more time on Kylo and Rey belonging to a group attacked by Luke. I suspect this is the same guy making up nonsense.
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,HenryChinaskiForPrez,3,Sun Jul 19 03:15:59 2015 UTC,"Even if it is bullshit, it was an enjoyable read. I would be pretty happy with this.   Too many throw backs to OT for it to be legit though - a planet destroyed by a super weapon, an arm cut off, etc. It's like OT nostalgia from three movies forced into one."
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,sdesaulniers,11,Sun Jul 19 07:09:20 2015 UTC,LOL this is some fucking horseshit
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,HenryChinaskiForPrez,4,Sat Jul 18 19:52:52 2015 UTC,"It's not bad fanfic, but that's all I think it is. OP lost me at Maz. Also not nearly enough happens in the third act.   EDIT: This was a fun one, though."
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,WildPackOfWolves,3,Sun Jul 19 01:13:23 2015 UTC,"It's pretty solid, yeah. The thing that makes me think it's fake is the lack of any mention of the Kanjiklub Gang or whatever the Unkar are. I would've expected to hear something about them, especially with the recent Lego set leaks."
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,robobot,11,Sun Jul 19 02:17:25 2015 UTC,The idea that motherfuckers can track when an individual lightsaber ignites would also be a really weird addition to the technological canon.
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,sdesaulniers,2,Sun Jul 19 03:50:27 2015 UTC,I seem to remember that spoilerman had said something like that during his 4chan leaks. Something along the lines of Gwendoline Christie's character was an inquisitor and could sense through the force about it being ignited on Jakku.
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,Teletoa,3,Sun Jul 19 04:31:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's real either, but, pretending it is, I would actually be really surprised if the Kanjiklub Gang or Unkar were mentioned. I have a feeling that those characters are going to play a very small part in the film and wouldn't be worth mentioning in any kind of synopsis.   If you were giving someone a rundown of ROTJ, you probably wouldn't mention the Max Reebo Band. I think the Kanjiklub Gang is probably going to be similar in that they might not even be mentioned by name in the film, but their name as it appears in the script/novelization will be used for merchandising.  But yeah... this was a nice read, but probably fake."
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,ChetSteadman2274,2,Mon Jul 20 04:19:43 2015 UTC,"I think you're probably right, but if I was in the position of having read the novel I think I'd at least shed some light on what their role is. All it really takes is a passing comment, but I suppose if their significance is that of the Max Reebo Band it would be very easy to overlook."
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,FlamingForFame,7,Mon Jul 20 05:03:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't think I'll need a salt shaker for this one.  It sounds like just another guy with a leg-pulling infatuation. Thanks for posting the story though!"
StarWarsLeaks,3drikx,sdesaulniers,7,Sat Jul 18 19:47:06 2015 UTC,"Don't buy it. The general plot seems passable, but no actual spoilers are really given. Why was Luke in hiding? What is the actual 'twist' he was talking about? Plus the synopsis he gave us doesn't really have an end. And a lot of people already assume that Kylo and Rey are siblings, I couldn't imagine them using that as a big twist since we just got introduced to them and a lot of the audience would see it coming a mile away.  I always take these ""leaks"" with a huge grain of salt, but also keep in mind that they may be right (however small the chance is). I remember a few years ago reading a leaked synopsis of The Dark Knight Rises before the film was out and thinking how ridiculous ending the movie at a cafe in Italy sounded. I was floored when I actually saw the movie and Alfred mentioned the cafe like 20 minutes into the movie."

No way Poe Dameron jumps out of hyperspace, has a nice chat with General Hux in a Star Destroyer, makes it all the way to Jakku's surface before Hux orders Storm Troopers after him, is captured and brought back onto General Hux's Star Destroyer, escapes and ends up on Jakku once more.

Not only has it become more powerful, but it has become more potent, manifesting itself in many people, even those who didn't have the ability before. The Force in the Sequel Trilogy will be mysterious to even the Jedi, as its effects and power will surpass anything we have ever seen in the previous films. This awakening of the Force will cause both its aspects to grow stronger, and thus not only bring new heroes into the galaxy, but villains as well.   ""The Dark Side... and the Light."""

As in after you see the movie you'll be able to conclude what the purpose of the title is.  After you saw Episode V you could conclude why they named it they way they did.  No one in the movie needed to say ""oh gosh...the empire is striking back!"""
StarWarsLeaks,3dsaj4,Jitan,23,Sun Jul 19 15:56:10 2015 UTC,"Snoke's erection.  But really Kasdan was the one who really fleshed out the force in Empire so it could be a lot of things. I imagine it will be an attempt to ""remystify"" it away from the midichlorian stuff in Episode 1 or something and in the context of Anakin being the chosen one."
StarWarsLeaks,3dsaj4,njeske,4,Sun Jul 19 00:06:04 2015 UTC,"I would like that. I've always wondered if they were wrong about the prophecy. Maybe Luke was the chosen one. But technically Vader did kill Palpatine, although I don't think that necessarily brought balance to the force."
StarWarsLeaks,3dsaj4,TheDugat,7,Sun Jul 19 00:49:26 2015 UTC,"I think Anakin was the chosen one but the Jedi didn't really know what it means. I know Lucas says bringing balance to the force is ending the sith but that seems to just be his attempt at wrapping up the story when he was saying he didn't want to make any more. Because if that's the case then Yoda saying the prophecy might be misinterpreted is meaningless. I think people also get hung up on the idea that Vader reduced the Jedi to 2 and the Sith only had 2. But really what Vadar did was destroy both the Jedi and the Sith. The Jedi will basically never exist like they did before. I mean think about it, Luke wasn't really trained to be a Jedi but to kill Vader. Almost like Obi-wan and Yoda were training him for revenge. He was the one who decided he was going to turn Vader. And then of course when Vader kills the Emperor and indirectly himself he destroyed the majority of knowledge about the Sith."
StarWarsLeaks,3dsaj4,ReverendY,11,Sun Jul 19 03:22:27 2015 UTC,"I've always thought that, as Yoda says in Episode 3, perhaps the prophecy was misinterpreted.  Anakin could very well be the balance to the Force.  Before Anakin becomes Vader, there were a ton of Jedi, and only a few Sith.  After his turn to the dark side, the balance is just two Jedi (Yoda, Obi Wan) and two Sith (Sidious, Vader) left.  Pretty balanced if you ask me."

StarWarsLeaks,3dsaj4,Gamefreak975,9,Sun Jul 19 02:54:59 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, Lucas always said that balance was achieved by removing the dark side. The dark side is like a cancer.

StarWarsLeaks,3dsaj4,Nerfman2227,2,Sun Jul 19 03:18:13 2015 UTC,"I still think that burning down the old at least mildly corrupt super soldier ""Jedi Order"" was at least to some degree a good thing, at the very least leading the Jedi back towards that old sense of mysticism.

StarWarsLeaks,3dsaj4,merica1991,5,Sun Jul 19 01:25:31 2015 UTC,"Well, Star Wars is a science fantasy, and midichlorians are totally a sci-fi kind of addition to the mythology. They took the mystical and seemingly higher-power-selected Jedi, whose strength comes from their soul and will, and turned them into random people with a high concentration of some microbes. It's thematically and tonally out-of-sync with the Star Wars universe."
StarWarsLeaks,3dsaj4,ThePhonze,3,Sun Jul 19 04:00:03 2015 UTC,"Eh, what is and isnt tonally acceptable for Star Wars is subjective.   Its almost a reverse of the development of religion in our world. Back in the day, people used to believe that rain to benefit their crops came about as a result of their devotion to a pantheon of gods. Now we know better than that.  If you liken that to Star Wars, only in reverse, you have a situation where science was the basis and now (because the science has disappeared) people believe it is a magical and all controlling spirit.  Maybe there is a magical pantheon of gods controlling the weather in our world, maybe there isnt. Maybe there are midichlorians controlling force sensitivity, maybe there aren't. Star Wars is always what you choose to believe.  Take the spiritual path or the scientific one. Just like our world today."
StarWarsLeaks,3dsaj4,SickBurnBro,-3,Sun Jul 19 04:06:03 2015 UTC,"The problem is the holiday special isn't canon. Episode 1 is. I've been hoping for a disney definitive cut of the saga that takes out all the bullshit, and uses it as a final version for established canon."
StarWarsLeaks,3dsaj4,TrotterSnout,0,Sun Jul 19 01:26:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, the only canon that matters is our head-canon. But I see your point. Interestingly, I feel like I could spin midichlorians as a statement by the movie about science versus faith. Qui-Gon was sold because of the MCs (science) and everyone who was hesitant (Obi-Wan at first, the council) did so on faith.   Although that would absolutely be some lit class bullshittery."
StarWarsLeaks,3dsaj4,niggaitwastimefoanu1,2,Sun Jul 19 03:54:59 2015 UTC,Short answer? No idea.  Long answer? I have no idea.
StarWarsLeaks,3dsaj4,ThatPersonGu,3,Mon Jul 20 03:35:01 2015 UTC,Maybe a combination of things.  Luke apparently has been hiding for years and shows up at the end of the movie so it can refer to him.  Also about Rey and her reluctance to accept her destiny till the end of the film during her fight with Kylo Ren.
StarWarsLeaks,3dsaj4,Samuraistronaut,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:05:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this seems likely. It's not a literal awakening, but rather a metaphor for the 'awakening' of the franchise, the return of Luke, and Rey's acceptance of her destiny."
StarWarsLeaks,3dsaj4,TzuWu,2,Sun Jul 19 07:03:13 2015 UTC,"I have no idea and none of the leaks really address it. Based on the first trailer, my assumption has always been that it means that there is now a new generation of force users coming into their powers (Rey, Finn, Kylo), but I have no real basis for that."
StarWarsLeaks,3dsaj4,RealVoltar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:18:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think that line from the first teaser is spoken together at all.  I think it's cut from totally different parts of the film.  I'm in the party that believes the title doesn't refer to THE force, but rather a force, awakening.

There is some speculation that he has went into hiding.   Add in the grave robber theory and we can assume that the grave robber unearthes something that creates a shockwave awakening many force users at once (this is where Finn comes in from what I understand.) Finn suddenly has more empathy and hears the subtle voice of the force and decides that life with the First order just isnt for him..  thats just my interpretation of clues, I have no knowledge of what happens of course."
StarWarsLeaks,3dsaj4,wp4815162342,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:44:05 2015 UTC,"There definitely hasn't been any credible information to suggest what the title means. My personal theory would be that as we see at the end of ROTJ, the Sith are gone, and Luke is the last of the Jedi. Maybe at some point after this, Luke decides that the galaxy is best left without Jedi or Sith, and goes into exile. I imagine perhaps the awakening refers to the fact that Kylo Ren, through the use of Jedi and Sith artifacts, finds a way to train himself to use the force. This draws out some force users, perhaps even Luke, to fight him."

StarWarsLeaks,3dnvb5,DoogsATX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:54:21 2015 UTC,We have the beats of the scenes but not the details or dialogue. Plus it is filtered through sources and MSW reporting on that. I imagine it'd be a lot smoother once we get a fuller picture.
StarWarsLeaks,3dnvb5,gormo2,9,Sat Jul 18 03:03:23 2015 UTC,"What the heck does Finn tell Rey that has her teaming up with him to leave her home-planet and everything she knows within 5 minutes of meeting him?  He doesn't even defend her from ""junkyard bullies"" in this version of MSW's story. He just shows up, says something, and off they go.  I'd originally thought that maybe he promised her a reward if she helped him get BB-8 to the Resistance, but in this version of MSW's account she isn't even willing to sell BB, so she doesn't seem very mercenary...  Is she really doing all this for a droid she's known for one day and a man she's known for one minute?"
StarWarsLeaks,3dnvb5,flourykettle,4,Fri Jul 17 22:12:50 2015 UTC,I think she is forced into leaving after the stoomtroopers start hunting her down.  Plus deep down she might want to leave the plant.
StarWarsLeaks,3dnvb5,ThePhonze,5,Fri Jul 17 22:55:37 2015 UTC,"But the only reason she was in danger to begin with was because she was with BB and Finn, both of whom were already being hunted. She could have ditched them both and then the stormtroopers would have had no reason to go after her.  It's one thing for her to not want to sell the droid to the junk dealer, it's another thing for her to decide to risk her life to keep him out of the hands of the First Order. Not to mention that she didn't have to let Finn come with.  Finn must have told her something really convincing really fast. The question is: What was it?"
StarWarsLeaks,3dnvb5,flourykettle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:57:56 2015 UTC,"I dont think she has an option once the troops start shooting at her once they see her with the droid they want.

Calling ships ""Star Destroyers"" is similar to how the British Navy in the 18th Century built ""Dreadnaughts"", the name itself meant that it fears nothing. Dread - naught.  Star Destroyers are obviously not capable of destroying a whole Star but the name itself is easy to remember and enough to give a preset imagine in someones mind. Same with ""Starkiller Base"". JJ said at Comic-Con it was just as a reference to Lukes original name but I think it has more meaning than that, not that the base will literally kill stars but that it is, at least as my working theory right now, some kind of base of operations on the Snow Planet."

I'm glad we're getting a new trilogy, and the idea of anthology films seems cool, but I hope they keep it somewhat contained. Multiple trilogies and spin-offs will just water down any significance of victory the characters earn. Even the destruction of the second Death Star has become less significant than originally thought.  I know we're laying a foundation for a trilogy but I really hope TFA can stand on its own.

I expect to be seeing Star Wars movies being released for at least the next 10-15 years. I think the quality of each movie will vary, but there will be greatness is there as well. I'm excited about the prospect of getting so much more Star Wars in my life, but at the same time I understand the apprehension of Disney milking the cow dry. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter what we feel though. The deal is done, Disney owns Star Wars, and they will make movies until it doesn't make money anymore."

It's an endless cycle and it makes the whole experience exhausting.  If JJ and KK were honest in their belief that Wars is a story and not an IP, then they won't let it be like that. Ep 9 should put a neat bow on the entire saga and leave it at that.  Any more sequels should be spinoffs or completely different stories from the Skywalker Saga."

As his control over Star Wars increased, he found a way to bring it back via Unleashing the Force with Galen Marek.  Interesting how I see that word coming back into the fold.

StarWarsLeaks,3dm39q,BewareTheKraken,4,Sat Jul 18 14:54:52 2015 UTC,So far in the storyline I am a smuggler working for an underworld character named Happy. The banter between characters is quite funny and feels Star Wars-y  I am essentially paying off a debt by doing some contraband pick up missions for him along with my sister.  Gameplay is like Diablo with random loot chests dropping at the end of each mission to upgrade your character.  The game is free to play meaning you can play right away without buying it. There is however a shop where you can buy additional chests and credits etc. So far though I dont feel its necessary to pay.   Im going to continue to play it because it is actually quite good!!    Ill keep the thread updated or perhaps even post my own.

This is marketing 101, you don't market yourself to the people who are guaranteed to buy the product- you put effort into those on the fence in hopes that they'll spend their money and time here, not there. Those people waiting in Hall H could have spent their time and money browsing the rest of the con, or not at the con at all.

With all of the possibilities for species, coloration, etc.- why make it ambiguous as to whether or not its Barriss?  Its unclear at the end of TCW what happens to her, she's an established nemesis of Ahsoka, and it would be the perfect amount of super-fan service, without having to go see TCW to understand that she's a menacing villain.  I mentioned this on another forum, but in the GFFA, they have vats of magic healing liquid, super weapons that can blow up entire planets, certain people that can interact with mystical energy fields to control their environment and people around them, and long term space vessels that travel faster than light.  I'm guessing tattoo removal is probably not an issue.    Also worth noting that while not cannon, TOR video game suggests that the Mirialan species tattoo their faces based on different life events.  This seems to suggest that they alter the facial markings based on life changes, which would fit in here.  Plus, they'd want to update the character design anyway.  ETA- She's in prison as of the end of TCW.  The Empire takes over shortly thereafter.  Totally plausible that they'd go to her and any other Force sensitive in custody and be like 'turn to the dark side or get capped'.  Dark Side it is!!"

This never stopped me from loving the movies, and in some ways I think it almost made them more enjoyable. In my opinion what makes a star wars movie is not within simply having a good story, or good visuals, but representing a universe in such a way that you never ever get tired of seeing the movie again.

To me, this has become part of the fun - checking a rotation of websites for anything I can get about the new Star Wars movie. The two or three years before each Star Wars movie is just as much a part of the experience for me as seeing the actual movie itself.  But you know what? It didn't ruin the last two movies for me and I don't think it's going to ruin this one either.

Nowadays, I'm more laid back about it and I'm only tangentially interested in leaks. What changed? I got some tangible glimpses at the direction this film is going in the form of the teasers and some major leaks (Abu Dhabi last summer and the concept art last fall).

StarWarsLeaks,3dh342,pufferpig,10,Thu Jul 16 18:47:22 2015 UTC,"Excerpt posted here for convenience:    Now:  Starlines streak across the bright black.  A ship drops out of hyperspace: a little Starhopper. A one-person ship. Favored by many of the less desirable factions out here in the Outer Rim—the pirates, the bookies, the bounty hunters and those with bounties on their heads to hunt. This particular ship has seen action: plasma scarring across the wings and up its tail fins; a crumpled dent in the front end as if it was kicked by an AT-AT Imperial walker. All the better for the ship to blend in.  Ahead: the planet Akiva. A small planet—from here, striations of brown and green. Thick white clouds swirling over its surface.  The pilot, Wedge Antilles, once Red Leader and now—well, now something else, a role without a formal title, as yet, because things are so new, so different, so wildly up in the air—sits there and takes a moment.  It’s nice up here. Quiet.  No TIE fighters. No blasts across the bow of his X-wing. No X-wing, in fact, and though he loves flying one, it’s nice to be out. No Death Star—and here, Wedge shudders, because he helped take down two of those things. Some days that fills him with pride. Other days it’s something else, something worse. Like he’s drawn back to it. The fight still going on all around him. But that isn’t today.  Today, it’s quiet.  Wedge likes the quiet.  He pulls up his datapad. Scrolls through the list with a tap of the button on the side. (He has to hit it a few extra times just to get it to go—if there’s one thing he looks forward to when all this is over, it’s that maybe they’ll start to get new tech. Somehow, this datapad had actual sand in it, and that’s why the buttons stick.) The list of planets clicks past.  He’s been to, let’s see, five so far. Florrum. Ryloth. Hinari. Abafar. Raydonia. This planet, Akiva, is the sixth on the list of many, too many.  It was his idea, this run. Somehow, the remaining factions of the Empire are still fueling their war effort even months after the destruction of their second battle station. Wedge had the notion that they must’ve moved out to the Outer Rim—study your history and it’s easy to see that the seeds of the Empire grew first out here, away from the Core systems, away from the prying eyes of the Republic.  Wedge told Ackbar, Mon Mothma: “Could be that’s where they are again. Hiding out there.” Ackbar said that it made some sense. After all, didn’t Mustafar hold some importance to the Imperial leadership? Rumors said that’s where Vader took some of the Jedi long ago. Torturing them for information before their execution.  And now Vader’s gone. Palpatine, too.  Almost there, Wedge thinks—once they find the supply lines that are bolstering the Imperials, he’ll feel a whole lot better.  He pulls up the comm. Tries to open a channel to command and—  Nothing.  Maybe it’s broken. It’s an old ship.  Wedge fidgets at his side, pulls up the personal comm relay that hangs there at his belt—he taps the side of it, tries to get a signal.  Once more: nothing.  His heart drops into his belly. Feels a moment like he’s falling. Because what all of this adds up to is:  The signal’s blocked. Some of the criminal syndicates still operating out here have technology to do that locally—but in the space above the planet, no, no way. Only one group has that tech. His jaw tightens. The bad feeling in the well of his gut is swiftly justified, as ahead a Star Destroyer punctures space like a knife-tip as it drops out of hyperspace. Wedge fires up the engines. I have to get out of here.  A second Star Destroyer slides in next to the first.  The panels across the Starhopper’s dash begin blinking red.  They see him. What to do?  What did Han always say? Just fly casual. The ship is disguised as it is for a reason: It looks like it could belong to any two-bit smuggler out here on the fringe. Akiva’s a hotbed of criminal activity. Corrupt satrap governors. Various syndicates competing for resources and opportunities. A well-known black market—once, decades ago, the Trade Federation had a droid manufacturing facility here. Which means, if you want some off-the-books droid, you can come here to buy one. The Rebel Alliance procured many of its droids right here, as a matter of fact.  New dilemma, though: What now?  Fly down to the planet to do aerial recon, as was the original plan—or plot a course back to Chandrila? Something’s up. Two Star Destroyers appearing out of nowhere? Blocked comms? That’s not nothing. It means I’ve found what I’m looking for.  Maybe even something much better.  That means: Time to plot a course out of here.  That’ll take a few minutes, though—heading inward from the Outer Rim isn’t as easy as taking a long stride from here to there. It’s a dangerous jump. Endless variables await: nebula clouds, asteroid fields, floating bands of star-junk from various skirmishes and battles. Last thing Wedge wants to do is pilot around the edge of a black hole or through the center of a star going supernova.  The comm crackles.  They’re hailing him.  A crisp Imperial voice comes across the channel.  “This is the Star Destroyer Vigilance. You have entered Imperial space.” To which Wedge thinks: This isn’t Imperial space. What’s going on here? “Identify yourself.”  Fear lances through him, sharp and bright as an electric shock. This isn’t his realm. Talking. Lying. A scoundrel like Solo could convince a Jawa to buy a bag of sand. Wedge is a pilot. But it’s not like they didn’t plan for this. Calrissian worked on the story. He clears his throat, hits the button—  “This is Gev Hessan. Piloting an HH-87 Starhopper: the Rover.” He transmits his datacard. “Sending over credentials.”  A pause. “Identify the nature of your visit.”  “Light cargo.”  “What cargo?”  The stock answer is: droid components. But that may not fly here. He thinks quickly—Akiva. Hot. Wet. Mostly jungle. “Dehumidifier parts.”  Pause. An excruciating one.  The nav computer runs through its calculations.  Almost there . . .   A different voice comes through the tinny speaker. A woman’s voice. Got some steel in it. Less crisp. Nothing lilting. This is someone with some authority—or, at least, someone who thinks she possesses it.  She says, “Gev Hassan. Pilot number 45236. Devaronian. Yes?”  That checks out. Calrissian knows Hassan. The smuggler—sorry, “legitimate pilot and businessman”—did work smuggling goods to help Lando build Cloud City. And he is indeed Devaronian.  “You got it,” Wedge says.  Another pause.  The computer is almost done with its calculations. Another ten seconds at most. Numbers crunching, flickering on the screen . . .   “Funny,” the woman says. “Our records indicate that Gev Hassan died in Imperial custody. Please let us correct our records.”  The hyperspace computer finishes its calculations.  He pushes the thruster forward with the heel of his hand—  But the ship only shudders. Then the Starhopper trembles again, and begins to drift forward. Toward the pair of Star Destroyers. It means they’ve engaged the tractor beams.  He turns to the weapon controls.  If he’s going to get out of this, it’s now or never.  Admiral Rae Sloane stares down at the console and out the window. The black void. The white stars. Like pinpricks in a blanket. And out there, like a child’s toy on the blanket: a little long-range fighter.  “Scan them,” she says. Lieutenant Nils Tothwin looks up, offers her an obsequious smile.    (1/2)"
StarWarsLeaks,3dh342,RealVoltar,7,Thu Jul 16 05:38:23 2015 UTC,"“Of course,” he says, his jaundiced face tight with that grin. Tothwin is an emblem of what’s wrong with the Imperial forces now: Many of their best are gone. What’s left is, in part, the dregs. The leaves and twigs at the bottom of a cup of spice tea. Still, he does what he’s told, which is something—Sloane wonders when the Empire will truly begin to fracture. Forces doing what they want, when they want it. Chaos and anarchy. The moment that happens, the moment someone of some prominence breaks from the fold to go his own way, they are all truly doomed. Tothwin scans the Starhopper as the tractor beam brings it slowly, but inevitably, closer. The screen beneath him glimmers, and a holographic image of the ship rises before him, constructed as if by invisible hands. The image flashes red along the bottom. Nils, panic in his voice, says: “Hessan is charging his weapons systems.”  She scowls. “Calm down, Lieutenant. The weapons on a Starhopper aren’t enough to—” Wait. She squints. “Is that what I think it is?”  “What?” Tothwin asks. “I don’t—”  Her finger drifts to the front end of the holograph—circling the fighter’s broad, curved nose. “Here. Ordnance launcher. Proton torpedo.”  “But the Starhopper wouldn’t be equipped—oh. Oh.”  “Someone has come prepared for a fight.” She reaches down, flips on the comm again. “This is Admiral Rae Sloane. I see you there, little pilot. Readying a pair of torpedoes. Let me guess: You think a proton torpedo will disrupt our tractor beam long enough to afford you your escape. That may be accurate. But let me also remind you that we have enough ordnance on the Vigilance to turn you not only to scrap but rather, to a fine particulate matter. Like dust, cast across the dark. The timing doesn’t work. You’ll fire your torpedo. We’ll fire ours. Even if by the time your weapons strike us our beam is disengaged . . .” She clucks her tongue. “Well. If you feel you must try, then try.”  She tells Nils to target the Starhopper.  Just in case.  But she hopes the pilot is wise. Not some fool. Probably some rebel scout, some spy, which is foolish on its own—though less foolish now, with the newly built second Death Star destroyed like its predecessor.  All the more reason for her to remain vigilant, as the name of this ship suggests. The meeting on Akiva cannot misfire. It must take place. It must have a result. Everything feels on the edge, the entire Empire standing on the lip of the pit, the ledge crumbling away to scree and stone. The pressure is on. An almost literal pressure—like a fist pressing against her back, pushing the air out of her lungs.  Her chance to excel.  Her chance to change Imperial fortune.  Forget the old way.  Indeed.  Wedge winces, heart racing in his chest like an ion pulse. He knows she’s right. The timing doesn’t favor him. He’s a good pilot, maybe one of the best, but he doesn’t have the Force on his side. If Wedge launches those two torpedoes, they’ll give him everything they have. And then it won’t matter if he breaks free from the tractor beam. He won’t have but a second to get away from whatever fusillade they send his way.  Something is happening. Here, in the space above Akiva. Or maybe down there on the planet’s surface.  If he dies here—nobody will know what it is.  Which means he has to play this right.  He powers down the torpedoes.  He has another idea.  Docking Bay 42.  Rae Sloane stands in the glass-encased balcony, overlooking the gathered battalion of stormtroopers. This lot, like Nils, are imperfect. Those who received top marks at the Academy went on to serve on the Death Star, or on Vader’s command ship, the Executor. Half of them didn’t even complete the Academy—they were pulled out of training early.  These will do, though. For now. Ahead is the Starhopper—drifting in through the void of space, cradled by the invisible grip of the tractor beam. Down past the lineup of TIE fighters (half of what they need, a third of what she’d prefer), drifting slowly toward the gathered stormtroopers. They have the numbers. The Starhopper will have one pilot, most likely. Perhaps a second or third crewmember.  It drifts closer and closer.  She wonders: Who are you? Who is inside that little tin can?  Then: A bright flash and a shudder—the Starhopper suddenly glows blue from the nose end forward.  It explodes in a rain of fire and scrap.  “Whoever it was,” Lieutenant Tothwin says, “they did not wish to be discovered. I suppose they favored a quick way out.”  Sloane stands amid the smoldering wreckage of the long-range fighter. It stinks of ozone and fire. A pair of gleaming black astromechs whir, firing extinguishing foam to put out the last of the flames. They have to navigate around the half dozen or so stormtrooper bodies that lie about, still. Helmets cracked. Chest plates charred. Blaster rifles scattered and broken.  “Don’t be a naïve calf,” she says, scowling. “No, the pilot didn’t want to be discovered. But he’s still here. If he didn’t want us to blast him out of the sky out there, you really think he’d be eager to die in here?”  “Could be a suicide attack. Maximize the damage—”  “No. He’s here. And he can’t be far. Find him.”  Nils gives a sharp, nervous nod. “Yes, Admiral. Right away.”    (2/2)"

I'm actually excited to see authors coming at the star wars universe with different styles- it allows for a wider range of literature to exist within the canon.  Yeah, the conversational style sounds different than normal for a star wars book. But a lot of great books in the modern age are written that way. You get used to it within the first few pages.   Finally, this first bit of plot sounds like it's exactly what we ve been waiting for, and it's starting to draw the canon together. Bringing Sloane back is a start,  but this secret imperial meeting is obviously going to be hugely important and impactful.   If it is framed within the context of a character developing story, I'm fine with that. Star wars is more than just big plot developments. I personally fell in love because of the characters."

He's the first to say he was an unlikely choice to bridge the gap.   On the use of present tense, I don't see a problem. If we get slavish about only telling a story one way we take away creative options and creative stories about TheStarWars.  Anytime someone points out grammatical errors or punctuation I always want to ask them if they've ever read Chauser. English is a language whose rules are dictated by usage. If you understand what the English user says, then mission accomplished. The rules change over time. The only absolute rule is: don't let the language get in the way of the message.   All that aside, I like seeing Wedge out there in mufti and on a secret mission. I thought the canvas he is painting is solid and familiar without being repetitive. Wedge is believable as a guy more comfortable in a flight suit aboard an x wing. He does a good job of conveying that without letting it get in the way  I did not like the heavy reliance on Solo. And for a wild, lawless region I feel like the Outer Rim is some pretty well-trod ground.   Also if I'm an ex Imperial protecting secret supply routes I blast the fuck out of a ship that seems suspicious. It seems a little Kindergarten to 'bring him aboard for questioning.'"
StarWarsLeaks,3dh342,b_dills,3,Thu Jul 16 15:16:44 2015 UTC,"On the one hand I hate the writing style and wheel spinning plots of all the new cannon EU books, if you asked me what I liked about New Dawn yesterday I'd have had trouble saying much... But then on the other hand I was excited to have Sloan back in this, so I dunno.   It just is alarming because these authors (or the story group) are doing the opposite of what JJ said he specifically realized you couldn't - which is being content to just be IN the Star Wars universe,  tarkin and a new dawn are both flimsy and overly complicated all at once, and don't really add anything but character development....   I'm aware they can't push too hard given the pre-TFA spoilers period, etc. but I want signs the story group have their shit together and I've not seen any yet.   IMO The biggest problem with the prequels (aside from casting/acting/CGI/etc) was the disregard and twisting of the cannon as stated in the OT. The story group sounded like a great idea going forward for that reason, but I'm fearful after these books that they are going at it all willy nilly, or if they have an over-arching plan, that it might kind of suck."

StarWarsLeaks,3dh4p0,TheRevMrGreen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:52:21 2015 UTC,Have you ever played with legos?  The white guys are the yellow guys.  Except now.  Now the white guys are the yellow guys or the white guys.
StarWarsLeaks,3dh4p0,Kevlar_socks,3,Fri Jul 17 01:09:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I barely understood what you meant. And yes, I am familiar with lego. They started using the realistic flesh tones only for movies and licensed themes starting in 2004; for their regular lines of stuff, all minifigures are yellow, which is not supposed to be representative of any particular race despite many minifigs bearing caucasion features. And as for the movie figures, it seems that designers select whatever flesh tone is the most suitable-looking; you can observe that in the indiana jones lego sets, the chinese gangsters as well short round have the same flesh tone as the caucasian characters like Indy.  But really I think that the most likely reason is that the designers may have had only the concept art as reference for designing their sets, which may have such a character, but darker-skinned."
StarWarsLeaks,3dh4p0,TheRevMrGreen,2,Fri Jul 17 01:31:39 2015 UTC,You are probably correct.  I am just being goofy.

StarWarsLeaks,3djvcu,Deets327,0,Thu Jul 16 21:25:11 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer. There have been some rumors that they were together and are now separated.
StarWarsLeaks,3djvcu,gormo2,3,Thu Jul 16 22:33:41 2015 UTC,"Here's how it will go down: Han will feature with the new characters throughout the first half or 2/3 of the film. They will reunite with the Resistance/Leia in the second half of the film. Her and Han will have a private, bitter-sweet reunion, in which she laments him leaving several years earlier (they won't go into too much detail).   They will put aside their differences in a subsequent scene that involves several Resistance figures, Han, Leia, etc. planning some sort of military operation or defense. Han will agree to be part of the operation, somewhat to Leia's surprise. There will be a somewhat ominous mood and Han will give Leia a tender kiss (not as unbridled as in ESB, however) before leaving.  Han will essentially sacrifice himself during the battle, and possibly the Falcon as well (but not Chewie) in a final, heroic act that is pivotal to ensuring victory. This will be the climax of the film (along with Luke's reappearance)."
StarWarsLeaks,3djvcu,CJRLW,6,Fri Jul 17 13:46:15 2015 UTC,"No, but I hope they are married. It doesn't make sense for TPTB to break them up just so that we can watch them get together all over again. Or even worse, break them up so that the will-they-won't-they of the OT ends up feeling like just a big waste of time."
StarWarsLeaks,3djvcu,flourykettle,6,Thu Jul 16 21:30:30 2015 UTC,"I don't see why if they weren't together, why they would get back together 30 years later. I don't think they're together, I think they'll have a sweet moment before Han goes off and dies, though."
StarWarsLeaks,3djvcu,welshwordman,5,Thu Jul 16 21:43:14 2015 UTC,For me it would be like seeing my parents split up (ok not mine but you know an actual loving marriage). Maybe its cause i grew up reading the EU but the two of them has always been a constant and inevitability to me. And i can only see them changing it to either be different or to do what you said and create drama.
StarWarsLeaks,3djvcu,Deets327,4,Thu Jul 16 21:43:23 2015 UTC,"Their romance developed over unusual circumstances. They were constantly running for their lives during a war where they were both targets. They may very well have been in love, but it's the sort of love that occurs like lightning in a bottle. It's the excitement, the fear of each day being the last, and finding yourself looking to that person for comfort because it's not coming from anywhere else.  It's easy to see their romance fade - through no fault of their own - once Palpatine, Vader and the Death Star are out of the equation. And with the immediate and terrible threat being gone, seeing Han's only reason for sticking around with the rebellion (Leia) slipping away, it makes sense for him to slip back into his old lifestyle of jetting around the galaxy with Chewie.  I honestly think it's more poignant and powerful for Han to have moved on again after the Battle of Endor than for him to have settled down a Leia's side. It's just not who he is."

StarWarsLeaks,3djvcu,Throwawayfortheghost,3,Fri Jul 17 05:10:23 2015 UTC,"It would make sense if they didn't last. As two people from very different backgrounds brought together in a series of extreme crises, they never had the chance to get to know each other under normal circumstances. And Han is an easy going guy who joined the Alliance out of loyalty to his friends (and the cause, to some extent). Leia is a Type A personality to the extreme who probably puts her responsibilities ahead of her family - including Han. That doesn't sound like a very compatible couple for the long haul to me."
StarWarsLeaks,3djvcu,nobody2000,7,Fri Jul 17 11:24:43 2015 UTC,"My guess is that Han would come home from work, crack open a space beer, and laze around in the space recliner. Leia comes home from her diplomatic/senatorial duties, and is exhausted but is forced to take care of the kids, who are hungry after a long day at the Jedi Academy.   Sick of it, Leia calls her brother, and some of her friends from work. They all arrive and Luke uses the force to keep Han from getting violent in protest and she gathers her stuff and takes the kids.   Han, miserable now that he's lost everything, calls up Chewie. Chewie responds: ""Raarrhhhghghgharahhg"" [I'm too old for this shit] and Han gets his act together.   He joins a space-crossfit gym, and works hard for a year and fits back into his vest and pants with the cool stripe down the side. Ready to win Leia back, he stands in front of the Republic Senate with a boom box blasting some Max Rebo.   It works. They live happily ever after."

According to MSW, Gleeson is Luke's son (according to 4 sources, 3 very trusted), playing both sides to destroy both faction' superweapons, all in the name of greater good. According to MSW, Gleeson is not Luke's offspring after all, but possibly an evil Tarkin clone. According to MSW, the superweapon theory might be just that now, a simple theory without much weight (latest article, now that Jason knows Starkiller is just the name of the First Order base). According to MSW, Luke kills Han. According to MSW, Kylo Ren also kills Han. According to MSW, Han sacrifies himself. Which one is it? According to MSW, Kira is a Solo. According to MSW, Kira could also be a Skywalker. She could also be neither. According to MSW, the Vicar is a Resistance-friendly village elder, ""a beaten man."" According to MSW, the Vicar is ""no longer a man, he’s a cyborg."" According to MSW, The Force Awakens will open with Luke's light saber floating through space and falling to the ground shreds not to mention other opening acts, and so on.  See a pattern?"
StarWarsLeaks,3djvcu,bogaboy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:33:04 2015 UTC,"First of all, I straight up agree on him being a douche. I don't like the guy, and I never did. That said, I think he has insider information. How much? I can't say. He definitely has changed things constantly. I dont think he contradicts himself, but more changes his mind. I think a lot of that is due to him speculating way more than he should, and presenting that said speculation with stuff that he has been told, and clouding the lines between them. He also definitely has sources that are full of shit.   However I am also positive he has sources that are legitimate. He has leaked frames from the movie. He has leaked concept art that was later seen in full form in the Comic Con video. It's delusional to claim that he doesn't have at least one or two good sources. How much of what he says is right? 10%? 90%? That's up to you. I personally think that his current synopsis is around 75% or so. But he can't just guess up movie frames. He is by far the most reputable source, even if that doesn't mean a whole lot."
StarWarsLeaks,3djvcu,toph1980,2,Sat Jul 18 00:56:54 2015 UTC,"I too am positive he has some sources that are legitimate. I too have seen the leaks. I just dislike the fact both him and certain fanboys of his are out to make MSW the only legitimate source for everything The Force Awakens. And go on and twist facts as if MSW was/is right all the time. It's getting tiresome. We also don't know how much of it is misdirection from Disney/Lucasfilm.  Someone who deliberate makes up false leaks and anonymously pass them on to other SW sites as real, in an effort to bring down those sites and make your own site more popular, doesn't deserve this much attention. MSW does that and got outed on this very subreddit. People need to start understanding that MSW is doing everybody a disservice by doing such things. But yes, MSW have real sources too and some of their leaks are without a doubt true. But far from anything they post is genuine. A lot of it is guesswork."
StarWarsLeaks,3djvcu,bogaboy,2,Sat Jul 18 01:04:46 2015 UTC,"IMO, the best argument against MSW is him being part of Lucasfilm's disinformation campaign. And it sounds like we agree for the most part, except for maybe exactly how much is true. I don't treat everything MSW says as fact, and agree that it's possible a lot of what he says is wrong."

StarWarsLeaks,3djvcu,noodle-oodle-oodle-o,2,Fri Jul 17 05:07:07 2015 UTC,Yeah the only concrete fact I know is that my childhood will be ruined if they didn't stay together after ROTJ. Say what you will about George Lucas but he never would have split them up.

They're likely to be production code names for the same group of characters (or at least D & tIB are a one or the other of the rival mods and rockers gangs perhaps) with this Lego leak revealing the actual names used for the characters."

StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,CJRLW,19,Thu Jul 16 20:28:51 2015 UTC,"I will acctually drop the franchise and stick to the old EU if that happens. In my mind Han would never ever bail on Leia. And luke, Luke is the Grand Master of kicking ass not someone who hides out in a cave for thirty years while the galaxy burns."
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,roninjedi,2,Thu Jul 16 21:26:13 2015 UTC,Like the bad ass Obi Wan did?
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,Bit_and_byte,3,Fri Jul 17 22:41:27 2015 UTC,Obi-Wan hid out because the entire galaxy was hostile to jedi and he could do more good making sure luke survived than he could as a member of the nacent rebellion. And making luke do something like that would just be a silly repeat of story elements for the sake of nostalgia.
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,roninjedi,2,Fri Jul 17 22:50:40 2015 UTC,I agree that repeating that would be boring
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,Bit_and_byte,2,Sat Jul 18 00:53:56 2015 UTC,"and Luke's whole academy getting slaughtered, probably leaving him as the only jedi, isn't reason to go into hiding?"
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,wp4815162342,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:29:08 2015 UTC,First i don't think his academy being blown up would be a good plot point. It was how the last movie ended and would feel like a repeat. Yeah in the EU it got attacked a few times but that was after a lot of build up. And beyond that no. I can see him sulking for a while but then going back out there to try again.
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,roninjedi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:20:26 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what we think would be a ""good plot point"", the shot-list seems to be suggesting it happened.   Also I think you mean it's how the third movie ended? In canonical order of the films, Order 66 was decades before ROTJ and now TFA"
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,wp4815162342,-1,Mon Jul 20 07:56:19 2015 UTC,"There are many legitimate reasons that Han would separate from Leia and distance himself from Luke and the Alliance; I just believe they won't be related to ""Hey, I'm supposed to be a dashing rogue; let's go back to that"".  30 years is plenty of time for terrible things to happen to even the best of friendships or relationships.  As for Luke, once again, something significantly bad could have happened between ROTJ and TFA that would lead him to go into exile.  We'd regret seeing bad things happen to our heroes because we all want to believe the fairy-tale concept of ""they all lived happily ever after"" but even in the Star Wars universe, that concept just isn't feasible anymore."
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,Shatterhand1701,3,Fri Jul 17 12:50:35 2015 UTC,"I disagree, star wars is one of those fairytale places. It doesn't need to be dark and gritty. Its a place where the heroes are still good people, where their ate happy endings, and where good ultimately triumph over evil. Breaking them up would only undermine Hans character and make a lot of people angry."
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,roninjedi,-1,Fri Jul 17 13:30:11 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, but is that really true anymore?  Maybe it was that way for the Original Trilogy, but the Prequel Trilogy turned that idea on its head.  Putting aside the quality of the storytelling, the acting, etc., the Prequel Trilogy is truly an example of evil overcoming good, heroes turning into villains, and a fair share of sad endings.  I know the OT resolves just about all of that, but the PT's mere existence proves that the Star Wars universe isn't always a happy place where the good guys never lose or do bad things.  And if you think Han's separation from Leia would make a lot of people angry, I can only imagine the sheer rage that will ignite if the rumors of Han's death prove to be accurate.  I'm not worried about it so much from a storytelling perspective as I am from the concern that die-hard fans will piss all over J.J. Abrams for ""killing Han Solo"" when it's very possible the plot point could've been a mutual decision between Harrison Ford and J.J.  That won't make the loss of an iconic character hurt less, but at least we'd understand why it happens (if it does) and not assume J.J. did it for the sake of shocking drama."
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,Shatterhand1701,2,Fri Jul 17 17:10:21 2015 UTC,"See i disagree. I mean yeah the galaxy can get dark. Heck you sould see the Vong war and Legacy series for dark. But there is always the light and hope. And just because the real world is dark and just because shit happens and people break up dosen't mean it has to be that way in the movies. Whats wrong with having people fall in love and stay together, or a farmboy dreaming about being a hero and acctually being one. We or at least i still need those stories even if they aren't realistic. So no i think its a bad move to have them break up. Now if they want to do it like during the vong war where han went on a road trip for a while after loosing his two sons and chewie then fine but i think they should stay together. And trust me die hard fans will be pissed. If they make han and leia split up and turn luke into a scared hermit then i will dump this new EU and stick to the old one."
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,roninjedi,2,Fri Jul 17 17:31:26 2015 UTC,"There's nothing at all wrong with having people fall in love and stay together, or about a farmboy wanting to become a hero and achieving that goal against all odds.  I don't think there's one Star Wars fan among us who'd argue against those things, and our desire for heroism and true love against opposition in our own lives is just one of the things that fuels our love of Star Wars.  But that opposition exists to dent our heroes' armor, or worse, break through it and wound them physically or emotionally.  The hardships they face and work to overcome is what makes us root for them.  I'm not necessarily justifying the idea of having Han and Leia separated in The Force Awakens.  I'm not fond of the idea either, to be honest.  I just think it's important for people to understand that there are realistic and logical causes for them to separate, and that it's highly unlikely that Han would just ditch Leia to go back to living the smuggler's life.  He may still be rough around the edges despite the changes brought on by fighting with the Rebels and being with Leia, but I can't see him going back to that kind of life willfully.  As for Luke, we all know he's no coward, and that he'd never willfully abandon his sister and friends.  But, we also know that he'd go into hiding to protect them if circumstances demanded he do so (or, in the case of ROTJ, leave his friends behind to face his enemy alone), rather than risk their lives.  Like I said before, I'm not really rooting for Han and Leia to be separated or for Luke to be in exile.  I don't want to see real-life struggles affecting our heroes anymore than you or any diehard fan does.  However, the realities exist whether we like them or not, and I don't put it past the writers to inflict them on our favorite fairy tale.  For what it's worth, I hope you won't find yourself walking away from the new EU.  I guess only time will tell."
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,Shatterhand1701,8,Fri Jul 17 18:56:33 2015 UTC,"Something rubs me the wrong way about the idea that, having spent the entire OT fighting with the rebellion (and the entirety of Return of the Jedi, arguably the big showdown with the Empire, actually helping to lead the rebels in what may well have been a suicide mission) that Han would just up and leave and it'd be down to ""oh lol 'cos he's a rogue, isn't he?""  If it's written that Han absconded after Return of the Jedi (effectively leaving the woman he loves and one of his best friends, right after winning a glorious victory), Kasdan had better have a damned good reason for it happening."
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,Hufflepuffins,4,Thu Jul 16 21:24:42 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming things were pretty quiet for a while after ROTJ. So he probably didn't leave outright but drifted away during the ""reconstruction"" period. Thirty years is a long time..."

StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,Throwawayfortheghost,2,Fri Jul 17 01:27:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel like a huge part of Hans arc was that he changed in ANH from being a selfish smuggler, to realizing the (forgive me) value of friendship. In ANH he bails after he gets his reward and leave before they assault the Death Star, when Luke tells him ""Hey Han, take care of yourself...I guess that's what you're best at."" Something changes, he gets it and he comes back to bail Luke out when he needs him.  Also when Luke is attacked by the Wampa in ESB, they announce that it is too cold and they must close the base doors, Han goes out into the freezing to look for Luke. When warned about the dangerous weather Han replies ""Yeah and my friend is out there in it."" The rebel soldier says ""you'll die if you go out there"" to which Han famously yells ""THEN I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL!""   This guy wouldn't just up and leave it's not in his character, and if you think it is then you need to watch more than just the beginning of ANH."
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,TheGonzalo,2,Fri Jul 17 02:16:08 2015 UTC,"Kasdan didn't write all of the script.  I have almost zero faith in everyone else attached to the script. Han didn't just go 'all in' with the rebellion, he gave it the one thing he probably loved most: the Falcon.  Sure he 'lent' it to Lando, who Han knows loves the ship almost as much as he does, but does a selfish loner, rogue, and scoundrel give up his prized possession on a whim?  No, he won't do that unless he's changed in a permanent way."
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,VM1138,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:00:14 2015 UTC,"Thirty years is a long time. He could have stayed with the Alliance for two decades before things with Leia go to pot and he decides that it's time to get back to his old lifestyle. Assuming he spent years living with Leia and working as an admiral in the Alliance (he was promoted from captain to general after his dip in carbonite, so it stands to reason he'd at least make admiral after the Battle of Endor), he might look back on a simpler time with fewer obligations with nostalgia."

StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,reesewilkerson,4,Fri Jul 17 14:39:18 2015 UTC,"To have Han go back to being a selfish rake after his arc in the OT would be pretty craptastic.  Han Solo is a bona fide hero after ROTJ and the trio of heroes is far too ingrained in culture to just make them be shitty to each other because ""it happens in real life."""
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,DrSpodermen,2,Fri Jul 17 02:40:44 2015 UTC,"I have difficulty imagining that the writers of TFA would shit all over the character of Han Solo by setting up a scenario where he would decide his old life was better and just leave Leia and Luke behind.  I think it's far more likely that unfortunate events post-ROTJ pulled Han and Leia apart and they separated.  Perhaps he was even forced to leave them to protect himself or his friends.  Again, I don't think it will be something as simple and cruel to the character and fans as ""I miss being a scoundrel; I'm outta here""."

StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,Baziliy,2,Thu Jul 16 20:43:08 2015 UTC,I think it's plenty interesting. We don't need more McGuffin's/plot intricacies. Simplicity is key. The themes/satisfying story arcs/ good dialog will do the trick.
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,blender2772,2,Thu Jul 16 21:17:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, this is why ESB was brilliant. It's a great example of how you can still maintain a decent amount of character depth with a simplistic plot."

Luke will not hide out of fear, he should fear nobody as powerful as he is.  He is hiding for other reasons, likely as strategy and/or emotional state.  Luke will not be killed, he will likely die in the last episode as Yoda did.  Hans act will save the lives of Rey and/or Finn, not Luke. Leia will have cameo appearances at best."
StarWarsLeaks,3djnt8,blender2772,3,Thu Jul 16 20:46:11 2015 UTC,Leia will have cameo appearances at best.   Where are you hearing this? All signs point to her being the leader of the rebellion. We even saw a saber handed over to her - she sounds much more integral than just a cameo at best.

Han's realm is in space battle, not fighting dark lords/siths. It would seem off.  And having Luke be ""fearful"" will be a test he hasn't really faced. Even though he may have feared Vader, he still confronted him (arguably per-maturely due to his brashness; as we all know!).  Rey/Finn will goad him into confronting Ren, and he will overcome a trepidation he never exhibited before (it will also provide a nice counter-point: Whereas Yoda/Obi-Wan urged him NOT to confront his enemy at the time, Rey/Finn will urge him to do the opposide--confront Ren). It will cost him his life but it will be a worthy sacfrifice to save Rey/Finn. I can picture his death imminent with Rey screaming ""BUT I'M NOT READY!!"" as Luke replies ""Yes, you are!"" and dies/is killed."

Luke I'm sure will have a bigger part than MSW says, it makes no fucking sense for him to be in one damn scene for 5 minutes. It's Luke fucking Skywalker, he is the main reason we're all going to see this film & his appearance will be what passes the torch to the new kids. If they kill him in this movie, I'll be very upset.

Yes, movies use matte paintings still all the time, but they are digital (mostly) and are designed to work hand and glove with CG.

StarWarsLeaks,3dfhy9,WhillsOfTheForce,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:05:47 2015 UTC,"True, but Han was never really a member of the Rebel Alliance and in TFA I, perhaps wrongfully, assume Poe is part of the resistance and/or whatever Leia is doing. I guess my question really is: is there a particular reason he's not in uniform? Is he undercover? Or is he more of a Han and not actually part of the resistance until later in the film?"
StarWarsLeaks,3dfhy9,WhillsOfTheForce,3,Thu Jul 16 01:14:33 2015 UTC,"@alexanderjeffery - no, not at first, Han basically joined up when he rescued Luke at the end of ANH.  But he still attempted to operate within smuggler/pirate circles as the same loner before his reputation preceded him... as the captain of the ship that reversed the Empire's destiny.  The Empire made sure Han lost his livelihood by saturating his circles of influence with heavy bounties.  I'm trying to say he chose them before he was forced to, but his independence as a self-employed space jockey was short lived as it was.  He was a member of the Alliance, and MakinDessert was correct, he was a Captain in ESB and a General by ROTJ.  The point I was trying to make was simply that Poe Dameron ""may be"" piloting the Falcon on this mission, and more than likely disguising himself as a smuggler/pirate in a stolen vessel.  ANH had a Corellian Corvette (Tantive IV) pursued by a Star Destroyer in the opening shot, why not a Corellian Light freighter pursued by a destroyer en route to Jakku in TFA's open?  Yes, Dameron is a resistance pilot.  He's already on the good guys team.  I think he serves (as well as the Falcon) as bait to lure in a retrieval team to rescue him - similar to what Leia was on the Death Star as a hero in distress.  My own visual clues to support this theory? - BB-8 shivering and peering around a corner on the Falcon, presumably when the ship is captured and Dameron is detained; Dameron led roughly down a hallway in the SDCC Panel Behind the Scenes video; his visible scratches on his chin and face when piloting the X-Wing in the first trailer; and Han's line to Chewie, ""We're home"".  Apologies to MakinDessert - excellent and correct point, keep on posting."
StarWarsLeaks,3dfhy9,MakinDessert,2,Thu Jul 16 04:32:53 2015 UTC,"If he's piloting the Falcon in the beginning, that could be very interesting and explain why it's on Jakku for Rey and Finn to get on. Poe's whereabouts after he and Finn escape is still a mystery to me. What if they don't escape on the same tie fighter? What if they get separated in a chase that ends with Finn crash landing on Jakku (where the Falcon still is thanks to Poe) and Poe getting away untouched in a different ship?"

Likely, he just took off his flight suit when landing on Jakku, or just didn't wear it to be covert.  I think the answer is that at the beginning of the film, Poe is on Jakku wearing the jacket Finn later gets (you can see him sneaking around at night in the SDCC video), gets captured, interrogated, and escapes with it. Finn gets the jacket when they crash / are separated."

[Editor’s note: the name of the droid has been revealed as BB-8.] And when they were demonstrating how they did this thing, live on set — because it’s not CGI, that’s a live prop — I was just amazed. They let me play around with it. [Laughs] I was running it all around at the creature shop up in Pinewood.""   -Do you really think Mark Hamill would be amazed if it were really just a prop on a stick? ""And he was controlling it remotely at Pinewood during the time of filming. It being on a track to steer its path was some shots doesn't mean it was controlled directly via a stick.  EDIT: we have this quote from the NYT  But BB-8 was complicated. During the filming of the movie, it was a prop built on rollers and controlled by a puppeteer, he said.  “You would see this guy pushing BB-8 around, actually controlling BB-8, but he gets the equivalent of airbrushed out,” Mr. Iger said.  EDIT 2: A shot with Simon Pegg can be seen with BB-8 in the background being manually controlled."
StarWarsLeaks,3dc5oo,StrangeConstants,3,Wed Jul 15 06:16:03 2015 UTC,There's many kinds that they made. When it's just rolling really fast it's basically a ball being pulled by a stick. When it has to do other things it's remote controlled (as we saw at Celebration). Starwarsdude is right.

His descriptions of a star destroyer vs. Starkiller Base are particularly way off the mark regarding design.  The shape of the hallway the stormtrooper is leading Poe is certainly a ship and not a land base.  You can even look at real life navy ships and see that the roughly triangular shapes are used from bulkhead to bulkhead and deck to deck.  A ground base wouldn't need to taper part of the opening so tightly for stability like a ship would have to do.  If you're building on solid land, you can create uniform corridors and spaces while a moving chunk of a building, i.e. a ship, would need to honeycomb its interior spaces to maintain uniform stress resistance characteristics.

Poe probably crashes on that Forest planet, where there's some sort of ground battle going on that Finn is part of. Some sort of terrible thing goes on that Finn's a part of, like a massacre at the hands of Kylo Ren in a village Poe is hiding in. Finn is deeply disturbed and wants out. There, he is captured by the First Order, and we see Finn dragging Poe to his cell. Deeply bothered by what he sees on the forest planet, Poe wants out. After seeing how good of a pilot Poe is, Finn decides to bust Poe out as his means of escape.  For whatever reason the ship hightails it to Jakku, with the bulk of the military might of the ship distracted on Jakku they make their escape- only to be shot down again. (Could be a joke that the best pilot in the galaxy keeps getting shot down, much like how the falcon kept getting captured or breaking down at the hands of the Empire.) Poe gives Finn his jacket in hopes it will help him blend in after he sheds his armor and they go their separate ways to find a way off this rock.  Anticipating some fresh junk to sell, Rey speeds towards the crashed TIE and meets Finn."
StarWarsLeaks,3d931e,Gamefreak975,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:56:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think Poe crashes. He's like the hotshot pilot dude.

Even the prequels are complete stories. For this whole movie to lead up to Rey handing over a lightsaber Luke dropped 30 years isn't a satisfying ending, it's just a scene. It would be like ending A New Hope with the characters escaping the Death Star so they could save that battle for the sequel.  There are going to be loose threads to wrap up in the future films, but the movie should at least feel like a complete thought. They aren't going to defeat the villains completely. But if you're going to set something up, you have some kind of pay off. People have been wanting to see Luke again for over 30 years, he can't just be a cameo. Especially if he's supposed to be a Jedi Master mentoring the new characters, you need to see that happen in the movie. So they meet Luke and we get to see how he's changed since Return of the Jedi. The movie doesn't need to revolve around him, but he needs to be in it more than a few minutes of screen time.   That's just basic storytelling and from what I've read of MSW's version, he doesn't really understand that. I'm pretty sure that he has some legit source somewhere, but he's only seeing part of the full picture. There could be an ending that only the director, writer, the cast members involved and a small portion of the crew know about. In Empire, only a few people knew that Vader was Luke's father. Even David Prowse didn't know.  I'm thinking that after Luke is introduced, he has to do something. You can't just introduce a major character and not have them do anything, especially if the journey to meet them is the plot. Imagine that Empire Strikes Back was about Luke finding Yoda and he's built up to be a great Jedi, then the movie ends with Luke meeting him. That's it, wait a few years for the sequel. That works with a TV show because the next episode is at the very worst a few months away. But a movie needs to leave the audience feeling emotionally satisfied. The Marvel films do it, but not with major characters that are central to that movie's plot. The first Iron Man isn't about finding Nick Fury, he's just an easter egg that sets up it being part of a wider universe. It's a teaser for things to come and you can't tease audiences with such a major character.  Besides hasn't the man has been in England since filming began? If he wasn't actually needed on set for a lot of the filming, there's no reason to fly him out to England and stick him in a hotel. That's throwing away money. If this is like every other film made, they know when they'll need him to be on set. So having him just hanging around throughout the whole shoot doesn't make any sense if he's only supposed to be in one location. If it's just for those scenes, he'd only be there for a few days. There's really no reason for him to have to grow a beard if you're only going to see it in one scene. Make-up can do that and save Hamill the trouble of growing a beard for a glorified cameo."
StarWarsLeaks,3d9s0t,Stillwatch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:21:44 2015 UTC,"Actually if your trying to keep the fact that Luke is barely in it, keeping Hamill around the production for its duration is pretty much madatory. Imagine if he was only in Europe for the days on skellige Michael then came home? The spies would know and the cat would be out of the bag and the fans would be in hysterics."

Officers inquire as to his intentions and he states he's on a diplomatic mission from the Republic. The officer gets permission to lower the shield and tie fighters escort Dameron into the hangar. A group of Storm Troopers is waiting for him. They take him to General Tarkin and Dameron asks to see Kylo Ren. Tarkin says Kylo is busy but he would pass along whatever it is he came to say. Dameron tells Tarkin to scale back the military exercises or face consequences. Phasma is the background of this shot. BB-8 hacks into the destroyer while this is happening. Tarkin gives his regards to Dameron and sends him back on his way, then tells a trooper to apprehend Dameron after an officer informs him of unauthorized activity in the system. Poe Dameron has to fight his way out and is in constant communication with BB-8. Finn ends up being the trooper to stun Dameron just as he tells BB-8 to leave. The X Wing is shot down as it tries to flee and Tarkin orders Dameron locked up and a retrieval of the X Wing from the planet below, then tells an officer to inform ""his Excellency"" at once.

There are coincidences that make me believe the leaks are official and aren't simply sneaked out of ILM or Pinewood.

I am personally of the belief that everything a certain somebody ""leaks"" is official in one way or another. It holds over us die-hards with leaked footage/screens while the general populace goes on generally unaware. Then the ""leaked"" footage we saw appears in the very next trailer/teaser/official reveal, so we've technically not seen anything they didn't want us to.  When we got a leak of General Hux standing with Phasma, who then did we get a reveal of at SDCC? General Hux.  I've been downvoted to hell for thinking this but a few more can't hurt, right?"

They may think ""well, the hardcore fans saw the leak of this already, so no harm in putting it in the BTS video/teaser/trailer."" They'll obviously keep the big stuff under wraps though to keep people guessing (Snoke, Luke, etc).  That said, they'll of course continue to release a bit of new information with each teaser/trailer that is released regardless of leaks or not.

StarWarsLeaks,3d5hm1,NoNamedSheriff,17,Mon Jul 13 18:02:34 2015 UTC,"Almost every book released under the new canon flag has been without substance IMO. They've been enjoyable reads to be sure, but they are superficial retellings of what we thought we know.  A New Dawn: Kind of tells us how Kanan and Hera met (and a lot about space mining). We're obviously not going to get any thing related to TFA here, but still.  Heir to the Jedi: This was the most telling of the group I thought. We get glimpses of Luke's training in the early days and ideas that may bear fruit later. A good read, but still just okay.  Lords of the Sith: A look into Vader's relationship with The Force and his Master. It's interesting to see this dynamic, but ultimately comes off as the same gimmick throughout the whole book.  Tarkin: Haven't read it  The Comics: These guys have been the main force behind the new canon IMO. They've added to the canon and not just cashed in on it or clung to it. Again they aren't perfect, but they've had the most chance to come up with something that has an impact.  Again my point is this, they are releasing books but they either have no connection to anything new or don't move the Star Wars story forward. They just are.  I think we'll see more of the same with the books in this ""Journey to the Force Awakens"". True there might be clues hidden in all these books, but throw us a freaking bone here. Throw in a planet featured. Give us a character, tertiary or main. Give us a major plot point. Give us something."
StarWarsLeaks,3d5hm1,dddash,8,Mon Jul 13 19:54:04 2015 UTC,"I feel confident that it won't stay this way. From the start, I assumed that the novels released (with the exception of Aftermath, having been announced later) prior to TFA would be smaller, personal one-off stories so as to a) avoid stepping on the toes of a developing story and b) not to inadvertently drop any hints as to the nature of said story. One could argue that they could tell A Big Story without implying the plot of the upcoming film, but then again, knowing what big stories can be told without encroaching on the movie's territory would certainly serve to narrow down what the film might be covering by revealing what the books are allowed to cover.  Figuring that this would be the case ahead of time, I've been able to enjoy the books immensely because my expectations were geared toward smaller character studies rather than large-scale, galaxy-shattering events. After the film comes out and the status quo in general is revealed, the novels will surely get to open up and tell bigger stories in multiple eras."

Episodes VII-IX will almost certainly be followed by X-XII, and we'll have anthologies every year in between. Why put anything major into some tie-in novel when there's so many (much more profitable) films that can cover it?

Though I can see Rey and Finn being the love plot, seeing as how they might end up sharing Force Sensitivity and spend a lot of time training together. Their emotions for one another might be a source of conflict - one person goes berserk trying to save the other, and in the end might draw one of them away from the dark side. Love is weird in that it bridges both dark side and light side, so I think it would be odd to not include a romance in the movie, though I hope it isn't ham-fisted. I don't see the love plot really developing much though in 7. I think we will just see a bit of it in the form of flirtation or something like that.   I can see Poe saying ""I have a bad feeling about this"" especially since it was Han who said the line in ANH. It would be a nice homage.   I'm hoping, based on a Dash Star video, that Rey and Kylo Ren fight it out, with Rey using her staff.

Across six films we only have one twist that really qualifies, which is of course ""I am your father"".   I hope JJ isn't trying to contrive something similar. Part of the magic of that particular twist was the pre-internet, pre-spoiler era in which it happened. Plus the fact that it was unusual for family blockbusters to even have that kind of twist. None of that applies anymore."
StarWarsLeaks,3d4ug2,Killzark,3,Tue Jul 14 07:50:31 2015 UTC,"Empire's twist is the only huge super twist, but there's plenty of unexpected turns in the plot in every movie.

I've heard people say that it would be a HUGE let down, but think about this, on the flip side: A lot of people complained that a further conflict of Rebellion/Empire-like entities kind of takes away the happy ending at Jedi, maybe NOT having them on screen together preserves that moment of victory--it allows the ending of Jedi to remain special because of the fact that it's the last time we seem them together."
StarWarsLeaks,3d4ug2,timzxcv,7,Mon Jul 13 16:00:32 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I like this idea. Or maybe it will be one of those things where they keep missing each other in the movie, then one of them dies."

Basically all Domhnall said was that the First Order has a weapon/base called ""Star Killer"".

I put out my guess / what I would like to see. Time to bring about the end of the skywalker story and make a story about some new characters. You put out your ""End of story"" guess   Also if we are going to continue the skywalker story JJ's comment that Rey and Fin could have been any color doesn't leave much room for skywalker heirs. Either Kylo Ren is his lineage or Poe or Hux or Greg Grunberg's pilot character. I dont have much faith for any of those.  Lets not forget this business no longer belongs to Lucas. Disney owns it and is free to do what it wishes with the anthology films and the numbered movies. Its completely up to Kathleen Kennedy if she wants the numbered movies to continue being about skywalkers but nothing says it has to. Nothing.  Granted its fair for you to have a conflicting opinion from mine and its a fair guess. Someone could be related to skywalker. I just dont think thats likely given what they have said."

You're right that we have no idea who these characters are yet, but it's pretty hard to believe that between Han, Luke and Leia they don't have any kids in this movie.

StarWarsLeaks,3d33fc,gormo2,4,Mon Jul 13 06:40:47 2015 UTC,We actually know nothing of Luke in TFA...
StarWarsLeaks,3d33fc,StealthBadger25,0,Mon Jul 13 21:24:07 2015 UTC,We know Hamill was filming at Skellig Michael with Daisy Ridley. We as good as know that Luke is the cloaked figure who places a hand on Artoo in teaser 2. We know contextually where and when Luke isn't located in the film based on the teasers and sdcc reel. We also know that the rumored plot points reported on by MSW are looking more and more real. Too bad if you don't like it but that is the state of things.
StarWarsLeaks,3d33fc,gormo2,0,Tue Jul 14 05:51:15 2015 UTC,"Even if MSW is close, I doubt he has access to the actual ending to the movie. They actually filmed alternate versions of scenes in the OT just to prevent the real ending from being leaked.

StarWarsLeaks,3d33fc,darthfarmer,3,Mon Jul 13 04:08:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think they are keeping Luke quiet because anything involving him is going to be vital to the plot. Han is vital to the plot in his own way, but Luke is our lens into the inner workings of the Force and how powerful the Jedi/Sith can become (and how they affect the universe). Han is an important character, but he's more of an everyman trucker with an incredible amount of swagger."
StarWarsLeaks,3d33fc,darthstupidious,7,Tue Jul 14 01:09:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Luke is the most important, for sure."
StarWarsLeaks,3d33fc,HenryChinaskiForPrez,3,Mon Jul 13 04:13:31 2015 UTC,"Luke Skywalker is the man. Heck, he's the gold template which all other epic heroes are copying.  Adopted family. Special skills that set him above others. A few minor encounters, with more victories but a few defeats. Mentorship, bromance, and girl who feels like family. Special weapon, special non-human companion, and a destiny against the Big Evil that he'll forsake in an effort to exert free-will.  Luke Skywalker = Harry Potter = Jon Snow = ... Finn?  So yes. As long as they get Luke Skywalker right, it'll be a 4-star movie in my book."

Anthology films will lack this and it will be a weakness.  It's just too bad we'll have to wait until ep8 in about 2 years to see luke significantly as per msw
StarWarsLeaks,3d33fc,GaryGeck,3,Mon Jul 13 03:39:45 2015 UTC,I don't buy it. Luke will be in the movie.

Yes the new characters are important but to say the movie isn't about Luke Han and Leia is absurd. That's like saying Metallica isn't about James, Kirk and Lars. They ARE Metallica. Just like Luke, Han, and Leia ARE Star Wars. Yes it's about the new characters, because it's a new story. But if it wasn't about them they wouldn't be in it."

But they purposely set it 30 years later, so it's reasonable that they are a major part of the story. It doesn't have to just about them, but I'm expecting them to have a major impact on the story. Especially if they are keeping the trend of it being about the Skywalker family. The fact that they are making spin-off movies focusing on other characters makes me think that this is the case. Episodes I-IX is the Skywalker Saga (Anakin, Luke, possible descendant). The Anthology films are just stories set in that same universe about other events."
StarWarsLeaks,3d33fc,ReallyNotACylon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:46:01 2015 UTC,Exactly Anthology films will show us things we've heard about but haven't seen. The Kessel Run? The Bothan Spies who died to get the information? Things of that nature.

Hopefully they were seperated just in that they were on missions on different sides of the galaxy. But even without the solo kids i don't know if i could stand the two of them not being together in the movie.  It would be like seeing your own parents get divorced (and ive already been though that)
StarWarsLeaks,3d33fc,roninjedi,3,Tue Jul 14 00:38:13 2015 UTC,I want no need Grand Master Luke. I don't think i can deal with a Luke Skywalker who has been so afraid of his powers he has been hiding away on a distant planet. I mean form what we know they seem to have already went crazy with han/leia relationship. So i don't know if i could stand seeing my childhood hero being some scared hermit who only trained maybe two or three jedi instead of rebuilding the order and spending the last 30 years kicking asses across the galaxy.
StarWarsLeaks,3d33fc,Gamefreak975,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:34:57 2015 UTC,"Yup. JJ and crew know this, though. Luke will be a central figure (chosen from the original trio) of the sequels.

Luke's the important character in the OT (both as a character and as an actor selling the audience on the story/muppets).  When you start talking about the entire saga then daddy issues obviously take a back seat to the overarching story.
StarWarsLeaks,3d33fc,CHILLSmannn,2,Mon Jul 13 11:55:16 2015 UTC,"I'm a Luke Skywalker fan through and through. His character arch in the original trilogy is a big part of what makes those movies for me. I think his character is going to be mysterious in this movie, an almost mythic figure. We all know the rumors about his screen time, and that bothered me at first, but I've since warmed up to it. As long as it pays off, it will be worth it. The fact that Mark Hamill appears to be growing his Jedi beard again for EpVIII makes me think he will play a larger almost, Yoda esque-role in that movie."

I vividy remember thinking to myself years ago ""you know...I guess for alot of people Luke has been the hero of Star Wars for the last 30+ years"" which makes sense but I guess it just comes down to which generation you grew up in.   Not to mention the fact that as a kid I couldn't really appreciate the originals, whenever they would play on TV I would always think ""ugh it's the OLD starwars....skipp"" haha I have now come to really love and  appreciate them and understand why they meant so much to others but no matter how much hate there was for the prequels they will always be what made fall in love with star wars!  That being said Star Wars has always been about the Skywalker Family to me and while I think I'll always be an Anakin fan boy I'm excited to see Mark as Luke because Luke and Leia are Anakins  LEGACY  and I can't wait to see Luke as the Jedi Anakin was supposed to be!!!!"

Harrison always looks like a million bucks, followed by Mark, and Carrie looks the worst sad to say. But they are all great people very nice to the fans. Carrie seems to have a lot of fun with the fans. Mark is very humble."

As Star Wars expands it will be like Robin Hood and Arthurian Tales. Each one will be outside the original canon but still great stories!  My favorite Robin Hood version is a fox.

The Starkiller answer was not triggered by Chris Hardwicks comment related to ""General Hux usind a large weaponized machine to detain something"".....Gleeson answered with the ""just like the british"" running gag  Directly after that they go on to Gwendoline Christie.  Then they switch to audience questions and during this, Gleeson said about his Character as told to him by JJ and Kasdan during his casting process, that ""he was in charge of people, on a Starkiller Base sort of thing"".  JJ said in reaction that ""the name of the base of the first order is in honor of the original last name of (Luke) Skywalker"".  So JJ's reaction was right the opposite of desperately covering up - He just explained it to the audience and even Kasdan nodded his head supporting/underline JJ's answer to the Starkiller topic.  The Annikin Starkiller Character was also not just one of the suggested surnames back then, it was the Character we know as Luke back in the rough draft from Lucas 1975.

We're talking about the Starkiller!"" It slipped out, but Abrams was just handy enough with the Star Wars history tidbit about the name ""Starkiller"" to cover it up.  ""Starkiller base"" is a really odd name for a location, unless we're literally talking about some sort of weapon named ""The Starkiller.""

Whilst 'Starkiller' could just be a name and a reference to an proposed name for Luke, JJ's reaction and Gleeson's embarrassment convinces me that a mistake was indeed made. It also fits with persistent rumours of a Imperial superweapon which is a familiar theme in the OT.  I also thought Adam Driver's non-answers to questions were so careful that he was under huge constraint and pressure to reveal nothing about his mysterious role. It seems that the effervescent Gleeson was much more reckless in his response and may even be in a bit of trouble."

Look at all the other responses in the panel - all so measured, so generalized, they could have been talking about their roles in almost any movie. the next closest thing is from Oscar Isaac talking about his character and being inspired by the medal ceremony on yavin - which fanboys have taken to mean he was actually there.

I admit it's plausible that this is a ""super-weapon"" (though I really hope the movie doesn't go that tired route again), but again ""Starkiller"" was Luke's original surname, so why WOULDN'T that be the main reason they chose that as the name?"
StarWarsLeaks,3d3kx0,RUFiO006,2,Mon Jul 13 17:03:35 2015 UTC,"Because its Luke's arch enemies that have adopted the name which is a bit odd. If JJ really just wanted that name as a little nod to the history of SW he could easily have named a Republic character or ship 'Starkiller'.  Also I believe Gleeson said 'A star-killer base' which suggests that the destruction of stars is its function not just a random name.  Thirdly, destroying a star and potentially its whole system is the next logical escalation of the Empire's doomsday weapons and would be very dramatic. It would also be terrifyingly cool as we'll probably see it blast a star in the movie in a similar fashion to how Alderaan was obliterated in SW.  Don't tell me that wouldn't be exciting."

And he said ""on a like starkiller base kinda thing"" so it's not like he was being specific at all, but I agree that could go either way.   I admit that my bias is at play here, because I think escalating up from the Death Star is just tired and lazy. I also will REALLY hate it if there are dueling Pub/Imp (or whatever) super-weapons."

The name Starkiller is only related to Luke due to its use in early drafts of Star Wars and has no in-universe context that we know of. There's nothing odd about the bad guys using that name. Moreover, ""Starkiller"" is in line with the sort of names the Imperials use...Star Destroyers, the Death Star, etc."
StarWarsLeaks,3d3kx0,altoidsjedi,2,Mon Jul 13 23:07:58 2015 UTC,"True, but its also got to appeal to the logic of viewers that are aware of these details. I still strongly think the name refers primarily to the function of the base and will be a major dramatic plot device in the movie(s)."

StarWarsLeaks,3d3kx0,rabid_communicator,4,Mon Jul 13 17:19:16 2015 UTC,I thought the exact same thing when I watched the panel. That was very likely information that wasn't supposed to be revealed. JJ tried his best to downplay it

I took it upon myself to rename it as a Jakku. I thought that I could make interesting planets just as well as Lucas. I was wrong.""

It's possible that the battle rendered Tatooine inhospitable and new settlers renamed it.  It's not likely but it's interesting world-building.

They use it on one of the two suns of the system, causing a cataclysm that upends the planet and critically damages the fleets in orbit above. Many ships crash to the surface below.  In the aftermath of this battle, the planet is renamed to better reflect the massive changes that have stricken it. It becomes an arid junkyard world orbiting a single star.  Welcome to Jakku.

Or maybe it's similar to the idea in the EU of the Star Forge, which draws power from a star - maybe the star's energy is siphoned off and utilized for other purposes (say, manufacturing), and it's not an overtly destructive device.  It's all speculation, but I feel any of these are just as plausible as the next.

StarWarsLeaks,3d23hn,Teletoa,5,Sun Jul 12 23:45:44 2015 UTC,"AOTC, but yeah they do look similar. It'd be really weird if he just had one arm with no covering, like in TPM. Actually the evolution of this character's look over 60 odd years is interesting, while R2 hasn't changed physically at all (excluding the stupid flying ability he somehow forgot he had). He was cobbled together with spare parts, gradually improved, then given a nice makeover, but the wear and tear are starting to show. Does he still have the dent in his head?"
StarWarsLeaks,3d23hn,Bodymaster,2,Sun Jul 12 23:51:48 2015 UTC,"AOTC, that's right, I got them mixed. That is interesting, especially considering R2 goes head first into danger throughout the series. You'd think he'd get some replacement parts or paint that wasn't exactly like his own eventually.

StarWarsLeaks,3d4ql9,Killzark,16,Mon Jul 13 14:44:52 2015 UTC,They've made no bones about the fact that there will be CGI in the movie. The shots of the Falcon in the trailer are definitely CGI; it just looks good.

Specifically the obi wan vs jango space battle and the opening of episode 3. CGI is the way to go for space battles because youre able to create more dynamic and in my opinion more intense space battles."

It's just not cost-effective when ships are some of the most convincing digital effects they can make."
StarWarsLeaks,3d4ql9,RealVoltar,5,Mon Jul 13 22:56:46 2015 UTC,It looks to be about the same as E1; the only real difference being that LF emphasized the CG in E1 and they're emphasizing the practical stuff in E7.
StarWarsLeaks,3d4ql9,Urbinator,4,Tue Jul 14 13:44:46 2015 UTC,"The movie will be heavy on real sets, props and as many actual practical creatures as possible.  The rest will be the usual mixture or models and CG.  We already saw the X-Wing model at Celebration.  That'll be used as a composite between live action/model/CG. I know they are really selling the whole practical effects idea and that's good.  Lord of the Rings also had a huge reliance on practical effects but used CG carefully.  Expect the same with TFA. I am sure we will all be amazed when we learn what is real, what is a miniature, and what is CG once ILM releases its effects reel."

I think that Han Solo is Chewbacca from the future, after he has gone bald. If you really explore the character, I think that you’ll see that Han Solo and Chewbacca are the same person from different time periods, and also I think that what Han Solo wants more than anything is for Chewbacca to get nice and fat so that he can eat him in space. Han Solo is bald Chewbacca from the future and he wants to eat Chewbacca, who is the younger version of himself. That revelation made the movie 10x better for me."

StarWarsLeaks,3d3fir,sdesaulniers,2,Mon Jul 13 05:43:27 2015 UTC,"I find myself at odds. I actually like his approach to keeping a lot under wraps. I'd be happy if all we got was the two trailers we've seen...on the flip side. I read any spoilers that come out. I think the difference is seeing to much of what there is has more impact for me than reading a ton about it. It probably doesn't make sense, but I could've read the script to Age of Ultron and still would've been annoyed by the media blitz they did."
StarWarsLeaks,3d3fir,welshwordman,5,Mon Jul 13 11:38:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's shown a lot of regret for the John Harrison debacle, and has even blamed it on the studio. I'd be pretty surprised if he repeated the mistake."

There was a bunch of speculation that he would be playing fan favourite villain Khan, but they denied it and said he was playing someone called John Harrison. By the time the film came out, it was revealed that yes, John Harrison was Khan, in a very dramatic manner, as if it was supposed to surprise anyone, when really, it just pissed everyone off for being the worst kept secret at the time.  I'm guessing OP is asking if Serkis' character, Supreme Leader Snoke, is just another John Harrison in that Snoke is his disguise as Plagueis or something."
StarWarsLeaks,3d3fir,Fruit_Pastilles,5,Mon Jul 13 14:08:25 2015 UTC,Well technically Supreme Leader Snoke is his political name or alias. If he is Sith his real name would be Darth _______

StarWarsLeaks,3d3fir,johnm21789,2,Mon Jul 13 14:38:52 2015 UTC,"It's funny - my problem was never with John Harrison actually being Khan. It was with how it was revealed. Cumberbatch's delivery was so over-the-top, as though it was directed at the audience, not Kirk and Spock.   I actually really liked the way they introduced Khan into the new world narrative, with him being coopted by a militant arm of Starfleet, it was just that reveal and then the blatant retread of the finale that drove me nuts. I'm still a bit pissed that JJ was okay with that."
StarWarsLeaks,3d3fir,DoogsATX,8,Mon Jul 13 20:10:35 2015 UTC,I'm working pretty hard to dissociate JJ from that nasty Wrath of Khan spoof so quit trying to remind me...I don't care how much you want to superimpose Plagueis over this movie.
StarWarsLeaks,3d3fir,RealVoltar,3,Mon Jul 13 10:25:51 2015 UTC,"JJ isn't saying the Khan deception was a bad idea, he's re-evaluating if he'd do that deception thing over again.   ""it probably would have been smarter just to say upfront 'This is who it is.""   and   ""I can understand their argument to try to keep that quiet, but I do wonder if it would have seemed a little bit less like an attempt at deception if we had just come out with it.""   It sounds to me like it's less that he's admitting/agreeing to the mistake, and more that he's wondering whether it was better to be honest.  The Trek deception doesn't add or subtract from Snoke-as-Plagueis, or Jakku-as-Tatooine (or Rey-as-Kira-Solo). Deception has been a part of Star Wars since forever, and a part of storytelling since before that."
StarWarsLeaks,3d3fir,C3PP,2,Mon Jul 13 13:58:11 2015 UTC,"I dont think so, but more because I dont think Snoke is going to turn out to be the big bad.  I dobt think , its Kylo, though."

After seeing the BvS trailer I can tell you the leak was spot on.   Leaks are damaging for the studio and the movie itself. That's just a fact. Now personal opinion is that while I want to know the entire story before I sit down because I'm so anxious for star wars, some surprises would be enjoyable.  I also believe there may be a huge plot twist we have yet to know about. If I had to throw out a wild guess it's Snoke and Luke. Serkis was the last major actor and didn't show at sdcc. Mark Hamill and JJ / KK have said nothing about what Skywalker has been up to.   Which leads to The 'journey to the force awakens' book and comic run Disney is doing. If you want spoilers check all of it out in September. It would have to flesh out what Luke has been up to or if the rumors suggesting he's in hiding are correct then it will explain what drove him into hiding.   My money is Snoke knows something damning about the original 3 and will try to use it against them. Maybe an internal conflict that split the three so he could plot to overthrow the new Republic?"
StarWarsLeaks,3d0zeo,nexusx86,6,Sun Jul 12 19:12:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a stretch to assume all the leak fanboy communities, sites and forums are actually helping with misdirection wether it was intended consciously by JJ and crew or not. Every one of the aforementioned criticizing and analyzing every single detail from concept art, rumors, trailers and news articles are so amassed that there is all kinds of misdirection simply due to the fact there's no consistency among every theory.  Mass confusion (better words would be mass non agreement) among all the fanboys, rumor sites, news outlets and community forums is actually creating misdirection by proxy. And the fact that everyone expected a trailer and we got behind the scenes footage instead is just another one of many examples of this. Even Kevin Smith was duped by this.  Wether or not JJ and crew intended these outlets and resources to create misdirection or not they are fully aware it's there and are at least using it to their advantage now. The question is are they simply using it to guard the movie's release or is there really a huge reveal they are trying to guard as well? I personally believe it's both but as for the huge reveal I have no idea what it could be. I'm not in the Plagueis or Revan camp but something truly huge is going to make every fanboy go nuts."
StarWarsLeaks,3d0zeo,TheDugat,3,Sun Jul 12 17:12:41 2015 UTC,Didn't Kevin Smith bet we'd see new footage? Because we did. It wasn't a trailer but you got to see scenes from the making of the movie and it was wonderful. I'm sure Kevin wasn't complaining on the way home.
StarWarsLeaks,3d0zeo,mytoemytoe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"I think the misdirection is leaking very minimal information, pictures and what not.  I think JJ is behind some of it but the people who work at lucasfilm and Disney probably remember the craziness of fans from the prequels, especially episode 1 and are playing into that. As far as what gets leaked probably doesn't have much to do with JJ, but with the marketing team.   Now, there probably will be some giant twist involved in the movie, the question is, will it work with the audience. I think going with raven or plagueis would be a mistake other than some reference for the fans. Most people are going to have no idea who those people are. They are catering to fans, yes, but they need to also make a movie that caters to a wide audience, so any big twist needs to be relatively simple."
StarWarsLeaks,3d0zeo,RNAPII,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:42:59 2015 UTC,"Any misdirection by JJ is either extremely subtle or unintentional, since the only people he would really be misleading at this point are those who frequent spoiler and leak sites, which is an extremely small number of us. The only thing that I could see being a mis-direction at this point is Poe Dameron. Oscar Isaac is a big name, and is without a doubt part of the new Big 3. Yet in MSW's and other spoiler sites he's rarely mentioned outside of the opening few minutes and the highly speculative third act.  That said, it's possible. But I think JJ learned from the whole Khan snafu and won't try a misdirection on that level again. Some more leaks and official content will be released in the upcoming weeks and months, so I might change my opinion then. But I think at this point it's less about JJ relying on misdirection and more about him preserving the in-theater experience. I think JJ and crew are wanting the buildup to this movie to be the exact opposite of Terminator Genysis and Jurassic World campaigns, where the trailers spoiled huge plot details and people only had to see the movie to fill in a few blank spaces that the trailers didn't already tell us."

Oscar Isaac said Poe is ""the best pilot in the galaxy"" at SWC2015 (like his grandfather?) and that he is sent on a mission by Leia. ""The force is strong in my family"" I think Poe's going to be the Luke of the movies."

There's either stuff about Poe they don't want us to know (99%) or he's not a major character after all, not in TFA at least(1%).  Also worth mentioning: Isaac has a preference for playing weirdos. Actors tend to stay true to their preferences for characters (also due to typecasting). On the other hand and off-topic: Gleeson always plays good guys :P"
StarWarsLeaks,3d0zeo,hectorlizard,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:43:26 2015 UTC,"There is some other explanation to Poe's absence from footage — most leaks have him disappearing after the TIE crash with Finn at the beginning and coming back only at the end. With the BTS reel we now have seen him in what is probably the escape scene with Finn (helmet on), but any other action sequence with Poe will probably be kept for the third act."

StarWarsLeaks,3d0zeo,mytoemytoe,2,Sun Jul 12 23:57:47 2015 UTC,"You're looking at it all wrong, the clue is that Rey and Finn don't have last names. They're most likely orphans, or on the run. Part of the mystery of the movie will be the back stories of their characters.  There won't be a ""new Luke"" because we still have the old one. These are new characters with different flaws and different perspectives."
StarWarsLeaks,3d0zeo,Urbinator,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:49:16 2015 UTC,I would wager he gets a first name because his last name is a nod to JJ's assistant whose last name is Dameron. I read that and thought it was a nice touch by JJ.
StarWarsLeaks,3d0zeo,terriblehuman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:01:17 2015 UTC,"Well, it is interesting that aside from his name, we know even less about his role in the action than we do about the other characters.

StarWarsLeaks,3d0zeo,LograysTaint,0,Sun Jul 12 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's lack of direction, and not misdirection as some have said in this thread.   I also think that there is no huge twist coming, no 'I am your father' moment. I don't think that can ever be duplicated, especially nowadays when we are all speculating on every possible combination and permutation no matter how unlikely. (eg the 3PO/first order thread from this morning). Whatever hidden relationship or hidden side switch they could come up with has been covered or considered, and may feel contrived, and most likely pale in comparison to that moment.  Hopefuly we just get a good story that fits."
StarWarsLeaks,3d0zeo,gumtuu,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:58:35 2015 UTC,"The only thing that could come close to an ""I'm your father"" moment  would be if Rey suddenly finds out she was responsible for the Jedi academy massacre (if there is one) and they erased her memories of it. More of a REVAN moment though, but it would explain why she would be reluctant to take up the lightsaber again."
StarWarsLeaks,3d0zeo,LograysTaint,3,Sun Jul 12 18:53:27 2015 UTC,"The Vader reveal is one of the biggest twists in the history of cinema, no one saw it coming at the time.

StarWarsLeaks,3d0zeo,AcceptingNormality,-1,Sun Jul 12 19:20:10 2015 UTC,"After re-watching the comic-con reel, I may think you're onto something. I noticed a lot of footage consisted of confirmations of leaks (crashed tie-fighter CA, Greenham common, Ackbar & Nien, Han, Rey & Finn in Falcon, C3PO in control room, Poe held prisoner, Leia in costume, Simon Pegg as an alien, Rey's fallen AT-AT hideout/home).   there's probably a few more I missed but you get the general idea. Perhaps they used these particular shots to further enhance 'leakers' theories, completely throwing us off the trail?   I don't think Han dies. Imagine the secrecy behind every single detail of this film. The most we had was a set leak from Abu Dhabi but that was not even a small spoiler. Ward simply cannot have been given information only a handful of people in the world know. I could imagine people in the industry know MSW well by now and are simply laughing at his 'fill in the gaps' guess-work."
StarWarsLeaks,3d0zeo,gormo2,5,Sun Jul 12 19:37:26 2015 UTC,"You're taking all the evidence that MSW is right (all the things they leaked that turned out to be true) and using that as evidence that they're wrong or being misled? LOL, so in other words, no matter how much of MSW's leaks get confirmed in the future, you'll chalk it up to being misdirection. Nice delusions, bro."
StarWarsLeaks,3d0zeo,AcceptingNormality,0,Sun Jul 12 21:51:35 2015 UTC,"Reading my comment again. D'oh. It does come off as contradictory.   what I MEAN is that what we saw in the comic-con reel WAS indeed confirmation of smaller details, HOWEVER I do not believe they have the big 'twists' and 'spoilers' spot on.   If the 'big leaks' are indeed true, then wouldn't someone at disney/lucasfilm easily shut down MSW? If they're purposely showing us footage that has come from leaks, maybe they're also making us believe that the bigger leaks are also true (when they are actually not). Just trying to speculate as it seemed too much of a coincidence to ignore after everything we've seen over the past month or so.  Thanks for labelling me 'delusional'. How nice."

StarWarsLeaks,3d0zeo,thatstarwarsdude,5,Sun Jul 12 21:37:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly, these people are doing mental backflips to convince themselves MSW is wrong. What's the simpler explanation: conspiracy to put out a fake story and then leak exactly that in order to make things so plausible that we are misled (lol why?), or that some things leaked and now we're getting to see that those things are in fact real. When the deniers see something new that MSW leaked and got right, they don't say, ""Wow, I guess MSW was right after all"" but instead say ""Aha! Proof that MSW is disinfo!"" It's embarrassing.  This really convinces me there will be a backlash to the film. Probably nowhere near as bad as the prequels, but we already have so many people here crying about Han dying and Luke being only at then end. People forget that these films are not meant only or even primarily for old fans, but supposed to hook an entire new generation (who maybe never even saw or heard of SW before)."

I get a kick out if it for the most part.   I also am not sure about a big backlash, but there will be a population that doesn't like it. Can't please everyone and all...I've written my stance on it a few times, but I think MSW has got the main plot. I can't see it any other way, they have been right far more often than not. I've never interacted with the guy or any of that biz so whatever that dilly is I don't care one way or the other. I don't like what he's describing but that's tough shit for me, really. I'm of the mindset that if you bullet pointed out the OT without context they probably would sound lame as well. Plus it looks fucking cool so far, so there's that.

The cockpit glass doesn't need a frame to support it anymore and can be molded into more shapes.

There's no need to blow anyone away from the get-go like George did in '77; it's a well-established franchise getting back on its feet again cinematically, so why not start off subtle and build tension to the first action setpiece, likely a thrilling escape or vicious First Order assault? That gives it more impact, letting us get the ""OMG OPENING CRAWL STAR WARS IS BACK I'M SOBBING LIKE A BABY"" giggles out and giving us the time to pay attention, hear what's happening, and settle back into our favorite galaxy far, far away.  That's my two credits, at least."
StarWarsLeaks,3cz6do,Grey-Hawk,5,Sun Jul 12 03:53:50 2015 UTC,That opening shot of Revenge of the Sith is pure CGI-porn and I love every second of it!
StarWarsLeaks,3cz6do,JakkuScavenger,3,Sun Jul 12 12:29:51 2015 UTC,"That's pure Star Wars porn man. That's one of the most fun and most OT style scenes in the whole PT. I will always stand by Episode 3 being a pretty solid end to a disappointing series of movies. You've got action everywhere, fun new villains, and just enough lore sparsed troughout the movie to make dumber scenes like Chewie and Yoda being bro's not seem so bad.  Plus, Ian Mcdirmiad still killed it as Palpatine 20 years after Jedi."
StarWarsLeaks,3cz6do,cloudxen,2,Sun Jul 12 23:39:07 2015 UTC,People talk so much shit about RotS but they never mention good things like the opening shot.
StarWarsLeaks,3cz6do,Samuraistronaut,4,Sun Jul 12 14:00:56 2015 UTC,"That opening is one of the best moments in the prequels by far, and stands up well to any OT moment. RotS had some really great scenes, and this is coming from someone who gets legitimately angry about the quality of the PT..."
StarWarsLeaks,3cz6do,Grey-Hawk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:45:26 2015 UTC,"Revenge of the Sith is actually a good movie IMO. There are still some bad moments, but overall I like it. Phantom Menace can be fun in parts too. The only prequel I truly hate is Attack of the Clones."
StarWarsLeaks,3cz6do,sdesaulniers,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:13:56 2015 UTC,"RotS was really good, and like you said had it's bad moments. One of them is during the Obi-Wan vs. Anakin fight at the end where Anakin says ""You underestimate my power."" Could've been better, but... Still a good movie."
StarWarsLeaks,3cz6do,saskatchewan_kenobi,2,Sun Jul 12 19:28:04 2015 UTC,That one is by far my favorite opening and i love the drums that play with it.
StarWarsLeaks,3cz6do,Daftmau85,3,Sun Jul 12 15:10:08 2015 UTC,J.J. is an expert at making intense emotional sequences as well as intense action sequences Example 1 and Example 2  But I think J.J. knows the importance of storytelling and developing lovable characters. I think he was most certainly the right choice to direct TFA and I think this movie is going to have a lot of kickass action scenes in it.
StarWarsLeaks,3cz6do,DinoDude23,2,Sun Jul 12 06:18:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think our movie might start with the shuttle carrying Finn et al stormtroopers down to Jakku. Maybe the locals put up some middling resistance? Idk but from what we saw from the teasers it seems like an interesting place to start, and it would certainly throw us right into the thick of the action.  The use of practical effects (the stormtroopers on wires for instance) is something I'm looking forward to. Abrams seems dedicated to making things look and feel real. Green screens have been absolutely over-used, to the point where a lot of times it breaks the immersion (at least for me; that was my experience with The Hobbit trilogy)."
StarWarsLeaks,3cz6do,papahunts,-1,Sun Jul 12 05:59:22 2015 UTC,"Not only did the green screens kill the hobbit for me, but they took a 300 page book and spanned it 3 movies. But with tfa it's gonna be spectacular. The only green screen we saw was when Kylo Ren was coming down from his shuttle and I hope that's the only time they used it."
StarWarsLeaks,3cz6do,JakkuScavenger,10,Sun Jul 12 06:07:13 2015 UTC,Yes.. im sure that was the ONLY time they used a green screen for the entire movie...that is completely logical thinking.
StarWarsLeaks,3cz6do,cthulhufhtagn,0,Sun Jul 12 06:20:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it wasn't the ONLY time. Im just that's the only time we've seen it so far. And hey, people can hAve hopes right? Just look at all the Revan and Plaguies theories."
StarWarsLeaks,3cz6do,cthulhufhtagn,2,Sun Jul 12 06:26:33 2015 UTC,J.J. said it would still have a ton of CGI.
StarWarsLeaks,3cz6do,Galact_ca,-2,Sun Jul 12 12:30:49 2015 UTC,"Well in this day and age you can't make a movie like that without CGI. I'm just saying that GL ruined the prequels with a majority of CGI, and Jar Jar. I still enjoy watching them just to watch Anakin's transformation into Vader."
StarWarsLeaks,3cz6do,Galact_ca,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:46:24 2015 UTC,"As much as I prefer practical effects over majority cgi, I think it a rough statement to say that George Lucas ""ruined"" anything.  All six movies are a cohesive part of one story.  The two trilogies were made using different mediums but the story is together.  JarJar was annoying.  His presence really dampens my enjoyment of Episode I.  He's barely in the other films, and even in Episode I, he's a side character.  I know my opinion is a minority one."

There are even many people who consider themselves big Star Wars fans who don't really know who Plagueis is.  In other words, if the big climax of TFA is ""SNOKE IS PLAGUEIS,"" the vast majority of this movie's audience are going to respond with ""Who?"" It's not good storytelling, it's only relevant to Star Wars fans, and it's basically the opposite of what Abrams has said he's trying to do with the movie."

The theory remains alive because people want to see that canon is followed. It was set up in EP. 3, and alot of people feel that way. Here is WHY I speculate:   -They said at comic con that they are strictly following film canon.  -completely avoided the question when asked about him. -Plagueis had an entire scene dedicated to his story or backstory. That alone takes him from Legends/EU to canon. Follow? -knowing about plageuis being palpatine's master is pointless if not for some greater plot hole that needs to be filled. - It was suggested that he created Anikin in the first place, and if Star Wars is about the Skywalker family as much as it is about space battles, then wouldn't confronting him this trilogy bring closure to the skywalker story? -He also happens to be..... Eternal. As in.. at the VERY least the only sith with force ghost knowledge...   but if its not him, doesn't matter.. This is fun to me, keeps me entertained until the movie comes out."

But if he was sold as an 'all-powerful sith being' rather than simply the name Darth Plagueis it could work both ways. If they just drop 'Oh this is Plagueis' on the audience, i think it would be mixed. But if they hyped it up as an all-powerful, death defying, sith lord, then that is something that both the casual fan and the diehard can get behind and understand."
StarWarsLeaks,3d3axr,JamesonRH,7,Mon Jul 13 06:08:08 2015 UTC,Even hyping him up as the Emperor's Sith Master would be enough for the casual audience.

StarWarsLeaks,3d3axr,drod2015,2,Mon Jul 13 06:14:29 2015 UTC,My exact thoughts on Plagueis. He can be introduced both as a formidable new foe and as a tie to the over arching story very easily.
StarWarsLeaks,3d3axr,Stillwatch,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:59:00 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't say ""Snoke is Plagueis"" they would say ""Snoke is Plagueis, Sidious ' s master and a sith so powerful he existed without sidious knowing"""
StarWarsLeaks,3d3axr,phyloh,4,Wed Jul 15 21:30:13 2015 UTC,"Plagueis would make some sense and I'd be fine with it. It would be easy.  Heroes: Who are you?  Snoke: Snoke.  Heroes: Who are you really?  Snoke: The Emperor's master.  If Plagueis is powerful enough to have trained Palpy, it's possible he survived his apprentice's murder attempt.  And maybe where Palpatine wanted ""order"" and to rule under an iron fist, maybe Plagueis wants chaos and fear -- something to help bolster the dark side (think Lex Luthor vs. Nolan's Joker).  Who knows. It's not as odorous as the Revan garbage and at least Plageuis is 100% canon. I'd be cool with it."
StarWarsLeaks,3d3axr,RedditBlaze,7,Mon Jul 13 18:58:24 2015 UTC,"As far as wild speculations go, I kind of like this theory. Kylo's sith fantasy could certainly eventually bring him to resurrect Plagueis whether its intentionally or him being controlled. It would give us the usual big bad guy, with his also ""evil"" front man Kylo.   The way the TFA SDCC panel handled the Plagueis question was just slightly past the line on the side of them trying to hide it. Kasdan not knowing plagueis was a bit too much of a lie to sell and JJ promptly tried to bury it and move on."
StarWarsLeaks,3d3axr,Angelmv86,2,Mon Jul 13 04:49:38 2015 UTC,"Kasdan's whole "" Darth Vegas?, Who? "" Kinda told me that.... yea, there is a possibility."
StarWarsLeaks,3d3axr,thadm,2,Mon Jul 13 19:59:38 2015 UTC,"Just imagine the reveal done well.  Awakening of Dark and Light.  Plagueis telling Luke that it was he who made Palpatine.  He who made Skywalker.  Now I have returned. etc etc.  They left some clear Plagueis references in the canon materials.  You could make a compelling villain with a bit of a monologue.  It does sort of, belittle the death of Palpatine, but the new movies already made it clear that didn't solve all the worlds problem, the prophecy could have already been misread.  I'm not sold on it, but it also wouldn't surprise me.  Especially since it seems like they've gone out of their way to keep references to Plagueis in some of the books."
StarWarsLeaks,3d3axr,HenryChinaskiForPrez,3,Mon Jul 13 20:34:52 2015 UTC,"My sentiments exactly. Kylo seems like a reclamation project of sorts. And something is going to have to go horribly wrong for him to realize it. This would classify. And after hearing about the panel danced around the Plagueis thing, that only made me believe it more."
StarWarsLeaks,3d3axr,bogaboy,0,Mon Jul 13 04:54:38 2015 UTC,"Uh, why would Kasdan know who Plagueis is? Kasdan wasn't involved in the PT at all, and I'd bet he didn't watch them. JJ knew who he was and said ""No."""

StarWarsLeaks,3d3axr,HenryChinaskiForPrez,2,Mon Jul 13 20:02:16 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'm unsure if we'll see Plagueis in the new movies, I'm actually leaning towards probably not. However, I really think he would be the perfect antagonist, and help make the whole thing feel like one saga."

I just figured anything with the word ""Plagueis"" in it was now automatically being filtered out....below the post I tried to create:  ""I know I'm going to get absolutely hammered into oblivion for this, and I pray that the mods don't ban me for bringing this back up (please don't - I'm addicted to this sub!), but I just watched the SDCC panel for the first time, and I'm now convinced Plagueis is somehow part of the story. When the question was asked, everyone literally froze like deer in headlights. No one moved a muscle or changed their gaze for a few seconds, as if they were all afraid that any reaction at all would give something away. None of them were prepared for that question and they all waited holding their breath for someone to take it. Daisy had a knee jerk reaction, and Kasdan (wisely) jumped in playing dumb to deflect her reaction and buy time. JJ clearly indicated the question was relevant by saying he didn't want to talk about the story too much, too soon, and then shut it down with the only choice he had, which was to lie and say ""no."" Watch Kennedy while JJ is talking: she's staring straight ahead trying to give no reaction but is as nervous as a cat. She is clearly relieved after he wraps up his answer.  I'm really not trying to upset people or beat a dead horse, but the way the panel reacted speaks volumes."""
StarWarsLeaks,3d3axr,Angelmv86,6,Mon Jul 13 12:18:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think you're spot on. JJ knew what was up and even admitted that Kasden was playing dumb. He said he didn't want to give anything away but in the end, all of their reactions give it up anyway. I'm willing to bet they're sticking to a lot of material that they can use from the previous movies so that the story arc in the new trilogy feels natural.   Tinfoil time; what if the artifact that Kylo is searching for is something used to resurrect Plagueis, perhaps even using Snoke as a host.   Alternatively, Snoke is a secret apprentice of Plagueis and sat back and amassed power and tried to find a way to.bring his old master back while Palpatine did the whole galaxy ruling deal, totally blind to what was going on."
StarWarsLeaks,3d3axr,arrownymous,2,Mon Jul 13 15:58:08 2015 UTC,"I am not a Plagueis zealot. However, I would have no problem if that were the direction this went. New villain vs terror from the past...I'm fine with both so long as they are handled well. That said, I recall somewhere reading that Kylo was a prince and the ""king"" was dying. (I admit the leaks and the real info is running together in very fun ways for me lately and I can't recall where that tidbit came from).  At any rate, we've seen in this saga already that fear of loss of loved ones make people turn to terrible, terrible options.  If the promise of immortality for his ailing king is the lure the ""essence"" of Plagueis offers to young Kylo. It could be a nice turn that Plagueis takes control of the ailing Snoke. There is a nice story line in there.  That said...I'd also be thrilled if it did turn out to be Maul. I don't think it will, but there is certainly a cyborg element there and an 85-ish year old Maul who has learned patience is...pleasantly terrifying."
StarWarsLeaks,3d3axr,JamesonRH,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:07:43 2015 UTC,"Awesome theories! here is my Tinfoil fix: but What if snoke was just like Darth maul, not your standard Sith, but a specialty ""Assasin"" sith that doesn't break the rule of 2...Trained by plageuis, unknown by palpatine...

StarWarsLeaks,3d3axr,kohji,7,Mon Jul 13 20:09:40 2015 UTC,The reaction to the Plagueis question at SDCC wasn't just a denial... It was like Abrams and Kasdan didn't even know who the guy was talking about. That's what made it so awkward. Pretty sure Darth Vegas won't be in the sequel trilogy.

In fact, the only thing I am sure of from that exchange is that both of them are familiar with the Darth Plagueis rumor. JJ refused to even discuss it. If he wanted to remove all doubt, he should have said something like ""I'm not sure who you're talking about, but its safe to say that character is not in the film."" Instead, we got Kasdan playing dumb, and JJ saying ""It's too early to talk about story... So I'm gonna say no."" (Paraphrased)."

(re watch episode 3) and there is a possibility they will hide him as the puppet master until ep. 8 but mention him in TFA like they did in ""A new hope"" with the emperor. Only mentioned on the death star, but not seen until ESB...  Now personally, the line "" There has been an awakening, The Dark Side (Plagueis) and the light (Luke, and the new kids) cant be explained by ANY other Sith or bad guy... only the one who can be re awakened... awakened from what? from death, or w/e form he is in at that point...."

I just read the Secret History Of Star Wars and George's outline for 7 8 9 and everything his said about them was that someone powerful who survives Ep. 3 lays low until trilogy after the OT.

As for Maul, he's not the type of character to try something like this, and he would be starting to really get up there in age assuming he is still alive during the new trilogy. And that last point is the thing that continues to give me hope about Plagueis (admittedly, I'm in favor of it, but I really just want a good story). Lucas had a plan, how much of that plan has been stuck to, we don't know. But the plan points to something of this ilk."

StarWarsLeaks,3d3axr,HenryChinaskiForPrez,2,Mon Jul 13 05:00:55 2015 UTC,"Have we ultimately and universally decided that Anakin was a virgin birth-conceived by the will of the Force, or was it manipulated By Plagueis?  Was Anakin truly the redeemer, or an instrument of the most patient type of revenge - knowing his former pupil would logically betray him and his apprentice's ultimate downfall was believing he could utterly dominate his master's creation?  That encompasses the entire arc of the six movies, and they are reaching the floor boss level in the Force - the master of the master of the creation.  Obviously, Luke would be of the notion that his father WAS the weaponized embodiment of the Force, and that he eventually brought balance in the end...but was his Sith turn an unexpected detour or his true destiny, only complicated by his forbidden love and marriage, the love for his unforseen children?    These kids present a real issue for Snoke (Plagueis) and his legitimate claim that this was his ultimate plan all along.  Luke and Leia must be dealt with (essentially the bastardized stepkids to his Force bloodline), and he's already got a new apprentice, could he also have been created?  Anakin 2.0?  Uncle Kylo?  I speak in a mock tone regarding the ""Force family tree"" here, but they all essentially share a claim as heirs to the ultimate power (of Plagueis) in a sense.    It does work."

In reality, Plagueis can be used at any point, and would be par for the course for the use of classic archetypes and literary deviced that the entire saga is built on.  There is also this neat little thing lots of people here do where they act like others insist they Plagueis IS the villain, when in fact they simply see that he is a character that works for a continuing saga.  Nothing has discounted that. Nothing.  Will we see him? Dont know.   Will we not? Dont know that either."

StarWarsLeaks,3cy5tl,terriblehuman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:47:18 2015 UTC,1) It definitely is Serkis 2) It definitely was his voice 3) Snoke seems to a snake/reptilian type according to some picture on the wall in the background of the behind the scenes clip recently released. 4) Highly force sensitive. 5) Speculating now... He and Kylo will be similar to Sidious and Vader in terms on vision and collaboration but perhaps not the same type of relationship.
StarWarsLeaks,3cy5tl,thebearcredentials,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:20:36 2015 UTC,"I wonder what name other characters will use to refer to him (ex. The Emperor vs Emperor Palpatine vs Darth Sidious).  The Snoke/snake thing is a little too spot on/cheeseball if he's actually snake like.  On that note, I'm also not so sure I'm fully on board with the character being reptilian.  I feel that creating emotions/ticks that would translate well as a super-evil-scary-villain on a mo-cap reptile would veer either stiff (godzilla) or unrealistic (in the physical/spacial/anatomical sense a la Jar Jar).  I'd be much less concerned about a Muun/Pau'an/Chiss/Zabrak type species for the apex villain.  Having humanesque physiology with warped/grotesque features like Maul or Sidious is, IMO, more identifiable and therefore scarier.  I do have high hopes for this film overall, especially it's various antagonists, and I'll reserve my judgement until we see a trailer/figure (or until December if they somehow plug all their leaks), but I'd be less apprehensive if the leaked info indicated Snoke was a more humanoid species.  A reptilian character like Bossk could be effective as a pursuer, when used in a jump scare, or in a physical fight against our human protagonists; I just don't see it working as an omnipresent, scheming, or all powerful entity.  Regardless of what Snoke looks like, it'll be awesome to see how Andy Serkis brings him (it?) to life!  I loved his voice in teaser#1."

The smooth ""Grand Prix Car"" shapes of the portruding pilot pod end abruptly in a mechanic's nightmare of engine and wing assembly.

Fast forward ~3-4 decades and we went through huge wars and political upheaval that caused a strange era in the 60's and 70's--much of the Brutalism is reflected in SW. Considering the extravagance of the rich planets benefiting off an entire galaxy, I can accept this and maybe consider that it wasn't enough. The civil war shredded everything and I'm hoping to see the rich planets in ruins akin to postwar Germany. So exciting."

StarWarsLeaks,3cxkq8,hectorlizard,3,Sat Jul 11 23:36:39 2015 UTC,"I like to think it had more to do with the resources available (as a canon explanation), not to mention different planets had different technologies and some planets like Naboo or Coruscant just were more affluent societies as a whole.  One of the few nice things about the special edition edits is that the end of RotJ seems to corroborate this explanation when we see each planet celebrating."
StarWarsLeaks,3cxkq8,radioactive2321,3,Sat Jul 11 21:48:13 2015 UTC,"The issue between the OT and PT graphics are simple. While they use identical designs in many ways, they used low res screens in the 70s/80s compared to the movies made for the PT (which all use obviously higher res devices). It was not canon historical designs differing, but current screen technology available at time of creation that seemed to make the big difference.   When you think about it, it is funny that a modern civilization specializing in space travel and technology in general had not mastered how to show a clean hologram or develop good screens. =P Whatever, who cares.

They look like two completely different universes and we're supposed to just accept that they're the same. The whole look of Star Wars was so unique and it's a shame that they just tried to cover up with shiny new looking stuff.

Personally, it seemed as if there was a lazy effort to try and connect the feel of the prequels with the sequels. Everything in the first three movies seems ""streamlined"". Shiny ships, slim gadgets, expensive looking hardware, etc. The sequels all seem to have a more 70's/80's feel to them. Everything is bulky, all the ships are matte, etc. (Similar to the Nostromo in Alien). With this new movie coming out, it really looks like they are putting in an effort to connect to the sequels.

After Finn gets tossed in the brig for insubordination during the village fire, he agrees to help Poe escape.    Once the two make off with the plans or whatever Leia sent Poe to find, that's when the hunt begins for them.

StarWarsLeaks,3cvagc,mytoemytoe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:24:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's just bad storytelling. Each movie should feel like a complete film, not setup for a sequel. The middle films usually have a cliffhanger, but it's it. They're all complete stories on an individual level. A movie where the plot revolves around people looking for Luke Skywalker and he only shows up at the last moment feels like a cheat. Once they find Luke, something has to happen. A New Hope is setup on the premise of saving Leia and getting the Death Star plans to the Rebels. But after that they have to blow up the Death Star. It doesn't end with them landing on Yavin IV and dropping off R2 like an USB drive.   You could probably structure a movie to have that ending. But the setup would need to something else. Maybe they all think Luke is dead and during the mission mysterious things happen. In the end Luke reveals himself and he was helping them the whole time."
StarWarsLeaks,3cvagc,kingfagit,2,Sat Jul 11 04:32:49 2015 UTC,I like that idea.
StarWarsLeaks,3cvagc,morning_drums,2,Sat Jul 11 05:21:00 2015 UTC,"You MIGHT be reading into it too much but you never know. It's easy to believe that certain characters (like Luke) were the only ones who got scripts for certain scenes. It's weird that Andy Serkis wasn't there but maybe he just couldn't make it. Or maybe they're not ready to introduce his character because they're still working on the CG. Sydow I think is playing a bit role and doesn't need or want the attention for playing such a minor part. But when you cast MVS in the film you have to announce it, no matter how big the role is."

Only his face was supposed to be CGI super-imposed. It was decided late in development that the entire actor would be replaced by CGI when it didn't quite work.
StarWarsLeaks,3cweps,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:41:32 2015 UTC,I think there is one scene where he's actually in the suit. It's the part where he grabs the tool between the pod racer engines.

They specifically said stormtroopers blowing up on a lava planet.  When you go back and actually look at what they showed, it was stormtroopers getting blown up around of a bunch of black, volcanic looking rocks.  While I guess its an easy mistake to make when you're trying to type fast also trying to pay attention for a live blog, that set is actually the same one that they show in the Force for Change video and also in the Phasma shot from VF.  I'd bet money that's actually the ruins of Maz Kanata's place from the imperial attack on it."

That is ridiculous.  3) StarWars.com links to MSW through the community page. Why would they link to a LEAKS website?   Edit: nothing im saying is flaming or off-topic, so chill with the downvotes already. Sorry you disagree."
StarWarsLeaks,3d0wio,thatstarwarsdude,6,Sun Jul 12 16:47:33 2015 UTC,"More like this sub has a MSW-hate fetish. Did you not see the disgusting ""Jason Ward fucked"" post that was never taken down, and how many people outright hate the guy as if he is somehow to blame for the movie not sounding exactly the way they want it to be.   On point one, how many more leaks do MSW need to get right before you'll believe them? So much they put out has later panned out.  On point two, no one knows how it will open yet. They could cut it differently between now and then. Just because you think something sounds stupid does not make it impossible.  On point three, starwars.com is run by a community-building team of Lucasfilm employees. The page you are describing contains links to numerous other fan sites and podcasts. That does not make them somehow part of lucasfilm. They are clearly fan sites and delineated as such. Their team is very friendly and I'm sure if you made your own starwars fan site and talked to Matt Martin on twitter (missingwords), you too could get your site linked there. Also MSW was not invited to do an official podcast on SWCA stage which may indicate further they are on to something"
StarWarsLeaks,3d0wio,dat_shit_gray,0,Sun Jul 12 17:09:59 2015 UTC,Oh that's why we don't like him! Yeah you're totally right; has nothing to do with his personality.
StarWarsLeaks,3d0wio,thatstarwarsdude,5,Sun Jul 12 18:15:02 2015 UTC,"Being an asshole doesn't make you wrong. I was specifically responding to the MSW hate that drives people to pull off mental gymnastics in order to convince themselves he's wrong. This thread is a perfect example: ""Lava planet! Therefore Jason is wrong!"" even though there is no evidence of a lava planet, and even if there was that doesn't invalidate any of his leaks. Also, the bandwagon behind barbells 00---00 guy was driven in part MSW hate and how he'd be wrong if barbells was right."
StarWarsLeaks,3d0wio,dat_shit_gray,0,Sun Jul 12 21:18:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but this thread was initially confusion on something that was reported in haste. Not born completely out of die hard hate for Jason Ward."
StarWarsLeaks,3d0wio,Gamefreak975,-5,Sun Jul 12 23:33:40 2015 UTC,"No one ever said he was part of Lucasfilm. If any of his leaks were accurate and this bothered Disney in the slightest, they would not link to his page from their community page.  You totally ignored all of my points while pretending that you refuted them.  Point 1: Disney is feeding him 50% bullshit and 50% non-important leaks like character descriptions and stills that they will release on their own eventually. This allows him to appear credible while also not revealing anything major about the movie.   Point 2: People are betting billions of dollars on this movie. It isn't simply that I don't like it, it is that a hand floating through space is the worst sort of fan fiction tier nonsense ever imagined.  Point 3: I never said he was part of Lucasfilm because of his community page. I said they would not link to his website if he was even halfway legitimate."
StarWarsLeaks,3d0wio,milligna,4,Sun Jul 12 19:13:26 2015 UTC,Nah. he' not that important and you sound freakin' deranged.
StarWarsLeaks,3d0wio,Gamefreak975,-2,Sun Jul 12 19:14:57 2015 UTC,What about what I said sounds deranged? Please elaborate rather than name calling
StarWarsLeaks,3d0wio,thatstarwarsdude,2,Sun Jul 12 19:21:26 2015 UTC,"So you're saying the only reason MSW is on the fan page is because they post illegitimate rumors. I think a simpler explanation is just that they're a fan page and that's why they are on there.  And how do you imagine the conversation going if they did remove MSW and Jason found out? ""LOL, sorry dude but you started posting real stuff about the movie, have to kick you off this  'really' important list of fan sites."" Come on.  Point 2: I agree it is shit-tier and personally think it wouldn't make it past a first cut of the film (if it is what they really had planned), but that doesn't mean it isn't true, nor does the stupidity of it somehow invalidate every other rumor that is posted. Honestly, at this point it is just your opinion against a widely-made rumor, one that didn't originate with MSW either. Equating it to being a mistake that somehow would affect the investment of  ""billions of dollars"" is being melodramatic.  Point 1: What makes for the simplest explanation, that there is an active conspiratorial disinformation campaign to plant a false story that seems more and more correct over time, or that he's getting real leaks? What do they have to gain from leaking a ""50% bullshit"" story with so many elements that you yourself admit are the ""worst sort of fan fiction tier nonsense ever imagined."" I think that would hurt their brand more than the one minute shot of a hand tumbling through space ever could. Occam's razor: the leaks are real.  What it comes down to is that you simply don't want him to be right and you're coming up with complicated reasons to explain it all away."

Then he decides to just name off another character and mentions Rey, not because she isn't Han and Leia's daughter, but because it's easy to mention Rey in the same thought as Finn.

StarWarsLeaks,3cvux7,nexusx86,2,Sat Jul 11 08:26:03 2015 UTC,"This is the most plausible explanation. He can act to a camera and a few dozen people on set that he sees regularly but maybe perhaps gets anxiety / butterflies for a crowd of a couple hundred (late show) to several thousand (sdcc) audience of complete strangers, regardless if they really love and support you."

StarWarsLeaks,3cvux7,Cap_Fordo,2,Sat Jul 11 06:54:58 2015 UTC,He isn't a showman or a vaudevillian type in the usual sense. Acting is something he seems to do in his free time.

StarWarsLeaks,3cvux7,flippwn,10,Sat Jul 11 07:07:56 2015 UTC,My guess is that he probably just couldnt say much about his character at all.

Also, he may just be a strange person. Not particularly charismatic, but nothing wrong with that.  I'd say its a combo of not wanting to give anything away + a bit of nervousness + just being weird."
StarWarsLeaks,3cvux7,mytoemytoe,-6,Sat Jul 11 16:30:27 2015 UTC,"Pure speculation fueled by how awkward he was at that panel and how he didn't even want to answer the question about his reaction to getting cast:  I get the sense he's not as into Star Wars as his fellow actors, but JJ Abrams and the casting director knew exactly what kind of actor they wanted for the character they had written and they knew Driver was it.   Driver is going to be set up for the rest of his life because of this film. You'd think he act a little more grateful outwardly but he seems like an intense and strange guy, and I think the character will be similar.  Also could just be a crowds thing, as the other comment mentions. But I've never seen him very excited talking about this movie, not like the other guys."

StarWarsLeaks,3cvux7,StarLordandSaviour,6,Sat Jul 11 16:31:25 2015 UTC,"Carrie Fisher is much funnier that I thought she'd be, Adam Driver seemed like he didn't really want to be there, and of course it's great to see Harrison Ford happy despite how he allegedly hates his character."
StarWarsLeaks,3cvux7,joshwolfe007,4,Sat Jul 11 06:20:51 2015 UTC,"couldn't agree more!  He looked like he was having fun.  I honestly found myself smiling so much during this, especially seeing how much fun it seemed like the old (and new) actors were having up there.  Cannot express how excited I am for this film!"
StarWarsLeaks,3cvux7,WhoahCanada,5,Sat Jul 11 06:27:25 2015 UTC,Harrison doesn't hate his character.  Have you ever seen him do a panel or convention for Bladerunner?  Indiana Jones?  Ender's game?  He just doesn't show up to those kind of things.  He's shy.  There is no indication that he ever hated playing Han.  He just doesn't jump at the chance to do extra-curricular things like Carrie and Mark.
StarWarsLeaks,3cvux7,terriblehuman,3,Sat Jul 11 10:29:57 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely. If you watch any talk show interview with Harrison Ford, you can tell he's really uneasy about being there."
StarWarsLeaks,3cvux7,toph1980,2,Sat Jul 11 16:06:11 2015 UTC,You can also tell he's really funny.
StarWarsLeaks,3cvux7,DrinkingJesusBlood,-5,Sat Jul 11 19:51:23 2015 UTC,It was an obvious contractual obligation. He is way more personal in candid non Star Wars interviews.   Every single question was obviously scripted. So we're their responses.

StarWarsLeaks,3cvux7,Killzark,6,Sat Jul 11 16:07:13 2015 UTC,He kind of look overwhelmed being there. Probably has social anxiety like Harrison Ford does.

StarWarsLeaks,3cvejd,kyrensolo,8,Sat Jul 11 03:18:29 2015 UTC,"NO. It has been stated several times he was not legit in that respect. He probably saw an early viewing two days before the film premiered (which is not uncommon, I sometimes get to see movies a full week before hand because there is a local theater that is failing and tries to make up for it that way), and that is when his ""scoops"" got ""leaked"". We found out that the guy that claimed his credibility is a liar on the cantina forum, and very likely an account for him."
StarWarsLeaks,3cvejd,GetUrNoJokeRapeOn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:22:20 2015 UTC,I see. Thanks for clearing that up. I'm kind of disappointed because for a time it seemed like 00---00 was legit; he seemed like an honest guy who was sincere in his comments. I guess all that's over now.

Sure you are embargoed from posting your review until like a couple of days from the release.   The inside out press screening was about a month in advance.
StarWarsLeaks,3cvejd,thatstarwarsdude,-1,Sat Jul 11 16:29:45 2015 UTC,I said forget it.
StarWarsLeaks,3cvejd,altgr_01,16,Sat Jul 11 03:40:28 2015 UTC,I'd be happy if we just stop talking about him or to him.

StarWarsLeaks,3cvejd,ugnaught,-1,Sat Jul 11 02:34:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, and personally I think the mods should do something about it. Not sure what, but we should have a discussion about what to do under these circumstances. The drama that has unfolded these last couple of days has been very unpleasant."
StarWarsLeaks,3cvejd,altgr_01,5,Sat Jul 11 02:35:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, can we just talk about Star Wars, please?"
StarWarsLeaks,3cvejd,jtobiska,8,Sat Jul 11 02:39:33 2015 UTC,"We delete probably 20-30 submissions a week from ""leakers"" that come in here talking nonsense.   Not sure what else we can really do other than remove obvious nonsense and ban users found to be purposefully spreading disinformation.   Really, and this will probably make me sound like a dick, the biggest part comes down to the user base not riding the jock of the next guy pretending to be in the know.    This guys story was so easy to pick apart and people still refused to listen to reason.  They wanted him to be a leaker.  Even with all the evidence pointing to the contrary.  People were saying stuff like ""I am praying that you are right"".   Not much the mods can do about that.   edit: But I should probably also thank the users that did see reason and remained skeptical.  We need more people like that."
StarWarsLeaks,3cvejd,ugnaught,3,Sat Jul 11 02:58:05 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. I guess I could see right through the lies and it was so frustrating to keep hearing about him everywhere. The only thing that comes to mind is to be harsher with the bans. But you bring up an excellent point, in this instance people wanted to believe him. You cant just ban him at the time, I think people would have rioted. Anyway, keep up the great work!"

They were always well reasoned, and courteous.  I feel like I've now seen this sub's true colors and I will be happy to leave you all with one less ""sheep"" or ""pubescent s#$@ fly""."
StarWarsLeaks,3cvejd,westsideozzie,5,Sat Jul 11 03:27:47 2015 UTC,I'm sorry you feel that way.  I certainly wasn't aiming this at anyone in particluar.    It's possible my wording was a little harsh.  I probably should have waited to post in the morning after getting some sleep on it.
StarWarsLeaks,3cvejd,morning_drums,2,Sat Jul 11 03:39:17 2015 UTC,"TBH ug, I feel like you've handled this whole thing pretty well as a mod by taking the time to backtrack his posts here and elsewhere and presenting your evidence of his growing exaggerations and fakery. It was more effort than most would have been willing to put in and that's appreciated.   I'll freely admit that I bought into his talk of being in marketing (on several occasions he made points which do suggest a certain level of general knowledge in that area) so I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt when it came to the projects and connections that he claimed and played the wait and see game as to whether his claims (which over the last week or so did start getting more outlandish and as you put it he reached the point of doubling down on his BS in the run up to Friday's panel).  Thanks for taking the time to do the research on his stories and lay it out for the sub. You've dealt with this situation far more maturely than some other members who've turned it into much more of a witch hunt with multiple threads dedicated to bashing not only 00 but also any other users who didn't immediately join their rallying call to boot him. If that attitude carries on from certain quarters I can see it becoming the next big problem this sub will have to deal with."
StarWarsLeaks,3cvejd,DinoDude23,2,Sun Jul 12 01:47:58 2015 UTC,"To be fair, most people didn't investigate his history on 2 forums like you did. I wouldn't say it was ""so easy"" to pick apart."
StarWarsLeaks,3cvejd,morning_drums,5,Sat Jul 11 16:28:20 2015 UTC,There is only ONE solution. NO insider leak posts WITHOUT concrete proof that is supplied to the mods and approved for posting by THEM. ANYTHING else MUST be presented as speculation.

He specifically kept coming back to the eyes. I want to say it was during a LOST panel at some point.   Well, in ESB, they super imposed the eyes of a chimpanzee onto a woman.   The point I'm trying to make here, is that on the wall are primate eyes and reptilian creatures. MSW just said he saw concept art of Snoke that had a high collar. Check out the collar on the dude in the lower right corner.   I think we're looking at a wall of inspiration for Snoke's final design."

StarWarsLeaks,3cwe4w,digduged,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:03:00 2015 UTC,"if the description is true, maybe he really wasn't on a diplomatic mission. if they're trying to steal some data, then having someone who's really good at flying would be useful for the get-away phase."

StarWarsLeaks,3cwe4w,butter_wizard,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:34:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah this was when people were basing character names from the code names given on set. For example, it was reported Hux was codenamed Tarkin due to the character style, Luke was codenamed Obi Wan Kenobi and other codenames such as uber were used.   By any means I'm not saying the synopsis is real as none of us actually know. However, what is stated seems to fit in with the footage of Poe in the behind the scenes footage but we could also say it might not be in relation to that rumoured synopsis, it could be later in the film.

StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,flourykettle,13,Sat Jul 11 10:53:49 2015 UTC,"I think we will have at least one son or daughter from the old ones, just something to tie in the trilogies and story."

The prequels made the universe so small with a akin making 3po, r2 being on the Queens ship, etc."
StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,nexusx86,8,Sat Jul 11 21:00:22 2015 UTC,"The problem is that none of those characters have anything to do with the first 3 movies. If they are going to call the movie episode 7, it has to continue the story of the first 6, which is the Skywalker family story. Everything that happens in the first 6 revolves around the Skywalkers. If they don't continue that trend, this new trilogy is basically a spin off."
StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,dathvada,3,Sat Jul 11 22:08:59 2015 UTC,"Also why would they reuse Luke's family based line if he wasn't delivering it to someone he's related to? It robs it of the thematic elegance and even relevance unless he's telling it to a son/daughter/niece/nephew. If he's not related to the person he's basically saying ""Yea, so force runs in my family. Oh you random stranger have that power too!"""
StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,Sempere,2,Sat Jul 11 22:17:24 2015 UTC,That line could have been exclusively for teaser 2. It doesnt mean it will show up in the movie for sure. A lot of movies have stuff cut together for trailers that does not make the movie. Visually and audibly.   I guess personally it wouldn't bother me any way except that the rumors might be wrong.  I like that idea that Disney could be feeding the leaks and leaking us bologna. As much as i love leaks it would be awesome to sit down and also have a few surprises left.
StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,nexusx86,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:24:08 2015 UTC,"Except Mark Hamil explicitly said that his echo was recorded specifically for the teaser. There's absolutely no reason to believe he says this to anyone in the new episode.  There's so many arcs that tie the trilogies together. Lucas might have relied on the Skywalker lineage to help tie those arcs together, but it's not unreasonable to assume that the trilogies have more to do with Anakin/Vader's legacy on the galaxy."
StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,lolzycakes,3,Sun Jul 12 05:46:59 2015 UTC,"The fact that they chose that specific line for the teaser means something. It doesn't matter that it won't be said in the movie. Nothing filmmakers do is by accident. You can't just pick a side story and use that to tie the trilogies together. It would be like making a sequel to TLOTR that takes place in middle earth, but doesn't have anything to do with the rings or Sauron. It would be a spin off. Also, the OT has a lot more to do with Luke's choices than Vader's. It would be hard to make the new trilogy about Vader's legacy if none of the central characters have anything to do with him."
StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,dathvada,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:05:22 2015 UTC,"Skywalker legacy can tie it. A new trilogy about the ""myth"" of skywalker.

StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,mytoemytoe,6,Sat Jul 11 15:22:32 2015 UTC,For Rey it could just mean she isn't Han and Leia's but Luke's where the mother's background would depend on the actress they picked.
StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,Jitan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:47:08 2015 UTC,"Or maybe they don't. Maybe Luke got with a woman in that 30 year span, she dies or it doesn't work out, kid grows up away from dad. Wife is nowhere to be found.  TLDR wife doesn't have to show up in the movie.   But Luke having a wife would be an interesting idea because we don't know how much of the Jedi way was passed down from kenobi and yoda. It's possible he didn't learn that its not allowed to take a wife or maybe he knows but didnt care about the rules (like daddy). They do like to echo things across the movies."

StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,DinoDude23,2,Sat Jul 11 19:41:59 2015 UTC,"It could be possible, but I'm not too sure.

Obi-Wan even mentioned it, ""You were my brother, Anakin!"" And he very much was in every way except biology. Their lineage stems from Qui-Gon, who was very much a father figure to both. Luke and Han, through their trials and tribulations together, were also very much like brothers.  Luke handing down the mantle of Jedi Master, even to someone unrelated, and a trio of three best friends whose adventures bring them as close as family is enough to satisfy me that Star Wars is still about all about family."

StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,Cap_Fordo,3,Sat Jul 11 12:26:05 2015 UTC,"Last names don't mean everything, I agree: Leia, after all, was an Organa who turned out to be a Skywalker. But the fact that NOBODY was given an OT surname does seem suggestive...  Also: I just realized that Oscar said that Poe Dameron was at the medal ceremony in ANH. So that's one lead confirmed to be un-related."
StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,Cap_Fordo,10,Sat Jul 11 12:41:35 2015 UTC,Oscar didn't say canonically that he was at the ceremony. He used it as an example that the heroes of Star Wars were the heroes of the real world for the characters.  I'm pretty sure he phrased it as an analogy and not as a fact.
StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,Cap_Fordo,0,Sat Jul 11 12:50:57 2015 UTC,"Well, what he said at 24:27 in the panel video was: ""Poe was probably at-- he was there watching on Yavin when the medal ceremony was happening, thinking 'I wanna be that. I wanna be a hero and I wanna take up that mantle.' And I think that's what he does.""  https://youtu.be/8fMx670jOnw?t=24m27s  That, to me, sounds less like an analogy and more like a definite possibility."

StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,TheDugat,0,Sat Jul 11 13:13:08 2015 UTC,"We'll definitely have to agree to disagree, especially since Oscar apparently said this to the Associated Press a few months back:   “What’s actually very interesting is that Yavin … at the end of the very first Star Wars … that last scene was shot in Guatemala and you know, I think that Poe Dameron is from that planet … and that’s a beautiful coincidence,” Isaac said.   http://www.ew.com/article/2015/05/07/star-wars-oscar-isaac-poe-dameron-yavin-star-wars"
StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,Aequitassb,2,Sat Jul 11 13:26:10 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Yeah, that's interesting and kinda supports your theory but again, if Poe was a child who watched the Yavin Ceremony that puts him in his near 40s and that just doesn't make sense.  I think it could be that he heard stories and watched the reruns or whatever of that ceremony and it inspired him."
StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,Aequitassb,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:01:23 2015 UTC,"Oscar Isaac is 36. If Poe Dameron is the same age, and TFA takes place approximately 30 years after ROTJ, his character could have been a small child watching the medal ceremony on Yavin."
StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,Chuck006,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:52:03 2015 UTC,"I have to admit you actually made a very plausible case for the claim you're making. TFA will be set at least 34 years after the medal ceremony in ANH so it isn't all that impossible to think he was a small child then watching the events. So I retract my previous rebuttal. This is becoming much more in your favor. With that said, well done sir, well done."
StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,mytoemytoe,2,Sat Jul 11 15:41:12 2015 UTC,If they were trying to retcon Poe being at the medal ceremony in ANH they have some serious explaining to do why he hasn't aged the almost 40 years that have passed.  You're reading too much into it. u/Cap_Fordo is right. It's a simple analogy.   Edit: u/flourykettle may actually be right. It's not a stretch for Poe to have been a small child during the medal ceremony since TFA will be set at least 34 years after ANH.
StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,RNAPII,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:33:45 2015 UTC,Definitely sounds like headcanon to me. Isaac has said a few different things that infer he likes coming up with personal background stories for his characters.
StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,SwinginSam,2,Sat Jul 11 19:37:20 2015 UTC,"I do think you're right, that he decided on his own character's backstory to help inform his acting. His planet of origin is probably never mentioned in TFA.  But, it then stands to reason that he must have no cause to believe his character is NOT from Yavin IV either. And no cause to believe Poe WASN'T at the medal ceremony.  If Poe is revealed to be Leia, Han, or Luke's child in TFA, why would Oscar have chosen a headcanon that makes that impossible?"

StarWarsLeaks,3cwhlz,rubbishmyjunk,3,Sun Jul 12 21:25:21 2015 UTC,"That isn't what I took away from his statement. I think he honestly just meant that his character looked up to Han and Luke, and also he is from the place they filmed the first one so it's a theory of his. I think he was just randomly talking.   I think it's kind of. RedundNt point, but so is this sub if you think hard enough about it.   Interesting theory."

I can't think of a single tangible leak (concept art, costumes, etc.) from places like MSW that turned out to be total bullshit. The stuff that is likely BS though are all these ""insiders"" making outrageous claims about plot details and things like that."
StarWarsLeaks,3cvc3g,briancasey,2,Sat Jul 11 13:49:01 2015 UTC,The eyes look much bigger in the Teaser. Is she wearing goggles?
StarWarsLeaks,3cvc3g,Wombat_H,12,Sat Jul 11 02:09:44 2015 UTC,They might actually be different characters.
StarWarsLeaks,3cvc3g,SugarcaneRain,10,Sat Jul 11 02:10:09 2015 UTC,Given how short Maz seems in trailer two--if those are Maz's hands of course--my guess would be that it's not Maz but one of the various aliens in her castle.
StarWarsLeaks,3cvc3g,VadersHelmetPolish,4,Sat Jul 11 02:12:39 2015 UTC,"That shot in the BTS footage shows the practical head on top of a real performer's head, which would make this character a lot taller than the short alien handing the sabre to Leia in teaser 2.  No doubt that it confirms MSW's leak of the concept art piece itself, but looks like he guessed wrong about that being a design for Maz."
StarWarsLeaks,3cvc3g,rubbishmyjunk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:14:25 2015 UTC,"I agree. They're definitely different, and I tend to think this one is not Maz, but she's the other one."

I'd wager it's earlier concept art that got recycled. There was a piece shown more recently where it was green and still didn't have the big eyes, but looked like a later iteration of what became what we glimpsed in the trailer."
StarWarsLeaks,3cvc3g,CSMcCringleberry,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:28:51 2015 UTC,There using mocap to enhance the puppets expressions and facial movements. Check out 39 seconds in the new video.
StarWarsLeaks,3cvc3g,The4thSniper,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:07:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Concept art costs money.  MSW mentioned that the piece was checked off to be included in the film.  That doesn't mean it's Maz, but clearly it's been included in the film."
StarWarsLeaks,3cvc3g,rubbishmyjunk,2,Sat Jul 11 03:54:52 2015 UTC,Are we sure that either this alien or the alien in the teaser are Maz Kanata? They're definitely different characters either way.
StarWarsLeaks,3cvc3g,Wombat_H,4,Sat Jul 11 02:10:35 2015 UTC,"What we do know for a fact is that Lupita's character is named Maz Kanata, and Lupita did face capture."
StarWarsLeaks,3cvc3g,Octus,2,Sat Jul 11 02:29:34 2015 UTC,"The one in the BTS is 100% her. Looks identical to concept art. The one in the trailer was assumed to be her because it looked similar, but now we don't know."
StarWarsLeaks,3cvc3g,RexpowerColt42,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:12:50 2015 UTC,"The way I took it was the one MSW said was Maz Kanata concept art, wasn't.  He may have just been mistaken. It was another denizen of the ""cantina"" scene, which we actually see more fleshed out in the SDCC peek."

StarWarsLeaks,3cvc3g,lolzycakes,7,Sat Jul 11 02:12:55 2015 UTC,They might be different creatures. But my point was that it matches the concept art from MSW.
StarWarsLeaks,3cvc3g,Galact_ca,-7,Sat Jul 11 02:13:51 2015 UTC,"dont downvote people who disagree with you OP, it clearly not MAZ unless she is going to be talking out of her belly.  its not Maz so it does not matter if there different creatures.  Your post says its maz."

StarWarsLeaks,3cvc3g,iamtherealmrb,7,Sat Jul 11 02:52:20 2015 UTC,Yeah buts it's not Maz. It's a random alien

StarWarsLeaks,3cvc3g,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,5,Sat Jul 11 03:42:43 2015 UTC,Because it clearly isn't a mo cap character.
StarWarsLeaks,3cvc3g,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,0,Sat Jul 11 04:07:19 2015 UTC,But they show a puppet being controlled by mocap in this same video.  It probably isn't Maz but I'm not going to say that for sure yet

StarWarsLeaks,3cw38v,Cap_Fordo,8,Sat Jul 11 07:04:11 2015 UTC,I don't think the vaping alien is Maz Kanata

And the discussion was already starting on the Cantina forums about Kylo Ren being the focus because of clues deduced from the emoji.   After that was before 00----00 made his post here on Reddit.   So it was already a logical conclusion to some that Kylo would be a focus.  Much the same way the new BB8 twitter emoji was indicative of the focus during celebration."
StarWarsLeaks,3cuebz,ugnaught,2,Fri Jul 10 21:46:03 2015 UTC,"So if other people's saying it, and he's saying he's witnessed it first hand, what's the argument?"
StarWarsLeaks,3cuebz,NoNamedSheriff,8,Fri Jul 10 22:05:42 2015 UTC,The argument is that he hasn't seen it first hand as nobody has seen the Star Wars panel yet.   He is just making the same deductions based upon twitter clues that everyone else on the internet is making today.   Except for some reason people are convinced his deductions are insider knowledge.   Other people here are starting to realize it.  It isn't just me.
StarWarsLeaks,3cuebz,ugnaught,-1,Fri Jul 10 22:10:43 2015 UTC,He said:   There is a reason Kylo Ren's lightsaber is an emoji on Twitter today. This day is his.   The latest hashtag only further confirms his claims earlier today.
StarWarsLeaks,3cuebz,NoNamedSheriff,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:12:29 2015 UTC,The quote you mention has nothing to do with the new emote. He never said anything about Kylo Ren's mask. He said his light saber. Not trying to start anything but this doesn't in any way confirm his claims.

The ones we see chasing the MF through the SSD don't have that red side or the turret underneath the cockpit, but the one we see shooting at Storm Troopers in the hanger definitely does.  Is the red side indicative of rank? A special pilot?  Also, I totally just noticed that one of the ships in the hanger has the same engines as the ones escorting Kylo's ship to the new star destroyer only moments later in the teaser. Is Kylo Ren on board when this TIE is stolen? Maybe Kylo captures Poe and/or Finn, brings them onto the ship and they escape from under him?  Tinfoil at maximum density."

And as for disappointing the fans, EW did make it abundantly clear in its article earlier this week that there would be no new footage or trailer for The Force Awakens at the panel.  So, unless J.J./Lucasfilm/Disney was lying to them and, hence, to us by extension, people probably shouldn't have been getting their hopes up.

StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,ryaner93,30,Fri Jul 10 02:23:23 2015 UTC,I'd rather get nothing if we're not gonna get a trailer. I mean what's the point of seeing the behind the scenes of scenes we've never even seen the front of?
StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,StarLordandSaviour,6,Fri Jul 10 02:57:41 2015 UTC,That is an EXCELLENT point.

StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,meinsaft,93,Fri Jul 10 03:21:38 2015 UTC,"They show a screening of the fully armed and operational (completed) film Star Wars: The Force Awakens.  The audience sits slack jawed as they watch 2 hours of the most thrilling, heart warming, heart wrenching, romantic, exciting, dramatic, and funny movie - all set in the Star Wars universe.  When the credits roll the sound of applause thunders throughout SDCC.  Grown men are on the floor weeping in joy.  Grown women are hugging strangers and asking them to help conceive children born on this greatest day. A resident of Israel, who has been periscoping the event to his people, announces that his nation has made peace with the Arab nations.  ""When one lives in a world of such beauty as can create a film such as this, all our peoples realized to ugly it with war and conflict is the greatest sin imaginable.""  Tears flow freely.....but not all tears are an evil.  Out walks Kathleen Kennedy.  She's a hero.  Misty eyed, the audience looks on enraptured by her steely yet friendly gaze.  ""Do you want to see the director of this amazing film?!?!""  ""Yes!!!!!! Where's JJ?!?!""  The crowd hoots and hollers as the curtain is drawn back.  ""We have a surprise for you!"" Kathleen yells into her BB-8 themed bullhorn. ""The director of this movie WAS NOT JJ Abrams!""  Dead silence.  ""What the fuck?!?!"" yells one middle aged neckbeard with a shocking lack of decorum.  Grown women are fainting in the aisles....all thoughts of a Star Wars conception the furthest from their minds.  Grown men stumble about in a stupor. ""This life means nothing"" says one young fan, a light trace of stubble darkening his perfectly masculine jaw.  Kathleen asks for quiet.  ""I know it's a shock to you.  It was a shock to me.  But let's not wait any longer.  You know this man.  Ladies and gentlemen, the director of Star Wars: The Force Awakens!!""  Out steps......George mother fucking Lucas.  ""What's up bitches? How do you like me NOW?! Fuck yeah!""  The roar from the crowd is so overpowering that every single person in that room dies that day.  No matter.  Their lives merely token sacrifices at the altar of everlasting greatness."

Which perpetuates everything further."
StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,LograysTaint,2,Fri Jul 10 04:32:08 2015 UTC,More like I'm blown away everyone is skeptical about anonymous plot details but listen to the first damn anonymous source that says no new trailer.

StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,Sydeswipe,7,Fri Jul 10 03:55:56 2015 UTC,"Not really, both are a few years after the prequels. Rebels is about 15 years after ROTS, Luke is roughly the same age as Ezra.

StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,Drunkenmunkey,4,Fri Jul 10 02:27:00 2015 UTC,I wonder if an opening crawl counts as footage technically? Because if it does we won't be seeing it.
StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,Cap_Fordo,4,Fri Jul 10 03:01:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think we will see Snoke in any marketing. He's probably a minor character for now, pulling strings, akin to the Emperor in Episode 5, or more recently, Thanos in GotG. And they probably want to keep his appearance a secret, because there is no way he looks normal."
StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,saundini,7,Fri Jul 10 02:31:16 2015 UTC,"People seem to think its going to be disappointing, but I have a feeling we could get some really great stuff. Maybe most if not all the [main] characters revealed along with some new vehicles/weapons/planets. If they show us a good amount of stuff like that (maybe some final concept art too) it will make me almost as happy as a trailer would. And anyways, I don't think the trailer is too far off. So this just needs to tide us over."
StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,speculationposter2,2,Fri Jul 10 02:32:49 2015 UTC,"I just realized how cool it would be if the whole (main) cast came out in costume. Especially Captain Phasma, cause that armor is sexy as hell."

StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,LograysTaint,8,Fri Jul 10 02:47:54 2015 UTC,"It's sexy in that it looks cool, like Boba Fett and the First Order Stormtroopers.  Boba's armor is sexy no matter who is underneath."

Maybe a few new character (Gleeson, MVS) or planet names.   No trailer. Maybe even no footage at all."
StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,bogidyboy,5,Fri Jul 10 03:18:13 2015 UTC,I'm all about Harrison Ford but he generally is a grumpy ass poor interview when it comes to stuff like this.
StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,HenryChinaskiForPrez,3,Fri Jul 10 04:34:04 2015 UTC,I would agree but multiple sources have specifically stated that Harrison was very enthusiastic and energetic throughout the filming of TFA so maybe he'll show that same spirit with the press? One can hope :)
StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,riskbreaker23,2,Fri Jul 10 05:24:40 2015 UTC,"He was never a huge fan of the Han Solo character, and he typically only makes Star Wars-related appearances on behalf of charities, if at all. He's not really into playing along with the whole ""fan hype"" thing, which is fine. It's just not his style."
StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,HenryChinaskiForPrez,2,Fri Jul 10 06:01:06 2015 UTC,"I mean, he's usually grumpy because he's trying promote whatever current bullshit he's in and doe-eyed reporters just want Han Solo/Indiana Jones to tell them a story. It bugs me, too, but I GET it. Like at the time, he was the third-billed star after Guiness and Cushing, and now almost 40 years later it's still the biggest thing he's ever done."
StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,Samuraistronaut,2,Fri Jul 10 06:00:38 2015 UTC,That's less of a statement of his career and more of a statement on just how massive and successful star wars is/was.
StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,LograysTaint,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:06:14 2015 UTC,"Oh totally, but I can imagine how that would get annoying, especially if it's a project he's really excited about or something.   Ford: ""This film was deeply personal and....""  Interviewer: ""So, about Star Wars......"""
StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,stealthboy,2,Fri Jul 10 17:05:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I really don't care or understand the hype around him showing up.

StarWarsLeaks,3cr12k,bogidyboy,2,Fri Jul 10 12:59:26 2015 UTC,Agreed.  It's just going to be cringe-worthy.  At least they won't have that idiot of a host they had on stage with Celebration.

It will be interesting if they announce plans for his character to cross over into the anthology series; as I have been wondering if he was a former force who was dealt with by Yoda and the Old Republic order, maybe as his trial to ascend to the rank of knight or master.  If he's not Plagueis, he's going to be rooted somewhere else to make money from.  In that vein, I'd also expect more definition on the ever-unfolding anthology series, even after Solo's was announced earlier in the week.  More teaser info on Rogue One.  Not naive enough to expect a new full length trailer, that's going to explode at Disney's D23 Con in August, IMO."

StarWarsLeaks,3cpzsr,Gamefreak975,2,Fri Jul 10 15:11:41 2015 UTC,"Yea, that was always odd to me as well. But the biggest give away? When that first concept image of Kylo Ren landed online, it was hit with take down requests within 24-48 hours. MSW posts images which seem to be from an unreleased trailer, nothing happens.  I've written at length before that he's part of a disinformation campaign, but these things adding up really seem to be hinting at it more and more with each passing day.  Even posting shot lists and other things would be grounds for them to file against the site - The Terminator Genisys twist debacle sets precedent of a studio swooping in to request removal of information.

Uprising takes place immediately posy-Jedi, while this is described as a bit before TFA Uprising is contained to the Anoat Sector, whereas the first descriptions of the Aftermath novel refer to different situations in different pieces of a splintered empire.

Poe would grow up resenting Han Solo for leaving his mother and treating her poorly, but he wouldn't know he is his father. That's why he's following them around the whole movie - he meets Finn and Rey on Jakku but is pissed they're running around with Solo.   It's only later that he finds out that he was Han's son all along.

Of all the relationships that have been speculated on, the only one really confirmed so far is that Leia tells Poe to go on a mission.

But above the remote planet Akiva, an ominous show of the enemy’s strength is unfolding. Out on a lone reconnaissance mission, pilot Wedge Antilles watches Imperial Star Destroyers gather like birds of prey circling for a kill, but is taken captive before he can report back to the New Republic leaders.  Meanwhile, on the planet’s surface, former Rebel fighter Norra Wexley has returned to her native world — war weary, ready to reunite with her estranged son, and eager to build a new life in some distant place. But when Norra intercepts Wedge Antilles’s urgent distress call, she realizes her time as a freedom fighter is not yet over. What she doesn’t know is just how close the enemy is—or how decisive and dangerous her new mission will be.  Determined to preserve the Empire’s power, the surviving Imperial elite are converging on Akiva for a top-secret emergency summit — to consolidate their forces and rally for a counterstrike. But they haven’t reckoned on the Norra and her newfound allies — her technical genius son, a Zabrak bounty hunter, and a reprobate Imperial defector — who are prepared to do whatever they must to end the Empire’s oppressive reign once and for all."

When the trailer is released, give the mod the password Then the mod can screencap the email and post it here, or simply ban you"
StarWarsLeaks,3ctnj8,arrownymous,7,Fri Jul 10 18:18:26 2015 UTC,boom. good idea.
StarWarsLeaks,3ctnj8,morning_drums,35,Fri Jul 10 18:52:10 2015 UTC,"While we would be more than happy to do that it just isn't going to happen.    He knows the jig is up.  His only play is to say that there is a trailer and then hope against hope that there is one.   Even if there is a trailer his house of cards is crumbling down.  The account over on the cantina forums that was his ""proof"" for the Jurassic World leaks was proven to be lying.  Specifically caught creating fake leaks then creating user accounts on Reddit and linking back and forth to try and get some of his lies to catch on.   There is no record of him providing accurate leaks for Jurassic World outside of this one user on the Cantina forums.  Who is now known to be less than truthful.  And the bunk user on the Cantina forums known for creating bunk Reddit accounts specifically liked to talk about marketing and its relation to the movie.  Weird.  This has been quite an elaborate web of lies.  I will be glad to put it all behind us.  I just hope the sub won't be so quick to believe the next ""leaker"" that comes around.   Edit: But as I said in the current sticky, we need to remain civil about this.  No witch hunting or tons of threads regardless of which way it goes.    Edit2: Here is a great example of how he is grasping at straws in this very thread.  He couldn't be any more obvious at this point.  I am begging with the sub, even if there is a trailer tonight we all have understand that we don't have any active leakers in the sub."
StarWarsLeaks,3ctnj8,bogidyboy,11,Fri Jul 10 18:29:04 2015 UTC,You really think someone would do that? Go on the Internet and tell lies?
StarWarsLeaks,3ctnj8,arrownymous,3,Fri Jul 10 21:05:28 2015 UTC,Well I thought I'd at least show a way he could prove himself. If he wants to maintain any credibility this is the way to do it.    Mind you another big red flag is that he says he was prohibited from discussing the existence of the trailer until a specific time that was well before the release of the trailer. Which totally defeats the purpose of denying the trailer's existence.
StarWarsLeaks,3ctnj8,bh1138,11,Fri Jul 10 18:40:10 2015 UTC,"Even if there is a trailer, which I sincerely want there to be, I'm not going to believe him or take it as proof that he was right. He gambled on the logical assumption everybody made and had no choice but to stick to it since he already put it out there publicly.   The holes people have poked in his credibility are enough for me, and nothing he's posted since the EW article make any sense. Like this, for example. Before we were told there would be no trailer, he firmly stated that he was seeing one but couldn't offer details. So apparently this ""NDA"" that he was going to have to sign didn't cover the existence of a trailer, just it's contents. And then he spent the last couple of days dancing around the issue. And now, this BS NDA expires in parts, one part of it is up for no apparent reason 6.5 hours before the panel, and it apparently did prevent him from explicitly saying trailer even though he already did so?  He got hungry for attention, made a seemingly safe assumption, and then got burned on it. In the words of Qui-Gon Jinn, ""Whenever you gamble, my friend, eventually you lose."""
StarWarsLeaks,3ctnj8,emphram,3,Fri Jul 10 18:57:05 2015 UTC,Exactly. Beautifully reasoned.
StarWarsLeaks,3ctnj8,CSMcCringleberry,2,Fri Jul 10 19:01:15 2015 UTC,"The confirmation process that /u/arrownymous put up is a pretty good idea if they dude will play along, which he honestly should.  The thing that gets me is that I can't think of a reason for him to keep at it if he's pulling it out of his ass.  Nearly all of the other fakers drop off the face of the earth when it becomes obvious.  I can see the argument for him seeking attention, and that all publicity is good publicity, but this seems to go beyond those ends justifying these means. On the other hand, my gut tells me that there will be a significant presentation of information about the movie (maybe even the first 10 minutes as has been rumored), but it really won't be a standard trailer.  The EW guy did SWCA, but he's not doing this one, and putzing around with fan expectations (in order to surpass them) would seem like something of a wise move from marketing.  So it's cognitive dissonance for the next couple of hours.  Dude's held on way longer than even the most dedicated troll, or LFL might put in a bullshit effort at this one, which is also highly unlikely."
StarWarsLeaks,3ctnj8,ugnaught,4,Fri Jul 10 19:04:47 2015 UTC,"I can't think of a reason for him to keep at it if he's pulling it out of his ass   I can't think of a good reason why any of them do what they do.    It would seem as if he is just doubling down on the trailer thing in hopes that he hits it big.  And then rides that ""win"" for a little more adulation in this sub.  I don't think there is any grand plan to what he is doing.  He actually started off normal enough in this sub.  He even asked to be a mod in here at one point.  Then after that whole Jurassic Park thing (which is now quite questionable) he got a lot of confidence.    There was a bunch of talk about a trailer a couple of weeks ago from all angles. He didn't start that talk.  And that was when he claimed that he had friends that were going to get him in to see the trailer early. That was followed up by the news that there was no trailer at SDCC which kind of left him with his dick in his hand.   Now he is putting all his chips on black in hopes that it hits.   Why?  I don't know. He has made it clear that he likes the attention.  If I had to guess I would say it is related to that."

If you're wrong, your account will be banned, so you lose nothing by deleting it. If you get lucky and they happen to release a trailer, that still doesn't prove you are legit.

He likes to pretend to be a leaker.  He also creates reddit accounts and links back and forth to them to pretend that there is something going on.

If there is a trailer, whether it's in outright defiance of his article or still true on some bullshit technicality (low down boo over), it blows his piece to shit, taints him as a credible source to his readers, and burns a bridge to a decent-profile writer at a big publication.  Maybe he has a shit source and was willing to risk it just for some cheap hits and the bragging rights of knowing first.   Maybe he was in on the gag and thought it was somehow clever.   Maybe plans changed?  All possible. What is LIKELY is that the EW article represents the truth, we will get a big hall H show with no footage but some other decent reveals, and life goes on, I guess.   Another question: Why would they blow a major trailer reveal at what is essentially 530 pm east coast? What worthwhile buzz or coverage will it generate?"
StarWarsLeaks,3ctnj8,stealthboy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:36:36 2015 UTC,"I'm taking any sides either, and ya'll will probably downvote the hell out of this reply. But looking back through the Star Wars and Bad Robot twitter feeds they made no mention of there not being a trailer/teaser tonight during the panel. Now I don't know if it has been brought up already on here or another post, but don't you think that either one of those would make that announcement instead of a magazine? I mean this coming from the same guy who wrote the article about Rey being Obi-Wans granddaughter, which could be plausible. And Finn being Han's son, not likely as plausible. I know that the author moderated the SWCA TFA panel, but he could have been mislead. Who knows? I've gotten my hopes before and then I rewatched TPM in my 20's. So right now anything could happen.

Perhaps what he has told is us true, from a certain point of view.  Edit: spelling"
StarWarsLeaks,3ctnj8,riskbreaker23,2,Fri Jul 10 18:11:08 2015 UTC,"I'm leaning towards this being right.  /u/00-----00 is too adamant with nothing to gain about this. If he was lying, he'd be doing it to get everyone to like him. Instead, everyone is hating on him yet he keeps returning and getting involved. Second, obviously EW is a reliable source. Third, the SW app out of nowhere becomes a big deal.  My prediction, there is no trailer or new footage at SDCC. They announce that there is an exclusive teaser or short film available via the SW app and will soon be additionally available via YouTube.  This lines up with everything we've been hearing from everyone.  Hell, the first line in EW's article is ""“Your eyes can deceive you. Don’t trust them.” So says Obi-Wan Kenobi"".

StarWarsLeaks,3cma7z,gr8b8m88outof8,9,Thu Jul 9 01:39:06 2015 UTC,I hope that the Resistance is a cell within the First Order that is funded by the New Republic.  Maybe there is a Cold War between the NR and the Empire (now first order after being reunited?)    I wonder if the 'resistance' will just be around for the first movie until a full on war breaks out.

StarWarsLeaks,3cma7z,Jjustice1041,5,Thu Jul 9 00:42:07 2015 UTC,"This Aftermath synopsis is pretty interesting to say the least!   -Star Wars: Aftermath (Del Rey), written by Chuck Wendig  As the Empire reels from its critical defeats at the Battle of Endor, the Rebel Alliance — now a fledgling New Republic — presses its advantage by hunting down the enemy’s scattered forces before they can regroup and retaliate. But above the remote planet Akiva, an ominous show of the enemy’s strength is unfolding. Out on a lone reconnaissance mission, pilot Wedge Antilles watches Imperial Star Destroyers gather like birds of prey circling for a kill, but is taken captive before he can report back to the New Republic leaders.  Meanwhile, on the planet’s surface, former Rebel fighter Norra Wexley has returned to her native world — war weary, ready to reunite with her estranged son, and eager to build a new life in some distant place. But when Norra intercepts Wedge Antilles’s urgent distress call, she realizes her time as a freedom fighter is not yet over. What she doesn’t know is just how close the enemy is—or how decisive and dangerous her new mission will be.  Determined to preserve the Empire’s power, the surviving Imperial elite are converging on Akiva for a top-secret emergency summit — to consolidate their forces and rally for a counterstrike. But they haven’t reckoned on the Norra and her newfound allies — her technical genius son, a Zabrak bounty hunter, and a reprobate Imperial defector — who are prepared to do whatever they must to end the Empire’s oppressive reign once and for all."

It's fine as books but we're seeing it start with films like Han Solo. Soon there will be a Greedo movie and a Wedge Antilles movie and a young Lando movie and a movie that took place between ANH and ESB starring Leia and Chewie. Or maybe it's just me."
StarWarsLeaks,3cma7z,BullshitUsername,4,Thu Jul 9 01:00:59 2015 UTC,"This has been going on for decades.  That's exact what Shadows of the Empire was- a series of multimedia releases entailing what happens to certain characters between episodes 4-6.  Same with Clone Wars and Rebels. Stories between the episodes are nothing new. There have been many books, games and TV shows.  Now all they're doing is just giving us a new medium for these stories- high budget theatrical experiences. The Episodes will still be intact."
StarWarsLeaks,3cma7z,StarLordandSaviour,4,Thu Jul 9 01:30:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the good thing was that you could dismiss it. I, as well as many other people, only care about the films. The EU was great because it allowed for the people who were hungry for more SW content to have access to it. But let's face it, if you made a movie about a cloned Palpatine, or whatever other ridiculous, glorified fan fiction makes up the EU, it would be trash, and it would also detract from the original films. But that's just my two cents.  Same goes with Rebels and Clone Wars. Disney can say that Ashoka is canon, but most people would agree that no, Anakin didn't have an apprentice.   I don't want to know what happened to Han before ANH. Let the viewer decide, because it doesn't matter. I don't want to know how Boba Fett came to be, the mystery that surrounds him is his best part. Don't shove characters into movies based on the fact that people like them, because it can destroy the artistic integrity of their story.   Star Wars is a vast universe of endless wonderful possibilities. Tell a new story for Pete's sake."

StarWarsLeaks,3cma7z,Jitan,2,Thu Jul 9 23:50:45 2015 UTC,"I don't want Star Wars to go down the path of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Every film in the MCU is formulaic and uninspired. The Marvel movies aren't films as art, they are films as a product. I don't know about you but I much prefer films as art, and I believe Star Wars films have been art for the past 30 years or so. The MCU is entirely forgettable, and that's what Star Wars will become. Soon, Star Wars won't be special. It'll be another peg on the Hollywood machine, and it makes me sad to think about.   Telling the backstory of every character cheapens them. You know what Obi-Wan did while on Tatooine? Nothing. He was a hermit who hid around watching Luke grow up. That's what I think. Maybe you think something different. But if we get a trilogy of Obi-Wan films, then both of our personal backstories are rendered void. And instead we get some generic blockbusters about how Obi-Wan secretly dueled with a Sith or something. I don't want that.   I know I'll get downvoted for this but I'm speaking my mind anyway. What you call enrichment of the Star Wars universe, I call the cheapening of the great original story."
StarWarsLeaks,3cma7z,RealVoltar,2,Thu Jul 9 07:04:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The last 30+ years of the previous continuity didn't destroy anything, just gave more ways to enjoy the universe and broadened the experience for people who wanted it.

StarWarsLeaks,3cma7z,Seryan_Klythe,-1,Thu Jul 9 01:03:00 2015 UTC,They are just trying to build it back up. Majority of younger people probably only know Star Wars by the prequels and might not be interested in seeing them if that's what they're expecting. Once they build up an audience by kinda revisiting the original movies then we will start seeing riskier takes on the setting - like Old Republic stuff or post RotJ not based around existing characters. It's like with the Marvel movies. You get the movies based around members of the Avengers which are normally good and entertaining but then you get something like Guardians of the Galaxy which is completely different.

StarWarsLeaks,3cm34y,dathvada,2,Thu Jul 9 14:40:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  That's what I was thinking when he said a play on words:  No ""Trailer"", but rather ""Teaser #3"".  But the EW article said ""no trailer and no clips"".  So isn't a teaser considered clips?  We shall see, and I am pulling for that 180 degree turnaround in a couple of days."
StarWarsLeaks,3cm34y,JohnJay721,4,Thu Jul 9 14:47:25 2015 UTC,"Based upon what he said, ""something is getting shown"", it could be literally anything.   Teaser.  Trailer.  Behind the scenes videos.

StarWarsLeaks,3cm34y,ugnaught,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:53:09 2015 UTC,"Relax man. People just want to believe that there will be a trailer, and since he hasn't been 100% proven wrong yet people are still giving him the benefit of the doubt. Also he has been a regular user on this sub and others for a long time, so people trust him. I think he is lying too but I hope he isn't."
StarWarsLeaks,3cm34y,dathvada,-3,Thu Jul 9 14:56:43 2015 UTC,"since he hasn't been 100% proven wrong    But he has been wrong about stuff.  This was his original Jurassic World post.  It is almost 100% wrong.   And he has said..   I fancy myself as a damn good plot sniffer. I can generally see twists coming from miles ahead and am good at putting pieces together. I'm fairly certain I already know how Jurassic World will play out   Everything else he says is just vague.  ""they will show something"".  Yeah, no kidding.  They will show ""something""."
StarWarsLeaks,3cm34y,ugnaught,2,Thu Jul 9 15:01:20 2015 UTC,"But that Jurassic World post is just speculation. He never claimed it was fact. He even said it was based on the trailers. I agree he is being really vague with this ""Something"" bs and he is most likely lying but people are being irrational because they want to believe there will be a trailer."
StarWarsLeaks,3cm34y,dathvada,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:05:16 2015 UTC,But that Jurassic World post is just speculation. He never claimed it was fact.    So why is he presenting incorrect theories while simultaneously saying that he has an NDA with Jurassic World and can't talk about it?    Or maybe he wasn't brought on board with Jurassic World until after that theory post.  Then why was he willing to break his NDA for spoiling the ending of a movie but not willing to break an NDA for just acknowledging a trailer exists?   The most likely answer is that he is lying.
StarWarsLeaks,3cm34y,ugnaught,2,Thu Jul 9 15:09:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah sounds fishy. Like I have been saying, I don't believe him. Other people just WANT him to be telling the truth, so they rationalize. I'm not writing him off completely till Friday, but I'm not expecting anything."
StarWarsLeaks,3cm34y,dathvada,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:15:13 2015 UTC,"I feel like we're going around in circles a bit here.  When he posted that original JW speculation, he may really not have known anything about the film.  Fast forward 4 months from then to his spoiler post, which you've said he deleted, and then maybe he had reason to know something.  As I've said before, no one is trying to use that old speculation post of his to verify him.  We're all referring to the deleted one, which contained multiple verifiable spoilers.  I also understand the claim that even those weren't new at the time, but you sure could have fooled me because after that post people seemed really surprised by the info.  No one in that thread responded with anything like ""oh, that information is already out there"".  Instead people were pissed off that the movie had been spoiled for them.  So I guess all I'm asking is if we're going to debate his credibility, let's at least make sure we're debating the same points."

Photos of your invite, swag from the event, selfie with JJ holding up a sign saying ""Hi r/StarWarsLeaks"" or something of that nature are about the level it'll take to get a full 180 from the pitchfork brigade at this point."
StarWarsLeaks,3cm34y,VadersHelmetPolish,36,Thu Jul 9 20:23:51 2015 UTC,"I'm still giving him the benefit of the doubt because so far his story has stayed 100% consistent (and I mean that for his entire tenure on this sub).  If he's indeed going to this screening tonight then he's got much better things to do at the moment than hang out in here.  He has also been very clear that he's signing an NDA and will not talk about what he sees.  So we likely won't hear from him until Friday evening.  Honestly, /u/00-----00 being a fraud is a really tough sell for me.  If he's a fraud then he has demonstrated an unprecedented commitment to his frauding.  And that's saying a lot because I've been hanging around this sub for a long time and I've seen all kinds of frauds with all kinds of strategies and levels of commitment.  Honestly, can anyone here name a single faker here who has used an account with a lifespan longer than a few weeks to do their faking?  This guy has been an active member of this community longer than I have, and for the most part he's been one of the more reasonable participants.  For his entire tenure he has been clear that he has no inside info, and when this opportunity arose for him to see this screening he had a very sane justification for how he got in.  He clearly enjoys hanging out here and discussing, and if he's proven to be fake that will all be ruined.  Sure, he can make another account, but he's built up a history and a repoire here, and there are many of us here who enjoy discussing with him, so he would be throwing that all away.  IMO Ockam's Razor says I just don't buy him as a fake.  Take it or leave it."

StarWarsLeaks,3cm34y,DinoDude23,2,Thu Jul 9 00:31:51 2015 UTC,"It's not so much about how hard it is to tell a consistent lie.  It's more about the fact that he clearly didn't create that account to be a troll.  He used it for a very long time to have sane discussions here and in other subs, and over that time he built up a rep.  If he really wanted to troll, why not created a throw away account just like all the other fakers.  Even the fakers with the most consistent/believable stories we've seen like YouAreNotAJediYet and GrandMoffYorky used throw away accounts.  That is a level of dedication that I haven't seen anywhere other than SuperShadow (though admittedly SuperShadow was on a grander scale)"

You will see it soon.  He hasn't offered any other information of any kind.  Unlike the other leakers, he's not trying to say there's a sex scene between Finn and Maz Kanata.  He's not saying that Kylo Ren is Lando's son and had a boy band that broke up due to his rampant drug use which made him fall to the dark side.  There's no information to parse, leads to follow, myths to debunk, or speculation to infer.  He either saw some footage or he didn't, and we're going to see some footage soon, or we aren't."
StarWarsLeaks,3cm34y,CSMcCringleberry,3,Thu Jul 9 19:36:53 2015 UTC,The difference with those people you listed is that they all used throw away accounts.

StarWarsLeaks,3cm34y,dat_shit_gray,2,Thu Jul 9 02:32:10 2015 UTC,"I get it, I just disagree :D   Not a single one of the other fakers have done this, and I think that says something.  I wouldn't want to trash my account by claiming something ridiculous for ultimately very little payoff and then have to start over.  I like being able to refer to my old posts and I like the fact that I'm building a reputation here (even if that reputation is that I'm gullible).  I believe he likes those same things, so I just don't get the desire to trash it for a lie that could last for a maximum of 6 days before being disproven.  EDIT: It also makes no sense that he would sacrifice the biggest poyential payoff of his lie - the opportunity to give us a fake trailer description ahead of Friday - by claiming an NDA if his goal was to get lots of attention and be a hero, even temporarily.  Assuming this whole ""no trailer at SDCC"" thing hadn't happened, what on earth would he have had to gain from it?"
StarWarsLeaks,3cm34y,jtobiska,2,Thu Jul 9 02:40:12 2015 UTC,"Well I guess either way, we're about to find out if he's faking or not."

StarWarsLeaks,3cm34y,jtobiska,6,Thu Jul 9 01:07:18 2015 UTC,"Ok, I didn't know about that speculation thread.  But ultimately that's not what those of us who believe him are referring to.  There was another post that he made much closer to the release of the film where he outlined about half a dozen very brief bullet points, and those were all correct.  I'm going to look for it.  EDIT: It's also worth pointing out that he says clearly in that thread you linked to that those are his theories.  The later post was not presented as theory, it was presented as fact, and was accurate, which makes sense.  It is easy to believe that back then he didn't know the spoilers and then learned about them later on in his tenure on the movie."
StarWarsLeaks,3cm34y,ugnaught,7,Thu Jul 9 01:26:05 2015 UTC,"And here is what he says about theories.    even if you know something, present it as a theory and people will be much more receptive of    He is just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks.  And what does come to fruition he plays off as him having inside knowledge.   He has also said...   I fancy myself as a damn good plot sniffer. I can generally see twists coming from miles ahead and am good at putting pieces together. I'm fairly certain I already know how Jurassic World will play out   The more and more you dig in to this guy the more it sounds like somebody that likes to piece together bits of info and then try to formulate the story.  Which is fine.  That is why we are all here.  But to then present it as inside info is just lame.    I don't get why everyone here is so eager to believe him when all evidence points to contrary."

At this point he either has knowledge of stuff going on behind the scenes or he doesn't.  I personally don't think he does but whatever.  If you guys want to get excited about it to each their own.  If he is bound to an NDA then why did he talk about Jurassic World?  Because he claims to have had an NDA for that.   The answer is he doesn't have an NDA because he is making all this up.   Here was his post about Jurassic World. Almost all of it is wrong.   I think people are confusing him for that guy in the bestof thread."

His account isn't just a throw away, and it is obvious his game failed and now he is hiding in shame. I speculate that he started out as an honest bloke and was just so tempted by the idea of being able to guess something and gain some sort of community fame and credibility, that it just overtook him. To use an appropiate metaphor, he was seduced by the Dark Side of the Force.  EDIT: I would be perfectly fine with him remaining a part of the community if he offers us a sincere apology and explains why he did it."

StarWarsLeaks,3cpo2g,MWB8,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:47:45 2015 UTC,"I feel like there are a few possibilities.  1 - The Rebel Alliance never coalesced into a New Republic. The Empire was knocked down but somehow clung to power. I think this is unlikely.  2 - The New Republic is uneasy about the rise of the First Order and is surreptitiously funding a resistance movement within FO territory   3 - The New Republic formed after the Empire was defeated and driven to backwaters to lick its wounds. There's been an uneasy, unequal peace, not unlike after WWI. With the First Order, the old Empire is resurgent and represents a growing, organized threat. The Republic is hesitant to take direct action that will lead to war (or is perhaps compromised from within to delay action). A few disaffected senators, who see the FO for the threat it really is, take matters into their own hands and from the Resistance to do what the Republic will not."
StarWarsLeaks,3cpo2g,DoogsATX,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:06:33 2015 UTC,"Good points - just to respond to them: 1) the Aftermath promotional materials released yesterday mention the ""New Republic"" and a lot of the early leaks and speculation around the political state of the galaxy hinted at a ""cold war"" type between the Republic and what's left of the Empire.   2&3 - I think these concepts can be combined and don't preclude each other. Leia could be one of those disaffected senators, and joined by Ackbar and some old hands from the Rebellion, start off in this direction.   The greater point about my post above is that for Leia this is personal. She knows who her father was and what he did to the galaxy. And she knows that, with Luke gone, the only person preventing her son from becoming the same thing might be her."
StarWarsLeaks,3cpo2g,ChetSteadman2274,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:22:04 2015 UTC,"Nice theory. As much as I'm looking forward to finally getting some new info this weekend, I figure this is the last chance for pure speculation given the few leaks we've had thus far. My idea could be completely off base, but I don't really care. Speculation has been half the fun in waiting for TFA to be released.  I think the Resistance is a faction of the New Republic that is dedicated to 'resisting' the First Order's rise to power. My guess is that the New Republic that formed after ROTJ never quite found its footing and struggled to provide order in the galaxy. Meanwhile, the First Order was made up of Moffs and whatever important Imperials were left after the Empire crumbled following the battle of Jakku.  While the common citizen in the galaxy didn't exactly love the Empire, they at least remember the Empire provided order and what could be called peace before the Rebellion happened. I'll bet there was a good deal of lawlessness and chaos following the Empire's collapse, and the New Republic never fully regained control.   In the years leading up to TFA, the First Order grew from a small band of systems to an emerging militant superpower in the galaxy (think Germany in-between WWI and II). The First Order is slowly but steadily taking over systems and is able to do so because the general population is tired of the chaos and political unrest and are willing to exchange all that for the security the Empire once provided (people getting rose-colored glasses for the good old Empire days).   The New Republic is unwilling to stand up to the First Order and is hoping that in appeasing them, they will eventually stop taking over systems and another Galactic war can be avoided (like Great Britain appeasing the Nazis pre-Churchill).  The Resistance forms out of the New Republic. People who fought in the Rebellion (Leia, Ackbar, Nien) see the First Order as basically the Empire re-born, and band together to not let all they've worked for in the Rebellion be in vain.   In the meantime, Luke Skywalker has been missing for the past few years. Following the destruction of his academy he disappeared to keep himself and those around him safe until the Force Awakens (ding!) and he can reveal himself again. Pretty much exactly why Obi-Wan was hiding between Episodes 3-4.  I think search for Luke is what sets the events of TFA in motion. The First Order wants to find him because he's Luke Skywalker. He destroyed the Death Star and killed the Emperor and Vader, thus he is the biggest threat in uniting systems against the First Order. The Resistance is trying to find him for the same reason, they need all the help they can to stop the growing threat before the First Order becomes too powerful."
StarWarsLeaks,3cpo2g,tommmytom,-2,Thu Jul 9 20:23:22 2015 UTC,"I do think the First Order is something unique and not necessarily the Empire, and I wonder how much the movie will distinguish between all of that.  An more interesting question about the conflict might be; are the people who attacked the Jedi academy the First Order? Or did they become the First Order? I like the idea of a group of Dark Siders attacked and devastating the Jedi academy, kidnapping young Kylo Ren Solo, and uncovering through later actions some kind of ""First Order"" that compels them to start down the path of whatever the First Order's mission/objective/goal actually is. Is it an old Imperial edict, or some kind of Sith rule?"
StarWarsLeaks,3cpo2g,CSMcCringleberry,0,Thu Jul 9 20:49:04 2015 UTC,"Interesting theory. I also have a theory on the factions by the time of TFA, though it is pure speculation. I don't want to ignore yours though, so if you want to read up on mine you can go here.  My idea is basically that the Empire did fall into chaos following Endor. With no clear line of succession and many Imperials taken out, the command structure of the Empire as crippled - which made it all the more dangerous. The New Republic, a restored and reformed ""Galactic Republic"", per se, eventually was able to consolidate itself throughout the galaxy. 30 years have passed, Republic is dominant galactic government, but the ""lost cause of the Empire"" idea never really was defeated. I assume the First Order, a union of Imperial remnants still controls territories in the farther-out regions such as the Outer Rim, and the Resistance, a union of resistance cells in these territories, is fighting back against the FO. Resistance is also most likely funded by the Republic, which does not want to get involved itself.  Anyway, let's discuss yours now. You are saying Leia and Han had a child or children, right? Han believes his son to be dead while Leia knows he is not, and now Leia knows their son is becoming a threat to the galaxy. I like your theory, but have some questions: 1) how do you suppose the child was separated? was it something to do with the Jedi? 2) how would Han be unaware of his child's status? was the ""separation"" that ""messy""? do you think Leia could have hid him? could he have run away, not believing in the Jedi way? Just wondering what you think. :) Anyway, this was a nice read."

You can predict the dialogue at times simply based on a knowledge of the OT.  After having watched a number of seasons, I'm burnt out for now for these reasons (and the fact that some episodes are nothing but sanitized-for-kids violence).

There will be a stupid statement made soon that it is all part of a bigger plan or something to that effect, which is in turn more damage control. I'll bet they are discussing how to release a teaser or trailer at an earlier date (not SDCC, maybe D23, maybe Ant Man) without disrupting their grand scheme."

We might end up with someone just doing a poor HF impression for two hours. Is there really nothing else in the whole SW universe Disney can go to?  Maybe I'll come round to it as an idea (and obviously I'll go and see the film) but I am sceptical. My incredibly cynical, and maybe unfair, reaction is that Disney is just latching on to a popular and therefore lucrative character."

StarWarsLeaks,3cgu10,bogaboy,5,Tue Jul 7 22:49:42 2015 UTC,Well we know why he owes Jabba. He dumped the cargo he was running for him when the Empire caught up to him. What we don't know is 1) how Han came into the service of Jabba or 2) what that cargo was (no doubt it was illegal). I'm thinking they'll touch on this as well as giving us a Han and Chewie origin story.  Edit: After reading that Wookieepedia article we DO in fact know what the cargo was (spice).
StarWarsLeaks,3cgu10,TheYoungUpstart,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:40:39 2015 UTC,Is that from something still canon? I was pretty sure that story came from the EU.
StarWarsLeaks,3cgu10,bogaboy,2,Tue Jul 7 23:43:01 2015 UTC,Here is the part describing his canon work for Jabba. There ARE EU stories about meeting Chewie and all that which of course now are bantha poodoo.

With an established character written by writers who know him (Kasdan) I think he could own it. He'd be a great Han.  Or Dash Rendar. But he doesn't have to not be Han. I mean he'd be a better Indy than Han, but still. Point stands. Isn't Peter Quill basically Marvel's answer to Han Solo anyway?

Maybe you're right."
StarWarsLeaks,3cgu10,weavves,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:27:08 2015 UTC,Han Solo requires a different kind of cool-guy moral ambiguity though. Ford plays him with a much more sardonic vibe than I can imagine Pratt ever pulling off. I can imagine him as Indy if he turned down the goofy a bit but it's gonna take an unknown to fill Han's shoes because there's not a celebrity out there at the moment that could do it.
StarWarsLeaks,3cgu10,stoatflip,2,Wed Jul 8 05:57:03 2015 UTC,"Because we already know who young Han is, what he looks like, and how he acts.

StarWarsLeaks,3cgu10,alienbro48,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:01:37 2015 UTC,Chris Pratt would be the same age as Han in ANH roughly. So I think we can rule him out since this is supposed to be an origin story. Just my personal opinion.
StarWarsLeaks,3cgu10,merica1991,2,Wed Jul 8 05:02:42 2015 UTC,See this is what I don't understand.  People love that Kasdan is being slapped on all these projects because he cowrote ESB. With two other guys in 1979.  The last thing he wrote was this.  I don't have proof that this will be stellar.

StarWarsLeaks,3cghpt,dddash,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:56:00 2015 UTC,"I would guess that the Star Wars logo in the red box to the right of the Stormtrooper in the ad will be the app's icon, suggesting the app may even simply be called ""Star Wars"" to make it a central experience apart from all of the other Star Wars apps and games out there. I've just checked the iOS App Store and there's no sign of it (or anything like that) yet but maybe we'll see an announcement and release to coincide with SDCC this weekend.   My bet is that it'll be something similar to the Star Wars BluRay Early Access app they put out a few years ago, with trailers, behind the scenes clips and other news drip fed into the app in the months leading up to TFA's release.   The augmented reality part will probably just be something that uses the camera to scan icons in print ads and then overlays an animated Stormtrooper or other characters as more ads get printed, but maybe they'll throw in something like the old Millennium Falcon gunner game where you can use your phone to shot down TIE Fighters flying around your room.   If it does release this weekend I wouldn't expect much content beyond the teasers we've already seen and whatever gets shown at SDCC but it's likely to become a regularly updated source for official releases as we go along. I know the Disney digital teams' strategy is to try and fill out the content on their own properties (apps and websites) so that they keep users coming to them, where they can control and build up the hype, so this seems to play into that strategy."

StarWarsLeaks,3cgf35,thatstarwarsdude,12,Tue Jul 7 18:36:09 2015 UTC,Clone of Tarkin is absolutely fan fiction.
StarWarsLeaks,3cgf35,westsideozzie,4,Tue Jul 7 18:39:11 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree, but I did read something someone wrote on jedi council forums that actually made the idea of a Tarkin clone work for me:   A clone of Tarkin was an idea that I positively hated when I heard it yesterday, but then I thought of it in the context of this theme I've been contemplating since the second teaser, and it works. The First Order is attempting to emulate the Empire, that much is clear, but how do they get a bit of that old-time Imperial fear-and-respect other than just wearing Imperial clothes? They need someone to help them lead an army to complete domination and victory, and instead of finding or training their own, they just decide to clone one of the more respected Imperial Moffs. Yet, this is a younger, rawer Tarkin, devoid of a lot of the experience he gained later in life, thrown into a completely different context and told to do the same thing. This Tarkin clone would also have a heavy chip on his shoulder, aware that his predecessor's legacy ended in one of the greatest military failures in history. What does this Tarkin do? He doesn't wait until they're ""in position"" to press the button on the Big Scary Super Weapon: he presses it even if it means losing the lives of every single man and woman under his control, so long as this time Tarkin is remembered as the man who acted, the man who actually pushed the button and wiped out the insurrectionists. An unstable man, then, with even less regard for life than before. He may be a clone, but he's not the same person."
StarWarsLeaks,3cgf35,gormo2,3,Tue Jul 7 18:44:15 2015 UTC,that's beyond cool. i'm in.
StarWarsLeaks,3cgf35,notmyrealname22222,3,Tue Jul 7 18:53:33 2015 UTC,"Another thing someone pointed out is that Tarkin had multiple cameos in TCW, he has been pretty important in Star Wars Rebels, and the first novel of the new canon was ""Tarkin.""   ... that said, I think the logistics of a Tarkin clone may be too complex for a film with at least 3 other villains, a boatload of protagonists, and so much other info to convey in a limited time. Maybe it's a descendant. Maybe it's just explained in the novelization of TFA coming out. Probably it's bullshit."
StarWarsLeaks,3cgf35,gormo2,2,Tue Jul 7 20:59:39 2015 UTC,"Takin was a Moff. Not only that, he was the Moff in charge of the Death Star build. He was a big deal. So were David Petraus and Stanley McChrystal....until they did some stupid shit. Then they were largely out of the public consciousness.   In other words, Tarkin was important for his time - post Clone War to his death on the SSD. I'm sure a few other generals or Moffs took his place and became even bigger deals (especially the ones that organized the New Order). I don't see any reason to dig up history with a cloned Tarkin. It would be like cloning George Patton because....why not?"
StarWarsLeaks,3cgf35,Urbinator,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:40:15 2015 UTC,"The only problem I find with this is it means one of two things from my best guess. Either the empire had this planned while Tarkin was still alive as a contingency plan or there's going to be some backstory of the first order finding some DNA of his. Blood banks possibly but I don't see these even being in existence in Star Wars. They have synthetic skin stuff and bafta tanks so I'd expect they don't need actual blood stored; maybe some tech that grows blood quickly or synthetic blood I would presume.  The former I find too EU fan boyish. The latter seems too contrived just to have a Tarkin ""descendant"" without retconning Tarkin having a family. But these are just my opinions."
StarWarsLeaks,3cgf35,TheDugat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:42:59 2015 UTC,"... why not just make him his grandchild or something then? It would not sound as shitty as ""clone"" does, and you could still have the unstable thing because of his ancestor."
StarWarsLeaks,3cgf35,jonsnowwontgetlaid,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:28:05 2015 UTC,Yup.  All the rumors previous were that Gleeson was a descendant of Tarkin. Makes more sense than a clone.

Also, notice that Rogue One and Han/Fett (title probably WIP) both have ""Anthology"" written below them. The Kenobi film doesn't.  Do you remember the rumours that Disney were planning to make a trilogy of Kenobi films separate from the Anthology films? It makes sense with The Balance of The Force being the title for a first movie.  Either the guy that made these fakes was really up to date with rumours and very very skilled at Photoshop, or the rumours about Disney's plans were correct all along."

It'd be stupid for Lucasfilm not to release another trailer because:   the Vanity fair article is behind us. It was a decent splash, but we're almost a month removed from it. See point 4. Jurassic World. It's freaking Comic-Con. Disney withheld Marvel (fucking Marvel) specifically so Star Wars could have Hall H. September is still two months away, and the public (read: non-Star Wars fans, the ones who will make the records happen) are losing interest. Secretive =\= no marketing. Batman vs Superman has the public's attention right now, but it's dying too. Perfect time to make a move. the timeline. (Was that you who posted that, 00?) granted, this is something different altogether, being Star Wars, but it still needs marketing. If we get to August without a trailer, we'd be overdue. Then what?   I really don't think anything but a trailer would suffice for Comic-Con. I can't see production stills or a synopsis being as effective. One last trailer, with shots of the villains and a shot of both new and old heroes together (without Luke maybe? Tease us, don't mislead us), would be perfect."

StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Mr_Otters,16,Mon Jul 6 22:19:14 2015 UTC,Week ruined and it's only Monday!   Was so looking forward to a trailer
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,danthfc,5,Tue Jul 7 15:35:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah why would they release such depressing news so early in the week?  I'll liken this to the Batman v. Superman trailer hype. Everyone was hoping we'd get something at the Super Bowl, and WB didn't say jack all about it. We all waited, and no trailer came. WB still didn't say jack, and I was disappointed, but I was still in super hype mode.  Just telling us flat out ""no trailer will happen"" is PAINFUL."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Gamefreak975,13,Tue Jul 7 17:23:50 2015 UTC,Then I will see you in hell!
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,AmazingAutoModerator,11,Mon Jul 6 20:33:23 2015 UTC,Which is not great. Looks like we'll have to wait until August for the next proper look. Hoping for some decent behind the scenes but can't deny I'm disappointed.
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,jtobiska,3,Mon Jul 6 20:41:39 2015 UTC,"No, if they're right then we have to wait longer than that.  August is still the summer, they're saying nothing until fall, which means September or October"
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,JakkuScavenger,4,Tue Jul 7 01:38:43 2015 UTC,September 4th is Force Friday. My guess is we'll get the full trailer then and a bunch of TV spots with no new footage in November and that'll be it.
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,DoogsATX,2,Mon Jul 6 20:18:34 2015 UTC,"There is no way that's going to happen. They've been talking up Force Friday as a thing for a while now, and they will want to focus as much attention as possible on that date - which means releasing marketing BEFORE that date."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,kirasolo,2,Mon Jul 6 21:13:38 2015 UTC,Surely D23 is the place to reveal the new trailer if Comic-Con won't have it?
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,stealthboy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:20:59 2015 UTC,In the comments the author says no trailer at D23
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,GOATLin,10,Tue Jul 7 02:12:20 2015 UTC,So what does this mean for all the supposed trailer leaks?
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,stealthboy,14,Mon Jul 6 21:49:04 2015 UTC,Take a wild guess
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,LograysTaint,3,Mon Jul 6 21:52:25 2015 UTC,I suppose I was asking a rhetorical question :-).
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,thesaifking,7,Mon Jul 6 20:21:14 2015 UTC,It means more people's pants are on fire.
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,emphram,2,Mon Jul 6 20:25:25 2015 UTC,"idk man, there were a bunch of leaks in april, and one of them mentioned a shot of Han Rey and Finn in the Falcon with a sketch of it, turns out that shot was actually true as confirmed from the recent screenshot leaks.   I'm guessing there are alternate trailers that are cut that for whatever reason by marketing aren't shown, so part of me thinks that some of the leakers are telling the truth, even if we never see these said trailers."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,thesaifking,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:33:40 2015 UTC,But that same shot was actually talked about by MSW previously. They incorporated a MSW leak in order to sound legit.

Deep down, I want them to outsmart us.  I'm such a huge fan that I can't help but grasp at leaks and theories. I'm sorry Mark Hamill, but I just can't help it.   But what I really want is to have my cake and eat it too. I want to spend the next five months speculating with all of you and getting duped by convincing BS from MSW and co., only to be completely in the dark about the big reveals until I'm sitting next to my brother and niece dressed as Han and Leia in the theater on opening night."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,thesaifking,24,Mon Jul 6 21:48:57 2015 UTC,That's exactly what someone would say if they wanted to surprise us with a brand new trailer
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,DanielYMoi,10,Mon Jul 6 20:21:43 2015 UTC,From a certain point of view...
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,thesaifking,19,Tue Jul 7 01:33:32 2015 UTC,FROM MY POINT OF VIEW LUCASFILM IS EVIL
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Shatterhand1701,6,Mon Jul 6 20:36:11 2015 UTC,WELL THEN YOU REALLY ARE LOST
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Gamefreak975,16,Mon Jul 6 22:19:45 2015 UTC,"Gotta tell ya; that's a pretty piss-poor showing by Lucasfilm.  SDCC is the time when you want to bring your ""big guns"".  Yeah, one could say that the movie's going to be so huge it doesn't need a big flashy presentation at SDCC, but that hasn't stopped other franchises from doing the same.  Behind-the-scenes stuff is all fine and good, but they know damn well that people attending the con (as well as people at home streaming it) want something more tangible.  They had a chance to really blow people away at SDCC and completely dropped the ball.  Bad form, Lucasfilm...bad form."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,DarthPlagueis_,13,Mon Jul 6 22:27:03 2015 UTC,"Well, it hasn't happened yet, but if there really is no trailer...that's some Grade-A booshit."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,BroncoEmpire,7,Mon Jul 6 22:29:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't give up hope completely.  Who knows? This might not even be true. At the very least we'll get some new bits of info, and maybe some behind the scenes footage of even a poster."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Killzark,7,Mon Jul 6 20:48:42 2015 UTC,"What if this is just an attempt to reduce expectations for a new trailer? #conspracy. Or it could also be click bait for Enterainment Weekly. Personally, I'd be pretty pissed if they don't release a trailer or only release one for Comic-Con attendees."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,saundini,2,Mon Jul 6 20:50:18 2015 UTC,That's what I'm thinking. Didn't they just run an article saying Obi Wan's descendant is in the movie? If take this article with a grain of salt.
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Gamefreak975,5,Mon Jul 6 20:37:33 2015 UTC,"FUCK. Sounds like we still will get some good nuggets, but I wanted a dang trailer"
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Angelmv86,4,Mon Jul 6 22:36:21 2015 UTC,I can't handle anymore nuggets. I need the full-on golden shit right NOW
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Gamefreak975,7,Tue Jul 7 03:04:29 2015 UTC,"Still willing to bet that there will be a trailer, or alternate teaser, or some sort of new footage... They know the fan base is dying for more.. It would be illogical to just sit up there and talk...."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Angelmv86,2,Mon Jul 6 20:24:44 2015 UTC,"If ""behind-the-scenes"" baloney was really their primary plan, they'll certainly backtrack and post up a trailer once the internet collectively shits itself over this horrible news."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Shatterhand1701,6,Mon Jul 6 21:04:13 2015 UTC,"I said in a thread the other day, it's bad enough that leaks for this trilogy are going to be few and far in between when compared to leaks for the prequel trilogy, which I remember obsessing over fondly growing up... This time everything has been so ""Top Secret"" it's ridiculous... Back to CC however, it would be SUCH a mistake not to show new footage, I think that article was intentionally misleading."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Angelmv86,2,Mon Jul 6 20:54:59 2015 UTC,"Yet I'm betting that's exactly what they're going to do.  EW's usually been on-the-ball with this type of stuff, so I don't think they'd blatantly lie.  If Lucasfilm planned to surprise everyone with a new trailer or film footage, it's more likely they wouldn't have been so specific about what they were actually doing.  I think it's more a case of Lucasfilm failing to bring their A-game to SDCC.  But, hey...if I'm wrong, so much the better."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Gamefreak975,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:57:47 2015 UTC,"I hear you, while I agree that things need to be released at the right moment, I hope J.J. Doesn't take this secrecy thing over the top..."

StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Shatterhand1701,5,Mon Jul 6 21:07:56 2015 UTC,So we are gonna get all the action figures and other awesome merchandise before getting a full Star Wars trailer?! That doesn't make sense to me...
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,toph1980,2,Tue Jul 7 01:33:28 2015 UTC,"That's what I keep thinking!  We should be learning more about these new characters NOW, before the toys come out and reveal them all to the world at large.  I know next to nothing about Rey, Finn, and Poe Dameron, who are the new major players in the cinematic portion of this franchise, and we're six months away from release!  I'm not asking for ALL of the details, but how's about a little more than nothing at all?  And what really sticks in my craw about all of this is that we're supposed to be all excited about this BTS discussion with JJ, Kathleen Kennedy, et al, but since they're all under lockdown and can't reveal any major story details, what do they really have to tell us?  This was their big opportunity to whet the fans' appetites and keep the hype train at full speed, and they've already failed.  It's a sad state of affairs."

StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,AcceptingNormality,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:24:55 2015 UTC,"They most likely chose those words so that if a third teaser is released, no one can turn around and say that they were wrong. In other words, bullshit story just to stay relevant."

StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Urbinator,3,Mon Jul 6 20:51:58 2015 UTC,Same with every other person who's claimed to have seen it...
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Bilka,2,Mon Jul 6 20:55:09 2015 UTC,"The sheer volume of people who have said they have seen it (many of who have reported similar things) leads me to believe 1 of 2 things:  1) There really is a cut trailer floating around waiting for the light of day.  Or   2) There was that rumored alternate cut of the second teaser and much of what has been reported is from that.   My final thought. It does seem odd that Star Wars would build up a huge presence at SDCC only to show nothing, but at the same time people seem to be of the mind that we would get ANOTHER teaser at SDCC and a full trailer just a month later at D23. My new time frame (pulled soundly out of my ass) is a new very short teaser at D23 and the one and only trailer some time in the fall.  Perhaps not long ager ""Force Friday"". Hell maybe even coinciding with it.  I don't like not getting a trailer on Friday but it makes sense. Why release something so big on a Friday in the summer time? In the PR business that would be called a ""bad news dump"" because no one is paying attention."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Urbinator,3,Mon Jul 6 22:17:53 2015 UTC,The week has been ruined for trolls and that kind of makes me happy.  Think about the poor dude that had his fake trailer description in perfect form and all ready to post here.  Better come up with some other BS quick!!!

StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,AmazingAutoModerator,3,Tue Jul 7 00:36:20 2015 UTC,"I don't believe we won't get anything new. I mean, WHY show up at Comic Con if all you're going to do is show behind the scenes of scenes we've barely seen the front of."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,Shatterhand1701,3,Tue Jul 7 04:06:50 2015 UTC,"No trailer at SDCC doesn't mean no trailer at all. A trailer could still drop on Friday, just not at the show."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,AmazingAutoModerator,4,Tue Jul 7 15:28:31 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend getting your hopes up for that.  It seems highly unlikely that they'd drop a new TFA trailer on Friday and NOT feature it at the SDCC panel.
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,00-----00,12,Tue Jul 7 14:02:08 2015 UTC,"I won't believe it unless LucasFilm specifically states there won't be a new trailer. This smells like a marketing ploy.

StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,thesaifking,4,Tue Jul 7 15:14:56 2015 UTC,"If it's a marketing ploy, it's a monumentally stupid one.  ""Hey, we just want you all to know we will NOT be showing any new footage or trailers at our Star Wars panel wink wink"" doesn't sound like a very intelligent and professional way to handle things.  Like welshwordman said in his reply to you, I think this is Lucasfilm making sure the fans know not to get their hopes up for seeing a new trailer, because it just plain isn't going to happen."

StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,StrangeConstants,3,Tue Jul 7 17:02:06 2015 UTC,"""Word play""?  I don't know; it seems pretty clear-cut to me.  To quote the article:  ""First of all, the presentation this Friday afternoon will not include a trailer or any new clips of the movie.""  I don't see any clever linguistic twists or turns in that statement that would imply differently.    And even if they were just rodeo-clowning us away from something (like the possibility that they're going to show something on a different day or whatever) why the deliberate misdirection?  I just don't understand the purpose of it."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,VadersHelmetPolish,2,Tue Jul 7 20:07:20 2015 UTC,"They didn't think to mention ""teaser,"" just trailer or clips."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,twistedmind1586,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:44:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know, but it can be argued that it's just a matter of semantics.  We all know there's a difference between ""teaser"" and ""trailer"", but I have a pretty strong feeling that the article's claim of ""will not include a trailer or any new clips of the movie"" would also apply to teasers.  Just because they didn't specifically include the word ""teaser"" in that sentence doesn't mean that there will be a ""teaser"" rather than a ""trailer"".  Ugh, this whole thing makes my head spin.  It's just ridiculous that they wouldn't include new filmed footage (let's just call it that and assume that includes trailer/teaser/clips) in their presentation on Friday."
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,welshwordman,2,Tue Jul 7 20:01:30 2015 UTC,So you assumed a trailer because it was something big but that was never explicitly said? What about this special thing supposedly taking place today you mentioned?
StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,AmazingAutoModerator,2,Wed Jul 8 14:18:46 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's very carefully worded to say ""no clips"" (a la Cap and Tony Stark chopping firewood from last year's Marvel panel) or trailer (meaning a full, proper trailer) but that still leaves them plenty of wiggle room for a third teaser.   As to the quote you've added, I'm sure I read something similar from Kevin Fiege regarding making sure you exceed expectations if you're planning on going anywhere near Hall H, so I can't imagine them not having something big to put out there, even if they are playing semantics about what that something actually is.   Add to that the fact that the Miller & Lord Han Solo movie just got announced in a blog post on StarWars.com and not held back until a reveal on stage at SDCC means there's more and bigger to come on Friday."

There was never word we'd get a trailer and they probably noticed hype building and wanted to squash it so people going in on Friday didn't leave pissed off. I think it's a smart move to let EW report it and Lucasfilm doesn't need to comment on it from here because the report has a lot of weight."

StarWarsLeaks,3ccbjz,SunbroSithLord,5,Tue Jul 7 16:42:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the ""lockdown"" of info is getting a bit ridiculous now.  I get that they don't want to ""let it all hang out"" and ruin the experience for everyone, but I'm pretty sure there are government secrets less protected than this damn movie is right now.  I'm not expecting the motherlode of footage, plot details, etc.  I'm not that unreasonable.  But they've got 6 months before the movie comes out, and SDCC was a BIG opportunity to really blow people away and keep the hype train chugging at full steam.  Yeah, it'll still be cool to hear the behind-the-scenes stuff, especially if some of the cast will be there...but it still just feels like such a major dropping of the ball by Lucasfilm."

This time, however, it isn't supposed to be released until the movie is out (in ebook followed by a hardcover in the new year).    I wonder if they'll credit it to JJ, like they did the ANH novelization to Lucas."
StarWarsLeaks,3cdao1,TheDugat,21,Tue Jul 7 12:17:12 2015 UTC,How much info came out before ANH was released?    They released the novelization 6 months before the film and were showing pictures to anyone that would look at them. They had booths at trade shows. Articles in Sci Fi magazines. The works.   Sometimes I feel like I am the only old person on here.
StarWarsLeaks,3cdao1,ugnaught,3,Tue Jul 7 01:46:43 2015 UTC,"I'll say you're not alone. But you seem to have much more vivid memories from back then so I'm guessing you're at least slightly older as I was 4 when ANH released.

I didn't really understand Star Wars until ESB came out but I already knew what a lightsaber, x wing and a tie fighter were."

This was all waaaaay before the Internet.  :)  But now we do have it and it helps to fill in some gaps.

StarWarsLeaks,3cdao1,CSMcCringleberry,3,Tue Jul 7 00:53:48 2015 UTC,I think it's a combination of factors. Disney holds the reins. There is no question about that and Bob Iger is without doubt personally invested in the movie. I think (to speculate) that it is a common agreement between Bad Robot and Disney to hold back
StarWarsLeaks,3cdao1,mytoemytoe,2,Tue Jul 7 01:10:38 2015 UTC,I like your optimism on this and in general. Truly. But I don't think there's any way to keep this beast locked in. I was just a wee kid when the first Star Wars released so I can only speculate as to what the hype was like surrounding big movies back then but growing up in the 70's and 80's almost all hype was completely centralized around the TV wether through a trailer or a news segment. We're in the digital age now and there was nothing remotely similar to this sub or anything akin to it.  I'm fully aware the plausibility of your statement but I just simply can't fathom it staying that way even if JJ and company are actually trying to do just what your postulating. And I do think they are trying very hard to keep it at least similar to what you're proposing but it's very similar to Apple hype imo. It always gets out there even if just before the release.

StarWarsLeaks,3cdao1,Shatterhand1701,4,Tue Jul 7 04:13:42 2015 UTC,"As of today, the timing of the news that there will be no trailer and no clips seems like a catastrophic fuck up in timing.  If it turns out that the panel is little more than 'Look at all this concept art of how we evolved the new stormtrooper armor!!!!!!!', it will be taken as a bad sign as to the quality of the movie, and there will be rumbling from every corner of the media and the interwebz.  They're still going to fill Hall H, but the line isn't going to wrap around the block anymore and a lot of people are going to be pissed.  This can be remedied in three ways:  1- EW writer or his sources is full of shit.  2- They got super Bill Clinton with the wording and there's still a trailer, but TECHNICALLY it's something different.  Think ""extended first look"" or ""exclusive preview footage"", but it's really a trailer.  3- What they're going to throw out is somehow better than a trailer.  You could get the opening crawl along with production photos of all of the main characters (Christie sans helmet, Snoke, Maz Kanata, Luke, Leia, etc) plus production stills showing locations, names of planets, and the various ships.  And the poster.  And some new music.  I honestly don't think releasing the title of the second anthology, or naming the new inquisitors in Rebels or something on that scale will do the trick.  If it's completely underwhelming, and we've been warned in advance that it's going to be completely underwhelming, there's going to be problems- a decrease in the intensity of the anticipation for this movie which will hurt sales of tie-in products and first day ticket sales of the movie, along with persistent rumors that it's going to suck."
StarWarsLeaks,3cdao1,WookieeSolo,5,Tue Jul 7 01:43:24 2015 UTC,"As if the tiny crowd that comes to Comic Con has any bearing on how much money the movie makes! If they start a marketing blitz in September there won't be a soul on the planet that doesn't know a new Star Wars movie is coming out on Christmas. Do you think it will sell? It has the name Star Wars in it, so I'd say there's a pretty good bet people are going to go see it.   All logic has officially been abandoned in this sub."

StarWarsLeaks,3cdao1,Shatterhand1701,0,Thu Jul 9 21:18:57 2015 UTC,"As unfortunate a creation as the ""huge media marketing machine"" is, it is nevertheless an undeniable presence that can turn the ""less is more"" marketing strategy into a gun that shoots its product in the foot.    The majority of us have high hopes that the movie will be a guaranteed success no matter how much or little pre-release exposure it gets.  And yeah, it probably will be a huge success at release.  Hell, even The Phantom Menace broke records when it was released, and that movie's widely considered the least favorite of all the existing films.  But as much as we'd like to think the good ol' days when a movie didn't need a lot of pre-release hype to fuel its box office run and ensure its success, that's just not realistic anymore.  In order to keep the hype train running and the fans engaged, they need to be at least minimally informed, ESPECIALLY for a movie introducing three new characters who are essentially responsible for carrying the franchise forward.  Yes, it'll be great to see Han, Luke, Leia, Chewie, R2 and 3PO in action again, but they are NOT the main characters of The Force Awakens.  We know next to nothing about Rey, Finn, or Poe Dameron save for their names and what they look like, and maybe one or two random details, some of which are based on leaks that are dubious in their legitimacy.  These are the characters that we should be hearing and seeing more of so we can get to know them, get comfortable with them so we'll be more likely accept them as the new faces of Star Wars when Mark, Harrison and Carrie decide to holster their blasters and hyperspeed off into the sunset."

Think about it: the SDCC audience is seeing this movie no matter what, Disney needs the casual audience to get their asses in seats to get the Jurassic World money--a campaign blitz in the fall makes more sense. If they give us a lot of cool behind the scenes stuff, that's a ""you owe the fans something"" satisfaction. I assume we'll get more details here and at D23 along with some stuff to look at as well."

Toy leaks happened about six months before, with characters and descriptions.  Plus the figures came with a talking chip and that dialog leaked!  Also extras who were onset at the Naboo palace gave detailed descriptions on what they saw.  The only things that didn't leak from Ep. 1 were the comedy gags from Jar Jar which weren't strictly in the script.  It was actually a pretty cool time as Lucasfilm put out these amazing Making of videos on their website every month that gave us previews of designs months before release.  I really missed that this time around."

I have no idea how long this publication had been available, but  it was the story of the whole movie from start to finish, the dialogue, the directions, the artwork. It gave away the whole story. So weird to think that they'd do that with a Star Wars movie, given the secrecy surrounding this new one.  Edit: this is the book, and it looks like it was published only a couple of weeks before the movie's release. I guess it must have felt longer back then."

StarWarsLeaks,3cd18n,DoogsATX,3,Tue Jul 7 16:46:37 2015 UTC,Haha its funny to think that almost none of the supporting Naboo characters made it into the following movies
StarWarsLeaks,3cd18n,Rogue-3,3,Tue Jul 7 20:24:50 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for TPM, but AOTC had a lot of potential spoilers. I think a lot of it was mainly rumors and early speculation as I remember it. The novelization and video game adaptation of ROTS leaked about a month early, the video game even featured crucial scenes from the film. I also remember the trailer being pretty much a 2 minute version of the plot. Keep in mind the marketing campaign of Episode III centered around Anakin's transformation to Darth Vader, so I don't think they were overly concerned about plot points leaking."
StarWarsLeaks,3cd18n,ChetSteadman2274,2,Tue Jul 7 02:08:11 2015 UTC,I wasn't an avid leak follower back then either but I can tell you that the novelization of TPM came out at bookstores over a month before the film even came out.

I've heard that there were a few rumours floating around that they had to re-shoot a bunch of Ep.1 stuff because it had been filmed out of focus, and there's this spy shot I've seen from Ep.2: http://i.imgur.com/I9g7VMc.jpg"

Grainy photos leaked from the studio were published and posted on the internet, and all sorts of wild rumours festered when bits and pieces of information were obtained.

StarWarsLeaks,3cehvg,Killzark,7,Tue Jul 7 11:22:02 2015 UTC,"Eh. The opening crawl is just scene-setting. And at least with the prequels, it's always been released well in advance of the film. A quick Google search reveals that the ROTS crawl was released in January 2005, so five months before release.  As to the ""feels"", for me at least, they come from the opening blare of the score and the words STAR WARS showing up on the giant theater screen. Knowing the words that follow haven't and won't change that sensation."
StarWarsLeaks,3cehvg,DoogsATX,3,Tue Jul 7 14:49:21 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I guess I'm still just upset there probably won't be any new footage.

JJ and Lawrence talking about the plot or even just the aftermath of Jedi would make more sense. Still crossing my fingers for another teaser or some behind the scenes video or new characters or something. The opening crawl is probably the last thing I would want."
StarWarsLeaks,3cehvg,Killzark,3,Tue Jul 7 12:54:01 2015 UTC,"I gotcha.  What if they just released the text and not in Star Wars scroll form?    I just remember seeing The Phantom Menace and was really bummed by the opening crawl.  Trade Federations?   Taxation of trade routes?  F that.

StarWarsLeaks,3cehvg,stealthboy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:59:02 2015 UTC,You have a point. If he's confident in his movie enough to release the opening crawl 6 months before the movie then we know have something special to look forward to. But honestly I'd rather just get a vague synopsis of the plot.

Ep IX - Ends in a massive battle that the secret Jedi Order has been training for in the previous movies.   This is kind of what I'm hoping for anyway.

StarWarsLeaks,3cafwa,dddash,2,Mon Jul 6 14:07:17 2015 UTC,"If the MSW synopsis is right in the broad strokes, it seems pretty clear that Luke did start an academy and at some point his pupils were massacred.  My guess is that we see this in the Maz-induced flashback. And at some point we learn that Luke has deduced that whoever committed the massacre was after him, so he went off into self-imposed exile.  Now the question is...were there other Jedi? Maz Kanata is clearly being presented as some kind of Force user. Perhaps there are others out there - older pupils who have already ventured out to serve the galaxy? Perhaps with the massacre at the main Academy, and with Luke missing and maybe feared dead, they scatter and some continue teaching pupils of their own in small, secretive cells?   Those cells probably wouldn't have any bearing on TFA, but could set up Luke ""getting the gang back together"" in Episode VIII."

He was a semi-minor character who is never mentioned again after his death. I couldn't have cared less about him except that his novel was one of the first in the new canon.   Why would they commission a book about a character who even the hardcore fans have basically forgotten about if he has no relevance to the new movies. There are a thousand other characters who would sell more books to casual fans in the OT, since that seems to be their focus now.   I was pulling for Gleeson to be Luke's son but if he's Tarkin re-born that's cool too."
StarWarsLeaks,3c8h9j,Emcee_squared,2,Mon Jul 6 06:22:06 2015 UTC,No. A Tarkin clone is lazy writing. I'm tired of Star Wars and clones. How hard is it to come up with something original?

They then later edit any mannerisms of the puppets with CGI to ""smoothen"" them up and make them move a bit more natrually, as well as placing the facial mocap onto the puppets.  The nature of facial mocap that Avatar innovated means no matter what direction the puppet is facing - upside down, profile shot, or even back facing camera - the facial acting has been performed, recorded by several mini cameras and rendered from literally every angle imaginable so that they can just cgi it onto the head of the puppet."

StarWarsLeaks,3c988k,nathanf1194,12,Mon Jul 6 02:04:43 2015 UTC,"On the one hand, Harrison Ford has said in the past that he wanted Han to die -- some fans have postulated that one of the terms of him returning for the new trilogy was that this wish be fulfilled. Some fans have also used evidence of mentor characters dying in the first film of each saga as proof that one of the old guard will meet their end in Ep.VII, be it Han or Luke.  On the other hand, and I personally think this outweighs everything I've presented above -- Harrison Ford is literally at the center of the renaissance of Star Wars. The old boy has the potential to be rolling in money by signing onto a multi-film and merchandising deal with Disney, and I can't see him turning it down. A more pragmatic view, true, but also one I'm leaning towards."

StarWarsLeaks,3c988k,TeutonJon78,5,Mon Jul 6 07:03:40 2015 UTC,It's really irrelevant whether Harrison Ford wanted his character to die.  1) He doesn't write the scripts 2) His career is not where it was.  He was the undisputed #1 star in the world for many years...he's a little long in the tooth for that. 3) Disney would need a really good narrative to kill him in the 1st Star Wars movie they make.  The explanation at MSW doesn't really cut it for me.  I'd vote no right now.  Eventually?  Of course...I think all 3 of them will die if the movies go long enough.
StarWarsLeaks,3c988k,GOATLin,6,Mon Jul 6 03:25:01 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling the new trilogy will follow a similar template to the Original in that the first of the three will end more or less on a positive note.

StarWarsLeaks,3c988k,HenryChinaskiForPrez,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:11:16 2015 UTC,I think having MVS die wouldn't give as much of an emotional impact as Han dying so I think he should be the one to go. Keeping the old guys around too long could soil this trilogy IMO.
StarWarsLeaks,3c988k,StarLordandSaviour,5,Mon Jul 6 04:20:40 2015 UTC,I think it's probable/possible but I don't think it's a good idea. Harrison Ford is the best actor of the old trio and most bankable star of the old trio. He's the glue that binds them together.

If a character was to be killed off, Han would be the obvious choice, especially since we know Ford wanted him dead anyways. We can't say for certain it'll happen in 7, but I would bet any amount of money that it will happen sometime in this new trilogy. It's really just a matter of when."
StarWarsLeaks,3c988k,bogaboy,2,Mon Jul 6 02:10:52 2015 UTC,"Wasn't there a rumor that Harrison Ford was already signed for Ep 8?

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if Han does die in Episode VII; I'm one of the people who suspect that he only agreed to do the movie if he could be killed off by the end of it, as he's never been overly fond of the character and Star Wars in general.  I'm conflicted by the possibility; on one hand I'd hate to see him go because he's such an iconic character, and I don't want Abrams-haters to point to him and say something stupid like, ""See?  He killed off Han Solo!  He's ruining Star Wars the same way he ruined Star Trek!!!""  On the other hand, I'd really like to see the new characters have the opportunity to carry the franchise forward without heavy reliance on the original characters to validate them, and Han's death would provide the movie a strong emotional impact."

He's been around this sub for ages and has repeatedly and consistently stated that although he does work in film marketing, TFA isn't one of his projects (and he was pretty open about the fact that Jurassic World was).  His responses to rumours and leaks have never show any indication of any inside knowledge from the production of TFA but his knowledge of marketing practices (in terms of things like the timing of teaser/trailer/broader asset releases) has established his credibility as a marketer to me.  (Disclosure: I work in digital marketing - in a different industry and a different country, but have worked on marketing for a couple of small indie films in the past - and 00 definitely talks the talk as far as I'm concerned.)  The fact is that specialist marketing is often a surprisingly small and tight-knit community where people get to know each other and keep in touch, e.g. even I know a couple of the guys who lead Disney's web strategy and managed the onboarding of StarWars.com (but no, I don't have any leaks about TFA from them and I'm not friendly enough to be able to ask).  I doesn't surprise me that 00 has friends involved in marketing TFA now that it's getting to this stage in the release process. He's clearly not connected to the production side of things but now that they're ramping up to go loud on the marketing campaign it's completely understandable that there would be a marketing pre-launch (probably also including select members of high level press - not the MSW and SW7N blogger types) that he's managed to call in a favour to score an invite.   It's also not in the least bit surprising that such an event would be covered by an NDA with an embargo on not publishing write ups about the trailer until after its public unveiling at SDCC.   00's obviously not going to screw up his relationships with TFA's marketers by running straight in here on Wednesday night and posting a trailer breakdown. It would seriously jeopardise his chances of getting invited to future TFA events and likely sully his reputation in, what I've already explained is, a close knit community.   Give the guy a break, be happy that he's gonna have a couple of days of trying to recall every little thing he sees in the trailer before he can play it over and over on YouTube like the rest of us and focus on the important things like convincing the Revanauts of their wrongness."

That said, I'm beginning to come around to think he may actually have the meat and potatoes of this film. I think he's still missing a bunch of crucial elements that put everything in context, and even flat out guessed on a few things, but I think the heart of the story is there.     I don't like Jason Ward's attitude either, but it's pretty obvious Ward has sources of some kind. Even if some of the info he's presented turns out to be false, much of what he's presented has been true. So unless you expected him to be 100% right about everything, which is a pretty unrealistic standard/expectation to set, I have a hard time believing that he'd be fucked.

He has been right about a Lot of stuff that spears in the film but I think it he obliviously doesn't have ""the story "" and rather than share what he has he fell to the (""super shadow"") dark side and just pieced it together himself/with a few associates.   Personally I would not be at all surprised to find he was unwittingly made a shill for the mystery box and that he was spoon fed stuff that people in the know wanted him to run (in the wrong direction) with.   He could have shared what he had without conjecture and had some pretty good scoops - but by talking out his butt about what he guesses for how it all fit together he's going to end up looking like a fool."

The trailer would have to show stuff that MSW said didn't happen, like Luke being in only a few minutes. The other things that come to me just off hand would be:  -if it shows Han and Leia arm in arm, like they're together;    -if it shows Han and Chewie meeting Rey for the first time not on a spaceship;   -if Rey, without Finn, is the one piloting the MF on Jakku, running from those TIEs  -Some have posited, like I did about a month and a half ago, that Rey has been fixing the Falcon after it got shot down on Jakku. If a trailer shows her tinkering on it leisurely on Jakku instead of essentially stealing it and flying off-planet, that would be incompatible with the MSW plot.  Regardless of the specifics, I hope beyond hope that this is correct. The people that do MSW, especially the podcast, are so irritating. I would love for them to have to eat some crow. Or shit. Whatever. I just hated that story line. Fuck those guys."

In that instance its safer and easier to leak material.   In the second teaser at Celebration, there was changes made at the last minute. If you are a leaker and you see the trailer at a certain revision and they change it down the road (especially if you don't know)  it makes it easier to figure out which group could contain the leaker, i.e. sound editors in the last trailer had to change things up, which would rule out their group. Does that make sense?"

According to you, Ward won't be doing any new leaks because his major reason is to protect his (trailer) source. Yet he went public with (mostly) everything else, from concept art to production sheets to character reveals to movie stills. Minor stuff Ward didn't leak was because it couldn't be verified, not to protect any of his sources.  A lot of that stuff Ward did leak was coded, in numerous ways, may I add. What ever happened to protecting those sources?  Why can't you just deal with the fact that Ward didn't do any leaks because he has nothing to share? The only one saying he's not doing any new leaks to protect his source is you.  Have a nice day."

StarWarsLeaks,3c1yrf,flourykettle,14,Sat Jul 4 00:38:49 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: this is just my own personal logic and opinion although it's based upon rational thoughts regarding the saga.  Is it plausible? Yes. Is it likely? That's an entirely different matter. This Kenobi child/grandchild bandwagon is just  utter fan service wishing upon a star. It would require too many retcons in ANH alone. Kenobi fathering a child is about as likely as him not showing any insight into why he wouldn't acknowledge the fact as such through ANH in the first place.  His character presented in IV, if it came to be he indeed was a father, would now be akin to the ""dad that isn't around"". I don't see Kenobi being that stereotype at all. Granted, it's possible this child of his could be a teenager or young adult by the time of ANH but again, does he invoke the type of person that emulates ""fatherhood""? Wether a kind and loving father (which I think is the only type Kenobi could be) or a deadbeat carefree one, it doesn't add up.  We already know in ANH that he is seen by Luke and his aunt and uncle as a mysterious hermit that is essentially alone. That character does not in any way resemble the potential to be a father (at least not one during his time on Tatooine). Even more so after you learn ""Ben"" the hermit is Obi Wan Kenobi, Jedi in hiding, secret protector and guardian of Luke Skywalker, son of Anakin/Vader.  It doesn't add up at all. It would be extremely contrived. It would be much more likely to have Luke having fathered a child during the 30years after RotJ than Kenobi doing so between III and IV and I don't see that happening either. If there's a child from an OT character(s) in the new trilogy it's almost definite it'll be Leia's wether it's with Han or not. A descendant from Kenobi doesn't make any sense at all."
StarWarsLeaks,3c1yrf,TheDugat,14,Sat Jul 4 02:22:31 2015 UTC,"Is the Star Wars universe a place where you can only become significant if you are descended from somebody significant? Do we as fans want it to be such a place?  When I first saw the title ""The Force Awakens"" I assumed it meant that the new movie would feature a rag-tag team of heroes who all discovered, out of the blue, that they were force-sensitive, and followed their struggle with using this power, navigating light vs dark, etc. It seemed fresh and interesting.   Since then, we have wanted to turn all of those heroes into sons or daughters of various OT or PT figures."
StarWarsLeaks,3c1yrf,TrotterSnout,3,Sat Jul 4 04:19:11 2015 UTC,"There will be new characters, for example Maz Kanata and Finn, who are force-sensitive and most likely not related to any one at all. It's just that the main character has to be a Skywalker, because Star Wars revolves around this one family. So yes, we will see new characters discover they are force sensitive, but we will also see the continuation of the Skywalker line in at least one person. Plus, if there is no Skywalker legacy, then what's the point of calling it 'Episode 7""? It might as well be an Anthology film."

I'm all down with the Skywalker lineage being an ongoing thing into the new trilogy, wether there's an Heir from Luke or Leia or even if there's not. I'm down either way. But to have anyone else entering parenthood just to have another lineage connection to the first two trilogies is just, well... Silly. No better words imho."

StarWarsLeaks,3c1yrf,spacebattlebitch,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:15:08 2015 UTC,"You have a valid point but it falls short of the comparison in my opinion. It's reasonable to assume Kenobi withheld the full truth from Luke so as not screw him up about it right off the bat. And by giving the implication Vader killed Anakin to Luke he won't be tempted to the dark side is reasonable as well. On the comparison I can't see any logical reason for Kenobi to withhold truth of his potential fatherhood. Like I said it's plausible, but not likely. And you seem to agree it would be difficult to present and retcon.  In short, I can admittedly see the possibility but with the likelihood it being convoluted and contrived I don't see the story group even giving it a chance. I think it's safe to say they are following  ""safe"" story arcs for now so all the canon media is easily digestible while simultaneously being entertaining but ultimately, just my opinion, I think they're treading logical connections and plots to continue the saga. The Kenobi lineage concept doesn't fit that mold imho."

From a practical standpoint, MVS is 86 years old so I really doubt he will be doing many appearances beyond this movie (not to be a dick but it would probably be a bad idea to lock somebody up that is that old for a trilogy).  So it kind of lines up with what we have heard about him being the leader of the group who is killed by Kylo Ren and crew.   It has been rumored that he is a mentor to Rey.  But nothing about being force sensitive.  Just more of a leader/adopted uncle kind of figure."
StarWarsLeaks,3c1yrf,ugnaught,2,Sat Jul 4 13:52:21 2015 UTC,i cant seem to zoom in to the article to read it properly.   cliffs on what they say to imply this?  if so whom? gleeson? Phasma? Phasma would explain her (hopeful) use of the bantha claw hilt saber
StarWarsLeaks,3c1yrf,yellownotebook,5,Sat Jul 4 01:06:31 2015 UTC,Pure speculation. They have no real evidence to support it.
StarWarsLeaks,3c1yrf,bogaboy,2,Sat Jul 4 01:10:09 2015 UTC,"Basically the author offers that since Rey and Finn are the only major characters with no surnames it leaves the possibility open that Kenobi, unburdened by the now-fallen Jedi Order could have had a child then a grandchild who inherited his Force sensitivity. Not a bad idea, certainly a way to connect all three trilogies but doesn't quite sit right with me."
StarWarsLeaks,3c1yrf,TheYoungUpstart,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:12:14 2015 UTC,It was a wampa claw hilt in the concept art. Banthas don't have claws. They have three-nailed hooves.

StarWarsLeaks,3c1yrf,yellownotebook,2,Sat Jul 4 18:27:02 2015 UTC,...Is Kenobi holding a Nokia?  Edit: I'm an idiot. I zoomed in and that cleared things up.

I'll throw this out there and let me know what you think: could it be possible that MVS's character is Obi Wan's brother, and Rey is this man's daughter? As it doesn't make sense for Obi Wan to be a father."
StarWarsLeaks,3c1yrf,Rogue-3,2,Sat Jul 4 11:11:30 2015 UTC,"LOL they made Adam Driver look so much like Harrison Ford that its funny.  If that lightsaber wasn't in his hand, I would have 100% thought it was Han Solo and not Kylo Ren."
StarWarsLeaks,3c1yrf,RememberYoureAWomble,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:53:32 2015 UTC,"The thing about this rumour is that it's been around for a bit. Here are some articles which mention it, all from around the time of the apparent casting of MRS - not recently: link 1; link 2; link 3. Admittedly those three articles are reporting the same rumour.  It reminds me a little bit of Christopher Lee's casting as Count Dooku for Episode II. Ages before the film was released and around the time it was rumoured (I think rumoured rather than confirmed) he was being cast, I read a little throwaway four-line report of it in a magazine (the Radio Times of all places) which said he had been cast to play a Sith Lord who was due to survive into Episode III. It was quite a big spoiler which turned out to be accurate, but I don't remember reading anything as explicit about his character in any of the official build-up stuff about Episode II. So maybe a wild 'old' rumour about a Kenobi descendant does have some weight. That's not to say that I'd like it to be true!"

StarWarsLeaks,3c1yrf,C3PP,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:37:56 2015 UTC,"I'd be shocked (happily) if there's a Kenobi heir, or even a reference. And I'm all on board with the fact that Kenobi is a compulsive liar (even trying to fool Yoda, ""That boy is our last hope."" ... like, he wasn't there for Leia's birth & hand-off?)  A Kenobi heir would have the added benefit of having an ""unreliable narrator"" back in the fold. Looking back, that ""unreliable narrator"" was generally lacking in the prequels. I think it helps to have false information (or ""from a certain point of view"") for storytelling sake."
StarWarsLeaks,3c1yrf,darthtate,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:28:16 2015 UTC,"I was born in 77 and grew up with star wars. The first movie memory I have is going to a drive-in theater in 1980 and seeing ESB. I was hooked. I'm feeling as if I would actually be ok with this plot point. At first, I wasnt keen on the idea, way back over a year ago when this idea was first floating around.   However, given the authors hypothesis, I feel like this idea might have some punch to it, as well as merit. I know, the haters week be up in arms saying Kenobi was pure, and that he never would've broke his jedi vow, as it were. Yet one might only look to the clone wars tv show to see how he was not immune to the sight of beauty. His love for Satine was real. Who's to say it could not have happened again? Could we expect him to remain celibate and solitary for those 18 years, waiting for Luke to be ready?   I like this idea. Star wars is nothing if not full of surprises, and I feel this has the potential to be another ""I am your father"" moments. I can't wait for December!"
StarWarsLeaks,3c1yrf,erurie,2,Sat Jul 4 01:33:05 2015 UTC,His love for Satine was real.   Definitely. You could see the genuine emotion in his eyes when they were on top of that elephant.

StarWarsLeaks,3c1yrf,digital_chef,0,Sat Jul 4 01:08:32 2015 UTC,"I just re-watched Episode 3 after several years.  I found these plot points interesting:  1- Yoda, Organa and Obi-Wan are sitting around in the last act, deciding what to do with the twins.  Yoda is insistent that they must protect them from the Sith... To me this implies there are more Sith out there.  (my interpretation is plural beyond Vader and Palpatine---something I never really thought was within the realm of possibility, given my understanding from childhood of the original trilogy)  2- During this same point in the film, Yoda reveals that Qui-Gon's force presence has discovered the secret to immortality.  I'd bet good money JJ Abrams brings in Liam Neeson to this new trilogy somehow and perhaps Ewan  3- As the trooper executed the Jedi extermination Order 66, I was struck by how in many of the assassination vignettes many Jedi nearly escaped. There was also language by Obi-Wan, Palpatine, Yoda and Vader in Episode 3 that many Jedi were still alive.  I wouldn't be surprised to see some survivor(s) of this era in the new films (even if they are old or are perhaps species that have greater longevity than humans)"

StarWarsLeaks,3c0sta,thatstarwarsdude,10,Fri Jul 3 20:10:09 2015 UTC,"Some of these are good finds. I'm not sure it calls into question whether the concept art is real though. Presumably it just confirms that artists occasionally need source/comparison material.  It doesn't answer who the skeletor guy is, although my take is that the first one (Luke with skull) is not very close to the concept art (apart maybe from the top lip and teeth) whereas the Adam Driver holding a girl one is very close indeed to the concept art."
