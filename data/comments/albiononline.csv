albiononline,3e1018,zexwrecks,10,Tue Jul 21 03:07:55 2015 UTC,"ArcheAge Alpha was a 9/10 until the 1.2 patch hit where it became a 8/10, after release and the p2w wave it became a 5/10; enjoyable but the p2w aspects ruined any sort of competitive atmosphere the game held for me previously.  Albion Online on the other hand is a 7/10 content wise however with each patch it grows on me more and more; a potential 10/10 with future patches, balance changes, and overhauls."
albiononline,3e1018,Audetastic,5,Tue Jul 21 03:24:25 2015 UTC,It's not released yet so I'm not going to rate it due to the rating being unfair. However I do like the current direction the game has taken.
albiononline,3e1018,Rory-,4,Tue Jul 21 04:58:22 2015 UTC,I give it a solid 8. It is pretty fun. The UI needs a bit of work. And there are balance issues. but nothing that can't be fixed.
albiononline,3e1018,no1nose,2,Tue Jul 21 03:14:53 2015 UTC,Myself 6/10. Gear dependency is too high and crafting is to gated. You will need to be part of a large guild to go to the higher tiers.
albiononline,3e1018,DirtyDiatribe,2,Tue Jul 21 14:22:36 2015 UTC,"I give this a 8/10. They need to find a proper balance between hardcore and casual, which is what they're attempting to do with a free to play game that still caters to an old school audience. Gear is hard to get and fights are few and far between, with a lot of loops you have to jump through to get into an actual fight."
albiononline,3e1018,FightasticMG,2,Tue Jul 21 22:55:05 2015 UTC,Archeage was fun in alpha/beta. Then everything got terrible. It's hard to say since this is earlier in development but I would say either an 8 or 9. UI is giant and awkward and it has there's a few stuttering issues but otherwise very promising. If the persistent elements of the game turn out good it's a game I could definitely see myself playing exclusively.
albiononline,3e1018,snakemud,2,Tue Jul 21 03:36:26 2015 UTC,9/10
albiononline,3e1018,grimrailer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:07:16 2015 UTC,"Probably a 8 or 9. It has a lot of upside and potential with few downsides - some stuff to be expected from an Alpha. PvP matters but I don't think there's much ""outplay potential"" (skill), as it seems to center around positioning (okay, some skill here), gear and coordination."
albiononline,3e1018,motivate18,2,Tue Jul 21 05:58:26 2015 UTC,Albion Online have great potential to be 10/10 game but now it is 7.5/10 and after Closed Beta probably it will become a 8/10 game. After 1.5 years we will see a 9/10 game.Dev team is really great .They are small but small teams always better.They are working hard and care their games more.

albiononline,3e1018,andrewvirts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:02 2015 UTC,8/10 has a ton of potential. Needs a little less grind. Cash shop could kill it if not implemented properly . But overall really enjoyed my Summer Alpha phase.
albiononline,3e1018,blackbow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:12:21 2015 UTC,"Archeage in alpha was 10/10.  Then with 1.2 patch it became a 8/10 IMO because it ruined a lot of things. Then as they added more to the cash shop, gamebreaking exploits/hackers, it declined down to a 5/10.  Albion Online is probably a 5/10 atm. Has potential, but a lot needs to be ironed out. Combat needs to become more skill dependent and provide more ways o outplaying the enemy.  With future patches, it has the potential to be 7/10 or 8/10."
albiononline,3e1018,skilliard4,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:59:04 2015 UTC,"Please Note: I'm rating on its current state. Not where I think it's headed or where I think it's going.  Atm, i'd give it a 5/10. I'm having fun, it's grabbed my attention. But long term as it is right now it wont hold that attention for long without some good solid PvP mechanics that we've yet to see."

albiononline,3dxiib,EdinMiami,6,Mon Jul 20 10:20:53 2015 UTC,I feel like they are working towards focusing on PvP more so than anything else. The open world PvP's biggest flaw in my eyes is the flagging in red zones. If it's truly a full drop full pvp zone when someone enters that zone they should automatically be flagged on entering.  Another interesting change I'd love to see would be give red zone territorys a negative defense bonus forcing those territorys be harder to hold causing greater risk over reward for top guilds.
albiononline,3dxiib,peekapew,4,Mon Jul 20 14:46:46 2015 UTC,"Pvp will develop more after the game is released. There's just not enough people with enough gear to have relevant open world pvp right now since there's only one month of beta. You have to give time for casual players to get to pvp level so you can start seeing more people fighting. Balance is a different issue but again, if you don't have the appropriate amount of players you can't say it's balanced or not because the game expects to have a huge player base."
albiononline,3dxiib,infectuz,4,Mon Jul 20 14:06:01 2015 UTC,"that's not the case. the more time you give 3skull guilds time to craft, the more powerful they'll become - casuals won't be able to compete. Meaning they won't want to loose gear without gain. Because of the anti zerg mechanism they won't have any number advantage and will end up being nuked. End game will just be high tier guilds doing open world pvp against each other for gear... gg."
albiononline,3dxiib,mnmleon,4,Mon Jul 20 14:54:27 2015 UTC,no it is not.  if you think this game will be like Ultima Online no it will not! old Ultima Online was 100x better than Albion Online. Sorry i just burned my $100 because of Ultima Online hype.

I do like PvP, but it's not going to be my focal point  until tier 5 or so. I wish each zone had more than one entrance on either N-S-E-W orientation. You advertise to players/guilds to camp entrances, thus creating zerg mentalities. Give more play styles to the anti-zerg player.  Maybe create a subterranean dungeon layer on some zones like the catacombs of say Diablo. But allow players to travel to the adjacent zones from within. It would give more options of travel for the zerg or grouped players to gain some xp and items on the way to their destination. It would also distribute the population so not all the players are forced through the same choke points."

albiononline,3dxiib,SaltTM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:24:52 2015 UTC,"Is it an open world pvp game at it's core?  Probably not, in the current state I'd consider it along the lines of a they wanted them wanting to focus on the idea of balanced fights.  Albion Online right now seems like a product of how do we defeat the zerg mentality and then the 5v5/10v10 guild pvp was born along with hellgates.  The only true portion of an open world pvp is when just roaming the red/yellow zones and as it stands no one roams red zones [mostly camping city entrances in the yellow zones].   In fact, Albion is quiet a bit safer because I can farm in a protected bubble and then quickly run to a protected crafting area.   No you can't?  I've been in practically every pvp entrance where you gain a bubble and the amount of time it lasts vs the time it takes to get to a farming node and then farm said node... your bubble's long gone by that time.  So maybe you're using some form of metaphor, because that's complete bull.  Not to mention the amount of people that camp the yellow zone entrances.  Other than that yeah I don't consider AO an open world pvp game in comparison to say an eve."

You spend the points in the skill tree in order to master a particular tree.  The amount you have to spend and therefore accumulate grows exponentially.  They have advertised this game as ""You are what you where.""  But it would be more accurate to say, ""You are what you wear, if what you wear is what you are trained to wear.""  If you are wearing Tier 4 cloth and pick up Tier 4 plate you can only wear it if you have trained Tier 4 plate.  As to the comparison to RS, sorry its been too long since I've played to remember."

Maybe allow some animals to drop a portion of raw food (boars im looking at you). Make auto loot possible with 1 click. Temporary stealth if you stay still in a thick forest. Or like you mentioned enable foreground transparency/translucency. Delete all rabbits, or make them useful for atleast something other than target practice. Multiple camera modes, possible basic skymap for a third person chase cam? Deeper zoom and add tilt and rotate.   Deeper farming and cooking trees. More benefits to sticking towards a certain mastery line. Reduction im resource point cost seems useless (for now). Maybe add different color skins to apply to every craftable item for flair. Pets? More enemy variety, more environment variety, dynamic weather. Just some thoughts I could go on and on, but it's not like I'm making the game, really only testing it for them."

albiononline,3dolwg,Varaben,2,Sun Jul 19 13:32:28 2015 UTC,"Melee at the current state of the game is very weak. On the first couple weeks our guild struggled to put parties together because we had too many melees and not enough ranged/healers.  At this point in the alpha most people in our guild have changed their setups around to better accommodate the needs of the guild. I assume the same has gone on in other guilds, meaning few melees are left.  The 3 best melee weapons currently (pretty much the only ones useful in pvp) are two handed weapons, and while you wear a two handed you cannot wear an offhand. Not wearing an offhand means your resistances are lower, which means you die quickly.  As for the three melee weapons that seem to be good at the moment they are:   Claymores, this thing has stupid amounts of damage as well as gap closers, which helps with not dying before you get to them. Flails. AoE silence. That's it. It is incredibly strong by itself, and that alone warrants using the weapon. Polehammers (maybe great hammers too), kings of cc. This thing can interrupt several casts in a large scale battle and be an annoyance in general with its stuns and knockbacks.   1 handed axes are a close contender due to the insane amount of damage they have, but I have not seen anyone use one. Since they have to close that gap and don't have a skill to help I think you are better off with a ranged weapon."

albiononline,3dm1oh,bytestream,6,Fri Jul 17 10:49:59 2015 UTC,"I'm pointing out my current pet-peeves with the alpha so I'm focusing more on the ""right now"" part.  1) Combat system. It simply feels clunky and messy. It gets better with each patch but there's lags and little disruptions that just make it not feel very responive every time. Certainly takes a lot more tweaking until it's just right.  2) Gear progression is a little off atm and big guilds as well as super hardcore guilds are pretty much the only ones that can evolve into the highest tiers due to how it works. (T6+ is crafted in guild owned stations, and everything above T5 is just too expensive to get as a solo/casual player and use in PvP).  This is being worked on, one thing they announced is to reduce the difference between tiers, but atm your best bet as a newcomer is to stay in T4.x(there's iterations in each tier) gear until you've joined a guild.  3) In general, the game is very guild heavy. If you're more of a solo player it's going to be hard. I'm currently soloing as I haven't found the right guild yet, and people wreck me as being in a guild is just sooo much better.   I don't mind, just feel I should point that out.   4) Only 6 skills at any given time, + horse + items. 2 skills from main hand, 1 from  offhand(or 3 from 2hand), 1 from each armor piece. It wants to be like an ARTS, but as I said in point (1) it's not there yet.  This is probably not going to change, but nothing bad if point (1) is fixed.  And last but not least: The Alpha is only lasting 2~ more weeks :(  So if you're looking for a long, polished experience you might want to wait for the next beta where most of those things will be (hopefully) fixed."

albiononline,3dm1oh,Chadwich,2,Fri Jul 17 19:00:58 2015 UTC,"Despite not being able to play this is what games should be doing. They bring it down and actually WORK on the game. When they smoothly transition from alpha directly into beta without any downtown most of their resources get spent on keeping the game running for whiny players and not spent on actually finishing the game. So like I would suggest to any one for any game, don't buy into the alpha if you don't plan on actually testing the game. If all you want to do is play the game wait for it to launch."
albiononline,3dm1oh,kainsshadow,5,Sat Jul 18 08:00:42 2015 UTC,"The current flaw I see in this game is related to the combat.  It's just too simple.  Its clear, from looking at the design, the game was made to be played on phones/tablets. Everything about the combat is painfully simple. Very few abilities. No aiming what so ever. Very little room to outplay your opponent. Tab targeted abilities.  Currently, it comes down to who strikes first or who has the better gear. Using your abilities to somehow overcome the odds is neigh impossible. You only have six abilities to worry about! Only three of those are even combat abilities! How painfully simple is that? Three or four combat abilities you just spam in rotation. Press your escape ability if you'd like to run.  That's combat!  Good players need the tools to shine. Combat needs to have some finesse to it. Some artfulness. A high ceiling where the skilled can shine. A space where a small, elite squad could overtake a larger one because the players are excellent. No chance of that currently and it's too bad."
albiononline,3dm1oh,TheGrammarHero,3,Fri Jul 17 12:14:05 2015 UTC,The only flaw I personally have felt for myself (only been playing a couple days) is I wish they didn't develop the game with android or IOs involved. My Tab can't run this so I wish they just focused on it being a pc/mac game and actually used my PC hardware xD If I ever got a gaming tablet though the perks to having this game on the go would be great but it just doesn't apply to me or plenty of others.
albiononline,3dm1oh,kainsshadow,3,Fri Jul 17 10:55:14 2015 UTC,"The game is literally only farming. If you like farming, have fun."
albiononline,3dm1oh,TheGrammarHero,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:02:30 2015 UTC,That's actually not a problem. Farming can be quite relaxing after a stressful day at work (my job can be really annoying at times) if it is done with a couple of friends and a glass of wine.
albiononline,3dm1oh,TheGrammarHero,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:41:07 2015 UTC,"He literally means farming not grinding lol like farming trees, animals, crops, materials etc. You do grind monsters for some materials but you farm materials without killing a lot haha though obviously you have to pvp for those materials later in the game."
albiononline,3dm1oh,Suuperdad,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:03:27 2015 UTC,"ONLY farming. You farm to get better gear to farm better things to get better gear. It's 100% linear, no surprises."

albiononline,3dm1oh,K1ngN0thing,2,Sat Jul 18 19:08:15 2015 UTC,"The game because it reminded me of Runescape. But in Runescape there was interesting quests, more open interaction between players, minigames, and if I found a cool item chances were I'd be able to use it. It's like Runescape but the only 2 things you have to do is train your Woodcutting or your Mining skills."
albiononline,3dm1oh,sw4nson6,2,Sat Jul 18 21:38:21 2015 UTC,"A reason not to buy the game? I have none. It has it's flaws, but it's an alpha, and they are working on them. There aren't any games like this out there (I know about AoC, Crowfall, etc... but IMO this is the best of the lot - at least for my tastes).   A reason not to spend $100? The alpha is almost over (7 days left only, roughly), so I would just go with the beta pack, which I believe is about 30 bucks."
albiononline,3dm1oh,Rory-,2,Fri Jul 17 12:40:58 2015 UTC,"A reason? If it's mainly to play the game it is a complete waste. The alpha ends in less than a week, and then we're waiting months for beta.   Sorry, you want me to list flaws..  1) Alpha ends in days.   2) It will more than likely be an IAP (in-app purchases) ruled game. You have crafting energy. Once that runs out (which probably will not take long in full release, we are given a lot because we are testing the alpha) there will of course be a convenient option to buy Donuts.. I mean Gems.. I mean Diamonds.. sorry, I mean Gold, to craft more that day.   3) The combat is broken.  4) There is no punishment for ganking lower levels, so higher levels have no reason to stop. No reason not to grief. And people can, do, and will continue to grief you.  Over all, I like the game a lot, but I am genuinely scared that this will be, like every single mobile game ever created in the past 5+ years, will be owned and ruled by IAP's."

If it makes you feel any better, however, I was reluctant about buying the 100usd pack so I waited until this alpha to play. Since the start of the month I have decided to upgrade my pack to the 100$ pack and I have regretted not buying it earlier.  At the end of the day it's up to you, but if you think you will like the game there's no reason not to support it."

Paying 100$ or 50 $ in itself isnt a problem, 20 dollars is too much spent in my eyes if a game is crappy. 30$ seems reasonable to me to try what i see in this game( for now), so i'll just wait it out.  Glad to know you even upgraded your pack, it gives me some hope that the game is good . From what i'm seing it has alot of potential."

albiononline,3de67t,zerus_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:32:54 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that we're talking about a 15 people dev team here. You played Echo of Soul before which is made/published by aeriagames - thats a 600 people company. So it's pretty unfair to compare.  It's not meant as an excuse for bad support but I think you should consider that fact when dealing with them - they probably have not yet optimized their workflows etc for that and afaik they're even stating they can't give support as if this was the live version.  So don't be mad at them, do the refund and wait until they have figured things out!"
albiononline,3de67t,grimrailer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:10:31 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure. I wasn't trying to compare the two. I never had an issue with EOS so I am not even sure how their support is.   Normally I find the bigger companies are the ones that give less support and the smaller ones are normally more eager to help out though.   But with this situation I was told it is not possible to flag my account with the Founder status, not possible to switch the status, and not possible to switch emails of an account, and not possible to help me at all.   Their version of support equated to, ""We cannot support you at all. Ask for a refund"".   You could be right though perhaps they just haven't implemented a system to offer support in that area. That doesn't make Horrible support justified though. Especially when they have a system that sends out keys with a blank email/blank text that is suppose to have a key in it."

Since you're trying to gain traction from an MMO game while streaming and if you have a MMO past then talk about that :)  gl streaming, remember numbers will stay low for a long time so don' get discouraged.  You'd be surprised that having even 10+ users is above average for most streamers.  There's a huge gap when it comes to streaming: 1000k+, 400+, 100+, 50+, 10+.  Good luck with your stream."

The honeymoon phase is over and a lot of the more serious players have realized that Conflict has no actual organization and certainly not enough organization to take and hold territory.    We have been paying a 15% tax and receive essentially nothing in return.  People are told if they go on raids their gear will be replaced, but it doesn't happen or it happens days after the fact when you have already replaced your own gear.  Conflict identifies itself as a Mercenary guild and doesn't plan to keep and hold territory.  But the truth is that the officers just don't want to do the work necessary to organize the guild into anything resembling a threat to other guilds.  They are, and will continue to be, a feeder guild.  This is great if you are an officer benefiting from the taxes collected; not so much if you are one of the masses."

There is just to much upside to running around with groups of thugs and trolling people."

There's plenty of nice guilds and good communities you can find a place in, but you will always have to contend with assholes at some point.

albiononline,3dbwi9,PutinOnCalories,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:18:37 2015 UTC,"Technically it still uses anti-zerg formula, so with enough people in the AoE, it can still do damage.   That being said, having that many people stand in the much much smaller aoe area is unlikely."

albiononline,3d6dcu,dere00,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:22:44 2015 UTC,"There's no easy way around this. Fame farming is a grind and that is the way it is. Your best bet for fame is doing green/blue dungeons.  Most green dungeons are easily done solo, while some may require a small group (4-5 players). While fame is split among the group having more players means quicker clear, and thus more fame.  For blue dungeons you will want a larger setup with a balanced group and ~3+ healers."

albiononline,3d3qat,Soperos,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:21:32 2015 UTC,I've been just trying out all the tier 4 weapons since they are pretty quick to unlock. Gives me a good feel for all the gear and what my opponents can do but I won't be sad from the wipes.
albiononline,3d3qat,Sevlins,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:54:48 2015 UTC,"Not really worth 50 bucks for two weeks, unless the early backer rewards are worth it to you."
albiononline,3d3qat,Soperos,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:42:09 2015 UTC,depends what access to the beta requires. Not sure how they intend to gate that.

albiononline,3d3qat,Varaben,2,Mon Jul 13 13:35:05 2015 UTC,Then don't invest a lot of time.   I take this as a training course. When it goes full release we will all know what to do.

albiononline,3d3qat,Keyboard_Cowboys,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:43:28 2015 UTC,"Most things seem to ""work"" in Alpha, but it's not a pretty sight in many cases. Look at the spell animations; they are pretty much non-existent. Also, the number of players in the game now is probably a tiny fraction of what the actual game will need to withstand.   A lot of testing is on network bandwidth, load balancing, etc. A responsive game is incredibly important. Sure it runs with a few hundred people online, but what about thousands? I agree though, it seems to be in pretty much working order right now, but it's late Alpha so that shouldn't be surprising.  The game has to be pretty much done in order to start beta testing. That's where balance happens, content gets tested, etc."
albiononline,3d3qat,protatoe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:38:01 2015 UTC,"Lot of changes to come.  PvP community don't like some aspects to yellow and red zones, gatherers/farmers don't like certain aspects of fame gain & the cost of early farming.  Then there's a big debate on the cost between T3 and T4.  There's a snowball effect once you can craft T4 stuff early on where you can get really ahead before everyone once you know what you're doing during a new wipe.  tl;dr - there's a lot of things needing to be tweaked, plus all the community feedback.  I'd rather them polish than rush a broken system in some regards.  Closed beta will have wipes, but it won't be limited to 4 week intervals like the alphas.  So if you want to invest 30 bucks do so this fall."

albiononline,3d278a,Hecaton,2,Mon Jul 13 12:37:21 2015 UTC,"Future wise, a graph comparing the relative raw powers of the various items tier/level wise might be nice.  How good is a 5.5 compared to an 8.0 for example. With LP intended as a long term gating to the game, planning out your path is going to be required."
albiononline,3d278a,Sevlins,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:01:55 2015 UTC,Great idea! I will put it on my to-do list. But what do you mean with LP exactly?
albiononline,3d278a,Sevlins,2,Mon Jul 13 13:31:29 2015 UTC,"Learning points. In the destiny board check the top of the tab and you'll see how many you have currently.  You generate 50ish a day, and in end game trees a single mastery costs more than 1000. I saw Bercilak mention that this is intended to be an EVE like system where your progression is time gated. Under current mechanics, it's roughly 94 years if you wanted to max everything. Obviously the key here is don't be an idiot and think you need to max everything to play the game (you really really don't).  So, although you progress at a crawl speed at first (progression is really weird, t3>4 is far worse than t4>5 or 5>6), after two weeks of hardcore play you hit a brick wall where LP costs become your primary limiter."

albiononline,3d1j64,CHClClCl,5,Sun Jul 12 19:31:16 2015 UTC,Alpha ends the end of the month. Beta could start a week later or it could be 2-4 months (most likely at least a month after the end of alpha). There will be a wipe after alpha and at least one more wrote at the end of the closed beta.
albiononline,3d1j64,TheBG,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:55:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  One more question if you don't mind, what's the difference between level 1 closed beta access and closed beta access?"
albiononline,3d1j64,stingo5,2,Sun Jul 12 20:01:56 2015 UTC,I believe it's simply how early you get access to the closed beta.
albiononline,3d1j64,GodivatheGood,2,Sun Jul 12 20:08:03 2015 UTC,We don't know for sure but based on the way Alpha's have worked it's a difference of 24 hours.
albiononline,3d1j64,Soperos,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:56:21 2015 UTC,"According to some people here it explains in full detail on their website. If that's the case it sure is odd so many people need to ask.   The answer is, besides those geniuses, nobody knows."
albiononline,3d1j64,mediares,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:18:12 2015 UTC,Does the current alpha include access to iOS builds?
albiononline,3d1j64,TheBG,2,Wed Jul 15 21:49:53 2015 UTC,"No, not until release (or open beta)."
albiononline,3d1j64,Belrox,3,Wed Jul 15 22:21:59 2015 UTC,I am really hoping beta starts soon after alpha.  This game is so fun on many different levels.  I absolutely love it.  At first I was kind of skeptical about it and really didn't know what to expect.  So I bought the 50.00 pack.  I am so in love with this game I am upgrading simply to support the game and the perks for 100.00 are really worth it.  By far the best time I've had in an online game in a long time.
albiononline,3d1j64,Soperos,2,Mon Jul 13 01:08:38 2015 UTC,Same. Minus spending 100.
albiononline,3cv9ls,Belrox,4,Sat Jul 11 01:42:18 2015 UTC,I don't think this would solve anything; if anything it would make it harder for low levels.  Player scouts -> scout + friends flags up 50% faster -> snipes low level.  I don't see what it solves aside from people who want to play hero will be able to flag in 50% quicker  Some questions:   Can you actually see on the minimap where people are flagging up at? Wouldn't it be better to change that than making it faster to flag up?   Edit: Wording
albiononline,3cv9ls,SaltTM,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:03:21 2015 UTC,You can't see anyone who is flagged unless they are in a large group.
albiononline,3cv9ls,GGtesla,3,Sat Jul 11 22:57:46 2015 UTC,I really hate how long skills are disabled after getting off a horse.  Essentially if you are on a mount you can't attack anything it was most likely put in to make roaming zerg gankings harder but it seems too long.  I've died several times because I have no skills  The other obvious things is it forces you to run if your on a mount like see one red you want to kill but your on a mount then its time to run away

However -- YES there is a FUCK TON of grinding if you're going solo. Some people have it easy and their guilds feed them so they can be part of the Guilds ""A-Team"" for 5v5 attack and defense on territories. For the rest of us, I'd estimate a good 30-40% of our time is either walking around or looking at a green progress bar while we gather/refine/craft shit.   Not to bash the game. It's hella fun and I hardly notice the grind, but others may feel different.  In terms of PvP, there's currently a sort of strange system of flagging as a hostile in order to attack, then deflagging to avoid being attacked by unflagged people. It's kind of a wonky mechanic, however I have experienced decent amounts of open world PvP. It just requires a little bit of planning on when to flag as hostile. The mechanic is decent but implementation is not good yet. PvP still occurs ALOT though. There are also 3 zones -- green (safe/no PvP), yellow  (PvP but no full loot), and red (3 skulls, PvP and full loot)."

They've changed it to a hybrid system where zones are Green/Yellow/Red. Green zones are no PVP, Yellow have limited, and Red is full. But even in the PVP zones you have to flag.   To be honest I haven't experienced that much PVP because the grind was off putting in the early game and I decided not to invest that much time since the Alpha is only a month long and POE expansion launches today."

I do miss the old school Ultima Online to a point but I do like to have some questing there. Also the open PVP PKING kinda made the game unplayable for me..  I heard there is no story line or questing.. is that true?
albiononline,3ct08g,FightasticMG,2,Fri Jul 10 16:19:33 2015 UTC,"There is no storyline, there are little mini quests (missions) that are possible to do for decent rewards.  If you don't mind grinding, and don't really prefer open pvp pking but rather semi regulated pvp, then the current state of the alpha is probably perfect for you."
albiononline,3ct08g,motivate18,2,Fri Jul 10 16:41:57 2015 UTC,"It's quite similar to UO in ways, questing is basically unexistant (typical sandbox) but some NPC's have work orders thats like collect X and Y and they give you reputation/silver or something. Again - no storyline, its a sandbox MMO. The open PvP/PKing is only in red zones. I would highly encourage you join a guild that fits your needs."
albiononline,3ct08g,SaltTM,2,Fri Jul 10 18:26:28 2015 UTC,"Don't buy an alpha, only spend money if you like the idea and plan on supporting the development of the game.  If you just want to play just wait until closed beta or open beta.  I've spent probably 8 hours a day since the CA started on the 30th and I'm a solo player,  the pvp zones there's 3 tiers pve, soft pvp and lose everything.  Right now it's best to duo in the pvp brown/yellow zone as there's a handful of people pvping there (hostile alert thing and anti zerg options) as for the red zone I feel like people are just scared right now to go there.  I ran naked through there and the population was fairly low.  The thing about yellow zones though is they can knock you out, so you don't necessarily lose your stuff, but you do drop silver as if you're a mob (Not from your silver bank though), it's almost as if each person is worth a certain amount of silver if they haven't died, like a human mob.  Is the game enjoyable and has taken 2 weeks of my time? Yes.  Will I ever tell someone to purchase an alpha just to play?  If you really put that into context and say it out loud ""I'm buying an alpha"" it sounds stupid, but when you put it into a way of ""I'm support development and getting to test the game and curve the development for the better"" sure I'd say go for it.  I have the legendary pack and fully support them finishingthis game because there's nothing like it right now in terms of an isometric game.  It's everything I've been waiting for and more.  This and crowfall will get a lot of hours from me.  Edit: Yes there's no story line, there's no forced questing (optional, but if you want silver or ended up broke somehow [been there] questing is a good way to make silver and earn royal sigils which you can use for royal gear only crafted from these vendors if you have access to them by leveling up your questing - early on it's easy to do these because you get silver and still work towards your destiny board and you can choose the type of 'quests' you work towards either fighting/crafting/gathering).  Everything is build around this thing called the destiny board (google destiny board albion online or youtube it) and there's different paths you can take.  You can take the full PVP route where you level up your pvp gear and unlock higher tiers, you can go the farming route and raise animals for cooking or raise mounts or just have a normal farm by raising ingredients for people who want to cook.  Then you have the right side of the destiny board which is for crafting where you get the ability to craft tools, weapons and the refine resources to higher tiers.  The whole point is to have goals do you want to be able to craft high tier gear/tools/refined resources or do you want to just use high tier gear or do you want to be a jack of all trades.  Then there's dungeons, vet dungeons (like the red pvp zone you can lose everything to mobs if you die once - you can go back and pick it up though if someone else doesn't.), hellgates pvp dungeons (two entrances, big boss, fight other users at te end of the dungeon) thing is there's no guarantee people will be in these dungeons so you never know if another group is in there with you and you can lose all your gear to another group.  Then there's the guild battles for territory.  There's a lot to do and it's all fun and rewarding.  Every role in this game is useful from start to finish."

I've had more fun playing Albion than I have had in an MMO since Ultima, and I played EQ, Runescape, WoW, Darkfall etc. Albion isn't entirely open PVP. There are safe zones as well as ""Yellow Zones"" where you can be killed but not lose your gear. The red zones are open loot though."

albiononline,3ctg6b,Flasteria,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:45:09 2015 UTC,"This sounds correct. The further out in the PVP zones your guild goes to get a territory the cheaper the refining cost is, but red zones have little to no tier 3 or below, so you'd still need the main cities or a territory in a yellow zone to get tier 3 materials to make tier 4+."

From what I've seen those quests typically give a few thousand silver, and reward you with 10+ high tier commendations that can be redeemed for gear of that tier. In some of the deeper red zones I was seeing quests that would give tier 6 commendations, so with a few of those quests you could be rewarded with a high level weapon or armor"
albiononline,3cpbce,harumphhh,2,Thu Jul 9 21:29:10 2015 UTC,be nice if they had runescape like quests where you need a certain skill to do it and then got rewarded with xp in that skill

Cooler monsters, more interesting settings, rare events that occur, etc."
albiononline,3cpbce,Soperos,2,Fri Jul 10 00:44:20 2015 UTC,"thats what i want. Maybe not quests in the traditional sense, but just something else to add more variety to the game. Ive been playing for the past week and so far ive been using like the 3rd weapon i got, been to like 7 or 8 locations that all seem more or less the same, and killed foxes, wolves, and a couple of different kinds of men over and over again. It just gets boring to me, and i wish there was more places that made me want to explore and go out of my way to try and accomplish something besides killing 480 things so i can get a little bit better sword to kill like 800 more things."
albiononline,3cpbce,harumphhh,3,Fri Jul 10 15:05:17 2015 UTC,"I agree that there simply needs to be more stuff in this sandbox because you're 100 percent right at the moment.  Each zone is a square field, populated animals coming from a pool of maybe 6 or 7 different kinds with maybe some humanoid enemies thrown in for good measure. Sometimes there's a creek, other times there's a building to look at or some cliffs but generally speaking if you've seen 6+ zones, you've seen them all. Even the cities are largely the same, so if you've been to one then why bother going to visit others?   If this game is going to attract a viable population so that everyone can have fun, the world simply needs to be more interesting.   Making the world more interesting though does NOT mean incorporating theme park elements because the game is attractive because it is a sandbox. Not because it is trying to be the perfect MMO, or appeal to every sort of player, but because it is aiming to be a fantasy sandbox MMO in a market that has been craving a good one for a while.   Here's just one simple idea that would result in a zone that would add some ambiance, interest, and life into the world of Albion. The idea is a simple ""ruined city of the dead"" located deep in the red zones. The zone could take existing city designs and ruin them up, make them look dilapidated, and then create a fairly round city out of them. The edge of the city could feature a spooky looking forest, or just a regular forest with the day/night cycle darkened so that day is close to regular night and night is particularly dark. Throw some cheap and easy glowing eyes in the forest (think the darkshire area in WoW), populate it with wolves and whatnot. Then the edge of the city could have some undead, with more advanced undead towards the center with some necromancers making an appearance until, at the very center, there is a larger structure (cathedral-looking would be boss) filled with necromancer type enemies. Throw in a dungeon located in this cathedral and you're suddenly reaping some of that sweet Diablo nostalgia, and you can even throw in a nifty boss at the bottom.  BOOM! Suddenly there's a story, a point of interest on the map. Did the necromancers cause all of this, or were they magic users drawn to the powerful source of dark magic in the cathedral? Players from all over the map would make trips to this place.   Those sorts of things are critical to this game in my opinion because they give players an escape from the grind. They also give players a reason to travel around, and break up the grind. Let's say I'm a T4/T5 player, and my friends/guild and I are tired of gathering resources around tormouth. We load up our mounts with some supplies, plot the safest course we can to the nearest city/town to this place, make our way, stash our backup/return equipment at the town and then we make our way into the city of the dead to see what's up. It'd be a fun trip.   Take this same concept and extend it to other ideas such as ""dragon mountain"", deep woods filled with ents/druids/golems/nymphs(?) who are fighting back against the players sweeping through and wrecking the woods, the giant king's castle, a vampire clan's fortress, etc.  Without that sort of stuff, the world of Albion feels like it lacks character. Plus, these additions are entirely within the sandbox PvP theme because it gives players a reason to move around (see cool stuff, obtain lots of silver) and explore the world rather than exclusively carving out their corner of the world and staying put."
albiononline,3cpbce,dere00,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:56:42 2015 UTC,Thats exactly the kind of thing i want. Part of why i love games like WOW and LOTRO is that i see some sort of landmark or location that i want to get to and i work my way up so i can get there. there was a sense that i was working towards something bigger and i wanted to keep playing and leveling up. For me right now though in albion i dont have that at all. I just feel like what im working towards is just the same weapons and armor i have now but with better stats.

The thing that i'm most excited about this game is the pvp, not PVE, and from what i saw, this is what the developers wanted, a more pvp focused game.

In games like wow and eso theres people playing as all sorts of races and classes and using all sorts of different weapons and abilities. But so far ive been playing for hours and ive only had like 4 different weapons that are only different in that they are a little bit better then the previous ones. and im only really using 2 slightly different abilities.

They need a revamp for both pve and pvp . underperforming actually . official forum and dev approve this and change will come. Pike is fine because of skills but the rest is really far behind all other bow staff etc ...
albiononline,3cp153,Eckala,2,Thu Jul 9 17:01:54 2015 UTC,"I'm new to this game, but been playing since the second day of alpha.  I decided to sort of try and build a paladin (all t5 atm).  As far as I can see a mace paladin is not really viable atm.   On hit I receive 61 health back which is OK for tier 4 mobs but when your running t5 5mans with 4mob pulls its obviously not doing much.   There is also a decent, 15 second cool down, 1 second heal on it that is garbage for two reasons.   A) if your being attacked that cast can be interrupted   b) it costs 1/4 of your mana and we are already really mana starved.  I'll add as a side note it costs 4-5k to reforge a weapon when I got rid of the shit heal, and I was watching a stream yesterday when someone said they had a 50k repair bill (it would be nice if these prices can come down)    Now thats my personal experience of melee this alpha.  Generally melee could use some love:  There is not a lot of flavour compared to all the cool mage spells  Melee feels mana starved, this may be specific to mace users but in 4 pulls I'm generally already out of mana, doing 5 mans having mage's wait on their tank to get mana sucks. Slightly faster Regen may help this issue.  Plate armor is pretty shit, I personally rock a leather chest because at least I get a OP self heal, I'm no expert on plate but I know it needs some work. Heck I even get more hp from my leather chest compared to same tier plate.  I wouldn't mind them testing plate providing substantial health increase, a lot of other classes would try and wear some plate for health but full plate users would get additional defence in the form of health. Mage get shield, plate users should get more hit points which would help with balance.  I've only just started pvping so I'll stop ranting like an expert because I'm not."
albiononline,3cp153,GGtesla,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:06:18 2015 UTC,"Leather is better earlier, it sucks later. You can't tank as leather, so you are probably killing just tier 4 mobs. When going further, i believe you will suffer, and you won't be able to be the tank for sure.  Most melee users i see use leather shoes, plate chest and helmet.  Only used sword and axe, but t4.2 claymore isn't that bad to me. Broadsword sucks. Worst item."

Full loot PvP means a lot of newb players are going to start playing, get some gear, lose everything, and never play again. I'm really surprised this game is trying to go free-to-play. I'll believe it if it's still there at launch.  As for gold, right now it can't be used for much actually. This is very disappointing because it felt nice to start the game with a pool of ""silver"" that you could use to buffer refining/crafting/upkeep costs for a little while at least. That felt worth the $99 bucks I spent. (I feel I've already got my money worth by playing a kick ass game for 3 alphas now).  I hope they move back towards gold being some use.  I can see them using gold to fund Skillpoint resets, or even Skillpoint potions. It's not strict pay to win in that regard, it just helps someone diversify a bit, or push a little deeper in a tier before they run out. An advantage yes. Big enough to warrant pay to win cries? Possibly."
albiononline,3cnsoj,Suuperdad,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:49:23 2015 UTC,"I think that actually free to play model is actually a benefit for a lot of people new to sandbox games to give it a try, full loot or not, better try and never play again than not trying at all because of the price tag. Eventually some would stick for a while. The actual issue with f2p model is that it will be easier for gold sellers to mess up. The difference here is the launch graph and its decay overtime, f2p starts big and goes down quickly creating a mountain like curve, b2p/subscription ones are more like a smoother hill, less people starts due to paywall and more retained proportionally overtime. Yet overall, the f2p has usually the edge to retain in terms of absolute revenue.  Regarding the pay to win, when you look at the big picture any mmo with some sort of goals is pay to win, whether is in-game gold, powerups, items or the whole account, if there is something that can be traded for real money either through sanctioned plex like flow or third party, it's pay to win. It's the perception of each user and their threshold to accept a certain level of pay to win that makes the difference. Again, in absolute terms, any mmo with goals IS pay to win, the community it creates defines  what's acceptable, and if it's toward an Eve-like one, pay to win is pretty much accepted  The pack is strategically built, this is going to give an edge for competitive play, edge multiplied if all guild members are legendary only (think about what you can do when a guild starts with 20 mules bringing x00% resources around all day long for starters). This is going to work out a bit like Clash of Clans, the ones who are going to start first with clear ideas of what to do in the next few months, what branches specialise for the rest of their game time, all with legendary packs are going to dominate the competitive scene, anyone coming to play weeks later or even worse months later is going to either be a support char or have no chance as this is a time-gated game, and actually fits well the mobile scene, more than the traditional pc-based mmo."

albiononline,3cnsoj,Soperos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:27:37 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't bothered using my gold for anything yet. There is a gold market which will let people trade in game silver for gold. The price is, like pretty much everything, player set. Because we all have gold atm its trading anywhere from 1:1 to 1:5. People can play this market like any other.   Best part of the top pack is the ox and horse.  That's roughly 4-20 days of farming depending if you want to buy it or craft it, how much time you spend in the game, and the current market price. Since the silver update it's really only 2 hours farming silver to get it, so I imagine the price might go up. Or the silver drop rate go down. Whatever it is."
albiononline,3cnsoj,Oscar_Geare,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:19:11 2015 UTC,the ox and horse is literally ~36 hours of farming disregarding saddler time which can be done in that ~36 hours

albiononline,3cnsoj,justmorrow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:57:46 2015 UTC,"The Gold currency is a premium currency, similar to PLEX in EVE, that you buy with real life cash from their store and you can use it to activate a premium account.   They have said they wanted the silver currency tied to a real-life value, that way in the future when people have higher tiered items we can talk about how we lost armor worth X amount of dollars in an epic PVP battle OR just feel good knowing how much our gear is worth.  What we don't know is how much this Premium Account status will cost, either in Gold or Real currency, and what benefits it will grant. I believe they've also said that Gold will be used in a cosmetic store for skins, fluff, etc. and possibly potions that restore learning points and/or crafting points."

albiononline,3cmfo4,skilliard4,2,Thu Jul 9 06:05:10 2015 UTC,"It does have value -- in the form of inflated silver. And its value won't decrease because silver is a farmable commodity, aka it increases in number whilst gold is static right now and none is being recycled into the system.   This won't happen during public launch when gold has use other than silver trading."
albiononline,3cmfo4,FightasticMG,3,Thu Jul 9 06:15:03 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have intrinsic value though, you can't use it for anything in the alpha. I suppose it'll have value if people use it as a currency.  Well, I'm not complaining. I guess I can offshore my 12K gold to get silver to experiment with things in alpha, and get it back during CBT/launch, so this just benefits me."
albiononline,3cmfo4,skilliard4,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:18:26 2015 UTC,You are able to use gold to craft vanity items like banners with the guild logo on it.
albiononline,3cmfo4,Brain_Food,2,Thu Jul 9 11:45:22 2015 UTC,I don't know exactly what happened with gold but there is plenty of people bragging about making 4mill + off gold. Considering gold has little to no use ATM I'm fairly confident there is or was a bug / exploit being used. Making several mil silver off a useless in game item seems unlikley.
albiononline,3cmfo4,GGtesla,2,Thu Jul 9 01:29:06 2015 UTC,I know some people are buying up lots of gold in hope of a patch that will make it useful. Since it's alpha there's not much to lose so I think it's possible that people bought lots of gold for 1s and then sold it all at 10+s.
albiononline,3cmfo4,TheBG,2,Thu Jul 9 01:55:53 2015 UTC,"It's not really exploiting a bug in the market, it's just that the market is not suitable for trading right now really, because nobody is pumping gold or adding gold back into the game since it's in Alpha stage. The market will be more stable (or maybe even more volatile making for some interesting trading) when public launch hits and people start actually purchasing gold with IRL money."
albiononline,3cmfo4,FightasticMG,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:54:24 2015 UTC,"I paid silver on top of my starter gold, and sold yesterday before the patch, giving up that after 9 days of 1:1, because you can't use gold to buy anything. Today I see 1g will get me 10s.... no way that just happened. I see it similar to how I bought my island for 2500s a day or two after my friend paid 5000s. They have to be messing with it, and it's driving me crazy."
albiononline,3cmfo4,Kynolin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:16:34 2015 UTC,Its a player controlled economy so the devs have nothing to do with it. And its alpha and gold has no use so far so I guess ppl want to trade it for silver to ppl that think they will save their gold for beta. @Kynolin they patched some reduce in prices. I payed around 5k for mu island so if you got it for 2500 you should be glad not mad... The also lowerd the region tax by 50% so thats seems to effect purchase of island aswell.
albiononline,3clfxl,hue_lele,4,Wed Jul 8 20:44:46 2015 UTC,"Sounds good in theory, but hard to implement in game- would be annoying if though because people would just make player walls block players from areas and ect."

albiononline,3cjk9j,HilariousRansoms,3,Wed Jul 8 15:11:58 2015 UTC,"From my experience over the past few days:  Cities are populated, marketplaces are decently stocked, the global chat is active enough, and popular zones (even green ones) are sometimes packed to the point of overcrowdedness.   I'd say the population on this single alpha server is probably medium-low for what the devs have in mind for a release server."
albiononline,3cjk9j,harumphhh,3,Wed Jul 8 16:39:45 2015 UTC,At this moment the population is decent. You need to remember this game is still in the testing phase and has not been released yet (it won't be released till sometime next year).  The only people playing are founders who donated. Once release occurs the population will hopefully be much higher.
albiononline,3cjk9j,General_Georges,2,Wed Jul 8 16:43:41 2015 UTC,It's busy you will see people often but it still needs some work
albiononline,3cjk9j,jjb985,3,Wed Jul 8 13:12:46 2015 UTC,"Needs work?  It's a 100/50 dollar backer amount. There's 10k+ people on the leader boards I'd say that's way more people than you'd see in any other alpha w/ that entry amount.  I'd expect to see that number quadruple during closed beta as the amount is more approachable (30usd) and people seem to be interested on forum boards, twitch chats, etc...  I don't think it'll beat out any MMO any time soon, but it definitely doesn't need some work when it comes to how active this alpha has been lately.  More is welcome, but it's definitely not doing bad right now."
albiononline,3cjk9j,SaltTM,2,Wed Jul 8 17:32:14 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstand the word ""work"" and it's meaning. Nothing whatsoever about player base or population.  Needs more work yes.  The systems are great but it's very craft heavy til about t3 before you can branch off. I will be a crafter but they promise people that they can play the way they want but really you can't til you farm for about 16+ hours. I think it's a great game and not many bugs for alpha but I'm looking forward to them tweaking and filling out the content more. I'm in many alphas/betas and it's one I'm really excited for."

When you go into a PVP area it will change to - Hostile: 4 That means there's 4 people who are flagged for PvP (and are probably looking for you!).  I'm not sure if they (flagged for PVP) see a friendly or a hostile counter.

albiononline,3cjk9j,kirtpar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:03:22 2015 UTC,The game will only have the one server even after release. The map will be much bigger apparently. But still all players will share 1 single world.
albiononline,3clqg1,Belrox,2,Wed Jul 8 22:00:27 2015 UTC,"They said it's possible it could be right after alpha ends or it could be months, it all depends on how many things they decide to rework. Right now the game is pretty solid but they still need to implement castles (they work now but are just for show), cosmetics/gold shop (non P2W), more skills/spells and whatever else they decide to add/change. My guess is 1-2 months after the alpha is over but that's purely a guess."

You don't really seem to care about this on the other videos. Stop commenting on mine if you don't enjoy them at this point, that's the way I look at it now, you have some sort of bias already from our past conversation.   Not to mention, the game is composed of people moving around and talking, and I'm attempting to give people a decent look into the game they'll be playing in case they want to drop 50-100 on it.  Even looking at your comment history -- another video you watched was an unedited GvG of random people talking and fighting. You didn't have any issue with it being unedited, or with random people talking. So I'm not sure what you have against mine.  EDIT: Now, I appreciate your feedback, and thanks for viewing and taking the time to make some attempt at feedback on them. I'm not trying to say that you're mean.

albiononline,3ceq3z,ManaPot,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:59:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't 100% count on it. From what I read and undestand, they'll only be doing it for populer personalities within the community.  For example, if someone took the name ""pewdiepie"", and he wanted his name, they would free it up for him. But if you had the name ""kyle"", and someone else takes it, they probably won't help you out. It's mostly just to keep people from impersonating other players."

albiononline,3c93ri,GGtesla,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:53:51 2015 UTC,"So wait , the anti zerg mechanics mean if you have a large group vs another large group people can still one shot half your group?  That seems a little broken, at what number of players do these mechanics come into play?  No wonder in all the pvp videos ive seen the winning group has been essentially all magic casters.  Personally I like fairly large scale pvp but as I understand it both groups were large (and received the debuff) so whoever casts the first good Meteor wins? man reminds me of archeage lul"
albiononline,3c93ri,MetallicDragon,3,Mon Jul 6 10:23:17 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that dying to this can be avoided by not grouping up so closely, so as to encourage spreading out and using tactics instead of a big ball of people mindlessly mowing over everything in their way. If you're in a big group versus another big group, they'll have to use strategy and such instead of simply having the larger group win."
albiononline,3c93ri,Audetastic,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:31:20 2015 UTC,"Having long cast time abilities that can still 1 shot large numbers of players is not gameplay nor does it promote any type of skillful strategy. With the fear of abilities that can 1 shot in such a way in a FULL LOOT PVP GAME, players and smarter groups can hold bottlenecks and chain pre-cast these abilities and hold a spot indefinitely if played properly."
albiononline,3c93ri,GGtesla,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:25:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like most of the time there is nowhere to spread out. The nature of magic (ranged aoe & dot damage) will always be good in group play of any type. Right now though it seems you want some plate for pve and pretty much 90% casters for PvP.  This alpha I tried to play a paladin , but for beta I'll certainly be playing a caster."
albiononline,3c93ri,Redbeardt,2,Thu Jul 9 01:51:51 2015 UTC,"The damage scales up with each additional person in the AoE.  Personally, I think the idea is sound, but there's obviously always room to tweak the radius and damage scaling."

albiononline,3c93ri,harumphhh,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:47:41 2015 UTC,What exactly happened here? I can't imagine that the meteor was a player ability unless it had an absurd cast time or something.
albiononline,3c93ri,DynamicStatic,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:02:34 2015 UTC,"It's a player ability with ~5 seconds cast IIRC and then there is some time before the thing actually hits the ground. Being a T4 L3 item it means the item used was actually Tier 6, normally it wouldn't do that much damage it's just that the more people a skill hits the more damage it does."

It also is a huge grind, basically the real game doesn't start until you are hours and hours and hours in.  Wait maybe for closed beta I think.  Unless you truly LOVE the genre.  The people who play this game are in love with similar games and play it near 24/7 and you will simply be out of your league and get outclassed in every way by stronger guilds.  I'm being a bit harsh, but really the game is more grindy than it lets on at the surface."
albiononline,3c8iph,Skylent,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:17:06 2015 UTC,"The main point that you make is why... only 2-3 weeks left, and then the price drops by half for closed beta.  Get the closed beta one, since you kinda already missed out. By the time you grind up to having fun and being competitive, alpha will be over."
albiononline,3c8iph,Suuperdad,2,Thu Jul 9 17:56:26 2015 UTC,"The beginning of the game is relatively fun, it is a lot of grinding, running around, and developing your base skills before actually branching out on the destiny board (which is pretty interesting) as well as the map. Is it worth it? Yeah. I mean, maybe not now in the alpha - as others have said, everything will be wiped at some point, but it is nice to learn the basics and little tips and tricks before the launch, definitely."
albiononline,3c8iph,motivate18,2,Mon Jul 6 02:50:15 2015 UTC,"If your strapped for cash and want the best bang for your buck, I'd say no. Mostly because the alpha is ending in a few weeks.   However, with that being said, if you have extra cash and like the idea of supporting development,  go ahead!  I bought it, and have been playing a fair amount. It's grown on me but mostly because I've set my targets on pasture raising an Ox. The $100 pack comes with an Ox, while the $50 pack I bought does not. There isn't much to do besides crafting / PVP / lite-PVE.  I'm having fun. I expect by the time OBT comes around I will have gotten $50 worth of entertainment of out the purchase."

I dont know if this is a problem with animals since I am not there yet.  About the melee dmg I am not so sure.

albiononline,3c9nj3,Reaa,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:11:39 2015 UTC,"Considering everything can be lost- dropped- and traded- it would seem hard to make a solid 'pay-to-win' game especially since you need to train to be able to use higher level items. So I doubt it will be like SWTOR where you have to pay to be able to sprint, use more items, or do everything. Probably just help level up a little faster and get more silver"
albiononline,3c9nj3,MadConsular,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:36:47 2015 UTC,"Right now it's going towards free to play -- because the premium subscriptions can be bought with gold, and gold can be traded for silver, the farmable currency. However, there are a few perks which are looking to be on the P2W side such as faster regeneration of learning points. That's something I hope they will change before release."
albiononline,3c9nj3,FightasticMG,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:30:40 2015 UTC,"The stuff for gold will give players advantages, if you look at the legendary pack (mounts and a house) these things give you a pretty big advantage early game.  Literally the only thing I can think of the they could put in which would not be p2w would be skins (for players and mounts).   Its likely gold will be for skins, buffs, perks, mounts, consumables, things to speed up the grind and to replace silver in some areas; Those things give you an advantage sure free players can be competitive but it will take longer.  I would much much rather this game were pay to play than free to play to keep bots away, there is way to much incentive for players to bot safe zone silver and resources in this game."
albiononline,3c9nj3,GGtesla,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:21:10 2015 UTC,"The house adds storage and some buffs (HP buff for 1hr duration) but I haven't found it to be OP.

albiononline,3c9nj3,EdinMiami,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:13:50 2015 UTC,"The business model is not shitty, its extremely profitable. See candy crush, clash of clans etc. Its shitty for those that feel they should get 1000hrs of gameplay for no cost. Then they point at League or Dota and say those games make a ton with only cosmetics. Well, those games are the top played games in the world and big esports. Cant support a game with skins or cosmetics if its an mmo. P2W and pay for convenience are dif things. Faster silver gain, destiny progression, learning points are not p2w. They simply speed up the process that you can otherwise do the same but slower for free."
albiononline,3c9nj3,Montanx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:59:39 2015 UTC,"This is my concern as well. So far it looks awfully similar to the Trion trajectory with ArcheAge, which is a very bad thing. Everything in Alpha is great, they change up a bunch of stuff in Beta, then on release it's a ton of added content that requires real cash to purchase and they are far greater than just ""cosmetic"" to the game. I want to buy the Founder pack, but ArcheAge has me very gun-shy for this game."
albiononline,3c9nj3,Daudr,-9,Tue Jul 7 16:34:53 2015 UTC,Probably P2W considering they're milking paying for beta access as much as they can.

Depending on what direction you're going this means smelting ore you mined and making armor, hacking trees and crafting bows, or skinning animals and making leather.   Oh yeah and cotton to cloth for Mage stuff.  Building your own buildings takes a lot of resources, so get those basic skills up for more of a grasp on how things work.

albiononline,3c6var,MadConsular,2,Sun Jul 5 17:27:43 2015 UTC,The Warlock staff tree gives you some drain/dot effects. That's probably as close as you are going to get for this alpha.   Keep in mind that you will probably see these effects later in beta/full release.
albiononline,3c6var,The_Choob,2,Sun Jul 5 21:08:44 2015 UTC,I remember reading in the official forums devs saying there would eventually be pets and necro stuff but I don't have a link. It was a while ago.
albiononline,3c6var,VoodooPygmy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:51:24 2015 UTC,I don't remember off hand but there are a few weapons that have DoTs. Cursed staff and above has a life steal channeled spell. I don't believe there are any pet summoning skills.

albiononline,3c6var,blackbow,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:40:45 2015 UTC,Curse staff (warlock) has the closest skills to what you're looking for. It's got an amazing DoT on higher tiers but the early tiers are pretty lackluster and hard to solo kill with.

We will wipe servers in between each test, and possibly before release, though that is yet to be confirmed.

albiononline,3c6h04,Skidwolf,4,Sun Jul 5 07:56:33 2015 UTC,"i bought the $50 pack; my thoughts: if you die, you can loose everything, including your mount, bags, gear, sanity...even the free t2 gear you get from the pack (yea, it happened to me, i was pissed)    you can sell everything, and make a profit if you are smart. i have bought stuff on the market, and turned around and sold it for a profit a day later    encumbered is real. farming is HARD without a horse or preferably an Ox. but death means you loose it, so farm smart, and with friends if possible.    everything takes damage, and when its broke, its done. this includes your mount, so take care of your stuff. death takes durability. and everything has weight to it, including your gear and your tools (weighs FAR less when you are wearing it, but carting extra gear is almost pointless because death damages everything even in your inventory.)    that being said, this is the most engaging game i have played in a long time. so much so that ill be sad when alpha test is over, because ill want more. cannot wait for release. or at least beta where we wont be reset again."

albiononline,3c4ylm,overlon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:14:12 2015 UTC,Would love to see a re-work in the PvP zones. The zerg guilds need to be penalized for having scouts (un-flagged) players running around calling you out while groups of 4 come charging at you from all angles.  Maybe if your guild has more than 5 members in a pvp zone and one of them flags they should all get flagged automatically. Therefore showing their locations on the minimap.  Another is the 3 skull pvp area. Why do we have to flag up? If you see someone in full pvp you should absolutely be able to start attacking them red or not.

I reached a point in AO where I couldn't craft the next level gear but I could wear which forced me to go to the marketplace.    I assume it's because I did more of the fighting then the crafting.   I guess my question is, I keep hearing to specialize.  I want to be a duel dagger their/assassin.  So can I specialize in that branch and crafting leather and still be ok?"
albiononline,3c2mk4,GaryDaSnailz,2,Sat Jul 4 14:35:31 2015 UTC,"When they tell you to specialize, often times it is to specialize in crafting one or two items to maximum tier and letting your guilds take different items so they can craft the rest of your set, because Learning points have exorbitant cost at higher tiers. Keep using the daggers, find a guild, and/or get silver to buy higher tier armors.  For example, my focus right now is crafting plate helms (I will be the one in the guild to craft them to Tier 6 or 7, and leather shoes. My other guild mate will craft Leather Armors and Bows.

So guild tax would deffo be needed in order to reap rewards such as crafting stations etc from a guild island also to upgrade these.  i have 2 crafting stations lumber mill and hunters workshop and can craft the t4 longbow on it... im now letting the food run out because every day i come to play i need to feed them and its stopping me from being able to advance other areas. without a guild and the taxing system would be very hard to stay motivated to pay those fees."
albiononline,3c360q,Suuperdad,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:18:22 2015 UTC,"Food has been unreal for the first week of the alpha. Guilds can't feed and keep their territories without high tax rates.   How do you expect your guild to pay 5000 silver for a stack of corn if you don't pay taxes to your guild? Our guild goes through roughly 500,000 (FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND) silver in food each day. How can you do that without having a 90% tax rate and having dedicated silver farming going constantly. Part of being in a good guild is doing things that help the guild and not yourself. You then progress because your guild progresses. You seem to have all this backwards, and I don't blame them for getting rid of you (to be completely frank).  The only way a guild can exist without a high taxrate is if they just don't farm... which means they don't own land. So now you are stuck using buildings in Kings/Queens, and are subject to whatever the owners want to charge in taxes, and you are forced to advance at whatever rate they advance at.  I hate to say it, but your guild was right when they called you a casual. You want all the benefits of being in a guild, but you don't want to support it yourself."
albiononline,3c360q,Suuperdad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:09:29 2015 UTC,"They had a 90 percent tax without a guild plot.  They lost it in PvP and wanted to another one which then they never even got t4 buildings.  Management is hard huh?  People need to learn the process and know the sacrifice of rushing plots.  If your guild ever needs to go above 50percent, you have failed management.  Disillusion yourself."

It states that each level will get priority access before the next lower tier during the beta. Many systems have followed this model (If I recall, I believe Archeage did this during their beta, too, and still allow priority access for those who play)."

albiononline,3bzosg,LouDiamond,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:37:46 2015 UTC,"The boss is not OP. That's the guilds fault for not recognizing that a mechanic was changed in the game. The more people you throw at a boss, the stronger the AOE skill gets. I believe every person receives damage equivalent to the base damage multiplied by the number of people nearby (or in a group, i forgot) In this case, the base damage was already high, and multiplied by seventeen. Easy wipe."
albiononline,3bykiq,TrueGoldenBeard,4,Fri Jul 3 05:27:57 2015 UTC,This alpha will probably last a month. Then there will be a server wipe and beta will begin in fall/winter.
albiononline,3bykiq,Throckbandon,3,Fri Jul 3 06:43:33 2015 UTC,"The game is in alpha for a reason.  I would hold off and see how the closed beta goes.  I spent $100 to support the development of this game, but the summer alpha has me concerned about if I want to play the final product.    Bugs and balance are not really an issue-- there's loads of time to solve that.  The main issue is that this is really two games:  an incredibly grindy farmville type experience if you want to do low level crafting in safe zones, or the complete opposite experience on the PvP side.  You pretty much need to put in insane amounts of time AND be in a very large guild to have a shot at enjoying/affording PvP of any sort.  This game is farmville if you are casual to moderate in terms of your time commitment.    Even if you join a large guild, which is pretty much a requirement, the important PvP that matters is handled only by 5 people.  The rest of the guild is there to play farmville to support the territory or patrol the zone to scout and keep others out of PvP areas.    If they don't fix some of the current mechanics in-game, the early launch rush will continue to be incredibly important.  I played about 35 hours in the first 2 days of launch, and wasn't even on the bleeding edge, and I have the resources (silver) that casual players will take 350 hours to acquire over weeks and months.  The mob-silver-acquisition mechanic is broken beyond belief.    With no instancing and forced PvP to advance beyond a week's worth of casual play, there's a lot to be concerned about with this game.  Lack of instancing is super nifty, but it's in modern MMOs for a reason--  to help balance player population with available game resources.  After this alpha experience so far, I am simultaneously very excited about the game and extremely skeptical that they can get major mechanics right."
albiononline,3bykiq,CMDR_Boylston,2,Fri Jul 3 16:18:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you have to say. The biggest zerg gilds will do the best, make the most in game resources, gear up the fastest etc.  Also it looks like the land grab will be even more important than in archeage.  Small to medium guilds and semi casual players are going to have a bad time when the game releases.  I wish the grind to make higher tier gear was nerfed a little, the quantity of even tier 3 you must make to be able to craft tier 4 is a bit much and it obviously gets worse from there as resources get harder to obtain.  I'm honestly a little over the game already I love a good grind but manually farming millions of resources is going to get old pretty fast and I don't think I can be bothered trying to get in a huge guild / land grab & play the market.  Also that 100$ pack has a massive advantage early game over even the 50$ packs , mounts and housing is not easy and will put everyone else way behind the curve."
albiononline,3bykiq,GGtesla,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:05:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the detailed response! So, basically, the players who got ahead at the beginning of launch pretty much acquired the upper hand and continue to hold most of the resources and such? If I do buy it, (which will be the $50 package), I'll definitely try to put my money's worth in. Forced PvP doesnt seem like a huge disadvantage, but losing everything on death kind of makes it seem a little too risky for the reward. Another one of my concerns was solo play, since I know I'd be the only one out of my group of friends to buy into it. I wasn't sure how necessary a guild or group was but it seems to be important."
albiononline,3bykiq,GGtesla,2,Fri Jul 3 16:30:31 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't care about my gear , you need to craft huge amounts of gear per tier to be able to make the next tier anyway so loosing it is not a big deal, how much resources you need to progress gets pretty boring though.  Also players make crafting stations in all the towns, that seems an easy way to make millions of silver but to get that up and running early when the game releases you would need the 100$ pack. The 50$ pack is complete garbage I honestly don't even know what I got in it, nothing of value other than the ability to play."
albiononline,3bykiq,GodivatheGood,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:15:11 2015 UTC,"I would watch some Twitch streams or videos before buying. I played the last Alpha and am not as interested this time around.

I'm just getting my toes wet to see the changes between updates and not really investing too much time since there's a wipe coming."

albiononline,3bykiq,_manimal,0,Fri Jul 3 15:46:13 2015 UTC,I was wondering the same thing. Seems kinda meh to pay $50 then only be able to play it for a few weeks. Probably gonna wait until the beta opens.
albiononline,3bykiq,_manimal,-1,Fri Jul 3 14:59:22 2015 UTC,"What I've heard is that alpha is gonna go on for 4 weeks, then it will come down for a little and closed beta will start at some point, and come down again. Then it will go into open beta. If you do decide to get a pack could you use my referral link https://albiononline.com/?ref=RFB2PH27ZX. If you do I will give you some silver when you get in game, there is a page on your Albion account that will let me know who used my link so I will know who to send it too, I only need 1 referral to get a donkey and that's all I'm interested in."

Its hard to see paths some times in the woods and its hard to find openings to different areas, for example I was stuck in the heratic camp for a while because I couldn't find the path out. Also like you said, add the icons to the mini map. Also might I suggest a HUD overlay of the mini map like diablo 2. Bring a faded version over the screen so u can see where the paths are in real time with out having to keep popping the map.

Some of the changes that you mentioned won't be possible though because of the tablet release and as you also heard all the players from all the zones/platforms are on just one server which means all of them need to have the same thing (if this would be possible to change that will be really great and I will say that the PC/Mac/Linux versions need a different UI because of the larger screen).

albiononline,3bwge2,hejyhej,3,Thu Jul 2 20:53:20 2015 UTC,"Well gear gives you skills. So yeah, it's gear based. Or do you mean that it requires player skill to be successful in PVP? Well of course it does. But that does rely on your gear. But if you are terrible in PVP, you'll lose your gear often. It's hard to say just yet though."
albiononline,3bwge2,GoodAndy,3,Thu Jul 2 19:22:29 2015 UTC,"I meant player skill.  In UO you could out smart your opponent even if they had the absolute best everything gear wise.  I'm not seeing much room for that.  Not that I'm complaining, I'm just curious"
albiononline,3bwge2,GoodAndy,3,Thu Jul 2 19:39:24 2015 UTC,"Well I have done that before by going invisible and making my opponent think I snuck away. But yeah, early game will probably be all about the gears' stats. But I'm pretty sure there will be a plateau."
albiononline,3bwge2,Skylent,2,Thu Jul 2 19:49:44 2015 UTC,There are barely any mechanical abilities /skillshots so really it comes down to attrition.
albiononline,3bwge2,VoodooPygmy,2,Thu Jul 2 19:29:40 2015 UTC,That's the feeling I got.  Thanks for the reply.
albiononline,3bwge2,Audetastic,2,Thu Jul 2 19:37:33 2015 UTC,"FYI this is the first alpha with skillshots, the previous versions didn't have them at all. Combat has not been a huge focus so far, the devs are aware there is a lot to improve and it get's more fun each alpha IMO. Also the higher tier gear has more skills, checked out the spell on the weapons/gear at the ends of your destiny board."

albiononline,3brzko,GGtesla,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:44:56 2015 UTC,While I do agree you can't see shit in the game. I think this was made on purpose so that the terrain has a larger impact on gameplay.
albiononline,3brzko,HonestTrouth,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:04:47 2015 UTC,"I see that, but the impact should not affect basic playability like movement because that impacts whether or not the play is enjoyable or frustrating.  I do not think a small sphere of visibility around the player character would change the terrain concept.  If I were that toon, I would be able to see the surrounding area.  If they wanted to go with the terrain issue, they could play that up by fogging the edges of the screen, since you wouldn't be able to see that from the toon's p.o.v.  My main concern is basic playability, and I still think this is a pretty major issue that affects the player from the first moment they venture into trees or behind the peaks of buildings."
albiononline,3brzko,HonestTrouth,2,Thu Jul 2 17:52:01 2015 UTC,I completely agree.  Even a 2m radius of opaque visibility around the character would do wonders for gameplay.  Not seeing where mobs are or where to click the loot is sucks.

If you are expecting a 7 million person player base like Warcraft you may be disappointed but this game is cross-device/free to play and will generate a lot of attention.  • The GM's are in game asking questions and (most) players are giving meaningful feedback, as well as CM's on this sub commenting on player concerns and such."
albiononline,3brcgd,mxby7e,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:31:24 2015 UTC,There are plenty of players right now in the alpha. I doubt lack of players will be an issue. Especially once the game is officially released.  The devs are probably the most accessible devs I've ever seen on any game. They are always responding on the forums and even here.
albiononline,3brcgd,damg,2,Wed Jul 1 17:09:46 2015 UTC,I've bought the $100 founders pack.. twice. I don't regret it.
albiononline,3brcgd,skilliard4,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:34:56 2015 UTC,"No you wont regret it. Especially if you bought the Legendary. Why? The clothing you can wear ""off the bat"" is T3 and very useful, puts you ahead from the start. A fast mount. Need I say more? The Ox - Carrying all those mats you will be needing. Just look at general chat in this alpha, same questions all the time.  Where can I buy a horse/ox.  WTB Buy Horse/Ox. Normally when I buy a founder pack (I've been in numerous start up alphas/betas) its just cosmetic items.  Playing this game has not disappointed and the legendary founder pack is worth the money, it will pay for itself by release."

albiononline,3bqfpq,Chronikkles,2,Wed Jul 1 12:04:36 2015 UTC,Not just farm mats but what you don't use to grind fame if you salvage t2 or higher you get silver back as well. I got to t3 tools and warrior gear yesterday and all the swords and tools I didn't need I kept salvaging. Which made me about 2k silver and got half my mats back enough to craft t3 set of armor and tools with plenty left over.

albiononline,3bphj5,GGtesla,3,Wed Jul 1 02:41:35 2015 UTC,"bots may be able to farm tiers 1-4 well, but once they get into PVP zones, the high tier mats will be borderline unbottable because people will just kill the bots to loot their stuff."
albiononline,3bphj5,skilliard4,2,Wed Jul 1 21:42:18 2015 UTC,"1. Bots will be a huge problem when the game is fully released, just like in RuneScape. It's a F2P game, which has different methods of making money. There's 3 primary things to bot for;  -1. Tier tree. Getting higher and higher tiers without having to do the grind yourself.  -2. Getting resources for yourself, so you can start refining and crafting.  -3. Getting resources for your bank, so you can sell on AH.   2. There's probably going to be different types of bots or a more universal bot;  -1. Bots to gather resources.  -2. Bots to craft items.  -3. Bots to refine resources.  -4. Bots to snipe on AH.   3. Ways to prevent the bot;  -1. A diminishing return system for each zone. Making it so you can't farm more than a specific amount of the same resource at the same zone, pr x-hours/day/week.   -2. A report system that will allow other players to report players when they spot weird movement and slow reaction time. For example if you see the suspect player trying to gather the same node as you, many times, even though you're faster and the node only has 2/X, you'll easily figure out that this suspect player is playing without a brain. A normal player would figure out that it's pointless trying to fight for the same nodes over and over again, so they'd start gathering at a different place. This was easily spotted in RuneScape when I played back in the days.   -3. A bot-event such as the one in RuneScape. (I haven't played other games that are similar to AO then RS). If you're online for more than a specific amount hours, you'll get a random event that will require a brain to complete. This was over a time starting to become a problem in RS, when bots came with features to complete all the random events.   4. Come with more suggestions!!"
albiononline,3bphj5,InvisionGW2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:22:58 2015 UTC,"A sandbox game with a player-based economy is a prime target to be invaded by bots.  This much is certain.  How effectively will SI be at dealing with them?  I honestly don't know.  But they'd be wise to not reveal too many of their anti-bot mechanisms too soon.  ADDITIONALLY... it would probably be good to roll out such mechanisms over a period of time to frustrate the botters and stay a bit ahead of some of them from time to time.  There may be a ton of bots right from the start... there may not be.  IDK.  It is likely that there will be some and more will come if the game catches on like I imagine it might.    Why do people bot?  I think this is a question that some people don't really think about.  But the primary reason is probably 3rd party/black market currency sales.  The bots grind something out and the own then sells what they've earned.  Simple.  However, the most effective way to prevent that (or at least limit it) is by having SI sell gold directly to players through the game -- as this will reduce the need and profits for a third party market.  It won't solve the problem, but it will be a big part in the effort to contain bots.  The real trick there is to balance how much gold/silver/currency is sold so that it's not a complete and utter necessity for everyone to buy it.  This will be tricky, but it can probably be done in a fairly reasonable manner.  And this also factors in to balancing the overall game economy and the keeping in check the level of power some players and guilds might have.    And this brings me, once again, to the need for STEEP PROGRESSIVE TAXATION (using in-game currency) to keep guild sizes under control and to prevent a virtual 1% from owning 90% of the contested territory in the game.  And if it's ultimately cost prohibitive to try and buy your way into the virtual aristocracy... then there won't be a demand for massive amounts of currency sales from third party sites.  Subsequently... there won't be as many bots trying to amass vast fortunes (real or in-game) for their owners.   At the same time, the steep progressive taxation will serve as an excellent currency sink for those who do want to try and maintain the largest guilds and control the most territory."
albiononline,3bphj5,NihiloZero,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:13:24 2015 UTC,You seem to forget that the measures they already took you mentioned. Bots won't keep up with resources all depleted and slow response rate... that being said later farming areas will have pvp so bots will be useless they will die and lose literally everything.    UO had macros to kinda farm but it never worked great with ore and lumber because of encumbrances. Also in UO when you found an afk player macroin hiding or fishing you could kill him If he was outside town.
albiononline,3bphj5,jjb985,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:32:29 2015 UTC,"In UO you could make really advanced macros which included mining, melting, smithing and selling. You really only needed to log in and start the macros and wait to become rich. Encumbrance was never a problem. Getting killed was a problem but very fun if you were the guy finding the botter.."
albiononline,3bphj5,twotimes37,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:49:41 2015 UTC,"Not true at all.  I had an auto it macro to drive my boat around and mine ore for hours on end, replacing pick axes as they broke.

And otherwise you got more Marketplaces than just one, so if one places got fckd up prices (maybe a guild controlls it) you can go to another.   On your own Island you stuff wont be ""gone"", and on a public spot you just need to refill the ""food"" for your house, i dont think that your house will be gone after a few days, more like a few weeks."

albiononline,3bmpqy,xadrus1799,0,Wed Jul 1 19:42:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know enough about Albion's economy to give it a complete pass yet, but I can tell you player driven economies can be absolutely amazing if designed correctly. Eve online was done so and it is an absolute wonder to behold. I didn't start playing until 6 years after launch and was still able to carve out my own segment of the market and make mad $$. One of the key things about Eve's economy is that they built huge currency and material sinks into the game so that inflation was kept in check and many materials held a lot of value. They then added limits to processing materials and producing items (production time and slots) so that there was could be huge profit just in converting raw materials into finished goods.  Albion also has huge currency and material sinks built into the game (taxes and some items turning to junk on death) so farming currency or the right raw materials is always going to be profitable. My only concern is their methods of putting limits on processing and producing items from raw materials. I think they are going with a labor point system like Archeage, which could actually turn out to be a very good system even if Archeage did it horribly and did it just to entice you to buy more labor from the cash shop."
albiononline,3bm43l,EdinMiami,3,Tue Jun 30 09:25:48 2015 UTC,So far as I've seen there aren't really skill trees at all.  More like Unlock Paths.  You have to use warrior weapons/armor to gain access to the higher tiers of warrior weapons/armor.  And in the same way you have to craft mage weapons and armor to gain access to crafting higher tiers of mage weapons and armor.
albiononline,3bm43l,XwaywardX,2,Tue Jun 30 12:51:43 2015 UTC,"So basically, you are saying, that you can be a warrior or a mage on the same character depending on what armor/weapons you equip?"

albiononline,3bm43l,spellers,2,Tue Jun 30 14:49:38 2015 UTC,The trees don't give you actual skills as much as they allow you to unlock tiers of gear.

albiononline,3bfgdg,VoodooPygmy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:45:09 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping soon. The game does look good, however, I'm not ready to dive in with a price tag attached, especially given it's still alpha. I don't think I'm alone when I say I don't trust them (the devs), not yet."
albiononline,3bf5hn,senoramor,2,Sun Jun 28 17:50:01 2015 UTC,"To answer your main question quickly, yes AO is designed around a lot of the core values that UO was built on. It is a sandbox game where the world is there for the players to shape and it will be constantly evolving based on player driven decisions.  I recommend purchasing one of the two higher tier founder packs and getting ready for the FEELS that will hit ya when you start exploring like good ol' UO. ( Just watch out for the red zones either wise you might get a Kal Vas Flam to the face. :D )"

albiononline,3bf5hn,goonbee,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:10:26 2015 UTC,"I recommend purchasing one of the two higher tier founder packs...   I would, but I can't justify paying $50 (or $100) to play a game for a month and then have to wait a few months to play again.  I could definitely see myself paying $50 (or $100) if the alpha were  continual, much like I presume the beta will be (and which I will likely pay for).  Thanks for your response.  This game definitely has my interest piqued."
albiononline,3bf5hn,lobotech,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:18:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's no rush. To be honest, much of my old UO friends are not purchasing into the Alpha just yet for the same reasons. Alpha's are for the testers anyways and not for the actual ""gamers.""  Give the game some time to mature and once it hits a continual state of stress testing (beta), then join in on the fun. Hopefully that will be around the end of the year or Soon™.  Just an FYI, lots of old UO fans have an eye on this game. I have a group of 15 waiting to make their decision."
albiononline,3bf5hn,JimJimster,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:57:52 2015 UTC,"Can all players create all items, or must you specialize in a certain crafting skill to craft certain items? For example: say I want a new sword. Will I need to find a character with the appropriate skill to craft a sword for me, or can I just do it myself?   All players have the ability to progress up the crafting tree to make all of the gear. You can find someone to do it, or do it yourself.   Any word on a cash shop where one can buy in-game items with real-world cash?   the latest word is that they are reworking the system that was there initially   Where can I read more about the player housing option? The official website is sorely lacking in information about a lot of things, housing included.   there is an instancing system where players can buy individual islands that they have the freedom to build on. I had my own island that I farmed crops on. The guild hall system is similar but on a larger scale.   Is non-consensual pvp allowed?   The world is laid out in a grid and some of the grids are red zones, where anyone can pvp anyone else in the zone at any time."
albiononline,3bf5hn,JimJimster,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:16:19 2015 UTC,"All players have the ability to progress up the crafting tree to make all of the gear. You can find someone to do it, or do it yourself.   In UO, you could maximize only 7 skills at any one time.  If you wanted to max another skill, you had to lose your progress in one of your other skills.  If I'm understanding you correctly, one character could theoretically maximize all crafting skills at the same time and could craft any craftable item whenever he/she wants?  Is that a correct statement?"
albiononline,3bf5hn,Charlieboyah,2,Sun Jun 28 18:22:19 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, there is no limit to how many skills you can be proficient in.   If you are familiar with runescape, think of it like that. You can, in theory, become a ""maxed"" player in every discipline."
albiononline,3bg28y,McRavers,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:24:12 2015 UTC,"The Game will be the same on both, only thing that changes is how easily it will be to interact with the game.  Personally I will be using my PC, Even though there is a tablet version I doubt many people will PvP using it."
albiononline,3bg28y,Auriok,2,Sun Jun 28 22:27:33 2015 UTC,I've heard that the tablet version is best for farming and harvesting materials. I plan to use it for that purpose and my PC for pvping
albiononline,3bg28y,kyriose,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:12:27 2015 UTC,I'm positive that you're only capable of really grinding for resources and crafting with a tablet. Any combat is out of the question. Unless you wanna die horribly..
albiononline,3bg28y,Charlieboyah,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:08:48 2015 UTC,If you travel often I'd recommend the tablet. Like stated before you will be restricted on the content you'll be able to use on a tablet. Combat will be incredibly hard especially PvP.
albiononline,3bg28y,peekapew,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:13:45 2015 UTC,"Tablet isn't optimized yet FYI. I bought a nice $700 tablet that exceeded all the req specs for last alpha and couldn't run the game more than a minute, single digit FPS and crazy lag on everything. Lotta people did have success with their tablets but just thought I'd warn ya. If you are playing mainly for the group PvP tablet might be a lil rough."
albiononline,3bg28y,VoodooPygmy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:47:29 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, who pays $700 for a tablet? I can build a really decent gaming PC for less than that, and I'm not stuck playing shitty mobile clone games all day long.  I understand some people use them for work and stuff. But paying $700 for a tablet so it's a little bit better would be like paying $500 to make my poop sparkle. In the end, it's still shit."
albiononline,3bg28y,ManaPot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:32:07 2015 UTC,"It's 12.2 inches wide and has a stylus with pressure sensitivity for drawing. So it's basically a portable TV and awesome sketch pad too. I also have a lot of RSI issue from too much typing and mouseclicking so I really needed a tablet so I could do the same stuff in a different way physically. I have 0 regrets, love my tablet, and I work in fast food so the money didn't come easy. And 12.2 inch screen is a big selling point when you're 6'6 and your hands are too big to work most smaller tablets comfortably. Also got it on sale at $600."
albiononline,3bg28y,VoodooPygmy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:38:16 2015 UTC,A logical reason to get one. :)
albiononline,3bg28y,ManaPot,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:24:30 2015 UTC,"If you have the option between the two, go with the PC. There is so much more you can do on it.  This question is like asking ""I have enough money to buy either a car, or a moped. Both will get the job done, but which should I buy?""  The moped might save you gas, and a little bit of money. But you aren't going to go grocery shopping with it, or go out with friends, or pickup a hot babe. Go with the car, it's better and will allow you much more freedom."

albiononline,3bdqyq,SyrioBroel,3,Sun Jun 28 06:44:39 2015 UTC,You lose all items that you're holding so you can bank some stuff and you won't lose those. If you die in pve you have a period of time where only you can loot your dead body. If you die in pvp then your attackers will see your stuff and it will likely be gone before you get back.
albiononline,3bdqyq,deikan,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:55:27 2015 UTC,"If you drop your items in PVE, is your corpse lootable by passersby?"
albiononline,3bdqyq,Polatrite,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:06:24 2015 UTC,yes after a certain grace period. You have something like 90 seconds where only you can see your corpse. After that 90 seconds everyone can see it so they could potentially loot your stuff.
albiononline,3bdqyq,deikan,-2,Sun Jun 28 20:08:21 2015 UTC,"Eh, but doesn't this discourage folks PVPing in their best gear? The gear they spend hours getting and/or loads of money?   Assuming it's not easy to get back it seems kinda...extreme"

albiononline,3bdqyq,Gajet,2,Sun Jun 28 07:55:15 2015 UTC,"Gear isn't prohibitively hard to get, you're likely to stick spares in your bank. Also it's crafted stuff so it's not like you're wearing rare drops from some raid mob. Anything you loose is easily recrafted by a guild mate or bought off the market. Or make it yourself. Oh and don't forget if you kill someone else, you get their gear."
albiononline,3bdqyq,SaltTM,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:32:13 2015 UTC,"It encourages people to roll the dice, try to out outplay someone/group of guys w/ decent gear w/ gear of lesser value than the guys you're fighting and get bank.  I'm personally going full craft mode in this game because this seems like the game where crafting is going to be enjoyable where remaking certain loot for those types of runs worth the value."
albiononline,3bdqyq,TheBG,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:29:00 2015 UTC,"People who play games like this tend to PvP in gear they can afford to lose, saving the best gear for guild vs guild wars. As you progress the gear you can afford to lose becomes higher and higher tier."

albiononline,3bazyj,annoyingtelemarketer,2,Sat Jun 27 16:07:58 2015 UTC,"Ive played runescape since classic, hundreds of hours played. Albion is the game I spent the last few years looking for. The stats and equipment is similar in that you hybrid and dont have to specialize.  Pvp is full loot, cant get better then that.   Main difference is not as much of a focus on quests to progress in the game. The players are more mature and less trying to pull a fast one on you.   Crafting is very enjoyable for me oh and whats that no mother fuckin bots. The devs seem to be way less Terrible at their updates, with an actual focus on player driven economy and real ""gold"" sinks. They even stopped the p2win ideology by making it pay to upgrade your account with gold.this should stop goldfarming I hope  I hope you get to check out this alpha next week, im incredibly excited for it. If you played runescape to skill and pvp and not to quest then you will like this. They are adding quests this alpha so we shall see  Its much more guild focused. Rs you can get away being a solo player, not so much here. Im in the Black Cocks guild if you are a badass pker , check us out"
albiononline,3bazyj,annoyingtelemarketer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:04:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, i was a classic player myself. Pking was what i've been missing the most about mmos. And even the skilling was so much better then more recent mmos. I'll definaltey be having a go at this game. I might even try and get the misses in on it. Thank you again."
albiononline,3bazyj,crumbstain,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:20:11 2015 UTC,"Hello!  I too came to this game because of it being similar to Runescape for me. I've played two tests now, and I will say it feels very similar to pre-2007scape. This game has been great, and I love the free-market which it creates.

albiononline,3b56s6,Montanx,3,Fri Jun 26 01:44:17 2015 UTC,"You can definitely do this. The only concern is that your progress will be dependant on the progress of pure crafters outside of the big guilds. Most big guilds won't be selling their best stuff, they usually sell 1 tier behind their best stuff.  So at best you could be 1 tier behind big guilds. That's still pretty good for a solo player though, and possibly your best option.  If you want to go the crafting route, you should pick out one set and stick to it. The more you diversify (this alpha especially) the slower your overall progress will be."
albiononline,3b56s6,Suuperdad,2,Fri Jun 26 14:13:00 2015 UTC,"You would certainly be able to rise the ranks of gear unlocking faster if you only focused on combat and not worrying about crafting along the way. It takes a decent amount of gathering and crafting along the way to maintain the crafting abilities for your current tier of gear.   It's fairly easy to buy gear from an auction house if you can manage to be near a busy one. I would say after T2 gear, the crafting really gets time consuming. Get yourself set up in a bigger city with a lot of auction house activity and you can buy from there no problem"
albiononline,3b56s6,JimJimster,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:01:42 2015 UTC,"It's a player driven economy.  Buy gear from players to kill mobs to get silver, you don't buy from NPC vendors you buy from a player driven marketplace."

albiononline,3as6vo,Flufferpope,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:49:35 2015 UTC,"1a. Yes, it is. 1b. There are many different shared and non-shared banks.   2a. and 2b. Gigantic megaserver system.  3a. When contesting a territory, you select one of four time slots. 3b. Some areas are for building towns, others are special zones which might contain a high amount of resources, dungeons, special mobs, farmlands, etc. 3c. You need to ""feed"" zones  and buildings resources to upkeep them. 3d. GvG is instances, though most PvP action will probably be taking place in the open world.  Bonus. If you like a PvP game that also lets you farm, gather, craft, and other things in the downtime, but which has many different mechanics in place in order to limit pve grind in favor of spending more time adventuring or fighting, then this is your game. If you have fond memories of games like Ultima Online, Dark Age of Camelot, Diablo, Tibia, or Settlers of Catan, then this is your game."
albiononline,3as6vo,cowfishduckbear,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:49:38 2015 UTC,"1) Yes, chests in cities are free. You can build additional chests in personal houses, either on plots of land you own, or in your personal island.  2) Land is plentiful, this hasn't been a problem most alphas... now being able to afford it on the otherhand.... That being said, you can make a personal island where only you can go to (instanced) - unless you give permissions to others.  3) People can claim guild plots. Once claimed they need to feed it. This is no easy task. Once claimed, other guilds can war it (5v5's). You pay silver to war a land. Win and you weaken it. Weaken it enough and you take it over.  Claiming it allows you to build buildings on it, which are used to craft stuff. Alternatively you can build buildings in cities. Plots in cities cost silver/gold upkeep. Guild plots cost food upkeep.  GvG is not instanced, but everyone inside the zone gets kicked out of the zone. They can still look inside from the outside and watch the fight if they come close to the edges.  Anything else you should know? What are you waiting for, go get a founder pack. It's amazing."
albiononline,3as6vo,Suuperdad,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:42:12 2015 UTC,Sorry to hijack the thread but I'll go ahead and ask a question.  Do we know yet how pve loot will work? I know the loot is more resources and not as much epic gear dropping right? So you won't get a legendary sword drop off a boss or mob encounter right? But you may get rare crafting mats? So how is it when the boss pops? Instanced for each person? Free for all? Ninja looting?
albiononline,3as6vo,Montanx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:08:06 2015 UTC,"Bosses drop Armour and weapons also, at least lasts Alpha they did. I think it was whichever group did last hit can loot the boss. Its free for all looting, usually handled by the guild you're grouped with. I've never had an issue with it, sometimes its whoever grabs first, othertimes split amonst everyone"
albiononline,3as6vo,annoyingtelemarketer,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:52:49 2015 UTC,Well in that case either get a good guild or just pug and spec for ninja looting. If something desireable ever drops u best believe that split it up mentality goes out the window.

When that alpha ends, you won't get to play until the next test--which won't happen for a few months, more than likely and it might be called a beta test.  When the game launches, it will be free-to-play which means you won't need to spend any money to play. You can spend money for extra perks, like extra silver drop from monsters."

I am not up to play a new MMO as I don't got the time to sink into it before alpha starts. But I did try out Tree of Life and I actually enjoyed it a lot. But you kinda need a bigger guild to survive the nights and long work days where you can't be online.  I enjoy playing Heroes of the Storm with friends and Heartstone solo atm - and thats about it for now.

I'm currently playing it with a friend and its the most fun in any mmo we had yet since even tho you have that p2w issue (sadly can't deny that) you can still do so much more than in most other games.  I had to say this since it makes me kinda sad that whenever someone suggests ArcheAge he gets downvoted and some people appear who make it seem like AA is unplayable because of p2w.

albiononline,39ispa,RipDAOCMordred,4,Fri Jun 12 00:34:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you think you need to play a lot to replace armor you lose. The more time you play, the more time you spend exposing yourself to death. All that matters is flow in vs flow out... i.e. how often you die per hour, and how much materials you pull in per hour to replace your lost gear. The safer you play, while maximizing your resource pull-in, is how you optimize this.  I.e. if you die 10 times an hour, it doesn't matter if you play 10 hours a day, you die 100x. If you die 1 time every 20 hours of playtime, it won't matter if you only play 30 mins a day, you'll be fine.   Regarding the depth of PvP skill, the previous alphas combat was very shallow. I think making this game cross-platform is a big mistake they are making, because the combat has to get dumbed down. That being said, I think this is on their radar and they are working towards making it better every alpha. From what I read on forums (their roadmap, etc), the combat should get big improvements this alpha.   It's still in alpha, so I'm not going to judge. The game is perfect for me, it's everything I want in a game. I just hope it keeps improving. The team working on the game seem pretty good."
albiononline,39ispa,Suuperdad,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:27:15 2015 UTC,I think making it cross platform is great. Just think of some isometric table top like games that were on the PC like Darkages. The amount of community in a MEGA server will be amazing. Community is everything for MMO's and Im glad that the PC master race can whip up on some Mac books and Andriod devices. Kappa
albiononline,39ispa,Freekillcoupon,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:39:10 2015 UTC,"It isn't without it's benefits, that's for sure. I just don't like the hit that the combat system has to take to get it there. Combat has to be simple, and that turns the game into more of a gearcheck. There's not as much of the ability to outmaneuvre a weaker player."
albiononline,39ispa,Suuperdad,3,Wed Jun 24 12:57:53 2015 UTC,"Join a guild, in some of the ones I tried the guild would glady suit you up with decent gear if you were going out PvPing with them. Also once you find a gear level you use a lot for whatever reason (easy for you to farm, guild has a ton of that tier, etc.) you're skill with those weapons will start to go up and as you increase in mastery with that tier of gear (think it's called mastery) you will get better at using them and it will help close the gear gap slightly.  I didn't play the winter alpha so it's been a while, don't remember all the skills and I'm sure they added and will add more, but I definitely remember there being builds much better at running away than other builds. On top of the multiple speed boosts from shoes things like shields and cleanses are useful.   2/3/4 Don't judge the combat yet IMO, it's still alpha, plenty of time to focus on making the combat more fun and stratgic. This was just posted a week ago https://forum.albiononline.com/index.php/Thread/11149-The-news-room-Index-of-news-posts/?postID=119614#post119614 all about trying to get skillshots into the game and plenty of forum talk about it here https://forum.albiononline.com/index.php/Thread/11156-Combat-Talk-Skill-Shots-Community-Discussion-Thread/?pageNo=1 ."
albiononline,39ispa,VoodooPygmy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:52:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you for info!  I solo a lot and enjoy the lone wolf killing and 1vx mentality, so I'd feel like a leech with a guild footing a bill. The problem with solo is you die a decent amount by being ran over by groups, it's just an inevitability you have to accept, so I hope I can overcome the regearing for another run issue in this game somehow.."
albiononline,39ispa,VoodooPygmy,6,Fri Jun 12 02:56:45 2015 UTC,"I solo a ton too. Using gear you can afford to lose, making frequent trips back, and learning the maps and normal traffic in an area helps a lot. The world is hopefully going to be large enough that you'll be able to find some farming spots that aren't getting hit by zerg trains constantly. Plus next alpha they are trying a new feature where any group larger than 5 shows up on the mini-map so you can see zergs coming. Also as a soloer I ended up meeting quite a few other soloers in my alliance that would do the same activities I would and we'd frequently run into each other and team up, even having 1 friend around greatly increases your chance of escape, especially if you trust each other and can keep all the loot on 1 of you and let the other run some CC options to help the loot holder escape."
albiononline,39a4rt,AOSzymon,3,Wed Jun 10 10:19:00 2015 UTC,My favorite looking place in the game! The PvP that erupts in there is always a lot of fun as well :D

albiononline,39a4rt,goonbee,3,Wed Jun 10 21:58:58 2015 UTC,The resources in the hellgates can only be obtained there and are needed to craft some very powerful weapons.
albiononline,39a4rt,AO_Bercilak,-1,Thu Jun 11 06:20:00 2015 UTC,There should be like 10 people hell gates and on to have larger battles and better loot.
albiononline,39a4rt,MadAlcamist,4,Wed Jun 10 13:31:10 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason of Hellgates is to give smaller groups a reason to not zerg up (5man caps hopefully means 5man roaming pvp groups also looking for hellgates, pvping with other smaller groups also lookin for em) so making them hold larger numbers would kinda defeat that part of the purpose. Plus there's always the argument that the more instanced PvP going on, the less world PvP going on which is a big reason there's no battlegrounds in this game I think. There's still plenty of PvPing to do for the bigger groups 8-P."
albiononline,39a4rt,VoodooPygmy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:24:24 2015 UTC,I'm not saying there should not be 5 mans but there should be bigger ones. Regardless of the hell gates there will be zergs no doubt about it. Zerging will continue just now there will be in fighting in that zerg for the hell gates.

albiononline,397dqc,julian0024,4,Tue Jun 9 20:03:41 2015 UTC,"I haven't played it yet myself, but plan on it for the summer alpha.  I have to admit I have drunk the koolaide one too many times when it comes to paying for early access games. Too many times I've either gotten burnt out by bugs or just didn't like the game at all and wasted $50 just because I was too impatient to wait for open beta.  The rule I've made for myself now is that I have to really want to support the developers before I fork over any money. I love sandbox games and want companies to make a whole lot more of them, and one way to do that is to support the smaller companies who are giving it their all.  I don't know if Albion is going to be a game I'll really love, but I feel good about supporting the developers because they have some great ideas and I want to help them out."
albiononline,397dqc,Throckbandon,3,Wed Jun 10 03:03:22 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of having more sandboxes. I ended up buying the game, but it's apparently not going into summer alpha for the foreseeable future."

albiononline,397dqc,hyrenfreak,2,Wed Jun 10 09:01:05 2015 UTC,"i was announced for the end of june already, i think the 29th or 30th"
albiononline,397dqc,VoodooPygmy,3,Wed Jun 10 13:19:50 2015 UTC,"I loved the alpha that I played, PvP was a ton of fun with friends and the economy was the best part, having to move your goods around on an ox with your buddies or hired help defending you is a big adrenaline rush for m. It will be F2P when it comes out so trying it out should be an easy choice, nothing to lose.   I don't regret paying for early access myself but I recommend you do enough research to be sure this is the game for you before throwing down too much money, I've been burned enough times on other early access games."
albiononline,397dqc,Gankstar,-6,Wed Jun 10 03:18:12 2015 UTC,$50 for early access to a >free< game should tell you something about it.

albiononline,397dqc,Redbeardt,6,Wed Jun 10 11:34:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Like the devs are not beholden to a huge publisher forcing idiotic game design changes, and so have less financial backing.

albiononline,38lnu0,Velleas,-1,Fri Jun 5 04:00:31 2015 UTC,1 question:  Why should only 5 people be allowed to consumer the GVG content at a time from any 1 guild?
albiononline,38lnu0,Cramit845,4,Fri Jun 5 15:41:16 2015 UTC,"they can't you have to think of the many regions the guild can fight. thats where numbers come in, it would be 5 for every region. its more of a show of skill than numbers. Its fair for every party not just the zerg guilds. there will still be upsides for numbers like I've said Resources more money for more equipment and the ability to hold more land because you have more dedicated players."
albiononline,38lnu0,Velleas,5,Fri Jun 5 21:52:31 2015 UTC,So you want YOUR guild to run everything >:(
albiononline,38lnu0,Thypher,2,Fri Jun 5 04:09:09 2015 UTC,I cannot see a group of 5 grinders defending more than 1 area of land... If you have 20 then you just take 4 areas off them and they defend the 5th successfully. I think its cool how they moved the logistics of large guilds into a more 'map orientated' tactic rather than the standard combat style.

albiononline,386lar,Fawa,6,Tue Jun 2 14:34:21 2015 UTC,"'Douchey' is paying for the production of Albion Online right now. If the 30$ pack could get you into the summer alpha, then SI would've raised a significant amount less in start-up capital than they do at the moment.  If all you care about is playing then you really should wait til open beta. You're doing it for all the wrong reasons."
albiononline,386lar,Fawa,-7,Tue Jun 2 14:57:16 2015 UTC,"I mean the summer alpha is right before the closed beta which allows everybody in, so why not let everybody in on the summer alpha?

albiononline,386lar,AOSzymon,5,Tue Jun 2 15:31:37 2015 UTC,"It's to incentivise people to pay a higher premium- more capital now, means better product later.  It's just a tactic, one that I don't have any problem with."
albiononline,386lar,Describe,5,Tue Jun 2 15:48:15 2015 UTC,"The unfortunate thing is that it just comes down to numbers - we're an independent team, and a small one at that, and need support from our community to keep the game up to our own (pretty high) standards; and the standards of the players! The alpha/beta divide is obviously quite a distinct one, which is why we made the decision to cut the packs off there.

People actually interacted outside of a instanced guild setting.  PKing someone in the world actually mattered. A lot of alliances, friendships and shit talking where had. BoP and BoE equipment killed the risk/reward of mmorpgs for me."

I can still recall roughly 30 players' names from last alpha that i recognized as a strong player in one way or another. Understand that this is no easy task at all, a large number of people can/will sink ~10 hours a day. However, if you have the time to spend, you will have a blast being known server wide. Its a great feeling looking at the leader boards and seeing your name/your guild's name up at top 3. Hope this helps, I'll be looking forward to seeing you in the upcoming alpha! Happy hunting!"

albiononline,36paep,VoodooPygmy,3,Thu May 21 02:07:56 2015 UTC,The good thing about this concept is that it does not take people out of the open world. So it should encourage more groups to roam pvp zones instead of less groups like you would have with a normal match making system.

albiononline,36paep,somfan,1 point,Thu May 21 22:09:01 2015 UTC,"I really like this idea. One thing I thought of though was what's to stop a guild from zerging to the demon and killing it and then selecting their best 5 to enter? Meaning by zerging the demon they not only claim it, but kill it easily. Just something that popped in my head while I was reading."
albiononline,36paep,BjjGearJunkie,2,Thu May 21 12:10:01 2015 UTC,Zerging in PvE in general   Since it is an Open World game we have implemented an enrage buff. When you attack a monster with more people than expected the monster will get stronger and at one point enrage being impossible to kill and wipe your group.     Dont forget there are spawning several of these demons in the world and yes if you kill him with a larger group and than send your best players in it is ofc possible but very ineffective since it also does not guarantee you that you get the loot inside since another group might go into the same Hellgate and inside it is 5vs5.      So instead you could better split up your guild to rather get into several Hellgates. The Gatekeepers always spawn in waves at the same time!
albiononline,36paep,AO_Bercilak,3,Thu May 21 14:35:01 2015 UTC,Nice that enrage buff sounds like a good idea. Thanks for the reply.
albiononline,36paep,BjjGearJunkie,1 point,Thu May 21 16:45:15 2015 UTC,"This feature looks like it has some pretty good potential.    However, the main feature I'd like to see implemented is progressive taxation (using in-game currency) for adding members to guilds and acquiring/holding land.  Without this, I feel that the creation of an in-game oligarchy/old boy's club will like be established and quickly be untouchable as they snowball their wealth, power, and influence over the world of Albion Online."

The person who knocked you out will not be able to loot your gear, but will get a silver reward for the win"
albiononline,36ccrr,hejyhej,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:00:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this, though it is unsettling. I understand I am not in a place to complain, as this is alpha and that is a trial, but it is the antithesis of why I bought the game.  I have seen a previous f2p PVP game, Conquer Online, progressively remove PVP so majority of zones became safe zones and that even mass murderers did not drop their equipped gears. I hope the game does not change its direction away from sandbox pvp and onto structured battles.  As is the time to toggle pvp is terribly long (last I played), and guards were added to entrances to prevent certain attacks. I don't think making a previously viable gamestyle impossible is an appropriate sacrifice, another solution would be to let players craft the armors appropriate to those zones easier to craft. This way the punishment is negated but a gamestyle remains viable."

The only thing that is needed is a will to learn, I know for example in EVE it is extremely easy for a new player to get into PVP and find friends to help him out getting started and I am sure it will be the same here as soon as the game has matured a bit (might even work out fine from day 1).  If nothing else pops up feel free to write me a PM and you can run with my guys in the beta (They won't be playing in the alpha)."

Because this is everything im looking for minus the pvp :P  There is no game out there exactly like this but pve only ......it sucks  or am i just assuming its alot more then it actually is cause from what im hearing i could play and never pve/pvp and play as a crafter / gatherer for a guild is that wrong?    going to stick with this game even though i dislike pvp because no other mmos exist that are what albion online promises :/
albiononline,36byzk,AO_Bercilak,1 point,Mon May 18 04:07:10 2015 UTC,We are constantly adding things to do despite PvP.    Previously we added farming and with the coming update we have missions as well which might keep you occupied.  A small hint: If you play Albion Online I highly recommend to pick a guild to play with since it increases fun factor by 10 ;). Take a lookt at the guild recruitment forum https://forum.albiononline.com/index.php/Board/11-Guild-Recruitment/

albiononline,36byzk,jhorphear,1 point,Tue May 19 23:27:35 2015 UTC,I am not too familiar with the farming but it does look interesting.   Here is some info and a video showcasing a bit of farming   https://albiononline.com/farming-dev-blog/  What I said before still stands true it is a full loot open PvP game but there is crafting and everyone needs crafted items. You could in theory just be a crafter for your guild and keep them armed.   You would just have to find a guild to pump you mats from PvP areas.   There will be people that have no desire to craft and you could be the kind of person to help them.   There are monsters and dungeons but the higher tier stuff is in PvP zones.   It is a great game so far and there is a lot to do in it so I would definitely check it out.

albiononline,36byzk,onemeangreenbean,1 point,Mon May 18 04:12:23 2015 UTC,Doesn't look like it is  the crafting looks meh....but if i got in a guild on albion couldn't you go in groups to make dying less of a risk?  Also with albion do you think the skills will be so good that i could spend a few hours doing non-combat stuff or not?
albiononline,36byzk,onemeangreenbean,2,Mon May 18 04:14:52 2015 UTC,The crafting in UO is actually really good.  As far as the crafting in Albion if you group up the odds of dying go down... unless you run into a bigger group.   They also reworked the crafting since last alpha so I have no idea if you can just craft for you play time.
albiononline,36byzk,DynamicStatic,1 point,Mon May 18 04:17:48 2015 UTC,From what i saw in UO crafting from my short looks there wasn't much customization it looked static. <- Just looked into it more it is indepth not as much as i would like but it is.  I guess im ok with pvp i just hate it cause i always die and never win :/ that's my problem with pvp and why i never play games with pvp or mobas etc.  If there is a way i can start winning in pvp then sure i would love this game.
albiononline,36byzk,ensvne,0,Mon May 18 04:21:38 2015 UTC,"You could take an economic approach to the game.  There are a few players that do this already and seem to avoid PvP whenever possible.  That being said, if you want to experience anything past the very beginning stages of the game / town life you will need to venture into open PvP zones.  If you watch some of the videos from the large successful guilds in previous AO alphas, you will see that when a profitable PvP opportunity arises (castle siege, large enemy dungeon group, enemy clans raiding territory, ect.), they can gather dozens of players that are organized and ready to fight in 15 minutes or less.  With that capability, it would be nearly impossible to assemble a  strong enough group of non-PvP players to make traveling safe.  People that want to get into the mid-high tier territories without PvP tend to do so by sneaking around very carefully."
albiononline,36byzk,Fitzerrick,1 point,Wed May 20 09:54:36 2015 UTC,So i guess ill need to sneak with pve players who are also sneaking i guess or hire some pvp players to protect me??
albiononline,36byzk,Redbeardt,1 point,Wed May 20 10:42:49 2015 UTC,"Sneaking works best with fewer numbers, but this is all based I alpha testing experience.  The bloodlust may not be as extreme when the game launches... Right now everyone has to fit 6 months of pvp into a couple weeks.    It's hard to predict what the social dynamics will be like when things have time to settle and the countdown to server shutdown doesn't start the minute the servers go live.    I don't expect conditions to be forgiving at launch, but some sort of common courtesy is sure to develop over time.  If you play during an alpha/beta and don't want to pvp... Remember that the horse 360 is the universal signal for 'greetings, I come in peace' when roaming in Albion."
albiononline,367azw,euroguy,3,Sat May 16 21:25:27 2015 UTC,"I am sorry unfortunately never played Tibia, so cant tell you for sure.

If the concern is lack of skillshots, then you can relax because skills are already being reworked, and this has always been stated by the developers as being part of the development plan. In fact, I have already personally seen several nice changes to skills that you will be able to appreciate once the summer alpha begins. I would love to be more specific, but I am not allowed to, though I assure you that this is something that they have said is very important to them as well, so it will continue to be worked on."

Albion Online is NOT under a NDA and you can freely speak about everything, also there is nothing you can teach me about albion online, ive played the last 3 playtests and know for a fact that they are gonna implement skill shots, like ground AOE's that scale with how many targets it hits to stop the mindless zerging... What i was speaking about is the current state of the game, its no different than tab targeting MMO's right now. except the way you move."

There is no ""current state of the game"" because there aren't any servers running and the game hasn't begun yet. You are complaining about a game in alpha when you know that the feature you are specifically complaining about is already being worked on at this very moment. Like, they are literally addressing your complaint in their current day-to-day work."

albiononline,35dnac,Kaizermos,2,Sat May 9 08:36:11 2015 UTC,"Wildstar had an ongoing beta and changed it to weekend events  one of them made a long post about why they decided to do that, which you cant transfer exactly to albion but it gives you some insight   We know how much you guys want to play and help test, and we’re sorry we can’t give you any additional time to do so before launch. The reasons why are due to the four primary parties this decision had ramifications for:  The executives – These guys hold the money and have the most experience knowing what’s healthiest for a game’s success. The Sales/Marketing teams – These guys’ core purpose is to make sure the sales of our game are as high as possible. This is crucial because without sales… we as a company can no longer exist and you guys don’t get to play WildStar. The Live and Operations teams – These guys need to make sure the servers are launch-ready. The Dev team – These guys want to get as much feedback as possible before launch. All four sat down and met and debated the possible programs we could go with for weeks… I was in some of those meetings, people like Cougar were in other meetings. In the end, we knew we’d have to come to a compromise between all parties, because any single path we took would likely screw up another team’s plans and needs. The needs everyone had were pretty straightforward, though conflicting:  Dev’s priority was ensuring we still got high-level testing, since that’s the content that’s had the least amount of exposure in beta so far. Sales and Marketing didn’t want too many people playing the game before launch so that we could make sure people weren’t getting a “free ride” through the game’s content and then canceling their pre-orders. Execs didn’t want players burning out through beta and thus being uninterested in playing post-launch.  Burnout generally happens because people don’t want to commit to characters that are going to get wiped and don’t generally “play” the exact way they’d play their actual characters. Burnout’s extremely common and quantifiable… it’s usually about 4 weeks in MMO betas and that’s been holding true for WildStar as well, so the higher-ups want to make sure we don’t lose players before they even get a chance to play the “final” game. Live and Operations were focused on continuing to work on their processes and procedures, and need all types of testing and deployments to occur. The more we go up and down, the more problems we resolve, the more stability we achieve, the more prepared the Live and Operations Teams becomes for launch. So the compromise you see today is what we ended up with:  Beta goes from 24/6 to weekend testing to support Sales’ needs. Pre-order players are limited to level 17 to support the Exec’s needs. Current beta testers will be allowed to play beyond level 17 if they pre-order, or level 32+ players can continue playing without a pre-order, in order to facilitate high-level testing, to support Dev’s needs. Live gets tons of people playing in a condensed amount of time to drive server concurrency up and push the servers to their limits.  As the saying goes, you only have a good compromise if no one leaves the table satisfied. I’ll admit we’re not completely happy with how this program ended up, but it’s the best we could make out of the restrictions we were given.  This post is now way too long, so I’m just going to wrap up by saying: The most important thing you can do to help WildStar at the moment is help us get the word out. Tell your friends, tell your family, tell anyone who will listen about us. We’re a studio that’s just barely on the radar of the non-enthusiast gamers, and we’re up against the titans of industry this year. If you really believe in the product and the direction we’re taking it, help us get this game out the door and be a massive success so we can do everything we’ve ever dreamed of with it."
albiononline,35dnac,Reaa,1 point,Sat May 9 11:36:58 2015 UTC,"I see what you were getting at, but Carbine were in a very different situation.    A. Sandbox doesn't have faceless billion dollar Korean parent companies hanging over there head.  B. Wildstar is Box+Sub PvE Themepark and Albion is a F2P PvP based sandbox.  Most of what they mention in that post eg. Burnout, testing endgame, losing players (both games need players, but Wildstars was a strict $15 a month loss) virtually don't apply to Albion or sandboxes in general.  It's why games like H1Z1, Rust, DayZ, Starbound etc are all up the top most played games on steam month after month, despite some of them cough DayZ cough being so early in development to not have crucial features (in this case, functioning Zombies) working.  C.  A decent portion of that post was the dev's saying it should have stayed as ongoing testing, but the ""big wigs"" wanted it changed lol    I’ll admit we’re not completely happy with how this program ended up, but it’s the best we could make out of the restrictions we were given.   Says it all right there if you ask me.  D.  Look how well launching a non-complete (if you played at launch I'm sure you would agree it was barely past Beta) or thoroughly tested game went for Wildstar :(   Thanks for the contribution to the discussion though :D"
albiononline,35dnac,no1nose,2,Sat May 9 12:30:05 2015 UTC,I wish we could log in and 'test' anytime we want. I just want to play.
albiononline,35dnac,AO_Bercilak,4,Sun May 10 05:30:46 2015 UTC,Hi in our forum we had this question already several times. The answer why we are not doing it is very easy:   As of today we are still making major changes to the core gameplay. We just recently added Missions and Hellgates (a very interesting new feature) So we need all resources to focus on these changes A test server running 24/7 would almost half our resources!!!   Even if everything goes fine a server always requires maintenance and even more important things will break and they need to be fixed because at the moment people pay for playing they have high expectations!    Having a test server running is like having the game life more or less But we are not yet finished (amlost there) with the core gameplay features that is why we need all resources on the development Also keep in mind that we are a smaller team than your general MMO developer But even more important: The test we are doing right now give us way more information than we would get from a 24/7 environment. (I know what I am talking about) Because these tests are very focused and the whole team is focussing on it. During our Alpha tests almost every person in the office is watching streams from users to see what problems they are facing      VERY IMPORTANT: I am not saying this or that is better. I am just saying that right now for us this is the best mode and that in maybe 5 months we can than finally switch to a ongoing 24/7 closed beta to work on the details (for which a 24/7 test is better)     Other Sidenote As you wrote we would earn significantly more money if we would have the servers up 24/7. So why should I as the CEO of the company than decide not to earn more? - Because I believe it is the best for the game in the long run not to do 24/7 servers right now!      Sidenote: Dont worry the sales of the Founders packs are high enough to guarantee you the game will be released for sure!

albiononline,355ep7,Kinand,3,Thu May 7 06:43:37 2015 UTC,"Hi Kinand,  Economy is one of the most important topics for us. A lot of our mechanics are very close to EVE.      But what makes a good player driven economy?:     Resources are limited (you can not harvest unlimited amount of any resources; especially important for a Free2Play game) unsymmetrical distribution of said resources (So in the north part of the world you find more Black-Wood or it is the only place where you get Black Wood) Ideally you also have local markets You have a good amount of resource sinks to avoid inflation The best weapons can only be created via crafting You give players enough tools to specialise in crafting (and ideally trading and transportation) so that it can be seen like a real profession   Actually all of these points are true for Albion Online. Albion online was build from the start with a good economy in mind.      Kind regards, Stefan  PS.: We will also have transport missions in many different variations, but they are not important for a good player driven economy."
albiononline,355ep7,AO_Bercilak,2,Fri May 8 07:47:23 2015 UTC,"You have a good amount of resource sinks to avoid inflation   this is great. i know construction and crafting can take a high amount of resources, but i'm curious if there are plans for rares? not in terms of equipment, but housing/city items and purely cosmetic player modifications. this is pretty much coming directly from my time spent in ultima online, where people will go HUGE lengths in cosmetics to make their player/housing unique and to their own taste. i would even call this the motivation for many players- grow their wealth as a player/guild, and grow their notoriety not just through leaderboards, but also visually.   some spawns in UO have like a 0.001% chance of dropping a cosmetic that's unavailable from the cash store. it could make competition for certain spawns even more active, because even if a player/guild no longer needs the resources of a particular area/creature much, they might have a big desire for a particular cosmetic chance a certain mob might drop. a small guild can might want to get all their members a blood red tabard that only drops from one creature with a 1% chance, or a big guild trading huge amounts of silver to a single lucky player that has a housing/town item they want that came from a 0.001% chance drop.  the cosmetics you can wear were the only items that were not lootable, after a player spends additional resources (this could include cash shop) to bind that cosmetic to their player. this gives players more commitment to their cosmetic, assuring there is still real money flow to the business, even though these items were not purchased from the cash shop. more specifically how it was done, the cash shop on my server sold ""bless deeds"" that bound the cosmetic to the player, which was only available through the cash shop. players could choose to spend their real money to bless their item, or buy a bless deed from another player at the economy's current price of conversion between real money and game money off the market."
albiononline,355ep7,baddie_,4,Tue May 12 00:34:23 2015 UTC,"WoW and AA do not have a player driven economy. In Albion the items are created by materials gathered by players and that the player have to craft by hand (in wow you get a lot of shit through other methods mainly). They can then (in Albion) be put onto the marketplace which is local (meaning you can't have someone produce something in one corner of the map and you can buy it on the other side of it through some auction like in the majority of MMOs).  Also since items actually break (I mean like they become junk), you have to recraft or rebuy them again which also means that there is always a demand for new items and materials on the market. Trading items and transporting over the map (and not to NPCs like in AA) is possible ways to make money as prices are different in different regions and so on."
albiononline,355ep7,DynamicStatic,2,Thu May 7 09:27:23 2015 UTC,"mobs do drop armor/weapons etc, but its not on the level where you can get your equip from, its more like an extra income and they want to reduce it even further for the next alpha  what should be mentioned is that you can only craft stuff till t3 at npc shops in 2 locations without any quicktravelling feature to get there, every crafting station afterwards, up to t8, must be build and maintained by players  items break pretty often(-50% dura on death and some when you use it), so repairing/recrafting is a common thing  quicktravelling via boats costs alot of money depending on your load, which makes it basicly unuseable for trading purpose, which may lead to traderuns, but not really through pvp zones  there are dungeons for playergroups, but without a fixed lootable and not instanced. there are simply elite mobs with higher chance for random loot and higher tiers are in pvp zones only  to sum up the player eco:  you can find random armor/weapons/kid mounts/ingredients, potions,some seeds, bags,some food  you have to craft:  most armor/weapons, raise mounts from kids, grow seeds to make them into food, raise animals and butcher them for food, buildings"
albiononline,355ep7,Reaa,0,Thu May 7 14:21:42 2015 UTC,"When I said I'd played WoW for a long time I was just establishing that I had some MMO experience, certainly not as much as other people but experience nonetheless. WoWs 'economy' consists of wasting hours to get things that then sell in two minutes for a set price and the most it gets to 'player driven' is that fact that you can set your own price on the AH and undercut other players prices by 0.1%. AA was as I said, a good game and besides from your opinion I believe it DID have a player driven economy, to the highest point an MMO at this time can. Albion online looks really promising to me and I can't wait until it comes out because I'll definitely be buying/playing it. I don't understand what you mean when you said >Trading items and transporting over the map (and not to NPCs like in AA) is possible ways to make money as prices are different in different regions and so on. Though so far from what I've heard about this game it sounds really, really good. The only thing that would inhibit me from getting this game would be the top-down view instead of the traditional MMO view which I've become accustomed to. Thanks for your reply though, it was helpful."
albiononline,355ep7,DynamicStatic,2,Fri May 8 05:06:07 2015 UTC,"I think if you believe that AA has a player driven economy 'to the highest point an MMO at this time can' you need to widen your views. I recommend that you get a EVE trial account and try it out for two weeks, try playing the market and understanding crafting and how it all comes together. You will have a completely different opinion I believe and most likely you will find it really interesting if you are into these things.  Personally I am not a sci-fi kind of guy buy I still played EVE for a long time due to the complexity and that it was so interesting. Albion is hopefully going to allow me to scratch the EVE itch with a fantasy setting. And yeah the traditional MMO look is something a lot of people miss I think but it is for the best that the camera is locked as it is.  EDIT: IF you give EVE a try then please write back what you think of it and if it has changed your view on this (unless I misunderstood you in the first place). I am very curious about how / if this will change anything for you."

albiononline,34oern,Kaizermos,2,Sun May 3 01:11:13 2015 UTC,"Ill take the opportunity to explain the system.  How it works right now: Each cluster is distributed randomly to either the European or US (east cost) server ;)    How it should work:   Dont forget it is one world like the EVE universe so no different shards However we have already 3 different starting zones In the future the starting zone and the adjacent territories will all be based on the same server (US, European...) And than players can choose in which city they start and experience the best ping However if we are talking about the yellow and red zones these clusters can be moved to different servers.[ Random Example: One cluster is located on the EU server...  ... but since the last patch we noticed that actually 80% of the people in this cluster are from the US, we will move this cluster to the US server with the next patch.   Right now it is only US east cost and European, in theory we are happy to add more locations but this is also a cost issue and therefore we have to see how many players there are from different regions. Right now we are far away from justifying an oceanic server (sorry guys).  Kr, Stefan"

albiononline,34oern,AO_Bercilak,2,Tue May 5 06:28:14 2015 UTC,"We have a very large world. This world is divided into different clusters/areas Each of these clusters is on a different server in US, EU ... In the final world there are different starting areas People from the US will start in the Starting area in the far south (just an example nothing is decided yet) Most of the clusters in this area are based on US servers so you have a good ping If you are moving more into the dangerous areas where the territories inside a cluster change possession. We can move this cluster onto a server of our choice. So if more people from US are playing in this specific cluster for the last days we can also move it to a server based in the US  I hope that makes more sense now?"

Most of the the game is offline, so you might not get your money's worth out of the alpha."
albiononline,34jz2w,jhorphear,-15,Fri May 15 07:04:24 2015 UTC,Yes you can play right now with the $50 version
albiononline,34jz2w,Fawa,2,Fri May 1 20:41:49 2015 UTC,Thank you. D you know how long I will have to play and when I can then play next. Information on this seems vague.
albiononline,34jz2w,Fawa,5,Fri May 1 20:57:40 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to him! What the heck Jhor? Not cool.  Summer alpha phase doesn't start until June - so if you purchase the vet pack right now, you can't play until June.  When it does come available it should be up for 4 weeks, perhaps a few more."
albiononline,34jz2w,DenDraad,-1,Fri May 1 20:58:36 2015 UTC,Ok so do you know what day for sure in June? Also will the $100 pack get me access right now?
albiononline,34jz2w,DenDraad,3,Fri May 1 21:02:48 2015 UTC,"So both tiers (50 and 100$) mean you have access to the alpha, but only when the servers are up. They've not specifically stated when in June, but they did say Q2 2015. Your guess is as good as mine - hope that helps!"
albiononline,342n0w,hejyhej,4,Mon Apr 27 20:44:01 2015 UTC,Nice video. Thanks a lot.   We will add more comfort for the controls once we are closer to release. Hotkeys have been implemented for the last alpha test. And the UI on PC will be more like your typical MMO UI in the future. Right now all attention is on the game design itself.
albiononline,342n0w,AO_Bercilak,2,Tue Apr 28 08:35:14 2015 UTC,Is the game open-world or instance based?
albiononline,342n0w,saintgravity,2,Mon Apr 27 22:02:59 2015 UTC,"I would call it a hybrid, like in eve, every zone is its own instance, you will see every1 inside the zone, but there will be an exit/entrance to the adjacent zones  even dungeons will be open for any1 to enter"
albiononline,342n0w,somfan,2,Tue Apr 28 01:24:09 2015 UTC,"It's open world, there are not multiple instances of zones or dungeons or anything like that. Only 1 server too so everyone is playing together."
albiononline,342n0w,VoodooPygmy,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:04:31 2015 UTC,"Technically each map is its own instance and a player has to transition between them. They're all intertwined, however, so the distinction is technical."
albiononline,342n0w,AO_Bercilak,2,Tue Apr 28 05:31:39 2015 UTC,"What hejyhej said,  maybe to add, the world will be very large but separated into these different areas which are instances.   There are several technical advantages why we did it this way. It also allows us to put these instances onto servers which are located in areas where most of the people playing in this instance are based."
albiononline,342n0w,VoodooPygmy,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:56:14 2015 UTC,"I assumed he was asking if it was instanced like Guild Wars where every zone has multiple instances of it and going outside puts you in your own instanced version of a zone where you won't run into anyone else unless you grouped with them before hand, guess I'm using the word wrong, my bad. (Though that seems to be common, here's a forum debate about WoW where a big definition for open world gets linked, a GM even jumps in and gives his 2 cents and there's still not a real clear answer at the end http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/12675159595?page=1 )"

albiononline,342n0w,spacemarine1999,1 point,Fri May 8 14:32:45 2015 UTC,You mention different pings. This may give the impression that there were different game worlds on different servers. There is only one world for everybody. Like In Eve. As it works now it is that each zone (which are separated by a fast loading screen) is 'nested' on either EU or US and that means your ping will be different depending on the zone you are in. (Or you could just get a better internet connection). I had an average of 20 on EU and about 60 on US nodes.
albiononline,342n0w,Gankstar,1 point,Tue Apr 28 05:29:07 2015 UTC,"From my understanding the game has two servers, one in europe and one on the east coast of the usa and they speak with each other to create a synced world. In practicality this system bounced players between the euro and the east coast server, based on locale population bias. As far as my internet connection goes, I have an enterprise level 110/10 mbps line. Although I appreciate the intent your advice fails to account for the principles of ping and distance. A computer connecting half way across the world is going to have higher ping than a nearby computer. For instance, I used to play a game that had a west coast server and I got 20 ping to it, many others had 90 ping or 220 ping because they were far away in distant lands. I had a competitive advantage over everyone who was not local. It is just the way the internet is and one of the reasons people choose a geographic region when playing an online game. If I was on the us east coast, for instance, I would be happy with the ping just like you are on the european west coast, but I'm not, so its not my connection it is a matter of physics and geography and the choice for this game to have a single world server rather than a North American and a European server."

Unlike larger studios like Blizzard that are established and able to devote hardware and time to maintaining them, this is a smaller studio with not so many resources.   If they devote their server's to let the usual people keep playing it'll take away from the assets they have to develop the game. Not to mention, they will need to keep monitoring and supporting a very incomplete application. The users would have a terrible experience and bad reviews about all the bugs.   More and more people would want to get on the alpha and suddenly they would need to devote more money to support it.   This way they can use that hardware and human time on a limited budget to focus on the game. Next alpha release they can focus their time addressing bugs over those weeks.

We do want to prepare more for a consistent server as we move into our Summer Alpha and subsequently closed beta testing, so it will happen soon and we are making plans for it.

Otherwise, in terms of land for building, we also implemented player and guild islands, which are ""islands"" away from the main world and are accessible only to a player or guild (and invited guests!). These islands offer land for building and farming, and some resources, so certainly we're hoping that this will alleviate the potential unfairness of ""land grab"" situations or players being left with no space.

As is, there are plots of land that you have to build houses/buildings on, and they are usually/always grouped together in little communities in the wild. So no random houses everywhere, only on preset locations. Some of them are tied together in PvP zones so if 1 guild takes it only they get to build there, the ones not in PvP are open for anyone I think, first come first served. You have to pay daily taxes (or food now, I didn't play last alpha much when they introduced food) and if you can't pay then someone else can swoop in and buy your property.  You can also build in cities and I think you need to pay taxes to the guild that owns the city you are in when you do that. Cities are a great place for building your shops, I knew a few guys that made a ton of money from having a shop near a city bank in the first alpha."

I don't think too many people are going to want to pay a sub for a game they play on their handheld every now and then. This way the game will hopefully be able to maintain a large casual playerbase which will make the world more alive/fun for the more hardcore players. And FYI the company is really commited to making the game not pay-to-win, check out their latest news release at the website, they made some pretty big changes to what you can do with purchased gold to make the game more fair for people that don't pay any money.   The cash/gold also isn't as valuable in this game as in others IMO. There's no cash shop to buy uber gear with, so even if I pay cash for in game gold I still have to purchase the gear I want off of another player, so he ends up getting the gold and someone else can now end up with the gear I just bought soon as they take it off my corpse in PvP.

albiononline,2zcw9u,VoodooPygmy,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:39:05 2015 UTC,"The news post is a lil bigger than I recall, here's the main part I was talking about:  Removal of Gold Payments  A lot of you will be aware of the forum discussions on whether Albion Online could be considered to be “pay to win” or not. Based on a poll in our forums, the verdict so far is 31% yes, 48% no and 20% undecided.  While one might say that this result is not too bad, for us it really is not good enough. Therefore, we will make a significant changes to the role of gold:  The gold/silver selection slider will be removed from the game. In game expenses will be paid with silver only. The exceptions will be vanity items and the premium status for characters. Those will be paid with gold.  For certain in-game expenses, we will be introducing a player market driven swap mechanism that will give discounts on silver prices if there is too much gold in the game. You will get the discount whether you have gold or not.  The mechanism works in the following way:  Assume that the gold/silver rate set by the game is 100 to 1 (last alpha, it was 10 to 1)     Assume that a certain action such as repairing an item would normally cost you 1.000 silver     Now, if the gold/silver rate in the player market is lower than 100, say it is 80, you will actually get a discount on the repair: instead of paying 1.000 silver, you will only pay 800 silver.     In general, the discount on your silver costs is the same as the percentage that the player driven gold/silver rate trades below the reference rate.     If, on the other hand, the gold/silver rate in the player market is higher than 100, then you will still pay 1.000 silver - you will not have to pay more. So, in a nutshell, if there is too much gold in the world, the silver cost for doing certain activities will decrease.  This is how the mechanism will work from a player point of view. What our system will do “in the background"" - but only if the gold/silver rate is smaller than 100 - is the following: it will take the silver you paid. It will use that silver to buy gold from the player market. It will take that gold out of the game. If the gold/silver rate is higher than 100, than nothing special will happen, the expense will simply be taken in silver.  From an economic point of view, what this does is the following: if there is too much gold in the game, everybody will benefit as the silver prices for certain activities will come down. On top of that, if there is too much gold in the game such that the gold/silver ratio is higher than 100, it will act as a gold sink, which will help our business model. We believe that this creates a really cool win-win-win situation between us as a developer, people who do not mind spending some money on the game and people who want to play entirely for free.   TLDR: Taking out using cash to purchase most things in game, and now in game currency will become more valuable as more people buy gold with cash so F2P players actually kinda benefit from the paying players. All because 31% of people on a poll thought the game was too P2W (not a bad % IMO considering how much more vocal the complainers usually are)"

So that's 30 kills an hour average across the entire game.  I guess I don't know how many players were in the alpha though. But still, made me curious to work it out! People need to murder more people next time :P"
albiononline,2yo1vn,Fudashii,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:17:54 2015 UTC,Two things impacted this    *They opened up farm areas where there was no pvp but the level of farm was as good as the high end red zones *The game really slowed down the last week probably a result of the above

albiononline,2xws37,Cramit845,1 point,Thu Mar 5 07:48:18 2015 UTC,"I have been wondering the same as the OP.  August 2014, I was all over this game constantly watching it and participating on the forums.  Lost all interest when the promise of key giveaway's was removed to allow streamers access and only allow the public to purchase founders packs.    Now it seems the hype for the game has died down a bit and have been wondering whats been going on since last I really paid attention."
albiononline,2xws37,VoodooPygmy,1 point,Mon Mar 9 13:53:28 2015 UTC,"I'm almost positive we won't have seasons, it's a giant world where guilds fight for territory, not a bunch of instanced PvP maps or anything like that. Guilds need to keep paying upkeep on their territory and the bigger they get the more they have to defend. There will be features in place to help little guilds compete with the big guilds and to keep 1 zerg guild from owning the entire world, I don't think they would have implemented those if they were planning to wipe the server clean once a month or anything like that. Plus you have to spend a lot of currency building your towns and all that fun stuff, which usually means a lot of time spent gathering/harvesting, would be pretty demoralizing to have all your hard work thrown in the garbage each reset IMO.   Yes there will be more than what you listed, although the things you listed have a lot more variety already than your question implies, you can build a ""warrior"" to fulfill a lot of different roles in a group, tanking, CC specialist, burst damage, etc. I didn't play the last alpha so dunno what the exact current situation on ""classes"" is atm but I recall reading that there would be a scythe weapon for a necromancer type setup and minion summoning hopefully (this was months ago in the forums, I imagine anything is subject to change but it's nice to know devs agree we need more choices in combat)  PvE is pretty bland, what makes it fun is the possibility of PvP starting up at any time IMO, but if all you plan on doing is PvE in safe zones then it will probably get pretty old pretty fast. There are bosses but they are mostly normal mobs with beefed up stats, no raid boss type battles with unique mechanics or anything (least in the alpha I played)  Game is amazing BTW, be excited 8-). Only reason I didn't play the last alpha is because the first one was so damn good I'm already hooked and I don't wanna burn out before release. (and I don't think I could handle the emotional trauma that comes with having my character wiped between alphas/betas again)"
albiononline,2xomsv,BangbangStreetStreet,3,Mon Mar 2 16:58:41 2015 UTC,"Hey BangbangStreetStreet, really sucks you didn't make the top10 because of the fame bug :(  We are aware that there is no real value to fame at the moment. All you need is a friend that does not mind getting his neck snapped a few times, while carrying old gear for you.  Fame is currently only used to block rich guilds from taking over too many territories in the first few hours/days of the game.  After that it becomes a general indicator of how much time a player spend in the game. Pushing that number artificially has no benefit, other than patting your own back because your number got bigger..  Also when using resources without durability, the resource just gets reduced itself. So a 99 stack of wood will be 70 wood, when looting the corpse.  But the main problem is, that we can't really measure whether a player is killed in a fair and (sometimes) heroic fight or just stands around until he is chopped to pieces. There are several possible solutions, but they all take too much effort compared to other problems we have to fix, that have even bigger impact on the playability or fun of the game.  Its entirely possible the whole system gets replaced eventually, but I hope you still find fun in the game (at least for the next alpha), if we can't squeeze it in this time.  Greetings,  Sev"
albiononline,2xaf3i,Tailseon,4,Thu Feb 26 23:17:57 2015 UTC,"Follow Reaa's tips and make sure you store the items in a city bank, not a bank on a Guild Island. I unfortunately did this, as well as everything else I had gathered, and one day the leader left the guild to join another, and the new leader kicked anyone he didn't know personally, including me.   That was 10K gold and all my items from tier 1 to 4, almost 5, gone.  Was hard to recover, but I did it."
albiononline,2xaf3i,InvisionGW2,1 point,Fri Feb 27 11:21:08 2015 UTC,"Woah, so these guild island banks are personal storage that a particular guild owns? Does this mean the guild master can take all your stuff if he kicks you out, or just that none of you can access it?"
albiononline,2xaf3i,InvisionGW2,4,Fri Feb 27 22:06:06 2015 UTC,"I don't believe they have access to your personal storage at the Guild Island, but if you're no longer welcome to the Island, because you're no longerin the guild, you'll be stuck with all your items gone. Therefore you should only keep low-value items that might be used at the Island.   Other than that, use the city storages.  I think they will look into a way to fix this, for example by allowing kicked members to visit the Guild Island, without being able to do anything else than accessing your own storage."

Here's to the winter Alpha - I had a TON of fun, and here's to the summer!  e: As far as their technology goes, they fixed server problems (Lag) under 48 hours.

albiononline,2vj9n7,DnXCrypto,1 point,Wed Feb 11 13:52:38 2015 UTC,"Very interesting discussion. Personally I disagree with their opinions about the premium account since i feel you can not take the f2p player (wich i myself am planning to be) as the base line, especially in a mmo wich has higher server upkeep cost then something like poe. If you take the premium account holder (wich you can aparently get via ingame means also, eve style) as the default you see f2p as an option with slight to fair disadvantages and the gold buy as another option with a slight to fair advantage over the player who just has a premium account. (as oposed to the f2p being the baseline, the gold buy being an option with a slight to fair advantage and the premium account another option that adds another slight to fair advantage) Also i would give credit and / or the benefit of the doubt to the developer atm for the past few patches wich all went in the direction of making the game easier to play without spending a dime (rep cost down [twice i think?], upkeep down, food down)"

albiononline,2vj9n7,MrLuigiLIVE,1 point,Thu Feb 12 05:44:59 2015 UTC,There was a minor land grab at the beginning in non PvP zones. Then organized groups started taking the PvP zones. Once the zones are taken it can be difficult to take the land from an organized group.
albiononline,2vj9n7,Anni_Eve,1 point,Thu Feb 12 06:24:17 2015 UTC,I feel like things such as this will discourage new players from signing up later if this sort of thing isn't managed well.
albiononline,2vj9n7,MrLuigiLIVE,1 point,Thu Feb 12 07:16:52 2015 UTC,It's more dynamic then owning land personally. My guild rushed to own land in an area only to move 3 days later. We all wasted a lot of cash on building up an area we didn't need to be.  We were large enough to afford a single location in a PvP zone and fought tooth and nail to be able to afford the property without losing it.  As for the land grab each player can get a personal island if they don't want or can't get mainland homes or shops.
albiononline,2vj9n7,Anni_Eve,1 point,Thu Feb 12 10:17:25 2015 UTC,"Well, that could still pose problems if newer players will never have an opportunity to get any valuable land.  Really though, my biggest problem with a game like this is when older accounts are able to monopolize various aspects of power in such a way that newer players will never be able to experience anything like it and won't ever be able to really compete with them in any way whatsoever.  This isn't to say that older accounts should be rewarded for the time and energy they put into the game, I just don't want to see auto-pilot profiteering come into play and I don't want to see a small minority of players controlling what happens in the game.  If I wanted to do that I'd just stick with RL."
albiononline,2vilhp,Lobotomist,2,Wed Feb 11 07:46:42 2015 UTC,It's about a month at a time and the time between each one is usually a couple of months sadly. The current one is still on for maybe 2 weeks more but they tend to extend it. Next one is this summer but there might be one added before that for spring or something. F2P The cheapest way would be to buy the epic founders pack if you want access right now and for the upcoming alphas. There's a veteran pack too that is cheaper but it only grants access to beta which is in the far future. As of right now they are not giving out anymore press passes I think and that's the only way to get a free key.   Feel free to use my referral link if you wanna get the game: https://albiononline.com/?ref=SQ6A1CCML7  I'd be happy to help ya out with some info in game too :)

albiononline,2vil1m,cooksey,2,Wed Feb 11 07:40:15 2015 UTC,can´t comment much on actual balance but when i was running with guildmates it was not uncommon that we beat a group bigger then ours because we outgeared them and / or because we were / they were not properly coordinated. have not played for a few days tho due to physics exam in aproximitly 15 minutes yey ... so things might have changed as the average gear level of all ppl increased
albiononline,2vil1m,DnXCrypto,-1,Wed Feb 11 08:13:31 2015 UTC,"Don't see why you are asking people playing the Alpha how the game is going to be on release(unless I'm reading your question wrong). The devs have expressed a desire to make zergs less powerful and not all of the gear/skills are in game yet. Release will be a different exerience than current Alpha gameplay.   That being said, you probably aren't gonna survive 1v10 ever. If that's how you plan on playing then I'm thinking map size and game population will be the biggest factors in your experience, and the release game is going to be a lot bigger than it is now so again hard to tell till we are there."

Also you can´t just pay some $$$ get gold and buy the best gear, well you can but it does not do you any good since you can not use it. You still have to go through all the progression from Tier 1 and if you do that you will also have enough cash to buy the gear for silver (at least that has been the case for me till T5, can not yet wear T6) so imo gold will not be a big negative impact for you. If you want to get a headstart it will be usefull but free to play can compete (or at least thats my impression, i had help from my guild and i don´t  know how they deal with their gold so it might have impacted me indirectly)"

But I myself play in a less aggressive guild and we haave fun PvE and PvP. Though we got totally ran over by the guild 'Black Cocks' today.. but we kinda new it would happen. Just think it as a black rooster instead of a black penis and there you go. If you want into the bigger guild I still think you can apply and get some fast gear going by 2-3 days and enjoy the rest of the alpha

albiononline,2v20qk,boredinbc,2,Sat Feb 7 03:03:56 2015 UTC,"Since the game is still in alpha phase and adjustments are being added all the time there aren't any real guides yet.   If you look at the destiny board you can see the path you need to take to get to the gear you want to use.  If you find a high level crafting station for melee, caster, or ranger in town you can see the spells each item offers.  Keep in mind you can mix and match from different trees without penalty since there is no bonus for a full set of gear from one tree."
albiononline,2v20qk,onemeangreenbean,1 point,Sat Feb 7 05:51:18 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the info.    I guess I am more interested in knowing how the paths compare at later levels.  I swapped from sword and board to bow and was really disappointed in the feel of archery.  There is no real way to kite mobs, and total damage output was much lower.  Mind you this is only on T2 gear.  I see a lot of WTB T5 Dual Daggers also.  So Im less interested in the mechanics of how to get there via crafting and the destiny board than I am about how the individual weapons and play styles feel/compare later in the game.  But I guess thats what Alpha is for.  Time to grind and figure this stuff out :)"

albiononline,2v20qk,onemeangreenbean,1 point,Sun Feb 8 06:19:36 2015 UTC,"There is nothing like that right now because the game is in alpha still.  The destiny board is much more extensive this alpha than it was last time and it will probably have more significant changes before the next test.    There will be 10 tiers in all so we know it will be growing more, and the 2h weapon system as it is right now is a new feature for the alpha.

I don't see this being a big problem, but still annoying for the solo players that like to do everthing alone. Also, the people that like to solo pvp can kinda forget it with all the guilds/groups running around in groups."
albiononline,2uywr8,RtuDtu,3,Fri Feb 6 09:55:39 2015 UTC,I have to agree with Razia on this one. I don't see these as flaws at all but common mechanics in any MMO. I probably solo a good 60% of my play time so i understand where you are coming from but i think it's just a given that going alone will be slower progression than in a guild....as well it should be in my opinion.
albiononline,2uywr8,Loumeer,3,Fri Feb 6 13:13:01 2015 UTC,Maybe the zones are so small and so few of them that you will only find groups in PvP making it impossible for solo play.  I get what OP is saying and I agree.
albiononline,2uywr8,MagicMert,3,Fri Feb 6 14:24:01 2015 UTC,You mean....... They are going to force you to group up in a massively multiplayer online role-playing game? The monsters.    If you want solo role-playing I think there are plenty of games for that. I want my group play.
albiononline,2uywr8,Gankstar,1 point,Fri Feb 6 13:40:57 2015 UTC,"The only problem I see with being forced to group up is you put people into bad situations with bad people just to get anywhere, After release the big 6 will go out do their thing and make it impossible for others to push through or new guilds to form as there just wont be any point.   I haven't played the game but from what iv seen its only guild groups roaming the woods picking off stragglers there is no chance at finding someone on their own who wont right away have 10 people swarming you, Maybe this is due to how small the map is or how much movement players have I cant say. All I know is that the PvP in runescape worked well becasue whilst being in a group was an advantage there were ways around it and if someone was left behind you could have a good fight with them before their friends showed up where as here that does not seem to be the case its simply be in a guild or get stomped by guilds.     Ways I think they could fix this issue:   Make smaller things for players to capture that larger guilds wont care too much about but could still cause some fun skirmishes between players.   Make the guild towns / castle things attackable with as many people as the other team can gather from 4PM - 10PM daily (As far as I understand you have to issue a challenge then wait for a reply and they can even just straight up say no) so guilds have a reason not to go pub stomping all day every day in full force this would also strengthen guild vs guild diplomacy without forcing guilds to have players on at all hours of the day just so they don't lose their keep to a single random player just walking by."
albiononline,2uywr8,Gankstar,-4,Mon Feb 9 23:36:27 2015 UTC,"Look, forcing people to group is not bad IF the game is like that. I understand that this is an MMO, but there will always be solo players, and for those solo players it's a huge knockoff knowing guilds do anything way faster making the solo players have very little impact alone."

This is a guild based MMO, anybody that starts to play this MMO with a solo adventurer mindset will quickly be shuffled off to other games or figure it out and join a guild.  Look at the plots, look at crafting, look at the resources being in PvP maps.  The whole purpose of this game is to force us to play with or against each other and that is how a MMO should be."

albiononline,2uywr8,Gankstar,1 point,Fri Feb 6 15:29:51 2015 UTC,"Group play is faster only if the group is composed of decent blend of classes.  All MMOs have a portion that can be done as a solo player, but it is a limited portion of the game.  I'm not sure it makes sense to create an MMO where solo play is equivalent to group play.  The tier jump is also created in a way that gets harder and harder as you move on.  They plan to have 10 tiers of all the skills on the destiny board at launch and it needs to be set up in a way that it takes a long time to reach the top tier so that there is something to keep progressing toward.  Right now each tier takes 3x the game of the previous tier to complete.  So the first few tiers are fast, but it slows way down after that.   I think a lot of the game will become more dynamic once markets and cities have more than 4 weeks to develop and the player base is much larger than the current one.  That being said, it also makes sense to implement a guild member cap and alliance guild cap to prevent the massive top tier zerg play that is occurring now."

Up to T4 everything is easily acquired as a solo player....sure T3-4 gets more time consuming but not anymore difficult.   After T4 you have to learn how to avoid the pitfalls of a solo player, something many won't be bothered to do. I am close enough to T5 to know it's possible as a solo player and may work to get it this alpha i haven't decided yet.    Honestly this game in it's current form won't be for everyone. Much like Eve, if you are the type of person that can't handle loss or don't want or know how to learn from those losses this game will push you away.

Depending on how much volume your guild/friends do, it may be worth it to purchase single plots in towns (where you can set the friend rate to 0%) and also make some money on others using your buildings, where you cannot do so on your private island."

albiononline,2ut313,enchubisco,1 point,Wed Feb 4 22:57:46 2015 UTC,"1) Depends on where i am / what i wear and what i am doing. In safe zones you fear nothing, in low sec, if i myself am not flagged for pvp i feel safe also (since only flagged ppl can attack you and those show up on the mini map untill they are close), if i am flagged i usually expect to be killing people instead of being killed but it is risky none the less. In null sec you have to be very very carefully tho.    2) At the moment i have not noticed anything concerning really. The business modell will still make or break the game for me but at the moment it seems fair. I have not used any of the gold i got for my supporter pack and i am doing just fine (all T5 gear and such but that leads into    3) the Game is imo impossible to play solo (at least from a fighter standpoint, not sure about crafter) The only way i ever dare set food in the full pvp zone dungeons is in a large party and my Guild is a huge factor why i am not too scared to do risky stuff since it sponsors gear if you die for the guild"
albiononline,2ut313,DnXCrypto,1 point,Wed Feb 4 23:42:34 2015 UTC,"Thak you, but are you forced into killing in order not to spend 30 ~40 hours doing the same repetitive stuff?"
albiononline,2ut313,onemeangreenbean,2,Wed Feb 4 23:50:25 2015 UTC,"At its core this is a traditional pvp focused mmo.  If you don't like to pvp and/or you want to play solo this  game probably isn't for you.    To avoid pvp you would be forced to stay in the 'low level' areas which do not have the resources necessary to create moderate gear or buildings.  The only people that are exceptions to this limitation are the players that like to spend their time advancing by playing with the game economy.  Personally, I left the safe / pvp limited zones after about 2 hours and other than city visits, I haven't gone back to them.  I never leave my guild plots alone and generally try to have 5+ players with me.    Our preferred play styles seem to be at the opposite ends of the spectrum, and Albion does offer a range of experiences in between, but I don't think that it will ever be immersive enough for you while also providing a safe friendly atmosphere."
albiononline,2ut313,DnXCrypto,1 point,Thu Feb 5 00:33:21 2015 UTC,"Its not like safe, i just don't like to be forced into killing, it isnt my style, i like to defend myself and the thrill of walking on a zone that isn't safe makes games for me.  And play alone, i'm kinda of forced at least in the begining because o don't know nobody who likes mmo's"
albiononline,2ut313,kazh,1 point,Thu Feb 5 00:44:37 2015 UTC,You dont need to activly look for pvp in order to progress. Your main source of silver will be dungeon runs wich are pve unless you get ganked. Same goes for farming ressources on the overworld. Pvping only really helps with gear upgrades and only if you kill someone with better stuff then you. So yeah imo seeking pvp is not necessary for progression tho it is key for bringing your guild forwards
albiononline,2uqxj6,kugadoft,3,Wed Feb 4 12:13:38 2015 UTC,"My suggestion is: head over to Journey's End and buy a private island.  That'll give you plenty of space to put up a house and other buildings.  Also you can get Tier 1 and Tier 2 resources there.  After that, take a look at your Destiny Board and just pick anything at like tier 3 or 4 that seems interesting, then work your way in that direction.  Some examples: Axe Thrower, Frost Mage, Holy Staff Crafter, Baker, Alchemist, Farmer.  Then just switch up your gameplay so you don't get bored.  Work on your island for a while.  Then go kill stuff.  Then craft better gear.  Then raise some chickens."

albiononline,2uqxj6,nickterp,1 point,Thu Feb 5 08:33:33 2015 UTC,"Hey, glad I could help.  Yeah you'll want to haul everything over (use your ox).  You can store your stuff in Journey's End or on your private island or both, moving between them is super quick."
albiononline,2uqxj6,akaaai,2,Thu Feb 5 22:21:15 2015 UTC,"Albion has many of its roots in oldschool games like Ultima Online and, dare I say, Tibia. Don't play it expecting a magical tutorial hand to guide you or other people to tell you what to do.  Even though I must admit there could be a clearer path to certain objectives and that more content should be expected, I'd encourage you to just play. Don't expect tangible and easy rewards like modern games. Explore by yourself, meet other people, experience the world. Enjoy living in there and participating in a journey.  Unless that's not your kind of game."
albiononline,2uqxj6,kazmio,2,Wed Feb 4 12:47:29 2015 UTC,Explore by yourself   this actually helped alot. simple but scary when you are in a new world(especially with full loot:P)
albiononline,2uqxj6,Stupersting11,2,Thu Feb 5 08:37:21 2015 UTC,"This is the best answer by far.  I feel I'm 12 years old again and playing Ultima Online. I didn't know shit and was just travelling around exploring what I could. Died 10000 times. After starting talking to people, guilding up you started to learn what was good and bad. At the end, you were a knight or mage of britannia"
albiononline,2uqxj6,GoodAndy,2,Fri Feb 6 09:14:03 2015 UTC,"Content is a little lacking at this point in time, but remember it's an alpha. From what I can tell in my few days of playing is that the big things you can do is: Work your way up the destiny board. Gather resources to sell or craft with. Craft gear for yourself or profit. Run dungeons (which is honestly kinda boring IMO). Pvp with friends or guildies (tons of fun). Socialize and merchant (I've made a few pennies this way)   EDIT: I forgot, you can always build buildings or farm. You can do this on a private island of you are worried about guilds taking down your stuff."

albiononline,2uqxj6,A_Black_Republican,1 point,Wed Feb 4 20:52:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that's still lackluster if you don't get in on the PVP action.   The way I see it is the game is pretty fun right now and the players are the content. It's set up for PVP. But I'll admit, the farming does add much more solo content.  I'd like a way to influence neutral mobs to attack places."
albiononline,2uqxj6,onemeangreenbean,2,Wed Feb 4 20:55:31 2015 UTC,I really love this game.  The only thing I think they could add is huge groups of neutrals that roam the roads.  The kind of groups that would take at least 20 people to fight
albiononline,2uqxj6,Stupersting11,2,Wed Feb 4 21:18:08 2015 UTC,"Neutral mobs could be used to make castle fights more dynamic.    Instead of the 15 min mass spawns, there could be a recruiting/hiring process for castle owners to pursue through allegiances with local mobs.  As they build favor with the local npcs the castle owning guild might receive structures that are only placeable in the castle and turn into castle defense npcs during a siege.  It would as a way to fortify the castle over time so newly captured castles are relatively easy to retake and it would force guilds to constantly occupy their castle territory."
albiononline,2uqxj6,Stupersting11,2,Wed Feb 4 21:29:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah true, the game Is centred around PvP though. If you don't Atleast kind of like pvp then I don't think this is the right game for you"
albiononline,2uqxj6,ed_toast,1 point,Wed Feb 4 22:22:19 2015 UTC,Run dungeons (which is honestly kinda boring IMO)   i ran a couple and it always seems to be empty down there. only a couple of mobs and a teleport back stone. am i missing something?
albiononline,2uqxj6,kazh,1 point,Thu Feb 5 08:40:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah that seems to be my experience with most dungeons too. A few of them have bosses you can kill with groups, but that's really nothing more than an NPC with a ton of health points. All in all the PvE is REALLY lack lustre in my opinion."

albiononline,2uppmy,ZiggyDStarcraft,3,Wed Feb 4 03:05:29 2015 UTC,"Would love to see persistent, non-game impacting rewards for feats or 'winning' a season. Things like sigils, building decorations, gear dyes and other cosmetics would be a great way to show your domination in a previous season without impacting the next.   It seems only a small motivator but I think the chance to have a challenge once again (or to offer a challenge to people previously dominant) would be more than enough to get people hyped for server wipes.  Yasmin did say that this topic was in the developers minds, hopefully they are considering all this already (or that this provokes them to!)."
albiononline,2uppmy,Toko22,1 point,Wed Feb 4 03:09:26 2015 UTC,"This is a great idea. You don't even need to 'win"", maybe make something available for a certain time in a world that has a time limit. Anything you win can be carried over to other realm/world, and is still fully lootable."
albiononline,2uppmy,DSdavidDS,2,Wed Feb 4 06:39:10 2015 UTC,"I think the only real issue of this would be Gold and if it would carry over. If it does, the devs will get way more players to carry over as people will not have that feeling of a sunk cost.   Resets really make sense. It also allows the devs to patch weapon strengths, and add new armor etc. to make each season exciting and new AND not making people rage if they did not unlock the new OP weapon.  Have you posted this to the AO forums? if not i will XD"
albiononline,2uppmy,Phirak,1 point,Wed Feb 4 15:27:38 2015 UTC,"I haven't posted it to the forums, you're more than welcome to!   I was thinking about gold too.

After a big loss or victory, require rebuilding   Just because I use the word ""rebuilding"" doesn't mean I am talking about building themselves. In mount & blade (the example I used) when you ""rebuild"" you aren't actually creating buildings, you are travelling to villages to recruit soldiers. In Albion Online, rebuilding could take place through a limitless number of mechanics.  Where did I say you lose all your guild buildings? I have not suggested any specific mechanics whatsoever."
albiononline,2uppmy,Yanutag,2,Wed Feb 4 09:41:52 2015 UTC,"Yea my bad i read true it quickly. But repair cost for tier 8 would be a gimp. But your right there could be other ways to find mechanics for it. I dont think its possible to destroy every building in GvG. The whole thing will add a dept to it, but it could be a destater to a guild if its done wrong."
albiononline,2uppmy,RoshansAegis,1 point,Wed Feb 4 11:31:42 2015 UTC,I have not suggested any specific mechanics whatsoever.   Well what would you suggest? Because quite honestly the only thing that makes sense to me would be for buildings to be destroyed or take damage in a successful repel of attackers. Some sort of NPC guards? Stores of guild money or materials kind of like how clash of the clans does resources but on a guild scale? Both sound like another whole can of worms.   I do think that simply wiping say yearly would be the best way but there might be something iv missed.

He may have felt compassionate and prideful to say what he did and then found out he walked into a lions den. I don't blame him.

albiononline,2updcs,enchubisco,2,Sun Feb 8 07:11:26 2015 UTC,"I like it. I got the $50 pack but I'm wishing I got the $100. Though the horse and ox you can get later. So far I've experienced that there is a lot of grinding involved. You have to use each individual piece of gear to level it and be able to wear higher levels of it.   The level system is Tier based. So if you don't go out fighting with a robe and staff on to level through tier 1-5, when that sweet staff drops from a tier 5 mob, you can't use it. Kind of a bummer but I guess it helps keep class types original. You feel accomplished when you level your weapon type up and it's not that easy for others to switch back and forth so you feel unique in a sense.   The crafting is the same as combat leveling. You can only harvest in tiers. If you haven't leveled your mining you can't just pick up a pickaxe down the rode. You have to start back with the newbie ore and work your way up.   Essentially you could level everything and be able to switch freely... it just takes a really long time to do so.   I've not experienced any pvp yet, but it's open world in some zones and you lose your stuff when you die. So be careful. I'm afraid to lose what I have so I'm waiting to male duplicates before I venture out.   I definitely recommend getting in now though before release. It'll help to learn the game so you don't have to waste those first days after release blundering around not knowing what to do or how to find things, with the rest of the masses."
albiononline,2updcs,ModernMonk,2,Wed Feb 4 02:52:17 2015 UTC,It is not possible to upgrade the pack?
albiononline,2updcs,GoodAndy,0,Wed Feb 4 11:00:34 2015 UTC,I believe you can. Though I'm not sure I would want to. The extra gold that comes with it can be earned in game. Currently it's 1 gold = 10 silver in game. And you can earn silver relatively easy. Most players selling things will take either currency. I'm sure there will be an option down the road to purchase gold as well.   The other features. .. The only thing I could never get is the gold border to my avatar and the outfit they give. I never see myself wearing that outfit as I would just lose it dieing in pvp one day lol.   I went out and used that extra $50 towards a headset for future voice chat with my guild.
albiononline,2updcs,ModernMonk,1 point,Wed Feb 4 11:13:56 2015 UTC,Silver isn't very easy to come by according to everyone else.
albiononline,2updcs,GoodAndy,2,Wed Feb 4 20:47:33 2015 UTC,"I guess it just depends on the person. You get silver from killing humanoid mobs. So if a player is out trying to solo tier 3 humanoids they will be getting 20-30 silver per kill during busy hours. Which most new players appear to be doing...   If you group up with guild mates or friends, and hit a higher tier dungeon (for this example I'll use my tier 3 armor set and weapon)... me and 2 guild mates hit a tier 4 dungeon together. In 3-4 runs of this dungeon we made 7k silver and about 10k worth of silver in tier 4 drops.   If I had spent the same amount of time soloing tier 3 mobs I would of only made about 3k silver solo in that same time frame.   It's just like any mmorpg. The rewards grow larger for the risk it takes to aquire them. People are giving up so easy when they see it costs silver to do anything above tier 3 (repair armor, craft items, refine resources). Anybody with a sliver of patients and intelligence will do just fine keeping up with these costs and making a profit as well."

Each mount is worth whatever the going rate is on normal t3 mounts, so like 5k each.   Each offers a different level on convenience"
albiononline,2un3yn,onemeangreenbean,1 point,Tue Feb 3 16:11:52 2015 UTC,The gold 10k gold is a huge bump at the beginning that lets you avoid the easier dungeons that get way over farmed.  The horse and ox were much more valuable at the beginning of this alpha because horses and oxen need to be raised on player built pastures that have been leveled to t3 + a 24 hour wait for them to grow up + the construction of a player built saddler to make them rideable.  These things aren't a high priority at the start so horses and oxen were not available for several days after the start.  It is also very nice to get the 24 hour head start so that you can avoid the starting rush to some degree and not be worried about running into people with higher gear that can kill you right away.  I assume this  will be even more useful during the open beta and final game launch.  They are all bonuses that are great when you start out and even better if you start as soon as possible.  After a couple weeks everything settles and the guilds that got quick starts can help members that don't have these packs catch up.  Just keep in mind the stronger guilds will be easier to get into if you are able to assist them by having these early resources.

Someone who might look at it and get frustrated will want to get their bearings, understand what it is and is not, and what it compares to. It would have to let people know what they can work towards, maybe section the guide out by archetypes on either side so the reader can say ""I want to be a rogue/ranger who wears claws or dual daggers"", they can see what leads to that and maybe get a link to a crafting/gathering guide."

albiononline,2ui2uk,Barhoom91,5,Mon Feb 2 09:24:37 2015 UTC,Houses on safe zones are safe providing you pay the rent. Houses in guild zones are fairly safe providing your guild feed and defend the territory from attack. Houses on your personal island are safest providing you repair intermittently.

Important for sandbox games such as this. Its nice having a do-over."
albiononline,2ugx5x,ThomasTyndan,3,Mon Feb 2 04:05:40 2015 UTC,"Indeed! I've already realized tons of mistakes I did, like not spending enough time in the starter zones to farm up, which meant it was a fair bit harder for me to get to tier 3 cause of lack of t2 resources near our guild territory.   Another huge problem is the silver, jesus those silver problems are real."
albiononline,2ugx5x,Sigurat,2,Mon Feb 2 08:40:24 2015 UTC,"Yup, understanding the value and difficulties with silver is also something of a learning curve."
albiononline,2ugx5x,ThomasTyndan,2,Mon Feb 2 11:48:42 2015 UTC,"We're testing the game and helping shape it, so that when we finally decide to play it for real it's worth it.   We put in effort because the game is super fun, the worry about resources, the frustration of dying with a full inventory, the uneasiness of sneaking through enemy territory. The constant pressure in dungeons to progress quickly but safely lest we get gang banged from behind. This game is a diamond in the rough, and the way the devs have been so far I am 99.9% certain this game is going to be spectacular once finished."
albiononline,2ugx5x,Sigurat,2,Mon Feb 2 08:36:19 2015 UTC,are there banks in the game where absolutely no one can steal from you? It would suck if you are vulnerable everywhere.
albiononline,2ugx5x,Barhoom91,3,Mon Feb 2 09:26:56 2015 UTC,Yes there are banks in every city/territory and island that you can access. Just keep in mind that each bank is local so if you leave an item at freeport you can only pick it up in freeport again. Cities and non-pvp zones are also safe.

But I found myself a way out. A way out to reach the eternity! I found a Sire to work for. To protect. To help him in the heat of the moment. Can someone get me a pass to Albion and I'll prove my existence as a good soldier? I've seen the worst nightmares... they are scary as a crow plucking the trees of life. I can help to make Albion World a better place. Someone willing to get me a sword and a shield for a couple of bucks, so I can fight side by side with you?  I tell you I was a priest once, but the world changed in a form you cannot imagine. I read poetry to the loudest of the Gods, while we was screaming for pleasure! I remember the nymphs, n_a_k_e_d, deceiving the old b_a_s_t_a_r_d.  All this happened while I read poetry to the almighty God, and afterwards, I was banned from Albion. Buy me a pass back to Albion and I'll assure you I can help you around, to dominate the world once again."

May the lord of the skies save the almighty soul, and the brave poor old people wander in grass fields. I spent years in a cell, craving the walls and praying for Albion to rescue my little mind.  The money was spent eyeing and deceiving the human mind.... I cannot afford a few bucks, but Ill tell you secrets Sire! Ill tell you secrets about the world we live on! I've seen the lands from Far Arden! I know them! I will be the great almighty healer, or the brave soldier! Just help me to buy the weapons to do so! I need the game! I'll be side by side with you, and save you every time the weather tries to kill you!  The people will fall at your feet Sire! They will never be a problem to you, cause Sire you are! My strong mind, through your dark eyes, will crucify everyone. The only thing I cannot control is the weather! That's why, Sire, that's why I'll have to protect you from it."""

albiononline,2u48y6,A_Black_Republican,0,Fri Jan 30 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"Hi, my name is Vidar and I live in Uganda. When I was 5 years old, I stepped on a land mine and lost my leg. I have lived through many hardships ever since and I am now 17 years old. I am very poor because I can not work properly. I was able to steal a computer from the junkyard and this is how I found out about Albion online, I was amazed by how incredible of a game it was and I gathered all my life savings to go and buy it. With my life savings I was able to make it to the game store but when I was there I got robbed. I struggled against the robber and got shot in the dick and he took all my money. I then crawled for 2 months covered in blood to get home. And when I got home I found out both my wife and son had died from ebola, and the doctor told me I had ebola as well and I am going to die in 3 weeks. So please full fill my dying wish and let me play albion online for the last remaning weeks of my life time, it would make me the happiest person alive. And also, I almost forgot. I have been captured by terrorists who think I am Barrack Obama, they want to have 1000000 million billion US dollar OR 1 Albion Online beta key. To save me from being tortured to death, please give me your key!

albiononline,2u48y6,locomog,-3,Thu Jan 29 21:52:30 2015 UTC,"First, I don't think I deserve anything honestly... I've gotten so many awesome things from friends all over the world (literally)  So, why do I think I have a shot at getting this gift? I dunno honestly. But I will say, that I've watched (perpetual lurker, tend to just watch streams and not chat while I play another, or the same, on another monitor). a fair number of albion streams, and wanted very much to get in on the previous testing phase to try it out. So much so that I actually wrote the Albion people asking if they'd support my stream, and grant me some kind of ""press"" key so I could do stuff while on stream.  My streams are usually quite small in number of viewers, and I account that to the fact that I started ""late"" in the streaming game . All the higher viewed streamers continue to grow while those of us that are starting off have to either scrape by, or do some extraordinary social networking to get a good viewer base.  As such, the albion guys said that I wasn't a fit for them to get me a press key.  Now, thing is, I'd normally purchase in to something like this seeing as it looks like it'd be fun as heck to stream.  However, I can not afford to do much of anything right now. I'd say go find my post on /r/hitbox introducing myself to the community there, but that's a lot of work LOL. So, as a TL:DR of why I can't afford it::Got injured while in the USMC, VA FUBAR's my disability payments, lost house, moved a few times, still fighting VA for proper payment. This has been going on for VERY long time.  If you wish to stop by my stream, I normally do Minecraft on weekdays (yay exciting compared to Albion I know) ... 3-6pm EST (so before you're going to end the giveaway). I have the same name here as most everywhere ... twitch, hitbox, and gaminglive all have the same name (and I stream to all 3 thanks to a SUPER cool friend on hitbox ... I did say I've gotten so much things free it's insane..) I'd love to be able to draw in some new viewers with a new game possibly."

I have been signed up on their website since august 2014 when I heard about the game. I watch live streams all the time and I really want to get my hands on the game but sadly cannot afford to pay to get into the alpha at this current time. This game offers everything I want in an mmo especially the drop all loot on death (one of my favorite features) and hope It would keep me playing for a long time when it comes out. If I am worthy of your key I hope we can get to play together in Albion Online.
albiononline,2u48y6,xPhoenix777,-2,Fri Jan 30 07:07:49 2015 UTC,Haven't been able to convince the wife to be ok with the founder pack purchase. Maybe she can give it a go too and we end up getting 2 copies?
albiononline,2u48y6,Lastshadowblazeitbud,-1,Thu Jan 29 21:50:04 2015 UTC,"Anyways, thanks for doing this and good luck to all the others! Looks like fun :)"
albiononline,2u5l0n,BathromShotgun,3,Fri Jan 30 02:37:49 2015 UTC,An island gives you areas to place farms and pastures. It also provides cheap building space (e.g. for a house) without any upkeep costs beyond individual building repairs.
albiononline,2u5l0n,kk-,1 point,Fri Jan 30 05:34:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, although I don't know how buildings get damaged in the first place. It may have something to do with the demolition hammer and guild territories."
albiononline,2u5l0n,kk-,2,Fri Jan 30 21:27:23 2015 UTC,I think its the only way to get a mount (im not 100% sure) i have just got my island few hours ago and made some farms to get carrots (idk much about islands) my guild jsut told me its good to set up and get farms early on. ALSO ur island is localised so its best toset it in the same port as your guild island
albiononline,2u5l0n,Lastshadowblazeitbud,2,Sat Jan 31 00:11:10 2015 UTC,I figured it was just an instanced plot of land. Is that correct?
albiononline,2u5l0n,PoisonCoyote,1 point,Fri Jan 30 03:13:27 2015 UTC,"It is, yes depending how you mean.  Its instanced in the sense there is just an abstract method of travel to it but its ""open world"" in the sense that other people can visit it with your permission."
albiononline,2u5l0n,Qweniden,2,Fri Jan 30 03:46:47 2015 UTC,"A personal Island provides a secure and cheap plot of land to start to build up your own infrastructure, giving you farmland and building plots that are rent free but limited to Tier 4. Same goes for a guild island it allows them to start creating the food to sustain a guild plot on the main map. It also provides a fall back position should your main world plot be taken over by an invading guild."
albiononline,2u5l0n,Gajet,0,Fri Jan 30 19:02:20 2015 UTC,"question about islands, can you get to them from any island vendor?  or can you only get to it from the vendor you bought it from?"
albiononline,2u5l0n,jhorphear,1 point,Fri Jan 30 08:30:00 2015 UTC,The travel in only free from the port you buy it in. You can access the island from other major cities but it will cost you a fee in silver.
albiononline,2u2687,Tartlet,6,Thu Jan 29 07:22:51 2015 UTC,"Another way for the devs in the pve zones is that they increase dungeons instances so you can cycle btw 3-6, so you dont enter the same one that has been cleared. That will help pve players to gain silver and adjust the silver drop amount."
albiononline,2u2687,RoshansAegis,2,Thu Jan 29 09:47:28 2015 UTC,"I think this could be a valid solution to the lack of silver to start with if the values are tweaked, +1."
albiononline,2u2687,TheCriticalHippo,2,Thu Jan 29 09:51:22 2015 UTC,"This would be a good solution, even if it is only implemented for high-traffic times like the first month of launch."
albiononline,2u2687,Gajet,3,Thu Jan 29 09:52:30 2015 UTC,"Thing is , as an alpha you kind of want to check out everything. I know I've switched regularly between warrior, archer and Mage and played with all crafts. Partly because it tests the systems and partly because it helps me work out what my final game plan will be for release."
albiononline,2u2687,Drexciyian,3,Thu Jan 29 17:56:29 2015 UTC,Well this is my worry because everything that involves silver can be replaced by gold which lowers the need to farm human mobs and gives you more time to farm non-human mobs(matts). They really need to limit when gold can be used for. I brought this up last night on someones stream and he went super defensive/fanboi mode while using gold he got from his founders pack for everything :D
albiononline,2u2687,jhorphear,3,Thu Jan 29 18:49:59 2015 UTC,The death penalty in this game is really high.  You just need to avoid dying.  But even then i still think the repair bills are a little high.  It almost costs more to repair than to craft new items.  I think they could balance out repairs a little bit and it would be fine.
albiononline,2u2687,Sorros,3,Fri Jan 30 13:33:28 2015 UTC,it does actually cost more to repair then to craft new.  A new T3 weapon costs 658S(crafting/Refining) and 18 resources.    A weapon that is red and like 10 or under durability was over 1111 Silver.
albiononline,2u2687,RoshansAegis,2,Thu Jan 29 15:59:28 2015 UTC,Thers other ways to earn silver then just mobing
albiononline,2u2687,RoshansAegis,2,Fri Jan 30 00:04:33 2015 UTC,"Gathering to sell isn't giving a good indication of long-term sustainability. Players are offering gold, not silver, to pay for traded goods since only silver can be used on the marketplace. (unless I am mistaken.)  Do you have any other tips? Farming to sell is a no-go because of the silver cost to plant. I could sell my excess seeds, I suppose but there's only a 50% chance of getting an extra seed and the market is saturated."
albiononline,2u2687,craneology,3,Thu Jan 29 07:36:00 2015 UTC,"We hit a crossroad where this alpha is playing out to see how to make an stabel economic system. Everyone is need of crops so far, animals and alchemy. I think they all gonna explode in the market when thers war going on. Cause you cant keep up the feed when there is a threat. And another point as the game progress gathering speed will increase so for long term you will be able to sell much faster. What i can see is that big guilds need dedicated farmers pay the upkeep and its expensive as hell just to sustain the feed for 1 terrotorie cost around 300k in the market. Most guilds will lose their zones cause of that or let it die to reclaim it. The solution for this is realy hard atm. And the one who gain by this is the solo farmers, they probably sittin on silvermine. The flaw is that market is player driven and someone will eventualy fuck the system with inflation. Like vendetta want to be a world bbank, meaning they can fuck everyone."
albiononline,2u2687,Qweniden,2,Thu Jan 29 07:48:21 2015 UTC,"The flaw is that market is player driven and someone will eventualy fuck the system with inflation. Like vendetta want to be a world bbank, meaning they can fuck everyone.   Sounds like an accurate depiction of a working market to me. The markets will adjust accordingly when the player base is larger."
albiononline,2u2687,InvisionGW2,2,Thu Jan 29 09:36:57 2015 UTC,If they don't balance this then you are somewhat right but lets keep in mind that this is an alpha and there are lots of game mechanics to balance out over the next year before launch.
albiononline,2u2687,JustinsWorking,2,Thu Jan 29 19:12:35 2015 UTC,"Not too advanced into Albion yet, but as I've been one of the ""Gold Spenders"", I've also tried to use Silver during low tiers (such as T3). It's not that bad if you're patient with the AH etc, but the problem would be that most players would farm until higher tiers, before using AH.   I myself am doing that, but selling Uncommon and Rare items."
albiononline,2u2687,TheCriticalHippo,1 point,Thu Jan 29 18:26:15 2015 UTC,"I found this issue when I was starting, but what I did was take a boat to a further away area, now I'm solo pullings mobs and they give anywhere from 100-400 silver each.  Even through I'm in PvP areas, I can afford to lose gear, and I just play very carefully."
albiononline,2u2687,RoshansAegis,1 point,Thu Jan 29 22:26:49 2015 UTC,"My group had the same problem, we are all on press pases to see how the game play's as a group for an article and we did slow down as we hit T3, but then we found out that all you need to do is too explore, if you find mobs no on has killed in a while in offbeat places you can easily cover your repair costs and have thousands of extra coin.  It's all about picking your battles."
albiononline,2u2687,TheCriticalHippo,2,Sun Feb 1 21:16:12 2015 UTC,"This a solutions i alpha, imagen the population at 20 players in each zone it will break. I get your point we dig 400k in a dungen with 10 players at tier ,  we could have done it with lesser and the progress will be easier the higher tier you have."
albiononline,2u2687,RoshansAegis,1 point,Thu Jan 29 09:18:18 2015 UTC,"When were you testing this out? Were there fewer people playing when you were perhaps? This round is currently on day 2/3 with both Legendary and rg. founders allowed in and the strain is showing. There really aren't farmed dungeons- even the ""hard"" areas like in Giant's Ring are over-farmed with mobs dropping 7-12 silver. The hits-to-kill on the giants result in weapons breaking super fast so it's a net loss unless you get something like a Promising Foal to drop.   With only two mirrored starting areas (Queen's and King's regions) it feels like there are not enough T3 areas to go around. Maybe they need to increase the minimum silver dropped by mobs to be at least 15 silver even if over-farmed?"
albiononline,2u2687,TheCriticalHippo,2,Thu Jan 29 09:26:36 2015 UTC,"Basically a large majority of the playerbase is still in the ""Starting Zones"" so to speak that have no pvp enabled whatsoever, but if you head out into the PVP zones, even the safer ones, you run into much less people and therefore much more resources.   To be honest I think it is just a thing of learning the game a bit more in depth as it took me a while to come to the conclusion as I was farming Giant's Ring too.  Edit: Typo's."
albiononline,2u2687,TheCriticalHippo,2,Thu Jan 29 09:33:18 2015 UTC,"Yes we are in pvp zones. And no the cost for repairs is no issue, even making new ones to. Thers even hiden dungeons. Graveyards can with free silver can give you a full tier4 gear fighting in them gives you around 20-40k if you move good and avoid harder mobs you can get around 20k. We did the test yesterday in the 400 k dungeon. Graveyards you can solo tier 3."
albiononline,2u2687,RoshansAegis,2,Thu Jan 29 09:37:32 2015 UTC,"See, this is more proof, people are overestimating the amount of gear required to progress."
albiononline,2u2687,TheCriticalHippo,1 point,Thu Jan 29 09:44:16 2015 UTC,"With t5 1 or 2 shotting full t3s, I am hesitant to go to pvp zones because then one death makes the whole dungeon run an instant net loss. I do get that pvp is 100% linked to endgame but the hump between t3 and 4 is really just ""middle game"" and I still feel like silver is purposefully scarce to increase the dependency on gold early.  I do not mind grinding for the silver it's just there is not a way to grind for silver when mobs drop less per kill than it takes to repair the damage they did to your gear.   That sad, some of your comments and Roshan's comments have been illuminating and I'll do a bit better job tonight looking for a better farm spot and maybe even put on my big girl panties and go to limited pvp zones. :P This feels a bit like going to lowsec in a shitty frigate but hey, it's just alpha so whatever I lose isn't really a loss I guess."
albiononline,2u2687,recurve254,2,Thu Jan 29 09:45:34 2015 UTC,"It is a bit frightening the first time you go exploring into PvP zones, but if you stick the the low sec ones I have a tip for you, if someone flags themselves for PvP in the low sec area's you get a dot on your minimap like the ones for your guildies but red instead of blue. Avoid them if you can't fight them."
albiononline,2tzn3j,monkeybusinessg,5,Wed Jan 28 18:44:23 2015 UTC,"I'm really interested in this game, and want to play it really badly, but 49.95 for an early access  is just waaay too much."
albiononline,2tzn3j,jhorphear,1 point,Wed Jan 28 21:18:44 2015 UTC,Most games that offer early alpha access want $99+.  I found the $50 price tag very manageable.
albiononline,2tzn3j,Patchumz,1 point,Wed Jan 28 22:26:05 2015 UTC,"Not really. H1Z1 asks for 15 bucks. Dayz is also well below 49, as well as Rust and Dungeon Defenders."
albiononline,2tzn3j,Qweniden,1 point,Thu Jan 29 00:26:43 2015 UTC,"It's entirely different with MMO's though. This is a free MMO, so in order to make a reasonable amount of money they kind of have to have a large price tag to enter. Unlike DayZ or H1Z1, they wont get any money from the average player trying out the game later on, so capitalizing now is important.  Plus, the Founder packs come with quite a lot of premium rewards, including a decently large amount of gold (worth a lot of $$$)."
albiononline,2tzn3j,Greefer,1 point,Thu Jan 29 18:39:54 2015 UTC,"H1Z1 is a MMO, too though? It's going to be free to play, and it will have cash shop stuff."
albiononline,2tzn3j,Qweniden,1 point,Thu Jan 29 19:09:50 2015 UTC,"When you buy a founders pack you are pre-paying for a few months of subscription once the game goes live, some cosmetic items and a decent amount of in-game currency.  The alpha access is only one of the perks of buying a founder package.  You aren't just paying to access alpha.  It still may not be worth it to you, but you should know what you actually are paying for."

albiononline,2tzn3j,Sorros,1 point,Thu Jan 29 18:13:45 2015 UTC,"It will be a hybrid where you can play for free or have a ""premium account"" subscription that gives you xp boosts and what not.  Im not positive but I think there is a chance that free to players can get the ""gold"" needed to buy a premium account from in-game commercial activities."

We use teamspeak and have side channels for people who bring their friends and want to do some friendfun with the black cock ;)  We also requier that you obey our tax system when the guild needs money. We got a speciel thing to bond us as a group and to gather for guild whith this systen. Its set so you also will gain by it, but there are certaint rules regarding to it, quite simpel.  Also we are well organized with a subbredit where you will gain access later on. Thats why we manage to do a good jobbar in the previous alpha. This system will also be a huge benefit for both partiet.  We all work togheter and we notice if someone is not. So we will teach you the important stuff on how to not fall in the shit shitlist.  Your allowed to do your own properties. But not on guild territorier with out permission. We also demand that guild things come first when in need.  You can hold your own stuff, but if you sit on materials the guild needs you enter the shitlist. Meaning 200 tier 4 wood to build a forge is need and you have it in private with out giving it to the guild.  And everything in the guild land is for everyone, if you empty or break a furniture, house, bed you replace it or ask someone who can craft it by handing over materials.  Weapons, armor, food and so on is public for the guild and it should be a high supply for it.   And also if you get attack or you feel that someone doesnt like the black cock, we rally up to grobble throat them in the guilds namn :)  You can find online after 19:00 gmt otherwise you have to contact arctic or shorty, saying that you come from reddit.

albiononline,2tsdck,Sigurat,1 point,Tue Jan 27 07:21:11 2015 UTC,"No, the 5v5 and 25v25 arenas for conquering effectively makes this game into a small scale skirmish PVP game where all of the important conflicts are swept into a WOW arena or battleground.  To use EVE as an example, imagine if every single attempt to establish a PoS engaged an Alliance Tournament style conflict between two teams.  The winner would take the territory."
albiononline,2tsdck,Qweniden,1 point,Tue Jan 27 17:17:36 2015 UTC,"Cool.  Sounds more fun than PoS bashing.  So - any idea if that actually forces your hand in combat?  Ie, does it sweep you into an instance, or lock your engagement in soemhow?  Ie, in EVE, if Fleet A meets Fleet B, A can try to engage then and there, retreat to a more tactical position, run away period, etc., and so can Fleet B.  Is it similar to that?  Or like you said, does it sweep you into an arena/BG and make you fight it out?"
albiononline,2tsdck,LongJonSamuel,1 point,Tue Jan 27 19:01:34 2015 UTC,"The open world clashes are as you mentioned, both armies have strategic choices and it is up to you to figure out what you wanna do. The arena style fights are for territory battles, everything else is open world.  Territory battles are when one guild wants to take over another's turf or territory, they have to issue an attack and then either 5 or 25 people from each guild fight it out to see who wins. The loser loses one defender point (total of 3 for each territory) once you've lost all 3 points you lose control of the territory."
albiononline,2tsdck,Qweniden,1 point,Fri Jan 30 16:52:35 2015 UTC,"Is Albion pretty much the fantasy version of EVE Online?   That's the developers and my hope.  They basically have high, low and null sec (except you can claim territory in ""low sec"").  One major difference is that Eve supports very large scale PvP battles to control systems where AO caps the territory dispute battles at 5v5."

albiononline,2tqh7y,TPatinhas,1 point,Thu Jan 29 07:13:53 2015 UTC,"The game is still a little bit ""broken"". Here's why:  +Pros 1. Game mechanics - Just amazing... crafting, farming and fame system are impecable. 2. Graphics - Perfect. No need for more words here.  -Cons 1. Agressive on some points, not in others - What I mean to express is, the game is terrible with the actual death system. Mainly because when you die, you can revive in 30s, wtf with that? You should die drop everything you own and go back to a city naked, no matter if you're on a safe zone or a PvP zone. And the other problem is, when you lost all your gear... It's because a group of 10 guys rush you out of nowhere and rampage your arse into pieces. 2. Objectives - What to do when you just want to chill? I mean, no need to run a marathon to collect resources, just play a cozy game that don't need a lot of thinking and work. Or what to do when you're tired of doing that and want to drop a legendary equipment or kill an epic boss? There's nothing yet to do or see. 3. Guild wars 2 - It's the same story, if you want to endure a little longer in this game, you need to join in a guild. You can't play solo primarily because of the equipments, you'll need the tiers VII and VIII equipments/constructions and only good guilds and players make them and beside that... the others guild will rekt you, remember?  I know the game is very raw at this point (only on alpha), but the game doesn't appear to be heading to a good ending. Maybe it's because my early acess syndrom and I'm feeding a paranoia that's impossible to get a good game if I buy the early acess ticket, but I'm clearly concerned and hoping that the game change it's direction in 6 months or so... By now, I can only say that the game it's broken."

I believe that the host sever machines running the server software are in data centers in the UK and a few in the AU IIRC.  Im in north America and I don't notice any lag.

albiononline,2tokae,KornAlbion,1 point,Mon Jan 26 15:21:29 2015 UTC,"I can explain:  There game world is one giant world. However, different regions can be on different servers.   As it stands right one, one-half of the world is hosted on a US server, the other half is hosted on a European server. So if you are playing from the US, there will be a part of the game world where your ping is super fast and another part of the world where your ping is slightly slower.   In any event, the game is designed in such a way that - while ping does matter - it is not as critical as, say, in League of Legends or Counterstrike."

In autumn, there will likely by the closed beta test, running for at least 4 weeks, ideally for longer. Sometime during beta, the plan is to switch to a persistently running game.  There is no XP in the classical sense, rather, you get better at what you do. If you kill a lot of mobs with certain items, you will advance those items and get the ability to wear higher level gear. If you gather a lot of wood, you will earn to skill to equip better woodcutting tools to gather rarer wood types, etc.  There is no instancing in the game. The only thing that you could call an exeption are islands that can be bought by players. Those however are unique and can be visited by other players.  Eve Online is definitely one of the games that we draw inspiration from. I would say that the depths of the game is very comparable already. However, I would also argue that we do not have as much unnecessary complexity for the sake of it, but only where it really ads fun and value to the game. - this is course is my subjective opinion and might well be biased :)"

albiononline,2tan8b,JRock184,3,Thu Jan 22 15:32:02 2015 UTC,"Hi JRock182,   I just made a very long post about this here: http://www.mmorpg.com/discussion2.cfm/thread/426394/How-mandatory-is-PVP-going-to-be.html  Quote:  Hi all,  1) PvE vs PvP I will try to give a short explanation of the PvE vs PvP relationship in Albion Online The game world consists of green, yellow and red zones There is no PvP in green zones There is full PvP in red zones, without any penalties There is full PvP in yellow zones, however, the defender/victim gets a significant buff if being attacked The highest level ressources can only be found in yellow and red zones. Also certain high level buildings can only be build there.  A core aspect here is the flagging system. Each player can either flag themselves as friendly or as hostile. If you flag yourself as hostile flagged as hostile, outside of green zones, you can attack everybody.  If you flag yourself as friendly, you can attack hostiles, but you can not attack friendlies Changing your flag takes some time and it can be seen by other players if you change your flag.  The key benefit of this system is that it does not restrict PvP, however, it also means that if you are flagged as friendly and come across another player flagged as friendly, you know that he does not have bad intentions and are safe. In short: cooperation can happen in PvP zones, you do not always need to be scared of everybody In the red and yellow PvP zones, guilds can conquer land. This land is then surrounded by a magical barrier, preventing non-guild/non-alliance members to enter. Thus, if you are a pure PvE player and join a guild, you can safely play inside of those conquered lands. Realistically, you can also go outside, with little bit of care and protection from your guild you will be safe.   2) Housing / Buildings  Albion Online offers far more than standard player housing. Essentially all buildings in the game, outside of certain beginner cities, are built and maintained by players. Players can allow other to use their buildings, such as a forge, for a fee. Houses can be built within player built cities, within guild-claimable land plots in the world or on your own personal player island. The personal player island is quite easy to get and offers some building space, however has certain restrictions on what can be build there and also is subject to an extra tax when crafting items etc - to make sure that open world territory remains attractive.   3) Gear  The gear power curve in Albion Online is quite flat. There are 8 tiers of gear, and each tier is around 20-30% stronger than the previous one. However, the rarity of materials and costs for gear increases by around 200% per tier. This means that low level gear is easy to replace and still competitive, whereas the hightest level gear is hard to get and replace, offers an advantage but definitely does not make you invincible. Combined with full loot in PvP zones, this will create an interesting dynamic but also means that you need to actively should maintain a storage of replacement gear and carefully decided on when to wear what and when to risk what.  Skills in Albion Online are part of your gear. You have 6 skills in total, 2 on your main hand weapon, 1 on your off-hand weapon (or 3 on a 2-handed weapon), 1 on your armor, helmet and boots each. In addition to that, gear of course has stats such as armor, magic resist, passive abilities and passive bonuses.   Gear can be freely combined and there is no class restrictions, which makes this aspect of the game extremely strategic and flexible.   All the best, Korn"

Not trying to push you away from this game or any other game like it but let the developers make the game they envision and try to enjoy it for what it is. It may not be for you and that is okay. You may end up loving it, who knows ?"

albiononline,2slbjm,Fruit-Jelly,2,Tue Jan 20 09:46:28 2015 UTC,Full loot eliminates a lot of the problems that come with real world money being converted into game currency.  Paying in this game just makes you a juicier mark.
albiononline,2slbjm,Fevir,2,Sat Jan 17 12:25:27 2015 UTC,"No.  It gives you a massive headstart, You do not have to go out and farm mobs for silver to repair or pay your building maintenance fees.  You can just do w/e you want to do without having to farm mobs to do it.  That gives you MUCH more time to get ahead.  Especially if you're a large guild and all of you are buying gold.  And especially if that guild makes you all use the same referral code to purchase your game.  Each referral gives you a TON of extra gold.  4k for legendary 2k for epic.  Some guilds have over 50 referrals that's an additional 200k gold given to the guild.  You think that's not going to influence anything?  Hmm."
albiononline,2slbjm,Fruit-Jelly,1 point,Tue Jan 20 09:48:56 2015 UTC,I didn't say it fixed every problem.. just most.  I had used gold during the last play test- all it really did was help me not having to farm NPCs as often.  This really isn't even a P2W argument at that point.  Even in similar games like Eve where you can outright buy currency- gold in this game has even more restrictions on what it can and can't be used for.  It's trading IRL time for in game time skipped (grinding awful npcs).
albiononline,2slbjm,Fevir,1 point,Tue Jan 20 10:07:52 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The amount of grind they put on NPC's definitely needs to be reworked in my opinion.  But I think Implementing the Gold Option is not the fix but a bandaid.  Those with limited time dependant on gold will either quit or buy more.  In a game like this however I do not see a long term goal in mind for anyone to want to buy more gold when it runs out, I feel they'll move on.   ""A civilization is built on what is required of men, not on that which is provided for them."" - Antoine de Saint-Exupery.   I think it would be best to implement items into the game that make you want to play it, instead of having to farm for it.   ""If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea."" - Antoine de Saint-Exupery."

albiononline,2slbjm,Qweniden,1 point,Fri Jan 16 12:23:35 2015 UTC,Eve has a similar mechanic and basically its for people who don't enjoy PvE and lets them fund their PvP activity.  Its really no big deal and it cuts down on illegal gold sellers and their bots.
albiononline,2slbjm,NihiloZero,1 point,Sat Jan 17 09:23:14 2015 UTC,"Archeage was P2W because there were some high-end items that you could get only by giving Trion money.  That will not be the case with this game.  If you grind up the skill tree you will be able to make all of the same things that anyone else in the game can make.  And if you can craft something, or if you are exceptional at something else... you should be able to earn plenty of in-game currency without spending a dime.    But any game that has in-game currency (essentially required for a player-based economy with trading) then someone will be selling gold.  That may be the publishers or it may be someone else.  But if the game is popular... someone will be selling gold.  By having the publisher sell the gold you reduce the motivation to create a shady black/gray market and/or automated bots running amok."
albiononline,2slbjm,jamie1414,1 point,Sun Jan 18 08:35:31 2015 UTC,"While I agree that the full loot system will probably cut down on p2w I will still wait to see the games f2p at launch so reply no harm in trying it out. Though the ""someone else will sell gold so it may as well be the publisher"" argument is lazy. Yes we might not get bots ( ppl  do love to undercut so who knows and I doubt the publisher will competivly adjust prices) but rather than stop a problem the publisher is going to contribute to the problem for the sole purpose of profit. I do understand that as a f2p game they need to make money somehow but what happens next yr with the next game that comes out we just buy max level bis toons for cash...but you know ppl  do that anyway so why not the publisher..."
albiononline,2slbjm,VoodooPygmy,1 point,Mon Jan 19 15:47:16 2015 UTC,Is there no character progression in this game? I feel like you could easily pay to get easy skill gains and that would never go away. Seems pretty P2W to me. Or having the money to outlast your enemies in a long war because you're dropping hundreds of dollars on the game.  edit: just read that there is no skill progression. That seems like a huge part of the whole RPG aspect that's missing.
albiononline,2slbjm,jamie1414,1 point,Mon Jan 19 00:18:50 2015 UTC,"There is, to use higher level items of almost any type you need to have used the lower tier version a certain amount, the devs have already stated you will probably never be able to use everything on 1 character, would take too long to to get the ""skill"" for it (think it's called fame). Also if you continue to use lower tier stuff you will get better at using that particular tier of that item and will eventually be able to get bonuses over someone that has less experience with it than you. It's not as big an advantage as levels/skills would be in most MMOs but it's there.  That said, time spent in game and how well you play has a lot more to do with it than how much gold you have, anything you take out into pvp territory can still get looted and then someone else is skilling up with your nice expensive gear."
albiononline,2slbjm,VoodooPygmy,0,Mon Jan 19 08:33:57 2015 UTC,I've played Darkfall Online with full loot and from my experience buying gold is a massive advantage.
albiononline,2slbjm,jamie1414,0,Mon Jan 19 15:31:19 2015 UTC,"The difference between a max level/geared character vs a new guy in Darkfall is a lot bigger than the difference between the 2 in Albion. Underdogs have a much larger shot at winning a fight in Albion I think. I BELIEVE the difference between each tier of gear is something like a 20% improvement over the previous tier (Been a while since the last Alpha and my memory sucks) and there's only 8 tiers of gear, so you never get to the point where you are 1 shotting people or soloing groups of noobs in PvP. You can have the best gear in the game, but get yourself in a bad spot and you are gonna lose it all real fast. My guild would constantly run a 5man into pure pvp territory with real crap gear and just upgrade our gear from the loot of out enemies, many times we would start in crappy tier 2-3 gear and end up in full t5 by the end of the run which was pretty good stuff for most people at the point in the alpha we were doing it. Also I think they are making higher tiers of gear available in the safe zones, so the gap between a max geared guy and a guy in easily/safely attainable gear will be even smaller than it was last alpha.   In both games, organization and communication with your guild are a lot more important than the gear you have on IMO."
albiononline,2slbjm,VoodooPygmy,0,Mon Jan 19 20:16:17 2015 UTC,You make it sound like one guy is going to run around solo in paid maxed out gear. There will be full clans running around in max gear that they paid for and there will be no competition and they will rarely if ever lose their gear. Cash shops are terrible.
albiononline,2slbjm,RSredditBot,0,Mon Jan 19 21:39:58 2015 UTC,"If that guild manages to never once get outnumbered in the entire history of their gaming career, then yeah fine they will win always. That's not gonna happen, people can get stupid or overconfident or just plain outplayed, and 5 guys running around in tier 8 can lose to 10 guys in tier 5. If 1 guild becomes all powerful it will encourage other guilds to alliance up and attack their territories. Also guilds tend to be very confident on their own terf, a quick raiding group can get in a few kills on solo or small harvesting/pve groups that were trying to play it safe in their guild's zone and get out before getting caught. Also I don't understand your statement of full clans running around in max gear with no competetion. If multiple clans have max gear, aren't they each others competition?  If you are 100% against the idea of a cash shop in any form, then this isn't the game for you. I'm pretty sure that the F2P model with cash shop is going to result in a much higher population than Darkfall has so I'm all for it. And FYI I personally collected a decent amount of other players founder's items off their corpses, 1 time only items you get for purchasing the founder's pack. Just because someone pays cash doesn't mean they are a good player."
albiononline,2s0cav,DenDraad,1 point,Sat Jan 10 23:33:55 2015 UTC,"That is a good question and something that is seems Sandbox Interactive are actively working on to try and balance.   Here is the official post from the devs that includes some info on the flagging system. Mainly you can flag yourself as friendly and you cannot engage in combat with other friendly flagged players.   As it is alpha there is many things that will need changes and SI is trying to keep this one close. It's always a challenge to create a hardcore MMO and to make it viable to new players who want to get into these kind of games.  tl;dr this will be the first instance of any kind of PvP control in the game, devs will be changing it around to work the best they can."

albiononline,2rwkre,PasKarma,1 point,Fri Jan 9 22:52:29 2015 UTC,"You can definitely play solo, don't let anyone tell you that you can't. I played solo last patch and was very powerful, you just have to be smart about how and where (and when) you farm.   You will be at a disadvantage in the fact that anywhere you go, you won't have protection with backup, but you can absolutely play this game solo.  I ended up I tier 6 gear, and easily in top 5% of server playing 95% solo.  One thing you may want to consider though is joining a guild anyways. I know this goes against what I just said, but if you join a fairly casual guild of solo minded players, you can maybe secure one or two territory spots where you will have a safe zone to run to if things go south quickly.  You will still basically be a solo player. The key would be to try to find or set up a guild full of solo players, if that makes sense."
albiononline,2rwkre,Double_Joseph,0,Sat Jan 10 14:37:52 2015 UTC,"Those ""solo"" player guilds would still need to work together to fight for and defend land, at that point you might as well consider yourself a real guild, which goes against what ShadowNinja808 is looking for.  Really this game in its current state is group focused, I don't really see that focus changing with the way territory conquest works (nor should it, there desperately needs to be a title out like what Albion is proposing).  If your heart is set on being solo and not cooperating with other players, you might want to consider a game that's less group focused.  On the flip side, no reason why you can't try the game when it releases, and the game is still being developed so maybe more solo friendly stuff will come out.  Keep in mind the full loot open pvp nature of the game though when you're going outside of safe zones."
albiononline,2rt22w,God-Killer,3,Fri Jan 9 01:08:30 2015 UTC,"Territory control and player driven economy pretty much requires large guilds. In most mmos a guild only has to be large enough to cover a raid plus fill ins so you get to know your guildies quite well, but I think you'll get that camaraderie if you're that type of player with smaller teams in five vs five for example. A guild in a game like this is basically a faction and you'll likely end up hanging out mostly with a smaller group within your guild/faction."
albiononline,2rt22w,kazh,1 point,Fri Jan 9 02:18:11 2015 UTC,Zerging was a problem at the start of the last test. Big guilds were able to claim the best plots fast.

albiononline,2rt22w,DenDraad,1 point,Fri Jan 9 08:36:30 2015 UTC,"This is exactly correct.

albiononline,2qpd15,iSunshine,1 point,Mon Dec 29 18:59:39 2014 UTC,I'm hoping as far as the UI goes on PC/MAC that they will have that they will have the ability to customize (move frames and such)  Although IF that was the case I don't expect that anytime during alpha and most of beta.

albiononline,2q9qg2,LongJonSamuel,1 point,Thu Dec 25 03:00:34 2014 UTC,There is a destiny board system where you unlock weapons/armor by using the lower level type of item. You can also be stronger with certain weapons/armor by using them more often. Economy revolves around resources that people need to craft weapons/armor and the silver you gain by killing mobs. There will always be a demand for items because it is a full-loot game so items are always diminishing.  Its like Runescape where there is no class system that locks you in wearing certain items. But you still need to level up to wear these items.

I mean, yeah, it makes the game hardcore but come on... I think that a system like in Lineage series would be much more fitting. When you PK someone you become ""red"" and when you die you have a chance to lose you stuff (it could be changed here to remove the chance factor).  I don't know... I like everything about this game besides what I wrote above... Maybe it's simply not a game for me."
albiononline,2q9qg2,ExinX,2,Wed Dec 24 23:49:51 2014 UTC,"This game is not for the weak-willed. Having a risk in the game makes it more exciting in my opinion.  And to be honest most gear isn't hard to get, and if you are smart you wont risk your best gear in PvP zones.    The average themepark player will disregard the game after reading ""full-loot"" because they are so used to casual carebear gameplay and the thought of losing their items is ludicrous to them.   However, after grinding out the game and looking at your assets, they become much more valuable because you can lose them anytime if you are not careful so you cherish them more.   Everything about the game becomes more meaningful with a full-loot system, you cant just not think things through and expect good safe results. You have to be ready for danger at anytime and always remind yourself of risk vs reward when playing.   I can't speak much for solo-play but I suggest you go to the albion forums and apply for a guild, I believe the game will be so much more enjoyable playing with a group you get along with. You will also be more safe gathering resources if you guild controls some territory."
albiononline,2q9qg2,kazh,0,Thu Dec 25 03:18:29 2014 UTC,"Thanks for some explanation. The problem is that I don't have much time to spend on a game. I will have to see for myself how troublesome getting gear is. I don't know what playerbase the developers are aiming this game at, but if gear will be very hard to get, they will almost exclude/discourage the more mature players..."
albiononline,2q9qg2,LongJonSamuel,2,Thu Dec 25 04:03:58 2014 UTC,"more mature players   What do you think more ""mature"" players prefer?  It's not a stat creep game with a raid progression to keep up with, since items are crafted by other players, crafting will be a major part of the game so there will be a lot of crafted items regardless of how often those items are discarded. If there's one limiting factor for you I think it would be the necessity to find a guild that can offer some protection but also give you affordable access to gear and give you a venue to sell items yourself.  Think of gear in a game like this more as ammo, health packs, or boosters. You're going to grab a piece of gear and slot it for awhile until it's broken or taken and then you'll quickly find and equip a new one. Your characters progression will be learning things and progressing your guild and the meat of the game will probably be player interaction."
albiononline,2q9qg2,Fudashii,2,Fri Dec 26 23:20:20 2014 UTC,"I was rereading the dev roadmap and remembered this post here I will quote it.   Crime Flagging: We believe that the current ""crime flagging"" system does not work well. We will replace it with a system where players can self-flag as ""friendly"" or ""hostile"". People can still attack each other freely in PvP zones with the exception that friendly players cannot attack other friendly players. Instead of having the crime debuff in yellow zones, we will instead give friendly players a PvP buff in yellow zones. Of course, changing your flagging is subject to certain timers and restrictions.   Seems kind of similar to what you said."

albiononline,2o8kgi,DaddyLTE,1 point,Thu Dec 4 06:21:40 2014 UTC,"Korn of SI provided some further insight on the official forums:   Hi all,  here is some more info for you:  Food for territories  Food for territories replaces the current silver upkeep. The key difference here is that you need to physically go to the territory to deposit food there in order for the upkeep to work. Immersion-wise, the monoloith will probably be replaced with another building (such as a watchtower with NPCs on it) to show that food is being consumed there.   Food for crafting buildings  What we did not like in the previous tests was that repairing of crafting buildings was quite annoying. Still, we want to keep the task of maintaining them as a part of the game. Food accomplishes this but makes it much easier, as food is essentially one single universal value that is contained in all different types of meals/food items. (we call this value ""nutrition points""). Food will be used over time and/or per item crafted.   How often do you have to fill up the food storage?  This is subject to balancing and testing and can be easily changed. We will likely allow for a substantial time buffer here (i.e. more than 24 hours for sure, maybe even a few days!)  The reward system  We found during the last test that there is a ""moral hazard"" when it comes to maintaining crafting buildings. Meaning that for a single player, it is usually not worth it to help mainting it (rather wait for other to repair it and then craft your stuff). The reward system deals with the problem. Essentially, the owner of the building or the guild can pay people who supply the building a pre-set amount of silver per nutrition point. This will also work for crafting buildings in player cities and safe zones, thus creating a nice food production economy.  Supply routes  For the GvG warfare, the food system will create a nice new strategic factor, which is the task of supplying your territories with food. You might be able to produce your food on site, however, it could also be the case that you need to transport it in in order to keep your territory supplied. Thus, we will likely see guilds doing supply runs and other guilds trying to stop them.  Food prices / inflation  At some stage in the food production cycle, silver will be required to create the food. We will initially balance this in such a way that roughly, the amount of nutrition points a meal gives is proportional to its effective silver costs, with exceptions for food that can only be grown in space-limited special places (i.e. special farmland in PvP zones). As a result of the above, we expect ""safe zone/island"" food production to be a very low margin business, whereas PvP zone food production is more lucrative, but also restriced by space and of course, PvP.  Notifications / Food Overview  Of course, we plan to show the relevant food levels to the players, such that you know if a building or territory is about to run out. Also, we want to show buildings that offer a reward to supplying food, such that people can take advantage of this. I.e. if you want to, you could be a full-time food supplier in the game and make your money this way.   source: https://forum.albiononline.com/index.php/Thread/6481-A-lil-blog-on-food-for-you/?postID=66182#post66182"

albiononline,2ni8si,Greg61490,1 point,Thu Dec 18 05:12:29 2014 UTC,So if i buy the 30 dollar alpha thing i cant play it till january? So we still dont know if its gnna be worth it as alpha to play yet?
albiononline,2ni8si,EntityOfSin,2,Tue Dec 2 19:48:00 2014 UTC,"The game is worth playing IMO. I spent $100 on a founder's pack. There aren't very many sandbox MMOs out there that aren't being ran by moronic developers. The devs of AO do listen to their player base and put things in the game that people want and things they think are really cool additions to gameplay.  The thing that will make or break this game for me personally is gear diversity. If they maintain that by providing players the ability to craft gear with a large selection of spells to craft onto the items, then we'll see a lot of interesting strategies use in world pvp and guild vs guild pvp.  Also, all of this is of course that I am a content creator and will be making a lot of YouTube content of the game. So to me the $100 is a business investment that I'll be able to get back out of the game through the monitization I get from videos.  So yes, to me the game is worth the money. Just expect a lot of crafting and gathering in the between between Tier 1 to 4 gear. Tier 5+ gets you into pvp areas and the time it takes for you to get ready for Tier 5 isn't that hard either. You could get that in a couple days of playing and rushing to that."
albiononline,2ni8si,Vid-Master,2,Tue Dec 2 22:11:22 2014 UTC,"There aren't very many sandbox MMOs out there that aren't being ran by moronic developers   I seriously wonder why that is!?  It took me so long to find Albion online, and as far as I know there aren't any other well made games like it.  Every game is just like a stupid copy paste money making machine for the devs, it is very annoying to play a game just to lose interest in it so quickly.  It really does seem like Albion is what I have been looking for though! :D I hope I never have to look again!"
albiononline,2ni8si,Greg61490,1 point,Wed Dec 3 14:57:20 2014 UTC,Thank you for the response. So if i purchased the 30 dollar pack i can play it now? Online is stating not till january.
albiononline,2nhfd8,indigo-alien,7,Wed Nov 26 15:22:19 2014 UTC,This game is not remotely for you.  I'm here for the exact opposite reasons you've listed.  I hate PvE where you don't have to look over your shoulder and I'm bored to tears of games without death penalties.
albiononline,2nhfd8,Kaizermos,2,Thu Nov 27 05:36:26 2014 UTC,"I really want to get in on the alpha for this game, but the $50 fee for an alpha is making me hesitate after I dropped $150 on the failure that is ArcheAge. What are the developers doing to prevent this game from becoming a cash grab? AA had very much the same promises (only cosmetics in cash shop, no p2w, no BiS in market, etc), only to succumb to it, which was probably caused on some level by increased market pressures and the fact that Trion is in so much debt.  What's going to prevent Albion from going down that same path that I would feel confident in the longevity of the game to throw down $100 for the founder pack?"
albiononline,2nhfd8,lonelytireddev,1 point,Thu Nov 27 15:03:14 2014 UTC,Skip alpha and wait for launch if you have a bad vibe about it. I had a bad feeling about putting money into archeage after watching some streams and reading up on it so I didn't put any money into that. I don't put money into a game until I've followed development for awhile and have also gauged the team behind it. Just going by that same process I had for AA and other games I decided 50$ wasn't going overboard. I have a bit of confidence in a couple of other games as well but I wont delude myself into thinking it's not a gamble.   I am pretty set upon not spending 100$ again though and I think from now on I'm going to hold back to 5-25$ to support a game development if the devs don't come off as scamming dicks and save the rest of my money for the game itself.
albiononline,2nhfd8,kazh,3,Thu Nov 27 19:32:13 2014 UTC,"I also looked at AA and Hartsman answered on a couple of my Reddit posts before the game was in Alpha. I decided to wait for release and obviously I'm glad that I did.  I bought GW2 for 60 euros, and that was only a few days before OBT went live. After that it makes no sense for me to pay $100 or more for Alpha access to any game. If some company wants me to test their game they can pay me, or at least invite me. I'm not going to pay for it.   The money isn't the issue. I'm retired and my wife will retire at the end of January. We drop about 100 euros per week going dancing, for social salon sessions, private and group lessons. Fifteen dollars or euros a month is nothing but I have never found anything that was worth that much."
albiononline,2nhfd8,Njoy32,-2,Thu Nov 27 20:54:37 2014 UTC,"except you are not paying for alpha access, you are donating money and as a thank you they are giving you alpha access, this is a indie team who relies on help, they dont have investors or publishers, without our donations this game wouldnt be half what it will be... Archeage was just a dickmove, the game was developed already and everything, they didnt need money to develop the game, they literally sold alpha access wich is different."
albiononline,2nhfd8,Njoy32,2,Fri Dec 26 12:15:09 2014 UTC,"After being screwed around by a couple of the early access plans, I'm not in the donating mood.  On the other hand, my doctor is supporting a Syrian refugee family here in Germany. That looks like a pretty good donation."

albiononline,2nhfd8,LongJonSamuel,2,Fri Dec 26 12:40:24 2014 UTC,"I agree, this isn't for you. I also am here for the opposite reasons as you.  Some of the most fun I've had in a game in a while came in Albion. I was on Tier 5 mats, among the strongest players on the server. I was wearing my T5 gear, as I had enough for a backup set incase anything went wrong.   I entered a map and found a completely full T6 node that is rare in my lands. Instead of just gathering it (like in an ""easier"" game), I zoned out, and zoned in to check number of players in the zone. Only 3 other people... good news, I saw 2 of them going south earlier, and they wouldn't bother me, because I was 2 tiers over them. So I start collecting the mats.  I got a bit greedy and overburdened myself by 10%, figuring I'd have an easy way out of the map. Just before I exit the map, 10 people zone in from my rival guild. They land a root on me, and I think I'm totally screwed. I end up shielding up, healing up and JUST BARELY zoning into the city, with my full T5 gear, my T5 mount, T5 bag, and full inventory of all T6 mats.   Once I loaded up, the other 10 people zoned in had a bit of back and forth chirping from either side.   You just can't get that kind of excitement from a baby MMO. My heart was PUMPING."

Very true, but most times, for most players the outcome is very different.    Thanks for this insight though.  I, too, was looking into this game, but for the same reasons as OP, I'm afraid I'll have to pass.  I look to games these days as something to relax with for a few hours after a stressful day's work.  Open world PvP is just not what the doctor ordered, heh.  Games that have dedicated PvP/Safe zone are more to my liking.  I can build/farm in peace, but then go toe to toe for some PvP action if I choose."

albiononline,2mlsf5,yaxir,1 point,Tue Nov 18 05:43:07 2014 UTC,"Yes, in the roadmap thread there is a bunch of discussion regarding it as well as more specifics:  Islands: We identified a fundamental problem with building space, namely there is either not enough of it or that if there is, it is often too expensive for most players. In the case of guilds, there is also the issue that all space might be taken or that the guild is simply not strong enough to conquer a space from somebody else. As a solution to this, players and guild will be able to buy an island, which will contain a lot of building space and will be safe from GvG. Islands can be reached via a harbour and can of course also be visited by other players.  Islands Balancing: Once you have bought the island, there will be no regular upkeep, however, there will be higher taxes on anything that is being produced there (to make sure that usually, you would still rather have a space in the open world). On the island, you will not have any real resource or mob spawns, which means that you will still have to get your resources from the main world. (maybe with the exception of tier 1 and some tier 2).  Farming on islands: These islands will play a key role in farming, as this will take up a lot of space that is simply not available in the current game world.  source: https://forum.albiononline.com/index.php/Thread/5785-New-6-Months-Roadmap/"

The game is in a great state for an alpha, way more stable than most early access Steam games, I only found 1 real bug in the whole alpha (pathing issue in a dungeon that got my group killed, just avoided that dungeon the rest of my playtime). There were a few other bugs I didn't experience myself but devs had daily patches and got the big ones cleaned up fast I believe.  I constantly heard in global chat players saying the devs should just release the game now since it's just as stable as any other MMO and more fun that most even in it's current state (they are going to be adding a bunch of stuff, check out the new roadmap.)  Game is a ton of fun, if you are into guild warfare and full loot PvP it's one of the best choices out there IMO.

I got 0 regrets on my purchase ( I went 100$ route ). Might make sense for you to buy the beta founder pack now ($30) since beta isn't terribly far away. Almost all of the items you get in the more expensive packs are lootable and decay when you die so you aren't missing much there. The gold is really useful for day 1 plot purchases also, eventually you can make enough silver to buy land and pay upkeep but from my experience it's pretty impossible to pull that off in your first day so day 1 land owners are probably gonna all be gold buyers (or organized guilds) FYI.

albiononline,2l58pl,Kaotism,2,Sun Nov 16 08:53:07 2014 UTC,It was posted on the Albion Forums that the winter Alpha should start mid/late January. Was supposed to be December but they pushed it back so that more content could be added.
albiononline,2ksy7r,Phaserlight,5,Thu Oct 30 18:13:34 2014 UTC,Not sure what is up with the downvotes. It's true.
albiononline,2ksy7r,tututitlookslikerain,3,Tue Nov 4 00:42:31 2014 UTC,I think that's more in terms of RPG's whereas vendetta (great game btw) is more sci-fi. Although the claim certainly isn't 100% it's not too bold to say they're the first RPG targetting all main platforms.
albiononline,2ksy7r,LongJonSamuel,3,Wed Nov 5 18:14:59 2014 UTC,"Sci-Fi isn't mutually exclusive with (R)ole (P)laying (G)ame; a game can fall into the science fiction genre and still be considered Role Playing (e.g. Mass Effect).  Further, VO claims to be a MMORPG right on the landing page.  I find it more likely that this game was simply overlooked."
albiononline,2k9qrs,Anni_Eve,2,Sat Oct 25 07:20:03 2014 UTC,"I am really pleased with a lot of the features proposed in this roadmap.    I've been on the fence, but now am now really looking forward to this game!"

Its pretty much dead, when this game was on stream on twitch it also seemed pretty dead. I have nothing against the game as a free to play game, but I don't think its worth your money."
albiononline,2jr5e9,Smashreddit,5,Tue Oct 21 21:25:45 2014 UTC,You do realize it hasn't been released yet? I don't buy founder packs or any of that early access crap (I've learned my lesson) but I have every intention of playing this game premium membership when it's actually released.
albiononline,2jr5e9,druska,3,Wed Oct 22 01:56:31 2014 UTC,"IMHO it is stupid to compare the amount of reddit users or activity of a game that you can not even play at this moment (the servers are offline till next alpha).  There are a lot of other mainstream alphas that have the same reddit activity e.g. /r/fortnite which is supposed to be the next big Free2Play action building game from Epic Games and one of the first games that will use Unreal Engine 4.  There are a lot of passionate players and followers for Albion. The activity on official forums is much higher than on reddit. The developers are actively communicating with the community. By no means could this be called a dead game.   There are many reasons why people were not streaming the game on twitch:   The game is all about guilds and using voice communication. You do not ever want other guilds to know what your guild is up to. They could gang up on your guild while they are farming. Stream sniping - e.g. guild groups up to find a streamer and kills him!. Not proud of this but our guild did this to another guy 2 times in a row. He was close to rage quitting when he lost all of his t4, t5 stuff. The previous alpha was mainly about farming and getting to the highest tier level so guilds could prepare for next alpha. Watching somebody run around the whole map to find some tier 6 wood and chop it down is not a lot of fun.   The game in the current state is quite robust and fun, though it still needs to add a lot of features to keep the player engaged. A lot of work needs to be done to improve the solo player experience. The game is really hard if you are not in a guild.  I bought the 50$ founder pack and enjoyed the previous alpha. I would recommend buying the 50$ founder pack and see whether you like the game."
albiononline,2jr5e9,SOLIDAge,-1,Wed Oct 22 18:36:41 2014 UTC,Something obviously is drawing you to the game so I say check it out! Also they do refunds on purchases...so I guess worse comes to worse you could request the refund.
albiononline,2jr5e9,RoshansAegis,-2,Mon Oct 20 06:02:55 2014 UTC,"Wait until the winter alpha is out, and wait some more to see if they gonna polish the fails. Dont fall for the hype!

albiononline,2in35n,Plugawy_Nedznik,1 point,Tue Oct 14 13:41:51 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure that's inaccurate.  Your corpse is lootable the whole time -- but it disappears entirely after a while.  At least... that's my understanding.

albiononline,2hz7t2,jefvel,3,Thu Oct 2 07:38:26 2014 UTC,"I'm not complaining about being killed, But practically any time I saw someone from bc talking it was juvenile trash talk or insults. Age has nothing to do with it."

I can understand the flaming getting out of hand sometimes, I am rather known for my harsh language but it helps to rein the tongue in when discussing on sites such as these, it is simply easier to communicate that way and people will feel more inclined to join you.

albiononline,2hqo9j,iClubEm,4,Sun Sep 28 23:47:18 2014 UTC,"The trading, probably. If you are not into crafting, just grind the necessary silver and buy from players."
albiononline,2hqo9j,stormc,3,Mon Sep 29 00:11:04 2014 UTC,Not every game can appeal to all players.  I like the crafting.  My only worry with crafting is that there wont be specialization and thus a market.
albiononline,2hqo9j,Qweniden,1 point,Mon Sep 29 19:16:50 2014 UTC,I love being able to do everything with one character. I hate having to specialize. Being able to do everything makes me work a lot harder on my main and gives me more to do. I hate having to have alts.
albiononline,2hqo9j,fatealign,2,Wed Oct 8 17:41:29 2014 UTC,"I too understand the desire to be able to do everything but I only enjoy they games when they have real, complex and emergent economies and social structures and like the real work this only can happen with specialization."
albiononline,2hqo9j,Qweniden,1 point,Wed Oct 8 17:54:26 2014 UTC,I disagree with that. Runescape allows you to do everything and 2.0 had a fantastic economy. Most people would specialize because it takes so long to level but the option is there.
albiononline,2hqo9j,fatealign,2,Thu Oct 9 01:39:47 2014 UTC,Im fine with the option to be there as long as its rare.  A game should organically motivate specialization and it sounds like Runecape 2.0 did that.
albiononline,2hqo9j,Qweniden,1 point,Thu Oct 9 01:43:20 2014 UTC,"I agree with you, it should just be a lot harder (opportunity to put more content into the game) to ""max out everything"" but easier and less time consuming to focus on one or two certain things."

albiononline,2hqo9j,kazmio,2,Thu Oct 2 18:56:10 2014 UTC,"I'd rather see monsters drop rare crafting materials than drop gear.  In Monster Hunter, killing enemies in certain ways or hacking off certain limbs while fighting it will give you different materials. It's a little grindy, but it's also pretty bearable. Trying to get off a beastie's tail spikes is different than just going at it head on."

albiononline,2hkbb9,Smashreddit,4,Fri Sep 26 21:22:59 2014 UTC,"So there is crafting, gathering and combat progression based on the earning of ""fame."" Fame is basically xp. Each tier of resource or mob is worth a certain amount of fame. Higher tier = higher fame. There is a giant wheel of progression tracking called the destiny board. For the crafting and gathering its basically, gather/craft x amount of fame to unlock the ability to gather/craft the next tier.  The combat portion of the destiny board focuses on unlocking the ability to use the next tier of gear. Example: You have to wear cloth armor for x amount of fame-worth of kills before you can use the next tier of cloth armor. And so on and so on.  So after you unlock the next tier, you have completed level 1 of 5 of a destiny. So now, the next fame levels (2, 3, 4 and 5) you earn bonuses. So for armor you get bonus hp, weapons bonus damage, gathering tools are better yields and crafting bonuses for making items."
albiononline,2hkbb9,Verde321,2,Sat Sep 27 03:39:23 2014 UTC,"There is actually the ""Destiny Board"", a sort of skill (passives) tree.  Where you can specialize your character in whatever you want (crafting, gathering, PvPing etc.) :)"
albiononline,2hkbb9,Mikasaz,2,Fri Sep 26 21:30:42 2014 UTC,"It should be noted that the devs have stated that you won't be able to max out the destiny board, it's just too damn big with too many choices, so there is a ton of progression on that board.

I don't see what benefit a planner would give you that just looking at the destiny board wouldn't.

albiononline,2hdfq2,itsIckz,10,Wed Sep 24 22:06:17 2014 UTC,"Keep in mind that it is an alpha and there is a lot that can and will change from now to launch.  My experience in the alpha so far (Tier 5 geared), there is absolutely no way you can compete as a solo player. Guilds will gain control of PvP areas, and have a safe(ish) place to farm materials. This entire game is about control of materials, and guilds simply do it better.  Solo players can wander into pvp lands, but every single other person there is trying to kill you and steal everything you earn. Being in a guild on the otherhand, you may have 12 people in a cluster, but 11 of them are your guildmates. You have the entire map safe to farm, and if anyone comes, you can rally the troops to make them wish they never did.  Next point comes from the fact that after tier 5, the specializations start to branch out. A guild can put a single player focussed into each spec and they will level up at (more than) the speed that you will in one spec. After a week of this, you will be so far behind being a solo player, that you will likely be facing tier 7-8 guilds while just making it to tier 5 yourself.  Next point is buildings. Guilds can cooperate and build guild halls, which allow for massive amounts of furniture (chests), and also a guild will complete buildings much faster, simply due to efficiency of having people pooling towards a common cause.   Right now, Albion online advertises as a sandbox game, but honestly I don't see the sandbox at all. It is simply a guildwars game. That being said, I quite enjoy it, and I will certainly play this game when it goes live. It is completely not a sandbox game at all, and playing solo (competitively) is just simply not possible (at this stage - alpha)."

I'd give you my script but I suck at autohotkey and there's something wrong with it where it gets stuck in spam mode seemingly at random and I have to minimize the game and close autohotkey hoping my left clicks don't do something terrible or occur at a bad time.  It has made movement so much easier for me, I honestly wouldn't be able to play the game without it, hope the devs aren't against players using programs like this to help them play the game and avoid/manage physical issues/pain"

albiononline,2h5kvy,bmanny,4,Mon Sep 22 19:23:37 2014 UTC,"You've got your ratio inverted, but overall the point still stands. 1gp is actually = 10 silver. Still, this Pay2Win currency in no way breaks the game. Release day will see gold balanced out because of all the Founder's trying to burn their ""day one gold"". Afterwards it may become more valuable because almost certainly fewer people will pay for it."
albiononline,2h5kvy,smokejaguar1337,3,Mon Sep 22 20:09:27 2014 UTC,You are correct. My ratio is wrong and I should feel bad.
albiononline,2h5kvy,Suuperdad,1 point,Tue Sep 23 12:41:29 2014 UTC,"Moreso, your numbers are out to lunch. I'd like to know what mobs you are killing that are dropping 1k silver.  Right now the only mobs that drop close to that are T6 elites, which typically drop 500-1500 silver depending on the time of day. You need a party to kill them, or be in full T5-6 gear. If you die at all (fighting the mob and someone kills you) you lose hundreds of thousands of silver of gear right there.   I'd recalculate your numbers using about 250 silver per kill, which is approximately what T6 mobs drop a slower parts of the day (down to around 75 silver each at peakier times of the day).  That being said, I still agree with your overall point, that gold really isn't worth that much, and if someone wants to spend 100 bucks to gain what I can gain in a few hours of farming (even being super conservative), I'm totally cool with them supporting the game."
albiononline,2h5kvy,Allshadyjr,0,Wed Sep 24 22:43:18 2014 UTC,In tanners u can go to the hidden dungeon in that province with t3 giants and clear them they drop 1800 do it at night they drop more the longer they havnt bin farmed. And you can clear them solo if u pull one at a time with t3....got 60k silver with my buddy and thats him taking alot of the loot too within 1hour
albiononline,2h5kvy,Maezren,4,Wed Sep 24 23:22:34 2014 UTC,"Not to mention the way the gearing system works. You have to wear/use gear and gather/make gear in order to even unlock the ability to wear/use/gather/make higher tiered gear. The only thing gold does at this point is offer you a real money option to skip the necessity of farming silver. Otherwise you still have to go out and effectively level up your capability in the game. You can't just show up, buy a bunch of T4 gear with gold and then whip up on some ass. You won't be able to equip it."
albiononline,2h5kvy,syrinaut,2,Mon Sep 22 20:29:15 2014 UTC,"As someone else pointed out, it's actually 10s per 1g. That means that you have the equivalent of 6k gold. Apparently 4500g is worth $20, so that means $1 nets roughly 225 gold (although you will probably get more gold per bundle. I'm guessing that it will be closer to 200g/$1.  But keep in mind that what gold will be useful for is buying and keeping land very early. You're not just paying for in-game currency; you're paying for the convenience of not having to acquire the in-game currency. It will allow for guilds to make huge claims, and alliances are going to snowball in this game until you have only a few really huge ones.  I don't have a problem with the gold because I just don't think it's going to affect the gameplay or stop it from being fun or make anything unfair. It IS going to affect the economy though. If it's carefully balanced, it won't matter too much."

Sure there were a few sad cases who dropped a lot of money to level up in a day by crafting or whatever, but apart from a fifteen minutes of fame forum post or two, no one really cared and they didn't really gain anything from it except being ahead for a couple of weeks until everyone else quickly caught up."
albiononline,2gupw6,kazh,3,Fri Sep 19 20:30:59 2014 UTC,Is it any different than buying items outside the game? Haven't people been buying and selling both items and services using real money since UO? Seems like the only difference is who gets the cash.  Now its not to say I am for this practice. I wish it never existed but it does. The makers of the game might as well be the ones to profit from the transaction.  I don't know much about the game but I do hope gear doesn't equal skill.

albiononline,2gupw6,Nvrnight,3,Fri Sep 19 14:22:13 2014 UTC,but thats a great reason why I will be playing this game. Some jack off spends his own loot which I in turn will acquire. Because while he is bank rolling his game with his cash I will be spending time learning to play the game with skill.

albiononline,2gupw6,MrNotSoNiceGuy,2,Sat Sep 20 06:21:15 2014 UTC,"Not necessarily. You can still be very competitive against those who buy gold. Mainly because a lot of the competitiveness come from Guild vs Guild action. Joe shoe and his 1000 gold means a lot less when he is in a group of 50. Or when he is fighting another group of 50 with their own guys that have gold. I foresee most gold users using it to pay upkeep or purchase land in cities. Not to buy a bunch of resources and spam away stuff. And even then, once they die once they lose it anyways. So that is a big factor. End of story, I think those that purchase gold will have an advantage when it comes to buying land and leveling a little faster. But it will be negligible and not amount to shit in GvG.   Besides, that is the price you play with a Free 2 Play."
albiononline,2gupw6,Aresmar,1 point,Fri Sep 19 23:31:14 2014 UTC,"The time when buying in-game gold will have the biggest effect is in the earliest stages of the game.  The reasons for this have already been stated.  In any case, this needn't be, as you put it:   Besides, that is the price you play with a Free 2 Play.   There are other ways to monetize games like this without introducing any P2W aspects.  Even a F2P game could be made profitable with good implementation of a micro-transactions system for cosmetics.  And then such a game could honestly claim to not be P2W."
albiononline,2gupw6,Aresmar,1 point,Sun Sep 21 03:07:12 2014 UTC,Well that is how it is. I am just telling you as I see it when I am playing. The gold is not amounting to anything unless you are trying to buy land in the cities.
albiononline,2gupw6,MrNotSoNiceGuy,-2,Sun Sep 21 18:43:08 2014 UTC,"There is a lot of things that restricts the ammount of pay2win tho. they cant buy the best items without beeing able to wear them, guilds will never sell top tier gear, if the best guild in the game is wearing tier5 items they wont be selling tier5 items, they might possibly sell tier4 items but thats about it, pay2win guilds will never have a chance against an actually good guild. Also the fact that they can put thousands of dollars into the game and will eventually loose everything, and will have to buy more shit again because he doesnt have high tiered crafting stations or just cant craft high tier items. They could spend thousands of dollars into a territory and then loose it all the next day because someone took over their territory. Anyways i like having real money involved overall, makes it more intresting, it works well in EVE online and makes the game overall way more exciting."
albiononline,2gupw6,WatermelonMerchant,3,Fri Sep 19 14:34:37 2014 UTC,They could spend thousands of dollars into a territory and then loose it all the next day because someone took over their territory.    They are less likely to lose their gear compared to f2p guild.
albiononline,2gupw6,Aresmar,1 point,Fri Sep 19 14:39:32 2014 UTC,Tier 5 can be beat by tier 4. Buying gold does not make you have any advantages at all besides being able to buy better gear.
albiononline,2gupw6,WatermelonMerchant,1 point,Fri Sep 19 23:32:57 2014 UTC,Did you even read my comment? We were talking about the advantage you gain by buying gold. STATISTICALLY SPEAKING They still have the advantage and you can't deny that.

albiononline,2gupw6,Aresmar,1 point,Sat Sep 20 21:58:58 2014 UTC,"It is easily overcame by simply playing a couple hours more.   That seems to be hyperbole.  And to the extent that it's hyperbole... is the extent to which players who can buy gold and focus less on economic skills will have an earlier military and political advantage.    If all a player had to do was mine or farm for two hours to be on an even level with the players buying gold... then the game's makers wouldn't be able to sell any gold and their monetization plan would fail.  Or they'd have to rely on a very few players who were purchasing a ridiculous amount of gold in order to gain an in-game advantage.  Either way, it's problematic."

The only issue I was having was not being able to afford plots in the cities because everyone bought them up with gold right away. Now they are all being sold for silver. Some of them at amounts I could still afford if I chose to buy a space in a city. However, I went straight into joining a guild and and kicking gold users butts on a daily basis."
albiononline,2gupw6,Cryptomeria,-2,Sun Sep 21 18:45:23 2014 UTC,"Pay2win guilds will never be a competition for the best guilds, best guilds will NEVER sell top tier items and put them self in danger, if top guilds are in T5 gear, they will only sell T4 gear and lower.

And I'd say it's highly debatable whether or not EVE's model would succeed as well if it were first introduced in today's market.

I'd be curious to know how many of those subscriptions are being paid by funds earned in-game (not actually bringing in real currency).  EVE trillionaires (who have been in it from the start) have incredible amounts of ISK and can undoubtedly by PLEX in-game for multiple accounts.  And how many are extra accounts being paid for with cash by established players?  If the latter is a large number then you'll still potentially be seeing the population of EVE declining.    I've had a hard time find* in-depth hard numbers* for such things.  So I can't really comment about how Eve's population is doing, how much fresh blood is coming in, or how much the game will be effected in the future by other monetization systems in newer games.  And it's a similar story with the other games you mentioned.  I'm sure all of these games have an interest in making their subscription numbers look as big as possible, but I don't know the details about such numbers or how long they'll hold up in a changing environment."

At sometime a player bought that PLEX for real money to sell.

Also these are the figures published the companies themselves from their share reports with jnvesters. Since it's pretty much illegal to lie about where your revenue comes from these are accurate. Also keep in mind the last time this was updated was 2013. Point is it proves Eve's subscriber numbers have steadily risen.

albiononline,2gupw6,MrNotSoNiceGuy,1 point,Fri Sep 19 22:08:38 2014 UTC,"Buying in-game currency is more problematic during the earlier periods of a game's release.  It's something which allows you to gain a strong foothold at the start while other players are grinding out skills which are less directly useful for military and political conquest.  So if you can buy a ton of in-game currency early on it will allow you to have many advantages that can make it much easier to establish yourself as a power player later on.    All other things being equal (in terms of time and effort put into the game), a player who buys a bunch of in-game currency at the start will have a serious head start advantage in terms of claiming territory and building a guild.  If you're ok with that, fine.  But don't pretend it's not a P2W element."

Just cast ""find <player X>"" Proceed to kill them. Every time they spawn, kill them again and again and again. No matter where they go you can always find them and grief them some more.   I remember on Tibia (which was bad) how people wouldn't be able to play anymore because of the amount of this sort of griefing and hunting. People had to make secret accounts and play without making any friends or telling anyone who they were. Even logging in 6 months later on their main character and trying to hunt somewhere would get people instantly hunted and killed.   If there isn't open world pvp, people can still grief. They can lure high level monsters or big groups onto you that you can't handle. They can simply kill everything that you attack so you never get any loot or exp. It makes the game incredible unfun when someone who doesn't like you can make your entire game experience a misery every time they see you online.   I thought it was a terrible idea the entire time I played that game. Sure it lets you hunt down botters / pks / scammers / clan enemies. But it also allows for serious amounts of griefing."

albiononline,2glh3y,Aresmar,1 point,Fri Sep 19 23:38:06 2014 UTC,"Ive got a guild called Black Cock (logo is a black rooster) and we're always open for more people. We dont zerg recruit like most guilds so we grow a bit slower but we're having tons of fun. Got a base in a PvP area, 18 members currently and we were all on teamspeak having fun all day yesterday.  We're from all over the world, theres swedes and aussies, so we're as international as it gets. If anyone feel like being part of an active teamspeak community and believe you have more fun playing games when theres a good social side to it they're more than willing to join up.  We're trying to have a guild that'll be able to share everything with eachother because no one will worry about someone not contributing since we all become friends via teamspeak :)"

albiononline,2gc9pk,Anni_Eve,1 point,Sun Sep 14 03:20:34 2014 UTC,"As a sandbox game, the goal of the game is to give you as many freedoms as you can. So you can be a crafter/gatherer if you want to be!  The main restriction of the game is that you really need a group (guild) to really do well. There is a mercenary system, but I am not sure how that will truly work."
albiononline,2gc9pk,WatermelonMerchant,1 point,Sun Sep 14 04:09:09 2014 UTC,"Almost everyone in Eve Online will tell you to join a corporation. That advice is repeated endlessly. But the truth is... you don't need to join a corporation and there are many things you can do without one. I don't know if AO will give as many options in the regard, but I think it may be something you'll have to look into yourself or wait for further reports. Play styles and options may develop which will suit different individuals."
albiononline,2gc9pk,VoodooPygmy,2,Sun Sep 14 06:14:15 2014 UTC,Almost everyone in Eve Online will tell you to join a corporation. That advice is repeated endlessly.   Same thing in Planetside 2. I personally like to play as a lone-wolf.
albiononline,2gc9pk,MrNotSoNiceGuy,1 point,Wed Sep 17 12:16:35 2014 UTC,"Yes to all the playstyles you mentioned. They are also trying to add in a mercenary system so if you don't want to be in a guild you can sell your services to guilds/people. I plan on spending most of my time hunting criminals and guarding caravans (Since there is no global auction house in this game, the transportation (and guarding) of resources and equipment will hopefully be a big thing)"

albiononline,2g2kid,J_ordan_B,3,Thu Sep 11 03:22:16 2014 UTC,"The main website talks about Merlin, Morganna, and a Great War so it looks like there will be some lore and it'll probably be heavily based on Arthurian legend."

To be honest - I'm sick of boring MMO storylines, full of ""ancient evil"" and tragic conflict, where only my character is the hero (yeah, and what about those other 100000 adventurers all around me?). I'd love to have a backstory for Albion Online, some sort of elaborate lore, but no traditional quest line - I just want a true sandbox experience, where players and their guilds shape the world around them :)"
albiononline,2g2kid,Adorecraft,1 point,Thu Sep 11 12:06:56 2014 UTC,Hopefully this kind of stuff will be driven by players.  It would be great if they peppered the world over with some literature and points of interest to establish some common continuity but please no quests where we all have to take turns being a sidekick to Gawain while Percy goes full Arthas.
albiononline,2g2kid,Philetic,1 point,Thu Sep 11 15:47:13 2014 UTC,"I had the same issue when looking into this game. My first thought was just to buy a founders pack after literally 5 minutes looking over the website. It's perfect for me. But I'm a super lore junkie, and this is all that's missing from the game it seems.   In their trailer they have talked about, they want the player to create their own stories (regarding quests). Which I can fully get behind, quests often become mundane and players loose interest in both the story and content of the quests, only completing them for the rewards they offer. I think Runescape has a brilliant questing system which I was hoping to see in this game as well but ah well.   I agree with J_ordan_B, like Skyrim this game would be perfect for having books, letters, journals etc around the world. This way they could add their own stories and lore tid-bits in the game. But also allow player to write their own stories which can be entered into the game, whether it's by a competition or just a book you can write in & store in your player-housing. I haven't played the game yet, but would love to see a deep lore side to it! :D"

albiononline,2fyj1l,Juzztn,2,Wed Sep 10 00:13:40 2014 UTC,"Disclaimer, I have never actually played this game.    That said, as far as I can tell, crafting will be an integral part of this game. Like eve online, nothing will be available to purchase  that a player has not made. Additionally, the process of building houses and some cities will be important as well. It is slightly different then crafting, but to build, you have to gather all the necessary resources."

albiononline,2ft6pw,Scoiatael,4,Mon Sep 8 16:04:31 2014 UTC,"I just hope they promote the game reasonably well.  You can have the greatest game in the world, but if you don't let people know about it in a timely and informative manner... it may go unnoticed."
albiononline,2ft6pw,NihiloZero,7,Mon Sep 8 18:55:30 2014 UTC,Because you have to buy into the alpha.
albiononline,2ft6pw,TheWorldisFullofWar,3,Mon Sep 8 16:17:05 2014 UTC,This is also my reason
albiononline,2ft6pw,kewidogg,1 point,Tue Sep 9 01:47:47 2014 UTC,"Thats an invalid argument, u had to buy into archeage alpha for 50% more than AO is asking, yet they had 10k+"
albiononline,2ft6pw,MrNotSoNiceGuy,2,Tue Sep 9 09:54:45 2014 UTC,I played archeage without paying. You seem to forget that archeage came out in other countries before the west. Albion is ONLY available with payment with no way to actually get a feel for the game.
albiononline,2ft6pw,TheWorldisFullofWar,-1,Tue Sep 9 14:00:13 2014 UTC,"The fact that Archeage happened to be released in other countries and you had to download a shitty english patch + proxy is an exemption, and playing in english wasnt even possible anymore because they patched it so the english patch dont work anymore. Archeage was just 1 example, i can name 10 other games right here and now with paid alpha access that had more reddit subscribers than what AO has atm, wich is what this topic was about. So your argument is STILL invalid."
albiononline,2ft6pw,MrNotSoNiceGuy,3,Tue Sep 9 19:50:46 2014 UTC,When I can play the game without paying for an alpha I'll be more inclined to talk about it
albiononline,2ft6pw,Florida_Boy,3,Tue Sep 9 03:21:50 2014 UTC,"There is not much for people to discuss when they cannot play the game yet. :) The official forums are quite active, with theories, questions and the like."
albiononline,2ft6pw,gM_Josh,2,Tue Sep 9 12:21:17 2014 UTC,The official forum is very active so there is not an incredible need for a busy subreddit as well... but when the time comes and the game grows I can see it spilling over to here.
albiononline,2ft6pw,MrNotSoNiceGuy,2,Mon Sep 8 17:14:24 2014 UTC,"The game have received 0 publicity, its still in alpha and there is not point to hype the game at this point, i had to do some serious digging before finding this game my self.   EDIT: I think the attention for the game will peak MAJORLY when it gets on steam, steam is very very good for publicity :P"
albiononline,2ft6pw,drofzz,1 point,Tue Sep 9 09:56:44 2014 UTC,"i've heard that http://www.twitch.tv/ellohime and http://www.twitch.tv/cohhcarnage, was gonna play it with a bunch of people soon, they both been talking about the game, both livestreamers has alot of attention, i am sure this games followers will blow up when twitch and youtubers are getting thair hands on it, however sandbox mmo's are a hard genre to put out there, just like WoW is controlling the Themepark mmo genre, so is eve online controlling the sandbox mmo genre.  however the audience IS out there, they just have to know about the game, and so they will, very soon, when the game gets more media attention."
albiononline,2ft6pw,MrNotSoNiceGuy,1 point,Tue Sep 9 07:00:45 2014 UTC,"I think it will blow up especially when it will hit Steam!

albiononline,2ft6pw,druska,1 point,Tue Sep 9 09:58:59 2014 UTC,"IMHO the answer is easy. No one has acces to the game at this moment.  It has nothing to do with buying the alpha. Once the game will be available at least to the guys who bought alpha and more prominent streamers/youtubers will start producing content, people will come.  For example look at /r/fortnite. Its the next big game from Epic Games with Unreal Engine 4, up comming alpha and it still has less subscribers. There is no reason to worry about the size of the community yet."
albiononline,2ft6pw,Juzztn,1 point,Tue Sep 9 16:15:22 2014 UTC,Its still early in this game's life. No big media coverage. I bet after this alpha things will start to pick up some.
albiononline,2ft6pw,indigo-alien,0,Wed Sep 10 17:25:18 2014 UTC,"I won't normally pay for any game until open beta comes around, and really, free keys to closed beta are normal.  Charging a 100 dollar bill for alpha access on a game that isn't even at alpha stage yet? That's quite a reach for any game developer."
albiononline,2ft6pw,VoodooPygmy,1 point,Tue Sep 9 19:06:01 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it's totally ridiculous. I liked it a lot more when game companies didn't give us any way at all to get alpha access to their products, options are such a terrible thing."
albiononline,2ft6pw,EntityOfSin,1 point,Tue Sep 9 23:18:20 2014 UTC,The game is already at an alpha stage. That alpha stage doesn't need to be 24/7 testing from its player base because there is such a thing as getting too much information from your product tests.
albiononline,2fssff,VoodooPygmy,2,Mon Sep 8 11:37:47 2014 UTC,"There is an autoattack, and each of your gear will provide abilities to be assigned a hotkey(some will be passive; no hotkey).  I would compare the number of hotkeys to LoL or other MOBA type games. The game is designed to be played on a tablet as well as PC/Mac so it will be fairly straightforward.  As of right now all abilties are target focused, as in you highlight an enemy, and your spell will hit that enemy."
albiononline,2fssff,Anni_Eve,1 point,Mon Sep 8 16:06:55 2014 UTC,"awesome, thx! As a guy dealing with some RSI issues, not having to click my mouse 5 times a second or make a weird stretch for that 48th hotkey is exactly what I'm lookin for in a PvP MMO."

And I'm glad I didn't, because I would be pissed by now. I hope Albion Online won't go that way and that the developers will keep their promises about the ""no p2w"" thing. I'm ok with a cash shop, as long as it contains cosmetics only (plus some quality of life items)."
albiononline,2fkqdg,Ajynn,2,Sat Sep 6 23:51:14 2014 UTC,"""Premium"" account status has me worried about AO as well."
albiononline,2fkqdg,yolosw3g,4,Fri Sep 5 21:19:23 2014 UTC,Paying ~$5 a month for getting a few things faster doesn't sound too bad if you want to pay or not. But I do hope they don't cut off major parts of the game like they did with farming and labor points with acreage.
albiononline,2fkqdg,druska,2,Fri Sep 5 23:14:26 2014 UTC,"Yeah the ""Premium"" account has me gotten worried too. I consider being able to farm more silver and progressing faster through the destiny board as P2W. The premium account allows a player to progress faster through the game and that really worries me. It's still hard to say what they will come up with in the end, but I really hope they wont screw up. I would like to see a similar F2P model to Valve games and if they plan on publishing the game on steam they should think about a steam inventory for cosmetics."
albiononline,2fkqdg,NihiloZero,1 point,Tue Sep 9 16:48:58 2014 UTC,"I think I am becoming more ok with it actually. It will be around $5 a month to keep premium. Since there is no subscription or initial cost; a ""soft"" subscription of $5 does not really scream unfair to people not wanting to pay anything.    ... unless of course the difference of income is so drastic that you can't buy anything... that would be uncool."
albiononline,2fkqdg,Flufferpope,1 point,Tue Sep 9 17:11:07 2014 UTC,"It's all such a fine line.  P2W can, actually, have a broad meaning if it is applied to any and every thing which might impact a players experience.  Anything beyond cosmetics is in question, but some things might not honestly be as bad as others."
albiononline,2fkqdg,whatafooliam,2,Fri Sep 5 21:54:44 2014 UTC,I'm one of many that asked for a refund i bought the archeum pack and when the game went p2w it just killed the game for me.

albiononline,2ezabn,Xtorting,3,Sat Aug 30 05:40:56 2014 UTC,"Our tests can only support X amount of active players, in case we reach that limit we will have to freeze alpha access for some time, a sandbox MMO is very dependent on the amount of players around you, too many or too few are both bad for the game play."

NO SUBSCRIPTION FEE.   There is however ""premium"" status which is essentially a subscription replacement, but not necessary at all to play the game."
albiononline,2eujlz,Anni_Eve,2,Thu Aug 28 21:08:43 2014 UTC,"Would your suggestion be, then, to stick merely with cosmetics?    I'm concerned that such a model might not work for every game depending upon the level and style of graphics.    And this concerns me because, so far, I really like the mechanics I've seen so far in AO.  I want it to become a successful game, but I'm concerned it will fade away if the developers can't adequately monetize it."

albiononline,2euiyy,Stavieguy,1 point,Thu Aug 28 19:01:47 2014 UTC,"Currently there is a few different helmets (and other gear) to choose from, and they can be brought to a max tier of 8.   Soloing is possible, but more difficult. Guilds (even small guilds are viable) are quite important, yes. The devs want to add in more options for solo players in the future.  About your last point, there is no ""levels"" per say. You are as good as the gear you wear. So in that aspect, there is no real comparison to the ""level 3 skiller"". It may be possible to craft and merchant without getting good gear, but gathering high level materials, or trading between towns could be dangerous."

albiononline,2e9lkn,anotchbelow,3,Sun Aug 24 08:21:18 2014 UTC,"Currently we are lacking in that department but I'm here to answer any and all questions you may have :)  Territory ownership comes in three forms:  Player cities:  Large cities which guilds are able to capture and fight over, they do not offer any building space for the owning guild, however they are full of real estate plots which normal solo players can live out of (and pay a tax to the owning guild)  Territories:  Territories are meant for guilds to claim and build up their own little village in, they are found in most PVP enabled regions of the world and will be the main interest of guilds  and Real estate:  A smaller plot of land meant for solo ownership, they differ in cost and size, a small estate can house a normal sized house and sometimes a workbench. A larger one could potentially house a couple of buildings.  Owning a real estate could be a great way to make money since you can charge people a usage fee for using your crafting buildings that you build on them"

Owning a real estate could be a great way to make money since you can charge people a usage fee for using your crafting buildings that you build on them.   Can you tell me how the ""usage fee"" will be determined?  For example, will it be a flat percentage of the products/value created at the crafting buildings or will it be an hourly charge or... what?  I like this idea but I'm wondering how it will be arranged so as to be worth the time for players to create crafting buildings that might then be used by other players."

If they were referring to last spring they probably would have said... ""this past spring.""  But that wouldn't make much sense in context of the question being asked.    There will be an open beta this spring.  Not this past spring, and not the spring after next, but this upcoming spring which will arrive after the winter season."
albiononline,2e6w31,Flufferpope,-10,Sat Aug 23 16:01:39 2014 UTC,"""This <season>"" means the upcoming season in the current year, not next year."
albiononline,2e6w31,bensku,5,Sat Aug 23 16:16:06 2014 UTC,"The word ""Will"" is future tense. This means something has not yet occurred. This spring could be used to demonstrate that it is this upcoming spring, and not the one after that. Next spring could mean, to different people, either, ""This upcoming spring"" or ""The spring after next"" so it is simply easiest to say ""This spring"" while specifying future tense so you know it shall occur in the future."

So we could relax and make food and do a bit of non-combat-related-crafting when we wanted to :) Also... Treasurehunting and Musicianship/Bards heheh I know, the scope is way too large, but still...

albiononline,2d7pag,Anni_Eve,1 point,Mon Aug 11 06:44:01 2014 UTC,"Hey!   1   The destruction of items, We used to have the exact same formula as EVE had where there was a 40% chance of items being destroyed on death, however people felt it was too punishing since compared to EvE it's quite easy to die.  So our new method is that the item loses 20-80% durability on death, meaning that a freshly made item with full durability is likely to not be destroyed and old items will probably get destroyed.   Items can be repaired which costs materials as well.  2   Not sure how you mean multiple players have a stake in guilds, do you mean how EvE has shares that players can trade? As far as i know that feature never got used so we have not looked more at it, am I wrong in this?   When it comes to actually access to guild resources that's more or less up to the guild leader to decide, there are guild ranks as in any MMORPG and with each rankes comes more rights, you are also able build chests and place in your house and decide the access rights to them, for example you could add your guild as either User or Supplier, a user is able to take stuff out while a supplier is only able to put stuff in.  3   You are able to set up a usage fee for your construction buildings, so if you put down a construction building in a player city other people could use it and you could charge them for it :) (Or you could make it private for you only)"

Items can be repaired which costs materials as well.   That works.     do you mean how EvE has shares that players can trade?    Definitely.  There is a market for publicly traded shares in in various player-created corporations.  And people who own shares can vote for CEO or other specific actions taken by the corporation.  And, of course, some of the profits from taxation can be divided up amongst shareholders -- the exact rate of both the tax and the distribution is set by the CEO.       so if you put down a construction building in a player city   What's to stop me from essentially putting down a building in any area?  In a ""player-owned city"" is it possible that I wouldn't be able to find a plot of land to build on?  Is it possible that the owners of a player city would refuse to sell to me?"
albiononline,2d7pag,Aresmar,1 point,Mon Aug 11 18:21:43 2014 UTC,"For your first point: When you die, everything is dropped. Some of your items immediately become trash with no use at all.  Second: Most guilds are currently following a sort of communist system. Almost all storage is public and everyone uses the resources gathered by everyone. Some guilds, when they become able, branch out with private housing and storage on guild lands. Third: Every single inch of the economy of this game is player driven. The large cities have three buildings (the bank, battle bank, and stable) and everything else (in most cases around 200 estates) is completely player made housing. This housing can be strictly private, public and free, or public with a usage fee that goes along with it. In the guild areas, all building can be used by those in the guild. Those allied with the guild may also use them for a price."

Sure you can level up or start using ships that require more skills but they aren't necessarily better than before. Same with old runescape, you could level up but that would restrict who you would be able to fight in certain sections of the wilderness.

There's always the argument ""You don't have to buy it"".  You're right!  But I also have the right to convince as many people as possible to wait until the product is shipped to buy it."
albiononline,2ciy2n,bro-away-,1 point,Mon Aug 4 15:27:03 2014 UTC,"Founder packs and kickstarter are both about funding the games development, you do realize that right?  ""in a genre where games shut down often"" Is even more of a reason to invest in it don't you think? Vote with your wallet and all?"
albiononline,2ciy2n,TheBlogger1,0,Mon Aug 4 18:33:07 2014 UTC,"I understand what you're getting at.  Do you understand you aren't actually ""investing""?  They have no risk in taking your money right now.  You get all the risk.  The product is coming according to this post and, if they need money to continue it, they should explain why they need $ now (a kickstarter pitch--or close to it).  Or put up a better product for sale (servers up daily).  I'm not saying they're evil (I know why they're doing it and why it's beneficial to them), I just think it's a terrible deal for a consumer.    The product will be there for you to throw money at later, most likely.  If you really will feel good throwing money at what is the worst gaming proposition I've seen, go ahead, it will help them and they'll never make easier money."

Stefan is actually our CEO :)  You can find his twitter at here https://twitter.com/StefanWiezorek where he usually posts some small tidbits about our development.

If then some guys comes a long and pays a bunch to look insanely cool that would kinda break the whole do everything by yourself style.

albiononline,1zn90e,jakesvapescom,1 point,Mon Mar 10 20:58:23 2014 UTC,I have a motley crew of blood thirsty men (6) that have been desperate for a full loot system. We recently started playing UO on a private server but sadly me and my friends were the only ones there.   I will be spreading the good word tomorrow as the game looks very promising. Props on having a good website. I have noticed that a lot of recent MMO's have not invested that much time into their site. Nice to see a very well spoken and involved dev team.
albiononline,1zn90e,jakesvapescom,1 point,Wed Mar 12 07:18:38 2014 UTC,Oh man I am debating if I should post the group text message that went on today. I never knew my friends were such devious people.  They are already planning on how to infiltrate other villages and lure poor targets into ambushes. One guy wants to fake his way to the top of a village and then open the doors so we can slay and loot. A good old fashion trojan horse.   Can we do this?  Are there mounts?
albiononline,1zn90e,jakesvapescom,2,Thu Mar 13 05:43:12 2014 UTC,"Heh sounds like a scary bunch of guys :P  Guild infiltrating have been done, in the last test two guilds who fought each other managed to infiltrate each other and give the spies siege weaponry to destroy each others bases.  Of course this lead to an effect of everyone running around smashing anything that was openly accessible, which is something we had to counter. Now you need to be a higher rank or the building owner needs  to allow other people to attack it (unless it's during a real siege)  But yes it's possible in theory to infiltrate another guild then work your way up the ranks and then disable the protecting force sphere if that's what you'd like to do   And no there are no mounts currently, an addition that might come after the real release as we have a lot of core features being working on :)   Good luck and happy hunting"
