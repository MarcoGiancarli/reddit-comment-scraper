Your ""payable"" amount is automatically transferred into your paypal account on either Wednesday or Thursday. Meaning that the money that transferred into the clickworker account yesterday/ today will become 'payable' on August 9th, and then will automatically transfer to your paypal on either the 12th or the 13th. However, an automatic transfer does not occur unless the 'payable' amount is over $5. That is why the $.55 is still in your account. Any money you make this week will be transferred from UHRS to Clickworker on Sunday, become payable 3 weeks after that (the 16th,) and will automatically transfer on the 19th or 20th."

WorkOnline,3e0i1o,tmn50,4,Tue Jul 21 00:39:46 2015 UTC,"Some clients take quite a while to decide on who they want to hire. I bid on a transcription job 3 months ago, and I was just contacted last week about starting a contract. The best advice I can give in the meantime is to be detailed in your bid and make your attributes shine. Highlight any experience you have in the subject and what accomplishments you've made. Once you've been accepted, see if the client will give you a good rating after the contract is over. Ratings are everything on freelance job sites.   Also, especially with transcription jobs, the rates are a big issue. I'm not sure what country you are from, but I've noticed that a lot of clients prefer the lowest bidder. There are some who will prefer the native English speaker, but some workers from places like India and Pakistan will charge such low rates that it is nearly impossible to compete with them. Keep an eye out for the clients that specifically indicate that they want a native speaker."

WorkOnline,3e0i1o,Tri0ptimum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:47:21 2015 UTC,"Do all the verifications - education, ID, and so on. Get the applications and check them and your email often, reply immediately to offers. I got a job in a few weeks doing transcription (US based) this way. It does take weeks / months for them to pick candidates sometimes, my job I applied for then didn't hear from them for weeks. Anyway, I got hired for a 6 months contract (and it just got renewed again) off the site shortly. I had 0 feedback, jobs, and so on, just verified ID and education (bachelors degree). I think verifying those and completing your profile and skill tests will help because your profile is new. Keep at it - there are a lot of junk jobs on there but lots of decent ones too. Good luck!"

WorkOnline,3dyftk,Namocol,9,Mon Jul 20 15:39:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can. I've had success on PeoplePerHour.com and oDesk (now Upwork) translating content from Portuguese to English, but there's not a lot of available gigs for that language pair. Spanish translations, on the other hand, have way more demand, so I think you should try that ASAP.   The great thing about knowing a foreign language is that you can not only translate, but transcribe. I recently made 75 dollars for a job that took me about 6 hours, and the best thing is that I got invited for the job, I didn't even need to apply.  As for your wife, she can write on iWriter.com. The writer gets $2.43 for a 500-word article in the beginning, and after 25 reviews, if you have a rating over 4.1 stars (it's doable), you jump to something around $5 for a 500 word article.

Wouldn't it make sense if you lived in Venezuela to fly to Miami, buy one iPad, Apple laptop, and iPhone, fly back to Venezuela, and sell it on the black market for like 8x it's value?   I heard that well off citizens there pay top dollar for high quality electronics. Since you only have one each, they won't be confiscated at the airport. You can claim them as personal.  The amount you sell each device for would more than cover the cost of the flight, right?   Just a question that I've been meaning to ask a Venezuelan native."
WorkOnline,3dyftk,sejope,7,Mon Jul 20 16:38:44 2015 UTC,"As zeroedout666 said plane tickets are WAAAY expensive here, because since the government isn't giving the airline tickets money, they're basing their prices in the black market dollars.  To expand a little bit on how the system works here. There are four different exchange rates in the country:  6.5 Bs/dollar, heavily subsidized, this one is meant for priority things like food and medicine. Whoever gets access to this one is handled at the government discretion, they keep it so low to try to prevent prices for goods and services from going up and increase inflation (it isn't working, we're expected to hit over 150% inflation this year).  12 Bs/dollar, meant for importing things of a lower priority, traveling (more on that later) and buying on the internet (you can use up to $300 a year).  199.99 Bs/dollar, the “free market” one, for everything else.  600 Bs/dollar and rising, the black market one, also known as the Cucuta Dollar, since the price is set by the currency exchange houses in Cucuta (Colombia), and also known as green lettuce because the government banned for a while its mention in TV, radio and websites, so they started talking about the price of the green lettuce (dollars) and european lettuce (euros).  Traveling abroad and buying products to sell here is something some people do, and it’s perfectly legal, but not as much as before. When you traveled you could apply to use the 12 Bs/dollar exchange rate, up to 3000 dollars (2500 by credit card, 500 cash), but since people were using it to make money they lowered the amount so now we’re allowed only up to $700 a year (if you stay 8 days or more, less money if you stay less days) to travel anywhere within the US or Canada and most of the americas, you’re expected to pay everything in your travel with that amount (transportation, hotel, food and so on), plus the pane ticket that can cost several hundreds of thousands of Bs. The price of the device would cover the cost of the flight, but that would mean you might not get enough money at the preferential rate (without buying at 199.99) as you need to stay for at least 8 days to get the full amount.  What some people do is to pay someone that creates a fake plane ticket (you need to have purchased a plane ticket to apply for access to the dollars) and travels with several passports and credit cards (you’re supposed to give both to that person) and use the credit cards in some stores that will give you a receipt and the money in cash in exchange for a percentage of the transaction… I personally know several people that do that… but it is illegal, if the person that does the traveling is caught he could go to jail, and whoever gave him a credit card and passport gets them suspended, have to pay a fine (return any money made plus pay 4 times the amount of dollars used in the credit card) and is banned for life to have access to foreign currency and from having a credit card again.  Technically it isn't illegal to sell or even buy dollars at the black market rate... what can be illegal is how you obtain them in the first place."

WorkOnline,3dikj1,BlindDevelopment,2,Sat Jul 18 03:19:26 2015 UTC,I work for leapforce and can make approx $540 a week for 40 hours before taxes.  I don't normally work a full 40 unless I need extra some month or to fill in some gaps if other work slows but there are a lot that do it regularly.

WorkOnline,3dikj1,LacroixMusic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:02:20 2015 UTC,Made $166.45 so far this week.  7.82 hours spent working.  Doing Clickworker for over a year now.
WorkOnline,3dikj1,LacroixMusic,2,Fri Jul 17 00:43:24 2015 UTC,By clickworker do you mean UHRS or clickworker specifically? Because I've been on clickworker maybe 10 times and made 10 cents.
WorkOnline,3dikj1,pakidude17,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:46:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry, yeah UHRS. I've never tried any of the actual Clickworker tasks."
WorkOnline,3dikj1,LacroixMusic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:04:38 2015 UTC,Can I ask which hitapps you frequent most? I'm guessing the search battles
WorkOnline,3dikj1,blt88,2,Fri Jul 17 03:08:28 2015 UTC,Anything that's atleast .04 cents a hit. I honestly don't do the search battles even though I should. Just can't seem to figure them out.
WorkOnline,3dikj1,LacroixMusic,0,Fri Jul 17 03:53:16 2015 UTC,What is a clickworker?
WorkOnline,3dikj1,Danzo3366,4,Fri Jul 17 01:09:48 2015 UTC,One who works for clicks.
WorkOnline,3dikj1,LacroixMusic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:45:15 2015 UTC,Microjob website. Check out the sidebar to the right there is a bunch of useful information on it.
WorkOnline,3dikj1,Danzo3366,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:05:14 2015 UTC,Sounds like the easiest job in the world. I imagine it doesn't pay much tho but hey anything to pay extra gas money.
WorkOnline,3dikj1,LacroixMusic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:10:28 2015 UTC,It's not a bad situation.  I'm over $20 an hour this week but it varies on how fast of a worker you are.  The biggest problem is there isn't much consistency with it.
WorkOnline,3dikj1,Stuhhloner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:03:59 2015 UTC,"So a set guarantee wage isn't possible it seems like. Correct me if I'm wrong, but there isn't any benefits as well like 401k or health insurance?"
WorkOnline,3dikj1,boblo1121,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:15:40 2015 UTC,Not for UHRS work. And definitely no further benefits for the worker. Most of the time your considered an independant contractor and have to pay self-employment taxes as well.
WorkOnline,3dikj1,Sporkalorks,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:15:20 2015 UTC,UHRS 5.75 hours $60 so far this week. Been slow but Wednesdays always have good hits.

WorkOnline,3dikj1,COKeefe88,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:13:42 2015 UTC,"UHRS. Anywhere from 100$ a week upwards of $500 when it's at it's peak. Usually can do $300.  My average working salary is somewhere around 15$ and I spend anywhere from 1hr-4hrs a day doing it.  For a better idea, I saw 1.2k in a little shy of a month. Around 25 days. I was paying VERY close attention to it though, 2nd monitor, tab open and refreshing multiple times a day, and working on mobile when I was away from my PC.  Not rich, nor much a salary for decent independent living, but it's a nice supplement/part-time gig."
WorkOnline,3dikj1,T1D4Keto,0,Fri Jul 17 06:47:32 2015 UTC,About $150. Spend maybe 3-4 hours working

WorkOnline,3dke4q,Sporkalorks,2,Fri Jul 17 12:35:26 2015 UTC,"I advise you hold onto the account until they respond. If they take more than a few days, hit them up on Facebook.  Odds are it's something on their end they have to do so you can access it. Try adding your phone number to your profile and verify it as well as take all the available assessments. English one may count towards the UHRS one. Otherwise, I'm not sure."

WorkOnline,3deymz,cardinalcrzy,3,Wed Jul 15 19:15:14 2015 UTC,Most likely its bugged. I've been trying to take the qualification test since it first appeared on my dashboard. It sucks because from the guideline it looks like an easy Hit.
