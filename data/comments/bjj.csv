bjj,3e2o2o,shamilsultanakhmedov,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:53:51 2015 UTC,How's training at unity? Is it very hard training every day or are there slower days? I can't see them taking it easy for a day.
bjj,3e2o2o,Oosnow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:06:29 2015 UTC,"I've been training there for 3.5 weeks now (I'm here for holidays). I've been fasting for the whole period ( Ramadhan, so no drinking and eating) and I couldn't break the fast during training. There were days where I trained in the afternoon, and then had a break and went for the 08:00pm class where I could break the fast at around 08:30, but for most of the time I took the 0630-0800 classes which meant no water at all. It was hard, but I'm used to it. Now since ramadhan is over i started taking the noon classes, and I can honestly tell you this is 10x worse and harder than anything else. I was about to die. Murilo turns off the A/C and shuts the windows to take us out of the comfort zone, it was so wet and slippery it looked like it rained and we could barely breath.  So yeah, the noon classes are hell, but it'll sure as hell make you tougher. Not all the trainings are hard though, sometimes we would start off with a Q&A session and then work a lot on techniques, some classes are hard drilling and hard sparring/king of the hill stuff etc. It's balanced in my opinion. I will go to MG's for a month after next week because my wife's there and I promised her to join her."

bjj,3e3al2,StephanKesting,3,Tue Jul 21 17:03:52 2015 UTC,No hand control when he stands up... Can someone explain how to do this without getting swept?
bjj,3e3al2,RuinedDoorknob,4,Tue Jul 21 18:04:32 2015 UTC,"Marcelo Garcia does something similar.  I think it's a couple of things... 1) you're anticipating the backwards push, so your posture and weight distribution is anticipating it. 2) you're anchored to him with the other grip, so if he starts pushing you backwards you pull his body towards you, which kills his power 3) For most (but not all) sweeps he needs to unlock his ankles.  As soon as he does this you push his leg all the way to the floor, thus killing the sweep.  Like I said, Marcelo does this both in gi and no gi.  IIRC he typically puts his left hand on his opponent's left knee and his right arm behind his back to open up the legs.  Since Bernardo trains with Marcelo it's not surprising that they share some commonalities"
bjj,3e3al2,byronsucks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:39 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I noticed too - thought that was a bit strange considering how Marcelo opens from standing.
bjj,3e3al2,nicoic,4,Tue Jul 21 18:36:36 2015 UTC,"from what ive watched on the mendes bros website, they just grab the belt with both hands and jump up to standing with both legs.  They do so without controlling a sleeve and without traditionally stepping one leg up at a time.  Likely a reason for why he's not grabbing the sleeves in today's competition scene....   Maybe because it lets the guard player set up the spiderguard first by matching the grips? I noticed in Andre Galvao's episode of 'rolled up', Andre does something which does not allow the person to step up one leg at a time.  Maybe this has something to do with it.  Since I've adopted this style of passing the closed guard (grabbing the belt, jumping up with both feet instead of doing one foot at a time) I don't get tired and I have had a lot more success passing the closed guard.  If my opponent gets sleeve happy, THEN I will pass the sleeve to the other hand and continue passing."
bjj,3e3al2,byronsucks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:51 2015 UTC,Interesting - I'll give it a whirl
bjj,3e3al2,fatmiletich,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:55 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, if you're not going to control one of your opponent's arms, you have to be very careful to avoid the idiot sweep. To be successful, a few factors come to mind.  Factor #1: Posture  Any time you attempt a standing guard break, posture is incredibly important. You don't want to lean too far forward with your upper body, allowing your opponent to re-establish grips on your collar or lapels. You also don't want to lean back quickly, allowing your opponent an opportunity to unbalance or sweep you. Movements should be controlled and deliberate. Be mindful anytime your head cross over your body's vertical centerline.   Factor #2: Weight Distribution  While similar to posture, weight distribution is also essential for standing guard passes. As you stand, you want to shift your weight slightly forward, putting pressure on your opponent. Keeping weight on him until you are ready to reach back and break the guard is very important. Don't allow him the opportunity to shift his weight to the top of his shoulders. Marcelo Garcia's posture and use of weight are good examples in this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032wIsVv0hY  Factor #3: Stance/Leg Placement  Proper leg placement is crucial if you are trying to defend against a potential sweep. If you choose a stance closer to your opponent, keep your front leg tight to your opponent's hip and drive pressure inward with your knee. You may also opt to stand up at less of a 90 degree angle, like Marcelo Garcia shows in the above video. In this case, you would bring your legs back and out of range of your opponent. Although it's obviously different than Farias' pass, JT Torres teaches a guard break with excellent tips on leg placement if you'd like to stand up straighter: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfwRPR83ViY"
bjj,3e3al2,MilkChugg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:27:14 2015 UTC,Was curious about this as well.  I can't see myself pulling this off without them immediately going for my ankles.
bjj,3e3al2,nicoic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:35 2015 UTC,"I imagine his base is unbelievable and he is doing something (Perhaps pulling the guy up so he can't generate power with his hips?) to take away from the power of the lumberjack sweep, and has adjustments to make if they really go for it."

bjj,3e2vw2,TheLapHog,3,Tue Jul 21 16:54:17 2015 UTC,"IBJJF is the worst-- every time I watch one of their matches it drives me crazy, which is my own fault. Burns has a tight body lock then slams Diniz directly into side control, but because it's right outside the mat boundary they restart in the center with Burns losing the position and only getting an advantage for his troubles. Then Diniz stalls the rest of the match without penalty. A terrible waste of talent."
bjj,3e2vw2,trustdoesntrust,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:05:49 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with you but i THINK in this case it happened because the ref stopped the match before the throw (but I can't clearly tell).

bjj,3e2rkm,gunslinger_006,3,Tue Jul 21 15:50:55 2015 UTC,It won't take a couple years.  After 6 months-1 year you'll have a ton of useful knowledge if you've kept a good attitude.  The time will pass before you know it.  Then you'll be the guy that sees the cocky wrestler kid come in to the gym with his tv training who you know won't be returning for day 2 regardless and humble the shit out of them.  Also I suggest the Cesar Gracie DVD series.  it gave me a massive head start as a white belt.  He's an amazing instructor.  Pay attention to the basics of posture and all that good stuff.

bjj,3e2rkm,legy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:35:09 2015 UTC,"Yup. I'd be interested to hear from black belts/instructors to see if this is the case, but I assume they're not watching ""who taps who"" when looking at how people are advancing but rather technique, taking risks, trying to apply new things, etc.  And you're absolutely right. Once I abandoned my ego of not wanting to get tapped, I have a lot more fun trying new stuff rather than just (trying to) holding my guard for 3 minutes."
bjj,3e2rkm,bjjbabie,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:12 2015 UTC,"I have a pretty good guard, being rather small and not very strong I end up in guard a lot. Or well at least I use to. I still rely on it but I have focused my game else where to expand past it. But when I first started at 15 that was all I could do because everyone else was way bigger then me XD.   But yeah I don't want to get tapped. I like winning but there is a lesson that comes from getting tapped which is ""What escape did I miss? What defense did I not use? Was there a sweep? Did I give up a limb on accident?"" You know those things are better to have to answer during training than a competition or ever worse a real fight that threatens your life."

How to relax and breathe when another guy is sitting on top of you and trying to pull your arm off (in a friendly way).

bjj,3e2rkm,oAkimboTimbo,2,Tue Jul 21 18:10:54 2015 UTC,"Just go in and have fun. Relax, breathe deeply, and tap if you're going to panic. It's about getting comfortable and learning the basics right now (positions, how to frame, how to move your body in every direction from every position, etc). Be patient with yourself, and try to look back after a month or two to see your progress. It's easier to see progress after small chunks instead of each training session.  Setting small goals is also very helpful. Things like ""try to escape side control once today. try to sweep from guard. try not to get swept from guard."" and so on. Welcome to the club!"

bjj,3e2r84,FistOfPopeye,10,Tue Jul 21 14:51:14 2015 UTC,"You have every right to find the place that suits you best and there is nothing wrong with trying out other gyms. Don't make a big deal of it or announce your intentions (if your coach is sensitive, some coaches don't care if you roll at other places) and if you make a decision, just approach your coach and tell him what's going on.  Be polite, don't burn bridges.  One of two things will happen: he will say okay, understand and you will part amicably.   OR  He will be an asshole and you will know it was the right decision to leave."
bjj,3e2r84,chokingmn,5,Tue Jul 21 15:14:28 2015 UTC,"There's no easy way to tell someone you'd rather train somewhere else. Of course you hope he's going to be cool about it, but it's still rejection. Be sure about your plan to jump before you jump. Take some classes at the new place. Be certain the people, coaches, and facility are a good fit for you. Once you are sure, just be honest with your coach. He might be chapped, but time can heal that wound as long as you are a stand-up guy when you split. One thing to think about --  there are often challenges associated with joining a new team with color around your waist. Generating rapport, earning trust can take time. Some students on your new team may be cynical regarding your loyalty. Good luck bro."

When you talk to him, don't pussy-foot around. Just the facts. ""I checked out a different school, I found it's a very, very good fit for me, and I'm going to start training there. I wanted to tell you because I respect you as a person and a teacher."" Leave it at that. Don't get sucked into a conversation about why you're leaving, not being challenged, etc. because that's prob not going to go over well. It's not an easy conversation to have, man. Just get through it and move on. Be cool whenever you see him, speak well of him when others ask. If he still acts shitty then it's on him, not you."

Larger classes? If yes, it sounds like you should just be honest with your current instructor (as unfun as I'm sure that will be) and move to the gym where you will be challenged."
bjj,3e2r84,giantoreo,3,Tue Jul 21 14:54:26 2015 UTC,"I honestly had a very similar conversation with a good friend of mine recently, except he is you, rather than myself. I also spoke to a purple from another gym several hours away (she and her coach dropped in while on vacation), and they both echoed that even though I'm not on his skill level, I'm still doing him good.  My advice is to work on the things you're ""bad"" at (or not as good) when rolling with lower belts. Put yourself in bad positions and get out of them, for example. Start in side control, for example. Work on regaining guard and then submitting.  Drop in over at the other place now and again, as it's really nice to get new people to roll with."

I just walked out the door and didn't come back.  Nobody really cared, although I heard he said that he wished I had spoken with him... but all he would have done is try to con me into staying.  At this point I won't be leaving my gym even if it tanks, I'm lucky enough to get to travel and train at other places, but if I was going to, I would talk to them about it because I have been with them for almost 5 years now.  I know BJJ has honor and respect vs your responsibilities to a weight room membership, but unless you trained for free the entire time you've been training, you decide how to leave.   It's not a big deal."

bjj,3e2r84,staticfocus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:51:01 2015 UTC,Went thru a similar thing. Place where I started for over two years had very small class sizes. Limited training partners. Felt like for a 3-6 month period was just going thru the motions.  Switched to a bigger gym. Took a good 6-8 weeks to feel adjusted. But if you are like me you will enjoy the daily beatings that are bestowed upon you. No regrets.  I did not make a big fuss over it. Never bad mouthed or spread any word of my intentions to leave to anyone. Sent them a thank you note and that I will no longer be training there.
bjj,3e2r84,BJJ_899,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:18 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound like a case of blue belt blues at all to me. Seems like a completely reasonable reason to change gyms.     What also shocks me is how you said ""I have no bjj friends"" is your gym really that small? It seems the majority of people that start BJJ end up making acquaintances at least, if not friends, with some of their training partners. Seems like even more reason to change gyms , lol.     Why don't you just tell him what you told us? You don't feel like you are being challenged enough and it is effecting your love for the art."
bjj,3e2r84,BJJ_899,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:06 2015 UTC,"That is a very similar position to where I am. I am the only 20 something and very high ranking judo, with a bjj blue belt. I just don't have bodies to train with, and besides my coach, I usually sub or gain position on everyone. Recently i have just been lacking the motivation, so i will just give up position and let people do whatever they want. I had a long talk with my coach, and he is all for me training outside the dojo. But I could never up and leave altogether if i still live in the area. Especially with his wealth of knowledge of the arts. He suggested changing my training style to give up bad positions and work out of them. Pass guard, then let them reguard, then pass, reguard, let them sweep, work on your reguard or escaping being on bottom, maybe look for a sub, let them get out, etc.  Training outside your original school is great and I am sure your coach will be fine with it, but imho, it would be a good idea to stick with at least one class a week at your original school, especially considering everything your coach has done for you."

bjj,3e2r84,ravvitskeetballs,2,Tue Jul 21 18:05:07 2015 UTC,I second this approach. If you are at the top of the bunch then you can still grow through mentoring and sharing what you know with the white belts. They say you don't truly learn (insert anything) until you start to teach it.

bjj,3e1ub0,amarr334,10,Tue Jul 21 17:06:45 2015 UTC,Got choked out by a loop choke last night my training partner didn't feel me tap. Had a quick dream that I was running from something. Woke up and I was doing this on the floor. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJBKyTfCjCc
bjj,3e1ub0,cookmesome,5,Tue Jul 21 12:27:39 2015 UTC,"While practising the bow and arrow (with thigh on shoulder for added pressure variation), I already felt the pressure as my partner held onto my lapel. That means I was blacking out before he even got his leg over my shoulder.  I wanted to be polite so I waited for him to complete the whole technique. I remember tapping, but the next thing I knew, time warped and I felt as though I was just waking up from something. At first I was in the bow and arrow, and suddenly, like lag in a first-person shooter, I was suddenly lying on the ground.  I don't know when, but sound disappeared, and was starting to come back. It re-established itself much like how super huge turbines would crawl from stationary to full speed. I don't know why, but everytime I recover from a deep choke, the first auditory cue I get is the choppy sound of fans rotating slowly.  Because I tapped, my partner probably didn't know anything was amiss, and was waiting for me to get up and drill again.  I just stayed there and said, ""Dude, I think I just got choked out.""  He laughed and said, ""Natural high, bro.""  Kinda had to agree with him. It wasn't unpleasant at all."

I could swear I tapped but one second I was starring at the wall, the next I'm looking up at my training partner and instructor from the floor. I heard that same ""whump whump whump"" sound and my mouth felt gritty. Everything tingled and felt cold. I tried to get right up to keep drilling but they laughed and made me relax for a few.   Tl Dr - brown belts have pretty solid bow and arrow technique. Tap early or take a free nap."
bjj,3e1ub0,argunaw,5,Tue Jul 21 19:36:10 2015 UTC,"Yup, at one of my first blue belt tournaments in the nogi division. I shot in for a single with my head on the outside and was guillotined. I thought I was escaping, but sure enough, I woke up face down on the mat. The ref didn't even come to turn me over and shake my legs to wake me up! He did, however, stand on the other side of the mat and yell to me ""You went unconscious!"". Worst tournament experience thus far, haha."
bjj,3e1ub0,RxMoreCowbell1,4,Tue Jul 21 15:22:05 2015 UTC,"One of our brown belts was teaching class when our instructor was in Brazil. He was showing 4 details to tighten the cross-collar choke from mount. As he was going through them I normally would've tapped after he applied the first 2, but he let up a little as he was explaining so I thought that I could just eat the pressure so he could keep teaching. All I remember after that was being overcome by the feeling of just waking up and stretching in my bed on a weekend day (just really relaxed and stress-free), but when I saw the rafters of the gym I realized that I wasn't in my room and still on the mats. First thing I did was check my pants to make sure I didn't piss myself."

bjj,3e1ub0,Dizzle85,2,Tue Jul 21 12:55:41 2015 UTC,Why would you be telling someone to hold a choke after they're out? That seems pretty bad practice.
bjj,3e1ub0,FistOfPopeye,3,Tue Jul 21 13:59:21 2015 UTC,"That's not me on the left, but I have no problem with how it was done.  The choke was applied with low pressure. It only takes a 20% cut in blood flow to cause unconsciousness, and the choke would have to be held for a hell of a lot longer to do any lasting damage to the brain.  As the video states, it was for charity, and the donations were dependent on him being completely out. He was very clear that he wanted to be rendered fully unconscious and so the 3 seconds was added so he didn't insta-recover."
bjj,3e1ub0,gunslinger_006,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:08:30 2015 UTC,"There was a paper posted here recently that showed the occlusion of the external carotid arteries needed to cause loss of consciousness was a lot more, it was 50% at least...but how occlusion translates to total blood flow loss is not something I am equipped to say.  20% may be the right number for blood flow.  I'll try to find it again."
bjj,3e1ub0,FistOfPopeye,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:42 2015 UTC,"I have to concede that my source for the 20% number is an episode of 'Sports Science', and on review its actually 15%.

bjj,3e1ub0,gunslinger_006,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:21:57 2015 UTC,"I found it:  http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2012/4/6/2929371/university-of-calgary-rear-naked-choke-study-VNR-police-research-explains   The carotid artery measurements showed that 70% of their right arterial blood supply to the brain was stopped and 40% of their left arterial blood supply was stopped. For the other twenty, the figure was roughly 80% in both arteries.   Its 80% total occlusion.  So if you close off one side of the external carotid's completely, and the other side only 30%, they are going out."
bjj,3e1ub0,Dizzle85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:24:29 2015 UTC,"Holding it for any length of time after he goes out is a risk, it's fine he agreed to it, and I've no doubt that people training with you let go as soon as a tap happens, but the consequences of anything going wrong because someone told them not to let go of the choke are pretty serious, not least someone being involved because an authority figure told them to hold a choke and they listened when they obviously tried to let go when they felt the person go out.  I'm not disputing how long it would take to cause lasting damage, but things go wrong unexpectedly and someone having a bad reaction to being choked out a few seconds too long isn't unheard of. Telling someone to hold a choke after the person goes out is opening both the person doing the choke and the person that told them to hold it up to a world of awful consequences. Again, i'm not calling into question your teaching or how you run things, and doing this for charity is a cool idea, but people being instructed to hold chokes a bit too long is imo a bad practice."

So, I wanted to wait a second to hear what he was saying. Apparently my hand came up to tap, then fell on the floor. I shook and snored while I was out. It felt like walking up from a nice nap. One of my training partners, who is a doctor, was standing over me checking to see that I could breath (the snoring made him worried...) The best part, it's on video on another training partner's cell phone. Worst part, I didn't train anymore that day."

You can imagine that had something to do with it, being a young man who was in shape and still had lots of ego left. I knew I was going out, but all the gears were in motion by the time I finally tapped and she released.   The scary part is I lost my hearing when I woke up. I gradually started hearing weird 80s synth type sounds as it came back, but full hearing returned in a minute or two. It definitely helped me learn to just fucking tap and not worry about losing."

The music (we rolled with music) started getting quieter and quieter and I started getting tunnel vision - realized something was wrong and tapped. I tap early now.  Since then, I learned nogi baseball choke and had multiple people pass out on me multiple times.

Having said all that, I tapped yesterday to a choke that I thought was a blood choke. I could breathe find but the pressure was on and I was thinking 'I'll just pass out before I feel it.' I tapped and told him too.  But never been choked out at all. I'm sure it will happen sooner or later."

He hit a head snap then transitioned to an anaconda and I was out before he rolled. I remember coming to wondering why all these people where in my room staring at me. The second time I was defending a collar choke and I remember thinking man this is tight but I'm OK. Then I was out. I came to with my feet being held up and my coach rubbing my chest. Good times.

Typically, we all get that tingling feeling or that feeling we are being choked before tapping but I felt totally safe. It wasn't a matter of being stubborn as we tap each other all the time.  As I was trying to get my back to the mat I went to sleep.    He asked me why I didn't tap and I told him I didn't realize he had the choke on and we laughed about it and kept training."

I'm not used to cage takedowns at all and some guy who is known at the gym for being good with guillotine puts me in a really tight one because I left my head in a bad position. I tried fighting out of it for a few seconds.  By the time I tapped he let go and I was on my knees.  My whole body was tingling.  Felt pretty awesome actually.   Put one dude kind of unconscious one time.  I say kind of because I put him in an Ezekiel and he was fighting for a few seconds but suddenly he goes from all out fighting to completely limp so obviously I let go.

Once upon a time, when I was much younger and partying a lot, some friends and I took some X. In the middle of it someone got the bright idea to try the ""passing out game"" that kids do. Being incredibly inebriated, I agreed to go first. I'll never forget coming to consciousness lying limp in a dirty hallway with a gaggle of faces looking down at me. I couldn't recognize them and they were speaking but I couldn't understand anything they were saying. Most importantly, I remember realizing that I was incredibly fucked up, but I had no idea why. It was mind blowingly disorienting. This sensation only last for, at most,  2 seconds before what I can only describe as a rushing flood of awareness hit me. Oh. That's J and B standing over me, and we're in S's dirty ass hallway doing drugs and trying the passing out game. And we all took a bunch of X. Weird.   It wasn't a bad feeling, just weird.

I could see the clock at 8 seconds so I decided to try to see if I could make it. My justification was that it was competition training time, so let's see if I understand my body's cues as well as I think. Well, just about 0:01, things started to feel really disembodied but I was still self-aware and conscious of what was going on when I noticed my legs were twitching and convulsing up and down by themselves. It was really odd, but then the buzzer went and he let it go. I think I was probably 90% out (whatever that mean s), but I immediately sat up and told him it was ""close, real close."" :)"

Each time I was defending hard and was gassed, so the already low O2 in my blood didn't help matters any.  Waking up is always fun. After the brain reboots there is a moment or two of ""fuzziness"" and confusion.  I remember thinking ""something is wrong,  I need to goto the ER"".

I was a white belt at the time and rolling with a purple belt, though this purple is super nice and really technical. Doesn't rely on strength, this choke just came on so mean....    Anyways, he just passed my guard to side control and I saw him setting up grips for a switchblade. He went for the sub and I brought my hands up answer the phone and buy a few seconds to hopefully spin out of it. Not quite what happened....    Next thing I know the same purple belt is holding my legs up and I remember my legs were just kind of spazzing around haha, I looked around and felt pretty confused but quickly put together what happened.    There was no tapping early on this choke, unless you would have tapped when you saw him setting up the grips. Went from 0% choke to 100 really friggen quick haha. Never had a choke come on so quickly before, he nailed that technique lol."

Apparently he thought he killed me and had a look of panic on his face haha.  I've choked my partner out before too, coincidentally with a baseball bat choke too.

I doubt there's a waiver strong enough to protect that gym and its proprietors from the foreseeable danger they are flirting with.  As for the rest, I have mixed feelings about hazing rituals.  When I was in the navy, I stubbornly refused to participate in its ""time honored"" traditions in part because I had close to zero freedom and when I was told I finally had a choice, I exercised that choice, much to the dismay of almost everyone around me.  Many years later, however, and I have to say that I participated and enjoyed my gauntlet experience for blue, but we didn't have one when I got purple (not sure why -- sometimes we do it, sometimes we don't).  As for black belts, no, I've never seen a gauntlet for new black belts at the University (although I have seen them subjected to a tough shark tank in which Saulo jumps in last!)."

And honestly, if a place did that and you wanted to opt out of it, I think they wouldn't make you because it's terrible PR for that to get out.  I took a crazy belt beating bare skin for my purple belt and part of me is kind of into the hazing.  But when I was having it done, at a certain point I was actually concerned that I might be getting real injury.   Personally, I'd prefer to see the tradition go away or be replaced with some other form of hazing.  Nobody should dread getting their belt.    Edit:  Here's my beating  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKEFovEnJ8c  As you can see, I started off pretty manly but things sort of degenerated after each pass...  My original intent was to walk it slowly without showing pain.  It actually really does build team spirit and can be a fun experience, but nobody should have to do it if it's going to be something negative for them."

No Great Depression. Our Great War’s a spiritual war… our Great Depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won’t. And we’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off.”  ""Our generation feel they should be rewarded just for tidying their room or leaving the house, turning off the video games or going for a walk... Achievement unlocked - go back to sleep.  The discordance I saw inside my friend was ""Eating the bread of shame"", he was just a taller, fatter version of himself at 9 years old with all the supposed luxury and privilege of a settled life. He had no rites of passage, no trial by ordeal, no cause greater than himself and professionally sat at a place earning a pension that looks increasingly like it won't matter by the time he comes to claim it.  We were warriors by birth, years of brutal exertion, bravery and commitment was the price of feeling entitled to old age in front of the fire and getting fat. Now we are a generation of spiritually and physically fat and old men at age 20 wondering what this nagging feeling at the back of our collective heads is.  You haven't done anything. We haven't done anything. Short of military service or a committed effort to travelling what could you tell your grandchildren that they'd care for?

If they made you go survive out in the woods for week, yes maybe that would be something.  Or if you're taking a beating to protect someone else from harm, then maybe.    But if you're just acquiescing to a whipping because everybody else is doing it and you're afraid to be the one to challenge it (or because you really really want that blue belt), that's not really a good lesson either.

Mr. Olympia Jay Cutler said he started out with insane detail to include bowel movements. But he eventually realized there is a such thing as too much detail and cut it down quite a bit. I say you can never have too much info. But everyone's mind works differently. Sometimes you just need more or less. It's your journey.
bjj,3e389y,alynnvan,2,Tue Jul 21 20:21:35 2015 UTC,I do sporadically.  My instructor is pretty adamant about doing them. He says he uses them a lot for teaching purposes.  He will go back and look at his white belt journals to see how he looked at a move when he got started to see how to approach the move with beginners opposed to those who already know the move.  I like to do it for new stuff and for any advice given that I would want to come back to.
bjj,3e389y,alynnvan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply. I can see where going back to the journal would be helpful. I guess this can be true too when writing goals in your journal. Maybe when I come back to it as a brown belt I can laugh at myself for writing something like ""Attempt a Flying Armbar"" lol."
bjj,3e389y,MidnightCommanderNA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"hahaha.  Yeah.  Mine is scattered notes, like beginning stuff and then a berembolo armbar thrown in there. It's nice to go back and refresh the stuff that isn't my ""A game"" so I can broaden my game a little.  I'm just a blue belt so I don't necessarily have a ""game"" as of yet but it's nice to have a source to look at that is translated in my own words so I can see how I thought about it."
bjj,3e389y,babb4214,2,Tue Jul 21 19:09:15 2015 UTC,I read the same book but started keeping the journal before then.  I write in an actual notebook though. I feel the physical part of writing helps me retain info better.
bjj,3e389y,babb4214,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:58 2015 UTC,"I used to use that site as well as bjj collective. Both are good sites in my opinion.  I do keep a journal as well but the contents are kind of mixed between techniques that I'm spending time on and general thoughts after rolling.   I think it's really good to keep a journal because of a couple of reasons:   I like to use it to help set techniques into memory. Wherever I learn a technique, I try to go over it in my head a couple of times. This helps out the visualization aspect of things, which I think is important to have. After that, I WAIT a little bit and then try to write the technique down in my journal from memory, as detailed as possible. After that, I go back to the media I learned the tech from and look to see what I missed. I fill in any gaps and then go over it in my head again. Then I take it to the mat and drill. I already have the mental part of the technique somewhat down, now it's time to FEEL the technique. I think this has helped me out a bit.  When I recall a roll that I just had, I like to visualize what I would have like to change during that roll. Did I get caught in a submission? What got me there and how can I change that? Did I miss a submission or was I late on a transition or something? What options do I have from a spot that I was in? I typically ask myself those type of questions and then try my best to visualize those situations and different outcomes. I really like to try to visualize things because when you're actually in that position that you've visualized earlier, it's like you've been there before and your thought process is just a little bit smoother. It helps me at least.    All in all, nobody's journal is the same just like nobody's Jiu Jitsu is the same. It's custom to you and YOUR jiu jitsu.  Hope this helped."
bjj,3e389y,frekreational,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:05 2015 UTC,Thank you for the tips. I will try and analyze my rolls a little better. As I white belt I don't think I am at the level yet where I can feel the technique but I'm sure that will come with time. I do look forward to that. Thanks again.
bjj,3e389y,SuperJohnBravo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a different sensation. But feeling the different pressures and leverages and positions while you're mentally going through the technique links them together and solidifies them in your memory and motor pathways, making them a reactionary thing, something you won't have to think about when doing the technique later on down the road.   Just stay on the mat, it all comes when you put in the time!"
bjj,3e389y,Bob002,2,Tue Jul 21 21:24:52 2015 UTC,"I keep a very basic spreadsheet, nothing crazy like u/slideyfoot has going, but it works for me. Keeps track of my attendance & who was instructing, mat time, techniques we learned/drilled, any additional notes."
bjj,3e389y,Coggi,2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:00 2015 UTC,"I keep a very simple notepad kind of journal. Just to document what techniques I did that day, where I trained, and anything that stuck out in particular that I want to recall later. I make sure to keep it to one page per training day so im not overwhelming myself with a huge book I won't read. It's crude, not well organized, just like my money brain, but it reminds me of the things I need or recall what I've done. I tried a fancy app journal but it sucked and was too detailed and confusing so I ditched it. I'm sure as I progress and start putting a game plan together I'll advance my journal too to some more detail. But for now, the white belt journey seems to suit the small notebook just fine for me."
bjj,3e389y,FortLarned,2,Tue Jul 21 17:45:06 2015 UTC,"I've been trying out MyBJJInfo for Android. It's currently in Beta, but the creator posted here, and that's how i got in on it. I also try to keep a paper journal, however."
bjj,3e389y,cms9690,2,Tue Jul 21 17:46:28 2015 UTC,"I use trackmybjj.com it keeps track of what I'm doing in class and I write in occasionally what I did and any details. Works pretty good but I also keep it to see how often I'm going.  The other one I have been messing with is http://openmat.training it has a feature for game plan which is pretty cool once you invest the time into inputting moves. It makes a spider chart from standing like  Standing-single leg-side control- Kimora, Americana...etc. I also have been messing with throwing in in Tweens like if I land in side control and the arm is trapped compared to if their arm is free. Kinda neat and once I get my mind map more refined I am gonna have my coach look over it before I post it here."

bjj,3e389y,titansweep,2,Tue Jul 21 18:39:00 2015 UTC,"I used bjj training journal for a few months and then migrated everything to evernote. i keep everything organized mostly the same -- separate notebooks for each position, then within each position i have a note for each move. then i use hashtags for chokes/armbars/sweeps/etc and i post youtube videos for moves as well. i switched because i felt like bjjtj was too rigid -- character limitations, etc. it also feels like evernote loads quite a bit faster than bjjtj, but i don't know if i'm imagining things or if that's actually the case.  i do still use bjjtj to log mat time because i haven't found a better alternative for that... not that i've really looked either.  evernote is what i use for most of my organization in general, so it was also easier to have everything one spot.  the journal part is super critical for me because my memory isn't great; writing everything down helps with recall. even if i don't take notes immediately after class i'll make a point to take a couple minutes to email myself or put together a skeleton note that i can flesh out the next day with more details."

bjj,3e2skt,Eizion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:39 2015 UTC,Do these shrink a lot? A2s are usually too tight for me but A3s are too big. I see they have the A2H which sounds like it would be a great fit but I am reluctant.
bjj,3e2skt,gunslinger_006,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:32:01 2015 UTC,"So I found the A3H to be very big on me when I got it.  I first put it through three, five minute drying cycles on HOT and it did not shrink at all.  Later, I was on the verge of saying ""this is too big"" so I put it in the dryer on hot for a full 80 minutes and when it came out, it had shrunk a bit.  Not a lot, I think that each sleeve shortened only about 1 inch.  So, my advice is to get the A2H and see how it fits.  If you never wash or dry it on hot, it should not shrink.  If you want it to shrink a little, you can force it by blasting it for a long time on hot."
bjj,3e2skt,dannsd,2,Tue Jul 21 20:11:08 2015 UTC,"I think that's just the way things work in the summer.  You could look for single weave or gold weave gis, which are much lighter.  A guy I train with has been talking up hemp gis too for the heat."

bjj,3e2skt,Gnar_Goyle,2,Tue Jul 21 21:22:37 2015 UTC,think if you want something light yet durable and have the budget for it i recommend the something like an origin gi. honestly it would be really good to know what kind of gi you currently have so we can kinda have a guideline to go off of.
bjj,3e2skt,Bob002,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:00 2015 UTC,"I've heard good things about the Flow Air. I think a lot of it has to do with the different weaves, too."

I could feel him  playing with me like a cat plays with a mouse before he eats it, he'd give me a little bit of space to move and then immediately shut it down. I also tried to bait him with a couple of different things that I normally get a lot of people with when I was on bottom, and I'm guessing he saw what I was trying to do a mile away because he never fell for them. I watched him roll with everyone from young teens to adults and white belts to even 3 black belts, and the whole time all he ever did was just barely stay ahead of them, despite what we all know he is capable of.

He only used pressure when he had to and only enough to stop me from what I was trying to do. I never really felt his weight or like I was being smothered. Which, now that I think about it, is kind of a thing I've noticed the few times I've gotten to roll with really great black belts who were also bigger guys."

bjj,3e37xz,keepongranola,4,Tue Jul 21 16:46:22 2015 UTC,"The ""old school"" sweep works fine. Understand that nothing will work all the time because there is always a counter attack.   The sweep you described sounds like the old school. if you are pushing him to his back that is the old school. if you are rolling on your back and transferring him across your body than that is ""plan b/twist back"""
bjj,3e37xz,forcejitsu,2,Tue Jul 21 17:45:45 2015 UTC,Try a sweep from half guard called the Twist/Giggler/John Wayne by various people; its a great sweep that works off a wide range of grips.   http://youtu.be/-tr6OAAOXa8  and  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKlm6xRmpIA  Anytime the sweep fails immediately look to switch your feet back to the inside as you pummel for an underhook to come to your knees for single legs or back takes. Here is an example of a basic single leg attack with an underhook:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA8ZEmPwXB8  If your chosen grips meant you've dragged his near arm to the inside you can pull his far hip towards you when the sweep fails to take his back as you're already most of the way there.

bjj,3e37xz,TerramuggusHolmes,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:45 2015 UTC,Do you compete? I've always wondered how IBJJF refs judge banana splits. Is it a DQ for below brown belt because its a leg lock?

bjj,3e37xz,marcosisbjj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:05:06 2015 UTC,NAGA gi follows IBJJF rules? I guess I never paid that much attention.  I wonder why NAGA nogi allows literally everything in the damn world then.

bjj,3e37xz,gunslinger_006,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:52 2015 UTC,it's actually both better and worse in the gi - better because the friction of gi pants helps the lockdown take hold....and because you can get stuck easier if it doesn't go your way

bjj,3dyy32,stay_fr0sty,40,Mon Jul 20 18:14:13 2015 UTC,Don't change schools. I really prefer schools that just do it 'whenever you're ready.   It's so much more fun having it just be another day of training that magically turns into 'you're now a blue/purple/brown-belt -- time for a gauntlet' -- than it is to have a specific day set in stone ahead of time to demonstrate technique.
bjj,3dyy32,justinkimball,15,Mon Jul 20 18:59:16 2015 UTC,"Yea, once the school gets bigger though, it starts being tough. If you have 300 students averaging a belt every 2 years, you're giving out 3 belts per week, and its going to start getting in the way. Add onto that not wanting to promote people immediately before tournaments and you're going to end up giving out a belt almost every day after tournaments, and its going to start to get silly.  For bigger schools, the big promotion day is more of a practical decision than anything else."

I train every session that my instructor teaches, at every gym that he teaches. I've been given the job of taking the class register because the instructor knows I'll always be there. So, I know exactly how  many hours everyone is putting in.  We were talking about relationships and training partners, and he said ""Well, at least X's girlfriend trains so that isn't so bad"".  Me: ""Lol, she doesn't train!""  Him (looking at me like I'm an arrogant b*!#c): ""But I've seen her at the gym wearing a gi before.

bjj,3e2m3c,bluexavi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:47 2015 UTC,I would add that (at least with me/my body type) moving my elbow a bit to the front helps also.  This keeps them from sliding an arm between my ribs and elbow.
bjj,3e2m3c,__methodical,4,Tue Jul 21 17:31:44 2015 UTC,"Keeping your elbows tucked is the answer. It might seem like there must be something else to this, but that is it. You want to learn how to use your body to do all the movements you want without having to extend your arms, that is the tricky part. Your shoulders are strong so use those. Change your body positioning by using your feet on the floor and hip mobility.  Although there are some extra details that might help you out:   Elbows tucked are strong. Keep your elbows tucked. When on your back, driving your opposite foot into the floor so that your butt comes up off of the ground will turn your body slightly towards your opponent. You always want to be facing your opponent. As well, your near arm in this situation is in a very strong position. All of your weight is over this arm and it is tucked. Conversely, your far arm is in a weaker position for the exact opposite reason. Elbows tucked is still strong but they will be able to dig it out. Elbows tucked will buy you time so no need to just leave it out there. Keep your elbows tucked. If you do end up facing away, that top arm is in danger. Keep your elbows tucked. But you also want to connect it to your opponent (usually to their hips but could be connected to their chest or torso depending on the situation.) This connection does make your tucked elbow stronger (similar to bracing your arm against a wall will make it strong) but it also allows you to feel their weight distribution and even hold their positioning long enough to escape. That is important, you have to escape because you are already in a bad position that you will eventually get worse. Always keep your elbows tucked. A lot of the time, people wait until they get to the position before they start thinking about defending it. But that is too late. Your opponent will catch your arm out of position as any time. Even while moving between positions. Think about it always. If you had your elbows tucked in side control make sure they stay tucked all the way through to mount. Don't hug or push in an attempt to avoid mount. Just keep your position and escape mount."

bjj,3e2m3c,astit2,2,Tue Jul 21 15:04:38 2015 UTC,"Know when you are about to get passed. When you know that getting passed is inevitable, stop framing and extending your arms and prepare to go to defense mode."
bjj,3e2m3c,behind-The-Peak,2,Tue Jul 21 14:23:18 2015 UTC,"Keeping your arms/elbows tucked in is a good defense, but you've gotta put a little pressure on your opponent to go along with that.  You can't just hang out on bottom in side control, you've gotta keep working for that sweep.  Or try to slip in a quick Ezekiel choke if you can.  Anything to take his focus off of what he's trying to do to you.  Put him on the defensive."
bjj,3e2m3c,__methodical,2,Tue Jul 21 14:24:10 2015 UTC,I like this advice. Sometimes I find myself fully concentrating on a good defense and I don't even think to try attacking or at least pressuring back. Thanks.
bjj,3e2m3c,magikman2000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:28:31 2015 UTC,as soon as you work out how to keep your arms safe people will attack your neck. imo the core problem is that you're in bottom side control. get out of there.
bjj,3e2m3c,nsadhu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:34 2015 UTC,"your hands can protect your neck while your elbows are tucked. you can't reach in your own collar without exposing your elbow so you have to prevent the attack, not deal with it after the fact. nothing wrong with bottom side control, its a good position to work on keeping your elbows tucked while defending your neck."
