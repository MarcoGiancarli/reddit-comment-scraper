My mother didn't believe me as a child (except when she decided to use my triggers to fuck with me, as you say people do), and I ended up with mental illness from being repeatedly told I was crazy and put on very high doses of SSRIs for OCD -- which I don't have. Print out info on this shit, or get a book. I just got this one from Amazon at the recommendation of another redditter. http://www.amazon.com/Loud-Bright-Fast-Tight-Overstimulating/dp/0060932929 Tell him to read it. I can say first hand that relationships get destroyed if the other person involved thinks you're lying or being malicious. First, they begin to rag on you, and then you resent them. It's a vicious cycle.  As for treating it, there are some known treatments. CBT is being used (I go to a doctor who invented white noise devices to put in ones ears, and you are supposed to write down your reaction to a trigger and then a better way to interpret that thought on the other side of the page, all the while lowering the white noise over time.) If that doesn't work, there's always ear plugs. Try to get some that block out some sound while being able to hear people to speak. If your boyfriend doesn't understand why you are being driven to wear earplugs...idk man. Not to sound like a totally evil soul (I love animals), but if the dog is 14, you probably won't have to deal with it much longer. Of course, your trigger list will probably grow, so it doesn't much matter, so best find a way to try and treat or at least mask the symptoms. Good luck."

Depending on what type of person you are, you might want to take mental or written notes with you.  Just think about some things before you go there:   When and how does your condition affect you? Is there something you want to know about misophonia? Information? What triggers you? What do you hope this appointment will do for you?   You can make up some own points.   Also, and even though this really does not need to be said, but somehow it still does.... there is no shame in visiting a psychiatrist. No need to be telling everyone, but also no need to be actively hiding it or hating yourself for it. Just trust your doc, tell him what you expect, what you hope, and see what he/she can do for you.  I wish you the best of luck."

While I agree with /u/Monkiebusiness, you should also be prepared that the psych has no idea what you are talking about. My experience has been that psychiatrists  are MDs and tend to focus on prescriptions. Yes, that it is a gross generalization and yes, they will have valuable insight, but they may not know or understand the specific nuances of misophonia. But that may also be true with a psychologist. I've have seen numerous types of therapists (Ph.Ds, MDs, LCSWs, coaches, etc.) and the closest I've gotten is ""Oh, that sounds like an OCD-type sound sensitivity"". This observation may not be untrue, but I have yet to find someone whom I feel truly understands miso.   Don't be afraid to ask your mom to change doctors.

A psychologist may help on a completely different level, maybe even as an addition. To be honest, my first adress would be a psychologist and not a psychiatrist, maybe you just confused those two. A psychologist may be able to help you to get along with your misophonia if no one can help in the meantime.

Or taking yourself seriously when no one else does.  And then someone comes along and says ""Oh yeah, you're really sick. Whoops, why did no one see this before?""  I think it helps having a few doctor/nurse friends who are into the local scene and know who's good and who is not. Difference to a regular visit is that they speak ... more openly?

This went on from the time I was about 18 till I was 40.  While it helped with my misophonia, and anger issues in general, it made the times when I couldn't smoke exponentially worse. My brain wasn't used to ""not being high"", so when I wasn't smoking it made  any progress made in handling problems I couldn't avoid many times worse than what they would have been if I'd never smoked to begin with.  After taking a vacation to iceland, not having access to marijuana, and becoming enraged at minor triggers and issues. It took every ounce of willpower I had to not let it ruin my vacation. When I got back I decided to try out not smoking for a while, to see if it would help getting used to being sober. Somehow after a couple weeks I became my usual self again, without needing to smoke of course. The financial and other benefits that came with not smoking almost immediately outweighed any of my previously perceived benefits of smoking.  For me, it's sort of like cigarettes. When I'm smoking all the time, not smoking regularly gives me anxiety. Lighting up and taking the first puff soothes that anxiety almost immediately, however, most of the anxiety itself is rooted in smoking's physical and mental addiction.  I can only speak from my own perspective, I know everyone is different, this is just my own experiences. I do believe if it works for you it's probably better to continue to go that route. It's just there are benefits to not smoking and learning to cope sober, at least for me."

My office environment is toxic, with several people pounding their keyboards to death at any given moment. As an added bonus, a couple of them are mechanical keyboards, so that loud, plastic 'clack' noise of the keys bottoming out just goes through my brain like a knife. Then there's the guy who eats an apple in 4 huge, crunching/slurping bites, or the guy who eats dry cereal out of a plastic dish, or the pen clickers, the foot tappers....the list goes on.  My single saving grace is that I can wear headphones all day, so that's exactly what I do. Unfortunately, it does make concentration more difficult...particularly if I'm working on something really complicated. Ideally, a quiet environment would be better, but that's never going to happen there lol."

The heels I have don't make that sound except for one pair I own, and I think it's the shape of them.  I also suspect it's the length, which is frustrating because I hate making that sound but they are expected in professional environs (and yet finding a 2-3 inche heel is harder than finding a 5 inch heel, go figure!).  The bottom of the heel has something to do with it too; not a lot of heels are made with the quieter material beneath the...pointed edge of the heel? Hrm.

The irritating eating sounds she makes are bad enough without having that accentuating it. Have noticed this with others and it's generally certain movements, like that weird corner of mouth rotating chew with their teeth out (mouth open, of course) that some people do.  I'm guilty of licking my fingers but I try to do it sparingly or daintily and without smacking noises when others are around, but there's seriously some people who just go full hog with it and it's very irritating and disgusting to see and hear. Like, is it really necessary to deep throat your fingers?  You know when people put something down they then jostle it and pat it several times to make sure it's in place? My mother does that and I just want to slap her hand when she does it because it makes me angry. Just set it down, it's not going anywhere, damn.  A lot of gesticulation (hand gestures while speaking) really get to me. I generally never do them, except for the random and rare time it happens (and I am angry at myself when I do it). Unfortunately the person I spend most time with at college (a 50 year old I've sort of befriended) constantly accentuates her talking with extremely irritating hand gestures, along with exaggerated facial expressions that send my blood boiling. The way her mouth is shaped just makes it worse and I find it hard to watch her speak, but of course it's rude to not look at people you're speaking to. I can't even speak to her on the phone much because I can picture her speaking and flailing around as she speaks."

With the recent legalization in Washington state, I began experimenting for about 2 months and noticed a consistent decrease of the effect of my triggers by approximately 80%. It was a total game changer. Things that used to cause me to rage or run from the room barley registered anymore. I found that once I smoked, the effects would last up to 48 hours depending on the strain. After a couple more months my triggers have gone down to 0. For all intents and purposes I'm cured. For me the two that helped the most were named Dutch Treat, Girl Scout Cookie and Cinex and for those inclined, I can't recommend it highly enough."

If so, would it help for the Dr to speak with your mother and explain that it's not just some imagined thing?  My situation is obviously not the same as yours in that I live with my partner, not my parents. That said, it's just as difficult to approach the subject with her. I've explained it as best I can, shown her countless web resources concerned with the condition etc etc. I still don't think she really 'gets it' but she acknowledges that something's not quite right. I guess the only think you can do is provide as much evidence as you can. If they still don't buy it....well, there's not much you can do to change their minds. That's people for you 😉.

misophonia,3datam,mrbonk71,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:52:34 2015 UTC,"I had similar success with marijuana (Colorado resident here), as /u/Err_Go mentioned. Unfortunately, that's not always an option for everyone, due to age or location restrictions. If it's a possibility for you, it does seem to help a lot of us cope. I don't really want to kill my husband every time we have dinner together anymore. However, if it's not something you or your doctor feel is right, don't do it. Weed certainly isn't for everyone.  OP, have you sat down with your mother or your family to explain just how detrimental this is? Some people obviously just think that's nothing, that ""that sort of thing doesn't really exist"" or ""you're just being neurotic."" My mom and step-dad gave me the same lines when I was in high school, saying that it was just me trying to either use as it as an excuse get away from my family (not helped by the fact that I was goth and broody at the time) or that I was seeking attention. This was before it was really, truly acknowledged as a medical problem, but once I discovered that other people had problems like mine, I was able to find literature and studies on Misophonia. Seeing it in writing helped my parents to understand that it is a real thing, and that it's manageable with the right support system. Since then, they have been very aware of my triggers and give me the benefit of warning me before eating or making sure that if we go out, we go to noisy restaurants or places with plenty to distract me so it won't affect me as much. It was a very, very hard conversation to have with them at first, particularly presenting my very southern parents with scientific literature and saying ""look! It's really a problem!""... it took patience on both mine and my parent's part, but we got there eventually.  You mentioned that your doctor told you that blogging about it, essentially talking about it, might help the situation. With that, it sounds like you have your doctor's support, which means your doctor can probably help you find the information that you would need to bring to your family to help them understand. Even showing them the community here may help them to understand just how widespread it is.   Either way, I think it helps to know that you're not alone. It's not easy, and the medical community is still just beginning to understand this one. It gets better."

I don't react as poorly and when I leave the situation they don't react as badly.  one of my best friends was the one who researched it and the one who first told me about it because it reminded her of me. it meant a lot for me that she did that, because she is one of the people who have things that trigger me.

They tend to forget it and not take it seriously. I also have it really hard, and have had it for at least 20-23 years."
misophonia,3czd7g,CRISPR,3,Mon Jul 13 11:26:55 2015 UTC,"I just learned about ASMR, and learned about my misophonia (that it is an actual thing and not just me being an overly-sensitive anal jerk) perhaps a year ago. Finding out that some people have the opposite reactions to the sounds I so despise has made me want to try exposure therapy of my own to get a handle on it. Your post makes me want to try it all the more, knowing it has worked (and is continuing to work) for someone. So thank you."
misophonia,3d1oct,MuckYoFama,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"Please don't smoke marijuana again. I don't want to recommend taking medication but if you feel desperate or if you have other problems(OCD, ADHD, depression etc...) you can try some medications(with doctor advice). I came across a video on youtube where a girl was talking about her misophonia and she was diagnosed with something and the medications(for whatever she was diagnosed with) helped her misophonia a lot. I can't find the video right now. I'll post the link later if I can find it. Anyway, I also read here that some different medications work for some people. I think you have to try other things before trying medication though."
misophonia,3d1oct,NavajoWhite,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:46:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm completely sober and have been for months and months. I just said what worked for me. Because it did. It helped with other issues of mine, also. I don't know why you've said not to when it's much less harmful (like.. Not harmful at all)  compared to taking a scientifically generated pill. Thanks, though."
misophonia,3d1oct,NavajoWhite,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:00:17 2015 UTC,"Your welcome. I usually don't advice the pills but I don't think it is less harmful than marijuana. I don't think marijuana can solve this or other problems I mentioned(like OCD, ADHD...). But I read some people say that the pills treated their problem. Ok, maybe it took two years and there have been many side effects, I don't know... Still, better than not being sober.   Don't get me wrong though, I just want everyone to make healthy choices."
misophonia,3d1oct,NavajoWhite,2,Mon Jul 13 17:16:28 2015 UTC,But I personally agree more with marijuana that pills. As marijuana is natural and pills are scientifically modified. You know where I'm coming from?
misophonia,3d1oct,NavajoWhite,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:54:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry I didn't understand the first sentence. Did you mean ""marijuana than pills"" instead of ""marijuana that pills""?  As for the rest, I understand what you're saying(even though I don't want to smack anyone but me, lol :D ) but just because it's ""natural"" doesn't mean that it's harmless. I read that some medications(probably including pills) have a slight dose of them in it. Not exactly ""marijuana"" perhaps but that kinda ""illegal drugs"" or whatever you call them. So, I don't think anyone should use them on their own. I hope you can find the right medication that works for you. Or better, maybe you can try -healthy- herbal teas. I read that chamomile tea(2 cups a day) made a misophonic person a lot better."
misophonia,3cxxzw,ickyickyickyicky,2,Sat Jul 11 19:52:48 2015 UTC,I feel for you stranger. You can't allow this thing to come between you and your mother. Love her while you still can.
misophonia,3cxxzw,SurlyRed,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:04:18 2015 UTC,I can't even fathom what it would feel like to have one of my triggers be my family members breathing. Maybe you should speak to a therapist as a way to find tactics to better handle the situation? In the least you can figure out a few coping strategies and a way to have a candid conversation with your mom.   You're not a monster.
misophonia,3cxxzw,ChirishFriendo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:59:58 2015 UTC,"Been there, done that. I'm sorry this is happening to you."
misophonia,3cxxzw,Heresy666,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:28:28 2015 UTC,My bf gained a bit of weight and has since been breathing differently and I can hear him wheezing ever so slightly. It drives me insane but I try really hard to refocus on something else or walk away and give my ears a break.
misophonia,3cxxzw,4everal0ne,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:50:05 2015 UTC,"If this is making her sad, you have to explain what you're feeling nicely-like when you're calm and having a good conversation with your mom. There are websites about misophonia you can show them to her. And please make sure that she knows you're not blaming her, you just can't control yourself."
misophonia,3cxxzw,NavajoWhite,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:57:17 2015 UTC,I've tried to. I've sent her links and explained to her what's happening but I believe that she thinks I can choose to deal with it. She thinks I can choose to do a lot of things... Like I can choose to not have panic attacks or decide to not get really depressed.
misophonia,3cxxzw,NavajoWhite,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:02:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. I assume your panic attacks are not related to misophonia. Are you seeing a doctor? Maybe if he/she talks to your mom, she'll be convinced that it's not easy to control."
misophonia,3cxxzw,NavajoWhite,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:59:26 2015 UTC,I have seen a lot of doctors/therapists. The doctors try to give you pills until you stop complaining. I did finally find a therapist that helped me go from having panic attacks everyday to having my first one in a year after moving recently. She's certain I'm dealing with PTSD and I don't think she's wrong. I guess the only thing stopping me from going back is that I'm on new insurance and I don't know what it would cost. Plus I don't know what I would say? Hi I'm back can we work on me not being crazy again?
misophonia,3cxxzw,NavajoWhite,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:13:50 2015 UTC,"Did you try EMDR? I read that it helps with panic attacks. BUT! I really don't know much about it. So, I'm not suggesting, I'm just curious if you know about it?  EDIT: I just googled and saw that EMDR is also useful for misophonia. Again, not suggesting :) ."
misophonia,3cxxzw,NavajoWhite,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:11:54 2015 UTC,"I'm reading ""The Body Keeps the Score"" and I'm pretty sure it talks about that.... I haven't gotten too far because it makes me think a lot about everything and I get in a bad mental state so I'm trying to take a small break. I haven't got that far. Seems weird though? Do you have to have a therapist guide you through it?"
misophonia,3cxxzw,Mullixhi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:44:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't know... I saw a post on a message board that was saying how EMDR helped her panic attacks. She was seeing a shrink(or is it called therapist?) for EMDR. I don't have panic attacks but I wondered if it is helpful for misophonia and if it's something we can do on our own and found a youtube video titled ""self-administered emdr"". I was gonna try it for my noise triggers but I only tried it for two days(like 5 minutes each day). It was a few months ago, actually I forgot about it. So, I can't really say if it works or not. If that kinda things makes you feel bad/nervous forget it for now. You can try later when you feel better."
misophonia,3cxxzw,trickster100,2,Tue Jul 14 04:02:31 2015 UTC,Thank you for talking to me. You are very kind. I hope you overcome the misophonia and best wishes in your endeavors.

Just seeing them clean their teeth or a mere swallow keeps me up at night. It hurts because my mom is such a great person and I hate to hurt her so much. I tried to explain to her the other day that I can't help myself from the way I react but she told me that it's all in my head and that if I wanted to heal I would have a long time ago. Best of luck to you and your mom, I know this can be tough."

misophonia,3cxnn1,5boros,3,Sat Jul 11 18:23:40 2015 UTC,"If I have to explain it to someone I know well and see a lot I tell them it activates the fear center of my brain and the ""fight or flight"" instinct kicks in. Then I explain how fight or flight works when there isn't actually danger.   I really like your explanation for quick fixes though I think I'm going to start using that."
misophonia,3cxnn1,SailorTits,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:29:25 2015 UTC,"That's a good way to put it, I might try out saying certain sounds activate my fight or flight area of the brain making me really uncomfortable. I think the key is mentioning that you understand it's not normal, and you're just doing your best to deal with it since it's your problem. I find that if you people feel that you're you putting forth effort towards anything, they'll naturally want to help."
misophonia,3cxnn1,kaswing,2,Sun Jul 12 13:30:45 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that when I explain it in casual conversation or try to make light of it in the moment, it backfires. (People make the noise more as a joke, with varying degrees of intended meanness, but to the same effect, which I'm sure you're all familiar with.)  I've had some limited success with a couple friends, and what I've done is 1) talk to them one on one 2) adopt a serious tone of voice 3) use clinical terms (misphonia and SSD) 4) mention my diagnosis (from an audiologist, in case you want one) 5) explain it in physiological terms (not the mechanism, because I don't know it, but using phrases like ""my body,"" not ""I feel."") and the phrase ""fight or flight."" In these cases, people have been very understanding, although they often forget and make trigger sounds anyway, I at least feel that I could ask them to stop if I wanted.  (That knowledge helps hugely for me.)   My boyfriend is absolutely amazing about it. I took a similar approach with him, I think the difference is how awesome he is ;)"

Clearly my vote is no! :) Something that I don't think we should be saying is that people are too sensitive if they are triggered by words. The reason that I think we should stop using the [trigger warning] label is because I'm an advocate for building up tolerance, and I think shying away from mild triggers is part of the problem.    I do think that trigger warnings must be labeled on audio/video links, because that is something we want to know about and prepare for!

The reason that I think we should stop using the [trigger warning] label is because I'm an advocate for building up tolerance, and I think shying away from mild triggers is part of the problem ...Thanks for voting guys! The overwhelming response is no right now :)   You never once mentioned name calling and I don't see anything on your post calling people ""pussies"". Just because people appreciate your post and the fact you started this conversation yesterday doesn't mean that your updates on your post and your comments have come off as really condescending.   And so what if I just made an account? I made a reddit account specifically because I follow this subreddit to cope with misophonia and your comments caused me to want to join in on the conversation. You do get that reddit has a lot of people that read it and don't actively participate?"
misophonia,3cwpie,TheLoneGreyWolf,3,Sun Jul 12 04:22:56 2015 UTC,What's up with the passive aggressive emoticons? You're coming off as being really condescending and you think it's funny.

I actually sent a message to the mod apologizing and saying that I should have fact checked by PMing them! XD     come off as really condescending      Come on man, they're SMILEY FACES!!!!

You're also completely ignoring the fact that you claim to state your opinion on not calling people ""pussies"". No one is calling others that term. Misophonia is a very serious condition that many people struggle with in ways people without it cannot imagine. I've been following this subreddit for about a year now and this is one of the most supportive subs I've come accross on reddit. You can't just make up pretend bullying scenarios to justify your bizarre ego trip."

We are all triggered by things, but constantly posting the trigger tag seems to be a bit overkill. It makes us sound like a bunch of sensitive SJW who constantly talk about being triggered.   Misophonia is something everyone on this sub suffers from. We aren't surprising someone with an off topic that might cause a flashback to a really awful life event. If we're so deeply in need of a trigger tag because the very discussion of specific actions may trigger someone, then perhaps reading about the trigger and subsequently visiting this sub isn't really a great idea."

I only get mad when I stew on a sound I heard recently and thinking about that instance triggers me. After awhile, I'm fine though.   I do worry about reading other peoples triggers because if I know someone else's I will subconsciously listen for it, most likely adding to my long list of triggers. Does anyone else have that problem?"

misophonia,3cu2ah,OboesBleat,2,Mon Jul 13 00:53:31 2015 UTC,"One of the two mods hasn't even posted here in over a year, the other one still thinks that a trigger warning is necessary for whatever backwards-ass reason. People come here to discuss, and a lot of that is talking about certain sounds. When 80% of posts have a TRIGGER WARNING you know the policy is stupid.  One year ago, by mod /u/cycophuk:   Because last year, it was a major request by the subscribers of this subreddit. It continues to be a rule because there are those that still want it to continue. While it may not look great, it is not an inconvenience to take the minimal extra time to add it to the title, while helping those that are more sensitive than others.   Then, 8 months ago by the same mod: Link"
misophonia,3cu2ah,OboesBleat,2,Sat Jul 11 03:30:03 2015 UTC,"As I've already explained in the comments you quoted and linked to, adding ""trigger warning"" to the title was done at the request of subscribers.  I think it's necessary because the majority thought it was necessary.  I have no problem discussing the issue when it's brought up and I'm completely open to change as long as it is what the majority wants, not the vocal minority.  The last time this was discussed, I asked people for suggestions on what they felt could be a good compromise since there are people here that are more sensitive to reading triggers.  I did not get a single reply.  Not one.  I can't make change when no one talks to me."
misophonia,3cu2ah,cycophuk,-2,Sat Jul 11 11:22:56 2015 UTC,There is no compromise...it's do or don't. We really just need to hear from those who are legitimately triggered and not those who just don't like reading about it.

Just because you can't think of anything, it doesn't mean it has to be black or white.  If the subscribers here want it to be all or nothing though, then that is for them to decide.

It's not that strangers eating don't annoy me, I'm just better able to deal with it. This is also because people generally don't want to make a scene.

This is purely her speculation, but it's also in line with mine, so I think it has a little weight. When you are infatuated with someone, you don't notice annoying things. If you've every heard of the honeymoon stage of a relationship (not after you get married, it's the beginning of a relationship when you guys are super excited about each other and do more relationship stuff than you normally would later on) it involves infatuation. When you are at the beginning of a relationship, that's when you aren't really triggered by annoying things. That being said, I don't know any science behind it.

From what I've read, many symptoms develop at a young age (mine also started at age 8).  Your doctor will probably refer you to a therapist or psychiatrist. Chances are they will have never heard of misophonia. However, I do support going to one and speaking to them about it anyway. I started seeing a therapist for an unrelated reason, yet I still learned coping mechanisms that really helped and learned that my anxiety is a major contributing factor, and dealing with that helped as well. I think it's definitely worth it to get a referral from your doctor-- there's no harm in at least getting advice and potentially help."

misophonia,3c8duz,dadoodadoo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:54:29 2015 UTC,"Yes it does! But I've also learned how to prepare myself for situations where I'll be around triggers. Make sure that you're well rested (this is actually my biggest priority because I'm bipolar), and make sure that you've eaten enough or that you're not starving when you will be around the triggers. Remember who/what will bug you, and try to situate yourself as far away as possible. Take deep breaths when triggers hit. Take deep breaths before the triggers hit. The anticipation actually amplifies the trigger - if you work on getting rid of the anxiety, the triggers won't stress you out as much (imagine going from a 6 to a 5 in intensity). Baby steps my friend! Don't expect an instant fix. So far it has helped me out enough to get by in some situations, and made other situations not quite as bad. I still flipped the fuck out when I was around my little brother for father's day weekend, though. LOL"

As for requesting the music turned off, may not go your way. People don't understand or relate, normally. They just we're being pricks or control freaks. Best advice is to never forget your plugs.

The worst situations, as I'm sure others will attest to, are the ones where they remain silent. Ever since I told my parents/friends about it, they are very respectful of it. The problem with mental disorders is that other people can't really see it. If you had no legs, your parents would get you a wheelchair and help you live your life that way. You were born with a chronic disorder. It is better to embrace it than to pretend it's not there. The only way I know that it 'goes away' is by building up tolerance through therapy. I go twice a week for an hour - we just sit there and I deal with my triggers. My progress is slow, but it is SO worth it. I would never be better without the support of my family.    They didn't accept it at first. My step-dad thought I was just being a bitch. My mom would not listen to it either, until she saw doctors saying that it's a legitimate disorder. Now she is part of a parents of misophonia support group.  Here is my ultimate question for you. Do you want to be happy, or do you want to be 'normal'?    Really spend some time thinking about that. Good luck!"
misophonia,3c3vma,TheLoneGreyWolf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:01:58 2015 UTC,Can you explain what exactly you're doing in the therapy?
misophonia,3c3vma,NavajoWhite,2,Sun Jul 5 21:09:10 2015 UTC,"Certainly :) We do exposure therapy. The idea is to build tolerance. Imagine a scale from 1-10 for your triggers. You want to put yourself in a 5.5 situation, which is uncomfortable but isn't going to make you scream and rage. For me, it started with just watching my therapist chew. Not noisy, just watching her chew. Then I started to eat around her. Slowly we progressed to crunching noises. Then she would have me make the noises I hate so much. I would chew with my mouth open. It is hard work, and you have to want the triggers to be manageable. Then we started to move to bubble gum. Then we would open youtube videos and listen to someone chewing. Then we would listen AND watch at the same time. It's slow, it is hard, but it works. Keep the intensity at 5 1/2. It makes you struggle, but it's not so overwhelming that you won't try to do any more exposure.    You are going to feel shitty. You are going to fail, but you will build it up. It is very important that you start small and work your way up to the biggest triggers.    It works. It's becoming more and more manageable. It's definitely not perfect yet, but it's becoming easier."

I have 4-5 audial and 2-3 visual triggers right now, which is ok because most of them are not everyday things, I hear/see them rarely.

misophonia,3blku8,SLpaca,3,Tue Jun 30 22:46:47 2015 UTC,"In terms that she should be able to understand, she's an abusive bully.  When I was a kid, in elementary school, I didn't want to go out to recess and play; I wanted to read instead. I had to go outside, but at least the teachers let me bring my books with me. Some of the other kids thought it would be funny to torment me in various ways, in some cases by kicking the book I was reading out of my hands. They didn't understand why I wanted to read (or, in your case, why you want to not have to listen to triggering noises), but they thought my reaction when they disrupted it was funny enough to keep doing it. I'm not super well-versed in bully psychology, so that might not be what motivated them at all, but it's unimportant in this analogy; the point is that it sounds an awful lot like what this woman's doing to you.  It doesn't matter if she can't understand why you're upset, only that she understands that you are upset and that she continues to instigate it. She doesn't need to understand you to not be an awful person.  My legitimate suggestion, therefore, is to not explain what she's doing in terms of what it means to you, but in terms of what it means she is: a despicable, abusive bully. She is, in at least this regard, an awful person, regardless of any other redeeming qualities she may or may not have.  I suggest that you buy her a Hallmark card and tell her as much. In elegant script:  Dearest Caroline, It is rare to meet as exquisite a creature as you Black of heart, without empathy Nay, you've a mean spirit within you  I should be sad to be leaving But I'm not.  You are an awful person. You are an abusive bully. No matter what other good things you do You can never take back your spite.  It will not matter if you save a hundred lives In this matter, you will still be despicable.  ---- Rafaella Sarsaparilla   I am not sure that actually giving her this card would be wise. Perhaps it would be better to instead send her a potato? (Just make sure to use your email address and not hers.)"

They work by passively reducing everything by a certain amount, and then some also have physical mechanisms to close when they get hit by very loud sounds.   These have two options ($10)  These have removable plugs on the end to choose between trying to block everything and trying to only reduce everything. ($12)  You can also try these, which have a lower average reduction and may only be useful for quiet noises, but don't muffle the sounds. ($25)  These are more comfortable for laying around/sleeping ($30)  Another option to try out if none of the others worked well ($24)  These you can wear all day comfortably if you don't want to hear anything. Just including for completeness. You can still hear while wearing them, but things like chewing would be zeroed out... but it's obviously not discrete ($21)  With any of them though, if you try hard enough you can still hear (or imagine that you're hearing) the thing.  Oh, and not super related but I'll throw these in, headphones you can wear while laying on your ear. Put on a bit of white/pink/brown noise and see how that works out for you."

Earplugs block out all of the bad sounds AND lower the volume to something acceptable.  I went with my sister one time to go see the Hobbit movie, even though I don't care about the Hobbit series at all, because she had a crappy seat last time and wanted to go again, but hates going by herself.

The theater was full and a couple decided to sit next to me. The girl, who was sitting next to me, pulls out a cup of ice cream out of her fucking purse and starts to SMACK on it. I wanted to cry.

The guy in the video warns the others about his reactions and says ""I may swear or strike back"". Glad I'm not like that and hope you're not, too. I don't know if it's the same condition but some people feel uncomfortable and get defensive(like the guy in the video) if you point your finger at them, not even touching them at all. Sorry I can't describe it better. And I don't have a video about it. Just forget it if you don't understand :) ."
misophonia,3bcbi0,snn1626,5,Mon Jun 29 03:53:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say I react quite so strongly. I don't LIKE my sides touched, it feels very sensitive and awkward when someone else touches me there for any reason and at any time, no matter how light/heavy of a touch. When I touch there, it feels the same. Maybe? Depends on exactly how sharp of an object I'm looking at is.    I also feel the reverse of this I guess? I love looking at round things. Especially eggs, I love looking at raw eggs. And round bails of hay and such. It makes me feel very relaxed and content.  Hope that helps!  Edit for the new questions.    I really don't think I have ASMR. I looked up some of the 'triggers' and 9/10 made me feel uncomfortable because of the miso. The only one I got any somewhat pleasurable effect from was some lady whispering and I think it was mostly cuz it was unexpected and then it went back to feeling weird lol. Had some odd tingles on the back of my neck and thighs. Then it felt like I wanted to run away lol. I have been diagnosed with ADHD and I take Vyvanse every day for it. I also have tics I guess, but not sure why. Only really come out when I'm stressed or super pissed off. I'm clumsy as fuck. But that's mostly cuz I don't pay attention and it's usually with my feet or knocking things over. But I crochet and do other crafts, so I'd say fine motor are okay. No I don't have anything like that.    Sometimes when I get a lot of visual stimulation  (like trying to take in a newly loaded Web page with lots of stuff on it) I get disoriented. Like my eyes start to twitch and I get almost dizzy. I have to force my eyes to focus on one point and go from there. Otherwise I have to completely close my eyes and turn away to sort of reset.  For whatever reason it's got my numbers fucked up. Sorry."

When I scratch my ribs(back, front or sides, doesn't matter), even if I don't use much force, it hurts a bit. Like I can't breath for a couple of seconds, lol :D . Thanks for answering."
misophonia,3bcbi0,snn1626,2,Mon Jun 29 04:16:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's uncomfortable in a sense that I don't even want to touch my own sides (like if I had a wound or fracture,  I wouldn't want anyone touching it including myself ). But when others touch my sides I just feel odd and want it to stop immediately.   I lost an entire fingernail once due to a moving accident. Before it grew back and after the old one fell off, there was a time where just my nailbed was exposed and it felt so unnatural. I hated the vulnerable feeling and that's the closest I can think of.  And as for scratching, whenever I have an itch on my sides it feels like a burning sensation when I scratch. Unlike anywhere else."

I recall practically scraping my notebook paper with my pen, making big black scribbles and writing ""stop stop stop STOP STOP"" on my notebook paper in order to cope. (I think I still have one of these papers, maybe I'll post it later?) After dealing with this for a few days I think my teacher finally noticed how goddamn loud and obnoxious this guy was with his gum (or maybe she noticed my face scrunching up and my entire body on the verge of collapsing onto the floor into a fetal position) and told the guy to quit it.  But even before that instance, I've always had a thing about snoring for as long as I can remember. I slept in my mom's bed a lot as a kid and I'd kick the bed to make her stop."

My parents had a TV installed in their bedroom, which was next door to mine, and would watch films in bed until they fell asleep (this was back in the days before 24-hour broadcasting). So I'd be kept awake until around 12 midnight - 1am, on a week night when I had school the following day, with all sorts of noises that occur in films.  Suffice to say, both parents had issues - one was a raging narcissist, and the other was an enabler with narcissistic tendencies, so they cared nothing for what I was feeling anyway. I think that complete lack of sympathy exacerbated the problem."

My house is the only one big enough to support family functions so for 12-16 hours I'm surrounded by bad manners.  It sucks and it's why I start drinking at 10am on those days.  That is NOT a healthy coping mechanism though.    Get a therapist.  I did.  He told me I'm ADD and OCD.  Now I'm on Ritalin and other therapies.  It takes the edge off.

misophonia,3b8r2q,5boros,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:27:53 2015 UTC,"As someone who's had this condition my entire life I can confidently say to you things will definitely get better. You are at a point in your life now that you have no control over what environment you're in, or who you're surrounded by. I too had a father that was a non stop trigger. Loud breathing, sniffing, constantly snacking, and his jaw actually popped like someone cracking their fingers when he chewed. Needless to say my teen years were hell. I felt like it was hopeless, and back then no one ever heard of this condition.  That all changed for me the day I moved out and started college. I noticed a 100% change in my attitude, and had more tolerance during the times I couldn't avoid my triggers. Sure I still get triggered almost daily since I've chosen to balance avoiding triggers with other things that I care about. Being able to choose where I live, and who I work/socialize with as an adult, means I get triggered a lot less than I used to.  My best advice is to focus on becoming successful enough in your own life so you can create a comfortable environment of your own choosing, and career for yourself. If you're booksmart hit the books harder than everyone else. If you think you're more of a mechanical or practical thinker, choose a career and focus on developing the skills associated with it.  It sounds harsh, but there will probably never be an easy answer to this. It's going to be a problem for us no matter how many people acknowledge this condition, or how well funded misophonia research gets. I'm a strong believer in carrying earbuds everywhere just in case, and won't hesitate to avoid annoying people, even when it means I'll give up a little ground on making the most out of each situation."

If it hangs around too long, you'll panic. You'll swat at it. You'll run away. You might even scream. That's how I feel when I hear you eat. I feel threatened. It isn't something I can control. It's an instinctive fear reflex."

misophonia,3aqjpt,arposey,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:14:10 2015 UTC,Maybe your folks will understand it better if you explain it that way. They may not have misophonia but I'd bet they've been freaked out by a bug before.
misophonia,3aqjpt,Dreamliss,2,Tue Jun 23 00:12:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe ask them to browse this subreddit with you. See that it's not just you but others with this problem too, and you'll have their posts to help show how frustrating and painful it can be to be forcibly exposed to noises that trigger you. Good luck."
misophonia,3aqjpt,Lamech777,2,Mon Jun 22 19:50:38 2015 UTC,If you can happen to find a Psychologist or Therapist that recognizes misophonia that is near you. Agree with your mom and have her take you to one of those. Probably shouldn't tell her they recognize this if she doesn't believe you atm.  https://misophoniatreatment.com/therapists-and-counselors

My aunt has a learning disability and she doesn't know how to chew with her mouth closed so every time I'm at a family dinner I have to strategically place myself away from her.

However, I made an attempt to watch a couple videos with chewing/lip smacking (thinking they could help me get over it) in them and almost lost my mind. The mics they use make it seem like they are right next to your ear. I just could not do it. So I unsubscribed."
misophonia,3ap9rd,chelsesque,4,Mon Jun 22 19:38:37 2015 UTC,"It's weird but some of the things that set off my misophonia also, in different settings, will trigger my ASMR. For example, I will become enraged when someone chews gum next to me on the bus but relaxed when I listen/watch a gum chewing ASMR video. It's really bizarre."
misophonia,3ap9rd,Cook13Byte,2,Tue Jun 23 00:44:35 2015 UTC,Same here...just watched a 10 min ASMR video of breathing and lip smacking (my top 2 misophonia triggers) and I feel really relaxed (but confused lol). It gives me hope!!

Honestly, I look down on people who do any of this stuff, and I can't help it.  My dad also eats hot food and then does that huff n puff thing... I've told him a few times to not keep putting another piece in his mouth if it's hot! Just common sense really."

misophonia,3amxf2,255255255noise,8,Sun Jun 21 20:49:04 2015 UTC,Diet influences more than most people realize. What you put in determines what comes out. You think your brain doesn't run on food?
misophonia,3amxf2,PhilHit,3,Sun Jun 21 20:57:13 2015 UTC,This particular change in lifestyle has been known to help people who have a myriad of mental illnesses. My ex suffers from depression and it has helped ease some of his problems. I wouldn't have even guessed when I started it that it might help with my misophonia and no one has ever mentioned misophonia anywhere in the keto subreddit (or anywhere else for that matter). I started the change because I was wanting to lose weight not because I believed it would help with anything else.   I'm sorry you doubt this but please know that I'm so happy I could cry. I don't have to fear long car rides because people might get chips. I don't have to fear breakfast because of cereal. All of the fears I had of people eating for any reason are gone from my life.
misophonia,3amxf2,Nora_Epinephron,2,Sun Jun 21 20:58:30 2015 UTC,"I have been reading a lot of articles online lately about an intolerance to lectins (found in beans and many grains) leading to inflammation of the hypothalamus, which then causes many mental issues such as anxiety and depression. So it makes sense that a keto diet would be beneficial to misphonia. I am planning on following a diet called the ""Perfect Health Diet"" that is specifically geared towards eliminating lectins.  Glad you found something that has worked for you."
misophonia,3amxf2,paisleyterror,7,Mon Jun 22 01:39:11 2015 UTC,That is great! I'm so happy for you :)

misophonia,3amxf2,Heresy666,4,Sun Jun 21 22:10:55 2015 UTC,"I've been on keto for over a year. Now that you mention it, it does seem like all the food noises have been more bearable than usual. When I was in high school I sometimes would lose my temper and yell at people for smacking their food or gum. I have a coworker that smacks everything he puts in his mouth and it usually doesn't phase me. Every now and again I have to remove myself to calm down but 99% of the time I'm fine."
misophonia,3amxf2,dc880610,3,Sun Jun 21 21:54:24 2015 UTC,That's wonderful to hear! I haven't seen anything else regarding Keto helping with misophonia specifically so hearing stories from other folks that it has helped (even a little!) is fantastic.

I've heard of keto, but despite any of the arguments in favor, I can't convince myself to try it. Plus, it doesn't seem to be the most affordable option, and money is tight now.  But, thanks for sharing, OP. Potential solutions are the only reason I stick around this place. I'll keep it in mind."
misophonia,3amxf2,RachelRTR,3,Mon Jun 22 15:12:11 2015 UTC,"Keto should be cheaper than eating 'normal' food. Meat in western countries is plentiful and cheap. Protein powder is relatively cheap, eggs are cheap. I save money when on keto.  Having said that, Keto does absolutely nothing at all for my misophonia."
misophonia,3amxf2,RachelRTR,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"Regarding price, your experience hasn't matched up with mine. Meat tends to be the most expensive thing I buy. I've done protein powder before, but I always feel it in the wallet; I've never considered it cheap.  These things can be regional, though. I remembered hearing people claim avocados were cheap, which I thought was preposterous, being from the southeast (where $1 each is a"" bargain""). But then I visited California and saw a roadside stand with avocados 7 for $1, and it made sense. That's a huge difference.  I won't argue with you on eggs, though. They're pretty cheap. But after a few years of eating two a day, I eventually got tired of them and had to give them up for a while. I can only handle eggs for so long.  Interesting to hear the counterargument for misophonia, though. I had a feeling it wouldn't be a solution for everyone."
misophonia,3aniny,empathtwink,3,Sun Jun 21 23:26:13 2015 UTC,"I usually just play my own music or turn on a fan. Try some good headphones. Unfortunately, most people these days only care about themselves and can't be bothered to find some empathy for others."

Just knowing the noise is present from hearing the bass for a split second, even if it's almost 100% drowned out is still just as infuriating sometimes. If the fans don't work I've got over ear noise canceling headphones and a very large itunes library as a backup. I live in a small apartment in an old building in Manhattan, coping mechanisms are vital to my situation."
misophonia,3alaz9,duncakes,9,Sun Jun 21 09:01:46 2015 UTC,"As a little kid, I used to get so angry at my brother. I would yell at him every time he chewed with his mouth open or swallowed like a cartoon character. When he hit around 15 years-old, one day, he thanked me. He said, ""I'm really glad you forced me to chew with my mouth closed. It's really disgusting to hear people chew like that.""  I was pretty shocked to hear him say that. All these years, I felt rather guilty for being so harsh with him. But it seems to have given him the skills to be empathetic and conscientious about his eating habits. I was really glad to hear his perspective on the matter. Maybe even if he did see me as a crazy bitch, at least he learned some manners."
misophonia,3alaz9,ShowerWithATegu,3,Sun Jun 21 10:16:14 2015 UTC,"Swallowing like a cartoon character is the perfect way to describe how my brother drinks! Every.damn.gulp.

Reading through this sub makes me feel like I'm not so different after all."
misophonia,3alaz9,5boros,5,Sun Jun 21 20:16:18 2015 UTC,"Its much more common than most people realise. I think it will soon become mainstream common knowledge, and hopefully the public will become a little more aware of the affect of their habits and actions on other people."
misophonia,3alaz9,SurlyRed,3,Sun Jun 21 20:33:52 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think it's becoming more recognised because of how overcrowded the life of an average Westerner is. You're always cheek by jowl with somebody, and in that environment more and more people are recognising they have it. I'm hoping people will soon recognise it as just another anxiety disorder, and express appropriate understanding."
misophonia,3alaz9,Andrew_Laeddis,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:09:44 2015 UTC,"Yep, the most frequent response I get to my explanation that this is a recognised disorder is guffaws, badly suppressed laughter. It probably needs a high profile case to raise the, erm, profile. The trouble with that is that people with a high profile tend to be publicity-seeking, or at least camera friendly, the last type to suffer from misophonia."
misophonia,3alaz9,SurlyRed,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:18:02 2015 UTC,"I'm confident it might become more recognized by the general public. Still sceptical about people collectively changing their eating, breathing, or other habits due to this condition. Good manners are a tough one, I live in a diverse city with countless versions of what good manners actually are. That said, not everyone is raised properly in any version of what good manners means. I realistically don't see misophonia sensitivity being a high priority for the people teaching and raising the next generation."

With the music, I don't hear my own breathing (or chewing, if I'm eating) as much. Other times, I try to make more noise to cover the trigger; if my dad is eating, I'll clear my throat a lot or turn up the TV. It's not a very good solution, since the sound echos and makes me cringe, but it does help lessen the effect some."
misophonia,3al3mp,pisces2001,2,Sun Jun 21 07:50:54 2015 UTC,"It sucks, but this is what I had to do. My dad was constantly clearing his throat... As much as I wanted to spend time with him, I found that I had to either use earbuds to drown out the sound, or just leave the room/situation. Otherwise, I would just sit there seething, clenching my fists.  It sucks, but whenever I tried to explain how I felt to my family, they told me I was overreacting and being a bully. When I moved out and went to college to live by myself, it was a huge relief for me. Now, when I visit home, they give me my space.
