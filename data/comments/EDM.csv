EDM,3e2r6h,WowZaPowah,4,Tue Jul 21 19:49:06 2015 UTC,Bun Up The Dance is disappointing because they keep looping that Maluca sample and it ruins the drop.  Coming Over is pretty good. More reminiscent of MSFR though.  Just my $0.02 on what I've heard so far.

Haven't seen Porter with his recent stuff but I've been a fan for a long time and I'm sure it's amazing. Both of them put heart and soul into their sets.

Bingo players did play Rock the Party by jauz and ephwurd but it was the only song that got the crowd hyped other than rattle. The rest had basic big room house. I love a good big room house set, and showtek throws down some awesome tunes. Knife Party isn't BIG ROOM per se, but they do play a lot of electro house and I just love all their shit in general so their shows are always a great time."

Their first stuff was mostly dubstep with some drum and bass/drumstep... ~4 years ago those were all pretty big genres, most notably dubstep. Obviously with their last album they were all over the place with trap, nu disco, electro house, dubstep etc. But they are innovators in so many genres that it's kind of hard to call them mainstream."

EDM,3e18lh,marinewhore,2,Tue Jul 21 19:01:43 2015 UTC,"Lots of different opinions here; I like seeing the diversity in taste from the EDM community!  Anyways, here's mine:  Best: Porter Robinson, Showtek, Skrillex, Kill The Noise, Pegboard Nerds, Flux Pavilion, Knife Party, Datsik, RL Grime, Armin Van Buuren, Apashe, Bro Safari, Snails, G. Jones, Gramatik, Brillz, Eptic B2B Must Die!  Worst: Yellow Claw, Caked Up, 3LAU, Borgeous, Krewella, Botnek, Vaski,  and many others who's names I guess are TOO forgettable.  I'd also like to mention that for me, a DJ's set is far more than just the songs they play. To me it's not only the music, but the lights & visuals, the DJ's stage presence, and how interactive yet moderate they are on the microphone that makes a solid performance. For example, I never cared much for Armin's music until seeing his live production, of which now I have immense respect for and the trance genre in general.   Also an honorable mention here is Destroid, however I feel they can only be enjoyed in certain settings; I saw them twice last year. Once at Red Rocks, which was incredible. Once in an arena in my hometown which was awful due the fact that the indoor acoustics could not handle the bass and it was simple an hour of unbearable noise.  Savant is another I can't place on either side of this list. He is my favorite producer with some incredible tunes but unfortunately is a sub-par DJ. However I can't blame him as his tracks have a vastly different structuce than most dance music, and as a DJ myself, can confirm his music is awfully hard to mix live. However whenever he's playing a show or at festival I'm attending I always go out support him, despite knowing his set won't be that impressive, simply because his music is different than anything else getting played and I love hearing his stuff played through a loud-ass system. He also has terrific (and hilarious) stage presence.  I guess it's all preference; everyone gets down to different music and the diversity is why I love EDM."

I've dozens of DJ's (like Garrix himself) that I wouldn't say are the best, nor the worst, just kind of ""meh"".  I guess when I saw 3LAU, its almost as if he was trying too hard to fit that archetype. Zedd is another DJ I can say does the same.  3LAU is one of the most recent performances I've seen so his set is just one of the freshest in mind as one I didn't necessarily enjoy."

EDM,3e18lh,nimarf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:12:05 2015 UTC,The worst set i have seen would be Must Die!. We all went expecting to rage to heavy bass music and instead he plays almost a full set of deep house. He wasn't reading the crowd for shit and cleared the dance floor and basically the club by the time he was done.   Best set I have seen is Yoji at edc a couple years ago. That man had such stage presence and absolute control of us. He took us on a fucking journey that night that I will never forget.

If it was titled a something softer, or more supportive, such as ""Guy having the time of his life"" or ""not giving a fuck (about haters)"" it would've been nicer. Instead OP labels it negatively as well as the OP of said video, stating that he ""can't handle the drugs"" and clearly posting it to ridicule him (snickering amongst friends)."

EDM,3dstvu,Trancefam,4,Sun Jul 19 04:39:56 2015 UTC,"Hey I'm from Van as well and we have several throughout the year. There's always events from Blueprints and Solidevents that'll host some really good dj's but at smaller venues. You should also follow our facebook group ""Vancouver Trance Family.""  Contact  Get Together  Paradiso (Washington)   Seasons  Dooms  Freaknight (Seattle)  Blueprint is celebrating their anniversary in Nov so they're trying to attract a big name DJ.

EDM,3dstvu,grcadrian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:04:20 2015 UTC,"It just boils down to what you're looking for. Certain festivals cater to a more specific sound while others bring in a variety of DJs from different genres. Aside from the festivals already mentioned in this thread, there's also stuff like Mad Decent Block Party and Lights All Night (held in Dallas, TX). I like Lights All Night because it's a little more low key than your big festivals. Crowd is smaller and so is the venue, but the experience feels more personal. There's also a good chance that you'll run into some DJs at LAN that you won't see at the big EDM festivals. Deadmau5 played at LAN the year before last. You'll be hard pressed to see him play at a big time festival (Avicii illness at Ultra notwithstanding).   There's TomorrowWorld that's held in September in the Atlanta area.   If you want the full festival experience I would suggest EDC LV. Every festival or club is going to have a small percent of the crowd trippin' on something, but the reality is the majority are just there for the music and the atmosphere.   I would avoid Electric Zoo and EDC NY, but that's just my opinion. I'm not really a big fan of some of the NY crowds I've experienced.   Ultra in Miami is cool, but I'd say the city is the bigger attraction than the festival. EDC LV has a better venue, better production value, and it has way more Cali people. I'm from Texas, but the people from Cali bring the best energy and vibes. Ultra has a lot of people from South America, and they bring a different vibe. It's not bad. Just different."

EDM,3dp5o5,Dank_801,14,Sat Jul 18 16:47:52 2015 UTC,"As some of you know, I've owned an EDM club for the past 10 years. And that I am old and opinionated.  Here's the thing: I have no idea whose song is whose. I could not tell you one title of any edm songs, nor could I identify them by artist if I heard them.  And this is good. Why? Because when you get wrapped up in who does what you wind up in the Cult of Personality.  You do not want this in EDM. CoP is strictly corporate manipulation of your unique scene. The CoP is why tickets are so high to see the 'big personalities' in the scene.  I can rattle off my top 10  ZZ Top, Beatles, Cars songs just as easy as you do with EDM. And that is the point. Look where those old artists are now. They all have built in obsolescence because no one is going to buy new songs if the old stars are still around making good music.  I feel the eye rolling already. But that is fine. In 30 years, you will be doing the same thing I am now, bitching about how lame your genre has become, with Zedd now endorsing Depend's Undergarments.  I'll just keep myself focused on the music, not the song and certainly not the guy who remixed the remix."
EDM,3dp5o5,Dank_801,2,Sat Jul 18 13:09:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of the things you say, however I can't help but love when you find a producer no one knows about or that just fits your style. And when that music makes you happy for months on end, and you make huge efforts to drive long distance to see shows..   That shit makes you happy.   First It was deadmau5 back before he was big, then felguk/dada life, now Netsky (even though I believe he's pretty big outside the US).  I don't care about the politics or what they do, all I care about is I can throw on my favorite producer and it makes me happy."

EDM,3dp5o5,littlelionel10,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:11:33 2015 UTC,"Can I talk to you about Porter for a minute? Doesn't his last effort sound more like a movie soundtrack for an anime video, than an EDM structured approach that makes you want to just fucking bounce?  Someone made a fan film of his Worlds show. I kept waiting for him to stop screwing around and get to the beat. I love Porter, and I will see him twice in September (TW and Backwoods) so I'll make at least one of those show. Porter is why we decided to go to Backwoods.  But he seems to be transcending to music like a John Williams, than a John Digweed.  Do you like this new direction? Do you think this is his 'thing' now, or was Worlds just a chill project?"
EDM,3dp5o5,littlelionel10,3,Sat Jul 18 15:56:58 2015 UTC,"I must say, ""Flicker"" by Porter annoyed the hell out of me when the album first came out.  I was like what is this Japanese shit, but it has since became one of me & my girlfriends favorites.  That whole album is a masterpiece."
EDM,3dp5o5,nokizorque,2,Sat Jul 18 17:03:11 2015 UTC,"As a huge Porter fan myself, I think his Worlds tour was a breath of fresh air.  I would recommend checking out his AMA, because he explains why he switched directions so much and did his own thing. Essentially, he is finally doing what HE wants to do, rather than taking any outside influence into consideration.  This is definitely his ""thing"" now, and I can't wait to see what he does next."

EDM,3dp5o5,NowNewStart,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:10:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed, we could only be so lucky if others follow suit."
EDM,3dp5o5,1512g,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:43:21 2015 UTC,"Porter's last album is definitely more than just music he made. I find it's more of an experience, if anything. I believe he's trying to show you the world he has created, artistically. A conceptual world of his own emotions and imagination. And boy does he do a good job of that.  Personally, his new direction is like that of Zedd's (excuse the comparison, but I am a fanboy after all). Instead of going for an album that he knows will be a success, he goes for something he will be happy with, and that really captures the way he feels. He is going for a more artistic approach to music (with meaning behind everything), as opposed to making hit bangers.  Porter and Zedd are alike in a few ways. Both were inspired by electronic music at a young age. Both made dubstep and electro style tracks early on (2010ish era). Both have recently delved into a more artistic and heartfelt approach to their music. With Zedd, True Colors. With Porter, Worlds. They also both have a strong love for Skrillex. Although they both have the potential to be as successful as Martix Garrix or Tiesto, they choose to stick to their roots and create music from the heart.   Back to the question, Porter said so himself that Worlds was his new approach to music. It's definitely a form of experimentation, but I believe it's here to stay. If you watch the interviews from AsQme, he says that he draws his influence from anime and Japanese culture. It's quite apparent in tracks like Sad Machine or Flicker (the latter is probably more noteworthy). I doubt he'll be changing his style in the near future. So yes, I think this conceptual Worlds album style thingo is definitely here to stay, and I am really looking forward to hearing some more of his work.  Sorry for comparisons to Zedd. But I'd love to see them both collaborate as they're both in relatively the same stage of their careers. I would also love to see another Mat Zo & Porter collaboration!"
EDM,3dp5o5,NowNewStart,2,Sun Jul 19 01:27:07 2015 UTC,Great answer! That is really cool! Thank you for the insight. I'll look at it different from now on.  Was not a big fan of Zedd until I saw him at Counterpoint. Just..wow.  Thanks again for taking time to enlighten me.
