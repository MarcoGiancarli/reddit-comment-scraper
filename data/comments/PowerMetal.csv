I don't speak the language, but I far prefer the Swedish version of the album. I'm glad I listened to the English one so I know what the songs are about, but other than that, the Swedish one is the only one I ever listen to."

Opens the album slowly rising up in every aspect: gets faster, more intense, and just plain more menacing before lulling you into a soft reprieve. Once it picks up around 1:30 it really catches you though.  Awesome song, incredible start to an album.   I found out you've fallen in the ssshhaaddoowws   Gets me every damn time."

Context: It was right around when they released Space Police, I can't remember if before or after at this point. Avantasia is my favorite band, I know I mentioned it and had a few fanboy moments. This was also the second interview I ever conducted, the first being Par from Sabaton (thinking about uploading that to YouTube in the near future as well). It was the end of the day for Tobi, 8pm actually when we started the interview, and he had nothing else to do for the night since I was the last interview. So we talked and he indulged me for over 40 minutes, which I am still super grateful for, especially being such a fan. Our station's phone systems were a little iffy last year, so the quality isn't too spectacular either.   Enjoy!"

It was pretty generic, with some awful vocals and lyrics.  Anyway, stuck in the shadow of Human Fortress they kind of fell by the wayside for a few years before popping up again with Vendetta.  Holy Hell was I not expecting this album.  I couldn't believe this was the same band that had released Reign of Elements.  Every aspect was so fine tuned on Vendetta.  Super catchy too, and not just the choruses.  There are a bunch of those quick keyboard melodies that would get caught in my head for days.

PowerMetal,3dpil4,malkvinegar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:05:42 2015 UTC,How was Majora's Mask? Never got to play those N64 Zelda games and always wanted to. I know Ocarina of Time is basically a must play but different people tell me different things about Majora's Mask and I'm honestly more interested in playing it at this point.
PowerMetal,3dpil4,jasonk12,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:45:29 2015 UTC,"It starts kind of slow but it expands into one of the darkest Zeldas I have played. The meat of the game is outside of the dungeons though since there are so many things to do and so many masks to collect. I prefer it to Ocarina because now the NPCs have actual lives, binge drink, get hangovers, cry out in the rain or sleep outside because they didn't book a hotel room in time (seriously). That's mostly due to the game having a 3 day repeat cycle. You should definitely play it, though be aware this time cycle is not for everyone (and you may find yourself in a hurry trying to defeat a dungeon boss while the clock is ticking the last five minutes). I imagine if you first play this and then Ocarina it will feel like a downgrade because Ocarina has a basic night / day system lol."
PowerMetal,3dpil4,malkvinegar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:38:43 2015 UTC,"That's really cool, I had no idea the NPCs lived actual lives. That's pretty impressive considering certain hardware limits of those old cartridges. I imagine it takes much more space to code a believable NPC character than one who just walks around on a set schedule.  Will have to check this one out, it sounds really interesting. Thanks."
PowerMetal,3dpil4,jasonk12,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:07:20 2015 UTC,"You should definitely try it at some point! I'm not sure this is the best one to start with if you're not into Zelda (I started with OOT) but it's secretly the best Zelda game.   Also yeah, the fact that NPCs are so full-fledged is due to the three day cycle. Unlike most games, the developers had a chance to make them live ordinary lives in these three days instead of just letting them have repeating text lines and random walking paths.   Once you play it you should also check out game theories online. It's a surprisingly dark game but that really hits you later on."

A Game Theory? I've checked out some of his theories based on games I've played before and they tend to be entertaining.

PowerMetal,3dpil4,malkvinegar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:47:37 2015 UTC,"OoT is always celebrated as the best Zelda game ever. But that's nonsense, it isn't even the best N64 Zelda game.  MM is a better game in every aspect. The gameplay is vastly expanded upon, there is actually a story to speak of besides ""you're the hero, go do hero things"", it is more action-packed, it's more challenging... I could go on. The only thing OoT has going for it is that it's a little longer.  People just adore OoT because it came first. My console Zelda list goes Wind Waker > Skyward Sword > Majora's Mask > Twilight Princess > Ocarina of Time > A link to the Past. Don't get me wrong, they're all BRILLIANT games."
PowerMetal,3dpil4,Fazermint,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:14:33 2015 UTC,"OoT is always celebrated as the best Zelda game ever. But that's nonsense, it isn't even the best N64 Zelda game.   Interesting, tell me more good sir. I've always heard Ocarina was much better in almost every respect and, usually anyway, that Majora's Mask was an awful pile of puke barely befitting the Zelda franchise. I honestly couldn't tell much difference between the two from what little game play I'd seen (which was very, very little).   Don't get me wrong, they're all BRILLIANT games.   Oh I know, you're just ordering one awesome thing to the next most awesome. My personal favourite Zelda would be A Link to the Past but my list is woefully short. Haven't had a Nintendo console in the house since the original PlayStation so I've missed out on pretty much every Zelda since the SNES (except the Gameboy entries, which I collected and really enjoyed)."
PowerMetal,3dpil4,malkvinegar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:25:05 2015 UTC,"Since OoT came first, it had a huge wow-factor being the first 3D entrance in the franchise. That, and its sheer scale is probably its only major merits over MM.  People who call MM a pile of shit usually don't have any arguments to back up their statement. The criticisms I've seen generally boil down to it being too short, and too different from OoT. The game isn't short at all, I believe it's at least at 3/4 of OoT's length. And the differences? Let's break them down.  OoT was hugely linear and had a relatively empty world. MM's world is much more alive, as jasonk has told you, with a lot more to do. There is still a specific order in which to do the main tasks, but you'll most likely find yourself engrossed with the NPCs and the sidequests they offer half of the time. The time-based nature of the game adds a whole new dimension to the linearity of the game.  There gameplay is expanded upon in MM, allowing you to transform into three different races on top of your human form. Some thought this sucked, I guess? I know additional gameplay styles don't necessarily mean a better game, but in MM they are all well designed and fun to play. The 3rd form you get might be a bit unwieldy, but the first two are perfectly programmed.  MM is harder, but it isn't really a hard game. OoT fanbois just need to stop complaining and git gud.  And finally, MM's narrative is a bit darker, more believable, and less cliché. OoT is your stereotypical hero saves the world kind of deal. MM is more personal. The villain isn't after world dominance, he's just a mischievous son of a bitch who found an artifact too powerful for him (won't get into it because spoilers). Link is cursed by the villain in the beginning, and you spend your first couple of hours getting yourself uncursed. You then go after the villain to stop the imminent destruction that you're always being reminded of with the moon coming closer and closer to crashing down into the ground. Perhaps a subjective call, but I find this way more compelling.  So if you ever decide to play them (N64 emulation is decent), you can't go wrong with either game as they are both great. Just don't let the OoT fanbois make you think MM is a bad game!"
PowerMetal,3dpil4,Fazermint,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:13:29 2015 UTC,"This is a much more thorough analysis than I was expecting, you've had to defend Majora's Mask a lot I take it? You make it seem really enjoyable, I particularly liked how it seemed like a more alive world that /u/jasonk12 already mentioned but you've raised points that I particularly like in any game. Majora's Mask is more engrossing due to NPCs and side quests, there's a time limit (another game I loved with a time limit was Breath of Fire V), it's harder and has more game play options, plus it has a believable villain? These are all huge pluses for me, I'm really looking forward to checking this game out.  Thanks for the thorough treatment, Majora's Mask will have to be added to my ""games to purchase right away"" for the 3DS. Will check back after I've played through it and let you guys know what I thought."
PowerMetal,3dpil4,malkvinegar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:29:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, not at all. I usually don't participate in game discussions - imagine all the fanboy tantrums being thrown my way if I made this case on a gaming forum! But I couldn't very well let a fellow warrior miss out on a great game.  I also wanted to say that the handheld games I've played (the Oracle games and Link's Awakening) are indeed awesome, and that I should probably put ALttP in that category since they're all top-down view (then it wouldn't land on the last spot!)"
PowerMetal,3dpil4,Vortiene,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:26 2015 UTC,"Was watching Egoraptor's discussion of ALttP and OoT last night and was expecting the comments section to be a minefield. He's pretty ruthless in discussing OoT but the comments mostly surprised me (especially since they are YouTube comments).  I'd have probably checked out Majora's Mask eventually even without this discussion. I've always been interested in it and since it was released on handheld it's a far more likely possibility for me to grab it and play. The handheld Zelda games were always really fun to play because they were so familiar to me. Link's Awakening is a truly great Gameboy game, that feather was so boss.  Well all I really wanted to say is that MM is definitely moved up my list of games to play thanks to this discussion. I will leave my own thoughts here after I've managed to play through them."
PowerMetal,3dpil4,Spiner202,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:24:43 2015 UTC,Stop trying to rank amazing games and just play them all instead of playing inherently bad games.   Complain about actually bad games like raven's cry or the incredibly monotonous running forward strategy RNG reliant combat that is xcom enemy unknown. Or the 50% of the game recycled content that is Bravely Default.
PowerMetal,3dpil4,malkvinegar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:27:49 2015 UTC,"I'll offer a bit of a dissenting opinion. Bear in mind that Ocarina of Time is my favourite game of all-time though.  Majora's Mask is a good game, but unless you know what is going on or what to do, it's definitely very frustrating. I'm not a big Zelda fan, but to me, that series has largely been about exploration. The nature of Majora's Mask's 3 day cycle prohibits exploration. You can mess around for a while, but as soon as you go back in time, quite a bit of your progress is reset. Also, it's a bit unclear what actually resets and what doesn't until you've messed up a few times.   Also, maybe it's because I've played OoT plenty of times and know it inside and out, but MM is incredibly difficult. The last two temples are very complicated, and even using a guide once I gave up, I was struggling a bit. Only the Water Temple can really rival the difficulty of MM."
PowerMetal,3dpil4,Fazermint,2,Sun Jul 19 12:59:01 2015 UTC,"Dissenting opinions are cool too, I guess. But only because you've given me lots of good discussions in the past. We're even now however. Eyes narrowing  I'd agree that Zelda, as a whole, is about exploration. But I don't think there's anything wrong with straying from the norm and trying something new out. Difficulty can be frustrating, but man I've played those old NES games and can deal with a game messing me up. It worries me that you compare all of Majora's Mask to the Water Temple though. Don't know much about the N64 Zelda games but that one dungeon is legendary for the frustration it presents."
PowerMetal,3dpil4,malkvinegar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:41:28 2015 UTC,"/u/Spiner202 is right, I had forgotten that resetting time could partially reset your progress. That's definitely a downside of the game.   With that in mind, here's the most useful tip I can give you: Early in the game you obtain the song of time, with which you can go back in time to the beginning of day 1 (since the world ends at the end of day 3 and stuff). It is hinted at in the game, but it's easy to miss this: the song of time has 2 alternate variations that offer you greater control of the flow of time. You can a) skip ahead half a day, which you can repeat, in order to quickly reach later events, and b) slow down the progression of time (I think by 30%) so that you've got more time to get stuff done. I hope this isn't spoiling too much, but I can imagine the game to be very frustrating without this knowledge. Definitely look it up if/when you get the game."
PowerMetal,3dpil4,70000TonsOfMetal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:47:39 2015 UTC,I'm sure it would have come up at some point while playing the game.

PowerMetal,3dpil4,malkvinegar,3,Mon Jul 20 17:18:08 2015 UTC,"Went to the CD store around from my apartment today and had a look since every week is different.  This week, they had the entire discography from Blind Guardian, Symphony X, Nightwish, and Stratovarius (yes, everything, including some of the super rare singles and whatnot). Nothing individually cost more than $6-7 either.  But the only thing I ended up buying was a new/sealed copy of Labyrinth's Return to Heaven Denied.  I may go back next week and pick up some of the Stratovarius stuff just because I didn't realize how ridiculously rare some of their material is. And I may have to get another copy of Nightfall in Middle Earth because my first one got stolen (I still have the jewel case, just not the CD).  It was better than being a kid in a candy shop."

PowerMetal,3dpil4,Spiner202,2,Sun Jul 19 13:52:32 2015 UTC,"I need some help choosing bands to see at Wacken. Hopefully you guys can provide some suggestions:  Rock Meets Classic or Cryptopsy - I'm really not sure what Rock Meets Classic is, but I think it's a bunch of old German guys playing Deep Purple (or similar) songs, which sounds awesome. On the other hand, I really dig None So Vile. I've never seen either band, and I will likely never have a chance to see Rock Meets Classic again, whereas I will have a chance to see Cryptopsy, but likely won't pay to go see them.  Rob Zombie or Dark Tranquility - I don't really like either of these too much. I saw about 20 minutes of a Rob Zombie set a few years back and left. Musically I know I'd prefer Dark Tranquility, but Rob Zombie will have the better stage show. My brother is going to watch Dark Tranquility, so I'm leaning that way.  Kvelertak or The Poodles - My only reasoning for seeing The Poodles is because they used to have Pontus Norgren and Pontus Egberg in the band, who are two of my favourite musicians. I've got nothing else either way for these bands.  This is actually the toughest choice for me:  5 minutes of Nuclear Assault or 5 minutes of Running Wild - Nuclear Assault plays until 12:05 and Running Wild starts at 12. It's about a 5 minute walk between stages, so I'm either missing the first couple RW songs, or the last Nuclear Assault song. I'm a bigger RW fan, but they're also playing a much longer set. Also, I don't know when/if NA plays ""Hang the Pope"", but I need to hear that. On the other hand, if RW opens with ""Riding The Storm"", I will be upset if I miss that. What do I do :/"
PowerMetal,3dpil4,rivfader84,2,Sat Jul 18 14:37:52 2015 UTC,"Well, its barely Cryptopsy you'll be seeing. No Lord Worm, Langlois or Lavasseur.  If it was the original lineup, i'd say absolutely.  They were an absolute force when I saw them back in the day, now though.. According to wikipedia, Rock Meets Classic has Ian Gillan on vocals.  That would seal the deal for me, especially if they do Child in Time.  I don't know if he can still hit those notes, but I would go with Gillan.   Dark Tranquility are awesome live.  Exhibit A .  If you even remotely like melodeath, i'd go see them."
PowerMetal,3dpil4,Spiner202,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:23:56 2015 UTC,"Good call on Cryptopsy. I'll probably stick with Rock Meets Classic.  I wouldn't say I like melodeath; I'm incredibly picky about it. I only like certain bands. With that said, I'll check out a bit of DT before going."

I think the longest is a two-hour special. There are shorter animated clips available if you want to check out just a bit of the humour but it will spoil some of the surprises in the podcast. Cortex One guy interviewing one of the hosts from Hello Internet. It's mostly about productivity but they go on wild tangents sometimes (like most podcasts). Only check this out after you've listened to (and enjoyed) Hello Internet and even then only if are interested in productivity. RT Podcast Pure humour. They spend around an hour-and-a-half discussing anything and it's usually ridiculous. No idea how they continually get ideas and stories to share but they do. I find the best episodes have Burnie and Gus on the show. You don't have to maintain episode order, it's all random topics, all the time. Serial A short-running podcast telling the story of the mysterious disappearance of a girl in Baltimore in 1999. The ex-boyfriend is eventually convicted and put into prison but he's always maintained he's innocent. A reporter investigates and tries to dig up more clues to find out if he is innocent or if they put the right guy behind bars. 12 Byzantine Rulers Another short-running podcast telling the history of the Byzantine Roman Empire through the reigns of various Emperors. Starts with Diocletian and ends with Constantine XI and the rise of the Ottoman Empire. Really interesting history here, this podcast is singly responsible for my interest in Eastern European history. Just a fair warning, I remember a fair bit of religious discussion in it as well because there was no concept of separation of Church and State in Constantinople. That would just be daft to them.

PowerMetal,3dmkm8,Snake_Byte,3,Fri Jul 17 14:52:36 2015 UTC,"Pathfinder - Lord of the Wolves - PATHFINDER Beyond Twilight - Crying - filling my Jorn quota.  Also has an epic keyboard section Steam of Passion - The Scarlet Mark - Not many bands in this category so I'll probably strike out here.   Stratovarius - Glory of the World - Keyboard keys found as far south as Italy after this one Fairyland - On the Path to Fury -  Skyclad - The Disenchanted Forest - Power folk is almost a non-genre so this is pretty close without going harsh vocals.  In retrospect I probably should have gone with Falconer, but meh. Avantasia - In Quest For - playing the most dangerous game because this one is 100% piano"
PowerMetal,3dmkm8,creamweather,3,Fri Jul 17 18:07:28 2015 UTC,"You guys made some great choices in some of the other lists. Not sure how Vandroya is prog/power, but ::shrug::. Daisa is my favorite female vocalist, so there's a lot I'll avoid. Here we go:  01. Male-fronted Symphonic Power Metal  Dragonland - The Book of Shadows, Part II/III.   Would've linked the whole trilogy but Part II is the one with vocals.  02. Male-fronted Progressive Power Metal  Native Construct - Mute.   This is either going to win it or totally lose it for me, IMO. This has everything you're looking for though - symphonic elements, amazing vocals, choir vocals, a piano part, and is progressive as balls. I was seriously tempted to use this for 5 categories but I guess I'll play by the rules this time.  03. Female-fronted Progressive Power Metal  Stream of Passion - A War of our Own  There's some power elements in there, from 2:45-onwards is probably what you're looking for. And it's Arjen Lucassen, so it's impossible to hate it.  04. A Power Metal track with a great Keyboard solo  Kamelot - When The Lights Are Down.  You're looking from about 2:55-on. Fun fact: Jens Johansson actually wrote this solo for Kamelot.  05. A Power Metal track with some good choir choruses  Orden Ogan - The Things We Believe In  This was a no-brainer. First thing that came to mind.  06. Power / Folk Metal  Skiltron - Through the Longest Way  Skiltron is one of my top 5/10 bands. But I never bring them up on here. I should probably start posting more of their (and Tridanna's) work.  07. A Power Metal track with piano  Sonata Arctica - White Pearl, Black Oceans  Still, IMO, the best power metal song ever written. Piano segment in the middle is beautiful."

Shit, I don't even need it for number 7. Labyrinth- Lady Lost in Time Triosphere- Driven - Slim Pickings here. Sonata Arctica- Victoria's Secret - Need to snag this one up real quick i'm guessing. Picking Jens Johansson is practically cheating on this one. Wind Rose- Age of Conquest - Totally, 100% not pandering. When I noticed the uploader I knew it was a sign.  Skiltron- Lion Rampant - Points for vocals, so that sadly leaves my beloved Vexillum on the back burner.  Highlord- Far from the Light of God - Brief, but awesome."
PowerMetal,3dmkm8,mushmancat,2,Fri Jul 17 15:45:58 2015 UTC,"I'll do one just to pick stuff. Don't make me win though.   Sonata Arctica - Deathaura - Yeah, they did do symphonic metal that one time...I like this song the most of the songs on Days of Grays. You know I'm going to pick Viathyn - Cynosure regardless of anyone's preferences. Guitar riffs out the ass and interesting lyrical themes are why I like it. Edenbridge - The Bonding - Great epic progressive metal track. Sorry, i'll go easy on the epics from here on out. Sonata Arctica - The Cage - that legendary intro solo. Also such an iconic finale song from Sonata's shows. Dream Evil - The Chosen Ones - my OG epic-power-metal go-to track from way back in the day. HEROES OF THE DAY, LEGENDS FOREEEEEEEEEEEEVER Falconer - Tower of the Queen - when I think of Falconer + catchy songs, I immediately think of this. Also pretty folky feel. Zonata - Zonata  - I'll pick a great obscure song with pretty prominent piano throughout the song (instrumental) could have picked tallulah easily but w/e lets be interesting. I long ago originally stumbled on Zonata the same way most people did: on limewire their tracks were labelled as Sonata Arctica due to some idiot getting confused."

First song I ever heard by the band (from a friend of mine). Turns out the album keeps up the pace with this song. It's female fronted and caught my attention, as did most of this album. It was hard to choose what song I wanted to pick off that album. It's Stratovarius doing some classic back and forth on keyboards and guitar. (also because Black Diamond was taken...) Seriously? It's all about that chorus. Gets me pumped for the album that follows it. Was also tempted to use their cover of Black Sabbath's song I (which got me into the band) but I went original. The good ballad off of Paradise Lost."

PowerMetal,3dmkm8,ArcticSin,2,Fri Jul 17 22:26:44 2015 UTC,"So /u/Fazermint, apparently you have a penchant for hitting me in my weak points. Symphonic, power-progressive (female-fronted), and folk are areas outside my usual repertoire so this whole dang thing was a challenge. I'll call it a moral victory if I manage to get 10 points total. Here's what I put together:   Kamelot - Ghost Opera Just about the only thing I own that hasn't been mentioned by someone else. One of my first Kamelot albums too, I really enjoyed the symphonic pieces on the album. Heir Apparent - Hands of Destiny Heir Apparent was the first thing to come to my mind given what you eliminated. I checked out a few songs and was thinking maybe I'd try arranging something else but once the chorus for this song hit it was hopeless, I'd have to use it. That chorus gets me every single time. Vandroya - When Heaven Decides to Call Daisa Munhoz is an extremely talented vocalist, she's got a strength and beauty to her voice that few female vocalists can manage. I found it difficult to pick out a female vocalist in a progressive-power band but then remembered her and the choice was made for me. Time Requiem - Milagros Charm Richard Andersson started numerous projects, this is the one that's always stood out to me. Hard to find their albums here (in Canada) and that makes me sad. Age of Artemis - God, Kings and Fools Totally fits right? Right? The choir and vocalist go back-and-forth. Part of the reason I used these guys is because I think they really deserve more attention. However hearing other people's submissions makes me think the choir on here is too weak, let me know if it needs to be changed. Wuthering Heights - The Road Goes Ever On Bleh, this was such a difficult selection. Folk is just about the weakest branch of metal I could discuss. I know almost nothing and rarely ever listen to it. If this doesn't count for some reason I think my post will commit seppuku. Shaman - Time Will Come Starts with the piano, continues into an awesome song. A post from Shaman was coming in one of these categories, this song hit me as particularly interesting and fit in really well here so it's the one getting posted.   PS. Thanks go to Brazil for saving my ass on this one. At one point I was considering so many entries from there that it was like a monopoly."
PowerMetal,3dmkm8,malkvinegar,2,Fri Jul 17 23:53:16 2015 UTC,"Like I always say, Brazil just does everything right! in power metal."

PowerMetal,3dmkm8,jasonk12,2,Sat Jul 18 02:02:48 2015 UTC,"01. Male-fronted Symphonic Power Metal  Kamijo - Heart  Taking a chance on the vocals here, because Kamijo is kind of a polarizing singer, but this song is pretty masterful in my opinion. That single falsetto word at the end is the cherry on the top of this one for me. Arrangement great as usual with Versailles/Kamijo.  02. Male-fronted Progressive Power Metal  Voyager - The Morning Light  I don't know a ton of prog, so I'm a bit less confident of these recs, but I really do enjoy this song.  03. Female-fronted Progressive Power Metal  A Sound of Thunder - Elijah  This band doesn't fit into just one genre - they have a lot of power, but this song feels  proggy enough to me. Nina Osegueda on vocals is so intense.  04. A Power Metal track with a great Keyboard solo  Time Requiem - Brutal Mentor  Is this cheating? This entire song is practically a fucking keyboard solo. Within that, there are a few smaller keyboard solos that would individually be worth considering for entry here. Almost went with Galneryus - Angel of Salvation until I remembered this one.  05. A Power Metal track with some good choir choruses  Ancient Bards - Flaming Heart  SO MUCH GOOD STUFF in this category. Ancient Bards are so friggin great, and this is maaaaybe their best. Very sad story here, and a damn catchy choir chorus.  06. Power / Folk Metal  Dalriada: A Dudás  Love the instrumentation here, and the contrast between the joyful fiddle and the more solemn chorus. Honorable mention to Wuthering Heights - Carpe Noctem.  07. A Power Metal track with piano  403 Forbiddena - Southern Cross  One of the very first power metal tracks that I heard and loved! This one has an irresistably cheerful melody and some great piano sections."

Suspyre - Evolutions  I'm probably gonna be known as the guy who spams Suspyre at this rate, but these guys are the definition of Power/Prog to me, yet they're really underrated in both the Prog and Power spheres.  -3. MindMaze - The Machine Stops  This is one of my favorite songs from the album. Fun fact, it's based off the short story of the same name by E.M. Forster. I recommend everyone to read it. It's one of the best stories I've ever read, both conceptually, stylistically and everything.  Edit: I just found out Pharaoh guitarist Matt Johnsen does guitar solos on this MindMaze song. Pretty cool.  -4. Yuhkinen - Yuhkinen  Yuhki is also from Galneryus and my favorite keyboardist. This song is on his solo album. This song is just loaded with keyboard solos.  -5. Theocracy - Laying the Demon to Rest  This has pretty much the most epic chorus ever created in my opinion.  -6. Tierramystica - Myths of Creation  Brazil just does things right.  -7. Allen Lande - Master of Sorrow  I'm just gonna pick this before anyone else does. It might be an obvious pick, but it's especially moving for me, and I'm always replaying it. It's definitely the best Allen Lande song in my opinion."

Dark Moor - Phantom Queen Withem - The Point of You Beautiful Sin - The Spark of Ignition Artension - Through The Gates Bride Adorned - Bridewell Heljareyga - Regnið Rough Silk - My Last Farewell   Reasons...   Dark Moor is just the obvious choice here for me. They were the first thing I thought of. I still think they are the best symphonic power metal band running. One of the better prog power releases of the year it came out. This was a tough one as I'm not to familiar with female vocalists, but I really do like the ballsier approach to female vocals. Vitalij Kuprij is to keyboards what Malmsteen is to guitars. Take that however you like. The fact that John West sings for them is just a bonus. The songs from Bride Adorned that I really wanted are not on youtube or any other shareable link system (spotify, etc). The whole album is awesome. Tyr and Falconer are the more obvious choices but I decided to go with the lesser known Heljareyga. I nearly went with Savatage - Chance but I wanted to go a bit more obscure.

Adam (our vocalist) is opera-trained and IMO he's our ace-in-the-hole; everyone in the bad is a very capable musician, but skilled musicians aren't hard to find, whereas highly-trained singers who want to sing heavy metal seem to be rare in our neck of the woods.  As far as the band, we started summer of 2012 and started performing live summer of 2013. We've been through a couple of drummers, but things have been going fairly smoothly since we found the guy we have now.  Future plans right now are A) finish our EP (the song I posted will be on it) and B)  play more shows in farther places. Touring will be on the docket eventually, but I'd rather branch out and do some one-offs outside of New England to help get the word going before we commit to a long string of shows in strange places."

PowerMetal,3ddqf3,70000TonsOfMetal,6,Wed Jul 15 14:29:18 2015 UTC,"The original is back! EDGUY frontman Tobias Sammet has returned to the studio to work on the new chapter of AVANTASIA. The sequel to the successful latest album ""The Mystery Of Time"" (2013, charting in 16 countries in Europe, Asia and America, including #2 in Germany) will be called ""Ghostlights"" and is scheduled to be released in early 2016. An EP/ single is also planned to be released this autumn, and in March 2016 a giant all-star ensemble will set off on the GHOSTLIGHTS WORLD TOUR.  Tobias Sammet: ""In the past months I've spent a lot of time in the studio, an odd recluse in the basement, secretly working obsessively on something that reads and feels and sounds like a new - very strong - chapter in the story of AVANTASIA. I must say AVANTASIA is a fantastic outlet for creativity, and it's truly inspiring to create a piece of music for so many great vocalists and instrumentalists.""  The new material is very bombastic and dynamic, and even though it's extremely diverse, every minute of it sounds like AVANTASIA. I'm really proud of what we're creating right now. And as if that wasn't enough: I'm anxiously looking forward to hitting the road again. I didn't necessarily expect this to happen as in the past it has always been difficult to align the individual schedules of the guest stars, but things have worked out, and we're ready to make it happen one more time! We'll put on a big show, we're gonna play over three hours, and we'll take the fans to a magical world all its own - to AVANTASIA. The live setlist is going to embrace the entire history of AVANTASIA, from ""The Metal Opera"" to ""Ghostlights"" and of course everything in between!""

PowerMetal,3deemy,omegakingauldron,2,Wed Jul 15 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"That's how I saw them during their last tour in like 2008 or 09. They were supposed to play the big venue in town, but they sold like 0 tickets as they were really unknown at the time so the venue cancelled the show.   They ended up playing this tiny dive bar (which later got shut down after the owner was arrested for selling coke to give you an idea how shady it was). It ended up being my buddies and I and a couple bar flies there for the show. It was unreal. Hibria played one of the tightest sets I have ever seen and partied with us before and after the show. You'll have a blast with them at a small venue."

PowerMetal,3ddpug,UnlostHorizon,2,Wed Jul 15 13:47:32 2015 UTC,"Cellador is the band that always gets brought up in these conversations. Enceladus also may be a fitting recommendation. Sunless Rise, although they're more melodeath than anything, sound similar to DragonForce in some ways, especially as far as technicality is concerned."
PowerMetal,3ddpug,Enemy-to-Injustice,2,Wed Jul 15 14:12:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for introducing me to Sunless Rise. They're amazing!
PowerMetal,3ddpug,Enemy-to-Injustice,2,Wed Jul 15 15:12:35 2015 UTC,"You sir, like me, have an obsession for what DF and I like to call EPM (Extreme Power Metal). Although you've already reached the absolute pinnacle of EPM with Pathfinders's BtSBtT, there is still a lot of recommendation I can give, most of it being peripheral to that kind of sound.  Angra - Some of their songs absolutely shred and don't hold back like ""Spread Your Fire,"" ""The Temple of Hate,"" and ""Black Hearted Soul."" I recommend checking out their discography even though they are more diverse and not always that extreme.   Galneryus - This is one of my best recommendations, especially ""Destiny,"" ""Hunting for Your Dream,"" ""Across the Rainbow,"" and I'm actually just gonna recommend everything they do. Their guitarist Syu and keyboardist Yuhki are gods of shred and melody.  Those are some of my favorites but the following bands have the most DF-esque sound: Cellador, Enceladus, and Kronoceptor. More peripheral might be Power Quest, Rhapsody of Fire, and Luca Turilli. I also recommend more Japanese bands in addition to Galneryus like Versailles, who I've recently gotten into, Dragon Guardian, and the much underrated EP by Linked Horizon.  Edit: I also recommend Sunburst and for instrumental work Tiluland."
PowerMetal,3ddpug,Snake_Byte,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:00:35 2015 UTC,"Power Quest, Rhapsody of Fire, and Luca Turilli   Absolutely and 100% YES"
PowerMetal,3ddpug,radios_appear,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:00:19 2015 UTC,"Hmm yes, I did suspect that Pathfinder were the zenith of the EPM style. Hope they have a new album soon, I can't get enough of that stuff.  I'm gradually working through your recommendations. Those three Angras were pretty great actually, especially Black Hearted Soul, I shall have to give that whole Secret Garden album a listen.   Galneryus have a cool sound, will try a whole album but they seem to lack that something that sets DF and Pathfinder apart for me.  I love Far Away by Power Quest, I should totally try that whole album actually.   Kronoceptor sounds closest to DF so far, I'm really liking this stuff. I'm not sure the death growls really fit though haha, and I love death metal.  More listening after work!"
PowerMetal,3ddpug,vinzclortho37,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:58:17 2015 UTC,"Notes on Power Quest: They drifted away from the sound on their first album with their later albums, losing their progressive elements and longer song runtimes and solidifying into a very upbeat power metal group with somewhat more standard styling (mostly due to losing the influence of DragonForce members. Read up on the relationship between the two bands.)"
PowerMetal,3ddpug,radios_appear,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:35:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think Power Quest has put out a bad CD yet. Even the new one with the new singer has some winners on it. Check out Diamond Sky, Well of Souls, Cemetary Gates, The Magic Never Dies, Find My Heaven and Wings of Forever. All fantastic tracks."
PowerMetal,3ddpug,vinzclortho37,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:18:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't say they ever got bad. Almost all of the songs you listed are off of their third album, which came out a while ago.  Also, the band broke up not too long ago (maybe last year?)"
PowerMetal,3ddpug,radios_appear,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:28:47 2015 UTC,"That sucks they broke up. I didn't know that... I thought things were going ok with the new singer.   Yeah, 3 of the 6 songs listed are from Magic Never Dies, their 3rd CD, probably my favorite of all of them."
PowerMetal,3ddpug,Enemy-to-Injustice,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:24:03 2015 UTC,"I think Magic Never Dies is their most consistent album, except for The Message (lame, boring ass, unnecessary song). I really enjoyed their first album even though they were just finding their footing as a band."
PowerMetal,3ddpug,Urist_McGamer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:30:13 2015 UTC,"Although I will always have eternal support and reverence for Pathfinder, I don't think their future releases will compare to their first two albums with Simon. Their new vocalist Primal Alley is good, but his take on singing Simon's parts aren't that great. Not to discredit him, but Simon's one of my favorite singers ever. Only time will show if they can adapt with their new vocalist though. I'm sure the rest of the band's instrumentation and songwriting will still be epic though.  Angra is amazing. If you want more, I recommend Rebirth and Temple of Shadows if you want them at their best. Although all their other album are really good too. Secret Garden is a really good album, but not on the same level as the albums I just mentioned.   For Galneryus, try albums of both vocalists Yama-B and Sho. The Flag of Punishment and Advance to the Fall for Yama-B, and Resurrection and Angel of Salvation for Sho. Both outstanding vocalists. All Galneryus albums are stellar.   The best part is that a lot more bands are getting into the EPM sound, such as recent bands like Enceladus and Kronoceptor. I still think the sub-sub-genre has yet to reach its prime. There's gonna be a lot of great bands to come out in the next decade or so I'm hoping."
PowerMetal,3ddpug,Edledhron,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:07:04 2015 UTC,Try taking a look at some Japanese bands. Babymetal is hit or miss but one of their songs is actually co-written by Dragonforce. Versailles tends to be a bit softer than DF but it might scratch that itch. Also try some Unleash the Archers.

PowerMetal,3ddpug,StalfoLordMM,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:46:19 2015 UTC,"Saw this topic last night and had to come back and add a little.  Try out Theocracy. Here is one of their better songs Absolution Day. They have other pretty good ones as well like On Eagle's Wings, Tower of Ashes, I Am, etc. If you can deal with the fact that they are crazy Christian and are absolutely HORRIBLE live (probably the absolute worst show I ever attended... sounded like shit and didn'ty play a single one of their good songs), you'll probably really like some of their stuff.  I didn't see anyone mention Gamma Ray, but they are pretty good too. They JUST put out a greatest hits CD so maybe give that a look. If you like the first song, Armageddon, you'll probably find some other great ones by them, including the ""who knows why it wasn't on the greatest hits CD"" classic Beyond the Black Hole.  Sonata Arctica USED to be a favorite, but since their masterpiece Reckoning Night CD, everything has been experimental, mid tempo garbage. Check their early stuff, especially the songs Wolf and Raven and The Cage.  Honestly, I decided to add the recommendations to the list because I went through most of the links provided and couldn't find anything I hadn't heard of that I liked. So maybe these will add a little more flavor to the conversation."
PowerMetal,3ddpug,70000TonsOfMetal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:14:54 2015 UTC,"Heard of Theocracy and Gamma Ray but haven't delved into them much yet so I guess I shall.

PowerMetal,3ddpug,WylldStallyns,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:54:49 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there aren't many good recordings of it, but Sonata Arctica's ""Wolf and Raven"" is phenomenal. Honestly anything from mid 2000s back from them usually has some good energy, though not quite Pathfinder level."
PowerMetal,3ddpug,mushmancat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:53:18 2015 UTC,"For speed/technicality stuff, try Concerto Moon.  I never see their name brought up, but they're fantastic. The only Japanese band worth a damn, in my opinion. It's more neo -classical than power metal but probably right up your alley."
PowerMetal,3dd333,Snake_Byte,7,Wed Jul 15 09:18:27 2015 UTC,"It's available on some country's Spotifys, I think? I caught several playthroughs on one yesterday anyway.  I guess what more can you say about Powerwolf? Did you like Bible of the Beast? Blood of the Saints? Preachers of the Night? If so then you'll like this because it's exactly more of the same.   I'm okay with this. It's a fun album, full of energy and melody and atmosphere and Attila's glorious powerful vocals. I don't come to Powerwolf for deep lyrics, insightful themes or progressive experimental music. They're more cemented in that ACDC-of-power-metal but like ACDC it's still good stuff so I'm comfortable for now. The next album though I'd want to see a mix-up in the formula. I think possibly some of the solo-ing has gotten a little better.  So yeah, standard Powerwolf awesome fun but nothing special. Well clear of the Album of the Year shortlist, I reckon."
PowerMetal,3dd333,donn16,3,Wed Jul 15 10:33:20 2015 UTC,"What do you mean pirates? It's available on Spotify for me... heh, not anymore. I listened to it like 5 days ago, and It was available. It's even listed in my lastfm. And it wasn't on my collage... Weird.  Anyway, main album is weak. Don't like it that much, Only few tracks are worth listening, rest is forgettable, but bonus album is gold. Especially songs like Out in the fields and Shot in the dark. Good stuff. But I think I should give the main album a second chance, maybe it'll grow on me."
PowerMetal,3dd333,jasonk12,2,Wed Jul 15 09:34:16 2015 UTC,Their 2013 album still feels like new to me so I'm not that inclined to give it a listen yet ... will listen to the whole thing once (probably) when it gets uploaded to youtube though.
PowerMetal,3dd333,mushmancat,2,Wed Jul 15 12:55:30 2015 UTC,Remember when this band was actually something more than just incessant organ smeared over choir vocals in latin?  I just revisited Bible of the Beast and forgot just how enjoyable a lot of the songs on that album are.   The disparity in creativity from Bible of the Beast to the newest album is as clear as day.  How someone can actually get through the entirety of Blessed and Possessed is beyond me.  I was bored after the third song.

PowerMetal,3dd333,Console_Gamer93,2,Sat Jul 18 02:36:03 2015 UTC,"The cover album is brilliant. I can't get enough of Conquistadores, Edge of Thorns and Gods of War Arise.  I've only listened to the new album once but its way too similar to their previous two. I still like it but I'd rather listen to Blood of the Saints. I haven't listened to Bible of the Beast aside from a few songs so I can't compare it to that album (or their earlier work)."
PowerMetal,3dd333,DXCharger,2,Fri Jul 17 16:49:31 2015 UTC,"I have a couple listens on the album now, and, like everyone else is saying, Blessed and Possessed is your typical Powerwolf. Overall, I find it enjoyable, but it's more of their past few albums. 'We are the Wild' is straight up a ripoff of 'Sacred and Wild' from their last record. Army of the Night, Christ & Combat, and Sanctus Dominus are my favorite tracks, but none of them are particularly special.   Metallum Nostrum, though, is easily Powerwolf's best release since Bible of the Beast. The band is working with songs that, for the most part, exceed anything they've written in recent years. But more than that: the band is going out of the boundaries that they've woven themselves into so tightly, and it's very refreshing. Hopefully this effort of theirs will rub off on them and have some effect on their next album."
PowerMetal,3dd333,demon327,2,Sat Jul 18 02:34:05 2015 UTC,"I wonder if Powerwolf realizes they've released the same album like three times in a row or how they're basically self-parodying their own lyrics. That being said I still thoroughly enjoyed the album. Ridiculously cheesy, worthy of no other recognition, and I'll be listening to it for months."

EDIT 2: Added Hammerfall  EDIT 3: Added Blind Guardian"

PowerMetal,3d92f4,firstroundko108,3,Tue Jul 14 16:22:11 2015 UTC,I just added a falconer wallpaper to the set. Full HD and as optimized as possible. It's the cover of chapters from a vale forlorn.

PowerMetal,3d8h9v,Vortiene,2,Tue Jul 14 11:14:54 2015 UTC,"So here's my week. No to many full album this week. I recently rediscovered Sinbreed and I'm lovin it. Both album are great, but I prefer the first one, mostly because this linked song. So good. Next is Cain's Offering - Stormcrow. It's so good. It really grown on me. I liked it after the first listen, but now. Totally album of the year, with Constellation of Tears being my song of the year so far. And next is Evergrey - In Search of Truth. I had no idea that Evergrey is that good. I need to give them a listen. Thanks to /u/omegakingauldron for hinting me this.  And that's it I guess."

PowerMetal,3d8h9v,Snake_Byte,2,Tue Jul 14 11:10:15 2015 UTC,Borealis - Purgatory  It's not bad. Seems to be in a similar vein to Judicator - At the Expense of Humanity

Katatonia - Brave Murder Day - Excellent death/doom album, with a nice acoustic track thrown in too. Pyramaze - Disciples of the Sun - Not a top power metal album of the year for me, but still a solid release deserving of attention. Steven Wilson - Hand. Cannot. Erase. - It's really a shame that there are a couple albums that I like more than this one this year, because it's quite deserving of an 'AotY' place in my list of such albums. The Witcher 3 Soundtrack - I'm finally more or less done with the game at this point. I just hop in every now and then to complete a quest or contract I've yet to do - sort of prolonging that experience out. Anyways, the soundtrack for this game is really quite wonderful with lots of Slavic influence."
PowerMetal,3d8h9v,scy1192,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:55:17 2015 UTC,I feel like the only one disappointed in Hand Cannot Erase. I wish he would resume Porcupine Tree.
PowerMetal,3d8h9v,Edledhron,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:12:31 2015 UTC,"It swiftly became my favorite album of his, I'd say owing to two things:   It does a good job of representing most of the various types of music that he typically writes, and for each one he's at the top of his game. I think the story told throughout the album has more of an effect than what he's given before. Wilson showed a great bit of growth there compared to previous albums with a concept throughout (e.g. Fear of a Blank Planet).   As a part of the first bullet, I'd say he came the closest to Porcupine Tree with his solo albums this time."

PowerMetal,3d8h9v,mushmancat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:09:12 2015 UTC,"This week was pretty crazy as I stumbled upon two albums that instantly went to the top of my albums of the year list.   Sulphur Aeon- Gateway to the Antisphere - Top tier death metal that is my current aoty frontrunner. A visual representation of what listening to this album feels like.  Tribulation- Children of the Night- MA calls these guys prog death/black, but this just sounds like good old Mercyful Fate inspired heavy metal/first wave of black metal to my ears. Either way, its brilliant and everything heavy metal should be.   My current top 5 albums are:  Sulphur Aeon- Gateway to the Antisphere  Tribulation- Children of the Night  Visigoth- The Revenant King  Enslaved- In Times  Judicator- At the Expense of Humanity  Other stuff I listened to:  Ghost- Opus Eponymous - The new song got my hankering for this album.  I forgot how good it is actually.  Can't wait to see them later this year.   Noble Beast- S/T - This album is still too good.   Powerwolf- Preachers of the Night - With the new album of the horizon I went back to see if I was being too harsh on this album.  Nope.  I still stand by Bible of the Beast being their only good album."

Seriously though, Dark Moor was one of the first power metal bands I heard and Elisa's voice was one of the driving forces behind my enjoying it as much as I did. Dreamaker seemed like it would be an awesome continuation of the band but alas it wasn't to be. Haven't heard much Dreamaker content but nothing struck me the same way as that Dark Moor stuff."

PowerMetal,3d5tb6,tossinthisshit1,2,Fri Jul 17 14:43:00 2015 UTC,"a lot of people i know who are into power metal find that she's one of the only female vocalists they can stand to listen to in the genre. her range is basically perfect for power metal, screaming higher than most male singers can do comfortably and yet still being able to go pretty damn low.  her accent is immediately noted and she makes no apologies for it. she also gives few fucks about her pronunciations of english words. engrish is a staple of the genre, after all!  now, an argument i've had before (mostly with myself) is whether hall of olden dreams or gates is a better album.   gates is the better album, if only because that fucking ballad track 7. that song belongs at the END. since 'your symphony' in gates was more of a warmup to the fucking amazing epic end of the album (truth for me going into dies irae, the best requiem cover/sample/whatever in the world), i can give it a pass.  tl;dr i fanboy elisa so hard and have for years  p.s. i fucking love shadowland and i'm probably alone in doing so. the production quality adds something for me.   same with ""between the light and darkness"", if only for 3 songs on it: mistery of goddess, dies irae (orchestral), and fall of melnibone."

PowerMetal,3d2m9d,70000TonsOfMetal,0,Mon Jul 13 07:40:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything said as well aside from Power Quest. For some reason I always felt they just didn't measure up to the others, but that's the great thing about music: opinions differ and there is something for everyone. I would replace Power Quest with Sabaton or Blind Guardian."

Some may not be exactly power metal by the purists' standards, but I don't care enough to filter them out.  That said, if anyone wants to let me know which of these(if any) don't fall into the category of Power Metal, I'll remember for the next time.   Iron Savior Battle Beast Blind Guardian (I'm surprised this wasn't the first one mentioned) Stratovarius Orden Ogan Keldian Edguy Falconer Altaria Iron Maiden Crystallion Axxis Iron Fire"
PowerMetal,3d2m9d,ordo259,6,Mon Jul 13 01:33:07 2015 UTC,The sidebar has a list of essential power metal albums. That's a good place to start learning about new bands. Here are some favorite bands of mine:   Blind Guardian Rhapsody Lost Horizon Gamma Ray Iron Savior Sabaton Angra

PowerMetal,3d2m9d,Crownlol,3,Mon Jul 13 01:51:00 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't even call Within Temptation and Epica power metal, let alone essential to the genre."

PowerMetal,3d2m9d,Iohet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:38:14 2015 UTC,"I also listen to symphonic metal, and I say the songs lean to either power metal or gothic metal. Within temptation is more of the latter. Epica might be subsumed under 'epic metal', but they make pervasive use of black/death metal elements (SCREAMING). Nightwish is half and half. Their early albums I would agree to be power metal (Wishmaster, Oceanborn); the rest I don't consider to be as essential."
PowerMetal,3d2m9d,HastyCapablanca,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:23:54 2015 UTC,"Let's not do the whole ""what genre this isn't"" /r/metal game.

PowerMetal,3d2m9d,Crownlol,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:33:59 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm not saying they aren't power metal. I'm saying they're less power metal, as compared to their being goth or death metal. Because if this is what you consider to be a fantastic representation of power metal, then I'm sure most of us here would have to disagree."
PowerMetal,3d2m9d,HastyCapablanca,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:06:19 2015 UTC,"More recent Nightwish (outside of some of their songs), Epica, and Within Temptation absolutely are not fantastic representations of power metal, and don't even pretend that it's genre warrioring to say so.  In some cases they share similarities with aspects that some power metal bands have adopted (orchestras, large choirs), but they do nothing to represent what actually distinguishes power metal. 'A hair splitting division' it is far from being."
PowerMetal,3d2m9d,Edledhron,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:39:29 2015 UTC,I would agree Blind Guardian is essential but the rest of these are more or less must Blind Guardian sound alikes

PowerMetal,3d2m9d,Noizla,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:36:43 2015 UTC,"Almost nobody likes ""death metal screaming"" or harsh vocals in the beginning. It's kind of like trying coffee as a child, the taste is quite difficult to appreciate, but after being exposed to it gradually more and more you start to like it quite a bit. Personally I've come to prefer harsh vocals over clean in metal(used to only listen to ""clean"" power), as a huge, huuge part of the genre is behind that barrier. So many absolute essentials of metal, and most subgenres :/  Late comment but I feel it's important to point out"

PowerMetal,3d0a1g,Spiner202,3,Sun Jul 12 12:09:55 2015 UTC,"Top 20 PM album in my opinion.   You have every aspect that makes an album great - fantastic vocals (Martin Steene's vibrato/warble is reminiscent of Michael Kiske at times), amazing guitar work, great ballad (Legend of the Magic Sword is a kick-ass track), great faster songs (Bridges Will Burn), great ""epic"" song (Blade of Triumph), and just catchy-as-fuck.  I don't even know if I can pick out a highlight track, so I guess that's a sign of a consistent album, though it starts to fall apart a bit on the second half of the album (Jackal's Eye and Gladiator's Path are the two weakest tracks, IMO)."
PowerMetal,3d0a1g,70000TonsOfMetal,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:15:43 2015 UTC,"I re-listened to the album after I posted this yesterday, and I agree about the ballad. It is wicked, although I'm also a huge sucker for ballads."

PowerMetal,3d0a1g,malkvinegar,3,Mon Jul 13 12:16:14 2015 UTC,"Had you intended to use this album for awhile or was it because I asked about it? I like to think I can influence other people's decisions and this is one that's minor enough that someone may actually let me feel good for once.  Anyway I'm glad you did post it, I remembered asking about something but it's been busy and there wasn't much chance to look it up. My stupid brain probably would have forgotten if you didn't bring it up again. It sounds pretty solid overall, nothing groundbreaking but well done. The vocals are a highlight too, you have described it pretty darn well."
PowerMetal,3d0a1g,Edledhron,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:43:56 2015 UTC,"I would have come to it eventually, but it was not on my immediate list.

PowerMetal,3d0a1g,omegakingauldron,2,Mon Jul 13 12:05:50 2015 UTC,"Solid album with an amazing vocalist and great riffs. It's bare-bones, straightforward power metal, but the band does what it does extremely well. Plus there's great album art which is always a plus!   Have to disagree with /u/70000TonsOfMetal though, in that I find Gladiator's Path to be one of the stronger tracks. The vocals hold up, but the guitars really shine on it for me. Bridges Will Burn is probably my favorite of the album though, and agree with him that it's a great faster song."

This is about as intense as it gets for a song that's less than 3 minutes long. It's basically a mix of Sabaton-esque vocals, Rammstein industrial influence, and Amon Amarth riffs. I'd be shocked if you didn't love this."

Silverthorn has maybe 2 or 3 stand out songs on the album where as PFTP is just consistently great. No arguments on the vocals however. Khan was done at that point, Tommy is truly a worthy successor. Still, Khan's voice on ""Hunters Season"" reminds me of why I fell in love with Kamelot all those years ago."

I posted yesterday that I thought Cain's Offering Antemortem was my song of the year, but I gave Unleash the Archers another listen this morning and I think Dreamcrusher may actually be my song of the year. I think I first heard that song like a year and a half ago though while they were working on the album so it completely slipped my mind.  I'm still confused about Civil War. That first album gets better every time I listen to it. I want to like Gods and Generals but it's not happening yet. Maybe I'll give it another listen today."

PowerMetal,3cvqyy,Enemy-to-Injustice,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:00:13 2015 UTC,"Power metal bands are just too good at their instruments (really metal bands as a whole). I've played guitar for 10 years, and I can pretty much only play rhythm guitar. It's so hard to find the time to invest to play lead at the levels these guys do. I'm probably just making excuses, but I don't think I'll ever be able to pull off most of the solos these guys play."
PowerMetal,3cvqyy,Spiner202,2,Sat Jul 11 13:53:30 2015 UTC,"You just have to practice the kinds of shapes and musical ideas they play for several years, while obviously practicing an overall balanced musicianship. It took me a while to get down fast sweep picking, and even longer to get down fast alternate picking, but eventually it just clicks. You also have to be able to challenge yourself and accept repeated failure; I've been trying to learn ""The Temple of Hate"" by Angra, and the fast parts have been tripping me up for the past 2 months, but I'll get it down. Maybe /u/70000TonsOfMetal has some tips for you. If he tabbed DragonForce 10 years ago, I can only imagine what godly level of shreddding he's on now."
PowerMetal,3cvqyy,Snake_Byte,2,Sat Jul 11 15:00:34 2015 UTC,"If he tabbed DragonForce 10 years ago, I can only imagine what godly level of shreddding he's on now.   I'd say 10 years ago, when I was actually practicing and playing guitar daily, I was like a 7.5-8/10 as a guitar player. Now I'm like a 2/10. My fingers don't do what they used to do even though I know what they should be doing. So that sucks. Not even getting old, just out of practice. It's the same with singing - I know what notes they're hitting, I just can't do it myself. It's frustrating as hell.  I've always been better at drums than guitar anyway though =P  But you're completely right. I think playing instruments is what lead me to power metal in the first place. Everyone is insanely good at their instruments and it's both inspiring and annoying listening to how perfect some of these guys play (especially live)."
PowerMetal,3cvqyy,Spiner202,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:14:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice.  For me, it comes down to two things. The first is that I don't want to and don't have the time to put into the instrument, so I know it's going to take years to get to the level I'd like (I've read a lot of stories of musicians sleeping through school so they could play guitar all night afterwards; unfortunately I value school/my job pretty highly so I can't do that). The other issue is that I don't see improvement fast enough to stick at it. I've been practicing the intro to White Wizzard's ""High Roller"" for weeks, and I still can't play it up to speed. It's difficult to find something that is within my skill level that I can attain with a reasonable amount of practice, and everything else, I just don't see improvement very fast, so I get bored and stick to playing rhythm for the same set of songs I already know how to play. The only thing that kind of helps is learning Maiden songs, because some of their solos are doable."
PowerMetal,3cvqyy,ArcticSin,2,Sat Jul 11 15:50:14 2015 UTC,"It's hard to give comprehensive advice, because there's so much to say about technique, theory, song-learning, motivation, etc. Don't worry about improvement/progress because that doesn't do anything productive. Don't be afraid to challenge yourself with harder songs than Maiden, even if they're not ""doable."" Even if you can only play them at 1/4 speed, you're still learning a lot about musicality, vocabulary, soloing patterns, shapes, arpeggios, etc. What I used to love to do was just play scalar and arpeggiated improvisation over some of my favorite albums. It's good for rhythm, hearing, improvisation, and it doesn't take too much energy because I was busy enjoying my favorite albums while not worrying too much about what I played over them; the best part was that a few hours of practice went by quickly after a few albums. Don't stress out about improvement, and definitely take your priorities of school and work more seriously. The greatest lesson I've ever learned is to just ""enjoy the sound you make"" on the instrument whether you're satisfied with your skill level or not. That metamotivation goes a long way."
PowerMetal,3cvqyy,InhalationDroidXRR-3,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:04:52 2015 UTC,"I used to spend a lot of time playing different scales (usually basic ones), but I found the same result: it just wasn't getting any better. Unfortunately I haven't done that in a while, so I'm pretty rusty with those scales now.  With that said, your last couple of sentences are the key. Ever since I've kind of resigned myself to the fact that I won't be a shredder, I've spent more time writing music, and I have an entire thrash album written. Of course, my playing isn't tight enough to record it, but if an opportunity comes along, I have material ready, and I'm already working on a second record."
PowerMetal,3cvqyy,Raging_Elephant,2,Sat Jul 11 23:38:51 2015 UTC,Consider looking up guitar lessons. After 10 years of self-teaching and just noodling around in my bedroom I finally sought out a course and it's fantastic the sort of theory you learn which can unlock so many doors.
PowerMetal,3cvqyy,mushmancat,2,Sun Jul 12 09:10:17 2015 UTC,"That's one thing I really regret. I took lessons for the first few years of my playing (first from a jazz guy, then from Glen Drover (Megadeth), then from the guitar player for Vesperia), but at the time, I didn't take guitar seriously enough to really practice.  I do plan on taking lessons starting about a year from now, but for the time being, I move every 4 months because I'm in a co-op program at school, so I'm always between two different cities. Really though, I'm just making excuses at this point. If I really wanted to get good, I'd find a way."

I felt like they were good introductory band for power metal, but over the years I heard things about how live they sounded nothing like the album. I believe they've been known as ""Studio Force"" across the internet. And honestly that kind of put me off. Plus I felt like over time their quality in song writing diminished and sounded pretty stagnant.  While the latter is still an opinion I share, I have to admit that they sounded really tight on this one live. I might have to re-evaluate my stance on this band hahaha."
PowerMetal,3csgd7,fuzzynyanko,6,Fri Jul 10 15:26:24 2015 UTC,"I remember Studio Force, and it wasn't a bad name for the performances they used to put on; sloppy and rough sounding.

PowerMetal,3csgd7,SilverFirePrime,2,Fri Jul 10 15:54:42 2015 UTC,They came through my town with Kamelot on their last tour and I was just off put by that show. Like I love Kamelot to death. They were one of those intro bands for me too and I still listen to them steadily to this day. But I didn't know how to feel about them with Roy in the band because he was like my favorite singer ever. I felt the same way when Nightwish came to town. Both bands had such amazing singers that defined their sound for so long. I couldn't imagine going and feeling disappointed or something.  But I digress haha. I'll be sure to check out their new stuff and this DVD when it comes out.
PowerMetal,3csgd7,theclumsyninja,2,Fri Jul 10 16:00:25 2015 UTC,"Digressing does not exist when speaking about metal. Haha  I also love Kamelot, and they finished the show with Angel of Afterlife, my favorite of theirs! Was definitely strange hearing their new vocalist with the older songs though, yea.  And Nightwish, I also saw them in May in Nashville (hometown, woot woot!), and hearing Lady ReVamp (Floor Jansen) herself live for the first time was great. I felt like there was more bass than anything though, couldn't hear the lyrics or drums nearly as well, the levels were off a bit or something.  The next band I want to see live is Pathfinder. The new vocalist should be interesting to hear, I am so accustomed to Simon as THE vocalist for them."

Whether classic metallic, speedy, thrashy, proggy or even funky with a sensational operating brass section... with their playfulness and musical skills they always hit the right notes to lift phenomenal songwriting up into higher spheres. Certainly Hibria's heaviest album to date, and, with all due respect, the most mature and undoubtedly best one.  The mastering, done by none other than Maor Appelbaum (Sepultura, Dokken, Halford), ensures an innovative, intensive and brutal dynamically coat of paint ... Exactly how modern, sophisticated and ""in your face"" heavy metal should sound.  “We self titled this release because we believe that it represents what our music is and how we feel about our band.

PowerMetal,3cj7bv,creamweather,2,Wed Jul 8 13:15:47 2015 UTC,It sounds like the soundtrack to a made-for-TV movie to me.   I think it's the symphonics + the mega generic guitar tone.  I don't dislike it but I think my mom would like it.

Not actually owning the album limits my ability to give my own thoughts, but everything I've heard has been really enjoyable and unique.  Still even with the unexpected ambivalence toward this album, it's good seeing it get some discussion time. Dark Moor are one of those bands that helped me get into power metal in the first place, even if I don't know them overly well."
PowerMetal,3cj7bv,mushmancat,4,Thu Jul 9 03:41:58 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with most of the people here.  This was a phenomenal album, their best since Halls of the Olden Dream.  If I had to guess most people's problem with this album, it wouldn't be that its generic(Its not), but moreseo that it is barely power metal. Hell, its barely metal.  I don't see how someone can say they are generic, there isn't another power metal band that sounds like them.  Sure, the rhythm guitars are subdued on this album, but in context with the rest of the album we can see it was a conscious decision and not lack of talent or songwriting ability.  If the guitars were truly generic, we wouldn't have some of the stunning leads this album has.    I also don't think this album was safe.  I think the last two Dark Moor albums have been two of the most compelling albums in the genre in quit a while.  I use the term genre loosely because they aren't exactly power metal anymore.  And I think that is part of the charm.  They aren't afraid to throw away genre standards for something more adventurous.  What other band would throw a song like 'Just Rock' in the middle of an album.  Granted, I hate that song, but thats besides the point.      I do understand this isn't for everyone.  Like I said this isn't power metal, I think after Ancestral Romance came out I dubbed them Neoromanticism Metal(I've always wanted someone who is more knowledgeable in classical music to tell me if that makes sense or if its way off base.).  Anyway, certainly not for everyone, but I can't see how they could be considered generic or safe.    My favorite tracks are City of Peace(My favorite power metal song from that year) and Saint James' Way"

Can't say that I remember exactly what where my problems with this album but I remind a lot of ""borrowing"" from classical contexts and shit dynamics, but I might be wrong after I shrugged off the album 2 years ago."
PowerMetal,3cj7bv,omegakingauldron,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:01:27 2015 UTC,"There were some concerns leading up to the release of this album, but it ended up being a very enjoyable album.  With tasteful orchestration, pleasant vocals, a Spanish air, and the riffs and neo-classical solos one expects from Dark Moor, Ars Musica is well paced and a nice variation in its songs.  The opening track - 'First Lance of Spain' - I find to be a fairly typical bombastic power metal track, though being very well executed as such. The next track is when the band really starts to distinguish themselves. 'This is My Way' is less aggressive, but its orchestral elements do a very good job of supporting the other elements, and its overall calmness allows for swelling and punctuation of grandiosity with both the orchestral piece and a nice big choir.  I remember not being a huge fan of 'The Road Again' at first hearing, but it's ended up being a strong track for me. No particular element on it shines, but it's a catchy song competently carried out.  'The City of Peace' is my favorite track of the album. The orchestration on this one isn't as grandiose as most songs that get remembered for that element, but it happily supports the rest of the band in an upbeat song with that unique Dark Moor flair. A great solo complements the track as well!  'Living in A Nightmare' is the most typical Dark Moor song of the bunch. A heavily orchestrated song with a gothic tone, Romero's vocals really shine on this one as he takes a more operatic and theatric tone compared to the rest of the album. It does a great job of keeping up the pace, especially being surrounded by a couple slower songs.  Before closing on 'Asturias,' which is equally in the Dark Moor tradition, the band puts forth another upbeat track: 'Saint James' Way.' I find this one to be sort of combination of some of the previous tracks I've mentioned. It has the upbeat tone of 'The City of Peace,' the swelling of 'This is My Way,' and the operatic tone and theatrics of 'Living in A Nightmare.' The chorus could be a little stronger, but overall a very enjoyable song as well."
PowerMetal,3cj7bv,Fazermint,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:55:05 2015 UTC,"When listening to the album, it has some good tracks, but it has quite a few tracks that feel generic or that they're like filler. True stand outs are The City of Peace, The Road Again, First Lance of Spain and Living In a Nightmare. So basically when they broke away from being mid-paced and boring is when the album was good.  Overall it's not a terrible album, but I have heard better albums from Dark Moor."
PowerMetal,3cj7bv,kecos,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:56:44 2015 UTC,"Ars Musica is, consistently with all their releases post Gates of Oblivion, underwhelming. I admit to being a huge fan of Elisa's work, but it's not the change of vocalists that bother me. It's the songwriting that took a major hit.  In the first album featuring Romero, the self titled one, the music remains somewhat similar, and Romero's role here is to emulate Elisa. Not a very good album overall, but it has gems like ""Eternity"" and ""From Hell"".  In the next one, Beyond the Sea, the songwriting is no longer an attempt to emulate the Elisa days and takes a new direction, with Romero starting to really stand out as the best aspect of the band. Again, not a strong album, but ""The Silver Key"" stands out as a true masterpiece.  Later albums continue to become more generic, less power and more orchestral. That's not necessarily a critique, but it's not the direction I would have liked the band to take. Ars Musica actually ups the game compared to the albums in between, with some decent songs. Like /u/omegakingauldron has put already, the album is at its best when they break away from the mid-paced style that has come to characterize Dark Moor.  I didn't know they were hitting the studios, and I'm very interested in hearing what they can come up with."
PowerMetal,3cj7bv,Snake_Byte,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:21:23 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of this album. The Road Again is my favorite, and I like atmosphere of it. It sounds very Spanish, but maybe that's because I know the band is from Spain. It's got a very elegant sound to it."

Cattle Decapitation better come correct if they want to topple this monstrosity from the top of my list.   In Solitude-Sister- Their whole discography got a spin once I heard the slit up.  One of the best modern heavy metal bands.  Damn shame.   Guardians of Time- Rage and Fire - A lot better than I expected.  Definitely not showing any signs of rust.

Their previous stuff is not listed since I was playing it from youtube, didn't know that it's available on Spotify.Hollow Haze is also on my list and it's good. But I'll give it another listen, because I have a feeling that it'll grow on me. And my favourite Savatage album, Hall of the Mountain King. Someone posted Helloween - Gorgar and there's this small instrumental part inspired by Hall of the Mountain King and that lead me to this song and then I figured out that I need to listen to Savatage album with the same name. If you don't know Savatage you should start with this album. And that's pretty much my week."

Pretty good, but a lot of filler in both albums.  Candlemass Trying to get through most of their discography. Nothing compares to Nightfall so far.  Sabaton  Carolus Rex always seemed like an 'off' album to me. It never felt as powerful as their other work. Still a good listen though."
PowerMetal,3cesej,gives_you_cookies,3,Tue Jul 7 12:53:33 2015 UTC,"Also have been listening to Carolus Rex a lot (as well as Heroes and Primo Victoria, The Art of War). To me Carolus Rex is their best album by far, there is no song on the album that I don't think is fantastic. Then again i didnt like Attero Dominatus and Metalizer pretty much at all, so im a weirdo probably."
PowerMetal,3cesej,Door_piggy,2,Wed Jul 8 08:49:09 2015 UTC,"I Agree on Metalizer being a weak album. AD didn't have as many stand out songs as the other albums, but it had more force and power than Carolus Rex, especially in the title track. Did you like Heroes? I found it quite alright, but it didn't compare to Primo Victoria or Art of War."
PowerMetal,3cesej,gives_you_cookies,2,Wed Jul 8 09:00:45 2015 UTC,"Heroes was good enough for me to listen to a lot, but not as amazing as carolus rex. In my opinion:  Carolus Rex > Primo Victoria > Heroes = Art of War > rest  Where i barely listen to the rest at all honestly."

The new Author and Punisher is kinda of amazing, musically pulsating and relentless, was quite refreshing listening to new A&P.  The new tempel is also good prog. Same for Kingcrow. Not power metal but it might interest some of you.  Some unworthy stuff here and there and revisited Dionysus. It's been a long time since I heard them."
PowerMetal,3cesej,omegakingauldron,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:24:17 2015 UTC,"Quite the week  First and foremost; I decided to give Chameleon by Helloween a chance. This thing is an abomination to mankind and will forever collect dust and just be there to fill out the discography.  Stones Grow Her Name by Sonata Arctica is surprisingly a good album, although it's top heavy in content. Still unsure on the hate this album gets.  I also listened to (R)Evolution by Hammerfall, but for some reason it didn't register."

It reminds me of Manilla Road, has that kind of vibe in presentation."
PowerMetal,3cesej,Spiner202,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:54:33 2015 UTC,"Operation Mindcrime is one of my top 5 albums of all-time, so I would agree :D  New Enforcer is fantastic. A huge step up from their previous one, although not as good as Diamonds.  That Iron Fire album is really good. It is by no means innovative or unique, but it's really well executed, and all of the songs are memorable. I would definitely buy it if you see it."

Conklin is a big, big part of that for me, that guy can sing, scream, and wail with such gusto that the blood just starts flowing. He's seriously better than coffee to help wake up in the morning.

PowerMetal,3c88gl,SevenColouredMisery,5,Sun Jul 5 20:47:20 2015 UTC,"Basically, it was, (and still is) our combined favourite genre of metal.  In terms of how it is up North, the local scene is great on the whole. It's dominated by extreme metal bands, though. The only other band that springs to mind that plays a similar style to us up here is Risen Prophecy, who released their second album recently.  But the actual scene is great, we have some great promoters always putting gigs on, and a NWOBHM festival in Brofest thats been running for the past few years."
PowerMetal,3c88gl,Snake_Byte,5,Sun Jul 5 20:50:30 2015 UTC,"Great to hear! Hope to see you guys in the capital soon, you've got a ticket, shirt, CD and a few pints ready to be bought right here any time \m/"
PowerMetal,3c88gl,Wintersun13,4,Sun Jul 5 20:56:47 2015 UTC,"yeah Newcastle metal scene is pretty great I'd say.Decent crowds and sound promoters mainly. Plenty of old school (literally) NWOBHM bands. Healthy DM scene too. I'd second Sean with the Risen Prophecy shout, great band. We're always on the same gig bill too as there arent that many ther PM bands."
PowerMetal,3c88gl,SevenColouredMisery,2,Sun Jul 5 20:51:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks guys for coming here! Here are my questions:   Your music has more of a USPM sound to it than most power metal bands from Europe. What has the local response to that been like? Having released a couple EPs, what are the future plans for the band? Are there any specific bands you'd like to tour with? What's your songwriting and recording/producing process like? Who are some of your favorite up and coming metal bands (aside from yourselves!)? Who's the most attractive member of the band? (Asking the important questions here!)"
PowerMetal,3c88gl,Ax-Battler,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:52:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for having us, dude!   We've had some good feedback from local people. Especially regarding the step up in quality from our 'Born' Demo to the new EP.  We're recording demos for the album right now, actually. We're hoping to get the actual recording process started for good during the summer or early Autumn! I know the other members would love to tour with bands like Atlantean Kodex/While Heaven Wept, or just any of our general influences. I'm fairly easy myself, though. All our songs are just written in our bedrooms on Guitar Pro, then just rehearsed in the practice room where we can iron them out in a band environment and find what works and what doesn't. Recording is a lengthy process. We do quite a bit of bedroom recording, but the important stuff like drums/vocals/leads is all done in the studio, whenever we have the money to get dates booked, lol. There are a lot of up and coming bands from the local scene, actually. Risen Prophecy just released their second album on Metal on Metal records. Horrified are a great death metal band that have new material coming out soon. (our drummer Dan is the frontman.)  Me of course."

PowerMetal,3c88gl,malkvinegar,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:27:04 2015 UTC,"Not sure how much I can really give away. Just expect more of the same from The Dreaming City, but on a larger scale.

PowerMetal,3c88gl,Ax-Battler,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:29:48 2015 UTC,"No problem, thanks for having us!   The local response has been surprisingly positive, a lot of Newcastle folk prefer the more extreme styles of metal, and I think they appreciate that we don't skimp on the actual riffs, or heavy aspects. We're currently demoing album material, and hope to enter production proper once summer ends. I'd love to play with Iron Maiden, realistically I'd love to get a tour together with our friends in Risen Prophecy. We write the songs in midi, and Bruce will start writing vocal lines, then we take the songs into the practice room and hammer them, songs often evolve further in this stage. As for recording we're trying different approaches, from now vocals and drums in a professional studio, guitars and bass recorded from home.  I'm a big fan of bands such as Visigoth, Eternal Champion, Terminus, Solar Fragment, Sacral Rage, and Gatekeeper, all killer acts.  I think we're all quirky looking, I'll give the edge to Sean!"

As Chris said, Blind Guardian and Fates Warning are probably the biggest inspirations.  For me and leads, I love Andre Olbrichs playing, Syu and Yukimura Hirano are two great players from Japan I love, and strangely enough Mike Davis who played lead guitar in Nocturnus has been someone I've looked up to with lead playing."
PowerMetal,3c88gl,Ax-Battler,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:49:16 2015 UTC,What's your favorite metal band and your favorite non-metal band? Least favorite?
PowerMetal,3c88gl,SoulFire6464,4,Sun Jul 5 20:53:16 2015 UTC,"man i really struggle with coming up with a single band for these questions, depends what genre im buzzing at a particular time. Recently been getting very much into Seven Kingdoms. 'The Fire is Mine'. Great album. Love the ASOIAF series too. Crystal Viper another band iv recently got into. Was Blind Guardian that first got me into power though.  Non metal band for me would probably have to Slaves (UK)."
PowerMetal,3c88gl,Ax-Battler,3,Sun Jul 5 20:50:22 2015 UTC,"Blind Guardian and Virgin Steele are probably my big favorite bands. Non-metal maybe Rush or Camel, I have a big soft spot for eighties pop as well. Least favorite are we talking metal band or anything?"
PowerMetal,3c88gl,SevenColouredMisery,2,Sun Jul 5 21:06:37 2015 UTC,Least favorite metal band and non-metal band.
PowerMetal,3c88gl,SoulFire6464,3,Sun Jul 5 20:57:23 2015 UTC,"Non-metal would easily be Oasis, as for metal band, I can't really get away with stuff like Korpiklaani."
PowerMetal,3c88gl,psychoconductor,2,Sun Jul 5 20:59:30 2015 UTC,My favourite metal band for the past few years has been Blind Guardian. Non Metal? I don't really listen to a lot of stuff outside of metal. Does Video Game music count? Lol.  Least favourite metal band is a tough one. I dislike bands for different reasons so it's pretty hard to pinpoint one that sticks out as my 'least favourite'
PowerMetal,3c88gl,SevenColouredMisery,2,Sun Jul 5 21:10:21 2015 UTC,Video game music definitely counts!

And they all released their first album in 2008, but Aquaelie, Light Bringer and Unlucky Morpheus are all in my top 5 favourite bands. Japanese metal scene is underrated as all hell."

PowerMetal,3c88gl,Ax-Battler,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:17:08 2015 UTC,"Before I start harassing you with questions, just want to say I really dig the EP. Fantastic work all around and I can't wait to hear more material. Now most of my questions have been asked already, the other guys on here were pretty quick to the draw.   1) Was wondering how many of you used reddit regularly or semi-regularly before this AMA? 2) Related question: how useful have you guys found social sites like reddit to promote the band? 3) Related again: are you finding there's more enthusiasm for your material online or the local scene? 4) Was the recording process vastly different from the demo to the EP?"
PowerMetal,3c88gl,malkvinegar,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:20:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot dude. Always nice to hear that.    I think Dan (Drums) And Jonny (Bass) were the only people who had accounts before this, haha. I know me and Chris had to make one for this. It's honestly probably the most convenient way to promote a band. So many people use Facebook, theres dedicated forums like this for Power Metal. It just always feels like theres a new way to show your music to someone.  Online, actually. While we do have a great local scene, we've had a lot more enthusiasm over the material from the USA in particular. Immensely. We recorded Born By the Wind in two days in the studio. Just went in, two days later we had everything recorded and a few weeks later we had the final mix. With TDC, there was months in between the guitars first being recorded to the final mixes being heard. It was a much more lengthy process, we took a lot of time on everything. While we still love BBTW demo, the difference between the two is huge, and a large portion of that is down to the different recording process."
PowerMetal,3c88gl,Ax-Battler,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:37:04 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of surprised that you're finding the US to be where you've gotten your best response. There has been something of a resurgence in power metal here, but Europe still seems like the chief region for the genre."
PowerMetal,3c88gl,malkvinegar,2,Sun Jul 5 21:43:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's partly down to having online friends in the US, I also spent time in the past writing for American websites, and made good contacts in that time. I think (hope) once Europe catches on some more we'll find more of our interest coming from there, a lot of the reviews for 'The Dreaming City' were in German. I'd love to play there some day."
PowerMetal,3c88gl,Ax-Battler,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:50:23 2015 UTC,"I can speak from personal experience, I wouldn't have found you guys without online communities like these. Thanks for coming out and making the account to do the AMA, I appreciate it."
PowerMetal,3c88gl,Wintersun13,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:54:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Really appreciate it.  1) I created an account just for it today, so this is all kind of new, but I like it.   2) The reddit posts have been really useful, I was kind of surprised to see so much traffic on our bandcamp from this site. Certainly an eye opener. Social sites are integral to promoting a band these days, I think.  3) I think there's a bit more enthusiasm online, the labels who we've worked with are based in the US, so we tend to find more action on the internet. Not to say the local support hasn't been great, but it can take a while before people to take you serious.  4) Yeah, massively. We recorded the demo two days in the studio, and it really opened my eyes to the whole process. I went in very naive, and throughout those two days made a lot of mental notes on how to go about future recording."
PowerMetal,3c88gl,malkvinegar,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:10:57 2015 UTC,"Didn't realize they had those stats on Bandcamp, it's a daft thing to admit but it just never crossed my mind. Thanks for doing the AMA, I appreciate it a lot."

PowerMetal,3c88gl,SevenColouredMisery,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:12:38 2015 UTC,"cheers for the kind words mate!   Iv only just very started posting on reddit, came across the 'Song of Ice and Fire' sub and did alot of lurking on there before branching out to other subs. Very useful iv found, been really cool seeing the EP reach various different countries even its just the one person in Norway buying/listening. Its mainly the other guys who handle online forum posts on sites like Metal Crypt et al, but there has been a pretty cool reception in the online communities that has left me pleasantly surprised. Ill second Chris and Seans thoughts that it takes a little longer in the local scene. Very much so. Found BBTW a huge learning curve for me personally, first time id ever recorded anything. The recording for 'City' was done far more methodically done in a superior product. I feel my own performance stepped up massively from BBTW."
PowerMetal,3c88gl,malkvinegar,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:19:46 2015 UTC,"My experience on reddit was similar except musically related (came to this sub and another metal one) and got sucked in. Never did check out the Song of Ice and Fire sub even though I love the series, might have to correct that.  Thanks for coming on here to do the AMA."
PowerMetal,3c88gl,Ax-Battler,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:00:15 2015 UTC,"Sorry about this but I forgot two questions I wanted to ask.  1) When you guys get bigger can you do another AMA here so I can ask you to come to Canada? 2) How often do you get lost going to a show? My trip to London was punctuated by an awesome, but tiring, day being lost and wandering the city aimlessly."
PowerMetal,3c88gl,malkvinegar,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it man, that's the whole point of this, right?   I'd love to come to Canada, if I could I'd jump at the chance tomorrow, but we gotta see what comes up. We've only played local shows so far, so no trouble there, hah. I remember goi to a show in London once, we got lost trying to find the bus station because the guy at the information desk gave us the wrong directions!"

PowerMetal,3c8iid,UnlostHorizon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:07:33 2015 UTC,"Stupid question but, are tiny, beautiful girls a thing (maybe even requirement) in Japanese metal? The metal image there seems vastly different from over here in my limited experience."
PowerMetal,3c8iid,malkvinegar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:21:52 2015 UTC,"No, it's an intersection of metal and idols.   In Japanese pop culture, an idol (アイドル aidoru?, a Japanese rendering of the English word ""idol"") is a young manufactured star/starlet who is promoted as being particularly cute.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_idol  There are plenty of bands out there that don't involve idols, like Galneryus."
PowerMetal,3c8iid,rcfox,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:02:43 2015 UTC,"But once we're talking about bands like Galneryus, we need to address the visual kei thing, even though they've moved away from the style over the years."

Listened to the song and instantly recognized it, this compilation should be awesome. Too bad it wasn't the old albums in full but I'll take what I can get.  What the hell is ""flower metal""? Does it concern guitars adorned with various flowers and drummers using rose stems to play instead of drum sticks? Because that sounds awful. Well maybe not the flowers decorating the guitars, that could be cool.  /u/Fazermint I, for one, think your gifs are swell. It was iffy right up until the cat one but then it was pure gold! I approve of more cat gifs in this sub. Cats dig power metal, it's obviously the most cat-like of all the metals. Unless we discover Catonium, that would usurp it and rightly so."

Track 3, ""Believe Myself"", is more like the usual power metal that Aldious is known for. Track 2's genre remains to be seen. So get rid of that ""flower metal"" genre.  BTW, you do realize that those two ""wrestling"" gifs were actually UFC gifs? UFC is the real version of wrestling, to put it plainly, without most of the entertainment aspects that make wrestling so fun to watch."

It'd be more accurate to say that those gifs show MMA fighting.   I'm still not sure if Fazermint did it on purpose or if he's unaware of the difference between wrestling and MMA."
PowerMetal,3c6w90,UnlostHorizon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:05:07 2015 UTC,You can't throw punches in MMA?
PowerMetal,3c6w90,MadTheMad,2,Sun Jul 5 13:07:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, I see where that got confusing. You're not allowed to throw punches in amateur wrestling, but amateur wrestling grapples and holds are used pretty frequently in MMA. However, those gifs show punches being thrown, so it can't be called wrestling. It's not amateur wrestling because there are punches, and it's not pro wrestling because it's real fighting."

Chained is probably my favorite one (the one I bought), because I like the vocalist, however they have a lot of good albums with 3 different vocalists in total. Here's a sample from the album I got  Best of their standard vocalist I'd say would be the album ""Vengeance Descending"", the one with Heiman is ""Confessions of the Maker"", and I just bought the one with their more recent vocalist.

This was my fourth time seeing Helloween, so I knew what to expect and was not disappointed. Deris was in top form and delivered a great performance. My only gripe was that they didn't play Mr. Torture (they only had an hour, so some songs had to be cup).   On the other hand it was my first time seeing Priest and boy did they blow me away. I wasn't sure how good Halford was going to sound with his age, but the first few verses of Dragonaut (the opening song) were enough for my jaw to drop, he still sounds amazing beyond all expectations I had.

Anywho, this won't be the big discussion on it, but just to get some preliminary thoughts... what do you guys want to see for the reworking of the essential albums list? The list as it is now is basically the most popular albums from 2-3 years ago, along with Dragonland for having done an AMA here awhile ago. There are two big issues with this: it doesn't reflect the community of the subreddit today, and it doesn't serve as a great introduction to power metal (and it's often pointed to as such). I'm currently thinking it should be some mixture of curated and voted in albums."
PowerMetal,3c2h3f,Edledhron,2,Sat Jul 4 04:37:59 2015 UTC,"I think there are some albums that many of us are going to unanimously voted in (Nightfall in Middle Earth, Under the Grey Banner) so that can be a start.  Voting can be interesting. Although it's one of those things where we as a collective have to chose what is considered a good introduction to Power Metal. This means putting aside our feelings for likes/dislikes and looking at how the bands/albums chosen impact those coming into PM as well as the staying power they have to keep people coming back.  So with that, we may have quite a few people not being Sabaton fans (as an example), but we have to understand that people listen to them and tend to gravitate to them and want similar artists.  Although, having everyone vote on the Essential Albums (what is to be up there) seems like it'll lead to a clusterfuck to put it lightly. Perhaps having a set group (the mods and/or people who tend to post frequently) to get some of the albums together (as in the ones many will obviously vote in) and then open it to the public, allowing others to give their input and allow changes to be made from there."
PowerMetal,3c2h3f,creamweather,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:20:57 2015 UTC,"Under the Grey Banner   Whilst a very good album, I wouldn't call it essential by any means.    So with that, we may have quite a few people not being Sabaton fans (as an example), but we have to understand that people listen to them and tend to gravitate to them and want similar artists.   But likewise, Sabaton being popular now doesn't inherently make them an essential. I mean, the goal of this is to truly be what is essential: what founded, influenced, and impacted the genre in its various strains along with how a newcomer can quickly can an understanding of the varieties of power metal. And do note that the genre and fans of the genre aren't the same thing. (Also: This shouldn't be read as saying that Sabaton won't be on the list, only that it isn't guaranteed either).   Perhaps having a set group (the mods and/or people who tend to post frequently) to get some of the albums together (as in the ones many will obviously vote in) and then open it to the public, allowing others to give their input and allow changes to be made from there.   That's sort of my current idea: Having a group of regulars here come to as near a consensus as can be decide for some portion of the list to cover the absolute bases, then have the rest up to a vote, likely with that group also deciding if any of the popularly chosen albums should be cut.  I would also add two more points to this:  First, as you can tell, I don't see this as being the most 'democratic' thing this subreddit has done, because, as has been demonstrated and said, just having this be a popularity contest wouldn't really get a list that would be useful to newcomers. It would just be what our favorite albums are.  Secondly, I don't think the list should be longer than 15 albums. For comparison, the current list is at 21. As this will be serving as an introduction to the genre, I think being concise is the better route."
PowerMetal,3c2h3f,LupineManBear,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:20:11 2015 UTC,"Depending on how essential you think it should be, 15 would cut it close.    Keepers, Nightfall, At least 3 USPM albums, Angra, stratovarius, gamma ray, running wild maybe, and then probably a Kamelot (or do you cut it because it's not original enough), Rhapsody, Nightwish, probably an Edguy/Avantasia, Symphony X.  Those are close enough to the actual essentials give or take.  But, it would leave no room for anything else that might be worthy of consideration."

I beat the game once and did a lot of quests, but didn't explore anywhere near the entire game. I'm currently on my second playthrough on the hardest difficulty (trying to get all of the trophies). I think they sacrificed some tightness in gameplay in order to add more content. With that said, it's still one of my favourite games ever. Second best game behind Bloodborne this year for me.  I would definitely like to see the essential albums list reworked. It's pretty decent, but there are some picks on there that I would change. No real preference as to how it's done, but I think getting a bit of input from the community would be good."
PowerMetal,3c2h3f,malkvinegar,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:58:45 2015 UTC,"Voting shouldn't be the way we decide what's on the essential albums list. It should more or less be decided on by the influence the album had on the genre or how well it captures the essential power metal sound. Voting would open it to just a popularity contest, even if the entries were vetted by a smaller subsection of the community.  I understand what you're getting at, it would be great to get a list that isn't just the ""classic"" albums in the genre but also reflects the community itself. However I think we can get at that idea through having discussions and not voting. We could keep the voting aspect for the annual awards posts, which are also prominently linked in our sidebar.  By the way it may be helpful to move the Essential Albums list higher up, make it bolder or larger so it stands out more. You know, after we've fixed it.  Another random idea I had was to have an essential albums list but include a smaller subsection for essential songs (not found on those albums) maybe?"

PowerMetal,3c2h3f,Vortiene,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:06:07 2015 UTC,Are most albums pretty expensive over there? I remember hearing that Japanese albums always get bonus tracks because it's cheaper to import the regular versions of the albums from outside of Japan.

I fell prey to this, as I bought Unia and Days of Grays new (25 bucks each), and then I went upstairs to the used section and Unia was there like new for 8 bucks. Whoops. Almost all used albums are <20 dollars, most <10, rare stuff maybe >20. They don't have Phoenix Rising or Vetelgyus in the used section currently. (well, they had this DVD-sized box set of Phoenix Rising, but that won't fit in my CD collection area so I didn't get it.)"

My version of Sabaton's The Art of War is the one with The Art of War by Sun Tzu, so it's in a DVD case.  Luckily, albums like Freedom Call's Beyond and Kamelot's Silverthorne has digi-paks inside to have them with the rest of the CD's."

PowerMetal,3c2h3f,Vortiene,2,Sat Jul 4 14:32:53 2015 UTC,"That's where I got it. And yeah, worth every penny.  Even the Silverthorne boxset was cheap.

New albums are about 199-229SEK ($23-$27ish) but I've been picking up used albums for around $6 and the selection is always great. I just physically need to own the album even if I don't take it out of the case. Recently picked up almost the entire Stratovarius discography but I doubt I'll really listen to the actual CDs.

It's absurd how good this album is. It's been a while since I bought a power metal album and instantly got into it that quickly.    Anyone excited for Rocket League coming out on Tuesday?

They seriously could have cut out the first 5 or so episodes and it would have been better. The real lack of focus kind of hurt the show, as Piper isn't a focus (thank goodness) until later on. It also left too much open for the next season, which I have little to no interest for after this season.  With that, are there any shows to recommend? I'm tempted on House of Cards and Daredevil, but I've been lacking a motivation to watch those. I'm also down for older shows as well, just keep in mind I'm not going to another site(s) to stream/download anything, Netflix is fine (despite being the Canadian version).  I'm also a big fan of the schedule that has taken shape in recent weeks. Also a nice touch by our mods to put up links on the sidebar to the current scheduled event for that week.  Edit: After seeing /u/donn16 post the guide to Brainstorm, it has gotten me motivated (again) to do two I've wanted to write up for some time. I've gotten interest for one of them by some users here, the other I feel I'd have to split into two parts (it's that big of a discography) so I'm kind of putting feelers out there for more interest. If there isn't any, no reason to do them, right?"
PowerMetal,3c2h3f,Fazermint,2,Sat Jul 4 05:26:33 2015 UTC,"House of Cards and Daredevil are both brilliant. HoC Season 3 was somewhat disappointing, but still enjoyable. I got the impression that they want to line up the next big arc with what will be going on next year, so this season was largely filler.  Not sure what's on Canada's netflix, but here's what I would recommend for what's on the US version:   Star Trek Star Trek: The Next Generation Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Sherlock Doctor Who Parks and Recreation Breaking Bad Sons of Anarchy     Holy hell, turn back now if you don't want anime   Attack on Titan Fullmetal Alchemist (+ Brotherhood) Deathnote InuYasha Nura: Rise of the Yokai Clan Noragami Black Butler"

PowerMetal,3c2h3f,malkvinegar,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:01:31 2015 UTC,"Highly recommend DS9. It's actually a show where missing episodes is not a good thing (unlike TNG where some episodes are self contained). A lot of people write it off because it has a slow approach but when it gets there, it's worthwhile. Also, Cardassians become amazing in this show, whereas we only get a glimpse of them in TNG.  Voyager is more like TNG where the reset button gets hit after every episode, but a worthwhile watch, especially for characters like The Doctor, Seven of Nine and Janeway."

Allow to me demonstrate;  Me: I'll start at the beginning, because I won't get anything if I come in halfway through.  Them: Oh no! Don't start there! It's old, boring and not needed to understand the basic premise.  Me: Okay...I'll start when they rebooted the show.  Them: Oh no! The writer was horrible and you'll hate the show.

I gave it a fair chance, watching about half of it before I realized its entire plot could have been told in 10 minutes of screen time, and the rest of the show was just making you sit and wonder if the plot would ever advance.  FMA Brotherhood (Brotherhood being the remastered series and the one you should go with) is really good. But what, Attack on Titan is the tightest shit I've ever seen.

PowerMetal,3by11y,UnlostHorizon,17,Fri Jul 3 02:29:20 2015 UTC,I really like how none of the metal subreddits give two shits about the silly drama some people are trying to stir up. But I still think we should show solidarity in some way. I propose that we post nothing but PelleK until Victoria is put back into power with a higher raise and her own brand of ice cream bars.  That'll put butts into seats.

PowerMetal,3by11y,_Ek_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:57:56 2015 UTC,"He tends to cover a lot of Power Metal and Anime songs and has quite the vocal range, but it's one of those things where he tends to overuse the falsetto range.  He tends to get quite a bit of hate around these parts, mostly due to his lack of vocal training as well as his covers not being the greatest.  Although, his stuff with Damnation Angels isn't too bad and worth checking out. Actually, feel free to do a quick YouTube search and check him out."
PowerMetal,3by11y,Spiner202,2,Sat Jul 4 00:08:45 2015 UTC,Allright thanks for explaining. Ive just seen some disney covers and the one where he sings a duo with Tommy Karevik.

PowerMetal,3byspj,Edledhron,3,Fri Jul 3 08:23:15 2015 UTC,I feel like Triosphere would fucking kill this song (in a good way).  Xandria's style really doesn't fit with Sonata. Especially the vocals.
