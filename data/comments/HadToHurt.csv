HadToHurt,3e23pl,semvhu,4,Tue Jul 21 10:52:23 2015 UTC,"Being drunk and combative with the cops is a good start toward getting your teeth knocked out. I ain't saying that's what she deserved, but it sheds a little more light on the overall situation."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,Twelveinchdragon,19,Tue Jul 21 15:00:13 2015 UTC,"Two of her teeth being knocked out was just one item in a laundry list of injuries including head trauma, a concussion, impairment to memory and cognitive function, and PTSD. Whether she was drunk and combative or not, no one deserves that for kicking a police officer while handcuffed. It's excessive, even if she hadn't been just a 100 pound 18 year old girl. Literally almost any other cop would not have acted this way so don't try to defend what this cop did by saying it's expected. It's not and it's insulting to every other officer on the force to say it is."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,BakerBalls,6,Tue Jul 21 17:19:30 2015 UTC,"Hey....leave the hero cop alone. This girl really look like she got him good. She could have gotten his pants dirty, or worse, he could have been slightly bruised!!"
HadToHurt,3e23pl,Vitto9,2,Tue Jul 21 18:19:13 2015 UTC,"I had a CO who used to give a safety brief that always contained ""Never pet a burning dog"". Basically in regular speech that means that you shouldn't intentionally walk into a bad situation that you can clearly see is a bad situation.   She was drunk and she assaulted the police when they were arresting her boyfriend. Strike one. She continued to be combative (and it's safe to assume she was talking mad shit the entire time, since drunk people tend to have diarrhea of the mouth). When he pushed her into the chair, that should have been her cue to shut the fuck up and sit there while she waited to be seen. She instead took it to mean ""I should kick this guy"". Depending on how long he had been dealing with her shit, it's easy to see why he did what he did. I'm not saying that what he did was right by any means, but if you've dealt with enough drunken idiots, you'll understand the cop's frustration.   Cops aren't superhuman. They aren't impervious to attack. Everyone has a breaking point, and this woman kept pushing until she found it. Generally speaking, attacking someone twice your size is a stupid thing to do. Attacking someone twice your size when they let you keep walking the first time is an incredibly stupid thing to do.   I'm not trying to defend what the cop did by any means, but the outcome isn't exactly a surprise. If you poke a bear long enough, you can't be shocked when you get mauled."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,Mulsanne,3,Tue Jul 21 22:40:24 2015 UTC,so don't try to defend what this cop did b   Sounds more like he's impugning her behavior than defending the cop. It's not even a very fine hair to split. He's just saying that not being drunk and combative is a good idea.
HadToHurt,3e23pl,semvhu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:34 2015 UTC,Thank you. That's exactly what I was saying.
HadToHurt,3e23pl,Twelveinchdragon,0,Tue Jul 21 20:29:19 2015 UTC,"He's saying that being drunk and combative towards the cop in the way she was could potentially get your teeth knocked out. In reality it won't with almost all cops. Maybe defending isn't the correct word, Hut he's certainly attempting to normalize this cops behavior."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,Mulsanne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:49:37 2015 UTC,He's saying that being drunk and combative towards the cop in the way she was could potentially get your teeth knocked ou   Sounds like that's what you're saying.

HadToHurt,3e23pl,Mulsanne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:48:53 2015 UTC,"Not sure how else to describe it. He clearly said one thing, you injected your own meaning and then tried to act like he meant that from the start.  But he didn't say that, you did."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,Twelveinchdragon,0,Tue Jul 21 22:09:28 2015 UTC,"""Being drunk and combative is a good start towards getting your teeth knocked out."" How else am I supposed to interpret that if it doesn't mean ""Being drunk and combative could get your teeth knocked out."""

HadToHurt,3e23pl,Twelveinchdragon,-2,Tue Jul 21 20:28:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's literally what I'm replying to. Why would I reply to something I didn't even read?"
HadToHurt,3e23pl,semvhu,3,Tue Jul 21 21:12:17 2015 UTC,"No, you're actually a few levels down from that. And you're putting words in my mouth."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,piglip,0,Tue Jul 21 21:18:27 2015 UTC,"Police officers are professional representatives of the law and should act as such.  No amount of verbal/physical assault should make the cop lose it, which this one did.  And for the record, when I say professional, I mean it in a literal sense and not that cops should be authoritative/militaristic."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,semvhu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:36 2015 UTC,"Sure. I agree with this. He overreacted to the situation. However, according to the article, she had been aggressive for quite some time. We only got to see the culmination of this in the very short clip we see, for which many people are quick to pass judgement on the cop.  Should the cop have slammed her to the ground? Should he have been aggressive with her? Should he get off with no repercussions simply because he's a cop in the line of duty? No. She was restrained and was of little threat to anyone by this point.  But she kicked one final time. Keep poking a puma with a stick and eventually you'll get your face torn off. Being drunk and disorderly often has its consequences, deserved or not."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,ate3690,24,Tue Jul 21 20:35:18 2015 UTC,Stop resisting!!!!
HadToHurt,3e23pl,StoicGunner,8,Tue Jul 21 11:38:12 2015 UTC,She's gonna get charged with assault for kicking him.
HadToHurt,3e23pl,triedtostayaway,2,Tue Jul 21 15:20:33 2015 UTC,"As she should. He overreacted, but she did act like a dumbass."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,gizzardgullet,27,Tue Jul 21 16:46:32 2015 UTC,I'm not saying that when part of your job is to make people comply and restrain people when needed that it's not easy to lose your shit. But cops really need to stop losing their shit. They should be psychologically  screened for anger issues before being hired.
HadToHurt,3e23pl,VTX1800,21,Tue Jul 21 11:55:24 2015 UTC,I agree but also...maybe don't kick a cop.  People should know that will result in a serious ass kicking.
HadToHurt,3e23pl,Fenris78,27,Tue Jul 21 12:20:26 2015 UTC,"Gentle kick to the shin definitely warrants having your teeth knocked out /s  She shouldn't have done that (though she was shoved into the chair pretty hard to start with), but the reciprocal level of force should be proportionate. That guy is a bully."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,VTX1800,9,Tue Jul 21 12:56:31 2015 UTC,I didn't say she deserved to have her teeth knocked out.  All I said was don't kick a cop.  Seems pretty logical to me.
HadToHurt,3e23pl,tokeyoh,6,Tue Jul 21 13:20:06 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is, he should've kicked her in the shin back twice as hard?"
HadToHurt,3e23pl,ZaenisR,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:36:58 2015 UTC,"Evidently the report says she kicked him the ""groin area""; doesn't justify what he did though"
HadToHurt,3e23pl,Decalance,-4,Tue Jul 21 21:46:50 2015 UTC,"Uh, violence against authorities. That's the law."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,Reverend_Twitch,3,Tue Jul 21 13:19:37 2015 UTC,"And beating the fuck out of the suspect is due process, right?"
HadToHurt,3e23pl,EAJ97,-5,Tue Jul 21 20:03:32 2015 UTC,"I just want to point out, from what I've noticed, it seems like cops have a guide line for their safety. Wether or not the perp is in cuffs, they follow their rules and SHOULD make an assessment of the situation. Was this one uncalled for, yes, however I believe she should not have kicked him. Don't fuck with the law or the ones enforcing it and there won't be a problem. ((I just want to say, if the law NEEDS changing, by all means, use whatever to get it changed. I'm all for action))"
HadToHurt,3e23pl,Fenris78,9,Tue Jul 21 13:21:53 2015 UTC,"She shouldn't have. Equally the cop pushed her pretty hard into the chair to start with. Police should be looking to de-escalate situations like this, not provoke people into (impotently) reacting, and then using that as an excuse to inflict GBH."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,Rockonfoo,2,Tue Jul 21 13:36:30 2015 UTC,This should be taught in every police academy   And if it already is than cops should LEARN this
HadToHurt,3e23pl,BakerBalls,0,Tue Jul 21 16:10:18 2015 UTC,"These ""heroes"" are supposed to be trained to be able to handle situations like this calmly. The girl looks to be 100 lbs and is handcuffed. Fuck outta here with the ""will result in an ass-kicking"" shit. She could have easily been subdued in other ways.   I hope the cop enjoys his paid vacation when he's suspended for a couple weeks and returns to the force like nothing happened. That is, of course, if there's any discipline taken against him at all."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,VTX1800,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:22:24 2015 UTC,"At what point in my comment did I say he handled it properly?  So get the fuck out of here with your assumption bullshit.  All I said was she shouldn't have kicked the cop.  Anytime you assault an officer, it's not going to end well."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,BakerBalls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:41 2015 UTC,"Clearly he's not fit to be an officer of the law. The way he slammed her down in the chair was already with too much force. She was probably reacting to that. No, you shouldn't ever hit a cop, but she appeared to barely touch him with that kick and the cop could have killed her with that amount of force on such a hard surface."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,vadkert,-7,Tue Jul 21 18:38:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed. A bit excessive, but it's unreasonable to be a combative ass and then be surprised by retaliation. The cop lost his cool, but anyone using the phrase 'brutality' is overstepping. Someone doesn't need to have 'anger issues' to react violently to violence. It's not like he continued to batter her after the fact. She was told to sit down and refused, so he forced her to sit down. She continued to act violently towards him (in a hospital, by the way. It's not like this was at the police station or in an area well removed from other people) and he stopped that.   Taking some perspective on it, this is a drunken, physically combative person that has shown a continuous disregard for police instruction. How much more benefit of the doubt is supposed to be extended to this person? There's nothing to say she wouldn't have continued to behave this way towards the doctors or nurses who were there to make sure her dumb ass wasn't going to die.   The cop was, in a vacuum, a little extreme with the takedown, and he should be disciplined for it. But this pales in comparison to actually, demonstrable examples of police brutality, and lumping this in with the former discredits and undermines what is actually a really serious issue. Of course, what's more important is for a lot of people is to take any questionable behavior by law enforcement and extrapolate it to fit a narrative of wide-reaching, systemic corruption and abuses of power, IE: The US is a police state. And then to throw anyone not towing that (simplistic, inaccurate) party line under the bus of being a 'cop apologist.'"
HadToHurt,3e23pl,LetTheDogBeg,9,Tue Jul 21 15:14:54 2015 UTC,Same shit every cop related thread
HadToHurt,3e23pl,Mortmortmort,2,Tue Jul 21 15:24:13 2015 UTC,"A drunk, uncooperative, and physically combative person is the type of person I wouldnt even give the chance to kick me. He put his dick within the range of her foot, he should have known better. And he shouldn't have gotten that angry and retaliated. He was quoted to saying ""after my adrenaline wore off... "", so that dude's (a trained police officer) adrenaline started pumping because a drunk person kicked at him? That guy needs to settle the fuck down.   Somewhat related, have you ever been to one of those petting zoos/farms and theres one of those ""I bite"" signs next to the horse. If you went up to the horse and it bit you, what would you do? What do the handlers do when working with that animal? If the horse starts kicking and biting, Im sure the handlers adrenaline would start pumping, but I doubt they would cause physical harm to the animal."

HadToHurt,3e23pl,SenorDing_Dong,2,Tue Jul 21 13:22:12 2015 UTC,"They should be psychologically  screened for anger issues before being hired.   There's exceptions for sure, but if the aggressive-with-something-to-prove types were filtered out, there wouldn't be too many cops."

HadToHurt,3e23pl,Fenris78,2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:27 2015 UTC,"Outside that he should not have done that it was a nice slam. As someone who doesn't know about any police training, do they learn that?"
HadToHurt,3e23pl,BakerBalls,13,Tue Jul 21 21:48:48 2015 UTC,I'm fairly sure that any large man can slam a handcuffed <140lb woman to the floor without any training.

HadToHurt,3e23pl,markgbe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:32 2015 UTC,"Ooh, and she was handcuffed. She must have been quite vile to provoke such a murderous response from a 'peace officer' while in custody.  One would think the police would screen applicants for unstable individuals who beat women."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,InfinityCircuit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:51:13 2015 UTC,Kicking a police officer is probably never a good idea.... just saying.
HadToHurt,3e23pl,spies4,-2,Tue Jul 21 22:34:30 2015 UTC,"...Walker either ""escorted her to the floor""   Best line ever. On a serious note, she kicked at him after being roughly sat down, and his response was to slam her into the ground.  Definitely excessive, and I hope he gets appropriately punished. However, if one is ever in this situation, any kind of retaliation or resistance is met with overwhelming force nowadays. Best to just comply, then lawyer up later and hit them back with legal action instead."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,BrotherChe,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:15:15 2015 UTC,"She was already in custody after being arrested then assaulted the officer, he could have done it lighter but what he did was fine in this situation."
HadToHurt,3e23pl,bryanrobh,2,Tue Jul 21 12:22:05 2015 UTC,How is that response appropriate? He was not in danger and he was aware of that.
HadToHurt,3e23pl,NeverBeenStung,-7,Tue Jul 21 15:18:58 2015 UTC,Deserved.  Do not assault an officer especially while in their custody.
HadToHurt,3e23pl,bryanrobh,5,Tue Jul 21 20:41:56 2015 UTC,"Deserved? I mean sure, kicking a cop is a very dumb move. But you really think she deserved that response?"
HadToHurt,3e23pl,NeverBeenStung,-8,Tue Jul 21 15:26:41 2015 UTC,That is assault.  Plain and simple.  If she gets away with that it wont end there.  Now she will not do that shit again.
HadToHurt,3e23pl,bryanrobh,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:25 2015 UTC,So you do think that was an appropriate response by the cop? K.
HadToHurt,3e23pl,moronistrumpet,-5,Tue Jul 21 15:36:24 2015 UTC,No it was an over reaction but she should know better than to attack a cop.

Pepperdine's Jason Walberg, #12, gouges the eyes of BYU's Jonathan Tavernari, #45, during the game at the Marriott Center. No foul was called on the play. Although Tavernari missed the basket immediately following the eye gouge, he did not seem to be injured.

HadToHurt,3b7y6c,Username__Irrelevant,4,Sat Jun 27 01:17:22 2015 UTC,"Look at his right leg when he falls. His rope is below him because he is lead climbing (leading the rope up the wall and clipping as you go) and since he gets his leg between the rope and the wall the rope pulls tight and flips him upside down, also giving him a decent amount of rope burn on his leg."
HadToHurt,3b7y6c,extreme_diabetus,2,Sat Jun 27 12:37:40 2015 UTC,"The rope is tied at his waist.  The reason he flips is because he catches his leg, so he's hanging by his leg."

Some people said it was way overkill but as we see in the clip - it makes a world of difference.

When I saw that Tyson Douglas fight from the very beginning I knew something was wrong with Tyson. I always suspected that Tyson had been drinking earlier that day. He just was not even close to being himself, and it was far more than just being out of shape.  I remember Sugar Ray Leonard saying that he thought Tyson was having an off day, but I really think he was on something or drunk."

His personal life was in turmoil and it was beleive that contributed to this loss. Also, he was becoming sloppy with his fighting. Not relying on jabs and inconsistent ""peek a boo "" style of boxing that drove him to success in the first place.

HadToHurt,3as29t,uncleskid33,3,Tue Jun 23 20:15:34 2015 UTC,Fuckin A that was a big hit.  I thought they made it illegal for tacklers to lower their heads for helmet to helmet contact?
HadToHurt,3as29t,rastapasta808,3,Thu Jun 25 07:59:30 2015 UTC,Targeting the head/helmet is definitely a penalty but after watching this a few times I'm not even sure this hit is illegal. Especially on the second replay it kinda looks like he throws the shoulder more than a helmet to helmet shot.
HadToHurt,3as29t,ozelegend,2,Thu Jun 25 22:29:57 2015 UTC,Is that legal to hit a guy before he has the ball?
HadToHurt,3as29t,AirWhale1,9,Wed Jun 24 03:08:27 2015 UTC,"Well he did have the ball, for about 0.01 seconds, but he had it.  Idk about college football, but in the NFL, you can wave your hand before catching a kick to call a ""fair catch"", which means the play will stop when you catch the ball and no one can tackle you. If you don't call that...than the defense has a green light to totally wreck your shit the moment the ball touches you."
HadToHurt,3as29t,ozelegend,7,Wed Jun 24 07:34:12 2015 UTC,I'd have been waving so hard I wouldn't have caught the ball
HadToHurt,3as29t,Frumundahs4men,3,Wed Jun 24 09:23:57 2015 UTC,During a punt you cannot hit the returner until he has touched the ball but during a kick off the ball is live (hence why the kick off team can recover the ball during an onside kick as long as the ball travels 10 yards) so you can legally hit the player before he touches the ball.

HadToHurt,3abux8,Teresa_Count,9,Fri Jun 19 01:51:49 2015 UTC,"Adults have much more inertia than children, due to their greater mass. Smaller things slow down faster than larger things. When a kid slides down, the acceleration accrued during the steep bits of the slide is mostly lost going down the flat bits of it, so they stay on the track.  For the person in the gif, they lose less acceleration during the flat bits, and it builds up. By the second flat bit, he's accelerating horizontally faster than gravity, and thus flies through the air a bit before hitting the slide further down.  Unfortunately, since he is unable to stop, he continues to fly off the horizontal bits with that acceleration. You can see this in how he hits roughly the same spot every time: the very end of the flat bit."
HadToHurt,3abux8,meterion,2,Fri Jun 19 02:23:27 2015 UTC,"It's not even safe for children actually. If you look at the beginning of the gif the slide was blocked off with wooden posts, these guys decided to see why."

This bias is attributed to a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to recognize their ineptitude. Conversely, highly skilled individuals tend to underestimate their relative competence, erroneously assuming that tasks which are easy for them are also easy for others.   As David Dunning and Justin Kruger of Cornell University conclude: ""The miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others.""

HadToHurt,39ias4,Kill_Frosty,10,Thu Jun 11 22:23:04 2015 UTC,This happens at the top of your screen around 5 seconds in.  The Blue player (Phaneuf) is known to make big hits. The player being hit (Mike Sauer) was concussed on the play and to this day hasn't been able to play a game due to concussion symptoms.
HadToHurt,39ias4,M3mph1s,8,Thu Jun 11 22:25:07 2015 UTC,"That sucks so hard.  On the replay, it looks like the body check dislodged his helmet.  So when he went back against the glass, the back of his head made solid contact, sans-helmet."
HadToHurt,39ias4,PunchinPriests,6,Fri Jun 12 04:21:22 2015 UTC,Yup that's exactly what happened. It sucks too because this is normal and almost everyone thought he was ok. Sadly sometimes things like this happen.   It's a fast movie sport and kids are taught to keep their heads up from a young age. He looks down for the puck and Dion takes advantage.
HadToHurt,39ias4,PunchinPriests,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:08:41 2015 UTC,"Why did his helmet fly off? Not strapped on well, or just the huge power of the hit? I doubt he would be out of play had his helmet been on when he hit that wall"
HadToHurt,39ias4,Eagle1337,2,Fri Jun 12 10:14:24 2015 UTC,"Could be a few different reasons.  For one, it's popular to wear the helmet strap loosely as it is more comfortable for the player and allows more head movement. The issue is when they get hit (most times not as hard as the OP) they can slip out of it. Here the hit is so hard or goes flying off.  A 2nd reason is the hit was just that hard. The NHL didn't even really enforce visors until a few years ago when players kept getting severe eye injuries from skate blades or fast moving rubber pucks.  Basically it's just how the sport is. You have guys as strong as they can be skating at fast speeds for a puck and if you want to score you have to go through them.  That's why at the end you see his dad give his nod of approval, cause it was a strong play."
HadToHurt,39ias4,Cuddlezekittehs,2,Fri Jun 12 10:28:16 2015 UTC,"Well if you don't fasten the strap I guess it's the price you pay. I wouldn't think it could come off if it was done up properly. Then again I don't think he expected a hit that big..   Yup, brutal but fair play."

HadToHurt,39fsz9,linuxphoney,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:46:43 2015 UTC,I was trying for the life of me to figure out how spinal fractures were even possible in arm wrestling.
HadToHurt,39fsz9,peterhobo1,3,Thu Jun 11 21:46:20 2015 UTC,It's a spiral fracture of the humerus.  So your arm doesn't break in half or snap like you would normally picture.  It actually ends up spiralling all the way up your arm.  So the break starts right above your elbow and then spirals all the way up your arm.  Source: Happened to me in a Tapas bar in Spain over a game of never have I ever.
HadToHurt,39fsz9,Tapputi,2,Fri Jun 12 10:04:44 2015 UTC,The same thing that causes a sound when you snap a branch. The snap.

She sustained a concussion and spent the night in a local hospital. On 25 October, Totmianina said that, although she felt pain, she had no memory of the accident and was not afraid to return to the ice. She recovered from her injuries rapidly and was able to return to the ice within days.   Although Totmianina did not blame him, the accident weighed heavily on Marinin and when the pair returned to training, he was unable to lift her due to panic. He began seeing a sport psychologist who helped him overcome it.   EDIT: Picture of her face afterwards."

HadToHurt,37gasb,saekla,5,Wed Jun 24 21:02:42 2015 UTC,Does anyone know what causes something to start wobbling at high speeds?
HadToHurt,37gasb,empetrum,8,Wed May 27 18:43:24 2015 UTC,"downhill boards are designed to go high speeds, but once they go past a certain threshold (all boards are different) the trucks start to become unbalanced, in a sense, as well as the whole board; therefore the board starts to wobble, of course you can carve back and forth hard to try and reduce speed, but the longer the wobbles go for the worse it gets and eventually you will wreck."
HadToHurt,37gasb,backdoorintruder,12,Wed May 27 20:37:04 2015 UTC,"While the board does have something to do with it, it really is based on the rider. Weight is usually placed heavily over the front of the board to keep it stable at high speeds, the rider must be able to control it by keeping his feet and ankles relaxed in order to prevent wobbles. From personal experience I would say this is a mind game, staying relaxed as you pick up speed is a challenge, and confidence is very important. James Kelly is the guy in the gif, he is probably one of the best downhill skaters in the world, but it even happens to the best.  He was clearly going super fast, and maybe was getting ready to pre drift (slide the board, to slow down quickly) before that upcoming corner. The video this is from is awesome, the guy rips. Source: https://vimeo.com/106099077"
HadToHurt,37gasb,Cairo77,2,Wed May 27 20:44:18 2015 UTC,In addition I would say speed wobble is generated from the back of the board. There is less weight and the vibrations due to high speed can no long be absorbed by the bushings.  Went I raced down hill I wanted a board where the trucks were top mounted at each end. I tried to split my weight 60/40 due to me being a light guy in general in order to reduce wobble.
HadToHurt,37gasb,NoShftShck16,2,Thu May 28 03:00:15 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, it's not the board, it's definitely the rider. The most important thing is confidence and staying calm and loose.   You get speed wobbles because of the way your body naturally balances itself, if you tense up and you hit a bump your body will automatically try to adjust to regain balance, only if you're tense your body will overcompensate and then you have to lean the other way again to not fall off, this starts of as a tiny bit of wobble but this very quickly can result in being thrown off your board.  I've only had the wobbles one, and that was in a turn where the road was covered with twigs and pebbles, somehow I magically managed to not fall off and ride it out, it's safe to say I'm not going down that hill anymore because I don't like falling, sliding across asphalt and then hitting a tree."

Theres a video on his instagram of him moving his leg and you can see his muscle through the huge hole in his knee. Ive fallen like this (while not going 55-60 mph), and you pretty much only bang up your elbows and knees, with some road rash on your hips.   When you skate fast hills, falling and hurting yourself is just something you have to deal with.

HadToHurt,3735wd,Year3030,-1,Sun May 24 17:19:35 2015 UTC,"Well his mistake was he popped the front of the bike up which means that inertia pulled it away from him, e.g. he pushed it away faster than he was falling, plus if you pick up the wheel too high I think it would have been harder to land."
HadToHurt,3735wd,Borngrumpy,11,Sun May 24 17:21:37 2015 UTC,His mistake was riding a bike off a cliff.

HadToHurt,36wwc3,pmmeurpics,6,Fri May 22 21:04:38 2015 UTC,"There is a black object on the zipline several feet before tree. Most likely a rope is supposed to be attached to that object and several people keep pressure on it when someone is nearing the end. This is a catch rope. Someone is supposed to stand at the end holding that rope ready to slow the rider down. He slammed in to the tree because nobody attached the catch rope or bothered to use one. My grandparents had a huge zipline in their backyard. One day a girl went down and her father was dicking around talking instead of holding the rope. He let her slam right into the utility pole at the end of the line. She got fucked up bad.   edit My grandparent's zipline didn't have a seat either. You held on to two wooden handles on either side of the pulley, 20+ feet off the ground. That thing made men out of boys and victims out of those with sweaty hands."

HadToHurt,36bw38,daash,8,Mon May 18 12:17:00 2015 UTC,"So I only trained for 2 years, but to me it looks like he did mostly everything right. It looks like he might have been tensing his shoulders, so all the power might have been coming from them (a.k.a. a really weak punch) instead of his whole body.  It looks like his rotation is good, his heel doesn't come up, and otherwise has decent form. The only thing I can think of is that he just hasn't hit enough hard things with his fists to strengthen them against that kind of force. A lot of times while training, you are just hitting the air. Your hands aren't trained or used to hitting hard material like wooden boards. That is why in dojos over in Japan you will see the serious people hitting boards a LOT. Training your body to take that kind of damage is part of becoming a fierce opponent. Not my cup of tee, deforming my bones/skin, but I don't go around trying to break boards with my fists, either."

HadToHurt,369lrv,NoSpicyFood,13,Sun May 17 17:12:55 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure there's reasonable suspicion when you pull up babbling like an idiot about opting out of a simple identification check when you're driving what looks like a semi truck at a border.   He wasn't at the border. If he was, he would likely be in the wrong. This is an interior checkpoint that was set up via the Patriot Act. They can be located upwards of 100 miles from any border. The government claims they're for immigration, but they're all filled with drug sniffing dogs. This is interesting since drug checkpoints are illegal; the government can't stop you to check for general illegal activity. (It, unfortunately, can stop you without suspicion for DUI and immigration checkpoints, at least according to the Fourth Amendment hating SCOTUS.)   At any rate, there are a lot of great checkpoint refusal videos out there. They usually last 5 to 10 minutes where the agents get butthurt and go cry to their supervisors because someone won't talk to them. Unsurprisingly, most of these agents think you must answer their questions, hence the butthurt. Apparently they have zero familiarity with the Fifth Amendment."

Can you please explain what is it that troubles you so much about answering a couple of questions? Specifically, what is wrong with giving your ID at a police checkpoint, be it at a border or in the dead geographical center of your country? I am genuinly curious.   The onus is on the government to prove that it has a legitimate reason for stopping me. If I'm on a real border, that's fine, but it shouldn't be allowed to stop and harass me without individualized suspicion. This is what has led to much of the US police state today. If you ignore a cop, you're bound to get beaten or shot. Or if you use your rights explicitly, your window may be smashed.   The government must always be forced to justify all of its actions. Once we start giving in and demanding compliance without cause, we've already started sliding down the slope. I know it's a cliche to reference Nazi Germany for anything ever (because I guess they aren't the greatest example of bad government?), but people often wonder how an entire nation could follow such evil. It isn't a simply answer, but a key component was necessarily incremental compliance. Give the government increasing power without a way to stop it and it won't stop without force.   Beyond such an idealistic reasoning, there's also the practical reason that information is power. If you tell the government something, it can use that against you. There's no way it can benefit you to give up information. Or for another practical reason, I've been stuck waiting for these checkpoints for 30 minutes before just due to sheer traffic volume (near the Hoover Dam). The games these agents play are a waste of time."

Are you aware that they lose their qualified immunity when they violate a person's civil rights? The reason is because they are expected to know they can't force people to do things like talk to the government. Search YouTube for checkpoint refusal videos. The theme you'll find is that the agents routinely tell citizens that they must answer government questions. These people are a huge part of the problem.   But maybe you're right. I mean, remember when all those black people used to sit in diners and demand service? Why did they have to make the jobs of those waitresses harder? They should have just petitioned their legislators, right?"

Hell, the driver was just as cordial. The agent then felt like violating the man's Fourth Amendment rights by breaking and entering into his truck.  And this whole thing was a violation of the man's Constitutionally protected right to travel freely - and I don't mean just because of the checkpoint itself (which the SCOTUS has incorrectly held up). The man should have been allowed to leave as soon as he declined to answer questions and the agents had no reasonable suspicion of any other crime.

Since you and I are the only ones likely reading any of this now, you can take a moment to ask yourself: Which one of has researched the specific court cases on these issues and which one of us is making stuff up?   The agents can briefly stop people on a non-targeted basis. That means they can either stop every X number car or they can stop every car. The same applies to DUI and fruit checkpoints. Then they can ask a few questions. If the citizen declines to answer, the agents have leeway to inquire why, but they cannot force the person into secondary on that basis alone. Furthermore, the agents cannot prolong the detain in any significant way on that basis alone. If they wish to detain a person until they get the information they want, they need articuable reasonable suspicion. To go further and search a vehicle they need consent or probable cause. These agents had none of that. They didn't suspect this driver of any crime whatsoever. They violated his rights because he didn't immediately bow to their authority.

Affirming that yes he is a us citizen merely tells the agent he is entitled to the rights to travel the us roads freely and he could move on. Until that happens they have to assume he isnt as he has not given them any indication he is thus there probable cause. Like it or not they were 100% within their right to do that.

HadToHurt,369lrv,-SagaQ-,-3,Sun May 24 19:21:02 2015 UTC,"What part of ""Border patrol checkpoint"" seems involuntary?"
HadToHurt,369lrv,drkztan,6,Sun May 17 15:24:34 2015 UTC,"This isn't about voluntary or not. He did not volunteer to having anyone enter his vehicle, which he has the right to do as a US citizen. (Also, Texas, where this occurred, has the castle law. If the police did not have the right to enter his property, which if like AZ's castle law, included your vehicle, then he would have the right to defend it with lethal force. Wouldn't ever be a smart idea, but thems the laws)  I have been through those checkpoints. I have had them just wave me through, stop me to ask if I was a US citizen (to which the first time I said ""what?"" and was waved through, the second time I don't actually know what he said but I just said ""US citizen"" and was waved through). Being white I never had a problem personally. They did, one time, shine a flashlight through my ""as dark as they could be legally tinted"" windows when I was moving between AF bases.  With that said, they need a reason to enter your vehicle. Not rolling down your window is not a reason. It could be a ""suspicious act"" that they would need to attempt to get a warrant for though, but this looks like a case of them being angry and smashing a window when the guy wouldn't roll it down.  IF they got a warrant to search him, then sure. Otherwise a random checkpoint in the middle of the US is not a lawful search and seizure situation. Again, this is constitution stuff dude."

HadToHurt,369lrv,drkztan,0,Mon May 18 03:14:49 2015 UTC,"I'm going to need a second explanation to this: what is so wrong about these inquiries? i mean so many people seem genuinly infuriated over such a simple question. Why is this?   I mean, initially the cop did not have a reasonable suspicion about the truck driver for him to force his way into his vehicle. But you get a guy in a huge truck refusing to even say where he is from, and it's at least reasonable to suspect about what might be in the truck.  Before you answer or berate me or whatever, please think through the following: would you have the same opinion if you considered that, for example, a human traficking unit could get away from this checkpoint in the same manner this guy tried to? Of course if there are any, some will get through, they don't actually search each and every vehicle. That's why they personally ask questions to the drivers, to assess the situation."
HadToHurt,369lrv,idontknowhowreddit,1 point,Mon May 18 04:43:27 2015 UTC,"You are kind of throwing out a lot of facts in this.  It's not unreasonable to have suspicion, but I am pretty sure if they said ""Look, you didn't cooperate so we got a warrant and now if you don't let us look through the truck you are breaking the law, that the driver would have gotten out. He was on the phone, probably with an attorney, or just some ""friend who knows what he's talking about"" (who is probably technically right, but not all that bright to say ""no dude, let them bash the window in, then you can sue!"" to which the response to the lawsuit would be ""you should have just opened the window"" and the person will have wasted time and money on the lawsuit).  It's the fact that the officers are breaking the law. Not that they don't have intentions that follow the idea of the law, but they are not using their power properly.  Furthermore, where did you see that the guy was refusing to say where he was from? He just refused to open his windows. It's similar to the police officer who gets pissed at the dude he pulls over for not fully opening his window. The person inside did everything they were required, but the cop was upset that the person didn't do what they said that was outside their authority and breaks the window. There is no reason you HAVE to roll down your window for these guys, they just want you to (and for generally good reason). They can stop you, yes. They can look in at you, yes. They can ask you questions, yes. You are not required to respond though. You might have hearing problems or be mute for all they know. A US citizen doesn't even have to speak English so they might not have any idea what is going on, they just have to know to stop at stop signs (I am not saying that is what is going on here, but it is a general truth that makes for further good reasoning besides ""liberty"" that makes for these laws).  This just reeks of a case of ""respect my authority!"" The cops have legitimate (and annoyingly bureaucratic) to require these things. However, it is not within their authority to decide that they are allowed to enter. That is someone else's job, and for good reason. Having a third party as a sort of ""checks and balances"" stops angry cops from over extending their power. Sure, they usually get access more often than they technically should, but that's a combo of ""erring on the side of safety"" and not really respecting the concept of liberty (as pretty much most Americans do not, and that's fine, because most of us can't handle liberty).  This isn't a case of ""what if human trafficking!?"" Because that's what the border checkpoints are for, not the border patrol checkpoints within the US, as there is no such thing as trafficking US citizens between states. The idea is to find sketchy people (heck, like the guy in the video) and find them doing wrong without breaking US law. Smashing a dude's window without a proper search warrant is not legal within US law. The thing is, though, that in the US the laws even protect illegal aliens. It's designed that way because we are the ""land of the free."" Sure, if they are caught they are going to be sent out of the country and what not, but while here they are to be treated with human decency, which again means not needlessly destroying their property. Search warrants prove a need, and you don't just get search warrants willy nilly.  Now, if this guy pulled a gun, or was actually stopped because he tried to run through the stop and had devices deployed to stop his vehicle and was already breaking laws, that would be one thing. If a guy is just acting like a privileged jackass and refusing to followed requests made by the border patrol agents, all they can do is give him a hard time without a warrant. Now, had they taken the time to keep him stopped, called up some people, got a warrant because he was indeed acting sketch. Then they said ""Look, we have a warrant to search your vehicle. If you do not open it within a timely fashion we will enter by force,"" and he didn't say ""hold on, I want to call my lawyer about this"" or something else to say ""I understand what you are saying, but I want to see what my legal options are,"" then yeah, they have the right, power, and authority to bust his windows open.    This reminds me of lethal force training I had. We discussed one time after a large storm up north when there were snow drifts that allowed protesters to hop base fences easily. They were protesting that there was a nuclear bomber on the runway. They ran to the bomber and started hitting it with blunt objects.  Without realizing it these people were demonstrating an ability to cause lethal damages to themselves and their surroundings because that aircraft was armed and hypothetically under a freak hit could cause a detonation. Now, those police officers who were (luckily) well trained decided not to use lethal force. They chose that because the protesters immediately gave up what they were doing, and the cops had no reason to believe that their intent was actually to try and detonate any nuclear arms.  My point being that things aren't as black and white as people mention. ""But he was dangerous"" isn't a reason to shoot someone, because they might have no intent to do anything. That's why there is generally controversy around ""police assisted suicide"" where someone acts like they are a threat to get themselves killed. Many times it's easy to say ""well, the cops made a reasonable assessment even though we found out he was shooting blanks."" Other times we hear ""they knew he had a mental problem, and he wasn't actually showing any physical signs of being a threat, but just claiming to be one.""  Cops have it rough in those situations because it is scary. You do stupid stuff when you aren't constantly trained on situations like this and have to make a snap judgement. In those cases it's easy to see why they get ""paid leave"" after something like that.   Other times they just overstep their boundaries and try to cover it up to save face for the community. We had cops raid the wrong house, not announce themselves, and kill someone who was legally defending their home (and, as he were a former marine who was using the training he had, didn't even have his finger on the trigger because neither side had identified the threat). The cops tried to play it off as an honest mistake, but they lit him up. One guy. Because they did not pay attention to most of their training and raided the wrong house (I believe they were across the street AND a few doors down), they did not announce their presence as they are required to do in this scenario, and they did not identify their target (which is not only a danger in killing the wrong person, but killing innocent bystanders outside the home since they were not thinking about what was behind the threat. Luckily other houses just had holes in them and I don't remember anyone else getting hurt, but in AZ they would have been liable for any other lives they took when shooting him something like 15+ times).    TL;DR: It doesn't matter what the worst case scenario is. There are laws for citizens and law enforcement alike that they can not break, and it's a constitutional law that they are not allowed to search or seize (or enter) your property without due cause, which includes official word from people other than the officers involved because we like to try and use checks and balances in our government to make sure people don't abuse their power (which still doesn't end up working for us)."
HadToHurt,369lrv,NoSpicyFood,1 point,Mon May 18 07:45:18 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, where did you see that the guy was refusing to say where he was from? He just refused to open his windows.   Maybe you haven't watched the full video? here  That's the question he was asking, he never asked to search the car or anything else until the guy started rights-shielding.  I don't know, from the outside it just seems it's a guy acting like a douche by not answering a simple question (or questions, i can't really tell if he is asked anything else at the start of the video) a law enforcement officer asks to check for criminals. I don't see anything malicious in having an checkpoints, given the violence and drug issues in the US I can totally understand how this would at least deter crime at any percentage.  What I see in this, and every other ""bad cop"" video out there in relation to how cops act in your country is an extreme distrust amongst everybody. Your cops seem (and reasonably so) scared about a civilian having a concealed weapon, so they act like everyone has one and could use it to harm them. I do not blame them for this attitude, because this is how the civilians react to the armed cops. In the video you can kind of see a second officer approaching the vehicle from the back, hand in the weapon holster, holding what seems to be a taser. That's what I'm talking about."
HadToHurt,369lrv,drkztan,1 point,Sun May 24 18:33:51 2015 UTC,"He was refusing to state his citizenship, that's different than where you are from. Similar question, but importantly different.  But, you are correct, I was wrong because I forgot the question at hand because any reasonable person realizes he is a US citizen. That's not really what this was about however. The truck driver even asks if the agent wants his driver's license. Sure, he could have one from a different country, but the agent refuses to even check it. Both parties are being obtuse to waste time and show their power.  Anyway, just because there are worse scenarios doesn't make this one okay.  You're making straw man arguments that don't really change the bigger issue, and I have made my point. Anyone who wants to keep arguing can do it without me."
HadToHurt,369lrv,NoSpicyFood,1 point,Mon May 25 01:16:03 2015 UTC,"What part of ""Border patrol checkpoint"" seems involuntary?   The checkpoint is within the United States, not on any border. Also, it's only for immigration checks. When the agents asked if he was a citizen and he said he was opting out of their questions, the interaction was legally over.

HadToHurt,358yhv,worksafemonkey,-9,Fri May 8 02:54:20 2015 UTC,I have this idea that MMA isn't actually a sport. It lacks something I can't quite put my finger on. Maybe sportsmanship. Even other violent sports feel like real sports like boxing or Judo. Even kick boxing which is extremely violent still has the feeling of being syndicated and managed.
HadToHurt,358yhv,REBOG,9,Fri May 8 08:44:28 2015 UTC,"You don't even make the effort to explain and basically just piss and moan. And what are the odds:  I've trained judo, boxing and kickboxing and a bit of mma and I can say, that   it's the realest sport out there. Great sportsmanship everywhere I've been, with the usual exceptions as in every sport. The enthusiasm, love and respect is IMO only surpassed by BJJ practitioners.   And your last argument, man, this is the icing on the cake. It is so weird, I'm not gonna even argue with you, cause I've already done that a few times in /r/MMA and it's a bottomless pit.  /ignore"

HadToHurt,359dac,DrDinkleberb,1 point,Fri May 8 22:52:03 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that Kimbo was going to cover him like a defensive back and try to stop him from catching the ball/tackling him normally afterwards. That kind of blindside hit could seriously injure or even kill someone when there's that big of a size difference not to mention without pads.

HadToHurt,357t45,autowikibot,2,Fri May 8 16:50:50 2015 UTC,"Pancrase:       Pancrase is a mixed martial arts promotion company founded in Japan in 1993 by professional wrestlers Masakatsu Funaki and Minoru Suzuki. Pancrase is taken from Pankration, a sport in the ancient Olympic games. Suzuki and Funaki are particularly skilled in the art of catch wrestling and based the promotion on professional wrestling consisting of shoots rather than works. Per its custom, its champions are named King of Pancrase rather than the title of Champion.  The promotion had a rule-set more similar to that of professional wrestling than those used in contemporary fighting organizations such as Shooto. Just as in Japanese professional wrestling, closed-fisted punches to the head were illegal (however, close fisted punches to the body were allowed). Instead, a fighter had to strike to the head with a palm strike, and submission holds had to be broken when a competitor made it to the ropes. Rope breaks resulted in a lost point and a fighter would only be granted between 3 and 5 rope breaks before being disqualified. However, beginning in 1998, it began adopting a rule set more in line with other mixed martial arts organizations, with most fights transitioning to the new ruleset by 2000.  There have been repeated accusations that many Pancrase matches were ""works"", or predetermined. Prominent fighters within the organization such as Bas Rutten and Guy Mezger have adamantly denied these accusations. Mezger is quoted as saying: ""There were not very many works (in Pancrase); maybe 4 or 5 total and most of them were before I was fighting for them. I hate when people say that there was so many works in Pancrase, they truly do not know what they are talking about.""

HadToHurt,34kdq0,NoShftShck16,24,Sat May 2 02:44:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, at lot of places don't teach it because it is easy to go to far and can lead to serious injury. What you do in an arm-bar or kimora (spelling?) or even an Ezekiel choke are using leverage on a sensitive area. The difference is with heel hooks, you are picking in the knee, a rigid joint, and applying force with a shit ton of leverage."
HadToHurt,34kdq0,holycheapshit,-16,Sat May 2 04:50:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit surprised: You know how to spell Ezekiel, but not Kimura? I mean the Kimura? In my experience the Ezekiel choke in a gi is only dangerous from back mount, because you apply pressure on the [vertebral artery] and its nerves(http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Vertebral_artery.png), not primarily the common carotis in the front.  No fade to black, just a strange feeling and sudden lights out. Dangerous, because such a vertabrae choke can cause cardiac arrest way more than a carotis choke."
HadToHurt,34kdq0,NoShftShck16,10,Sat May 2 13:59:57 2015 UTC,I don't have a ton of experience with it. Only did BJJ for about a year. Had all these done to me except heel hook. It was drilled into us to never do it and most of our comps banned it. The ones that didn't our place didn't participate in.  I did get hurt with an overzealous douche doing a back mounted Ezekiel on me. Something happened to my trachea that left me relatively unable to swallow and speak for a few weeks. But there is still far more give to those than the heel hook.
HadToHurt,34kdq0,holycheapshit,-4,Sat May 2 15:26:21 2015 UTC,"I just assumed you did some BJJ, but didn't know Helio's biggest rival. ;] That was all. :] [ Something the downvoters don't seem to get. ]  If someone applies such a choke with brute force in a simple randori, that will just damage you, then those people are the cause. Not the technique, which is not even done right [ As said, vertebral artery. You go to sleep. Just zap.]. I did two years traditional judo, gi and no-gi, and one year submission wrestling. We practiced every single technique, even the banned ones, and not a single one got really badly hurt in those two small groups I was in.  Just my experience and opinion. Competition is a whole new ball park and the bans have a reason."

HadToHurt,34eggs,go_sens,-6,Fri May 1 00:03:35 2015 UTC,"nope.  Passing — it’s usually legal to pass (“overtake”) on the inside (i.e. to the right), as long as it’s safe and in a properly-marked lane (i.e. only do this on multi-lane freeways and highways).   Lane splitting refers to a two-wheeled vehicle moving between roadway lanes of vehicles that are proceeding in the same direction. More narrowly, it refers to overtaking slow or stopped vehicles by traveling between lanes.[1][2] It is also sometimes called lane sharing, whitelining,[3] filtering, or stripe-riding.[  There was no clearly marked lane and no second lane, he was making own his lane on a single lane road and that is illegal and really, really stupid.  Quite often cars move to the right to go around turning cars and don't expect a bike to be there, just like this."
HadToHurt,34eggs,Borngrumpy,0,Fri May 1 02:46:35 2015 UTC,"Western Australia, California, Texas (I think), europe, west Germany...  There is a pretty big list."
HadToHurt,34eggs,dmyerty,-2,Mon May 4 02:38:41 2015 UTC,"Western Australia for example (straight from the WA handbook)  You can overtake a vehicle on the left only when: you are directed to do so by a police officer or other authorised person;  you are on a multi-lane road and it is safe to do so;   a vehicle is indicating/signalling that it is turning right. You can also overtake any vehicles that are stationary behind it.  You can overtake a vehicle on the right when you are both travelling in the same direction and it is safe and legal to do so.  This is a fairly standard situation, unless there is a marked lane (2 lanes in the same direction) you can't overtake on the inside, pretty much anywhere. California Vehicle Code Sections 21750-21759 also prohibits it, same as rule 253 in the UK.  German rules are Passing on the right is prohibited except on multilane roads (including the Autobahn)   The bike was illegally over taking a car who was performing a legal pass on a turning vehicle and the bike got squashed.  Pretty much not a single place you listed allows what the bike did."

HadToHurt,34e2du,Gixer82,2,Thu Apr 30 22:42:56 2015 UTC,"Looks like the pole took the brunt of the energy, and the car kept going which reduced much of the impact. lucky guy."
HadToHurt,34e2du,deadbird17,-2,Thu Apr 30 18:07:14 2015 UTC,Newton's law would disagree with that.
HadToHurt,34e2du,Moncion,1 point,Fri May 1 00:06:58 2015 UTC,"No, it wouldn't.   Not the way he hit it.   The pole broke which took some of the energy, and the car's CG  being offset from the direction that it hit the pole caused it to rotate around the pole since it didn't hit directly, so more energy was dissipated as it came to a stop down the road. This reduced the energy that went into the impact. And this is probably what saved his life."
HadToHurt,34e2du,deadbird17,-2,Fri May 1 01:59:55 2015 UTC,Every force has an equal an opposite reaction. It doesn't matter what angle he hit the pole at. This law still applies.  By the look of the car after the smash I would say you're wrong and it was the cars safety features that saved his life.
HadToHurt,34e2du,Moncion,1 point,Fri May 1 02:10:28 2015 UTC,"Breaking the pole allows it to dissipate some of the energy. That's part of your reaction. So is the heat from friction as the car comes to a stop. it is not solely absorbed by the car in this impact. It didn't behave as it would have if it had hit a non-moving wall. In that case the driver surely would have died. I'm a former accident reconstructionist, and I'm not talking out of my ass."
HadToHurt,34e2du,Archkingz,-1,Fri May 1 02:26:56 2015 UTC,"Still the impact on the pole and the impact on the car was equal.  Let's scale it down.  If a baseball bat hits a ball and the bat breaks, the impact on the bat and the impact on the ball are equal.   If the bat hits the ball on the edge of the bat and the ball goes spinning of behind the bat, the impact on the ball and the bat are equal.  There is no way to avoid this force. It's the same as punching someone in the jaw.  I may break their jaw and not my hand, but that's because their jaw was weaker than my hand.  But they still felt equal force. That my understanding in physics."
HadToHurt,34e2du,MFToes,3,Fri May 1 03:19:31 2015 UTC,"Yes but the force on the bat and the ball is greater if the bat doesn't break, despite it being equal on both."
HadToHurt,34e2du,massacremaster,2,Fri May 1 03:32:25 2015 UTC,"this guy is right. if a bat were to break mid hit, the baseball stops in its tracks, doesn't go nearly as far as it would otherwise."

HadToHurt,33wxny,Zentaurion,6,Sun Apr 26 12:37:18 2015 UTC,"The powerbomb itself doesn't look all that painful, considering that they are well-muscled guys. And from hearing about wwf wrestlers who learn how to take a fall in a manner where they relax those muscles in time to not get hurt bad by the fall. Maybe I'm just desensitised to something like this.  The jabs that come right after. Those look painful."
HadToHurt,33wxny,SgtOsiris,9,Sun Apr 26 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"Arona also hit the back of his head and knocked into Rampage's head while bouncing back. The two clean punches afterwards, not jabs, sure contributed to the degree of his concussion he had later on.  My experience from Judo:   Relaxing is key. [there is another Pride Video with Fedor Emilianenko vs Kevin Randleman and a suplex as a perfect example on this]   You stiffen up, you get hurt. But:  At a certain velocity and power you can stay as much relaxed as you want, you'll overload the brain & central nervous system or knock out the air out of the lungs. Or you can additionally hit the back of the head like Arona did and get knocked out, which can also leave you blind. There is a reason why fighters are not allowed to hit the back of the head.  And nah, I don't think you are desensitized.    EDIT grammar and typo"
HadToHurt,33wxny,Mr_Smartypants,8,Sun Apr 26 16:11:09 2015 UTC,They covered the powerbomb on SportsScience with Rampage and a crash dummy with sensors.

HadToHurt,33ttzh,TheLadderOfSuccess,2,Sat Apr 25 22:52:13 2015 UTC,There are various chemicals to ruin the health and risk life.
HadToHurt,33ttzh,mcdehuevo,1 point,Sun Apr 26 05:53:08 2015 UTC,"Intoxicative inhalant:       Intoxicative inhalants are a broad range of intoxicative drugs whose volatile vapors or gases are taken in via the nose and trachea.  They are taken by room temperature volatilization or from a pressurized container (e.g., nitrous oxide), and do not include drugs that are sniffed after burning or heating. For example, amyl nitrite and toluene are considered inhalants, but tobacco, cannabis, and crack are not, even though the latter are also inhaled (as smoke).    While some inhalant drugs are used for medical purposes, as in the case of nitrous oxide (a dental anxiolytic), this article focuses on inhalant abuse of household and industrial chemicals, in a manner not intended by the manufacturer. These products are used as recreational drugs for their intoxicating effect. Inhaling volatile substances because of their intoxicating effect is called huffing, sniffing, or bagging. According to a 1995 report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the most serious inhalant abuse occurs among children and teens who ""...live on the streets completely without family ties.""  Inhalant users inhale vapor or aerosol propellant gases using plastic bags held over the mouth or by breathing from a solvent-soaked rag or an open container.  The effects of inhalants range from an alcohol-like intoxication and intense euphoria to vivid hallucinations, depending on the substance and the dose. Some inhalant users are injured due to the harmful effects of the solvents or gases or due to other chemicals used in the products that they are inhaling. As with any recreational drug, users can be injured due to dangerous behavior while they are intoxicated, such as driving under the influence. In some cases, users have died from hypoxia (lack of oxygen), pneumonia, cardiac failure or arrest,  or aspiration of vomit. Brain damage is typically seen with chronic long-term use as opposed to short-term exposure.     Image i - Common household products such as nail polish contain solvents that can be concentrated and inhaled, in a manner not intended by the manufacturer, to produce intoxication. Misuse of products in this fashion can be harmful or fatal.     Interesting: Toluene | Leave Home   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

But they are brave enough to control their fear and remain calm and in control, despite their heart rates going through the roof. Obviously the right horses have to be picked by the Police in the first place.  Next time you see the horses in riots ect, they are the brave ones."

She's also  loosing and pushing against it. And the force then fully applies onto the elbow, while her opponent doesn't have to do that much. Imagine how a submission arm lock like the americana works, but much more extreme (with a streched out arm). In that position you know, that you fucked up a long time ago."
HadToHurt,33qhu7,RainWindowCoffee,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:39:45 2015 UTC,"The americana will destroy the rotator cuff. It's deceptive in that it looks like all the force is applied to the elbow, but the double 90 degree arm position (forearm to humerus and humerus to body) and the ""figure 4"" arm position of the applier transfers a huge amount of torque to the relatively tiny muscles of the rotator cuff."

Now her definition of bushes and mine is a bit different, my first cut was 15' off the ground with a chain saw after climbing the Bush. Long story short it was a sucky fell. Side of the house, privacy fence and chain link fence all pretty close, so we skinnied them up so they would fit and tied a rope but about 2/3 way up.   Now I'm on the ground with boss running the saw and just about the time it's time for me to start pulling I look at how long my rope is, and how tall the tree is above my tie off point, and I do it again. Man they sure were close, too late now. Start running back wards with the rope tied to me(never tied another one after this). I hit the end of the rope and fall down on my butt, the 3"" top of the tree fell right about knee level between my legs. Screw that crap. Lowest paying, highest risk job ever."

HadToHurt,33bg7e,Sy27,5,Tue Apr 21 07:31:02 2015 UTC,"Ok, so, non-surfer here. Just being curious: how do you not die from being slammed by a wave like that?"
HadToHurt,33bg7e,leducdeguise,11,Wed Apr 22 09:53:44 2015 UTC,SOMETHING I CAN ANSWER YASSSSSSS!!! Well the biggest wave I have ever surfed was about 20ft and it's not nearly as violent as you think I mean you do definitely go through the washing machine but most breaks are relatively deep this is probably a good 20-30 ft here so it's not like you're actually hitting anything. Now the act of not dying from lack of oxygen is another thing. The people who surf these waves train every day for just this more people die from drowning than getting thrashed violently.  My favorite thing to say to new surfers is you're not learning to surf you're learning to fall.
HadToHurt,33bg7e,surfer_ryan,3,Wed Apr 22 17:02:44 2015 UTC,"well, thank you for your answer! pretty clear now. I never thought about drowning, but it makes sense. This kind of wave must keep you under for quite some time"
HadToHurt,33bg7e,leducdeguise,2,Wed Apr 22 17:23:17 2015 UTC,"If you go ""over the falls"" on a wave like this you swim down, not up into the wave. In a shallow break that thing will just roll you along the bottom. You also need to be aware the next wave is when coming up, a lot of inexperienced beach goers and surfers get dumped by multiple waves."

HadToHurt,3308ah,jumped-up-pantry-boy,3,Sat Apr 18 15:17:02 2015 UTC,So when a team is on offense they have wide recievers that go out for passes (like emmanuel here). Typically the opposite team assigns one guy (called a corner back or defensive back) to cover each reciever on a given play. The safety lines up farthest back of anyone on defense and his job is to watch the play develop and make a call where he needs to help his team. Sanders burns the cornerback on the far side going deep so the safety slides to that side to help. Then he kills him with that hit. Hope that helps a little.

Too many people are running around the field and I can never seem to see who has the dang ball.    Thanks for the effort!  I have always assumed that since lots of football players are not going into medicine or engineering that you don't have to be real smart to play, but I guess I never learned in time before my learning box was full.

But ya football players (and coaches calling the plays) are constantly reading / adjusting / using what they see to apply to the next play.  If you enjoy watching, definitely never too late to pick it up. Like anything theres smaller details people can see.. (Maybe your bf sees a corner back grabbing/holding a recievers jersey as he's trying to get open yells ""pass interference!"") but really the basics are easy. Offense either runs or passes the ball (sometimes they even fake a handoff for a run and try to surprise the defense with a pass) and the defense tries to stop em. Pretty basic!"

HadToHurt,32vjhz,akutabi,3,Fri Apr 17 17:51:09 2015 UTC,That would be blatantly obvious upon him entering the ring...
HadToHurt,32vjhz,Slithy-Toves,28,Fri May 8 16:42:00 2015 UTC,"He knocked him retarded.  ""Wait, where am I again?"""
HadToHurt,32vjhz,EnderVViggen,20,Fri Apr 17 04:19:25 2015 UTC,got up like http://imgur.com/gallery/BO7rmKK
HadToHurt,32vjhz,Deathmuffins,10,Fri Apr 17 12:05:14 2015 UTC,"It looks like he went to kick right as the guy punched him, he had no back footing and took the entire punch as a result."
HadToHurt,32vjhz,themilkyone,3,Fri Apr 17 15:51:29 2015 UTC,the big dude actually feinted down like he was going for the abs then laid the overhead. Wonder why we don't see this tactic more often.

HadToHurt,32vjhz,fzzkgr,7,Fri Apr 17 02:18:48 2015 UTC,That can't be very healthy for the brain...
HadToHurt,32vjhz,Roflolmfao,0,Fri Apr 17 10:15:26 2015 UTC,A man's gotta eat.
HadToHurt,32vjhz,Toof,-7,Fri Apr 17 15:23:43 2015 UTC,WTF was white boy doing??
HadToHurt,32vjhz,DubZer0,6,Fri Apr 17 02:15:20 2015 UTC,"You're being downvoted by some, but if you look at their size comparison, I don't think the white guy is in the same weight class at all, so I sorta agree"
HadToHurt,32vjhz,ojonegro,-2,Fri Apr 17 09:05:15 2015 UTC,Well...Momma did say knock him out...
HadToHurt,32vjhz,quitnever,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:22:25 2015 UTC,Event thought it's not a Tyson quote I read this in Mike Tyson's voice
HadToHurt,32vvzw,Reddit__PI,8,Fri Apr 17 03:36:12 2015 UTC,His face looked like a Simpsons character for a moment.
HadToHurt,32vvzw,app1esauce,3,Fri Apr 17 17:37:39 2015 UTC,His face definitely got punched off for a sec there.
HadToHurt,32vvzw,AllDayzed,3,Fri Apr 17 16:26:52 2015 UTC,Man if there was ever a poster moment for keep your fucking guard up that's it. What the hell was he doing with his right way down there anyway
