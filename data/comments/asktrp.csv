Ban on any story which might induce some 2nd phase bitching. Ban on any feels over realz relationship posts too which might induce Disney syndrome, oneitis etc.  Download StayFocusd for Windows, or WasteNoTime and SelfControl for Mac if you have them. Yes these are site blockers, I know your type I am one myself. Be frugal with how much time you allow yourself. Apply StayFocusd Nuclear Option at 11pm, every night. Self Control and Nuclear Option are perfectly red pill app options because once you go Nuclear they won't listen to your inner omega chimp cry for access until time has ran out. If you have Android, FocusON is a great site-blocker. Afraid I can't help you with an iPhone or brick, but it's Apple man, they're going to have something. Get to bed midnight latest. Rise by 8pm latest.  Cold showers as recommended.  You don't have to lift every day but you get outside and get a fucking walk every fucking day. In the sunlight. Every 3 days you are under something heavy and sweating or running somewhere cold but exciting and sweating, no questions. Lifting and HIIT are your best friends for aesthetics and the Alpha mindset. You should know all of this being here, but I'll repeat it for you. If you don't eat protein, GTFO. Limit sugar and carbs if possible. Carbs are for pre and post-workout or bulks, otherwise you'll have an energy crash and get fat. If you can afford it and are cutting, go palaeo. Protein shakes esp.  lean whey are your friend.  Fruit and veggies always. EFAs and monos such as peanut butter, olive oil; these keep your brain functioning alpha, and your ticker working nicely. Fish at least once a week, ideally twice for the omega-3s to reduce anxiety and depression. Yoghurt is your daily dessert, everything else is cheat day. Minimal cheat days, and meditate while having your cheat meal (srs)  every cheat meal/day, your SMV decreases slightly, so choose wisely and enjoy the experience.  Regular meditation, morning before school/work and evening before bed.  Visualisation and self-mastery exercises (letmegooglethatforyou.jpg)  Do not allow yourself extensive amounts of time lying on your bed doing FA. If you have work to do at home, do it downstairs. Before bed, make a list of your goals/tasks for tomorrow. Do not let this leave your sight. If you fail to check off everything on it, observe what you did that day that stopped you from doing it. Change your behaviour next time, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results. Again for Android, GoalTracker and Memorix are good apps. But handwritten is better.

asktrp,3e3lw0,areyouacyborg,7,Tue Jul 21 20:58:30 2015 UTC,"Just did my yearly monk, I was going to actually do a submission, but I think its more helpful here,and I don't want to flood trp with something which I feel is still not acceptable quality. I feel you should monk.   Summary: Monk mode over, do this every year for 1 month. Here's how I improved and why you should do it yearly if you're already red.   Take into account the following; I'm in cohabitation with an ltr of almost 6 years.   I'm dissociative.   I own a business, at a young age.   I've been lifting for years.   My business requires social media.   It may be hard to do this if you're not in compete control of your schedule.   Body:  First the goals.   I just spent my thirty day monk mode without any Internet except business. My close friend u/laughkisskill apparently had a blast with you guys on my phone, and learned a lot. He probably won't be on often anymore, he's doing fine as is.  Over this last month I read through (and copy edited) the RP handbook, the laws of power, nmmng, wisnifg, and of course, the book of pook, one of my favorite bedtime stories for the adult male. I had set the following goals for myself on a day to day basis.   1) gain more muscle. I started June 15th at 187, 17%, ended today,  the 15th of july, at 200, 18% I'm not that interested in cutting because I already look good. Though more definition may happen by accident in the future.   2) relax on the work addiction. I run a business with some old friends and we've been through an accelerator program this summer, I have serious issues trusting others so I normally do 65 to 80 hours a week. This had to stop. I had to learn to trust my partners again.   3) approach every day. Not for sex. Not to dread my girl. Just to take a hard look at a serious problem that popped up a year or two ago. ""coming across far too intense"". I learned how to relax myself to not look at everything as opportunity cost.  4) digest the lessons I've learned and put them into a series of articles. Currently there are 8. I spent a good thirty minutes a day taking some of the best RP lessons I've lived through, and will be posting them, hopefully someone will learn something, then again they may be absolute shit and I'll learn to give up on giving any type of advice. (each of these lessons was personally requested at some point by a user from trp, or asktrp)   Second, the how:  1) I switched from sl5x5 to ppl, upped protein and total calories per day to 150g and 2800 respectively. If i didn't lift ppl, I swam or did cardio. I also quit smoking using the ""quit smoking now"" app on Google Play store. Feel great.   2) I noticed working hard has gotten me far, but overworking had turned me into a very acerbic aggressive guy. Beyond what's aggressive attractive. This actually worked for me most of the time but for the recent two years it's actually scaring people away. I decided that going out 4 nights a week and giving away my cell to the aforementioned friend (so I couldn't keep working) was the best method to distance myself from my obsession. (btw my business is literally my lifetime hobby, I just get to make bank on it, if it helps explain my happiness being a workhorse)   3) Approaching every day helped me, I was more of an mgtow in mentality. The only reason I'm with my girl right now is because she's a truly rp woman. I do care about her immensely, love her. We live largely seperate lives, though together physically. In order to address the  intensity issue, let me give you an example. We're hiring like crazy, and I've scared more applicants away who've said (I don't want to fail him) than we've gained. It has become an issue. As a rule I decided I must insert one harmless joke into every interaction. Every day. It's helped boatloads. I also made a point of going to comedy clubs for my outings, and started building a set. As my girl says (you've just become so much more relatable, you're not a machine anymore.) because I admit, I eat, sleep, breathe, talk, and even play like a terminator.   4) I wrote every day. Each day. I already write about 200pgs a week,  edit about 300, so taking a break from work I moved to 14 pages, 2 a day in a journal attempting to address the topics requested as best I could. My writing hasn't improved I don't think, but maybe I can give back to the community, from whom I have taken so much.   Summary: 30 days dedicated to 4 simple areas of improvement helps massively. At least for me, hopefully for you. Don't take on too many tasks, just be focused. Your yearly monk also reminds your social circle how much they need you. (nice added benefit) or teaches you how much you aren't of value. (if they're not looking for you)."

asktrp,3e3lw0,Metalaggeddon,2,Tue Jul 21 21:04:12 2015 UTC,"There's some excellent advice here already, but let me add my two cents.  Become addicted to self improvement. Most peoples issues with willpower and discipline stem from being addicted or enjoying negative behaviors that give them instant gratification. You need to learn to become addicted to things that take more time to attain that gratification.   Someone already mentioned taking cold showers, take two every day, one when you get up and the other before you go to bed. It might feel shit at first, but believe me at the end of the week you'll feel great. Same applies for lifting. Same applies for building a business."

asktrp,3e3lw0,RPthrowaway123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:32:41 2015 UTC,"Discipline and willpower issues in modern boys primarily stem from instant gratification.  Instant gratification is a result of many things that happen to the boy over the course of years.  Individually, each variable that contributes to this is negligible, which is why such issues go unnoticed until it is far too late.  So here's the thing:  You need to unplug from the modern world.  You need to put down your video games and internet and tv and movies.  The modern world has gotten to the point where no one ever has to work for their answers.  They no longer have to struggle to find what they are looking for, because the mass media spews their garbage answers all day every day.  So why is this a problem?  Because instant gratification makes you a lazy entitled fuck.  It makes you a person who can't stand to wait even a little bit, even though you know waiting is going to yield better results.  It makes you a person who can't sit down to work through a problem.  Did you know there is are articles floating around everywhere saying that 97% of boys are misdiagnosed with ADD and ADHD?  There is a direct correlation between instant gratification and the symptoms exhibited in ADD/ADHD.  And we all know the key symptoms of ADD/ADHD are lack of focus, lack of willpower, and lack of discipline."

However, more often than not, I get the, ""Well, you're acting different. Let me know when the old Kiwi comes back.""   This is common. All of these women are used to the beta version of you, and in you're pursuit to prove something to them or yourself, you'll revert right back.

""I would drive you home, but it reminds me of that time I did that with my gf"". etc. Add in some prodding in the side of the ribs, a falsetto and even some 'talking' hand flapping gestures to accentuate the peculiarity, depending on how comfortable you are with her.

asktrp,3e332q,Zaorish9,2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:52 2015 UTC,"So, there's a theory about male homosexuality that would also explain women doing this. Basically, a woman's epigenetics might be trying to kill off male relatives:  DNA is famously half and half from mother and father, but a baby gets some extra stuff from the mother only (mitochondrial DNA, and epigenetic things that influence gene activation in the nuclear DNA).   This extra stuff only gets passed on through the female line, so from its PoV, male children are dead ends. So it has evolved to influence a woman to favor her daughters over sons, and female relatives over males more generally. It probably contributes to males' higher infant mortality rates, and to male homosexuality (grandchildren through a son might divert resources from grandchildren through a daughter). It might also contribute to mothers abusing or giving bad advice to their sons.   This theory is compatible with psych explanations like 'well they just don't know how to give good advice' and 'ALL women SAY they want betas, this is not mother-specific'. These epigenetic factors could be part of why women evolved to give shitty advice to men (whether deliberately or b/c they really just don't know better)."

Put all of your time and effort into building and fostering these three traits. Working hard isn't enough to have success in your career. You need to work hard in a specific direction. Take a career aptitude test and find a high-paying job that suits your natural talents. Once you've picked a path, start working towards the end game, one step at a time, making sure to avoid any life-crippling decisions. Life-crippling decisions include taking on tons of debt, getting someone pregnant, committing a crime, or getting addicted to drugs or alcohol.  Hobbies and spare time interests should be positive or have net value associated with them. Don't use Netflix as a hobby, use the gym. Don't play video games, play an instrument. Commit your work ethic to building your own value, not wasting your time."

I'm not a RP God by no means, from what you're saying it would serve you best to not care in the least what she thinks or wants. She has already shown you that she is not relationship material from the simple fact of being insecure about your height. If you want to fuck her then let her suggest, initiate, or whatever first. You know that you had plates before, that means you can have them again.  I don't know exactly why she stuck out to you more than the other girls you were with, but you need to slowly realize she is no longer worth that to you.

Trust me, if you cut it off completely, there will be times when you regret leaving some good bangs on the table.  Your problem is that you've caught a mean case of oneitis and your ego can't get over her not wanting you for an LTR. So she's using you, get over it. This is what relationships are.

But she's also smiling, is turned towards to, etc... you're in. Go for it. Escalate. If you get 2-3 different IOIs together, you're golden. When you start seeing a lot, you're good.

On average,  I notice a lot of IOI in my direction because it's usually not subtle.   Days I miss the gym for a long period of time, I notice a lot less women quick glancing in my direction and notice my plates are less overall aroused just to be in my presence.   When I stick to my routine, almost all women I pass smile, quick glance, or best of all, hold longer eye contact (best indication of sexual interest from strangers period).  Short term, that's how I gauge my SMV. If you're not noticing any IOI signs or they aren't clear, your SMV is lower than you think. Go lift."

In every goodbye hugged me and then looked into my eyes. Countless other cute flirtatious instances that inwardly make me want to punch myself in the nuts for never taking the chance.   Counter example. Another girl smiled, responded very warmly to my approach,  conversation and advances. Eye contact,  hugging and flirting. Green for go. Made a move on her at a party while dancing,  she rejects me infront of people we know,  and I have to see her for the rest of the night.

In my opinion, unless she has kids, you're going to need to hang out with her more than once a week - unless you're okay with her getting another dude.   Now I sleep at her place as much as four days a week.   I try to never stay at a girl's place. That's just not the dynamic I want to have. I invite them to my place, and they stay the night. They come into my world where I'm in control and they stay there at my pleasure.  I've tried doing it your way, where I limit them to once a week, and go to their place instead of mine, and it never worked out for me as well as having them come over. Let me ask you this: how do you get her to dress up for you? ""Hey baby, how about you wear that thing tonight?"" - compare that with what you'll say when they come to your place: ""Want to come over tomorrow night? Okay, pack some lingerie.""   I do serve as a BB sometimes. When we go out, I insist on paying 100%   Same here. It's not a big deal to me either. Chumps are guys who pay for dinner without getting sex. When I'm fucking a girl, the floodgates of my generosity are open. I don't have a problem with that at all.  The thing I wont do though, is buy them shit that doesn't relate to me. I had a girl ask me to help pay for car repairs. I was like, ""lol, no."" Of course, I have done repairs and stuff myself, and fixed stuff in girls' houses.   What began solely sexual turned into more. Despite my initial resistance I did meet her friends and hang out with them a few times.   Yeah. Now you two are dating. You really have to avoid her friends.   She met a group of my friends once.   In my opinion, this is less of a problem with guy friends, because your guy friends are (if they're smart) trying run the same game. I try to avoid girl friends though.  The best option is to hang out with acquaintances. Meetup.com is really great. You can meet some people really casually, and never hang out with them otherwise. And you can anyone along without it being weird.   She talks about her dreams and aspirations in life. We love to make out and cuddle.   Nothing wrong with that, dude. You wont keep a girl for long if you don't offer up some comfort. It's just tough to do that with more than one girl at a time without lying or causing hurt feelings.   I keep my cool and distance until she realizes that having some of my time and affection but no commitment is better than nothing.   The way I usually explain this - and this is my answer to your question about ""where are we going"" - is like this: ""when I'm with you, you have my complete and undivided attention. I treat you really well and I make you happy when we're together. I will never lie to you - and part of that honesty is, I don't offer you more than I'm willing to give. If you're the kind of person who can live in the moment and enjoy being with me instead of focusing on the time you're not with me, then we're compatible on those terms. I think it's kind of a good deal, and I think that we've both been pretty happy. But if you need more than what I can give you, then I'm not going to lead you on or lie or promise more than what I am comfortable giving. If you really need more, then I'm going to respect that and support you in finding a relationship that gives you what you want. I wont be happy about it, but I care for you enough to honestly want you find what you're looking for.""  I've given this speech to a lot of women, and I mean every word of it. I let them go try to find someone better than me, if that's what they want. And you know what, a lot of them come back to me in between every guy they date. They date a guy. He annoys them in some way. They break it off. I'll get a text out of the blue saying they miss me. We'll spend a week or so fucking. They'll say, ""thanks, bye"" and go off to date again.  It's pretty great actually."
asktrp,3e2p8d,CuntyMcFagNuts69,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your insightful response.   I think the younger trp folk here are a bit black and white in their thinking. Its either full deep beta bucks onetis or full asshole alpha that treats women like they are subhuman. Life is always in the grays. Having a solid, consistent plate is great and if I can make it last longer than shorter than why not. I'm not afraid of losing her. I rather not.   I try to never stay at a girl's place. That's just not the dynamic I want to have. I invite them to my place, and they stay the night. They come into my world where I'm in control and they stay there at my pleasure.   I'm hearing different opinions on that. Some say that by bringing them to your house you are exposing yourself to potential crazy and trouble. Like that crazy lock changing bitch post a few days ago. It will also prevent them showing up unannounced (while you may host a different plate). It will also prevent them from leaving a bunch of shit in your place, causing potential drama with new plates and etc. I remember reading a very good plate management post from an old timer here a few months ago and his number one rule was to never host in his place. I'll try the other way as well. She lives pretty close to me so I don't mind the driving.   When I'm fucking a girl, the floodgates of my generosity are open.    Love how you phrased it. My sentiment exactly.   Yeah. Now you two are dating. You really have to avoid her friends.   Care to elaborate more on this point? I never present her to anyone as my girlfriend and neither does she. I enjoy meeting new groups of people, because as you grow older expending your social circle is becoming increasingly harder.   Nothing wrong with that, dude. You wont keep a girl for long if you don't offer up some comfort. It's just tough to do that with more than one girl at a time without lying or causing hurt feelings.   To be frank, I do it as much for myself as I do it for her. Sure a good savage fucking is excellent and the main dish at all times. But cuddling and sleeping embracing each other is a very delicious experience by itself. Dat Oxytocin rush sure is nice.   ""when I'm with you, you have my complete and undivided attention. I treat you really well and I make you happy when we're together. I will never lie to you - and part of that honesty is, I don't offer you more than I'm willing to give. If you're the kind of person who can live in the moment and enjoy being with me instead of focusing on the time you're not with me, then we're compatible on those terms.

I wont be happy about it, but I care for you enough to honestly want you find what you're looking for.""   Love it. Very respectful, loving yet firm and clear. Sure I can lie and give her false commitment but the drama, lying and hiding is not worth it. Being tastefully open about your non-exlusivity activates instant and perpetual dread for one and is also ego flattering in the sense you knowing she is sharing you with other women yet lusts you so much that she is fine with that arrangement.   They date a guy. He annoys them in some way. They break it off. I'll get a text out of the blue saying they miss me. We'll spend a week or so fucking. They'll say, ""thanks, bye"" and go off to date again. It's pretty great actually   Yeah no kidding, that's awesome. I hope to have a bunch of broken plates in the future where we end things on a positive note where they keep reaching out for a few weeks of strings free fooling around."
asktrp,3e2p8d,martin-ho,3,Tue Jul 21 17:05:00 2015 UTC,"younger trp folk here are a bit black and white in their thinking.   Yes, but in their defense, it's usually better to be a bit of an asshole and then just dial that back as needed, than to be a nice, safe pushover that gets no sex at all.   Some say that by bringing them to your house you are exposing yourself to potential crazy and trouble.   I'm fairly risk averse (these days, I've been dumb in the past). I drop a girl at the slightest hint of a red flag. So if there's a girl that I would worry about bringing back to my house, I wouldn't want to go to her house either. If there's a girl that I'm thinking, ""she's crazy, but she's down to fuck"" I just go ahead and pass - maybe pass her on to a buddy if I'm out with one. I'd rather do that than to hook up with someone that will cause me problems.   Like that crazy lock changing bitch post a few days ago.   That guy actually let her move in though, right? I actually don't have much room to talk. I've been dumb enough to let three single moms and their kids live with me. But now, I have really learned my lesson and will never let a girl move in no matter what.   showing up unannounced   Yeah, I hate that. But I find that it's best to let it happen once, and then just ask that she not do it again. And break things off if she does. The worst for me was when I was living in a condo and a girl talked the door man into letting her up. That one legitimately pissed me off.  After you first meet a girl, you spend a few weekends in a row with her (like, a honeymoon period). Then one weekend you have to tell her you have other plans. It's almost guaranteed that she's going to check up on you. Also, the first time you get sick, you can expect an unannounced visit under the guise of bringing you soup or some shit. A girl's friend once told me (long after we stopped dating) that the two of them had staked out my apartment for hours one night to see if I would come home with another girl.  Women assume you're a player and you're lying to them. I actually sympathize. It's a reality they deal with. That's why it's best to be honest. You're not the first guy they've been with who was fucking other women - but you might be the first to be totally upfront about it.   a bunch of shit in your place, causing potential drama with new plates   Right so, I don't feel the need to hide anything, because I'm not doing anything wrong. However, I don't go rubbing a girl's face in it, right? So what I do is take all their hair products and shit like that, and I put it in a duffle bag. I do that even when I only have one girl. I've never needed more than two bags (and right now I need zero - lol).  ""Hey babe, where's my shampoo?"" - oh, I put it in this bag when I was cleaning up.  Problem solved - although clothes are a little more complicated. If one girl sees another girl's bra, she gets a lot more upset than if she finds panties ...for some strange reason. I use different drawers, and I haven't really had a problem with anyone snooping.  They also get weirded out about sex toys. I just go ahead and bite the bullet and buy a brand new vibrator every time I meet a girl (drugstore.com thinks I'm some kind of freak). I leave it sealed up in the box and usually bust out the toys on the second or third time we're going to fuck.  I toss it to her and tell her to open it up. I find that's a really nonchalant way of communicating the idea that this device hasn't been in anyone else's pussy.   Care to elaborate more on this point?   I think that if she's bringing you around her friends, she's communicating to them that things are serious. Have you ever had a female friend show up for a party or something and say, ""this is Dave, a guy I'm fucking but who refuses to commit to me""  Here again, I don't always practice what I preach. And sometimes I get ambushed too (I didn't know other people would be there). But I think the best thing to do is to avoid her friends when possible.   Very respectful, loving yet firm and clear.   Thanks. That's exactly what I was going for.  I also go ahead and bring up very early on that I'm not looking for anything serious. Without exception, women say that's fine - then later they'll start crying and ask why you don't love them. It's good to be able to point out that you've been saying the same thing all along, and that it's been the truth all along.  After things reach the ""where are we going with this?"" phase and you clarify that there'll be no more commitment, expect them to go out and fuck another guy. C'est la vie!"

asktrp,3e2p8d,JackGoldsteinWrites,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:35 2015 UTC,"I'd say tell her that she can't ""have"" you. ""I like to have you around but I don't want to raise false hopes – you can't have me, I won't enter a relationship with you"".  Since you said you don't have a thing for this girl then you shouldn't care what the outcome will be. If she says she only wants a relationship but you don't, then dump her. If she says fine she'll continue to be your plate, fine. You shouldn't care."
asktrp,3e2p8d,flying_cumshot,2,Tue Jul 21 14:55:12 2015 UTC,"Look in my submitted post history for lessons learned about spinning multiple long-term plates on a scale of years.   This one DOES sound like a good long-term partner, but you have to get the roles and places sorted in your own mind first, before you can get her buy-in on staying with you yet without exclusivity.  Your main plate/main GF is in this position because she's worth some extra effort.   Learn to titrate the amount of LTR behaviors and favors she desires just enough to make sure she remains nominally satisfied, yet without them becoming entrenched expectations.    This also entails cultivating your subordinate plates to recognize their position as secondary to your main, this helps prevent blowups wrecking your little harem.    It IS possible to have the fruits of an LTR AND the variety of spinning plates all at once.  Not easy, but possible, and there are trade-offs for all parties.  The end result is like living several love lives concurrently."

So the next time (if there will be which I doubt it) she says something like this, then challenge her to some sort of fun physical competition.

I've actually pulled women like this seeking ""study partners"".  And not just students. Professors approach me outside of class, often just for casual conversation. One hooked me up with my summer internship. Another encouraged me to run for student government association executive board.

This is the time when you embrace her, show her some caring masculinity and assure her all will be well.   This will happen often if you err too much on the alpha side.

She was going to come over when she was done working. As it got later she said she might not come over. I was fine with it, it didn't matter to me. I start getting tired and I told her that I was going to bed. It somehow turns into me not being there for her when she's stressed, I don't want to see her, etc. Just stupid bullshit.

Did you clearly state that you had to go to bed earlier for some important reason?  Communication is key here.  She seems to be emotionally invested in you, sort of like a LTR.  If you chose to ignore her cry for help and chose to go to bed instead, yes it will come off as asshole-ish to her, but not in a good way.  See, your decisions like choosing to sleep early will need to have a reason, and it could be anything.  But she will prioritize your time for her unless you prioritize your own time.  It isn't the fact that you chose to go to sleep, but that you value your sleep over her stress issues.

It would be questionable under most TRP standards if you were to go out and do scripted PUA stuff non stop just to get laid, because you'd only get sex in exchange, nothing more, nothing less."
asktrp,3e30nj,UnluckyPenguin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:18:31 2015 UTC,"I remember reading about this in TRP. It represents a scarcity mentality, because you will ""never have enough"" or ""never be happy until you reach X number of women"".  As men, women naturally have a role in our lives, but they should NEVER be the one and only thing that can make us happy. Live the life you want to live. You must have hobbies other than hooking up with women.  Besides TRP is a lifestyle, not only to be applied to women, but work life, social life, travelling, exercise, etc.  Have you ever turned down sex from a hot woman? You probably need to shift your priorities to focus on yourself. Then the women will really start flocking to you. Have an abundance mentality so you can pick up women while doing whatever you like to do.  Basically at the end of the day, if you are doing what other people/women want you to do, then you've taken time away from yourself that could have spent doing what you want to do. And you can't take back what you've taken away."

asktrp,3e36s2,Xanderab,2,Tue Jul 21 17:25:01 2015 UTC,"The idea that you have to force someone to do something you want by fear is one of the bigger ideas taught by TRP in my opinion. It runs contrary to the Disney True Love(tm) in which both characters look good/are attractive to each other and stay that way (for reasons not given as it is not important to the love story). Growing up with these stories over and over again you subconsciously learn that ""looks don't matter"" or that ""she will stay attractive throughout the story"", which doesn't happen most of the time in real life without pressure of competition (dread game) or being raised with traditional values/red pill parents/etc.  But real life is contrary to this idea. The only way to keep anyone in competing shape (in business, relationships, etc) is to make them fear they will be dropped for the competition (dread game). It is the fear of abandonment that drives the girl to keep up her appearance (her competition in the SMP).   Does this ring a bell? Yes, capitalism is the correct answer. Free markets driven by free agents and healthy competition (fear of losing customers drives innovation and lower prices). And this is the base thought behind the Marketplace model of sexual interaction.  Edit: *Dread game only works if you are high SMV or higher relative SMV than your partner"

Thatd just bandaid the issue at hand.   understand monk mode and ll that but I have been on that since february and while I've made crazy progress..I still havent gotten laid..I used to get more girls when I was BB. LOTS more.   The quality of girl and quality of sex will be much higher once you've mastered frame and SMV maintenance. You have to be both objective and patient."

asktrp,3dzo5v,redforemanpill,7,Mon Jul 20 20:51:47 2015 UTC,"Dating starts when you're 22-24. Before that, nobody knows enough to do anything seriously. Too much gossip, too much networking, things change way too quickly. People go to parties, people hookup. People go out with friend groups.  Handling rejection well is key. You can't get anywhere if you're afraid of rejection. Girls are afraid of rejection. That's why they never ask boys out. Girls are 100x more scared of rejection than you are. And if you are scared of rejection, you're still being a girl. Be a man.  It's just rejection. It's one event. It's not someone saying ""I don't like you and I never will and my friends never will"",; it's ""I don't feel like it RIGHT NOW (but you can change my mind...)"".  Make innuendos. Be sexually suggestive. Be a little daring. You get nowhere if you don't make your intentions known."

So what you do with the Friedrich Maneuver is, you go up to the hottest most ""popular"" or intimidating bitch in the school.  The one you KNOW is gonna tell EVERYONE about it.    So you go up to this bitch and ask her out.  If people don't go on ""dates"" anymore, that's fine.  Ask her anyway.  LOL.  Point being, you're SHOWING INTEREST.  And don't be a bitch either.  Don't be afraid to be suggestive, in moderation.  You want to come across as daring, not as a boor.  So what she will do is tell EVERYONE that you asked her out.  That you are ""in love"" with her, that you want to touch her boobies, whatever.  Being that a bitch like this is always passive aggressive, she's used to luring simps in and then passive aggressively gossiping them into submission.  So you'll likely have people pointing at you and smirking.  BE COOL.  Don't be intimidated and DON'T. BACK. DOWN.  If you back down, this will prove that you are a bitch.  Like all the others, it will confirm that you only got all sweet and idealistic on her, because she has power over you.  ALSO: You are now in a position where you CANNOT SAY ANYTHING BAD about this girl.  This will make you look like a bitch, because OBVIOUSLY you had interest, since you asked her out.  To denounce her now is to come across as crying sour grapes.  You said you liked her, so stand by that.  It will also show that you have balls, because this ENTIRE SOCIAL GROUP will be attempting to shame you.  You just grin and be like YEAH SHE HAS A FINE ASS.  Don't compliment her on the content of her character or idealize her on a pedestal, when confronted with your supposedly embarrassing misdeed, just be like YEAH THAT ASS IS TIGHT.  Make it sexual.  You're interested in her, but on YOUR terms.    You don't even have to end up going out with her or being friends with her or whatever.  The point is, you have now shown that you have an enormous pair of testes.  These girls will be chattering about you for YEARS.    They'll probably be curious about what makes you so mysteriously confident.  Know what I'm saying?

Is he bossing people around who are beneath you in the actual written hierarchy?   Is he bossing people around who are above him in the actual written hierarchy?   Can he do this without bossing you around or intruding on your perceived personal power?   Do you (or he) lead from experiential legitimacy, or written bureaucratic legitimacy? (or both)   Is him taking the lead going to cause issues for your taking the lead?

We have many people that are new, and we also have some that know what they are doing but don't give a fuck about taking charge or who is taking charge. I believe so.

Overall based on what you've said id suggest having that drink with him and, if he's really that respectful of you, engaging him with your directives. Be honest and simply say that it's cool to boss others around but i'll keep bossing you all around. See how he reacts. Presume that your defacto leadership position isn't threatened to begin with. If he's weak enough he'll simply cave, and people will see the hierarchy form.   You can enforce this by actually being better than him. If there's a better suggestion or method to improve work flow, just tell the people doing it, you can tell him later (though do tell him afterwards).   If he's going to be heavily competitive, embrace it. Be friendly, make it a game  but set rules. Let him know, ""yeah man that's awesome, I don't mind some competition"". Your ground rules should definitely include never arguing in front of the inferior, ""it can only harm you both"" and never overriding each other without evidence of a better method. Even then it should be prefaced with discussion if time allows. Keep in mind this second option does you the favor of pushing you to up YOUR game as well! However you should only offer it if he doesn't cave to the first option.   Good luck op. Stick to whatever you choose, nothing is weaker than making your bed and bitching about the covers later.  Edit, some rules for that conversation with him. If you've internalized the laws of power, ignore this.   1) don't offend the master (if he does prove to be better than you)   2) don't apologize.   3) don't display your whole hand.   4) don't play hard ball, ""Keep it light""  until he attempts to step it up.   5) If he does want to play hardball, know you must crush him completely.

I just realise that whoever it is that is confronting me probably has a shitty life, has been abused in the past or has just had something terrible happen to them.

You're going to be alright mate, trust me."
asktrp,3e0zux,AlphaAsFAQ,3,Tue Jul 21 06:28:02 2015 UTC,"You pretty much described my early 20s. I've failed badly in college, got kicked out. My parents threatened to disown me. It messed me up psychologically, but I had a glimmering thought that I wasn't all that dumb and useless, so I slowly worked on myself.  I went back to the same degree, focused on the actual learning, and not the grades. I was doing fairly average, if not poorly. I didn't know if I was doing the right thing. I felt like quitting a gazillion times. I was completely stressed out, unhappy, directionless, but despite that I somehow had an insane belief in myself - this inner confidence in my abilities. I somehow knew that I must keep going despite anything that happens. I religiously studied self-help books trying to fix my messed up brain, trying to figure out the ""objective"" answer to questions (""Am I doing the right thing?""). My life was like an endless bleak wave of uncertainly and torture. Worst of all, I saw my classmates out having a normal life, socializing, getting good grades, passing courses, living a good life, being in relationships, whatever. I had none of that. I couldn't dream of it.  You know, the most demoralizing part was that I somehow just knew that I don't deserve to be  loved by anyone (I have no success, so I am a failure, and failures don't deserve love). I simply rejected the idea of me being any good. That thought made me clench my teeth in painful agony while I felt like gnawing my own eyes out. Quite often, the fantasies of me being crushed by a bus would bring such an intense wave of relief and pleasure that I'd forget to breathe. I felt like I had nothing to look forward to in life. I lost, game over. Given time, however, I managed to completely rebuild the foundation of my personality where the only person who decides how I am doing in life is me - not my parents, not my grades, not women. Nobody but me. I struggled to create my own vision of things, my own standards, what I call ""objective reality"". (if TRP is for relationships, OR is for life in general).  Come graduation time, I had a tiny chunk of my life figured out, I felt more stable and maybe even a little bit... happy? I do an interview for a Fortune 500 company for a bet with a classmate of mine. He bet me there was no way someone like me with such poor grades, no work ethic, no ambitions (all unlike him, of course), could ever land a good job, let alone one in a respected company. I had nothing to lose since I've already been to the absolute rock bottom, so I went for a round of interviews. All the extra studying, all the self-help books - they created a monster (I mean, that's how I feel) who was a perfect fit for a high profile, well compensated position. Everything just clicked. Somehow I knew every trick; I saw my interviewers like an open book. It was so simple it made me laugh.  You know, the funniest thing was how everyone around me was telling me how wrong I was about everything, messing it all up, being an all-around failure, and yet once they saw my value in the real world the tables flipped. Suddenly, everyone wanted to know the secret to my success. I felt like fish in the water while they were like blind kittens threading cautiously through tall dangerous grass.  Two years passed since then, and only NOW I am slowly realizing that I might be finally standing on solid ground. Only now do I understand how valuable it was for my self-growth to hit that rock bottom, to be rejected and deemed hopeless by people who I thought would stand by me no matter what. After having to defeat my inner demons, knowing what I went through gave me insane confidence from within that I could accomplish anything I could wish for.    As for your situation, OP, I feel like you are on the right track. You are working on yourself, and even if you might not have a specific goal right now, at least you know the general direction you should be heading in. Which is quite a lot, believe me!  I can't comment on what degree to take, or what to do with your life, but know this: when you aim to become the kind of person who will always have a job, will be a perfect candidate for your dream job (you don't even have to know what it is!), there is a chance you will get just that if you work for it.  As for the stress, you have a lot on your plate right now, especially with all the uncertainty with college. I think there is only two types of cure here: 1) experience in the real world; 2) understanding yourself, figuring out the real root of your stress and finding a way to turn your fears into positive. For example:   a lot of my coworkers are very stressed because they aren't sure if they will have a job tomorrow (some changes happening in the company). As for me? I am not worried at all. In fact, I'd welcome it. Why? Because it is a change. I get a kick in the ass to move, to find a better opportunity, perhaps start my own business. The thought of losing a job does not worry me, in fact it makes it something I secretly desire. Why the hell would I stress about it? a friend of mine ended up in a situation where he hates his job to the point when he cannot sleep. He lost 20 pounds in a month simply from worrying too much about not liking his new job. He was ready to quit at a moments notice, which meant he would have to return relocation money, signing bonus, and have to go back to his home country. Which freaked him out even more. So I sat him down and explained that he is looking at it all wrong. Look, if he hates his job, that's fine, but quitting is the dumbest thing he could possibly do. What is the alternative? Simply to be bad at the job so he gets fired. Why? Then he'd get to keep all the money :). And knowing that he doesn't have to work hard anymore, he could instead focus on doing things at his own slow pace the way he thinks is right ;). This different look on things ended his worries in an instant. He went from being depressed for 3 months to being the happiest man alive. And you know what? He is still there, but instead of slacking off and waiting to get fired he is becoming the top performer on his team. Once the stress was gone, he had a new look on the situation where he realized things weren't all that bad."

If for whatever reason you must have a facebook, here are my personal opinions -   Don't post statuses unless it's extremely meaningful - if you move, get a new job, stuff like that. Don't post anything about religious beliefs, politics, what you think about other people. You never know what people will be offended by. Don't allow tagged photos/statuses to show up on your profile. I personally think it's stupid to have a cover photo at all. Just leave it blank Be careful about what you like and comment on. Only like/comment on things like your friends graduating, getting married etc. Oh and liking that photo of your hot friend isn't going to make her want to sleep with you. Don't have captions on your profile pictures. Only spend time on facebook to see what your new friends are all about. Mindlessly going on there every day is a complete waste of time"

I don't think you want to be that guy getting tagged as a Lego set with some obscure caption that only you understand.    Oh and liking that photo of your hot friend isn't going to make her want to sleep with you.    I have a personal policy about not liking or commenting on anything women post on Facebook unless it is something I'd imagine them including in their life story one day (e.g. family member died, got engaged, finished grad school). Long story short I am never one the 217 people who like the picture of her before she goes to the club. I have this whole ridiculous theory that ultimately women will start putting out more if I can attract a huge amount of men to this cause."
asktrp,3e0vq1,A_Medical_Physicist,2,Tue Jul 21 17:30:48 2015 UTC,"In today's world social media is becoming more pervasive and potentially more necessary.  If you are going to use it, use it wisely.  In a way, you can take some tips from women and from guys that are successful on Tinder.  IE only post pictures that show you in the best possible way.  Keep them few and far between.  If you are going to do status updates make them ones that accentuate your SMV.  They should be calculated to inspire tingles by showing that you travel broadly to fun exciting locations, think deeply, and live well."
asktrp,3e0vq1,Rygoth100,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:56:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize RP preaches no social media. That seems ridiculous.  That reminds me of advice I've heard before about how texting a girl shows cowardice, and that you're better off calling her to display confidence. Also ridiculous.  Times change and it's important to adapt. While I agree Facebook is becoming less and less relevant as the years go by, I still think it's important to have at least a minimal amount of social media presence. If you're under 35, being totally off the grid isn't normal and it may even seem creepy  The TRUTH of the matter is it's NOT easy to maintain a social media account as an adult male that receives a sufficient amount of likes/comments without compromising your SMV or authenticity. This is why most men give up.  For me personally, I use Instagram and Facebook. There used to be all sorts of things I thought were worth sharing when I was younger, but that time has passed. Now I just post a pic on Instagram about every 2 weeks, which i share over on Facebook every other 2 weeks. I take my time with posts and only post the coolest pictures I've taken. It's a wonderful ego boost to receive several comments and several dozen likes, and it keeps me loosely connected to a network of people that were, at one point in time, very important to me.  Most importantly as far as trp is concerned, I think it's the simplest way to display social proof and has allowed me to stay connected to female friends of my past that I was able to move forward with later on. I suppose there's easier ways to pick up chicks, but it's especially nice to get a second shot with a girl from your past."
asktrp,3e0vq1,Ezreal3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:25:44 2015 UTC,I think texting a new girl is infinitely better than calling her at first.

There's a lot of PUA advice from a long time ago that puts emphasis on calling women over texting them so you will seem more confident and sexy.   But the reality is, phone calls are a nuisance, especially ones from a stranger. They interrupt your day and demand your attention.  If you're under 35 it's all about the text game."

asktrp,3e0vq1,RidleySmith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:43:47 2015 UTC,"Facebook is essentially two things: 1) Self-Marketing.  This is where you limit your content, but only things that portray you in a good light toward your audience.  Who is your audience?  Whoever is on your friend list.  Don't let anything show up as public unless absolutely necessary, and don't post to it on a regular basis.  For example, I've got a few lists, including: relatives, old friends/acquaintances, and current friends.  You can set up groups and post things to each of those as needed.  That way my mom, grandparents, etc. can see the pictures of my kids (Facebook is actually awesome for showing that kind of stuff to your family) but exclude those sorts of things from everyone else that doesn't care. 2) Seeing other people's stuff.  This is the bigger time waster.  Don't spend too much time browsing through other people's stuff and responding to their posts.  For me, I just occasionally click like on something positive that someone posts if I happen to see it, or wish a happy birthday to an old friend I haven't seen in person for years.  Don't get involved with drama, and don't act like you have no life.  Even if you are seeing something, don't post a comment or click ""like"" unless it means something (e.g. if your cousin posts a picture where they graduated college against all odds, it's nice to make a positive post congratulating them.)  The other part of this is where you use Facebook for events, messaging, or being parts of groups.  My neighborhood has a Facebook page that is like our own local version of Craigslist, without all the weirdness.  It works great.  In terms of setting up your own profile, I'd just have a generic profile picture (because it's public) and maybe post some nice photos occasionally of you so your family can see that you're happy and healthy.  Don't really add anything other than that to it unless you have a specific use (e.g. my example above of the community FB page.)  Definitely don't ""like"" businesses or other pages, unless it's a business owned by a close friend or relative that you'd like to support.  The rest is all data mining crap and you don't want that."

Just make sure when you choose the furthest, it's clear to her it's because you want to.  If you don't, she will suspect you're not being real.  When she thinks you're not being real, more arguments and shit tests follow.  Why did she ask this way?  Women are indirect.  Stating what she really wants puts her in the position of being the bad guy.  If you had chose the side she didn't want, she never has to be the bad guy.

asktrp,3dycas,ScottRikkard,2,Mon Jul 20 19:57:12 2015 UTC,"""he still sees the old dynamic""  I just visited a friend in another state that I've known since the first grade this weekend.  I can sum up the entire experience with that statement.  We both grew up the smart, nerdy type.  That was me until college, when I really started exploring myself and all that my body was capable of.  This friend of mine did not do the same.  Although he has a good engineering job now and is still a brainiac, he's still a skinny nerd with under-developed social skills.  I'm talking eye contact, tone of voice, posture.  Basic things that I made sure to learn as I grew and am still growing into a man, which he skipped, consciously or unconsciously.  I'm going to stop comparing though and get to my point.  Somewhere in his mind, as well as your friend's mind, whether that be the drugs or whatever the fuck else, these people decided in some area of their life to stop growing.  It seems like they stagnated, and are still stagnant in their mind, and in more ways than one, it fucking hurts to be around them.  It hurts because of the bonds we shared in the past, which can be appreciated and counted as blessings, developed some kind of care for these friends on a very human level.  But it fucking pains me to be around someone who is holding on very tightly to this past without seeing change and growth and positive motion forward.  It hurts to be around someone who you care about, who consciously or unconsciously holds you back and brings you down.  Point is, that type of pain and suffering is not worth it in the end.  The pain from lifting a weight and having a sore muscle the next day is worth it.  It's growing.  The pain from being treated negatively hurts the next day.  But this pain hinders growth.  It's best to cut ties, no matter how close in the past the bond was.   edit: actually, after re-reading this, I'm going to amend the attitude I wrote with: It doesn't have to hurt.  I can choose how to interpret it.  Negative energy does not have to be absorbed, accepted, or reciprocated."

Sexual skill is trivial. If you're really attracted to a woman, and your testosterone levels are nice and high, you're going be able to get off easily.   You're not attracted to her. She might be not as physically attractive as you want, leading to persistent feelings of dissatisfaction. She might have an attitude or behaviour problem.   Or you might have some unscratched sexual itch or fetish that you haven't expressed with her, and that you might not even know about yourself.   Or she might just be not attractive to you, even though she is attractive. (I can't be having with tall women, for example. If she's over 5'6, she doesn't look female to me at all.)   Once you figure out what's bothering you, you need to figure out if it can be fixed, or if you need to move on. It sounds like you are reluctant to break up with her because she is well-behaved, and breaking it off feels like an undeserved punishment. While this shows that you have developed a healthy attitude of ""I am the prize"", which will serve you well, staying with a girl you're not into does her no favours.

asktrp,3dyi83,mikeyostro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:02 2015 UTC,"The point of TRP is to be the best man you can be.  There's many posts about having a long term relationship.  The general rule of thumb here, however, is that YOU should control the relationship, and not let it compromise your life goals and ambitions.  The story is very common of a dude with great ambitions that eventually gives up on his lofty goals because his relationship gets in the way.  Don't let the pussy have power over you, and generally you may find that the juice is simply not worth the squeeze"

I just want one person to be attached to rather than have no depth in my interactions with women. I Probably sound emotional AF, but I hope you can understand where I'm coming from.

asktrp,3dyi83,throw_em_all,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:44:57 2015 UTC,I totally get it. I think LTR is a fine path to follow if that's what you really want. You must always choose what's right for you.    For me I wanted to be better stronger and less needy. I wanted to become a better man so that when I wanted to try a LTR again I would handle shit tests and have the strength to walk away. I've made lots of mistakes and I'm learning a lot.   Remember the girl has to earn your commitment. Most girls (95%) will give you sex before commitment if they are really attracted to you. They love working hard to earn your exclusivity.

Work on your game around male friends and colleagues.  A true alpha never gets shut down like this, at worst people just tell him they disagree.

I in no way validated his point of view.   I approached him from the perspective of men are logical creatures and a logical argument if he would not at least agree to that he should at least understand the point of view...  It did not work that way at all and he started hamstering like all the good little feminists trained him to.    Now could I have handled the interaction differently? yes, you're right i absolutely could have and this is a learning expereince.

And yeah I guess seeking validation is still something I haven't gotten rid of completely. Those few rejection took my state of mind to a worse place than I'd like.

asktrp,3dyv4s,NidStyles,3,Mon Jul 20 18:26:03 2015 UTC,"We call it 'outcome independence'. To reach that state you have to just work on your inner game. The problem is, you're horny and you can't control your urges. I had the same problem too, and it made me do stupid things when I was afflicted by it.  You'll have to figure out what can get your mind off of it. Even though you think your results are good enough, they are clearly not good enough to attract other women. You'll have to figure out why. If you were even decent looking enough, ugly girls would still approach you or get near you somehow. I remember when I was on my way down to normal weight that even handfuls of ugly girls would try to approach me. If that's not even happening, there's something I am not reading from this.  For me, the solution was to work out and lose weight towards the goal of getting girls. After time, it became simply about working out to improve my strength and endurance, as well as my physique. The problem is that you are still doing things for external rewards. You have to get to a point where it's about you. I know it sounds cheesy, but there's no other real way to describe it. A lot of it boils down to will power."

""Tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil.""   I think some of Marcus' tenants from this same section are pretty fantastic:  ""Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been.  We all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.  It can only ruin your life only if it ruins your character. Otherwise it cannot harm you—inside or out.  The tranquility that comes when you stop caring what they say. Or think, or do. Only what you do.  It’s silly to try to escape other peoples’ faults. They are inescapable. Just try to escape your own.  Leave other peoples’ mistakes where they lie.""  To me these tenants speaks to the core of what it means to be a man and that it hasn't changed."

I tell myself that I'm just going to dabble a little, do one set with lower weight and be lazy at the gym.  Maybe just go walk on the treadmill for awhile.  I tell myself whatever I have to to make myself go.  Once I get there and get warmed up I get inspired and bring it!  So tell yourself whatever you need to so that you crack your book open.

If you do it just right you won't actually need to say much at all.   Oh you went to University, what made you decide on that major?  How did you get that job, do you enjoy it?   After 20 minutes of this, you can push the envelope, get her to admit something a little embarrassing, follow up with something relevant.   Keep the conversation organic, don't ever force it into any direction you think it should go.

She's already rejected him for dinner, she's not going to come out for drinks... unless she is the one to initiate it. She already knows the guy's intentions and the problem that OP is having is that this girl doesn't want to continue being his plate because either (1) she wants more commitment [highly unlikely given that she didn't push for it] or (2) she doesn't want to have sex with him any more.  OP should simply say, ""Okay"", and go radio silent on her. There is no magic statement or magic bullet that will turn her around."
asktrp,3dxd1l,Invalidity,2,Mon Jul 20 15:57:58 2015 UTC,Thank you. Someone gets it.   Now someone please send these guys a link to that Sperg article on the TRP frontpage.
asktrp,3dxd1l,RealGucciSosa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:50 2015 UTC,"This is my last reply on this... first of all, drinks is different than dinner, and secondly, a week's silence after ""Ok"" is enough to pique her curiosity and who knows, her emotions may change. Girls are fickle.  Going completely radio silent is shooting yourself in the foot if you actually want to bang her again before she leaves."
asktrp,3dxd1l,drrtyfrrnr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:53:52 2015 UTC,dinner and drinks are SO not the same thing.
asktrp,3dxd1l,SeekingTheWay,2,Mon Jul 20 14:37:26 2015 UTC,"Don't say a damn thing.  If you want her to keep spinning, she needs to learn to spin herself.  If you try to force it, you'll decrease your chances.  Enjoy the fact that it was your turn for a bit and pick up another one."
asktrp,3dxd1l,sodainthewatercup6,3,Mon Jul 20 12:26:21 2015 UTC,"""no worries. hit me up if you want to have fun""  ...and then never contact her again."
asktrp,3dxd1l,secret_barber,2,Mon Jul 20 12:51:19 2015 UTC,"""if you don't want us to see each other, we can keep the lights off. but then you will DEFINITELY end up in a bad position. so, thursday?"""
asktrp,3dxd1l,SeekingTheWay,2,Mon Jul 20 14:38:53 2015 UTC,"I think you should next her, but if you don't want to, go with either:  1-  A variation of what /u/drrtyfrrnr suggested: ""Ok"" followed up by ""drinks?"" in a week.  or  2-  ""Seriously, you have to try my fettuccine Alfredo [or whatever].  It's to die for.""  That said, I wouldn't put too much effort into this one.  If she wants to be that way there are plenty of other girls on land, as it were."
asktrp,3dxd1l,VasiliyZaitzev,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:55:55 2015 UTC,No contact is the surest move here. You fucked her and you won. You doubly won because you've filtered out an uninterested woman.  (she's probably chosen a different cock)
asktrp,3dxd1l,FrameWalker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:27:57 2015 UTC,"Zero contact.  Do not say ANYTHING for at least three days.  Preferably a week.   After the zero contact, ignore her messages.  Explain NOTHING.  Make no promises; rationalize NOTHING.  Then go with a single word or sentence.  I like:  ""Drinks 7PM at <location>?""  or   ""I'm going to <location> and it's going to be fun.  You should come.""  Then NOTHING else.  Be sure to have a plan B.  Have something cool to do if she doesn't show."
asktrp,3dxd1l,fnordsnord,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:20:57 2015 UTC,You shouldn't have to try and convince her. Neglect of her will have it's own convincing nature. Just do you.

asktrp,3du74y,ckp2906,4,Sun Jul 19 14:59:57 2015 UTC,Thanks!
asktrp,3du74y,zyk0s,15,Sun Jul 19 15:16:56 2015 UTC,"My views on marriage slightly differ with some TRP philosophies on marriage, only because I truly believe that the techniques and strategies learned through a TRP mindset can help you maximize your happiness no matter what your relationship status is.   Then they don't differ. TRP says ""don't get married, spin plates"" because it's the simplest form of a very practical advice. Getting married exposes you to the risk of a divorce and its financial fallout, while spinning plates is the fastest way to gain abundance mentality and thus improve your game.  However, TRP is not a prescription for a lifestyle, but a mindset. That mindset is ""Be a Man"", which mechanically means live your life in a way that you can derive male pride from your actions, which in turn will boost your confidence and further facilitate the activities that make up your lifestyle. That man can be a player, but he can also be a husband and father.  If you think, TRP is just about spinning plates, you need to read more material. The tried and true advice, once again, is to read the sidebar, and lurk. Your curiosity will lead you to the answers you seek."
asktrp,3du74y,dear_glob_why,3,Sun Jul 19 18:47:15 2015 UTC,So many folks need to read your comment.
asktrp,3du74y,Johnny10toes,2,Mon Jul 20 04:37:21 2015 UTC,The married guys have to dig deep in TRP to find usable advice. It's all here though.
asktrp,3du74y,SexistFlyingPig,13,Mon Jul 20 08:10:58 2015 UTC,"Go to /r/marriedredpill.    Good news for you: They'll tell you how to keep a happy marriage.  They'll also tell you when to cut and run, but really they'll tell you how to keep a happy marriage.  It's often not easy."
asktrp,3du74y,trphardmode,5,Sun Jul 19 15:21:13 2015 UTC,"""Don't get married"" is just advice similar to ""don't ride a motorcycle."" TRP just acknowledges that marriage is more likely to ruin your life than most extreme sports. It is something that is statistically just a bad idea due to risk - but if it makes you happy, do what you can to mitigate the risks and make it work (and be ready to pick up the pieces when it doesn't)."
