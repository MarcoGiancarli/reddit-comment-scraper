premed,3e58ou,LocalDiscNTFS,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:20:26 2015 UTC,Dang already? Congrats. Only thing keeping me from submitting that secondary is their essay question. I have no idea which prompt to choose and it's one of those questions you likely won't reuse.
premed,3e409e,toasty_turban,5,Tue Jul 21 19:57:32 2015 UTC,89th percentile bottom of my range.. really had my hopes up but now it's just meh considering the schools I'm looking at. Hope it's competitive for something
premed,3e409e,stegasaurusr3x,3,Tue Jul 21 22:17:19 2015 UTC,"510, Basically a 31 on the old scale by percentile."
premed,3e409e,tdawg7669,2,Wed Jul 22 00:26:17 2015 UTC,thats about a 33. Use percentiles on these links: https://www.aamc.org/students/download/85332/data/combined08.pdf https://www.aamc.org/students/download/434504/data/percentilenewmcat.pdf

premed,3e409e,satellitepharm,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:30:48 2015 UTC,I used my percentile and compared it to what the score for that percentile would've been on the old test using this chart https://www.aamc.org/students/download/361080/data/combined13.pdf.pdf Hope that helps!
premed,3e409e,sydneysigns,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:09:48 2015 UTC,"It depends on how the schools will look at it.  If schools plan on separating applicants into pools (ie those who took old MCAT, those who took new one, and those who took both) then there's really no point in converting it to the old score as not even the percentiles will translate. (Psych/Soc was not on the old exam in anyway shape or form and the old exam took almost half the time to complete). (Note: this is what AAMC advised)  In this case, certainly schools might look at scores in the same percentiles as old exam as competitive, but you won't be competing for seats with those who took the old mcat.   Alternatively, if schools do decide to compare takers of old and new exams, then I would imagine the most objective and fair way to do this would be to take out the psych/soc and then convert your scores in the rest of the sections to the old scale. This still is not a completely fair comparison as there is still a significant variation in the length of the two exams, but it would be much fairer than considering someone who did not have to take soc/psych more competitive than someone whose overall score tanked because of that section. Both scores are on a 15 point scale, so a 1 would be a 118 and a 15 would be a 132.   This is speculation of course because as far as I know no school has disclosed how they will look at new scores, particularly in comparison to old ones."
premed,3e409e,trollwarIord,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:44:57 2015 UTC,"I kind of wonder if they won't be comparing at all since the tests are so different, but instead will be giving points to the different scores based on their subtest and total percentiles. Rather than comparing student A with an old score to student B with a new score directly, they will give both students A and B a certain number of points, which will be on the same scale but calculated differently based on the score."
premed,3e409e,thebirddoctor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:04 2015 UTC,"Too complicated. From what I've heard adcoms don't think that hard or spend that much time on each student. They move quickly, couple minutes if not under a minute pre interview."
premed,3e409e,PresBill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:58:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be that complicated. From what I've heard (from the horse's mouth), they assign points to students for the various sections of the application to compare them.   It would not be hard to convert the MCAT scale into a points scale at all.   edit: for grammar"
premed,3e409e,thebirddoctor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:00:01 2015 UTC,Hey same here! As far as converting I've been doing the same thing as /u/smileybuckeye and comparing my percentile with the old scores.
premed,3e409e,cocky-cock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:06:28 2015 UTC,I'm actually okay with them comparing percentiles for the time being I think. Anything else would be unfair to either old or new MCAT test takers

She can apply if she enrolls in the appropriate number of non-science courses and completes them by whatever deadline each school sets - usually June/July the year of matriculation.  Here's a chart that gives an overview of requirements. Be wary of citizenship requirements if she's an international student! Good luck :) http://www.ouac.on.ca/docs/omsas/rc_omsas_e.pdf"

premed,3e4quv,DaveyBaby27,8,Tue Jul 21 23:09:02 2015 UTC,"Clinical experience, whether it's EMT, scribing, volunteering, etc. It really depends on what the weaknesses of your application are. It's different for everybody"
premed,3e4quv,jdawg1223,3,Tue Jul 21 23:31:47 2015 UTC,"Well then what is the third most important component of an application? Obviously GPA and MCAT are the top 2, what's third? Volunteering? Clinical experience? Shadowing? Publications? Research experiences? Letters of Recommendation? Something else I haven't even mentioned?"
premed,3e4quv,Always_positive_guy,4,Tue Jul 21 23:34:59 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, ability to communicate effectively. Even if you have the scores and all the ECs, you're not going to get an interview if you can't talk about your experiences well in your application and secondaries, and you're not going to actually get an acceptance if you can't adequately convey both your humanity and your passion for learning medicine.  But if you want the ""by the book"" answer that only covers stuff you can do, I'd say clinical experience (volunteering vs. work does not matter)."
premed,3e4quv,Celdurant,3,Wed Jul 22 00:04:47 2015 UTC,"Indeed, being able to talk about your experiences is important, but that is contingent on the applicant having experiences to actually talk about.  More than 58% of members of our admissions committee says that a complete or significant lack of volunteer/service experiences is a ""deal breaker"" for them when considering extending an interview to an applicant, although when asked what the number one EC was, shadowing/clinical experience was overwhelming chosen as the most important (assuming competitive MCAT/GPA)."
premed,3e4quv,Always_positive_guy,2,Wed Jul 22 00:13:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, absolutely. The fact of the matter is to be competitive you need to be a ""whole package"" to some extent. Even when we talk about people getting in with crappy ECs or low GPAs they're usually working/volunteering a fair amount and have above a 3.0 GPA (which isn't high, but in the grand scheme of things isn't crazy low). Any one deficiency in your resume can definitely be a deal breaker."
premed,3e4quv,DragleicPhoenix,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:32:59 2015 UTC,"What is clinical volunteering? I apologize if I sound ignorant, but I thought the most you could do as a volunteer was wheel patients."
premed,3e4quv,jdawg1223,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:44:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. You're not going to be taking blood samples or interacting with patients on a medical level much when you're volunteering. Too much liability and regulations preventing thag sort of thing.  What I do at the hospital is work on a cart that brings stuff to patients (DVD players, movies, books, magazines, puzzles, etc.) Besides that, wheeling patients around, delivering flowers and letters, and general clerical work, there's not much else you can do as a volunteer."
premed,3e4quv,DragleicPhoenix,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:57:13 2015 UTC,"Uhh, so why would it matter then? It doesn't seem ""clinical"" at all. I did 150 hrs of that stuff back in high school, haha."
premed,3e4quv,jdawg1223,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:12:01 2015 UTC,You still have to get a position where you at least interact with patients. I spend 90% of my time talking and helping patients with various things when I'm volunteering.  And the stuff you did before you got to college doesn't count for med schools
premed,3e4quv,lolpremedbruh,3,Wed Jul 22 04:38:17 2015 UTC,Get some clinical experience. PROVE you want to be in medicine.
premed,3e4quv,NightsToo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:59:34 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend didn't get into medical school the first time she applied. That year she retook MCAT and improved her score and worked in a local ER. She is also an EMT and continued doing that. She reapplied later that year and ultimately got her top choice. I think having ANY clinical experience is better than worrying about how much clinical experience is necessary, nonetheless it will bolster your application."
premed,3e2rps,Crsrange,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:32 2015 UTC,"Could also be a good job to ""springboard"" you into a Medical Assistant job or something like that - some workplaces are willing to pay for your training if they have a relationship with you and know you're good. I'm not sure if this applies to the workplace you have in mind, but hey."
premed,3e2rps,ThaGOutYourWaffle,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:09:42 2015 UTC,I thought that medical assistant courses took 3 semesters (A year) to finish. I think that I'd rather take a 1 semester EMT out of the way (+pass the registry) before I'd use up 3 semesters on medical assistant. Maybe I'm wrong.
premed,3e2rps,ev1hmr,3,Wed Jul 22 03:50:19 2015 UTC,"It's clinical experience because you're somehow involved in caring for the patient. The clerical duties and filing would not clinical activities, but transporting patients absolutely would.   If you're having trouble finding someone to shadow, ask outside hospitals since their liability policies are more strict than most. Check out if there are free clinics in your area, I'm sure they could use some extra help."
premed,3e2rps,r3fernan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:53 2015 UTC,"I've been visiting offices like it's going out of style. The physicians are always too busy to see me personally to ask them. (Front desk people usually can't answer for them and tell me to wait. After waiting in the lobby, they tell me sorry and that they will call me back.) Everyone else is a flat out no-go  I think that I'm going to bring the battle to them through employment."
premed,3e2rps,r3fernan,3,Tue Jul 21 17:57:41 2015 UTC,I'm an emt and a patient transporter. The emt provides more hands on experience but the transport also has benefits. I get one on one time with patients to develop my bedside manner skills. I get to observe physicians in their roles at the hospital. I've even done CPR and bagged patients. It's great experience.  I also went to a seminar from a member of the UCLA adcom member and he was asked about paid vs. volunteer. He said anyone can volunteer but if someone is willing to pay you for your time in a clinical setting that says something more. Good luck!

premed,3e2rps,kazaam412,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:52:27 2015 UTC,"I got my EMT cert during the last quarter of my senior year (2014). Took my mcat that summer. Started working 12 hour shifts that September. After 5 months on BLS my company, rural metro, allowed me to switch over to ALS and work 911. I did that until April 2015 and then I got my transporter job. I'm still an emt but only part time I work 24 hours a month. I just applied so I guess I'm doing 2 gap years"
