She didn't just like doing it, she thought it was everyone's obligation to pull the same weight, regardless of their circumstances or handicaps. Which hardly seems fair to either her or me.   Of course, to her, taking care of herself mostly involve ignoring the reality of her condition, and complaining about how bad she felt after she did something to hurt herself, that she didn't need to do, and could find alternatives for.

This will just tie you up in a life of anger and pettiness that will make you as small and pitiful as she is.  What you need is freedom.  Start now in whatever way you can to detach yourself.

raisedbynarcissists,3e3g5s,ohhollyhell,2,Tue Jul 21 17:57:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for this post. I feel the same way and it's SO nice to know I'm not the only one.    Definitely talk to SO more. It's ok if he has more guests than you at the party. But if your nmom and crew will be difficult or stressful then definitely don't invite them.
raisedbynarcissists,3e3g5s,coffee_goddess,3,Tue Jul 21 18:27:24 2015 UTC,"SO needs to respect you feelings. Compromise (it will be good practice for when you are married) to something in the middle with the understanding that YOU get to invite who you want and just because he is including his family, you are not obligated to include your family. Really, he shouldn't be pushing his beliefs on to you."
raisedbynarcissists,3e3g5s,Katie-Fay,2,Tue Jul 21 18:56:57 2015 UTC,"I'm going through something similar, I recently dis-invited my Nfather from my wedding, which has had some unfortunate consequences including but not limited to having more lines drawn in the sand. I am refusing to go back on my dis-invite, and I am glad that I made it explicit that I don't want him there. It doesn't negate some of the pain, but it is healthier for me. No one else can determine who your family is. You make your family, not take it."
raisedbynarcissists,3e3g5s,Lilyfren,3,Tue Jul 21 19:01:49 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh can I appreciate this. My husband (who has wonderful parents) wanted to invite hundreds of people to our wedding. I literally had 10 people I wanted there. Finally, I called around, got quotes for space, food, and drink for our hundreds+ten guest list, and the sticker shock made him agree that a small wedding was better. :)  We ended up having a backyard wedding for ~50 people, told everyone to sit wherever the hell they wanted (so my side wasn't all empty), and fed everyone and got them drunk for around $1,500. (We had a guy come and roast a pig, which was....interesting, but delicious.) We spent the money we would have spent on his giant acquaintance list on a fabulous honeymoon, and saved some for kegs and pizza at a lakefront bar when we got back from our trip. The party for everyone cost maybe $500 - the bar was open during the night, so we just had pizzas delivered and kegs at the bar for our guests; there was no cost to just invite everyone to come party with us.  In the end, I got the small and intimate wedding I wanted, he got the big raucous party for everyone he's ever met, and we had a $10K adventure in the islands that we will never, ever forget.  Keep working with your fiancee. Tell him the stuff that's really bothering you (for me, it was the prospect of 10 people on my side of the church and 9238768234756230 people on his side....and the prospect of having to get a weekend job to pay for what would have effectively been HIS party). You're not ""stealing"" the day. You're figuring out a compromise that will work for both of you, which is basically what you'll be doing forever after. :)"
raisedbynarcissists,3e3g5s,gettingthekidout,2,Tue Jul 21 19:06:43 2015 UTC,"1) please don't invite anyone to your wedding that won't bring joy to the occasion.  2) you and your SO should have a serious talk and perhaps some premarital counselling to help him grasp the situation with your Nmom- him minimizing your feelings and not being supportive of the relationship you have with your mother can set a dangerous precedent.   It sounds like he was raised in a more healthy family environment and is struggling to comprehend that you weren't. Is he going to try and push you to reconcile because ""she's your MOOOOM!"" or ""Kids need their grandparents!"" or is he going try and force you to have a relationship with his parents that you're not comfortable with because ""FAAAAAMILY"". Even the most loving and well-meaning folks can occasionally be huge assholes about accepting LC/ELC/NC relationships because they project their own upbringing onto the situation."
raisedbynarcissists,3e3g5s,Mustangbex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:35:54 2015 UTC,"We eloped.   It's been five years.  We will never tell my FOO because they have nothing to do with my life.  It's not their business.  We also haven't told my husband's FOO because he has a FLEAsMom who hates me (I'm not a perfect woman for her one and only son).    Really, the point of a wedding is to get the legal benefits of marriage: it's a contract between the two people and the state (and if you are religious your God(s)).  If you have the commitment, the wedding is just a formality.   But from what you describe, it sounds like your SO is in love with the idea of a wedding. That there's this Hallmark moment ideal that he wants.  The problem is that that Hallmark moment isn't possible, especially with Ns.   He needs to get a serious reality check.    What I recommend you do is do a search on this sub for all the stories we've had in the last year or so of NMoms ruining weddings and trying to wreck marriages.  Collect the best, have him read those, and then say ""that's what NMom will do to us if we attempt the big wedding, it's not that I don't want it, it's that with my family it's not possible"".  And just keep explaining it, why it won't work in the normal way.  And at the same time, get him to explain what he really wants from the wedding, what can be done despite your crazy family.  Some things can be done to make the guest list being unbalanced not be noticeable (like an outdoor wedding with the audience in a crescent, no aisle: have the bride and groom walk towards each other from the sides, and have no formal seating chart, even have people sit scattered around: the lack of people on ""your side"" will disappear if you don't have a ""side"").    That's what I would have done, if a wedding had been remotely sensible for us.  Outdoors (preferably at a Ren Faire so we could just go off and play immediately), with everyone standing in a circle."
raisedbynarcissists,3e3g5s,thoughtdancer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:45:55 2015 UTC,"I agree you need to talk to him some more.    How would having your mom at the wedding make it more special for your SO?  Does he understand what she is like? My guess is that he doesn't, and he thinks he is helping to make it more special for you by having your family there.  In reality, you will never be the center of attention if Nmom is invited.    In my opinion, it's a mistake to think, ""I want to have a wedding/reception so I can be the center of attention for a day.""  The bride is the center of attention anyway -- you don't have to focus on it.  Try to think of it this way, ""I want to share the start of my married life with the friends and family who have cared for me, who have helped me get here, and who I will be counting on to support SO and me as a couple.  I want my wedding/reception to be a wonderful happy time for them.""  This will naturally exclude your Nmom, but it's not just that.  Our culture encourages women to practically develop NPD around their weddings, and it's no way to start your marriage.  Even in healthy families weddings are often the source of conflict and bitterness and I just think that's bad for everyone.  After you are done with your small wedding and lovely reception, then maybe you can start working on how to interact with -- or decline to interact with -- your Nmom out of something other than fear.  I'm sure that's part of the reason SO is pushing this, he doesn't want you to make decisions based on fear.  He's not wrong about that.  But taking back your power from Nmom is probably not something you can completely accomplish before the wedding.  It might take years."

I hope that you have had the opportunity to get to know at least some people in his family, and that they are the kind of people who won't judge you. If you don't know any of them well, I can totally understand feeling very anxious about a wedding with you at the center of a bunch of strangers' attention. That being said, there are ways to go about planning a wedding so that its more of an excuse for a party than a pageantry display.   As for Aunts and Uncles - it may be a really big deal to him because in his family big weddings are lots of fun. In certain families, they are loads of fun, and usually everyone ends up looking forward to their ""once in a lifetime"" event."

raisedbynarcissists,3e2km9,sunshinecliffs,9,Tue Jul 21 14:19:43 2015 UTC,"Being engaged and getting married clued me in that something was wrong with my mother. My fiancée and I had to live with her for about six months prior to the wedding. We had moved to her side of the country so I could look for a job in my field (I had just graduated). I knew my mom and I fought a lot before I had moved about when I was 18, but I thought since it had been a long time and I was much older (27), it would be more smooth.   It wasn't. She was jealous of my relationship with my fiancée. Even outsiders asked me why she was acting like she was jealous. She would praise my husband in front of others and tear him down when she was alone with me. She always called me fat but laughed it off and said she was too.  This hurt a lot because the first thing she said to me when I first saw her after moving out was that I got fat even though I had only gained 5 pounds. People in my new state said it was winter fat and smiled at me like I was becoming one of them. She pressured me to lose weight for my wedding when my fiancée said I looked great the way I was. She would blow her gasket at vendors for the wedding. I actually apologized to my seamstress in private for dealing with her. Because my mom kept correcting the seamstress. My mother is not a seamstress herself. Then, she hit me one day while we were making dinner because I put the tin foil on the baking dish incorrectly.  Not only was I baffled that she hit me at all, but it was the same way she used to hit me as a child/teen. I realized she didn't see me as an adult.   Then she didn't come to the wedding. It was out of state for her, but I offered to pay for her flight and put her up. She backed out three days before.  I had no one to walk me and I was too frightened to walk without a stable body next to me. I asked a friend of mine, who is like a mother and a dear friend to me. People at my reception either asked if she was my mom or where my mom was so they could meet her. I told them all my mom didn't come to my wedding.   We moved back to my fiancées home state two weeks after the wedding. I was done with trying to be in her life.  Then I found this subreddit and I red all the information in the sidebar. I realized making your daughter share underwear with you is not normal, among a clusterfuck of other things.   I havent spoken to her in two years now. I am going back to her area later this year on vacation with my husband and our two friends. I'm a be worried she will find out and blow up my phone or try to find us at major attractions.

I knew things weren't great in high school, but, at some level, I just thought that I was being a teenager.  I didn't think my mom even liked me or cared about me until she gave me a letter when I graduated high school.    Flash forward to college and things were relatively drama free because I was single and not challenging her.    Things escalated again once I moved across the country, got in a serious relationship and started putting up boundaries/confronting things that made me uncomfortable.  Therapy and having a partner who was there as an observer, confirming all the things that I felt in my gut but dismissed as ""crazy"" helped.  We'd get into fights, and I realized that she literally couldn't empathize with why I was upset.  I realized that she didn't believe me when I was sick.  That she was more in love with the idea of me and looking like a ""good mom"" than with actually knowing me.

I just turned the music off, which set her off, which set me off.  Afterwards, dazed, I thought, who would do that?

I sort of just figured this was just the way they were, they got into fistfights all the time.   One day my stepdad beat me up when I hadn't started anything with him. He had actually been threatening me (he threatened to sodomize me with a flashlight), and I told him to fuck off and he beat me up to put me in my place. When I told my mom, she told me it was my fault for standing up for myself when he threatened me, and I should have walked away or showed submission somehow. Moments later, she insisted that he hadn't beaten me up at all and I was making everything up. Which is it, mom? Did I bring the beating on myself, or did it even happen? You can't have it both ways. I stopped talking to her and visiting her after that.  There were lots of signs other than that, but this was the straw that broke the camel's back. This incident of getting beaten up by my stepdad wasn't really an isolated incident, it was just yet another time my mom showed a complete disregard for my health and safety. I knew that if I stayed in contact with my parents they might seriously hurt me or worse.   I moved in with my biological father, who I didn't know very well at the time. I realized he was a Narcissist when he started sabotaging my attempts at getting a job, going to school etc. He started sneaking into my room at night and watching me sleep.

In my youth she would rip up my homework, then threaten to lie to my teachers about how I ripped it up, refuse to let me supersize then mock me for being chubby, etc. etc. But as OP asked for the seminal incident, I shall digress no further.  I think the decisive moment of when I realized she was fucking crazy was one night when I must have been around 10 or 11 where I was doing my homework, and she was on edge for some reason, so she refused to let me do it in my room like I used to. I was okay with this, and agreed to do it while she watched. She then decided to leave her coffee on my book, so I decided to move it. I moved it, and a drop slid off the cup; I don't exaggerate when the spill was around the size of a raindrop (come think of it, it would have probably done that regardless of if I moved it or not.).   Problem was, it was actually very fixable. Because this was the kind of paper found in magazines, all it would have taken was a wet tissue to clean it off.   She started screaming at me for ""how insolent I was being"", then sent me up to my room, crying. I thought that, maybe, it might have been my fault, so I went back down to apologize and finish it. She refused and sent me back up, and threatened to tell my teachers about ""my utter refusal to do my homework""; I spent the next hour or so crying and panicking. Then my mother got bored of her game and threw open my door some time past 9 PM, barking ""YOU HAVE ONE HOUR."" and went to bed.

My mother had been all sorts of controlling and abusive before, but i had always assumed it was my fault. So senior year .At the time I was dealing with the drama of college acceptance and choosing where to go for college. At the same time I was also battling a 3 year eating disorder that partially originated from my mother's criticism. That part will become important, I digress.  By the time I had applied and received my acceptance letters essentially I had been accepted to all 9 of my schools. Many of them top 20 universities. But every time I got accepted she would get angry and talk about how I'm working against her. How I'm allowing the devil to make my choices how I didn't apply to her colleges (namely Harvard which I didn't want to apply to or go to because I wanted schools where I'd feel challenged but also happy and not smothered by some ridiculous prestige). I remember she would force me to get on my knees and then she'd start praying for the strength to forgive me and my father making us sound like horrible people.  She would scream at me talking about how I wasn't going to do anything good with my life by majoring in neuroscience and that it was blocking my (but really her) way to becoming a doctor. A profession she had spent her life beating into me by squashing any talk of another profession especially psychology. (I still get shivers of fear remembering that voice mail message. I'm actually still afraid to listen to any voice mail messages.) She told me this was what i was to become until even I thought this was what I wanted to do, just so I could please them and then take my life when I was done. I was chronically depressed.   She used my eating disorder as an excuse to forbid me from prom and then make it seem like that was my desire and that I had obliviously shown no interest in being a real woman and looking like a real person so why should I go dress up like one. Among other things she was her most emotionally and verbally abusive in my last few months at home and I developed massive anxiety episodes and dealt with it through self harm and curling in corners trying to make myself small.   But I realized she was a narcissist when I tried looking up why my mother wasn't proud of my accomplishments/ why she was always angry and hurtful and I found a few websites on the characteristics of narcissistic mothers and my mother fit more than half the criteria. It was the greatest relief to me. Because it meant I wasn't crazy. There was something wrong with her not with me.   And that spear headed my conviction to get therapy in college and I've been getting it for two years. First dismantling the dehumanization she instilled in me. Allowing myself to exist allowing myself to eat and not harming myself as punishment for being human and having faults. Then this year I've been working on dismantling her depersonalization of me, by accepting my sexuality my opinions my freedom to choose what I want to do with my life. Accepting and processing my right to have and feel emotions, to not feel threatened by emotions. To like myself and feel proud of that. To understand that no one is going to beat me again for feeling a certain way or having certain opinions. to take care of myself to forgive myself and to let go of emotionally managing her.

She poopoo-ed it, so he told the other child in that child's parent's presence.  That parent confronted my father who still almost got away w/laughing it off except the backpack/bookbag was in plain view on the front seat of his locked car.  The whole thing was just nuts.  Really, no explanation of what he had even been trying to do, but now the spotlight was on us & then just him, as he continued to be strange.  For example he started calling the other family (who were really just a classmate of my brother- different neighborhood, no afterschool activites in common, seriously no overlap except one of their kids attended the same middle school as my youngest brother where they weren't friends, or even enemies) & telling them to come pick up my brother since he was obviously their child.  & then saying ""just kidding"" & hanging up. Finally they made a complaint, CPS talked to us all, my youngest brother was removed from the home & pretty much never came back (he was a musical prodigy & changed schools within the year to a magnet school w/music education, lived w/his music teacher & his wife up until he went to university several states away).  Anyway, the word Narcissist came up pretty early in our mandatory family therapy sessions & Ndad ticked every box.  I never did find out wtf the point of taking the backpack/bookbag was about.  A year+ ago the tvshow Modern Family had an episode were a parent stole a bike he thought belonged to his son & thought the son wasn't taking care of it properly & it made me wonder.  On the other hand Ndad did something very similar to me a few years before: my girl scout troop did a winter pageant & when he picked me up, he scooped up 2 long straps of decorative sleighbells & told me he was going to use them to decorate for the holidays.  No matter how I begged, he wouldn't leave them so I finally stood up straight, threw my head back & screamed.  No words, just AWWWWWWWWWWWW.  Everyone in the room stopped whatever they were doing & stared, he put the bells down & we left.

It feels really good to truly understand what was going on with my crazy-making Nmom."

Part of it was probably my child testing my limits in a way that only mom had done previously. I also got fed up hearing that ""I should enjoy my daughter now, all kids do when they grow up is hurt/disappoint you."" I went NC with her after she basically accused me of abusing my daughter because of an argument we had about a TV family on TLC(there was no reason for this accusation other than to hurt me, she knows it isn't true). Saw a post from this sub hit the front page a few days later and it sounded just like her. I went to the sidebar, read the resources, and for the first time in my life I realized I was not a spoiled brat who doesn't know how lucky she is or a bad daughter or any of the other things she has said about me over the years. I'm still working through the anger/sadness right now but things are better now that I know my mom was abusive to me and it actually was abuse despite her telling me that I don't know the meaning of the term, and that her abusive nature stems from her own issues and isn't my fault."

I was shocked to discover that the behaviour of all 4 of my parents, my siblings, a grandparent, and many extended relatives was literally textbook narcissistic.   I did a ton of internet research, and then dropped it for a few years. When I found myself pregnant in 2014 I grew less and less tolerant of their collective and individual behaviours, and started researching narcissism again. That's when I found RBN. Reading the stories on here was so therapeutic for me. After my daughter was born I went NC with the lot, and actually joined the forum.   I've since learned about different ""types"" of narcissists, and it just blows me away how the descriptions are exact depictions of my relatives. I wish I'd known this stuff when I was a kid."

Sometimes this is because the parent has invested a great deal in their own idea of themselves as the caretaker, and they are afraid to seek other identities for themselves, as all parents must when our kids grow up.  This is a mistake -- every person should be as independent and self-determining as possible, and a lot is possible.  You have a PhD for heaven's sake.  Maybe it's not good for you to live alone, but you could find an environment that is less depressing and controlling than the one you are in.    What I fear is that, despite your intelligence, you have been brainwashed into believing that their treatment of you is generous and that your options are limited.  Your depression comes from your deeper self telling you none of this is true.  Believe that.  Do you work from home or do you go to some sort of work site?  If you are not physically trapped in the house, then you can start looking into resources online, and work with your employer on allowing you time away to visit whatever doctor, social workers or organizations are available in your area.

Then I read the article and recalled this notion I've had for some time now, which is that there are two major reasons for not wanting do to something that would be good for you when you're raised by narcissists. (It's a bit ""out there"", but bear with me.)  When I say ""something that would be good for you"", this could be a) things that you simply enjoy doing, like riding a motorcycle such as mentioned in the article, or b) things that you may or may not enjoy doing at all times but they'd be good for you in the long run; you know, healthy or useful things, like losing weight or getting done with a taxing academic effort.  So, the first major reason for not doing something that's good for you would be that you believe your N-parents wouldn't approve of it (obviously, here we're assuming that you'd want the approval of your N-parents in the first place). This applies to both categories ""a"" and ""b"".  Now, the kicker here is that should your N-parents actually approve of some activity of category ""b"", you may still not want to do it because it makes them happy -- it'd be beneficial for your N-parents, in the sense that they can have their friends (or co-workers or whatever) know that you're such a successful, well-educated, smart and handsome kid, and you wouldn't want to give them the satisfaction. That would be the second major reason. A sub-conscious ""fuck you, I don't want to be useful to you anymore"" sort of thing. Is there some truth to this or am I just rambling?"

You're a human and you deserve to be loved unconditionally by your family. She's obviously not up to that. Sucks to be her.

Even as a kid, I knew there was no way a child was responsible for the happiness of 5 other people, much less all of those other things.  To accuse a child of such things is pretty much insane, so I started treating my NMom like the crazy person she was and learned to manage our interactions accordingly.    I wasn't even a bad kid--straight A's, never got in trouble, did all the cleaning, cooking, and child care for my younger siblings.  I paid for college myself with zero help from my parents.  I realized the biggest reason why I was a problem to my NMom was because I stood up for myself and I didn't quietly and meekly accept her mistreatment of me.  They want a verbal/sometimes physical punching bag to take out all of their miscontent on and can't fathom us having a problem with allowing that.  I still remember how she'd tell me how great things were and how happy everyone was when I moved out for school.  I'd go home for a visit and witness insane screaming matches and violence that should have resulted in police being called, but apparently that was the mythical ""happy"" that she spoke of?

raisedbynarcissists,3e227r,anon_smith,9,Tue Jul 21 11:37:39 2015 UTC,"Seeing it was called ACE confused me - to me ACE is asexuality!  Like you, it didn't fit me. It focussed on the usual straightforward indicators that people use - being hit, coping with an addict parent, being directly verbally abused.  The kind of thing people people refer to when they don't understand was being RBN is like.  It puts us back in the role of having to explain how your N crying and saying something seemingly loving like  ""I'm so scared what'll happen to you"" is actually massive emotional manipulation and blackmail.  I really believe if you're not RBN, you can never truly understand it."
raisedbynarcissists,3e227r,PhantomFairy,4,Tue Jul 21 12:13:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, weird, just the one question because MOST of my family are enablers, just a few outliers who were the Ns.

raisedbynarcissists,3e227r,emeraldead,4,Tue Jul 21 12:54:28 2015 UTC,"Defending the ACE here since it's actually a pretty nifty exam; its job isn't to assess how severe your abuse was, but how many different kinds of trauma you had, since apparently that's what's most tied to physical health problems (i.e. 4 or more on the ACE quiz = over double the chance of heart disease/smoking/drug issues/risky behavior).  It's more something a physician would use than a therapist, though the latter might use it to get an overview of where to start I guess?  Still, it was actually initially developed by a preventative medicine specialist who was trying to help obese patients loose weight and realized that the ones who were having trouble were the ones with bad childhoods.  This article might be an interesting read."

I remember when someone posted this test before and a 4 was the ""over twice as likely to have heart disease or drug issues"" point.  The article mentions that there's a question about each thing, but I can see where it'd feel like there's some overlap (there's one question for whether you were physically abused, another question for whether your mother was physically abused, and so on)."
raisedbynarcissists,3e227r,yohan64,4,Tue Jul 21 15:08:29 2015 UTC,"It's not a hard diagnosis, anything over 2 is probably still a red flag. Think of it as a litmus test for childhood trauma."

Instead of message bombing her, he should just make an attempt at contact once a week and let her know he's interested in building a relationship, but would respect her boundaries if she said no. I have siblings myself who I haven't fully reached out to due to the ""Possible FM"" fear. It's a slow process of building trust. I talk to them once every couple of weeks and so far they haven't done anything to worry me which is helping me trust and talk to them more. Your fiance could suggest a meetup somewhere public for lunch, or a skype call or a phone call but this will take time and might freak her out if suggested too early. I myself have agreed to go to lunch sometime in the future but have told them it would be when I'm ready.   The point is, slow and steady. Let her know communication is on her grounds and that you are understanding of any hesitation. If he was the GC at one point, she may be somewhat resentful and even more afraid. Let her know that he knows what happened was wrong, regardless of status. Just try to be as open and understanding as possible.

She can't hide her bad syntax and her terms, she gave it away just like yours did.   I brought it to his attention. He was irritated but so beaten down that he barely reacted. I had to say ""this isn't ok, she could really use this against you if she's angry"" before it got through to him. To be honest, I think he was angry but trying not to react. I told him that even though it isn't his fault, it made me think twice before contacting him, as she might have access, and I don't trust her.

All those things I used to find super difficult were suddenly a snap.

X might be huge, like getting a job with a living wage and sorting out your finances, or it might be small, like making coffee before 8am this morning, or tiny, like smiling back at that stranger who's walking by.     Whatever your pace is, go that pace. Be at peace with where you're at in life, and give yourself achievable goals. It's okay to be you. It's okay to be where you're at. Show yourself some love.

You feel like you're alone in this because no one ever listens to you - or when you TRY to do it on your own, it's so much more difficult realizing that no one else is happy for you. The only attention you got was when you failed, so she could ""save"" you. This is such a dysfunctional base for even an occasionally dangerous family relationship/living situation. Quite simply, people just aren't supposed to be like that.  I really have faith that you will figure this out on your own, as hard as it seems right now.

When I was 19 I applied for a national park as a housekeeper. National parks always need people especially in the summer. A month later I got the job and moved out to the park. I lived in a tent cabin with two roomates. No electricity bill, no water bill, no cell phone bill. It was hard to get reception anyways. I had about 20 bucks when I came there and got on the meal plan which is a way to eat 3 meals a day at any restraunt I want in the park for a small fee. My rent was about 15 a week but you only get charged by it being taken out of your check.

What made things worse was when I would go to help, she'd stand in the way like she was helping (I'm helping!) or was absolutely needed for the task at hand. When I'd tell her to move, that was the most insulting thing I could do. Just the other day, she was struggling zipping up a bag. She had her hand blocking me from doing it, so I just took the bag and zipped it myself. Her response, ""Don't move my hand like I'm a piece of shit."" No one even said that...No one implied it...She just thinks that about herself, displaces it onto me, thinks I'm the ""piece of shit,"" thinks I'm the one displacing and it gets this, ""How dare this piece of filth treat me this way?!"" reaction.

Have you thought about getting back into school? I know loans and school tuition costs is the last thing you want to get sucked into, but maybe you could look into going to school and live on campus for a while, and in the meantime working on a career path that you might like. I have a friend that chose that route, and it seemed to work out for him. He was super lucky finding a nice internship that ended up becoming his permanent job. Not sure if that would work for everyone, but just a thought."

raisedbynarcissists,3dy4q0,earl_colby_pottinger,8,Mon Jul 20 17:51:04 2015 UTC,"If you're a spoiled brat, who did the spoiling? Kids don't spoil themselves, you know.  All joking aside, what she did was deny you the skills you'd need to live on your own. That's not cool. My mom did the same to me and I am 32 and still trying for my college degree (but almost done now, thank God, and with good prospects for being self-supporting afterward). I'm ""lucky"" enough to have a disability, so when I realized I was completely unready to be on my own, no matter how many jobs I tried to do, I was able to get bare-minimum social security. I've only been homeless once, for a summer, and like you, survived through the kindness of friends.  Point being is that you can survive this. The whole suicide thing--I've thought about it too, and pretty seriously sometimes; but the trouble with suicide is that you have to give up all the hope in life, all the good things. Hot coffee; warm spring days; good movies; learning something new; helping someone else--you have to give all that up if you kill yourself. I've found out over the years that when things get bad, I find a way to survive the situation. I've gotten to be smart and tough and I don't really know how to give up. And all that despite a mom who spent my childhood trying to make me dependent.  I don't know what resources you have and how good you are at getting hooked up with what's available. If you're still working on the food-and-shelter basics, check for local food pantries, and ask them to refer you to places where you could get help. Regarding that job, pretty much anyplace where you go to get food or shelter or whatever will have contacts for job-search offices. That's the first thing you ask for--a way to get a job. Right now you're not looking for the perfect job; just a job, period. Ask your friends if you can use their address as your home address, because you need one if you're going to work. The degree will look good on a job application, but you may not be able to get a related job right away. For the time being you're probably going to want a job, any job. If your friends will let you stay once you're employed, pay an equal share of the rent; sharing apartments is a good resource for people just getting out on their own, with low incomes.  Oh, and your mom? Yeah. She wants you to come crying back to her. Why do you think she tossed you out? She wants you to admit you need her. She wants you to worship her like she's graciously saving your worthless life just by existing. See the manipulation there? Don't fall for it. You've got your own life.  Keep things simple while you learn all the little stuff you need to live on your own... you'll be okay."
raisedbynarcissists,3dy4q0,puss_parkerswidow,3,Mon Jul 20 20:26:58 2015 UTC,"Yes!  She is hoping for you to come begging back to her.  As tough as your new future is likely to be, keep going!  Away from her!  It will only get better from here.    I know there will be some downswing, if you were to chart your life satisfaction in the near term, little ups like being out from under her scrutiny, and downs like dealing with setting your entire life up starting now, it's daunting.  And over the next couple years it will be a bit of a grind, it always is in your twenties.    But when you look back just a year or two from now, maybe even in not that many months if you find some luck, you will really be able to see how much better you have made your life.  The ups and downs really will trend up the chart.    Courage is not a lack of fear, it is what you have when you go forward DESPITE all your fears.  Life out in the world is not really as bad or hard as she tried to make you think, but with anxiety you may doubt that.    I lived out of my car for two years, and I could not tell you how far I have come, C-PTSD and all, but it is farther than I ever believed I could make it.  It was such a relief just to be away from the tyrants that didn't believe in me, I was happy freezing in my own car, eating shitty food, working labor intensive jobs, just being free to do and learn my own way."
raisedbynarcissists,3dy4q0,InvincibleSummer1066,7,Mon Jul 20 23:06:56 2015 UTC,Would you be comfortable sharing what city you are in/closest to? Maybe someone here is from the same area and could help you find some local help.

Moving away from an NParent -- far, far away -- feels AWESOME. Just knowing there are several states between my mom and me is a comfort. I got the hell out of my home state as soon as I could. Do you have various things you need (birth certificate, social security card) etc. to be independent?"
raisedbynarcissists,3dy4q0,sock2014,4,Mon Jul 20 19:18:13 2015 UTC,Actually my original plan was to move to Miami. I'm just scared I won't have any direction once I'm there. I want to know I have a place to live. I do have my documents and have been filed as an independent since last tax season.
raisedbynarcissists,3dy4q0,Scouterfly,8,Mon Jul 20 19:55:52 2015 UTC,"my new found respect for myself  Hold on to that, because it's a start. Please don't harm yourself when you're just getting started. 26 is quite young. We didn't get real freedom from our Ns until now, and we are in our 40s, so there's a lot of people going through what you're dealing with at various stages in life. 26 is not too late. 40 is not too late. It's never too late. A day without any N interference is a day worth experiencing.   I mean, shit- get on Craigslist and look for a cheap room in a shared house, and never look back. She'd love it if you really couldn't make it in the world- so show her she's a dumb hag and you can build your own life from here on out."
raisedbynarcissists,3dy4q0,langleywaters,8,Mon Jul 20 16:36:49 2015 UTC,"My plan right now is to find a cheap enough room. I found one for $600 a month, which sadly is my paycheck for the month and then there's electric...and food...and transportation. But I'll take the hit and take money out of my savings. As much as I'd hate to do it, I'm going to try to get government benefits. Even $100 for food would be enough for me."
raisedbynarcissists,3dy4q0,satmary,9,Mon Jul 20 16:39:29 2015 UTC,"Food banks, food stamps, emergency financial help- try 'em all. That's what they are there for. Good luck to you- I know it's very expensive to live out there, and thankfully you do have savings. If it's Top Ramen for a month or two- it's still better than the bitter taste of mom's bullshit."
raisedbynarcissists,3dy4q0,trixie91,5,Mon Jul 20 16:44:31 2015 UTC,"Hahaha! I was already intending to go to 8th avenue in Brooklyn where they have a whole selection of Ramen. Believe me, I'm not above that at all!"
raisedbynarcissists,3dy4q0,trixie91,5,Mon Jul 20 16:46:53 2015 UTC,"I actually like it- but when I first got out, I had this shit hole apartment in Dallas with orange shag carpet and blood stained curtains. All I could afford to eat was $20 worth of 4/$1 top ramen and .79 cent frozen pizzas. I lived on that for about a year- $20 a week got me enough calories to make it to school and work. That was in 1988, so I don't know how far $20 bucks goes now, but Ramen's still 4/$1 here anyway."
raisedbynarcissists,3dy4q0,anonymous1446,6,Mon Jul 20 16:54:41 2015 UTC,"Here is 3/$1 for the Ramen and while the pizza is more expensive if I get the double pizzas on special at $7.99 for two pizzas I can get 4 meals out of the two pizzas.  $20 does not go as far as it did in 1988, but it will still buy a lot if you shop around.  PS. I don't know if you have ""Almost Perfect"" stores in New York but they deal in food that got damaged as it was being produced at really low prices.  There is nothing wrong with the food but for example the frozen Jamaican Patties might have breaks in the shell.  The food is still good just not perfect."
raisedbynarcissists,3dy4q0,cait_Cat,4,Mon Jul 20 18:44:19 2015 UTC,"We also have a freight salvage place- the food fell off a truck or something, but it still tastes good and costs a fraction of what it would elsewhere."
raisedbynarcissists,3dy4q0,Easier_Still,8,Mon Jul 20 20:38:10 2015 UTC,"There is nothing wrong with getting government benefits if you need them -- that's the entire purpose. No shame in it at all. Think of it like this: the benefits will help you survive while you learn how to support yourself, and then eventually you'll get a good job and pay them back in taxes. :)"
raisedbynarcissists,3dy4q0,TiredFlower,6,Mon Jul 20 19:20:40 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way also.  Government benefits are for those who cannot fully survive on their own, who need some help due to some kind of condition or circumstance.  Your parents have put you into this condition (by how they've been treating you) and circumstance (by throwing you out) so you are going to need some help to survive, at least for a while.  Use the benefits if you can get them, to get onto your own feet, to rise above what your parents did and have a good life."
raisedbynarcissists,3dy4q0,TiredFlower,6,Mon Jul 20 20:39:02 2015 UTC,"You believe that you're a spoiled brat, because that's how your mother taught you. But you also know that's not right. Hold onto that."

raisedbynarcissists,3dy4q0,strngsvlmstng96,7,Mon Jul 20 16:42:33 2015 UTC,"See, she would always convince me that the world was too difficult for me and that I would somehow screw up and end up in a very bad situation. She embedded into me that I absolutely needed her for my survival. I didn't know any better because this is all I grew up knowing. So I stayed, and I stagnated.   Holy fuck does this ever resonate with me. We're in the same boat- parents made work and adult life out to be the worst thing ever, that I'd never succeed without them, and that I'd screw up horribly without their input and they'd just ""laugh at"" me.  Our parents deliberately tried to screw us up and make us dependent on them forever."
raisedbynarcissists,3dy4q0,IAmAsEvolutionMadeMe,6,Mon Jul 20 18:58:45 2015 UTC,"Hey, so let's get this out there: you have EVERY RIGHT to empathy. It's not something we think we deserve after being raised to think that our feelings are less valuable than garbage. But, you deserve it. You've been through your fair amount of shit, no one can say otherwise.  It's time to stop letting your NMom's voice dictate your mind. You're shitting on yourself even now, as you finally realize she's abused you for so long. That's so unfair to you! Do you realize what you've achieved by finally accepting that your NMom is batshit crazy? You should be so proud of yourself! I'm proud of you! And you know what? Tons of people don't realize their NParents are fucking their lives up until they've reached their 40s, their 50s, even their 60s! So 26? That's a damn good age to realize where things stand.  You may be homeless right now, but that means you're also free. You are free from her. So find a homeless shelter, or ask if you can stay at a friend's a little longer in exchange for you doing chores. If you don't have a job, start looking. Craigslist has all kinds of random opportunities, and they can change your life. I'm not exaggerating, my new job is the best job I've ever had and I found it on Craigslist.  While you're at it, start looking at roommate situations. You probably can't afford it yet, but you might as well start getting a feel for what's out there.  Also, what's happening with your brain tumor? Are you being treated? Will there be issues with that in the future now that you're homeless? I want to help you get all your ducks in a row.  Welcome to your life, welcome to your freedom! You've made it this far, so stop being so mean to yourself! You're an amazing person, making some huge self-discoveries, and overcoming some legit horrible shit. We can do this together!"

Your story is not as unusual as you may think.  Also, if you can contact your father, you may want to give it a shot.

I've been trying to find my father for YEARS :(. I've always wanted a dad. It was hearbreaking because I was taking care of my maternal grandmother on her deathbed one night. We were alone, and I was massaging her bed sores when she said, ""I wish you had an old man."" I was flabbergasted as to how she could be thinking about that on her death bed of all things. She just says, ""Every boy should have an old man."" I just told her I was happy to have had my grandpa. That woman truly cared about me. Both my grandmothers.

That is a thing to be proud of, don't forget that. And don't feel bad for feeling bad, you are doing the best you can :) I remember starting over, and that was the most difficult and painful part because you've been trained to not see how capable & worthwhile you are.   The downs get better...I still remember how the one thing I felt self confident in was in the knowledge that I was going to be in a state of constant misery for the rest of my life.

You might be able to live in the dorms (which, as adult, will suck a little). But it solves your homeless issue and your schooling issue. This isn't the best option for everyone.

We worked together for many years, but they (or at least my nmom) was always lying, cheating, and stealing.  I too would ask what type of parent does this to their own kid?  I never could come up with an answer that was based on reason and logic.     In the end I realized she does not have normal brain functionality. She is beyond help and my efather has slowly lost his ability to run interference for me.  So I pulled the plug and we are currently communicating through attorneys.  I will be happy when it's over.

It is the true point where I knew the choice to divorce my mother was the best choice I made.  Even though we have to pay a lot of money, I feel closure because the battle is over as far as the courts go, the money is just some peices of paper.

Sometimes you're going to feel more one way.  Sometimes you're going to feel more the other way.  That's just the delight that is the proud ownership of brain that operates on associations.  God help your BF if he every has to interview eye witnesses and the mess that is memory, much less opinion.

You deserve someone who treats you like the person you are.   It's a HUGE deal. You're being mistreated by someone who is special to you. This is not right. It's not okay to be treated like this, you deserve better. You honestly do.   You deserve happiness, you deserve everything you've ever asked for because you've dealt with the things you didn't ask for, like this bullcrap. You can easily find another boyfriend who treats you like a princess, and I hope you leave your current boyfriend so you can find him."
raisedbynarcissists,3e03i5,abitbatty,2,Tue Jul 21 01:47:37 2015 UTC,"Not only is he a narcissist, he sounds like he might fit the profile of someone with Borderline Personality Disorder.   Check out r/BPDLovedones. It can be an eye opener.   He is verbally abusing you and that is not ok. It's probably not the first or the last time he's done it, so you should start thinking whether or not you want to stay with someone who's definition of a relationship is completely dysfunctional."
raisedbynarcissists,3e03i5,Cranberry_Lips,2,Tue Jul 21 05:22:33 2015 UTC,Oh sweetie - you need to take a step back and take a look at how he is treating you. This is a bigger deal than you are making it out to be. Please please give serious thought to getting away from his abuse.

I feel like if you would of said X you should have said Y and vice versa. He should not speak to you like that. It's wrong to be treated that way, you don't deserve it and it is a big deal. If you're having trouble maybe speak with a therapist to help. i think for your better interest you should end the relationship. you should be with someone who respects you and doesnt make you feel bad about yourself. please consider ending the relationship, my ex was like that i was terrified of him bc of his anger but it doesn't get better they don't change"

When I was a teenager till my early twenties, anytime I disagreed with him he made it about him and not about the topic. He had a heart attack a few years back and stops being so confrontational about it, just gets upset that I don't agree and tried to play a less emotional, ""not how I raised you"" card.

I know it's really unhealthy, I can't help it.  That is a really, really petty issue for him to blow up and say those things. As a woman with lots of insecurities (unlike the woman you listed, I am curvier, very pale, brown hair), I feel for you. And what he's saying is not ok.   Have you sat him down and seriously talked to him about this? Do it when you are NOT angry, that never ever works. Calmy explain your side. Put everything into as simplistic/least emotional terms as possible.  And if it's like my case, that you're actually insecure about him looking at stuff and making comments like that, AND he's surprised when you react the way you do, that's not cool.  You're not crazy, no one should be spoken to that way. I am infamous for provoking that behavior out of my bf, so if that's your case too, I understand. Once again, all you can do is explain every step of the way."

raisedbynarcissists,3e1mnt,iamtoastshayna69,2,Tue Jul 21 06:59:24 2015 UTC,"I'm going to vote for awareness / mindfulness / whateveryouwannacallit. Basically, the ability to focus on the right-now can be a huge help. Short form: Understanding ourselves and being aware of how we react to situations is a very useful tool.     Example: Let's say I'm at work, and I get a call from someone who's clearly calling for inappropriate reasons (i.e., a sex-grat caller). I can feel myself getting not just frustrated, but increasingly anxious. Things can go several ways:   I ignore the signs that I'm anxious, and keep pushing on to try and help this person. This encourages the caller to continue their abusive behavior, and increases my anxiety. If they call back, things get worse. I ignore the signs that I'm anxious, and give in to frustration, and get angry at the caller. This escalates the situation, and the call ends with threats from their end and panic on mine. If they call back, things get worse. I acknowledge my anxiety, recognize that it's not just the caller who's setting me off, provide them with mental health resources, and end the call. If they call back, I end the call. Every time.      My anxiety is based on a learned response from my toxics, who had some really messed-up ideas about appropriate behavior and boundaries.      What I need to be aware of:   The signs that I'm anxious (feeling my face heating up, breathing and heartbeat speeding up, tension in the muscles, getting teary-eyed) That the caller is the trigger, not the root cause. That I'm not in control of my emotions, and I'm not in control of other people. That I am in control of my actions. That if I do something impulsive and dumb based on my emotions, it's okay. I can fix it, and work not to repeat it."
raisedbynarcissists,3e1mnt,PurpleNovember,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:15:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I have been dealing with some self doubt because of the berating of my Nmom (not even the abusive home, I've came to terms with that for the most part) For example, I got a 8 month old puppy, I love her to death but we keep her in a cage most of the time because I am scared to death of letting her walk around the house because my Nmom told me I'm a horrible pet parent and I am afraid something will happen to her. Everytime I even think about letting her walk around the house, even on a leash its like a huge sign saying NO! pops up in my head and there's never any progress. I know it's not her fault and I want to give it one last try with advice before I give up and give her to another home. Do you have any advice on getting past this huge blockage?"
raisedbynarcissists,3e1mnt,PurpleNovember,2,Tue Jul 21 07:29:40 2015 UTC,"Wall of text ahead!     Puppies are awesome! They're also generally little bundles of energy that zoom around at top speed then fall asleep on their feet and they bounce off the walls and go to sleep on your lap and they might destroy household items at times and in the middle of playing with their favorite toy they just crash. (And they can emit truly heinous, room-clearing farts. It's pretty impressive.) They're small, and fragile-looking... but they're actually incredibly sturdy-- even the smallest ones are made to last, so to speak.     Some friends of ours have a puppy who's not quite six months old, and has two settings: asleep and OMG I'M A DOG OMG OMG I'M GONNA RUN EVERYWHERE. She falls down steps, up steps, off their porch, over furniture a half-dozen times a day. Once she ran directly into a wall at top dog speed. She was fine.     Now, like you said ""Nmom told me I'm a horrible pet parent""-- and that? That is awareness-- knowing that you're not responding to the situation as it is, but to what she said.     The thing is, she's wrong. She's not just mistaken, she was deliberately undermining you, because that's what toxics do: they lie to us, to keep us under their control.     So, some possible exercises:   Start letting your little fluffball out of her cage, and keeping her fairly close to you-- depending on her age, it might be a good time to start leash training. While you're petting her or playing with her or keeping her from eating the carpet, repeat to yourself: ""She's fine. She's fine. She's fine. She's fi-- okay, she thinks her reflection is another dog and now she's pissed off. All right, she's fine again."" If you feel yourself getting scared, do a breathing exercise (breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, exhale for a count of four-- slowing your heart rate and breathing can help slow the anxiety response), and just watch your puppy-- look at how she's not hurt. Possibly running around like she's lost her mind, but not hurt. Acknowledge that yes, at some point she may get hurt-- just like a person, sometimes animals do the Wrong Thing. We can't protect ourselves 24-7, and we can't protect our pets. Make sure you have the vet information on hand, so that if you need it, it's right there. When you hear your Ns voice lying to you about what a horrible pet parent you are, remind yourself that she is abusive. By default, anything she says is almost certainly based in toxic-reality, not real-reality."
raisedbynarcissists,3e1mnt,PurpleNovember,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:44:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you, you have given me better and more uplifting advice than the therapists that I have been seeing as long as I can remember (quite literally, I've been on meds since at least 5 years old) It's hard to find people who understand what I have been through and what I grew up with. I have lived over the years with 5 different N's in four houses (it's like they are attracted to me) so I am so used to the abuse and have tried to escape it so many times so it feels so amazingly good to get advice from someone who truly understands on a level that no one else does! Thank you!"
raisedbynarcissists,3e1mnt,PurpleNovember,2,Tue Jul 21 08:12:39 2015 UTC,"Very glad to have been of help! Therapists and counselors can be incredibly useful, since they help us to get out of our heads-- but recovery from abuse is a whole new ballgame, and there can be an incredibly wide range of problems that need addressing. If you do the therapy thing again, you might, if you haven't already, look into DBT (dialectical behavior therapy), since many of us who are action-oriented find it more useful than some of the other approaches. Also:      it's like they are attracted to me      Yeah, that takes time to get rid of. The thing is, when we're raised by toxics, we internalize certain beliefs: that we're responsible for Fixing Things, that we need to stop or start doing X or Y, that we're responsible for other people's emotions, etc.     So behavior that would have other people going ""WTF get out of here!"" have us going ""Okay, I can fix this. I know I can."" So it isn't that we're magnets, we just have a way-too-high threshold for assholery. The good news is, as you've found, we get faster at dumping them as we go along!"

raisedbynarcissists,3e1mnt,rhizomatousperennial,0,Tue Jul 21 09:07:10 2015 UTC,"That's the thing with personality disorders-- as a psych student, you know that the patterns of behavior are consistent, even if the details change. It's just really, really hard to spot them when you're inside the crazy.

raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,leoblaze__84,32,Mon Jul 20 16:47:05 2015 UTC,"YES YES AND YES!!!  Omg, I was silently screaming when I read the title of this post. FINALLY someone else that has gone through my daily life!  Sadly I never really knew what a hoarder was until my coworkers got together last year (after hearing enough of my frustrations about unusable parts of the house) and basically all said ""Uhhh, you're in a hoarding situation.""  Same thing with the mail. We still have bills from 1996 sitting there. I.am.not.kidding. When she started work again the brand new couch she'd bought that seats 3 people became her ""filing cabinet"". As of the end of last year it is totally unusable by any living being as it's covered in paper, boxes, gifts (from work) and dust. New couch - barely used!  Our hall bathroom's shower has been unusable since 1997 - the shower bar is now a clothes rack for Nmom. Started out as just a few of her freshly dry cleaned sunday dresses, it's progressed to allll her work clothes, sunday dresses, dead NGM's clothes (creepy and weird to see). The steel bar is literally sagging. Not to mention only having 1 shower was rough with 4 adults in the house (we now have 3 which is not much better!).   We have a new beautiful glass kitchen table. Was used maybe 1-2 times? Quickly became a mail-holder, + junkfood + dog treats.   (I should mention in all this that I have always operated by the whole ""I don't throw your stuff out unless I ask first."" even though I don't always get the same treatment. So the stuff HAS to stay there unless I convince her it can go)  Only half of the stove burners are useable. We have her ""vitamin"" bottles plus food plus an empty casserole dish that was my NGMs that she never gave back and now NGM is passed away.   Oh and speaking of the kitchen, the pantry is only minimally used because my dad rules the pantry and is extremely OCD, so he organizes it so it has little function for anyone but himself. The REST of the dry goods/food is on the FLOOR. It's gathering dust bunnies and talking up 25% of the kitchen floor now.... expanding outwards.   Now that my brother is moved out Nmom is determined she's ""got dibs"" on his room as some sore of weird shrine/sanctuary for herself, so when she was obsessed with buying clothes last year she loaded up 2 clothes hooks with massive amounts of clothes on the door, and hung the rest on the door frame!!! So basically to get in that room you have to do the limbo to get under her clothes and hope to God your hair doesn't get caught on them or else an avalanche of clothes will start. The dogs won't even go in that room anymore because they're afraid of the clothes avalanche.   Yet... when I was growing up this is how it went:  *When I was 12 she took over my bedroom because she didn't want to sleep with dad anymore. I got relegated to the couch, which I was ok with, but needed my stuff/books by the couch to conduct my usual business. I was always screamed at that I was ""taking over"" her livingroom (while she turned my room into a shitstorm).   *At 19 years old - 19!!!!!!!!!!!!! I finally got a new bed with the promise of being able to sleep in my own room again. Nmom proceeded to set up the new bed and use it for another 6 months before finally relinquishing it. Major resentment. She found every item I owned and tried to shove it into my room.  *Did I mention that my room was never really my room? I was never allowed to put posters up, and my closet houses all her college/early marriage crap - wedding gown, graduation gown, etc. My room also houses my dads keepsake furniture.   *Oh and the garage - we have 4 vehicles crammed on the driveway. Nothing fits in the garage. The parents keep EVERY single box anything comes in because ""If it's defective we might need to send it back!!!"" OMG....   I have a lot of trouble cooking/showering/doing laundry and even brushing my teeth because of their ability to hog everything or make whole areas of the house unusable. It's hard to explain to a boss why you were late that morning when in fact it's due to Hoarder N's making only one bathroom available and then choosing a crazy hour of the early AM to hog the one remaining bathroom so you literally have to leave the house unshowered after having peed in a bucket outside (and you're late because you waiting that extra 5 minutes thinking they'd be out of the bathroom).  -____-"

raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,TheKunit,4,Tue Jul 21 02:26:11 2015 UTC,"""I don't throw your stuff out unless I ask first.""   FUCKING THIS. SAME PHRASE AND EVERYTHING.  And the shower thing? Our master shower stall was completely full of various items and became part of her hoarders nest.  AND THE CLOTHES BUYING.   A new online shipment came in EVERY WEEK. We had no space and she'd blame me when the stuff ended up on the floor or damaged because the closets weren't big enough. And washing the clothes? She had this idea that the house was infested with mites that only bit her because she was ""special"" so everything had to be washed just before she wore it which meant I had to put five or six massive loads of clean clothes in the wash every other week. And they all had to be hung dry INSIDE. I hated that so much.  THE ROOM TAKEOVER. Her room became a hoarders nest so she took mine and I had to move my stuff to a single shelf int the other hoarded room and a bit of overflow in the living room. You'd think she understood if my things were out but no! I'm taking over her livingroom.   THE GARAGE. We once had a truck in it, but eventually the clutter took over the two car garage and it had to go on the street next to the other two cars and the RV which was also a hoard spot. Did I mention there were two of us in the house?  And the remaining bathroom hogging. So much this. Hours on end in there just sitting and doing WHATEVER. I was forced to pee in the kitchen sink over and over again. And showering? Was barely able to get one a week thanks to her crazy.  Did we like grow up in the same house but on a different dimension or what?"

raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,theshinepolicy,13,Tue Jul 21 03:21:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, my mother was/is a hoarder too.  I have a blog about my crazy hoarding mother.  I'm so sorry you're having to live with that.    Interesting how the mess was my fault (and my brother's, and my dad's, and the dogs' -- she blamed literally everyone in the house but herself) and yet got dramatically worse after I left.  Actually, based on the rare photos I've seen in recent years, it doesn't look like it has gotten much better since even my mother left, which means my dad has a hoarding problem too (he recently sent me photos of his new collection of over 100 pipes, and there was hoard in the background).  The only way I was able to deal with it was to move.  You still have drive to want to live in a clean, pleasant place, but if your mother is anything like mine, she has lost that."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,wetoldyounottotell,10,Mon Jul 20 18:10:38 2015 UTC,"My dad is much the same, but his hoarding isn't the ridiculous kind. He's a master carpenter, and he has an entire room in the basement filled to the brim with tools he's bought or found along the road, and nails and facets and knobs and everything under the sun for hardware. He also has a whole bookshelf of fishing lures in cases. The difference I see is that he keeps it organized to the point where you can at least walk, and everything has a bin. Also, whenever he needs something, he can go dive into whatever tub he has. Like if he needs a knob, he'll go to the hardware tub and find one. I'd be okay to live in that, but it's the piles of stuff that just aren't allowed to move that drive me nuts.  I also feel like the same thing is going to happen when I leave. When every time I've gone away on trips lasting a couple days, I come home to find the house trashed. I know that when I'm gone for good it's going to be a nightmare."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,anax_junius,8,Mon Jul 20 18:31:10 2015 UTC,"Yep, this. The piles of stuff you aren't allowed to move are the WORST. When I visit my parents now, there's often literally nowhere to sit except the floor or outdoors - and then they get grouchy with me for 'avoiding them', when I go sit outside, because at least there are chairs out there. I still visit to see my pets, but once they're not around...  Dad's been talking about cleaning up for years, but I don't think it's ever going to happen.   Since I moved out, my old bedroom's become about 2/3 unuseable, filled with untouched boxes of stuff from Grampa's house. The only rooms that are still functional are their bedroom, the upstairs bathrooms, the living room, and the kitchen. The porch, my/my brother's childhood bedrooms, the mudroom, Dad's office, and the whole downstairs are all cluttered to the point where they're unuseable and often impassible. :\  And yet somehow it was always our fault, and when we had to have someone over for a school project, we got screamed at for hours and hours while we frantically piled Mom's hoard into laundry baskets to hide in bedrooms. I didn't realize that wasn't normal until... very recently."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,laeiryn,3,Mon Jul 20 18:47:21 2015 UTC,"I like to think there's a difference between being a pack rat (behavior described like your dad : keeps stuff he knows how to use, is useful to his profession, takes care of it, and actually does stuff with it) as opposed to a hoarder (keeps unnecessary things, esp. outright garbage, and refuses to organize, reacting irrationally to throwing things away, etc.).    I have to believe this because I'm a pack rat and while all my art supplies and books and shiny toys are carefully tucked away most of the time, I like collecting stuff and have occasionally worried I might be a hoarder... until I see real hoarders. Then I am very quickly reminded that no, I do not live like that."

I also wouldn't mind if they had to be borrowed/moved/reorganized, and they're certainly not a thing I use as a means of control. My dad would probably be the same way.

raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,frettingranddaughter,11,Mon Jul 20 22:50:39 2015 UTC,"I also want to say thank you to everyone here for sharing. I've only been on this reddit for a few weeks and I was beginning to feel like I dodged the physical stuff, so I didnt deserve to be here. That maybe I was wrong, being too harsh in my judgement... But here it is. My Nmom fits riiiiight in.  ...oddly enough it makes me feel better"
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,Bookwormkeeper9000,8,Mon Jul 20 21:01:39 2015 UTC,"Are you a minor? If so, call CPS. At a minimum it will give you and your dad an out. Hoarding is a sign of a serious mental illness and there is literally nothing that you can do to stop her. Your dad has more leverage, but if he isn't willing to stand up to her, nothing is going to change.  Also, I would be careful with the mail. Throwing out another person's mail is technically illegal and she is going to go nuts if she is forced to deal with her crap.  edit: also my dad was a hoarder, but luckily my mom was able to keep it under control in the main part of the house."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,gujayeon,5,Mon Jul 20 19:46:01 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I am not a minor, but I've been tempted to call on behalf of my minor brother. Fortunately for him, he's the GC, and has mimicked her hoarding behavior, but it's all MY fault the house is dirty.   I'm seriously not worried about the mail part. I literally had to transition to paying my credit card bill online because she would get the mail, see it was for me, and throw it away. I haven't seen one of my bank statements for almost a year. Also, about two weeks ago, I ordered some wire off of amazon because I decided I wanted to start sculpting, and it said delivered, so I started asking about it. Turns out she took my package, and shoved it into the back of the china hutch. She still had every intention of giving it to me though... Clearly. And if I hadn't had the delivery receipt, she probably would have told me she had no idea where it was.  She blames both me and my dad. and both of us deny it. She has no idea who really did it. If she threatened to pursue legal action, I'd threaten to do the same and call CPS. That's always shut her down. Doesn't change the fact that after I clean the house is trashed again three days later, but at least I can clean without dire consequences.  My dad has tried for years to get it to stop, but his parents were divorced, so he has this weird desire to make their marriage work for my brother and me. He doesn't seem to realize that we would probably be better off if they were divorced, but I've given up convincing him."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,Cranksta,7,Mon Jul 20 23:48:26 2015 UTC,"My grandma was like this.  I didn't live with her so I would just resign myself to accept it.  I frequently fantasized about just burning the whole place down to the ground.  The mess was always, in her mind, someone else's fault.  Get out if you can!  There is no correcting this situation while you're entrenched in all the crazy."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,gujayeon,7,Mon Jul 20 16:50:44 2015 UTC,"PREACH, I cannot tell you the struggles I've been through with Nmom's hoarding.  The cries of ""I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS ANYMORE!"" echo through my head daily.  Mom, if you want a clean house, you have to throw shit out.  Everything we tossed out had to be cleared by her and put into a specific waste basket.  Holy Jesus. I had issues with hoarding as a result of her behavior until one day I snapped and through away literally 25 boxes of papers, belongings, etc.  She hit me for throwing away MY OWN things and screamed at me.  That was one of the many things that made me realize she was batshit."

raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,rainbowsockmonkey,6,Tue Jul 21 04:56:55 2015 UTC,"OMG YES! My Mum was exactly like this, it frustrated the hell out of me. She died when I was 15, within 24 hours of her passing, my Dad and I assembled a team of 20 people to clear out the house. We got rid of 3 skips worth from a tiny house. It was so necessary as you couldn't even walk through the house anymore, you had to climb. There's a funny video of my then 8 year old sister falling into a mountain of clutter, that reminds me how bad it was. Only difference though is that my Mum collected newspapers, we had them from 1986, my parents moved into the house in 1993 so she brought them from an old house, which was ridiculous! But the mess was always everyone else's fault, glad to have a clean (compared to then) house now!"
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,Cranksta,5,Mon Jul 20 19:48:39 2015 UTC,"Your nmom her sounds exactly like mine. I feel you, OP."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,rainbowsockmonkey,5,Mon Jul 20 20:43:11 2015 UTC,"Yes! My mom is a hoarder and her son is the same way. She is now confined to barely/unable to walk (because she is so obese her legs gave out) but her son also dumpster dives. When I was a kid I was no better in terms of messiness, but there is so much mail on the diningroom table that we cannot all sit and eat a meal. The kitchen is my brother's dumping ground.  But if I don't vacuum and mop every weekend, I'm awful and don't contribute etc etc. Nevermind I can't mop with his paintball/work/airbrush/tools/clothes/GARBAGE is covering 80% of the kitchen. Vacuum it. Mop it. But if I move something, I am screamed at by my brother because things get lost every time I touch anything. We literally got a dumpster before my father god fed up and left, and my brother climbed in and pulled out broken  toys and old clothes and useless crap. He brings home garbage from other people and loads our house with it. We have pathways through it, and in some cases cannot see our walls/ceiling. If I could bring my dog with me I would move in with dad. But THAT she would never forgive because not only did I choose his side, I would have betrayed her by associating with the stepmother. My best friend and I have overhauled the house to livable half a dozen times in a decade. We have given up. Now we are saving up to move out and she doesnt know. I can't wait for that conversation.  The feels, we have them. You are not alone."

raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,emeraldead,3,Tue Jul 21 02:55:28 2015 UTC,I just emptied some of my old things out of my closet to donate and she tried to make me keep my high school graduation dress (5 sizes too small) because SHE liked roses
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,emeraldead,2,Tue Jul 21 04:33:48 2015 UTC,"I literally have to hide clothes I throw away now. Unless it's something she hates. I'm a S/M and she's a M/L just depending on the store, and she'll grab it out of the trash and say that SHE'LL wear it then. She's a filled out woman while I'm on my way there, and I'm just like... Um... That might get around your head, but it's definitely not going to fit your womanly form. She has one of those hot tub like bathtubs in her master bath and it's filled with clothes she cannot wear, but refuses to throw away. The master closet hasn't been openable for years either, so she's got this disgusting cocoon of clean and dirty clothes around her bed..."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,patientetherizd,5,Tue Jul 21 17:36:49 2015 UTC,"Oh god, yes. My mom's always been the type to keep stuff she doesn't necessarily NEED, but it's blown up into full-blown hoarding since nstepdad faded out of the picture.  Like- right now nmom and I live in a 2-bedroom 1-bath duplex. Roughly 75% of the house is crammed with nmom's junk. No exaggeration there. Her bedroom is stacked floor-to-ceiling with cardboard boxes filled with everything from HUNDREDS OF PAIRS of shoes (literally hundreds- last time I counted there were upwards of 250) to dozens of leather jackets and double-stacked racks of dresses that aren't even in her size. Even the mattress she used to sleep on is put on top of- you guessed it- BOXES. Everything she doesn't feel like dealing with right then and there gets tossed on the bed. Surprise surprise, once something's on the bed it just stays there. The layer of junk on top of the mattress has to be close to a foot thick now. You literally cannot close the door into that room, there's too much random crap in the way, and just recently it's started spilling out into the hallway.   It's the same story in the front room. There are two couches and a ottoman out there. Only ONE can be sat on, and that's the couch nmom sleeps on. Right this instant the ottoman is buried in yet more boxes, with a scattering of paperwork and junk mail for flavor. The other couch is covered in partially rolled-up throw rugs. The entire outside wall of that room is stacked floor to ceiling in those stackable plastic organizers. Every single drawer is full. There's jewelry in there, and clock parts, and beads and dried flowers and god only knows what else. She's obsessed with 'organizing' that room. Thing is, she never actually gets rid of anything. She just moves stuff from point A to point B, all whilst buying MORE JUNK to 'organize' her preexisting junk.  The kitchen's even worse. Mom's notorious for cooking things and forgetting about them. Nine times out of ten her 'projects' are left on the stove or the counter until they mold. Hell, half the time the DISHES are left to soak so long the water starts molding over. Every single shelf and cupboard is crammed with canned, dried or otherwise shelf-stable food, the vast majority of which we can't even eat. A good third of it is at least a year past its expiry date. Our fridge is a magnificent clusterfuck of moldy towels, months-old baggies of leftovers and cartons of eggs from last December. No one in the house drinks milk- nmom straight-up can't- but she still brings home half-gallons of milk every week. At last count we have six of them in there. The 'freshest' one expired in June.  Our garage is, again, nothing but boxes. At least a third of them, maybe more, are empty. She refuses to get rid of any because 'she wants to reorganize things out there', and 'she'll need them when she moves to the coast'. We've got a 20x30 storage unit across town, and even that's stacked to the rafters. Her car is, again, full of boxes. On the rare occasion I have to get in the car, I wind up sitting on a foot-thick layer of empty soda cans, towels and junk mail she hasn't 'gotten around to dealing with yet'.   I swear to god my mother loves her boxes more than she loves me.   The best part is, I'm not allowed to get rid of any of this shit. Nmom insists she's going to Ebay the clothing/shoes. (Points where points are due, she did have an Ebay 'business' going for a while. That petered out around May and hasn't started up again.) I'm not even allowed to get rid of my own outgrown clothing. I have to keep it, because 'it'll all fit again when you start losing weight'. Any attempt to de-clutter is met with resistance that escalates to verbal abuse if I don't immediately leave off. I have to sneak six-sizes-too-small shorts out of the house like fucking contraband.  But, of course, the house is a sty and she expects my help in cleaning everything up. Despite my number-one anxiety trigger being clutter. Despite the fact that I can never do anything 'right'. Despite the fact that none of this shit is mine. Isn't living with a narc grand?  (Sorry for the length of this. I, uh. I had more to rant about than I realized.)"
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,toadally-grody,4,Mon Jul 20 22:54:26 2015 UTC,"My mother would do the same thing with clothes. I was seventeen and still had clothes from when I was six in my drawers. If she saw them in the trash, she'd dig them out and tell me that our house doesn't throw away clothes, and she was going to donate them. So the story went for ten years, until I turned 18, was finally allowed to get my license, found a good local hospice, and donated every last one of them. She then refused to talk to me for a week because I filed the tax refund slip under my name. I figure I had to live with it, so I deserved the 200 dollar break.  Edit: Also, before I could donate them, I took it upon myself to make a quilt out of my old shirts that were too small. It's a wonderful quilt, but she was absolutely furious and blew it up to the proportion of me wasting a thousand dollars  by cutting up old clothes with tears and pit stains."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,AgentArtichoke,4,Mon Jul 20 23:54:10 2015 UTC,"Much much milder cases- my aunt is agoraphobic and a hoarder, but I just don't go back there anymore.  When the day truly comes they move from the roach ridden apartment, I'll take care of my stuff from childhood.  I had a boss and his wife was very similar in that if she didn't SEE the stuff going out, it was totally fine and she'd never miss it.  When they went on vacation, I tended to toss 6 or more bags of old paper.  But if she ever saw it go- she would stop and go through each piece of paper and find a reason to keep it.  You can't change your mom, she is sick.  Either you'll need an intervention or to simply physically move her and get the house cleaned yourself.  Get yourself out."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,Cranksta,3,Mon Jul 20 20:26:52 2015 UTC,"Oh and the wife of the family I live with keeps papers, but at a much slower rate and if you can get to the mail and toss it first, it's never an issue."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,MyThoughtsBreakMe,4,Mon Jul 20 20:27:51 2015 UTC,"I can relate to some of these issues.  My nmom used to keep an ultra-clean house, and Gods help you if you put anything out of place.  That stopped around 2004 when I moved out.  (How rude of me, amirite?)  She couldn't deal with the empty nest, so she let an old friend from high school move in temporarily.  He stayed for something like 8 years...much to the chagrin of my edad who was footing all the bills.  So along with hoarding PEOPLE, my nmom also started saving mail and coupons and recipes and Christmas cookie tins and craft supplies and printed out email forwards and just general junk.  Skipping forward, my family had Christmas at the parents house last year for the first time in ages because my Grandma was recovering from an injury.  I came home a week early to clean the first floor, and I barely got done.  No ""thanks"" or anything btw, just constant fights and interruptions about what I was allowed to clean.  I felt like an archaeologist at a dig site dealing with the dining room table.  Fun fact, the oldest papers I found near the bottom where from late 2006--when I started dating my future husband.  I feel like her hoarding is a way to punish me for growing up and trying to be a normal member of society.  Or I could be reading too much into it...as she has accused me of doing in many other situations."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,DiligerentJewl,4,Mon Jul 20 21:14:17 2015 UTC,"YES! Particularly the part about it all being my fault. I boarded, and at the end of ever term I came back and more and more of my room had been taken up with new stuff she'd bought. Eventually it ended up that we had to just share a bedroom  Ok, actually, we shared a bed. Til I was 17. I'm still ashamed to admit that. I don't even think I've ever told anyone that. Not even my boyfriend. Ugh. It only stopped when she met someone new. And then when she'd get drunk and fight with him she'd ask to sleep in my SINGLE bed so I'd have to sleep on the sofa. Except we didnt have a sofa. It was an armchair. That was covered in food and wine stains and cat piss.  But anyway, back to the hoarding. Obviously all my fault - even though I wasn't there. They were all things she'd bought for me apparently,  though in the few instances when they were gifts they were, you know, guilt gifts. Or items of clothing she'd saved for me for when I was older (basically ended up forced to adopt her style and wear things I didnt like), or the house was like that because I never tidied it. Yeah ok, fuck school work or being a normal ten year old, or having a life, im gonna tidy up the mess my mum spent her whole life making. My dad says when they moved house she moved boxes that hadn't been opened in years from loft to loft to loft. They were full of, amongst other things, hundreds of letters from her ex-ex-husband. So weird.  She was also obsessed with trawling charity shops to add to her ""collections"". She. Collected. Everything. All sorts of collectibles. I always think of the shelves they might have proudly sat on in someones house/museum devoted to that one thing instead of just in boxes and piled up under years worth of ironing.  All these things to save money too... don't throw away the jar the gherkins came in, then we can save money on buying vinegar. When did we ever fucking buy vinegar anyway? Never. So we just had 20 jars of gherkin juice sat in the kitchen. FYI,  that stuff rots.  Fuck. Thanks for writing this."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,Chipl95,2,Mon Jul 20 22:48:43 2015 UTC,"Yup, me and my sisters took turns sharing mom's bed.

raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,berubeland,2,Tue Jul 21 01:22:04 2015 UTC,"THE BED SHARING. It was until I was 17 too and only stopped because we lived in a hotel and could only afford a two queen bed room. I barely got to sleep on my own even then.   And the hoarding of the ""gifts"" she bought me or was ""saving"" for me without me actually wanting them. SO MUCH YES.   AND THE COLLECTING. She would buy antiques online every week and then go crazy if they were put out of sight...even though they hardly left their box. She squandered so much money it's not even funny.   I feel you so much."

I rarely had to share one with her for any extended period of time. But my poor little brother did  - we shared my bedroom and after I got moved to the couch, he had to share the bed with Mom (thankfully it was a queen but still!) till his preteen years.   And thinking back... she was extremely defensive about all this. If my brother or I echoed any of the questions or ""ew""s from our friends about it she'd hush us up by tell us this was perfectly normal, it's just that not everybody does it.  >_>"

raisedbynarcissists,3dypco,ThisEpiphany,4,Tue Jul 21 01:19:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, my nmom is a hoarder of all things informational, so magazines from the 80's that have info she really wants to read (because it's soooo timely), junk mail from years ago because a bill was mixed in and she needs to find it to pay it (sorry mom, that ship has sailed), quilting books that have one picture of one quilt she plans to make soon (she bought all the fabric, but hoarded it so...no quilt yet), print-outs of joke emails sent to her so she can sit and read them to keep her from being depressed (the last time I saw the pile, it was about 2 packs of paper high--such funny, let me tell you), random pamphlets and brochures from random places she has visited because you never know when you'll need that random historical fact from the random plantation in the random state, and the list goes on.  When I was young, like in elementary school, she became a screamer who screamed at me for every little thing. That's when her paper hoarding kicked in, too. She'd make these piles, like she was making forts of information, and they'd be a mish-mash of whatever had come in the mail the last month, combined with the random crap from above.  We also had a cat who loved to get on the counters (you can see where this is going). That blasted cat loved to also sit on the piles. She'd sit, everything would slide, my nmom would scream, I'd hide in my room.  Once I reached middle school and puberty, I got fed up with the screaming and started to scream back. Then I became conniving and began to knock the piles over and blame the blasted cat.  Eventually I grew up and tried to help by throwing out old papers. My mom would cry and go digging into the trash, weeping over all the information she had lost. My god, she would never be able to read that magazine that was older than I. She would never glean that lost nugget of random wisdom that she couldn't tell you exactly what it was but by god, she KNEW it was there and now it's gonnnnnnne.  Eventually I grew up even more and moved out. and stopped trying to help her de-hoard. She now sad-sacks to her friends and guilts them into helping her.

I'm angry that is never gets better, I cleaned that basement with natures miracle, a friggin' tooth brush and sponge, not three weeks later it was undone... COMPLETELY. I'm angry about the rosey white washing that happens when she reminisces about objects and events. I'm angry about her attempt to guilt me or force my attachment to objects I want to chuck or that I threw away years ago. Now she has to move (So now this is a timed mission...great!) and everything once again, has immense sentimental or potential garage sale value, so things are still not being tossed. Everything now has the added steps of reminiscing, being chosen as ""save"", put into a new pile for being cleaned, then sold.

I just learned how to shove the stuff away, but she would inevitably get into it and rip it all apart again screaming and beating me saying I was trying to break her stuff. My things on the other hand? If it didn't fit neatly into her choice of space and wasn't completely up to her standards, she'd take it and then beat me. I would have been able to keep up except for the fact that after her room became a hoarders nest she moved into mine and all my stuff was moved to a single shelf in the spare room (also hoarders den) and I just didn't have the space.

raisedbynarcissists,3dzm7w,Hermione-Danger,5,Mon Jul 20 22:41:13 2015 UTC,I decided I wanted to get baptised when I was 10 (still not really sure what that phase was about).

raisedbynarcissists,3dzm7w,craftsy,3,Mon Jul 20 23:53:03 2015 UTC,"I would beg my dad to attend me birthdays or a holiday just for a while, but he always demanded his wife (my abusive stepmother, alcoholic and hated me) must be there too and I have to make her feel comfortable and do what makes them comfortable. I held a hard line of no she's not allowed (after abuse, I wanted no more of her), and so he would lecture me on how selfish and horrible I was as a daughter and why was I ruining my birthday and upsetting them. I would cry and he would say stop crying, you're doing this to yourself and you're wrong. Your lucky I love you enough to bother calling/texting. That hurt and was repeated often as birthdays or holidays came up. Eventually I stopped wishing he would be there and went NC for two years. The NC helped me a lot to heal, learn about and create boundaries and I was able to approach him and get a healthier limited relationship. I can't expect more than he's capable of, he's not right. My stepmom I actually have less problems with than him, and we can spend two hours or more together and be fine (she is like six months sober). I only see them twice a year, for a few days and we make it work by keeping the boundaries of not ever discussing the past or allowing abuse anymore. If he slips back into manipulation or he's not right I walk away.   Edit: TBH, holidays and events where I never have family around usually do bother me a lot. I get stressed at the though of a birthday party and haven't had one my entire adult life, I get taken out to dinner, some gifts and that's it. No cake or family. Just my husband usually. It took me a long time to accept gifts from my dad (it's usually not much) but I kept thinking he would demand I do X bc he gave me Y.

When she gaslights me and talks about what a crazy horrible person I am and always was even as a child, all of these achievements are conveniently erased. When I graduated from my charter school neither NMOM or Ndad were interested in going to my graduation ceremony. MOther made it seem like a pointless waste of time. A woman who checks people into school actually tried to convince me that I should let my parents come.

To be fair I was born in December but my siblings (younger) never had parties either and they were born in non-holiday seasons.  I feel super weird and uncomfortable when people give me gifts or anything really, go out of their way to do something or be nice even though I do those things for others all the time. I think it stems from the instinct of wondering what the 'trade' is or what I'm being buttered up for.  I'm M/28, have a career, live in a different state. All my mom does is give ""advice"" (and her life turned out horrible so I definitely should make decisions how she would) and talks at me like I don't know anything about anything. When I point stuff like that out to her, she picks up where she left off with her previous sentence like I hadn't said anything.

My co-workers wanted to throw me a baby shower, my friends wanted to throw me a baby shower and I adamantly refused because the mere thought of receiving gifts from so many people just gave me mega anxiety. Same thing with my bridal shower but with the added pregnancy hormones it was too much. I did one baby shower at work but was able to talk my friends out of throwing me one. Thank God.   My mom is a total NPD and always held her ""generosity"" and ""kindness"" over my head. She gave me ""everything"" and how could I betray her by say hand delivering her an invitation to my college graduation instead of mailing her one - because I should have KNOWN that mailing it was better than hand delivering it. Or because I waited a day to tell her that my then boyfriend had proposed to me she refused to go out and celebrate with us and his parents.

If she isn't going to give you your ID, she isn't feeding you, you aren't living with her, you owe her absolutely nothing and you don't need to speak to her. If she doesn't agree to give you your ID, do not respond to her messages at all. You might consider getting a tracphone for your real calls and your old phone for her to leave threatening messages on and then just eventually let your contract expire.   I know you have probably tried this, but you can get your papers yourself? I don't know where you are, but where I live you can say you misplaced your ID and buy a new one from the DMV. Social Security will replace your card for free I think.   Try social workers or staff workers of the shelter you are staying at. Ask around. Tell people that you are trying to get a new ID, and be really vocal about needing help.   Where do you live? There are different laws based on your location.

raisedbynarcissists,3dxzqj,frisianks,3,Mon Jul 20 14:34:59 2015 UTC,"No matter what kind of father he was, you had a right to know what had happened to him as soon as it happened.    Well, here's the rub. I unfortunately have way too much experience with people going missing and presumed to have committed suicide.  IF the person is well loved, and connected with society, they might be ""missed"" quite quickly. My husband or I, for example, couldn't go missing for more than 9 hours before someone started hunting. The next thing that happens is a flurry of text messages to people who might know their whereabouts. Next comes calling the cops and hospitals, and potentially someone will emerge as a search leader.   After a couple of weeks, though....  there is no news and everything goes into limbo. Even if a body is found, the word might not get around. At some point, someone might decide to do a memorial service with or without a body.  HOWEVER if a person is living in disorder, none of this happens. Someone swings by their house and notices the home appears abandoned. Then two weeks later, they ask someone, ""Did John move? Because I went by his house and it looks abandoned.""  Maybe someone will care enough to try to track down John's last whereabouts, but it might be several months after he was last seen. And then, people might assume he's homeless rather than dead. It's this scenario that leads to low-quality rumors - ""Heard he went to Costa Rica"" ""Heard he was living on the streets"" ""Heard he died"". If that's the case, there might not be a memorial service, no organized search, no calling of hospitals, and no missing persons reports. We ""lost"" a loved one this way; not an abusive person, someone with bad depression. He went missing and we had no leads on him. We all assumed he had died with no ID and had become a John Doe. He DID eventually turn up in a nursing home, 10 years after anyone who ""knew"" him had last seen him."

Even if she were mentally healthy and learned in a timely manner, I don't think there is any good way to handle it. He abused her, too, right? If she heard he's been missing for 24 hours, what should she have done? Mobilized her teens to search for their abuser? No, right?  Maybe NOBODY was searching for this guy because nobody wants him back. That's sad but definitely his own doing.  And when does he get declared dead? Not a month. Six months?

In the dark she looks like a cleaned up Alice Cooper."

raisedbynarcissists,3dz5o9,cronusprime,6,Tue Jul 21 00:56:23 2015 UTC,My NGran had a facelift. My father jokes that it makes her glaring more efficient because all of her grandmotherly wrinkles are now gone.  She also had work done on her hands and grew out her hair. She doesn't look her age at all. The plastic surgery wasn't bad - she just doesn't look like a grandmother which is perfect because she doesn't act like a grandmother.

I studied mortuary science years ago and have referenced it similarly since this new face came about -- only, I have wondered how the face will look at rest. This is such weird crap to be thinking about one's own mother but I'm glad for the distraction of it.  I totally love your comment, and it made me laugh out loud. THANK YOU."

raisedbynarcissists,3e05dq,Fools_Gold5,9,Mon Jul 20 22:57:50 2015 UTC,"That sounds a lot like me! In high school I really wanted to color my hair red. I was 17, had a job, my own money, and picked up a box while we were in the store one day. My nmom saw it and asked what the hell I thought I was doing, and I told her I was going to color my hair as it is my hair and my money she had no say in the matter. Sounds good right? Boy was I wrong! She threw a HUGE bitch fit in the store, marched me over to the shelf to put it back, then made me tell her husband (my drunk, pedophile stepfather) what I had said, and how I had disrespected her. I hemmed and hawed and let her scream, and it took me years to overcome my fear of changing my hair again.   I went NC 5 years ago, and last year I started wanting to play around with my hair again. I started with a single blue streak in the front of my head, then I dyed it red like I had always wanted too, as it was growing out I started adding purple streaks to the red (I'm naturally a VERY dark almost black brunette.) Then my stylist (whom I'm friends with on facebook) posted a video from a site called Hair Addiction of stylist Guy Tang doing a Blue Green Mermaid melt that I absolutely fell in LOVE with! I asked my hubby (I still feel the need to ask permission to do things, but I'm getting better at it) if I could do it and I did and it turned out GREAT!"

raisedbynarcissists,3e05dq,Cancelmysubscription,2,Tue Jul 21 06:19:50 2015 UTC,Thank you. I'm quite happy with it myself. :)
raisedbynarcissists,3e05dq,Gracefulism,5,Tue Jul 21 07:07:15 2015 UTC,"Do it, green hair rocks. Maybe with pink highlights, really piss her off."
raisedbynarcissists,3e05dq,BeanieBooty,3,Tue Jul 21 04:02:00 2015 UTC,"OK I got expierencies with odd colours and nrents. My N, the church crazed ""you are to be perfect and make me look good"" type (seems close enough to your nmom), almost had an aneurysm when I first dyed my hair purple. Start with blonde, friend. It's probably the only thing that won't piss off that type of n. Then you can claim that you were using box dye to go back to brown/whatever, but it turned green.  Also, one cotton candy hair to another, you should totally try the pravana line. It conditions hair as well as dyes it and my ma swears by it. Plus the green they have fades so beautifully."
raisedbynarcissists,3e05dq,undead_ramen,2,Tue Jul 21 00:24:27 2015 UTC,Thanks I'll check it out
raisedbynarcissists,3e05dq,Celera314,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:57:46 2015 UTC,"Ok first, don't feel bad about not 'standing up for what you believe in'. It didn't hurt anyone, you weren't making a public stance, and you have to do what you have to do to survive. When it comes down to push or shove, and you have to really stand for something, I'm sure you'll do the right thing, but to worry about adapting vs. being outspoken right this second is unnecessary. Pick your battles.   I love crazy colored hair too! I've been sitting on this bright freaking red hair dye for a couple months and I'm staring at it as I type this. I think tomorrow will finally be the day lol.  I'm torn on the green, though. I do like the turquoises and shades of sea foam green, and some shades look better on certain skin tones. Whatever, I am excited for you.  Do you think it would be easier if you just did your tips and gradually dyed more and more as days go by?"
raisedbynarcissists,3dypj0,gettingthekidout,12,Mon Jul 20 16:48:21 2015 UTC,"Ugh... the Ndad completely brainwashed the GC brother, by making him think the abuse he was doing to the other one is ""fine"".  Either that or he lies through his teeth that he thinks he abuse is ""fine"" to kiss Ndad's ass (even if Ndad is not present because he may find out) because he fears that the minute he agrees / admits it's wrong, he would get abused too. So, one of the two.  I don't know what will happen to the GC brother now. I've heard cases where the SG child either runs away from home or its taken by other relatives and when the Nparent realises the SG isn't leaving temporarily, starts abusing GC instead because someone must be the receiver of all the Nparent's rages, insecurities, and failures.  Other Nparents simply pretend the SG never existed and keep treating the GC as before. Seriously, keep trying to making him understand Ndad did something wrong and it's the reason he doesn't have his brother anymore.  Have you tried ask him something like: ""If someone told you you deserved to be hit, screamed at, abandoned, not fed, etc. how would that make you feel?"" When he answers that it would make him feel bad, unloved, etc., you answer: ""Well, that's how your brother feels."" If Ndad has considered that question already, he would answer something like: ""It's different"" or ""Daddy said it's not the same."" Let's hope not."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypj0,soulblazer90,6,Mon Jul 20 17:17:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Thank you. I haven't had a chance to talk to him alone at this point - Kiddo wanted to spend every minute possible with him. But I think you're right; even just to protect my own kid, but also to protect him, I've got to find a way to have this conversation with GC brother.  So far Ndad has not made good on his threats to file against us in court - I think he knows he'd be outgunned, financially and legally, and that's good. I truly do not expect Kiddo to have to go back to Ndad's house, ever, so we are going to make a sincere effort to invite GC brother to spend time with us whenever possible. So hopefully I'll be able to get a better idea of where this stuff is coming from, and how to help GC. Kiddo did ask him yesterday if Ndad has been screaming at/hitting him, and he said no, so that's something."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypj0,soulblazer90,6,Mon Jul 20 18:01:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, do that. I was very ill-behaved at age 4 (a classmate even told me I bullied her, that I would kick whatever she was building with blocks... I have no memories of this, though; it was such an early age anyway).  What I do remember from that age was that my mom was very emotionally abusive and I thought it must happen in every home (I mean, everyone gets angry, right?), but then I was invited to play to a kid's house and nobody was screaming, then I started to wonder if stuff at home was normal. My dad and my aunt explained mom was like that because she was mentally ill. I think I wouldn't have been such a little shit to my classmates if they would have explained it sooner. Go talk."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypj0,undead_ramen,10,Mon Jul 20 19:28:15 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible that ndad is drilling this into GC, as he knows Kiddo leaving is just the beginning of his problems. He must be aware he is under scrutiny and more action will be taken. If you are on good terms with GC's bio mom, you might disclose this information, and perhaps offer a counseling session along side SG with his own counselor, at the least advise her of this new mindset and advise her to get him counseling, in the unlikely event HE starts being abused, and sucked into that ""I deserved it"" mentality.  Glad to see progress for you guys, hope it continues! Please keep us updated, so glad things are beginning to turn around for you all!"
raisedbynarcissists,3dypj0,frettingranddaughter,9,Mon Jul 20 19:23:52 2015 UTC,I hope the GCs mom understand that's the child's dad is capable of physical abuse. A kid from go to the GC to a SG pretty quickly.  It sounds like your outing for the kids was good for them both. Kudos to you for being the bigger person.
raisedbynarcissists,3dypj0,Easier_Still,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:38:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she does. She is aware of the whole situation after we talked this weekend. The CPS social worker hasn't contacted her yet, but the social worker is going to interview both GC brother and his mom at some point. GC brother is also having some behavioral issues, probably at least tangentially related to the situation at Ndad's house, and just started counseling. That news made me feel better about things, a little."
raisedbynarcissists,3dypj0,monster-maker,7,Tue Jul 21 17:47:26 2015 UTC,"It seems clear that a nine year old would have had this idea about Kiddo ""deserving"" the abuse drilled into him by Ndad.  However, it occurred to me there could also be a survival/fear strategy at play: I am good so I don't get hit: Kiddo gets hit because he is bad: therefore I am safe and have nothing to fear from the Big Scary Man.  The scenario with Ndad is not good for GC either way, because he can't be himself without fear of retribution, whether he stays GC or the game changes and he becomes SG. He cannot identify abuse because it has been ""normalized"" for him. It is excellent that you plan to include him in your life, reflecting and modeling reality, love, and respectful relating."
raisedbynarcissists,3e19et,FreeThrowAway0711,4,Tue Jul 21 04:33:57 2015 UTC,"ON the surface it sounded like you needed to call an ambulance before driving over. ""so much blood""  Unless you are a medical professional, hearing that, even second hand would freak me out enough to call emergency services before getting my jacket. Having an ambulance show up, and possibly detain her for eval for attempted suicide, over 48-72 hours whatever length of time they do it for in your area, might make her cut the drama out."
raisedbynarcissists,3e19et,undead_ramen,2,Tue Jul 21 06:24:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that sounds like a classic toxic ""Let's see what I need to do to get everyone to pay attention to me!"" move. I'm sorry you got dragged into it, and I hope you can get some rest."
raisedbynarcissists,3e19et,PurpleNovember,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:37:47 2015 UTC,"You let yourself be dragged into a situation you didn't need to be involved with.  Your mom called your brother.  He should have been the one to go over or call 911.  That message about so much blood was designed to create drama.  Next time tell the llama no, we aren't having any drama, and call the cops or 911.  Your mom got the attention she craved at your expense.  I'm sorry you had to put up with her bullshit."
