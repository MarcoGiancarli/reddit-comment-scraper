gonenatural,372a6c,downboatacc1,2,Mon May 25 01:19:44 2015 UTC,Looks like you're wearing eyeliner on your bottom waterline/lashline.
gonenatural,372a6c,downboatacc1,1 point,Mon May 25 02:01:38 2015 UTC,"I was waiting for this to come up haha.  I swear on my mother's life that I wasn't. I can even take another close up pic if you want. Whenever my eyes scrunch up when I smile, it makes my bottom lashes, which are black lol, clump up together and make me look like I'm wearing eyeliner. I don't blame you though for not believing me though. People even assumed this when I was a little kid and they used to chastise my mother for allowing me to wear makeup at such a young age, when I was in fact wasn't."
