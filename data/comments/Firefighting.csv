Firefighting,3e5iey,AbsolvedJordan,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:53:55 2015 UTC,"My department uses 1.5 at 150 psi and 150 gpm.  It took a little bit of time to get the hang of the weight of the hose and the nozzle reaction.  I personally like to pin the nozzle in between my bicep and my lat and lean into it with a very wide stance.  Grip strength is a really big part of it but you need to try to distribute the force being applied to you as much as possible.  No one part of the body can really handle that kind of pressure adequately for an extended period of time before fatigue sets in.  If it's a defensive stance I take a different approach,  sort of like the position in the video where he has his knee on the hose.  I'll stand with the same wide stance I do when I normally flow it, except I'll stand on the hose with my back foot directly on the hose.  In that position I don't have to stop to get my strength back and can flow until someone tells me to stop.    The most important thing I learned when I was being taught how to handle the hose was identifying my own strengths and seeing how I could apply them.  I'm 6 ft 180 pounds so I had to learn to use the stronger parts to compensate for the weaker parts.    TL:DR Practice son."

Anyway...  Like anything else, it takes practice. If over the shoulder isn't working so well for you (with 1.5""), try bringing it under your arm, and let it rest up against your chest, have the nozzle about a 2 or so feet outward, and try and let the rest of the hose hold just left of your knee.  You can almost kink the hose at your chest so that your chest is taking the push back from the pressure.   Reading that, it's really hard to picture in my head. That Tanaka grip is pretty much spot on though.  If you're on a veg fire, over the shoulder is the way to go, but I've never tried that with anything but a 1.5""."

And you can get even more specific. Maybe they fell off the toilet and hit their head on the corner of the counter and are bleeding severely.   Similarly, there's different types of ""Chest pains"" that require different responses and transports. Chest pains with nothing showing on the monitor and a history of angina? Code 1.

As a firefighter and someone who owns a small recreational drone I would prefer that firefighters be left alone while at a fire scene just like we ask public on the ground to do.  I don't like over restrictive rules on drone operations, but where Public Safety officials are operating I think it's better to give a wide clearance.  There was another video I saw on Youtube of a drone interfering with News helicopters.  It got to within a couple yards of one of them and could have caused issues if they collided.  This is an issue for both sides to work on.  Recreational drone pilots often do not know the laws and may not even know where to look to find the laws or no-fly zone restrictions.  The government entities also need to keep from over using these no fly zones as well.    It's a new technology that will be used for good and bad in the years to come."

A high BP isn't unusual even though you're just walking since you're carrying a large amount of weight between your gear and SCBA and your body is trying to cool itself. That being said it can't hurt to go running once in a while to keep a steady heart rate.  As /u/hicklebug states as well, the air thing is a largely mental, you aren't totally used to the idea of contained breathing as well as having a form fitting mask over your face. Your mind unconsciously panics at the new sensations and your start breathing harder and faster. Since you're just walking it's easier IMO to let your mind focus on breath control and to get that down. Hum, talk to yourself, sing a song, anything to get you to focus on how fast you're breathing and eventually your mind won't associate the sensations with panic"

In addition, take some time and get used to the feeling of being masked up and on air. Train more with it. Get comfortable with it. When your geared, packed, and masked up on air your body will work harder. Its extra weight. Biggest thing I can say is just try some different breathing techniques and get used to the pack/weight/restrictions.

Even when charged itll be in use for 5 minutes max then dies. Thats the only thing I dont like about the new technology, sure its great. But we need to know how to go back to the basics if it fails us. (Also, for those engineers that want to improve things for the fire service... Batterys.

Firefighting,3dtd33,deansep,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:07:05 2015 UTC,"I was initially taught skip breathing as well when I came into the fire service. When I went through Smoke Diver they did everything they could to remove that from our toolbox.   This is what we were explained -  Why do you breathe? Your respiration is not based on inhaling oxygen but instead on expelling carbon dioxide. What happens if you skip breathe? You are not expelling carbon dioxide at enough of a rate which is causing a buildup in your system. Skip breathing will work - for a short period of time. After that period of time, your body realizes that you have too much carbon dioxide in your system and, ultimately, you will end up huffing and puffing until you have expelled enough carbon dioxide.  This made sense to me and I was taught more effective ways to regulate and control my breathing."
Firefighting,3dtd33,SmokeDiver189,2,Mon Jul 20 03:03:31 2015 UTC,Getting in better shape will help. Stairmaster and stairmaster with weighted vest is the best you will find. besides that just getting comfortable being on air will help. you will learn to control you breathing better  like others have said this is just a trial. dont be discouraged just keep on at it and youll be fine. Mask confidence course is where some people will decide whether or not this job is for them.
Firefighting,3dtd33,MRDEUCE,2,Sun Jul 19 15:55:15 2015 UTC,"Not unusual to freak out a bit your first time on air, regulated breathing is entirely new to you. Once you go on air a few more times, it becomes automatic, and you can really learn how to stretch a bottle. Check your mask for leaks too, those will drain your air right out."

Firefighting,3drchn,Kidrobot727,-4,Sat Jul 18 21:43:14 2015 UTC,he isn't so much making a purchase point as he is diminishing the lateral strength of that part of the door. That way it is easier for him to get a purchase point on the door with the halligan.

Firefighting,3drchn,PM_ME_YOUR_KALE,2,Sun Jul 19 03:05:33 2015 UTC,"As others have said he was creating a spot to make a purchase in the door. Outward opening doors often have very tight jams and if you are by yourself you don't have anybody to hit you in with an ax. That segment is an excellent example of the usefulness of a halligan and halligan hook (what they're called here, alternatively the roof hook) when by yourself.  Also worth noting in the beginning when they show 2 guys using a halligan hook to leverage a halligan. If there are 2 of you somewhere there should probably be 2 halligans and 2 hooks (each roof/OV FF carries 1 of each). An easier option is joining the halligans at the forks and getting the added leverage that way. It'll stay together a lot easier."

Crews are having difficult time gaining access to the body of the fire due to a multitude of abandoned vehicles. There are active helicopter drops being used to try to reduce the vehicle to vehicle spread. The initial estimates are that around 80 vehicles have been abandoned on the highway. Crews are having to lay a significant amount of hose down the freeway to try get water on the fire.

Police are constanly patroling and doing work from inside their car. Firefighters only work when called or if they're training. You cant expect a fireman to stay up 24 hours straight waiting for a call, and then perform their job at 100%. Does that answer your question?"
Firefighting,3dh31k,Scottm143,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:43:54 2015 UTC,"Right, but why can't one team stay in the firehouse for 12 hours, then go home and another team comes in for 12 hours and stays during the night? isn't that what the police do?"
Firefighting,3dh31k,KarnaughAtlas,7,Thu Jul 16 07:03:04 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make a whole lot of sense. A police officer needs to be out patrolling to do her job - being visible and ""looking for trouble"" is a huge part of policing. Police also try to be preemptive wherever possible and stop crimes before they start, for example by making contact with a suspicious person, that person may get spooked and decide not to commit whatever crime they had intended.  Firefighters, on the other hand, are entirely reactionary workers. Short of public education (which is part of a firefighters job), we can't stop a fire or a car crash before it starts. Therefore it's a waste of resources to have firefighters driving the firetruck around looking for fires, and there isn't really a need for the firefighters to be awake at night - they can respond almost as quickly when they're asleep vs. when they're awake and doing work at the station. Some people gripe that firefighters are 'paid to sleep', but essentially they are being paid to be at the firehouse and be on call.  Hope that helps!"

Firefighting,3dh31k,_SilkyJohnson,5,Thu Jul 16 06:10:38 2015 UTC,I think you don't understand what everyone is saying. I'll use my dept for instance. We currently have 3 groups that work 24 hrs on duty followed by 48 hrs off duty. So from 7am-7am the next day. I'm on a truck that does about 3500 calls year. My job is to preform life saving emergency medical care on sick patients and also pump and fight car fires and building fires as well as hazardous materials and technical rescues. We stay at the ready for the whole 24 hr shift. At night from the hours of 10pm-6am we are allowed to sleep should a call for help not come in. The reason we are allowed to sleep is because realistically speaking absolutely nobody wants a guy coming to their house saving their dying kid or husband after being up for 23hrs straight. Your body breaks down mentally and physically when exhausted should you not have proper rest. So after doing 10 calls before 10pm your body is overrun and when you lack sleep your judgement is completely off.   The police in my city work a 10hr shift. They constantly patrol the area and they creates a presence. When they are out it deters people from committing crime. At night crime spikes because criminals have the cover of darkness. Cops don't typically work shifts longer than 13-14hrs so their bodies aren't broken down like a firefighter.  ....shortest answer... cops can't sleep on the job because they couldn't pass the firefighter exam to get hired.

The less of these we can do, the more efficient we are. With a 12 hr shift, time spent training or working out would be decreased for many departments.  Some incidences last for over 12 hours but are easily handled within the span of a 24 hr shift."
Firefighting,3dh31k,Kills4pie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:53:28 2015 UTC,"The idea behind guys working longer shifts is multi-faceted. Longer shifts mean you can cram more hours worked into a shift, which means more days off. More time off means crewies have more time to enjoy their lives, which really improves morale. Like other people have said, police perform much of their duty through physical presence - when done properly, patrolling deters crime. Firies cannot operate the same way; the majority of the job is response oriented rather than mitigatory, and relies on personnel being able to operate at maximum efficiency. In stations that have higher callout rates, crew members are also generally able to rotate between roles, so that most are reasonably rested should an emergency occur.  It's a great job, and one of the driving factors behind that is the hours worked. If you try to change that to an 8 or 12 hour rotation, it would mean more fatigue, more time on the floor to brew over jobs, job dissatisfaction, irritability, and generally lowered morale. I wouldn't want someone in that mind frame saving my life in a time-critical situation, would you?"

Trust me, we wouldn't be allowed to sleep if we weren't able to meet the 90sec response standard."

Firefighting,3dh31k,thraway128,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:46:32 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Others have spoken to that, so I won't bother except to say that I would love to have a 24hr shift, and I don't think you'll find a department in the world where the guys would want to give it up I they do have it."
Firefighting,3dh31k,sawff,3,Sun Jul 19 19:21:01 2015 UTC,"To add to what the other commenters have said, part of it is that fires are very unpredictable. With policing, they can normally predict quite accurately how many police they will need for a given time of the day, and adjust that if they know that they may need more because of say, civil unrest, a large football game, historically busy times. Fires are for the most part a little different. A fire chief can't accurately look at next Thursday and say that he will need X amount of firemen, he has no real way of predicting if a big fire will happen that night. So in the fire service, the model is that you have small teams of firefighters stationed within a certain time/distance of the population/infrastructure you are tasked with protecting, they are there in case a fire happens. By this model, if there are no fires, then the firefighters have nothing productive to do at 3am. Training would be counterproductive and disturb local residents, fire safety is impossible as the public are asleep, most of the preparation and maintenance work that firefighters do can be completed during the day shift. So, frustratingly for people who don't like that sort of thing, the fireman can sleep on duty. The problem is, if you reduce the amount of firefighters and a fire does happen then No.1 people generally get hurt or die. No.2 firefighters have to take more risks with less protection so they are more likely to get hurt or die. No.3 the firefighters have to travel further to get to the fire, hence the fire is bigger so needs exponentially more firefighters to deal with it, plus the people are exponentially more dead. No.4 due to the longer travel times and inadequate resources, more property and life is lost.  - tldr Unlike the police - there's nothing more productive they can be doing."
Firefighting,3dh31k,thraway128,2,Thu Jul 16 13:09:13 2015 UTC,"Firefighters get overtime after working 53 hours a week.   It's cheaper for cities to run three shifts working 24 hour tours than it is to run a 10/14 (which requires four shifts, which is an extra 33% more employees).   I suppose you could run 12 hour shifts with three shifts of firefighters, but you'll have a retention issue when everyone leaves to work in a city where you don't have to work every third twelve hour shift."
Firefighting,3dh31k,PM_ME_YOUR_KALE,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:28:15 2015 UTC,Where do you work? We just have Kelly days to balance the overtime.
Firefighting,3dh31k,Tactineck,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:37:12 2015 UTC,"I work in the USA (yes, I'm being deliberately evasive).   Could you explain that ""balance the overtime"" thing a bit? I'm not quite understanding it, and it sounds interesting. You guys work 10s and 14s with Kelly days?"
Firefighting,3dh31k,Tactineck,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:03:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a volunteer, but our paid guys work 24on-48off. That adds up to over 40 hours a week, so every 5th shift they get the day off without using PTO - called a kelly day.   This explains it better than I could:   http://community.bmscentral.com/learnss/ZC/c3tf24-2"
Firefighting,3dh31k,anonbackseater,2,Sat Jul 18 02:26:28 2015 UTC,"In theory cops could do the same, but a large part of policing style (at least in the US) is to be visible and proactive. Because firefighting is reactionary we don't need to be out patrolling. Sitting at a station with couches and beds means you can get away with longer shifts. Most people prefer the 24 hour shifts and for the employer it's good because you cover the same # of spots with less employees (less benefit/pension costs). 24s instead of 12 or 8 hour shifts means only 1 shift change per day (instead of 2 or 3) which also decreases OT when there are late calls."
Firefighting,3dh31k,HazMattCobra,2,Thu Jul 16 17:57:25 2015 UTC,"There's good answers in this thread, but they all get too specific.   Think of it this way, what is more common, crime, or fires?  If fires were as common as crime was, you'd see fire trucks patrolling as much as you do police officers. Fires still require an extremely quick response, so the trucks are staffed 24/7, just not out."
