combinedgifs,3dziw2,CoolGuySean,6,Mon Jul 20 21:31:32 2015 UTC,It consumed my entire Saturday and I have no problem with that. I haven't screamed out of excitement like that since I first played Burnout3.  My roommate was playing it and showed it to me and we switched off for a few hours all day until I decided to just buy it for myself. It has 4-player split-screen and goes people on PS4's and PC's can play against eachother. This game is so chaotic yet skill-based. I can go on for a while.

Given the fuzziness of that label (statistically), and the fuzziness of the belief they're credited with (""celebrity worship is good, no wait it's bad"" vs. shifting in more subtle ways depending on the type of article--e.g. something about where they shopped or ate, vs. a selfie with a redditor)... really there's not much positive to say about redditors, but maybe you can understand why I think it's debatable to ascribe some static belief to them and then say it's hypocritical that the bell curve moves."

It's not just /r/mensrights. There's also ""A voice for men"" which is a shit show run by an awful human being (some controversy can be found here). Then there's everything Roosh touches which is awful (here for some of his shittyness). Then you get to less popular ones which while not all of them are awful, many of them disgust me at a basic level with their denigration of women and their experiences.  What I'm getting at is that only having issues with the mensrights subreddit on reddit is a mistake. These are the people that represent the movement when it's brought up in conversation and dismissed because it should be dismissed in its current form. The whole movement is being pioneered by people that no one should listen to so we can get an actual movement going on that isn't based on feelings of superiority and disdain."

Sometimes misogyny works its way into the comments. However the actual community seems to recognize that this is an issue, and I've seen lots of the ""don't trust women"" or similar comments with replies pointing out that it is not an anti-woman sub. All in all, it looks like the community tries to be respectful, but gets a bad wrap from the vocal minority.

I could easily use a hashtag and write some bullshit to make someone look bad too, or this could simply be the act of one or a few misguided people.  Did anything ever happen?  Did any of the people named here actually report harassment?  Any reputable media coverage of this supposed doxxing?  As it is I don't see any proof of actual harassment here, just a write up that anyone could have done.  Regardless of whether it's true or not it still doesn't prove that anybody from SRS was actually involved or your claim that SRS was specifically designed to target, harass, and d0xx other Redditors.  Not even close.  Possibly one person doxxing here.  Doesn't come anywhere near to proving what you claimed, that SRS was specifically designed to doxx and harass.  Paranoid baseless accusations.  Somebody PM'd them speculative information about them that wasn't even correct.  They got frightened by the derisive tone and feared they were being doxxed.  There is no proof that they were and the Admins didn't see it either when they looked at it.  A guy said some shitty things to another guy, don't really see how this has anything to do with SRS.  SRS is amused by the hypocrisy reddit shows when they celebrate the doxxing of WBC compared to the horror they felt when pedos were exposed.  SRS is not engaging in or encouraging doxxing here.  Seems the people celebrating the doxxing were not SRS, they were the redditors that SRS was talking about.  This is just a link to a subreddit, and I'm not going to sift through that shit pile of tears trying to discern whatever hearsay they use to rationalize their fear of SRS.   I feel completely justified in ignoring it given that your first 4 links were simply grasping at straws.   You really really want it to be true.

combinedgifs,3c5vtc,EliteAgent51,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:57:46 2015 UTC,I remember when it went on 9gag. Several people claimed that this is not a simple lithium battery (as in THE cell phone battery). They kept saying it is a (Lihtium-) polymer battery and that those are not really being used on the market yet and that there is nothing to worry about.  Does not seem to be much correct though iPhone3GS apparently used one of those. This source  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_polymer_battery#Safety states that several things (also penetration of the battery) can lead to a slight vaporisation of the electrolyte. Slight sounds like this would not be the cause of the battery totally blowing up though.
combinedgifs,3c5vtc,Stonn,3,Sun Jul 5 11:16:47 2015 UTC,"Section 10. Safety of article  Lithium polymer battery:       LiPo cells are affected by the same problems as other lithium-ion cells. This means that overcharge, over-discharge, over-temperature, short circuit, crush and nail penetration may all result in a catastrophic failure, including the pouch rupturing, the electrolyte leaking, and fire.   All Li-ion cells expand at high levels of state of charge (SOC) or over-charge, due to slight vaporisation of the electrolyte. This may result in delamination, and thus bad contact of the internal layers of the cell, which in turn brings diminished reliability and overall cycle life of the cell.  This is very noticeable for LiPos, which can visibly inflate due to lack of a hard case to contain their expansion.  Compared to cylindrical Li-ion cells, LiPos lack integrated safety devices such as a current interrupting device (CID) or a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) material that is able to protect against an over-current or an over-temperature.

combinedgifs,3bmn3n,Keundrum,3,Tue Jun 30 20:35:55 2015 UTC,What's the difference between a gif and video?
combinedgifs,3bmn3n,10J18R1A,7,Tue Jun 30 23:39:14 2015 UTC,"There's a few differences, but the one most people would say is that a video has sound and a gif does not. Why do you ask?"
combinedgifs,3bmn3n,Real_Clever_Username,2,Tue Jun 30 23:59:21 2015 UTC,So not length?
combinedgifs,3bmn3n,10J18R1A,7,Wed Jul 1 00:02:02 2015 UTC,Length is not a defining factor in either. Aren't Vines videos?
combinedgifs,3bmn3n,Real_Clever_Username,4,Wed Jul 1 00:20:49 2015 UTC,Valid inquiry.
combinedgifs,3bmn3n,10J18R1A,3,Wed Jul 1 00:35:14 2015 UTC,"I was gonna answer this with a helpful explanation but I'm finding it difficult.  GIFs are sequences of images, each frame is its own JPEG.  Takes longer to load so people keep them short (I doubt the creator of GIF all those years ago intended for it to be used as a storytelling medium). Videos are processed using codecs so that averages are made (and thus bandwidth is saved) between frames in real time.  When we're watching Bill O'Reilley on the tv, we don't need to see every detail in the gradient of his blue News Room backdrop, especially 'cause it's not moving much.  So the codecs involved with streaming a standard front-facing video of O'Reilley yapping away at his desk will likely compress those blues, making it more of a ""mosaic"" of similar blues to save on space-- but our eyes won't really notice and we won't really care.  Since video processing/streaming technology has this ability to save on bandwidth, they can afford to be longer.  I don't really know what to say about giphy and gyfcat though, I think they might be their own thing."
combinedgifs,3bmn3n,bmacc,2,Wed Jul 1 02:52:01 2015 UTC,"By the way, each frame of GIF isn't encoded using JPEG, they use their own encoding that have a limited color palette and is generally less optimized (it was cutting edge in the 80s though).  Imgur's gifv and gyfcat's gyf is just a regular video, encoded with a regular video codec but without audio. They are used because browsers now have the <video> tag, used to embed videos (images and gifs are embedded with the <img> tag). Before the video tag existed, you would need to use flash, or embed a video player (with play/pause controls and so on), which sucked.  Such videos generally use the VP8 or VP9 codec in the WebM container, but some use H.264 (the same as blu-ray) with the MP4 container. Internet Explorer and Safari normally don't play WebM (unless you install the codec yourself), just H.264. Older versions of Firefox used to be able to play only WebM as a political statement (H.264 is patent-encumbered and all that), but Mozilla lost this battle and now plays both.  And of course older browsers can't play those videos. So both imgur and gyfcat needs to store the GIF and either one or two video versions, to be compatible with most browsers and so on."
combinedgifs,3bmn3n,protestor,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:03:27 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks for elucidating further than I could! So I am starting a website, brianthings.com , and it looks like I'll be wanting embedded looping short sequences. right now I'm using gif. Is there a way to upload my files to giphy and then embed some code, letting them decide when to use gif or webm?"
combinedgifs,3bmn3n,bmacc,2,Mon Jul 6 16:21:40 2015 UTC,"If you mean to use gyfcat, see this. I recommend the third option:   Use our embed code to embed a gfy object automatically. This method will choose video or gif format depending on the users capabilities, and we wrap a lot of other pixie dust around it too (shims for various unusual browser conditions to guarantee everyone gets the best experience).    Basically you insert the code just once, and for every gyf (that can either be a .gif or a video) you insert an <img class=""gfyitem"" data-id=""id-of-your-gif"" />. Here is an example.  (That messy code they used is just because they want to be sure that their own code is inserted before any other <script>, but you can simply include the Javascript directly)  While this has an <img> tag, their code changes the tag to <video> in supported browsers. You can verify this by opening the developer tools (ctrl+shift+i in Firefox and Chrome) and select the video:  <video style=""position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; border: 0px none; padding: 0px; z-index: 25;""               poster=""true"" loop="""" autoplay="""" class=""gfyVid"" height=""360"" width=""640"">   <source class=""mp4source"" type=""video/mp4"" src=""http://zippy.gfycat.com/EveryIllChick.mp4"">   <source class=""webmsource"" type=""video/webm"" src=""http://zippy.gfycat.com/EveryIllChick.webm""> </video>   Note that gyfcat is serving both webms and mp4s - the <video> tag is super cool because it lets you specify many videos, and the browser will pick the one it finds the best. You could just include the <video> tag above, if you didn't bother with browsers that support only gifs (but note that zippy.gyfcat.com is just for videos below 1MB - the Javascript selects the right server).  Also: in my opinion, something that is even better is saving this in your own site, instead of loading Javascript directly from their site (I don't like loading Javascript from CDNs in general). It's possible that they change the code and the old version stop working, though, so you would need to manually update it."
combinedgifs,3bmn3n,protestor,2,Mon Jul 6 16:51:43 2015 UTC,"though my upload file was about 15mb...???...so not sure where they're getting 1.5mb from   it was a 15mb gif or a 15mb video? gifs are absurdly inefficient.  And yes the quality of the gyf looks worse. They compress that much because most of people don't care, and bandwidth cost money! If they made the videos slightly larger overall, they would lose some dollars, and they like their dollars.  I think that you can consider hosting the video yourself. Get the actual source (not this gif: the raw source you converted this gif from.. unless the video is from someone else and you only have the gif) and use something like ffmpeg (that way you even learn to use this cool command line app) to convert the video. So you can perhaps make a 2mb video that beats this gif in quality.  Or, try imgur or something."
combinedgifs,3bmn3n,protestor,2,Tue Jul 7 04:39:50 2015 UTC,"15mb video.  Edited and exported from After Effects with the ""animation"" setting in the quicktime codec.  I don't know why I thought gfycat was black magic, it's a service -- you're right.  Downloading ffmpeg, thank you!"

combinedgifs,3ayk4f,Jeroknite,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:28:20 2015 UTC,if you (or anyone) has a suggestion for where the axe should go after the anchor throws it let me know and i'll try to put it together.
combinedgifs,3ayk4f,Karjalan,14,Thu Jun 25 11:35:47 2015 UTC,But.. Why? Who? Where the fuck did it come from?
combinedgifs,3ayk4f,doubledip10,21,Wed Jun 24 18:49:02 2015 UTC,"Looks like a kid who grew up watching drumline but never had any talent, was jealously watching the marine drummers from afar.  Cleverly entering himself into a near by ax throwing competition he times his beats best he can and flings the ax over the target onto the marines drum. True to form it lands off tempo ruining the song.  We can only pray this gets through to the untalented musician so that he will finally give up his dreams of being a drummer and get  a solid 9-5 so he can support his family.  But really though just looks like an axe went rogue in an ax throwing competition and went over the backboard into the marine.   That is why you don't do activities behind a target of any nature."
combinedgifs,3ayk4f,MattheJ1,19,Wed Jun 24 19:15:45 2015 UTC,"Somehow, it's even better than that:  The person who threw it was Pete Hesgeth, co-host of 'Fox & Friends'. He wasn't actually supposed to be throwing the axe at all, he just thought it might look cool on camera. The version that aired on TV just showed him throwing it way over the target, missing completely, and then the drummer ran out from behind it clutching his arm.  Source  Sometimes these things write themselves."
combinedgifs,3ayk4f,TurnOnTheTV,7,Wed Jun 24 21:58:06 2015 UTC,"Actually this guy is pretty famous in the percussion world.    This is Jeff Prosperie and he is a member of the USMA Westpoint Hellcats, and is extremely talented in his profession.  You can find lots of videos of him on youtube, and a google search will show that he is far from untalented."
combinedgifs,3ayk4f,doubledip10,9,Wed Jun 24 19:55:32 2015 UTC,I was implying the guy throwing the ax was untalented. But sounds like you know your drummers!

combinedgifs,3auati,DeadFreshman,35,Tue Jun 23 16:57:10 2015 UTC,I'm just referring to his stint of movies from like 2000-now. Like insomnia and such. Not the worst films but just not fantastic. He has a great career. One of my favorite movies is heat. Just think he got lazy with roles and went for paychecks once he hit his late 50's to now. I mean Liam Neeson admits to taking movies for the paychecks (see taken 3) all actors do it. I'd just like to see more substance in between sometimes.
combinedgifs,3auati,Pepe_leprawn,26,Tue Jun 23 17:00:45 2015 UTC,"Insomnia was one of the greatest movies he made. Now crap like People I Know, Simone, the Merchant of Venice, Gigli, Righteous Kill, the movie where he and Christopher Walken just looked old as shit...ugh..."
combinedgifs,3auati,madisonrebel,9,Tue Jun 23 17:43:31 2015 UTC,I thought he played a great Shylock...
combinedgifs,3auati,NightClerk,4,Tue Jun 23 18:37:21 2015 UTC,He was a FANTASTIC Shylock. I still watch this epic monologue from time to time just to get the chills intentionally.
combinedgifs,3auati,heymanitsmematthew,4,Wed Jun 24 01:56:22 2015 UTC,I honestly prefer Mel Gibson reading these lines in Man Without A Face. He did an amazing Hamlet as well.

combinedgifs,3auati,Tucker_MalcolmXI,4,Tue Jun 23 21:52:31 2015 UTC,Yeah. The 2004 film sucked. It felt more Hollywood than Shakespeare. 2000's Hamlet with Ethan Hawke was far better.
combinedgifs,3auati,madisonrebel,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:58:33 2015 UTC,"I guess it's just a matter of opinion. I just got very bored of insomnia. It didn't hold my attention.

combinedgifs,3auati,Pepe_leprawn,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:35:01 2015 UTC,"Simone was one of the most original movies I've seen. It was great, and Pacino was great in it."
combinedgifs,3auati,LTS55,12,Wed Jun 24 12:35:56 2015 UTC,He needed the money. There was a profile of him in The New Yorker last fall in which they mention that Pacino's business manager embezzled millions from him and is now in jail.  Pacino took a bunch of crap roles because he was broke.
combinedgifs,3auati,TonytheFish,3,Tue Jun 23 20:06:39 2015 UTC,"I really like Insomnia.  I guess I relate to having insomnia and I liked the actors, I enjoy Robin Williams in dramatic roles for some reason, there's this weird little sense of comfort to it, even when he's a murderer.  Well not in one hour photo, that was uncomfortable as hell.  But his other roles!"
combinedgifs,3auati,KennyFulgencio,3,Tue Jun 23 19:07:59 2015 UTC,I think you meant to say 'Gigli' and 'Jack and Jill.'
combinedgifs,3auati,Gigabeto,2,Tue Jun 23 19:45:24 2015 UTC,Come on Jack and Jill was the shit. Dunk-a-cino? That's absolutely genius because his name is Pacino
combinedgifs,3auati,Achievement_huggers,2,Tue Jun 23 23:38:33 2015 UTC,"Well, Pacino isn't really trying to impress anyone now. I think he enjoys what he does and just wants to keep it up. He probably could demand better roles, but why bother? The paychecks, I'm sure, play a major role. But he isn't hurting to be in the next Best Picture nominee. He's already established himself in a bunch of great roles. Everyone knows he's got the chops. Might as well continue doing what you enjoy and get paid a lot for your name while doing it. Can't blame the guy."

combinedgifs,3auati,FullmetalCowgirl,0,Wed Jun 24 15:48:51 2015 UTC,"I know, I was just talking mostly about Tony Stark and how RDJ can milk that cow for life if he's doing it just for the paychecks.  That way he can still make something else of substance if he so desires. Or he won't, and he'll die making capeshit without ever having to try again : /"

But iorn man doesn't have a cape so he won't do that haha. He has had some good movies in the past few years. I enjoyed the soloist, due date and a few others. I just think he could do some great stuff into his old age and he doesn't need to waste his talent."

It is murky whether it was ""Force Choke"" vs ""force squeezy"" and whether or not the guy died, but to me it looked like a choke, and I don't recall seeing the guard again after. Maybe it's because he was a random-ass sentry and it didn't matter to show he was alive, but I personally like to think Luke kinda lost his shit with the whole Jedi-Sith thing after meeting his father. He got his hand cut off and then jumped to apparent suicide, I think, and then called for rescue after, while holding onto the antenna under the Cloud City for an unknown amount of time."

If for some reason you are in a situation where you absolutely HAVE to touch a wire that may be live (you should never do this it is stupid find someone who knows what they are doing. Idiot.) Always touch it with the back of your hand  so your fingers are not forced closed around the wire and it is easier for someone to hit you away from the live wire with a 2x4.    Muscles contract using electrical signal and your muscles for keeping your hand closed are MUCH stronger than the muscles for keeping them open. When a live current flows through your hand it  becomes literally impossible for you to un-clench your fist.    The more you know*

They're completely different from each other and are pretty closely related in the sense that the scene in the film is sort of a weird reverse version of the sports news clip; with the kid throwing a ball rather than catching a bat. It fits 100% with rule 1 on the sub. I'm confused as to what you and /u/BravoR2 are on about.

There were certain things that it did perfectly, even more so than any other Spider-Man film prior to it, but there were other things that just didn't make sense.

She broke her front leg the first two times, her pelvis the last time, and most likely lost a fuck ton of brain cells every time. She is dumb as a rock.   The reason she's jumped has always been birds. She sees one, climbs over the railing onto the edge of the balcony, goes in total combat mode, and tunes everything out but the bird. It gets closer, and she just jumps for it. Then, once she's flying through the air with no immediate ground below her, she realizes how stupid she is.   It's hard to get cats to snap out of it once they're in the hunting zone. I think they way they were raised also plays a role in their hunting mindset. My cat lived in the wild until she was one year old. She still prefers to drink from dirty puddles outside when her bowl is full and still shits in my tomato plants when her litter box is clean."

combinedgifs,35i8yv,narco113,23,Sun May 10 19:08:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm already skeptical about the involvement of kryptonite due to the method they used to travel through space.  Kryptonite is supposed to be chunks of Krypton, which would take millions of years to reach Earth.  The phantom zone travel they use in the movie makes that a logical impossibility (though logic pretty clearly doesn't matter much... how did he throw that train so fucking accurately if he didn't know how to use his x-ray vision goddammit).  Man of Steel addressed that by giving the natural Kryptonian atmosphere the properties of red kryptonite, so maybe there's some potential there.  Supes is scaled really far back from the comics, which is fine, but that doesn't mean they should just throw Bats into an Iron Man suit and have him be Superman's physical equal.  Not without something to make them actually on scale with one another.  And maybe we're interpreting this scene all wrong.  Might not be a fight scene at all.  Could be that Bats is just a dick, and wants to be extra cautious on his first face-to-face with a ridiculously overpowered alien being.  I think I'll probably hope for that eventuality."

Luthor is pretty famous for his exosuit, so maybe in this continuity, he designed it for Batman instead, or something similar.  Seems really Luthor-ish to me to pit two heroes against each other so he can ultimately triumph.

Batman always carries green kryptonite with him in case Superman goes rogue or comes into contact with red kryptonite, silver kryptonite, or dank space weed laced with space PCP. He also owns Lex Luther's kryptonite ring after it gave Lex cancer because Lex was wearing it 24/7 like it was his precious.  Speaking of Lex, Lex was one of Superman's strongest enemies. You know that rich white guy who's really cunning and doesn't know karate? Hmm nah he can't be anything like Bruce. Lex has parents...  Oh, back on that fancy ass ring Batman has? Batman already beat superman to death with that very ring in an alternate future where Superman turns evil. Yeah, Batman already killed the man of steal. He's just going for round two now."
combinedgifs,35i8yv,Sirfungus,5,Mon May 11 00:57:35 2015 UTC,"My nerd pants are already hiked to my bellybutton, you're good.    There's no kryptonite in this movie universe, not that's been revealed yet, at least.  Bats is going to need another way to nullify Supes if he doesn't want to get crumpled.  Honestly, I'm expecting something like a gas grenade filled with kryptonian atmosphere, which really fucked Supes up in Man of Steel.  Something to bring them onto the same level, exosuit or no.  More than anything, I'm hoping it's not just a really strong suit that lets him overpower Superman.  That would be the lamest conclusion to this.  Bats is all about that guile when it comes to beating Superman, he always uses more than just brawn because he knows he can't beat Superman in straight-up fisticuffs.  That's why Lex is Superman's arch-nemesis, because he's nothing but guile and intellect.  So my hope is that Batman actually acts like Batman, which pretty much means he shouldn't even need the suit in the first place, unless it's a means to another end."
combinedgifs,35i8yv,MrMstislav,4,Mon May 11 01:17:21 2015 UTC,"It think they'll have to reveal kryptonite or something similar. They might find a believable way for Bruce to get enough Krypton air, but that just seems like poor man's kryptonite at this point. If he just fights him with a robot suit I'll be upset though. Just like you said, Batman has always been brain over brawn. Going toe to toe with Superman as an Ironman ripoff would be incredibly disappointing."

The gas was perfect because it wouldnt kill him like an arrow head made of Kryptonite might have. This went through his lungs quick enough not to do any lasting damage, but it took long enough for Batman to kick him around like a soccer ball. I think /u/PunchingBag has the right idea when it comes to how this fight will go down."

This is an older Batman, post Jason's death, right? That means we'd have to get an origin story on Batman, then go all the way through that just to get here.

combinedgifs,35i8yv,PunchingBag,4,Mon May 11 00:37:36 2015 UTC,"Potentially, a good explanation for the Iron Bat suit here is Luthor.  He's in the movie, and does love his exosuits.  Not unreasonable at all to think that Luthor may very well have supplied Bats with the suit, which as someone else around here mentioned, could have kryptonian tech integrated into it.  Supes also is well known for holding back, especially against an unknown enemy that's more than likely his physical inferior, whereas Bats tends to go balls deep.    Even then, just by going off of Man of Steel, that suit better be pretty freaking powerful if he wants to get into a slugging match.  Though personally, I would rather see Bats do something neat and clever while using the suit to buy him enough time to pull it off.  The suit doesn't have to last forever, it just has to last long enough."

combinedgifs,351zkh,tdogg8,3,Wed May 6 18:43:18 2015 UTC,"One that hides level 1 heading text for some reason - maybe to kill these sorts of hashtag comments.    Markdown syntax (used in reddit comments for formatting) says that the hash (#) is used to indicate a heading, like you might use to label a paragraph or list in a long comment.  Subreddit CSS determines how headings look.  Have you ever seen people's attempted hashtags turn into plain words with a dotted line under them?  That's because the default is for headings to appear that way.    Just as an experiment, I'm going to try a few levels of heading in this sub's CSS.    heading1  heading2  heading3  heading4  The only difference is how many hashes are in front of the word.  If I'm right, the first one will not show up at all.    (Of course, this only applies to PC with the subreddit CSS enabled.)"
