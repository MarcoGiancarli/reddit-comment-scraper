A friend of mine has installed ArchLinux and loves it but manages to break it every single time he updates his packages. I don't get how people manage to do all of this. I think the only 2 times a linux installation broke for me was when I tried to use the proprietary AMD driver on a friends' computer and when I was messing with the kernel.

linuxmemes,3dq5qq,joanniso,3,Sat Jul 18 16:46:07 2015 UTC,It's aimed at anyone who loves Arch but keeps breaking it or complains how it's unstable.

From what I see, it's nothing major, and sass is generally voted down, but in threads focused on this type of elitist behavior, dislike for the more popular linux distributions is voted up more.  Maybe I'm wrong, and this pattern is just imaginary, only being isolated events taken together. Either way, it's nothing too major, and should only be taken lightly, if at all."

When you just started with programming, you should definitely focus on that. The quirks of Vim would distract you more than necessary and at the end you will be frustrated and give up learning both.  Even if you already knew, how to program properly, you should first learn to touch-type – of course in the ten-finger-system. If you rehearse daily, it's a question of two or three weeks.  As soon as the syntax of your programming language infiltrated your mind and became your second nature, so that you don't even need to think about it, while you program, and touch-typing became a matter of course, you can finally start to learn Vim. Have fun :)."

I'm not even suprised why big projects like the Linux kernel or systemd are all written in C.   The cool thing about C is it very easy to think about the assembler that will be produced by the compiler (of course it implys that you know assembler in the first place). I'm having difficulty understanding how a C++ compiler works. There are so much concepts that I get lost. Other than that, C++ is bloated. Things like boost are extremely bloated and aren't necessary in my opinion. Vector are nice, though. The concept is very simple that they can be easely written in C.  Here's Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman about C++."
linuxmemes,378qol,travis_zs,1 point,Tue May 26 13:51:21 2015 UTC,"I agree on the reasoning and I do not use boost (anymore). But I do not agree on not using C++ for those reasons.   First of all, you don't need to use all of its ""features"". But because C++ has the std::map, std::vector concepts and the object oriented parts make me use it; I borrow plain C when it's appropriate (aka. when the C++ style of doing things is overly complicated).  And yes, I really get why Linux and systemd are written in C. Those things are pretty critical components, it just makes sense."
linuxmemes,378qol,butlerccreltub,1 point,Tue May 26 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"When C programmers never properly learn object oriented programming.  For the record, Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman don't know everything. There are a lot of substandard C programmers out there as well. Remember Heartbleed? Being skilled in a single language does not make you a skilled developer. You'll also note that Linus's beef isn't actually with C++, but rather the whole object oriented paradigm. His criticisms of OO are from the perspective of someone who never learned it, which is fine given his line of work. He's absolutely correct about why C++/OO are inappropriate for kernel construction, but he's incorrect in his assertion that you can do OO in C. You cannot; this is a simple fact.  As for Richard Stallman, it's very easy to take a shit on pretty much any other language around after learning and working with LISP. But there are reasons why LISP is still a rather esoteric language almost six decades on. Although, you should absolutely learn some dialect of LISP because it will make you a better developer regardless of what language you work in for a living.  As for your assertion that C++ is a bloated language which you then support by citing libraries like the STL and Boost: The STL and Boost are not part of the language; they are libraries implemented in the language. If you're going to tell me there's no such thing as shitty and bloated C libraries, well, there's no possibility of a sane discussion. Yes, C is a ""smaller"" language than C++ in that it has a simpler grammar, but LISP is even ""smaller"", by a significant margin, than C. That does not mean the Linux kernel should be written in LISP, or that LISP is inherently better than C. C++ having a larger, more complex grammar than C doesn't make it ""bloated"". Any practical Turing-complete language has it's idiosyncrasies and pitfalls. You're just comfortable with C's particular set of peculiarities.  Both C and C++ are very good languages if you know how and when to use them. Should the Linux kernel or systemd be written in C++? No, absolutely not. But that has no bearing on how good C++ is as a language since it is an inappropriate tool for those particular jobs. There are plenty of big projects that are written primarily in C++ (KDE, Chrome, large portions of GCC, VLC, Qt). Arguing that C++ is bad because it's bad for kernel construction is a total cop-out. That's like arguing C is a bad language because it's bad for implementing data mining algorithms. Or arguing that PHP is a bad language because—actually, PHP sucks. Now there's a language that actually gets in your way when you're trying to write good code.  The big problem with C++ is a lot of developers never properly learn object oriented programming. OO is not something to simply add on to C. A lot of procedural/imperative developers learn C++ from the perspective of C. That is, they try to graft the object oriented paradigm onto their understanding of the imperative paradigm rather than learn OO in its own right, and often times, that's how they're taught. Not knowing the basic methodology of C++ compilation is a symptom of that."
linuxmemes,378qol,travis_zs,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:10:51 2015 UTC,"C can easily do object oriented programming, C++ just makes it easier. Saying C can't is like saying Lua can't do object oriented programming because they're no classes, only tables. Both of these languages can do object oriented programming, and most (all?) C gui libraries are built in an object oriented way. Saying C++ isn't a bad language is just stupid. Linus might of had a bad argument, but Richard stallman was right, and he didn't need evidence to support it because its obvious. People like C++ because of all the abstractions, which are all really nice to use, but are so badly implemented that it makes me question whether the C++ developers understand what makes an easy to read programming language. In C++, you can overload operators as well as functions, so something that might seem obvious what is does could do something completely different. In C++, a member function that has a function call inside, could be a call to a normal function, a friend function of the class, or a method of the class, and its impossible to know which one is which. In C++, everytime you make a template function/class you have to retype the words template, and retype the words typename or class (which this definition of class has nothing to do with the previous one) which produces incredibly ugly code. In C++, any variable could be the actual value, or could be a reference to that value. Anytime you see a function call, it could be the actual function, or the member of a namespace. I could go on and on, but people still use C++ despite all of this, do to its simpler and easier object orientation. Just because people use it, doesn't mean it's a good, or even an okay language. C++ is bad."

Saying C can't is like saying Lua can't do object oriented programming because they're no classes, only tables. Both of these languages can do object oriented programming, and most (all?) C gui libraries are built in an object oriented way.   No. This is flat out, objectively false. The GUI libraries to which you refer use a very poor imitation of OO. This argument is the result of some bizarre inferiority complex. It would seem C developers are so gung-ho that C could never possibly be an inadequate tool for anything ever, they feel the need to make stuff up. If you would like to counter the assertion that OO is impossible in C, you will need to demonstrate the following in C:   Objects which contain both data members and methods Inheritance or some similar method of code reuse/extension Polymorphism   Note that wrapping some variables in a struct and then passing a pointer as an argument to various functions does not qualify for the first requirement. OO requires that state and functionality be encapsulated in the same object. This method also provides no compiler-enforced mechanism to prevent people from mucking around inside your struct. Further, there is no facility for object construction either through constructor functions or prototyping. Also note that using internal linkage is not the same thing as having private members. And no, you don't get to write these off as not needed for OO. Polymorphism is partially negotiable, but the other two are hard requirements.  Even further, your Lua analogy is way off the mark. Lua is a prototype-based OO language like JavaScript. Lua has explicit facilities to enable OO development. C, very simply, has no such facilities. This is not a matter of opinion. It's a cold, hard fact. Full stop.   [...] but Richard stallman was right, and he didn't need evidence to support it because its obvious.   You're joking right? No? Okay. C++ isn't a bad language at all and I don't need to make my case because it's obvious a COBOL programmer could figure it out.   In C++, you can overload operators as well as functions, so something that might seem obvious what is does could do something completely different.   That's nice. I don't care. You know why? Because people don't go around arbitrarily defining nonsensical operators. This argument is excruciatingly pedantic; yes, it is, strictly speaking, possible, but it does not crop up in practice. If it does, I've got news for you. The idiot who did it would have found a way to make a C library equally as ridiculous. Someone could write a bignum library in C, define an 'add' function, and then implement multiplication in said function. From a notational perspective, operators are nothing more than a different notation for function invocation. There is no language which requires functions to implement the functionality so named as this is mathematically impossible.   In C++, a member function that has a function call inside, could be a call to a normal function, a friend function of the class, or a method of the class, and its impossible to know which one is which.   You've got me there. As a Turing-complete language, functions in C++ can invoke other functions.   In C++, everytime you make a template function/class you have to retype the words template, and retype the words typename or class (which this definition of class has nothing to do with the previous one) which produces incredibly ugly code.   I'm sorry, why do you get to complain about this? C has no facility for compile-time polymorphism whatsoever. As a result, generic programming in C is incredibly ugly and, in general, just not worth doing. If the template notation so offends your aesthetic sensibilities, you are free not to use it.   In C++, any variable could be the actual value, or could be a reference to that value.   Believe it or not, pass-by-reference is directly documented in the function declaration. All you have to do is look. Something you'd be doing in C anyway."
linuxmemes,378qol,travis_zs,2,Thu Jun 18 05:19:32 2015 UTC,"These posts are getting longer and longer, but the first question is easy, just make a struct with function pointers. Before C++ that's what people did to have a weird version of virtual functions.  struct foo {     void (*update)(struct foo *self); };   The only problem with this is you have to give every function yourself, but its still what your asking. Besides, this isn't even necessary for oop, some object oriented lisp libraries are basically made with a alist vector (or many times just a normal alist) that contains values, and functions that are its ""methods"" which accept those values. But those functions aren't in the alist. Inheritance can't be done exactly the same way because inheritance either requires compiler tricks or requires dynamic structures which just don't exist in normal C. All you have to do for inheritance is contain a struct pointer in a struct.  struct foo2 {     struct foo *parent_instance; }   If you want something a little more like C++ inheritance, you could make a macro with all the definitions, and put the macro in any struct that you want to inherit that class. But that really isn't necessary.  #define FOO_MACRO \     int x; \     int y  struct foo { FOO_MACRO; };  struct foo2 {     FOO_MACRO;     int z; };   Polymorphism is the easiest of the three, just use the past function in the current one. There are many other ways to do all of these things I'm just saying the ones that come to my mind. When I talked about C++, I wasn't comparing it to C, I was comparing it to any other language that implemented the same abstractions. C++ implemented templates badly, and implemented member functions and values badly, and implemented pretty much most things badly. And if you think people don't overload operators willy nilly, you obviously haven't seen some of the terrible vector implementations in C++, along with some smart pointers I've seen. I'm not saying don't use C++, I'm just saying arguing that C++ is not a bad and ugly language makes me think that C++ is the only language that you've ever seen any one of these abstractions. Heck, these abstractions have been implemented better in lisp macros. Also, C isn't that good either, its preprocessor sucks quite a bit, and its incredibly unsafe. Just because a language can be used well doesn't mean the language itself is good."

This took like it seemed weeks to fix, and there are many threads on forums with varying amounts of misinformation on how to solve this problem. It also introduced a massive performance hit to Unity who-knows-how that wasn't fixed until 14.04.  13.10 was like, hey bro, 9 months of support. More unity scopes thingies you don't care about, too! That's it. Unremarkable, as I said. Its default kernel wasn't able to shutdown my laptop, just hanged in there, too.   11.10 had unity there. The first version. THIS was the start menu.   Close to the biggest fucking joke of a beta interface I've seen, almost on par with Windows 8 Developer Preview's initial start screen and metro concepts."

I've had a Debian Jessie VM I've been playing with the past few weeks and the interfaces are still eth0,eth1 etc. as opposed to enp0s3, wlp3s0, etc.  I am fond of the syntax for service commands (systemctl start service rather than service service start), but I'd rather that the init system didn't have built in utilities for things like networking (systemd-networkd), logging (systemd-journald), etc. A ""minimal"" version of systemd that only performed core functions would be nice."
linuxmemes,33w45o,LumberCockSucker,2,Mon Apr 27 03:38:05 2015 UTC,"Is that not systemd that changed the interface names?

Here's the server I run at home I think it goes enp(random number)s(0 for onboard NIC 1 for offboard NIC) which is cool I guess because it can make identifying NICs easier.

Many years ago, one of the straws that made me leave Windows was a printer where to install the drivers without all the crap I had to find the DLLs and INF file and manually install it. And every single piece of hardware had drivers like this. And the crapware had masses of dependencies. All shouting brand as loud as they could. Oh and each with it's own update system. And even non-hardware companies are trying to get you to install their crapware, mainly to shout their brand at you. It's a cesspit.

Simplified systems for end users is fine and hiding the intricacies of the system is fine for the large majority of users. For those of us that need that though and that OUR job is to understand these machines, having control over the system is of course what we strive for.  For everyone else though, that extra control is pointless and only alienates the populace from how useful computers are."

That way it's easyer for someone else to fix your computer if you manage to fuck something up.

linuxmemes,2xh34e,st3500,0,Mon Mar 2 11:33:59 2015 UTC,"Because it makes sense after an update and it has never been anything else. My experience under Linux shows that even though it is possible to update files without shutting down programs using them, it is a very good idea to do so afterwards. I have seen many programs crash after an update because the files they are expecting to see are not there anymore or have changed. (apache, mysql and such do that quite often) I'm pretty sure that MS made Windows not accept changing files when they are in use is just to avoid such problems in the first place.  Kernel update is even worse, theres no way to load a new one without rebooting. You could just keep using the old one but in most cases updates fix bugs or contain security updates, the sooner you start using them the better."
linuxmemes,2xh34e,st3500,4,Sat Feb 28 18:07:53 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that you could simply request the user to allow modified programs to restart; restarting the entire system is completely unnecesary, except in the case of kernel updates (but even that will be history soon, since live kernel patching support is included in the 4.0 kernel)."
linuxmemes,2xh34e,woox2k,2,Sat Feb 28 18:27:37 2015 UTC,"This misses the point. Yes, some applications require a restart after an upgrade; this is expected. Even for the window manager, I could understand this behavior in the right circumstances. What is unreasonable, and what I am talking about, is the frequency with which the entire system needs to be rebooted. There is simply no reason to require me to completely restart my system because of anything less than a kernel upgrade. Modules can be unloaded and reloaded, and even the kernel case has limited lifetime; 4.0 will include live kernel patching.  This post sounds like Windows apologetics more than anything."
linuxmemes,2xh34e,distant_worlds,3,Sat Feb 28 18:33:07 2015 UTC,"I think the main purpose is to clean up everything at once, instead of restarting certain services and ending up with some sort of instability (potentially, not really, actually probably not a chance).  Over all, the whole thing is designed to keep all of the workings of the system under the hood so as not to intimidate the unsavvy folk. Just update through apt-get if you don't want to hear Ubuntu crying about reboots."
linuxmemes,2xh34e,mguzmann,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"Good point but these days it's usually simpler (sometimes even faster) to restart entire system than to expect that update manager is ""smart"" enough to restart/reload all updated programs and modules.  Since i moved my Linux onto SSD i don't even try to fix problems that are caused by not reloading stuff and etc, it's many times faster just to restart my PC that takes like 20seconds."

My arch hasn't broken itself in a long time. It's a bit harder to install than other distros if you're not used to a terminal or doing your own partitioning. But honestly graphical installers impose too many restrictions.   Begin rant   For example. I tried to install OpenSuSe a while back but stopped since I couldn't keep my encrypted disk setup. Btrfs with subvolumes on luks, suse only allows for lvm on luks and that killed me since I was just going to put suse on another subvolume in my current setup. The other problem I encountered was that I use gummiboot with efistub for booting because I hate grub, syslinux, refind, etc. And that installer wouldn't let me have a single bit of control over that.

I'm a network engineer so I don't really use any of the Java products, but as soon as an update is pushed out most people lose a week while we wait for the devs to fix whatever it was that was broken.

The pattern space now looks like  k10temp-pci-00c3 Adapter: PCI adapter temp1:        +45.8°C  (high = +70.0°C)   Then it's just a search and replace regex (s/<search>/<replace>/) to filter out everything that isn't our data.

linuxmemes,2vj0ez,ZaInT,1 point,Wed Feb 11 18:47:55 2015 UTC,"Binary blob:       In the context of open source software, a binary blob is a closed source binary-only driver without publicly available source code. The term usually refers to a closed-source kernel module loaded into the kernel of an open source operating system and is usually not applied to code running outside the kernel, such as BIOS code, firmware images, or userland programs [citation needed]. The term blob was first used in database management systems to describe a collection of binary data stored as a single entity.

linuxmemes,2vh4n2,benjabean1,2,Tue Mar 10 22:30:42 2015 UTC,"Well, the text is dynamically generated from the script data stored in the module. You can also lseek (the offset is line-based, not byte-based) to get a particular line of the script. And it doesn't write random quotes from Hackers to the syslog, it writes custom debug messages styled after Hakers quotes."

linuxmemes,2v359m,dkuntz2,17,Sat Feb 7 13:02:04 2015 UTC,Is it odd that I've never had a problem connecting to any Wi-Fi networks with Linux (specifically Ubuntu and Arch)?
linuxmemes,2v359m,fracturedcrayon,10,Sat Feb 7 13:59:06 2015 UTC,"I think it depended on the make of your wireless card. The success above I encountered only after LTS 14.04. Before that, it was hit and miss for me."
linuxmemes,2v359m,somenonewho,4,Sat Feb 7 14:06:22 2015 UTC,"True. The most common cards have a Broadcom chip set that requires non-free drivers, requiring extra effort to get and install those drivers. If a card doesn't have those chips, it makes life easier."
linuxmemes,2v359m,pizzacakemonster,3,Sat Feb 7 18:19:25 2015 UTC,Damn broadcom had a long struggle with my broadcom card. First it didn't work -> I installed the proprietary driver then it did work but would drop out every few minutes -> I mostly used Ethernet and it fixed itself at some point then the driver caused kernel panics on the 3.18 kernel -> I used the LTS kernel for a bit till it was patched. Let's see what the future brings.  PS: even though*l card is supported by the b43 driver since 3.17 it doesn't really work since the speed is around 150-200 KB/s.
linuxmemes,2v359m,kageurufu,1 point,Sun Feb 8 11:34:07 2015 UTC,"Oddly the source from their site works, but after reboot it forgets everything and don't load the modul of the chip. Maybe i haven't deleted properly a .ko file, but in other hand the blacklist didn't work too. So then i used binary stuff and enjoy the spamming bug (""wrong mac address"") broadcom chip in my syslog. -.-"
