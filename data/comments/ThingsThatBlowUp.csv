ThingsThatBlowUp,3dzh8k,1Voice1Life,37,Mon Jul 20 20:03:35 2015 UTC,Now this is fucking /r/ThingsThatBlowUp worthy.
ThingsThatBlowUp,3dzh8k,iSpccn,25,Mon Jul 20 20:50:51 2015 UTC,This gif gives a great sense of the unbridled power involved. Too often these sections of footage don't allow any sense of scale and distance but this one... Oh no. That little spit of land out there gets engulfed in a fireball
ThingsThatBlowUp,3dzh8k,Countfrackula,12,Mon Jul 20 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"All from a few pounds of fissile material. It's astounding how much energy is stored in the form of matter. Simply by giving things a little push, you start releasing enormous potential energy that has been stored in the element by a star billions of years ago."
ThingsThatBlowUp,3dzh8k,oskatilla,3,Tue Jul 21 01:44:57 2015 UTC,"Not a physicist myself so take this with a grain of salt, but I was under the impression that the (assumedly) Plutonium used in a device like this is obtained by bombarding Uranium with neutrons in a breeder reactor until you get Neptunium, which in turn decays into a fissile isotope of Plutonium (among other isotopes of various elements).   Although, I suppose as the Uranium used at the start of the enrichment process comes from stars you're still technically correct (which is the best kind of correct!)."
ThingsThatBlowUp,3dzh8k,PiXeestX,8,Tue Jul 21 07:58:49 2015 UTC,Beautifully terrifying
ThingsThatBlowUp,3dzh8k,Chaser892,6,Mon Jul 20 21:08:28 2015 UTC,Did the plane pictured bank away slightly because of the intense light?
ThingsThatBlowUp,3dzh8k,SlashedFX,-5,Tue Jul 21 00:28:38 2015 UTC,"Shock/thermal wave front is my guess. Aka, pressure from the explosion probably bumped the plane."
ThingsThatBlowUp,3dzh8k,Antal_Marius,9,Tue Jul 21 02:13:55 2015 UTC,"The pressure wave is only expanding as fast as the fireball you see ( which is really fast), and it slows by the time it gets to the plane.  There's no way it covered the distance from the explosion to the plane that quickly.  Edit: after rewatching the gif, you can see the shockwave moving across the water. It's nowhere near the plane as it starts banking."
ThingsThatBlowUp,3dzh8k,Dilong-paradoxus,2,Tue Jul 21 04:33:59 2015 UTC,Is it? IIRC the pressure wave travels faster and farther then the fireball. Or slow-mo videos that show the pressure wave going faster then the fireball are lying.
ThingsThatBlowUp,3dzh8k,Antal_Marius,2,Tue Jul 21 10:51:29 2015 UTC,"Well, the fireball does slow after a couple of fractions of a second, you're correct. But the initial expansion is a decent proxy for the speed of the expansion for our purposes - finding out why the airplane banks.  Edit: here is a series of pictures showing the separation of the fireball from the shockwave. You can see that the fireball edge and shockwave are one and the same until approximately when the fireball touches the ground, where the fireball slows down and the shockwave continues on without it. Of course, the energy being released in OP's gif is about an order of magnitude larger, but similar physics is happening.  Second edit: after watching OP's gif, I noticed you can actually see the shock moving along the water! It's nowhere near the airplane when the bank started. Case closed, people!"

ThingsThatBlowUp,3dzh8k,suchdownvotes,2,Mon Jul 20 22:56:09 2015 UTC,"There have been over 2,000 detonations of nuclear weapons around the globe... fucking appalling and crazy to think about that given our current views on environmental matters (which are still woefully deficient).    An interesting aside, if you work with sensitive equipment for measuring radioactivity, you need to shield the room with battleship steel... steel made after WW2 has too much radiation in it from all the nuclear weapons tests, so they use steel reclaimed from things before the end of WW2.  Mostly sunk ships including famously a WW1 german battleship. source"

ThingsThatBlowUp,3al4ns,Scribeoflight,3,Sun Jun 21 21:36:29 2015 UTC,"For scale, you've got this  You can see an interesting picture here  Like the BLU-82 ""Daisy Cutter"" before it (Used primarily in Vietnam to clear areas of trees and other similar structures for helicopter landings), the MOAB includes a spike at the front of the bomb.   This has to do with the designed effect of the bomb, what's called a 'thermobaric explosion'. This is when fuel and oxidizer are premixed, but not ignited on impact. Milliseconds after impact, once the fuel-air-oxidizer mix has reached the correct ratio, the cloud is ignited. Being off the ground, and dispersed sufficiently, the shockwave is not as strong, but because less of it is soaked up by the ground, it travels much further. MOABs rarely work against fortified or hardened targets such as tanks and armour, but are particularly effective in areas with obstacles, such as the previously mentioned trees and civilian structures. MOABs can be considered an anti-personnel weapon in two ways: Primarily, the design of the bomb and its payload creates a shockwave that can kill or main in a large radius of the target while leaving armoured and heavy vehicles intact (The shockwave affects the cardiopulmonary system and air-containing areas of the human body). Secondly, the weapon works as a tool of intimidation.  How does the MOAB deliver its explosive? Parachutes are deployed at launch to ensure the correct attitude for flight - Nose down. Throughout its flight, its size keeps it relatively stable. The spike in the front acts as a detonation trigger - It will touch the ground before the rest of the weapon, in which case a small explosive detonates to disperse the fuel-oxidizer mix, and on impact the bomb delivers a larger charge to detonate the cloud."

ThingsThatBlowUp,3a0m3s,garethashenden,3,Tue Jun 16 17:03:15 2015 UTC,"An oil depot in the port area of the Nigerian city of Lagos has been hit by a major explosion and fire.  The blast, which shook buildings in the Apapa area, happened during a transfer of fuel, the National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) said.  Firefighters have been at the scene and four people were wounded in the blast, AFP news agency reports.  Many tankers dock at jetties in the port in Lagos to load and unload petroleum products.  Willem Auret, who witnessed the blast from a ship on its way to Snake Island in Apapa, said he saw a tanker barge catch fire at about 11:00 local time (10:00 GMT).  ""The fire started slowly and then expanded into chaos, exploding more than once,"" he told the BBC.  ""After the initial explosion, which I caught on camera, there was a secondary explosion,"" he said.  It took about an hour and a half for the port authorities to arrive on the scene, he said.  ""First one tugboat arrived... then several others joined it in an attempt to extinguish the fire. They seem to have the fire under control now.""  Nema's Akande Iyiola told the BBC that the oil depot at Tin Can Island port where the explosion occurred was owned by the petroleum company MRS Oil.  ""I felt the explosion from where we are,"" Charles Osagie, who works at an import-and-export office in the district, told AFP."

ThingsThatBlowUp,39hxvx,snorting_gummybears,5,Thu Jun 11 20:56:57 2015 UTC,So why does the missile explode at that point? It looks like it's not getting enough thrust so there could be an excess of exhaust (and therefore heat) contained upon the launch pad which overheats the first stage resulting in an explosion. It doesn't look like there's any torsion (?) or unexpected stress on the rocket as it's barely moving (as you'd see with a rocket going off course higher up and suddenly there's a lot of lateral pressure which tears the rocket apart). [forgive the likely misuse of terms here]
ThingsThatBlowUp,39hxvx,StuartMThomas,8,Fri Jun 12 00:28:31 2015 UTC,Maybe they had a self destruct. The rocket looked like it was going way off course.
ThingsThatBlowUp,39hxvx,assface421,10,Fri Jun 12 01:02:27 2015 UTC,"Yup, at every launch there's a range safety officer who has the job of blowing up the rocket as soon as things look like they're going wrong. Not a bad job. At least, until the rocket is carrying humans."
ThingsThatBlowUp,39hxvx,SirWom,3,Fri Jun 12 01:16:37 2015 UTC,Of course. I guess I was thinking of that being something that's in play once the rocket is off the pad. Thanks. :)

ThingsThatBlowUp,39hxvx,SirWom,2,Fri Jun 12 05:04:36 2015 UTC,"Range safety:       In the field of rocketry, range safety may be assured by a system which is intended to protect people and assets on both the rocket range and downrange in cases when a launch vehicle might endanger them. For a rocket deemed to be off course, range safety may be implemented by something as simple as commanding the rocket to shut-down the propulsion system or by something as sophisticated as an independent Flight Termination System (FTS) that has redundant transceivers in the launch vehicle that can receive a command to self-destruct then set off charges in the launch vehicle to combust the rocket propellants at altitude. Not all national space programs utilize flight termination systems on launch vehicles.

ThingsThatBlowUp,38dffv,TheGreenJedi,4,Wed Jun 3 16:54:33 2015 UTC,"Water is incompressible, and not much pressure goes upwards due to the ice. Not sure how much pressure the normal lake fish can withstand, but it is hard to tell how much pressure that rocket is going to impart on the water."
ThingsThatBlowUp,38dffv,cdcformatc,5,Wed Jun 3 17:16:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, in this instance since the ice is so thin, the water is causing the explosion to act like a shaped charge. Directing most of the energy upwards since the surface ice is effectively the path of least resistance. Ignoring that, the explosive power is subject to the inverse square law. So the energy from the explosion is quickly dissipated the further you get away from the center of the detonation."
ThingsThatBlowUp,38dffv,ThatWolf,3,Wed Jun 3 18:09:05 2015 UTC,"Shaped charge:       A shaped charge is an explosive charge shaped to focus the effect of the explosive's energy. Various types are used to cut and form metal, initiate nuclear weapons, penetrate armor, and ""complete"" wells in the oil and gas industry.  A typical modern shaped charge, with a metal liner on the charge cavity, can penetrate armor steel to a depth of 7 or more times the diameter of the charge (charge diameters, CD), though greater depths of 10 CD and above  have been achieved. Contrary to a widespread misconception, most likely caused by the acronym HEAT, the shaped charge does not depend in any way on heating or melting for its effectiveness; that is, the jet from a shaped charge does not melt its way through armor, as its effect is purely kinetic in nature.

ThingsThatBlowUp,38dffv,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"Dumb Question,  why does the the ice form fairly even spaced lines when the rocket explodes? Is it just how coincidence that the pressure is released like that?"
ThingsThatBlowUp,38dffv,vicerowv86,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:18:47 2015 UTC,"Coincidence mainly. If you watch other videos on YouTube of bottle rockets being shot under ice, you will see ice cracking/shattering in a number of different ways."
ThingsThatBlowUp,38dffv,ThatWolf,3,Thu Jun 4 00:19:49 2015 UTC,well the ice gives so as soon as it does the pressure would be released. Also the water pressure wave will disappate as more and more water is involved in the wave. I'm not sure how quickly this would happen but since it looks like a fairly small pond perhaps it would dissipate quickly

Because it also provides part of the electrical insulation between internal live parts, transformer oil must remain stable at high temperatures for an extended period. To improve cooling of large power transformers, the oil-filled tank may have external radiators through which the oil circulates by natural convection.

ThingsThatBlowUp,35d8nx,ItAintStupid,2,Sat May 9 04:47:06 2015 UTC,I'm assuming this is a program to learn blasting not a whole school for it? How do you get into something like that? How long is the course? Very interesting stuff.
ThingsThatBlowUp,35d8nx,DDay629,3,Sat May 9 07:38:19 2015 UTC,"The program is called Blasting Techniques. It's a certificate program run through my local college it was a year of full time classes learning all about blast design, regulations which govern blasting and other topics like cost estimates and product selection.  In terms of getting in the only credentials required are a high school diploma though lots of guys had more than that and you'll want to have a good understanding of math since over half the course dropped out due to poor math skills.   As far as I know this is the only school that does this type of course in canada but there is a university in Missouri which teaches a similar program."

ThingsThatBlowUp,35a8ha,I_can_haz_eod,5,Fri May 8 18:51:56 2015 UTC,Is the reason why we can hear a fainter rumble immediately after explosion because the vibrations are traveling faster through the ground than they can through the air?  We hear the rumble AND THEN hear the explosion after the shock wave reaches the camera a second or so later.
ThingsThatBlowUp,35a8ha,dr_t_123,4,Fri May 8 19:03:16 2015 UTC,"Yep, I think you're right, since the instruction of sound is faster in solids than in gases..  Edit: induction*"

It is part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. The island is about 68 kilometers (42 mi) long, and from 3 to 6 km (1.9 to 3.7 mi) wide.  The area has a maritime climate, with many storms, and mostly overcast skies.  Amchitka was populated for more than 2,500 years by the Aleut people, but has had no permanent population since 1832. The island has been part of the United States since the Alaska Purchase of 1867. During World War II, it was used as an airfield by US forces in the Aleutian Islands Campaign.  Amchitka was selected by the United States Atomic Energy Commission to be the site for underground detonations of nuclear weapons. Three such tests were carried out: Long Shot, an 80-kiloton (330 TJ) blast in 1965; Milrow, a 1-megaton (4.2 PJ) blast in 1969; and Cannikin in 1971 – at 5 Mt (21 PJ), the largest underground test ever conducted by the United States. The tests were highly controversial, with environmental groups fearing that the Cannikin explosion, in particular, would cause severe earthquakes and tsunamis. Amchitka is no longer used for nuclear testing. It is still monitored for the leakage of radioactive materials.

ThingsThatBlowUp,33kfk1,Leostereo,2,Thu Apr 23 21:02:40 2015 UTC,"Halifax Explosion:       The Halifax Explosion occurred in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, on the morning of December 6, 1917. SS Mont-Blanc, a French cargo ship fully loaded with wartime explosives, was involved in a collision with the Norwegian vessel SS Imo in the Narrows, a strait connecting the upper Halifax Harbour to Bedford Basin. Approximately twenty minutes later, a fire on board the French ship ignited her explosive cargo, causing a cataclysmic explosion that devastated the Richmond District of Halifax. Approximately 2,000 people were killed by debris, fires, and collapsed buildings, and it is estimated that nearly 9,000 others were injured.  The blast was the largest man-made explosion prior to the development of nuclear weapons,  with an equivalent energy release of roughly 2.9 kilotons of TNT.  In a meeting of the Royal Society of Canada in May 1918, Professor Howard L. Bronson of Dalhousie University, a physicist, estimated the blast at some 2400 metric tons of high explosive.

This list contains the largest known examples, sorted by date. An unambiguous ranking in order of severity is not possible; a 1994 study by historian Jay White of 130 large explosions suggested that they need to be ranked by an overall effect of power, quantity, radius, loss of life and property destruction, but concluded that such rankings are difficult to assess.

ThingsThatBlowUp,33kfk1,autowikibot,4,Sun Apr 26 03:51:51 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, this looks closer to a thermobaric explosion, wherein a fine particulate or gas is dispersed over a wide area and ignited.   In such a case, it's far more dangerous to personnel than physical equipment (Though, there was likely quite a bit of damage to structures based on the apparent high-temperature and wide range of the explosion) because of the pressure differential: Once the gas is ignited, it requires air and oxygen to feed it, so anyone around the explosion would have the air sucked out of their bodies (i.e. lungs would sustain serious injuries, and any air spaces in the body will decompress violently), and find themselves unable to breathe in any oxygen subsequently. Death by suffocation would be more likely than death by burns sustained.  Grisly as fuck."

ThingsThatBlowUp,32u406,mrflib,-12,Fri Apr 17 18:38:38 2015 UTC,It failed again?
ThingsThatBlowUp,32u406,zilti,9,Thu Apr 16 21:04:49 2015 UTC,I think you underestimate just how much of an achievement this is.  This is not failure. They hit a boat. Twice. It's quite simply amazing.  Pop by /r/spacex for more information.
ThingsThatBlowUp,32u406,gellis12,-6,Thu Apr 16 21:11:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, I think it's quite amazing! I'm just somewhat disappointed they didn't achieve a ""clean"" landing yet, after everything Musk promised and said they'd achieve  :)"
ThingsThatBlowUp,32u406,DrMambo85,11,Thu Apr 16 21:27:21 2015 UTC,"He estimated an 80% success rate BY THE END OF THE YEAR  So far, they've managed to launch a very complicated tube of explosion juice into space, then make it turn itself around and fall back to Earth, and then as it's blasting through the atmosphere, steer it precisely enough to smack into a tiny platform that's floating on the ocean. And both times, they almost succeeded in sticking the landing!  I'd say that's pretty fucking impressive, considering nobody has ever even tried it before."
ThingsThatBlowUp,32u406,zilti,9,Thu Apr 16 23:22:38 2015 UTC,Upset they haven't achieved a clean landing yet? YET? IT'S THE SECOND GODDAMNED ATTEMPT! That's like Michael Jordan's parents complaining he hasn't made a slam dunk yet at the age of 6 months.

ThingsThatBlowUp,32rkbe,Trion_,10,Thu Apr 16 03:27:30 2015 UTC,"The primary mission (delivering cargo to the ISS) for the SpaceX was a success , but the secondary objective of landing the first stage on the autonomous spaceport drone ship, ""Just Read the Instructions,"" had some problems."
ThingsThatBlowUp,32rkbe,ChornWork2,-8,Thu Apr 16 03:31:11 2015 UTC,so it failed. gotcha.
ThingsThatBlowUp,32rkbe,ch33zyman,7,Thu Apr 16 04:26:49 2015 UTC,"Just the second part, which is only the second time they've tried it, they knew failure for that part was likely. They failed it the first time too. They did succeed in delivering its cargo to the ISS though, which was the primary mission."
ThingsThatBlowUp,32rkbe,Malhallah,3,Thu Apr 16 06:03:24 2015 UTC,"Secondary mission, landing on the barge was a partial failure. It landed on the barge but due to software errors it had too much sideways velocity and it tipped over. It was far from failure but just as far from success."
ThingsThatBlowUp,32rkbe,ChornWork2,6,Thu Apr 16 12:26:41 2015 UTC,"IMHO there's nothing wrong with failure.  Risking failure (and even repeating failures) is how the greatest successes are achieved.  But it irks me when we dodge calling it that...  If they would have stuck the landing perfectly the comments would be that delivering the cargo was routine, but the real success was the miraculous achievement of the landing.  The results should not drive  how we characterize the objectives."
ThingsThatBlowUp,32rkbe,Malhallah,2,Thu Apr 16 13:48:51 2015 UTC,"It isn't really avoidance, more of an acknowledgement that it's hard to call a booster returning from space and hard landing in the middle of the ocean on a small barge a failure.

ThingsThatBlowUp,32rkbe,samplebitch,2,Thu Apr 16 13:58:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they'll get it right eventually.  Every 'failure' here is a learning experience.  The first attempt didn't even get close to the platform.  The second time it made it to the platform but it came down way too hard.  This time, well, they almost made it.  It's amazing that this thing pushed a payload into space, fell back to earth, autonomously homed in on a small platform in the middle of the ocean, righted itself and touched down on the thing."
ThingsThatBlowUp,32rkbe,Malhallah,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:49:42 2015 UTC,"First attempt was january 10th, CRS-5 launch and it hit the barge but due to hydraulic fluid running out and the fins losing ""power"". https://vine.co/v/OjqeYWWpVWK  Second attempt was Febuary 11th, DSCOVR launch but due to bad conditions (bad weather, high seas) they decided to scrub the barge landing and soft land in water and the booster was lost when it went from vertical to horizontal position (smashing sideways into water). It was successful and even quite close to the figurative x they had marked.  This, CRS-6 was the third attempt.  EDIT: They probably would had landed this one perfectly if they hadn't lost the texas test platform in august. Now all their tests can be done one at a time several months apart."
ThingsThatBlowUp,32rkbe,SaigaExpress,5,Thu Apr 16 13:05:05 2015 UTC,that was actually really impressive i didnt know that this was even possible.
ThingsThatBlowUp,32rkbe,clinically_alive,2,Thu Apr 16 05:30:47 2015 UTC,It's not. Yet. This is the second time ever SpaceX has tried to do it on a live mission. It's not really like this is much of a faliure since normally they scrap the first stage in the ocean anyway so nothing of extraordinary value (to a space agency) was lost.

ThingsThatBlowUp,32o4vf,TopLOL,9,Wed Apr 15 18:44:25 2015 UTC,"It's not a laser, that's the actual missile - it's a flare element on the tail of the missile to aid with guidance"
ThingsThatBlowUp,32o4vf,TopLOL,3,Wed Apr 15 19:18:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was kind of doubting the laser because why would someone wave the laser around like that instead of just keeping it on the tank in the first place.

ThingsThatBlowUp,32o4vf,autowikibot,2,Wed Apr 15 19:25:56 2015 UTC,"read all about it   In most configurations, the narrow field camera utilizes electronics that translate the brightest spot in the view - the flare or strobe of the missile - into an electrical impulse. This impulse changes as the missile leaves the center of the field of view, and the electronics automatically apply a correction instruction in the opposite direction of the change to re-center the missile."

SACLOS devices commonly work using one of these methods: wire-guided, or radio-guided, or beam-riding.

ThingsThatBlowUp,32o4vf,CantaloupeCamper,2,Wed Apr 15 19:10:39 2015 UTC,"Laser guidance:       Laser guidance is a technique of guiding a missile or other projectile or vehicle to a target by means of a laser beam (Lidar). Some laser guided systems utilise beam riding guidance, but most operate more similarly to semi-active radar homing (SARH). This technique is sometimes called SALH, for Semi-Active Laser Homing. With this technique, a laser is kept pointed at the target (List of laser applications#Laser sight) and the laser radiation bounces off the target and is scattered in all directions (this is known as “painting the target”, or “laser painting”). The missile, bomb, etc. is launched or dropped somewhere near the target. When it is close enough for some of the reflected laser energy from the target to reach it, a laser seeker detects which direction this energy is coming from and adjusts the projectile trajectory towards the source. While the projectile is in the general area and the laser is kept aimed at the target, the projectile should be guided accurately to the target.

ThingsThatBlowUp,32o4vf,CantaloupeCamper,2,Wed Apr 15 19:11:31 2015 UTC,"Yes. Generally speaking, a target has to be 'painted', or designated with a narrow-band laser by an outside source (Sometimes the pilot pointing an aiming laser at the target, sometimes a watcher on the ground).  Anti-tank munitions can often be smart bombs, in which case the munition is usually a standard 500lb bomb with a guidance package is strapped or otherwise secured to the bomb and consists of a seeking head on a gimbal, and guidance fins  - Pointed in the direction of the target, the seeker head uses the gimbal, a gyroscopically stable platform in conjunction with independently-operated fins on the tail end to control the pitch and yaw of the weapon.   Early guided munitions used bang-bang controls, which only allowed for full deflection - That is, the fins could only be in one of two positions - All the way up, down, left or right, with no positions in between. The resulting flight path of the munition looked very much like a sine wave as the seeking head 'averaged out' the line to the target. These maneuvers bled a great deal of forward momentum from the flight of the projectile. As a result, pilots would 'loft' bombs or other guided munitions towards the target by pointing their nose upward and providing a greater curve to the trajectory of the munition. The seeking head would be activated some time after the bomb left the rails of the plane, so that a minimum of the projectile's energy would be expended in course correction. With better control systems, the bang-bang control scheme was ultimately removed for more accurate positioning systems. Bang-bang control systems are still used by some militaries, as they are less complex and expensive than their more accurate counterparts.."

ThingsThatBlowUp,328byz,murder_nectar,7,Sat Apr 11 21:17:24 2015 UTC,"Hydrogen is indeed cheaper, by a lot. . . Hydrogen gas is around 1.3 cents per cubic meter, helium gas is 132 cents per cubic meter ($1.32). So hydrogen is 100 times cheaper than helium.   It makes sense, helium is notoriously nonreactive (it's a noble gas after all), and as such is a pain in the ass to obtain. It's also much, much rarer than Hydrogen.   Hydrogen can be produced from natural gas for hella cheap, it can be electrolyzed by simply running a current through water, or probably a few other ways, it's more volatile to ship and store. But then again, we ship and store gasoline regularly, so that's not a huge deal."

ThingsThatBlowUp,30n6t4,CarbonGod,0,Sat Mar 28 22:51:17 2015 UTC,I'd say maybe about 10 kilometers
ThingsThatBlowUp,30n6t4,grumpy_lump,6,Sun Mar 29 01:16:45 2015 UTC,"Closer to 3-3.5km (around 2 miles), based on how long it took for the sound/shockwave to reach him."

ThingsThatBlowUp,30n6t4,grumpy_lump,3,Sun Mar 29 11:53:39 2015 UTC,The speed of sound is ~340 m/s (although it does vary a bit with temperature).
ThingsThatBlowUp,30n6t4,Drinking_Enthusiast,2,Sun Mar 29 12:49:16 2015 UTC,"If I understand correctly, the speed of the shockwave inside the explosive itself is indeed supersonic (this might be your mistake), but the shockwave in the air travels at the speed of sound."
ThingsThatBlowUp,30n6t4,meuzobuga,2,Sun Mar 29 14:11:53 2015 UTC,"No, the speed of sound in every material is different, and the speed of sound within the explosive will likely be faster than the speed of sound in air, but a shockwave is defined by being faster than the speed of sound in the material through which it propagates. The shockwave will decay in speed and intensity until it reaches the speed of sound, at which point it will be a sound wave and decay in intensity while propagating at the same speed."

ThingsThatBlowUp,30n6t4,meuzobuga,2,Sun Mar 29 15:00:09 2015 UTC,"Well, that depends on a lot of things from the current atmospheric pressure to the amount of explosive used to the detonation velocity of the explosive. For a kilogram of TNT you'd be looking at something like a fraction of a second and a distance of tens of meters, and for something like a ton of TNT you'd be talking about a few seconds and a distance of a few kilometers. For something like the Tzar bomba the shock wave would have stretched hundreds of kilometers and lasted for several minutes."

It was a big tank, and a huge cloud of oxygen began to grow around it. Everyone evacuated as quickly as possible because oxygen makes ordinary things dangerous, running toward the gas station nearby shouting at everyone to flee, not to start their cars. One of them did, and what followed was very unpleasant.  I was told this story a very long time ago, cannot find a documented reference to it."

ThingsThatBlowUp,2zw61k,ChornWork2,2,Sun Mar 22 21:56:54 2015 UTC,"Kinetic bombardment:       A kinetic bombardment or a kinetic orbital strike is the hypothetical act of attacking a planetary surface with an inert projectile, where the destructive force comes from the kinetic energy of the projectile impacting at very high velocities. The concept is often encountered in science fiction [citation needed] and originated during the Cold War.  The typical depiction of the tactic is of a satellite containing a magazine of tungsten rods and a directional thrust system. When a strike is ordered, the satellite would brake one of the rods out of its orbit and into a geostationary position while directly over the target. The rod would then begin to fall towards the earth, picking up immense speed until it reached terminal velocity shortly before impact. The rods would often be shaped so as to maximize terminal velocity. In science fiction, the tactic is often depicted as being launched from a spaceship, instead of a satellite.  Kinetic bombardment has the advantage of being able to deliver the projectiles from a very high angle at a very high speed, making them extremely difficult to defend against. In addition, projectiles would not require explosive warheads, and—in the simplest designs—would consist entirely of solid metal rods, giving rise to the common nickname ""Rods from God"".

ThingsThatBlowUp,2ztrq1,murderofcrows90,4,Sat Mar 21 19:29:50 2015 UTC,"Its a training scenario that simulates what would happen if a suicide bomber used 15 pounds on C4 on a bus.  My guess is that the ""projectile"" we see is the fuse/blasting cap setting off the explosive. So it would be laying on the ground and ran upwards into the bus."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2ztrq1,Idrkc,2,Sat Mar 21 21:50:51 2015 UTC,What you're calling a projectile is actually the fireball created by the detonator running down the primer cord to the blasting cap that is contained in the charge. The detonator is usually a small electronic device that ignites primer cord. Primer cord serves to bring the ignition source to the blasting cap and creates the time delay factor. (Primer cord is rated in feet/second)The blasting cap makes a larger explosion that serves to ignite the main charge which in this case is C4 plastic explosive.  There are other types of igniters who use percussion and other charges that function different ways also. What you see here is basic tough and pretty foolproof we used it alot in Vietnam and hasn't changed much since.

But you can't donate them. Safety is crucial to fireworks. These could have been homemade, consumer grade, or commercial grade. we don't know. ATF and a police department, or even a fire department likely aren't experienced enough to put on a public show safely. they're obviously trained in the handling and disposal of explosives but not in setting up shows, perimeters, crowd control, timing, etc. Yes, they could put one on, but all the variables and timing and equipment would take too long to hammer out.  I'm curious how they lit so many at once. Hand firing them might not be safe and would likely take a long time. Electric firing takes quite a while to wire up for so many shells."

There are a lot of things that go into determining accurate ballistic trajectories and I know none of them.  Though I do not know if you can, one has to assume that it is at least possible.

ThingsThatBlowUp,2ya70o,thetallestjew,2,Tue Mar 10 02:27:18 2015 UTC,"No, that'd be escape velocity. Generally speaking, you need to be moving at constant velocity of 11.2km/s, or 25000mph, to escape the Earth's gravitational pull.   I think you're thinking of Low-Earth Orbit, where the space station is. That requires a significantly different flight profile and trajectory to achieve.

ThingsThatBlowUp,2ya70o,PhantomLord666,1 point,Sun Mar 8 17:08:11 2015 UTC,Probably passes straight through a tank. which tend to be better armoured than tanks?    You think? What about composite armour? Explosive reactive armour? Or the active protection systems like Arena on the T90?
ThingsThatBlowUp,2ya70o,Erve,3,Sun Mar 8 20:20:57 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert on any of this, but I'm tempted to say that Arena might not even react fast enough...  From here, Hellfire II missile has a maximum speed of ~1000 mph (that's 447m/s). The rail gun round is travelling something like 3-4x faster - or nearly 2km/s. Arena has a reaction time of 0.05 seconds, and only engages targets within 50 metres. This round will cover that 50m in 1/40th of a second - less than the reaction time. Arena only engages things moving slower than 700 m/s anyway.   It will engage any threat approaching the tank between the velocities of 70 metres per second (230 ft/s) and 700 metres per second (2,300 ft/s)   Explosive reactive armour is primarily designed to stop the shaped metal jet from a HEAT round I believe, it doesn't do much to purely kinetic rounds. Composite armour might stop it, but I think the sheer amount of kinetic energy transfered to the tank would do a lot of damage.  If that round is 2kg and travelling at 2000m/s it has 4MJ of kinetic energy. That's about the same as 1kg TNT detonating directly on the tank side - except unlike an explosion, all the energy is directed inwards. Let's put it this way, I wouldn't want to be in that tank."

ThingsThatBlowUp,2xofcc,TheeVande,18,Mon Mar 2 19:09:17 2015 UTC,"Only if you are frying with a significant amount of oil over an open flame.  But even then you wouldn't get the same big fireball this guy had unless you were throwing in big chunks of ice.    The problem comes when ice crystals flash boil causing the oil to splatter.  Enough of those oil particles flying through the air reaching the open flame and they will ignite in a chain back to the source.  If there is still water/ice splattering oil violently, that's when you get the big fireball.   There are LOTS of products that are frozen you throw straight into a fryer.  Every single frozen french fry product there is, the instructions are to put it into a fryer while still frozen.     Source:  Former professional cook.  I've fried lots of frozen stuff and lived to tell the tale."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2xofcc,Doublestack2376,5,Mon Mar 2 21:26:30 2015 UTC,Well I stand corrected. Thanks for the input.
ThingsThatBlowUp,2xofcc,TheeVande,0,Mon Mar 2 21:33:02 2015 UTC,"Partially true.  Fries and other flash frozen material works well, but you still get quite a bit of splatter. The solid material of the fries and the chicken is what conducts the heat, and conducts it very effectively. Without those, if you just have water, you will get the effects described above. The point remains, don't put water near oil.  Related Note: If you ever decide to deep-fry a turkey, the above can happen. Turkeys can explode, bringing hot flaming oil out with them. Do not fuck around with this, it will kill or seriously burn you. Follow a few rules: 1) LET IT THAW COMPLETELY, 2) Fry in an open space, like the end of your driveway, away from trees and other houses. DO NOT use the side of your house. 3) Use two people, and use 2x4s to stand about 10ft away from the fryer whie lowering the turkey in. 4) For the love of God, fire extinguishers. Plural."

The charges explode, detonating any buried mines, thus clearing a path for infantrymen to cross. The system may either be man-portable, or vehicle-mounted.

There are a lot of them in the rack.  If the ""450V x 160"" caption means they're charging them to 450 volts and there are 160 of them in series, that's 72,000 volts at probably several amps.

ThingsThatBlowUp,2vanru,kennnnn,13,Mon Feb 9 16:04:03 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's intense!!  It seems like they fine tuned the aperture and shutter speed for exactly this moment; they must have had pretty accurate models back then on how bright the atomic blast would be.

ThingsThatBlowUp,2vanru,windblast,11,Mon Feb 9 14:59:08 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, I'd say that the camera is far from the shockwave, and zoomed in really far.  But that's only a guess, I'm not an expert on photographing explosions."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2vanru,jz88k,9,Mon Feb 9 16:03:08 2015 UTC,from the look of the perspective of the objects and the time (or lack of) between when the shockwave hits and the camera starts shaking I'd say they are fairly close
ThingsThatBlowUp,2vanru,Moikle,1 point,Mon Feb 9 16:48:39 2015 UTC,That's a good point.  They must've had some powerful methods of securing and explosion-proofing cameras back then.

ThingsThatBlowUp,2vanru,TheeVande,3,Tue Mar 24 11:58:09 2015 UTC,What caused the initial destruction before the shockwave? The heat?
ThingsThatBlowUp,2vanru,Cynical_Walrus,3,Mon Feb 9 23:23:40 2015 UTC,"To clarify, it is heat doing the damage. Conduction of heat is rather slow, ""only"" moving at the speed of sound. Conduction works through molecules actually hitting and transferring energy. Convection is similar to conduction, in that convection requires actual molecules to hit each other. Radiation, however, is achieved through electromagnetic radiation, which includes light. So light is kind of the culprit, but it's infrared and ultraviolet ""light"" or radiation that actually transfers the heat so quickly."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2vanru,Pseudoboss11,1 point,Tue Feb 10 11:40:10 2015 UTC,"So basically insane heat that travels at the speed of light because of radiation? At what point would the radiation wave, if that's even what it'd be called, finally dissipate?"
ThingsThatBlowUp,2vanru,TheeVande,2,Tue Feb 10 18:48:42 2015 UTC,The radiation actually heats something by hitting it. You know when you stand in the sun and you feel warm? That's your skin absorbing mostly IR and a little ultraviolet light.
ThingsThatBlowUp,2vanru,lintamacar,3,Tue Feb 10 22:24:39 2015 UTC,"Heat? Not really, since heat can be moved through conduction, convection or radiation. The latter of which is happening just before the shockwave comes.  Light does that. The explosion is bright enough to do that."

ThingsThatBlowUp,2vanru,Sonic10160,10,Tue Feb 10 00:13:22 2015 UTC,"The blast is so much brighter than the surrounding scene that the camera's exposure must be very very short to compensate. So short, in fact, that it's not enough to register the sunlight.  This is the same phenomenon as the photographs of the moon landings where the conspiracy theorists are always complaining that you can't see any stars. Well it's because they're too faint to be seen compared to the Moon's horribly bright surface."

ThingsThatBlowUp,2tu1uo,saltydawg102,10,Tue Jan 27 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"well isn't it safe to assume a shockwave travels at mach 1 (normal atmospheric conditions). Mach 1 = 340.3 m/s or 761.3 mph. 761.3 mph/60min= 12.7 miles a minute. Take that a step further to 1117.6 ft/s. Given about a 6 second delay, 6 secondsx1117.6= 6706 ft/5280= 1.27 miles. So that shockwave should travel 1.27 miles in 6 seconds. I guess your right, since that looks to be quite a bit further than 1.27 miles away. There, the math is done."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2tu1uo,Dead_Moss,1 point,Tue Jan 27 20:09:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, doing some rough estimates I'd say the blast is 30km away from the plane. Rounding the speed of sound off to 300m/s gives us 30km / 0.3km/s = 100 seconds for the plane to feel the shockwave"

ThingsThatBlowUp,2tsn5s,Gakuseinozen,6,Tue Jan 27 07:26:46 2015 UTC,I think these rounds are designed to pierce and penetrate armour. Basically the explosion propells liquid metal into the armour and fucks shit up in the inside.

ThingsThatBlowUp,2ofi71,JoJosh-The-Barbarian,0,Tue Dec 9 05:50:38 2014 UTC,"Empire State Building:       The Empire State Building is a 103-story skyscraper located in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and West 34th Street. It has a roof height of 1,250 feet (380 m), and with its antenna spire included, it stands a total of 1,454 feet (443 m) high.  Its name is derived from the nickname for New York, the Empire State. It stood as the world's tallest building for nearly 40 years, from its completion in early 1931 until the topping out of the original World Trade Center's North Tower in late 1970.  Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Empire State Building was again the tallest building in New York (although it was no longer the tallest in the US or the world), until One World Trade Center reached a greater height on April 30, 2012.  The Empire State Building is currently the fourth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States (after the One World Trade Center, the Willis Tower and Trump International Hotel and Tower, both in Chicago), and the 25th-tallest in the world (the tallest now is Burj Khalifa, located in Dubai). It is also the fifth-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas.

ThingsThatBlowUp,2ofi71,confluencer,2,Sat Dec 6 14:20:47 2014 UTC,"Ironically, your estimate of ""thousands"" is just as far off as OP's claim of billions. Let's suppose each firecracker is approximately 2 grams, as MrF33 suggested. From the video we see a pile of firecrackers that we can approximate as being a rectangular box about 10 meters by 20 meters and that is, say, 4 cm tall on average. The average density of firecrackers is just that of cardboard, which is 600 kg per cubic meter. That gives us on the order of 2-3 million firecrackers."

I happen to have studied photography for years, and have no issue telling straight away that this is video captured with a very high zoom, but pretty much anyone who's ever payed attention to how an image distorts as you zoom in with a camera can tell you that. I'm also one of those twats who keep decent track of military hardware, and can tell you that this is a T-90. A tank with a smooth-bore barrel, not firing a ballistic projectile but probably a guided subsonic missile. One that, although I don't know the exact speed for, averages about 340m/s for the first few kilometers. It takes a while to reach speed, though, and at about a second or so of travel time in this video everything seen makes perfect sense. That's not enough for me to grab a sword and defend this video being real in a fight to the death, but it does give me the confidence to say that arguments related to this for why it would be fake are silly. And I don't really see any other reason to believe it's fake."

ThingsThatBlowUp,2kbcfh,sean_incali,9,Sun Oct 26 00:56:07 2014 UTC,Yep this really happened and they tested it on more than one occassion. It was eventually abandoned because it was impractical. Not to mention that pesky side effect of irradiating the gun crew
ThingsThatBlowUp,2kbcfh,BenderB-Rodriguez,14,Sat Oct 25 23:08:18 2014 UTC,According to the Wikipedia article this was the only one ever fired. There's no information on it irradiating the gun crew and I doubt that's true because they detonated it only six miles from the gun itself.
ThingsThatBlowUp,2kbcfh,OneRunJunior,4,Sat Oct 25 23:22:29 2014 UTC,"From what I'm reading, only one was fired as an artillery piece. Others in the class were tested from fixed stands like most of the other nuclear tests.  The one that was fired was done remotely, so it didn't actually irradiate a crew, but it would have done so if it were used in the field."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2kbcfh,contrarian_barbarian,-3,Sun Oct 26 01:26:17 2014 UTC,"Yep this really happened and they tested it on more than one occassion.  From what I'm reading, only one was fired as an artillery piece.   That's not what he said, and not what I replied to. There were other tests in that whole operation, but according to the article on wikipedia there was only one artillery round shot that was a nuclear test. There is also no mention anywhere of it irradiating the gun crew since they were actually there and he has no source to back up his claim."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2kbcfh,OneRunJunior,3,Sun Oct 26 01:48:08 2014 UTC,"There is also no mention anywhere of it irradiating the gun crew   He clearly meant it had the potential to irradiate the crew if it were actually used in combat, which added to the reasons it was abandoned."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2kbcfh,MrHeuristic,-1,Fri Oct 31 20:41:55 2014 UTC,"He said they tested it more than once, it was impractical (I'll give him that) and that it irradiated the crew. The first is false according to everything I've been able to find about this test, and they never knew if it would irradiate the crew because they never tested it with a live crew. Sure, the potential is there but the entire premise of his comment is wrong because he based it on them testing it multiple times and there's no supporting evidence to that. Even with the Tsar Bomb most of the radiation would be fatal only out about 4 miles or so according to nukemap."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2kbcfh,OneRunJunior,-12,Fri Oct 31 20:53:10 2014 UTC,Wikipedia is not an academic source don't reference it as such. In this particular test there was no gun crew as it was the first and was fired remotely incase of failure. There is enough evidence to suggest the gun was fired a second time with a live crew in the Nevada nuclear test range. 6 miles from a nuclear blast isn't very far it is very easy for the wind to blow radio active fallout dozens of miles away.
ThingsThatBlowUp,2kbcfh,BenderB-Rodriguez,7,Sun Oct 26 00:21:14 2014 UTC,Do you have a source that they fired it more than once?

Funnily enough I saw this footage used in a programme called ""Destroyed In Seconds"" where they showed this but cut to a bunch of unrelated hydrogen bomb footage clips and told the story about the hydrogen bomb that went way over expected yield and irradiated a bunch of US personnel and a Japanese fishing vessel as if it was this test that went wrong. Good old American TV, where a fucking atomic cannon isn't exciting enough so you have to lie to make it more interesting!"

Also, that actually happened. I think it was Castle Bravo. The US was doing a hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific, and the blast went way over yield. The resulting blast destroyed a lot of equipment, and the result fallout accidentally hit the Marshall Atoll (I think it was this) and irradiated a bunch of natives."

ThingsThatBlowUp,2kbcfh,JoJoDaMonkey,22,Sun Oct 26 18:44:44 2014 UTC,"I don't think ""incinerated instantly"" is accurate. More like ""probably irradiated."" The ""incineration"" range for this type of tactical nuclear ordinance was in the ballpark of a mile or less, and artillery guns of this type typically have ranges of many miles.  A little research shows that this is an M65 Atomic Cannon, which could fire  shells with a yield of <20 kilotons. Those shells could cause third degree burns at a range of ~1.2 miles, and the cannon had a range of ~20 miles. While it was certainly possible for them to shoot it close enough to blow themselves up, that would make as much sense as pulling the pin on a grenade and tossing it at your own feet.  As far as radiation goes, though, they'd certainly be close enough to get a decent dose depending on which way the wind was blowing.  The Davy Crockett, on the other hand, was much touchier. Its warheads had a probably-lethal radius of about a quarter mile, and the launchers had a 1.5-2.5 mile range (basically a nuclear bazooka). Cutting it awfully close, to be sure. Being exceptionally pedantic, ""incinerated instantly"" still wouldn't be accurate; they could die from radiation poisoning, but the fireball would be much smaller (though honestly I think I'd prefer the fireball)."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2kbcfh,autowikibot,8,Sun Oct 26 00:01:04 2014 UTC,"Sounds a little exaggerated dude. In this gif the weapon detonates 7 miles downrange and the effective range of the canon is ~20 miles. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M65_Atomic_Cannon) Also per Wikipedia the area of destruction for similar sized warheads (Littleboy was 16 kt, W9 shell 15 kt) there is only light destruction 3.5 miles away. This is not accounting for thermal radiation but I'd be willing to wager that if you are on a nuclear artillery crew you would have some PPE and a prepared position (i.e. shelter from the blast.)"

ThingsThatBlowUp,2jsgar,PatHeist,4,Tue Oct 21 05:30:27 2014 UTC,That's around 1600lbs of C4. the line charge is known as a MICLIC and the vehicle it is firing from is called an Assault Breacher. It's a M1 Abrams chassis with the M58 line clearing charge apparatus attached in place of the turret.
ThingsThatBlowUp,2jsgar,PatHeist,3,Tue Oct 21 05:41:38 2014 UTC,I was...definitely off on the scale the first time I saw that gif. I thought that vehicle was a little EOD rover.
ThingsThatBlowUp,2jsgar,Brewtown,2,Tue Oct 21 06:22:00 2014 UTC,"It's just the wire. They can use different explosive loads depending on what they're trying to do, and it can be used for anything from clearing paths through rubble and walls, to de-mining an area or clearing IEDs, to being deployed as a weapon. Usually the explosive force is going to be extremely high, though. And they use very low volume quick burning explosives on purpose to maximize the chance of the shock wave setting off nearby explosives."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2jsgar,CarbonGod,1 point,Tue Oct 21 05:28:53 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure the other video is using a part charge on the line for effect. If you look at the US or UK systems they have the same sort of blast. Search this sub for assualt breacher.
ThingsThatBlowUp,2jsgar,keatonch,1 point,Tue Oct 21 05:20:41 2014 UTC,"The US used to mainly deploy auxiliary weapons units like the M58, which is basically just a big box of C4 rope with a tube launcher attached for it, until they got their M1 based assault breacher just a few years back. It is just the same system with some lids on it, more tightly integrated on a tank chassis, though."

ThingsThatBlowUp,2hy6kj,karlrocks23,0,Wed Oct 1 19:56:20 2014 UTC,Then why don't the continents sink?
ThingsThatBlowUp,2hy6kj,theideanator,3,Wed Oct 1 21:45:54 2014 UTC,"Because they (i.e. the plates, both oceanic and continental) are less dense than the magma beneath them. Convection currents beneath the crust also push upwards which helps in keeping them 'afloat'. But it must be noted that they do technically 'sink' all the time. There is a constant destruction/construction cycle of the crust across many continental boundaries due to the convection currents, which drive some plates into each other and pull others apart (although there are exceptions- hots spots etc). But simply, it's just not able to happen because the plates aren't just sitting there, there are absolutely enormous levels of force and tension between the plates, so they could never just 'sink', if that makes sense!  And just incase you're referring to the plates sinking because they are less dense than water, the water sits above oceanic plates (and the oceanic plates sit above the magma)."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2hy6kj,nodnodwinkwink,0,Thu Oct 2 00:21:36 2014 UTC,"Because they (i.e. the plates, both oceanic and continental) are less dense than the magma beneath them  it must be noted that they do technically 'sink' all the time.    Cant have it both ways, if they are supposed to float then why do they sink?   And just incase you're referring to the plates sinking because they are >less dense than water, the water sits above oceanic plates (and the >oceanic plates sit above the magma).   Then what about the mid oceanic ridge?  thats like saying boats float even though they have a giant crack running stem to stearn.  And before you say ""well the water flashes to steam, and the steam is less dense so the whole lot is floating on a bed of steam: the water is under enough pressure that the water doesnt flash to steam and stays approximately the same density."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2hy6kj,Quackenstein,2,Thu Oct 2 04:24:16 2014 UTC,"The way they sink isn't just like if you drop a rock into water. The only way they sink is when they collide, and they collide because the convection currents drive them into each other. In this system, the oceanic plate will always sink because it's denser than a continental plate. So when I say 'technically sinks' it really means that one plate is pushed under another one and 'sinks' into the lithosphere/mantle. The point where an oceanic plate is pushed under a continental plate is called a subduction zone. A picture paints a thousand words. This mechanism is the the reason for the formation of mountains, and the pressure the oceanic plate puts on the continental plate causes the continental plate to buckle and fold at the subduction zone (hence the term 'fold mountains').  The mid-atlantic ridge is the opposite of the above, this is where the eurasian plate and the north-american plate are pulling away from each other. When the plates pull apart a fault forms (it happens in other plate interactions too but lets just stick with this). This fault then gets larger and deeper until it gets deep enough that magma below breaks through and starts to stream out. This magma hits the water, cools and solidifies, which creates new crust. The water above the oceanic crust is responsible for compressing the oceanic crust (that's why it's denser than continental crust), but in terms of plate tectonics it doesn't really affect anything else other than that it rapidly cools lava.  Imagine it this way. The magma is ball of water and the plates are several sheets of interlocking ice that cover that ball. The reason the ice sheets don't sink is because they are less dense than the water below. In the case of the mid Atlantic ridge, there is a crack between two sheets of ice that are pulling apart. The water below will then start to seep up that crack, and when it reaches the surface it suddenly freezes, turns to ice and forms new part of the ice sheets. In the case of a subduction zone, two ice sheets collide, and the denser one will be pushed down into the water where it melts. Does that make sense?"
ThingsThatBlowUp,2hy6kj,theideanator,1 point,Thu Oct 2 12:06:15 2014 UTC,That's a good question. Probably because the magma has nowhere to go.

ThingsThatBlowUp,2hu3rm,AliasUndercover,12,Tue Sep 30 01:02:26 2014 UTC,"This is a diesel ship, they don't have boilers. Plus a boiler explosion would not be that powerful."

ThingsThatBlowUp,2hu3rm,itsonlyastrongbuzz,3,Tue Sep 30 13:32:31 2014 UTC,most likely the magazine.
ThingsThatBlowUp,2hu3rm,Quazaria7892,2,Tue Sep 30 02:41:21 2014 UTC,"According to Wikipedia, it was the magazine."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2hu3rm,TheyDeserveIt,6,Tue Sep 30 13:19:32 2014 UTC,"Those poor sailors.  It was bad enough the ship was already sinking rapidly.    I recently had a conversation with a friend saying that if we ever went to war, we would actually prefer to be in the infantry as opposed to on a tank or a plane or a ship.  Even though the latter seems safer, if something does go wrong, all of you could be screwed.  This seems to prove that point."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2hu3rm,squarehead93,7,Tue Sep 30 04:35:46 2014 UTC,"Assuming two or more superpowers don't decide to start exchanging blows... being stationed on a ship is probably about as safe as it gets today.

ThingsThatBlowUp,2hu3rm,1niquity,4,Tue Sep 30 06:28:30 2014 UTC,"For sure. I was qualifying it with ""if we were at war."" Certainly seems like it was a very hazardous job until post WWII."

ThingsThatBlowUp,2hu3rm,OriginalLinkBot,2,Mon Sep 29 23:16:17 2014 UTC,I wonder if it just blew up or got hit by a missile? Would the shockwave kill you if you were already in the water???
ThingsThatBlowUp,2hu3rm,jamesanator9,9,Tue Sep 30 02:28:22 2014 UTC,"Its the HMS Barham, it was hit by 3 torpedoes on November 25 1941 just off the coast of Egypt. Uboat U-331 was credited with its destruction."

ThingsThatBlowUp,2hs881,forte2,10,Mon Sep 29 12:52:31 2014 UTC,Why is there no sound of the explosions and just Adele music???
ThingsThatBlowUp,2hs881,gorillamunchies,3,Mon Sep 29 15:09:05 2014 UTC,"Can anyone explain why some of those were considered ""bad"" blasts?  They all looked pretty damned explodey to me."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2hs881,TikiiTorch,3,Mon Sep 29 19:25:33 2014 UTC,"First, I know nothing about demolitions and mining.  My guess is shooting large amounts of stuff into the air is pretty wasteful, I think they generally want as much of the energy as possible to go to breaking up the rock.  Also there were a few that look like incomplete or too small a charge. The one that stands out to me is as under-powered is this one."
ThingsThatBlowUp,2hs881,1SweetChuck,2,Mon Sep 29 19:39:38 2014 UTC,"Ah, yeah. That makes sense. Thanks!"
ThingsThatBlowUp,2hs881,TikiiTorch,3,Mon Sep 29 20:39:02 2014 UTC,"Quite a few of the bad blasts looked to have incomplete detonation - fusing lines severed by an earlier overpowered shot possibly. So mixed in with all that new rock are a lot of explosives and detonators. The explosives are probably relatively safe because they're likely distributed after the partial blasts and would be pretty insensitive too, but the detonators are the bits that are easy to set off and have a much less stable explosive within.   Plus wasted energy, poor rock fracturing so having to rework the area and that kind of thing."

ThingsThatBlowUp,2hhl5d,rAxxt,3,Fri Sep 26 01:40:18 2014 UTC,"Interesting fact: In Australia and the UK and many other countries, the hum you're hearing is lower pitched than in these videos.  Notice how the hum is always the same pitch? That's a 60 hertz hum. It's because the alternating current going through the line alternates 60 times a second. In the countries I mentioned above, they have 50 hertz power and so their hum is lower pitched. This is also related to why, in the US, televisions operate at 30 frames per second, but in some other countries it's 25 frames per second. The distinction these days is more to do with legacy than anything else, there's no physical reason TVs have to be that way. But back in the days of CRT televisions with the glass tubes, the electron gun was set to operate properly at the frequency of the local power supply.  Edit: In fact the one where the stick is burning up on the power lines at 3:25 - 50hz country... probably Australia (blue sky and it seems to be a bit of a drongo thing to do)."
