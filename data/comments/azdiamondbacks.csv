azdiamondbacks,3e7lxb,sparcos,2,Wed Jul 22 16:45:23 2015 UTC,"Wtf? Why? He's been in A ball most of the season, he got 14 innings in AA and had an era over 5. I bet La Russa said the wrong name on the radio"
azdiamondbacks,3e7lxb,go_dbacks,1 point,Wed Jul 22 16:33:24 2015 UTC,"Low Risk high reward. The Montero deal was considered a straight up cash dump, which is fine, but if Godley can turn into a servicable pitcher ontop of that, it makes the deal look all the better.  Worst case scenario, he goes back down when Anderson is ready to come back."
azdiamondbacks,3e4v5f,SnakeBot,5,Tue Jul 21 23:43:31 2015 UTC,Did BB just bring up the Violent Femmes?
azdiamondbacks,3e4v5f,brandonatron,4,Wed Jul 22 02:05:59 2015 UTC,"Fuck, I missed it. I hope he did"

azdiamondbacks,3e4v5f,brandonatron,4,Wed Jul 22 01:56:29 2015 UTC,Didn't particularly expect a pitchers duel.
azdiamondbacks,3e4v5f,parker_dub,2,Wed Jul 22 02:16:24 2015 UTC,It's still early.
azdiamondbacks,3e4v5f,andrew02020,4,Wed Jul 22 02:22:51 2015 UTC,Latos' fastball is the straightest pitch I think I've ever seen.
azdiamondbacks,3e4v5f,andrew02020,4,Wed Jul 22 02:25:37 2015 UTC,First team with an xtra base hit wins.  Edit: Miami takes it
azdiamondbacks,3e4v5f,brandonatron,3,Wed Jul 22 02:55:27 2015 UTC,Woohoo!
azdiamondbacks,3e4v5f,Navi401,4,Wed Jul 22 03:02:50 2015 UTC,I think Collmenter threw the slowest fastball in history at 81 MPH during that inning.
azdiamondbacks,3e4v5f,-Lysosome-,3,Wed Jul 22 04:30:34 2015 UTC,This is why I love Bour. He saw the shift was on so he tried to bunt down to 3B. It didnt work but to see a power guy like him accept that he cant always hits homers and that he needs to help his team win.
azdiamondbacks,3e4v5f,Navi401,2,Wed Jul 22 01:50:10 2015 UTC,As long as we're not facing him I always root for him because he's from my hometown.

azdiamondbacks,3e4v5f,-Lysosome-,2,Wed Jul 22 04:15:42 2015 UTC,"Not surprising when he's throwing the ball like 55 feet. I never said it wasn't effective, just said I don't like watching it."

azdiamondbacks,3dyitt,Secc_15,9,Mon Jul 20 16:01:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna pretend to fully understand how bonus pool and slot value works, but I don't see a massive problem with what the D'backs did here...  Sure, the D'backs were ALLOWED to spend $14mill on signing bonuses for their draft picks, but do they honestly really need to? You look at what the D'backs did with their draft, and what their philosophy was, to draft players that are close to helping the compete, I'm pretty happy with what they got. If they saved $1.7mill in their budget, that can now go towards something else, good on them.   As far as I can tell, the D'backs are lining their ducks up now, to be major players in the off season, or at least to have the potential to do so. Derek Hall said last year that the team was willing to spend even more in the future. Of course they needed to be allowed some time to get the bad contracts off their payroll, and with the acception of Hill and Reed, they've pretty much accomplished that. Save a little money here and there, like $1.7mill that Ken Kendrick can keep in his pocket, you start adding that money up and it starts to become a big number very quickly."
azdiamondbacks,3dyitt,Antarix,5,Mon Jul 20 16:23:06 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can think of - maybe the writer thinks we should have drafted more players with the intention of giving them a bonus above slot value? I don't know if it would have been possible to draft many more players worth above slot value.  One thing I am sure of is if this offseason results in more broken promises (eg. promising a top of the rotation arm and signing Bronson Arroyo, which ended up costing us our #4 prospect, what a stupid move) I will be very disappointed considering how much cash we have available."
azdiamondbacks,3dyitt,go_dbacks,6,Mon Jul 20 16:28:09 2015 UTC,"The way that I've viewed this season so far has been, ""Cleaning up the mess that KT made"". With the sheer number of bad contracts the team had, we really had no chance going into last free agency to get a front line starter. Since Stewart has come in, we've pretty much cut our salary in half and gotten rid of pretty much all of the players that are costing us more than $10mill a year, with the exception of Hill, who's being heavily shopped as well.   After the trade deadline, the books will pretty much be reset, and the team will have upwards of $50million of salary money every year to allocate where every they please. Probably more, because the new TV deal will be going into affect. The team could potentially add on $70million in player salary this off season."
azdiamondbacks,3dyitt,Antarix,3,Mon Jul 20 17:04:10 2015 UTC,"I hope they're smart spending the money they have. I don't want a Cano, Hamilton, or Pujols! Hopefully Stewart's background as an agent helps in that department."
azdiamondbacks,3dyitt,go_dbacks,4,Mon Jul 20 17:08:07 2015 UTC,I don't understand. Did we fail to sign anyone important because we didn't offer enough of a bonus? Or do they want us to give bigger checks out just because?
azdiamondbacks,3dyitt,go_dbacks,4,Mon Jul 20 16:16:23 2015 UTC,"No, they have money left over because they drafted sub-par talent that was signable for less money.  Using early picks on college relief pitchers is a bad idea.  They are hoping that a couple make it up quickly and can perform well enough.  Maybe some will but the draft is the chance to score real talent and they didn't bother trying.  edit - Teams should be taking the best available talent independent of what the MLB team currently needs.  Very few players from each draft make it and of those very few do anything significant.  They also didn't go for any HS players in the early rounds"

azdiamondbacks,3duk1f,andrew02020,2,Sun Jul 19 23:03:47 2015 UTC,That's pretty standard for whoever is the best hitter on a AAA team. Consider how frequently the team called up Alfredo Marte and Rodger Kieschnick the last 2 years.
azdiamondbacks,3duk1f,andrew02020,2,Mon Jul 20 00:29:41 2015 UTC,Bye bye Burgers. I'm sad to see Chase get hurt though.

Burgos was really good for us when he first came up, then we pitched him into the ground and he got hurt.

azdiamondbacks,3dokxj,bp9801,2,Sat Jul 18 05:45:24 2015 UTC,He's 33 and only getting worse. Like if you want to get rid of him for nothing that would work but I can't see anybody giving up anything more than organizational depth for him. Especially with that contract.
azdiamondbacks,3dokxj,andrew02020,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:48:16 2015 UTC,"He has one year left on his deal. For $12 million...

Plus whenever they figure out what to do with O'Brien could push this even further in our favor.   Since you covered the stats perfectly, I'd add the biggest intangible benefit of the trade is how it convinced someone high up in the organization to finally shut Ken Kendrick the fuck up. He did his best to poison this trade in its infancy. Since that debacle, ol' KK has been pretty quiet around the media. And thank god for that."

azdiamondbacks,3dfgdy,the_king_of_fighters,24,Wed Jul 15 21:16:44 2015 UTC,"WELCOME NEW FRIEND.  PLAYERS YOU NEED TO KNOW   Paul Goldschmidt: Widely considered one of the best all around players in the league. Guy is an absolute machine. He hits, he plays defense, he runs the bases well. You name it, and Paul Goldschmidt does it well. AJ Pollock: Currently having a break out year at the plate. Considered one of the top 3 defenseive Center fielders in the game and was elected to the All Star Game by his fellow players. Yasmany Tomas: The big Cuban free agent signing from this last off season. He's a very good hitter, showing a surprisingly advanced approach at the plate, but he's still learning. Definately has an exciting future ahead of him. Jake Lamb: One of the better young Third Basemen in the game. Plays above average defense and has a pretty nice swing. Had an amazing start to the year before hurting his foot. Took some time to come back, but started to heat up before the break. Should have a good 2nd half. Nick Ahmed: An absolute wizard at Short Stop. Makes every play look easy. Biggest concern has always been the bat, which started horribly slow in April, but has since become a very valuable addition to the line up. Ender Inciarte: The squirrelly lead off hitter for the team. Is a pure contact hitter, excellent base runner, great defender in the outfield, and has a cannon for an arm, all-be-it a loose cannon. He's received comparisons to a young Ichiro.  Chris Owings: The youngest of the young guns on the team. Had a very solid start to 2014 as a 22 year old rookie before missing 3 months with a shoulder injury. Came back late in the year, but was obviously not the same. Had off season surgery, and still hasn't gotten back to where he was. His defense has stayed good which has kept him his spot for the time being, but he will certainly be in a fight for his job come spring training next year.  David Peralta: More a cool story. Was originally a pitcher in the Cardinal organization before a series of injuries to his arm kept him from pitching anymore. Sorta disappeared in the Venezuelan league. Showed up 4 years later playing in an independent league in the states as an outfielder, and got signed to a minor league deal in 2013. Less than a year later, he's debuting in the majors.  Patrick Corbin: Left handed pitcher, 95mph+ fastball and a CRAZY slider that. Just got back from Tommy Johns surgery, so 2015 will be a bit of a rebuilding year for him, but his stuff is still wicked. Rubby De La Rosa: Has hit 98mph as a starter. You just don't see that very often. He has a change up that breaks a stupid amount, and 2 seam fastball that moves just as much. Pedro Martinez has said that De La Rosa could be a very speical player, but the trouble has been finding consistency. Archie Bradley: The Golden boy of the D'backs farm system. Earned a spot on the 25 man roster right out of spring training (which is very rare for top prospects) and dominated his first 3 starts, before he took a come backer to the face. Since then, he tried to rush himself back which caused his elbow to flair up and he's been sidelined ever since.    As far as the organization as a whole goes, you could best describe what the D'backs are doing as a, ""Youth Movement"". The team currently has the youngest average age of any major league team, as well as the lowest payroll of any team. Since the new General Manager, Dave Stewart took over after last season, he's done pretty much nothing but bring in young, controllable, high upside players (namely pitchers) in order to stock up an already pitcher heavy Minor League Organization. This might sound like over kill, but you can never have to many pitchers. The situation is still working itself out in terms of who will ultimately stay in the rotation, but there is a lot of talent there for sure.  The future is bright for the Diamondbacks in my eyes. The fact that they have been able to stay close to .500 with such a young roster, with so many question marks in their rotation, and having one of the worst bullpens in the majors early in the year is pretty remarkable. Once the team starts to spend the absolute mountain of cash this off season, they will really be contenders."

azdiamondbacks,3dfgdy,ilonzo,6,Wed Jul 15 23:26:10 2015 UTC,"Once the team starts to spend the absolute mountain of cash this off season, they will really be contenders.   This is a very important point, and a big reason I think the new guy picked a perfect time and the perfect team to follow.   Starting this (NA) winter, you're looking at a team that could be spending in the area of an extra $100M/yr in salary.  If the team can finish the rest of the season strong and prove that they're potential contenders, there will be a lot of money flying around.  We have one of the best offenses in the game, but mediocre pitching. If the organization spends that money on some of the elite pitching available this year, we've got some real chances at winning it all.   The idea is to have Superstar veteran presence leading the pack for the young, controllable, high-upside core.  ...As long as ownership and management doesn't fuck it all up."

azdiamondbacks,3dfgdy,Antarix,3,Thu Jul 16 00:09:57 2015 UTC,"I'll get started on that, but I'd make some changes to the top 10 prospects.   Remove Bradley as a prospect. Add Swanson at #1 (assuming he signs before the 2pm deadline on Friday). Blair has leap-frogged Shipley according to Baseball America. Drury to 4th. O'Brien to 5th. Guerrero to 6th. Put Wei-Chieh Huang at 8th. The guy is destroying in Kane County. Put 2nd Round Pick Alex Young at 9th.  Bump Reinheimer to 10th.    So IMO, the top 10 should go (until Swanson signs, then you bump everyone back a spot.).   Blair Shipley Lopez Drury O'Brien Guerrero Leyba Wei-Chieh Huang Alex Young Jack Reinheimer"

New players like (Beef) Welington and Salty; upcoming players like Owings, Lamb, and Ahmed; guys having solid years like Peralta; and pitchers putting on a show, like JHell, Chase, and Ziggy. Plus the nicknames, what players may be tradebait, why Beef and Salty are filling in for Tuffy, and so many other things to cover."

azdiamondbacks,3d4eyu,ilonzo,4,Mon Jul 13 13:00:23 2015 UTC,Looks like Goldy is hitting clean up in the All Star game. That's going to be pure sex
azdiamondbacks,3d4eyu,cakelorldeath,3,Mon Jul 13 23:38:08 2015 UTC,I wonder if Goldy will ever participate in the Home Run Derby? That would be amazing to watch
azdiamondbacks,3d4eyu,Soon2barmn,5,Mon Jul 13 22:04:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll ever be in the Derby... He doesn't seem like the type to relish in the spot light or scream to the masses ""look what i can do! "" He's the living personification of Teddy Roosevelt's quote ""speak softly and carry a big stick."" I don't know if I even want to see him do the Derby, it really screws with your swing and takes about a month to fix afterwards. That's why you don't see players in it that have something to lose (trout, miggy, etc)."
azdiamondbacks,3d4eyu,Antarix,3,Mon Jul 13 23:13:22 2015 UTC,"I think if the organization ASKED him to do it as sort of a publicity thing, he'd consider it, but he's said what concerns him is changing his swing. There's a big difference between swinging the bat to his the living shit out of the ball, like you would in the Derby, and swinging to make good contact, the way Goldy does in games, and how he comes across his homers.   Even if you watch him in BP, he really doesn't hit the ball out of the park that much. He usually is just shooting the ball around the field. It's only once the game starts that any ball he hits really leaves the park."
azdiamondbacks,3d4eyu,sparcos,3,Tue Jul 14 16:16:07 2015 UTC,We should make a list of players that left us and see how they're doing since they left.  Edit: Gone DBacks: Where are they now?
azdiamondbacks,3d4eyu,Sub116610,3,Mon Jul 13 22:05:52 2015 UTC,"Stephen Drew is absolutely pathetic in New York, Chris Young isn't doing too bad in the big apple though"
azdiamondbacks,3d3cke,Antarix,3,Mon Jul 13 04:50:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is a playoff team so I don't want to make a BIG move.   I just want to get Hill off the roster. He had a couple great years here, but now it looks like there is nothing left in the tank for him offensively. He always has been either very good or very bad season to season, and the last two years we have the very bad Hill. Except before he was young enough that you would think he could return to form. Not the case anymore.  I don't know what any option here would be, but if there is some buy-low pitcher on the market I'd be interested in that. Someone who is young but is struggling and has enough upside that they could make a decent reclamation project."
azdiamondbacks,3d3cke,joecb91,2,Mon Jul 13 18:49:06 2015 UTC,"That's basically what the idea was behind the Hellickson trade. Buy low on a high upside guy and sorta roll the dice on him. With the Padres making it known that they're shopping Shields, I would THINK that if we're gonna get into the mix for a pitcher via trade, we'd go for him over guys like Zimmerman or Queto."
azdiamondbacks,3d3cke,Costigan,3,Mon Jul 13 18:52:14 2015 UTC,"They're in an interesting position, and I agree: getting a top pitcher will just get them INTO the playoffs, not help them make any noise once they're there.   I'm curious what the value is on some of their ""non-essential"" players. Could they get anything beyond cap relief for Hill? What about Perez?   As for Hellickson, what could they realistically get for him? He's a frustrating case because after his lackluster start the Dbacks may not be able to get the value they initially traded away for him back.   Other questions are, is Peralta on the trading block? Are the Dbacks happy with Castillo as their catcher going forward? Could a team pry away Owings or Ahmed (since we've got Drury out in Reno?)"
azdiamondbacks,3d3cke,elbanofeliz,3,Mon Jul 13 05:16:08 2015 UTC,"What could the team get for Hill? Not a lot. He'd would bring a team a good veteran presence, but other than that, his on the field contribution is pretty meh. Plays good defense at 3rd and 2nd, but doesn't give you a whole lot at the dish. As for Perez, he's seen a significant upswing in his performance so he should get be significantly more valuable than he was say 6 weeks ago. I'm not as keen to get rid of him.  I would THINK that Hellickson would have move value now than he did when the D'backs traded for him from the Rays. He had a really awful start, but has since shown some signs of returning to form. We gave up two top 15 prospects for him, so we could expect to get more than that back.  Peralta COULD be on the trading block. The trouble for the team right now is, we have 4 outfielders, but no 4th outfielder. Peralta is proving that he can hit lefties, thus making him an everyday option.   I think for now, the D'backs should be more than happy with what Castillo has given them at catcher. He calls an excellent game, plays above average defense and has shown that he has some pop. I'd think that next year, it'd be Castillo catching every day, with Tuffy serving as back up, while Hernandez gets a little more time in the minors to let his bat develop some.  Stewart has flat out said that he's not looking to trade Ahmed and isn't really inclined to trade Owings either. But we've seen Stewart say one thing, then do another, but I really doubt we'll see him move either of them."
azdiamondbacks,3d3cke,elbanofeliz,2,Mon Jul 13 06:06:43 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately Hernandez is a rule 5 pick so he can't play in the minors except for rehab games. That's why he's been chilling on the bench and warming up pitchers this past week. I also think that they're just waiting for Hill to get on a little mini hot streak so that some team will be tempted to pick him up.   Overall, I would be shocked if they make any meaningful moves at the major league level. This team looks like it's heading in the right direction with the core of players we have on the roster and in AAA and AA right now. I would love for them to just sit tight for the most part and see where the roster takes us this year and evaluate in November."
azdiamondbacks,3d3cke,mrana,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:30:13 2015 UTC,"Hernandez only has to stay on the 25 man roster the year after he is taken in the Rule 5 draft, then he has to spend 90 days on the full roster. After this season, he's our player, and we can do whatever we want with him.   The way the FO worked it out was actually pretty brilliant. The day the activated him (July 4th) is exactly 90 days until the last day of the season."
azdiamondbacks,3d3cke,parker_dub,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:55:43 2015 UTC,"Oh nice I wasn't aware that you can do whatever you want with him after 90 days, that is pretty savvy by our FO. I hope they can find him a start here or there this year just to get his feet wet."
azdiamondbacks,3d3cke,parker_dub,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:11:36 2015 UTC,"Well, we can't so much do whatever we want with him after 90 days so to say. It's more like, if Hernandez is healthy, he has to be on the 25 man roster. If he gets hurt, he can go on the DL and play rehab games in the minors, but he also has to spend a minimum of 90 days in the majors the year he is taken in the Rule 5 draft. If he's not on the 25 man roster for at least 90 days, he gets sent back to his original team.   It's basically a means to keep teams from just taking guys in the Rule 5 draft, then just sticking them on the 60 day DL and holding on to them with no consequences."
azdiamondbacks,3d3cke,parker_dub,2,Tue Jul 14 04:42:36 2015 UTC,They are five games out of the wild card.  They shouldn't even think of buying.

Ok then: ride to Priest, charge my headphones, cool off, watch a little bit of the game and then ride back to Four Peaks.  Fuck. That.

azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,bp9801,4,Sun Jul 12 18:09:21 2015 UTC,Goldy says fuck your HR magic
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,brandonatron,5,Sun Jul 12 18:11:48 2015 UTC,Hahahaha you can only laugh at this stage.
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,Sandygonads,3,Sun Jul 12 18:39:41 2015 UTC,Tie game! Time to keep the Mets there and get some offense rolling!
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,bp9801,3,Sun Jul 12 17:52:39 2015 UTC,Dammit. So much for that tie game.
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,bp9801,3,Sun Jul 12 17:56:00 2015 UTC,Confirmed. That was a home run.
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,brandonatron,3,Sun Jul 12 17:57:06 2015 UTC,worst series of the year for sure.
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,jb420phx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:01:50 2015 UTC,I still think the Phillies series was more depressing
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,giantjensen,3,Sun Jul 12 18:52:23 2015 UTC,"Also, this is the problem with having such a young team across the board. They are bound to wear down as the season progresses"
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,Sandygonads,3,Sun Jul 12 18:03:41 2015 UTC,If we lose 4-2 again im going to be so sad
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,edtehgar,7,Sun Jul 12 18:25:05 2015 UTC,"Well, we can't lose 4-2 now"
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,Teb-Tenggeri,2,Sun Jul 12 18:39:56 2015 UTC,blame it on the voodoo
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,brandonatron,3,Sun Jul 12 18:25:50 2015 UTC,Seriously?
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,bp9801,3,Sun Jul 12 18:39:00 2015 UTC,Magic fairy dust confirmed
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,brandonatron,3,Sun Jul 12 18:40:49 2015 UTC,"What makes this worse is we caught up with the Giants and now they are gonna sweep the Phillies, and we're going to be 3 games behind them again"
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,giantjensen,3,Sun Jul 12 18:54:12 2015 UTC,THE GOAT
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,ilonzo,4,Sun Jul 12 19:06:42 2015 UTC,"That's pretty embarrassing. I was positive going into this series, but our pitching staff took my positivity and put it in the seats. Can't wait for the post on r/baseball... Mets blah blah blah HRs"
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,brandonatron,2,Sun Jul 12 18:06:14 2015 UTC,Lol I feel for you. I am also expecting said post and for it to be  from Senor_Met

azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,Desertstarr,2,Mon Jul 13 13:42:37 2015 UTC,Home-runs like that is why we can't have nice things.
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,FaultyTerror,2,Sun Jul 12 17:39:51 2015 UTC,"That's obviously a home run, stop wasting time"
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,Teb-Tenggeri,2,Sun Jul 12 17:44:43 2015 UTC,So many freaking homers given up in this series.
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,bp9801,2,Sun Jul 12 17:49:07 2015 UTC,"Nice hit, Wings!"
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,bp9801,2,Sun Jul 12 17:49:15 2015 UTC,We finally bunted someone to third!!!!!
azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,brandonatron,2,Sun Jul 12 17:50:51 2015 UTC,that's just ridiculous.. what a fucking shit way to go into the break

azdiamondbacks,3d0ptx,ilonzo,2,Sun Jul 12 19:50:12 2015 UTC,Hey guys they say home is where the heart is.  Today home is where the heat is because it is 100 degrees here today with humidity so I'm basically in AZ.  Yup this is how the series is going to be.

azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,SnakeBot,6,Sat Jul 11 18:17:15 2015 UTC,Corbin back at it. Let's keep above .500 with the next 2 wins into the all star break and I'll be a happy man.
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,skeletor19,6,Sat Jul 11 19:07:24 2015 UTC,Just 1 game under .500 things
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,thekeymaker,5,Sat Jul 11 21:35:19 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what you guys are seeing but that ball clearly went over the orange line.
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,skeletor19,5,Sat Jul 11 21:37:12 2015 UTC,Let's win all the games before the break please 😶
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,HolyCelestia,4,Sat Jul 11 19:59:15 2015 UTC,Goldy has been worrying me lately. Perhaps the break is just what he needs to get back on track.
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,skeletor19,2,Sat Jul 11 20:15:01 2015 UTC,"He does seem to be pressing a lot. Trying to do too much, when he just needs to sit back and wait. Maybe he can get some advice from one of the guys at the ASG, different voice or opinion."
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,bp9801,3,Sat Jul 11 20:21:11 2015 UTC,This should be a good one

azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,ilonzo,3,Sat Jul 11 20:14:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, missed the first inning to do some dishes and we're already up 2-0?"
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,giantjensen,4,Sat Jul 11 20:19:13 2015 UTC,AJ walked and then Peralta unloaded on the first pitch he saw.

azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,skeletor19,2,Sat Jul 11 20:35:53 2015 UTC,Definitely in a mini-slump right now. Cant wait to see who he decides to crush when he breaks out of it.
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,jb420phx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:49:11 2015 UTC,We get the Giants right after the break. Perfect timing?

azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,TheAviator4,2,Sat Jul 11 22:37:54 2015 UTC,And Harvey walks Corbin to bring up AJ!
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,bp9801,2,Sat Jul 11 20:08:10 2015 UTC,"8 pitch at bat with a walk, way to go Corbin!"
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,giantjensen,2,Sat Jul 11 20:36:06 2015 UTC,Amazing AB
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,ilonzo,2,Sat Jul 11 20:36:32 2015 UTC,Corbin looked good at the plate there.
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,TheAviator4,2,Sat Jul 11 20:36:35 2015 UTC,We got him on the ropes
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,ilonzo,2,Sat Jul 11 20:36:46 2015 UTC,Productive inning
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,ilonzo,2,Sat Jul 11 20:38:03 2015 UTC,Corbin throwing that fire!
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,TheAviator4,2,Sat Jul 11 20:39:25 2015 UTC,Corbin looks so good I wanna cry

azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,ThisMachineKILLS,2,Sat Jul 11 20:51:50 2015 UTC,Corbin is killing it so far.
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,skeletor19,2,Sat Jul 11 20:52:18 2015 UTC,God damn how many times are we gonna get thrown out before Goldy comes up?

azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,amperx11,2,Sat Jul 11 22:09:52 2015 UTC,Let's go  We'll yell at him
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,ilonzo,2,Sat Jul 11 22:15:33 2015 UTC,"The last 2 games have been really awful, hopefully we can win tomorrow"
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,giantjensen,2,Sat Jul 11 22:30:04 2015 UTC,Yeah that one is coming back
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,ilonzo,4,Sat Jul 11 22:36:51 2015 UTC,I have no idea why it would. It clears the line easily.
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,skeletor19,2,Sat Jul 11 21:31:32 2015 UTC,After that slowed down angle they just showed you're probably right

azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,xSaintJimmy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:45:59 2015 UTC,Going to have to wake up early tomorrow for that one.
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,bp9801,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:46:38 2015 UTC,Damn. This lack of offense is brutal.

azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,giantjensen,3,Sat Jul 11 22:36:02 2015 UTC,"Anything over the orange line is a HR at Citi, that railing thing isn't the official wall"

azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,thekeymaker,0,Sat Jul 11 21:40:21 2015 UTC,How are we worse than probably the worst offense in the NL?
azdiamondbacks,3cxmxf,HolyCelestia,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:35:31 2015 UTC,Because our pitching staff is really good and yours isn't?
azdiamondbacks,3cygp8,SnakeBot,6,Sat Jul 11 22:39:28 2015 UTC,Well the good news is you all are wonderful people
azdiamondbacks,3cygp8,brandonatron,4,Sat Jul 11 22:41:19 2015 UTC,Not exactly sure why but these last few losses have been rough on me
azdiamondbacks,3cygp8,ilonzo,5,Sat Jul 11 23:01:08 2015 UTC,Cause we had just reached .500?
azdiamondbacks,3cygp8,rootfiend,2,Sun Jul 12 02:24:55 2015 UTC,Haha well obviously that's part of it too
azdiamondbacks,3cygp8,ilonzo,3,Sun Jul 12 02:47:35 2015 UTC,"As nice as the Rockies/Rangers games were (besides Gallardo, I expected 5+ runs scored in all of those games though), I wanted to see what happened against this MUCH TOUGHER pitching test with Harvey and Thor before I bought into the contender talk, and so far the offense hasn't really handled that test well. As nice as this season has been so far, I still need to see more before I buy into them being a playoff team. Pitching is still an issue.  Corbin looked nice for a while though, but seems like his stamina isn't really back yet. Might have been better off with a couple more rehab starts, but he has looked better than I expected before he started to wear down.  As for the Harvey HR, I thought it was a HR the entire time. The guy reached over the fence, but it looked like it would have clearly hit above the orange line anyway. Maybe Peralta could have drawn fan interference if he tried to jump for the ball."
azdiamondbacks,3cygp8,joecb91,3,Sat Jul 11 22:52:28 2015 UTC,it seems like we played the same game twice...

azdiamondbacks,3cygp8,lava172,2,Sat Jul 11 22:40:31 2015 UTC,Heartbreaking loss

azdiamondbacks,3cmvvo,GGoodman09,3,Thu Jul 9 14:18:37 2015 UTC,"I just want to high-five everyone here at my office, but none of them are into baseball dammit!"
azdiamondbacks,3cmvvo,BransonAllen,2,Thu Jul 9 17:33:22 2015 UTC,DO IT ANYWAY.
azdiamondbacks,3cmvvo,beaviscow,2,Thu Jul 9 19:16:52 2015 UTC,WE 500 NOW!
azdiamondbacks,3co75o,mbarnar,7,Thu Jul 9 12:59:53 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt that we sweep the Mets right now, but we might be able to take 2"
azdiamondbacks,3co75o,Teb-Tenggeri,4,Thu Jul 9 16:30:41 2015 UTC,Anderson Corbin and DLR right? Not to mention Mets have slowed down a bit.  Not a bad lineup for it
azdiamondbacks,3co75o,hellasickbro,3,Thu Jul 9 16:56:05 2015 UTC,"As long as our offense keeps producing, I like our chances against the Mets. Our pitching is definitely capable of containing them (assuming Corbin stays on track and our bullpen keeps it up).  It will be a tough series, though. Matz and Syndergaard dominated in their last starts against the Dodgers and Harvey has been consistently decent. These pitching matchups should be fun to watch."
azdiamondbacks,3co75o,Thiswas_a_valued_rug,3,Thu Jul 9 17:54:12 2015 UTC,"Local radio is STILL talking about how this has been a nice surprise but we won't make the playoffs this year...I don't get it.  Its simple, if our offense keeps pace and our pitching improves, we have a very good shot."
azdiamondbacks,3copzx,Mike_Litoris211,4,Thu Jul 9 15:34:13 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the front office is interested in Cole Hammels at all. He's on contract though 2018, with a team option for 2019. But he's making $23.5 mil per year, so probably too expensive for the Dbacks. Would probably cost us a lot too."
azdiamondbacks,3copzx,akj80,4,Thu Jul 9 18:06:49 2015 UTC,"I think they need to make a big run at Hamels. He can be a true staff ace and his contract isn't even that bad considering what pitchers of his caliber are going to be getting in FA in the next few years. With him and Corbin (hopefully) anchoring the rotation, this team could actually contend this year."
azdiamondbacks,3copzx,bflynn65,3,Thu Jul 9 20:39:08 2015 UTC,"The only player is like them to pursue aggressively is Chris Sale. Not sure what it would take to get him. He's young enough to be a long term player here, and that slider is just downright dirty... seriously, i feel like i need to shower after i watch him pitch. What do you think it would take to get him?"
azdiamondbacks,3copzx,Soon2barmn,6,Thu Jul 9 18:55:50 2015 UTC,I don't think the White Sox get rid of Chris Sale.
azdiamondbacks,3copzx,HometownJuke,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:01:43 2015 UTC,"The team is in an aboslute tailspin right now, and it doesn't look like they're gonna be able to come out of it in the near future in the way that the D'backs seem to have between 2014 and 2015.   Of all the teams that I think need to blow everything up and start over, the Rockies are #1, the Padres are #2, and the White Sox are close behind at #3."
azdiamondbacks,3copzx,Antarix,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:56:52 2015 UTC,"Boeing things up means trading vets, not cutting cy candidates that have four years left at half of the market rate."
azdiamondbacks,3copzx,mrana,4,Sat Jul 11 05:27:06 2015 UTC,"If the only player you're okay with trading for is one of the top 5 best pitchers in baseball and only 26 years old, then you're going to be very disappointed."
azdiamondbacks,3copzx,akj80,3,Thu Jul 9 19:27:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not delusional, i know it would be costly. I think we could put a package together that could include Bradley/Shipley and O'Brian. I just think we're in desperate need of star power pitching if we're going to keep up in this division. We have the offense, and i think the bullpen would greatly benefit from an arm they know will give them 7 innings every 5th day."
azdiamondbacks,3copzx,Soon2barmn,3,Thu Jul 9 20:13:56 2015 UTC,What about cueto?
azdiamondbacks,3copzx,Soon2barmn,4,Thu Jul 9 20:17:25 2015 UTC,He's a rental player on his last year of his contact. We're not quite ready to start grabbing up rentals.
azdiamondbacks,3copzx,mrana,2,Thu Jul 9 20:22:48 2015 UTC,Stop. You don't trade a guy like that with four years left at well below market value for an inferior player on the dl.
azdiamondbacks,3copzx,Darkstargir,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:25:00 2015 UTC,It's going to take Shipley and Bradley and much more to get Sale.
azdiamondbacks,3copzx,mbarnar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:57:24 2015 UTC,Have white sox friends.. They said they will be very surprised if sale is still on the team after the deadline
azdiamondbacks,3copzx,Antarix,2,Sat Jul 11 02:57:02 2015 UTC,"I think for right now, the Front Office should continue to hold the course. They've made it no mystery that they intend to compete much sooner rather than later, but I look at what the Dodgers have, and I look at what other teams in the NL have, and I feel like down the stretch getting closer to the playoffs, I just don't think that we can compete with how young our club is and how many moving pieces we have in the minors still panning themselves out.   I wouldn't look at any of the top 5 prospects to being going anywhere. TLR and Stew have made it clear they they are committed to restocking the system with talent that is close to Major League ready, and I don't think that they should look to stray from that idea. The biggest pieces I could see getting moved are Aaron Hill, and maybe even Oliver Perez with Hellickson being a bit more of a longer shot.    The team has got an absolute mountain of money to invest this winter. I don't think that trading away prospects to compete for a play off spot with such a young core group of players will ultimate give a good result. I'd rather just sorta hold the course, spend the money in the off season, let our young guys get some more experience and make a strong run in 2016."
azdiamondbacks,3copzx,mrana,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:05:05 2015 UTC,Well said. The worst thing this team can do it get suckered into fake convention and trade prospects.  They are chasing several teams for a one game playoff.  That's not worth selling talent for rental players.

azdiamondbacks,3clrz6,mbarnar,3,Thu Jul 9 02:35:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not down on him because of the touki trade, I'm down on him because of his behavior around the trade  Edit:  The whole thing about him not valuing touki as high as other teams, I'm fine with that, he knows more about the situation than anyone else. But if everyone else in the league thinks he's the second coming of Christ then he should have kept quiet about whatever issues he knew about with him so that his trade value would stay high."

azdiamondbacks,3clrz6,jb420phx,5,Thu Jul 9 01:35:28 2015 UTC,Dbacks finding ways to blow our best .500 opportunity yet. This is absolutely depressing.
azdiamondbacks,3clrz6,jb420phx,2,Thu Jul 9 01:38:20 2015 UTC,you know once we get to .500 we'll need to win again to stay there right... take it off the pedestal

azdiamondbacks,3clrz6,-Lysosome-,5,Thu Jul 9 02:05:19 2015 UTC,Why would he get the win?
azdiamondbacks,3clrz6,cubman2000,4,Thu Jul 9 02:07:37 2015 UTC,i think starting pitcher has to pitch 5 innings to register for a win.. don't quote me on that
azdiamondbacks,3clrz6,sparcos,4,Thu Jul 9 02:08:59 2015 UTC,That is indeed correct
azdiamondbacks,3clrz6,xSaintJimmy,4,Thu Jul 9 02:16:06 2015 UTC,I'd have to look it up. That would make sense
azdiamondbacks,3clrz6,cubman2000,4,Thu Jul 9 02:12:18 2015 UTC,Chafin is another lefty who has issues with his offspeed stuff. Can't throw them for strikes.
azdiamondbacks,3clrz6,-Lysosome-,4,Thu Jul 9 02:34:13 2015 UTC,Bad outing for Chafin. Hopefully Randall can get out of this.
azdiamondbacks,3clrz6,jb420phx,3,Thu Jul 9 02:34:14 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure AJ Pollock would be my Patronus charm.
azdiamondbacks,3clrz6,jb420phx,4,Thu Jul 9 02:37:41 2015 UTC,Someone get Randall his glasses!

azdiamondbacks,3clrz6,jb420phx,2,Thu Jul 9 02:51:13 2015 UTC,Randall has been pretty solid in the bullpen all year. It's nice to see anyone we got from the Upton trade do well.

azdiamondbacks,3clrz6,cakelorldeath,2,Thu Jul 9 03:09:50 2015 UTC,I see a spot on Hellickson's right upper leg that he keeps touching. Looks like I found where he keeps his pine tar!

azdiamondbacks,3chfpo,HometownJuke,3,Wed Jul 8 00:35:01 2015 UTC,right now he's like offensive poison
azdiamondbacks,3chfpo,thekeymaker,3,Wed Jul 8 00:38:53 2015 UTC,That was a Gonzo-esque 2001 Blooper. I'll take it!

azdiamondbacks,3chfpo,andrew02020,3,Wed Jul 8 01:42:10 2015 UTC,That's what I'm saying. I don't like getting home from work in the 6th inning

azdiamondbacks,3chfpo,lazdiaz,2,Tue Jul 7 23:22:56 2015 UTC,Gallardo hasn't given up a run in his last 4 starts and has been dominant against us in his career. We've had at least 10 hits in the last 7 games. Who will prevail?
azdiamondbacks,3chfpo,-Lysosome-,2,Tue Jul 7 23:54:30 2015 UTC,"Get to him early, show we can hit em'. I'm good with that."
azdiamondbacks,3chfpo,parker_dub,2,Wed Jul 8 00:16:12 2015 UTC,So the DBacks are avg approx 9 hits per game for the life of the club

azdiamondbacks,3c9lvf,GGoodman09,6,Mon Jul 6 04:15:59 2015 UTC,"Until his 0-for-4 on Tuesday, Alex Rodriguez owned the last spot.    One ab nudged Arod. Whatever..."
azdiamondbacks,3c9lvf,brandonatron,4,Mon Jul 6 15:26:47 2015 UTC,"Regarding your title: No shit!  Learn basic layout for Christ's sake - All you have to do is move Goldy's title line to under the A-Rod paragraph.  It seems pretty basic - don't mention the subject until you're ready to talk about the subject.  It's an interesting article though.  Barring injury, they're projecting what could be a pretty amazing season for our Mr. Goldschmidt."
azdiamondbacks,3c9lvf,fatOLDwhiteGUY,3,Mon Jul 6 05:51:13 2015 UTC,"There was still a paragraph about Goldschmidt - which was as much as any other person on the list - after it explained why A-Rod just missed the final spot on the list.   As for the actual 10th-place overperformer, Goldschmidt: Just when we think we’re properly appreciating him, he levels up and makes himself underrated again. Goldschmidt was already selective, but he has lowered his chase rate even further this season, to the point that only seven qualified hitters are less likely to offer at a pitch outside the strike zone. The result is a career-best walk-to-strikeout ratio, coupled with his usual hard contact. He has delivered higher than a .324 TAv in each of the past two seasons, so I believe he’ll be better than that for the rest of what’s looking like a classic age-27 peak. Historically speaking, betting against Goldschmidt hasn’t worked out well for anyone."
azdiamondbacks,3c83ph,giantjensen,9,Sun Jul 5 20:01:40 2015 UTC,"From what I understand the Dbacks couldn't have done anything with the signing spot anyways, so they pretty much got something for nothing."

Today is the exact midpoint of what was supposed to be a rebuilding year - does anyone else remember where the Diamondbacks were at the midway point of last season?  In last place at 33 - 48, 14 games out of first.    I don't give a solid shit about .500, I care that this team is only a game and a half out of second place!  This team is in the thick of it and we all know it probably won't last, so enjoy it.  Last year, we would have lost the last two games and never even sniffed .500."

He's kind of a corny old uncle, but not the one you're looking forward to seeing at Christmas.   I wouldn't be mad if they replaced him but I don't hate him or think he's a bad guy."

azdiamondbacks,3c5n4s,thekeymaker,3,Sun Jul 5 03:03:30 2015 UTC,the lag is worth not listening to them say every corbin strike was questionable.

azdiamondbacks,3c5n4s,brandonatron,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:09:04 2015 UTC,this was my strategy the other night but I ended up yelling at the announcers through my computer
azdiamondbacks,3c5n4s,thekeymaker,2,Sun Jul 5 03:22:39 2015 UTC,another 0-2 hit.. jesus corbin
azdiamondbacks,3c5n4s,thekeymaker,3,Sun Jul 5 03:02:30 2015 UTC,hits on 0-2 pitches hurt me physically
azdiamondbacks,3c5n4s,thekeymaker,2,Sun Jul 5 02:55:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, Dusty.   You tried."
azdiamondbacks,3c5n4s,ellius,6,Sun Jul 5 02:54:26 2015 UTC,Fastball command looks good. Not many sliders so far. Probably for the first time through order.
azdiamondbacks,3c5n4s,-Lysosome-,6,Sun Jul 5 02:47:27 2015 UTC,Corbin looking pretty good so far! Seems like he's putting the ball where he wants
azdiamondbacks,3c5n4s,ThisMachineKILLS,4,Sun Jul 5 02:47:20 2015 UTC,"Hey, Wings didn't strike out w/ RISP!"

azdiamondbacks,3c5n4s,andrew02020,5,Sun Jul 5 02:29:30 2015 UTC,"Do you think they would ever put Goldy back as a clean up hitter? I like Ahmed hitting 1st or 2nd over Peralta, when Ender gets back I assume he'll be hitting 1st again"
azdiamondbacks,3c5n4s,giantjensen,4,Sun Jul 5 02:28:45 2015 UTC,I was thinking Ahmed/Pollock/Peralta/Goldy/Tomás
azdiamondbacks,3c5n4s,andrew02020,3,Sun Jul 5 02:30:28 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking, when Ender gets back put him second and Pollock third, he has the power, and Goldy to clean it up"
azdiamondbacks,3c5n4s,giantjensen,2,Sun Jul 5 02:33:47 2015 UTC,"#2 has the most high leverage situations of any spot in the order other than cleanup, which is why I think Pollock should be there. /#3 is overrated in terms of importance which is why I'd put Tomas at 5th to protect Goldy. It's still important though, so I'd put Peralta at 3rd. And Ahmed can run the bases and hopefully he's been getting better and this isn't just a hot streak."
azdiamondbacks,3c5n4s,andrew02020,3,Sun Jul 5 02:37:42 2015 UTC,Why is Ahmed behind Wings and Salty? He's been good lately.
azdiamondbacks,3c5n4s,andrew02020,2,Sun Jul 5 02:25:29 2015 UTC,Bring the hurt
azdiamondbacks,3c3tjy,go_dbacks,6,Sat Jul 4 14:33:14 2015 UTC,That slider.... yummy

azdiamondbacks,3c2qdp,Morandred,3,Sat Jul 4 05:22:07 2015 UTC,Hell of a win pulled out tonight! Fantastic to see it from the bottom of the order.
azdiamondbacks,3c2qdp,bp9801,3,Sat Jul 4 05:22:17 2015 UTC,Was at the game in LF. Didn't appear to any of us by the replays we saw that Pollock was out at 2nd. How did it look on the broadcast?
azdiamondbacks,3c2qdp,jacksonvstheworld,2,Sat Jul 4 06:15:03 2015 UTC,"Caught the game in LF too, did ya hear the guy who tried to start the wave like 20 times?"
azdiamondbacks,3c2qdp,whynotjohnzoidberg,4,Sat Jul 4 06:18:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was watching him. And he was booing the third base side every time they didn't do it haha. I think the wave is stupid so I enjoyed his frustration."

azdiamondbacks,3c2qdp,justaboxinacage,9,Sat Jul 4 05:22:56 2015 UTC,I don't really think so. It's practically a sudden death situation. I want see them get jazzed when they come through
azdiamondbacks,3c2qdp,cakelorldeath,5,Sat Jul 4 05:25:20 2015 UTC,Every walkoff win the Nats pour chocolate syrup on the winner's head.
azdiamondbacks,3c2qdp,andrew02020,3,Sat Jul 4 05:28:55 2015 UTC,"That's fine, get jazzed and all. I guess it's the fact that it almost seems mandatory, they never don't celebrate like that anymore. It seems so non-spontaneous that I don't get into it anymore.  p.s.  I'm talking about baseball in general, not the D-backs specifically."
azdiamondbacks,3c2qdp,justaboxinacage,2,Sat Jul 4 05:29:36 2015 UTC,The walk off walk celebrations are always pretty muted.   And when somebody won on a walk off balk against the Rangers earlier this season those celebrations were pretty low key.

azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,andrew02020,3,Sat Jul 4 01:35:52 2015 UTC,That's Sad Timmy. If you look closely you can see the sadness in Timmy's face after an encounter with GoldTitties.
azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,brandonatron,4,Sat Jul 4 01:38:32 2015 UTC,Oh ok I was confused about that.  Edit: What ever happened to big time Timmy Jim? He's been shite for the last like 4 years.
azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,andrew02020,4,Sat Jul 4 01:39:25 2015 UTC,Safe
azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,inevitablescape,5,Sat Jul 4 03:12:29 2015 UTC,How can they overturn that? Not conclusive at all
azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,giantjensen,4,Sat Jul 4 03:15:37 2015 UTC,was safe
azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,adventurepony,4,Sat Jul 4 03:16:45 2015 UTC,"I'm at the game. Can someone explain that review? Ever replay showed here, it was a clear he was safe."
azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,kittypoop,3,Sat Jul 4 03:18:00 2015 UTC,I'm here too and we only got one look at it but he looked to be clearly safe
azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,dbacksfordays,5,Sat Jul 4 03:18:48 2015 UTC,Looked like there was a chance he was out but no definitive evidence in my opinion
azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,cubman2000,4,Sat Jul 4 03:20:08 2015 UTC,"Some bullshit is what it was. Somehow he was called out, despite being safe the entire time. General NY fuckery."
azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,bp9801,4,Sat Jul 4 03:20:19 2015 UTC,Brenly and Berthiaume are saying they can't find evidence either
azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,Teb-Tenggeri,3,Sat Jul 4 03:21:35 2015 UTC,AJ got thrown out? I didn't see that.

azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,andrew02020,5,Sat Jul 4 04:32:14 2015 UTC,Nice quick inning by Ziggy.
azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,bp9801,4,Sat Jul 4 04:36:58 2015 UTC,Since the first inning the Rockies only have 1 bloop single by Tulo.
azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,-Lysosome-,4,Sat Jul 4 04:38:52 2015 UTC,I think this is the first time I have seen the inning start out with a pitcher change
azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,giantjensen,5,Sat Jul 4 04:39:54 2015 UTC,Ahmed has the only walk-off hit this year right?
azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,-Lysosome-,3,Sat Jul 4 04:40:55 2015 UTC,Shiiiiiiiii AJ Pollack at Tempe Marketplace. I'm there
azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,cakelorldeath,3,Sat Jul 4 04:41:40 2015 UTC,With a tie game going and a possible extra inning game the last thing you want to do is burn a pitcher without throwing a pitch. I'm really not sure what that manager was thinking.

azdiamondbacks,3c1zfz,thekeymaker,3,Sat Jul 4 01:43:55 2015 UTC,It's really discouraging to turn on games because all of them lately we've given up a run or two in the first couple innings..

azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,-Lysosome-,3,Fri Jul 3 03:40:34 2015 UTC,He really worked that count. Best at bat I've seen in years. So patient.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 03:41:25 2015 UTC,"Well, he could've swung like Cabrera did years ago."
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,-Lysosome-,5,Fri Jul 3 03:43:50 2015 UTC,J-Hell has been absolutely sensational today. Well done sir.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,jb420phx,5,Fri Jul 3 03:49:46 2015 UTC,"Best performance of the year by Hellickson probably. Never pitched into the 8th, I think."
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,-Lysosome-,3,Fri Jul 3 03:50:45 2015 UTC,How many pitches was he at? He's absolutely dealing tonight
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,sparcos,5,Fri Jul 3 03:51:43 2015 UTC,87.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,-Lysosome-,6,Fri Jul 3 03:52:46 2015 UTC,And the Rockies deal with Goldy by walking him. Typical.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,4,Fri Jul 3 03:58:07 2015 UTC,Á
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bombld,6,Fri Jul 3 03:59:23 2015 UTC,Offense! From A-a-ron!
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,5,Fri Jul 3 04:06:24 2015 UTC,/r/azdiamondbacks plz don't go dark.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,2,Fri Jul 3 04:30:07 2015 UTC,I watched Miley today. He issued 7 walks in 5 innings after his team gave him 8-0 lead in the 1st. He gave up 4 runs in the 2nd but that was it. Weird game.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,-Lysosome-,6,Fri Jul 3 01:36:39 2015 UTC,why steal third you fucking idiot?
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,brandonatron,2,Fri Jul 3 01:57:21 2015 UTC,Who did what? Missed it.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,ellius,2,Fri Jul 3 02:08:07 2015 UTC,"Ahmed is on 2nd with Goldy at the plate. Ahmed tries to steal 3rd like a dick, gets caught... Goldy singles. Scoring position with the best hitter... hmmmm. better get third. LOGIC SUCKS."
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,brandonatron,2,Fri Jul 3 02:10:52 2015 UTC,Ouch.   Must have desperately wanted the Sac Fly or infield hit scoring oportunity.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,ellius,4,Fri Jul 3 02:13:47 2015 UTC,Im not really a Hellickson fan but that was a wonderful job stranding the runner at second with no outs.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,jb420phx,6,Fri Jul 3 02:09:57 2015 UTC,why do we always make this cunt Rusin look like Nolan Ryan
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,thekeymaker,5,Fri Jul 3 02:16:12 2015 UTC,"I mean compare to other Rockies pitchers he is Nolan Ryan, kinda"
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,jfoster15,4,Fri Jul 3 02:24:50 2015 UTC,inb4 owings doesnt get the ball out of the infield
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,thekeymaker,3,Fri Jul 3 02:23:08 2015 UTC,He didn't even get it out of the batters box
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,TheJerzeyDragon,5,Fri Jul 3 02:25:22 2015 UTC,So do you guys like these uniforms or your current ones better? I like these way more for you guys.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,jfoster15,6,Fri Jul 3 02:27:06 2015 UTC,I think the consensus is that everyone misses the purple & teal
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,thekeymaker,5,Fri Jul 3 02:27:58 2015 UTC,Purple and teal are best uniforms.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 02:29:16 2015 UTC,My stream is way behind. Haven't eve gotten to the 3rd out yet my phone told me the innings over.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,jfoster15,4,Fri Jul 3 02:31:26 2015 UTC,They're into the next inning now
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,TheJerzeyDragon,3,Fri Jul 3 02:31:59 2015 UTC,Welp...this is what happens when you're in a GDT by yourself.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,jfoster15,3,Fri Jul 3 02:32:49 2015 UTC,How is that chick that's calling your game doing?
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 02:33:25 2015 UTC,She's on radio which I'm not listening to. But she's awesome and very smart. I'm sure he's doing a great job.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,jfoster15,3,Fri Jul 3 02:34:53 2015 UTC,What does she usually do?
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 02:35:45 2015 UTC,Whenever I go to make a sandwich we score so I'm off to make a #Rallysandwich
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 02:45:47 2015 UTC,Inb4 tomas homer  Edit:  almost
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,TheJerzeyDragon,4,Fri Jul 3 02:47:13 2015 UTC,"Hey, that was close. Want to not do that? Thanks."
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,jfoster15,4,Fri Jul 3 02:49:15 2015 UTC,"oh my god rusin, pls die"
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,thekeymaker,3,Fri Jul 3 03:00:24 2015 UTC,This sandwich tastes like sadness now.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 03:04:56 2015 UTC,Add more bacon.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,5,Fri Jul 3 03:06:31 2015 UTC,Avocado makes everything nice as well
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,TheJerzeyDragon,3,Fri Jul 3 03:07:52 2015 UTC,Avocado and bacon make the world go round.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,4,Fri Jul 3 03:09:39 2015 UTC,Why don't they give Lamb a chance against lefties?
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,4,Fri Jul 3 03:08:29 2015 UTC,Scurred.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 03:09:09 2015 UTC,Why doesn't every team go sleeveless? It's fucking awesome.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,7,Fri Jul 3 03:11:07 2015 UTC,Abolish sleevery.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,HolyCelestia,4,Fri Jul 3 03:18:37 2015 UTC,"I think I already passed my summer class (51.5% currently) and I still have one final exam, one final project (which is going damn well) and one homework. I should be good to do absolutely nothing for the rest of summer right?"
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,HolyCelestia,3,Fri Jul 3 03:21:18 2015 UTC,"That's so funny. After a pitcher had a bad outing one of the O's announcers said ""I wonder if he stopped in the club house or went straight to triple A."""
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,5,Fri Jul 3 03:22:08 2015 UTC,Fuck yeah Pollack!
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,4,Fri Jul 3 03:29:45 2015 UTC,Love those line hits!
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,-Lysosome-,5,Fri Jul 3 03:39:37 2015 UTC,"Now Peralta is tied for the triples lead! Wooo, that was an unlucky bounce, any where else that might be an inside the park homer"
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,giantjensen,2,Fri Jul 3 03:40:28 2015 UTC,I fucking love David Peralta. What a story this guy is.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,jb420phx,6,Fri Jul 3 03:43:24 2015 UTC,"From Indy ball, to AA, straight to our hearts"
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,sparcos,3,Fri Jul 3 03:46:14 2015 UTC,You guys think the D-Backs will make any deadline moves?
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 03:50:16 2015 UTC,Probably trade hill and Reed if they find any takers
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,sparcos,4,Fri Jul 3 03:51:07 2015 UTC,AJ was really struggling last couple of weeks. Looks like he's out of it now.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,-Lysosome-,5,Fri Jul 3 03:55:54 2015 UTC,He's leading the league in walks? more than Bryce? got damn.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 03:58:48 2015 UTC,"62 for Goldy, 56 for Bryce."
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,4,Fri Jul 3 04:01:03 2015 UTC,I thought that was a foul at first. Impressive.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,-Lysosome-,5,Fri Jul 3 03:59:51 2015 UTC,Nothing like the Rockies bullpen to help you break out of a slump.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,jb420phx,4,Fri Jul 3 04:05:25 2015 UTC,If she's calling the game why isn't she talking?
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 04:05:52 2015 UTC,I think she's a color girl. Not much color for the Rockies right now.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,-Lysosome-,6,Fri Jul 3 04:08:03 2015 UTC,That's racist!!!!!!!!!!!!
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,GoldysMassiveArms,3,Fri Jul 3 04:11:09 2015 UTC,Nothing to talk about there.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,4,Fri Jul 3 04:07:43 2015 UTC,Wow this guy likes the loud outs.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 04:16:58 2015 UTC,Gotta make your butt pucker with every pitch.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,5,Fri Jul 3 04:18:55 2015 UTC,"2 Errors in a game, what's going on?"
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,giantjensen,5,Fri Jul 3 04:31:22 2015 UTC,DP!
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,5,Fri Jul 3 04:40:35 2015 UTC,If I walked as much as Goldy I wouldn't be so fat.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,Naukaloka,3,Fri Jul 3 03:58:02 2015 UTC,Kind of feel like Dbacks gonna go off this series.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,brandonatron,3,Fri Jul 3 01:04:48 2015 UTC,"holy shit, shea hillenbrand sighting."
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,sparcos,3,Fri Jul 3 01:18:55 2015 UTC,Took me this long in the season to realize I can download the mlbtv app on my xbox and watch on the TV instead of laptop :|  Anyways go Dbacks!! And LMA sign with the Suns!
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,mbarnar,2,Fri Jul 3 01:47:17 2015 UTC,"at this rate I just want him to sign with us to spite the Spurs, every comment I have seen is spurs fans acting like it's already a done deal and it's ridiculous to think he would go anywhere but the spurs!"
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,giantjensen,2,Fri Jul 3 01:54:29 2015 UTC,I want him cuz he's really really good.  But I like your idea too :D #fts
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,mbarnar,2,Fri Jul 3 01:57:38 2015 UTC,"That too, the suns would be really good with him, I just wanna hurt the spurs more right now!"
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,giantjensen,3,Fri Jul 3 02:04:26 2015 UTC,This is becoming a joke. No FSAZ stream available again. It's been weeks since last I watched a game with Steve&BB. Is there something wrong on mlb.tv?
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,-Lysosome-,3,Fri Jul 3 01:49:13 2015 UTC,bad base running for like the 3rd game in a row
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,sparcos,3,Fri Jul 3 01:56:05 2015 UTC,you have to be fucking kidding me
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,thekeymaker,3,Fri Jul 3 01:56:26 2015 UTC,ahmed isn't worth anything if he can't stay alive on the bases
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,thekeymaker,3,Fri Jul 3 01:56:43 2015 UTC,Stream  http://www.strikeout.co/baseball/312093/2/arizona-diamondbacks-vs-colorado-rockies-live-stream-online.html  make sure to have adblock on
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,TheWastedYearz,3,Fri Jul 3 01:56:54 2015 UTC,Hey DBacks fans. Very sad Mets fan here. Y'all got any of that offense we can have?
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,TheJerzeyDragon,2,Fri Jul 3 01:57:41 2015 UTC,not enough to float that 3 game series you guys just had. yikes.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,sparcos,2,Fri Jul 3 02:00:01 2015 UTC,Man I'm starting to think my kids little league team could've scored two runs in 29 innings off the cubs
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,TheJerzeyDragon,3,Fri Jul 3 02:01:00 2015 UTC,Just when I think we've hit our low point......we go lower. Gotta get this win tonight or I smell a losing streak coming.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,jb420phx,3,Fri Jul 3 01:59:06 2015 UTC,The NL West is so stacked.  I'm glad my team isn't in this division
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,TheJerzeyDragon,3,Fri Jul 3 02:01:44 2015 UTC,What's the sentiment of berthiume and brenly?  They seem pretty solid as an announcing duo
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,TheJerzeyDragon,3,Fri Jul 3 02:08:12 2015 UTC,They're pretty good.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,2,Fri Jul 3 02:09:23 2015 UTC,BB is amazing. Bert has his moments.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 02:09:16 2015 UTC,So much reddit drama goin on...
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 02:08:22 2015 UTC,For the unawares: https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 02:09:28 2015 UTC,I find it hilarious how many comments complaining about reddit are getting guilded.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 02:11:06 2015 UTC,"It's a real fuck up, no doubt. Strange things afoot lately."
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 02:14:01 2015 UTC,"Ellen Pao, apparently"
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,TheJerzeyDragon,2,Fri Jul 3 02:15:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like with those hate subs being shut down. On /r/all after that, there were three posts in a row of punchable faces with her last name. Thought it was funny how it lined up that way, even on all."
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 02:17:38 2015 UTC,JHellYes so far!
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 02:10:06 2015 UTC,We're seeing lovely curveball from Hellickson lately.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,-Lysosome-,3,Fri Jul 3 02:11:23 2015 UTC,"""Close your eyes and swing."" That must be the mantra for some regardless of pinch hitting or not."
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 02:12:37 2015 UTC,That's what Ian Desmond does. He's even admitted it.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,2,Fri Jul 3 02:13:34 2015 UTC,I feel like my team has been doing this all week
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,TheJerzeyDragon,2,Fri Jul 3 02:14:18 2015 UTC,"20% of the time, it works every time. Or something."
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,2,Fri Jul 3 02:15:21 2015 UTC,He's had like four golden sombreros this season.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,2,Fri Jul 3 02:16:05 2015 UTC,Already? Mark Reynolds territory.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 02:18:18 2015 UTC,"Hellickson is jamming these guys so hard, they're going to start asking for lube soon"
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,TheJerzeyDragon,3,Fri Jul 3 02:19:47 2015 UTC,What did you guys give up to get hellickson?  I would've thought he'd be a big part of the Rays future...
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,TheJerzeyDragon,2,Fri Jul 3 02:21:17 2015 UTC,Couple of minor leaguers that are in A or High-A ball.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 02:22:32 2015 UTC,hellickson looks way more hitterish than owings
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,thekeymaker,3,Fri Jul 3 02:26:50 2015 UTC,How did Tulo miss that fastball down the middle?
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,-Lysosome-,3,Fri Jul 3 02:36:57 2015 UTC,Looked elevated out of my drunk eyeballs
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,brandonatron,3,Fri Jul 3 02:37:56 2015 UTC,He does that sometimes.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,jfoster15,3,Fri Jul 3 02:40:30 2015 UTC,Lol that's the second time today I've heard a player cursing on TV.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 02:37:02 2015 UTC,castillo is a hell of a defensive catcher. love the way he handles the pitchers
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,sparcos,3,Fri Jul 3 02:41:21 2015 UTC,I've been totally impressed with him. Both at and behind the plate.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 02:42:22 2015 UTC,This is the first time I've caught a game with Hellickson pitching. I am the Hellickson whisperer.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,Naukaloka,3,Fri Jul 3 02:44:27 2015 UTC,FLAIR UP
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,brandonatron,3,Fri Jul 3 02:45:03 2015 UTC,Gotta have hellickson flair then
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,TheJerzeyDragon,3,Fri Jul 3 02:46:28 2015 UTC,Does this mean I can't make anymore sandwiches?
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 02:53:08 2015 UTC,Y'all like hockey? My Caps are killing it in the off season right now.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,4,Fri Jul 3 02:55:04 2015 UTC,LGY  Antoine Vermette is back
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,brandonatron,3,Fri Jul 3 03:00:17 2015 UTC,ooo... sensitive subject sir! out team currently doesn't have an arena :P
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,sparcos,3,Fri Jul 3 02:56:10 2015 UTC,Think Ovechkin and Oshie will be ok?
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,jfoster15,3,Fri Jul 3 02:58:25 2015 UTC,"I was rather surprised to see Oshie traded, but hey, guess his open thoughts on the coaching staff meant a trade was going to get done at some point."
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 03:02:50 2015 UTC,"Guys, upvote the thread"
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,TheJerzeyDragon,3,Fri Jul 3 02:57:22 2015 UTC,checking in from vegas. i bet the dbacks to win the world series because 125:1.   this stretch of games isn't helping.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,parker_dub,3,Fri Jul 3 03:01:37 2015 UTC,"I'm either mentally challenged or there is no Hellickson flair, or both."
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,Naukaloka,3,Fri Jul 3 03:02:04 2015 UTC,Do your magic pls
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,brandonatron,3,Fri Jul 3 03:03:42 2015 UTC,There isn't any.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 03:03:51 2015 UTC,Is it bad that I feel like Hellickson has a better chance to get a hit over CO right now
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,giantjensen,3,Fri Jul 3 03:14:10 2015 UTC,I've gotten to the point where I trust Scherzer at bat more than I trust Ian Desmond so I get it.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,5,Fri Jul 3 03:14:45 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way about deGrom, Syndergaard, Matz and Harvey than my ENTIRE LINEUP"
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,TheJerzeyDragon,3,Fri Jul 3 03:16:49 2015 UTC,Ahmed needed more Wheaties.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 03:16:58 2015 UTC,The Rockies broadcast just had a stat showing Wilin Rosario is the active leader in BA against the DBacks. That seems completely odd to me.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,jfoster15,3,Fri Jul 3 03:22:10 2015 UTC,USA USA USA!!!
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 03:28:47 2015 UTC,Get pollock into the allstar game folks!

azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bombld,3,Fri Jul 3 03:30:03 2015 UTC,Yikes that pitch looked good
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,ThisMachineKILLS,3,Fri Jul 3 03:30:49 2015 UTC,Did we get any decent IFAs?
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 03:35:24 2015 UTC,Hill'll take that!
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 03:37:30 2015 UTC,PURPLEPOWERLUCK
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,cakelorldeath,3,Fri Jul 3 03:37:55 2015 UTC,BULL DRIVES THEM IN!!!
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 03:39:43 2015 UTC,How high up was Goldy when he was a prospect?
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 04:01:45 2015 UTC,"They weren't that High on him, didn't think he could produce as well in the majors as he was in the minors, and thought he would strike out too much."
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,giantjensen,3,Fri Jul 3 04:13:45 2015 UTC,/u/Naukaloka go get your tacos tomorrow!!
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,sparcos,3,Fri Jul 3 04:05:18 2015 UTC,Another line hit! Easy double!
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,-Lysosome-,3,Fri Jul 3 04:05:31 2015 UTC,another. base running. blunder.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,sparcos,3,Fri Jul 3 04:09:32 2015 UTC,They'll jinx Hellickson now.  Edit: Looks like he's out.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,-Lysosome-,3,Fri Jul 3 04:12:31 2015 UTC,"Yas went back as far as he could, and the ball found him."
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,bp9801,3,Fri Jul 3 04:16:00 2015 UTC,On that wild pitch someone in the background threw their hands up and distracted him while he was throwing it.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 04:18:29 2015 UTC,Lol at Dorn doing pulllups in the dugout.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 04:21:07 2015 UTC,Bad swing double down the line!
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,-Lysosome-,3,Fri Jul 3 04:24:19 2015 UTC,God damn those bitches are dimes
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,jb420phx,3,Fri Jul 3 04:27:47 2015 UTC,Lol they got an interesting angle there.

azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,andrew02020,3,Fri Jul 3 02:10:43 2015 UTC,They were testing out 7:10 to see if more people would come to the ballpark since it was later and people could just go to the park right after work. Now that it's summer they are going back to the regular time.
azdiamondbacks,3bxpo5,giantjensen,3,Fri Jul 3 02:12:58 2015 UTC,6:40 I think?

azdiamondbacks,3btick,brandonatron,2,Thu Jul 2 02:21:50 2015 UTC,Welp. There goes another one.
azdiamondbacks,3btick,jb420phx,2,Thu Jul 2 02:21:52 2015 UTC,Well this seems like a typical Dodgers-Arizona game
azdiamondbacks,3btick,giantjensen,2,Thu Jul 2 02:22:19 2015 UTC,This might be the worst game I've seen in years.   Painful. =(
azdiamondbacks,3btick,ellius,2,Thu Jul 2 02:22:57 2015 UTC,Lol did you watch Monday's game? Same situation by far not one of our worst
azdiamondbacks,3btick,cubman2000,2,Thu Jul 2 02:23:52 2015 UTC,"I've watched nearly every broadcast game for a decade. =P  It's not insurmountable or anything, they can still pull out a win.    It's just a super frustrating series of events so far. Ugly/Sloppy play."
azdiamondbacks,3btick,ellius,2,Thu Jul 2 02:33:05 2015 UTC,Well if that's so I've been to a worse game this year. I think 11-2 after 3 against kc this is not that bad
azdiamondbacks,3btick,cubman2000,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:42:07 2015 UTC,"When did we play KC this year?   Anyway, I'm just being hyperbolic here. I don't literally think it's the worst game ever played. My point isn't that it's the worst score or the biggest hole to dig out or anything.  It's just been a really frustrating combination of sloppy play and bad luck so far, that's all. I don't mind errors on a hard hit ball or anything, but watching poor baserunning and having your opponent find every gap gets to me.  It's not about the score, they're still very much in the game. I'm talking about the combination of the D'Backs' quality of play  and Dodger BABIP through the first few innings."
azdiamondbacks,3btick,ellius,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:03:16 2015 UTC,I don't remember who the other team was i just remember sitting in the stadium wondering if I should leave or not after 3 innings
azdiamondbacks,3btick,cubman2000,2,Thu Jul 2 03:11:42 2015 UTC,"It's a 4 run game in the top of the third, Not like we're down 20."
azdiamondbacks,3btick,giantjensen,2,Thu Jul 2 02:26:02 2015 UTC,I'm not saying they can't come back.   It's just been a bad combination of shit luck and TOOTBLANs. Really frustrating to watch.
azdiamondbacks,3btick,ellius,2,Thu Jul 2 02:30:27 2015 UTC,"Hey, at least it's not the mets-cubs game : )"
azdiamondbacks,3btick,ddt9,2,Thu Jul 2 02:27:08 2015 UTC,At least the broadcast team has recognized this isn't going to be fun to watch and have started pulling conversations with these guys
azdiamondbacks,3btick,cakelorldeath,2,Thu Jul 2 02:25:29 2015 UTC,"They should just talk to every pitcher possible. I'm rather enjoying Webby's conversation, with Joe chipping in every now and then."
azdiamondbacks,3btick,bp9801,2,Thu Jul 2 02:29:08 2015 UTC,Yep. They need to go grab Collmenter. Dude's hilarious
azdiamondbacks,3btick,cakelorldeath,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:42:38 2015 UTC,Oh totally. Love his interviews. Wonder who his traveling hands can be next...

azdiamondbacks,3btick,bp9801,2,Thu Jul 2 02:55:21 2015 UTC,everytine there's a long inning they should send a beer and a microphone to Grace in the dugout.
azdiamondbacks,3btick,notocho,2,Thu Jul 2 02:44:20 2015 UTC,"Haha, oh god."
azdiamondbacks,3btick,cakelorldeath,2,Thu Jul 2 02:46:54 2015 UTC,does this inning ever end?
azdiamondbacks,3btick,adventurepony,2,Thu Jul 2 02:28:25 2015 UTC,"Dear God, get some outs for fuck sake."
azdiamondbacks,3btick,brandonatron,2,Thu Jul 2 02:31:23 2015 UTC,"Oh god, that totally looked like a homer"

azdiamondbacks,3btick,cakelorldeath,2,Thu Jul 2 02:43:01 2015 UTC,Of course hill strikes out on the worst pitch ever
azdiamondbacks,3btick,giantjensen,2,Thu Jul 2 02:43:19 2015 UTC,Nice little 13ish pitch inning there
azdiamondbacks,3btick,cakelorldeath,2,Thu Jul 2 02:48:35 2015 UTC,DP!  Not like we could tell with that angle...
azdiamondbacks,3btick,bp9801,2,Thu Jul 2 02:49:00 2015 UTC,"yeah, someone in the control room was distracted"
azdiamondbacks,3btick,ddt9,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:50:12 2015 UTC,Totally. TV broadcast means we can see stuff happen and not always rely on the broadcasters.
azdiamondbacks,3btick,bp9801,2,Thu Jul 2 02:54:49 2015 UTC,"Hey, an extra base hit!"
azdiamondbacks,3btick,brandonatron,2,Thu Jul 2 02:54:22 2015 UTC,we're gonna have the most hits in a game without scoring a run at this rate
azdiamondbacks,3btick,giantjensen,2,Thu Jul 2 02:56:30 2015 UTC,Hahaha. Poor Webby
azdiamondbacks,3btick,cakelorldeath,2,Thu Jul 2 02:57:02 2015 UTC,Alright I feel dumb and to lazy to research. What am I missing with this webb stuff?
azdiamondbacks,3btick,cubman2000,3,Thu Jul 2 02:58:27 2015 UTC,"They had an at-bat of his against Atlanta, where Webby squared to bunt, then pulled back and swung away. He missed and ended up spinning all the way around in the box before falling down."
azdiamondbacks,3btick,bp9801,2,Thu Jul 2 03:03:13 2015 UTC,Ahh ok im at the game so no tv broadcast for me. I figured
azdiamondbacks,3btick,cubman2000,2,Thu Jul 2 03:10:11 2015 UTC,"Aha, yeah. Pitching night, so Webby and Borowski have been on air a bunch. Webby's up in the booth, Joe's roaming around. They've talked to Chase, JHell, Tuffy, Rubby, and Car Keys so far."
azdiamondbacks,3btick,bp9801,2,Thu Jul 2 03:15:06 2015 UTC,Haha well damn greg shulty(forgive my spelling)  has been broadcasting a great game. He just laid into Puigs stupidity last inning when he was on base
azdiamondbacks,3btick,cubman2000,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:25:23 2015 UTC,"lol, that is awesome. Puig did nearly get picked off there. TV broadcast just showed Puig picking up a rolled D'backs shirt that made its way to the field, pocketing it, and then tossing it at the guy he was playing catch with."
azdiamondbacks,3btick,bp9801,2,Thu Jul 2 03:29:13 2015 UTC,Yeah shulty was making fun. I think I just bought a miller lite that is clearly a blue moon. I hate these new stands that have 4 dollar value beers
azdiamondbacks,3btick,cubman2000,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:38:55 2015 UTC,"Haha, that is great.  Blue Moon seems like the better choice, no?"
azdiamondbacks,3btick,bp9801,2,Thu Jul 2 03:39:56 2015 UTC,Depends on what you like. Funny thing is i went up and told them it tasted different. They washed out my cup  and gave me coors light.
azdiamondbacks,3btick,cubman2000,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:45:52 2015 UTC,"Random carousel of beers, I guess."

azdiamondbacks,3btick,brandonatron,2,Thu Jul 2 03:11:40 2015 UTC,"Well, the Rays have been nearly no-hit in three straight games."
azdiamondbacks,3btick,bp9801,2,Thu Jul 2 03:12:19 2015 UTC,Standed!
azdiamondbacks,3btick,bp9801,2,Thu Jul 2 03:22:50 2015 UTC,Dbacks! Pick up your starter like we know you can! Stop being bums and snap out of it.

azdiamondbacks,3btick,bp9801,2,Thu Jul 2 03:38:07 2015 UTC,Ugly hop there on that wild pitch.
azdiamondbacks,3btick,bp9801,2,Thu Jul 2 03:40:44 2015 UTC,"Jesus Randall, end it."
azdiamondbacks,3btick,brandonatron,2,Thu Jul 2 03:41:45 2015 UTC,Let's make this as challenging as possible   the Dbacks

It's right on the street that the signs on the freeway tell you to take for the park and it's not that expensive. it's also directly across the street to the box office and main entrance."
azdiamondbacks,3bqlad,Raptor231408,5,Wed Jul 1 10:36:03 2015 UTC,"If you have tickets on the 200 level, park in the Chase Field Garage at 4th Street and Buchanan - $10, and you can walk across the bridge on the 3rd level to get to the ballpark.    If I don't park there I generally park in the Phoenix Convention Center garage ($12), north of the ballpark across Jefferson.  If coming from the East Valley, take Washington Street west.  Once you cross 7th Street, the garage will be on your left.  If coming from the West Valley, take Jefferson Street west east, once you cross 5th Street the garage will be on your left.  You can enter from either side, though here is a tidbit.  If you enter from Jefferson Street you can park on the second level and take the stairs.  If you enter from Washington Street they block the second level and route you up higher.    Have fun at the game, although I sincerely hope your team loses.  ;-)    Edit: west <> east"

Gerard Hernandez walked right over and asked where the kid got it, who replied he got it at Spring Training in AZ. He then asked him to name his price, and assured the kid he was serious!  Kid quickly replies that he'd part with it for some autographed batting gloves and a bat, so Gerard pops down into the clubhouse (and the kid get's Drabek's autograph in the interim) and comes back with the goods, signs it, poses for photos, and walks away with the shirt off the kid's back.  The things you see in a minor league stadium!"

azdiamondbacks,3bozch,-Lysosome-,2,Wed Jul 1 05:55:44 2015 UTC,"""Little overmatched."" Yeah, just a bit for Webster."
azdiamondbacks,3bozch,bp9801,2,Wed Jul 1 02:08:12 2015 UTC,Fucking Grandal.
azdiamondbacks,3bozch,bp9801,2,Wed Jul 1 02:09:55 2015 UTC,SAFE
azdiamondbacks,3bozch,go_dbacks,2,Wed Jul 1 02:36:03 2015 UTC,Totally. Ball is in the freaking air still when Rubby's foot hits the bag.
azdiamondbacks,3bozch,bp9801,2,Wed Jul 1 02:36:44 2015 UTC,I think Rubby beat that down the line.
azdiamondbacks,3bozch,bp9801,2,Wed Jul 1 02:36:07 2015 UTC,Hopefully we can capitalize soon...
azdiamondbacks,3bozch,go_dbacks,2,Wed Jul 1 02:51:49 2015 UTC,All these clubhouse problems with the LA teams.
azdiamondbacks,3bozch,bp9801,3,Wed Jul 1 02:54:06 2015 UTC,I don't understand what it is about money that makes athletes such divas  (probably since I don't have any)
azdiamondbacks,3bozch,go_dbacks,2,Wed Jul 1 02:54:47 2015 UTC,Anyone got a link to the story the ARI-FSA announcers are talking about?
azdiamondbacks,3boxhb,go_dbacks,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:27:50 2015 UTC,"Can't wait to see how Hernandez does. He's not gonna be impressive offensively, but I've heard great things about his defense and how well he calls games."
azdiamondbacks,3bp2yg,gin_rummie,2,Wed Jul 1 00:15:28 2015 UTC,"SeatGeek still sells tix, but it's very limited and maybe overpriced.  Edit: $17 for bleachers and $21 for lower level 1B(not bad at all). TN Direct looks like the broker."
azdiamondbacks,3bp2yg,kittypoop,2,Wed Jul 1 00:41:24 2015 UTC,"This pisses me off cause I wanted to buy tickets when I found out I could go short notice and the tickets were removed, I hope they put it back"
azdiamondbacks,3blqso,iamclev,7,Tue Jun 30 06:22:55 2015 UTC,"I would like to say, I'm actually from St. Louis, doing a west coast baseball trip. Out of the 21 stadiums I've been to so far, Chase Field is one of my favorites. And the fans were great."
azdiamondbacks,3blqso,AzWiLdCaT1988,2,Tue Jun 30 18:55:40 2015 UTC,Do you have a top 3?
azdiamondbacks,3blqso,AzWiLdCaT1988,3,Tue Jun 30 20:11:52 2015 UTC,"PNC Park, Pittsburgh- it is an amazing stadium, built on the river front with a wonderful view of the city.   2.Oriole Park at Camden Yards, Baltimore-  a wonderful park, plus the incorporation of Eutaw street and the warehouse across the street only makes it better.     Target Field, Minnesota-  a very new stadium that really changed it up. Located in a really nice area for a stadium, it uses an amazing  tan/beige stone to break the red brick cookie cutter.   If you were wondering Chase Field came in at a cool number 5 after Minute Maid Park in Houston."
azdiamondbacks,3blqso,AzWiLdCaT1988,2,Tue Jun 30 21:26:05 2015 UTC,PNC Park is one that I really wanna try to see a game at it just looks gorgeous. What about the worst stadium you've been to?
azdiamondbacks,3blqso,GoldysMassiveArms,3,Tue Jun 30 21:46:09 2015 UTC,"Tropicana Field, Tampa Bay- Originally built in 1990 as a generic all purpose stadium to attract an expansion team it wouldn't get until '98. It hosted an NHL team briefly. It generic-ness and age really show. They try to keep it updated, but at a very rough 25 years old, they need a new park to call home."
azdiamondbacks,3blmi5,SnakeBot,12,Tue Jun 30 05:33:50 2015 UTC,"My dreams came true, now to sweep the Dodgers!"
azdiamondbacks,3blmi5,giantjensen,4,Tue Jun 30 05:47:04 2015 UTC,I approve.
azdiamondbacks,3blmi5,Blast-Off-Girl,10,Tue Jun 30 06:17:22 2015 UTC,Thank you Snakes! Keep beating those Dodgers!
azdiamondbacks,3blmi5,Salamanderfs,10,Tue Jun 30 05:42:21 2015 UTC,Woo hoo!
azdiamondbacks,3blmi5,Blast-Off-Girl,10,Tue Jun 30 05:38:03 2015 UTC,"Huge, huge win."
azdiamondbacks,3blmi5,bp9801,8,Tue Jun 30 05:40:35 2015 UTC,Runs! Lots of runs!
azdiamondbacks,3blmi5,cakelorldeath,7,Tue Jun 30 05:47:14 2015 UTC,:D
azdiamondbacks,3blmi5,brandonatron,4,Tue Jun 30 05:41:30 2015 UTC,"Thought this was just going to be another one of those nights where they rolled over and died until the outburst after Bolsinger had to leave with the sugarless gummi bear shits.  And Allen Webster is just Cahill 2.0 at this point. Do not enjoy watching him at all, guess we all know who is going back to the minors when Corbin is back"
azdiamondbacks,3bkcfb,go_dbacks,5,Mon Jun 29 22:45:50 2015 UTC,!!!!!!!
azdiamondbacks,3bkcfb,ellius,3,Mon Jun 29 23:44:46 2015 UTC,I figure he's taking over Webster's next start honestly
azdiamondbacks,3bkcfb,groovygarrett,5,Tue Jun 30 04:59:38 2015 UTC,"Probably going to take a while for him to return to his old form (even then, I think of him more as a #2 or #3 pitcher than an ace), but it will be nice having Corbin back."
azdiamondbacks,3bkcfb,joecb91,2,Tue Jun 30 00:34:50 2015 UTC,"@JackMagruder:   2015-06-29 22:39:29 UTC  #Dbacks Corbin is to pitch on sixth day on final rehab turn, Hale said, which will be July 2. So could go either July 7 or July 8 in Texas     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]"
azdiamondbacks,3bkcfb,TweetPoster,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:47:01 2015 UTC,So hopefully we won't see Webster in the majors for us again. But also hoping he doesn't pull a Bolsinger and get decent once he's gone
azdiamondbacks,3bkcfb,HeadApe,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:15:56 2015 UTC,"Based on his Boston numbers, I think we are okay there."
azdiamondbacks,3bk5rh,Constant_Gardner11,3,Mon Jun 29 21:53:52 2015 UTC,"It's more than likely too late to get Pollock in, especially with the serious OF competition in the NL"
azdiamondbacks,3bk5rh,Teb-Tenggeri,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:06:42 2015 UTC,"I honestly think there's a good chance they'll be in the Final Vote contest, then maybe we could make something happen."
azdiamondbacks,3bk5rh,HeadApe,3,Tue Jun 30 19:15:24 2015 UTC,Makes me sad. Pollock doesn't have the big boy numbers that everyone looks at. But gosh dang he's nearly God-like all around
azdiamondbacks,3bk5rh,flaming_scepter,2,Tue Jun 30 09:11:16 2015 UTC,Literally two of my favorite players in the MLB. These two always find their way onto my teams in The Show.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,SnakeBot,19,Mon Jun 29 23:49:52 2015 UTC,"I'm a roaming cards fan on a 7 game west coast trip and I just wanted to say that I am loving your beautiful ballpark!   Also, what a game tonight! A real barn burner!  Go D-Backs!"
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Totschlag,8,Tue Jun 30 04:01:16 2015 UTC,"please beat LA in the playoffs again, thx in advance."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,thekeymaker,17,Tue Jun 30 04:31:43 2015 UTC,Was just at /r/dodgers  holy shit that made me appreciate you assholes so much more
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,WhatTheeFuckIsReddit,12,Tue Jun 30 05:23:53 2015 UTC,You calling me an asshole?
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,HolyCelestia,7,Tue Jun 30 05:24:31 2015 UTC,"Yea, but... I love you"
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,WhatTheeFuckIsReddit,12,Tue Jun 30 05:34:01 2015 UTC,"It does get pretty hectic in there. Mostly harmless, but lots of suicide watch."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,thedelphiki,15,Tue Jun 30 05:24:48 2015 UTC,what a fun game this has been.. castillo seems to be having a lot of fun on the DBacks.. and peralta always seems SO into the game. i'm loving the personalities on this team! i love passionate players
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,sparcos,12,Tue Jun 30 05:24:47 2015 UTC,I fucking hate how many Dodgers fans attend our games.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Peyton4President,11,Tue Jun 30 02:41:20 2015 UTC,"Allen Webster looks like Trevor Cahill's younger, thinner brother."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,flaming_scepter,4,Tue Jun 30 02:43:59 2015 UTC,Holy shit he does. Down to that shitty face fuzz he's got going on too.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Sargentk,3,Tue Jun 30 02:53:17 2015 UTC,And he also really likes throwing balls
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,ThisMachineKILLS,3,Tue Jun 30 04:16:49 2015 UTC,Can not unsee

azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,bp9801,9,Tue Jun 30 05:14:14 2015 UTC,"Eeeeeexcellent 0,_,0"
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,brandonatron,11,Tue Jun 30 05:16:22 2015 UTC,Dodgers broadcasters talking shit about the double steal.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,-Lysosome-,11,Tue Jun 30 05:20:30 2015 UTC,Salty. They're so salty.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Totschlag,11,Tue Jun 30 05:20:53 2015 UTC,"If the lead was higher, sure, talk shit. But it's still within slam distance, so gotta try for any insurance you can."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,bp9801,10,Tue Jun 30 05:21:58 2015 UTC,Their broadcasters are the most biased I've ever heard. I usually listen to the local cast... these guys are terrible compared to the rest. Especially the younger guy.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,joinfof,6,Tue Jun 30 05:27:33 2015 UTC,Worse than the Pirates crew?
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,-Lysosome-,6,Tue Jun 30 05:32:35 2015 UTC,I'll have to tune in to some Pirates cast - can't compare unfortunately.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,joinfof,11,Tue Jun 30 05:33:43 2015 UTC,NO H****R ALERT  Webster (ARI) has taken the Dodgers into the 3rd inning without allowing a hit.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Teb-Tenggeri,5,Tue Jun 30 02:06:30 2015 UTC,Aaaaand it's gone.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,c45c73,9,Tue Jun 30 02:21:13 2015 UTC,"you guys are fun to watch, I""m glad I stayed up!"
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,fightinchunk,10,Tue Jun 30 04:28:17 2015 UTC,Dodgers eating LOBster tonight.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Totschlag,10,Tue Jun 30 04:52:31 2015 UTC,I am so glad i turned the game back on.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,DoOgSauce,8,Tue Jun 30 05:18:31 2015 UTC,How about we beat the shit out of their bullpen so they can't use some guys next couple days?
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,-Lysosome-,6,Tue Jun 30 03:16:32 2015 UTC,Nice start!
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,-Lysosome-,9,Tue Jun 30 03:22:57 2015 UTC,Slam would be a good way to cap this night.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,-Lysosome-,10,Tue Jun 30 05:16:24 2015 UTC,I love you goldtitties
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,thekeymaker,8,Tue Jun 30 05:18:50 2015 UTC,"Lol he said exaggerated pull shift, and I though he said exaggerated bull shit"
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,andrew02020,5,Tue Jun 30 02:11:25 2015 UTC,I always hear that
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Teb-Tenggeri,8,Tue Jun 30 02:12:36 2015 UTC,I have to say that the oddest thing tonight is probably the Dodgers fans in the seats. It's solid blue on the first base side and solid  red on the 3rd base side. It looks like a bowl game with team segregated seating.  It's just weird how noticeable the split is.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Totschlag,8,Tue Jun 30 04:42:02 2015 UTC,Beef brings in the Lamb!
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,bp9801,3,Tue Jun 30 04:56:44 2015 UTC,Mmmmmmm... mutton.

azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Totschlag,9,Tue Jun 30 05:19:20 2015 UTC,Dodgers bullpen pitch count = 107
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,-Lysosome-,8,Tue Jun 30 05:23:16 2015 UTC,Ouch.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Totschlag,8,Tue Jun 30 05:23:46 2015 UTC,"Damn, the game is closing to 4 hours."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,-Lysosome-,6,Tue Jun 30 05:25:03 2015 UTC,"Didn't get off to the best start, but hot damn did it pick up."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,bp9801,7,Tue Jun 30 05:27:44 2015 UTC,At the game... was that presumably insufficient evidence? It looked really iffy on the scoreboard.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Totschlag,8,Tue Jun 30 03:50:23 2015 UTC,WOOOOOOO!!!!

azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Totschlag,6,Tue Jun 30 05:15:36 2015 UTC,Gotta pitch to Goldy.

azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,brandonatron,7,Tue Jun 30 05:22:48 2015 UTC,Winner. Winner. Chicken. DINNER.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,joinfof,8,Tue Jun 30 05:32:55 2015 UTC,"Homers were big, but the biggest hit of the game honors goes to Peralta for his 2-run triple against a lefty."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,-Lysosome-,8,Tue Jun 30 05:34:08 2015 UTC,Looks like two Dodgers relievers got a blown save and Burgos got his first MLB win!
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,-Lysosome-,6,Tue Jun 30 05:35:24 2015 UTC,Ok. Could have been worse...
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,cakelorldeath,6,Tue Jun 30 01:49:58 2015 UTC,1 run on 0 hits... WTF happened?
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,c45c73,6,Tue Jun 30 02:02:13 2015 UTC,"Two walks and a HBP to load the bases, then the next batter hit into a double play which scored the runner at third."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,ZigZab,4,Tue Jun 30 02:03:23 2015 UTC,Well that's straightforward.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,c45c73,6,Tue Jun 30 02:18:12 2015 UTC,I feel like Jake lamb strikes out on the same pitch every game.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,giantjensen,7,Tue Jun 30 02:12:32 2015 UTC,You don't see an Ahmed error too often
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,mind_elevated,5,Tue Jun 30 02:22:55 2015 UTC,"Get loose, get funky Dbacks. We need some offense."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,brandonatron,6,Tue Jun 30 02:27:30 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'm over the Webster experiment. Patrick Corbin can't get back soon enough."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Sargentk,5,Tue Jun 30 02:44:09 2015 UTC,He is missing his spots big time this is awful.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,andrew02020,7,Tue Jun 30 02:46:46 2015 UTC,AHMVP!!

azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,HoopAndHarm,4,Tue Jun 30 02:02:16 2015 UTC,Wings is such an underrated defender
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,mind_elevated,6,Tue Jun 30 02:05:46 2015 UTC,Terrible swing.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,andrew02020,6,Tue Jun 30 02:09:51 2015 UTC,Tomás loves to chase those.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,ZigZab,5,Tue Jun 30 02:10:38 2015 UTC,"Make me proud, Wings!  So close."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,ellius,4,Tue Jun 30 02:13:10 2015 UTC,Steve is a wizard.  He called exactly what he would do...  Swing at a breaking ball low and away
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,mind_elevated,3,Tue Jun 30 02:17:30 2015 UTC,Wizards don't wear mom jeans.   Dusty is clearly  a hobbit.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,ellius,5,Tue Jun 30 02:19:31 2015 UTC,He didn't catch that?
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Teb-Tenggeri,3,Tue Jun 30 02:21:05 2015 UTC,Got it on the hop
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,andrew02020,3,Tue Jun 30 02:21:25 2015 UTC,Looked like a trap.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,bp9801,5,Tue Jun 30 02:21:31 2015 UTC,Thank god that's the break Allen needed
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,andrew02020,6,Tue Jun 30 02:24:59 2015 UTC,"Since Allen is done, I'm done. Got work in the morning. Night guys."

azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,cakelorldeath,4,Tue Jun 30 05:26:39 2015 UTC,"I'm sick with a fever, but still gonna sit down and watch the game, you better win Dbacks!"
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,giantjensen,4,Tue Jun 30 01:43:59 2015 UTC,Lucky to get out of that with only one run scored. Could have been much uglier.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,ZigZab,4,Tue Jun 30 01:50:14 2015 UTC,No hitter intact for webster
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,mind_elevated,4,Tue Jun 30 01:50:15 2015 UTC,"14 balls, 3 strikes. Could have been worse."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,-Lysosome-,5,Tue Jun 30 01:50:36 2015 UTC,"Only threw 20 pitches walking the bases loaded and allowing one run, I'll call that a win."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,giantjensen,4,Tue Jun 30 01:51:48 2015 UTC,Nice bunt.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,-Lysosome-,4,Tue Jun 30 01:54:06 2015 UTC,Just tuning in. Looks like Allen hasn't looked too good so far?
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,andrew02020,5,Tue Jun 30 02:01:07 2015 UTC,He hasn't allowed a hit :p

azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,giantjensen,4,Tue Jun 30 02:01:53 2015 UTC,"Beautiful segue, Bob."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,ellius,4,Tue Jun 30 02:02:12 2015 UTC,Why is that? The whole thing about NL players pitching to contact and AL players pitching for strikeouts?
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,andrew02020,4,Tue Jun 30 02:02:47 2015 UTC,Lol before I turned this game on I turned on the Tampa Cleveland game and as soon as I turned it on Tampas pitcher threw a wild pitch on an intentional walk and allowed a runner to score.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,andrew02020,3,Tue Jun 30 02:04:28 2015 UTC,"C'mon , AJ.  You're such a disappointment!"
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,ellius,5,Tue Jun 30 02:21:19 2015 UTC,Webster needs a confidence boost. Seems he can't get a first pitch strike.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,bp9801,4,Tue Jun 30 02:22:40 2015 UTC,No pop up bunts this time webster
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,mind_elevated,5,Tue Jun 30 02:29:08 2015 UTC,Ahmed don't need no sac bunt to move up.

azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,andrew02020,3,Tue Jun 30 02:18:43 2015 UTC,I love sinkerballers.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,andrew02020,3,Tue Jun 30 02:19:59 2015 UTC,Error? Cue the painful hit.   Edit: hey what gives dodgers?
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,brandonatron,3,Tue Jun 30 02:24:14 2015 UTC,"Nice wiggle, Webster."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,ellius,3,Tue Jun 30 02:24:35 2015 UTC,"Nice play, Webster"
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Teb-Tenggeri,3,Tue Jun 30 02:24:42 2015 UTC,"What happened to Puig? He only has 3 home-runs and 10 Rbis, Was he injured for a long time?"
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,giantjensen,5,Tue Jun 30 02:25:51 2015 UTC,I think he missed like 40 games
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,mind_elevated,3,Tue Jun 30 02:26:13 2015 UTC,Call me crazy but I think we're better off facing Kershaw than Bolsinger. These slow pitchers can  just rock our over aggressive lineup to sleep.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,mind_elevated,3,Tue Jun 30 02:38:56 2015 UTC,Awful pitch. Allen's command is so bad at times.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,andrew02020,3,Tue Jun 30 02:40:48 2015 UTC,"Man these dbacks and dodgers games have the same script. Etched in stone, thousands of years ago, haunting us like ghosts of a time gone by..... Shit that got deep."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,brandonatron,3,Tue Jun 30 02:43:47 2015 UTC,Who could we bring in to relieve Webster?
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,bp9801,4,Tue Jun 30 02:44:58 2015 UTC,"At this point, a tee."
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,ellius,3,Tue Jun 30 02:46:27 2015 UTC,Pathetic outing by Webster. He will not be the new Webbie
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,mind_elevated,3,Tue Jun 30 02:51:09 2015 UTC,This inning everything has been down the middle. I hope he doesn't make another start for a while.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,-Lysosome-,3,Tue Jun 30 02:51:55 2015 UTC,Bolsinger doesn't even look 100%. But we can't figure out his breaking ball.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,-Lysosome-,3,Tue Jun 30 03:03:09 2015 UTC,Give us more dbacks. MORRRRRRREEEE
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,brandonatron,3,Tue Jun 30 03:41:14 2015 UTC,Ohhhh babyyyyyy! Tomas homer
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,giantjensen,3,Tue Jun 30 03:44:58 2015 UTC,Don't lose the f-ing momentum for f-ing sake.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,brandonatron,3,Tue Jun 30 03:58:06 2015 UTC,Surprised we came back
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,amperx11,3,Tue Jun 30 04:00:29 2015 UTC,I would've brought in Burgos here.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,-Lysosome-,3,Tue Jun 30 04:07:09 2015 UTC,Did a dodger fan really throw back Tomas' home run?
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Flesh_Lettuce,3,Tue Jun 30 04:28:45 2015 UTC,Ya which is great.  I'd rather he not have it.
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Freyja_God,8,Tue Jun 30 04:30:44 2015 UTC,That's the thing about dodger fans. Too many have little to no respect in opposing parks. Drives me bonkers
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,Flesh_Lettuce,4,Tue Jun 30 04:36:59 2015 UTC,Amen
azdiamondbacks,3bkjzm,brandonatron,3,Tue Jun 30 04:39:09 2015 UTC,Keep the line moving. They're running out of bullpen.
azdiamondbacks,3bj9ut,GoldysMassiveArms,18,Mon Jun 29 18:04:00 2015 UTC,"I try to understand stats, transactions, roster moves, etc... Slowly I'm getting the hang of it. But overall it gets in the way of my beer drinking and enjoying sports.   I'm not a GM. I'm an AZ sports Homer."
azdiamondbacks,3bj9ut,brandonatron,7,Mon Jun 29 18:23:12 2015 UTC,"I understand football as a game more than I do baseball. I know football really well but I have a whole different relationship with baseball. Baseball is almost like a part of me, like without it I would be missing a part of me."
azdiamondbacks,3bj9ut,brandonatron,5,Mon Jun 29 18:51:09 2015 UTC,I guess I should also say that I find stats and such extremely interesting and those who excel at it I got mad respect for.
azdiamondbacks,3bj9ut,Kelmon,12,Mon Jun 29 19:10:48 2015 UTC,"I don't see why you can't still watch and enjoy a player and still say that stuff. I can't count how many times I've heard Brenly on the broadcast say ""____ sees the ball well."" If you're going to join a conversation with other people, though, don't you think you're inviting other ways of thinking?"
azdiamondbacks,3bj9ut,cheerbacks,6,Mon Jun 29 18:31:30 2015 UTC,"I'm always open to different ways of thinking but saber people are fiercely defensive and not worth the argument. I would much rather argue politics and religion, I'll get more out of the other person."
azdiamondbacks,3bj9ut,Kelmon,2,Mon Jun 29 18:43:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's fine if you prefer metrics but it does get annoying when people completely dismiss the ""old-school"" way of thinking because they think that it's just totally worthless compared to advanced stats."
azdiamondbacks,3bj9ut,drDekaywood,7,Mon Jun 29 19:20:49 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone who is a believer in advanced metrics, I don't think some old-school ways of thinking are inherently wrong or misguided. Using the same examples OP did, if someone were to say to me, ""X is really seeing the ball well"" I wouldn't really say there is anything wrong with that, though I would think to myself it's simply fun with small samples and a bit of a cliche. The only difference for me in discussions with so called ""old-school"" fans is if they're making a testable claim: ""you should bunt the runner over"" or ""X is a proven closer""  and wanting their view to be seen as equally viable despite a lack of supporting evidence. You can hold whatever view you want and enjoy the game however you want. I would never say you're wrong for having a different way of thinking or watching the game, but if it comes to a discussion about game theory, I don't think it's fair to dislike that your views might be scrutinized."
azdiamondbacks,3bj9ut,prisonstrength,6,Mon Jun 29 20:15:55 2015 UTC,"We need statistics on which statistics are the most accurate statistics.   we'll go in circles trying to define players by more and more stats.  That's fine if it's interesting to people and they wanna nerd out on all the numbers, but it's a no better or worse way to analyze the game than using batting average, ERA, spray charts and all the classics, which are telling enough for me.   Moneyball clearly hasn't worked as well as advertised for Billy Beane and other saber-metric minded people.   Just like always, you still simply have to get as many good players as possible to create a well rounded team, and you'll have a better chance at winning.    I also believe clutch is a real thing in baseball."
azdiamondbacks,3bj9ut,Kelmon,3,Mon Jun 29 18:38:49 2015 UTC,"The sabremetric numbers are better for analyzing the players than the traditional numbers. You may not personally find them more or less useful, which is totally fine, but on the whole, the newer statistics are a more accurate, more efficient way to see how well a player is doing."
azdiamondbacks,3bj9ut,Raptor231408,4,Mon Jun 29 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"That's fine if it's interesting to people and they wanna nerd out on all the numbers, but it's a no better or worse way to analyze the game than using batting average, ERA, spray charts and all the classics, which are telling enough for me.   This is a view that I agree and disagree with. On a personal level, I absolutely agree. Whatever stats make the most sense to you, that's fine, I wouldn't say your preference is wrong. On a macro level, I absolutely disagree. If you are paid to analyze to make decisions about the game, there are absolutely better and worse ways to analyze the game."
azdiamondbacks,3bj9ut,pajamas_all_day,4,Mon Jun 29 20:20:53 2015 UTC,"I like WAR. I don't know what all the other mumbo jumbo is. No stat is the tell all stat, and each one has its pros and cons.

azdiamondbacks,3bgzhr,bryanplayspiano,5,Mon Jun 29 03:31:32 2015 UTC,I'll have to continually perform my chant ritual to assure his stay in Reno is eternal.

azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,parker_dub,3,Sun Jun 28 21:44:06 2015 UTC,Bob and Bert even pointed out that he had worse lines against lefties 😂
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,Sandygonads,4,Sun Jun 28 21:50:25 2015 UTC,Very off topic: but is any Dbacks fan here a member of Xbox game preview?   Very on Topic: We need a certain Patrick Corbin up here sharpish.

azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,Sandygonads,2,Sun Jun 28 22:05:55 2015 UTC,"Well it looks like he did get into it. Not sure how the invite process works for it, so like if he were to send one to me, could I forward it to you and have it work or would it need to be to your email?"
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,bp9801,2,Sun Jun 28 22:15:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the effort you went to mate but I've just got an invite from somewhere else.   Thanks again, and thank your friend for me please 😁"

azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,brandonatron,4,Sun Jun 28 21:56:53 2015 UTC,I wonder what the park record is for homers.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,-Lysosome-,3,Sun Jun 28 21:58:20 2015 UTC,"Can't find it for a game, but so far it looks like the Padres are already at more than 50% of last year's home run totals at Petco."

azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,bp9801,4,Sun Jun 28 22:00:27 2015 UTC,Legendary outfielder Penny.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,-Lysosome-,3,Sun Jun 28 22:11:53 2015 UTC,I think Chase stopped throwing changeups.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,-Lysosome-,4,Sun Jun 28 22:13:29 2015 UTC,"Ohhh just looked it up and they are expecting him back next weekend, """"I think it's probably going to be in the 18-20 days [range] after the injury,"" Hale said."""

azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,giantjensen,3,Sun Jun 28 20:33:01 2015 UTC,Yeah. He's killin it with regular playing time. Even Salty is seemingly doing better recently since coming back up
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,cakelorldeath,3,Sun Jun 28 20:33:55 2015 UTC,"Something like that. Barely was playing, too, but here he's been in most days."
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,bp9801,2,Sun Jun 28 20:34:07 2015 UTC,"I looked it up in the month of May he was batting .079 with 40 Ab's before coming to the Dbacks, since joining the dbacks he has like 4 homeruns and is batting .280"
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,giantjensen,2,Sun Jun 28 20:43:11 2015 UTC,"Daaaaaamn. Also looks like in Chicago he would come in real late and get maybe one or two PAs, depending on if it was pinch hitting or defensive replacement."
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 28 20:54:26 2015 UTC,Aaron Hill looks like a dancer out there

azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,brandonatron,3,Sun Jun 28 20:49:05 2015 UTC,David loves himself some Despaigne. 7/15 against him now with 2 homers.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,-Lysosome-,3,Sun Jun 28 20:49:44 2015 UTC,I've never seen Goldy swing like that.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,-Lysosome-,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:50:59 2015 UTC,Guessed wrong and got totally fooled. Not common at all with him.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 28 20:51:55 2015 UTC,Goldy you okay?
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,brandonatron,3,Sun Jun 28 20:52:19 2015 UTC,38 pitches thru 3 for Chase. That's the exact number I said to myself after 2. :)
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,-Lysosome-,3,Sun Jun 28 21:01:28 2015 UTC,Any of you been to a game in san diego?
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,adventurepony,3,Sun Jun 28 21:01:36 2015 UTC,Yep
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,brandonatron,3,Sun Jun 28 21:02:20 2015 UTC,I went a few years ago. Mark Reynolds threw me a ball. It was cool
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,go_dbacks,3,Sun Jun 28 21:03:58 2015 UTC,how's the stadium? im thinking about going in late july
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,adventurepony,4,Sun Jun 28 21:05:09 2015 UTC,"Really nice. I'd recommend it. Not too far either, assuming you're near the Valley"
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,go_dbacks,3,Sun Jun 28 21:06:07 2015 UTC,ya was gonna take a 4 day weekend an head over. any recommendations for food/parking around the stadium?
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,adventurepony,3,Sun Jun 28 21:11:18 2015 UTC,"I was like 13 at the time so no, haha. The folks at /r/padres could help you out though"
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,go_dbacks,2,Sun Jun 28 21:13:43 2015 UTC,"Fish tacos are all over. There's a Ghirardelli store in the Gaslamp Quarter near the stadium, about 3 or 4 blocks north of there near Market St. Really, if you walk around the Gaslamp Quarter, you're bound to run into about four dozen or so different restaurants, pubs, and the like. Can't go wrong.  When I went, my dad and I ended up parking in the parking garage right next to Petco and just walked on over. Can't remember how much it was, but it was convenient as hell."
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 28 21:20:52 2015 UTC,"Wear sun screen, park on the street a few blocks away and don't buy tickets to the park area, get a seat.   The crowds have been huge there this year, lots of energy:)"
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,brandonatron,2,Sun Jun 28 21:10:42 2015 UTC,"cool, thanks:)"
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,adventurepony,2,Sun Jun 28 21:20:51 2015 UTC,The one several years back when Doug Davis threw about 6 2/3 of perfection. Sat a few rows from the field on the 3rd base side.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 28 21:06:07 2015 UTC,"Let's go offense, help us out here."
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,brandonatron,3,Sun Jun 28 21:18:24 2015 UTC,"What's the point of Dorn being up in the bigs? We have better hitters in the minors, we have better fielders in the minors, and Chip Hale would rather play someone who has half a game of work in the outfield than play Dorn. Struggling to see why he's here, still like the guy."
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,Sandygonads,3,Sun Jun 28 21:24:42 2015 UTC,Yeah please don't hit our dudes in the hands
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,brandonatron,3,Sun Jun 28 21:37:12 2015 UTC,Early hook by Murphy.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,-Lysosome-,3,Sun Jun 28 21:37:17 2015 UTC,Holy shit. Big bomb!
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,-Lysosome-,3,Sun Jun 28 21:40:42 2015 UTC,LAMB BAM THANK YOU MAAM
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,notocho,3,Sun Jun 28 21:41:26 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, Lamb homerun! Hopefully this lights a fire in him."
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,giantjensen,3,Sun Jun 28 21:41:39 2015 UTC,"Hill's 4th stolen base, huh? I only remember one of them which was a double steal."
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,-Lysosome-,3,Sun Jun 28 21:49:35 2015 UTC,"ok, im not gonna say ""Why in the mother fuck is chase hitting?"" cause I know a lot of you will already say it for me."
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,parker_dub,4,Sun Jun 28 22:02:54 2015 UTC,"Our bullpen has been drilled by the padres the last 2 games, keep him in as long as we can, we always complain about taking the pitcher out too early!"
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,giantjensen,2,Sun Jun 28 22:12:51 2015 UTC,ok FINE.  i agree w/you.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,parker_dub,3,Sun Jun 28 22:14:38 2015 UTC,Penny is so smooth out there.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 28 22:11:24 2015 UTC,Penny for left field at the ASG!
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,theres_yer_problem,3,Sun Jun 28 22:12:47 2015 UTC,Goldy's hit streak lives!

azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 28 22:19:06 2015 UTC,Does anyone know when Ender comes back?
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,giantjensen,5,Sun Jun 28 22:20:16 2015 UTC,Not soon enough
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,amperx11,4,Sun Jun 28 22:24:18 2015 UTC,I read that it will be more than the initial 15 days DL.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,-Lysosome-,2,Sun Jun 28 22:22:25 2015 UTC,"Darnnn, I miss him! I like peralta, but I think Ender is better for us"
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,giantjensen,2,Sun Jun 28 22:25:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, initially I thought it was just the 15 day thing, but now it may be another couple weeks."
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 28 22:26:55 2015 UTC,Nice and quick by Huddy. I like.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,bp9801,2,Sun Jun 28 22:29:40 2015 UTC,Good redeeming inning
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,brandonatron,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:30:22 2015 UTC,Totally. Much better than that last one.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 28 22:31:12 2015 UTC,I knew Huddy would bounce back nicely.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,-Lysosome-,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:29:51 2015 UTC,One thing Huddy does really well. Doesn't let the bad stuff get him down.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,Sandygonads,2,Sun Jun 28 22:42:23 2015 UTC,Penny in left... We can't lose!
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,brandonatron,2,Sun Jun 28 18:54:51 2015 UTC,"And Peralta in center, too. Should be a good game all around!"
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 28 18:59:11 2015 UTC,Lol. I guess we won't have too much trouble finding room for O'brien if he gets called up
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,go_dbacks,2,Sun Jun 28 19:50:16 2015 UTC,Homework and baseball. Hopefully I can get the former wrapped up before the latter begins!
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,bp9801,2,Sun Jun 28 18:59:32 2015 UTC,Alright. It starts now.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,parker_dub,2,Sun Jun 28 20:08:50 2015 UTC,"I thought it was nice of Yas to give Todd some water before the game started. Todd may need it, depending on how last night went."
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,bp9801,2,Sun Jun 28 20:19:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, ok. Fuck"
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,Electric_Warrior_,2,Sun Jun 28 20:19:58 2015 UTC,"Omg Lamb got a hit, it's a miracle"
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,giantjensen,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:29:12 2015 UTC,Two days in a row with hits. What is this?!

azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,-Lysosome-,2,Sun Jun 28 21:45:40 2015 UTC,Think Taco Bell can give some Lamb Tacos?
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,bp9801,2,Sun Jun 28 21:49:45 2015 UTC,id be down
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,adventurepony,2,Sun Jun 28 22:11:56 2015 UTC,Chase started to fall behind on hitters.
azdiamondbacks,3bf8a5,-Lysosome-,2,Sun Jun 28 21:55:55 2015 UTC,Hey Kershaw if eating subway gets me a under .500 record with a >3 ERA I think I'll pass brah

azdiamondbacks,3bd9z8,CrankertonBlues,6,Sun Jun 28 03:16:32 2015 UTC,I want a Jose Bautista.
azdiamondbacks,3bd9z8,parker_dub,7,Sun Jun 28 03:19:19 2015 UTC,Doesn't everyone?
azdiamondbacks,3bd9z8,juicefarm,5,Sun Jun 28 03:20:52 2015 UTC,Isn't he a free agent after this year?
azdiamondbacks,3bd9z8,fatOLDwhiteGUY,3,Sun Jun 28 04:20:41 2015 UTC,"And a Russell Martin too, please."
azdiamondbacks,3bd9z8,joecb91,4,Sun Jun 28 05:13:51 2015 UTC,I think we'll keep em' for now.
azdiamondbacks,3bd9z8,rkip5,2,Sun Jun 28 05:21:43 2015 UTC,That would be fun.
azdiamondbacks,3bd9z8,WhatTheeFuckIsReddit,6,Sun Jun 28 05:15:41 2015 UTC,My buddy keeps complaining about his lack of power/hr this year but .320... I don't care how many hrs you hit
azdiamondbacks,3bd9z8,joecb91,2,Sun Jun 28 04:04:05 2015 UTC,"If he wasn't touted as the Cuban Barry Bonds and was marketed more as idk ""chubby Ichiro"" more people would be happy with his current production"
azdiamondbacks,3bd9z8,joecb91,3,Sun Jun 28 21:45:30 2015 UTC,"I never saw ""Cuban Barry Bonds"" as a comparison for him. Most of the stuff I saw talking about him before he was signed said that in their opinion Puig and Jose Abreu were better prospects coming out of Cuba."
azdiamondbacks,3bd9z8,shroomdizzle,2,Sun Jun 28 22:06:31 2015 UTC,"""Chubby Ichiro"" Too good"
azdiamondbacks,3bd9z8,sparcos,6,Tue Jun 30 21:42:56 2015 UTC,"Personally, looking at his BABIP being over .400 I question how long he can keep his average as high as it is. But I am pleasantly surprised with how he has hit so far. Looking at the scouting reports, he was projected more as a Trumbo type than what he has been. K and BB rates have been around the same area as Trumbo this year, but much higher average.  Power hasn't been there yet, but it does seem to be improving and I think he will compensate with more of a power stroke when his average does eventually drop.  Was not very good at 3B, but seems to be good enough in the outfield that I don't cringe when something is hit his way like I do with Trumbo."
azdiamondbacks,3bdkej,SnakeBot,3,Sun Jun 28 05:13:07 2015 UTC,"Disappointing performance both offensively and defensively, but we got Anderson then Webster up next who have both looked good so we I'm confident we could avoid a sweep and grab some momentum. Also I hope that dude that was partying with the Irish chicks makes it back ok."
azdiamondbacks,3bdkej,andrew02020,4,Sun Jun 28 05:18:37 2015 UTC,I wish all the best to anyone hanging with that crew. They were awesome
azdiamondbacks,3bdkej,cubman2000,3,Sun Jun 28 05:27:33 2015 UTC,"We need details from Todd tomorrow. Best part of the night, so must see what he learns/experiences."
azdiamondbacks,3bdkej,bp9801,2,Sun Jun 28 05:29:24 2015 UTC,It's a bummer losing games like this. We definitely have a respectable offense and we tend to not bring out the bats when it matters. Back up the staff. We all know that our pitching staff is terrible but some timely offense matters. We definitely have the potential.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,SnakeBot,8,Sun Jun 28 00:17:59 2015 UTC,"This team is too good to lose to Cashner after back to back losses. I'm calling a win and a convincing one at that. Fuck errors, fuck bad strike zones, fuck the curse and fuck losing.   Straight Ws tonight.   edit: fml"
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,parker_dub,6,Sun Jun 28 00:45:47 2015 UTC,"That sucked. At least Heli put it in play instead of striking out, I guess..."

azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,3,Sun Jun 28 02:58:18 2015 UTC,Nope.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 28 03:01:40 2015 UTC,Or is he dancer?
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,6,Sun Jun 28 03:05:58 2015 UTC,Can we just START the count at 0-2 when the Dbacks are up? Game will move quicker.   Sorry I'm being cynical.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,parker_dub,7,Sun Jun 28 02:58:31 2015 UTC,"Alfonso Soriano, the guy that almost became Arizona's most hated person"
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,4,Sun Jun 28 03:08:36 2015 UTC,He's not real liked in my neck of the woods either.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,4,Sun Jun 28 03:09:17 2015 UTC,My heart just skipped a beat when they mentioned Soriano for the Yankees.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,brandonatron,6,Sun Jun 28 03:10:49 2015 UTC,...Yasmany got a lot on that throw!
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,5,Sun Jun 28 03:12:50 2015 UTC,Upton slumping? I don't believe it
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,6,Sun Jun 28 03:14:04 2015 UTC,"I've decided to follow LaRussa to Arizona tonight.  And I have a buddy in Mesa.  Regardless, I'm pulling for y'all tonight, and I hope you'll have me!"
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,1859,5,Sun Jun 28 03:28:16 2015 UTC,Welcome!
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,6,Sun Jun 28 03:30:53 2015 UTC,Uh-oh. I don't like seeing people hurt their legs like that.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,7,Sun Jun 28 03:36:19 2015 UTC,Standed
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,5,Sun Jun 28 03:36:55 2015 UTC,Always like how the cameramen find the cute girls.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,6,Sun Jun 28 03:47:19 2015 UTC,When I went to AZ their seemed to be a lot of them.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,7,Sun Jun 28 03:49:35 2015 UTC,The whole southwest region does have a lot of cute ones.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,6,Sun Jun 28 03:50:33 2015 UTC,Yeah. One of the hottest chicks from my HS went to UofA.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,3,Sun Jun 28 03:51:52 2015 UTC,"Not one of the smartest, eh?  (joking I know a lot of smart people that go/went to UofA)"
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,6,Sun Jun 28 03:54:45 2015 UTC,Boners with zoom lenses
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,brandonatron,3,Sun Jun 28 03:48:47 2015 UTC,God bless them.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,6,Sun Jun 28 03:50:43 2015 UTC,Lol at this bike tour.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,5,Sun Jun 28 03:50:54 2015 UTC,This fucking road trip
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,brandonatron,5,Sun Jun 28 03:57:18 2015 UTC,I love our broadcast crew
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,3,Sun Jun 28 04:00:35 2015 UTC,I loved that comment about the slingshot being more accurate than some/most pitchers.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,6,Sun Jun 28 04:01:52 2015 UTC,"""They're not great, but they're American, so I love them""  Quote of the year"
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,5,Sun Jun 28 04:11:28 2015 UTC,Can describe so many things with that.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,5,Sun Jun 28 04:13:01 2015 UTC,"Fine reporting, Todd."
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,7,Sun Jun 28 04:11:36 2015 UTC,"Todd's like, ""I did my job. Now to get invited to the afterparty."""
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,6,Sun Jun 28 04:12:33 2015 UTC,Lol that chick was pretty drunk.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,6,Sun Jun 28 04:13:32 2015 UTC,I guess the stereotype is true
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,4,Sun Jun 28 04:14:11 2015 UTC,"Irish, pretty drunk. Same thing."
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,brandonatron,4,Sun Jun 28 04:14:19 2015 UTC,"Can confirm.  source: am part irish, also part drunk."
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,3,Sun Jun 28 04:17:15 2015 UTC,"I'm part Irish, part German."
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 28 04:18:56 2015 UTC,I'm part everything. So basically I'm white.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,4,Sun Jun 28 04:19:38 2015 UTC,I'm half baked.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,HolyCelestia,6,Sun Jun 28 04:23:29 2015 UTC,Knowing this team we'll go on a 3 game winning streak then fail to make .500 again.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,giantjensen,4,Sun Jun 28 04:25:13 2015 UTC,First haboob of the year today!
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,3,Sun Jun 28 01:47:37 2015 UTC,How bad are they? Do they like shut down places like a snowstorm would up north or are they just like an inconvenience or are they just kind of cool?
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,4,Sun Jun 28 01:49:48 2015 UTC,I doubt a blind person could tell the difference between a dust storm and strong wind. They've caused some pretty bad accidents on the interstates here. Otherwise they're just kinda cool to look at.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,3,Sun Jun 28 01:52:00 2015 UTC,How cold does AZ get in the winter? I've only been there once and it was during the summer. Does it ever snow?
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,5,Sun Jun 28 01:54:00 2015 UTC,"There's some areas that are a pretty high elevation (Flagstaff) that get snow, and a few mountaintops in lower elevations. Other than that no. For a few weeks it freezes at night, highs rarely go below 65-70"
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,5,Sun Jun 28 01:56:40 2015 UTC,Sounds awesome.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,3,Sun Jun 28 01:57:56 2015 UTC,It's pretty great if you can tolerate the 110+ for a couple months
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,3,Sun Jun 28 01:59:45 2015 UTC,With your humidity I'd be fine. I like hot weather.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,4,Sun Jun 28 02:00:21 2015 UTC,Snowed here in Tucson on New Years. Other than that just mountain tops and places like Flag
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,rkip5,5,Sun Jun 28 02:13:15 2015 UTC,What's up guys. I'm pretty salty about the Phillies being bushleague so I need to see some good baseball rn. Let's do this.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,3,Sun Jun 28 01:48:37 2015 UTC,What happened with the Phillies?
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,Something_More,3,Sun Jun 28 02:08:39 2015 UTC,"My first team is the Nationals. The Phillies started a game when it was obvious it wasn't going to go the 5 required innings due to rain, and our manager started the scheduled starter (probably not a good decision on his part). Not surprisingly the game got canceled after 1 inning so we wasted a Gio start and we had to bring up a AAAA pitcher to start for us tomorrow in a double header. We are very thin right now (I think Ian Desmond is the only opening day starter who started today) and having to play a double header with our lineup is going to suck. We had two healthy bench players today."
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,4,Sun Jun 28 02:12:38 2015 UTC,"Sounds like us last year, except with a pitching staff"
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,4,Sun Jun 28 02:19:31 2015 UTC,"Up until this week of dominance, (with the exception of Scherzer) our starters have either underperformed or been hurt. We had a few weeks last month when everyone was healthy and Harper was hitting homeruns every time he was at the plate where we were able to get well above .500 which is why our record is decent right now but the Nationals have been a lot worse than they should be."
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,5,Sun Jun 28 02:24:28 2015 UTC,Checking in from section 130! Let's do this!
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,pajamas_all_day,5,Sun Jun 28 01:57:44 2015 UTC,What's up guys? Getting ready to watch my boys play and listening to my boyfriend quote some video parody of Bane from Dark Knight Rises... and laughing hysterically.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,Something_More,5,Sun Jun 28 02:10:31 2015 UTC,"Sup! I spent the day furniture shopping, looking forward to chillaxing to a baseball game"
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,4,Sun Jun 28 02:16:43 2015 UTC,I spent my day watching GoT and soaking my injured feet.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,4,Sun Jun 28 02:18:31 2015 UTC,binge watching GoT? nice
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,parker_dub,3,Sun Jun 28 02:28:49 2015 UTC,Yep. No baseball this afternoon after the Nats rainout (I was going to go into DC to a sports bar to watch it) and I'm tired of having my friends spoil shit for me so I just stayed in my room all day and watched the first several episodes.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,3,Sun Jun 28 02:31:00 2015 UTC,Be careful. Once I started I couldn't stop.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,parker_dub,3,Sun Jun 28 02:38:46 2015 UTC,I did absolutely nothing today other than cook and play some Witcher 3.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,4,Sun Jun 28 02:22:22 2015 UTC,"I'm really, REALLY trying to stay positive and Helli isn't making it very easy on me."
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,parker_dub,4,Sun Jun 28 02:27:26 2015 UTC,Almost got a DP there.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,3,Sun Jun 28 02:27:50 2015 UTC,This whole team has made it hard this roadtrip
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,6,Sun Jun 28 02:29:49 2015 UTC,"I was going to say ""at least they got Cashner's pitch count up,"" but then I looked up their bullpen's stats...."
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,4,Sun Jun 28 02:44:13 2015 UTC,Sab Diego's bullpen has always seemed nasty... At pecto more so.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,brandonatron,5,Sun Jun 28 02:51:07 2015 UTC,Confession  I'm not really all that upset when we lose games because it helps to ensure that Dave Stewart doesn't go all-in at the deadline
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,ThisMachineKILLS,3,Sun Jun 28 02:49:00 2015 UTC,I'm still waiting for that trade of Hill.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,5,Sun Jun 28 02:51:57 2015 UTC,I like Ahmed in the leadoff spot because he actually sees a good number of pitches there.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 28 02:55:40 2015 UTC,Who used to bat leadoff?
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,6,Sun Jun 28 02:57:35 2015 UTC,"""Padres been playing about as bland as their uniforms."" HAH!"
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 28 02:56:52 2015 UTC,.-.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,Fargoleafy,5,Sun Jun 28 02:58:05 2015 UTC,Goldy is good
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,4,Sun Jun 28 02:57:25 2015 UTC,Goldy is Good
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,brandonatron,3,Sun Jun 28 02:58:40 2015 UTC,I agree on both accounts
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,parker_dub,5,Sun Jun 28 03:01:47 2015 UTC,I don't mean any bad juju towards Stanton but when he got injured did anyone else kind of maybe think about goldy and triple crown?
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,parker_dub,3,Sun Jun 28 02:57:41 2015 UTC,I hate you for putting the idea that this is possible (thus raising my expectations) in my mind
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,5,Sun Jun 28 02:59:09 2015 UTC,"i mean i see others as being ""hot"" and numbers will fade. Goldy doesn't have a ""hot"" bat. this is his bat. it gets hits. it kills baseballs. all season."
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,parker_dub,3,Sun Jun 28 03:01:21 2015 UTC,"Todd Walsh showed a projection chart on the pregame show about it being possible. Something that the projections show Goldy as having about the same or better numbers than Cabrera during his triple crown year. Stanton was projected to hit about 60 HRs, but missing a month or so will put a serious damper in that."
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,5,Sun Jun 28 03:01:30 2015 UTC,RESULTZ

azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,6,Sun Jun 28 03:02:15 2015 UTC,We don't use left/right lines enough. Good job by Tomas.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,-Lysosome-,5,Sun Jun 28 03:03:07 2015 UTC,I sáw á little bát flip.. . I liked it.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,brandonatron,6,Sun Jun 28 03:03:52 2015 UTC,God damn Yas lasered that one in to Lamb.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,5,Sun Jun 28 03:12:46 2015 UTC,I think the Padres have overtaken the Red Sox in beards/9 innings.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,5,Sun Jun 28 03:19:29 2015 UTC,I'm cool with missing Kershaw and Grienke again. Although Kershaw hasn't really been himself of late.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,4,Sun Jun 28 03:24:05 2015 UTC,I'd still rather face Ballsy
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,4,Sun Jun 28 03:24:59 2015 UTC,Better chances?
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,5,Sun Jun 28 03:26:24 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention it, we've beaten Kershaw this year but Ballsy has demolished us. Maybe not"
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,3,Sun Jun 28 03:28:08 2015 UTC,"We wreck Kershaw Ballsy has our number, I don't get it."
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,GoldysMassiveArms,5,Sun Jun 28 03:29:42 2015 UTC,HEEEYYYAAA.... This ump is cracking me up
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,brandonatron,4,Sun Jun 28 03:26:32 2015 UTC,Hey Blue! What's cooler than bein' cool?
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,3,Sun Jun 28 03:28:39 2015 UTC,Ice cold

azdiamondbacks,3bct09,1859,3,Sun Jun 28 03:36:53 2015 UTC,By the former Cardinal (farmhand)!
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,5,Sun Jun 28 03:39:01 2015 UTC,Ahmed is growing on me guys  EDIT: shit
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,5,Sun Jun 28 03:39:43 2015 UTC,He does seem to fit real well into the leadoff spot.  Edit: Still needs a bit of work when stealing.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 28 03:41:00 2015 UTC,The baserunning will come with time.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,3,Sun Jun 28 03:43:53 2015 UTC,Where's the flair?
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,3,Sun Jun 28 03:43:28 2015 UTC,On my to-do list
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,3,Sun Jun 28 03:44:29 2015 UTC,Sweet.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,6,Sun Jun 28 03:44:57 2015 UTC,Todd Walsh has been hilarious lately.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,ellius,5,Sun Jun 28 03:49:12 2015 UTC,"Random drunks talking to Todd, running into the bike cab."
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,5,Sun Jun 28 03:49:58 2015 UTC,Todd is on the hunt for sorority girls.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,ellius,6,Sun Jun 28 03:51:57 2015 UTC,Dat bat flip tho
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,Zack,4,Sun Jun 28 03:57:14 2015 UTC,Damn.  Time to dig ourselves out!

azdiamondbacks,3bct09,thekeymaker,4,Sun Jun 28 03:58:44 2015 UTC,We still have 1/3 of the game to battle back!  How's the D'back's bullpen this year?
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,1859,5,Sun Jun 28 04:03:52 2015 UTC,Basically the opposite of the Cardinals bullpen
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,5,Sun Jun 28 04:04:49 2015 UTC,"There was some stat that was innings 1-5 we have a +40 Run differential, from 6-9 we have a -35. So yeah, really bad."
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,giantjensen,3,Sun Jun 28 04:10:24 2015 UTC,"Shit. Seriously? I knew it was bad, but, really?"
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 28 04:11:53 2015 UTC,"The showed it last night, it is that bad, and it's probably worse with these last 3 games!"
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,giantjensen,4,Sun Jun 28 04:17:11 2015 UTC,How's the D'back's bullpen this year?   Hahahahahahahaha  *sobs*
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,ellius,3,Sun Jun 28 04:04:38 2015 UTC,:( Oh my.

azdiamondbacks,3bct09,-Lysosome-,4,Sun Jun 28 04:17:35 2015 UTC,talk to you gents tmorrow
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,parker_dub,4,Sun Jun 28 04:22:06 2015 UTC,Ahmed is smooooth
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,4,Sun Jun 28 04:23:30 2015 UTC,Can we talk to some drunk fans please?
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,brandonatron,6,Sun Jun 28 04:24:19 2015 UTC,Am drunk.  AMA.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,1859,5,Sun Jun 28 04:35:19 2015 UTC,Am Irish sorority girl. AMA
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,4,Sun Jun 28 04:40:25 2015 UTC,"How do you feel about Toto's seminal hit, ""Africa""?"
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,1859,4,Sun Jun 28 04:42:10 2015 UTC,It's good.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,5,Sun Jun 28 04:44:06 2015 UTC,"I just got GTA V today and watching baseball, needless to say that I am saying goodbye to my last two weeks of class."
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,HolyCelestia,4,Sun Jun 28 04:27:35 2015 UTC,Lucky. I just finished a class and I got another starting next week.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,4,Sun Jun 28 04:30:07 2015 UTC,So much fun.  The story alone is worth the money.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,1859,4,Sun Jun 28 04:34:53 2015 UTC,Funny thing is you can kick the cats and dogs on the street not like I did it
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,HolyCelestia,3,Sun Jun 28 04:36:49 2015 UTC,"Don't need classes anyway, got GTA."

azdiamondbacks,3bct09,pajamas_all_day,3,Sun Jun 28 04:57:25 2015 UTC,Um you should just go and get one anyway....
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,brandonatron,4,Sun Jun 28 05:00:44 2015 UTC,"Why is Cashner so bad this year? His K/9 is up, his GB% is pretty much the same. Why has his BABIP gone up so much?  Edit: for some reason he's giving up a lot more HRs too."
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,3,Sun Jun 28 01:56:35 2015 UTC,Is Ya$money hurt? He was running and came up limping.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,pajamas_all_day,4,Sun Jun 28 02:00:55 2015 UTC,Cheer up guys! Yasmany's got you covered.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,4,Sun Jun 28 02:35:20 2015 UTC,It was pretty cool that The Padres let Tyson Ross take a day off and go watch his little bro's debut earlier this year.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,4,Sun Jun 28 02:39:16 2015 UTC,Too early to pinch hit for Hellickson? I'm just sayin'.
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,parker_dub,4,Sun Jun 28 02:40:05 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or is has there been more HBP injuries in the MLB this year than previous years? It's probably just me because I watch the Nationals and all of their injuries are, but watching the news around baseball and it seems a lot of people are getting hit in the knees, ankles, and wrists."
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,andrew02020,5,Sun Jun 28 02:52:18 2015 UTC,Funky zone tonight. Pitchers are getting the call on outside pitches vs. righties but not lefties.  EDIT: Nevermind Brooks says otherwise
azdiamondbacks,3bct09,go_dbacks,3,Sun Jun 28 02:54:16 2015 UTC,Usually the K zone is a little different for righties and lefties.

azdiamondbacks,3b4pw8,sparcos,5,Thu Jun 25 23:16:03 2015 UTC,"My heart says Ahmed but my head says Owings.   Ahmed has been great defensively this year and is starting to swing the bat a little bit. Owings has been pretty bad offensively this year but is serviceable defensively; he is actually currently a negative WAR player (-0.5). That being said, a .384 wOBA in 2013 in AAA for Owings should at least translate a little bit at the big league level. However, that year may have been a bit of a flash in the pan. He has never really had good plate discipline and has a lot of work to become a good everyday middle-infielder."
azdiamondbacks,3b4pw8,thekeymaker,2,Thu Jun 25 23:52:12 2015 UTC,"Nice post. To me owings has the resume and passes the eye test, and as you pointed out is a serviceable on D at SS if nothing else. Defense alone has never been a reason for spot in the starting lineup for me. Time will tell, but I think if owings wants to secure himself as the 2B of the future he's gonna have to get hot at the plate. No room for 2 inept players at the plate in the lineup"
azdiamondbacks,3b4pw8,thekeymaker,2,Fri Jun 26 01:10:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's gonna be replaced by someone like Drury if he doesn't start swinging the bat and seriously improve his plate discipline.   I can't emphasize plate discipline enough with Owings, as he's been the worst in baseball among every day second basemen, even worse than Omar Infante. This graph shows that Owings is worst in the MLB when it comes to swinging at pitches outside of the strike zone, and also has the worst contact%. He needs to dial down the aggression and take more pitches."
azdiamondbacks,3b4pw8,uninan,6,Fri Jun 26 05:13:43 2015 UTC,"If I had to choose one right now I would pick Ahmed. He has looked a lot better at the plate, walking more and striking out less than CO. On top of that his defense is top notch. With that being said I like Chris Owings a lot too, he's fast, plays good defense, and I think he still has potential offensively."
azdiamondbacks,3b4pw8,Antarix,3,Fri Jun 26 01:59:57 2015 UTC,"For me, it's still to early to say. There's a lot to like there from both players, and I really think that both of them need to get a full year in the show before we can really say what's fair.   If you're holding a gun to my head and I have to pick right now? I'd go Owings. His ability to play both 2nd and SS at the major league level makes him a good piece to mix and match with Drury, who can play 2nd and 3rd base, while Swanson, who's obviously a little further down the road, can also play both 2nd and SS. Plus, before his shoulder injury, he was hitting like .280 through the first half of the year.   I would love to hold onto Ahmed though. Maybe turn him into a utility infielder. That defenese should play at just about every position besides catcher."
azdiamondbacks,3b4pw8,joecb91,3,Fri Jun 26 07:20:20 2015 UTC,"In the end, I think that Owings is going to at least return to SOME of his past form at the plate. Both of them are OBP black holes, Ahmed because he projects to be a guy who hits around .220 and at best he could reach .245 or .250 but he does have a good walk rate. Meanwhile Owings can have a solid batting average but he has horrible plate discipline and is more allergic to drawing walks than Trumbo was. I think that Owings will be a better bet for extra base hits as well.  My best hope for both of them OBP wise is around .310 or .320, but they will both do that in different ways.  Ahmed is the much better defender, he doesn't make a ton of the Simmons type jaw dropping plays but he does make most of the plays he does get to look routine. And Owings is solid enough to get the job done at shortstop or second base.  Owings was always going to have to adjust to MLB pitching exploiting his plate discipline issues, but more than anything else I think his problem this season is his shoulder being fucked up from last year and trying to change his swing to compensate for it.   Hopefully once everything there is settled down he can find some of his old form.  Right now, I'd go with Ahmed but I need to see what happens when Owings is fully recovered because I think he is still dealing with some issues from that injury."
azdiamondbacks,3b4pw8,mind_elevated,2,Fri Jun 26 21:15:22 2015 UTC,I think Ahmed should learn to play all positions and become our super utility guy of the future (replacing penny).  I like owning at 2nd I think he has a lot of potential offensively.  Dansby Swanson is the SS of our future. I think he could be the next Tulo.

azdiamondbacks,3b4m9c,SnakeBot,9,Thu Jun 25 22:45:45 2015 UTC,"Man I woke up ""early"" with the hopes of seeing us climb MT. 500 and I walk away disappointed.   Hill has to take some blame for that error and Yasmani for the 0/5 but our bullpen is really letting us down this year."

azdiamondbacks,3b4m9c,giantjensen,7,Thu Jun 25 22:57:43 2015 UTC,"It was a rough game. Really was. However, I was a bit disappointed in Yas. 0/5? I mean, come on man. You're better than that.  Also, why the fuck did they pull Ruby? Shouldn't you leave a pitcher in until he gets into trouble?  Also, Huddy seems pretty hot/cold since coming back. I hope he can work through it. Because when he is on, he is on."

azdiamondbacks,3b3dp1,Raptor231408,2,Thu Jun 25 22:03:52 2015 UTC,"Hindsight, etc.   Huddy had looked really good recently, so it seemed like the smart move to bring him in and close with Ziggy."
azdiamondbacks,3b3dp1,ellius,2,Thu Jun 25 22:02:55 2015 UTC,"nice work out there huddy, atta kid"
azdiamondbacks,3b3aeo,joecb91,4,Thu Jun 25 16:51:53 2015 UTC,"From an article Fangraphs just posted about this too  http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/dave-stewarts-misguided-comments-on-market-value/    Over the weekend, the Diamondbacks made a pretty controversial trade, selling Touki Toussaint to the Braves in exchange for $10 million in salary relief. I wrote up my thoughts on the deal on Monday, noting that while it’s certainly possible that the Diamondbacks have more information about Toussaint than other teams, it still seems like they simply misread the market value of a prospect in making this deal.  If you didn’t think that’s what happened a few days ago, you can be sure of it now, because in Ken Rosenthal’s latest column, Stewart says some things that, for a baseball executive to say publicly in 2015, are absolutely remarkable. And should scare the crap out of Diamondback fans.   Yep, I'm scared."
azdiamondbacks,3b3aeo,ellius,2,Thu Jun 25 17:08:45 2015 UTC,Oh God.
azdiamondbacks,3b3aeo,Antarix,10,Thu Jun 25 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"Now hold on folks. Before we all go shitting ourselves again. Lets think about Dave Stewarts trade record so far.   Turned Wade Miley into Rubby De La Rosa, Allen Webster, and saved the team a bunch of money Miley would have gotten in Arbitration. Got us out from under half of Cahills contract. Saved $20mill/year on Montero (say what you want about our lack of depth at catcher, he's not playing like he's worth $20mill/year) while getting us a top 20 prospect in Mejia, and a guy that could be Chase Anderson 2.0 in Zach Godley (a little bit older, but is having a really good year in the minors, and could move his way up). Turned the money that was saved, into Yasmany Tomas. Turned Didi Gregorious into Robbie Ray and Domingo Leyba. Turned Mark Trumbo and Vidal Nuno into Wellington Castillo, Dominic Leone, a top 10 prospect in Gabby Guerrero and a top 15 prospect in Jack Reinheimer.   So yeah, losing Touki at the price that we did sucks. But saying that Stewart has completely doomed us all in one trade seems like a massive over reaction. Particularly when you consider that young guys like Ray, De La Rosa, and Anderson are really panning out for us, Bradley and Corbin both coming back from injury (although it appears Bradley may have had a set back today), with Blair and Shipley lurking in the minors."
azdiamondbacks,3b3aeo,go_dbacks,5,Thu Jun 25 18:47:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this trade aside, Stewart has done a good job."
azdiamondbacks,3b3aeo,mrana,-2,Thu Jun 25 20:34:59 2015 UTC,"This makes no sense. Miley for de la Rosa was garbage in garbage out.  Anyone can dump salary, we paid half of what Cahill was owed and got nothing in return.  Montero isn't making $20m/yr. He's signed through 2017 @ $14m/yr and on his way to a 2.5-3war season.  That's worth more than his salary.  Stewart is going a shitty job and this move proves he's out of his league.  He's probably looking at the standings and thinking we have s shot at the wc."
azdiamondbacks,3b3aeo,Antarix,2,Sun Jun 28 02:36:20 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected on the how much Montero is making. I was wrong on that account.  Aside from that bit, I can't even be bothered to respond to how dumb this post is...."
azdiamondbacks,3b3aeo,mrana,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:56:01 2015 UTC,Yes please inform me of what a great job Stewart is doing. His two pitchers he picked up are the 8th and 18th worst when ranked by era.   Every journalist is laughing his ass off about the Touki trade.
azdiamondbacks,3b3aeo,Antarix,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:23:46 2015 UTC,"If by every journalist, you mean Keith Law, then sure. I guess I'll walk you through this even though I went through it in the OP.   I take it that you're grabbing those stats from Hellickson and De La Rosa? Hellickson was brought here as an experiment and offered to fill a spot in the rotation that otherwise probably would have gone to Cahill. Sure, we gave up 2 ranked 15-20 prospects to get him, but considering he was a former RoY, and could have a lot of upside if he bounce back from removing the bone chips in his elbow. It was a risk reward move that probably won't end up panning out, but if you're really salty about losing those two prospects, consider that we basically got them back in the Trumbo deal in the form of Gabby Guerrero and Jack Reinheimer.  As far as De La Rosa, if you do grade him by his ERA, it doesn't look very good, but he was brought here as an unfinished product. We've seen what Rubby can do when he's on; he's nearly unhittable. It's a matter of him gaining consistency that will determine his future success. You're also completely leaving out Robbie Ray, who was a Stewart acquisition, who would be ranked 5th in ERA if he qualified. He's also a rare commodity being a hard throwing left hander. I just don't see how you can look at what the two of them have done and say, ""Those guys are garbage and will always be garbage."" When Max Scherzer was 26, he had a 4.43 ERA, and Scherzer had pitched WAY more in the big leagues than De La Rosa has by that age.  Do you want me to go on? I could talk about how badly we fleeced Detroit in the Didi Gregorius trade. Or I could talk about the Trumbo trade, which is looking better and better for us everyday."
azdiamondbacks,3b3aeo,mrana,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:54:22 2015 UTC,"Now you are comparing Scherzer to Rubby?  You're cherry picking one season after three very good seasons.  Rubby wasn't a prospect, he never was.  Maybe he can stick around as a back of the rotation guy but he's not the type of guy a franchise needs to have.    Gurerro and Reiheimer aren't prospects either.  Being young doesn't make you a prospect, those guys are throw ins.  Castillo has had a couple nice games but I'm not going to get too excited about him.  Yes he has value as a catcher that can hit above replacement level.  That's how trades work, you are supposed to get some value.  Robbie Ray, how about we let him get a few innings before we say we've fleeced anyone, ok?  Scouts are still collecting data.    Anyways, it's not just the trades Stewart made, it's the entire organizational philosophy.  This team still isn't embracing advanced analytics."
azdiamondbacks,3b3aeo,Antarix,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:01:44 2015 UTC,"""Gurerro"" and ""Reiheimer"" are both in the top 10.  How is having a 97mph fastball and a power-change up, while receiving high praise from Pedro Martinez make a you not worth having around? He's a bullpen piece, at worst IMO.  Considering that Ray has done nothing but good things in the majors, and Didi is still hitting <.240 in his 3rd year in the majors as a 25 year old and Domingo Leyba is still lurking in the minors as a 19 year old top 10 prospect, I don't see how you can't be happy about that. Also, scouts collecting data? Come on mang. Scouts collect a report of what the player can and can't do. It's doesn't take 30 years of baseball experience that the guy is a 23 year old left, has a 97mph fastball, a strong change up, but struggles with command at times and currently lacks a put away. That's pretty much what a scout is going to tell you. All that can be done from this point is run him out there and see what he does.  I seriously don't know what else to tell you other than you're being a MASSIVE negative nancy. ""STEWART TRADED AWAY A PLAYER THAT 4 YEARS AWAY THAT WE HAVE DEPTH AT! BURN THIS THING TO THE GROUND AND START OVER."" Seriously, calm down and get some perspective. We're  currently within shouting distance of .500, which is a LOT better than anyone expected us to be this year. There are only 2 reasons I can see why this is happening. 1) Dave Stewart actually does know what he's doing. 2) Kevin Towers master plan is finally coming to fruition, and he was fired before his genius was fully recognized."
azdiamondbacks,3b3aeo,mrana,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:10:00 2015 UTC,"Top 10 in an organization with little depth is meaningless. And really, dating that towers had done master plan is so silly that I think you are just trolling. Towers traded Bauer for didi.  We'd be s he'll of a lot better with Bauer and Upton back than what we have now."
azdiamondbacks,3b3aeo,Antarix,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:23:08 2015 UTC,"So if KT didn't have a master plan, by process of elimination, we could say that Stewart has some hand in the success the team is having.   As far as the D'backs being an organization of ""little depth"", BaseballAmerica ranked the D'backs with the 6th best farm system. So sure, we lose Touki out of the Top 10, but we add Young and Swanson to that list, and you're looking at an organization that could be considered top 3 in baseball."

azdiamondbacks,3b1iny,Maz57,4,Thu Jun 25 05:31:18 2015 UTC,I'd guess it has something to do with the bullpen. Bad bullpens make deficits worse and worse deficits insurmountable.
azdiamondbacks,3b1iny,andrew02020,3,Thu Jun 25 05:34:24 2015 UTC,Good point. I would not have thought about it like that. When I see 0-29 after 8 innings my mind immediately blames the offense.

azdiamondbacks,3b08g6,go_dbacks,3,Thu Jun 25 01:38:46 2015 UTC,He's a liability defensively and bats about as well as Pacheco. It's a reach at best
azdiamondbacks,3b08g6,thekeymaker,2,Thu Jun 25 01:39:39 2015 UTC,It was worth the gamble.  Any word on what Pacheco's up to?

azdiamondbacks,3b08g6,HolyCelestia,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:48:32 2015 UTC,Let's think of this this way: if we won today we would be 1 game under .500 meaning we would certainly lose tomorrow. This way we have a chance!
azdiamondbacks,3b08g6,go_dbacks,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:36:06 2015 UTC,"Even better, if we get swept, we usually play great after that..."
azdiamondbacks,3azguc,parker_dub,12,Wed Jun 24 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"It's not like once we're at .500 we're satisfied, obviously everyone wants the DBacks as a winning team OVER .500. But we can't get that if we keep losing one, winning one, over and over. I'd just like to see some consistency and win a few in a row... against the Rockies it shouldn't be that difficult to accomplish."
azdiamondbacks,3azguc,amperx11,9,Wed Jun 24 19:22:58 2015 UTC,"The point isn't just getting to .500, its psyching ourselves for the next hurdle. Instead of ""were going to win the world series!""

azdiamondbacks,3axyzp,Raptor231408,11,Wed Jun 24 16:23:12 2015 UTC,Doesn't affraid of anything Castillo.
azdiamondbacks,3axyzp,adventurepony,6,Wed Jun 24 17:04:15 2015 UTC,Rolls right off the tongue.
azdiamondbacks,3axyzp,cthwholhu,6,Wed Jun 24 17:57:40 2015 UTC,"It was a pretty devastating blow losing home town hero Tuffy GOAT-sewisch. All things considered, he's done a very good job filling in. He's an excellent defender, calls a great game, and offers some pop as well.  I also think that he's part of the reasonthat the rotation has bounce back some. When Tuffy was catching everyday, the rotation was doing better than expected, but after he went down, and we were left with Salty catching most games, there was a noticable step backwards in quality from the starting pitchers, until Castillo came in.  I think there is seriously something to be said about having a catcher that calls a good game."
azdiamondbacks,3axyzp,Antarix,2,Wed Jun 24 21:06:30 2015 UTC,"Calling Tuffy a hometown hero is a bit of over exaggerating. Sorry if you meant this in sarcasm. I really didn't care for Tuffy as he was pathetic with a bat in his hand.   I remember after Castillo caught Hellickson for the first time he was raving about Castillo how he called the game and he was going out of his way to learn every pitcher. Castillo has been very good defensively, he knows when a pitcher doesn't have a pitch working very early and calls for a pitch more when a pitcher is feeling it that night.   I like the move"
azdiamondbacks,3axyzp,sparcos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:40:04 2015 UTC,"I mean, he's from Phoenix, and he was certainly a fan favorite for that fact. If we brought in a nameless catcher that had the exact same body of work as Tuffy, he would not have gotten nearly as much support from the fans. I'm fairly certain part of that is because he's from the valley. Whether or not he deserved it is up for interpretation.  On a similar not, Jesus Christ can I not wait to have Oscar Hernandez back to be the back up catcher. Salty is just horrible at catching baseballs.

If you need proof, consider this; in Spring training TLR said he expected the team to be at right around .500, and people scoffed at him. If Addison Reed had been just as shitty as we expected him to, instead of twice as shitty, we'd be right there, if not over .500. So, I don't think him saying this comes from a place of ignorance.   The one thing I'm afraid of is us going out and getting a guy that has his heart set on going into free agency.

I know the NHL offer a streaming option for all ""out of market"" games. So since you'd be out of market you could watch all dbacks games via a laptop or streaming device. Like I said I'm not sure if they offer this though.  Edit: here is a link for you http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/subscriptions/index.jsp?c_id=mlb"

I'm a Phoenix native but I've actually been in Dallas myself for the last 2 months and will be here atleast another. No where you go will play the dbacks game unless they have directv and the MLB package, which is rare, or the dbacks are playing the Rangers, which is rarer.   MLB TV is 100% worth it and not all that expensive. They were running some sort of deal around father's day that had it well below $100 for the rest of the season, but I'm not sure if that's still going on. It beats the pants off of worrying about finding a stream every night, which is almost always the other teams broadcast anyway, and then dealing with said stream.   Edit: to add on to this, you'd be better off finding a good bar with free WiFi and then stream the game on your phone if you're set on being out to watch the game. That is if you decide to go the MLB TV route."

azdiamondbacks,3aqi7e,Kelmon,8,Mon Jun 22 18:09:15 2015 UTC,"A bit dramatic maybe?   Meanwhile, we’ll have to sit back and watch this front office tear the team’s future down, one transaction at a time, unless they get their acts together quickly. And even then, it may be too late because you can’t fix a problem you don’t even acknowledge exists.   but the author made good points.  I think what we're all forgetting in this debate is the the season is called 162+.  That motto is on first, second, and third base.  It's on their hoodies.  It's probably on some office wall in some lame word cloud.  All I'm saying is we wait on the pessimism until after the trade deadline and see what this crew is all about."
azdiamondbacks,3aqi7e,Freyja_God,3,Mon Jun 22 18:34:21 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. The current administration is brand new and still needs to prove themselves. A trade that may have seemed very intelligent could turn out to be a disaster similar to how a trade that could be a disaster could be very intelligent. It wasn't more than a few months ago that we were talking about Tomás and our massive outfield, and how that trade might have been a failure. At this point in time it isn't. Tomás is playing very well and is an asset to the team. Like you said, let's give this administration time to settle in and let their decisions play out."

azdiamondbacks,3aqi7e,ThisMachineKILLS,3,Mon Jun 22 18:17:31 2015 UTC,I don't like how one (very) poor move is a condemnation on the ENTIRE new front office.

azdiamondbacks,3aqi7e,HometownJuke,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:43:41 2015 UTC,"because this trade is just so ridiculous that it brings into question the sanity of the new FO. ""wow, if they traded Touki to save 10mil, what else would they be willing to do"""
azdiamondbacks,3aqi7e,sparcos,2,Mon Jun 22 23:09:56 2015 UTC,"If that's the logic then I would point to the plenty of other great moves we have made that I have liked from this FO. Trading Cahill to get Bradley in the rotation, Jeremy Hellickson and Rubby De La Rosa have been solid, drafting college prospects, unloading Trumbo. All great moves in my opinion.  If I wake up tomorrow and found out we've traded Aaron Blair for cash then I'll be concerned. Until then I'm not buying into this ""FO selling our entire future"" talk."
azdiamondbacks,3aolm9,nradfo,11,Mon Jun 22 05:54:56 2015 UTC,"Here's the issue I take with moving Owings and calling up Drury. Owings is still only 23 years old, and we saw what he's capable of doing at the big league level when he's healthy. He was hitting close to .280 before he hurt his shoulder. He tried to come back in the last month of the year, but was obviously still hurting. He had off season surgery and didn't even swing a bat until about 2 weeks into spring training. Doctors said that he wouldn't have his full strength back until probably the all star break. I think right now, he's a young guy who's trying to do to much. He's looking to get a hit every single time he goes to the plate, instead of trying to just put together good at bats, and trying to see good pitches to hit. That too me looks like a guy who's trying to do to much.  The other issue I take, is that calling up Drury won't just magically fill the hole at 2nd base. Remember last year, Lamb was hitting .365 in Mobile, was the southern league MVP, and killed it in Reno. When he came up in the last month of 2014, his production wasn't good at all. Drury is hitting .278 in Mobile right now, so I doubt his transition will be very smooth right now.   I'm fine with moving Hill, but I think that we should look to move him for bullpen help rather than starting pitching. Put Gosselin in his spot. DFA Reed, call up Stites or Burgos when they're healthy or fill the hole with the pitcher we acquired. Just anyone besides Reed right now."
azdiamondbacks,3aolm9,Antarix,4,Mon Jun 22 06:37:33 2015 UTC,"I really like most of the players on this team and I feel that because the team is so young we should give these guys time. If you're not happy with Chris Owings you'd probably be disappointed with Drury if he was called up, CO is a young guy who was a top prospect for us, he deserves more of a chance.    The only players I would be okay with trading are Hill, Perez, and Reed but we can't really get much for them. Unfortunately we will probably see a fan favorite moved very soon if we expect anything big before the deadline."
azdiamondbacks,3aolm9,uninan,2,Mon Jun 22 08:54:14 2015 UTC,why in the world would you keep Ahmed over Owings?
azdiamondbacks,3aolm9,sparcos,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:11:34 2015 UTC,"Mainly because he is a true shortstop and will play everyday at SS, not to mention he is exceptional defender. His hitting will develop over time."

azdiamondbacks,3aolm9,Darkstargir,2,Tue Jun 23 01:01:24 2015 UTC,"Why would you ever trade a commodity in Owings? He does everything well and he's been heating as the season has progressed.  I like Drury and would love to see him at second but not at the price of Owings.   To answer your question though, trade Hill for anything. Peralta before his stock drops too much. Maybe move Pennington if there's any takers."

We now have a young decent and cheaper version of Hill and Pennington, who are both expensive, old, and declining. At the very least, we have their replacements for the future, or this year even, if either of them manage to get traded away even for garbage well release later a la Cahill style.   I'm not as upset with Touki as I am with Arroyo. He has collected a vast knowledge about various team and pitchers that would have been a valuable asset to all of our young arms currently on the team and coming up. Especially if the rumors of him retiring to find a pitching coach job after this year turn out to be true"
azdiamondbacks,3amvi5,Raptor231408,2,Sun Jun 21 21:55:23 2015 UTC,"I was actually talking to some friends about this, but if Bronson couldn't come bounce back from his Tommy Johns Surgery, I'd be more than happy extending an invitation to him to stay on the bench as a sort of assistant pitching coach. I said it all the way back to last season that Chase Anderson looks more and more and more like Bronson Arroyo everyday."
azdiamondbacks,3amvi5,akj80,3,Mon Jun 22 01:18:48 2015 UTC,"Overall, I agree that trading away Touki isn't nearly as big of a deal as people on this forum are making out. That being said, this passage is downright ridiculous:  Archie Bradley would be an ace at the MLB Level. Braden Shipley would be an even better MLB ace than Bradley. Rubby De La Rosa has already appeared to be nearly unhittable at times this year, even earning praise from Pedro Martinez, who commended De La Rosa’s potential, so Rubby would be considered a front end of the rotation guy, or potentially an MLB ace. Aaron Blair would be an ace in some rotations, but probably a very solid middle of the rotation pitcher. Robbie Ray would be a very solid middle of the rotation pitcher. Alex Young would be a very solid middle of the rotation pitcher, maybe even an ace. Then of course, Patrick Corbin would be a perennial Cy Young candidate.  If we're lucky, one of those guys will turn into a legit ace, and another one or two will be solid rotation guys. I think people tend to value prospects way too high in general. I mean people are comparing trading away Touki to trading away Scherzer for crying out loud. Then this guy claims Archie and Shipley will be aces, and Corbin will be a ""perennial Cy Young candidate""."
azdiamondbacks,3amvi5,joecb91,2,Mon Jun 22 04:36:21 2015 UTC,"One thing that you're not including is the sentence that I preface that exert with:   With all things being equal, lets also assume that all of the other young D’backs pitchers develop into what they could be.   Then I went on to what you quoted, it was a hypothetical situation. If everyone is up in arms about how much upside that Touki has, then why can't they see how much upside guys like Blair and Shipley and Young and Rubby, and even Lopez, who I forgot to add to this list to my own shame.   The point I was trying to get across was, we have a lot of guys that have a lot of upside, who are significantly closer to big league ready, or who are considered to have a better shot at living up to their potential. Everyone is so quick to just assume that Touki will develop into a star player. If people are making that assumption, it's only fair that they assume that all of the D'backs pitching prospects will live up to their potential.  So in short, I agree with you that we'd be lucky if one developed into an MLB ace. I was using a hypothetical situation in the article."

I don't like his comments about what he'd do if he caught it, and still not sure if I like the fact he doesn't want to give it up. It's a memento that A-Rod should have, imo, regardless of who he is or what he's done."

azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,BrandRage,11,Sun Jun 21 13:57:58 2015 UTC,"And sorry for the formatting, I don't usually post things and I suck at it."
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,Sargentk,12,Sun Jun 21 14:43:53 2015 UTC,I agree with 100% of what you said. I was thinking the same thing but you put it into words better than I ever could have. Dodgers fan or not this is a great perspective and we would be wise to stop acting like the sky has already finished falling and crushed us and wait for the dust to settle.
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,pablohoney102,14,Sun Jun 21 15:37:08 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I can't believe I agreed with, and upvoted a Dodgers fan..."
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,cakelorldeath,3,Sun Jun 21 14:33:33 2015 UTC,We all have our weak moments
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,flaming_scepter,6,Sun Jun 21 18:06:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the post /u/BrandRage this was actually fairly assuring. Although I just can't help but think that this is the Max Scherzer trade 2.0. TLR still has a master plan.
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,xSaintJimmy,6,Sun Jun 21 16:20:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, prospects fail all the time. Which is why you accumulate as many of them as possible. Fortunately for Braves fans, their FO knows that..."
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,Kelmon,8,Sun Jun 21 23:30:09 2015 UTC,"As for Touki? Why give a shit? This management team didn't draft him, maybe they don't like his makeup. Maybe if he becomes a productive starter in the bigs in a few years and the Dbacks are horrible and have zero pitching then get mad. Prospects are nothing until they actually do something.    This is wrong on so many levels. It is completely irrelevant if the management doesn't like him, trading isn't just about what you think of the assets you're selling off. Being able to understand how the market evaluates your assets is a crucial aspect of trading the team does not possess. Even if they have a crystal ball that tells them beyond a doubt Touki will be a bust, you don't look for a deal that gets you that kind of value. Touki is highly regarded within the industry and the return they got was pathetic. Being able to properly value assets is something this team has shown they cannot do time and time again."
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,Sandygonads,3,Sun Jun 21 16:43:29 2015 UTC,"You have to look at it both ways. Arroyo is 38+ coming off a terrible season and Tommy John... At that age it should be his career done. He's also owed $12million. That's an almost impossible piece to trade right there.   The only way to get someone to take him? Offer a reasonably good prospect in return. Don't forget the Dbacks are the only team that gets to see every second of baseball Touissant plays, whether it be bullpen, sim games, actual games whatever. They can have come to the conclusion he won't amount to much in this league. Something we won't know until 10 years in the future."
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,Kelmon,4,Sun Jun 21 19:15:15 2015 UTC,You could not sign Touki for $12M if he was a free agent and that's essentially what this deal is valuing him at.
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,uninan,2,Sun Jun 21 19:41:23 2015 UTC,But they also came to that conclusion with Max Scherzer
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,Sandygonads,2,Sun Jun 21 19:34:54 2015 UTC,"That is true, maddeningly."
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,CHAARRGER,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:40:15 2015 UTC,"This team? Are we talking about Towers or the group that brought us Webster, Ray, and Tomás, and then gave jobs to guys that earned it out of spring training? From my view they've done a pretty OK job so far."
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,Kelmon,5,Sun Jun 21 18:12:19 2015 UTC,They also tendered Reed and blew through the international signing pool for Yoan Lopez and now they've done this. It's been a mixed bag at best.
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,Raptor231408,3,Sun Jun 21 18:14:34 2015 UTC,Is Yoan Lopez a terrible player or something? Everyone's saying that was a bad signing on r/baseball and just leaving it at that with no details
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,Kelmon,3,Sun Jun 21 18:26:38 2015 UTC,"It's not so much about him being a bad player, it's that they now cannot sign anyone eligible under the international pool rules for the next two signing periods. That's a very hefty sacrifice for Lopez. Especially with all the talent upcoming in the next period."
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,CHAARRGER,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:31:29 2015 UTC,"Hey want to know something? Excluding last night Reed has given up 2 runs in his last 10 appearances neither of which were game breakers. And lets be honest, it wasn't Reed's fault we lost that game, our offence couldn't do shit. Since moving him from the closer's spot he's been a solid reliever.   Also we don't know how much Yoan is going to add to the team when he's major league ready so that could turn out to be a good signing too.   So match those two uncertain to ""eh"" moves against all the other solid ones made I'm going to wait this one out before crying foul."
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,Kelmon,3,Sun Jun 21 18:24:41 2015 UTC,"Did I blame him for that game? And he's been awful this year. His ERA is nearly 6. Whitewash it all you want. Also, you don't judge deals off ""well, it may work out, it may not, let's just see."" That is an awful criteria. We may not know what these prospects will be but selling a lottery ticket that could win you 5,000,000 for a lottery ticket that could win you 1,000,000 is a bad idea."
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,CHAARRGER,2,Sun Jun 21 18:29:30 2015 UTC,His era is nearly 6 because of his awful early season. People are quick to want him off the team every time he screws up a little when in fact recently he's been a solid reliever. As the numbers I just put up show.   Also I'm judging this trade based off of so far they've done a good job so i'm assuming they know more than me and have a plan or strategy involving it.
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,uninan,3,Sun Jun 21 18:46:03 2015 UTC,His era is nearly 7 for his last 11 appearances.
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,Raptor231408,2,Sun Jun 21 19:33:38 2015 UTC,"If you throw 4 pitches, a strike out and a home run, you're ERA is 27.   Every out you get, a run scores. ERA is a finicky stat. Like the other guy said, excluding last night, he's had 2 earned runs in 10 appearances. Everyone has a bad inning after doing well for 10. That's just regression to the mean"
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,Kelmon,2,Sun Jun 21 22:01:56 2015 UTC,You're seriously defending Addison Reed? The guy walking 4 batters per nine innings this season? The guy with the career ERA well over 4?
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,Raptor231408,2,Sun Jun 21 22:17:49 2015 UTC,"I'll give credit where credits due, man. I congratulate my worst employees for going the extra effort to clean an oven they don't normally clean. Likewise I'll credit one of our worst pitchers for doing well when he actually performs well."
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,Kelmon,2,Sun Jun 21 22:20:06 2015 UTC,"They may have a plan going forward, that doesn't excuse the lack of return here. And good for Reed that he had a nice stretch of games. He's still been awful overall and will continue to be."
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,Kelmon,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:40:37 2015 UTC,"What do you think they could have gotten for him? He's an A level 19 year old with a ton of potential except for his command issues. How many guys do you think fit that description in the minors in the last 30 years?   I know the Scherzer trade has tainted any deal including a pitcher for this fan base, probably for the next 20 years. And him almost pitching a perfect game the same day of the trade didn't help. Could they have gotten more for him? Depends on what you were shopping for. But the people in charge, who have been doing this for awhile and have a specific plan have decided they need to shave Arroyo more than they need a 19 year old prospect with command issues. Don't act like they traded Byron Buxton or Julio Urias.   Look, any deal that sets back a division rival is okay with me but I doubt you will feel this trade at all. I could be wrong but the percentages are that I am right."
azdiamondbacks,3alsqn,FaultyTerror,2,Sun Jun 21 21:53:58 2015 UTC,"They essentially sold him for $10M. You couldn't come close to getting a prospect like Touki for that if he was a free agent. He may not be the top prospect in the DBacks organization or the Braves, but he is a top 100 guy by any list. What you fail to understand is it's not about ""feeling"" this trade, it's about the organization selling an asset and not recognizing it's worth on the market. If you don't think they could have gotten more for him that is utterly laughable."
azdiamondbacks,3al2v7,Kelmon,10,Sun Jun 21 06:35:18 2015 UTC,"Where's La Russa in this? I have to believe he would've laughed at this upon hearing about it. One would believe he has to have a pretty solid grasp on how to build a successful team. I'd like to think they would only do this because it's part of a larger plan we're not seeing yet, some sacrificing the rook early type shit. However, this trade is fucking stupid and everybody knows it. Lost the rook to get a pawn. Chess."

azdiamondbacks,3al2v7,Darkstargir,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:33:40 2015 UTC,The clock is definitely ticking.  The casual fan won't notice immediately. But that could change very quickly if something doesnt happen.
azdiamondbacks,3al2v7,edtehgar,3,Mon Jun 22 01:20:03 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. The lack of value we get in return for shipping off top prospects is mind-numbing. With teams like SF and LAD in our division with very respectable analytics departments, and more money to spend, we have no chance of keeping up with these dopes running shop."
azdiamondbacks,3al2v7,thekeymaker,3,Sun Jun 21 07:53:57 2015 UTC,The only thing I could possibly think of is that Touki has some type of major roadblock that has yet to go public.

azdiamondbacks,3akqke,joecb91,9,Sun Jun 21 05:50:48 2015 UTC,There has to be something coming up after this. Right? Right? Please?
azdiamondbacks,3akqke,BeerOnTheSun,10,Sun Jun 21 04:11:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, losing Toussaint blows HARD, and there's no question that the D'backs are ""the losers"" of this trade.   I think of it this way. Say the D'backs want to get back to spending $110mill in player salary. That's what they had in 2014, and Derrick Hall said they are willing to spend even more in the future. The difference that they save is the difference between having $44million in payroll space if you don't move Arroyo, and $53million if you do move him.   That amount of money (with maybe a little more) could get the D'backs Matt Wieters, Tyler Clippard AND Jordan Zimmerman, all 3 of them, in one off season.   With how much young controlable pitching the D'backs have, plus the fact that we have AT VERY LEAST 3 more years of drafts before Touki could debut, this isn't NEARLY as bad as what KT has done in the past.  Remember, Dave Stewart is the man that turned Wade Miley into Rubby De La Rosa, and Allen Webster. He turned Didi Gregorius into Robbie Ray and Domingo Ayala. He turned Mark Trumbo into Willington Castillo, a top 10 prospect, and a top 15 prospect. He turned Trevor Cahill into.... An open spot on the 25 man roster and got us like half of the money we owed him back.   The point is, nobody could unfuck-up what Kevin Towers did over night. It's gonna take sometime, and it's gonna take some moves, but at the end of the day, the D'backs are still doing much better than ANYONE in the league expected them to do, and we have Dave Stewart to thank for that.   IMO, he's deserved our trust at the very least, that he'll make this work to his advantage."
azdiamondbacks,3akqke,Antarix,2,Sun Jun 21 10:23:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed 100%. I think the front office is looking at what we have in Goldy, and to a lesser extent Pollock, Yasmani, Ender, and the up and coming young arms, and they figure we have a window of 3-4 years with this core group to make a run at things. This isn't the kind of organization that will be able to re-sign all our young talent when they start being eligible for free agency.  Chances are, Touki isn't a major contributor to the major league club in that 3-4 year time frame, so he doesn't fit into the plan. Also gotta remember, he just turned 19 and has a 3.5 ERA in A ball right now, so it's certainly no guarantee he ever even gets to the majors. Gosselin is 26 and likely won't cost too much over the next few years, and it sounds like he'll be a solid role player and able to contribute. So while I wish we could have kept Touki, I don't think the trade is as bad as everyone's making it out to be.  Just have to trust that the front office is willing to spend some money soon on a quality starting pitcher or two. While we have some promising young arms, I don't think they're enough to make the D-Backs serious contenders any time soon."

Idk about that man, we were rattled by injuries all year last year which made us that bad. I think it's more of us being healthy as opposed to what Dave Stewart has done.

azdiamondbacks,3akqke,TropangTexter,11,Sun Jun 21 07:57:27 2015 UTC,"Not exactly stoked about this trade, but everything I ever heard about Touki was that he's at best a long long ways off and has to develop much better command.  Don't know much about this Gosselin guy, but from a quick glance at baseball-reference.com, it looks like he'll be a better bat than any of our other current backup infield options (better than Owings and Ahmed too). And he's only 26, so has the potential to be around for awhile while Pennington and Hill are getting older."
azdiamondbacks,3akqke,akj80,4,Sun Jun 21 04:03:53 2015 UTC,"Gosselin is what he is, what you see is what you get. This is his upside."
azdiamondbacks,3akqke,ATL_GritzBlitz,6,Sun Jun 21 04:15:15 2015 UTC,Goose has got some good speed and decent hands. Makes good contact. He's a very solid bench bat
azdiamondbacks,3akqke,SidBreamTrackTeam,2,Sun Jun 21 04:06:34 2015 UTC,"Good bat off the bench, as others have said. He hits well in clutch situations too. Braves got the better end of this trade in material, but you won't be upset with Gosselin."
azdiamondbacks,3akqke,Xeno4494,2,Sun Jun 21 04:31:37 2015 UTC,Goose is a super sub who can hit a little bit.  Nice guy to have on your bench and that is about it.  Think Mark DeRosa type player.

azdiamondbacks,3akqke,xSaintJimmy,9,Sun Jun 21 06:22:26 2015 UTC,From what Stew is saying it sounds like he is very confident in the college arms having quick development and quickly making it to the bigs.
azdiamondbacks,3akqke,HometownJuke,3,Sun Jun 21 04:12:20 2015 UTC,Isn't every GM confident about the arms they draft only for most of them to fall on their feet?
azdiamondbacks,3akqke,GoldysMassiveArms,8,Sun Jun 21 04:20:58 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I'm just saying that Bradley, Ray, Blair, Webster and Shipley are all ahead of Touki.

azdiamondbacks,3akqke,TropangTexter,3,Sun Jun 21 04:30:58 2015 UTC,Stewart looks super fucking pissed during/after his interviews.  Why wouldn't you just ditch Arroyo for a prospect?   Why throw in Touki? And they've been working on it for a while and were only able to complete it today (Touki's 19th birthday).  There's something real fuckin' fishy here.
azdiamondbacks,3akqke,ellius,2,Sun Jun 21 05:33:15 2015 UTC,Ownership mandate? Kendrick wanted more money for his baseball cards?
azdiamondbacks,3akqke,Claytonbigsby54,2,Sun Jun 21 05:48:22 2015 UTC,He could have ditched Arroyo's money in a trade without having to throw in Toussaint.  Maybe he's shown something health-wise that they're really concerned with.

azdiamondbacks,3akqke,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Sun Jun 21 13:32:14 2015 UTC,"Could we have traded other people for Gosselin? Maybe.  Is Gosselin completely useless? Not at all. He's a much much much cheaper and younger Pennington/Hill. And all of you have been complaining about them in the lineup over Lamb/Ahmed all year.  Is trading away one of our top prospects a bad thing? He's only 19 and may very well bust. It's my understanding that he wanted to pitch his way and wasn't going along with how the organization wanted. That should throw up some flags right there. You have a prospect that you're trying to improve, yet he's resistant to change that may be for the better?  Personally, I'm sad about the Arroyo trade more than our prospect. There's a devouring theme that as soon as pitchers come to Arizona, they suck, and as soon as they leave, they magically become Cy Young incarnate. It was speculated that when Arroyos contract ended, he might have become a pitching coach. With his lengthy career, he has built up a very very very vast knowledge, not only about other pitchers, but how other teams pitching staffs opperste as well. THAT is a huge asset to just dump for $9mil  Is it a shocking trade? Of course. Do all trades like this actually end up with one team ass raping the other? Absolutely not. Is the world going to end because we traded away a top prospect? Hardly."

azdiamondbacks,3ak5nb,HoopAndHarm,3,Sun Jun 21 02:54:31 2015 UTC,He just swung at 3 balls in a row.
azdiamondbacks,3ak5nb,-Lysosome-,3,Sun Jun 21 02:55:21 2015 UTC,Tyson Ross is not Cy Young. I'm hoping that realization comes across the next run through the order.

azdiamondbacks,3agotv,reallydumb4real,5,Sat Jun 20 00:34:14 2015 UTC,All depends on what you want. Don't give in. Know your sections and prices at the gate. Try to know where you want to sit beforehand.   Low ball them at first see what there compromise is. If its high meet them at the price you want to pay. If theg say no move on to the next guy. Plenty of scalpers to go around. Theres guys right accross from thw box office and normally guys on the corner of the parking garage and us airways.   The later you go in the cheaper you can get. Don't pay more than 10 for upper and 15 for bleacher.

azdiamondbacks,3ab448,amperx11,2,Thu Jun 18 20:06:33 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I was saying that yesterday. Does Lamb have bad splits or something? I was surprised y'all didn't pinch hit Lamb for Hill last night after you knocked out the lefty. Not to mention how is he going to learn to hit lefties if he never sees them. Gotta plan for the future.
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,andrew02020,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:07:59 2015 UTC,his double A splits between lefties and righties are not indicative of a left-handed hitter struggling against left-handed pitchers.

azdiamondbacks,3ab448,andrew02020,2,Thu Jun 18 21:06:15 2015 UTC,I think Allen needs to be in the bullpen. Always loses it after 5
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,andrew02020,3,Thu Jun 18 21:09:03 2015 UTC,"This is only his second start, he did much better last week"
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,amperx11,2,Thu Jun 18 21:12:56 2015 UTC,I've been watching him since before he was a diamondback. He lost his command in the sixth last week. Couldn't seem to consistently make it past the sixth with the Red Sox either.
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,andrew02020,2,Thu Jun 18 21:15:12 2015 UTC,OMG FUCK THE BULLPEN!
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,bombld,2,Thu Jun 18 21:12:52 2015 UTC,Stop the bleeding!

azdiamondbacks,3ab448,mbarnar,2,Thu Jun 18 21:18:01 2015 UTC,Meltdown.
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,parker_dub,2,Thu Jun 18 21:22:10 2015 UTC,"So looking into it, Lamb is hitting .321 against righties and .250 against lefties. He has 59 total plate appearances against righties and only six against lefties. In those 59 PAs, he has 17 hits, five doubles, one triple, one homer, 10 RBIs, six walks, and eight Ks. In those 6 PAs, one hit, two walks, and two Ks.  Aaron Hill, on the other hand, is hitting .223 against righties and .239 against lefties. He has 104 PAs against righties, 50 against lefties. Against righties, 21 hits, five doubles, three homers, 13 RBIs, 8 walks, and 16 Ks. Lefties, 11 hits, two RBIs, four walks, and nine Ks.  Why is Hill still starting?"
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,bp9801,4,Thu Jun 18 22:11:23 2015 UTC,"While I agree, let's not fall into the trap of blaming this game on that coaches decision.  This was a total collapse in all phases of the game."
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,mbarnar,2,Thu Jun 18 22:18:49 2015 UTC,I'm just trying to figure out why Lamb plays so inconsistently and Hill seems to be in more often than not.
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,bp9801,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:23:09 2015 UTC,Chip said he is still weary of Lamb's foot and not ready to throw him in 100% yet.. Maybe stuff behind the scenes we don't see.
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,mbarnar,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:35:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well if that's the case, that's a pretty good reason then. Want him all the way back healthy before tossing him in there."
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,bp9801,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:37:59 2015 UTC,I can't say for certain but I'm pretty sure I just heard Steve say that a few games ago.
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,mbarnar,3,Fri Jun 19 13:05:40 2015 UTC,Ridiculous.. Lamb should be playing every game
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,amperx11,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:15:07 2015 UTC,Most definitely. Maybe Hill will get traded soon before his value plummets to that of a hot dog.
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,bp9801,3,Thu Jun 18 22:19:42 2015 UTC,"I know it is AA, but last year at Mobile, Lamb hat 97 at bats against left-handed pitching:  .340/.414/.557, 33 hits, 8 doubles, 2 triples, 3 home runs, 19 RBI, 12 walks, 22 SO's.  i mean, yeah it is double A, but he has hit lefties at levels down before. this is just ridiculous on so many levels."
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,TropangTexter,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:17:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed, his minor league numbers against lefties are pretty damn good. At least give him the chance to prove one way or the other that he can hit against MLB lefties instead of forcing him to sit no matter what."
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,bp9801,2,Thu Jun 18 22:19:07 2015 UTC,"how will he learn to hit left-handed pitching in the Majors, if it really is a huge and insurmountable struggle (ala Peralta) if he just gets babied and sits every day?"
azdiamondbacks,3ab448,TropangTexter,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:20:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe if Lamb heads to winter ball and does well against lefties, they'll give him a chance."

azdiamondbacks,3a8bra,ddt9,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:41:43 2015 UTC,"Way to keep him in the yard, Gio."
azdiamondbacks,3a92ba,SnakeBot,13,Thu Jun 18 04:53:53 2015 UTC,Goldy is on a whole different level right now. His play is poetry in motion. He can play amazing defense and he is one of the top batters in the league. Truly a treat to watch him.
azdiamondbacks,3a92ba,GoldysMassiveArms,3,Thu Jun 18 05:04:13 2015 UTC,He is THE top batter right now
azdiamondbacks,3a92ba,Charlottemaybe1,2,Thu Jun 18 06:01:52 2015 UTC,"Did he finally surpass Harpers stats? Good for him, he's definitely earned the top spot. Maybe this year he won't be robed of an MVP"
azdiamondbacks,3a92ba,Raptor231408,2,Thu Jun 18 10:29:21 2015 UTC,He's top by batting average but not HR
azdiamondbacks,3a92ba,Charlottemaybe1,10,Thu Jun 18 14:24:54 2015 UTC,Defense wins ballgames. That's the main difference I see between the two teams I watch every day. The D-backs don't make stupid plays in the field.
azdiamondbacks,3a92ba,andrew02020,4,Thu Jun 18 05:00:09 2015 UTC,They are top 5 in errors I believe (least errors) in the majors
azdiamondbacks,3a92ba,parker_dub,5,Thu Jun 18 05:21:29 2015 UTC,Also #4 by defensive fWAR.
azdiamondbacks,3a92ba,andrew02020,8,Thu Jun 18 05:32:02 2015 UTC,Goldschmidt is the best Athlete in AZ right now! I can't believe he is ours
azdiamondbacks,3a92ba,DixieRektt,8,Thu Jun 18 05:21:17 2015 UTC,Also we are the only NL West team to put up a W today.
azdiamondbacks,3a92ba,GoldysMassiveArms,5,Thu Jun 18 05:35:18 2015 UTC,Second time in 3 days.
azdiamondbacks,3a92ba,-Lysosome-,5,Thu Jun 18 05:47:09 2015 UTC,This team is on the rise!
azdiamondbacks,3a92ba,ilonzo,8,Thu Jun 18 05:19:08 2015 UTC,Chase Anderson is legit
azdiamondbacks,3a92ba,TropangTexter,6,Thu Jun 18 05:37:43 2015 UTC,"Dodgers, Giants, Padres, and Rockies all lost. Diamondbacks won! Good day of baseball!"
azdiamondbacks,3a92ba,bp9801,5,Thu Jun 18 05:36:19 2015 UTC,"Oooooh shit.   Angels are .500 - D'backs are a win away.   We take their .500 from them, and keep it for ourselves. It makes perfect sense.  Someone get a live rooster and let's make this happen!"
azdiamondbacks,3a92ba,ellius,3,Thu Jun 18 08:08:11 2015 UTC,I have a spare sacrificial goat and some tears of orphans.
azdiamondbacks,3a84lr,SnakeBot,7,Wed Jun 17 23:46:42 2015 UTC,are you going on the 15 day DL?
azdiamondbacks,3a84lr,adventurepony,5,Thu Jun 18 03:44:24 2015 UTC,Did you get to keep the ball at least?
azdiamondbacks,3a84lr,amperx11,5,Thu Jun 18 03:45:51 2015 UTC,Do you have a goose egg like Archie?
azdiamondbacks,3a84lr,bp9801,9,Thu Jun 18 03:50:23 2015 UTC,I think Goldy is more important than food to my overall health.

azdiamondbacks,3a84lr,andrew02020,7,Thu Jun 18 01:51:52 2015 UTC,Holy shit Ahmed.
azdiamondbacks,3a84lr,andrew02020,7,Thu Jun 18 03:23:15 2015 UTC,That play was absolutely insane.
azdiamondbacks,3a84lr,HoopAndHarm,7,Thu Jun 18 03:25:43 2015 UTC,BTW in games I've watched since I've been subscribed the D-backs are 4-1. Could I be a good luck charm?

azdiamondbacks,3a84lr,brandonatron,4,Thu Jun 18 02:19:55 2015 UTC,I would if y'all had Allen Webster flair.  Edit: it's really small. Is that Yasmany?

azdiamondbacks,3a84lr,parker_dub,6,Thu Jun 18 01:50:52 2015 UTC,Remember Goldy had 19 HRs early August last year.
azdiamondbacks,3a84lr,-Lysosome-,5,Thu Jun 18 01:53:21 2015 UTC,It's crazy that he already has as many homers as he did all of last year 1/3 of the way into the season
azdiamondbacks,3a84lr,go_dbacks,3,Thu Jun 18 01:59:18 2015 UTC,"He's nearly matched last year's numbers (already surpassed in some categories, actually) in little more than half the games."

azdiamondbacks,3a84lr,go_dbacks,4,Thu Jun 18 04:33:52 2015 UTC,I don't know. In A ball he was walking a ton of batters but nobody could hit him. Today he gave up 3 walks and 3 hits in an inning of work. Gotta feel bad for the kid. Probably had a huge confidence blow because the Mets made a stupid decision.

They usually don't see attendance change based on record until the next season.  This team is going to have trouble selling tickets until they're able to string a few good years together."

azdiamondbacks,3a7a59,Antarix,4,Wed Jun 17 20:02:39 2015 UTC,"AAA is basically players that are on stand by for the big leagues.   It's a lot shorter of a flight from most AAA clubs to their big league affiliates, and they're often in the same time zone.

azdiamondbacks,3a4kri,go_dbacks,12,Wed Jun 17 04:44:25 2015 UTC,That would be a terrible trade for the DBacks. Almost as terrible as Gambo is at talk radio.
azdiamondbacks,3a4kri,Kelmon,3,Wed Jun 17 18:21:58 2015 UTC,"Yep, easily my lest favorite of the valley sport radio shows"

azdiamondbacks,3a4kri,DoOgSauce,4,Wed Jun 17 16:38:45 2015 UTC,This. I love the D-backs. I have a souvenir bat signed by Travis Lee from exhibition games in Yuma. I went to a bunch of games inaugural season. I would tell them to fuck off so quick if Goldy got traded.
azdiamondbacks,3a4kri,drDekaywood,9,Thu Jun 18 05:01:36 2015 UTC,The only correct answer is no one.
azdiamondbacks,3a4kri,swagchef1,11,Wed Jun 17 06:18:20 2015 UTC,Why would we trade the best first baseman in all of baseball for anyone not named Kershaw.   Edit: and they probably wouldn't even accept a deal from the Dodgers because that would keep goldy in the west
azdiamondbacks,3a4kri,Fannatick,6,Wed Jun 17 05:20:57 2015 UTC,Had to comment on this: No.
azdiamondbacks,3a4kri,this_is_poorly_done,5,Wed Jun 17 13:36:36 2015 UTC,"it was like in the offseason some Boston writer started talking about a Pedroia-Goldschmidt trade between Boston and AZ.  People think because the Dbacks are a mediocre to not so good team right now, we'd be willign to agree to just about any trade.  We are paying one of the top five players in baseball 3 million this year, 6 million next year, and 9 the following year .  Not to mention he was drafted and came up in our organization, you can't replace that marketing ability.  The package we would need to get rid of Goldie would have to be so insane any other team probably wouldn't do it.  Syndergaard and Duda while a good combo is still not enough.  Duda isn't worth as much as Goldie is, and Syndergaard, while talented, isn't proven enough either to make me feel comfortable with that trade.  And even getting those two wouldn't be saving a whole lot of money considering how team friendly Goldie's deal is."
azdiamondbacks,3a4kri,Raptor231408,5,Wed Jun 17 15:17:11 2015 UTC,I thought I read somewhere that Goldy was originally a Dodger draftee
azdiamondbacks,3a4kri,this_is_poorly_done,8,Wed Jun 17 16:41:48 2015 UTC,"He was drafted by the Dodgers out of HS, but he went to play baseball at TSU instead, at which he was drafted by Arizona three years later. He's never played professionally for any organization other than the Dback's."
azdiamondbacks,3a4kri,groovygarrett,4,Wed Jun 17 16:51:32 2015 UTC,You don't trade elite players for unproven but talented prospects and an average first basemen. Teams would have to clear their entire farm system for someone like Goldschmidt. They'd also have to provide proper defenses from the war Dbacks fans would bring upon the front office.
azdiamondbacks,3a4kri,Antarix,6,Wed Jun 17 18:22:43 2015 UTC,"I would need Syndergaard, Matz, and Plawecki guranteed before I would even sit down and talk with the Mets about trading Goldy. After that I would need at least 1 more player as a kicker."
azdiamondbacks,3a4kri,DixieRektt,4,Wed Jun 17 22:53:36 2015 UTC,I would never watch anorher dbacks game in my life!
azdiamondbacks,3a4kri,kittypoop,5,Wed Jun 17 21:22:37 2015 UTC,That's what they talk about on NY talk radio? That's pathetic.

azdiamondbacks,3a3qid,mbarnar,4,Wed Jun 17 02:02:28 2015 UTC,Dorn in the 2 hole? How very interesting.
azdiamondbacks,3a3qid,Sandygonads,3,Wed Jun 17 02:09:32 2015 UTC,Dorn can hit.

azdiamondbacks,3a3qid,-Lysosome-,5,Wed Jun 17 03:46:27 2015 UTC,This is the key inning for Hellickson.
azdiamondbacks,3a3qid,-Lysosome-,3,Wed Jun 17 03:49:13 2015 UTC,Damn it..  LET'S GET THAT RUN BACK
azdiamondbacks,3a3qid,ilonzo,5,Wed Jun 17 03:59:29 2015 UTC,Ugh I just got the least surprising notification of all time. Just when you think things are cruising along.

azdiamondbacks,3a08h3,SnakeBot,10,Tue Jun 16 05:19:05 2015 UTC,"I was sitting along the third base line, upper deck, wondering out loud to my girlfriend why on earth Pennington was in the outfield. I'm saying to her, ""just move Tomas from DH to right field and then shift someone into the DH spot!"" She didn't know what any of that meant.   Cue like six fly balls in a row going to Pennington and him getting them with ease. Then he throws a runner out at second, and I realized that I was a fool.   Penny may give me the fits, but he's a good guy to have around."

azdiamondbacks,39yhdg,brandonatron,6,Mon Jun 15 20:59:19 2015 UTC,no charge for the ticket
azdiamondbacks,39yhdg,dhustead,6,Mon Jun 15 20:42:09 2015 UTC,"I'll be there in spirit, not a creepy spirit tho. I hope I can make it to chase this summer."
azdiamondbacks,39yhdg,dhustead,3,Mon Jun 15 21:22:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I just want to know why you have a creepy version of your spirit self"
azdiamondbacks,39yhdg,OAKgravedigger,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:36:38 2015 UTC,It comes in handy
azdiamondbacks,39yhdg,dhustead,4,Tue Jun 16 01:29:09 2015 UTC,/u/ilonzo you had me at free beer!
azdiamondbacks,39vjat,Cooleybob,14,Mon Jun 15 03:41:33 2015 UTC,It isn't even hot yet
azdiamondbacks,39vjat,PR151,11,Mon Jun 15 04:25:14 2015 UTC,Lol celcius...
azdiamondbacks,39vjat,RavianNightmare,8,Mon Jun 15 04:23:43 2015 UTC,"Lol yeah! I was considering doing fahrenheit, but then I wouldn't be true to my metric roots."
azdiamondbacks,39vjat,HilariousScreenname,6,Mon Jun 15 04:39:02 2015 UTC,Make sure you're drinking plenty of water!
azdiamondbacks,39vjat,uninan,5,Mon Jun 15 04:25:05 2015 UTC,"Yep the weather this time of year is bad, incredibly hot almost feels like an oven. Hopefully your trip doesn't scare you away from Phoenix for life haha, the weather here is pretty great for half the year.    It's actually common to have the roof open in April and May, but the roof allows us to go to a game with comfortable weather during the hotter months.    Be sure to drink a lot of water when you're here and don't plan on doing outdoor activities during the day. Shorts and a T shirt a must, also a hat and sunglasses would be beneficial to bring."
azdiamondbacks,39vjat,Raptor231408,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:40:50 2015 UTC,"He's visiting Phoenix, so he has the option of going to one of the three water parks. So there's that if he wants to leave the hotel or whatever for the day"
azdiamondbacks,39vjat,sorell42,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:13:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I wish we were staying longer because I'd love to see the Grand Canyon. We're staying at my mom's friend's place in Scottsdale and she says that a trip to the Grand Canyon is far enough that it should be an over nighter.
azdiamondbacks,39vjat,Antarix,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:58:30 2015 UTC,"It's about three hours each way, so it can be a day trip. It's just a long drive. It's significantly cooler there too."
azdiamondbacks,39vjat,this_is_poorly_done,3,Mon Jun 15 15:52:20 2015 UTC,"Pro-tip: Drink lots of water. Then when you think you've had enough water, drink more water.  Most people in Phoenix don't go outside unless they have to this time of year. It's mostly an exercise in scampering from one air conditioned place to another. Usually this time of year, they won't open up the roof, which is a shame but it beats the heck out of having to deal with the heat.   They did open it before one of the games last home stand, so there is a chance."
azdiamondbacks,39vjat,rydog02,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:48:14 2015 UTC,"And if you're drinking that much water, don't forget to up your sodium intake a little as well."
azdiamondbacks,39vjat,rydog02,2,Mon Jun 15 15:12:35 2015 UTC,The outdoor activities tend to be done early morning unless it's swimming at a pool then anytime for that really. Enjoy the game! I cNt wait to find some free time to watch some games there this summer
azdiamondbacks,39vjat,rydog02,2,Mon Jun 15 06:46:16 2015 UTC,Thanks! I get too stoked to see games because I don't get to that often. Kinda makes it more special but it still would be wonderful to live somewhere that has a team.
azdiamondbacks,39vjat,Teb-Tenggeri,2,Mon Jun 15 12:00:14 2015 UTC,Yes agree. Having the DBacks here is amazing. Before it was only the suns. When we first had the DBacks here they used to do $1 seats to fill the stands the day of.   Do you already have tickets for the games or plan on buying once you get here?
azdiamondbacks,39vjat,Freyja_God,2,Mon Jun 15 14:30:35 2015 UTC,The Internet where we're staying is pretty poor so I haven't been able to Reddit much haha. We bought tickets once we got here. We were behind the visitors dugout last night and now we're in left field down the third base foul line.
azdiamondbacks,39vjat,joeeeeee_,2,Thu Jun 18 20:38:43 2015 UTC,Oh so cool. I had a couple coupons could have given you since I will be traveling most of July and I work too much in August and September. Glad to hear you're enjoying it. I almost went today myself.
azdiamondbacks,39up8x,ilonzo,25,Sun Jun 14 23:05:58 2015 UTC,Are we the best team in baseball?  No.  Are we going to be the best team in baseball?  Yes.
azdiamondbacks,39up8x,Freyja_God,16,Mon Jun 15 00:17:04 2015 UTC,If pitching is your problem I think you guys are going to be fine.
azdiamondbacks,39up8x,andrew02020,12,Sun Jun 14 23:08:40 2015 UTC,"The Ghost of Diamondback Heath Bell still haunts the bullpen.  So yeah, we still got a pitching problem"
azdiamondbacks,39up8x,andrew02020,7,Sun Jun 14 23:16:42 2015 UTC,I do think you made some great moves in the offseason to shore up your pitching though. It'll get better. You'll see.
azdiamondbacks,39up8x,Sargentk,7,Sun Jun 14 23:27:06 2015 UTC,I hope so!  I know this team can play at a much higher level
azdiamondbacks,39up8x,TropangTexter,5,Sun Jun 14 23:28:10 2015 UTC,Oh it will get better. We're poised to be active at the trade deadline and/or the off season to improve our pitching situation.
azdiamondbacks,39up8x,Sandygonads,8,Sun Jun 14 23:32:38 2015 UTC,Yep. I think this team will be in the market for a TOR arm this winter with a majority of the team not making huge dollars. Add Corbin to the mix and Chase Anderson and you have a solid 1-2-3.
azdiamondbacks,39up8x,bp9801,13,Mon Jun 15 00:57:31 2015 UTC,It's this kind of series that gives me hope for this pitching staff. Oh I cannot wait to get to Anaheim...
azdiamondbacks,39up8x,kittypoop,11,Sun Jun 14 23:09:12 2015 UTC,Sweeps sweeps sweeps! Love them sweeps!
azdiamondbacks,39up8x,bp9801,11,Sun Jun 14 23:11:01 2015 UTC,And 2 out of 3 were shut outs!
azdiamondbacks,39up8x,DoOgSauce,7,Sun Jun 14 23:35:46 2015 UTC,So great to see the pitchers pull those off!
azdiamondbacks,39urz1,Antarix,2,Sun Jun 14 23:31:01 2015 UTC,Not bad considering it's only his second start
azdiamondbacks,39urz1,ilonzo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:33:11 2015 UTC,Cool! Looks like he's steadily improving.
azdiamondbacks,39urz1,go_dbacks,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:09:01 2015 UTC,Especially considering his last start in Visalia where he didn't get out of the first inning.
azdiamondbacks,39urz1,Fox1338,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:26:11 2015 UTC,What were the last three pitches if not balls or strikes?
azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,SnakeBot,13,Sun Jun 14 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/SnakeBot, don't think I didn't see you skipping out on your bill at Zipps Friday night"

azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,ilonzo,7,Sun Jun 14 20:37:32 2015 UTC,"They might try and move Hill, Peralta, or O'Brien.   Other than that, I think they've already moved most of their salary before the season started.   Just about everyone else I can think of is either cheap or worth paying to keep around."

azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,Sargentk,3,Sun Jun 14 21:09:07 2015 UTC,"Hell of a game he pitched, man. Helps out my fantasy team nicely. Just sucks about Gomez breaking it up."
azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 14 21:11:17 2015 UTC,He looked better than Jordan Zimmermann did in his no hitter. Seriously 15 Ks. Averaged just over 3 pitches per out.
azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,andrew02020,3,Sun Jun 14 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"Looked better than most one-hitters, really. Was dealing."

azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,bp9801,2,Sun Jun 14 21:11:53 2015 UTC,I thought they were the same thing???
azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,ellius,2,Sun Jun 14 21:17:13 2015 UTC,"For some, yeah, lol. Like Vlad."
azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 14 21:21:00 2015 UTC,"Don't TOOTBLAN this one, Ender  >.<"
azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,ellius,3,Sun Jun 14 21:16:31 2015 UTC,Goldy gets pitched around so much.
azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 14 21:21:31 2015 UTC,CHICKEN WINGS!!!!!!
azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,ellius,3,Sun Jun 14 21:25:33 2015 UTC,"Misplayed that! Atta boy, Wings!!"
azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 14 21:25:34 2015 UTC,"Penny, cmon son."
azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,brandonatron,3,Sun Jun 14 21:33:03 2015 UTC,Reduce damage now Rubby
azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,brandonatron,3,Sun Jun 14 21:37:45 2015 UTC,I love Ray Knight. He works for the Nats!
azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,andrew02020,2,Sun Jun 14 21:45:43 2015 UTC,I'll take it!
azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,ellius,2,Sun Jun 14 20:33:31 2015 UTC,Nolan Ryan was a cyborg. Six Million Dollar Man? Actually a documentary about Nolan.
azdiamondbacks,39tqwp,bp9801,2,Sun Jun 14 21:22:31 2015 UTC,"Didn't look like he went, but whatever."
azdiamondbacks,39octp,ThisMachineKILLS,10,Sat Jun 13 05:25:49 2015 UTC,"Not exactly surprising. Collmenter hasn't looked good in over a month, and with Corbins return imminent, somethings gotta give.  I'd imagine that Webster gets 1, maybe 2 starts, then goes back down to Reno for Corbin to take his place.  Hale also said he thinks that they can go back down to 12 pitchers with Collmenter in the bullpen. That means that JC Ramirez will probably go back down to Reno sooner or later."
azdiamondbacks,39octp,Antarix,4,Sat Jun 13 05:30:06 2015 UTC,Wow! That was unexpected. Is this in anticipation of Corbin's return?
azdiamondbacks,39octp,go_dbacks,3,Sat Jun 13 05:30:30 2015 UTC,Apparently this guy gave up 6 runs in 5 innings in his last start in Reno... lol is there no one better to bring up? Glad to see Collmenter going back to the pen though
azdiamondbacks,39octp,uninan,5,Sat Jun 13 05:35:34 2015 UTC,"Wel, it was the Pacific Coast League. Not sure if I trust his numbers to be indicative of his stuff"
azdiamondbacks,39octp,cakelorldeath,2,Sat Jun 13 05:47:03 2015 UTC,"His ERA is 9 in Reno (5 starts), even if he has a bit of bad luck going that is pretty damn terrible."
azdiamondbacks,39octp,joecb91,3,Sat Jun 13 07:46:37 2015 UTC,HOLY FUCKING SHIT! YES! I am definitely watching this one! Definitely unexpected though
azdiamondbacks,39octp,andrew02020,2,Sat Jun 13 06:29:21 2015 UTC,Woooo!! I love Collmenter out of the bullpen.
azdiamondbacks,39octp,AzWiLdCaT1988,2,Sat Jun 13 15:56:54 2015 UTC,"Sox fan here wishing the best of luck to Webster.  If he can find a way to control his stuff, he'll be in your rotation for years to come, the stuff is that good. Unfortunately Sox fans had been saying that since we got him from LA.  He also looks miserable out there when he gets in trouble and, in turn, gets shelled.  Anyway best of luck to Webster and Zona!"
azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,go_dbacks,13,Sat Jun 13 01:46:12 2015 UTC,Goldschmidt is so damn good.
azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,andrew02020,9,Sat Jun 13 03:30:53 2015 UTC,Your announcers are not superstitious at all.
azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,andrew02020,10,Sat Jun 13 04:03:16 2015 UTC,"Nah.   Brenly gives no fucks, and Steve is mentally challenged."
azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,ellius,8,Sat Jun 13 04:05:03 2015 UTC,and he's really bad at impressions
azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,ilonzo,8,Sat Jun 13 04:07:43 2015 UTC,"He tries, at least. Give me BB and his stories all day every day."
azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,bp9801,5,Sat Jun 13 04:09:12 2015 UTC,"It's kind of refreshing, they take a pretty new-school approach to...basically everything"

azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,bp9801,7,Sat Jun 13 03:34:58 2015 UTC,Jack Links presents: Messin' with Bumgarner
azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,bp9801,3,Sat Jun 13 03:35:59 2015 UTC,Those would somehow be even more entertaining.

azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,ilonzo,5,Sat Jun 13 05:09:06 2015 UTC,I think so. We almost never shut teams out
azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,andrew02020,5,Sat Jun 13 05:09:47 2015 UTC,Chase Anderson. I think we've found a keeper for this rotation moving forward.
azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,andrew02020,5,Sat Jun 13 05:10:34 2015 UTC,my shift button doesn't work now thanks a lot commissioner manfred.

azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,Teb-Tenggeri,5,Sat Jun 13 02:28:56 2015 UTC,Dumb question: how is it possible for Ender's OBP vs. lefties to be bigger than his SLG?  EDIT: Ender! :D
azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,thatguyeverywhere,5,Sat Jun 13 02:37:38 2015 UTC,Ender bringing in the Beef!
azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,ilonzo,5,Sat Jun 13 02:37:56 2015 UTC,Why do we spend so much time talking about how well guys hit in the 4-spot vs. other spots in the lineup? Does it really matter at all?
azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,thatguyeverywhere,5,Sat Jun 13 02:51:19 2015 UTC,"Need someone to try and protect Goldy, otherwise he'd just be walked every single at-bat."
azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,bp9801,3,Sat Jun 13 02:51:44 2015 UTC,"I know, I just don't get this fixation as if players suddenly just...become better hitters when they're placed in the 4-spot."

azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,Sandygonads,6,Sat Jun 13 03:01:19 2015 UTC,Getting runners on base but can't score (story of Diamondbacks baseball and my life). Chase is doing well so far

azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,bp9801,4,Sat Jun 13 03:04:01 2015 UTC,We have a run on the bum so far.
azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,cakelorldeath,3,Sat Jun 13 03:03:07 2015 UTC,We generally have a good chance when Anderson is on the mound
azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,ilonzo,4,Sat Jun 13 03:04:53 2015 UTC,Got the leadoff hitter on. Now get him over and get him home.

azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,HolyCelestia,5,Sat Jun 13 04:00:47 2015 UTC,Im awake due to my other team being stuck in extras with the Phillies  dual screens this game
azdiamondbacks,39nqeh,HolyCelestia,5,Sat Jun 13 04:06:38 2015 UTC,I didn't want to say anything before it was done but this is the second time in 3 days your announcers have jynxed something. Goldy was up for the cycle last game wasn't he?

azdiamondbacks,39obj4,bp9801,2,Sat Jun 13 05:23:46 2015 UTC,"Like the Rays having been on the receiving end of multiple no hitters over the last several years, despite ending up near the top of the AL East. Baseball is a wacky, wacky sport, and sometimes things just go against you all at once."

He's the common denominator and how many pitchers drop in performance when they come here and improve when they leave? And what about how many wind up needing Tommy John surgery?   Edit car keys = Mike Harkey
azdiamondbacks,39dgbv,andrew02020,3,Thu Jun 11 03:18:34 2015 UTC,This shit was happening when Baylor was here too
azdiamondbacks,39dgbv,-Lysosome-,2,Thu Jun 11 03:22:05 2015 UTC,And still happening. So is it bad luck? Bad trades? Bad coaching? Bad catching?
azdiamondbacks,39dgbv,ilonzo,5,Thu Jun 11 03:26:49 2015 UTC,"Mostly bad trades IMO. I'll hold the position that KT killed this team's possibility of contending from 2013-2017/2018-ish until I die. Just look at what guys like Bauer, Eaton, Skaggs, etc have done and look at the pieces we got in return. Didi Gregorius? Shit. Mark Trumbo? Shit. Prado? Shit. Cahill? Shit.

azdiamondbacks,39dgbv,andrew02020,2,Thu Jun 11 03:37:58 2015 UTC,I just think he's raw. They didn't want to put him in too early. A big blow to his confidence would be terrible for his development. In college he had an awful line. He was scared to even step up in the pocket. Dudes a freak though. Impossible to bring down.

azdiamondbacks,39dgbv,thekeymaker,2,Thu Jun 11 02:54:02 2015 UTC,Aaron hill has fucked up majorly 3 times this game and it's the bottom of the second
azdiamondbacks,39dgbv,strategolegends,2,Thu Jun 11 02:54:04 2015 UTC,The fuck was that run
azdiamondbacks,39dgbv,strategolegends,2,Thu Jun 11 02:54:40 2015 UTC,I'll never understand how we can look so good one series and look so shit the next
azdiamondbacks,39dgbv,BadBadBrownStuff,2,Thu Jun 11 02:56:13 2015 UTC,That run was on the catcher. He either needs to make better decisions or communicate better. There's no way Hill could have known where the runner was.

azdiamondbacks,39dgbv,bp9801,2,Thu Jun 11 02:59:01 2015 UTC,That one sounded dangerous off the bat.

azdiamondbacks,39cx3a,Antarix,7,Wed Jun 10 22:38:34 2015 UTC,Man for some reason I always think Goldy is older than them all by years. Maybe its just his leader personality.
azdiamondbacks,39cx3a,StrangZor,9,Thu Jun 11 00:38:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's because of the way that they were sort of brought into the team:   Pollock: Took over after Adam Eaton got hurt, took the job over time.  CO: Came up mid-season, eventually won the job from Didi Gregorious.  Anderson: Came up because of an injury, took the job over time.   There wasn't exactly a lot of hype surrounding any of the three as they were coming up. But Mark Grace had been talking about how Goldy was legit for MONTHS before he got called up, then when he finally did come up, he was the fucking man, and has never really struggled since then. It just sort of makes you assume he's a seasoned veteran instead of a young guy that's trying to make it in the show."
azdiamondbacks,39cx3a,AzWiLdCaT1988,4,Thu Jun 11 00:47:35 2015 UTC,Mark Grace was the conductor of that hype train.

azdiamondbacks,39cx3a,cardinals1996,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:45:47 2015 UTC,His maturity and additional time spent with the team might be a factor as well.
azdiamondbacks,39cx3a,TheUrbaneSage,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:01:07 2015 UTC,I did a write up for snakepit on that draft class a while back. That was a damn good draft for the Diamondbacks. Too bad they traded all the good pitchers in that draft away.

azdiamondbacks,39bmf5,flaming_scepter,3,Thu Jun 11 03:13:11 2015 UTC,"Also just my honest opinion: fuck Bryce Harper, especially in comparison to Goldy."
azdiamondbacks,39bmf5,AreYouSneakin,9,Wed Jun 10 19:50:42 2015 UTC,I like Harper. But there is no way I'd trade Goldy for him.  Edit: took away bonus letters.

azdiamondbacks,39b74y,smell_e,3,Wed Jun 10 16:53:00 2015 UTC,Maybe that is his real attitude and he doesn't really care. That seems to fit his performance...
azdiamondbacks,39b74y,sotech,6,Wed Jun 10 20:02:26 2015 UTC,"Ha. Yeah, that's entirely possible as well. I need someone to come up with a comic showing him having his father killed by the diamondbacks when he's a kid, then vowing to destroy the team when he grows up. Well guess what- he's delivering on that promise!"
azdiamondbacks,39b74y,smell_e,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:30:49 2015 UTC,He's a relief pitcher. Relievers need to be able to put bad outings behind them.

Never shows remorse whatsoever. Just smacks his gum half hanging out of his mouth like he doesn't care. So no, I reject your statement."

azdiamondbacks,399cwz,ilonzo,9,Wed Jun 10 04:55:54 2015 UTC,Thank you guys for having me! I had fun even though the result wasn't what I wanted. Some of you might have saw my post about how my cousin is on your 40 man roster which makes y'all a prime candidate to be my favorite western team. Whenever I have time late at night I'll try to stop by!

azdiamondbacks,398fop,CHAARRGER,2,Wed Jun 10 03:44:30 2015 UTC,Well... He is getting old.
azdiamondbacks,398fop,andrew02020,2,Wed Jun 10 03:46:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I get that. Evidence just seems to be mounting up every time I watch.
azdiamondbacks,398fop,CHAARRGER,2,Wed Jun 10 03:47:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah. /r/baseball and the Nats sub circlejerk about how good he is, but I kind of think at this point in his career he needs a partner at least."
azdiamondbacks,398fop,andrew02020,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:49:33 2015 UTC,Has he always gone solo?
azdiamondbacks,398fop,CHAARRGER,2,Wed Jun 10 03:54:20 2015 UTC,I think so. But when he started I hadn't been born yet haha
azdiamondbacks,398fop,andrew02020,2,Wed Jun 10 03:55:14 2015 UTC,Haha fair enough.
azdiamondbacks,398fop,CHAARRGER,3,Wed Jun 10 03:57:31 2015 UTC,"Shit. I like Kendrick but not now. Still, Ray has been looking good other than that and your offense has looked a lot better than LA's."
azdiamondbacks,398fop,andrew02020,3,Wed Jun 10 03:47:45 2015 UTC,"Poor Ray, gives us 6 good innings and has 0 margin for error"
azdiamondbacks,398fop,go_dbacks,3,Wed Jun 10 03:52:01 2015 UTC,At least he isn't in line for an L.
azdiamondbacks,398fop,andrew02020,2,Wed Jun 10 03:53:52 2015 UTC,Wish we had a more consistent offense.
azdiamondbacks,398fop,bp9801,3,Wed Jun 10 03:59:51 2015 UTC,Frias looks tired.
azdiamondbacks,398fop,andrew02020,3,Wed Jun 10 03:57:58 2015 UTC,"Mini vacations are great and much needed, but always forget to tune into games until it's late. This one is looking lot better than yesterday, but sucks Ray gets a no decision."
azdiamondbacks,398fop,bp9801,3,Wed Jun 10 03:58:12 2015 UTC,Pitcher wins are overrated. His stats show he's been pitching well.
azdiamondbacks,398fop,andrew02020,3,Wed Jun 10 03:59:14 2015 UTC,"True, but still, pitched one hell of a game to only get one lousy run of support."
azdiamondbacks,398fop,bp9801,2,Wed Jun 10 04:03:39 2015 UTC,Lol I guess I'm used to it. Our offense can't score unless Bryce goes deep.
azdiamondbacks,398fop,andrew02020,2,Wed Jun 10 04:04:50 2015 UTC,Sounds like us with Goldy and AJ.
azdiamondbacks,398fop,bp9801,2,Wed Jun 10 04:06:05 2015 UTC,I guess your Goldy and AJ are our Harper and Espinosa
azdiamondbacks,398fop,andrew02020,2,Wed Jun 10 04:08:31 2015 UTC,"Probably right. Espinosa has looked real good this year. And Bryce, well, man possessed."
azdiamondbacks,398fop,bp9801,2,Wed Jun 10 04:09:57 2015 UTC,"Espinosa has been a real surprise. In DC we're calling it The Danny Espinosa Renaissance. And with Bryce... dat bat speed. Our main issue is that Zimmerman isn't completely healthy and isn't hitting for shit, and the rest of our offense has been streaky as hell. Also our manager's bullpen management has been questionable."
azdiamondbacks,398fop,andrew02020,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:13:23 2015 UTC,"Two guys carrying it, sounds familiar. We also have Yasmany, who they're now trying to slot in wherever possible with Lamb back.   How's Matty handling it? Leaving guys in with bad matchups or trying to get a good matchup even if the current guy is dealing?"
azdiamondbacks,398fop,bp9801,2,Wed Jun 10 04:20:28 2015 UTC,"Well we kind of have 2 guys with power and Yuni has been hitting for contact. Span has been kind of cold, but still gets hits and Rendon is basically in spring training right now. Mad Matt has been leaving his starters in too long every game. It's really frustrating. Scherzer is incredible pitch 1-100. After that he loses it pretty quickly. Williams doesn't have the heart to take him out after that 100 pitch plateau. Same with Zim and Gio. He kept starting Stras when he was obviously hurt. I guess that one was more Strasburg and our GM and our training staff's fault though. Our sub is pretty much split on Matt Williams though. Some of us think he manages his bullpen badly, and some of us excuse the long hook."
azdiamondbacks,398fop,andrew02020,3,Wed Jun 10 04:27:23 2015 UTC,God damn it Reed
azdiamondbacks,398fop,ilonzo,3,Wed Jun 10 04:14:33 2015 UTC,Good old Addarun
azdiamondbacks,398fop,GoldysMassiveArms,3,Wed Jun 10 04:14:54 2015 UTC,Reed please.  Edit: You fuckwit.
azdiamondbacks,398fop,bp9801,3,Wed Jun 10 04:15:34 2015 UTC,What's wrong with Reed. He has all the stuff to be good. Why isn't he?
azdiamondbacks,398fop,andrew02020,2,Wed Jun 10 04:16:29 2015 UTC,He's throwing meatball after meatball. I don't understand what he's thinking
azdiamondbacks,398fop,go_dbacks,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:18:10 2015 UTC,Does he ever have lock down innings or is it nail biters every time? Cause we got a player with incredible stuff and command issues like that who has 2 great outings per 3 run outing.

azdiamondbacks,398fop,ilonzo,3,Wed Jun 10 04:45:15 2015 UTC,Oh. Jw. On /r/nationals we do one every game so people can bitch about how awful our offense is. Haha

I'm going to go out on a massive limb here and say Ray doesn't see the 7th inning 😂 I reckon he gives up 1 run through 5 but has a pitch count too high to control and has to be pulled.  Snakes win 7-3. Win goes to Hudson

azdiamondbacks,398fop,andrew02020,2,Wed Jun 10 02:39:01 2015 UTC,He's got good stuff but he has trouble putting guys away. It's amazing how quickly his pitch count can rise

azdiamondbacks,3970os,WorldRecordFap,3,Wed Jun 10 00:03:29 2015 UTC,Bring him up.  Guaranteed he's better than Reed
azdiamondbacks,397ese,TheAviator4,12,Tue Jun 9 20:10:42 2015 UTC,"It's also troubling to see guys like Bolsinger and Bauer tearing it up elsewhere when they struggled in the Diamondbacks organization.  McCarthy last season is another example. It seems like there are quite a few pitchers that find success after leaving the club, but maybe I'm just imagining that. Maybe it balances out more than I'm realizing."
azdiamondbacks,397ese,Costigan,5,Tue Jun 9 21:14:45 2015 UTC,"Yep but then you have guys like Vidal Nuño who seemed to do better in our system than elsewhere. I think it's just a matter of find the right guys to fit in our system. Funny though how Nuño, who in my opinion was one that fit very well, was the first guy they got rid of."
azdiamondbacks,397ese,uninan,3,Tue Jun 9 23:13:46 2015 UTC,"Right, Chase Field is a hitters ballpark and pitchers that miss up in the zone are a lot more likely to have a hard time here. I feel like that's why we see a lot of pitchers go elsewhere and have more success."
azdiamondbacks,397ese,DoOgSauce,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:20:27 2015 UTC,I like that trumbo's gone but getting rid of nuno sucked.
azdiamondbacks,397ese,SportsMind,6,Wed Jun 10 05:23:04 2015 UTC,I believe it is a talent issue but the Archie Bradley regression into a 2 pitch pitcher is troubling.
azdiamondbacks,397ese,mrana,3,Tue Jun 9 20:37:17 2015 UTC,I feel like Archie's decline was because of his injury. Have to wait to see what happens when he comes back.
azdiamondbacks,397ese,Darkstargir,3,Wed Jun 10 01:18:41 2015 UTC,"The guys lb the pitching staff just aren't good. It was painfully obvious that they were bad before the season started.  Collmenter, De La Rosa, Hellickson, none of them miss bats and they ask give up long balls.  They have a history of that.   The problem is an organization that historically fails at developing and evaluating talent."
azdiamondbacks,397ese,brandonatron,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:07:51 2015 UTC,"This team is pretty good at developing talent actually..KT was terrible at identifying talent. The organization though does a great job.   Also, Collmenter is a good pitcher, maybe he shouldn't be starting but he earned the opportunity after how he pitched last year. De La Rosa has plenty of upside still and has pitched some great games this year, we'll see if he can adjust. Hellickson was a gamble and so far he hasn't looked good. He was always kind of overrated but we took a risk and he's a decent enough stop gap.  What I want to see is Randall Delgado and Hudson get stretched out to start and see what they can do."

azdiamondbacks,38z025,smell_e,2,Mon Jun 8 06:27:56 2015 UTC,¯_(ツ)_/¯
azdiamondbacks,38z025,Darkstargir,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:03:46 2015 UTC,Trade him to an American League team for catching depth/relief depth and a decent pitching prospect.
azdiamondbacks,38z025,joecb91,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:14:27 2015 UTC,There is already so much of a outfielder logjam that I would prefer to see him as a catcher and hope that we can get 2013-14 Gattis style production out of him if he is called up.
azdiamondbacks,38z025,Sandygonads,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:23:49 2015 UTC,3 options:  1) he's 1 injury away from a call up to become the 4th outfielder. If that injury lasts a significant amount of time then he spends the whole season with us. And with the way our outfield (minus Tomas) throw themselves around it wouldn't be surprising to see and injury reasonably soon.   2) call him up for a reliever and go back to the 5 man bench. This could work because of the versatility of our infield. We have at least 2 people that can cover each infield position. However splitting at bats between 5  outfielders would likely mean we'll see more of Tomas at 3rd and could impact Lamb's progression.   3) trade O'Brien at the deadline to a team that needs a corner outfielder with pop. A young one under team control for lots of years can return a LOT. However I'm not comfortable with the trades this front office has made. (Maybe that's still a bit of the Kevin Towers' in me.)   Personally I'd like to see O'Brien up now as the 5th outfielder. But we can't really do that whilst the rotation can't get a handle on things
azdiamondbacks,38yr6w,go_dbacks,10,Sun Jun 7 23:56:37 2015 UTC,"People seem to think we'll be going after Stephenson, due to our need for a catcher and the belief that we'll be able to sign him for less than the shortstops and pitchers.   Still hope we decide on Swanson though. He could finally be that elusive shortstop with a bat that we've been hoping for ever since it looked like Alex Cintron was the future back in '03...and when Stephen Drew was future in '08...and when Gregorious was the future in '13...actually maybe we should just draft the catcher. Shortstops are freakin' cursed in Arizona."
azdiamondbacks,38yr6w,theMumaw,3,Mon Jun 8 02:52:21 2015 UTC,"It would make no sense to draft a catcher, it takes years to develop a player so it is always a better idea to take the best player, not the one playing the position we need depth in currently."
azdiamondbacks,38yr6w,uninan,4,Mon Jun 8 03:59:09 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with you, and want us to draft Swanson despite our terrible history with shortstops. I mean how can you pass over a guy named ""Dansby Swanson""? That's a baseball name if I've ever heard one. Baseball America's mock has us taking Stephenson though, and I could us going that route if we think some players will be available down the line that we will need some extra money for."

azdiamondbacks,38vlkk,SnakeBot,5,Sun Jun 7 05:07:32 2015 UTC,Highlight of the night for me was Goldy arguing with the home plate ump. I think that was maybe the second time I ever saw him do that.
azdiamondbacks,38vlkk,cheerbacks,6,Sun Jun 7 06:41:24 2015 UTC,That's not in the game highlights? It should be in the highlights!
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,SnakeBot,12,Sun Jun 7 00:15:24 2015 UTC,I hope this ump zips his dick in his zipper when he gets done taking a leak after the game
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,GoldysMassiveArms,5,Sun Jun 7 04:46:32 2015 UTC,"and not one of those barely nick it type zips. Only a full, skin stuck in the zip, blood in his drawers, has to get help to get his dick out dick zip will be enough."

azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,TheAviator4,8,Sun Jun 7 03:51:04 2015 UTC,"I like how Chase Anderson is our best pitcher, but we have only won 2 games when he pitches, But ruby will give up 5 runs in a game and we'll win."

azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,thekeymaker,7,Sun Jun 7 04:23:08 2015 UTC,Love that Goldy was laughing at the IBB lol
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,TheAviator4,7,Sun Jun 7 04:42:12 2015 UTC,Congrats on the win. Some good defensive plays from your team. And 1 swing to change the outcome. Well played... another disappointing loss for the mets :/
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,savi0r23,2,Sun Jun 7 04:55:08 2015 UTC,I had a lot of fun watching Colon pitch today. He is really fun to watch and seeing a pitcher that actually positions himself the best way possible after his follow through to field a ball is awesome and I wish more pitchers would do it. I hope you guys have success the rest of the season. After tomorrow of course :P
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,TheAviator4,6,Sun Jun 7 05:19:35 2015 UTC,"Y'all who get that Tony LaRussa bobblehead are the luckiest people ever in the history of ever. That is all. Also, beat the Mets :)"

azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,Spartan_029,5,Sun Jun 7 02:29:19 2015 UTC,"The black jerseys have been around for a while. They look quite good with the matte black helmets, however."

azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,Sandygonads,2,Sun Jun 7 02:40:03 2015 UTC,Bartolo throws enough strikes as it is. Doesn't need help.

azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,go_dbacks,4,Sun Jun 7 04:30:59 2015 UTC,Idk how anyone can be hating on him now. He's hitting really well lately and his defense is some of the best I have ever seen.
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,TheAviator4,6,Sun Jun 7 04:38:34 2015 UTC,I'm surprised blue isn't calling those strikes.
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,ellius,6,Sun Jun 7 04:40:35 2015 UTC,How about a LamBomb?
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,-Lysosome-,4,Sun Jun 7 04:40:52 2015 UTC,Only if you call it a Lamb Chop

azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,brandonatron,4,Sun Jun 7 04:52:07 2015 UTC,That double play to end the top of the first was a thing of beauty.
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,bp9801,5,Sun Jun 7 02:28:23 2015 UTC,2 strikes weren't strikes on Tomas at-bat.
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,-Lysosome-,3,Sun Jun 7 02:39:58 2015 UTC,Why is there a Kershaw commercial on the dbacks broadcast?
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,clevelandindians63,2,Sun Jun 7 02:52:12 2015 UTC,Just one of the national Subway commercials. It's either him or Mike Trout.
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 7 02:53:53 2015 UTC,Don't think they are hitting their target audience
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,clevelandindians63,2,Sun Jun 7 02:55:19 2015 UTC,"I'm damn sure not a Dodger fan, but Kershaw is a good person and a damn good pitcher. And sub sammiches are delicious so it's all good. Now if it was Puig I would only go to Jimmy Johns."
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,GoldysMassiveArms,4,Sun Jun 7 03:00:45 2015 UTC,"Oh damn, bat right to the neck. Fucking, ow."
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,bp9801,4,Sun Jun 7 03:21:56 2015 UTC,Beef with the reflexes!   Hopefully blue is okay.
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,ellius,3,Sun Jun 7 03:22:23 2015 UTC,These hits are so dumb. Stop finding holes!
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,go_dbacks,2,Sun Jun 7 03:45:40 2015 UTC,They are making up for the fact that we can't get anything to fall in your outfield.
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,ManceRaider,5,Sun Jun 7 03:46:57 2015 UTC,The hell was that pitch?
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 7 04:02:19 2015 UTC,"When you're high, the umps just seem like disfunctional robots"
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,mind_elevated,3,Sun Jun 7 04:06:02 2015 UTC,Might as well replace them with functional ones
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,go_dbacks,4,Sun Jun 7 04:07:03 2015 UTC,Is this the part where we break through and tie this game up?
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,brandonatron,6,Sun Jun 7 04:13:38 2015 UTC,Depends on how blue feels
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,go_dbacks,3,Sun Jun 7 04:14:19 2015 UTC,Bat to the head area must have jarred something loose.
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,bp9801,5,Sun Jun 7 04:15:18 2015 UTC,I got skunked at the fishing hole. I need a win to make me feel better dbacks.

azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,Roy13,3,Sun Jun 7 04:17:15 2015 UTC,"while i am here, how's the season going? how's the division? I pay a little attention to the Rockies, but not enough to know how everyone else is doing."
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,McLovin1019,3,Sun Jun 7 04:23:45 2015 UTC,"Giants are good, Dodgers are good (bleh). Padres are underperforming. Rockies looked hopeless for a whie but they're heated up and caught up to the pack. We're holding our own for the most part, which is better than expected and a huge improvement over last year. It's still anyboy's (probably with the exception of us and the Rockies) division"
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,go_dbacks,3,Sun Jun 7 04:25:53 2015 UTC,"Dodgers swept us earlier this year, all on walkoffs I believe. Sucked.

azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,ellius,3,Sun Jun 7 02:19:47 2015 UTC,4th full count with 2 outs in the second? Yikes
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,Spartan_029,3,Sun Jun 7 02:35:25 2015 UTC,Ender could have caught that if he was playing deep. Unexpected homer.
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,-Lysosome-,3,Sun Jun 7 02:37:21 2015 UTC,"That little pup looked ready to bite the cameraman's face off, haha."
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 7 02:41:32 2015 UTC,Thats pathetic that colon didnt even swing.
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,robak69,3,Sun Jun 7 02:56:33 2015 UTC,DP!
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 7 03:06:42 2015 UTC,silky smooth double play
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,mind_elevated,3,Sun Jun 7 03:08:19 2015 UTC,That was such a horrible angle to try and tell if the ball was caught.
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,bp9801,2,Sun Jun 7 03:10:30 2015 UTC,Yeah..wasn't sure if it was caught for a while
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,go_dbacks,2,Sun Jun 7 03:11:22 2015 UTC,"Same. Had to rely on Bert and BB to know for sure, which is fine if they were radio announcers, but they're the TV announcers."
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,bp9801,3,Sun Jun 7 03:13:18 2015 UTC,Tomás can really swing it. Could be the signing of the year if that power shows up
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,go_dbacks,3,Sun Jun 7 03:14:03 2015 UTC,Phew. Luckily Tomás got his foot in there.

Despite game being late, everyone who is going to school/work can just get to Chase Field/home and catch the baseball game while having a beer/dinner.

azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,bp9801,2,Sun Jun 7 00:44:57 2015 UTC,Why is our game always so late? I've been trying to sleep early lately :(
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,HolyCelestia,5,Sun Jun 7 00:52:34 2015 UTC,I just moved to the bay area and I love always having a game to watch when I get home from work. But while I spent some time in Chicago a few years back it was definitely less than ideal.
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,AreYouSneakin,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:05:31 2015 UTC,"Start time for a game is usually around 7PM. Sometimes before, sometimes a bit after. Gives people time to get stuff done during the day, like work and school, and on weekends, a chance to have a nice evening of baseball.  There are day games, too, but outside of weekends and holidays, the games are mostly at night. Some games during the week will start early, noon or thereabouts, but typically baseball is now a night game. Anything played in the Mountain and Pacific time zones are going to be real late for folks in the Central and Eastern time zones, but just how it is. A game that starts at noon or so in the east means a 9am or 10am start the further west you go."
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,bp9801,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:11:12 2015 UTC,Yeah concur on the first paragraph. People work/go to school during the day and pop a beer (I know it's just a saying but most people I know do that) after getting back from daily errands. Games are always so late especially when you don't live in AZ or on the West Coast for that matter.
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,HolyCelestia,2,Sun Jun 7 01:14:06 2015 UTC,"Chase, please get your pitch count under control. Be nice to have someone stop throwing 20+ pitches every inning."

azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,giantjensen,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:52:11 2015 UTC,"I make predictions of the games in the Mets sub, please check them out and please don't downvote me. If you disagree, just comment!  Agothro's Predictions  All right, welcome back to my predictions.   Points favoring New York   Bartolo Colon is on the mound, and has notable pitch control. He also has 3 hits (incl. 1 xBH) , 3 RBI, and 12 times where he wasn't struck out.  Bartolo Colon is not Jon Niese. Recker has more experience than Plawecki. Ruben Tejada.  Anderson is inexperienced as a starter.   Points favoring Arizona   Better batting averages all around, including Pollock, Goldschmidt, Tomás, etc. The D-Backs play at home. The D-Backs won yesterday quite skillfully (although off of Niese, so take it with a hefty serving of salt)   Overall Prediction - Mets over Diamondbacks, 60-40.     PS, Diamondbacks fans: The Purple is better than the horrid reds that you wear these days"
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,Agothro,6,Sun Jun 7 01:43:44 2015 UTC,You realize we have some of the top offensive numbers in the NL. Don't try to negate yesterday by laying it on Niese.
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,GoldysMassiveArms,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:16:43 2015 UTC,See point #1. You guys have very good offensive players. I would say 7-2 off Niese is easier than off Bart though.

azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,purplepenned,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:13:52 2015 UTC,Can we please have a Bart grand slam? If I was Anderson I would throw the game and walk 3 batters before him and throw him a nice easy pitch just to make sure it'd happen
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,Agothro,3,Sun Jun 7 02:15:36 2015 UTC,Grand slams means he jogs. I wanna see him leg out a bunt hit
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,purplepenned,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:16:45 2015 UTC,"In the parker, defensive indifference to allow the grand slam"
azdiamondbacks,38uqwq,Agothro,4,Sun Jun 7 02:18:10 2015 UTC,PS: we know the purple is better. We don't need opposing teams fans coming into our game thread every series to tell us so. It gets boring. Fast.

azdiamondbacks,38rhof,Teb-Tenggeri,12,Sat Jun 6 04:41:39 2015 UTC,"14 bullpen losses are two more than the second worst team in that category in the NL. If the starters keep leaving the game in the 5th/6th inning, we might stay at top."
azdiamondbacks,38rhof,-Lysosome-,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:48:11 2015 UTC,Do you think the Trumbo trade was a smart way to help this?
azdiamondbacks,38rhof,-Lysosome-,9,Sat Jun 6 04:50:42 2015 UTC,"In short term, not really. But if Leone could get back to his 2014 form, he might help. Hernandez will help. Huddy and Chafin looked good lately. There is some improvement from Reed too."
azdiamondbacks,38rhof,-Lysosome-,2,Sat Jun 6 04:54:32 2015 UTC,"Do you think Leone has a better chance of getting back to his 2014 numbers if he were the leader of a bullpen, say, our bullpen?  It might force him to get his head together"
azdiamondbacks,38rhof,mind_elevated,2,Sat Jun 6 22:05:19 2015 UTC,"He is young. He's not gonna get that kind of role anytime soon. In fact, he will probably be sent down to Reno when Hernandez is activated."
azdiamondbacks,38rhof,Freyja_God,2,Sat Jun 6 23:28:00 2015 UTC,"Oh okay, I wasn't even sure if he was capable of being a leader.  That's a shame, since I'm grasping for straws  with the bullpen"
azdiamondbacks,38rhof,Antarix,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:32:33 2015 UTC,Hernandez to the rescue
azdiamondbacks,38rhof,Secc_15,2,Sun Jun 7 04:14:52 2015 UTC,The Trumbo trade is only a positive.  Tomás and Peralta have much better OBP skills.  He was holding the team back imo.
azdiamondbacks,38rhof,joecb91,3,Sat Jun 6 05:10:09 2015 UTC,"The bullpen numbers are the biggest thing. If we had even a league average pen, take away 4 losses and make them wins, we're at 30-24 and right in the thick of it for the West.  The other thing I think is the fact that the offense has been very much feast or famine in the early going of the season. In the first 36 games of the season, 12 of the games the D'backs scored 6 runs or more, while in 10 of those 36 games, they scored one or fewer runs. So of the first 36 games, 22 of them were either slugfests, or offensive struggles."
azdiamondbacks,38qykk,go_dbacks,6,Sat Jun 6 01:46:44 2015 UTC,D-Hern!!!!!! The answer at the back end of the bullpen!
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,SnakeBot,12,Sat Jun 6 00:06:06 2015 UTC,"Everyone in the mets thread is saying ""how could we lose to such and awful team"" and going crazy that we're scoring runs. We have the best offense in the league!"
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,giantjensen,8,Sat Jun 6 04:22:20 2015 UTC,"Because they have the strongest, most proven rotation (6 MAN DEEP) in the MLB duh.  Super heroes like Batman, Thor, Shrek, The QB from Remember the Titans, grace the fans with their presence on the mound. How could they EVER lose??!!!"
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,airbudgoldenrec,3,Sat Jun 6 04:25:59 2015 UTC,Which one is the QB?

azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,brandonatron,4,Sat Jun 6 04:30:44 2015 UTC,"We're still being underrated I see. Not saying the snakes are a good team now, a contending team per say, but we have a ton of nice pieces and a solid core group of players that look to be keepers. The offense is also really good and that despite an inconsistent 5-9 in the order.  Like I've said, this is a solidified rotation and bottom of the order away from a contending club, and I'm confident we'll see that fixed this winter.  They still probably are thinking of the KT snakes as the dbacks today."
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,TropangTexter,3,Sat Jun 6 04:25:21 2015 UTC,"If we had an average or above average bullpen, we'd be a really good team! We'd be a few games over .500 and in it for the rest of the season. I'm excited for Corbin to come back, and other pitchers. we have solid young players and I am actually excited about our future for once!"
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,giantjensen,3,Sat Jun 6 04:30:33 2015 UTC,And if memory serves correct from our series a pretty good defense too.  Also any offense will beat the Mets. They don't really hit well...
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,andrew02020,5,Sat Jun 6 04:25:32 2015 UTC,"Ender, AJ, Goldy, Ahmed and Lamb (when he comes back) are all great defenders. Yasmany will be solid in the outfield I feel like.  Of course, tuffy was a stopper at the back stop."

azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,Chicamungo,5,Sat Jun 6 03:28:52 2015 UTC,How much of the D-Bat dog did you manage to eat? I split it with two people and was still full when I had one
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,4,Sat Jun 6 03:33:14 2015 UTC,I got about 2/3 the way through and then had my brother and sister finish it off. It's a bit heavy on the breading other wise I could have finished it. I'm still happy with as much as I ate.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,Chicamungo,7,Sat Jun 6 03:41:01 2015 UTC,Generally I can take down the dog and a few fries but it always gets the best of me in the end. Also the mustard is freaking amazing.

azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,purplepenned,6,Sat Jun 6 04:17:41 2015 UTC,so glad we can put tomas in the outfield now to make room for aaron hill /s
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,uninan,6,Sat Jun 6 01:39:33 2015 UTC,Lamb will be back soon enough!
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,2,Sat Jun 6 01:41:18 2015 UTC,"All about that multiple use. Tomás was switched to third anyway, so outfield should be the more natural fit for him."
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,bp9801,5,Sat Jun 6 01:48:08 2015 UTC,I seriously hate listening to every other teams broadcasters
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,GoldysMassiveArms,2,Sat Jun 6 02:04:22 2015 UTC,"Almost fell asleep last night, Mets announcers were pretty bland"
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,amperx11,2,Sat Jun 6 03:06:19 2015 UTC,Unpopular opinion: I would rather listen to the opposing broadcast most of the time. I don't really like Bert and Brenly.

azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,tembies,3,Sat Jun 6 02:35:11 2015 UTC,I've noticed a lot of team subreddits are reaaally pessimistic
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,4,Sat Jun 6 02:32:59 2015 UTC,you know what... I bet you went to an actual bar with fans IRL... and those same reddit fans went into that bar saying the same depressing shit they say online but IRL... they'ed be asked to leave.

azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,GoldysMassiveArms,6,Sat Jun 6 04:30:20 2015 UTC,"Remember I mentioned yesterday that we haven't given up less than 3 runs since May 20? Well... Thanks, pitching staff."
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,-Lysosome-,6,Sat Jun 6 04:32:33 2015 UTC,WE DID IT
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,5,Sat Jun 6 04:34:23 2015 UTC,nice job! That makes me happy since the Dbacks are my 2nd team
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,Johnnyboy_34,5,Sat Jun 6 04:38:11 2015 UTC,Obligatory weather post.. it's thundering like crazy here in Scottsdale near SRF. Also WEEKEND
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,amperx11,4,Sat Jun 6 00:18:18 2015 UTC,I <3 DP's when we get them
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,3,Sat Jun 6 01:44:18 2015 UTC,I'm sure you do ;)
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,GoldysMassiveArms,6,Sat Jun 6 01:54:04 2015 UTC,....how did that get out?
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,6,Sat Jun 6 01:53:05 2015 UTC,His pitch count was looking really good after 2 innings. He threw about 50 the last two.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,-Lysosome-,5,Sat Jun 6 02:49:35 2015 UTC,Nice to see Hellickson with a decent outing tho
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,hfgutyl,5,Sat Jun 6 03:23:16 2015 UTC,"♥ our 2, 3, 4."
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,Electric_Warrior_,5,Sat Jun 6 03:29:19 2015 UTC,Yes! Go Snakes!

azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,bp9801,5,Sat Jun 6 04:07:23 2015 UTC,Double steals are also awesome
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,NASM8bit,4,Sat Jun 6 04:08:12 2015 UTC,Slam time for Hill to redeem himself.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,-Lysosome-,2,Sat Jun 6 04:10:45 2015 UTC,"Redeem yo-self, A-a-ron!"
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,ellius,4,Sat Jun 6 04:11:33 2015 UTC,East is just not good  ಠ_ಠ
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,NASM8bit,3,Sat Jun 6 04:27:22 2015 UTC,overall division
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,purplepenned,3,Sat Jun 6 04:29:21 2015 UTC,"TBH we would be the ""top heavy"" division if we had performed as expected. We still could be. But for now our division does look pretty week. I can't wait until we get back to facing our division."
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,andrew02020,5,Sat Jun 6 04:32:03 2015 UTC,NOICE!
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,GoldysMassiveArms,5,Sat Jun 6 04:30:12 2015 UTC,"Firsts placeses, precious!  Also yeaaaaa youse guys!!"
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,delatao,3,Sat Jun 6 04:31:36 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I love these themed shows"
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,4,Sat Jun 6 01:11:38 2015 UTC,"Bullpen show, hell yeah!  I nearly thought SnakeBot was back in the hooch, but guess not."
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,bp9801,5,Sat Jun 6 01:35:57 2015 UTC,A six-pitch first for JHell. Wow.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,bp9801,2,Sat Jun 6 01:45:39 2015 UTC,"That sucks, Hellickson threw a good pitch, he just somehow hit it out."
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,giantjensen,3,Sat Jun 6 01:54:29 2015 UTC,Hellickson is really not fun to watch when runner(s) on base. Especially when he gives up a hit.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,-Lysosome-,3,Sat Jun 6 02:40:26 2015 UTC,Tomás has more range than Trumbo! Hooraaaayyy
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,2,Sat Jun 6 02:43:28 2015 UTC,Loving that play right there.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,bp9801,5,Sat Jun 6 02:51:04 2015 UTC,0-2 to walk to a pitcher. You can't nibble any more than that.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,-Lysosome-,2,Sat Jun 6 02:47:19 2015 UTC,Yeah. We see every year in the Derby that the best power hitters can't always do damage on a BP fastball. He shouldn't be afraid to throw one to a pitcher.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,3,Sat Jun 6 02:56:26 2015 UTC,JHell is apparently following the Robbie Ray approach of putting guys on and then working out of danger.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,bp9801,3,Sat Jun 6 02:50:29 2015 UTC,Because how important can WHIP be?
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,2,Sat Jun 6 02:55:39 2015 UTC,Well luckily it doesn't mean a whole lot in the long scheme of things. exceptitdoes
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,bp9801,3,Sat Jun 6 03:03:42 2015 UTC,"Tomas and Pollock are really, really fun to watch. Not sure what the D-Backs' long term view is on Inciarte, or how good Guerrero is, but this looks like it could be an interesting OF in the future."
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,Starvin_Marklar,3,Sat Jun 6 02:51:45 2015 UTC,"Peralta is a lot of fun too. Good defense, sneaky left-handed pop"
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,2,Sat Jun 6 02:52:46 2015 UTC,"Only issue with Peralta for me is he can't hit lefties at all, while Ender at least hits both decently even if he doesn't get on base.  Peralta would be a decent fit at the 4 hole behind Goldschmidt if he fixed that issue a bit"
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,TropangTexter,2,Sat Jun 6 03:46:09 2015 UTC,"Ender has the makings of a good speedy contact hitter, a fit at the lead off spot, plus with good defense. Just needs to walk more though.  I feel an outfield of Tomas, Pollock and Ender could be a good one in the future, plus with Goldschmidt and Lamb there you have the core of a solid team. Oh and Ahmed's defense"
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,TropangTexter,3,Sat Jun 6 03:36:28 2015 UTC,How often do your starters make it into the 7th inning?
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,ManceRaider,4,Sat Jun 6 03:03:26 2015 UTC,Almost never. Our bullpen leads the MLB in IP IIRC
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,4,Sat Jun 6 03:04:08 2015 UTC,Is that even allowed to happen? I thought by rule the starter had to allow 4 runs and 100 pitches through 6 innings?
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,Kelmon,5,Sat Jun 6 03:05:26 2015 UTC,"It's rare, but every so often somebody decides to break the rule and get into the 7th. And if they're really rebellious, the 8th or 9th."
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,bp9801,4,Sat Jun 6 03:11:26 2015 UTC,I should have gone to this game. Maybe I'll go tomorrow.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,Kelmon,4,Sat Jun 6 03:08:07 2015 UTC,Hellickson is getting his share of K's. Silver linings
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,2,Sat Jun 6 03:18:32 2015 UTC,Silver innings.*
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,HolyCelestia,2,Sat Jun 6 03:23:08 2015 UTC,Ended up working out. Hopefully someone in the pen gets an extra day of rest as a result
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,5,Sat Jun 6 03:23:32 2015 UTC,"Remember folks, #VotePollock!"

azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,GoldysMassiveArms,4,Sat Jun 6 03:29:48 2015 UTC,"Keep on 'em, D-Backs!"
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,Mispelling,4,Sat Jun 6 03:33:54 2015 UTC,So I saw a Facebook post today saying we should trade Hill for Niese
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,3,Sat Jun 6 03:36:04 2015 UTC,Straight up?
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,bp9801,4,Sat Jun 6 03:39:51 2015 UTC,I think he wanted a prospect
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,3,Sat Jun 6 03:40:56 2015 UTC,"Niese is durable, but I dunno. Would depend on which prospect."
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,bp9801,5,Sat Jun 6 03:45:42 2015 UTC,This castillo guy looks pretty awful at the plate so far... why did we trade for him again?
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,uninan,3,Sat Jun 6 03:46:25 2015 UTC,He's an above average offensive catcher. He'll come around (so wll Leone) eventually. Just a slow start
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,3,Sat Jun 6 03:47:48 2015 UTC,Because salty and beef sound better than salty and Pacheco
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,TropangTexter,4,Sat Jun 6 03:48:43 2015 UTC,"You mean defensive? Anyway, I don't think its worth having a slightly above average defensive catcher if he's just another hole in the lineup. If we're giving up 2 solid players we should at least get a decent catcher, no?"
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,uninan,3,Sat Jun 6 03:51:01 2015 UTC,"Nope, offensive. His career OPS+ is 95 which is above average for a catcher."
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,2,Sat Jun 6 03:52:59 2015 UTC,I would argue both salty and pacheco are better hitters. Castillo's OPS+ has dropped every single year since his first year
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,uninan,4,Sat Jun 6 03:59:32 2015 UTC,Perfect opportunity for insurance runs if they can throw a clean 8th
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,TropangTexter,3,Sat Jun 6 03:51:25 2015 UTC,Hell yeah Huddy way to get duda there   EDIT: and another strike out on 3-2 let's go!
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,TropangTexter,4,Sat Jun 6 03:54:25 2015 UTC,Rain?
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,3,Sat Jun 6 03:55:00 2015 UTC,How does that even happen?
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,4,Sat Jun 6 03:55:38 2015 UTC,Make 'em pay Á!
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,bp9801,2,Sat Jun 6 04:04:00 2015 UTC,"Peralta now. Came in to replace and play left, with Ender swapping over to right."
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,andrew02020,3,Sat Jun 6 04:05:37 2015 UTC,Is it OK if I chill in here till the end of the game? I'm rooting for y'all and my cousin is in your minor league system.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,bp9801,4,Sat Jun 6 04:05:22 2015 UTC,Not a problem. Where's your cousin at?
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,andrew02020,5,Sat Jun 6 04:06:48 2015 UTC,DL of AAA. Allen Webster. I haven't met him personally he's like a 3rd cousin or something but he was in town for our last reunion and my brother said he was a cool dude.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,4,Sat Jun 6 04:07:53 2015 UTC,Oh cool! I saw him pitch in spring training
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,andrew02020,4,Sat Jun 6 04:09:17 2015 UTC,Yeah. TBH I watched a lot of Dbacks ST games because he was there.  Too bad he isn't doing too well in Reno but if he ever gets called back up y'all can expect to see me around more.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,airbudgoldenrec,3,Sat Jun 6 04:12:05 2015 UTC,It was kinda creepy when I found out and looked him up because he looks JUST us and all the guys on that side of the fam haha.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,airbudgoldenrec,4,Sat Jun 6 04:11:11 2015 UTC,Nice dude! My Grandma was telling me a few years ago that my 2nd cousin had been pitching and was pretty good.  Jake Odorizzi pitching a shutout tonight! When that second contract comes around hit me up! :P
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,airbudgoldenrec,5,Sat Jun 6 04:09:49 2015 UTC,He also left the game with tightness but still a shutout! Damn the Rays cannot score
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,andrew02020,3,Sat Jun 6 04:12:25 2015 UTC,Shit dude he's a good player. That's awesome.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,bp9801,3,Sat Jun 6 04:12:59 2015 UTC,"Oh ho, nice! Always sweet to see a family member in the big leagues or any sport league, really, regardless of how close or distant a relation they are."

azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,3,Sat Jun 6 02:03:36 2015 UTC,This homestand just hasn't gone our way. Feels like there's been a lot of tough breaks
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,Kelmon,3,Sat Jun 6 02:40:13 2015 UTC,"I mean, the team did comeback from a 6-0 deficit against the Braves."
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,2,Sat Jun 6 03:06:00 2015 UTC,You're right. Series would be more accurate
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,-Lysosome-,3,Sat Jun 6 03:20:55 2015 UTC,Nice catch.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,fightinchunk,3,Sat Jun 6 02:43:10 2015 UTC,"hmmm... this ""streets of new york"" place looks good... wonder how far they are from bay ridge, brooklyn? lol"
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,go_dbacks,3,Sat Jun 6 02:55:41 2015 UTC,"It's a local chain, but yeah, I'm sure it's nothing like its namesake"
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,bp9801,3,Sat Jun 6 02:59:37 2015 UTC,"In Las Cruces, NM, for a little while there was a place called Chicago Southwest. Offering a ""true taste of Chicago"" with authentic Nathan's hot dogs. Because nothing says Chicago like a hot dog from New York!"
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,GoldysMassiveArms,3,Sat Jun 6 03:13:33 2015 UTC,"If you're going to Cruces for Hot dogs sorry to tell you you're doing it wrong. Green Chile burger from Blakes or tortilla soup from La Guadalupana, I believe it's on Church St."
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,bp9801,2,Sat Jun 6 03:22:16 2015 UTC,"Never actually went to that place, since I'm originally from Illinois and found it a disgrace to call it Chicago Southwest and not serve a Vienna all-beef frank.  There are Blake's all over the state, love them. Plus the seasoned fries. Also can't beat the green chile cheeseburger at Sparky's in Hatch."
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,GoldysMassiveArms,2,Sat Jun 6 03:29:30 2015 UTC,You can't beat anything green chili in Hatch! A lot of my Dad's tias and tios live there so they always cook for us when we go.
azdiamondbacks,38qmjg,fightinchunk,3,Sat Jun 6 03:32:19 2015 UTC,ohh trust me... there's some shady place here too... I just had to do a double take and remind myself that the mets were 3000 miles away. Even tho... I still checked the website out anyway lol

azdiamondbacks,38n00r,Antarix,10,Fri Jun 5 07:06:52 2015 UTC,For real. He should at the least be top ten but top 6-7 should be reasonable as well.
azdiamondbacks,38n00r,smoo555,6,Fri Jun 5 10:44:45 2015 UTC,Everyone thought I was stupid when I traded Tulowitski for Pollock in my fantasy league.

azdiamondbacks,38n00r,Freyja_God,4,Fri Jun 5 16:52:01 2015 UTC,"AJ's the best. I know I've said it before, but him and Goldy were my locks for All-Star votes. Every ballot had those two on it for sure, because really, Goldy is the best first baseman in the NL (and MLB, imo), and AJ is having a career year so far. They both need to be in Cincinnati in July."
azdiamondbacks,38n00r,bp9801,3,Fri Jun 5 16:43:58 2015 UTC,Samesies
azdiamondbacks,38n00r,cakelorldeath,4,Fri Jun 5 21:39:28 2015 UTC,Wait is this really up for debate?
azdiamondbacks,38n00r,Darkstargir,7,Fri Jun 5 17:55:32 2015 UTC,"He's not in the top 15 on the ballot, so ya, I guess so.  It's more of a rallying cry. The fact that he's not up there means that we're failling him as fans."
azdiamondbacks,38n00r,bp9801,4,Fri Jun 5 18:03:53 2015 UTC,"He isn't always mentioned in the national circuit of best centerfielders in the game when he really should be. He has a career .992 fielding percentage, currently tied for 5th in outfield assists (2nd for centerfield), and tied for 4th in defensive WAR. Fourth in total WAR, too. On the offensive side, he's 6th in batting average, 4th in hits, 3rd in runs scored, and 4th in steals.  Yet in terms of All-Star votes, he's nowhere near being considered for a spot. He's behind guys having far worse years than him, like Matt Kemp, Jorge Soler, Jason Heyward, and Hunter Pence. Makes zero sense."
azdiamondbacks,38n00r,Darkstargir,3,Fri Jun 5 18:06:18 2015 UTC,"Well he is a Diamondback and he does everything low key. He never had the prospect pedigree of those guys. It makes sense he doesn't get national love, as much he should. Pollock was the first D'Backs jersey I ever bought. I love Pollock. #LetsGet11toCincinnati"
azdiamondbacks,38n00r,bp9801,4,Fri Jun 5 18:26:48 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every Diamondback does things low key. Goldy is about as humble as you can get for a superstar, with everyone else following that same kind of philosophy. Always put the team first, couldn't have done it without those guys, whole reason I'm doing well is because of the people ahead of and behind me, etc.  I know AJ was one of the top prospects in the organization, but yeah, I don't know where he ranked in terms of tops in the league. Probably outside of the top 100. Proving everybody wrong so far."
azdiamondbacks,38n00r,Darkstargir,3,Fri Jun 5 18:35:42 2015 UTC,"Missing an entire season with TJS in the minors kind of hurt his pedigree. Even though he was never that highly regarded outside of his defense. He had the potential but he isn't as sexy as your Harpers, Uptons, or even Pences of the world."
azdiamondbacks,38n00r,cheerbacks,3,Fri Jun 5 19:18:09 2015 UTC,AJ had TJS?
azdiamondbacks,38n00r,Darkstargir,3,Fri Jun 5 19:27:11 2015 UTC,I do believe that's what it was that caused him to miss a season.
azdiamondbacks,38n00r,ellius,6,Fri Jun 5 19:35:05 2015 UTC,"Looks like it was fractured growth plate ( a.k.a. ""little league elbow"").  Apparently it was considered a ""freak kind of thing"".  TIL he's had arm surgery."
azdiamondbacks,38n00r,Darkstargir,3,Fri Jun 5 20:15:16 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah, my point was though that year off hurt his prospect status. Maybe if he doesn't miss a season his he puts up more numbers that get the prospect guys a little extra hype built for him."
azdiamondbacks,38p4rx,Darkstargir,3,Fri Jun 5 17:56:25 2015 UTC,"How much, what seats?"
azdiamondbacks,38p4rx,StrangZor,0,Fri Jun 5 21:12:56 2015 UTC,My seat is section 110 row 14 seat 7 but if you want two for the same game it's subject to availability.
azdiamondbacks,38p4rx,StrangZor,2,Fri Jun 5 22:06:47 2015 UTC,How much if I were to get two?
azdiamondbacks,38jgsl,joecb91,5,Thu Jun 4 17:02:55 2015 UTC,"Finally, Robbie Ray makes his return. Figured there was something up with Archie considering how poor he's looked. Couldn't all be mental, so hopefully the rest can get him back to his old self."
azdiamondbacks,38jgsl,bp9801,6,Thu Jun 4 17:12:27 2015 UTC,I refer to him by his porn name: Bobbie Gray
azdiamondbacks,38jgsl,HeadApe,11,Thu Jun 4 21:30:50 2015 UTC,"This looks a LOT like and invented injury to let Bradley get some time to clear his head and make a strong month leading into the all star break.  That or he's really been hurting the last 2-3 starts, and that's been the source of his struggles."
azdiamondbacks,38jgsl,Antarix,4,Thu Jun 4 17:22:54 2015 UTC,"He has looked a bit off of late, laboring each start, and I couldn't say that was all mental coming back from the injury. First start, sure, but the other ones? Something else had to have been bothering him. Mechanics could have been messed up some to try and get him in a better fielding position, put more stress on the shoulder, who knows."

azdiamondbacks,38j0up,AzWiLdCaT1988,12,Thu Jun 4 15:22:44 2015 UTC,"Fashion changes over time. Personally in 2004 I don't think that grown men felt like wearing Teal & Purple everyday. Now that Nike & Adidas have made bright colored everything in-style, the Dbacks old Jerseys colors look great. My favorite Jersey we have right now is the Saturday Blacks with the Big A. Also, I'm a big fan of the Matte Helmets in any color. Even the base coaches are wearing them. EDIT NOTE: The team does not wear Matte Helmets while wearing the Throwback purple."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,mkabbott,3,Thu Jun 4 16:03:42 2015 UTC,"It is funny how so many people want the purple and teal back now, but back when they changed in 2007, everyone was definitely stoked to have ""normal colors"".   I think it's a good problem to have though, because they can experiment with different schemes now that both are popular."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,drDekaywood,9,Thu Jun 4 17:27:28 2015 UTC,"""everyone"" was not ""stoked to have normal colors"". I remember a lot of people being upset at the time"
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,uninan,2,Thu Jun 4 22:39:24 2015 UTC,"yeah not ""everyone"" but it was a pretty popular move at the time. I remember wondering why we have to look more like other teams while people I knew we're saying the new colors were sick."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,drDekaywood,13,Fri Jun 5 03:13:10 2015 UTC,"Red and white is the single most boring color combination in baseball. Teams with the same color scheme:  Red Sox, Reds, Cardinals, Braves, Phillies, Angels, Nationals, Rangers, Indians, and us. 1/3 of all major league teams have this color scheme. Our old one was unique and interesting.  I truly believe that changing the colors was an intentional slap to the face of Jerry Colangelo by the new ownership. When the Suns and Dbacks were no longer his, both new owners decided that they wanted to forge their own path and do it without the shadow of a sports giant looming over them.  The Suns didn't do it quite so radically or officially, but you don't hear people calling US Airways center ""The Purple Palace"" anymore for a reason. All the ""Planet Orange"" stuff is very intentional, including the transition away from purple as the primary jersey color."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,bunkerbuster338,4,Thu Jun 4 16:16:26 2015 UTC,"With some exceptions, MLB teams are either blue or red. I like when a team has a different color for its dominant, because it's something you don't really see. Being unique is good, and with all the retro love of late, why not go back to the original colors instead of just for a Thursday home game."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,bp9801,5,Thu Jun 4 17:26:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, blue is way overused as well. Dodgers, Padres, Cubs, Blue Jays, Mets (although they have orange, which is nice), Tigers, Royals, Twins and Yankees."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,bunkerbuster338,2,Thu Jun 4 17:29:01 2015 UTC,"Yup, exactly. Add in the Brewers and Rays as well. The Mariners, too, although the green is incorporated nicely, and the Astros with the orange. Otherwise there's the A's, the Pirates, the White Sox, the Rockies, and the Giants as neither blue or red in the primary colors."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,bp9801,5,Thu Jun 4 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"And Orioles with their orange. But yeah, I can't think of another professional league where 2/3 of the teams use 1 of 2 colors in their jerseys."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,bunkerbuster338,2,Thu Jun 4 17:49:13 2015 UTC,"Aha, knew I was forgetting somebody. Thanks! Yeah, MLB is certainly odd with the colors. The NFL, NHL, and NBA all have a nice mix of uniform colors, and I'm not exactly well versed on the football clubs to know what's what, but at least with the other North American sports, blue and red aren't crazy dominant. Some use them, yeah, but not the majority."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,bp9801,11,Thu Jun 4 17:53:15 2015 UTC,"I like both different colors, but I like the Purple ones more. The red just feels like something half the teams in baseball wears.  And adding ""sedona"" to a basic color of red doesn't make it unique."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,joecb91,3,Thu Jun 4 17:04:16 2015 UTC,"At the very least, I'd like to see the Throwback Thursday thing done more often"
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,joecb91,2,Thu Jun 4 17:32:24 2015 UTC,Maybe Fallback Fridays? I think that's kind of a thing.

azdiamondbacks,38j0up,GoldysMassiveArms,10,Thu Jun 4 22:06:31 2015 UTC,"The team could wear burlap potato sacks and I would still buy a jersey. I love this organization and support them either way, colors don't matter to me."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,Howie_85Sabre,13,Thu Jun 4 19:03:58 2015 UTC,"I like the red. I personally think they gotta incorporate the copper though. I dunno how but they gotta,  maybe replace tan? I dunno, consult U of A and ASU, they both utilize it effectively from time to time.   I love the copper.  It's part of our states history and it's unique, not just in baseball, but for all sports. I can't think of any other state where teams use consistently use copper, we should take advantage of that."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,hellasickbro,7,Thu Jun 4 16:01:53 2015 UTC,"Incorporating copper is an awesome idea. The ""Sonoran sand"" could easily be replaced by copper, and I'm sure they could find some cool ways to implement it.  I don't mind the red, either. I do miss the old pinstripe uniforms, but the red looks pretty good. The one thing that bugs me is shortening ""Diamondbacks"" to ""Dbacks"" on the uniforms. I know it makes the logo larger and more legible, but I don't like it. The ""Arizona"" uniforms are awesome, though, as well as the black ""A"" logos."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,bp9801,4,Thu Jun 4 17:10:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the shortening of the name. Yes, Diamondbacks is a long name, but shortening it to D-backs on the uniform wasn't the best decision."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,Tbrown19,6,Thu Jun 4 17:21:50 2015 UTC,"If I was able to be in charge of all unifrom decisions here is what I would do:   Home: Purple Tops with the Teal and Copper ""ARIZONA"". I was never a fan of the pin stripes (unless you are the Yankees, it doens't look good), but if they wore the Pin stripe pants I would be ok with it. Update this with more copper around ""Arizona"" and on the sleeve piping. Hat should be the Purple A, batting helmets to match but in the Matte finish.   Home Alternate Black A with an emphasis on teal and copper within the A. Hat would be a play on our current Black A hats, but with the  matching A on the hat.   Away: Black Arizona with the classic triangle piping design on the sleeve, with grey pants. That was a slick looking uniform   Alernate Away: just a basic grey Arizona that they used to wear.   *if I had it my way, the ""D"" hat and design on uniforms would disappear for ever. It is the only thing that looks more cartoonish than ""D-BACKS"" put on the front of a jersey. Plus it makes people think of ""the d"".   I have heard some in the valley complain that it looks way too 90's, but the 90s had some slick uniforms. Diamondbacks, Padres with the orange and blue, Mariners redesign early on. Let's make it unique!   TLDR: More teal, purple, copper, and black. No more D."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,HeadApe,3,Thu Jun 4 17:49:15 2015 UTC,The Orioles literally have a cartoon bird on their hat :/
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,UAChemist,5,Thu Jun 4 21:42:23 2015 UTC,I like old uniforms more but that may just be due to those colors reminding me of going to diamondback games as a kid. I do like how they sprinkle in the old colors (throwback Thursday). Maybe they should make it a different day during the week when we have more games. How many games do we have on a Thursday at home ...6? I'd say more games using the purple just to please those who like the old colors.
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,hellasickbro,3,Thu Jun 4 16:21:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that decision will be based on how many Goldy pinstripe jerseys they think they can sell. The throwback Thursday idea was a no-brainer: there are a lot of people who love the old colors since the change was so recent, so it's a way to draw in a crowd on a weekday and sell more jerseys."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,Antarix,4,Thu Jun 4 17:15:52 2015 UTC,"I wish that they had never changed in the first place, but asking the team and expecting the team to change back to full on purple and teal is just stupid. Changing it back would be dumb, and would piss me off more than changing it the first time.  As far as the current colors go, I wish that they would just get rid of the white jerseys. There are SO many teams that wear a white jersey with red as a secondary color. I'd rather see them just wear the Red with Black for home games, the Grey with Red for away games, the throw backs on home Thursdays, and the Saturday All Blacks.  Also, buying a white jersey is always a no for me. To much of a spill risk on a $100 jersey."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,bp9801,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:27:43 2015 UTC,"Red and black for home games, plus the throwbacks, and then grey and red on the road. I like that idea. There's no rule saying the home team must be in white uniforms, just that the uniforms must match."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,amperx11,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:43:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, I completely agree. Do not like the white, I feel like it doesn't fit the team. Red and black is much nicer, a little tougher."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,cubman2000,3,Thu Jun 4 21:35:06 2015 UTC,It was purley a marketing stunt to sell more clothing and merchandise. They lacked sales and the organization hired a design firm to create something that the majority of the public would buy. I can't remember the company's name but im sure a simple Google search would find it. Im lazy.   Source: attended a lecture while attending ASU from the design company that created the whole design scheme.
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,bp9801,2,Fri Jun 5 02:28:27 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of the purple and teal, and I would love to see it incorporated more into the uniforms. However, on a modern uniform, I think the teal/turquoise should be the more dominant color instead of accent, especially given how dominant it is in the southwest.  The Sedona Red is fine, because Phoenix and fire and all that, but every sports team in AZ doesn't need to use it. The Suns and the Lumberjacks don't, but the Cardinals, Coyotes, Sun Devils, and Wildcats all have red as one of the dominant colors. Let's go with purple and teal; purple and turquoise; purple and copper; purple, turquoise, and copper; or something to get that unique style going on again.  I also wish the uniforms actually said Diamondbacks instead of D-backs, but that's a different matter."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,bp9801,3,Thu Jun 4 17:20:37 2015 UTC,I'm with you on wanting the uniforms to say Diamondbacks instead of D-Backs.
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,bunkerbuster338,3,Thu Jun 4 17:45:22 2015 UTC,"It just makes more sense to have the entire name instead of a condensed version. Outside of just having an initial or logo, I can't think of another team that shortens the name on the uniform the way the Diamondbacks do."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,HeadApe,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:59:12 2015 UTC,Probably because it takes up a lot of real estate on the jersey

azdiamondbacks,38j0up,gregxcore,2,Thu Jun 4 23:27:56 2015 UTC,"hate our current colors/uniforms. When it comes to uni design, the last thing thing to do is make them boring, and ours are boring. Our old colors stood out the best in the MLB, imo."
azdiamondbacks,38j0up,amperx11,2,Fri Jun 5 00:24:09 2015 UTC,"The ""Dbacks"" on the white and red jerseys bugs me so much, as well as the team always referring itself to the Dbacks. I feel like the 'Diamondbacks' name is rarely used anymore.  The purple era was nice while it lasted, but overall the new color scheme is much better. I think just alot of people just miss it because of nostalgia and the world series win. If the Diamondbacks had won the series in the red uniforms and then switched to purple, I bet alot of fans would be wanting the red back."

azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,bp9801,13,Wed Jun 3 23:29:33 2015 UTC,"Return is Castillo, Leone, and 2 prospects. El Nuno went with Trumbo  Prospects are Jack Reinheimer and Gabby Guerrero  Castillo looks like a reclamation project catcher  Leone is a 22 y/o pitcher that looks promising. Probably the biggest piece we're getting  Guerrero was their #5 prospect. HE IS VLAD'S NEPHEW  Reinheimer looks like an average middle infield prospect  Really, really like this move!"
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,bp9801,4,Wed Jun 3 23:27:27 2015 UTC,"Dominic Leone is a standout pitcher that had a fantastic year last year, but hasn't quite continued that pace into this year. Maybe the desert will help him get back on track.  Castillo is a little surprising, considering the Ms just got him from the Cubs. Pretty decent, best years in terms of average were '12 and '13. Last year he had a lot more power, but his average dropped like a ton. Was basically the odd man out in Chicago and I guess again in Seattle. Now he'll be a third catcher in the desert."
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,existentialsandwich,3,Wed Jun 3 23:37:49 2015 UTC,"I agree Gabby is likely the most valuable asset here; he's also the most exciting. I used to love watching Vlad play in Anaheim, though it's hard to imagine he will reach Vlad's level... but man, looking at that batting stance brings back memories. The thing that really interests me about this trade is Reinheimer. With the Dbacks draft potentially coming down to two shortstops, Swanson and Rodgers, I'm curious how much a young SS prospect factors into which one they take. My money is on Rodgers after this trade, with the thought the Reinheimer can develop into infield depth and pinch runner/hitter."

azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,evanisonreddit,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:27:32 2015 UTC,"Guerrero is the best piece you're getting. He's a high upside, low floor raw OF. Young for AA and struggling. Has the bloodlines and physique to be a great player, but he's been in the system five years and made very little progress.  Leone was terrific last season, but his velocity is down this year and lost a little command. He's spent most of the season in AAA and most fans were upset when Mayckol Guaipe was sent down rather than Leone last week.  Reinheimer's ceiling is a backup MIF. Pretty average all around.  Castillo will likely slot in as your starting catcher with Tuffy gone. Honestly, I'd take him over Tuffy anyway. His defense leaves much to be desired but has a capable bat for a catcher. There were some unfounded rumors that M's pitchers weren't satisfied with him behind the plate in the two weeks he was with the team."

azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,bp9801,3,Wed Jun 3 23:38:32 2015 UTC,good way to look at that one
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,DeckersDelight,5,Thu Jun 4 00:23:14 2015 UTC,"What we lose in El Nuño is a great name, but we get back Wellington ""Beef"" Castillo."
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,DeckersDelight,8,Wed Jun 3 23:40:30 2015 UTC,"Also, I guess this settles the outfield situation and what to do when Lamb is activated off the DL. Peralta, Ender, and AJ in the outfield; with either Lamb and Tomás splitting time at third or Tomás and Peralta in left."
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,DixieRektt,12,Wed Jun 3 23:40:38 2015 UTC,Holy shit that came out of NOWHERE
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,joecb91,5,Wed Jun 3 23:26:11 2015 UTC,"Hey dbacks fans, just a curious baseball fan, who does this end up helping out in the outfield rotation? Is Peralta gonna be starting more? I liked what I've seen from him in his small sample."
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,AzWiLdCaT1988,7,Wed Jun 3 23:58:35 2015 UTC,"Peralta and Tomas. Our future 3B, Jake Lamb is almost back from an injury so Tomas needed an outfield spot"
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,joecb91,2,Thu Jun 4 00:03:01 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks, so basically Peralta is still kinda stuck in limbo."
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,ilonzo,5,Thu Jun 4 00:12:55 2015 UTC,Sorta. He's definitely the #4 guy but I would guess he'll be in the lineup more competing with Yasmany (who will also be playing 3B at times) than Trumbo.
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,Secc_15,5,Thu Jun 4 00:22:08 2015 UTC,Lamb is going to be great. I am so happy
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,okkk27,4,Thu Jun 4 00:10:32 2015 UTC,"I am so happy right now, the OF logjam is gone and now we can have Lamb/Tomas playing together in the same lineup!  Nothing against Trumbo as a person, but he was just a poor fit on this team.  And on an unrelated note, I made a comment about his OBP of .298 being disastrous on the Dbacks facebook page. Apparently some fans think OBP and Batting Average are the same thing!  Facebook really brings out the smart fans!"
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,Antarix,3,Thu Jun 4 00:43:30 2015 UTC,I was laughing at this earlier!!
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,okkk27,3,Thu Jun 4 02:31:08 2015 UTC,"I was amazed that TWO people made that mistake.  I mean, you would think OBP is something that even the newest baseball fan could understand!"
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,Antarix,4,Thu Jun 4 03:37:29 2015 UTC,AND MY NUÑO?!!  YOU CAN HAVE TRUMBO BUT YOU LEAVE ME MY NUÑO
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,ellius,10,Thu Jun 4 02:35:05 2015 UTC,"Well the Mariners sub seems to think they lost this trade badly, so there's that"
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,ThisMachineKILLS,6,Thu Jun 4 00:01:10 2015 UTC,"The only thing in my opinion that we lost on was Leone. Young, promising, great 2014. Just had a couple hiccups this season that aren't even comparable to the damage Rodney has done for us.   Edit: since I'm on mobile and it's a bitch to flair up, I'm an M's fan"
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,adventurepony,6,Thu Jun 4 00:33:09 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, Guerrero has flashes of brilliance, but hasn't been able to put it all together consistently.   Going out and getting a catcher was a must for the Diamondbacks after losing Tuffy Gosewisch. We got a very good defensive catcher, along with a possible stud in Leone, and a really high upside guy in Gurerro along with him.  I think every D'backs fan is ok with this."
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,BadBadBrownStuff,3,Thu Jun 4 00:49:38 2015 UTC,Guerrero was actually very good in spring. He's got some pop. I think why M's fans are meh on this is because of Trumbo's RISP being .190. RISP has been the bane of our season thus far
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,GoldysMassiveArms,5,Thu Jun 4 00:52:45 2015 UTC,"Spoilers: They over paid. If it had been Castillo for Trumbo 1:1, or even Castillo with Leone/Reinheimer would have been ok, but Guerrero shows flashes of greatness if he could put everything together, Leone could bounce back with a change of scenery, and Reinheimer looks like a utility infielder in the majors.  It just feels like the Mariners are giving up a lot of players that could turn out nicely."
azdiamondbacks,38fyiw,deangelo_vickers_,3,Thu Jun 4 00:17:56 2015 UTC,"For me, Guerrero is a really exciting piece.  The D'Back system has a record of pumping out quality outfielders at an impressive rate. If they can manage to get him firing on all cylinders, this is a huge win."

azdiamondbacks,38h9yg,joecb91,7,Thu Jun 4 17:18:47 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, he wasn't awful for us before his hip literally exploded while running to first base.  That being said, when you're subject of probably the worst contract in team history. It'd probably be best to just keep your mouth shut and everytime you feel a little sore about getting DFA'd, take a look at your bank statement, and remember who's still paying you...."
azdiamondbacks,38h9yg,Antarix,6,Thu Jun 4 20:04:27 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm dumb but I don't really get it
azdiamondbacks,38h9yg,ImJooba,10,Thu Jun 4 08:26:26 2015 UTC,Cody is implying Dbacks are minor league.  We have a better record than Seattle so I assume he's pretty bitter at the organization.  And dumb.

azdiamondbacks,38g9f7,keithyp24,7,Thu Jun 4 00:35:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, here's my predictions:     Tomas to OF permanently to take over for Trumbo, the only OF of which that'll for sure play every day being Pollock. Castillo to become our starting catcher, not a free agent until 2018. Saltalamacchia and Pacheco are the more interesting stories - my money is on Saltalamacchia becoming our backup due to his switch-hitting prowess, Pacheco likely to be designated and claimed by someone else. Lamb off DL very, very soon to take over 3B, this one's obvious though. Also possible we keep Pacheco as our backup IF and designate Pennington - however I think this is less likely due to Penny's better defense."
azdiamondbacks,38g9f7,groovygarrett,4,Thu Jun 4 00:44:43 2015 UTC,none of will be valid when someone puts an offer in for hill * fingers crossed *
azdiamondbacks,38g9f7,DoOgSauce,3,Thu Jun 4 05:08:52 2015 UTC,"Let's not forget Pacheco can play all over the infield, not just catcher. He has a chance to stay on as a utility guy  EDIT: nevermind I read the rest of your post"
azdiamondbacks,38g9f7,go_dbacks,2,Thu Jun 4 04:52:46 2015 UTC,That all makes the most sense
azdiamondbacks,38g9f7,joecb91,8,Thu Jun 4 17:20:41 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see O'Brien called up, but we've been complaining this whole time that as soon as Lamb gets back on the roster we've got a problem finding a spot for Tomás. Now that we've moved Trumbo, that problem has been solved. If we bring up O'Brien then we're back to the same problem as before.  Seems more likely they just put Tomás in the OF and leave O'Brien in AAA for the time being. Maybe someone gets injured and then we can bring him up later."
azdiamondbacks,38g9f7,DougieSpoons,6,Thu Jun 4 01:02:52 2015 UTC,"I honestly see O'Brien as trade bait. I would rather have one of Inciarte or Peralta playing every day to add another lefty bat in the lineup. Give me David honestly, surrounding Goldschmidt with two lefty bats that can hit doubles well (with Lamb having a better walk rate) will be ideal and might cause teams to think twice about always walking Goldschmidt.  Sign me up for a Pollock R, Lamb L, Goldschmidt R, Peralta L, Tomas R lineuo"
azdiamondbacks,38g9f7,TropangTexter,2,Thu Jun 4 06:58:39 2015 UTC,But what about Inciarte? Is he cooling off? I haven't been able to watch many games. I'd be more of a fan of Pollock/Inciarte/GODschmidt/Peralta/Toma's/Lamb
azdiamondbacks,38g9f7,Raptor231408,2,Thu Jun 4 09:53:15 2015 UTC,"Problem with that is only 3 of them can play OF and only 1 at 3rd. So between Pollock, peralta, Tomas and inciarte you only get to play 3"

azdiamondbacks,38g9f7,TropangTexter,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:56:02 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean about Ender, but him and AJ are nearly identical, except AJ has more walks (16 v8), and home runs in fewer at bats, but also more strike outs (35v25) Both have ~200 at bats. Realistically, they both only walk roundabouts 5 percent of the time, and both strike out 15 percent. I'm still in favor of them being 1-2 over lamb as the #2 guy"

See a few of their team in jokes see how they speak to eachother etc etc.  If you wanted to turn the gameday threads into brave threads, why even bother leaving the atlanta board? The threads were completely dominated by brave injokes and what not. Anything nonbrave was just buried by so many pro atlanta comments. it didnt even feel like a dbacks thread.  Anyone else feel that way?  I mean whats the point of leaving your own gameday thread when you go turn someone elses into an exact clone of your own."

It was more so that all those braves fans came in and just created atlanta braves board v2.  If your just going to regurgitate and circlejerk why leave your board in the first place?  Most of the brave posters probably were not even aware of it.
azdiamondbacks,38fv9l,edtehgar,2,Wed Jun 3 23:28:15 2015 UTC,"It was just weird cuz they weren't even talking about dbacks stuff or asking questions abt Az players or coming in to say something about the game and leave.  They were like 100% braves. Like talk about your bullpen woes and gifs that describe your team's situation in your own thread.  I'm all for other fans coming to our thread, but it was just weird cuz it almost just turned into their thread on our sub lol"

They have disabled parking but I always get to games 2 hours early and it's always already taken. Try to park close to the elevators though on the north side of the garage. There a bridge you can walk across to get into the park. Either at the bottom of the bridge or the top you can request a wheelchair escort for your mom (if needed). These guys are fast and will even come to your seats once the game is over. If she has a walker or anything and you aren't sitting in disabled seating, you have to check it in at Guest Services, there's one on the first and third level."

azdiamondbacks,38ee85,Bluegodzill,8,Wed Jun 3 22:17:38 2015 UTC,Cameron Maybin looks like Rajon Rondo and Randy Moss had a baby.  And Freddie looks like a god damn hunk who hits dingers.
azdiamondbacks,38ee85,cymmot,5,Wed Jun 3 20:24:37 2015 UTC,I was gonna say he looks like Julio Jones combined with Orlando Jones

azdiamondbacks,38ee85,burmp,3,Wed Jun 3 19:42:11 2015 UTC,Markakis now has 7 doubles in his last 14 games. Power is resurging a bit.   For anyone who doesn't know he has 0 homeruns and in his first 31 games he only had 4 doubles after neck surgery in the offseason.
azdiamondbacks,38ee85,SG8970,5,Wed Jun 3 19:55:07 2015 UTC,"I love Markakis. He's like the Paul Millsap of the Braves, just with more consistency and facial hair"

azdiamondbacks,38ee85,Mathemagics,2,Wed Jun 3 20:25:00 2015 UTC,I don't even know what to say about Freeman right now. This is crazy. What an awesome guy.
azdiamondbacks,38ee85,joelbozo,3,Wed Jun 3 20:59:20 2015 UTC,Bethancourt must be the best rappeller ever.  HE SURE IS LETTING ME DOWN
azdiamondbacks,38ee85,joelbozo,4,Wed Jun 3 22:00:36 2015 UTC,That's why you don't sub Todd for Gomes

azdiamondbacks,38ee85,kcirvam,4,Wed Jun 3 22:17:42 2015 UTC,Is there a reason we took out Avilan after only throwing 4 pitches?
azdiamondbacks,38ee85,cteez910,3,Wed Jun 3 22:20:36 2015 UTC,"Probably matchups or something, despite the fact that Avilan pitches better against righties."

azdiamondbacks,38ee85,SG8970,5,Wed Jun 3 22:21:49 2015 UTC,They could take the lead again...winning I'm not so sure about.
azdiamondbacks,38ee85,ZachYorkMorgan,4,Wed Jun 3 22:23:55 2015 UTC,Reed fixed his slider. Looking nasty.
azdiamondbacks,38ee85,-Lysosome-,3,Wed Jun 3 22:24:47 2015 UTC,Good stuff from Reed since he remembered how to throw a slider.
azdiamondbacks,38ee85,-Lysosome-,4,Wed Jun 3 22:28:27 2015 UTC,We scored 9 runs and Goldy is 0 for 3.

azdiamondbacks,38ee85,-Lysosome-,3,Wed Jun 3 21:24:57 2015 UTC,Does anyone know why Jonny hit for Todd?
azdiamondbacks,38ee85,Snowmittromney,4,Wed Jun 3 21:58:50 2015 UTC,Fredi playing match ups cause Gomes rakes left handers but we just lost some defense by taking Todd out
azdiamondbacks,38ee85,aaronaroma,3,Wed Jun 3 22:00:23 2015 UTC,I just think Fredi is over-managing. Beats me why you'd pull a guy in an RBI situation who is 2 for 2 today

azdiamondbacks,38634h,TropangTexter,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:22:44 2015 UTC,"Lamb and Tomas will see some BABIP regression because both of them are at sky high unsustainable numbers there right now, but I hope so badly that they will find room for both of them to play almost every day.  Lamb doesn't have the raw power of Tomas, but his minors career showed a guy who can get a lot of doubles and have a high walk rate (still an issue with Tomas).   There is also a big advantage in Lamb's glove, as nice as Tomas making the plays he should make early on was he has been making the ugly play a lot more frequently over the last week or so.   I see both of them being productive, but Lamb has far more value than Tomas at 3B. Then they just need to move one of the outfielders to make room for Tomas in LF. Trumbo makes the most sense there because he only has one year of control left, and with arbitration he is going to be too expensive for a low OBP slugger playing out of position in the outfield."

azdiamondbacks,3836y5,hayclaylaybaymaysay,31,Mon Jun 1 15:03:09 2015 UTC,"What kind of guy is he? Cocky? Brash? Reserved? Team first or me first?   Extremely reserved and humble. It's almost annoying - he will never take credit for anything when he's clearly the best player on the team.   Is he going to be in AZ for a long time?   Yes. He's signed to one of the most team-friendly contracts in baseball through 2019. After that I'm not sure what will happen and I don't really want to think about the possibility of him leaving   Any funny stories about him?    Before he signed the aforementioned contract Goldy hadn't broken out yet and he hadn't earned anything above league minimum. He was planning on buying a used pickup soon. When he signed the $32M contract (which must have seemed huge at the time) he bought a new pickup instead. He was drafted by the Dodgers in the 49th round out of high school. Thankfully he didn't sign.   I'm sure there's more but I can't think of any. I'll add them later if I can remember   Favorite Goldy moment in a game?   2011 NLDS grand slam, complete with pitcher glove toss"
azdiamondbacks,3836y5,go_dbacks,4,Mon Jun 1 15:44:41 2015 UTC,My boy Victor Rojas (Angels PBP guy) with the call.  Great write up!
azdiamondbacks,3836y5,Kelmon,15,Mon Jun 1 23:09:31 2015 UTC,"Well, first thing's first.   He is literally (and I really mean literally) the most humble player in baseball. Every time   he has a great game, hits a walkoff, or gets told how great his numbers are, he just shrugs it off and says something to the effect of "" Y'know I just got lucky tonight. I managed to find some pitches to hit and luckily they went out and that's really all there is to it. I just got lucky."" ""Or it's really just a small sample size I mean this guy/team is great but I just seem to be lucky against them and I the only reason I got them (7 RBIs) was because my teammates were getting on and getting into scoring position and doing a great job of running the bases"".  When asked if he would have Tim Lincecum pitch for him if he ever made a Homerun Derby appearance, he said ""absolutely not. That would be a disrespect to a great pitcher and I'd be scared of him striking me out."" When told that the person interviewing him after the game was planning on going and talking to Lincecum about Goldy's dominance over him, he asked the reporter not to because he was afraid that it would sound disrespectful.   Goldy absolutely cares about the success of the team more than his own success. He doesn't look into his numbers and he blushes whenever his highlights come up on TV. It's always about the team first for him.   A few years ago when his teammates made him ""Americas First Baseman"" shirts, he asked them not to west them in public because it seemed like bragging.  He does a ton of work with the Phoenix Children's Hospital Foundation as well.   Goldy is absolutely 100% the nicest, most humble guy In the MLB. And you can quote me on that.   And a little known fact is that when he was called up from AA Mobile, his plane was struck by lightning on the way to Phoenix."
azdiamondbacks,3836y5,cheerbacks,19,Mon Jun 1 15:54:07 2015 UTC,"And a little known fact is that when he was called up from AA Mobile, his plane was struck by lightning on the way to Phoenix.   That's like something out of a superhero movie.  ""And thus, Goldzilla was born"""
azdiamondbacks,3836y5,go_dbacks,3,Mon Jun 1 16:05:48 2015 UTC,This must catch on.
azdiamondbacks,3836y5,Howie_85Sabre,3,Tue Jun 2 00:15:07 2015 UTC,He's the Larry Fitzgerald of baseball.
azdiamondbacks,3836y5,RetroYouth,6,Tue Jun 2 01:06:36 2015 UTC,"A few years ago when his teammates made him ""Americas First Baseman"" shirts, he asked them not to west them in public because it seemed like bragging.   Personally, I can't stand any of the ""Americas ______"" nicknames in sports. Same with ones like ""Johnny Football""."
azdiamondbacks,3836y5,joecb91,15,Mon Jun 1 18:00:18 2015 UTC,I think by the time he finishes his career here he will be in the likes of Nash and Fitzgerald. He's probably one of the all-time favorite Phoenix sports players in history. The thing that makes him special is just how humble he is though. I can't think of any other player in baseball as humble and with as much skill as Goldy.

azdiamondbacks,3836y5,Brocerystore,7,Mon Jun 1 22:13:34 2015 UTC,Found the Canadian transplant!
azdiamondbacks,3836y5,PR151,2,Mon Jun 1 22:53:29 2015 UTC,Haha born and raised here. Started hanging out with people from Chicago and nj though. Made me start watching and now I enjoy it.
azdiamondbacks,3836y5,Brocerystore,12,Mon Jun 1 22:58:02 2015 UTC,"He's pretty quiet it seems. Never gets in trouble, never any drama. I've met him multiple times when I do service work at the stadium (along with lot's of Dbacks players and staff), but Goldy really sticks out. Maybe just because he's the face of the franchise and I get a little starstruck around him, but he seems like a genuinely nice person. Not that anyone else I've met in the organization isn't, they all are, but Goldy just seemed more genuine. Most I get from them is a simple ""How's it going?"" or ""Hey"" when I pass by, which is fine I'm not looking to bother them. But just waiting for the elevator with Goldy we had a cool regular conversation. Like he wasn't just short answering and half ignoring me and my coworker, he was actually talking and adding substance to the conversation. Seems little, but when he's the one of the very few pro athletes who does this, it makes him seem that much better."
azdiamondbacks,3836y5,AcidHaze,12,Mon Jun 1 15:44:44 2015 UTC,"He's come into the store I work at a couple times and he is so completely humble and unassuming. I was slightly surprised people in the store and my coworkers did not seem to recognize him. there were no double takes, or requests for autographs like I've seen with guys like Gonzo and Kurt Warner. It was kinda weird to me as a huge fan tbh. He comes off rather shy actually, He was just a quiet dude shopping, not wearing fancy designer clothes or flashy jewelry when he obviously could if he wanted. Dbacks seem to always go out and get the good guys and Goldy is the epitome of that M.O. for them."
azdiamondbacks,3836y5,drDekaywood,10,Mon Jun 1 18:58:29 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, Goldschmidt is one of the nicest guys in baseball. He always puts the team first, never complains, and doesn't seem to care much about money (despite being woefully underpaid). He and his wife had been regularly visiting Phoenix Children's Hospital under the radar for months before the media found out about it a shined a light on it, so he decided to start Goldy's Fund 4 Kids to help raise money for the hospital. Quite simply, Paul Goldschmidt is exactly the role model every parent dreams their child will try to emulate."
azdiamondbacks,3836y5,theMumaw,8,Mon Jun 1 15:58:41 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, with athletes and charity it seems like they are trying too hard to get good publicity from the media instead of doing it because they are nice and they want to do it.  With Goldy, I appreciate how he was trying to keep it under the radar. That is one of the things that really says to me that he is doing it because he truly is a nice guy who really wants to do it."
azdiamondbacks,3836y5,joecb91,6,Mon Jun 1 18:19:33 2015 UTC,My son is getting the first name Paul and my daughters middle name will be Edward and I don't care how wierd that sounds.
azdiamondbacks,3836y5,cheerbacks,3,Mon Jun 1 16:01:14 2015 UTC,I also never not see him sign autographs before games! He is always signing and these days the best players like him barely sign for kids if at all. You can tell he is a very nice guy.
azdiamondbacks,3836y5,Dhardie29,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:57:46 2015 UTC,"During the 2011-2012 seasons Goldy took online classes from the University of Phoenix, often seen studying in the clubhouse and on team flights. Graduated with a management degree."
azdiamondbacks,3836y5,adventurepony,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:33:22 2015 UTC,"He's everything you'd ever want in your future son-in-law. He reminds me of Shawn Green. He takes it seriously. If anyone broke Shawn's record for the best offensive game of all time, I'd want it to be Goldy."
azdiamondbacks,383pti,TropangTexter,5,Mon Jun 1 17:09:24 2015 UTC,"When we get lamb back, he'll be that second home run threat that we need. Lamb will replace trumbo nicely at the plate. Add a lefty compliment to get instead of 2 righties"
azdiamondbacks,383pti,swagchef1,6,Mon Jun 1 17:46:38 2015 UTC,"He gives us something in our lineup that none of our other guys do other than Goldschmidt – a guy who can hit the ball out of the ballpark. (David) Peralta does when he plays.   Then play him more?  Personally, I want to see Peralta playing more, even though he has big platoon splits Trumbo has also been far more valuable against LHP than RHP.  My ideal OF lineup would be Tomas, Pollock, and Peralta with Inciarte as the 4th OF (he has done a nice job, but as a leadoff hitter his walk rate is way too low). And now that O'Brien is just playing the OF, you have a younger and cheaper version of Trumbo ready if he needs to be called up at some point.  While Trumbo does have value, I don't think he adds much in the outfield. He should be playing 1B or DH, can't do one of those in the NL and our 1B is really damn good so that isn't an option. I'm not really fond of low OBP hitters who struggle to draw walks too. I think we have plenty of cheaper and better overall players ready to take Trumbo's spot in the lineup."
azdiamondbacks,383pti,joecb91,3,Mon Jun 1 18:28:50 2015 UTC,"I'd still like to think this is Stewart posturing. And I agree with you about the Tomas, Pollock, Peralta being the ideal lineup. You add Lamb there, that is 4 power threats that should compensate for the loss of Trumbo.  I wouldn't mind a Pollock, Lamb (assuming his high OBP from the minors is legit), Goldschmidt, Peralta, Tomas 1-5.   All guys who could have reasonable to above OBP's in front of Tomas"
azdiamondbacks,383pti,joecb91,4,Mon Jun 1 18:30:34 2015 UTC,"I'm still a little bit mixed on whether he is playing hard to get with a Trumbo trade, or if he is just overvaluing him based on DINGERZ or some other reason.  I think that having Peralta and Lamb would add a lot more balance to the lineup too because you only really have one guy who can hit for power from the left side right now, but with Lamb you have two. Even though I see them more as 20 HR guys who can hit a lot of doubles rather than the typical slugger that is still valuable."

azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,3,Sun May 31 23:46:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry, it'll be Pollock for the cycle. He's just a HR away, right?"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,kittypoop,3,Sun May 31 23:49:16 2015 UTC,Yep. Could take nearly two games to get there.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,6,Sun May 31 23:50:06 2015 UTC,"If Goldy would stop being walked, he could've bi-cycled in this game alone"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Raptor231408,5,Sun May 31 23:54:25 2015 UTC,for cunt's sake
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,thekeymaker,3,Sun May 31 23:55:25 2015 UTC,I'm running out of beer here!
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,kittypoop,5,Sun May 31 23:56:48 2015 UTC,"I just texted my dad saying ""It's never going to end"" the next pitch, a walk off home-run."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,giantjensen,6,Mon Jun 1 00:01:19 2015 UTC,GREAT Just GREAT
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,DixieRektt,5,Mon Jun 1 00:02:10 2015 UTC,God damn it  I go to the restroom for five minutes and I come back to this
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,3,Mon Jun 1 00:04:19 2015 UTC,"God damn it, don't you know bathrooms are bad luck?"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,amperx11,4,Mon Jun 1 00:04:53 2015 UTC,LAZY SUNDAY  Day off today so I'll finally get to tune in.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,3,Sun May 31 16:53:25 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I woke up earlier today than I did yesterday, lol. My lack of sleep lately is catching up with me."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,2,Sun May 31 17:11:01 2015 UTC,"I'm like that too. Actually, my whole sleeping schedule/patterns has gone to hell.  That's why I'm really enjoying this day off."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,2,Sun May 31 17:31:01 2015 UTC,"Same here, man, same here. Yeah, mine was normalized when I was waking up around 6:15am most days, but now that I'm not it's awful. Funny how easy it can go out of whack."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,4,Sun May 31 17:48:45 2015 UTC,Pennington in the 2 hole? Think we may see a few bunts from him if he has people on ahead of him.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Sandygonads,3,Sun May 31 17:26:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah this lineup is a little weird, should be interesting"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,amperx11,4,Sun May 31 17:35:20 2015 UTC,"Lol, fuckin' Titties."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ellius,4,Sun May 31 18:14:08 2015 UTC,Well this sucks
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ThisMachineKILLS,5,Sun May 31 18:16:32 2015 UTC,fuck.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,4,Sun May 31 18:16:53 2015 UTC,"damn, that's an easy way to break a finger"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,thekeymaker,3,Sun May 31 18:18:10 2015 UTC,"Damn - Probably DL I'd think. Whose up? O'Brien?    edit: wait no, Lamb's back soon. Peralta replaced by Lamb, Tomas in OF."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,groovygarrett,2,Sun May 31 18:18:59 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, I would be ok with that. Log jam solves itself.   Edit: not to take away from that fact that losing Peralta would suck big time though..."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Sargentk,4,Sun May 31 18:48:49 2015 UTC,Yas just keeps hitting.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,4,Sun May 31 18:32:24 2015 UTC,Chicken Wings with a Ribeye!
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ellius,3,Sun May 31 18:38:19 2015 UTC,"Shit, Peralta got hit on the hand? Is he okay?"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,3,Sun May 31 18:47:33 2015 UTC,"No word yet.   Didn't look super bad, so hopefully it's just precaution."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ellius,4,Sun May 31 18:48:49 2015 UTC,Un-fucking-stoppable
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,3,Sun May 31 18:56:42 2015 UTC,"Goldy really can do no wrong. Slick with the glove, hits whatever comes near him, and gets on base to get some runs."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,4,Sun May 31 19:00:29 2015 UTC,"Salty walked, which I guess is an improvement"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,4,Sun May 31 19:05:48 2015 UTC,I'll take him walking until he remembers how to hit the ball.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,4,Sun May 31 19:07:09 2015 UTC,Bases jacked for Wings.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,3,Sun May 31 19:05:51 2015 UTC,Wings don't fail me now!   Edit: Laaaaaaaaame!
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ellius,4,Sun May 31 19:06:03 2015 UTC,This gunna be one of those games where an excellent game (so far) is spoilt by learning Peralta has broken his hand or something 😢
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Sandygonads,3,Sun May 31 19:06:34 2015 UTC,i haven't checked on the Fantasy League all week  let's see how my team did  Edit: Tied for 4th Place. 5.5 back from 1st.  http://imgur.com/dBt8fzw
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,3,Sun May 31 19:09:42 2015 UTC,My team is tanking so hard
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,2,Sun May 31 19:10:25 2015 UTC,what happened last week?  Edit: wait. Isn't your team doing really well this week?
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,2,Sun May 31 19:15:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, I was on vacation. It was definitely a rough week though"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,2,Sun May 31 19:17:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm doing much better this week. I have Goldy, Harper, and Kuechel (or however you spell it) so that helps"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,5,Sun May 31 19:27:50 2015 UTC,THANK YOU BASED AJ
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,5,Sun May 31 19:21:37 2015 UTC,Goldy Can't be stopped!
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,giantjensen,3,Sun May 31 19:23:48 2015 UTC,oh my fucking god.  Goldy is just...
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,3,Sun May 31 19:24:03 2015 UTC,Holy shit the hits
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Electric_Warrior_,5,Sun May 31 19:24:47 2015 UTC,Pennington just so good at that situational baseball. Never going to wow you with numbers but does all the little things well
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Sandygonads,4,Sun May 31 19:30:40 2015 UTC,Bit of a rough inning by Anderson but not too much damage done.  Chase needs a nickname.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,3,Sun May 31 19:41:46 2015 UTC,it feels like we've already lost
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,thekeymaker,3,Sun May 31 20:33:27 2015 UTC,TRUMBS
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,4,Sun May 31 20:47:50 2015 UTC,TRUMBOMB SIGHTING IN MILWAUKEE
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,5,Sun May 31 20:47:55 2015 UTC,On to the 15th!
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,5,Sun May 31 23:15:39 2015 UTC,"That was a pretty sweet grab, but still. And another Goldy IBB."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,4,Sun May 31 23:23:26 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: The Brew Crew holds the record for the longest game in AL history, playing 25 innings against the Cubbies in 1984.   And, of course, the DBacks hold the record for most extras in a season (77? in 2013)  Anyways, both these teams have a legacy in extra innings."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,AdamsDJ,4,Sun May 31 23:24:58 2015 UTC,"In traditional Diamondbacks fashion, Nuno is pitching well and we can't score dick"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,4,Sun May 31 23:42:59 2015 UTC,nuno has been really solid.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,thekeymaker,4,Sun May 31 23:45:56 2015 UTC,RISP!
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,HolyCelestia,4,Sun May 31 23:53:22 2015 UTC,Is it good or bad that the first thing I now check with Goldy up is whether or not 1st Base is open?
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Sandygonads,3,Sun May 31 23:54:44 2015 UTC,Yes.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,3,Sun May 31 23:55:58 2015 UTC,Woo more baseball!
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,gingerperson,4,Sun May 31 23:55:11 2015 UTC,lulz the Brewers tv guys just said Trumbo should be ashamed of himself and it is his fault we're all still here.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,gingerperson,3,Sun May 31 23:57:09 2015 UTC,suck
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,adventurepony,4,Mon Jun 1 00:01:20 2015 UTC,NOOOOOOO
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,amperx11,3,Mon Jun 1 00:03:45 2015 UTC,Are Steve and Bob back tonight? I really miss those guys whenever they leave.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Sandygonads,2,Sun May 31 17:19:16 2015 UTC,"Game's back on FSA, so yup, Bert and BB are manning things again. Get to hear what they did yesterday on the day off."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,3,Sun May 31 17:22:52 2015 UTC,"Damn, Goldy almost always has those"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,3,Sun May 31 19:31:33 2015 UTC,"Damn, Cliff. Looked cool but I'm not sure about that second out  EDIT: Huh, I'll take it I guess"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Electric_Warrior_,3,Sun May 31 19:33:51 2015 UTC,Sweet play by Penny. Killed MIL's momentum in a heartbeat
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,3,Sun May 31 19:35:32 2015 UTC,Surprised that wasn't overturned.  Nice play either way
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,WorldRecordFap,3,Sun May 31 19:35:36 2015 UTC,this inning is weird
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,3,Sun May 31 19:38:00 2015 UTC,https://twitter.com/nickpiecoro/status/605095802902618113  Peralta no broken bones. Bruised finger
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Sandygonads,3,Sun May 31 19:38:39 2015 UTC,@nickpiecoro   2015-05-31 19:37 UTC  David Peralta's X-rays were negative. Just a bruised finger.     This message was created by a bot  [Contact creator][Source code]
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,TweetsInCommentsBot,3,Sun May 31 19:38:45 2015 UTC,Great news for the Raging Bull
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,2,Sun May 31 19:38:57 2015 UTC,"Can't hurt him, only make him angrier."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,3,Sun May 31 19:41:02 2015 UTC,Just a bruise for Peralta so far.   Phew!
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ellius,3,Sun May 31 19:39:17 2015 UTC,"Wonder if Pennington is in danger of being traded or DFA'd when Lamb returns. We'll still have at least 2 people that can play each infield spot so he's the obvious choice I think. Would be a shame though, always gives everything."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Sandygonads,3,Sun May 31 19:41:11 2015 UTC,Penny nooo :(
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,3,Sun May 31 19:43:05 2015 UTC,"I've believed it's going to be Hill as the first trade ever since Tomás was brought in. Still do, especially with how Hill has played more than just second base this season. Swap him for a pitcher."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,3,Sun May 31 19:45:16 2015 UTC,"Chase... They gave you the run support, you're supposed to lock it down"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Electric_Warrior_,3,Sun May 31 19:59:55 2015 UTC,God dammit Chase. We finally score you some runs and you do this  Gomez sure was proud of that huh?
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,3,Sun May 31 20:00:14 2015 UTC,We're gonna have to score more. Their bats are coming alive.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,-Lysosome-,3,Sun May 31 20:18:03 2015 UTC,we really gave this one away today
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,thekeymaker,3,Sun May 31 20:21:37 2015 UTC,"So, drinks?"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,3,Sun May 31 20:26:39 2015 UTC,I don't think I've ever seen a 4-pitch inning.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,-Lysosome-,3,Sun May 31 20:36:21 2015 UTC,8 Pitch 8th Inning
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,3,Sun May 31 20:59:58 2015 UTC,"Nicely done, Huddy!"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,-Lysosome-,3,Sun May 31 21:30:23 2015 UTC,HUDDY FOR MVP
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,3,Sun May 31 21:31:02 2015 UTC,Love me some free baseball
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Sandygonads,3,Sun May 31 21:33:06 2015 UTC,"Let's get a run against this ""suspended"" pitcher."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,-Lysosome-,3,Sun May 31 21:33:51 2015 UTC,I heard it's hot today.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,HolyCelestia,3,Sun May 31 21:38:59 2015 UTC,Chafin looks different every time he makes an appearance
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,3,Sun May 31 21:49:48 2015 UTC,No consistency in strike calls here
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,jjohnson8,3,Sun May 31 22:15:02 2015 UTC,don't walk the guy batting .208... please
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,thekeymaker,3,Sun May 31 22:30:58 2015 UTC,It would be nice if Nuno gets his first win right here.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,-Lysosome-,3,Sun May 31 22:39:32 2015 UTC,Let's Do This
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,3,Sun May 31 22:42:58 2015 UTC,look at that fucking clapping bro
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,3,Sun May 31 22:46:30 2015 UTC,That clapper guy really got to me.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,kittypoop,3,Sun May 31 22:51:28 2015 UTC,#WeWantNuno
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,3,Sun May 31 22:51:41 2015 UTC,That's an exciting inning (top and bottom)
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,HolyCelestia,3,Sun May 31 22:55:22 2015 UTC,just got back from playing 18 an holy hell we're in the 14th.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,adventurepony,3,Sun May 31 23:00:31 2015 UTC,"How'd you shoot? I was thinking of going solo this morning, but I couldn't get out of bed."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,DoOgSauce,5,Sun May 31 23:03:02 2015 UTC,like shit but im loving this new fat grip on my putter.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,adventurepony,3,Sun May 31 23:04:49 2015 UTC,think it was the fourth inning when we teed off to.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,adventurepony,3,Sun May 31 23:02:24 2015 UTC,I feel like I should really pick up golf in my life. My roommate and pretty much all his friends all play golf.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,HolyCelestia,3,Sun May 31 23:06:23 2015 UTC,"I got some chores to finish, let's wrap this up dbcacks."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,DoOgSauce,3,Sun May 31 23:02:33 2015 UTC,Nuno has a pretty sick curveball.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,HolyCelestia,3,Sun May 31 23:04:50 2015 UTC,how was that a balk?
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,adventurepony,3,Sun May 31 23:12:42 2015 UTC,"Meh, It worked out for the best."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,kittypoop,3,Sun May 31 23:17:35 2015 UTC,I usually don't laugh at people but that fall was pretty funny.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,HolyCelestia,3,Sun May 31 23:19:44 2015 UTC,Alright Ahmed! That's a good way to start this inning
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,kittypoop,3,Sun May 31 23:19:46 2015 UTC,They can't stop Goldy! They could only hope to contain him!
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,DixieRektt,3,Sun May 31 23:27:18 2015 UTC,I can't do my homework when the game is still going on.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,HolyCelestia,3,Sun May 31 23:33:06 2015 UTC,"You guys know what they say, 16th time's the charm"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,4,Sun May 31 23:33:11 2015 UTC,I already talked to 17 women in my life and none of them is interested in me.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,HolyCelestia,3,Sun May 31 23:33:48 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile, Devils lead 2-0 T3"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,HolyCelestia,3,Sun May 31 23:44:55 2015 UTC,I thought I'd be able to watch both of these games. :/
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,3,Sun May 31 23:47:43 2015 UTC,pls penny
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,thekeymaker,3,Sun May 31 23:53:06 2015 UTC,"Huh, and i half expected the Brewers to go IBB mad and walk Pennington to get to Goldy"
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Sandygonads,3,Sun May 31 23:53:51 2015 UTC,OMG
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,DixieRektt,3,Sun May 31 23:55:11 2015 UTC,wow. this game is silly
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,adventurepony,3,Sun May 31 23:55:20 2015 UTC,What do we do when Nuno eventually runs out of steam? he's not evens stretched out for this workload... Can't imagine Bradley coming into pitch
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Sandygonads,3,Sun May 31 23:56:19 2015 UTC,We still have Perez and Delgado in the BP.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,kittypoop,6,Sun May 31 23:57:35 2015 UTC,We have a single guy in the BP.. Blazek.. Brewers telecast just showed him sitting there.. all alone.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,gingerperson,4,Sun May 31 23:59:11 2015 UTC,Bloody jesus i forgot about Randall.  Perez can fuck off atm
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Sandygonads,3,Sun May 31 23:58:29 2015 UTC,I'm not confident in either of those guys atm
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Raptor231408,3,Mon Jun 1 00:00:04 2015 UTC,Haha Steve and Bob taking the mick out of the Cubs fan was funny =]
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Sandygonads,3,Mon Jun 1 00:00:10 2015 UTC,Awwwww fuck.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,2,Mon Jun 1 00:00:44 2015 UTC,Can't wait for Cox to figure out how to run themselves so I can buy mlb.tv and watch games againnn aghhh
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,amperx11,2,Sun May 31 17:28:17 2015 UTC,Goldy is a monster. Wow.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,-Lysosome-,2,Sun May 31 18:14:16 2015 UTC,He's just unreal man. Unbelievable.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,Sargentk,2,Sun May 31 18:14:35 2015 UTC,goldy is god
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,thekeymaker,2,Sun May 31 18:14:37 2015 UTC,MVP
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ilonzo,2,Sun May 31 18:14:43 2015 UTC,"Peralta, that is not how you bunt, dammit."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,2,Sun May 31 18:15:53 2015 UTC,"Dammit, David.   I hope you're okay."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ellius,2,Sun May 31 18:16:46 2015 UTC,Hope it didn't break anything.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,2,Sun May 31 18:17:17 2015 UTC,Anyone happen to catch the speed of the pitch that Peralta took to the hand?
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ellius,2,Sun May 31 18:22:34 2015 UTC,90MPH.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,2,Sun May 31 18:27:55 2015 UTC,Thanks.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ellius,2,Sun May 31 18:30:59 2015 UTC,You're welcome.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,2,Sun May 31 18:31:41 2015 UTC,"I'm tired because of the ASU game last night/this morning (game went on for a little more than 5 hours), what a bad way to go out too :/  Let's sweep the series guys."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,HolyCelestia,2,Sun May 31 18:22:41 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to really like Yas. Way better hitter than I thought he could be, even considering his huge BABIP skew.   He just needs to go on a big HR tear at some point. Dude has some massive power, but we haven't seen too much of it yet."
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ellius,2,Sun May 31 18:34:32 2015 UTC,AJ. Nice.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,ellius,2,Sun May 31 18:42:19 2015 UTC,Well there goes the shutout.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,2,Sun May 31 19:13:50 2015 UTC,Golden Wings.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,2,Sun May 31 19:16:53 2015 UTC,Pollock is SO FAST
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,go_dbacks,2,Sun May 31 19:21:16 2015 UTC,Man AJ can fly out there.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,2,Sun May 31 19:22:55 2015 UTC,Tacos!
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,2,Sun May 31 19:23:17 2015 UTC,I hope Goldy brings this hitting back to the desert.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,2,Sun May 31 19:23:50 2015 UTC,Dammit Goldy.
azdiamondbacks,37yy7v,bp9801,2,Sun May 31 19:28:16 2015 UTC,"Tough hop there, damn."

azdiamondbacks,37vatm,bp9801,3,Sat May 30 19:45:45 2015 UTC,He really needed the DL stint. Just really didn't look right earlier in the season

azdiamondbacks,37rxn7,bp9801,4,Sat May 30 01:42:53 2015 UTC,Totally. Given us some great memories.
azdiamondbacks,37rxn7,brandonatron,3,Sat May 30 01:44:51 2015 UTC,So many sweet defensive plays. Plus that cannon.
azdiamondbacks,37rxn7,bp9801,3,Sat May 30 01:45:19 2015 UTC,And that mutombo. Miss that.

He is awful defensively, so if he can't hit either (in one of the most hitter friendly areas you can find in baseball) I would have rather just gone with Lalli or O'Brien"

I think calling up Lalli would have been the better call, just because he's ok with the bat, and solid defensively.

I did it a couple of times playing soccer, and it can be gone the next day, or stick around and nag you for weeks. I imagine as a catcher, any knee issue is gonna be taken seriously."
azdiamondbacks,37o1qf,groovygarrett,2,Fri May 29 01:51:17 2015 UTC,That's what I'm kind worried about... A nagging injury that will bother Tuffy even if he gets back soon. I don't know jammed knee was a thing till Tuffy got one.
azdiamondbacks,37o1qf,Sandygonads,2,Fri May 29 01:58:10 2015 UTC,"He's not on the 40-man yet which makes me think someone's getting DFA'd, and I'd think Pacheco's the one, unless we have someone we're gonna outright."
azdiamondbacks,37o1qf,groovygarrett,2,Fri May 29 03:50:32 2015 UTC,No way Pacheco gets DFA'd. a) you need 2 catchers on a major league roster. b) teams love that he can play any spot on the field except Pitcher and Center fielder.   He might get DFA'd when Oscar Hernandez is back fit and healthy.

azdiamondbacks,37j5gy,thejazzmarauder,4,Thu May 28 00:31:53 2015 UTC,"In O'Brien's defense, apparently, his defense has made huge strides since he was traded to Arizona. You can say what you want about the yips, but he's been back at catcher for a few weeks now, and I've heard nothing but good things coming out of Reno."
azdiamondbacks,37j5gy,Antarix,2,Thu May 28 08:46:42 2015 UTC,"We got him in the Prado trade with the Yankees last year. Bad defensively behind the plate but tears the cover off the ball. It's going to be tough for him to fit in down the road if he doesnt step it up defensively.   As it is now, we have too many out fielders on the roster to squeeze him in with Trumbo, Pollock, Peralta, Inciarte, and maybe even Tomas when Lamb is finally healthy. Either the Dbacks have to make room for him in the next year or so, or he has to go because he wont make it in the league as a catcher."
azdiamondbacks,37j5gy,deangelo_vickers_,1 point,Thu May 28 01:04:43 2015 UTC,He might just be our new starting catcher if Tuffy hits the DL after jamming his knee. =\
azdiamondbacks,37j5gy,ellius,1 point,Thu May 28 02:27:10 2015 UTC,His defense so bad that he isn't even a threat to Tuffy really.
azdiamondbacks,37j5gy,Darkstargir,3,Thu May 28 00:35:37 2015 UTC,"I got to see him a couple times in AZFL, and I really don't think his defense is that bad. I'd put him somewhere between Pacheco and Rosario, and he's shown the ability to improve.   Yeah he had the yips for a bit, but that's not uncommon and can be overcome.   I think his offense can more than make up for what he's lacking defensively right now."
azdiamondbacks,37j5gy,ellius,1 point,Thu May 28 04:44:37 2015 UTC,Between Pacheco and Rosario? So you're telling me he should never be behind the plate other than in an emergency?  For his offense to offset his defense he'd basically have to Mike Piazza..and that's just not happening.
azdiamondbacks,37j5gy,Darkstargir,2,Thu May 28 04:47:36 2015 UTC,"Between Pacheco and Rosario?   Yeah, closer to Pacheco. O'brien seemed to call much better games, though.  The Rosario comparison was for a particular game where he let a pair of pitches past him that he probably should have made a better stab at.  But really, he isn't nearly as bad as many think. He's improved a lot over the last year."
azdiamondbacks,37j5gy,ellius,1 point,Thu May 28 04:53:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, closer to Pacheco. O'brien seemed to call much better games, though.   And Pacheco is by far one of the worst defensive catchers I've seen. Rosario might actually be the worst I've ever seen. You're not helping your case at all.  The reality is O'Brian is not a catcher. It's that simple. Unless he goes on to have a HoF offensive career while playing behind the plate there is no way he's a catcher or gets as long of a leash as Rosario. His offense isn't even likely to be that good. He has contact issues and MLB pitchers will exploit that once the book is written on him. He looks more like a two true outcome hitter. Strike out or big fly.  Especially in this day and age where catcher defense is incredibly valued. The best catchers in the league are the ones who provide defense and pitch framing. Molina, LuCroy, Salvador Perez, and Posey to a lesser extent than the other guys. The days of poor defensive catchers are disappearing."
azdiamondbacks,37j5gy,Darkstargir,1 point,Thu May 28 16:21:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not advocating that the guy be our catcher-of-the-future here.   I see you have a hate-boner for the guy,  but he's the only real option to catch if Tuffy hits the DL.   He is Pacheco-quality defense (for now) with a much better bat. AKA: He's a better option to start than Pacheco (if they need someone while Tuffy gets healthy).  If Hernandez were healthy, I start him. He's not, so O'Brien is your other option. I certainly don't want to see Lalli called up."
azdiamondbacks,37j5gy,ellius,1 point,Thu May 28 17:35:12 2015 UTC,Couldn't even throw back to the pitcher
azdiamondbacks,37hvvd,Soon2barmn,6,Wed May 27 19:26:05 2015 UTC,"First things first, I'll say that I don't think Arroyo is coming back as a starter. He's been having trouble recovering from the TJ, he's 38, etc. I think this time next year he's holding down a special assistant or pitching coach job. Hopefully here, because he's got a lot he can teach young guys.    As for Corbin's return:  A 6-man rotation could be a possibility if it was managed carefully. It would help with the innings-limits on a few guys. There might just be enough long relief in the system to make it work if they wanted to go that direction.   If someone is replaced, my first choice is Hellickson. He was an experiment that hasn't panned out. You don't win all your gambles. For me, it's almost a test for the new management. Can they accept that they made a mistake and cut the losses? I would lose my shit in excitement if they can prove they have the mindset to put the best team on the field, even if it makes them look silly for getting the guy in the first place.   Realistically, though, I think Bradley is the first to be sent down. Which is a shame, because he's been very impressive so far. He's shown a huge amount of mental and physical toughness, and proven that when he's going he's ace material. I just don't think he's quite there yet. He could definitely still benefit from some seasoning in the minors, as long as a demotion wouldn't affect him too much mentally.   Then you start thinking about guys like Aaron Blair. Does he deserve a shot?  At what point do you consider moving Collmenter back to the 'pen? IMO there are only two locks for the rotation atm, and he isn't necessarily one of them.   But that's a whole other conversation.   Tl;dr: Incoherent rambling."
azdiamondbacks,37hvvd,ellius,3,Wed May 27 20:39:36 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind Archie to get some Minors stint, maybe get two starts there to ease him back a bit.   Anderson is a definite stay in the rotation, so is Rubby with what he has shown over his starts.   Collmenter has struggled quite a bit, so I could see him being sent to the bullpen to help that unit, even with how he was sold as the ace heading into Opening Day.   Hellickson was always the guy to get dumped from the rotation but he has strung together a string of pretty decent starts so I do not know.   Honestly, Collmenter might be a guy to get dumped out of the rotation. Having said this, watch him pull a dominant start ala the one in SF out of his ass tonight."
azdiamondbacks,37hvvd,TropangTexter,3,Wed May 27 20:13:00 2015 UTC,I don't think the minors would do Archie any good. Better for him to stay up and work through this stuff at the top level.
azdiamondbacks,37hvvd,HometownJuke,2,Wed May 27 20:37:33 2015 UTC,Personally I think that as long as Collmenter doesn't get blown up every other game from now on he will stick around as one of the starters solely because I think they will give him some extra rope after last season.
azdiamondbacks,37hvvd,joecb91,2,Wed May 27 20:21:34 2015 UTC,"Collmenter may be a great closer. When he was in the bullpen last year, he was great. Batters take a few at bats to get a good eye on his windmill release. He's always been a team first guy, never a me guy."
azdiamondbacks,37hvvd,joecb91,1 point,Wed May 27 20:39:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure of that anymore, his velocity is way down this year (remember he was at 88-89 when he came up and is at around 83-85 most of the time now) and that is really hurting his margin for error with his location."

azdiamondbacks,37f05d,illinus,5,Wed May 27 03:34:41 2015 UTC,"Sounds like selling high on Anderson and a buying low on Grilli. Then again, I didn't realize until now Anderson numbers are decent, even last year as well. He's just never been a flashy starter. I don't see him keeping it up, but who knows. Sorry for not having much info."
azdiamondbacks,37f05d,kittypoop,2,Wed May 27 05:01:51 2015 UTC,Anderson will regress though his FIP suggests his regression might not be as steep as you would expect. I expect Anderson to be a 3.40-3.45 ERA type guy moving forward. Solid # 3 starter numbers for a real life rotation.
azdiamondbacks,37f05d,TropangTexter,2,Wed May 27 05:42:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies. I don't think he'll keep his current line either. And the draft pick swap does sweeten the pot. But his K numbers are just meh. Also my team is doing very well to this point so I'm not in desperation mode. Overall, I think it would be a net positive."

azdiamondbacks,375wia,basmith7,4,Mon May 25 03:45:07 2015 UTC,"Added one that compares Dbacks to league averages.   This can be misleading, because it is a comparison of averages. For example, if the Dbacks only allowed 1 run per game, and the league average was 10 runs per game, and the dbacks only allowed that run in the first inning, the first inning would bee 100% dbacks and ~13% for league average, even though the dbacks probably allowed fewer first inning runs.

azdiamondbacks,375wia,iceburn_firon,2,Mon May 25 03:49:56 2015 UTC,Wouldn't these numbers be expected?  I mean the 1st inning is at least the top of the lineup. The 2nd inning is the middle. The 3rd and sometimes the 4th inning would be the bottom. The extra innings is pretty meaningless unless you divide all these numbers by how many of them there are.

azdiamondbacks,3799rh,ASULurker,6,Mon May 25 22:33:21 2015 UTC,"I don't feel the same way at all. I'm more excited about the team than I have been in quite a while.   They aren't buying big names right now for multiple reasons:  Despite having a big market at first glance, they aren't actually a big market team. There are a ton of transplants in Phoenix who follow their old teams or the teams of their parents. It's also one of the lowest income fanbases in the country, I believe.  They just recently finished paying off the payroll from 2001. Buying the 2001 World Series win hurt the team for 15 years, and it pissed off the ownership group and some fans. It got Jerry Colangelo removed from his position as managing owner.  Kevin Towers also sold off a big chunk of the team's prospects in recent years. Essentially we had a rebuild with no payoff, so they're stuck rebuilding again.   That said, somehow they're not too far off from being competitive. They've got a lot of young talent that is just now ready, or will be in the next year or two. And if TLR has his way, he'll build the club like St. Louis and make that a recurring theme -- building an exceptional farm system that can put out a playoff-caliber team year after year."
azdiamondbacks,3799rh,ellius,9,Mon May 25 23:31:19 2015 UTC,"It's actually slightly offensive how much you don't know about this franchise having lived in the valley for over a decade. The dbacks have been voted twice now (I think?) the best franchise in sports to work for, and you can bet your ass that the front office and management care just as much about their fans. There is a very strategic plan set in place for this team that will be coming to fruition within the next year or two. I can assure you us fans feel very cared about."
azdiamondbacks,3799rh,Sargentk,6,Mon May 25 23:08:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I love being a fan of this team and I don't feel unappreciated at all. I don't get why this guy is trying to get someone to sell the team for him. If you don't care, you don't care. I feel like going to  Chase and watching games is enough to make someone a fan of this franchise."
azdiamondbacks,3799rh,amperx11,-4,Mon May 25 23:55:25 2015 UTC,It's offensive? Very welcoming community you have here. Part of why I'm asking is that my friends who are dbacks fans always seem to give up on the season before June comes around. I was trying to get a better perspective from some more die hard fans if they really see the direction the team is headed and are on board. Thanks for confirming I don't need to try to be a dbacks fan.
azdiamondbacks,3799rh,mbarnar,2,Tue May 26 01:06:31 2015 UTC,"Don't jump off too soon. I just think you and this op have a miscommunication.  I think it's really hard for him to see where you're coming from. You said you are a red Sox fan and their fan base is much different.  I get what you were asking in the original post, but I can also see where someone could take offense.    Obviously the red Sox are always making moves and like to sign big name players. Dbacks are in a different situation em where they are trying to build a foundation for sustained success, because as a still young franchise they don't have a prolonged state of success. Neither way is right or wrong, just different.  That being said I think the way your question was worded could be taken offensively to some guys.  Once again not saying whose right or wrong just trying to give some context.  I'm a dbacks fan who lives in cubbie land so I definitely see that fan bases have different attitudes on different topics."
azdiamondbacks,3799rh,edtehgar,1 point,Tue May 26 02:37:29 2015 UTC,You just responded to the op
azdiamondbacks,3799rh,ellius,0,Tue May 26 03:22:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response and not just down voting. As you said it's different fan bases with different histories. That's why I'm trying to figure out how fans of the dbacks feel. One area I found extremely frustrating was that their rebuilding plan was to get ""gritty"" players and ignore analytics that teams in other sports have been using. I understand phoenix is a difficult market to establish a fan base as many fans are transient and have their own teams when they arrive. How do you feel about the direction the team is headed and where would you prefer, if you have a different vision?"
azdiamondbacks,3799rh,jlopez24,3,Tue May 26 02:53:01 2015 UTC,"One area I found extremely frustrating was that their rebuilding plan was to get ""gritty"" players and ignore analytics that teams in other sports have been using.   I can see why you think that, because it's the narrative that everyone on /r/baseball seems to have, but it just isn't true. That thinking went out the door with Kevin Towers.   Where it recently came up was in some comments that Dave Stewart made about acquiring James Shields, saying that he thinks he'd prefer a more old school attitude team. Some on /r/baseball, for some reason, took it to mean that they wouldn't be using advanced statistics.  In reality, TLR hired on a man named Ed Lewis to manage an analytics department. Dr. Lewis and his team have been advising management on sabermetrics/advanced analytics since he was hired on. In addition to using what's alreayd out there, they've been working on making their own algorithms for both finding players and figuring out the best way to use them."
azdiamondbacks,3799rh,edtehgar,1 point,Tue May 26 03:43:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the update on what they're currently doing. With my current work schedule I don't catch as much of the local sports talk as I used to but what I was referencing is regards to something u/kittypoop said about basically a second rebuild. From what I gathered during the first attempt it was a lot of the search for ""ball players"" and guys with lots of heart. I'm glad that they've made a shift from this but am slightly surprised it took so long especially after the Eric Byrnes contract."
azdiamondbacks,3799rh,edtehgar,4,Tue May 26 04:08:19 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, most fans don't want to have to try to get someone to be a fan of their team. We shouldn't have to convince anyone of watching us, you only should if you're a fan. From your post you worded everything in a weird way, making it seem like you were some bigshot that we had to convince to join our side.   Also, you don't know much about us at all if you think the Dbacks organization doesn't like their fans. With constant promotions and events like ""fan fest"" I don't know how you feel the way you do."

I don't feel that Gonzalez was an oversign at all. The only reason we traded him was so the Dodgers would take on Beckett and Crawford's contracts."

azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,8,Sun May 24 02:41:52 2015 UTC,THAT WAS AN MLB THE SHOW PLAY TUFFY!
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,7,Sun May 24 02:42:45 2015 UTC,In mlb the show I'd accidentally push R1 and jump 5 feet in the air and look like an ass.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,mind_elevated,3,Sun May 24 02:44:18 2015 UTC,"In my games, the only ones that look like an ass are the idiots who bunt and pop it straight in the air. Seems like there are two or so in nearly every game."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,7,Sun May 24 02:45:44 2015 UTC,"You folks have ruined my fiance.  Every time Goldy comes up to bat now he starts yelling ""dump em out goldy, dump out them big ol' titties"""
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,mind_elevated,5,Sun May 24 03:01:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but that's hilarious, lol."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,6,Sun May 24 03:03:25 2015 UTC,"Just a loud, long foul. Phew."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,6,Sun May 24 03:08:02 2015 UTC,Why are we sending guys against miggy? We of all teams should know he has a cannon
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,3,Sun May 24 03:25:06 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to figure that out all night and I can only come up with busted hit and runs, like BB or Bert said. Miggy only threw out what, half of all runners?"
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HoopAndHarm,7,Sun May 24 03:37:56 2015 UTC,"Tuffy ""baby ruth"" gosewich"
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,5,Sun May 24 04:14:42 2015 UTC,Á!!!!!
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,6,Sun May 24 02:32:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry Miggy, you swung."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,GoldysMassiveArms,6,Sun May 24 02:40:10 2015 UTC,Loving the K's RUBBY!!!
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,6,Sun May 24 03:12:11 2015 UTC,LOL NEVERMIND!!!! Miggy doing what he did best for us the last couple years.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,thekeymaker,6,Sun May 24 03:17:15 2015 UTC,Yummy... Double Play
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,xASUdude,5,Sun May 24 03:18:02 2015 UTC,MOTHERFUCKING FUCK FUCK!
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,Freyja_God,6,Sun May 24 03:42:56 2015 UTC,If Tuffy and Ahmed were to go back to back they should just give us the world series. Pretty sure that's a rule
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 04:18:00 2015 UTC,I think everyone's head would explode if they did. I nearly lost it seeing Ahmed hit it that far.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,qridproqro,7,Sun May 24 04:19:02 2015 UTC,perez what the dick are you doing?
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,7,Sun May 24 04:44:02 2015 UTC,Is this an actual game or one of those infomercials that appear to be real news or something?
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,4,Sun May 24 05:07:14 2015 UTC,I'm not entirely sure but I could use a 3D printed Pretzel Bun.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,3,Sun May 24 05:11:28 2015 UTC,They do this like 4-5 times a year.  It's annoying..  It probably generates a lot of sales but I'd rather not be sold something for 3 hours...
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,5,Sun May 24 05:11:18 2015 UTC,Guess SnakeBot has been hitting the tequila a little too hard.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HoopAndHarm,3,Sun May 24 02:05:13 2015 UTC,"Royalsbot aka Kevin has been on a bender for days now. he showed back up yesterday for 7 out of 9, but then he disappeared and no one can find him. We're starting to get worried."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HoopAndHarm,5,Sun May 24 02:14:25 2015 UTC,Our SnakeBot got married last year and hit up Mill Ave bars for a while.  It kinda lead my current Modship
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,amperx11,3,Sun May 24 02:16:28 2015 UTC,All the bots are just off somewhere getting smashed.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,5,Sun May 24 02:18:00 2015 UTC,Goldy running all over to get that.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,4,Sun May 24 02:16:01 2015 UTC,...the fuck Tuffy?
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,4,Sun May 24 02:18:50 2015 UTC,Was someone in the way?
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HoopAndHarm,3,Sun May 24 02:20:21 2015 UTC,"I thought Castro's bat might have been, but looking at it it just seemed his hand was moving too fast and the ball was held by maybe  the stitches."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,5,Sun May 24 02:24:52 2015 UTC,Damn it Trumbo..  Stop making me put my hope in you.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,6,Sun May 24 02:24:42 2015 UTC,"Fuck, Goldy has lightning quick speed with the bat."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,4,Sun May 24 02:27:36 2015 UTC,Clutch as Fuckkkkk! Loving Yasmany these past few weeks.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,5,Sun May 24 02:36:09 2015 UTC,That lemonade guy is the G.O.A.T vendor.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,giantjensen,5,Sun May 24 02:45:55 2015 UTC,HOF vendor
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 02:49:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't care what he's selling, I'm buying."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,qridproqro,5,Sun May 24 02:46:17 2015 UTC,Defense looks chillaxed out there
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HoopAndHarm,4,Sun May 24 02:56:19 2015 UTC,"Ahmed's so smooth, but looked hella close."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HolyCelestia,6,Sun May 24 03:14:26 2015 UTC,Really wished he would have thrown to first for the out. With how well Rubby has pitched there was really no reason for that.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HoopAndHarm,3,Sun May 24 03:15:24 2015 UTC,"Didn't end up hurting them, but yeah, really wish he just went for the easy out there."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,mind_elevated,5,Sun May 24 03:17:51 2015 UTC,DP!
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,giantjensen,4,Sun May 24 03:17:12 2015 UTC,"Wish all ballparks had a screen that way, because that bat would have been about 12 rows deep otherwise."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,6,Sun May 24 03:27:11 2015 UTC,.....  Shit.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,giantjensen,5,Sun May 24 03:41:53 2015 UTC,Dammit.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,5,Sun May 24 03:42:00 2015 UTC,Does every positional player on the team have a homer now?
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 04:14:41 2015 UTC,"All the regulars now, yeah."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,5,Sun May 24 04:15:39 2015 UTC,"That Phillies series (damn!) really lit a fire under this team. I'm loving how the offense is producing lately, the pitching has been better, and the defense has actually been there to help out when the pitching isn't.  Let's get 6 in a row!  Edit: Well, shit. Oh well. Get 'em tomorrow and take the series!"
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 04:40:48 2015 UTC,"You a Royals fan, Dbacks fan, or both?"
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,4,Sun May 24 04:41:49 2015 UTC,Royals fan living in AZ I think.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,5,Sun May 24 04:42:24 2015 UTC,God damn it
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,mind_elevated,6,Sun May 24 04:44:29 2015 UTC,"I fucking hate Perez. Tbh, Chip just lost this game if we do end up losing. Taking out JC after he was rolling for this chump? what the fuck"
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 04:44:46 2015 UTC,Especially against miggy who is hitting 333 against lefties this year
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,6,Sun May 24 04:47:00 2015 UTC,Why did they even change pitchers? J.C was doing great.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,2,Sun May 24 04:45:02 2015 UTC,"Matchups or some shit, who knows. Olly has his moments, but nothing so far."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 04:48:42 2015 UTC,"But they said he has a Worse ERA against Left handed hitters, it really made no sense, especially when JC was pitching really good"
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,WhatTheeFuckIsReddit,2,Sun May 24 04:53:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. Miggy can hit lefties, so why the switch? Doesn't make sense."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,WhatTheeFuckIsReddit,5,Sun May 24 05:02:15 2015 UTC,"Can we please not have tomorrow's game be this kind of butt clenching, hair pulling, high blood pressure affair?"
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HolyCelestia,3,Sun May 24 04:47:16 2015 UTC,Know any good pitchers?
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,2,Sun May 24 04:47:58 2015 UTC,"Some of the guys in the minors should be worth a call up. Ray, wherever he went."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HolyCelestia,2,Sun May 24 04:50:10 2015 UTC,I sure hope this happens soon
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,6,Sun May 24 04:51:20 2015 UTC,Too bad the bullpen can't just be Huddy and JC clones.  Edit: And Ziggy.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,qridproqro,4,Sun May 24 04:53:40 2015 UTC,No ziggy? :(
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 04:55:00 2015 UTC,"Ziggy, too. Can't forget him."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,qridproqro,3,Sun May 24 05:00:42 2015 UTC,We should have cloned 2014 Perez
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,4,Sun May 24 04:59:54 2015 UTC,More like 2013 Matt Reynolds
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,qridproqro,3,Sun May 24 05:01:51 2015 UTC,That woulda been sweet.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,5,Sun May 24 05:01:39 2015 UTC,HUDDY'D
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,sprawk,5,Sun May 24 04:53:42 2015 UTC,"""Rough night for the entire Diamondback bullpen."" No kidding. Lots of rough nights."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,Freyja_God,6,Sun May 24 05:16:24 2015 UTC,ugh..  Good game thread later y'all
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,groovygarrett,4,Sun May 24 05:25:45 2015 UTC,Fuck the cubs!!
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,sprawk,3,Sun May 24 02:02:06 2015 UTC,Woo!!!
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,groovygarrett,4,Sun May 24 02:02:13 2015 UTC,So my current plan is to hopefully get a summer job and if everything goes well I might visit AZ again. However job selection is so limited and I can't work off campus -_-
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 02:05:29 2015 UTC,Summer intern a possibility?
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,3,Sun May 24 02:06:29 2015 UTC,Been applying since last year Fall I think but either no reply or rejection :/ it's too late anyway the only choice is on campus job. I applied to bookstore (dining is full) and I'll go in and ask on Monday.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,TropangTexter,3,Sun May 24 02:12:25 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah wondered if it'd be too late. Bookstore wouldn't be bad. Get to see some interesting people working retail."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,4,Sun May 24 02:14:26 2015 UTC,Oh man. The black jerseys are sexy as fuck.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,Freyja_God,4,Sun May 24 02:12:01 2015 UTC,"Indeed they are, but not quite as good as the purple and teal.  Btw, StL/KC officially canned or still a chance?"
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,3,Sun May 24 02:15:04 2015 UTC,Purple and teal will always be the best.  KC game called. We win.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HolyCelestia,2,Sun May 24 02:17:40 2015 UTC,Agreed. Lovely unis.  Damn. Game was looking to be awesome.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,2,Sun May 24 02:25:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would've preferred the game to go the full time. Wins from called games just feel cheap.  Ah well, a W is a W."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HolyCelestia,2,Sun May 24 04:34:31 2015 UTC,No question. And another loss for the Cards.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,5,Sun May 24 04:36:26 2015 UTC,Can anyone explain why Mark Grace has never won a Legends Race?
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,5,Sun May 24 04:07:27 2015 UTC,He won one time!!  But then right after that they took his win back.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,Freyja_God,3,Sun May 24 04:11:46 2015 UTC,I know Grace likes it but I'd be curious of the origin of the idea.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HoopAndHarm,4,Sun May 24 04:08:11 2015 UTC,"Tied to a running (heh) joke when he was color commentator, they just kept it going"
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,flaming_scepter,3,Sun May 24 04:19:13 2015 UTC,Can you explain that a little more?
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,mind_elevated,3,Sun May 24 04:23:25 2015 UTC,I can't since I simply don't remember more than that other than that Mark was constantly campaigning for at least one win.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,2,Sun May 24 04:28:40 2015 UTC,"I think it has something to do with being the lovable loser and how he always gets distracted by some aspect near the race. First I think it was just a dig at Grace when he was broadcasting games, give him hope and all that, and it's just kind of stayed that way since."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 04:35:06 2015 UTC,TUFFACO!!  Edit: Almost BACK to BACK
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,4,Sun May 24 04:14:47 2015 UTC,"Sans that one inning, Rubby was fantastic and dominant tonight. Really like what I see from him, just a few chinks in the armor to fill out."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,2,Sun May 24 04:23:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. One bad inning that could have been a lot worse, but then the Cubs ended up giving it right back. All is well."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,WhatTheeFuckIsReddit,4,Sun May 24 04:24:43 2015 UTC,Mr. Pickles killin it so far.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 04:34:02 2015 UTC,mmmm delicious
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,WhatTheeFuckIsReddit,3,Sun May 24 04:34:58 2015 UTC,I just had dinner god damn it.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,2,Sun May 24 04:37:21 2015 UTC,Whatcha have?
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 04:41:40 2015 UTC,Ramen and beer.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,4,Sun May 24 04:43:18 2015 UTC,"Well, shit."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,4,Sun May 24 04:44:08 2015 UTC,Look away children.. Look away
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,4,Sun May 24 04:45:05 2015 UTC,"Whatever, free baseball?"
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,2,Sun May 24 04:47:53 2015 UTC,Your optimism is warming my ice cold heart.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 04:48:45 2015 UTC,fucking perez god damnit
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,4,Sun May 24 04:47:58 2015 UTC,That's why I love huddy.  He didn't have his best stuff tonight but battled and got the out.  Need more pitchers like him
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,Freyja_God,4,Sun May 24 04:54:26 2015 UTC,"Well, Bronson needs something to do until he can pitch."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HoopAndHarm,4,Sun May 24 05:05:23 2015 UTC,Damn Fowler was not fooled
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,mind_elevated,4,Sun May 24 05:09:12 2015 UTC,God dammit son of a whore fucking fuck.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,mind_elevated,3,Sun May 24 05:24:45 2015 UTC,God dammit Tuffy.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,clevelandindians63,3,Sun May 24 02:18:34 2015 UTC,SIT DOWN!!!
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HoopAndHarm,3,Sun May 24 02:19:51 2015 UTC,"So Jake Arrieta, are we gonna light him up or naaa???"
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,TropangTexter,3,Sun May 24 02:22:09 2015 UTC,Hope so!
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 02:24:08 2015 UTC,We're getting off to a good start
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,clevelandindians63,3,Sun May 24 02:37:08 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, digging it so far. Nice to see this kind of turnaround."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 02:42:51 2015 UTC,Trumbo! Getting it done!
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,Freyja_God,3,Sun May 24 02:23:48 2015 UTC,Hell of an at-bat there.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,leroy92,3,Sun May 24 02:28:33 2015 UTC,Holy shit that was some play.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,3,Sun May 24 02:29:37 2015 UTC,It's funny watching Goldy pump his legs as fast as he can.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,Freyja_God,3,Sun May 24 02:36:15 2015 UTC,"So that was a Harry Caray ""HEY!"" after all."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 02:44:55 2015 UTC,Shit. Rubby can do it all!
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HoopAndHarm,3,Sun May 24 02:52:25 2015 UTC,Shawon Dunston. Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HoopAndHarm,3,Sun May 24 03:02:16 2015 UTC,STARWARS
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,3,Sun May 24 03:05:51 2015 UTC,"I love the aggressiveness on the basepaths, but holy shit we are running into so many outs on the bases."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 03:25:56 2015 UTC,Whatever tuffy just told ruby just fucked everything up. U could almost see that base clearing happen after he hit bryant
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 03:44:58 2015 UTC,Who's the awesome motherfucker that snuck into nick Ahmed's bedroom and sprinkled hitter dust all over his pillow?
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,3,Sun May 24 03:51:05 2015 UTC,Would you guys rather have AJ or ender as leadoff?
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HoopAndHarm,4,Sun May 24 03:52:50 2015 UTC,"Id take Ender. I like an Ender, AJ, Goldy, Tomas 1/2/3/4."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,2,Sun May 24 03:56:09 2015 UTC,maybe Lamb sandwiched in between Goldy and Tomas to provide a R-L-R balance once he's back but either way I like that order as well.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,mind_elevated,3,Sun May 24 04:22:36 2015 UTC,"Both are good in it. Speed, nice OBP, can drive in runs when they hit with guys on. Usually see a lot of pitches."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 03:55:03 2015 UTC,I just feel like AJ gets on base more.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,2,Sun May 24 03:56:17 2015 UTC,"Just based on OBP, AJ was about 30 points higher going into the game tonight. So yeah, he does get on more, but both work fine in it, imo. Still not sure about AJ hitting cleanup when he isn't leadoff, however."
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 04:03:38 2015 UTC,TACOSSSS!!!

azdiamondbacks,371u2r,WhatTheeFuckIsReddit,3,Sun May 24 04:23:58 2015 UTC,Pickles.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HoopAndHarm,3,Sun May 24 04:26:56 2015 UTC,God damn.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,brandonatron,4,Sun May 24 04:30:17 2015 UTC,sooooooooo close. nice catch though.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 04:32:04 2015 UTC,I really dont like Oliver Perez but I hope he can get Miggy out.
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,HoopAndHarm,3,Sun May 24 04:36:45 2015 UTC,Super good job Perez
azdiamondbacks,371u2r,bp9801,3,Sun May 24 04:40:47 2015 UTC,"If this game goes extras, maybe it's just a ploy to get more flex pack ticket sales."

azdiamondbacks,372chd,Antarix,5,Sun May 24 07:20:38 2015 UTC,"I hope so, and that would likely require trading Trumbo (my preference) or sending Peralta to the minors.  Tomas did look decent defensively for a while, just making the plays he should make. But he has made some really ugly plays the last couple of days. More like what I was expecting after how bad he looked there in the Spring."

azdiamondbacks,36yho2,shwoople,14,Sat May 23 06:04:02 2015 UTC,"I defended him last year, because he DID have 32 saves, which was half of our wins last year. But yeah, he fucking sucks this year"
azdiamondbacks,36yho2,Raptor231408,8,Sat May 23 04:44:38 2015 UTC,"32 saves with some of the worst perifs in the game.  He's chinatown garbage and he has been analytically garbage since he left the soxs.  Also, velocity went down the tube.  Just terrible all around."
azdiamondbacks,36yho2,Freyja_God,2,Sat May 23 07:35:45 2015 UTC,"My counter argument there would be that the save can be a very overrated statistic. You can find various links about that online that can explain it better than I can.  And while Reed did have the 32 saves, he allowed way too many runs and HRs to be trustworthy in that position when you want the ""closer"" to be a guy who can shut down the opposing offense with little stress.  I looked at BRef and sorted all the NL pitchers in 2014 by how many saves they had. Out of the top 10 in Saves, Reed had by far the worst ERA (4.25) and second worst in FIP (4.10). Next closest in ERA was Rosenthal with 3.20. Fransisco Rodriguez had the worst FIP (4.50, he had a good ERA but gave up a ton of dingerz) but the next closest one to Reed was Soriano with 3.08.  What I am basically saying here is that even though Reed got saves last year, he gave up way too many runs to be trustworthy. And he has been that way throughout his career. He can get a lot of strikeouts when his slider is working, but it doesn't work often enough. And he has a fastball that is flat with declining velocity since he was in Chicago."
azdiamondbacks,36yho2,joecb91,10,Sat May 23 17:40:31 2015 UTC,"Wow. 5 batters faced, 2 hits, two runs, 2 walks. All for one out. Just pathetic."

azdiamondbacks,36y177,necropaw,3,Sat May 23 05:30:53 2015 UTC,CST master race.
azdiamondbacks,36y177,Freyja_God,2,Sat May 23 05:31:59 2015 UTC,Still better than that 18 inning Yankees game a month ago or so.
azdiamondbacks,36y177,mind_elevated,6,Sat May 23 05:31:37 2015 UTC,It's 10:30.  The world revolves around us!  Greenwich time?  More like Arizona time.

azdiamondbacks,36xl4v,TripsOnDubs,1 point,Fri May 22 23:19:57 2015 UTC,Yes. They give you a paper slip when they scan your e-ticket at the gate.
azdiamondbacks,36xl4v,Patrae,1 point,Fri May 22 23:58:51 2015 UTC,Thanks. Got in successfully. I was wondering how their scanners scan barcodes and QR codes but they do flawlessly.
azdiamondbacks,36xl4v,Patrae,2,Sat May 23 05:18:09 2015 UTC,No problem. I've been using the e tickets since opening day when I've gone. Hope you enjoyed the game.
azdiamondbacks,36t10g,HolyCelestia,30,Thu May 21 21:54:37 2015 UTC,"We're a docile bunch, but stay out of our fucking pool."
azdiamondbacks,36t10g,cardinals1996,19,Thu May 21 22:01:05 2015 UTC,FUXK TH E DODGERS!!!!!!
azdiamondbacks,36t10g,WhatTheeFuckIsReddit,12,Thu May 21 22:02:44 2015 UTC,As a Rockies fan here in the valley I have never once had a problem with DBacks fans at any game or otherwise. The only complaint about AZ sports fans is that they bandwagon real hard.
azdiamondbacks,36t10g,SmartToaster,2,Fri May 22 00:48:21 2015 UTC,"I met a guy at work that liked the Yankees for baseball, the Lakers for basketball, and the Cowboys for football. This was a couple years ago when the Lakers were good. He was born in the valley."
azdiamondbacks,36t10g,RetroYouth,3,Fri May 22 03:26:07 2015 UTC,"He must be a fan of 1970s Steelers too.  Man fuck those, I lived through 2012 Cardinals, 2014 Suns, 2014 Diamondbacks and 2014 Coyotes. I know it's not much but since I only got here in 2012 I guess that's a lot to go through :/"
azdiamondbacks,36t10g,mbarnar,1 point,Fri May 22 03:48:05 2015 UTC,I've never lived in AZ but been a die hard fan since 1998. You're journey is just beginning my friend.
azdiamondbacks,36t10g,fromthedesert,9,Sat May 23 11:01:34 2015 UTC,How the hell are Dodger fans not higher on that list? That is my real question.
azdiamondbacks,36t10g,kittypoop,9,Fri May 22 01:40:59 2015 UTC,"Cubs are higher than the Dodgers. And both fanbases love coming out to chase field when they play the Diamondbacks, however one them is annoying as fuck. And it's not the Cubs."
azdiamondbacks,36t10g,Leakyradio,3,Fri May 22 04:30:41 2015 UTC,I also thought the Dodgers should be higher up.
azdiamondbacks,36t10g,BransonAllen,0,Fri May 22 07:42:43 2015 UTC,Right?
azdiamondbacks,36t10g,SmartToaster,5,Fri May 22 18:14:36 2015 UTC,Probably because outside of the NL West nobody really knows how terrible they are.
azdiamondbacks,36t10g,al_v_,8,Fri May 22 04:09:50 2015 UTC,gotta get fans first am i right
azdiamondbacks,36t10g,iceburn_firon,1 point,Fri May 22 01:06:15 2015 UTC,"Having done about half of the MLB stadiums, Red Sox would have my vote by a long margin. Phillies would be 2nd. Then the Yankees. After that it seems to me to be a steep drop off. I've never seen the Cards fans as being crappy."
azdiamondbacks,36t10g,filippo_b,1 point,Fri May 22 20:09:01 2015 UTC,Well usually there is an equal number of the opposing team fans as well. It sucks going to see an Arizona team play with what it seems like no home field advantage.
azdiamondbacks,36t10g,Ragefield,1 point,Sat May 23 04:37:31 2015 UTC,"From January, with a vote count around 300.  This site is irrelevant."

azdiamondbacks,36r9me,Costigan,7,Thu May 21 19:04:25 2015 UTC,Does... did... we just see Reed become a good pitcher?
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,CHAARRGER,5,Thu May 21 19:21:16 2015 UTC,"Well the Marlins made Hellickson look good, so let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet.   But what I saw today brought a tear to my eye."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,Costigan,9,Thu May 21 19:46:44 2015 UTC,123 for reed... is this real life?
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,mind_elevated,3,Thu May 21 19:03:34 2015 UTC,It's scary that's what it is.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,5,Thu May 21 19:05:08 2015 UTC,They're going to have a hard time getting Yas to leave Miami
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,Electric_Warrior_,6,Thu May 21 16:19:04 2015 UTC,This marks the first time I've ever overslept the start of a Diamondbacks game
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,2,Thu May 21 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"I nearly did, lol. Was tired from packing."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 16:30:48 2015 UTC,Where are you going?
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,amperx11,2,Thu May 21 16:36:10 2015 UTC,"Not me yet, but my parents. They're moving from southern NM to southern AZ, so helping them move. Lot of stuff and I'm taking a bunch back to my place, but the rest is heading there.  Weird seeing the house partially empty."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 16:41:17 2015 UTC,That's a big move.. awesome of you to help out with that!
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,amperx11,1 point,Thu May 21 16:46:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's tough doing it all on our own, since the last move we had a moving company. My dad is enlisting the help of some high school football players to help with loading up the truck, so should make things easier.  I'm not looking forward to hauling a big box of books into my place later tonight. I have schoolwork that I can't do on my laptop, so I won't be able to help out with loading the truck. Most other things, however, I'll have helped with. One box of mine is just random stuff tossed in, lol."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,2,Thu May 21 16:56:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the hardest part I think is lifting and moving heavy stuff.. I'm moving this weekend but that's just into an apartment, moving an entire household is a whole other story."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,amperx11,1 point,Thu May 21 17:09:54 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, definitely. Last night my folks were up until nearly midnight getting things packed, and I was up until 2. Today have more stuff to get to. Things in the kitchen, living room, and bathrooms. Plus bedroom stuff, but that's mostly just the beds and dressers.  I just wonder where I'm putting half the stuff I'm taking back to my apartment, lol. Figure some things will stay packed up until I move out of there in about a month. Still be easier to deal with an apartment than a whole house, like you said."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,2,Thu May 21 17:13:29 2015 UTC,"It's always when you're moving when you realize how much stuff you have and that it'd be so much easier to live a minimalist life style, haha"
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,amperx11,1 point,Thu May 21 17:22:51 2015 UTC,"Haha, oh yeah. Plus you find things you hadn't seen in years and thought were long gone, lol.  Where you moving to?"

azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bbdv,4,Thu May 21 19:17:09 2015 UTC,Good win and hell of a sweep but I miss pre hit in a head by a baseball archie
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,TropangTexter,2,Thu May 21 19:25:50 2015 UTC,He's young and still in his rookie year. He just needs time and practice and he'll be back on form in no time. Kid's got a ton of potential.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,qridproqro,4,Thu May 21 20:50:51 2015 UTC,No post game thread?  Guess I'll just put this here.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,qridproqro,3,Thu May 21 19:35:00 2015 UTC,"Too worried about Ender at first, so Latos spikes the ball and Ender moves over anyway."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 16:14:31 2015 UTC,"Oh good, getting to see Archie's injury again."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 16:24:14 2015 UTC,Dammit Penny.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 16:25:59 2015 UTC,So early for a game!
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,amperx11,3,Thu May 21 16:26:25 2015 UTC,Tied...
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 16:27:43 2015 UTC,"Such a slow roller, only real chance."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 16:30:11 2015 UTC,Ugh... what is with Archie?
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,4,Thu May 21 16:34:05 2015 UTC,I was expecting a not so sharp outing his first time back... Hopefully he gets it together soon.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bbdv,5,Thu May 21 16:36:06 2015 UTC,"If we're being honest, the success he was having earlier was partly due to luck. This might just be the law of regression at work."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,3,Thu May 21 16:37:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, me too. First game back was expected to be a little shaky, but didn't think this one would be with how the Marlins have been lately."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,5,Thu May 21 16:42:05 2015 UTC,For one thing he's essentially a one pitch guy today. Earlier this year he had that curveball working too. I don't know how reliable he can be until he figures out that changeup which he's thrown exactly 5 of all year.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,3,Thu May 21 16:42:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he needs to utilize more than just the heater. Mix it up, because otherwise hitters will just sit fastball and ignore anything else."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 16:50:51 2015 UTC,:/
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,3,Thu May 21 16:36:18 2015 UTC,"Well, that could have ended much worse.  3-1 is still a winnable game.  Time for the offense to pick it up!"
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,ellius,3,Thu May 21 16:38:49 2015 UTC,He was starting to hit his spots much better towards the end of the inning.  Hopefully that bodes well for the rest of the game.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,ellius,1 point,Thu May 21 16:41:28 2015 UTC,"Hopefully. Offense could help out, too."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 16:51:14 2015 UTC,Pacheco with the wheels!
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 16:43:18 2015 UTC,I don't like our upcoming schedule. Cubs then Cardinals.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,1 point,Thu May 21 16:49:13 2015 UTC,Ooof. That's a doozy.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 16:51:42 2015 UTC,Ender!
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 16:49:37 2015 UTC,Nice work Ender! Getting Archie's back
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,3,Thu May 21 16:49:53 2015 UTC,OK Archie 1-2-3 plz
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,3,Thu May 21 16:53:02 2015 UTC,God dammit stop hitting him!!
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,2,Thu May 21 16:59:12 2015 UTC,oh shit my game is delayed a bit wha happun
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bbdv,3,Thu May 21 17:00:35 2015 UTC,Hit a grounder off Archie's leg but he's okay
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,3,Thu May 21 17:02:21 2015 UTC,STANDED  Let's tie it up!
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,3,Thu May 21 17:00:14 2015 UTC,"The fuck, how is that a wild pitch? He obviously missed but Pacheco should have stopped that"
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,1 point,Thu May 21 17:13:26 2015 UTC,No idea. Been spiking a few lately.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 17:14:09 2015 UTC,Looked like a nasty pitch to fool Marteen that way.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 17:14:40 2015 UTC,"Fuck, what is up with Dbacks being on MLBN lately?  I want to watch :-("
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,qridproqro,3,Thu May 21 17:46:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was in the same spot before I realized it was on MLBN. I couldn't even find a stream. :/"
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,2,Thu May 21 18:06:39 2015 UTC,You have the Ms and Os instead?
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,2,Thu May 21 17:47:23 2015 UTC,"Aren't they on MLBN as well?  I was saying I don't have MLBN, and I can't get it on MLB.tv since I'm in-market."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,qridproqro,2,Thu May 21 17:58:45 2015 UTC,"Ooooh, didn't know you didn't have MLBN. Well that stinks then. I was surprised when MLBN switched me over to the D'backs, since I wasn't expecting it."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 18:01:23 2015 UTC,Paul Goldschmidt Aaron Hill - best pinch hitter of all time
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,3,Thu May 21 18:04:49 2015 UTC,"Power just got back, and we have a new game!"
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,HolyCelestia,3,Thu May 21 18:08:43 2015 UTC,"No Goldy, but A-a-ron instead. Hmm."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 18:08:51 2015 UTC,Considering what happened the last time Goldy pinch hit I'm okay with this
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,1 point,Thu May 21 18:09:39 2015 UTC,"True, and this one went pretty well."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 18:12:52 2015 UTC,Lets go!!
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,AzWiLdCaT1988,3,Thu May 21 18:09:01 2015 UTC,Chicken Wings from A-a-ron!
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 18:10:25 2015 UTC,NICE!!
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,AzWiLdCaT1988,3,Thu May 21 18:13:43 2015 UTC,Stand these bitches   Edit: dammit Martin
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,brandonatron,3,Thu May 21 18:24:40 2015 UTC,That was one close play.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 18:29:16 2015 UTC,"Wow, that was fast"
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,3,Thu May 21 18:29:45 2015 UTC,YES!
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 18:52:43 2015 UTC,NICE!  Hopefully Baker is okay.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,ellius,1 point,Thu May 21 18:53:33 2015 UTC,"Might have been a hamstring pull, unless they said something else I didn't catch."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 18:58:52 2015 UTC,SAFE
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,3,Thu May 21 18:53:44 2015 UTC,Now lets go Ziegler - Burgos and head home
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,scootilypoop,3,Thu May 21 18:56:51 2015 UTC,When did Chafin get rid of the stache?
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 18:59:10 2015 UTC,After the Phillies series I think
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,2,Thu May 21 18:59:40 2015 UTC,Good time to get rid of it.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 19:00:30 2015 UTC,do we really have to use Reed here? Why not ziggy or burgos or LITERALLY ANYBODY
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,mind_elevated,3,Thu May 21 18:59:30 2015 UTC,"Burgos has the day off, I believe.  Not sure about Ziggy. May be saving him for 9th?"
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,ellius,2,Thu May 21 19:02:55 2015 UTC,Maybe he'll be better than before.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"Congrats d back fans, you're about to sweep the worst team of all time. (Can you believe we won 8 straight at one point?)"
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,JL16,3,Thu May 21 19:07:04 2015 UTC,It's not over yet with Stanton at bat and our Bullpen on the mound.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,ellius,1 point,Thu May 21 19:10:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know about all time, but I'm honestly surprised at how poorly the Marlins are playing."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,2,Thu May 21 19:08:54 2015 UTC,"The talent is there, the heart isn't. Our bullpen blew 10 games, we'd have been over .500 to start this series if our closer wasn't on the team. Now it's a combo of not caring and having no luck."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,JL16,2,Thu May 21 19:13:59 2015 UTC,"10 games? Shit. I knew there were a lot of blown leads, but that's just insane. Cishek did absolutely implode there. Any explanation for why he just suddenly dropped off?  There an over/under on Loria blowing up the team yet again?"
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,2,Thu May 21 19:17:08 2015 UTC,"He's lost a few MPH on his fastball and he can only locate his slider in 2 places. Way outside or right down the middle.   It's Loria so I literally have no idea how to answer that question, I will say the city has never been this mad at him, unfortunately we can really do anything about it."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,JL16,1 point,Thu May 21 19:27:02 2015 UTC,"Lost his confidence, or something. Velocity drop can be any number of factors, but that slider is concerning, since it's been so good.  I wonder if there's enough of a lack of a support the other owners will take action. Or MLB. Probably a long shot at either, but never know."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,2,Thu May 21 19:39:47 2015 UTC,"I think you need every single owner to agree for them to override him.   And yea Cishek has no confidence anymore, he has as many blown saves this year as he did all last season."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,JL16,1 point,Thu May 21 20:13:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, think that's it with owners. Possibly 2/3, but maybe that's just for rule changes.  That's a pretty terrible number. Month and a half into the year and the dude has been so bad. Wonder if just running him out there all the time has been hurting more than helping, since anytime a runner gets on base he's probably wondering how soon before he scores."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,1 point,Thu May 21 20:28:41 2015 UTC,more than the Reyes/Burherle trade?
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,TropangTexter,1 point,Thu May 21 23:48:12 2015 UTC,Not too mad about that. Loved Burherle and wish we kept him but Reyes didn't live up to his contract and it gave our now shortstop a chance who I really like and he doesn't cost anywhere near what Reyes did. At the time we were mad just because it showed you literally can't trust Loria at all and big names wouldn't want to play for him.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,JL16,3,Fri May 22 02:50:00 2015 UTC,Almost there
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,AzWiLdCaT1988,3,Thu May 21 19:12:40 2015 UTC,"My anus, it's disappeared."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bbdv,3,Thu May 21 19:13:16 2015 UTC,Dbacks called series!
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,mind_elevated,1 point,Thu May 21 19:14:36 2015 UTC,Needed it after Philly.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 19:19:51 2015 UTC,Ziggy is ridiculous.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,ellius,3,Thu May 21 19:14:45 2015 UTC,There we go!!
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,AzWiLdCaT1988,3,Thu May 21 19:15:02 2015 UTC,I enjoy wins.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,qridproqro,2,Thu May 21 19:20:05 2015 UTC,About time.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,2,Thu May 21 16:36:23 2015 UTC,Strand him at second!
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,2,Thu May 21 16:58:43 2015 UTC,BRING EM UP AND SIT EM DOWN
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,2,Thu May 21 17:18:05 2015 UTC,Great pitch to get Bour
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,2,Thu May 21 17:52:02 2015 UTC,"Phew. Another scary inning, but Penny was there to help out."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,2,Thu May 21 17:55:45 2015 UTC,Hah!
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,2,Thu May 21 18:03:20 2015 UTC,That's some losing streak.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,2,Thu May 21 18:17:20 2015 UTC,"Nice grab by Yas, but that was it."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,2,Thu May 21 18:17:34 2015 UTC,Some double clutching right there.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,2,Thu May 21 18:47:40 2015 UTC,LET'S GET FAT RIGHT HERE for realz this time
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bbdv,2,Thu May 21 18:50:25 2015 UTC,This pitcher is having a very unlucky day
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,giantjensen,2,Thu May 21 18:50:42 2015 UTC,Damn.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,2,Thu May 21 18:50:46 2015 UTC,What a throw
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,1 point,Thu May 21 18:52:07 2015 UTC,Oh MLB Network. Thank you for showing the game today.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,1 point,Thu May 21 16:11:56 2015 UTC,Ender with a leadoff hit!
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,1 point,Thu May 21 16:13:26 2015 UTC,Peralta manning the third spot today. Trumbo over at first. Should be an interesting lineup.
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,1 point,Thu May 21 16:16:07 2015 UTC,"Ahhhhh, fuck."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,1 point,Thu May 21 17:28:20 2015 UTC,"So, time to get someone throwing in the pen?"
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,2,Thu May 21 17:30:45 2015 UTC,If things start to get ugly again I would think so
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,go_dbacks,1 point,Thu May 21 17:47:13 2015 UTC,"Yep, and hey, Delgado is throwing now. Speak of the devil."
azdiamondbacks,36r9me,bp9801,1 point,Thu May 21 17:48:49 2015 UTC,Dammit Trumbo
azdiamondbacks,36pn2n,underpaidITguy,6,Thu May 21 03:02:35 2015 UTC,A.J. Pollock had quite a night tonight to follow up last nights pinch hit homerun. Good for him.
azdiamondbacks,36pf8n,SnakeBot,8,Thu May 21 01:58:51 2015 UTC,Chase was on fire today!  Tomorrow is Archie day! MFW it's not going to be on FSAZ
azdiamondbacks,36pf8n,go_dbacks,6,Thu May 21 02:05:08 2015 UTC,Archie needs to shake off the rust
azdiamondbacks,36pf8n,edtehgar,8,Thu May 21 02:19:17 2015 UTC,"Even with the technical difficulties, so sweet to get that win! Too bad Chase couldn't finish it out, but he pitched a hell of a game!  No TV for Archie Day. :("
azdiamondbacks,36pf8n,bp9801,6,Thu May 21 02:07:11 2015 UTC,Can we go and schedule nothing but the marlins?
azdiamondbacks,36pf8n,edtehgar,3,Thu May 21 02:21:13 2015 UTC,Probably make life a little easier.
azdiamondbacks,36pf8n,bp9801,2,Thu May 21 02:22:58 2015 UTC,"The Marlins are a fucking flaming car wreck of a franchise, I love it. If it didn't mean facing Stanton for the next 13 years I wouldn't mind playing them A LOT more..."
azdiamondbacks,36pf8n,WhatTheeFuckIsReddit,2,Thu May 21 05:34:25 2015 UTC,Pitch around Stanton some and problem averted.
azdiamondbacks,36pf8n,bp9801,1 point,Thu May 21 05:56:53 2015 UTC,With the pitching of the Rockies
azdiamondbacks,36pf8n,joecb91,3,Fri May 22 04:27:33 2015 UTC,"That was such a fun game to watch. Chase pitched a gem, AJ wreaked havoc on the basepaths, and Ahmed got two hits!! I wonder whats gonna happen to our infield once Lamb comes back. Yasmany has looked legit both offensively and defensively recently."
azdiamondbacks,36pf8n,HoopAndHarm,3,Thu May 21 04:09:26 2015 UTC,"This team is so young, talented and fun to watch.  I love it"
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,SnakeBot,12,Wed May 20 21:21:36 2015 UTC,Does anyone else think Dan Jennings is in over his head?
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,oldtombombadil,7,Wed May 20 23:21:21 2015 UTC,Literally everyone on the Marlins sub agrees. We are minutes away from completely losing hope.
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,iharland,5,Wed May 20 23:56:40 2015 UTC,We know the feeling. Hope was at dangerously low levels midway through April last year
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,5,Thu May 21 00:18:50 2015 UTC,He got severely out couched last night. Chip was rocking him to sleep
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,mind_elevated,3,Wed May 20 23:40:40 2015 UTC,I think it would be easier to count the people who don't
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,9,Wed May 20 23:24:00 2015 UTC,"Diamondbacks campaining to rename Miami ""Small Ball City"""
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,5,Wed May 20 23:36:59 2015 UTC,Engineered those runs in. Nice jobs by the bottom of the order there
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,mind_elevated,6,Wed May 20 23:38:53 2015 UTC,And they didn't get either out!
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,Patman64,7,Thu May 21 00:28:09 2015 UTC,Oh my god the small ball!
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,7,Thu May 21 00:28:10 2015 UTC,"Rubby had a gem, JHell was shockingly efficient, and now Chase is lighting them up. Digging this pitching against Miami."
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,bp9801,7,Thu May 21 01:05:37 2015 UTC,Ahmed is really starting to figure it out
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,7,Thu May 21 01:18:31 2015 UTC,"It looks like Pollock is feeling very comfortable at the plate after yesterday's bomb, plus I think he knows the Marlins pitcher on a personal level. Love having a player that can beat you with a homer one night and his legs the next. Great instinct to come home on that pickle."
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,mind_elevated,6,Thu May 21 00:34:25 2015 UTC,Can't stop this running game
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,ThisMachineKILLS,7,Thu May 21 00:58:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know what dark magic Ahmed is using to get these hits, but whatever it is, it's working."
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,bp9801,5,Thu May 21 01:18:54 2015 UTC,And we're .500 on the road trip!
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,5,Thu May 21 01:49:39 2015 UTC,hi
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,ThisMachineKILLS,3,Wed May 20 21:52:50 2015 UTC,sup

azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,4,Thu May 21 00:12:11 2015 UTC,Absolutely robbed on that last ab
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,scootilypoop,4,Thu May 21 00:15:42 2015 UTC,That was a beautiful diving play though
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,kronos22,5,Thu May 21 00:16:44 2015 UTC,"Hell ya, Gordon is pretty amazing"
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,scootilypoop,5,Thu May 21 00:18:04 2015 UTC,So I guess the play where Pollock scored counts as stealing home
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,3,Thu May 21 00:47:53 2015 UTC,Does it? Interesting.
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 00:49:46 2015 UTC,"It would have had to have been, right? I don't know how else it could have been scored"
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,ThisMachineKILLS,4,Thu May 21 00:56:35 2015 UTC,Almost a hell of a grab by Peralta. Damn.
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 00:52:29 2015 UTC,So close. Dbacks defense has been killer today regardless
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,ThisMachineKILLS,2,Thu May 21 00:57:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely. Defense has been on point."
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,bp9801,6,Thu May 21 01:04:25 2015 UTC,TÁCOS!!!!!!
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,Patman64,4,Thu May 21 01:01:08 2015 UTC,Looked like he just put his arm out in front of the ball
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,ThisMachineKILLS,2,Thu May 21 01:41:05 2015 UTC,"To me it looked like he didn't bother dodging like most people do, I guess he just wanted to be on base."
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,MiaCannons,5,Thu May 21 01:43:57 2015 UTC,Ziggy gonna Zig
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,brandonatron,4,Thu May 21 01:49:00 2015 UTC,Summer

azdiamondbacks,36odlq,ellius,5,Thu May 21 01:42:56 2015 UTC,Thank God for MLB at Bat. I wasn't able to watch the game because of dumb work. Looks like it's been a good game! Glad we were able to recover after that shit show in Philly.  Hopefully we can keep the momentum going!
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,abryant0462,3,Thu May 21 01:43:27 2015 UTC,Let's keep Chase-ing down the Padres!

azdiamondbacks,36odlq,mind_elevated,3,Wed May 20 23:10:40 2015 UTC,Not a fan of this strike zone
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,3,Wed May 20 23:18:51 2015 UTC,How is Tomás doing this?
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,3,Wed May 20 23:23:31 2015 UTC,That was a hell of a takeout slide from Goldy. O.O
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,3,Wed May 20 23:52:34 2015 UTC,That right side of the zone (ump's point of view) is very fluid
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,3,Wed May 20 23:53:47 2015 UTC,So far so good on the game! Nice distraction to have while packing.
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,bp9801,3,Thu May 21 00:07:20 2015 UTC,"Man, Goldy shouldn't miss those"
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,5,Thu May 21 00:22:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was a really good pitch to hit.   Goldy is definitely having a slump, but his don't usually last very long. Not worried"

azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,3,Thu May 21 01:15:39 2015 UTC,AJ Pollock is unstoppable
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,3,Thu May 21 01:30:13 2015 UTC,Goldy just missed another pitch he usually smashes
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,3,Thu May 21 01:30:55 2015 UTC,Damnit I wanted AJ to steal
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,mind_elevated,3,Thu May 21 01:32:04 2015 UTC,So can Tomás' nickname be Cuban sandwich or nah
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,ThisMachineKILLS,3,Thu May 21 01:35:35 2015 UTC,Cuban missile is taken. Everthing else is fair game!
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,3,Thu May 21 01:36:53 2015 UTC,Cuban Cigars.

azdiamondbacks,36odlq,cardinals1996,4,Thu May 21 02:00:03 2015 UTC,I can't wait to see what Yá$ does tonight. Hopefully we can get Chase a fucking win. He deserves one. Let's keep these exciting games (and wins) coming.
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,bbdv,2,Wed May 20 22:15:20 2015 UTC,Chase is cruising along
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,2,Thu May 21 00:03:27 2015 UTC,Chase!!! Wow
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,2,Thu May 21 00:17:32 2015 UTC,"Really, really inconsistent zone"
azdiamondbacks,36odlq,go_dbacks,2,Thu May 21 00:21:22 2015 UTC,New way to get a 1000 OPB - just throw yourself at the ball!
azdiamondbacks,36lkik,TropangTexter,6,Wed May 20 07:41:54 2015 UTC,"I've been as big of a supporter of Trumbo since day one and have never waivered from that position. That being said, it's in the organizations best interest to trade Trumbo. He'll be in his 2nd year of arbitration at the end of the season and will without a doubt be getting more money than he is this year. There's also not a massive need for him, as you said with the outfield depth.   As far as what will happen between Tomas and Lamb. Lamb should get more starts at 3rd than Tomas. I really want to see Lamb get chances against Left handed pitching, but I think for the time being, Tomas should get the games where lefties pitch. Tomas will also be getting a lot of AB's off the bench when Lamb or Peralta get matched up with lefties."
azdiamondbacks,36lkik,Antarix,4,Wed May 20 10:51:03 2015 UTC,"My preference would be to trade Trumbo and move Tomas to LF  I want to see at least one of Ender or Peralta playing every day, and Pollock is our best outfielder so he is off the table. That leaves Trumbo, and after a very nice .319/.338/.542 in April he is looking more like the all or nothing guy from 2014 with a .226/.293/.491 line in May which honestly is more along the lines of what I would expect from him than what he did in April (especially the OBP which is my biggest issue with his offensive game, I can live with the strikeouts as long as you still get on base at a reasonable amount and hit for power). Also, he has struck out 14 times in 53 ABs this month compared to 12 in 72 ABs in April so while not as bad as say 2013 Trumbo those issues are starting to return.  He is about to get expensive because arbitration loves HRs and RBIs and that is what Trumbo does while having issues with the other parts of his game. I think the best thing to do would be trading him to some AL team where he has a lot more value as a 1B/DH than he does in the outfield.  And then after this, the outfield would be Tomas, Pollock/Ender, and Ender/Peralta which I think would be pretty solid offensively. It also lets you get two LHBs with good power that can also hit for average and add a lot more balance to the lineup.  The main thing though is that I want Tomas and Lamb to be in the lineup together almost every day if they are going to be on the roster together. Moving Trumbo makes the most sense for that to happen IMO.   Lamb and Tomas are going to see some regression to the mean at some point though because their K rates are surprisingly low right now (Tomas was at 18% in Cuba, and around 16% now facing better pitchers. Don't see that continuing) and their BABIP's are sky high (.440 and .409 respectively), those are going to come down. But I trust them to be able to adjust and stay productive.  This season is about playing the young players that will be the future of this team, and I hope we get to see a ton of Lamb and Tomas on the field together as the season goes on."
azdiamondbacks,36lkik,joecb91,1 point,Thu May 21 06:48:57 2015 UTC,"Didnt Lamb play SS last year, can we just rotate Lamb, Tomas, and Ahmed? Tomas and Lamb have proven to be good pinch hitters. I'm not sure if it would affect Ahmed's bat. I warming up to him now, and so I would like to see his batting progress. As far as our OF goes, I think we'll be fine keeping Tomas at 3B and rotate Peralta, Trumbo, Inciarte, and Pollock. We should maintain some depth in our IF and our OF. I'm not sure how or what the financial situation with our players, but I'd would say to Trumbo is our guy to trade."
azdiamondbacks,36lkik,kittypoop,1 point,Thu May 21 19:25:47 2015 UTC,"No, Lamb is just a 3B who can also play 1B, maybe LF but I don't think he has played there before.  Drury has been going between 3B and 2B though."
azdiamondbacks,36knln,SnakeBot,4,Wed May 20 02:11:19 2015 UTC,Burgos definitely has the stuff to be a closer. The control on the other hand....  Great team win today! Pollock POTG?
azdiamondbacks,36knln,go_dbacks,3,Wed May 20 02:13:34 2015 UTC,we won? holy fuk
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,SnakeBot,10,Tue May 19 21:15:40 2015 UTC,Remember when everyone said Tomas wouldn't be serviceable at third? I think he's more than satisfactory at the position.
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,GoldysMassiveArms,8,Tue May 19 23:39:03 2015 UTC,The amount he's improved is crazy
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,go_dbacks,9,Tue May 19 23:42:33 2015 UTC,"Patience and experience are proving to be key in his growth. He stabbed at a few grounders early on, but they didn't give up on him and the decision is really paying off since Lamb has been out."
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,GoldysMassiveArms,3,Tue May 19 23:44:13 2015 UTC,"It is almost unbelievable. Seriously, his hands look soft as hell. He doesn't have any range, but he's really holding his own."
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,ThisMachineKILLS,5,Wed May 20 00:10:17 2015 UTC,Kind of like how Tuffy wouldn't be feasible as a full-time catcher.
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,bp9801,1 point,Tue May 19 23:42:38 2015 UTC,"I mean, he has an OBP hovering around .250 and a wRC+ of 46. Not to mention a fWAR of -0.2. That really isn't a feasible full-time catcher, IMO."
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,Kelmon,1 point,Wed May 20 01:34:42 2015 UTC,"He looks better than he did in spring but he still doesn't belong there. When Lamb is back, there shouldn't ever really be a time when Tomás starts at third over him."
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,Kelmon,1 point,Wed May 20 01:36:30 2015 UTC,When a lefty is on the mound I think Tomas will start there quite often

azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,go_dbacks,4,Tue May 19 23:53:18 2015 UTC,No looks amazing there.
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,bbdv,5,Tue May 19 23:53:47 2015 UTC,It looks awesome with the roof and rolling windows open.
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,flaming_scepter,3,Tue May 19 23:58:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's a very nice looking park. Different, but that's a good thing."

azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,go_dbacks,7,Wed May 20 00:03:26 2015 UTC,So how many hits does Ahmed have swinging vs. bunting?
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,go_dbacks,3,Wed May 20 00:09:05 2015 UTC,Yeah maybe he should stick to bunting for awhile.
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,bbdv,6,Wed May 20 00:11:29 2015 UTC,Huddy just hit 98
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,ThisMachineKILLS,3,Wed May 20 01:15:13 2015 UTC,Damn!

azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,bp9801,4,Tue May 19 23:57:59 2015 UTC,I think it's safe to say exactly 0% of people expected him to perform like this
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,go_dbacks,3,Tue May 19 23:58:58 2015 UTC,"Probably the case. Always heard how he'd be a liability, but so far he's been damn good."

azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,go_dbacks,5,Wed May 20 00:07:53 2015 UTC,"Good starts by Hellickson are a double-edged sword  On one hand, it's nice that he's performing the way we want him to. On the other hand, it means that Jeremy Hellickson is almost certainly going to take a rotation spot from someone who deserves it more."
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,ThisMachineKILLS,5,Wed May 20 00:11:56 2015 UTC,Harper hit ANOTHER home run a little bit ago
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,go_dbacks,4,Wed May 20 00:19:50 2015 UTC,So now he has two tonight? Shit. Who pissed him off? Was it that underrated player thing?
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,bp9801,3,Wed May 20 00:21:06 2015 UTC,I think it's only one (so far) today. I have no idea but I'm glad that series is behind us
azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,go_dbacks,2,Wed May 20 00:22:08 2015 UTC,"OK, phew, Yeah, saw that he hit one, but didn't know if he got another. Next time against the Nats is in August, so hopefully Harper will have cooled off some by then."

azdiamondbacks,36jjeq,go_dbacks,2,Wed May 20 00:20:53 2015 UTC,"He has his moments out there. Better than I thought. If Goldy ever takes a day off, Trumbo would slot in just fine at first. Otherwise he's bit of the odd man out."
azdiamondbacks,36jy8c,go_dbacks,6,Tue May 19 22:59:37 2015 UTC,I'm curious what will happen with Tomás' playing time when Jake Lamb comes back. He's playing too well offensively to sit and his 3rd base defense isn't half bad either.
azdiamondbacks,36jy8c,Costigan,2,Wed May 20 02:16:33 2015 UTC,"It'll go down. Lamb needs to keep developing, and needs to keep getting consistent AB's.  The whole situation is a little weird. Tomas showed that he can in fact play 3rd base. The only time that we're gonna look at him as an option at 3rd over Lamb is vs the tough lefties, but Tomas has reverse splits, he hits right handers bettter than he hits lefties.   Hopefully it's just an anomaly, but it would certainly make me a lot happier if he hit lefties as well or better than righties."
azdiamondbacks,36jy8c,Antarix,0,Wed May 20 07:17:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to be rude or a dick or anything but your judgment of defense is not particularly great. Pacheco is far from a passable major league catcher and Tomás is not a major league third baseman.   However, depending on how long Lamb's rehab assignment is he could be ready by the end of it. Hopefully we can find a trade partner for Trumbo/Peralta or both. And open up LF/RF for Tomás/O'Brian."
azdiamondbacks,36jy8c,Darkstargir,1 point,Thu May 21 20:10:11 2015 UTC,"I'll concede on Pacheco, but idk what you're watching but with Tomas. Everything I've seen from Tomas at 3rd base has made me happy. He hasn't really made any overly spectacular plays, but he's made all the plays that he's needed to make and then some.   If he's gonna hit as well as he's hitting right now, and plays good enough defense, I'm more than fine with him playing 3rd."
azdiamondbacks,36jy8c,Antarix,1 point,Thu May 21 22:02:48 2015 UTC,If the power comes around his offense would easily offset his defense which would be fine with me. I'd prefer he not take playing time from Lamb though.

azdiamondbacks,36foo5,Antarix,4,Tue May 19 00:51:22 2015 UTC,ah patience  The words front offices use when they have no fucking clue what they are doing.  When we have only had 2 quality teams in a decade.
azdiamondbacks,36foo5,edtehgar,2,Tue May 19 01:28:58 2015 UTC,"Wat.  The FO's plan this offseason was, ""Save money, acquire young controllable pitchers"". The team is spending almost half the money they spent last year, and the only key pitcher that the D'backs picked up this off season that isn't have much success is Hellickson, but he was a low risk/high reward move, and he can be cut fairly easily to make room for one of the youngsters.  De La Rosa is proving that he can be a #2 type pitcher. Lopez is dominating in Mobile. Ray has been a strike out machine in Reno, and has shown he's at the very least a bullpen arm for the future. Zach Godley is looking unhittable in Visalia."
azdiamondbacks,36foo5,edtehgar,1 point,Tue May 19 02:39:05 2015 UTC,The Fo has been preaching patience since 2001.  Its old hat at this point.
azdiamondbacks,36foo5,edtehgar,2,Tue May 19 02:40:49 2015 UTC,"You're so wrong it hurts.... What did Kevin Towers do last year? Spent a boat load of money on a team with the mentality to ""Win Now"", not being patient, and we were the worst team in baseball and he was fired.  I feel like a lot of D'backs fans don't really get how the organization won the 2001 World Series. We bought it, plain and simple. There was literally 0 patience involved in the D'backs 2001 World Series team. Sure, it worked, but we were paying players money we didn't have to get a team that could compete for 2 years. So what happened in the long run? The team was $110mill in debt, and Colangelo was fired. Then when it came time to move on, Colangelo hadn't developed a real minor league system, so we had nothing coming up out of the minors to carry the torch.  Our fan base has been spoiled by the early success of the organization, and has demanded that we compete every year, and nothing else is acceptable. Since then, the FO has tried to spend money to buy a team that can win a championship, but never went all the way like Colangelo did, throwing fiscal responsibility to the wind. So the team has always been in limbo between being on the mend, and being a playoff contender, but never a World Series contender.   A lot of the time, things need to get worse for an organization before they can get better. Because ownership has never been able to bite the bullet, blow the whole thing up and rebuild the whole organization from the ground up, the organization has never had the chance to be built on a solid foundation. In the past when the D'backs have been successful, the organization has always been very top heavy, always ""Win now, because we've got nobody coming out of the minor for the future"".   La Russa did it in Oakland, he did it in St. Louis, and he'll do it here. He's built up organizations to develop players the right way, instead of going out and just buying them off of other teams. Notice how the Cardinals are ALWAYS in the playoffs? It's not because they say, ""Screw patience, trade all of our pieces, spend all our money to put together a team that will be prime to win for 2 years and then that's it!"" They always have good players coming up into a good team, and that's what is happening now."
azdiamondbacks,36foo5,edtehgar,1 point,Tue May 19 03:42:01 2015 UTC,"lets see.  We have been to the playoffs in 2007 and 2011.  Even in those years the FO were stressing ""Development"".  Thats how its always been.  SHit i even remember back around 2004 when the FO was trying to push ""Babybacks"" down our throats and how fast that fizzled when they had to rebuild again."

azdiamondbacks,36foo5,go_dbacks,1 point,Tue May 19 03:59:30 2015 UTC,I appreciate this analysis. Just thinking back to the trades Towers made in past years (shudder) after 2011. We went from worst to first and then the expectation was to keep moving forward and in return we lost many of our best pitching prospects for players that turned out to be junk.   I think patience is definitely an acceptable excuse. How many times this spring training and season have we not liked how supposed starting players were playing and then been surprised when the FO moved them or promoted a player that was doing better? So far they've got a good track record of making the right decisions. Lets see how this plays out.
azdiamondbacks,36g16d,SnakeBot,3,Tue May 19 02:35:23 2015 UTC,DLR clearly the player of the game here. Dude was absolutely dominant apart from one mistake.  Why was Boston so willing to get rid of this guy?

azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,go_dbacks,3,Mon May 18 23:29:41 2015 UTC,"Same here. Smoking the ball a bunch, one of the few bright spots in the offense lately."
azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,bp9801,3,Mon May 18 23:31:34 2015 UTC,Goldyumbo... Goldyasbo... Goldmanbo. Lot of options there.
azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,bp9801,3,Mon May 18 23:32:50 2015 UTC,"I wish the Fish made Ichi a player/manager. He'd be fitting for it, imo. Plus those shoes and that glove. Damn."

azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,go_dbacks,3,Mon May 18 23:36:06 2015 UTC,"Haren, Prado, Ichi, and/or Morse?"
azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,bp9801,4,Mon May 18 23:40:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Stanton too, at least when he's not mashing taters against us"
azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,go_dbacks,2,Mon May 18 23:42:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Stanton can absolutely crush the ball to all fields, so he's fantastic to watch. Just against other teams."

azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,bp9801,3,Mon May 18 23:39:49 2015 UTC,This game is flying
azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,go_dbacks,3,Mon May 18 23:46:18 2015 UTC,Not quite yet again for Ender.
azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,bp9801,3,Mon May 18 23:49:44 2015 UTC,"DAMMIT ENDER!  But seriously, we still love you."
azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,ellius,3,Mon May 18 23:50:03 2015 UTC,"Wait what TIL there's strategy behind batting lineup instead of just ""putting players that I feel like putting them.""  Quote from Wikipedia:   Although the third man up is generally the hitter with the highest batting average, cleanup hitters often have the most power on the team and are typically the team's best power hitter; their job is to ""clean up the bases"", hence the name.   How much more about baseball that I don't know about :o"

azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,ellius,3,Tue May 19 00:13:38 2015 UTC,So do we know what the plan will be for Yas when Lamb gets back? I feel like he's proved he can hit in the majors and don't want to see him sitting out too much.
azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,kronos22,3,Tue May 19 00:14:45 2015 UTC,I'm concerned about what Tomas playing well means for Lamb's future in AZ
azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,go_dbacks,2,Tue May 19 00:15:36 2015 UTC,"Hmm, good point. I hope they can figure out a way to keep them both in productive spots. Lamb looked extremely well before he got hurt"
azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,kronos22,2,Tue May 19 00:17:39 2015 UTC,"Lamb at third, Tomás in left, Ender/AJ in center, Trumbo in right. Or Lamb/Peralta in left and Tomás at third. Maybe even CO at short, Lamb at second, and Tomás at third, if/when Hill is traded and Ahmed's bat keeps missing the ball."
azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,bp9801,2,Tue May 19 00:21:13 2015 UTC,"Lamb should not be dealt at all. Play tomas in the outfield, or get him back to Reno to get back that power stroke until they hopefully sell high on Trumbo"
azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,TropangTexter,3,Tue May 19 02:28:21 2015 UTC,Someone will likely be moved.  Maybe Trumbo. Maybe Lamb. Maybe Peralta?
azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,ellius,3,Tue May 19 00:18:22 2015 UTC,Dusty sure loves to try and jinx us.

azdiamondbacks,36ewn1,go_dbacks,3,Tue May 19 00:50:21 2015 UTC,Rubby theoretically could pitch in the 10th. If he hadn't given up that homer that would have been the end of his Maddux

azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 00:32:19 2015 UTC,It's really sad. He's a grinder so to watch this happen just sucks. It's take him out back and shoot him bad. My dad was chatting it up about him today- this is the last year of a deal and he believes Utley will take the high road and retire before his option vests at 500PAs. I don't know...
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,sarahcasarah,1 point,Sun May 17 00:58:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I heard the numbers it was just like, ""wait, this is about Utley?"" Dude has been solid for years and it always seemed like no matter how the team was doing, Utley was his usual consistent self. You think he'll retire or stick it out a while longer?"
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 01:14:15 2015 UTC,"If he bounces back- I think he'll hang on. Why not? If not, I hope he retires. Actually- I hope he retires regardless. I was at the first on deck game at CBP when it opened the year he was called up. He's given us everything he's got! But... it's time."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,sarahcasarah,1 point,Sun May 17 01:20:44 2015 UTC,How long of a career has he had?
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 01:29:51 2015 UTC,2003 to now.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,sarahcasarah,2,Sun May 17 20:21:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm just pessimistic but I don't think so, maybe a small hot streak since everyone seems to be starting to click at the same time but I can't imagine it would be sustainable"
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,ASpal526,1 point,Sun May 17 00:24:48 2015 UTC,"Galvis is off to an incredible start, best of his career, I think. Herrera's looking better, from what I've seen during highlights and the like. Like you said, be hard to sustain everyone staying hot for a long period, but stranger things have happened."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 00:36:35 2015 UTC,"There have definitely been some bright spots and surprises so far. I know they're not going to have a great season record-wise, so I'd rather see some really enjoyable games and watch the young players develop regardless of the outcome."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,ASpal526,1 point,Sun May 17 00:44:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good way to look at it. Same for the D'backs, really. Nice to see Yas play a pretty decent third, Trumbo hits it about as hard as someone can, Ender looks good in the leadoff, Tuffy's a better catcher than people gave him credit for, and Goldy does his usual thing. CO is getting things together at the plate, AJ and Peralta can still rake and play some mean defense, and Ahmed can flash the leather. Hill is showing versatility for a good trade return, Penny too, and Pacheco is a solid backup to Tuffy.  Starters, for the most part, are good, and then there's the bullpen. Oh that bullpen. Maybe if/when Hill gets traded Stew can get a good reliever in return, or at least someone that can become a good reliever."

azdiamondbacks,367j2j,HolyCelestia,5,Sat May 16 23:58:07 2015 UTC,Let's have a good pitching day today Dbacks.. Looking at you bullpen
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,brandonatron,5,Sat May 16 23:10:11 2015 UTC,If we can avoid the bullpen all day I'll be happy.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,6,Sat May 16 23:11:16 2015 UTC,Ill hope for a perfect game.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,AzWiLdCaT1988,5,Sat May 16 23:12:13 2015 UTC,"I'll just hope for a complete game, lol."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,5,Sat May 16 23:13:39 2015 UTC,Or grab the lead and six good innings and then..... Rain forces to call it a game.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,brandonatron,4,Sat May 16 23:15:00 2015 UTC,"That would also be acceptable. Massive downpour during the Preakness, so if that wants to loop around and sneak its way a little north in about two hours, no complaints."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,5,Sat May 16 23:16:43 2015 UTC,This team has been so frustrating. They're so capable of being decent but they keep fucking it up
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,5,Sun May 17 00:11:44 2015 UTC,"The Arizona Diamondbacks are a paradox, I just decided."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,brandonatron,2,Sun May 17 00:33:30 2015 UTC,"They look fantastic in some games, but then forgot how to baseball in others."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,4,Sun May 17 00:41:29 2015 UTC,Archie Day is back.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,4,Sat May 16 22:45:23 2015 UTC,Something messed up with SnakeBot and the box score?
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sat May 16 23:00:34 2015 UTC,Yes...I'll try to figure out what's up
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,3,Sat May 16 23:01:06 2015 UTC,Maybe it's its way of rebelling from no TV broadcast yesterday.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,4,Sat May 16 23:02:17 2015 UTC,"Man, Herrera must give his hitting coach headaches"
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,2,Sat May 16 23:13:47 2015 UTC,"Missed it before, but wow that is a funky stance. Hands moving, legs as wide as possible, front foot tilted so it isn't even flat out on the ground."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,4,Sat May 16 23:45:07 2015 UTC,Looks like Archie's velocity has gone up (slightly) since his last start. He's sitting at 94 pretty consistently. Probably the result of rest but he may be returning to the velocity he had before his wrist injury (which sat at 95-96).
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,2,Sat May 16 23:21:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, could be a combo of the rest and working out some aggression."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sat May 16 23:28:55 2015 UTC,"i'm here guys, no worries we gone hit dongers now."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,adventurepony,3,Sat May 16 23:24:25 2015 UTC,Ugh rough return game for Archie
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,AzWiLdCaT1988,5,Sun May 17 00:09:42 2015 UTC,"First inning looked good, other than the control issue, but after that it seemed he was pressing."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,4,Sun May 17 00:12:24 2015 UTC,good thing this rain will only go for an hour max
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,kc3551,4,Sun May 17 00:11:57 2015 UTC,Seems like forever!!
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,AzWiLdCaT1988,4,Sun May 17 00:14:38 2015 UTC,I really like Chafin's mustache.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,ASpal526,4,Sun May 17 01:52:04 2015 UTC,"so Arizona's bullpen is pretty bad, and I watched the 2012 and 2013 Phillies"
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,kc3551,3,Sun May 17 02:18:41 2015 UTC,"Good idea by Ender, just pushed it a bit too far."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sat May 16 23:06:59 2015 UTC,That one was scary
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,AzWiLdCaT1988,3,Sat May 16 23:19:02 2015 UTC,AAAHHHHHCHIE
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bbdv,3,Sat May 16 23:21:52 2015 UTC,Tuffy's helmet has some water drops on it.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sat May 16 23:31:12 2015 UTC,Looks like its raining harder now.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,AzWiLdCaT1988,3,Sat May 16 23:35:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely. Bunch more ponchos were being put on as Ahmed's at-bat went on. Radar looks like a line of storms is just getting into Philly, same stuff that went through Baltimore about 90 minutes ago."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sat May 16 23:37:07 2015 UTC,I want to watch baseball dammit
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,2,Sat May 16 23:38:18 2015 UTC,Just have radio?
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sat May 16 23:38:49 2015 UTC,No it just sounds like there might be delays incoming
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,2,Sat May 16 23:55:43 2015 UTC,"Aha, yeah, certainly. If there are, give me time to work on dinner, lol."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sun May 17 00:05:02 2015 UTC,"Ender was running for ages, but Trumbo had it all the way."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sat May 16 23:38:11 2015 UTC,trumbo seemed a bit pissed about it too
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,adventurepony,3,Sat May 16 23:40:48 2015 UTC,"Yup, looked like he called it, but Ender took it instead. Trumbo seemed to frown."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sat May 16 23:41:44 2015 UTC,Fuck.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sat May 16 23:40:45 2015 UTC,Dammit Ahmed x2.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sat May 16 23:43:24 2015 UTC,Herrera swings like Domingo Ayala
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,3,Sat May 16 23:45:23 2015 UTC,Uhhhhhh what just happened
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,AzWiLdCaT1988,3,Sat May 16 23:45:27 2015 UTC,"Sandberg wanted to argue the ball hit Herrera's foot, but that play isn't reviewable"
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,2,Sat May 16 23:46:45 2015 UTC,"Batter tried to sell the ball hitting his foot, home plate umpire called it foul, but was overruled."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sat May 16 23:48:03 2015 UTC,"Kind of looks like Archie is working a bit too hard/fast, maybe flying open early."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sun May 17 00:07:58 2015 UTC,Chase gets a hit!
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,kc3551,3,Sun May 17 00:08:42 2015 UTC,Come on rain
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,3,Sun May 17 00:08:48 2015 UTC,"Not a good night for Bradley, surprisingly. I thought he'd fuck with us big time."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,Jayyburdd,2,Sun May 17 00:09:35 2015 UTC,Now you guys get to face the bullpen... pleasedon'thurtus.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sun May 17 00:13:35 2015 UTC,I don't know. Rarely are we not on the receiving end of this.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,Jayyburdd,1 point,Sun May 17 01:09:35 2015 UTC,It's been like this every so often with the D'backs this year.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sun May 17 01:14:47 2015 UTC,Stupid RAIN!!
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,AzWiLdCaT1988,3,Sun May 17 00:11:40 2015 UTC,"Well, there's the delay. Too bad it couldn't come before Archie was taken out, but I think he'd be done either way if it's a long delay. Hopefully it's short."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sun May 17 00:11:50 2015 UTC,Phillies and DBacks twitter playing rock-paper-scissors
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,kc3551,3,Sun May 17 00:27:48 2015 UTC,I'm interested to see how this works...there's no way they'll be able to go at the exact same time
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,ASpal526,2,Sun May 17 00:33:28 2015 UTC,Haha! That is sweet.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sun May 17 00:40:29 2015 UTC,"Alright, you guys took the rock-paper-scissors, we'll take the game"
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,ASpal526,4,Sun May 17 00:49:13 2015 UTC,I don't remember agreeing to that.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sun May 17 00:52:43 2015 UTC,anyword on a restart?
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,adventurepony,2,Sun May 17 00:59:48 2015 UTC,"Dback's twitter posted a video of the groundscrew getting the water off the tarp so it shouldn't be too much longer  Edit: ""Tarp is off the field. Estimated start is 9:30"" -@Phillies"
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,ASpal526,3,Sun May 17 01:07:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry just got out of bed, what did I miss?"
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,HolyCelestia,1 point,Sun May 17 01:00:30 2015 UTC,"Just a rain delay so far. Archie got hit around, was taken out, then tarp went on the field."

azdiamondbacks,367j2j,Jayyburdd,3,Sun May 17 01:27:55 2015 UTC,"If Ahmed's glove starts to mimic his bat, what then?"
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,3,Sun May 17 01:42:59 2015 UTC,bagging groceries fast but unpredictably

azdiamondbacks,367j2j,giantjensen,3,Sun May 17 02:02:42 2015 UTC,mind giving the runs right back to us again?
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,kc3551,3,Sun May 17 02:34:12 2015 UTC,Ehhh I'd rather not. We need all the help we can get
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,3,Sun May 17 02:36:30 2015 UTC,Utley is probably the only below .150 hitter to ever get IBB'd twice

azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 02:58:51 2015 UTC,I think that's his first 1-2-3 inning of the season
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,kc3551,1 point,Sun May 17 03:00:26 2015 UTC,Not great otherwise?
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 03:12:09 2015 UTC,according to his gamelog he only pitched one 1-2-3 inning in 15 appearances

azdiamondbacks,367j2j,ellius,3,Sun May 17 03:14:56 2015 UTC,Finallyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy! It didn't even look that good of a hit
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,giantjensen,3,Sun May 17 03:15:20 2015 UTC,Oh shit I completely forgot about the TACOS
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,3,Sun May 17 03:17:44 2015 UTC,An inning away from winning a series against the Nats to losing one to the Phillies. This week sucks
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,Electric_Warrior_,2,Sun May 17 03:37:05 2015 UTC,Got that right.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 03:39:49 2015 UTC,"Not a great throw by Tuffy, but maybe the backswing got in the way."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sat May 16 23:17:46 2015 UTC,So cloooose! Gah. It's going to happen eventually guys
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,2,Sat May 16 23:27:08 2015 UTC,Awww man almost his first
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,AzWiLdCaT1988,2,Sat May 16 23:27:08 2015 UTC,Yas almost had that one. Damn.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sat May 16 23:27:46 2015 UTC,"Just a few more reps at the gym, Yas.  >.<"
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,ellius,2,Sat May 16 23:28:32 2015 UTC,Dammit Ahmed.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sat May 16 23:34:59 2015 UTC,"Phew. Almost same spot, but this time Ender took it."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sat May 16 23:40:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't see the ball hit his foot. He's out, inning over."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sat May 16 23:45:23 2015 UTC,At least the ball didn't go out.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 00:04:36 2015 UTC,"Oh, Rusty."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,ellius,2,Sun May 17 00:04:51 2015 UTC,Oh..  oh good. It's back and now 4-0.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 01:29:27 2015 UTC,Oh Ender. So slick out there.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 01:30:09 2015 UTC,Keep it at 4-0 and we can come back!
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,giantjensen,2,Sun May 17 01:30:33 2015 UTC,"bases loaded, no one out, I don't think it could have gone any better"

azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 01:38:35 2015 UTC,Damn...
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 01:39:00 2015 UTC,someone wanna explain that
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,kc3551,2,Sun May 17 01:42:47 2015 UTC,Leave it to the diamondbacks to get killed by fucking Chase Utley
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,2,Sun May 17 02:12:18 2015 UTC,So... Getting swept by the Phillies is a possibility
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,2,Sun May 17 02:17:28 2015 UTC,"Alright, bullpen. Way to be depressing"
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,Electric_Warrior_,2,Sun May 17 02:19:23 2015 UTC,The Bank is a double farm whenever guys hit a ball past first base.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,Jayyburdd,2,Sun May 17 02:19:35 2015 UTC,Odubel's hitting regressed damn quickly
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,kc3551,2,Sun May 17 02:21:49 2015 UTC,And now Addison Reed! I guess we gave up
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,2,Sun May 17 02:22:06 2015 UTC,"This is one of those games, it seems. A runfest."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,Jayyburdd,2,Sun May 17 02:38:45 2015 UTC,took De Fratus long enough to realize his slider isn't working
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,kc3551,2,Sun May 17 02:38:58 2015 UTC,"Different inning, same Reed."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 02:42:16 2015 UTC,"Oh Addison, never change"
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,2,Sun May 17 02:42:59 2015 UTC,"Ouch, right in the shoulder."
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 02:51:00 2015 UTC,Nice to see Reed not give up a run.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 02:54:29 2015 UTC,Did the Phanatic mess around with the players before the game?
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,HolyCelestia,2,Sun May 17 03:02:35 2015 UTC,Speaking of a pitcher's first 1-2-3 inning... wtf just happened
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,go_dbacks,1 point,Sun May 17 03:07:34 2015 UTC,It scares me.
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 03:11:26 2015 UTC,by far the best outing by Diekman this season
azdiamondbacks,367j2j,kc3551,2,Sun May 17 03:10:40 2015 UTC,Ziggy gonna Zig!

azdiamondbacks,367j2j,bp9801,2,Sun May 17 03:33:39 2015 UTC,Welp... damn.
azdiamondbacks,363ryy,ThisMachineKILLS,12,Fri May 15 21:32:51 2015 UTC,Best news I've heard in two seasons!!
azdiamondbacks,363ryy,BransonAllen,11,Fri May 15 21:49:36 2015 UTC,"At least he's taking this all in stride. He said the other day when asked about the bad calls that He has to have move consistent control if he's gonna be upset about not getting close calls. Then today he said he knows he hasn't been throwing the ball well, and understands the need for a change."

azdiamondbacks,364mck,TropangTexter,4,Sat May 16 02:43:51 2015 UTC,"Well that was a tough loss.  This team feels like it should be above .500.  Still, i'm very confident in a decent season."
azdiamondbacks,364mck,Freyja_God,2,Sat May 16 03:31:36 2015 UTC,Jeff Francoeur?  The fuck is this.
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,SnakeBot,6,Fri May 15 21:09:58 2015 UTC,Day after an off day and the game is not on TV? Fucking cruel
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,thekeymaker,4,Fri May 15 23:13:31 2015 UTC,I don't really like having to listen the Phillies's broadcast. But I guess I have no choice. Let's go Snakes!
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,abryant0462,5,Sat May 16 00:04:47 2015 UTC,"only one run was scored, I am surprised!"

azdiamondbacks,363pbu,thekeymaker,2,Fri May 15 23:16:11 2015 UTC,Not without the flux capacitor it's not.
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,bp9801,3,Fri May 15 23:22:13 2015 UTC,"which is more likely: cubs win WS this year, or we get our hoverboards?"
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,thekeymaker,2,Fri May 15 23:24:32 2015 UTC,"I can't ever root for the Cubs to do anything good, so I'm going with hoverboards. I grew up in central Illinois and the Cardinals will always be my first team. The rivalry between Cards and Cubs can improve and that'll be fine, but that's about as far as I want the Cubs to go.  Hoverboards will be far more useful than listening to Cubs fans go on and on about a WS win."
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,bp9801,2,Fri May 15 23:30:53 2015 UTC,I now have a slight soft spot for the Cubs since Kris Bryant was a classmate and acquaintance in college.
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,thekeymaker,2,Fri May 15 23:41:04 2015 UTC,He seems like a nice guy and I wish him a long and fulfilling career. Just I can't like the Cubs.
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,bp9801,2,Fri May 15 23:46:11 2015 UTC,Understandable
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,thekeymaker,3,Fri May 15 23:47:19 2015 UTC,"2 game threads, a combined 31 comments! Wowww, that's so little."
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,giantjensen,3,Sat May 16 00:28:56 2015 UTC,Well I just barely got off work...

azdiamondbacks,363pbu,bp9801,3,Sat May 16 01:05:54 2015 UTC,Can someone unpack the offense? Must still be on the plane.
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,brandonatron,3,Sat May 16 00:47:08 2015 UTC,don't know why Chafin isn't already in

azdiamondbacks,363pbu,thekeymaker,3,Sat May 16 00:55:47 2015 UTC,Epic pitching by Anderson... Shame offense can't support him.
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,brandonatron,3,Sat May 16 00:58:30 2015 UTC,I'm liking everything he offers. Just the offense is still inconsistent.
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,bp9801,3,Sat May 16 01:07:19 2015 UTC,"I think Goldy had a chance on that Howard double, hard to tell from the stream on my phone."
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,brandonatron,3,Sat May 16 01:00:24 2015 UTC,I just have the radio stream to go off of. Don't trust my Internet speeds right now to handle anything more.

azdiamondbacks,363pbu,bp9801,3,Sat May 16 01:10:10 2015 UTC,Let's get that run back DBacks!!  Edit: nice
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,brandonatron,3,Sat May 16 01:12:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, tie game!"

azdiamondbacks,363pbu,thekeymaker,2,Sat May 16 02:11:34 2015 UTC,I think that's what they call a solid bullpen arm. Maybe. Not sure.
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,bp9801,2,Sat May 16 02:13:57 2015 UTC,Was any reason given for why this game isn't on Fox Sports Arizona? And the same for Wednesday's finale against the Nats?
azdiamondbacks,363pbu,bp9801,3,Fri May 15 21:45:57 2015 UTC,"They said they were having those days off, and there wouldn't be a tv broadcast"

azdiamondbacks,363pbu,brandonatron,1 point,Sat May 16 02:14:23 2015 UTC,"If the bullpen can keep it where it is going into the 9th, we'll have the bottom part of the order and then it turns over. Hope for something good there, maybe the bottom can finally wake up."

azdiamondbacks,36417k,DobbyD43,3,Fri May 15 22:55:29 2015 UTC,I would have suggested MLB TV but since that isn't an option I'd go with 620 AM. Audio is better than nothing!
azdiamondbacks,36417k,joecb91,1 point,Fri May 15 22:59:11 2015 UTC,Tor browser and MLBtv. You will be able to watch the Philly feed that way.
azdiamondbacks,361a8k,lawlocopter,2,Fri May 15 06:40:47 2015 UTC,We won tonight! Woohoo!
azdiamondbacks,35zy2f,joecb91,3,Thu May 14 22:42:36 2015 UTC,Who would have thought trading for a mediocre fly ball pitcher to close in the 2nd most homer friendly park would be a bad idea?
azdiamondbacks,35zy2f,Kelmon,4,Thu May 14 23:56:23 2015 UTC,%48 of AZSnakePit readers apparently.
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,DontForgetThisTime,20,Wed May 13 23:27:09 2015 UTC,I'd rather get Matt Davidson back from the White Sox and make him our fucking closer.
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,joecb91,9,Wed May 13 23:48:09 2015 UTC,"Why not go with that kid Burgos! Sure, he's pretty green and had a shitty time around in that one game, but he's been unstoppable in most games I've watched him in!"
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,lawlocopter,13,Thu May 14 02:20:13 2015 UTC,Fly ball pitcher in a hitters ball park
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,wampaman,7,Wed May 13 23:45:18 2015 UTC,"It's not even that. He's throwing low-mid 90's fastballs, and flat sliders. It's not that his stuff doesn't play well in Arizona, it's just that his stuff is bad..."
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,Antarix,2,Thu May 14 09:27:50 2015 UTC,"Making it even worse, his fastball is flat too."
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,joecb91,1 point,Thu May 14 22:45:43 2015 UTC,Well even since his days in Chicago Addison has always had an above average HR/FB ratio.  And it's only gotten worse with the dbacks.  He was disastrous at home last season with a 16.2%.  He's just not a good fit.
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,wampaman,2,Fri May 15 23:55:50 2015 UTC,"That's one of the reasons I'm so high on Jake Barrett. 16 innings in Reno, with a 1.13 ERA, and 0 Home runs surrendered.   If you can do that in Reno, you've got something good."
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,Antarix,14,Sat May 16 00:05:51 2015 UTC,"For an early game, it wasn't that bad. Up and down score made it interesting. Couple bad calls were made by the ump.  Kinda a bummer that we took a L  Reed isn't that bad Except for today, and  Every other time he gets called up. Dude is done."
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,kittypoop,3,Thu May 14 00:20:04 2015 UTC,"I was at the game today, goldy almost getting the cycle and every player was contributing offensively you can tell we really wanted that win today! Then the infamous ""add a run"" reed comes in and fucks the whole team over"
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,Dhardie29,11,Thu May 14 07:22:39 2015 UTC,"Let's get out the pitchforks!   But seriously, who would you guys move to the closer role?   Sure could use a healthy David Hernandez about now."
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,equipped_metalblade,17,Wed May 13 23:36:52 2015 UTC,Brad Ziegler
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,thekeymaker,5,Wed May 13 23:42:56 2015 UTC,"We're now in the fourth year of Ziegler being the correct answer. I thought the resistance to use him as a closer would end with the departure of Gibson, but the re-signing of Reed in the offseason sure proved me wrong quickly.  One of these days a smart franchise is going to pay Ziegler lots of money to be lights out closing games..."
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,turdcraply,8,Thu May 14 01:55:46 2015 UTC,"Mark Grace did better when he came in to close. Hudson is good to go and I've been impressed with Nuno. If I remember correct, Chafin has had 1 bad outing but still didn't blow the win. Reed is so damn inconsistent and his mistakes HURT. It's never giving up a hr then 3 outs, it's 2-3 walks then the homer. Same shit as last year"
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,sprawk,7,Wed May 13 23:45:14 2015 UTC,"Putting Hudson in would be a waste of his stamina. Ziegler is my favorite for the slot right now. Reed definitely needs to go. I remember last year they used to flicker the lights, and show his picture with flames going all over the stadium to hype people up when he came in. Thankfully they've stopped that. Probably too many jokes about him going up in flames every start."
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,Costigan,6,Thu May 14 00:29:21 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Might as well get Clint Robinson in there to close.   Nuno might be a decent option, though he's had issues with home runs and that's not something that should be taken lightly when considering him for closer. I would have suggested Delgado, but he hasn't done much better as of late. At this point, it might be best to just stick with Ziegler until he's officially usurped."
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,Howie_85Sabre,3,Wed May 13 23:49:27 2015 UTC,"Huddy as a closer would be tops, and it'd be easier on his arm."
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,joecb91,5,Thu May 14 02:42:57 2015 UTC,"Trumbo and Peralta were originally pitchers, so they can't be any worse."
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,joecb91,10,Thu May 14 00:22:06 2015 UTC,Chip is cautioning us against rushing to judgement over Reed.  Because 70+ games along with what he did in Chicago isn't enough for us to know he sucks
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,jlopez24,11,Thu May 14 00:51:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't like that tweet. It's making it seem like we ""all of a sudden"" don't want him as our closer after this game. Chip we've had these feelings for a while."

azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,filippo_b,8,Thu May 14 18:03:18 2015 UTC,You read my mind. I hate his fucking guts and his sweaty ass anxious body.
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,GoldysMassiveArms,11,Wed May 13 23:30:52 2015 UTC,even he makes himself nervous when he goes in.
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,ThisMachineKILLS,9,Thu May 14 00:09:11 2015 UTC,We should have like 3 more wins than we do if not for the terrible bullpen
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,wingnut5k,7,Wed May 13 23:31:06 2015 UTC,Can we have Nick Ahmed pitch? Probably would have thrown more strikes.
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,bp9801,8,Thu May 14 00:23:49 2015 UTC,"Fuck Kevin Towers.  I don't care how good he's been before, but right now he is flat out atrocious. Send him down to Reno or Mobile until he gets his head figured out. Failing that, they should ship out Reed for anyone a team is willing to give up, or just DFA him and hope for the best."
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,TropangTexter,7,Thu May 14 03:31:11 2015 UTC,"I think there are a lot of things to like about this team right now and moving forward. The cornerstones for the  next contending Dbacks team are on the team now, and the team has played better than everyone has expected and will only get better.  But..  How long more will the team be comfortable with telling themselves that Addison Reed is the best option to close out games for the Diamondbacks? How much more can the team, not to mention the players and also the fans, take of this garbage? In a one run game, you bring in a guy with a shot confidence and a guy who has proven to be unreliable to close games in his one and a quarter seasons on the team?  Good lord."
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,lawlocopter,4,Thu May 14 05:00:15 2015 UTC,"💯 totally agree goldy and Archie are gonna be nice, Tomas is hitting the ball well ( though not the expected power) and tuffy is fitting better than Montero. I'm hoping Reed is on the trade block; he could be a good reliever where he won't have as much pressure to close. Besides, based on KTs previous trades, he'll start killing it once he's on a new team."
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,brandonatron,2,Thu May 14 07:06:13 2015 UTC,"You're totally right. When the line-up is hitting well, they're untouchable. If Pollock, Peralta and Tomas can really start to shine through and Ender can get back to what he was doing at the beginning of the season then the Dbacks are going to be scary good! Not to mention once Jake Lamb comes back from injury? I get excited thinking about how exciting this team can/will be."
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,UAChemist,5,Fri May 15 06:37:06 2015 UTC,Nothing left to say about this guy that hasn't been said already...
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,GoldysMassiveArms,6,Wed May 13 23:45:13 2015 UTC,Man Reed is pathetic. Can't wait to see him gone. He been so bad since he joined our club.

azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,lawlocopter,6,Thu May 14 00:31:29 2015 UTC,We have the worst blown save percentage in baseball.
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,TropangTexter,10,Thu May 14 19:10:16 2015 UTC,"Reed has got to be one of my least favorite Dbacks players ever. Just as we were about to get an incredible come from behind series win, he goes and does what he always does. I'm so tired of this guy blowing games and wish we would just DFA him. If Chip doesn't change closers, I will have lost all faith with him and this regime. Time to cut the left over KT gristle."
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,amperx11,8,Thu May 14 01:48:50 2015 UTC,I'm not sure... It's a tie between him and Chad Qualls. God damn the Dbacks know how to find closers who love blowing games.
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,joecb91,6,Thu May 14 05:51:20 2015 UTC,don't forget big Jon Rauch!!!!
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,joecb91,4,Thu May 14 06:31:53 2015 UTC,"So glad I didn't watch this game, I can't stand Reed and I don't see why Hale doesn't see how terrible he is."
azdiamondbacks,35vxwl,DavSox,4,Thu May 14 15:43:43 2015 UTC,"www.azsnakepit.com/2015/5/14/8604643/dear-chip-hale-the-only-addision-reed-stat-youll-ever-need   Addision Reed has allowed at least 1 run or more 28 times in 73 appearances since joining the D Backs.  That is the most by any reliever in major league baseball dating back to beginning of 2014. This despite the fact that his 73 appearances rank about 90th in MLB dating back to last year. He's allowed a run in 38% of the games he's appeared the last 1+ season, and in 2015 he's 5 for 11, or 46%  Simply put, 4 out of 10 times you put Addision Reed in the game he is going to allow at least 1 run. There are no other guys in the closer role with even remotely this high a percentage over a sustained period of time."
azdiamondbacks,35xpoo,Raptor231408,4,Thu May 14 11:44:18 2015 UTC,"This is true for quite a few MLB teams. With the exception of closers most bullpen guys are aspiring rotation guys that never panned out, or young guys working out things until they actually can get into the rotation.  The bullpen is a crap shoot. I'm not saying it's not frustrating as hell, but I can only think of three or four teams that have stellar bullpens."
azdiamondbacks,35xpoo,HometownJuke,2,Thu May 14 16:30:49 2015 UTC,"If someone has to be blamed, why not the people who assembled the bullpen?"
azdiamondbacks,35xpoo,Kelmon,1 point,Fri May 15 00:33:11 2015 UTC,Relievers are a volatile thing.  Unfortunately Reed is one of the relievers who always has you worried that he is going to blow up or at least give up a run or two before he gets the 3 outs.
azdiamondbacks,35vy57,SnakeBot,9,Wed May 13 23:29:25 2015 UTC,"Thought you guys had this one.   And don't tell the folks over at /r/Nationals, but I really like Goldschmidt.    See y'all in August!"
azdiamondbacks,35vy57,Mispelling,4,Thu May 14 00:39:03 2015 UTC,See you then! Hopefully we don't have Reed then so it will be a fair matchup. Good luck the rest of the year!!! Rooting for you guys to win your division.
azdiamondbacks,35vy57,jb420phx,8,Thu May 14 01:52:03 2015 UTC,"If the Diamondbacks just straight DFA’d Addison Reed, it still wouldn’t be enough to satiate how much I can’t stand him."
azdiamondbacks,35vy57,Costigan,8,Wed May 13 23:30:48 2015 UTC,Addison Reed can eat a bag of dicks.
azdiamondbacks,35vy57,thekeymaker,5,Wed May 13 23:31:21 2015 UTC,Reed is going to wake up with a severed rattlesnake head in his bed.

azdiamondbacks,35upkd,thekeymaker,9,Wed May 13 23:02:07 2015 UTC,I never ever want to see Addison Reed pitch in a Diamondback jersey ever again. Never ever again .

azdiamondbacks,35upkd,Electric_Warrior_,2,Wed May 13 23:13:11 2015 UTC,I don't know what you have to do to get fired as a closer with the Dbacks.  But this guy is pathetic.  Is Byung-Hyun Kim available?

azdiamondbacks,35urh4,Freddy_Bimmel,3,Wed May 13 18:01:37 2015 UTC,Looking at the transaction list it looks like he got sent down almost a week ago. I missed it too
azdiamondbacks,35urh4,go_dbacks,3,Wed May 13 18:07:17 2015 UTC,He was only brought up for the double header. You are allowed a 26th roster spot for that.
azdiamondbacks,35urh4,cheerbacks,2,Wed May 13 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"Learned something new, thanks"
azdiamondbacks,35urh4,Charlottemaybe1,2,Wed May 13 19:41:48 2015 UTC,"Here's the story. Ray was suppose to take the two starts that Bradley missed. The first of them, was the 2nd game in Colorado that got rained out, and cause the subsequent double header. When you play a double header, both teams are allowed a 26th man on their roster, to sort of lighten the load. Ray was the 26th man, so he got added for the 2nd game of the double header, then moved right back to Reno, to avoid the 10 day waiting period between when you can call up and send down a player under normal circumstances.  TL;DR Bradley got injured, called up Burgos in the mean time to give the bullpen some depth until a start was gonna be needed 4 days after Bradleys start. 2 games in Colorado get rained out, Ray is added as 26th man to start and immediately sent down, and the 2nd start that Ray was suppose to have was just given to the bullpen."

azdiamondbacks,35sq5q,edtehgar,1 point,Wed May 13 05:12:49 2015 UTC,I think the total runs after this series should determine a sweep for respective teams
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,SnakeBot,12,Tue May 12 23:42:54 2015 UTC,"Trumbo has looked like a different player this year, in a good way!"
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,10,Wed May 13 03:12:14 2015 UTC,He looks like he has a much more athletic body. I can get used to this Trumbo!
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,xSaintJimmy,9,Wed May 13 03:14:28 2015 UTC,Defensively he's been quite good out there.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,8,Wed May 13 03:14:36 2015 UTC,I'm gonna give some credit to Gracie.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,ellius,12,Wed May 13 03:15:03 2015 UTC,"That, my friends, is the very definition of a Trumbomb"
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,ThisMachineKILLS,11,Wed May 13 03:06:43 2015 UTC,I prefer tonight's game to last nights game.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,swiftkeeks,11,Wed May 13 03:08:20 2015 UTC,As someone who has 5 brothers in law that all root for Washington DC sports -this feels SOOOO much better after yesterday.  Can't shit talk anymore can ya brah!!
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Freyja_God,5,Wed May 13 03:11:56 2015 UTC,"Oh they'll talk shit, but you can fire back now. Also, remind them how good our first baseman is :P"
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,TheAviator4,3,Wed May 13 03:19:58 2015 UTC,Football season must have some good moments.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,2,Wed May 13 03:20:28 2015 UTC,"Just for football - the most boisterous root for the Panthers unfortunately... Last year sucked.  Ugh, Lindley...."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Freyja_God,2,Wed May 13 03:21:46 2015 UTC,Well that stinks.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,2,Wed May 13 03:23:56 2015 UTC,Yup!
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Freyja_God,10,Wed May 13 03:24:36 2015 UTC,Idk why the heck you would ever int walk Ahmed haha. Most pitchers have a better average.  Thanks Matt Williams.  Edit:  WOOOO yup.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Freyja_God,7,Wed May 13 03:27:28 2015 UTC,He might as well be a second pitcher haha
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,9,Wed May 13 03:28:25 2015 UTC,you know what they say about payback - she's not very nice   Steve
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Freyja_God,9,Wed May 13 03:54:55 2015 UTC,Fun fact: Addison Reed closed for Stephen Strasburg in college
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,9,Wed May 13 01:47:31 2015 UTC,WE BE DROPPIN TRUMBOMBS ON THESE NATS.  Mark's hotter than Nagasaki
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Freyja_God,8,Wed May 13 03:44:29 2015 UTC,I like your commentators. They're poking fun at some of our players (calling Stras a diva) but they are overall entertaining.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,CornDoggyStyle,6,Wed May 13 02:51:08 2015 UTC,They're also doing a sort of defensive special today which I'm enjoying
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,6,Wed May 13 02:56:22 2015 UTC,"Same here. BB and Bert are great, especially BB with how he explains a lot of things in easy to understand terms."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,2,Wed May 13 02:59:07 2015 UTC,It's awesome how much BB knows about the game and how much he makes you think. He really makes the game a lot more enjoyable to watch.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,jlopez24,1 point,Wed May 13 07:29:47 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, totally. He breaks it down so well and doesn't overcomplicate things with the description/explanation."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,4,Wed May 13 17:04:48 2015 UTC,They do that to a lot of guys.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,1 point,Wed May 13 02:59:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they make a great combo."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,cardinals1996,7,Wed May 13 04:17:56 2015 UTC,TRUMBOOOOOOMB
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,7,Wed May 13 03:06:28 2015 UTC,Dat Gonzo smile.  Legend.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Freyja_God,7,Wed May 13 03:19:19 2015 UTC,Ahhhhhh yeah!
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Delta_V,6,Wed May 13 01:58:22 2015 UTC,TUFFY TACOS
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,7,Wed May 13 03:05:21 2015 UTC,This inning is great
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,amperx11,8,Wed May 13 03:08:50 2015 UTC,This game is so good that _____
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,TropangTexter,8,Wed May 13 04:02:54 2015 UTC,I almost forgot about yesterday
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,4,Wed May 13 04:03:56 2015 UTC,I'll be getting worse grades on my finals tomorrow
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,xSaintJimmy,8,Wed May 13 04:16:12 2015 UTC,The Inning of the Loud Flyouts
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,0,Wed May 13 04:11:16 2015 UTC,And bad at bats.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Freyja_God,5,Wed May 13 04:13:22 2015 UTC,TRUMBOMB CALLED BY GONZO!
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,5,Wed May 13 03:06:03 2015 UTC,YeSSsSSsSSSSSSS
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Delta_V,6,Wed May 13 03:06:30 2015 UTC,Get a taste of your own medicine Nats!
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,xSaintJimmy,5,Wed May 13 03:06:43 2015 UTC,good lord that ball was smoked
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,thekeymaker,6,Wed May 13 03:08:02 2015 UTC,Still a small sample size but the Miley for de la Rosa/Webster deal is starting to look like a steal for us
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,5,Wed May 13 03:18:30 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call it a steal yet but it looks quite good.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,cheerbacks,2,Wed May 13 03:19:11 2015 UTC,Rubby has so much potential. Hopefully he can reach it.   He's certainly shown flashes of brilliance.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,ellius,5,Wed May 13 03:21:00 2015 UTC,This feels so good after last night
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Delta_V,7,Wed May 13 03:23:54 2015 UTC,Getting that run differential back
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,ThisMachineKILLS,5,Wed May 13 03:27:59 2015 UTC,Rubby Tuesday... I'll take it Dusty
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,brandonatron,6,Wed May 13 03:29:14 2015 UTC,Can't watch tonight but looks like on hell of a game from the boxscore
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,mind_elevated,7,Wed May 13 03:31:59 2015 UTC,...how did he do that? Not a home run pitch or swing at all
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,6,Wed May 13 03:36:21 2015 UTC,"That's what they call ""country strong."""
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,5,Wed May 13 03:38:07 2015 UTC,He plays in 0 elevation super humidity pretty much all division and at home - now Haper is heating up and in the 2nd highest stadium with no moisture.  Kid's gonna smash this series.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Freyja_God,5,Wed May 13 03:39:11 2015 UTC,TRUMVP
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,6,Wed May 13 03:43:14 2015 UTC,So... Trumbo DID hit a home run after Ender's sac fly
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,xSaintJimmy,5,Wed May 13 03:43:40 2015 UTC,Hahaha love the Green mic
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,6,Wed May 13 04:00:13 2015 UTC,BULLSHIT!  Goldy leads the league in FOREARMS.  Uggla is a forearm scrub relatively.  Blasphemy I say!!
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Freyja_God,7,Wed May 13 04:04:08 2015 UTC,Who else remembers the time Tuffy struck out twice in the same inning to a postition player pitching?
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,5,Wed May 13 04:22:46 2015 UTC,I thought we weren't supposed to talk about that
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,brandonatron,5,Wed May 13 04:25:23 2015 UTC,Offense!
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,4,Wed May 13 01:58:24 2015 UTC,A A RON  Never change <3
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,4,Wed May 13 01:58:25 2015 UTC,"Ouch, hope he's alright"
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Delta_V,4,Wed May 13 02:15:13 2015 UTC,Even with the mask that looked really painful
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,3,Wed May 13 02:15:45 2015 UTC,"Concussion, probably. If not, one hell of a headache."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,5,Wed May 13 02:22:40 2015 UTC,What happened to the ump? They aren't showing the replay at the stadium
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,cakelorldeath,5,Wed May 13 02:16:40 2015 UTC,Ahmed fouled the ball off and it hit the ump's mask squarely
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,4,Wed May 13 02:17:34 2015 UTC,Yeesh
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,cakelorldeath,4,Wed May 13 02:27:51 2015 UTC,Deflection to the mask and physics destroyed him
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,brandonatron,5,Wed May 13 02:18:06 2015 UTC,Seeing the Ahmed cam makes me wish I was watching a POV angle Nick was seeing.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,brandonatron,6,Wed May 13 02:32:25 2015 UTC,ENDER CAN DO IT ALL
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,4,Wed May 13 02:39:32 2015 UTC,One of these days Ahmed is going to go on a hitting streak
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,giantjensen,3,Wed May 13 02:59:24 2015 UTC,Hopefully soon.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,6,Wed May 13 03:01:18 2015 UTC,"I kinda see what Bert and Dusty were saying, Stras is really rattled out  there  Rattled...for a team whose namesake is a rattlesnake we don't use that often enough"
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,5,Wed May 13 03:02:15 2015 UTC,Nice sac fly by Ender.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,5,Wed May 13 03:05:12 2015 UTC,"Tacos, bitches!"
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,ellius,5,Wed May 13 03:05:20 2015 UTC,Buh bye
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,ellius,5,Wed May 13 03:05:58 2015 UTC,Nice to have the opposing team's pitcher leave early.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,5,Wed May 13 03:09:58 2015 UTC,"For a second I thought Peralta hurt himself, but guess he just tripped."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,5,Wed May 13 03:11:47 2015 UTC,That's kind of a neat shirt.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,ellius,2,Wed May 13 03:18:15 2015 UTC,"Would love to get one, but don't think I'd be able to make it in for the giveaway."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,5,Wed May 13 03:21:30 2015 UTC,"Rubby's looking quite sharp. Some hiccups, but not letting it get to him."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,5,Wed May 13 03:18:32 2015 UTC,These chicken wings are HEATING UP
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,6,Wed May 13 03:23:14 2015 UTC,More Andy Green audio pls. I like it.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,brandonatron,4,Wed May 13 03:24:17 2015 UTC,"I'm digging it. Enjoyable to hear him talk to the players, the umps, hear what he's telling the guys rounding the bases. They should do this once a week, if not more."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,4,Wed May 13 03:27:15 2015 UTC,Ya Ruby!
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Delta_V,4,Wed May 13 03:27:56 2015 UTC,"Rubby says ""give me a part of this"""
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,xSaintJimmy,6,Wed May 13 03:28:55 2015 UTC,Let's hear the mic from Greene on that one.   I wanna learn some new curse words.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,ellius,4,Wed May 13 03:30:43 2015 UTC,Yes please!
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Delta_V,2,Wed May 13 03:32:16 2015 UTC,"Probably stuff like, ""bleep bleeping Ahmed, keep running you bleepity bleep"""
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,6,Wed May 13 03:32:43 2015 UTC,Haha De La Rosa screwed Ahmed over by running to 3rd
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,ThisMachineKILLS,6,Wed May 13 03:31:02 2015 UTC,"Hands up, and it's another one!"
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Delta_V,4,Wed May 13 03:43:14 2015 UTC,Damn this is the year for Harper.  He sees the ball really well in SO situations so far.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Freyja_God,4,Wed May 13 04:20:48 2015 UTC,"Alright going to bed, great game guys n gals I'm sure we'll remember the one for awhile."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Delta_V,4,Wed May 13 04:38:30 2015 UTC,At least today's game will almost certainly be better than yesterday's
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,3,Wed May 13 00:18:55 2015 UTC,Was the new flair so you could get away from Josh for a bit?
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,5,Wed May 13 01:33:50 2015 UTC,Sorta. Also wanted to try out one of the new flairs
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,3,Wed May 13 01:35:35 2015 UTC,"Well now I have to get use to the new face, lol"
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,3,Wed May 13 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"Want another chance to pick the sidebar image over at /r/Nationals for a bit?

You've got plenty of time. Good luck!"
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Mispelling,3,Wed May 13 00:19:28 2015 UTC,We should put on the old uniforms tonight
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,brandonatron,3,Wed May 13 01:38:35 2015 UTC,We should every night.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,cheerbacks,3,Wed May 13 01:40:21 2015 UTC,FLAIR UP
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,brandonatron,3,Wed May 13 01:44:25 2015 UTC,Will do. I should mention that this is an alt account after someone literally tried to track down PS3 to his home address to do God knows what.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,cheerbacks,3,Wed May 13 01:49:48 2015 UTC,Holy shit. No way. Hopefully PS3 is aight.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,brandonatron,3,Wed May 13 01:55:54 2015 UTC,He is. Currently enjoying DP's single.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,cheerbacks,3,Wed May 13 01:56:45 2015 UTC,Nice
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,brandonatron,3,Wed May 13 01:57:21 2015 UTC,Shit speaking about that I haven't seen that guy for a while. Did someone actually try to track PS3 down?
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,HolyCelestia,3,Wed May 13 02:19:01 2015 UTC,Yeah really I was like where the hell is ps3
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,amperx11,2,Wed May 13 03:10:22 2015 UTC,He is here. Hiding in plain sight.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,cheerbacks,1 point,Wed May 13 03:15:24 2015 UTC,His account is gone too.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,HolyCelestia,2,Wed May 13 06:26:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah. He's sorry for the unexpected absence and he wants to say ""godbacks""."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,cheerbacks,2,Wed May 13 02:33:22 2015 UTC,"I know I'm fairly new to hanging out here, but what in the world happened to cause that?"
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,2,Wed May 13 02:47:28 2015 UTC,Not really sure. The Internet is bound to have some undesirable people and he just happened to run into one.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,cheerbacks,2,Wed May 13 03:07:19 2015 UTC,"Well that royally sucks. Some people just take things too personally and have no business being online. It's the Internet, the land of make believe and cute animals.  Hope he's back here before too long."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,2,Wed May 13 03:09:22 2015 UTC,Oh he is already.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,cheerbacks,4,Wed May 13 03:12:20 2015 UTC,DP! Nice!
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,3,Wed May 13 01:43:32 2015 UTC,Nice!

azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,sotech,4,Wed May 13 01:59:04 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, Peralta! Wow."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,4,Wed May 13 02:02:45 2015 UTC,So close. :(
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,3,Wed May 13 02:05:01 2015 UTC,That play almost got put on highlight rotation...
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,brandonatron,3,Wed May 13 02:05:29 2015 UTC,"Please not Tuffy, too."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,5,Wed May 13 02:28:12 2015 UTC,WOOoOOOOOoOOOOO ENDER!!!!

azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,5,Wed May 13 02:56:44 2015 UTC,Nice Tuffy!
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Delta_V,5,Wed May 13 02:58:16 2015 UTC,"Tuffy, you lovable bastard!"

azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,ellius,4,Wed May 13 03:22:55 2015 UTC,"OK, who gave CO the magic water?"
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,5,Wed May 13 03:22:57 2015 UTC,That is one fine looking drawing.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,5,Wed May 13 03:24:15 2015 UTC,"Make Huddy proud, Rubby!"
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,ellius,5,Wed May 13 03:27:21 2015 UTC,"Hah, was wondering if Bert or someone would have that kind of a line.  Rubby helping his own cause!"
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,3,Wed May 13 03:28:00 2015 UTC,"Last at bat, Ender sac flied with the bases loaded, then Trumbo hit a home run. The first part happened, will the second happen again?  Edit: God damnit Ahmed. Don't know why you turned around"

azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,Freyja_God,3,Wed May 13 04:42:33 2015 UTC,Far nicer win tonight with all that offense. Great to see!
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,3,Wed May 13 04:44:48 2015 UTC,That Sound. Mmm mmm
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,brandonatron,3,Wed May 13 02:41:19 2015 UTC,"That man can hit the ball hard, damn."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,3,Wed May 13 02:49:35 2015 UTC,Did they just say 111 MPH? Geez. That would have gone a loooong way if he hit it at a different angle
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,go_dbacks,3,Wed May 13 02:50:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, 111 MPH. Would have destroyed the pool if it landed there."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,3,Wed May 13 02:58:19 2015 UTC,TUFFSTER!
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,3,Wed May 13 02:58:04 2015 UTC,AHMED GOT A HIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,ellius,3,Wed May 13 03:01:34 2015 UTC,"Well, guess all the errors the Nats have committed so far is staying with them a bit longer. And with the announcers talking about defense on this night of all nights."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,3,Wed May 13 03:02:03 2015 UTC,Dammit Ahmed. Not with Trumbo at the plate.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,3,Wed May 13 03:30:15 2015 UTC,Damn.
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,3,Wed May 13 03:35:32 2015 UTC,Chicken Wings on fire!

azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,xSaintJimmy,3,Wed May 13 03:53:15 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, fuck."
azdiamondbacks,35rs3e,bp9801,4,Wed May 13 04:10:25 2015 UTC,Is there someone in -1/2A that can play short stop?

But yes, he's very fun to hang with. And he unbuttoned his shirt but the camera never panned over, so he didn't take it off all the way.   We did start a wave from the expensive seats though, which is next to impossible. It was a weak wave, but a wave nonetheless."

His command was starting to slip, even on the first out that he got. I would have taken him out after the walk to Myers.  His pitches really did look good though, it was like watching him in 2011 all over again. Going to be nice once he is ready to start again next season."

On high fly balls and/or deep ones, they'll start watching and if the fielder doesn't look like he'll get it, then they'll run while keeping an eye on things. Otherwise they go back to the base and get ready to tag if deep enough. Plus the third base/first base coach can tell them what to do and whether to run all the way or tag up."

azdiamondbacks,35fog1,mind_elevated,1 point,Sun May 10 03:46:34 2015 UTC,baseball continues to get more confusing and interesting
azdiamondbacks,35fog1,HolyCelestia,1 point,Sun May 10 03:47:26 2015 UTC,Look at your first/third base coaches for guidance
azdiamondbacks,35fog1,WhatTheeFuckIsReddit,1 point,Sun May 10 03:46:48 2015 UTC,"You can start running if you are reasonably sure that the ball won't be caught.   You have to keep an eye on the 3rd base coach, though. It's their job to tell the runners when and where to go."
azdiamondbacks,35fog1,ellius,2,Sun May 10 03:51:14 2015 UTC,hmmm this is interesting. good luck fellas
azdiamondbacks,35fog1,fightinchunk,2,Sun May 10 03:54:47 2015 UTC,Reed gave up a run again? God damn it how is he still a closer?

azdiamondbacks,35gqbl,SnakeBot,5,Sun May 10 04:44:25 2015 UTC,"I won't lie, I wouldn't have even been that mad about this result if it wasn't J-Up that hit that homer. Damn.  This series has been just blue balls to the extreme. Shows that the team is kind of not that far away, yet so far away. Bullpen will need to be addressed before this team is to return to contention.  Chase pitched well, I guess that is a positive. Hope the NL adds a DH since the team has 4 OF'ers that should be playing every day (Ender, AJ, Mark and David)   If baseball had a tanking type situation we see in the NBA, this would be a nice and fun tank loss."

azdiamondbacks,35d2dt,AzWiLdCaT1988,3,Sat May 9 14:02:13 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mid he joined the booth on a headset for a half inning from the dugout now and again.
azdiamondbacks,35d2dt,pablohoney102,2,Sat May 9 17:48:11 2015 UTC,They really are something else.
azdiamondbacks,35dbk1,SnakeBot,4,Sat May 9 05:25:41 2015 UTC,"I said this on the game thread, but trading the two infield prospects for Hellickson was the only move from this TLR/DS regime that I both did not get then, and do not get now.   I literally do not see what TLR/DS see in him that makes him a guy pitching every five days for this club. Hopefully Ray takes his spot sooner rather than later, and especially when Archie comes back.  At least the offense showed up today and didn't lose in a shutout I guess."
azdiamondbacks,35dbk1,TropangTexter,3,Sat May 9 05:42:24 2015 UTC,I do not enjoy watching Shellickson   He is my new Cahill
azdiamondbacks,35dbk1,joecb91,2,Sat May 9 05:32:40 2015 UTC,Hale was not very happy in that interview. >.<
azdiamondbacks,35d0eg,F22A10_fanatic,14,Sat May 9 03:10:26 2015 UTC,I think we have an answer to that question after tonight.
azdiamondbacks,35d0eg,Freyja_God,7,Sat May 9 03:27:27 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that's the case.  I've never really been impressed with him.
azdiamondbacks,35d0eg,drewpy_drew,2,Sat May 9 03:42:57 2015 UTC,That trade made zero sense in the Dbacks plan going forward. He's such a tedious pitcher to watch...I'd rather give Robbie Ray a shot
azdiamondbacks,35d0eg,RavianNightmare,2,Sat May 9 13:59:12 2015 UTC,Ray deserves a shot after the outing he had in Colorado.
azdiamondbacks,35d0eg,theMumaw,6,Sat May 9 15:20:30 2015 UTC,if we do the 6 man rotation its with ray and not hellickson
azdiamondbacks,35d0eg,ellius,3,Sat May 9 03:31:27 2015 UTC,Is it confirmed that Corbin will start as soon as he comes back? I figured they'd used him in the pen for a while to ease him back into it.
azdiamondbacks,35d0eg,mind_elevated,2,Sat May 9 06:09:50 2015 UTC,"Last I heard he was doing Sim-games at Chase, then heeding to Salt River Fields to get some extended spring training starts, then Visalia to pitch a couple games there.   It's looking a lot like they want him ready to start games as soon as he's able."

azdiamondbacks,35bcd0,go_dbacks,6,Fri May 8 18:07:01 2015 UTC,"No surprise to me, he always was a plus plus defender. I think this is the year it starts to all click for him."
azdiamondbacks,35bcd0,TheUrbaneSage,5,Fri May 8 20:51:37 2015 UTC,Sounds about right...
azdiamondbacks,35bcd0,Antarix,3,Fri May 8 18:47:06 2015 UTC,"Pollock is a beast on defense, it hit me after that double catch he made last year. It was so impressive the opposing crowd gave him an applause. For Ahmed, he needs to be better than Pollock defensively for me to start respecting him, or get his batting straighten out. Ahmed is frustrating me, it's nearly pointless to give him a bat. Get close to 200 at least."
azdiamondbacks,35bcd0,kittypoop,2,Fri May 8 20:30:37 2015 UTC,Then why the shit do I still have to play online with the 28th ranked defense on The Show?  Update that already San Diego.  So many dropped popups...
azdiamondbacks,35bcd0,Freyja_God,1 point,Fri May 8 21:46:08 2015 UTC,It's a shame he got hurt when he did last year. He was playing at an All Star level. Hopefully he stays healthy and gets voted into the ASG along with Goldy this season.

Looks like Cubs and Astros resulted in a loss, while the Rockies just brought the game to within one via a homer.  Edit: Looks like Rockies twice got a homer in different games, but each was just a solo shot to get within one."

azdiamondbacks,35bqt4,roxtafari,2,Sat May 9 00:33:34 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Soccer, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

azdiamondbacks,359bpo,HolyCelestia,8,Fri May 8 04:50:55 2015 UTC,Hah! Players thought Chip was drunk when he put Trumbo in the 2-spot and Pollock in cleanup.  Guess he was on to something.
azdiamondbacks,359bpo,bp9801,4,Fri May 8 04:45:34 2015 UTC,"Pollock in the 5 or 2 makes sense imo.  Trumbo's great production at the 2 seems like it could be small sample size related.  But who cares, WINS"
azdiamondbacks,359bpo,Freyja_God,3,Fri May 8 08:26:15 2015 UTC,"I like Pollock in the 2-spot because it's nice having his and Ender's speed in front of Goldy and Trumbo. Goldrumbo, as it were. Still, with Trumbo ahead of Goldy, it certainly doesn't seem to be hurting a whole lot. Still putting up big numbers. BB mentioned it during the broadcast, but when Tony La Russa was managing the Cards he'd have Jim Edmonds in the 2-spot at times. Guess Chip felt like if it worked then, maybe it will now. So far, so good, because they're winning!  Ender and AJ have a similar enough OBP (think it's within 20 points) to make it debatable who will leadoff, imo. Both do a good job of getting on base ahead of Goldy and Trumbo, so just put whoever up and let them walk home every so often."
azdiamondbacks,359bpo,bp9801,2,Fri May 8 08:36:31 2015 UTC,AJ can certainly SLUGGGGG; can he be a 4?  We'll see if he can hold a cleanup spot.  We both seem to love the flexibility of the batting order tho.  It's quite sexy.
azdiamondbacks,359bpo,Freyja_God,1 point,Fri May 8 08:50:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know if he can sustain a ton of power in the cleanup spot, but he can drive them in and get on base. Not a typical cleanup hitter, but sometimes that can be a good thing.  And yeah, how flexible the lineup is can only help the team. Pollock's been moved down, but still hits. Trumbo is up and just rakes. Ender is pretty good in the leadoff spot. If Owings and Ahmed start to get hot, look out."
azdiamondbacks,359bpo,bp9801,2,Fri May 8 16:21:59 2015 UTC,They're probably trying to get Trumbo better pitches to crush ahead of Goldy.
azdiamondbacks,359bpo,cheerbacks,2,Fri May 8 14:55:37 2015 UTC,"Would make the most sense. Let Trumbo get something good to hit, which he has been, and then try to figure out what to do with Goldy, who just seems to hit everything."

azdiamondbacks,358g73,ellius,10,Fri May 8 02:16:43 2015 UTC,Why does everyone on r/baseball think that Saltalamachia is a good replacement for MVTuffy?
azdiamondbacks,358g73,Raptor231408,8,Fri May 8 02:50:40 2015 UTC,Tuffy is just an underground gritty diamond in the ruff that /r/baseball overlooks. Saltalamacchia is just a household name because he played in Boston. imo I'd rather have Tuffy going 1-4 a night with excellent defense than Salty hitting an occasional HR and below average D. Our team era would probably +1 with Salty
azdiamondbacks,358g73,mind_elevated,7,Fri May 8 02:55:21 2015 UTC,Well said! Wasn't it Salty that had the problem throwing back to the pitcher at one point?
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,4,Fri May 8 02:58:42 2015 UTC,"No idea, really. Salty is a fine catcher, but his offense seriously leaves something to be desired. I know there was talk after Miggy was shipped out about trying to find a more proven catcher than Tuffy, but right now, Tuffy's holding his own."

azdiamondbacks,358g73,Electric_Warrior_,7,Fri May 8 02:17:36 2015 UTC,You guys brought the purples back!!! <3
azdiamondbacks,358g73,falloutranger,7,Fri May 8 02:24:04 2015 UTC,"Throwback Thursdays! Only get seven of these this year, but man are they going to be sweet."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,6,Fri May 8 02:24:59 2015 UTC,:D
azdiamondbacks,358g73,falloutranger,8,Fri May 8 02:26:30 2015 UTC,Were Goldy's HR stats conflicting?  I thought this was his 8th
azdiamondbacks,358g73,Teb-Tenggeri,6,Fri May 8 02:44:23 2015 UTC,"It was #8, yeah."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,ellius,7,Fri May 8 02:45:49 2015 UTC,LOVE IT TUFFY! We don't need Salty!
azdiamondbacks,358g73,flaming_scepter,8,Fri May 8 02:49:05 2015 UTC,Apparently Salty's signing brought out the Hulk in Tuffy...
azdiamondbacks,358g73,groovygarrett,8,Fri May 8 02:49:07 2015 UTC,FINALS ARE OVER DESPITE SCREWING UP REAL HORRIBLY LET'S WATCH BASEBALL.

azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,7,Fri May 8 04:29:29 2015 UTC,Archie so silly.
azdiamondbacks,358g73,ellius,6,Fri May 8 02:12:06 2015 UTC,That was classic.
azdiamondbacks,358g73,brandonatron,7,Fri May 8 02:13:59 2015 UTC,Tuffy!  Salta-who? X2
azdiamondbacks,358g73,cakelorldeath,7,Fri May 8 02:49:53 2015 UTC,"Tuffy wants to keep his job, haha."

azdiamondbacks,358g73,mind_elevated,6,Fri May 8 02:57:02 2015 UTC,"Let's Go Rubby, Stand Em!  Edit: Look at Rubby deal out there. Kinda beautiful."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,brandonatron,7,Fri May 8 03:02:09 2015 UTC,"TUFFY!  Try to replace him, huh? Nope!"
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,6,Fri May 8 03:25:16 2015 UTC,Never what you want to see.  =/
azdiamondbacks,358g73,ellius,7,Fri May 8 04:25:21 2015 UTC,Yeah that didn't look good. Rough night all around for SD
azdiamondbacks,358g73,Electric_Warrior_,4,Fri May 8 04:27:09 2015 UTC,What happened? I really couldn't tell here.
azdiamondbacks,358g73,F22A10_fanatic,3,Fri May 8 04:31:02 2015 UTC,"Landed funny, I think."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,6,Fri May 8 04:32:08 2015 UTC,"The commercials with players are so fantastic this year.   RJ selling air conditioners, and Corbin selling cheese.   Love it."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,ellius,2,Fri May 8 01:35:48 2015 UTC,"I love Big Unit selling the AC units. Really like the new one with him and his camera, as it feels more natural."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,2,Fri May 8 02:20:45 2015 UTC,Nothing about that glare is natural
azdiamondbacks,358g73,Teb-Tenggeri,1 point,Fri May 8 04:13:46 2015 UTC,Good point. Just him and the lady talking is funny because it seems so clunky.
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,4,Fri May 8 04:15:44 2015 UTC,KABOOOOM
azdiamondbacks,358g73,brandonatron,6,Fri May 8 01:52:34 2015 UTC,This inning is my best friend
azdiamondbacks,358g73,ilonzo,5,Fri May 8 02:05:25 2015 UTC,Sexy throwback colors and a sexy first inning
azdiamondbacks,358g73,mind_elevated,6,Fri May 8 02:09:49 2015 UTC,"""We were all in a bit of a purple haze up there in Denver."" Ha."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,lazdiaz,7,Fri May 8 02:11:40 2015 UTC,Hopefully someone got a screenshot of Archie in the catcher mask
azdiamondbacks,358g73,HeadApe,5,Fri May 8 02:14:06 2015 UTC,I'm loving the throwbacks as well! I can't wait to get a Goldy jersey.
azdiamondbacks,358g73,cardinals1996,6,Fri May 8 02:15:25 2015 UTC,"Have to admit I scoffed at them, at first. but then I looked beyond Rubby and saw our hideous road grays. You win."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bspoots,3,Fri May 8 02:18:22 2015 UTC,"You guys totally need new unis. Or just new colors, really."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,3,Fri May 8 02:26:07 2015 UTC,"New colors would be great. There's a big anticipation over the reveal of the All Star Game logo this summer, as it could shed some light on the future plans with jerseys/branding."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bspoots,3,Fri May 8 02:29:22 2015 UTC,"That would be a good time to announce something, to be sure. Would the fans be behind a switch to brown and gold?"
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,3,Fri May 8 02:39:34 2015 UTC,"Based on the people I follow on Twitter, I would say yes. Padres brass seems to think we're the vocal minority though. I just think we lack a real identity."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bspoots,3,Fri May 8 02:44:19 2015 UTC,"I've seen some blogs and the like in favor of it, plus those fan edited unis posted on reddit a while back had a lot of support. Honestly if the Padres were back to brown and orange, it would look really fine. Much better than being another of the teams in blue."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,3,Fri May 8 02:47:17 2015 UTC,No. Purple and teal are the only colors that the DBacks could switch to and the fans be fine with
azdiamondbacks,358g73,Raptor231408,3,Fri May 8 02:46:25 2015 UTC,I mean for the Padres to switch from blue and whatever their other color is.
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,5,Fri May 8 02:48:14 2015 UTC,Well then. Carry on
azdiamondbacks,358g73,Raptor231408,3,Fri May 8 02:49:52 2015 UTC,"Will do! Really, I do wish the D-backs would change back to purple and teal. Maybe add in a bit of turquoise."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,3,Fri May 8 02:57:36 2015 UTC,I feel like I'm the only one that likes gray jerseys.
azdiamondbacks,358g73,cardinals1996,3,Fri May 8 02:27:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, I love away grays, generally. Ours are just... generic."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bspoots,3,Fri May 8 02:28:32 2015 UTC,"Eh, they're not bad. Most teams' road grays look the same anyways."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,cardinals1996,6,Fri May 8 02:31:25 2015 UTC,Beats it out!  Man...
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,5,Fri May 8 02:26:02 2015 UTC,lol TUFFY TIME BITCHES!!!

azdiamondbacks,358g73,brandonatron,3,Fri May 8 04:07:43 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Hits it hard, but right at someone."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,5,Fri May 8 04:09:54 2015 UTC,Corbin and Archie in the same rotation is going to be so killer.
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,3,Fri May 8 04:14:22 2015 UTC,"Bradley, Corbin, Lopez, Shipley, Toussaint.   Pls?"

azdiamondbacks,358g73,cardinals1996,3,Fri May 8 04:32:09 2015 UTC,"Man, nearly thought Rubby had an infield single there."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,4,Fri May 8 02:21:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, OD, so futile with the bat. I still love you."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bspoots,3,Fri May 8 02:31:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you caught it, but J-Up had an interview on Intentional Talk earlier today talking about OD's first hit of the year. Was pretty hilarious."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,3,Fri May 8 02:37:50 2015 UTC,I didn't! I'll have to check that out when the podcast version is out. Thanks for the tip!

azdiamondbacks,358g73,amperx11,5,Fri May 8 04:15:23 2015 UTC,"He was chasing after a ball about 10 rows foul.  After giving up on the ball, he jumped up the wall anyway and appeared to tap someone on the back with his glove while they were turned around."

azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,2,Fri May 8 04:33:36 2015 UTC,Just down the line and the hitting continues!
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,2,Fri May 8 02:44:03 2015 UTC,"Little longer before Lamb gets back, damn."
azdiamondbacks,358g73,bp9801,2,Fri May 8 03:19:00 2015 UTC,Well this game is the exact opposite of the game I just got back from. We lost 43-33.... In a tournament. It was a strange night.
azdiamondbacks,358g73,cheerbacks,1 point,Fri May 8 04:37:07 2015 UTC,No homerun limit?
azdiamondbacks,358g73,DoOgSauce,1 point,Fri May 8 05:07:01 2015 UTC,Nope. Big innings the entire game for both teams but they shut us down the first two innings and most of our runs came in the last two.
azdiamondbacks,358g73,cheerbacks,2,Fri May 8 13:59:48 2015 UTC,Did Tuffy get his body taken over by the ghost of Joe Dimaggio?
azdiamondbacks,358g73,mind_elevated,1 point,Fri May 8 03:28:10 2015 UTC,Friar faithful here.  Just wanted to say you're squad looked pretty damn fucking good yesterday. NL West is gonna be a fun race. Peace out.
azdiamondbacks,357tbx,gasalcido,2,Thu May 7 20:43:45 2015 UTC,Really hope the offense doesn't decide to take the weekend off again. These could be some entertaining slugfests
azdiamondbacks,357tbx,Electric_Warrior_,2,Thu May 7 21:17:53 2015 UTC,Hopefully Ender keeps right on being Ender. He's the only reason my fantasy team is winning this week
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,AzWiLdCaT1988,8,Thu May 7 14:45:37 2015 UTC,League minimum? Sweet.   Can use him as backup and free up Pacheco for pinch hitting.   Or just send him to Reno...
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,ellius,3,Thu May 7 17:16:56 2015 UTC,I think they will send Salty to Reno and use him as Tuffy's backup which will free up Pacheco for the utility role.
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,BransonAllen,2,Thu May 7 19:12:50 2015 UTC,Or perhaps the opposite
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,mintbacon,6,Thu May 7 22:52:24 2015 UTC,Oh fun
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,cheerbacks,8,Thu May 7 14:48:32 2015 UTC,I don't know how I feel about this one. Tuffy plays a hell of a lot better defense.
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,Soccer_Pro,5,Thu May 7 16:03:11 2015 UTC,"I was listening to Doug and Wolf this morning, and Derick Hall said that if they sign a catcher, he wouldn't necessarily be on the big league club.  Edit: Just signed to minor league deal. Seems like a depth move while Oscar Hernandez gets healthy."
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,cakelorldeath,4,Thu May 7 16:58:43 2015 UTC,"With that in context Im much happier with it. While I wouldn't want him staring, he does add nice depth being a veteran and all."
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,Soccer_Pro,0,Thu May 7 17:52:01 2015 UTC,"Tuffy's defense slid down hill this year compared to last year, and his bat has gotten even worse. He provides a net negative contribution to the team."
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,TheUrbaneSage,0,Thu May 7 20:57:31 2015 UTC,Slid?
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,cheerbacks,1 point,Thu May 7 21:31:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, Slid. As in, past tense, his defense has already made the slide downhill."
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,TheUrbaneSage,5,Thu May 7 21:56:10 2015 UTC,"Only reason I'm semi excited about this is that I get to yell ""SAL-TA-LA-MACHIA"" a few times a week."

azdiamondbacks,356hr6,TweetPoster,3,Thu May 7 14:46:32 2015 UTC,Interesting.  I like Tuffy and way he commands the game.  If guys like owings and ahmed were doing better maybe Tuffys offensive woes wouldnt be as much of a problem.  And in a line up full of righties a switch hitting catcher doesnt sound to bad.
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,wampaman,2,Thu May 7 21:38:25 2015 UTC,I think we really need to bring up Peter O'brien he has a really nice bat but he just needs to work on his defense. Excited to see him join the club hopefully soon
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,Dhardie29,3,Fri May 8 21:51:23 2015 UTC,"Ugh, no one outside of the dbacks actually knows anything about our catching situation and just spews ignorant crap about poor Tuffy. I love him dearly and think he's exactly what we need right now. We should make it a point when venturing into r/baseball to correct the naysayers and educate them on our beloved Tuffy and current team philosophy."
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,Sargentk,4,Thu May 7 17:32:45 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Tuffys appear to be hitting .208/.250/.208. That's a Jeff Mathis level of terrible, and I can tell you from personaly experience that I'd rather have Salty than Jeff Mathis.   But, you're obviously much closer to the situation than I am, what makes you love Tuffy so much? (No, I am not being the least bit ironic, I'm genuinely curious)."
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,jigokusabre,4,Thu May 7 19:33:58 2015 UTC,"It's no question that he's not going to win us any ballgames with his bat. But the organization is more than ok with that for the time being. I'll post what I posted in the /r/baseball thread: Tuffy isn't the ideal starting catcher on almost any baseball team right now, but what he lacks in offense, he more than makes up for behind the plate. His ability to block ball after ball in the dirt has already proven invaluable. He's saved more runs already I'm sure that a few others teams catchers have scored. He's also no slouch when it comes to keeping the runners honest. He's an extremely bright kid that can call a great ball game. The pitchers love working with him and the fans love cheering for him. He's great for the club right now. For what this organization is striving to achieve in couple short years, Tuffy is perfect right now. Saltlamacchia in no way represents an upgrade at this point in the season and quite frankly starting him over Tuffy would be a step in the wrong direction.  Basically management is taking this team in a very strategic direction. If you're a dbacks fan, there's serious reason to be very excited about our immediate future and beyond."
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,Sargentk,1 point,Thu May 7 20:26:27 2015 UTC,"Tuffy isn't exactly a kid, and he's actually a year older than Saltalamacchia. As to Tuffy's defense, it's far from perfect. I've watched enough games to see when a glove only catcher has lost a step, when his bat is already horrible. It's never pretty sight. The Diamondbacks should be exploring every available option."
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,TheUrbaneSage,2,Thu May 7 21:42:38 2015 UTC,Tuffy is a pretty ideal back up catcher. He has a lot to teach an pitchers like working with him. But as a starter we need to find a long term solution. Salty is worse in every way compared to Tuffy. This smells of insurance move more than anything.
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,Darkstargir,1 point,Thu May 7 22:00:52 2015 UTC,"Salty has more major league experience, has a better bat than Tuffy, and is younger. So that's not an accurate statement at all, he's not better in multiple aspects. When Salty is healthy, he has a higher offensive potential. Defensively, I'd say Tuffy is still better even with a declining glove, but his bat is so bad it negates any gain defensively. I'm not even really arguing that Salty is good, I'm arguing that Tuffy Gosewisch IS THAT BAD. I don't know how the hell he got a reputation for having a stellar glove, but I don't see it watching him play, or looking at his statistics."
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,TheUrbaneSage,1 point,Thu May 7 22:19:02 2015 UTC,"The power in Salty's bat is about all he has. His a terrible hitter, who's one good season was driven by a high BABIP. I'd rather stick it out with Tuffy while we find a future catcher.  Tuffy is far from the best catcher but his glove is passable whereas Salty's really isn't. As I said Tuffy is a good presence. The pitchers like him, but the front office NEEDS to find a solution to this hole immediately. Salty is not the answer."
azdiamondbacks,356hr6,Darkstargir,1 point,Thu May 7 22:29:06 2015 UTC,"I'll admit that building a young pitching stuff is important to a team like this, and I'll agree with the front office finding a solution, but we shouldn't completely dismiss a player's possible contributions. If it doesn't work out, it's just a minor league deal, and the rapport between Tuffy and the young pitchers isn't threatened. Salty is still young enough that I think he might have a good season left in him if he's playing in a healthy clubhouse enviroment, he's healthy(big problem as to why he's never lived up to his prospect legacy), and most importantly, he's in a ballpark that is hitter friendly. Outside of Fenway, none of the ballparks he's been in have done him any favors. I agree in he's not the answer, in that even if he turns out to hit and catch well, he's still a free agent at the end of the year so he's just a stop gap. Catching will likely be a hole for a long time unless the Diamondbacks find a diamond in the rough via trade, waivers, or the draft. Taking a chance on guys like salty and giving them a place in the minors.  People shouldn't take deals like this serious,(I am not terribly invested in either player, I just want to give each player their fair shake statistically), but they shouldn't dismiss them completely. This how you find your diamond in the roughs and fluke players of the year. Yeah, it probably isn't the answer, but you don't know unless you give it a shot. He's still younger than Tuffy, has 6 years more experience in the majors, and he's a former top prospect with a fantastic minor league career on top of it. I see no problem with giving the dude a shot in the minors. Tuffy's still got his shot in the majors anyway."

azdiamondbacks,352uia,mind_elevated,3,Wed May 6 21:06:09 2015 UTC,Guess they figure they have to score as many as possible in Denver. Only way to be sure to guarantee a win.

azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,3,Wed May 6 19:36:12 2015 UTC,Has Tomas played more games at 3B? How has he looked?
azdiamondbacks,352uia,go_dbacks,4,Wed May 6 19:28:17 2015 UTC,"Hasn't looked too bad. Hasn't looked too great, either. But hasn't looked too bad.  He'll make a nice play, then bobble a regular one."
azdiamondbacks,352uia,ellius,3,Wed May 6 19:43:02 2015 UTC,At the plate or on the diamond?
azdiamondbacks,352uia,Leakyradio,3,Wed May 6 19:31:13 2015 UTC,On the diamond
azdiamondbacks,352uia,go_dbacks,5,Wed May 6 19:32:59 2015 UTC,"his range isn't impressive, but jalepeno""s off the bat down the line hes pretty sweet with. If he can get to the ball, his arm isn't bad, but still his range and his unfamilair manner with pop ups in foul ground leave more wanting."

azdiamondbacks,352uia,go_dbacks,3,Wed May 6 19:33:58 2015 UTC,Well that stunk.
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,5,Wed May 6 19:35:56 2015 UTC,a strikeout would have been soothing compared to that hunk a junk bunt.

azdiamondbacks,352uia,HolyCelestia,3,Wed May 6 19:56:45 2015 UTC,I'm just sitting here at work; my coffee shop is dead slow today but I've got the game playing on the flatscreen and I'm kicking back watching Trumbo hit dongs. Life is good.
azdiamondbacks,352uia,qridproqro,3,Wed May 6 20:02:53 2015 UTC,Why is Trumbo batting 2nd? That's Kind of interesting...
azdiamondbacks,352uia,giantjensen,3,Wed May 6 20:13:26 2015 UTC,He absolutely mashes at Coors Field. This is the only situation where I agree with putting him in the 2 hole.
azdiamondbacks,352uia,go_dbacks,4,Wed May 6 20:16:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he is doing amazing! I just thought it was weird, I'd assume Goldy would be batting 4th and trumbo 3rd."
azdiamondbacks,352uia,giantjensen,3,Wed May 6 20:19:49 2015 UTC,"My thought, too. But with Trumbo in the 2 spot, he seems to enjoy it."
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,1 point,Wed May 6 20:23:30 2015 UTC,"His numbers against the Rockies just annihilate his numbers against everyone else since he became a Dback  By either method of the #2 hitter (Sabermetric version ""best hitter hits 2nd"" or traditional guy that makes contact and is willing to hit the other way and advance runners) he is a very odd fit there though."
azdiamondbacks,352uia,joecb91,3,Wed May 6 20:34:12 2015 UTC,"Hey Dbacks, save some for me so I can run away from my responsibility and finals."

azdiamondbacks,352uia,HolyCelestia,3,Wed May 6 20:29:34 2015 UTC,A Jack Stack is worth at least 60* tacos.  Edit: a number
azdiamondbacks,352uia,qridproqro,3,Wed May 6 20:39:23 2015 UTC,That's Joe's.

azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,3,Wed May 6 20:31:38 2015 UTC,Collmenter is doing it again.
azdiamondbacks,352uia,HolyCelestia,3,Wed May 6 20:34:57 2015 UTC,"Whatever Chip, just leave him out to dry out there. Should've been done after 7. I'm sick of that crap"
azdiamondbacks,352uia,HeadApe,2,Wed May 6 21:51:46 2015 UTC,"I was shocked to see him start the 8th. Maybe figured he could do it, but I would have yanked him out by then."
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,2,Wed May 6 21:55:35 2015 UTC,"I think because we're up by so much, and he doesn't want to use the bullpen when we have a double header, so he left them out there as long as possible."
azdiamondbacks,352uia,giantjensen,3,Wed May 6 21:56:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a good reason and all, but the past two innings Collmenter was getting hit hard even on the balls that were outs :/"
azdiamondbacks,352uia,HeadApe,1 point,Wed May 6 22:04:48 2015 UTC,Better approach than the Rockies are using.
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,2,Wed May 6 22:27:45 2015 UTC,"Really makes no sense, like they are giving up? 7 pitchers in a double header, when you're down but more than 5 all day"
azdiamondbacks,352uia,giantjensen,1 point,Wed May 6 22:34:27 2015 UTC,"Certainly how I view it. Like they're putting a wash on both games. Not like Triple-A pitchers can come over from Colorado Springs anymore, even if there's a tiny gap between games."
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,3,Wed May 6 22:38:34 2015 UTC,Rockies broadcasters are impressed with Burgos
azdiamondbacks,352uia,go_dbacks,3,Wed May 6 21:56:35 2015 UTC,Tomas Grand slam for his first homer!
azdiamondbacks,352uia,giantjensen,2,Wed May 6 22:22:10 2015 UTC,Matzek has no control today evidently.
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,2,Wed May 6 19:43:38 2015 UTC,"Hah! Thought it was a walk, but turned into a popup!"
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,2,Wed May 6 19:50:13 2015 UTC,"Aw, no more Matzek."
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,2,Wed May 6 19:56:52 2015 UTC,"Late strike calls hopefully don't become a thing throughout the rest of the game. Well, for the D'backs, at least."
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,2,Wed May 6 20:15:49 2015 UTC,Yas!
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,2,Wed May 6 20:20:27 2015 UTC,Home run for A-a-ron!
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,2,Wed May 6 20:21:55 2015 UTC,20 minutes between the two games? Wow. Guess they want to get it in quick in case the rain comes back.
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,2,Wed May 6 20:34:29 2015 UTC,"Ender had that played the whole way. So sweet to see. Little bit of trouble in that inning, but Ender's catch helped to keep it from getting bad."
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,2,Wed May 6 20:50:55 2015 UTC,Josh looks to continue his trend of giving the bullpen some relief. Always good to see in the first game of a doubleheader.
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,2,Wed May 6 21:33:02 2015 UTC,"Would be sweet to have BB with some Zeppelin going on. But that Jingle Bell Rock story, hah!"
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,2,Wed May 6 21:34:21 2015 UTC,Good thing there's 12 runs.
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,2,Wed May 6 22:01:00 2015 UTC,"Either the Rockies are planning on the starter in game two pitching all 9 innings, or they figure the relievers will work twice in the same day."
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,2,Wed May 6 22:26:18 2015 UTC,"Nice arm from Ahmed, wow. Time for a short break, then game two!"
azdiamondbacks,352uia,bp9801,2,Wed May 6 22:39:49 2015 UTC,OHHHH SNAP.  THIS IS A TACO GAME!!  Offense!!  We missed ya.
azdiamondbacks,34ztxp,SnakeBot,7,Tue May 5 22:46:54 2015 UTC,"Hate to tell you guys, but it hasn't stopped raining since they postponed the game yesterday. I'll be shocked if we get a game in tonight."

It's supposed to rain a good portion of the day tomorrow (although I think they might get tomorrow's game in), rain all day Thursday, all day Friday, all day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  This is going to fuck up our home schedule something fierce."
azdiamondbacks,34ztxp,JSA17,7,Tue May 5 23:44:54 2015 UTC,They might as well fly back and play at Chase Field
azdiamondbacks,34ztxp,amperx11,4,Tue May 5 23:49:40 2015 UTC,maybe we can just have the teams go to boulder an compete in a snowboard or hippy rockclimbing comp for the series win? arroyo would would throw a no hitter in best carabiner technique.
azdiamondbacks,34ztxp,adventurepony,4,Tue May 5 23:47:45 2015 UTC,"Half the guys on our team grew up in Venezuela. They didn't see snow until they came here, and even then some of them might have still never seen it."

azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,Delta_V,3,Thu Apr 30 00:36:49 2015 UTC,"CO quit swinging at the first pitch, and field grounders hit to you in the shift, and hit a grand slam... Sheesh slacker."
azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,brandonatron,3,Thu Apr 30 01:57:28 2015 UTC,"Thomas, hit the ball in AIR"
azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,brandonatron,3,Thu Apr 30 02:43:00 2015 UTC,I'd love to see CO just uncork on one right here. I'm feeling it  EDIT: That's like the opposite of what I thought would happen but at least it was productive

azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,RavianNightmare,2,Thu Apr 30 13:44:05 2015 UTC,Peralta flashed the leather twice in the same inning. Once with the rocket arm to nail a runner at home and then right after with a leaping grab in front of the wall.  Tomas is raking at the plate so far. Trumbo is doing his usual bases clearing routine.
azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,bp9801,2,Thu Apr 30 03:55:31 2015 UTC,Nice! Sounds like a fun game
azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,go_dbacks,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:57:56 2015 UTC,Oh it is! Lots of good things going on yet again.

azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,bp9801,2,Thu Apr 30 03:25:23 2015 UTC,Shows off with the glove and now with the bat! Nice hitting Peralta!
azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,bp9801,2,Thu Apr 30 03:44:21 2015 UTC,So spoiled on these two out hits
azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,brandonatron,2,Thu Apr 30 03:47:02 2015 UTC,Well maybe if you used builders who knew about leveling off a plot of land to build a house you wouldn't have crap rolling all around.  Think there's another commercial added to the list of despised ones.
azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,bp9801,2,Thu Apr 30 03:59:37 2015 UTC,Let's go Burgo!
azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,go_dbacks,2,Thu Apr 30 04:11:21 2015 UTC,Nice start to the debut.
azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,bp9801,2,Thu Apr 30 04:12:20 2015 UTC,God is it just me or is Owings batting like shit? Remind me why we were so high on him before?
azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,ComplacentCamera,5,Thu Apr 30 01:56:44 2015 UTC,He's got 13 hits in his last 10 games.   Remember that he wasn't allowed to start hitting until the last week or so of spring training. That's why he's had the slow start
azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,ellius,2,Thu Apr 30 02:01:14 2015 UTC,Ah. I haven't caught very many games. But it seems like every time I'm watching he's flying or grounding out.
azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,ComplacentCamera,-13,Thu Apr 30 02:03:27 2015 UTC,"The game thread goes wild, what a fanbase!"

azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,ellius,-7,Thu Apr 30 02:05:48 2015 UTC,I guess they only show up when you guys play the World Champs now. That kind of sucks :(
azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,ricecilantrolime,8,Thu Apr 30 02:15:37 2015 UTC,Shouldn't you be down the 3rd base line interfering with balls that are in play?
azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,ellius,3,Thu Apr 30 02:17:22 2015 UTC,AYYO
azdiamondbacks,34c5vg,cheerbacks,3,Thu Apr 30 02:21:13 2015 UTC,"Whatever dog, no one asked you to come in here"
azdiamondbacks,34axgu,edtehgar,2,Wed Apr 29 18:20:21 2015 UTC,This game is creepy.  its like a cross between watching a little league game or a glorified  batting practice.

azdiamondbacks,34axgu,amperx11,2,Thu Apr 30 01:06:46 2015 UTC,"Aww I wanted to watch this game, didn't realize they were playing this early. Any way to watch it after the fact?"

azdiamondbacks,348ela,BransonAllen,9,Wed Apr 29 02:51:56 2015 UTC,Archie came back from the hospital and congratulated his teammates. Class act! http://imgur.com/a97YFXv
azdiamondbacks,348ela,jmailboxhead,5,Wed Apr 29 05:15:06 2015 UTC,hearing his interview after the game was inspiring.  all he was worried about was getting back on the mound for the team.
azdiamondbacks,348ela,Charlottemaybe1,3,Wed Apr 29 13:33:24 2015 UTC,He's got heart. There's no doubt about it.
azdiamondbacks,348ela,amperx11,5,Wed Apr 29 14:24:07 2015 UTC,My heart stopped when he hit the ground
azdiamondbacks,348ela,BigChinoDon,5,Wed Apr 29 03:31:47 2015 UTC,God poor Archie.. Nobody deserves that
azdiamondbacks,348ela,ellius,3,Wed Apr 29 03:27:53 2015 UTC,Does not look good.  Wonder if he broke something.
azdiamondbacks,348ela,noiamnotchris,6,Wed Apr 29 03:07:45 2015 UTC,"Right off the cheek.   Hopefully, if it has to be something, it's dental and not orbital. =/"
azdiamondbacks,348ela,persianduck,3,Wed Apr 29 03:24:42 2015 UTC,The sound of the impact was one of the worst impacts I've heard in my years of watching sports.  Though it is relieving to watch the rest of the pitching staff step up their game after the lead starter goes down.  Wishing for a quick recovery and minimal damage for Archie.
azdiamondbacks,348ela,ComplacentCamera,3,Wed Apr 29 04:52:07 2015 UTC,Can't we have pitchers that just stay healthy? FUCK!!!! fkldjasflkjskldfjaklsdjflkasjl

azdiamondbacks,348s6h,ComplacentCamera,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:08:50 2015 UTC,I didn't even think of that as a possibility. Is that common?
azdiamondbacks,348s6h,Soccer_Pro,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:04:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think its common, but some pitchers change the way they pitch to avoid getting hit again."
azdiamondbacks,348s6h,ComplacentCamera,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:30:51 2015 UTC,Let's hope that doesn't happen. Archie was pitching damn near perfectly.
azdiamondbacks,348ixg,Teb-Tenggeri,6,Wed Apr 29 03:29:24 2015 UTC,Watching Trumbo gun it for second only to frantically scramble back to first when he realized it was a huge mistake was pretty funny.
azdiamondbacks,348ixg,Costigan,3,Wed Apr 29 04:12:21 2015 UTC,At least he didn't try for third like a fucking broken train (Tómas)...
azdiamondbacks,348ixg,TheUrbaneSage,3,Wed Apr 29 04:14:30 2015 UTC,"You jinxed it. It's like a No-no, your just not supposed to say anything."

azdiamondbacks,347rso,bp9801,12,Wed Apr 29 02:20:01 2015 UTC,If any good news can come out of this its that it hit him in the cheek instead of the head. That's a lot less likely to be anything brain damaging and he may even recover pretty soon from that.
azdiamondbacks,347rso,omegaorb,4,Wed Apr 29 02:20:43 2015 UTC,"This is how it looks so far, which is good. When Kershaw took a soft liner off the cheek this year he lost a tooth, had some dental surgery. Source"

azdiamondbacks,347rso,bp9801,4,Wed Apr 29 02:33:37 2015 UTC,"Probably the only real good news, imo. Easier to come back from that."

azdiamondbacks,347rso,bp9801,7,Wed Apr 29 03:12:59 2015 UTC,"Well that is freaking heartbreaking. Archie was doing so good, but then that comebacker. Didn't look pretty, but glad to see him walking around. Huge goose egg on his face, but man, so glad he walked off on his own. Please don't be anything serious."

azdiamondbacks,347rso,bp9801,4,Wed Apr 29 02:20:50 2015 UTC,Any hit to the head can cause brain damage but that is a whole lot better than if it hit him in the side of the head.
azdiamondbacks,347rso,TweetsInCommentsBot,4,Wed Apr 29 02:21:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, massive goose egg. My initial thought was it got his temple, but then seeing that swelling on his cheek felt better. Still not what I wanted to see at all happen, but the cheek area is better than the temple. When he walked off he seemed to spit some blood, so maybe cracked a tooth or three. Easier to deal with that than a skull fracture."

I don't think we are any more negative than any other sub, we're actually more accepting and dedicated after last season."
azdiamondbacks,33w9nn,amperx11,4,Sun Apr 26 06:07:13 2015 UTC,Well again you mention reed. A lot  of people were hating on Owings early but look at what he has done. It's all just another day another game. We should be looking at the positive side. If you look at my post about Bob Brenly a week or two ago I think you will understand more what I am saying. Got to see what we can improve on rather than be hate on what's happened
azdiamondbacks,33w9nn,shwoople,2,Sun Apr 26 06:17:10 2015 UTC,Reed has been a consistent source of disappointment as a closer since last year.
azdiamondbacks,33w9nn,notocho,2,Sun Apr 26 19:15:16 2015 UTC,"The only consolation there is for how terrible Reed is, is that Davidson hasn't been any good for Chicago, either."
azdiamondbacks,33w9nn,Raptor231408,2,Sun Apr 26 20:20:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say consistent... He saved half of every win last year, and the dbacks won 2/5 of his blown saves in extras"
azdiamondbacks,33w9nn,TropangTexter,3,Sun Apr 26 23:11:27 2015 UTC,"Losing the way they did today and yesterday sucked, especially after blowing a runners on 1st and 2nd with no one out and Goldschmidt up to plate by having two terrible at bats to get the 2nd and 3rd out, and then the awfulness of Addison Reed give up a run afterwards, but besides that, if you came into this season not expecting much (which 95% of us were not), at least there are signs for the future to be somewhat optimistic about. First, 9 straight quality starts, that if in the losses in those 9 games had better offensive output, the team would have a better record now. Secondly, Owings is finally at .241 after being below the Mendoza line before his bat heated up. Him hitting better will really help the Diamondbacks offense especially when they stop throwing Hill out there.  It's just rough watching Aaron Hill, Nick Ahmed and Mark Trumbo on the plate though."
azdiamondbacks,33w9nn,TropangTexter,2,Sun Apr 26 06:52:15 2015 UTC,Definitely valid points. I especially agree with your last one. Although I think hill and trumbo are trade bait ao im hoping they realize that and set out to do better for us. They are not apart of the future. This is the type of response I was looking for. Discussion of the future and discussion about the players we may not want to have on the team but can look to trade and improve on those positions
azdiamondbacks,33w9nn,Meldreth,3,Sun Apr 26 07:27:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah absolutely. I am bullish on the future of this team and nothing Hill and Trumbo does (or don't do) doesn't change it, since like you said, I don't see them as part of the future at all.   To me, besides wins and losses, progress from the guys I think we can all consider a key part of this future defines whether something can be taken from this season or if it will be another lame-duck. The thing is, I can sit through losses if Bradley keeps looking like a top of the line guy, de la Rosa's stuff shines along with greater maturity (like his start tonight), the young bats like Lamb and Owings keep it going, Inciarte and Pollock keep being a force at the 1-2 and all that.  Sure, it will look ugly if Goldschmidt goes on a mini-slump, or if the team loses more games like they did today and the Rangers loss, but I try not to take too much from this season when it comes to the long-term prognostication of this club if that makes sense."

azdiamondbacks,33vvpo,SnakeBot,5,Sun Apr 26 03:14:04 2015 UTC,Just clocked out of work. Wanted to drop by and say Addison Reed is a fuck boy
azdiamondbacks,33vvpo,ThisMachineKILLS,3,Sun Apr 26 03:15:48 2015 UTC,"I can't stand watching Reed pitch....  Might be getting the wording wrong here too, but the pregame show mentioned something about how Hale wants the hitters to be aggressive at the plate. Trumbo said something about how what Hale wants from them is different than the emphasis on patience/drawing walks that you see a lot of in the MLB now.  Yeah, the offense was tipped way too far on the aggressive scale with how they were swinging the bats tonight. Hacking at some terrible pitches."

azdiamondbacks,33vvpo,kittypoop,1 point,Sun Apr 26 04:45:40 2015 UTC,"Even though it ended the game, I thought Tomás had a great AB there.  I think I've got some hope that wasn't there before about his ability to battle and take pitches at the plate. He showed he's got a pretty good eye against a very tough closer.   If he has the discipline to do that more often, we might just have something here."

azdiamondbacks,33sgt5,edtehgar,3,Sat Apr 25 06:00:02 2015 UTC,"6 hits and 0 walks over 6 innings is a 1 WHIP. That's not a poor performance by any means.  Hell, the pitcher for the pirates had 7 hits and 2 walks over 7 innings. On paper, he did worse than Collmenter (aside for strikeouts, but an out is an out. the first inning can end with a strikeout or a ground ball to second and I personally don't care. the end result is net)."
azdiamondbacks,33sgt5,Raptor231408,2,Sat Apr 25 10:08:54 2015 UTC,Also Corbin wont be back til at least June.

azdiamondbacks,33r0pd,Darkstargir,4,Fri Apr 24 20:18:34 2015 UTC,I'd love to join if the ticket become available.

azdiamondbacks,33r0pd,BransonAllen,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:04:55 2015 UTC,Sounds great. Put me down as #3 in line
azdiamondbacks,33pfs6,Antarix,4,Fri Apr 24 12:52:16 2015 UTC,At least a good pitcher has finally identified himself as someone Towers would want on his team...
azdiamondbacks,33pfs6,notocho,2,Fri Apr 24 19:12:04 2015 UTC,"Actually looking back at the video it was Eaton who started talking stuff first, then Ventura responded. Hmm looks like the media likes to spin things around."

azdiamondbacks,33pfs6,Leakyradio,2,Fri Apr 24 22:13:39 2015 UTC,It's happened a couple times the last two seasons. Gibson and company had pitchers intentionally hit opposing players to retaliate against accidental HBPs and r/baseball made big deal out of it
azdiamondbacks,33pfs6,drDekaywood,1 point,Sat Apr 25 01:46:42 2015 UTC,It's been a pretty common thing the last year or two  http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2014/08/06/arizona-diamondbacks-dirty-team/13680827/
azdiamondbacks,33lr87,wrathofkahn,5,Thu Apr 23 15:36:23 2015 UTC,"Also of note, there may be hours when the store is open, even if the team is not in town."
azdiamondbacks,33lr87,LCNite,3,Thu Apr 23 17:11:01 2015 UTC,"almost every sports store in town has dbacks gear, but if you are looking for something that specific your best bet will be the team shop at the stadium. you can find hats and jerseys and shirts at dicks, sports authority, just sports, lids, walmart, target, just about everywhere but i only ever see stuff like a hello kitty pin consistently at the team shop. the hours and location for the chase field store are listed here"
azdiamondbacks,33lr87,jmailboxhead,2,Thu Apr 23 22:33:53 2015 UTC,"the only true AZ DBACK store i believe is at the stadium. Otherwise the big sports store in most malls is called, ""Just Sports"". The one I know of is at the Chandler mall, second story, by Nordstroms."
azdiamondbacks,33lr87,SwickFC,2,Thu Apr 23 17:06:50 2015 UTC,I think there is one at Paradise Valley Mall and one at Desert Ridge in Phoenix too.
azdiamondbacks,33lr87,Darkstargir,3,Thu Apr 23 19:43:27 2015 UTC,"There's a just sports in just about every mall, even MetroCenter."
azdiamondbacks,33lr87,pablohoney102,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:22:53 2015 UTC,Dbacks team store at the stadium open is mon-sat 10-5 when the dbacks are on the road.  Its the only official store in town.
azdiamondbacks,33k8lg,SnakeBot,11,Thu Apr 23 04:45:50 2015 UTC,Hours later I am still super impressed with Goldy running hard on what should have been a Trumbo fly out. I don't think there is a lineups worth of guys in MLB that would have been running that hard on that play. Goldschmidt is the perfect ball player.
azdiamondbacks,33k8lg,notocho,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:20:35 2015 UTC,"He looks really awkward running, though. Ender looks smooth when he runs"
azdiamondbacks,33k8lg,Teb-Tenggeri,7,Thu Apr 23 15:30:18 2015 UTC,Our bullpen scares the fuck out of me.  When corbin gets back id like to move collmenter back.
azdiamondbacks,33k8lg,edtehgar,4,Thu Apr 23 04:53:40 2015 UTC,Archie is a magician
azdiamondbacks,33k8lg,go_dbacks,5,Thu Apr 23 04:58:06 2015 UTC,"First he out duels Kersh and MadBum, then takes down Diamondbacks arch enemy Gallardo.....The Prophecy is true."
azdiamondbacks,33k8lg,brandonatron,3,Thu Apr 23 06:18:18 2015 UTC,"I wish a 5-1 lead actually FELT like a 5-1 lead. Bullpen is rough. Oh well, like archie said a win is a win. I'm happy with .500 ball up to this point."
azdiamondbacks,33k8lg,dog_named_billy,3,Thu Apr 23 05:31:33 2015 UTC,Archie was really good after that rough first inning.
azdiamondbacks,33jaek,SnakeBot,10,Wed Apr 22 23:40:02 2015 UTC,"Goldy is a great base runner.  He's just smart.  That's why he can steal - not because his speed, but his intelligence."
azdiamondbacks,33jaek,Freyja_God,10,Thu Apr 23 03:19:58 2015 UTC,I'm at the game bubbas. I'll post super blurry pics of the umps later

azdiamondbacks,33jaek,HeadApe,9,Thu Apr 23 01:41:11 2015 UTC,Ender is just too cool.
azdiamondbacks,33jaek,ellius,9,Thu Apr 23 02:54:44 2015 UTC,If the MLB wants to cut down on game time they should just give Aaron Hill an automatic 0-2 count cause he's gonna end up there anyways.

azdiamondbacks,33jaek,GoldysMassiveArms,7,Thu Apr 23 03:42:03 2015 UTC,"Lol we were sitting next to each other last season, I'm at 143, 15, 23  I've only got half seasons but still"
azdiamondbacks,33jaek,Howie_85Sabre,4,Thu Apr 23 03:47:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't sat in my my own seats this season due to adding additional tickets every game. I couldn't even tell you my current seats off the top of my head. I have half season too, but only because I live in Casa Grande."
azdiamondbacks,33jaek,GoldysMassiveArms,8,Thu Apr 23 03:58:10 2015 UTC,Man roughing up gallardo makes me so fucking happy
azdiamondbacks,33jaek,edtehgar,6,Thu Apr 23 03:37:00 2015 UTC,If we could face aces more and Heston less we would be in great shape

azdiamondbacks,33jaek,andrewry,8,Thu Apr 23 04:38:17 2015 UTC,Fun facts:  Today will be only the second time in Diamondbacks history that a pitcher will bat 8th in a regular season game.  Today is senior vice president of baseball operations De Jon Watson's birthday!  Dbacks starters have gone 2-1 with a 1.93 ERA in the past six games.  Today is Earth Day! To celebrate I will be doing absolutely nothing special.  Rangers second baseman Rougned Odor has a brother named Rougned Odor.

azdiamondbacks,33jaek,cakelorldeath,2,Thu Apr 23 02:21:14 2015 UTC,You have to think Pennington world be a better option out there

azdiamondbacks,33f2ok,boofbonser9,2,Wed Apr 22 00:22:33 2015 UTC,"I'm still not convinced Frandsen ever actually played the infield before the Nats, but he's a good depth signing after the Lamb injury. Decent bench bat and can play pretty much anywhere if asked."

azdiamondbacks,33eypi,go_dbacks,6,Wed Apr 22 02:13:47 2015 UTC,Chase has pitched a really good game today. I like seeing him get into a groove. I wonder if they will let him pitch the 7th? I say thy should give him a chance.
azdiamondbacks,33eypi,GoldysMassiveArms,3,Wed Apr 22 03:13:27 2015 UTC,"Probably, with a short leash, if I had to guess"

azdiamondbacks,33eypi,pajamas_all_day,3,Wed Apr 22 04:30:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess he threw it back to the pitcher's mound. Trumbo turned around to him and was like holy shit you got an arm. Haha."
azdiamondbacks,33eypi,Darkstargir,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:35:47 2015 UTC,Your buddy has a great arm. In the replay you can see the ball still rolling past the pitcher's mound and up to the third base line.
azdiamondbacks,33eypi,pajamas_all_day,3,Wed Apr 22 04:49:43 2015 UTC,Jesus! It amazes me that this kid only plays for ASU's club team.
azdiamondbacks,33eypi,Delta_V,3,Wed Apr 22 05:00:33 2015 UTC,Here's a link to the home run
azdiamondbacks,33eypi,i_love_nny,2,Wed Apr 22 05:06:08 2015 UTC,"Don't think so, but good on your buddy!"
azdiamondbacks,33eypi,karry107,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:27:38 2015 UTC,Thats awesome. My cousin did the same thing years ago at a Twins game. playing against the royals i think...
azdiamondbacks,33eypi,uninan,6,Wed Apr 22 04:26:47 2015 UTC,Fun facts:  I missed Sunday's game because my brother got the cast off his arm! I was spending the day hanging out with him. Shout out to /u/HolyCelestia for his wonderful fun fact that day.  The dbacks only need two more wins to match there march/April total from last season.  Dbacks are averaging a 4.6 rating on Fox Sports Arizona through the season so far. The highest it's been since 2005.  Chase Anderson is from Texas and threw 3 no-hitters while pitching at Rider High School in Wichita Falls.  Arizona is 16-10 in its past 26 interleague games at Chase Field.  Dbacks pinch-hitters are 6-17 (.353) so far this season.  Ender Inciarte has a .383 average in interleague play.  Minors: Robbie Ray had 10 strikeouts in five innings against Albuquerque.
azdiamondbacks,33eypi,notocho,3,Wed Apr 22 00:34:59 2015 UTC,So the /r/baseball power rankings have the dodgers at number 1 and the dbacks at 22. So we win the series against the best team and we still arent top 20? Come on
azdiamondbacks,33eypi,adventurepony,7,Wed Apr 22 00:30:16 2015 UTC,I don't want to alarm you but there are a lot of retards on /r/baseball

azdiamondbacks,33eypi,go_dbacks,3,Wed Apr 22 02:24:20 2015 UTC,If you're talking about the draft room they have a lot more than that
azdiamondbacks,33eypi,GoldysMassiveArms,2,Wed Apr 22 02:19:36 2015 UTC,That's good to hear. I was pre-disappointed.

azdiamondbacks,33eypi,ComplacentCamera,6,Wed Apr 22 04:13:15 2015 UTC,First time I seen Huddy out there in awhile when was the last time he pitched?
azdiamondbacks,33eypi,brandonatron,3,Wed Apr 22 04:11:11 2015 UTC,"last week, he had a .000 ERA this season before that meltdown"
azdiamondbacks,33eypi,bbdv,2,Wed Apr 22 04:13:20 2015 UTC,Last season against the Giants I think.
azdiamondbacks,33eypi,go_dbacks,0,Wed Apr 22 04:12:08 2015 UTC,Man he looks horrible....
azdiamondbacks,33eypi,brandonatron,2,Wed Apr 22 04:13:13 2015 UTC,He looked so good so far this season :(
azdiamondbacks,33eypi,DoOgSauce,5,Wed Apr 22 04:18:52 2015 UTC,So what is that like 5 errors at 3rd? I thought Pennington was a better fielder than that. I think I've seen him botch like 7  plays this season. Pretty much every time the ball comes his way.
azdiamondbacks,33eypi,Delta_V,3,Wed Apr 22 04:13:53 2015 UTC,Nice bounce back inning Anderson

azdiamondbacks,33ddv5,Raptor231408,4,Tue Apr 21 17:26:08 2015 UTC,I got 17 because it's what my dad wore in highschool. I switched to 44 this year because everyone is calling me Schmidt since my obsession with Goldy.

azdiamondbacks,33bl6g,HometownJuke,5,Tue Apr 21 04:42:33 2015 UTC,"I missed it, what happened in that game/series? I only know fight(s) broke out."
azdiamondbacks,33bl6g,HolyCelestia,3,Tue Apr 21 04:53:54 2015 UTC,"Okay I might get this wrong but Brett Lawire had a somewhat reckless slide into 2nd and injured Alcides Escobar. Next game Yordano Ventura gives up a homerun to Josh Reddick, gets frustrated, and gives Lawire a 99mph plunk on the elbow. He gets tossed.   Next game Scott Kazmir hits Lorenzo Cain with a pitch (not intentional if you ask me, just trying to throw inside and had a bad release) he's immediately ejected along with Ned Yost and their bench coach I believe.   Then Kelvin Herrara throws at Lawrie again, shoulder high, and it goes behind him. He's immediately ejected, benches clear, and it appears that Herrara points at his head in a I'm-coming-for-your-head-next-time manner (again just speculation).   Ultimately /r/baseball concludes that the Royals are now Hitler in what I believe to be an even bigger overreaction to the Royals overreaction to Brett Lawrie having a somewhat reckless slide into 2nd base."
azdiamondbacks,33bl6g,F22A10_fanatic,3,Tue Apr 21 05:06:41 2015 UTC,"Kazmir didn't get tossed from the game, both benches got warnings and for whatever reason Yost didn't like it and started arguing (I'm assuming).  Then Herrera threw inside on Lawrie first, missed him, and then threw behind him before he got tossed."
azdiamondbacks,33bl6g,jmailboxhead,3,Tue Apr 21 06:00:00 2015 UTC,"lawrie went it hard, escobar got injured.  lawrie got plunked.  that should have been the end.  all that is fine as far as the unwritten rules go. where it crossed the line was the behind the back throw, and threatening the head.  thats where it crosses from a game to a potential for permanent injury. nobody is hitler, i just think herrara went overboard.  i sincerely doubt yost sent herrera to hit lawrie again.  but im secretly glad the general fans have a different team to point at and call dirty, we dont deserve that tag anymore."

azdiamondbacks,3373fh,TheUrbaneSage,13,Mon Apr 20 03:43:41 2015 UTC,"While I think this team is playing much much better than what people outside the Diamondbacks realm of influence overall gave them credit for, I still do not think this is a playoff team. There are still way too many question marks regarding the starting pitching, that while I am happy to watch Bradley turn into what truly is a potential future ace, and even guys like Hellickson and de la Rosa pitch deep into games despite not having the best stuff, and Collmenter shake off two bad starts with a complete game shutout, this pitching staff still has a lot of questions for me to be really sold this team contends this year. Not to mention, at times the offense still seems inconsistent, and the lack of a consistent lineup until Hale stops the Hill showcasing I don't like as well.  That being said, I always felt this team this season was more playing for 2016 when the young guys filled with potential are a year older, plus a lot of money to spend on upgrades. There are a lot of really good starting pitchers available, which with a rotation with Bradley, Corbin, perhaps Collmenter and de la Rosa and even guys like Anderson and also Shipley and Blair out of the minors, could make for a promising rotation in the future.   In short, I still won't even come close to expecting the playoffs. This team still has questions riddled over the rotation that I cannot really expect them to make it there. However, I do believe this team will end up battling for .500. You have to love this team's potential offensively and hell, perhaps the pitching can start to consistently get deeper into games and at least keep the team in it (ala Collmenter all last year).   This franchise, at the very least and for which we should all be thankful for, is on the right right track."
azdiamondbacks,3373fh,TropangTexter,3,Mon Apr 20 04:24:33 2015 UTC,Any idea how Touki Toussaint is doing? He got drafted last season and I have no idea where he is now. AA?
azdiamondbacks,3373fh,HolyCelestia,3,Mon Apr 20 04:27:11 2015 UTC,"I think he's probably in A now.  He struggled pretty bad after being drafted but he has a high high ceiling, though far far away."
azdiamondbacks,3373fh,TropangTexter,4,Mon Apr 20 04:28:01 2015 UTC,Whoa he's only 18 :o how fast do players get called up to AAA or even major league?

azdiamondbacks,3373fh,Ragefield,1 point,Mon Apr 20 06:15:11 2015 UTC,"After looking over the roster and stats for this season, the team does have some rather glaring holes; the bullpen is a mess, the offense has some big holes(edit: to clarify, there are some guys on the roster who I don't think belong on a big league roster, to say the least), and I think the defense is shaky at best. I would be very surprised to see them actually contend for a playoff spot, but I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility. They have a good young team, and yes they are most certainly playing for 2016."
azdiamondbacks,3373fh,Sargentk,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:11:29 2015 UTC,"Surely you're not talking about the diamondbacks defense. Outside of Trumbo and Tomas whenever he plays, the dbacks are among the best in the league."
azdiamondbacks,3373fh,HolyCelestia,2,Tue Apr 21 19:10:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. I stand corrected on the defense, I think I misread a few players statistics, and I'm not as  familiar with a few of the players on the team now. But yeah now that you mention I certainly stand corrected. Goldschmidt I know had a shaky reputation on defense coming up, but even when he was first brought up he showed that he could adjust and better himself, so that's not too surprising. Same thing with Chris Owings, although I haven't had the chance to see him play all that much. Ahmed seems like a solid glove based on his numbers. Pollock though always had a stellar reputation, and the games I saw him play in the minors showed a guy who had a real handle on reading hits off the bat. I really haven't been too into baseball the last three seasons, so I am not as familiar with the team as I used to be. Like I said in my initial post, I used to be heavily involved when I was writing prospect articles about some of the players that are now in the big leagues... It's really a shame how the pitching prospects in the system were handled. We traded away some very good prospects for essentially beans. I think the team is in good hands now, and having the number one pick this year should help. One good thing about the lowered expectations this year is that if the team fails, they'll get a high draft pick which will help bring in some good young talent. If they win, well that's great, that means the players on the team are reaching their potential"
azdiamondbacks,3373fh,GGoodman09,6,Wed Apr 22 09:27:32 2015 UTC,"I personally don't expect us to go far (obviously will be great if we can) since we just overhauled the office (Manager and Chief Baseball Officer etc) and we just made some pretty big changes to our roster. These on top of the fact that this team is pretty young in general.   I think I share the sentiments with others about ending up at least .500 and get the young players some bats and major league experience. On paper our defense and offense look good except maybe pitching but we have Bradley showing his stellar debut against Cy Young winner and World Series MVP. Collmenter shows that he deserves the spot in the rotation. Some pitchers like Ziegler and Nuno (minor league) get the jobs done too.  But hey, whatever it is, I am ready for the wild ride."
azdiamondbacks,3373fh,ComplacentCamera,3,Mon Apr 20 04:21:54 2015 UTC,"I'm just happy to see us being competitive in games. They are so much fun to watch this year.  Plus the 1-2-3 punch of Inciarte, Pollock, and Goldschmidt to start the game is real nice."
azdiamondbacks,3373fh,HoopAndHarm,3,Mon Apr 20 18:59:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I love that part of the lineup. I'd love for us to keep Pollock and Goldschmidt for years to come. I want to see Goldy stay in a D-Backs uniform the rest of his career.
azdiamondbacks,3373fh,Orxbane,3,Mon Apr 20 20:19:03 2015 UTC,"I think we will end up finishing near .500 give or take 5-10 games in either direction. I simply do not think we can make the playoffs without seriously upgrading our pitching staff. We will undoubtedly finish better than last year due to being healthier and much better offensively. Having said that, I hope we can prove everyone wrong and make the playoffs. So far, so good."
azdiamondbacks,3373fh,Raptor231408,5,Mon Apr 20 04:11:33 2015 UTC,"I'm finding that I'm enjoying the games this season quite a bit because I don't have huge expectations for this team.  The wins are great, and the losses don't bother me all that much.   I think the organizations 162plus idea sounds great, but my expectations are more 81plus, as in 81+ wins.  This season will be a great one if we have a winning record and get our young players a year of big league playing time, without a huge amount of pressure on them.  That being said, of course I won't complain if they were to make it into the post-season."

azdiamondbacks,3373fh,amperx11,2,Mon Apr 20 09:57:58 2015 UTC,I think I watched something where Chip Hale said that they were brainstorming a mantra for the year and that's what they came up with.
azdiamondbacks,3373fh,UAChemist,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:23:50 2015 UTC,Did a little research and looks like it's purely DBacks. Apparently the players themselves thought it up. http://m.dbacks.mlb.com/news/article/117380938/d-backs-shooting-for-one62-plus-this-season
azdiamondbacks,3373fh,Baby_Powder,4,Mon Apr 20 18:20:13 2015 UTC,162plus!!!! Can't wait till Corbin comes back
azdiamondbacks,3373fh,joecb91,3,Mon Apr 20 12:33:08 2015 UTC,The Dodgers and and the Giants were surprised.
azdiamondbacks,3373fh,awsomecanadian,3,Mon Apr 20 13:50:23 2015 UTC,"I'm still going with what I thought going into the year  Not really expecting a winning record, but this team is going to be a hell of a lot more fun than last year was.  Still wondering what everything is going to look like once regression to the mean sets in for the roster, but right now I can still see the bottom of the batting order and the pitching being an issue for most of the year."
azdiamondbacks,3373fh,notocho,2,Tue Apr 21 01:51:12 2015 UTC,So I'm a Dbacks and Bluejays fan (I'm from Canada so I basically have to cheer for the jays) and thought this very young season I can say that the Dbacks have been the more exiting team to watch. I hope to see a Jays-Dbacks World Series in a few years!
azdiamondbacks,3373fh,OAKgravedigger,2,Mon Apr 20 06:40:04 2015 UTC,I think the dbacks will surprise this year by just being close to 500 whether it be a little above or below. 2016 or 2017 will be our best shots at Cinderella glory.
azdiamondbacks,3371on,GoldysMassiveArms,5,Mon Apr 20 03:25:28 2015 UTC,"Whoa I know we don't pay players as much as the other teams, but I didn't know we spend the least in team salary."
azdiamondbacks,3371on,HolyCelestia,3,Mon Apr 20 03:30:37 2015 UTC,"To be fair our team is very young in the first or second career of their contracts. Also this number doesn't include Cody Ross, or Trevor Cahill. Only the 25 man active roster is listed here."
azdiamondbacks,3371on,joecb91,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:57:16 2015 UTC,I think we were up around 90/95 million going into the season
azdiamondbacks,3371on,TropangTexter,2,Tue Apr 21 20:13:58 2015 UTC,"Team is full of young guys either on rookie deals or extensions on top of their rookie deals (Goldschmidt). The most expensive guy left has to be Hill.  Not to mention, Ross and Cahill are gone like u/GoldysMassiveArms said. Not to mention Montero. Keep in mind the Snakes were at the 100 million mark last season."
azdiamondbacks,3371on,sprawk,3,Mon Apr 20 04:26:28 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/l19BwEg.png Here is a breakdown by position of how much each team is spending by position.
azdiamondbacks,3371on,WhatShouldIPick,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:05:25 2015 UTC,Why are the salaries higher in this picture than the original?
azdiamondbacks,3371on,AreYouSneakin,4,Mon Apr 20 08:06:32 2015 UTC,The ESPN one only includes players on the 25 man roster. It does not include players on the DL (Arroyo) and players who are not on the team (Cody Ross and Cahill).
azdiamondbacks,3371on,joecb91,1 point,Mon Apr 20 09:41:08 2015 UTC,My big takeaway from this is how much of a steal we got on Goldy.
azdiamondbacks,3369t0,SnakeBot,19,Sun Apr 19 23:09:24 2015 UTC,Conclusion: we should have won the World Series last year
azdiamondbacks,3369t0,go_dbacks,10,Sun Apr 19 23:11:31 2015 UTC,Logic checks out
azdiamondbacks,3369t0,edtehgar,9,Sun Apr 19 23:20:39 2015 UTC,I can get used to this
azdiamondbacks,3369t0,edtehgar,6,Sun Apr 19 23:21:00 2015 UTC,"I'll admit that I had my doubts when I watched Hellickson pitch against San Diego in the last series, but he seemed to be getting better on the mount today. Hope he keeps up!"
azdiamondbacks,3369t0,HolyCelestia,7,Mon Apr 20 03:17:22 2015 UTC,okay Now we won two divisional series! Damn Jup.
azdiamondbacks,3369t0,brandonatron,5,Mon Apr 20 01:04:30 2015 UTC,C.O. is heating up.  !!!!!!!!!!!
azdiamondbacks,3369t0,ellius,2,Mon Apr 20 02:22:23 2015 UTC,Just remember to pinch run him as soon as he hits 2nd
