ruby,3e56xi,imbrady,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:00:37 2015 UTC,As others have alluded to the issue is that else doesn't take in a conditional statement. In the case of If/Else the else block is used as a fallback when none of the other conditional statements evaluated to true.  So with that in mind perhaps you could consider using another if as /u/Oranges13 suggested or even an elsif (not sure if you have covered them yet).

ruby,3e32bx,latortuga,2,Tue Jul 21 17:54:18 2015 UTC,"Not that I agree with gp, but a more accurate way to state this is that private methods still register themselves as message handlers for the object, just as public methods do. This is why you can call private methods easily with send.   The only real difference between a private and public method is that ruby will complain if you try to call a private method via dot notation. But this is just a programmer safety net, the underlying implementation is otherwise the same."

ruby,3e2eok,FooBarWidget,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:56:21 2015 UTC,"I liked the book-like format (didn't require javascript - was readable from CLI with lynx, was searchable/printable/downloadable, had a TOC).  I understand why you needed to do this, but don't understand why you decided on a custom solution. A wiki would have worked better, because everyone already knows how to use one. Your new docs basically require everyone to click and read menu items and waste time trying to figure out how and where to possibly find what they are looking for.  TL;DR your new docs require usage docs"
ruby,3e2eok,tastur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:31:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback, but I have some trouble understanding your criticism. Could you elaborate more on them?   was readable from CLI with lynx   It still is. Well I haven't tried with Lynx, but with Elinks the Library is very much readable. The HTML is written to be responsive and to degrade well to simpler browsers.  The only issue open right now is that some things don't work without Javascript. I believe Elinks allows you to enable Javascript. But that brings me to the next point... why is it being readable with CLI browsers so important to you? Don't you use your desktop or phone browser to browse documentation and the general Internet anyway? And since Passenger is an app server, is it unreasonable to expect that you have an Internet connection so that you can read documentation?   was searchable/printable/downloadable   It is still searchable through the search box.  It is still printable, but on a page-by-page basis. Do you really want to print the entire library? It's very big.  It is still downloadable. It's a static site. You can clone the Git repository and build the static HTML files.   I understand why you needed to do this, but don't understand why you decided on a custom solution. A wiki would have worked better, because everyone already knows how to use one.   This I do not understand at all. What exactly is bad about the fact that we didn't use a Wiki? Even though we used a static site generator (Middleman), pages are just normal files that you can edit in your browser. It should be very discoverable because there is an Edit button on the bottom of each page.  I will tell you why we decided on a custom solution:   We have anywhere between 3 and 45 variations of each page, depending on the integration mode that you are using, the programming language that you are using and more. That way, we can show you information that is relevant to you, while hiding information that is irrelevant to you. The beginner walkthroughs have even more variations because the content also depend on the reader's infrastructure, operating system, whether they use RVM or not, whether they use Rails or not, etc. The beginner walkthroughs consist of about 1000 pages, generated from 7 base files but in different combinations of settings.  Doing this would have been completely impossible with a Wiki. We generate all these combinations programmatically by writing Ruby. Wikis make it hard to customize the layout. We wanted complete freedom. For example, the beginner walkthroughs have a very different sidebar (one that lists the steps) than the advanced guides. The front page is also entirely customized for usability. Wikis are harder to read offline. The Library is a static site and is very easily offline downloadable.    Your new docs basically require everyone to click and read menu items and waste time trying to figure out how and where to possibly find what they are looking for.   You say the new docs require everyone to read menu items and figure out where things are. But wasn't that true of the old documentation too? When you read the old documentation for the first time, you also had to scan through the table of contents to find what you're looking for. The new documentation contains a search bar. Didn't that search bar help you?  In any case, the old documentation will be updated with redirects to the appropriate section in the new documentation. Is that good enough for you?"

ruby,3dxclq,colinrymer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:31:27 2015 UTC,"It isn’t recommended to have more than one source per project.    Why? I've had multiple projects use multiple sources - when you have a private gem repo, you have to use multiple sources unless your private repo is setup to mirror rubygems.org (which can be a good idea)."
ruby,3dxclq,Karunamon,2,Mon Jul 20 19:01:53 2015 UTC,"I took that recommendation from the Gemfile man page.  http://bundler.io/man/gemfile.5.html   It is possible, but not recommended as of Bundler 1.7, to add multiple global source lines. Each of these sources MUST be a valid Rubygems repository.   My understanding is because unless you are scoping them you could get an unknown mix of gems from different sources.  With something like a private gem repo I think this is safe enough, but as general advice don't just load in sources.   Part of me wonders if it is because *nix folk are used to having loads of sources in their package managers and don't want people copying that idea across."
ruby,3dz0dg,yez,4,Mon Jul 20 18:03:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, rails has this problem. Strictly speaking, rails does not have a view layer, yet I see where this is coming from.  Many developers follow the fat model approach, and in most cases the presenter adds a layer of complexity and duplicates code, or moves it into another file. The same happens here. I get it is an example, but most developers stuck with encapsulation issues will not be able to figure out instead how to present.  My suggestion for the article is to show what happens when the map code ends up in the controller, and what happens when it's exposed through the model. Both are valid and emphasize the layers that rails ships with instead of adding more.  The example is well chosen btw."
ruby,3dz0dg,verydefunctional,0,Mon Jul 20 22:29:43 2015 UTC,"This point is where I struggle. I can write code that performs equally well whether it originates in the model, controller, view, or presenter. It's not much of a question of performance, which leads me to believe that it is mostly style. As you point out, the code is simply moved. Don't want fat models? Move it to the controller! Want skinny controllers, move it to a presenter! Don't want logic in the views and don't use presenters? Use a helper. The logic has to live somewhere, so why does it matter where?  I realize a skinny model requires less memory. If you have a super fat model, every time you instantiate a User, each user will require more memory (yes?). If you follow the pattern in this post (which I use in my day job - using presenters), you're instantiating the User and Picture ActiveRecord objects, then instantiating a bunch of presenter objects in the same request. Seems like more memory usage than just iterating through the AR objects to begin with.  In the end, does it matter? What matters?  Edit: certainly not downplaying style, readibility, or encapsulation (which, again, seems to be style-related). But my users don't care about any of that! Yes, ""presentation"" logic belongs in the view (or presenter... or helpers) but otherwise, does it really matter."
ruby,3dz0dg,fiveguy,2,Tue Jul 21 00:25:12 2015 UTC,"Well, it's only a matter of style to a degree. Fat models for instance polute the model space with methods that are only used in certain scopes. The same applies to presenters unless you pull in a presenter hierarchy by scope. Fat controllers will eventually make you duplicate code or move it to modules or into the application controller. That said, I recommend starting with one prefered fat <anything> and when it becomes unmaintainable or slow or poluted, take what you have and refactor it into another layer/pattern (not necessarily presenter, take what solves your problem). Having seen what a 7-layered architecture that was introduced because ""we might need it some day"" can do to your general productivity and code quality, I'd drive lean and minimal and refactor once I have a clear picture of what my problem's gonna look like. And from there on, it's less of a style-related choice really, but the best solution to a problem."

ruby,3dsqig,tamershlash,2,Sun Jul 19 02:26:53 2015 UTC,"This probably shouldn't be used for untrusted-user-facing applications on any Ruby version prior to 2.2, since up until then symbols were not collectable, and casting arbitrary hash keys to symbols is a recipe for a memory-exhaustion DOS. Any place where user input may be cast to a symbol is a vector.  For specialized applications such as data stream processing, you're probably better off just creating hashes with symbol keys in the first place, to avoid the GC overhead of creating throwaway strings to create symbols from. If you're parsing something like JSON, you can use the symbolize_names option out of the box."
ruby,3dsqig,cheald,2,Sun Jul 19 13:31:24 2015 UTC,"True. this shouldn't be used in exactly the case that you mentioned, that's why I created a separate gem without even trying to suggest to include this in Rails 5 (not sure if they're going to require 2.2 for it).  However, in a data stream processing case, you can have many developers working on the same pipeline but each one writes a separate step, and steps may even depend on third party gems, and hence it's difficult to guarantee that everything will be symbolized by default. And this is where this gem becomes useful.  The main reason I've built this is because we faced that problem with another project, called OptimusPrime, that we're working on in the company, where developers from many experience levels are working together, and data can be collected from many sources, so it's quite hard to guarantee anything through the every single step in the pipeline and you'd better have inexpensive Hash with indifferent access."

In Ruby 2.2 string hash key literals are automatically interned, e.g. my_hash['Content-Type'] doesn't allocate a new string for Content-Type every time its called, nor does my_hash = { 'Content-Type' => :json }.

I did some initial tests on one of our workloads a month or so ago and it looks promising vs 2.1. The workload in question is processing a real time JSON data stream at a rate of a few thousand events a second. We use string keys for it, at least partially because we found it much faster than converting everything to symbols given that the events are processed fairly quickly.   EDIT: A quick way to check if your code is using the optimization is to run a simple benchmark with the GC disabled and look at the object space before and after."

I think you should be able to jump right in if you have any Ruby experience. Rails abstracts a lot and makes it easy. Just know that it's good to learn how to do things from scratch too though (e.g. understanding how cookies work at the HTTP level, etc)  I think it's easier to answer you question this way: what wouldn't you use Ruby for? Anything that needs a quick boot time (e.g. scripting from your editor where you don't want to boot up the Ruby runtime), anything that needs parallel threads (Ruby threads are restricted to a  single process at the moment due to GIL), anything that doesn't have very good Ruby support (some newer tech might have drivers that are a bit young still), any front-end interaction outside of basic templating (use the JS/CSS/HTML trio).

SQS can delivery the same message more than once regardless of whether or not you confirm that the message was handled on the client side. This is a general property of all distributed queues.

ruby,3do8gg,bascule,2,Sat Jul 18 00:22:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, that can work, ultimately it depends on the application.   When do you store the message id? If it's a long running job that is handling the message you could store the message id at the beginning of the job in some reliable store and then have the job fail mid way due to some uncontrollable situation (e.g. worker node dies). You could store the message id only at the end of the job, but then you could get concurrent execution, assuming your subscriber is multi-process or multi-thread. You could take out a 'soft lock' at the start and have some reaper process clear it after a timeout, just better make the reaper reliable. etc, etc.  Mono-rails may be difficult to work on but distributed systems are much harder. Really, a hard line guarantee of 'exactly once' processing in such systems isn't going to happen without a lot of care taken.   For what it's worth, our highest throughput SQS queue handles 4k message/sec, and it goes into a slightly bonkers mode with high latency and duplicate message delivery every 2 weeks or so. Usually lasts a couple hours at most. Our messages are small, quickly processed and it isn't mission critical that they aren't processed twice, though we would prefer to avoid it. We use a memcached cluster for the message ids with a 24hr expiration but that still isn't super safe, if a memcached node were to die we could reprocess message ids that were stored on that node."

ruby,3dfvz8,jrochkind,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:39:24 2015 UTC,For Rails caches chances are you want a centralize cache so your going to pay the serialization penalty to put it in memcached or redis anyway.  My comment is more about arbitrary object caching. For example I often have background jobs that need to churn through a bunch of data and join various pieces of information from other models along the way. caching those models in ActiveSupport::MemoryStore is very slow in comparison to a non-serializing LRU cache. I often see people use ActiveSupport::MemoryStore for things like this and it really sucks in terms of performance.  We have our own internally built library for this but structurally it is similar to LRURedux discussed in the article.
ruby,3dfvz8,moomaka,2,Thu Jul 16 03:08:42 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks. i wonder why ActiveSupport::MemoryStore bothers serializing, if it's just in memory non-shared cache anyway, couldn't it simply store the actual object without serializing? Or could you even very simply monkey patch it to do this? Perhaps I'll take a look at the code and see if there's an obvious answer as to why not.   Or maybe it's just because then you need to worry about multi-threaded concurrency if you have possibly concurrent threads reading the same object from the cache at once."

The way ActiveSupport::Cache is designed the serialization / deserialization happens at a layer above the storage adapter. By the time ActiveSupport::MemoryStore gets it, it's already just a key-value string-string pair. In theory you could monkey patch your way around this of course, but likely it's just not important enough for the primary use of ActiveSupport::Cache which usually uses memcached or redis in production anyway."

Your Game class is responsible for too much: saving, loading, input, output, and managing the game state.  Design your Game class more like an abstract interface: something you could plug into a web server so people can play Hangman over the internet or that you could hook up to a graphics library to play Hangman in glorious 3D. Thinking in this way will ensure that you don't put stuff in the class that doesn't belong there. It should only care about the game state; it should ensure with every method call that a sensible game state is preserved.  Anyway your problem is that you check for victory and delete the saved game via update_board, which calls save_game right afterwards. So the file is being (momentarily) deleted. I fixed this by adding a simple return unless @running at the beginning of save_game. Even better you could make that a raise since you really shouldn't be saving the game after it's done running.

Good luck!"

If it suits your needs depends on how much you want to build yourself or how many packages you want to add. RoR has a full feature set you can use, so you will want to learn the RoR way while node is just a server, sort of.  As for the second question... Bootstrap is a CSS framework/toolkit.

ruby,3d7r94,Tannerleaf,2,Tue Jul 14 05:53:32 2015 UTC,"Get the Hartl tutorial, and work through it. That uses Bootstrap as its  CSS framework, with some jQuery.  In addition to Ruby, and the Rails framework itself, you'll also need to get to grips with, in this order:   HTML (i.e. HTML5) CSS (this also gets extended by things like SASS) JavaScript (and jQuery)   You'll need to understand HTML, as this forms the foundation for everything else on a website.  With Ruby and Rails, the ERB templating is nice and straightforward, but take a look at Haml; it's weird at first, but quite nice once you get used to it."
ruby,3d7r94,Tannerleaf,2,Tue Jul 14 05:54:55 2015 UTC,"I know a bit of HTML and CSS, not enough to call myself an expert by any means, but I know the basics. Is that enough to get into rails or would I need to properly know HTML/CSS?"
ruby,3d7r94,artem911,2,Tue Jul 14 05:59:46 2015 UTC,"As long as you understand the principles, there shouldn't be a problem.  It's extremely useful to understand how to create HTML as a standalone document, and how to link in CSS to style it up; and then how to link in JavaScript to do some funky things. Because when you progress to something like Rails, those bits and pieces all get broken down into various components; it's useful to know how those components fit together as a whole.  The thing I found with Rails though, was that it's sort of necessary to get to grips with a lot of things at once; so it's useful to know some of the discrete things that make up Rails.   Hm... I should probably add that understanding a little SQL helps a lot too. Rails tends to shield the developer from a lot of the gnarly gubbins in SQL, but it's still useful to understand that as well. It's bloody nice using ActiveRecord though, instead of messing around with raw SQL in your application.  Incidentally, if you want to learn something simpler for the web in Ruby, take a look around at things like Sinatra. You'll be able to apply that to your existing HTML/CSS very quickly."

Just being able to override (monkey patch) functions in the libraries you're using when you need to change their behavior is so useful.  It's not as lightweight as node, but it's got a great community. You can pick and choose libraries to take your application to the next level in ways I never did with pure PHP.

But I occasionally write tests like this:  [1, 2, :apple].each do |parameter|   define_method ""test_foo_#{parameter}"" do     # etc.   end end   Because if :apple is only the parameter that causes the test to fail, I can easily run just that test:  ruby test/foo.rb -n test_foo_apple   I believe rspec uses line numbers for this stuff, which makes it effectively impossible to isolate the one failing test, unless you explicitly enumerate each paramater as a distinct test (as in your second example)."

I've read through the exercise and there a lot of keys and values.   default=default   I think this is a verbose piece of code. I think it simply means 'default'. So #get receives a parameter named 'default'  (evaluated to nil if none is provided when #get is called), and that value is passed to #get_slot when it is called. Consider:  def some_method(arg1, arg2, arg3)    return arg1, arg2, arg3 end  some_method(1, 2, 3)      #=> [1, 2, 3]     some_method(1, 2, blah=3) #=> [1, 2, 3]   Since I am a beginner myself, forgive me as my explanation could be totally wrong.

You may want to read up on some theory about how Hashmaps/dicts are usually implemented at some point, then go back and try to understand his implementation. There are some potential gotchas to Hashes that you may have a hard time following if you don't know how they work under the hood, but those are mostly an issue if a hash is implemented poorly; Ruby comes with a very solid implementation of them that avoids most of those, so I would just use the built-in methods."
