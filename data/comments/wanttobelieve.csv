In the show they said that the shark rapidly descended before getting eaten, a sperm whale isn't that fast. I don't exactly know about the body temperature of a sperm whale, but since it's a mammal I reckon it's warm blooded and most likely has a body temperature above 25 degrees celsius. As I said, it could be a sperm whale, but I reckon it's something else, maybe even a group of orcas."

They fished up most of the sharks in an area in the gulf of Mexico and it wasn't even that deep there (about 300 m). Makes you wonder what could be down there, lurking in the dark. With enough food to never feel the need to surface, we might never know. The creatures they fished up in 'alien sharks' did actually look like aliens from a completely different solar system.   I'd be really interested in seeing even more footage of this so called ""kill zone"", since there was a lot of predatorial activity in the waters above the canyon and somewhere down there the tagged shark got killed as well. This even tickles my interest more than Bigfoot, and I'm quite a bigfoot enthousiast..."

It was during my freshman orientation week.  A group of people from my dorm were hanging out in the lounge and as it got late, one person suggested that we mess around with a Ouija board.  Four people had their hands on the planchette and a group of eight or so of us were simply watching.  They goofed around for a while asking the typical teenager type questions... 'Who is the hottest', 'Who is going to score first', etc.  The planchette drifted around aimlessly or was clearly being pushed to 'yes' or 'no' by one of the four.  Eventually they started asking simply if 'anyone wanted to speak to them'. All of a sudden the planchette moved in a way it hadn't before.  The movement was sudden (so sudden that one of the girls with her hands on it let out a little shriek).  The 'spirit' began to answer questions with great speed.  Someone had to start writing down the letters that it was stopping on because we were having trouble keeping up.  It began to list names and details of their death.  One of the girls watching suddenly started to cry and rushed out of the lounge.  Apparently the name of the spirit, husband's name, childrens' names, date and manner of death all matched up with her recently deceased grandmother.  The odds of all of the details matching coincidentally are pretty slim.  There were five first names and a maiden name given along with a month and year of her passing.  This all happened in the mid 1990's, before it would have been easy to find this type of information out online.  It made enough of an impression on us that nobody ever wanted to mess around with that board again."

We intend each show to have a completely different vibe as we cover as many different topics as we can, rotating between 3 different hosts. So not every show will be for everyone, but I kind of hope that people like that about it. We've had an amazing response from people so far, beyond what we were expecting, and the Reddit users in particular have been amazing. Ep 1 we talked about some of the more notorious stories from around the web, things most of us have heard about before (Tamam Shud, Man from Taured, Overtoun bridge etc..) Ep 2 is about one of our members time in Mozambique and his strange experiences with Witch Doctors, and what he deemed to be miracles. He is the only Christian host of the pod, and these are events that really shaped his belief. The next 3 episodes will be about Strange Broadcasts and Number Stations, Peoples experiences in what they consider to be Haunted Houses, and Miracles that people believed they have witnessed. So it's a mixed bag. If anyone has any of their own stories, about anything, then we would love to hear from you at - unexplainableuk@mail.com  or on here.

wanttobelieve,3bn9n0,sharpsq,4,Tue Jun 30 16:14:48 2015 UTC,"This footage I have always found interesting, but I can't say what I think it is. Like what part of the adult Sasquatch would we be seeing? Judging by the size of the branches and leaves in front of it, it would likely be the head, if Sasquatch are supposed to be the 7-10 foot tall giants witnesses describe. I just don't really understand what I'm seeing, and the analyses seem kind of reaching. The apparent ""grabbing"" that was described in the video could just be muscle movements making the skin move in a way that appears like a tiny grasping hand.  The one thing that jumps out in my mind is a bear. There's a fuzzy, wiggly tuft sticking out of the top of the darker fur that looks to me exactly like a bears ear. I just don't really know what the lighter coloured portion of hair would be in that case. I just don't know though, it's not very clear footage. I don't like that it ends before we get a clear shot of what it is. Unless there was an obvious need to stop filming, then why leave with just this?  Edit: so I just watched the original, and the thing appears to walk off, which is why he stopped filming it. After watching the original though, I am noticing it is rather low to the ground. This makes me further question if this thing could be a Sasquatch. I think the height from the ground leads me to believe it's just a small bear. I don't think a Sasquatch would be that low, even if it were sitting. I'm also noticing in the original, the ""light fur"" isn't as distinct from the dark fur. It looks like the creature's fur is pressed, like it had been laying on its side for a while. Perhaps the sun is just highlighting the hairs that are flattened away from the direction of the fur, at least that's what it looks like to me.  You know, I'd like for this to be Bigfoot as much as the next guy, but I think timbergiant, thinkerthunker and m.k. Davis have too much invested in it, mentally. They sometimes over analyze things, and kind of push their own opinions, rather than try to find a definitive answer. Timbergiant I know spends a lot of time out there filming and trying to find anything he can, and I appreciate that he puts so much time and effort into it, but I also think that's kind of a knock against him. He clearly has invested so much into Bigfoot that I think he's more willing to jump to a Bigfoot conclusion than most people would. Think Thunker, well remember the Yellowstone footage of the cross country skiers that he was adamant were Sasquatch, because they fit his body ratios? He just debunked his body ratios idea, and showed that he doesn't do enough research. He's done good work, but he is also too willing to believe. MK Davis I don't know enough about actually, I've seen him do some analyses that seemed decent, where he just lightened and darkened bits of photos to make parts of the image more clear, but I've also seen him over-analyze and start pointing out faces where there's nothing, so I'm skeptical of his work. I know I'm making some critical statements of these guys, but I think it needs to be said, that just because they're doing work, doesn't mean it's infallible work. Everyone is susceptible to putting their beliefs and hopes over the facts.   I guess I also need to ask, what sort of credentials do any of these guys have? All I know if TG is that he goes out in the woods a lot. That doesn't necessarily make him a skilled outdoorsman or knowledgeable of all of the wildlife in his area. Thinker Thunker is a cartoonist or something? And MK Davis has video analyzing software, I don't know if he's a professional film analyst or if he just analyzes Bigfoot footage. Does anyone have more info on these guys, or are they just sort of taken as the word of God around here, because they're one of the few people that actually do anything in the Bigfoot field?"

Werewolves of legend actually turned into wolves, not man-wolf creatures like in The Wolfman or American Werewolf in London.  I think it was just a mishmash of events and coincidences that lead to the legend. People may have underestimated how cunning wolves could be, so when they found tracks going into a home or something, assumed it must be a wolf with the mental prowess of a man. There were likely some instances where serial killers of the past killed victims, and wolves just happened to be seen near the scene, so we're blamed for the killing. Then there's the lycanthropy as a mental disorder, witches and shamans claiming they could shape shift, etc. there's a lot of elements that go into the myth of the werewolf.  I think hypertrichosis could be responsible for some hairy woodmen sightings. Western European countries have myths of a large hairy man that runs around with a club, which sounds more humanlike than the North American wildman, Bigfoot."

While speaking of more likely, something like the Orang Pendek probably stands a greater chance of being a physical animal due to its smaller size and the area of sightings.

But the possibility of an ape that big living in Asia, South America (rainforests), and other places that have a lot of unexplored, uninhabited areas, something could hide in those areas.  I believe a majority of sightings here in the US are based on people's poor estimation skills for how big something is (people always make things bigger in their head) and are attributed to people mistaking bears and other wildlife as something ape-like.  Like, if you've ever been to Alaska or any other bear-rich area, you can see how some people might mistake them for an ape.  They lumber very much the same way as an ape would, especially when they're on two feet."
wanttobelieve,3983t7,ghostdate,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:40:41 2015 UTC,"I think there's a lot of faulty assumptions being made surrounding Bigfoot. First of all, we're assuming they're more ape than person, while most First Nations histories refer to them as people. In fact a lot of lore from around the world talks about wild men and that's what they think of their local variation of Bigfoot as.  Then we're assuming they have a large breeding population, which may or may not be true. Is it necessary for continued reproduction? Yes, but there's a couple of old accounts of people being taken, such as the Osterman case, where they believe they were taken with intent of copulating with a young female. If true, this would suggest that they don't have large breeding populations anymore and that their populations are probably in decline at this this point. Also, many reports of groups of them only seem to be 2-4, so they might just stick to small family groups.  We're also assuming that we'd be able to discover them if we wanted it to, which in turn makes assumptions about their intelligence. If they're closer related to humans and have a similar capacity for knowledge, they would likely be well adapted to their environment, and capable of living in it, for the most part, undetected. If they are more intelligent than the average forest critter, they'd probably have developed a fear of people and intentionally avoid us.   The amount of unused and untouched forest in the Pacific Northwest, where they're most commonly sighted, is massive and small populations could exist undetected. I'm not so sure about some other areas. I have my doubts about California, as the state as a whole seems much more densely populated, so I don't know how expansive any of their forests are. The Big Thicket area of Texas and moving into the swamp lands of Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida are all pretty dense forest and swamp that small populations could hide in quite well. I don't think there's nearly as many sightings on the Eastern half of the U.S., though there's some, and there are some big forested areas out there that a couple of families could inhabit.  I think there's a lot of potential for them to exist, but I'm guessing if they are out there, they're dying out, at least in North America, as we start to over develop the regions they're thought to inhabit like Washington state and British Columbia."
wanttobelieve,3983t7,Treedom_Lighter,2,Wed Jun 10 18:18:38 2015 UTC,"Not even a skeptic would say that bigfoot isn't at least a real possibility. There are hundreds of thousands of sightings from modern times back into Native American folklore, thousands of track casts that all share remarkably similar (yet very different from human tracks) anatomical features, a few very good videos and photographs, as well as many biological samples that come back as ""unidentified"" (without a type specimen you can't match evidence to an unidentified animal, even if you're almost certain it's from said animal).  And, as /u/wordgood said, there are millions of acres of forests, mountains and swamps in this country that could provide plenty of habitat for a large primate to both maintain a breeding population, find sufficient food to provide for said population, and remain mostly unseen. As for definitive evidence, yeah, maybe nothing will be truly sufficient until someone actually shoots one and gets it back to a lab, but there's absolutely the real possibility."

From wikipedia on ""Empirical Evidence"" ""Empirical evidence is information that justifies a belief in the truth or falsity of a claim.   The senses are the primary source of empirical evidence. Although other sources of evidence, such as memory and the testimony of others, ultimately trace back to some sensory experience, they are considered to be secondary, or indirect.   In science, empirical evidence is required for a hypothesis to gain acceptance in the scientific community. Normally, this validation is achieved by the scientific method of hypothesis commitment, experimental design, peer review, adversarial review, reproduction of results, conference presentation and journal publication. This requires rigorous communication of hypothesis (usually expressed in mathematics), experimental constraints and controls (expressed necessarily in terms of standard experimental apparatus), and a common understanding of measurement."""

The thing is, I could not find any specific incidents of Bigfoot or UFO sightings when looking into this story for the video.    When cross-referencing various articles on the subject one of the most common elements of the story is that UFOs and Bigfoot have been reported in the valley, but it's all very vague. There are no specific accounts included with names or dates, my video is guilty of this as well, but not for lack of attempting to find the info.   In my opinion, this is the first aspect of the legend I flag as questionable, too few details. However ,due to it's remote location, Sasquatch and UFO sightings would seem to be the type of legend you would expect to crop up.   As far as the giants, I think that could be a combination of fact, oral history and exaggeration. Even now there are isolated tribes all across the globe: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples so maybe there once was a Naha tribe that died out from disease in the past, or as you suggested they could be subterranean, perhaps troglodytes.

I think it's very difficult to encounter a bigfoot sorta on demand, for a series like this. Les found quite a lot of strange evidence that pointed in the direction of either a Bigfoot or a hoax, which made it really interesting to look at.    The branch structures, which were found on multiple filming locations. He heard several whoops, not all of them are on tape (I don't think any of them arre). He's a wildlife expert, which would probably mean that he knows most of the sounds of common wildlife. If he says he heard something that he isn't sure about, thats enough evidence for me to believe there might actually be SOMETHING there. He found the upside down tree trunks in several locations. As Todd Standing said, these were found in many locations. He even found some sort of nest near the lake, in the first episode. I'm talking about the place with the grass that was pressed in, with the vertebra lying in front of it. There were rocks that got displaced. The other guy told him about placing rocks on a tree trunk, next to a cross formed out of twigs. Both got disturbed. The cross got destroyed and the stones ended up in two groups: 3 rocks together and one laying apart. The other rocks were thrown away EVERY TIME. He probably found a lot more that I'm not thinking of right now.   To be fair, he didn't found that much ground-shaking evidence, but he did find a lot of tiny pieces of evidence, which , together, form a big puzzle. There are a lot of things out there that are difficult to explain by natural causes, and if Les Stroud can't do it, I certainly can't either."

wanttobelieve,362qhc,sharpsq,2,Fri May 15 16:32:53 2015 UTC,"With Les Stroud joining the search and using stuff like this, I actually get the feeling that he might eventually stumble upon something. I like how he goes in unbiased and how he acts like a scientist instead of a person from the believer/non-believer side.  It's nice to finally have a show on TV that basically says:""there could be something out there, but it could also have been something entirely different. He rationalizes everything. In the episodes he made with our friend/foe Todd Standing, he actually told ""us, the public"" what he thought of his findings, instead of running after Todds ideas. I like that. I used to watch finding Bigfoot as well, but that show got weird real fast. I mean, they're not really taking the search very seriously anymore (in my opinion). Nowadays, they're busier with dressing themselves in kilts and such.  What I'm trying to say is that we need more people like Les, who just go out there without any prejudice for or against Bigfoot. It can be nice to step on a hype train when someone uploads some controversial video about Bigfoot being real, but sometimes you need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Can the footage be authentic? Hasn't it been tempered with? That kind of stuff. It's important to think about evidence thoroughly before accepting it as a truth.  With modern technology it shouldn't be impossible to get a HD video of a bigfoot in the same way that Patterson and Gimlin found theirs. Wether you believe in the creature or not, Les has quite a few moments in the series where he finds stuff that he himself can't even explain. AND HE'S A SURVIVAL EXPERT. He probably is one of the most respected people out there that knows a lot about tracking animals and wildlife in general.  When watching his series, keep an open mind and be surprised by the stuff he finds and hears. You can form your theories after that, which we would love to hear on this subreddit.

Most of the stuff that people are sceptic about is in fact easily counterable, but the same thing goes for proof he comes up with. It's hard to find proof for a creature this big and bizarre that won't have to go through a wall of hate, so the proof has to be really decisive. I'm actually wondering if we'll ever find such proof, it might be too hard to convince people right now.  However, the strongest argument for Bigfoot being real are the sightings. Do sceptics really think that thousands of eye whitness encounters of an unknown creature are made up? People are scared shitless after what they saw in the forest, perhaps even close to their home. That fear isn't fake, and it's highly unlikely that there is some kind of mass phenomenon that causes it.  Of couse, this is just my opinion. I don't know how other believers/non-believers think about this, but I'd love to hear it!"
wanttobelieve,35qrhl,coyootje,1 point,Wed May 20 08:57:10 2015 UTC,I always enjoy his videos and he makes so very good points evidence wise.

She placed bright, out of place objects in the room out of line of sight of the patient; on top of cabinets, etc. When she asked ""out of body"" experience patients to describe the room, zero of them mentioned the hidden objects.

As if the 7,000 people in attendance had walked in off the street and had no idea why they paid their entrance fee. TWO HOURS before they showed the slide, then took a 15 minute break, only to return with presentations in Spanish and then the feed got lost. Slides should have been shown in the first half hour.  And by slides, they really only showed one.  The time should have been spent with convincers that these were authentically from the 40s  All that being said, I thought the slide had value.

I don't know about the alternative history but I do know about the mindset of the keepers of official truth. In every area of science and history, we have an official truth which must not be questioned or commented upon - a kind of religious fundamentalism of science. Academics are the announcers and skeptics are the suicide bombers of that religion.  But truth is subject to change. Any new ideas are always ridiculed, then attacked viciously - and perhaps much later, they are accepted - without any acknowledgment that the skeptic attack dogs were wrong. At least, I've never seen a skeptic admit they were wrong about anything. They just get quiet eventually and pretend they always knew the truth.

wanttobelieve,33q93u,constantstopper,0,Fri Apr 24 17:32:21 2015 UTC,"What made it terrible in your opinion? I liked it a lot. A lot of the links found within were great too. I love the DB Cooper story but I haven't seen some of these theories and this has rekindled my love for this mystery, which now means I'll be on reddit for the rest of the week reading other stories like it."

The filler in between the extremes isn't much more satisfying.. someone disproved by DNA, someone who claimed to be the hijacker but brought nothing else to the table, a most likely unreliable woman who would have committed the crime because of her confused sexuality... it really didn't say anything of any substance.  edit: I think the hijacking is interesting and all, but I just think this article was cheap click-bait."
wanttobelieve,33q93u,constantstopper,-1,Sat Apr 25 02:13:12 2015 UTC,"The article is actually just a big summary of the incident's Wikipedia entry. Cheap in that sense, maybe. But these are all the major theories unless you start delving really deep down the crazy well like the idea that he's, for example, a time traveler."

I will say this though, you have this constant feeling that something is there...even if you don't physically feel anything."
